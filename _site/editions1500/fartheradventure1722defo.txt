THE 

PREFACE.

H E Succeff the former Tart of this 
Work has met with in the Worlds 
has yet been no other ^ than is ac- 
knowlegd to be due to the furprifing 
Variety of the SttbjeSt^ and to the a- 
greeable Manner of the Ferformance. 

All the Endeavours of envious People to re- 
proach it with being a Romance^ to fearch it for 
Errors in Geography^ Inconfiftency in the Relation^ 
and Contraditf ions in the Fa6t^ have proved a- 
bortive^ and as impotent as malicious. 

The jufl Application of every Incident^ the reli-^ 
gious and ufeful Inferences drawn fro^ every 
Fart J are [o many Teftimonies to the goodDefign 
of making it public'k^ and muji legitimate ail the 
Tart that may be called Invention^ or Parable in 
the Story. 

The Second Tarty if the Editors Opinion may 

pafs^ is (contrary to theUfage of Second Part s^)

The Preface. 

e'very JVay as entertaining as the Tirfl^ contains 
as Jirange and furprijing Incidents, and as great 
a Variety of them ; nor if the Application lefs fe-^ 
rions^ or [uitable j and doubt lefs will^ to the fob er.^ 
as well as ingenious Reader^ be enjery way aspro-- 
fit able and diverting ; and this makes the abridg- 
ing this Work^ as fcandalous^ as it is knavijh 
and ridiculous ; feeing^ while tojloorten the Booky 
that they ?nay jeem to reduce the Value^ they 
ftrip it of all thoje Refte^fions^ as well religious as 
moral^ which are not only thegreatefi Beautys of 
theWorky but are calculated for the infinite Ad- 
uantage of the Reader. 

By this they leave the Work naked of its brigh- 
tefi Orimrnents ^ and if they wouldy at the fame 
Time pretendy that the Author has fupplyd the 
Story out of his Invention^ they take frotn it the 
JmpYovementy which alone recommends that In- 
vention to wife and good Men, 

The Injury thefe Men do the Proprietor of this 
Worky is a Prai'tice all honefl Men abhor -y and 
he believes he may challenge them to fhew the 
T);fference between that and Robbing on the liigh" 
wdy^ or Breaking open a Houfe. 

If they can^t Jhew any Difference in the Crime ^ 
they will find it hard to floew why there Jhould be 
any Difference in the Punijhment : And he will 
anfwer for it^ that nothing Jloall be wanting on 
his Party to do them Juflice.

ADVEHTURES 



O F 



Robinson Crusoe^ ^c. 




HAT homely Proverb v^kd on io 
many Occafions in England, viz.. 
T'hat what is bred in the Bone will not 
go out of the Flefh^ ^3.s never more 
verify 'd, than in the Story of my 
Life. Any one would think, that 
after thirty-five Years AiHidtion, and 
a Variety of unhappy Circumftances, which few 
Men, if any ever, went thro" before, r.nd after near 
feven Years of Peace and Enjoyment in the Fulnefs 
of all Things ; grown o'd, and when, // ever,^ it 
might be atiowed me to have had Experience of e- 
very State of middle Life, and to know which was 
moft adapted to make a Man compleatly happy: I 
fay, after all this, any one would have thought that 
the native Fropeniity to rambling, which I gave an 
Account of in my hrft Setting out into the World, 
to have been fo predominate in my ThoughtSj 
fliould be worn out, the volatile Part be fully evacu- 
ated, or at leaft conbens'd, and I might at(5i Years 
of Age have been a little incm'd to ffiy at Home^ 
and have done venturing Life and Fortune any more, 

A s ^^. 



[6] . 

Nay farther, the common Motive of foreign Ad- 
ventures was taken away in me ; for I had no For- 
tune ro make, I had nothing to feek : If I had gain'd 
ten thoufand Pound, I had been no richer j for I had 
already fufficient for me, and for thofe I had to 
leave it to ; and that I had was vifibly encreafing; 
for having no great Family, I could nOt fpend the 
Income of what I had, unlefs I would fet up for 
an expenfive Way of Living, fuch as a great Family, 
Servants, Equipage, Gayety, and the liki, which 
were Things I had no Notion of, or Inclination 
to ; (o that I had nothing indeed to do, but to fit 
ftill, and fulJy enjoy what I had got, and fee it in- 
creafe daily upon my Hands. 

Yet all thefe Things had no Effed upon me, of 
at leaft, not enough to refift the ftrong Inclination I 
had to go abroad again, which hung about me like 
a chronical Diftemper ,• particularly the Delire ol 
feeing my new Plantation in the Ifland, and the Co- 
lony I left there, run in my Head continually. I 
dream'd of it all Night, and my Imagination run 
upon it all Dayj it was uppermoft in all my 
Thoughts, and my Fancy work'd fo fieadily and 
flrongly upon k^ that I talk'd of it in my Sleep; 
in Ihort, nothing could remove it out of my Mind ; 
it even broke fo violently into all my Difcourfes, 
that it made my Converfation tirefome '•> for I could 
-talk of nothing elfe, all my Difcourfe run into it,' e- 
ven to Impertinence, and I faw it my felf. 

I have often heard Perfons of good Judgment fay. 
That all the Stir People make in the World about 
<jhofls and Apparitions, is owing to the Strength 
of Imagination, and the powerful Operation of Fan- 
cy in their Minds ; that there is no fuch Thing as a 
Spirit appearing, or a Ghoft walking, and the like % 
That Peoples poring aftedionately upon the part 
Converfation oi their deceased Friends, fo realizes 
it to them, that they are capable of fancying upon 
feme extraordinary Circumflances, that they fee 

them I 



[7] 



them ; talk to them, and are anfwered by them, 
when, in Truth, there is nothing but Shadow and 
Vapour in the Thing ; and they really know nothing 
of the Matter. 

For my Part, I know not to this Hour, whether 
there are any fuch Things as real Apparitions, Spe- 
ctres, or walking of People after they are dead, or 
whether there is any Thing in the Scorics they tell 
us of that kind, more than the Produd of Vapours, 
lick Minds, and wandring Fancies '■> But this Iknow, 
that my Imagination work'd up to fuc^ a Height, 
and brought me into fuch Excefs of Vapours, or 
what elfe I may call it, that I actually fuppos'dmy 
felf, oftentimes upon the Spot, at my old Caflle be- 
hind the Trees ; faw my old Spaniard, Fridays Fa- 
ther, and the reprobate Sailors I left upon the I- 
fland 'y nay, I fancy'd I taik'd with them, and look'd 
at them fo fteadily^ tho' I was broad awake, as at 
Pcrfons jufl before me ,* and this I did till I often 
frighted my felf wich the Images my Fancy reprefen- 
ted to me: One Time in my Sleep I had the Villa- 
ny of the three Pyrate Sailors, fo lively related to 
me by the firft Spaniard and Fridafs Father, that \t 
was furprisiing ; they told rtte how they barbarouily 
attempted to murder all the Spaniards, and that 
they let Fire to the Provilions they had laid upa 
on Purpbfe to diflrefs and ftarve them ; Things that 
I had never heard of, and that yet were all of them 
true in Fact : And it was fo warm in my Imagination, 
and fo realized tome, that to the Hour I fawthem, 
1 could not be perfuaded, but that it was or would 
be true; alfohow I refetited it, when the Spaniard 
complained to me, and how I brought them to Ju- 
. ftice, try*d them before me, and order'd them all 
three to be hang'd : What there was really in this^ 
fhall be feen in its Place : For however, I came to 
form fuch Things in my Dream, and what (ecrec 
Converfe of Spirits injected if, yet there was, Ifay^ 
very much of it true. I own, that this Dream h^A 
A 4 so: 



[8] 

nothing in It literally and fpecifically true; but the 
general Part was fo true, the bafe viilanious Beha- 
viour of thefe three hardened Rogues wasfuch^and 
had been fo much worfe than all I^can defcribe, that 
the Dream had too much Similitude of the Fad^, and 
as I would afterwards have punifhed them feverely; 
fo if I had hangM them all, I had been much in the 
Right, and (hould ha' been juflified both by the 
Laws of God and Man. 

But to return to my Story i in this Kind of Tem- 
per I had liv'd fome Years, I had no Enjoyment of 
my Lik, no pleafant Hours, no agreeable Diverfion, 
but what had fome Thing or other of this in it-, fo 
that my Wife, who faw my Mind fo wholly bent 
upon it, told me very ferioufly one Night, That fhe 
belie vM there was fome fecret powerful Impulfe of 
Providence upon me, which had determir/d me to 
thither again; and that diQ found nothing hindred 
my going, but my being engag'd to a Wife and 
Children. She told me, that it was true, fhecould 
not think of parting with me ; but as fhe Vv'as af- 
fur^'d, that if fhe was dead, it would be the firfl: 
Thing I would do : So as it feem'd to her, that 
the Thing was determin^'d above, fhe would not be 
the only Obflrudion: For if I thought fit, and re- 

folv'd to go here (he found me very intent upon 

her Words, and that I look'd very earneflly at her ; 
fo that it a little diforder'd her, and (he flopped. I 
ask'd her. Why fhe did not go on, and fay out what 
file was going to fay ? But I pereeiv^'d her Heart 
was to full, and fome Tears flood in her Eyes ; Speak 
out my Dear, faid I, Are you willing I fliould go ? 
No, fays fie, very affeBicnately, I am far from willing: 
But if you are refolv'd to go, fays fhe, and rather 
than I will be the only Hindrance, I will go with 
you 'y for tho' I think it a mofl prepofterous Thing^ 
for one of your Years, and in your Condition, yet if 
it muft, be, faid fhe again weeping, I won't leave 
you ; for if it be of Heaven, you muft do it. There 

is 



[9] 

is no refifting it -, and i^ Heaven makes it ybnr Duty 
to go, he will alfo make it mine to go with you, or 
otherwi(e djfpofe of me, that I may not obitrud: ico 

This aftedionate Behaviour of my WilVs brought 
me a iiitle out of tfie Vapours, and I began to con- 
lider what I was a doing j I correcfted my wandring 
Fancy, and began to argue with my felf fedately>3 
what Bufinefs I had after threefcore Years, and af- 
ter fuch a Life of tedious Sufferings and Difafters^. 
and clofed in fo happy and eafy a Manner, I fay, 
what Bufinefs I had to rufh into new Hazards, and 
put my felf upon Adventures, fit only for Youth and 
Poverty to run into* 

With thofe Thoughts, I confidered my new En- 
gagement, that I had a Wife, one Child born, and 
my Wife then great with ChiJd of another ^ that I 
had all the World could give me, and had no Need 
to feek Hazards for Gain ; that I was declining in 
Years, and ought to think rather of ieaving what I 
had gain'd, than of feekingto increafeit ; that as to 
what my Wife had faid, of its being an Impulfe 
from Heaven, and that it fhould be my Duty to go, 
I had no Notion of that ,• fo after many of thefe Co- 
gitations, I ftruggled with the Power of my Ima- 
gination, reafoii'd my (ch out of it, as I believe Peo- 
ple may alvjays do in like Cafes , if they imJI ; and, in a 
Word, I conquered it j composed my felf wirh {Mt 
Arguments as occur'd to my Thoughts, and which 
my prefent Condition furnifh'd me plentifully with, 
and parricularly, as the moft efednal Method, I re- 
folv'd to divert my felf with other Things, and to 
engage in feme Bufinefs that might efi-ectiially tye me 
up from any more Excurfions of this Kind; for I 
found that Thing retuinM upon me cl.iefly when I 
was idle, had nothing to do, or any Thing of Mo- 
ment immediately before me. 

To this Purpofe I bought a little Farm in the 
County of Bedford^ and refolv'd to remove my felf 
Ihither. I had a iitcls convenient Houfe upon it^ 

and. 



fio] 

and the Land about it I found was capable of g'feat 
Improvement, and that ic was many Ways fuited 
to my Inclination, which delighted in Gultivatingj 
Managing, Plaicing and Improving of Land j and 
patciCLilarly, being an Inland Country, I was remov'd 
from converfing among Ships, Sailors, and Things 
relating to the remote Part of the World. 
. In a Word, I went down to my Farm, fettled my 
Family; bought me Ploughs, Harrows, a Cart, Wa- 
gon, Horfes, Cows, Sheep; and fetting ferioufly to 
Work, became in one half Year, a meer Country 
Gentleman^ my Thoughts were intirely taken up in 
managing m.y Servants, cultivating the Ground, En- 
clofing, Planting, 2!7c. and I liv'd, as I thought,- the 
moft agreeable Lik that Nature was capable of di- 
fefting, or that a Man always bred to Misfortunes 
was capable of being retreated to. 

I hvm'd upon my own Land, I had no Rent td 
pay, was limited by no Articles ,• I could pull up or 
cut down as I pleafed : What I planted, was for my 
felF, and what 1 improved, was for my Family ; and 
having thus left of the Thoughts of Wandring, I 
had not the leaft Difcombrt in any Part of Life, as 
to this World. Now 1 thought indeed, that I en- 
joy 'd that middle State of Life, which m^. Father 
fo earneftly recommended to me: A kind of heavenly 
Life, fomething like what is defcribed by the Poet 
upon the Subjecr of a Country Life. 

Free frorn Vices y free from Care, 

Age ha6 no Paln^ and Touth no Snare, 

But i'^ the Middle of all this Felicity, one" Blow 
fromunfecn Providence unhing'd me at on^e; and 
not only made a Breach upon me inevitable, and in- 
curable ; but drove me, by its Conlequence, upon a 
deep Rdapfe into the wandring Difpofition; which, 
as I may lay, being born in my very Blood foon re- 
covered is hold of me, and like the Returns of a vio- 
lent 



[ II ] 

lent Diflemper, came on with an irrefiftible Force 
upon me '•> lo that nothing could make any more 
ImprefTion upon me. This Blow was the Lofs of my 

Wife. .:.•:•:•: . 

It is not my Bufinefs here to write an Elegy up^oa 
my Wife, give a Chara^Ster of her particular Virtulsji 
and make my Court to the Sex by the Flattery of a 
Funeral Sermon, She was, in a few Words, the' " 
Stay of all my Affair, the Center of all my Enter- 
prizes ; the Engine, that by her Prudence reduc'd me 
to that happy Compafs I was in, from the mofi: ex- 
travagant and ruinous Projed that fluttered in my 
Head, as above ; and did more to guide my ram- 
bling Genius, than a Mother's Tears, a Father's In- 
ftrudions, a Friend's Counfel, or all my own reafon- 
ing Powers could do. 1 was happy in liftening to 
her Tears, and in being moved by her Entreaties^ 
and to the laft Degree defolate and difloeated in the 
World by the Lofs of her. . 

When {he was gone, the World looked arukwardly 
round me , I was as much a Stranger in it, in my 
Thoughts, as I was in the Brajils^ when I went firft 
on Shore there i and as much alone, except as to the 
AlTillance of Servants, as I was in my Ifland. I knew 
neither what to do, or what not to do. I faw the 
World bufy round me, one Part labouring for Bread, 
and the other Part fquandring it, in vile Excefles or 
empty Pleafures, equally miferable, becaufe the End 
they proposed ftill Hed from them , for the Men of 
Pleafure every Day furfeited of their Vice, and 
heaped up Work for Sorrow and Repentance \ and 
the Men of Labour fpent thei'r Strength in daily 
Strugglings for Bread to maintain the vital Strength 
they laboured with^ fo living in a daily Circulation 
of Sorrow, living but to work, and working but to 
live, as il daiiy Bread where the only End of -vvear. 
rifome Life, and a wearifome Life the only Occalioa 
of daily Breado 

This 



[12- ] 



This put me in Mind of the Life I lived in my 
Kingdom, the Ifland ; where I fufferM no more 
Corn to grow, becaufe I did not want it ; and bred 
no more Goats, becaufe I had no more Ufe for 
them : Where the Money lay in the Drawer ^till it 
grew ill dew'd, and had fcarce the Favour to be 
look'd upon in 20 Years. 

All thefe Things, had I improv'd them as I ought 
to have done, and as Reafon and Reh'gion had dicta- 
ted to me, would have taught me to fearch farther 
than hum.an Enjoyments for a full Felicity, and that 
there was fomething which certainly was the Reafon 
and End of Life, fuperiour to all thefe Things, and 
which was either to be pollefs^'d, or at leaft hop^d 
for on this Side the Grave. 

But my Sage Co un (el lor was gone ; I was like a 
Ship without a Pilots that could only run afore the 
Wind : My Thoughts run all away again into the 
old Afr'air ', my Head was quite turn'd with the 
Whimlles of foreign Adventures, and all the plea- 
fant innocent Amufements of my Farm, and my 
Garden, my Cattle, and my Family, which before 
entirely pofl-eft me, were nothing to me ,* had no 
Relifti, and were like Muhck to one that has no Ear, 
or Food to one that has no Tafte : In a Word, 1 
refolv'dto leave off Houfe- keeping, lett my Farm, 
and return to London-^ and in a few Months after, I 
did fo. 

When I came to London^ I was flill as uneafy as I 
was before -, I had no ReliQi to the Place, no Employ- 
ment in it, nothing to do but to fauncer about like 
an idle Pcrfon, of whom it may be faid, he is per- 
fedly ufelefs in God's Creation, and it is not one 
Farthing Matter to the refl of his Kind, whether 
he be dead or alive. This alfo was the Thing, which 
of all Circumftances of Life was the moft my Aver- 
fion, who had been all my Days ufed to an a61rive 
Life; and I would often fay to my (tlf, A State cf 
Idknefs IS the very Dregs of Lije ; and indeed 1 thought 

I was 



[ 13 1 , 

I was much more fuitably em ploy 'd, when I was 
'26 Days a making me a Deal'Board. 

It was now the Beginning of the Year i"<5p5, when 
my Nephew, who as I have obfervd hefore^ I had 
brought lip to the Sea, and had made him- Comman- 
der of a Ship, was come Home from a (hort Voyage 
to Bilboay being the firfi: he had made : He came to 
me, and told me, that fome Merchants of his Ac- 
quaintance had been propofing to him to go a Voy- 
age for them to the Eafi-Indies and to Chmaj2LS private 
Traders : And now Uncle , fays he, if you will go to 
Sea with me^ V II engage to land you upon your old Hahi^ 
tation in the IJlandy for we are to touch at the Brajils, 

Nothing can be a greater Demonflration of a fu- 
ture State, and of :he Exigence of an inviiible World, 
than the Concurrence of fecond C aifes, with the 
Ideas of Things, which we form in our Minds, per- 
fedly referv^d, and not communicated to any in the 
World. 

My Nephew knew nothing how far my Diflem- 
per of wandring was returned upon me, and I knew 
nothing of what he had in his Thoughts to fay, 
when that very Morning before he came to me, I 
had in a great deal of Confufion of Thought, and 
revolving every Part of my Circumftances in my 
Mind, come to this Refolution, viz.. That I would 
go to Lisbon^ andconfult with my old Sea-Captain'; 
and fo if it was rational and pradicabJe, I would 
go and fee the Ifland again, and fee what was be- 
come of my People there. I had pleasM my felf 
with the Thoughts of peopling the Place, and car- 
rying Inhabitants from hence, getting a Patent for 
the Pofleflion, and I know not what \ when in the 
Middle of all this, in comes my Nephew, as I have 
faid, with his Projed of carrying me thither, in his 
Way to the Eaft-Indies. 

I paus'd a while at his Words, and looking fleadi- 
!y at him, IVhat Devil, faid l^ fent you of this unlucky 
prrand ? My Nephew flartl'd as if he had been 

frighted 



[ H] 



flighted at firft ,* but perceiving I was not much 
difpleafed with the Propofal, he recovered himfelf* 
I hope it may not be an unlucky Propofal, Sir^ fays 
he, I dare fay you would be pleas'd to fee your new 
Colony there, where you once reigned with more 
Felicity, than moll: of your Brother Monarchs in the 
World. 

Ill a Word, the Scheme hit fo exadly with my 
Teiiij^er, that is to fay, with the Prepoffeffion I was 
under, and of which I have faid fo much, that I told 
him in tew Words, if he agreed with the Merchants, 
I would go widi hi^m : But I told him, I would not 
promife lo go any farther than my own Ifland. Why 
SiVy fays he, you dont want to be left there again^ I hope ? 
Why, faid 1, can you not take me up again in jour Re- 
mn ? He told me, it could not be pollible to do fo, 
that the Merchants would never allow him to come 
tha: Way with a loaden Ship of fuch Value, it being 
a Month's Sail out of his Way, and might be three 
or four : Bejides, Sir, if I floould mi/carry, faid he, 
and not return at all, then you would be jufl reduced to 
the Condition you were in before^ 

This was very rational j but we both found out a 
Remedy for It, which was to carry a framed Sloop on 
board the Ship, which being taken in Pieces, and 
fliipp'd on board the Ship, might by the Helpof fpme 
Carpenters, who wc agreed to carry wirh us, be fet 
up again in the liland, and fini{li''d, fit to go to Sea in 
a few Days. 

I was not long refolving ; for indeed the Importu- 
nities of my Nephew join'd in, fo efi-edually with my 
Inclination, that nothing could bppofe me : On the 
other hand, my Wife being dead, 1 had no Body con- 
cern'd themfelves fo much for me, as to perfuade me 
one way or other, except my ancient good Friend the 
Widow, who earneftly ftruggled with me to confi- 
der my Years, my eafy Circumll;ances, and the need- 
lefs Hazards of a long Voyage ,• and above all my 
young Children ; But it was ail to no Purpofe^ I had 

an 



[15] 

„xi irrefiftible Defire to the Voyage ; and I told her, 
I thought there was (omething (o uncommon in the 
Impreflions I had upon my Mind for the Voyage, 
that it would be a kind of refilling Providence, it I 
{hould attempt to ftay at Home ; after which, fhe 
ceas'd her Expoftuladons, and join'd with me, not 
only in making Provition for my Voyage, but alfo 
in fettling my Family Aftairs for my Abfence, and 
providing for the Education of my Children. 

In Order to this, 1 made my Will, and fettled the 
Eftate I had, in fuch a Manner for my Children, and 
placed in fuch Hand^, that I was perfedly eafy and 
fatisfy'd they would have Juflice done them, what- 
ever might befal me ; and for their Education, I 
left it wholly to my Widow, with a fufficicnt Main- 
tenance to her felf for her Care ; Ail which fhe richly 
deferv'd ; for no Mother could have taken more Care 
in their Education, or underftood it better ; and as 
{he liv'd 'till I came Home, I alfo liv'd to thank her 
for it. 

My Nephew was ready to fail about the Beginning 
. of January i6p^'^, and I with my Man Friday wenc 
on board in the Downs the Sth, having belides that 
Sloop which I mention'd above, a very confiderable 
Cargo of all Kinds of neceffary Things for my Co- 
lony, which if I did not iind in good Condition, I 
refolvM to leave fo. 

Firfl, I carryM with me fome Servants, who I pur- 
posed to place there, as Inhabitants, or at leafl to 
fet on Work there upon my own Account while I 
ftay'd, and either to leave them there, or carry them 
forward as they fhould appear willing ; particularly, 
I carry 'd two Carpenters, a Smith, and a very handy 
ingenious Fellow, who was a Cooper by Trade but 
was alfo a general Mechanick ; for he was dextrous 
at making Wheels, and Hand-Miiis to grind Corn, 
was a good Turner, and a good Pot-Maker , he 
alfo made any Thing that was proper to make of 
Earth, or of Wood j in a Word^ we caifd him Our 
JackoJaH Trades. With 



[ 16] 

With thefe I carry 'd a Taylor, who had offer'd

Nephew, but afterwards confented to flay on our 
New Plantation, and prov'd a moft neceflary handy 
Fellow, as could be dehr'd, in many other Bufineffes, 
beiides, beiides that of this Trade ; for as I obferv'd 
formeny, Necefficy arms us for all Employments. 

My Cargo, as near as I can colled, for I have not 
kept an Account of Particulars, confifted of a fuiH- 
cient Quantity of Linnen, andfome thin Engli(Io Stufts 
fpr cloathing the Spaniards that I expeded to find 
there, and enough of them, as by my Calculation 
might comfortably fupply them for i^wQn Years ; if 
1 remember right, the Materials which I carry 'd 
for cloathing them, with Gloves, Hats, Shoes, Stock" 
ings, and all fuch Things as they could want for 
wearing, amounted to above 200 Pounds, including 
fome Beds, Bedding, and Houfliold- Stuff, particu- 
larly Kitchen- UtenfiJs, with Pots, Kettles, Peuter, 
Brafs, &c* befides , near a hundred Pounds more in 
Iron- Work, Nails, Tools of every Kind, Staples, 
Hooks Hinges, and every necelfary Thing I could 
ihink of. 

Icarry'dalfo an hundred fpare Arms Muskets, and 
Fuzees, beddes fome Piftols , a coniiderable Qtian- 
tity of Shot of ail Sizes three or four Ton of Lead, 
and two Pieces of Brafs Cannon ; and becaufe I knew 
not what Time, and what Extremities I was provi- 
ding for, I carry'd an hundred Barrels of Powder, 
befides Swords, and Cutlafies, and the Iron Part of 
fome Pikes, and Halberts, fo that in fhort, we had 
a large Magazine of all Sorts of Stores i and I made 
my Nephev/ carry two fmall Quarter- Deck Guns 
more than he wanted for his Ship, to leave behind, 
ii their was Occafion y. that when we came there, 
we might build a Fort, and man it againft all Sons of 
Enemies : And indeed, I at firfl thought there wcuid 
be Need enough for it all, and much more, if we 
hop'd to maintain our Pofiefiion of the liland, as fliall be 
be fcen in the Courfe of that Story. 1 had

I had not fiich bad Luck in this Voyage^ as I had 
been ufed to meet with ; and therefore fhalJ have the 
lefs Occafion to interrupt the Reader, who perhaps 
may be impatient to hear how Matters went with 
my Colony ; yet feme odd Accidents^ crofs Winds, 
and bad Weather happened, on this firfl: fetting out, 
which made the Voyage longer than I expeded it at 
firft ; and I who had never made but one Voyage, 
(viz,.) my firfl Voyage to Guinea^ in which I might be 
faid to come back again, as the Voyage was at iirft 
deiign'd, began to think the fame ill Fate flill attend- 
ed me; and that I was born to be never contented 
with my own Shore, and yet to be always unfortu- 
nate at Sea. 

Contrary Winds firfl put us to the Northward, and 
we were obliged to put in at Galway m Ireland, where 
we lay Wind-bound two and twenty Days j but we 
had this Satisfaction with the Difafter, that Provi- 
fions where here exceeding cheap, and in the utmoft 
Plenty *, fo that while we Jay here, we never touched 
the Ship's Scores, but rather added to them ; here 
alfo I took feveral Mvq Hogs, and two Cows with 
their Calves, which I refolv'd, ii I had a good Paf- 
fage, to put on Shore in my Kiand, but we found 
Occafion to difpofe otherwife ot them. 

We fet out the 5 th of February from Ireland and 
had a very fair Gale of Wind for fome Days ; as I 
remember, is might be about the 20th ot Felruary'm 
the Evening late, when the Mate having the Watch^i. 
came into the Round-houfe, and told us, he faw a 
Flafii of Fire, and heard a Gunfir'd, and while he 
was telling us of it, a Boy came in, and told us the 
Boatfwain heard another. This made us all run out; 
upon the Quarter- Deck, where for a while we heard 
nothing, but in a few Minutes we faw a very great 
Light, and found that there was fome very terrible 
Fire at a Diftance j immediately we had recourfe to 
our Reckonings, in which we all agreed, that there 
could be no Land that Wav, in which the Fire 

B aew'd 



fliew*d it felfi no not for 500 Leagues, for ft appear^ 
at W. N. W. Upon this we concluded, it mufl be 
fome Ship on Fire at Sea ; and as by our hearing the 
Noife of Guns juft before, we concluded it could not 
be far off: We ilood diredly towards it, and were 
prefently fatisfy'd i^e (hould difcover it, becaufe the 
farther we faii'd, rhe greater the Light appeared tho' 
the Weather being haizy, we could not perceive any 
Thing but the Light for a while ; in about half an 
Hour's Sailing, the Wind being fair for us, tho' not 
much of it, and the Weather clearing up a little, we 
could plainly difcern that it was a great Ship on fire 
in the Middle of ti.e Sea. 

I was moll: fennbly rouch'd with this Difafter tho'' 
not at all acquainted with the Perfons engag'd in it ; 
1 prefently recoUeded my former Circuraflances, in 
what Condition I was in, v/hen taken up by the 
Portugal C2.pta,m ; and how much more deplorable the 
Circumflancesof the poor Creatures belonging to this 
Ship muft be, if they had no other Ship la Company 
with them : Upon this, I immediately crder'd, that 
five Guns fliould be fir'd, one foon after another^ 
that, if poffible, wemighcgiveNotice to them, that 
there was Help for them at hand, and that they 
m;ght endeavour to fave themfelves in their Boat 5 
for tho' we could fee the Flame of rhe Ship, yet they, 
it being Night, could fee nothing of us. 

We lay by (ome Time upon this, only driving as 
the burning Ship drove, waiting for Day light; 
when en a {addcn, to our great Terror, though we 
had Reafon to expect ic, the Ship blew up in the 
Air; and immediately, that is to fay, in a few Mi- 
nutes, all the Fire was out, that is to fay, the reft 
of the Ship fimk: This was a Terrible, and-indeed 
an afHiding Sight, for the ^ake of the podt^Men, 
who, I concluded, mud be either all deflroy^d in the 
Ship, or be i\i the utmoft Diflrefs in their Boat in the 
•Middle of the Oi-ean, which at prefent, by Reafon 
itwasdvirk, I could not lee However, to direa.

them as well as I could, Icaufed Lights to be hung 
t)uc it ail the Parts of the Ship where we could, and 
which we had Lanthorns for, and kept firmg Guns 
all the Night long, letting them know by this, that 
there was a Ship not far off. 

About 8 Clock in the Morning we difcoverM the 
Ship's Boats by the Help of our Perfpeftive GlafTes, 
found there were two of them, both throng'd with 
People, and deep in the Water : We perceived they 
row*d, the Wind being againfl: them, that they faw 
our Ship, and did the utmoft to make us fee them. 

We immediately fpread our Antient to let them 
know we faw them, and hung a Waft out as a Signal 
for them to come on Board, and then made more 
Sail, (landing diredly to them. In little more than 
half an Hour we came up with them, and in a word, 
took them all in, being no lefs than fixty four Men, 
Women, and Children j for there were a great many 
PafTengers* 

Upon the whole, we found it was a French Mer» 
chant Ship of 300 Tun, homeward bound from Que- 
heck, in the River of Canada. The Mafter gave us 
a long Account of the Diftrefs of his Ship, how the 
Fire began in the Steerage by the Negligence of the 
Steerfman s but 00 his crying out for Help, was, as 
every Body thought, entirely put out : But they 
foon found, that fome Sparks of the firfl Fire had 
gotten into fome Parr of the Ship, fo difficult to 
come at, that they could not effectually quench it ; 
and afterward getting in between the Timbers, and 
within the Ceiling of the Ship, it proceeded into the 
Hold, and maffer^d all the Skill, and all the Appli- 
cation they were able to exert. 

They had no more to do then, but to get into 
their Boats, which to their great Comfort were pret- 
ty large, being their Long-Boat, and a great Shal-" 
}oup, belides a fmall Skiff which was of no great 
Service to them, other than to get fome frefli Water 
and Provifions into her, after they had fecur'd their 

B s Lives 



[10] 

Lives from the Fire. They had indeed fmall Hope 
of their Lives by getting into to thefe Boats at 
that Diftance from any Land, only as they faid well, 
that they were efcap^d from the Fire, and had aPof- 
fibility that fome Ship might happen to be at Sea, 
and might take them in. They had Sails, Oars, 
and a Compafs, and were preparing to make the befl 
of their Way back to Newfound-land, the Wind 
blowing pretty fair, for it blew aneafy Gale at S. E. 
by E. They had as much Providons and Water, as 
with fparing it fo as to be next door to flarving, 
might fupport them about 12, Days; in which, if 
they had no bad Weather, and no contrary Winds, 
the Captain faid, he hopM he might get the Banks of 
Newfound- land, and might perhaps take fome Fifli to 
fuftain them till they might go on Shore. But there 
were fo many Chances againfl them in all thefe Cafes ; 
fuch as Storms to overfet and founder them ,* Rains 
and Cold to benumb and perifn their Limbs 5 contra- 
^ Winds to keep them out and ftarve them ; that it 
mufl have been next to miraculous if they had efcapM. 

In the midft of their Con ful rations^ every one being 
hopelefs, and ready to defpair, the Captain with 
Tears in his Eyes told me, they were on a fudden 
furpriz'd with the Joy of hearing a Gun fire, and 
after that four more j thefe were the five Guns, which 
I caufed to be fired at firfl feeing the Light : this 
revived their Hearts, and gave them the Notice, 
which, as above, I defir'd it fhould, (viz,.) that there 
was a Ship at hand for their Help. 

It was upon the hearing thefe Guns, that they 
took down their Mafls and Sails ; the Sound coming 
from the Windward, they refolv'd to lie by till Morn- 
ing. Some Time after this, hearing no more Guns, 
they fir'd three Muskets, one a confiderable While 
after another ; but thefe, the Wind being contrary, 
we never heard. 

Some Time after that again, they were Rill more 
agreeably furpriz'd with feeing our Lights, and hear- 
ing 



[il ] 



ing the Guns, which as I have fald, I caus'd to be 
fir'd all the reft of the Night ; this fet them to work 
with tlicir Oars to keep their Boats a-head, at leaft, 
thar we mighc the fooner come up with them ,* and 
at laft, to their inexprelTible Joy, they found we 
faw them. 

It is impofTible for me to exprefs the feveral Ge- 
flures, the ftrauge Extalies, the Variety of Poflures 
which thefc poor delivered People run into, to ex- 
prefs the Joy of their Souls at fo unexpeded a Deli- 
verance ; Grief and Fear are eaiily described ; Sighs, 
Tears, Groans, and a very few Motions of the 
Mead and Hands made up the Sum of its Variety : 
But an Excels of Joy, a Surpize of Joy has a Thou- 
fand Extravagancies in it ; there were fome in Tears 5 
fome raging and tearing themfelves, as if they ha4 
been in the greatefl Agonies of Sorrow^ fome ftark^ 
raving and down-right Lunatick j fome ran about 
the Ship flamping with their Feet, others wringing 
their Hands ; fome were dancing, fome (inging, 
fome laughing, more crying ; many quite dumb, not 
able to fpeak a Word ; others fick and vomiting, fe- 
veral (wooning, and ready to faint ; and afew^ were 
Croiling themfelves, and giving God Thanks. 

I would not wrong them neither j there might be 
many that were thankful afterward, but the Paffion 
was too flrong for them at firft, and they were not 
able to mafler it, they were thrown into Extafiesand 
a kind of Frenzy, and fo, it was but a very few that 
were compos'd and ferious in their Joy. 

Perhaps alfo the Cafe may have fome Addition to 
it, from the particular Circumftance of that Nation 
they belonged to, I mean the French ; whofe Tempet 
is allow 'd to be more volatile, more paflionate, and 
more fprightly, and their Spirits more fluid than in 
other Nations. I am not a Philofopher enough to 
determine the Caufe, but nothing I had ever feen be- 
fore came up to it : The Extaiies poor Friday^ m^ 
4Yufi^ Savage^ was in when he^uud his Father in the 

B 3 Boa^j, 




[ u ] 

Boat, came the neareft to it, and the Surprize of the 
Ivlafter and his two Companions, who I delivered 
from the Villains that fet them on Shore in the Ifland^ 
came a little Way towards it, but nothing was to 
compare to this, either that I faw in Friday y or any 
where elfe in my Life. 

Ic is further obfervable, that thefe Extravagan- 
cies did not fhew themfelves in that different Manner 
I have mentioned, in different Perfons only ; But all 
the Variety would appear in a fhort SuccefTion o£ 
Moments in one and the fame Perfon. A Man that 
we faw this Minute dumb, and as it were ftupid 
and confounded fhould the next Minute be dancing 
and hallowing like an Antick ; and the next Moment 
be tearing his Hair, or pulling his Clothes to Pieces, 
and ftamping them under his Feet, like a mad Man ; 
a few Moments after that, we fhould have him all in 
Tears, then fick, then fwooning ; and had not imme- 
diate Help been had, would, in a few Moments more 
have been dead ,• and thus it was not with one or 
two, or ten or twenty, but with the greateft Part of 
them ; and if I remember right, our Surgeon was ob- 
lig'd to let above thirty of them Blood. 

There were two Priefls among them, one an old 
Man, and the other a young Man ,• and that which 
was ftrangeft was, that the oldeft Man was the worfl. 

As foon as he fet his Foot on board our Ship, and 
faw himfelf fafe, he dropt down flone-dead, to all Ap- 
pearance, not the leafl Sign of Life could be per- 
ceiv'd in him ', our Surgeon immediatly apply'd proper 
Remedies to recover him, and was the only Man in 
the Ship that believ'd he was not dead ,• sit length he 
open'd a Vein in his Arm, having firfl: chaff'd and 
rubb'd the Part fo as to warm it as much as pofTible: 
Upon this the Blood vyhich only dropped at firft, 
flow'd fomething freely ; in three Minutes after, the 
Man open'd his Eyes, and about a quarter of an Hour 
after that he fpgke, grew better, and in a little 

Time 



Time quite well ; after the Blood was flopp'd he , 
walk'd about, told us he was perfc<5ily wel], took a 
Dram of Cordial which the Surgeon gave him, and 
was what we call'd, Come to himfe/j; about a quarter 
of an Hour aftqr this, they came running inro the 
Cabin to the Surgeon, who w^s bleeding a 'French 
Woman, that had fainted ; and told him, the Piieft 
was gone fiark-mad ; it fcems he had begun to re- 
volve the Change of his Circumftance m his Mind, 
^nd this put him into an Extafy oi: Joy, his Spirits 
whirl'd about fader than the Veffels could convey 
them *, the Blood grew hot and feverifl), and the 
Man was as fit for Bedlam, as any Creature that e- 
ver was in it : The Surgeon would not bleed him 
again in that Conaition, but gave him fomething to 
dole and put him to fleep, which after feme Time 
operated upon him, and he wak'd the next Morning 
perfedly composed, and well. 

The younger Prieft behavM with great Command 
of his PalTion, and was really an Example of a fe- 
rious well-govern'd Mind; at h s firfl coming on 
board the Ship, he threw himfelt flat on his Face, 
proftrating himfelf in Thankfulnefs for4iis Deliver- 
ance ^in which I unhappily and unfeafonably diflurb'd 
him, really thinking he had been in a Swoon; but he 
fpake calmly, thankM me ,• told me, he was giving 
God Thanks for his Deliverance; begg'd me to leave 
him a few Moments, and that, next to his Maker, he 
would give me Thanks alfo. 

1 was heartily forry, that I difturb'd him, and not 
only left him, but kept others from interrupting him 
alfo ; b.e continued in that Pofture about three Mi^ 
nutes, or little more, after I left him, then came to 
me, as he had faid he would, and with a great deal of 
Serioufnefsand Affedion, but with Tears in his Eyes 
thank'd me that had under God, given him and fo 
many mlferable Creatures their Lives : I told him, I 
had no Room to move him to thank God for it, rather 
than me : For I had feeq that he had done that already : 

B 4 But 



[H] 



Butladdedy That it Was nothing but what' Reafon 
and Humanity didated to all Men, and that we had 
^s much Reafon as he to give Thanks to God, who 
had bkfb'd us fo far as to make us the Inftruments of 
his Mercy to fo many of his Creatures. 

After this, the young Priefl apply'd himfelf to his 
Country- Folks, labour'd to compofe them*$ petfwad- 
ed, entreated, argued, reafon 'd with them, and did his 
utmoft to keep them within the Exercife ot their Rea- 
fon ; and with fome he had Succefs, tho' others were 
for a Time out of all Government of themfelves. 

I cannot help committing this to Writing5as perhaps 
It may be ufeful tothofe into whofe Hands it may fall, 
in the guiding themfelves in all the Extravagances of 
their Paflions ; for if an Excefs of Joy can carry Men 
out to fuch a Length beyond the Reach of their Rea- 
fon, what will not the Extravagances of Anger, Rage, 
and a provok'd Mind carry us to? and indeed here I 
faw Reafon for keeping an exceeding Watch over out 
PalTions of every Kind, as well thofe of Joy and Satif- 
fadion, as thofe of Sorrow and Anger. 

We werefomethingdifordered by thefe Extravagan- 
ces among our new Guefls for the firff Day ; but when 
they had been retirM, Lodgings provided for them as 
wellas our Ship would allow, and they had flept hear^- 
tily, as moft of them did, being fateagu'd and frighted 
they were quite another Sort of People the next Day. 

Nothing of good Manners or civil Acknowledg- 
ments for the Kindnefs (hewn them was wanting ; the 
French^ 'tis known, are naturally apt enough to exceed 
that Way : The Captain and one of the Prieft came to 
me the next Day, and defiring tofpeak with me and my 
Nephew, the Commander, began to confuit with us 
"whatflaould be done with them ; and firfl: they told iis, 
that as we had faved their Lives, fo all they had was 
little enough for a Return to us for that Kindnefs re- 
ceived. The Captain faid, they had laved fome Mo- 
ney and fome Things of Value in their Boats, catch^d 
fc^flily ouc of the Flamgs, and it we would accept it, 

thev 



[15] 

they were ordered to make an Otfer ft all to ns ; thef 
only defired to be fee on Shore Tome where in our 
Way, where if poffible they might gee Pafl'age to France, 

My Nephew was for accepting their Mony at fir ft 
Word, and to conilder what to do with them after- 
wards ; but I over-rul'd him in that Part, for 1 knew 
what it was to be fet on Shore in a flrange Country ; 
and if the Portugal Captain, that took me up at Sea 
had ferv'd me fo, and took all I had for my Deliver- 
ance, I muft have (tarv'd, or have been as much a 
Slave at the Bvafils as I had been in Barbary^ the be- 
ing fold to a Mahometan only excepted ; and perhaps 
a Portuguefe is not much a better Mafter than a l^urk^ 
if not in fome Cafes a much worfe. 

1 therefore told the French Captain that we had ta- 
ken them up in their Diflrefs, it was true; but that 
it was our Duty to do fo as we were Fellow-Crea- 
tures, and as we would defire to be fo delivered if 
we were in the like or any other Extremity ; that we 
had done nothing for them but what we believed they 
would have done for us, if we had been in their 
Cafe, and they in ours j but that we took them up 
to fave them, not to plunder them ; and it would 
be a mcfl barbarous Thing to take that little from 
them which they had faved out of theFire, and then 
fet them on Shore and leave them ; that this would 
be firft to fave them from Death, and then kill them 
our felves ,• fave them from drowning, and abandon 
them toflarving,* and therefore i would not let the 
leafl thing be taken fiom them: As to letting them 
on Shore, I told them indeed, that was an exceeding 
Difficulty to us, for that the Ship was bound to the 
Eaft' Indies ; and tho"* we were driven out of our 
Courfe to the Weft ward a very great Way, and per- 
haps was direded by Heaven on purpofe for their De- 
liverance, yet it was impoffible for us wilfully to 
change our Voyage on this particular Account ; nor 
could my Nephew, the Captain, anfwer it to the 
Freighters, with whom he was under Charter-Party 



I 16-] 

to piirftie his Voyage by the Way of Brafil, and all I 
knew we could do for them, was to put our felves 
in the Way oF meering with other Ships homeward 
bound from the l^^'eft Indies^ and get them Pailage, if 
polTible, to England or France. 

The firft Pare of the Propofal was fo fo generous 
and kind, they could not but be very thankful for 
it > but they were in a very great Confternation, ef- 
pecially che Paflengers, at the Notion of being car- 
ry M away to the Eafl Indies ; they then in treated me, 
that feeing I was driven fo far to the Weftward, be- 
fore I met with them, I would at leaft keep on the 
fame Courfe to the Banks of Newfound^ Land y 
where it was probable I might meet with fome Ship 
or Sloop that they might hire to carry them back 
to Canada^ from whence they came. 

I thought this was but a reafonable Requeft on 
their Pare, and therefore I inclined to agree to it ; 
for indeed I confider'd, that to carry this whole Com- 
pany to the Ea&' Indies y would not only be an into^ 
ierable Severity upon the poor People, but would be 
ruining our whole Voyage by devouring all our Pro- 
vifions ; fo I thought it no Breach of Charter-Party^ 
but what an unforefeen Accident made abfolutely 
Deceffary to us, and in which no one could fay we 
v/ere to blame ; for the Laws of God and Nature 
would have forbid that we fhould refufe to take up 
two Boats full of People in fuch a diftrefs'd Condi- 
tion, and the Nature of the Thing as well refpeft- 
ing our felves as the poor People, obh'g'd us to fet 
them on Shore fome where or other, for their Deli- 
verance ; fo I confented that we would carry them 
to Newfound- Landy if Wind and Weather would per- 
mit, and if not, that I would carry them to Marti" 
nico in the Wefi- Indies, 

The Wind continued frefh Eafterly, but the Wea- 
ther pretty good, and as it had blowed continually 
in the Points between N. E. and S. E. a long time, 
we mifled feveral Opportunities of fending them to ^

prance ; for we met feveral Ships bound to Europe, 
whereof two were French from St. Chrifiopher's, but 
they had been fo long beating up againft the Wind, 
that they durfl take in no Pafl'engers for fear of 
wanting^ Provifions for the Voyage, as well for 
themlelves as tor thofe they fhould take in i fo we 
were obliged to go on* It was about a VVeek after 
this that we made the Banks of Newfound- Land y 
where, to (horten my Story, we put all our French 
People on Board a Bark, which they hir'd at Sea 
there, to put them on Shore, and afterwards to car- 
ry them to py^nce, if they could gee Provilion ro vi- 
ctual themfelves with : When, I fay, all the French 
went on Shore, 1 fhould remember that the young 
Prieft I fpoke of, hearing we were bound to the Eafi- 
Indies, defired to go the Voyage with us, and to be 
fet on Shore on the Coafl of Coromandel : I readily 
agreed to that, for I wonderfully lik'd the Man, and 
had very good Reafon, as will appear afterwards ; 
alfo four of the Seamen entered themfelves on our 
Ship, and proved very ufeful Fellows. 

From hence, we direded our Courfe for the Wefi- 
Indies, fleering away S. and S. byE. for about 20 
bays together, fometimes little or no Wind at all, 
when we met with another Subjed for our Humanity 
to work upon, almoft as deplorable as that before. 

It was in the Latitude of 27 Degrees 5 Minutes 
N. and the i^th Day of March 16^4-5, when we 
^fpy'd a Sail, our Courfe S. E. and by S. We foon 
perceiv'd it was a large Veffel, and that flie bore up 
to us, but could not at firfl: know what to make of 
her, till after coming a little nearer, we found (he 
had loft her Main top-maft, Fore-maft and Boltfprit, 
and prefently fhe fired a Gun as a Signal of Diftrefs ; 
the Weather was pretty good. Wind at N< N. W. a 
frefh Gale, and we foon came to fpeak with her. 

Wf found her a Ship of Briflol, bound home from 
Barhadoes, but had been blown out of the Road at 
Barhdoes a few Days before flie was ready to fail, by 

ater« 



[i8] 



a terrible Hurricane, while the Captain and Chief- 
Mate were both gone on Shore ; (o that, befide the 
Terror of the Storm, they were but in an indi&renc 
Cafe for good Artifts to bring the Ship home : They 
had been already nine Weeks at Sea, and had met 
with another terrible Storm after the Hurricane was 
over, which had blow them quite out of their 
Knowledge to the Weftward, and in which they loft 
their Mafts, ^ above ; they told us they expeded to 
have feen the Bahama Ifiands, but were then driven 
away again to the South-Eaft by a flrong Gale of 
Wind at N. N. W. the fame that blew now, and ha- 
ving no Sails to work the Ship with but a Main- 
Courfe, and a kind of fquare Sail upon a Jury-Foce- 
Mafl, which they had fet up, they couid not lye 
near the Wind, but were endeavouring to Hand away 
for the Canaries. 

But that which was worft of all, was, that they 
werealmolt flarv'd for want of Prvifions, beiides the 
Fatigues they had undergone j their Bread and Flefh 
was quite gone, they had not one Ounce left in the* 
Ship, and had none for ii Daysj the only Relief 
they had, was, their Water was not all fpenr, and 
they had about half a Barrel of Flower left ; they had 
Sugar enough ; fomeSuccades or Sweet-meats they 
had at iirft, but they were devourM, and they had 
feven Casks of Rum. 

There was a Youth and his Mother and a Maid- 
Servant on Bo;ard, who were going Paflengers, and 
thinking the Ship was ready to fail) unhappily came 
on Board the Evening before the Hurrie.*ne began, 
and having no Provifions of their own left, they 
were in a more deplorable Condition than the refl, 
for the Seamen being reduced to fuch an extreme 
KecefTity themfelves, had no Compaflion, we may be 
fure, for the poor Paffengers^ and they were indeed m 
a Condition that their Mifery is very hard to defcribe. 

I had, perhaps, not known this Part, if my Curio- 
fity had not led nie, the Weather being faii: and the 

Wind 



[^9 3 



wind abated, to go on Board the Ship : The Second 
Mate who upon this Occahon commanded the Ship^ 
had been on Board our Ship, and he told me indeed, 
that they had three Pafl'engers in the great Cabin, 
that they were in a deplorable Condition ,* nay^ 
fays he, I believe they are dead, for I have heard 
nothing of them for above two Days,* and I Was a- 
fraid to enquire after them, faid he, for I had no- 
thing to relieve them with. 

We immediately apply 'd our felves to give them 
what Relief he could fpare -, and indeed I had fo 
far over- ruled Things with my Nephew, that I 
would havevi(5luaird them, tho" we had gone away 
to Virginia^ or any Part of the Coafl: of Amerkay to' 
have fupply'd our felves j but there was no Nece- 
llity for that. 

But now they were in a new Danger; for they 
were afraid of eating to much, even of that little 
we gave them i the Mate or Commander brought 
fix Men with him in his Boat, but thefe poor 
Wretches look'd like Skeletons, and were fo weak, 
they could hardly fit to their Oars: The Mate 
himfelf was very ill, and half ftarved 5 for he declared 
he had referv'd nothing from theMen, and went Share 
and Share alike with them, in every Bit they eat. 

I cautioned him to ^eat-{paringly, but fet Meat be- 
fore him immediatel}^ and he had not eaten three 
Mouthfu Is before he began to be Sick, and out of 
Order; foheftopM awhile, and our Surgeon mix'd 
him up fomething with fome Broath, which he faid 
would be to him both Food and Phyfick ; and after 
he had taken it, he grew better : In the mean Time, 
I forgot not the Men ; I order'd Viduals to be gi- 
ven them, and the poor Creatures rather devoured 
than eat it ; they were fo exceeding hungry, thac 
they were in a kind ravenous and had no Com- 
mand of themfelves ; and two of them eat with io 
much greedinefs, that they were in Danger of their 
ViVQs the next Morning, 

The 



r3o] 



The Sight of thefe Peoples Diflrefs was i^ery mov- 
ing to me, and brought to Mind what I had a ter- 
tible Profped of at my firfl coming on Shore in my 
Ifland, where I had never the leaft Mouthful oF Food^ 
or any Profped of procuring any ,* befides the hourly 
Apprehenlion I had of being made the Food oi other 
Creatures: But all the while the Mate was thus re- 
lating to me the miferable Condition of the Ship's 
Company, 1 could not put out of my Thought the 
Story he had told me of the three poor Creatures in 
the Great Cabin, (viz,.) the Mother, her Son, and 
the Maid-fervant, who he had heard nothing of for 
two or three Days ; and who he feem'd toconfefs they 
had wholly negieded, their own Extremities being 
fo great ,• by which I underftood, that they had real- 
ly given them no Food at all, and that therefore they 
muft be perifli'd, and be all lying dead perhaps on 
the Floor, or Deck of the Cabin. 

As I therefore kept the Mate, who we then called 
Captain, on board with his Men to refrefh them. 
fo I alfo forgot not the ftarving Crew that were left 
on board, but ordered my own Boat to go on board 
the Ship, and with my Mate and twelve Men to car- 
ry them a Sack of Bread, and four or five Pieccs of 
Beef to boil. Our Surgeon charg'd the Men to 
caufe the Meat to be boil'd while they liay'd, and 
to keep Guard in the Cook-Room, to prevent the 
Men taking it, to eat raw, or taking it out of the 
Pot before it was well boil'd, and then to give every 
Man but a very littleat aTime j and by this Cauti^ 
on he preierv'd the Men, who would otherwife ha^ 
killed themfelves, with that very Food that was gi- 
ven them on purpofe to fave their Lives. 

At the fame Time, I ordered the Mate to go into 
the Great Cabin, and fee what' Condition the poor 
Paflengers were in, and if tiiey were alive, to com- 
fort them, and give them what Refrefhment was pro- 
per ; and the Surgeon gave him a large Pitcher with 
fomeof the prepar'd Broth which he had given the 

Mate 



[31] 

Mate that was on Board, and wlu'ch he did not 
QLieftion would reftore them gradually. 

I was not fatisty'd with this, but as Ifaid above^ 
having a great Mind to fee the the Scene of Mifery^ 
which 1 knew the Ship itfelf would prefcnt me with, 
in a more lively Manner than I could have it by Re- 
port, I took the Captain of the Ship, as we now cal-^ 
I'd him, with me, and went myfelf a little after in 
their Boat* 

1 found the poor Men on board almoft in a Tumult 
to get the Vi6:uals out of the Boyler before it was 
ready: But my Mate obferv'd his Order, and kept 
a good Guard at the Cook-Room Door, and the 
Man he plac'd there, after ufmg all pofTible Per{wa- 
fion to have Patience, kept them off by Force 5 
However, he caufed fome Bisket Cakes to be dip- 
p'd in the Pot, and foften'd with the Lipuor of the 
Meat, which they call Brews, and gave them eve- 
ry one. One, to ftay their Stomachs, and told them 
it was for their own Safety that he was oblig'd t0 
give them but a little at a Time : But it was all in 
vain, and had I not come on board, and their own 
Commander and Officers with me, and with good 
Words, and fome Threats alfo of giving them no 
more, I believe they would have broke into thg 
Cook-Room by Force^ and tore the Meat out of the- 
Furnace : For Words are indeed of very fmall Force 
-to a hungry BelJy : However we pacify 'd them, and 
fed them gradually and cautioufly for the firft Time^' 
and the next Time gave them more, and at laft 
fiird their Bellies, and the Men did well enough. 

But the Mifery of the poor Paifengers in the Ca- 
bin, was of another Nature, and far beyond the reft ; 
for as firfly the Ship's Company had fo little foe 
themfeives, it was but too true that they had at firft 
kept them very low, and at laft totally neg- 
lected them 5 fo that for fix or feven Days, it might 
be faid, they had really had no Food at all, and 
for (everal Days before, very little. The poor Mo- 

ther^ 



ther, who as the firft Men reported, was a Woman of 
good Sence and good Breeding, had (par'd all (he 
could get, fo afeaionacely for her Son, that at laft 
fhe entirely funk under it: And when the Mate of 
our Ship went in, fhe fat upon the Floor or Deck, 
with her Back up againft the Sides, between two 
Chairs, which were "lafli'd faft, and her Head^funk 
in between her Shoulders, like a Corpfe, tho' not 
quite dead. My Mate faid all he could to revive 
and encourage her, and with a Spoon put fome Broth 
into her Mouth j (he oper/d her Lips, and lifted up 
one Hand, but could not fpeak ', yet Ihe underftood 
what he faid, and made Signs to him, intimating, 
that it was too late for her, but pointed to her Child, 
as if fhe would have faid, they fhould take Care of 
him. 

However the Mate, who was exceedingly mov d 
with the Sight, endeavoured to get fome of the Broth 
into her Mouth i and as he faid, got two or three 
Spooafuls down, tho' I queilion whether he could 
be fure o( it or not : But it v/as to late, and fhe dy'd 
the fame Night, . 

The Youth who was preferved at the Price of his 
moft affe61:ionate Mother's Lite, was not fo far gone, 
yet he lay in a Cabin-bed as one flretch'd out, with 
hardly any Life left in him, he had a Piece of an 
old Glove in his Mouth, having eaten up the refl ot 
it; however, being young, andliavmg more Strength 
than his Mother, ~ the Mate got fomething dowri 
his Throat, and he began fenlibly to revive, tho' 
by giving him fome Time after but two or three 
Spoonfuls extraordinary, he was very fick, and brought 

iz up again. . , /, , 

But tlie next Care was the poor Maid, ihe lay 
all along upon the Deck hard by her Miflrcfs, and. 
juft like one that had fallen down with an Apoplexy 
and ftruggled for Life: Her Limbs were diflortcd, 
one of her Hands was clafp'd round the Frame of a 
Chair, and fhe grip'd it fo hard, that we could not 

eatiljf; 



[JJ] 



feafily make her let go ; her other Arm lay over het 
Head, and her Feei lay both together fet faft againft 
the Frame of the Cabin Table ; in Hiort, flie lay juft 
like one in the laft Agonies of Death i and yet (he 
was alive too. 

The poor Creature was not only ftarvM withHun^ 
ger, and terrify 'd with the Thoughts of Death, but 
as the Men told u^ afterwards, was broken-hearted 
for her Miftt'efs, who fhe faw dying for two or three 
Days before, and who (he lov*d moft tenderly. 

We knew not what to do with this poor Girl, for 
when our Surgeon, who was a Man of very great 
Knowledge and Experience, had with great Appli- 
cation rtcover'd her as to Life ; he had her upon his 
Hand as to her Senfes, for (he was little lefs than di- 
flraded for a coniiderabfe Time after, as (hall appear 
prefently^ 

Whoever (hall read thefe Memorandums muft be de- 
fir'd toconlider, that Viiits at Sea are not like a Jour- 
ney into the Country, where fometimes People flay a 
Week or a Fortnight at a Piace. Our Budnefs was 
to relieve this diftreiled Ship^'s Crew, but not to lie 
by for them j and tho' they were willing to fleer the 
fame Courfe with us for fome Days yet we could 
carry no Sail to keep Pace with a Ship that had no 
Malls ; however, as their Captain begg'd of us to 
help him to fet up a Main- Top- Mad, and a kind of 
a Top Maft to his Jury Forc-Mafl. We did, as it 
were lie by himfortnree or four Days, and then hal- 
ving given hinn five Barrels of E^d^ a Barrel of Pork, 
two Hogllieads ofBisket, anda Proportion oF Peas^ 
Flour, and what ocher Things we could fpare ; and 
taking three Casks of Sugar, fon:ie Rum, and fome 
Pieces of Eight of them for Satisiadion, we left 
them,taking on board with us, at their own earneflRe- 
queft, theYouth, and the Maid, and all their Goods. 
The young Lad was about feventeen Years of Age, 
a pretty* well-bred modeft, and fenfible Youth ; 
greatly dejcded with the Lofs of his Mother, and. 
as it feems had loft his Father but a few Months be- 

C for^ 



[ 34 ] 

fore at Be-fhadoes^ He begg'd of the Surgeon t0 
{peak to me, to take him out of the Ship, for he 
faid the crue] Fellows had murther'd his Mother j 
and indeed fo they had, that is to fay pajjtvely ; for 
they might ha' fp.ar'd a fmall Suilenance to the poor 
helplefs Widow, that might have preferv'd her Life, 
though it had been but jufl: to keep her alive. But 
Hunger knows no Friend, no Relation, no Jufticej 
no Right, and therefore is remorfelefs, and capable 
of no Compaflion. 

The Surgeon told him how far we were going, 
and how it would carry him away from all his Friends, 
and put him perhaps in as bad Circumftanccs almoft 
as thofe we found him in -, that is to fay, flarving in 
the World. He faid he matter'd not whether he went, 
if he was but delivered fro#i the terrible Crew, that 
he was among : That the Captain ( by which he 
meant me, for he could know nothing of my Ne- 
phew) had fav'd his Life, and he was fure would not 
hurt him ; and as for the Maid, he was fure if (he 
came to heifelf, H^q would be very thankful for ir^ let 
us carry them where we would. The Surgeon repre- 
fented the Cafe fo aftedionately to me, that I yi^ld^d^ 
and we took them both en board with ail their 
Goods, except eleven Hogilieads of Sugar, which 
could not be removed or come at, and as the Youth 
had a Bill of Lad ng for them, I made his Com-* 
mander iign a Writing, obliging himfelf to go as 
foon as he came to BriJIofy to one Mr. Rogers a Mer- 
chant there, to whom the Youth faid he was related, 
and to deliver a Letter which 1 wrote to him, and 
all the Goods he had belonging to the d^cG2ikd Wi- 
dow ; which I fuppofe was not done, for I could ne- 
ver learn that the Ship came to Briflol, but was, as 
is mod probable, loft at Sea, being in fo difabled a 
Condition, and fo far from any Land,- that 1 am of 
Opinion, the firfl Storm fhe met with afterwards, 
fl;e might founder in the Sea, for fhe was leaky, and 
had Damage in, her Hold when we met with her.

i was how in the Latitude of ip Deg. 3 2 Min.and 
had hitherto had a tolerable Voyage as to Weather, 
though at firft the Winds had been contrary. I fiiall 
trouble no Body with the little Incidents of Wind, 
Weather, Currents, &c, on the reft of our Voyage ; 
but fhortning my Story for the fake of what is to 
follow, Ihall obferve that I came to my old Habita- 
tion, the Kland, on the lothof A^ril i6p^. It was 
with no fmall Diifieulty that I found the Place ; for 
as I came to ir, and went from it before, on the 
South and Eaft Side of the ifland, as coming from the 
Brafils, (o now coming in between the Main and the 
Ifland, and having no Chart for the Coaft, nor any 
Land- Mark, I did not know it when I faw it, or 
know wheiher I faw it ©r no. 

Wc beat about a great while, and went on Shore 
on feveral Illaods in the Moiith of the great River Oro- 
nooque^ bur none for my Purpofe. Only this I learned 
by my Coafling the Shore, that I was under one 
great Miftake before, 'viz,, that the Continent Lsch 
I thought I faw, from the Ifland Iliv'ci in, was : al- 
ly no Continent, but a long liland, or rather a H ige 
of Ilia, us, reaching from one to the other Side of 
the extended Mouth of that great River, and than 
the Savages who came to my Ifland, were not pro- 
perly thofe which we call Car-bheeSy but lllanders 
and other Barbarians of the fame Kind, who inhabi- 
ted (omething nearer to our Side than the reft- 

In ihorr, I vilited feveral of thefe Iflands to no 
Purpofe y fome I found were inhabiied, and fome 
were not. On one ot them I ioun^^om^ Spaniards^ 
and thought they had iiv*d there, but fpeaking with 
then[i, found they had a Sloop lay in a fmall Creek 
hard by, and they came thither to make Salt, and to 
tatch fome Pearl Mufsles if they could, but that they 
belonged to the Ifle de "Trinidady which lay farther 
North in the Latitude of 10 and 1 1 Degrees 

Thus coafting from one Kland to another, fome- 
times with the Ship, fometimes with the French Man's

[ 3^ ] 

Shalloup, (which we had found a convenient Boat, 
and therefore kept her with their very good Will ;) at 
length I came fair on the South {ide of my Ifland, and 
I prefently knew the very Countenance ot the Place ; 
fo I brought the Ship fafe to an Anchor, Broadfidc 
with the little Creek where was my old Habitation. 

As foonas I favv the Place, I called for Friday, and 
ask'd him if he knew where he was ? He looked about 
a little, and prefently clapping his Hands, cry'd ^ O 
yes, there, O yes^ there,, pointing to our old Ha- 
bitation, and fell a dancing and capering like a mad 
Fellow, and I had much ado to keep him from jump- 
ing into the Sea, to fwim afhore, to the Place. 

Well, Friday^ fays I, do you think we fhall find any 
Body here or no ; And what do you think, (hall we 
fee your Father? The Fellow flood mute as a Stock 
a good while, but when I nam'd his Father, the poor 
affedionate Creature lookM dejected, and I could fee 
the Tears run down his Face very plentifully. What 
is the Matter, Friday, fays I ? Are you troubled be- 
caufe you may fee your Father ? No, no, fays he, 
{baking his Head, no fee him more, no ever more fee 
again i '^hy foy faid I, Friday, how do you know that ? 
O DO, O no, hys Friday, he long ago die, long ago; 
he much old Man. Well^ v^d\^ fays I, Friday, you 
don't know; but fhall we fee any one elfe then ? The 
Fellow, it feems, had better Eyes than I, and he 
points juft to the Hill above my old Houfe ; and 
.tho' we lay half a League off, he cries out, we fee 1 
we fee ! yes, yes, we fee much Man there, and there, 
and there. 1 look'd, but I could fee no Body, no 
not with a Perfpedive Glafs ; which was, I fuppofe, 
becaufe I could not hit the Place, for the Fellow was 
right, as I found upon Enquiry the next Day, and 
there was five or fix Men altogether, flood to look 
at the Ship, not knowing what to think of us. 

As foon as Friday had told me he faw People, J' 
caus'd the EnglijI? Antient to be fpread, and fir'd 
i:hi:eg Giins, tp give them Notice we were Friends, 

and 



C 37 ] 

and in about Iialf a Quarter of an Hour after, we 
perceiv'd a Smoke rife from the fide of the Creek, fo 
I immediately orderMa Boat out, taking Friday with 
me, and hanging out a white Flag, or Flag of Truce, 
I went dire<^ly on Shore, taking with me the young 
Fryer I mention'd, to whom. I had told the whole 
Story of my living there, and the Manner of it, and 
(every Particular both of my felf, and thofe that I left 
there j and who was on that Account extremely de- 
firous to go with me. We had befides about fixteeti 
Men very well arra'd, if we had found any new 
Guefts there which we did not know of , but we had 
no Need of Weapons. 

As we went on Shore upon the Tide of Flood,' 
near high Water, we row a diredly into the Creek, 
and the firft Man I fix'd my Eye upon, was the Spa- 
fiiard whofe Life I had fav*d, and who I knew by his 
Face perfedly well ; as to his Habit I (hall defcrlbe 
it afterwards. I order'd no body to go on Shore at 
firft but my felf, but there was no keeping Friday in 
the Boat ; for the affec3:ionate Creature had fpy'd 
Ills Father at a Diftance, a good Way ofiF of the Spa-- 
niardsy where indeed I faw nothing of him ; and if 
they had not let him go on Shore, he would have 
jump'd into the Sea. He was no fooner on Shore, 
but he flew away to his Father like an Arrciw 
put of a Bow. It would have made any Man have 
(hed Tears in Spight of the firmed Refolution, to 
have feen the firft Tranfports of this poor Fellow^s 
Joy when he came to his Father i how he embrac'd 
him, kifs'd him, ftrok'd his Face, took him up in his 
Arms, fet him down upon a Tree, and lay down by 
him ; then ftood and look'd at him, as any one would 
look at a ftrange Pidure for a Quarter of an Hour 
together; then lye down on the Ground, and ftrokc 
his Legs, and kifs them, and then g^t up again, and 
ftare at him ; one would ha' thought the Fellow be- 
witch'd : But it would have made a Dog laugh to 
fee how the next Day his Paffion run out anothec 

C3 Way^ 



[38] 

Way : In the Morning he walked along the Shore^ 
to and again, with his Father feveral Hours, always 
leading him by the Hand, as if lie had been a La- 
dy ; and every now and then he would come .to fetch 
fomerhing or other for him to the Boat, either a 
Lump ofSugar, or a Dram, a Bisker Cake, or fome- 
thing or other that was good In the Atrernoon his 
Frolicks run another Way , for then he would fet the 
old Man down upon the Ground, and ddnce about 
him, and made a Thoufand an tick Poilures and Ge- 
flures ,• and all the while he did this^, he would be 
talking to him^ and teil'ng him one Story or another 
of his Travels and of what had happened to him 
Abroad, to divert him. In fliorr, if the farae filial 
Affedion was to be found in Chriftians to their Pa- 
rents, in our Part of the World, one would be 
tempted to fay, there would hardly ha' been any 
Need of the fifth Commandment. 

But this is a Digreflion ; I return to my Landing, • 
It would be endlefs to take Notice of all the Cere- 
monies and Civilities that the Spaniards receivM me 
with* The iirfl: Spaniard, who, as I faid, I knew 
very well, was he whofe Life I had fav^'d j he came 
towards the Boat, attended by one more, carrying 
a Flag of Truce alfo j and he did not only not 
know me at firfl:, but he had no Thoughts, no No- 
tion of its being me that was come, till I fpoke tq 
him : Seignior, faid I in Portuguefe, Do you not 
know me ? At which he fpoke not a Word > but gi- 
ving his Musket to the Man that was with him, 
threw his Arms abroad, and faying fomething in 
Spaniflo, that I did not perfedly hear, come forward, 
and embraced me, telling me he was inexcufaole, not 
to know that Face again, that he had once (een, as 
of an Angel frr m Heaven fent to fave his Life : He 
faid Abiuioance of very handfome Things, as a well 
bred Spania d always knows how -, and then beckon- 
ing to the 1\ rfon that attended him, bad him go and 
c;aU out his Comerades. He then ask'd me, if I 

would 



I 39 1 



would walk to my old Habitation, where he woul4 
give me Pofl'eilion of my own Houfe again, and 
where I fhould lee there had been but mean Improve- 
ments ; (o I walk'd along with him ,* but alas I could 
no more find the Place again, than if I had never 
been there; for they had planted fo many Trees, and 
plac'd them in fuch a Pofture, fo thick and clofe to 
one another ; and in ten Years Time they were grown 
fo big, that i}i (loon the Place was inacceflible, ex- 
,cept by fuch Windings and biind Ways, as they them- 
felves oiily^ who made them, could find. 

I a.sk'd them what put them upon all thefe Forti- 
fications ? He told me, I would fay there was need 
enough of it, when they had given me an Account 
how they had pafs'd their Time hnce their Arriving 
in the Ifland, efpecially after they had the Misfor- 
tune to find that I was gone : He told me, he could 
not but have feme Sat.sfadion in my good Fortune, 
when he heard that I was gone in a good Ship, and 
to my Satisfaftion j and that he had often-times a 
flrong Perfwafion, that one Time or other he fliould 
{ee me again : But nothing that ever befel him in his 
Life, he faid^ was fo furprizing and aiHiding to 
him at firft, as the Difappointment he was under 
when he came back to the Ifland, and found I was 
not therCo 

As to the three Barl^arians (fo he calf d them) that 
were left behind, and of whom he faid he had a long 
Story to tell me ; the Spaniards all thought them- 
felves much better among the Savages, only thae 
their Number was fo fmall. And, fays he, had 
they been flrong enough, we had been all long ago in 
Purgatory ; and with that he crofsM himfelf oa 
the Breaft : But Sir, fays he, I hope you will not be 
difpleafed, when I fhall tell you how forc'd by Ne- 
ceflicy we were oblig'd, for pur own Prefervation to 
difarm them, and making them our Sabjeds, who 
would not be content with being moderately our 
Mafters, but would be our Murtherers. I anfwer'dg 

C 4 I was 



[40] 

I was heartily afraid of it when I left them there ; 
and nothing troubled me at my parting from the 
Ifland, but that they were not come back, that I 
might have put them in PoflblTion o^ every Thing 
firft, and left the other in a State of Subjedion, as 
they deferv'd ; But if they had reducM them to it, 
I was very glad, and fhould be very far from finding 
any Fault with it j for I knew they w^re a Parcel of 
refrad^ory, ungovern'd Villains, and were fit for any 
Manner of Mifchief 

While I was faying this, came the Man whom he 
had fent back, and with him eleven Men more : In 
the Drefs they were in> it was impoffibie to guefs 
what Nation they were of : But he made all clear 
both to them and to me. Firil: he turn'd to me, and 
pointing to them, faid, Thefe, Sir, are fome of the 
Gentlemen who owe their Lives to you ; and then 
turning to them, and pointing to me, he let them 
know who I was ; upon whicii chey all came up one 
by one, not as if they had been Sailors and ordinary 
Fellows, and I the like, but reaiJy, as if they had 
been Ambaffadors of Noblemen, and I a Monarch or 
a great Conqueror ; their Behaviour was to the laft 
Degree obliging and courteous, and yet mix'd with 
a Manly, Majeftick Gravity, which very well be- 
came them ; and in fhorr, they had [o much more Man- 
ners than I, that I fcarce knew how to receive their 
Civilities, much lefs how to return them in Kind. 

The Hiflory of their coming to, and Condud in 
the Ifland, after my going away, is fo very remarka- 
ble, and has fo many Incdents, which the former 
Part of my Relation will help to underftand, and 
which will in moil of the Particulars, refer to that 
Account I have already given, that I cannot but 
commit them with great Delight to the reading of 
thofe that come after me. 

I (hall no longer trouble the S:ory with a Relation 
in the firfl; Peifon, which will put me to the Expence 
of tea Thoufand/^//^ fs, and faid hes^ and he told mes 

and 



[41 ] 

and I told him^s, and the like, but I fhall colleft the 
Fa^s Hiflorically, as near as I can gather them out 
oF my Memory from what they related to me, and 
from what I met with m my converfing with them 
and wiih the Place. 

In o>der to do this fuccindly, and as intelligibly 
as I can,l muftgo back to the Cucumflance in which 
I left U]e llland and in which the Perfons were of 
whom I am to (peak. And firft it is neceflary to 
repeat, that 1 had fent away Friday's Father and the 
Spaniard, the two whofe Lives I had refcued from the 
Savages, I fay, I had f.nt ti em a vay in a large Ca- 
noe to the Main, as I then thought it, to fetch over 
the Spaniard's Companions who he had left behind 
him in order to fave themirom the like Calamity that 
he had been in ; and in order to fuccour them for the 
prefent, and that if pollible, we might together find 
fome Way for our Deliverance afterward. 

When I fent them away, I had no vifible Appear- 
ance of, or the leaft Room to hope for my own De- 
liverance any more than I had twenty Year before, 
much lefs had I any Fore-knowledge of what after- 
ward happened, I mean of an Englijh Ship coming 
on Shore there to fetch me off; and it could not but 
be a very great Surprize to them when they came 
back, not only to find that I was gone but to 
to find three Straingers left on the Spot, poffefs'd of 
all that I had left behind me, which would other- 
wife have been their own. 

The firft Thing, however, which I enquir'd into, 
that I might begin where I left off, was of their own 
Part I and I dcCnd he would give me a parcicular 
Account of his Voyage back to his Countrymen with 
the Boat, when I fent him to fetch them over. He 
told me there was little Variety in that Part, forno- 
thing remarkable happen'd to them on the Way, they 
having very calm Weather, and a fmooth Sea ; for 
his Countrymen it could not be doubted, he faid, 
but that they were overjoyed to fee him : It feems he 

wa$ 



was the principle Man among them, the Captain of 
the Veflel they had been fhipwreck'd in, having been 
dead feme Time) they were, he /aid, the more fur- 
prized to fee him, becaufe rhey knew that he was fal- 
len into the Hands of the Savages, who, they were 
fatisfy'd, would devour him as they did all the reft 
of the Prifoners, that when they told them the 
Story of his Deliverance, and in what Manner he 
was furnifh'd for carrying them away, it was like 
a Dream to them ; and their Aftonifhment, they faid, 
was fomething like that of JofepFs Brethren, wheii 
he told them who he was, and told them the Story 
of his Exaltation in Pharoal/s Court: But when he 
Ihewed them the Arms, the Powder, the Ball, and 
the Provifions that he brought them for their Jour- 
ney or Voyage, they were reftor^d to themfelves, 
took ajuft Share of the Joy of their Deliverance, 
and immediately prepar'd to come away with him. 

Their iirftBufinefswasto get Canoes,* and in this 
they were obliged not to ftick fo m.uch upon the ho- 
rseft Part of it, but to trefpafs upon their friendly 
Savages, and to borrow two large Canoes or Peria^ 
gua's, on pretence of going out a Fifhing, or foir 
iPleafure. 

In thefe they came away the next Morning h it 
feems they wanted no Time to get themfelves ready j 
for they had no Baggage, neither Clothes orProvifi- 
ons, or any Thing in the World, but what they had 
on them, and a few Roots to eat, of which they ufed 
to make their Bread. 

They were in all three Weeks abfent, and in that 
Time, unluckily for them, I had the Occafion offer'd 
for my Efcape, as I mention'd in my other Part, and 
to get fir from the Ifland, leaving three of the moft 
impudent, hardened, ungoverM, difagreeable Vil- 
lains behind me, that any Man could defire to meet 
with, to the poor 6^^;?/V/r^j great Grief and Difap- 
pointment, you may be fure. 

The 



[43] 

The only jiifl: Thing che Rogues did, was, That 
when the Spaniards came on Shore, they gave my Let- 
ter CO them, and gave them Proviiions and other Re- 
lief, as I had ordered chem to do j alfo they gave 
them the long Paper of Dire(5i:ions which I had lefc 
with them, containing the Particular Methods which 
J took for managing every Part of my Life there, the 
Way how I baked my Bread, bred up tame Goats, 
and planted my Corn, how Iciu^'dmy Grapes, made 
my Pots, and, in a Word, every Thing I did, all this 
being written down, they gave to the Spaniards, two 
of whom underftand EngUflo well enough j nor did 
they refufe toaccommoda:e :he Spaniards with my 
Thing elfe, for they agreed very well for fome Time i 
they gave them an equal Admiffion into the Houfe, 
or Cave, and they btgan to live very fociable, and 
the Hcsid Spaniard, who had feen pretty much of my 
Method, and Friday's Father together, manag'd all 
their Affairs ; for, as for the Englijh Men, they did 
nothing but ramble about thelfland, fhoot Parrots, 
and catch Tortoifes, and when they came Home 
at Night, the Spaniards provided their Suppers for 
them. 

The Spaniards would have been fatisfy'd with this, 
would the other but have let them alone, which, 
however, they could not find in their Hearts to do 
long; but, like the Dog in the Manger, they would 
not eat themfelves, and would not let others eat nei- 
ther : The Differences, neverthelefs, were at firft 
but trivial, and fuch as are not worth relating i but 
at laft it broke out into an open War, and it begun 
with all the Rudenefs and infolence that can be ima- 
gin'd, without Reafon, without Provocation, con- 
trary to Nature, and indeed, to common Senfe ; and 
tho' it is true the firft Relation of it came from the 
Spaniards themfelves, who I may call the Accufers, 
yet when I came to examine the Fellows, they could 

inpcdenya Word ofit. 

I '■ ' ■ 

But 



[44] 

But before I come ti9 the Particulars of this Part,' 
I muft fupply a Defedt in my former Relation, and 
this was, that I forgot to fet down among the reft, 
that juft as we were weighingthe Anchor to fet Sail, 
there happened a little Qiiarrel on board our Ship, 
which I was afraid once would have turned to a fe- 
cond Mutiny ^ nor was it appeas'd, till the Captain 
rouzing up his Courage, and taking us all to his Af- 
{iftance, parted them by Force, and making two of 
th^ moft refadory Fellows Prifoners, he laid them in 
Iro^;s, and as tney had been adive in the former Dif- 
orders, and iec fall fome ugly dangerous Words the 
fecond Time, he thream^d to carry them in Irons to 
England, and have them hang'd there for Mutiny, 
auti running away with the Ship. 

Tiiis, ic feems, tho^ the Capcain did not intend to 
do ic, frighted fome other Men in the Ship, and forae 
of tnem had put it into the Heads of the reft, that 
the Captain only gave them good Words for the pre- 
fenc, till they would come to fome Englifi Port, and 
that then they ftiould be all put into Jayl, and try'd 
for their Lives^ 

The Mate got Intelligence of this, and acquainted 
us with it i upon which it was delir'd, that I, who 
ftill pafs'd for a great Man among them, fhould go 
down with the Mate, and fatisfy the Men, and tell 
them, that they might be aftur'd, if they behav'd well 
the reft of the Vo} age, all they had done for the Time 
paft (hojld be pardon'd. Sol went, and after paiTing 
my Honour's Word to them, they appear'd eafy ; and 
the morefo^ when Icaufed the two Men, who were 
in lions, to be releafed and forgiven. 

But this Mutiny had brought us to an Anchor for 
that Night, the Windalfo falling calm, next Morning 
we found, that our two Men who had been laid in 
Irons, hati ftoleeach of them a Musket, and fome o- 
ther Weapons, what Powder or Shot they had, we 
know noti and had taken the Ship's Pinnace, which 

was 



[45] 

was not yet hal'd up, and ran away with her to their 
Companions in Rogury on Shore. 

As foon as we found this, I order'd the Long-Boat 
on Shore, with twelve Men and the Mate, and a- 
way they went tofeek the Rogues, but they could nei- 
ther find them, or any of the reft ; for they all fled in- 
to the Woods when they faw the Boat coming on 
Shore. The Mate was once refolv'd in Juftice to 
their Rogery, to have deftroy'd their Plantations, 
burntall their Houfhold-StufFand Furniture, and left 
them to Mk without it ; but having no Order, he 
let it all alone, left every Thing as they found it, and 
bringing the Pinnace away, came on Board with- 
out them. 

Thefe two Men made their Number Rvc^ but the 
other three Villains werefo much wickeder than thefe^ 
that after they had been 2 or 3 Days together, they 
turned their two New-Comers out of Doors to fhift 
for themfelves, and would have nothing to do with 
them, nor could they for a good while be perfuaded 
to give them any Food ; as for the Spaniards they 
were not yet come. 

When the Spaniards came firft on Shore, the Bufi- 
nefs began to go forward ; the Spaniards would have 
perfuaded the three Engh[h Brutes to have taken in 
their two Country-men again, that, as they faid, they 
might be all one Family j but they would not hear oi 
it : So the two poor Fellows liv'd by themfelves, and 
finding nothing but Indufteryand Application would 
make them live comfortably, they pitch'd theic 
Tents on the North Shore of the Ifland, but a little 
more to thQ Wefi, to be out of the Danger of the Sa- 
vages, who always landed on the Eaft Parts of the 
IQand. 

Here they built them two Huts, one to lodge in, 
and the other to lay up their Magazines and Stores 
in, and the Spaniards having given them fome Corn 
for Seed, and efpecially fome of the Peas which I 
had ie^t them, they dug and planted, and enclofed, 

after 



C4^] 



after the Pattern I had fet for them alJ, and begin tB 
live V'ti try well ; their firft Cop of Corn was on the 
Ground, and » iio' it was b. r a little Bit of Land 
which they had dug up at firfl-, having had but a 
little 7 iriii:, yxt ic was enocghr to relieve them^ and 
find chem with Bread and other Eatables; and one 
of the Fellows being the Cook^s Mate of the Ship, 
was very ready at making Soup, Puddi^;gs, and fiieh 
other Prepara.ioiSj as the Rice, and the Milk, and 
fuch little Flefh as they got, furnifh a him to do. 

They were going on in a little thriving Pofture, 
when the three ^natural Rogues, their own Country 
men toOj in meer Humour, and to infult them, came 
and bull) 'd them, and told them, the Ifland was 
theirs, that the Governour, meaning me, had given 
them PoflelTion of it, and no Bodyelfe had any right 
to It, and damn 'em, they fhould build no Houfes 
upon their Ground, unlefs they would pay them Rent 
for them. 

The two Men thought they had jcfted at firft, 
ask'd them to come in and fir down, and fee what 
fine Houfes they were that they had built, and tell 
them what Rent they demanded, and one of thera 
merrily told them, if they were Ground-Landlordsj^ 
he hoped, if they built Tenements upon their Land, 
and made Improvements, they would, according to 
the Cuftom of Landlords, grant them a long Leafe, 
and bid them go fetch a Scrivener to draw the Wri- 
tings. One of the three damning and raging, told 
them, they lliould fee they were not in Jefl, and go- 
ing to a little Place at a Diftance, where the honeft 
Men had made a Fire to drefs their Victuals, he takes 
a Fire-brand, and claps it to the Out-fide of their 
Hut, and very fairly fet it on Fire, and it would 
have been all burnt down in a few Minutes, if one 
of the two had not run to the Fe. ow, thruft him a- 
way, and trod the Fire out with his Feet, and that 
not without feme diiRculty too. 

The 



[47] 

The Fellow was in fuch a Rage at the honeft Man's 
thrufling him away, that he turn'd upon him with a 
Pole he had in his Hand, and had not the Man avoid- 
ed the Blow very nimbly, and run into the Hut, he 
had ended his Days at once ; his Comrade feeing 
the Danger they were both in, run in after him, and 
immediately they came both out with their Muskets> 
and the Man that was firfl ftruck at with the Pole, 
knocked the Fellow down that begun the Qijarrel, 
with the Stock of his MuskeCj and that before the 
other two could come to heip him, and then feeing 
the red: come at them, they flood to^^ether, and pre- 
fenting the other End ot their Pieces to them, bad 
them ftand off. 

The otner had Fire Arms with them too, but 
one of the two honeft Men, bolder than his Come- 
rade, and made defperate by his Danger, told them^ 
if they ofter'd to move Hand or Foot they were dead 
Men, and boldly commanded them rolay down their 
Arms. They did not indeed lay down their Arms, 
but feeing him forefolute, it brought them to a Par- 
ley, and they confenred to ti.ke' their u^ouided Man 
with them, and be gone; and indeed it (eems the 
Fellow was wounded i'ufficiently with the Blow ; 
however, they were much in the wrong, fince they 
had the Advantage, that they did not difarm them 
effe^ually, as they might have done^ and have gone 
immediately to tne Spaniards^ and given them an Ac° 
count how the Rogues had treated them -, for the 
three Villains liuuied nothing but Revenge, and 
every Day gave them fome intimation that they 
did lo. 

But not to crow'd this Part with an Account o( 
the leifer Part of their Rogueries, fuch as treading 
down their Corn, fhooting three young Kids^^and a 
She-Goat, which the poor Men had got to breed up 
Tame for their Store ; and, in a Word, plaguing 
them Night and Day in this Manner, it forced the 
^wo Men to fuch a Defperation, that they refolv'd 



[48] 

to fight them all three the firft Tfmethej^ had a fair 
Opporunicy j in order to this they refoiv^'d to go to 
theCaftle, as they called ic, that was my old Dwel- 
ling where the three Rogues and the Spaniards all 
liv'd together, at that Time i intending to h^ve a 
fair Ba tie, and the Spaniards Ihould ftand by to 
fee f^ir Piity i fo they go: up in the Morning before 
Day, and came to the Place, and call'd che Englifi 
Men by their Names, telh'nga Spaniard thsLi SLuiwQT'd^ 
that they wanted to fpeak with them.^ 

It happened that the Day before two of the Spa^ 
niards having been in the Woods, had feen one of the 
two English Men, who, for Diftin6:ion, I call the 
Hohej'i Men ,• and he had made a fad Complaint to 
thQ Spaniards y of the Barbarous Ufage they had met 
with from their three Coiintrymen, and how they 
had ruined their Plantation, and deftroy'd their Corn, 
that they had labour'd fo hard to biing forward^ and 
kili'd the Miltch'Goat, and their three Kids, which 
was all they had provided for their Suftenance, and 
that if he and his Friends meaning the Spaniards, did 
not affift them again, they fhould be ftarved. When 
the Spaniards came Home at Night, and they were 
all at Supper, he took the Freedom to reprove the 
three £/2^/(/& Men, tho'in very gtnule and mannerly 
Terms, andas'd them, How they could be fo cruel^ 
they being harmlefs inoffenfive Fellows, and that 
they were putting rhemfelves in a Way to fubiifl by 
their Labour, and that it had coft them a great deal 
of Pains to bring Things to fuch Perfedion a. they 
had ? 

One of the Engi/fh Men return'd very briskly, 
what had they to do there ? That they came on Shore 
without Leave, and they fhould not Plant or Build 
upon the liland, it was none of their Ground. Why, 
fays the Spaniard very calmly, Seignior Inglefe, they 
wufl notflarve ? The Englifi Man reply*d like a true 
rough hewn Tarpaulin, they might Starve and be 
Damn'd, they fhould not Plant nor Build in thae ! 

Place, 



[ 49 ] 

PlzcQ' But what mull they do then, Seignor, (afi 
the Spaniard} Another of the Brutes return'di do? 

D m "em, they lliould be Servants and work for 

them. But how can you exped that of them, fays 
the Spaniard, they are not Lought with your Mo- 
ney; you have no Right to make them Servants? 
The Englifi Men anfwer'd, the Ifland was theirs, the 
Governour had given it to them, and no Man had a- 
ny thing to do there but themfelves; and with that 
fwore by his Maker, that they would go and burn all 
their new Huts, they fliould buiid none upon theic 
Land. 

Why, Seignior, fays the Spaniard, by the fame 
Rule we muil be your Servants too ? Ay, fays the 
bold Dog, and fo youfhalltoo, before we have done 
with you, mixing two or three G-d Damme^'s in the 
proper Intervales or his Speech j the Spaniard only 
fmil d at that, and made him no Anfwer : However^ 
this little Difcourfe had heated them, and flatting up, 
one fays to the others I think it was he they called 
Will. Atkins, Gome Jack, let us go and have the t'o- 
ther Brufli with them ; we'll demolifli their Caflle^^ 
Til warrant youi they fhall plant no Colony in out 
Dominions, _ 

Upon this, they went all Trooping away, witli 
every Man a Goo, a Piftol, and a Sword and 
muttcr'd fome infolenc Things among themfelves of^ 
what they would do to the Spaniards too, when Op- 
porttinity otFer'd -, but the Spaniards it (Q^ms did not 
fo perfedly underfland them, as to know all the Parti- 
culars, only, that in general, they threatned them 
hard for taking the two Englijh Mens Parr. 

Whether they went or how they beftow^'d their time 
that Eveningj the Spaniards faid, they did not know ; 
but it feems they wanderM about the Country, Part 
of the Night, and then lying down in the Piac^ which 
I ufed to call my Bower, they were weary, and over- 
llept themfelves. The Cafe was this, they had re- 
folv'd to ftay till Mid-Night, and fo to take the poor 

D MenJ 



C 50 ] 

Men when they were afleep, and as they acknow- 
ledged it afterwards, intended to fee Fire to their 
Huts while they were in them, and either burn them 
in them, or murder them as they came out : and as 
Malice feldom deeps very (bund, it was very ftrange 
they fhould not have been kept waking. 

However, as the two Men had alfo a Defign upon 
them, as I have faid, tho' a much fairer one than 
that of Burning and Murthering, it happened, and 
very luckily for them all, that they were up and gone 
abroad, before the bloody-minded Rogues came to 
their Huts. 

When they came there and found the Men gone, 
^Athnsy who it feems was the forwardeft Man, call'd 
out to his Comerades, ha' Jack^ here's the Neft, but 
D.,..n'em the Birds are flown: They mufed a 
while to think what fhould be the Occafion of their 
being gone abroad fo (oon, and fuggefted prefently 
that the Spaniards had given them Notice of it, and 
with that they fiiook Hands, and fworeto one ano- 
ther that they would bereveng'd of the Spaniards. As 
foon as they had made this bloody Bargain they fell 
to work with the poor Mens Habitation, they did 
not fet Fire indeed to any Thing, but they pull'd 
down both their Houfes, and pull'd them fo Limb 
from Limb, that they left not the leaft Stick ftanding,^ 
orfcarce any Sign on the Ground where they flood ; 
they tore all their little colleded Houfhold ftuff in 
Pieces, and threw every Thing about in fuch a Man- 
ner, that the poor Men found afterwards fome of 
their Things a Mile off from their Habitation. 

When they had done this they pulTd up all the 
the young Trees which the poor Men had planted i 
pull'd up the Enclolure they had made to fecure their 
Cattle and their Corn i and in a Word, fack'd and 
plundered every thing, as compleatly as a Hoord of 
Tartars would have done. 

The two Men were at this Jundure gone to find 
them out, and had refolv'd to fight them whereever 

they 



[51 ] 



they had been, tho' they were but two to three : So 
that had they met, there certainly would have been 
Blood fhed anaong them, for they were all very flouc 
refolute Fellows, to give them their due. 

But Providence took more Care to keep them af- 
funder, then they themfelves could do to meet ; fof^ 
as if they had dogg'd one another, when the three 
were gone thither, the two were here ; and afterwards 
when the two went back to find them, and three were 
come to the old Habitation again ; we Cball fee their 
differing Conduft prefently. When the three came 
back, like furious Creatures flufli'd with the Rage 
which the Work they had been- about put them into^ 
they came up to the Spaniards, and told them what 
they had done, by way of Scoff and Bravado ; and 
bne of them flepping up to one of the Spaniards, aS 
if they had been a Couple of Boys at Play, takes hold 
6f his Hat, as it was upon his Head, and giving it a 
Twirl about, fleering in his Face, fays he to him, 
Andjouy Seignior, Jack Spaniard, Ihall Ba^je th^'faine 
Sauce, if you do not mend your Manners i The Spaniard, 
who tho^ a quiet civil Man, was as brave^- as a Man 
could be defired to be, and withal a fttong well-mada 
Man, look'd fteadily at him for a good while, and 
then, having no Weapon in his Hand, ilept gravely 
up to him, and with one Blow of his Fill knock'd 
him dowuj as an Ox is feii'd with aPoIe-Axe; at 
which one of the Rogues, infolent at the firfl, fir'd 
his Pidol at the Spaniard immediately ; he mifs'd his 
Body indeed, for the Bullets went thro' his Hair, but 
one of them touched the tip of his Ear, and he bled 
pretty much. The Blood made the Spaniard believe^ 
he was more hurt then he really was, and that put 
him into fome Heat, for before, he aded all in a 
perfed Calm ; but now refolving to go thro^ with his 
Work, heftoop'd and tookthe Fellow's Musket who 
he had knock'd down, and was juft going to fhoot the 
Man who had fir'd at him, when the reil of the Spd- 
ttiards being in the Cave came out^ and calling to 

D 3. hirdt 



15^1 

him not to fhoot, they ftept in, fecur'd the other 
two, and took their Arms from them* 

When they were thus difarm'd, and found they 
had made all the Spaniards their Enemies, as well 
as their own Countrymen, they began to cool, and 
giving the Spaniards better Words, would have had 
their Arms again ; but the Spaniards confidering the 
Feud that was between them and the other two Eng- 
liflo Men, and that it would be the beft Method they 
Gould take, to keep them from one another, told 
them, they would do them no harm^ and if would 
livepeacibly, they would be very willing to affift 
and fociate with them, as they did before j but that 
they could not think of giving them their Arms 
again, while they appear'd fo refolv'd to doMifchief 
with them to their own Countrymen, and had even 
threatned them all, to make them their Servants. 

The Rogues were now more capable to heat 
Reafon, than toad Reafon, but being refused their 
Arms, they went raving away, and taging like mad 
Men, threatning what they would do, tho' they had 
no Fire- Arms: But the Spaniards defpifing their 
Threatning, told them they fhould take Care how 
they offered any Injury to their Plantation or Cattle^ 
for if they did, they would flioot them as they would 
do ravenous Beafts, wherever they found them j and 
if they fell into their Hands alive^ they Ihould certain- 
ly be hang'd^ However, this was far from cooling 
them, but away they went raging and fwearing like 
Furies of Hell. As foon as they were gone, came 
back the two Men in PalTion and rage enough alfo, 
tho* of another Kind ', for having been at their Plan- 
tation, and finding it all demolifhed and deltroy'd as 
above, it will eafily be fuppos*d they had Provocatiott^ 
enough,- they could fcarcehave Room to tell their 
Tale, the Spaniards were fo eager to tell them theirs i 
and it was ftrange enough to find that three Men 
Ihould thus bully nineteen, and receive no Punifli- 
mentatalU . 

Th« 



[5J] 



The Spaniards indeed defpifed them, and efpeciai- 
iy having thus difarni'd them, made light of all their 
Threatnings ; but the two Englijh Men refolv'd to 
have their Remedy againft them, what Pains foe- 
verit coft tofind them out. 

But the Spaniards interpoS'd here too, and told 
them, that as they were already difarm^'d, they could 
not confent that they (the Two) fhould purfue them 
with Fire- Arms and perhaps kill them ; but faid 
the grave Spaniard, v/ho was their Governour, we 
will endeavour to make them do you Juftice, if you 
will leave it to us ; for as there is no doubt but they 
will come to us again when their Paffion is over, being 
notable to fubfift without our Affiftance ; we promife 
you to make no Peace with them, without having a 
full Satisfadion for you ; and upon this Condition we 
hope you will promife, to ufe no Violence with 
^hem, other than in your own Defence. 
• The two Englijb Men yielded to this veryawkardr 
ly, and with great Reludance, but the Spaniards 
protefted, they did it only to keep them from Blood- 
fhed, and to make all eafy at laft j for faid they, we 
are not fo many of us, here is Room enough for us 
all, and it is great pity we fhould not be all good 
Friends ; at length they did confent, and waited for 
thelflueofthe Thing, living for fome Days with the 
Spaniards, for their own Habitation was deftcoyed. 
In about five Days Time the three Vagrants, tir'4 
with Wandring, and almoft ftarv'd with Hunger^ 
having chiefly liv'd on Turtles Eggs all that while, 
came back to the Grove ; and finding my Spaniard, 
who, as I have faid, was the Governour, and two 
more with him walking by the Side of the Creek ; 
they ^ame up in a very fubmilTive humble Manner^ 
and begg'd to be received again into the Family. 
The Spaniards ufed them civilly, but told them, they 
had aded fo unnaturally by their Countrymen, and 
fo very grofsly by them (the Spaniards) that they 
■ ' D 5 ' could 



[54] 



cpuld not come to any Concludon, without con- 
fuking the two Englij]:> Men and the reft ; but how- 
ever, they would go to them and difcourfe about it, 
and they fliould know in half an Hour. It may be 
guefsM, that they were very hard put to it, for it 
feems, as they were to wait this half Hour for an 
Anfwer, they begg'd he would fend them out fome 
Bread in the mean Time, which he did, and fent 
them at the fame Time a large Piece of Goats Fiefh^ 
and a boiled Parror, which they eat very heariily, 
for they were hungry enough. 

After half an Hour's Confnltation they were call'd 
in, and a long Debate had among them, their two 
Countrymen charging them with the Ruin of all their 
Labour, and a Deiign to murther them; all which 
they own'd before, and therefore could nor deny 
nov/ ; upon the whole, the Spaniard afted the Mode- 
rator between them, and as they had obliged the two 
Englifb Men not to hurt the three while they were 
naked and unarmed, fo they now oblig<i the three 
to go and rebuild their Fellows two Huts^ one to 
be oi the fame Dimendons, and the other larger 
than they were before ; alfo to fence their Grpund 
again where they had puU'd up the Fences, plant Trees 
in the Room ofthofepull'd up, dig up the Land again 
for planting Corn, where they had fpoil'd it ; and 
in a Word, to reftcre every Thing in the fame State 
as they found it, as near as they could, for entirely it 
could not be, the Seafon for the Corn, and the 
Growth of the Trees, and Hedges, not being poffi- 
ble to be recovered. 

Well, they fubmitted to all this; and as they 
had Plenty of Provilions given them all the while, 
they grew very orderly, and the whole Society be - 
gan to live pjeafantly and agreeably together again ; 
only that thefe three Fellows could never be perfwad- 
ed to work, I mean not for themfelves, except now 
and then a little, juft as' they pleafed i however, the 
Spaniards told them plainly, that if they would but 
'• '' jive 



[55] 

live fociablyand friendly together, and ftudy in the 
whole the Good of the Plantation, they would be 
content to work for them, and let them walk about 
and be as idle as they pleasM ; and thus having liv'd 
pretty well together for a Month or two, the Spa- 
niards gave them Arms again, and give them Liberty 
to go abroad with them as before. 

It was not above a Week after they had thefe 
Arms, and went abroad, but the ungrateful Crea-- 
tures began to be as infolent and troublefom as be- 
fore ; but however, an Accident happening prefent- 
ly upon this, which endangered the Safety of theni 
all, they were oblig'd to lay by all private Refent- 
ments, and look to the Prefervation of their Lives. 

It happen 'd one Night, that the Spaniard Go- 
vernour, as I call him, that is to fay, the Spaniard 
whofe Life I had fav'd, who was now the Captain, 
or Leader, or Governour of the reft, found himfelf 
very uneafy in the Night, and could by no Means 
get any Sleep : He was perfectly well in Body, as 
he told me the Story, only found his Thoughts tu- 
multuous,* his Mind run upon Men fighting, and 
killing of one another, but was broad awake, and 
could not by any Means get any Sleep ,* in (hort, 
he lay a great while, but growing more and more 
uneafy, he refolv'd to rife : As they lay, (being fo 
many of them, upon Goat-skins, laid thick upori 
fuch Couches, and Pads, as they made for them- 
felves ; and not in Hammocks and Ship-Beds, as I 
did, who was but one, fo they had little to do, 
when they were willing to rife, but to get up upon 
their Feet, and perhaps put on a Coat, fuch as it 
was, and their Pumps, and they were ready for going 
any Way that their Thoughts guided them. 

Being thus gotten up, he Icok'd out, but being 
dark, he could fee little or nothing, and befides, the 
Trees which I had planted, as in my former Ac- 
count is defcribed, and which were now grown tall 
intercepted his Sight, fo that he could only look up, 

D 4 and 



[5^] 

and fee that it was a cleat Star-light Night, and hear- 
ing no Noife, he retur'd and laid him down again ; 
but it was ail one, he could not fleep, nor could he 
corapofe himfelf to any Thing like Reft, but his 
Thoughts were to the laft Degree uneafy, and yet he 
knew not for what. 

Having made fome Noife with rifing and walking 
about, going out and ccrning in, another of them 
wak'd, and calling, ask'a, who it was that was up ? 
The Governour told him, how it had been with 
him : Say you fo, fays the other Spaniard, fuch Things 
are not to be flighted, I aflure you ; there is certain- 
ly fome Mifchief working, fays he, near us, and pre- 
fently he asked him, where are the Englijh Men ? 
They are all in their Huts, fays he, fafe enough. It 
feems, the Spaniards had kept PofTeflSon of the main 
Apartment, and had made a Place, where the three 
Englifi Men, (ince their laft Mutiny, always quar- 
tered by themfelves and could not come at the reft. 
Well, fays the Spaniard^ there is fomething in it, I 
am perfuaded from my own Experience ; I am 
fatisfy'd our Spirits embodied have a Converfe with, 
and receive Intelligence from the Spirits unem- 
bodied, and inhabiting the in vifible World, and this 
friendly Notice is given for our Advantage, if we 
know how to make ufe of it. Come, fays he, let 
us go put and look abroad, and if we find nothing 
at all in it to juftify the Trouble, Til tell you a Story 
to the Burpofe,that fhall convince you of the Juftice 
of my propofing it. 

Ina Word^ they went out to go to the Top of the 
Hill, where I us 4 to go> but they being ftrong and 
in good Company, not alone, as I was, us'd none of 
my Cancions, to go up by the Ladder, and then pul- 
ling it up after them, to go up a fecond Stage to the 
Top, but were going round through the Grove un- 
concerned and un weary, when they were furprizM 
W'th feeing a Light, as of Fire, a very little Way 



[57] 



off from them, and hearing the Voices of Men, noc 
of one, or two, but of a greater Number. 

In all the Difcoveries 1 had made of the Savages 
landing on the liland, it was my conftant Care to 
prevent them making the leafl: Difcovery of there 
being any Inhabitant upon the Place ; and when by 
any Neceflity they came to know it, they felt it fo 
eftedually, that they that got away, were fcare able 
to give any Account of it, for we difappearM as foon 
as poiFible, nor did ever any that had feen me, efcap^ 
to tell any one elfe, except it was the three Savages 
in our laft Encounter, who jumpM into the Boat, of 
whom I mentioned, that I was afraid they Ihould go 
Home and bring more Help. 

Whether it was the Confequence of the Efcape of 
thofe Men, that fo great a Number came now toge-? 
ther; or whether they came ignorantly and by Acci- 
dent on their ufual bloody Errand, the Spania>ds 
could not it feems underftand ; but whatever it was> 
it had been their Bufinefs, either to have conceard 
themfelves, or not to have feen them at all ,* much 
lefs to, have let the Savages have feen that there were 
any Inhabitants in the Place : But to have fallen up- 
on them fo effcdually, as that not a Man of them 
(hould have efcap'd, which could only have been 
by getting in between them and their Boats ; but 
this Prefence of Mind v/as wanting to them, w^hich 
was the Ruin of their Tranquility for a great while. 

We need not doubt, but that the Governour and 
the Man with him, furpriz'd with this Sight, run 
back immediately, and raised their Fellows, giving 
them an Account of the imminent Danger they were 
^11 in ', and they again as readily took the Alarm, but 
it was impoflible to perfwade them to ftay dole with- 
in where they were, but that they mufl run ail out to 
fee how Things flood. 

While it was dark indeed, they were well enough, 
and they had Opportunity enough for feme Hours to 
view them by the Light of vhies Fire^' they had 

made 



[58] 



made at a Diflance from one another; what they 
were doing they knew not, and what to do them- 
felves they knew not. For, lirfl:, the Enemy were 
too many ; and fecondly, they did not keep together, 
but were divided into feveral Parties, and where on 
Shore in feveral Places. 

The Spaniards were in no fmall Confternation at 
this Sight 5* and as they found that the Fellows ran 
ilraggling all over the Shore, they made no Doubt, 
but firft or laft, fome of them would chop in upon 
their Habitation, or upon fome other Place^ where 
they would fee the Token of Inhabitants, and they 
were in great Perplexity alfo for fear of their 
Flock of Goats, which would have been little lefs 
than flarving them, if they would have been de- 
ftroy'd ; (o the firft Thing they refolv*d upon, was to 
difpatch three Men away before it was light, viz>. two 
Spaniards and one Engliflomany to drive all the Goats 
away to the great Valley where the Cave was, and 
if Need were, to drive them into the very Cave itfelf. 

Could they have feen the Savages all together in 
one Body, and at any Diftance from their Canoes, 
they refolv'd, if they had been an hundred of them, 
to have attacked them ; but that could not be ob- 
tained, for they were fome of them two Miles off 
from the other^ and as it appeared afterwards, were 
of two different Nations. 

After having mufed a great while on the Courfe 
they fhould take, and beaten their Brains in confider- 
ing their prefent Circumftances ,* they refolv'd at 
lafl, while it was dark, to fend the old Savage, Fri' 
day\ Father, out as a Spy, to learn, if pollible, fome- 
thing concerning them, as what they came for, and • 
what they intended to do, and the like \ the old Man 
isadily undertook it, and flrioping himfelf quite 
naked, as moll of the Savages were> away he went: 
After he had been gone an Hour or two, he brings 
Word, that he had been among them undifcover'd, 

that 



[59] 



that he found they were two Parties^ and of two fe- 
veral Nations who had War with one another^ and 
had had a great Battle in their own Country, and 
that both Sides having had feveral Pri Toners taken in 
the Fight, they were by meer Chance landed 
all in the fame Ifland, for the devouring their Prifo- 
ners, and making ttierry ,• but their coming fo by 
Chance to the fame Place had fpoil'd all their 
Mirth ; that they were in a great Rage at one 
another, and that fo near, that he believ'd 
they would fight again, as foon as Day -light began 
to appear ; but he did not perceive that they had 
any Notion of any Body's being on the Ifland but 
themfelves. He had hardly made an End of telling 
his Story, when they could perceive, by the unufual 
Noife they made, that the two little Armies were 
engaged in a bloody Fight. 

Fridays Father ufed all the Arguments he could 
to perfuade our People to Mq clofe, and not be feen; 
he told them their Safety con(ifled in it, and that they 
had nothing to do but Mq ftill, and the Savages 
would kill one another to their Hands, and the refl 
would go away i and it was fo to a Tittle. But it 
was impoffible to prevail, efpecially upon the En- 
glifimen ; their Curiofity was fo importunate upon 
their Prudentials, that they muft run out and fee the 
the Battle : However, they ufed fome Caution too. 
(viz..) they did not go openly, jufl by their own 
Dwelling, but went farther into the Woods, and 
plac'd themfelves to Advantage, where they might 
fecurely fee them manage the Fight, and, as they 
thought, not to be feen by them ,• but it feems the 
Savages did fee them, as we fhall find hereafter. 

The Battle was very fierce, and if I might believe 
the Englijbmen, one of them faid, he could perceive, 
that fome of them were Men of great Bravery, of 
invincible Spirits, and of great Policy in guiding the 
Fight. The Battle, they faid, held two Hours, be- 
fore they could guefs which Party would be beaten ; 

but 



[do] 

but then that Party which was neareft our People^s 
Habitation began to appear weakeft, and after feme 
Time more, feme of them began to" fly ; and this 
put our Men again into a great Confternation, leaft 
any of thofe that fled fhould run into the Grove, ber 
ibre their Dwelling, for Shelter, and thereby invo- 
luntarily difcover the Place; and that by Confer 
quence the Purfuers (hould do the like in Search fqr 
them. Upon this they refolv'd that they would 
ftand armM within the Wall, and whoever came into 
the Grove, they fhould fally out over the Wall and 
kill them i fo that, if polTiblc, not one fhould return 
to give an Account of it ; they orderM alfo, that it 
fhould be done with their Swords, or by knocking 
them down with the Stock of the Musket, but not 
by fhooting them, for fear of raifingan Alarm by the 
Noife. 

As they expected, it fell out ; three of the routed 
Army fled for Life, and, croiling the Creek, ran di'* 
redly into the Place, not in the leaft knowing whe- 
ther they went, but running as into a thick Wood 
for Shelter,* the Scout they kept to look Abroad, 
gave Notice of this within, with this Addition, to 
our Mens great Satisfadion, ( viz. ) That the 
Conquerors had not purfued them, or feen which 
Way they were gone ; upon this, the Spaniard Go- 
vernour a Man of Humanity , would not fufferthem 
to kill the three Fugitives, but fending three Men 
out by the Top of the Hill, order'd them to go 
round and come in behind them, furprize and take 
Prifoners, which was done ,* the Refidue of the con- 
quer'd People fled to their Canoes and got off to Sea ; 
the Vidors retired, and made no Purfuit or very lit- 
tle, but drawing themfelves into a Body together, 
gave two great skreaming Shouts, which they fup- 
pos*d was by way of Triumph, and fo the Fight 
ended: And the fame Day, about three a Clock in 
the Afternoon, they alfo marched to their Canoes* 
And thus the Spaniards had their liland again free to 

them- 



C ^i ] 

themfelves, their Fright was over, and they faw no 
Savages in feverai Years after. 

After they were all gone, the Spaniards cam^ out 
of their Den, and viewing the Field of Battle, they 
found about two and thirty dead Men upon the Spot ; 
fome were kill'd with great long Arrows^ fome of 
which were found flicking in their Bodies,- but moft 
of them were kill'd with their great wooden Swords, 
(ixteen or feventeen of which they found in the Field 
of Battle, and as many Bows, with a great many 
Arrows : Thefe Swords were ftrange great unw^zldy 
Things, and they muft be very ilrong Men that ufed 
them : Moft of thofe Men that were kfil'd v/ith 
them, had their Heads mafh'd to Pieces, as we may 
fay, or as we call it in EnglifJo, their Brains knocked 
out, and feveral their Arms and Legs broken ; (o 
that 'tis evident they fight with inexpreffible Rage 
and Fury. We found not one wounded Man that 
was not ftone dead ,• for either they flay by their E- 
nemy till they have quite kill'd him, or they carry all 
the wounded Men, that are not quite dead, away 
with them. 

This Deliverance tam'd our EngUfimen for a great 
while I the Sight had fill'd them with Horror, and 
the Confequences appear'a terrible to iht laft Degree^ 
efpecially upon fuppoling thac fome Time or other 
they fhould fail into the Hands of thofe Creatures, 
who would not only kill them as Enemies, but kill 
them for Food, as we kill our Cattle. And they 
profefs'd to me, that the Thoughts of being eaten 
up like Beef or Mutton, tnough it was fuppos'd 
it was not to be till they were dead, had fomething 
in it fo horrible, that it naufeated their very Sto- 
machs, made them fick when they thought of ir, 
and fill'd their Minds with fuch unufual Terror, that 
they were not themfelves for fome V/eek*. after. 

This as I faid, tam'd even the three Enghjh BruteSj 
1 have been fpeaking of j and for a great while after, 
they were very tra^abie^ and went about their com- 
mon 



mon Bufinefs of their whole Society well enough ; 
planted, fow'd, reap^'d, and began to be all naturalized 
to the Country, But fomecime after this, they fell all 
into fuch fimple Meafures again as brought them 
into a great deal of Trouble. 

They had taken three Prifoners, as I had obferv'dj 
and thefe three being lufty flout young Fellows, they 
made them Servants, and taught them to work fot 
them, and, as Slaves, they did well enough,* but 
they did not take their Meafures with them as I did. 
by my M8,nFaday, vi^. to begin with them upon the 
Principle of having fav'd their Lives, and then in- 
ftrufl them in the rational Principles of Life^ much 
lefs of Religion, civilizing and reducing them by 
kind Ufage and aftedionate Arguings ; but as they 
gave them their Food every Day, fo they gave them 
their Work too, and kept them fully employed in 
Drudgery enough j but they fail'd in this, by itj 
that they never had them to aflifl them and fight for 
them, as I had my Man Friday^ who was as true to 
me as the very Flelh upon my Bones. 

But to come to the Family Part, being all now- 
good Friends; for common Danger, as I faid above, 
had effectually reconcil'd them, they began to confi- 
der their general Circumftances ', and the firft Thing 
that came under their Confideration was. Whether, 
feeing the Savages particularly haunted that Side of 
the 10 and, and that there were more remote and 
retired Parts of it equally adapted to their Way of 
Living, and manifeflly to their Advantage, they 
Hiould not rather remove their Habitation, and plant 
in fome more proper Place for their Safety, and ef- 
pecially for the Security of their Cattle and Corn ? 

Upon this, after long Debate, it was concluded 
That they would not remove their Habitation ; be- 
caufe that fome Time or other, they thought they 
might hear from their Governour again, meaning mei 
and if Ifhould fend any one to feek them, I fhould 
be furc to dired them to that S^de, v/here if they 

fliculd- 



[^5] 



ftiould find the Place demolifh'd, they would con- 
clude the Savages had kill'd us all, and we were 
gone, and (o our fupply would go too. 

But as to their Corn and Cactle, they agreed to 
remove them into the Valley where my Cave was, 
where the Land was as proper for both, and where 
indeed there was Land enough : However, upon 
fecond Thoughts, they altered one Part of their Ke- 
folution too, and refolv'd only to remove Part of 
their Cattel thither, and plant Part of their Corn 
there ; and fo if one Part was deftroy'd the other 
might be fav'd : and one Part of Prudence they ufed, 
which it was very well they did, viz.. That they ne- 
ver trufted thofe three Savages, which they had Pri- 
foners, with knowing any thing, of the Plantation 
they had made in that Valley, or of any Cattle they 
had there ; much lefs of the Cave there, which they 
kept, in Cafe of Necellity,' as a fafe Retreat, and 
thither they carried alfo the two Barrels of Pow- 
der, which I had fent them at my comming away. 

But however they refolv'd not to change their Ha- 
bitation, yet they agreed, that as I had carefully co- 
vered it firft with a Wall or Fortification, and theti 
with a Grove of Trees ; fo, feeing their Safety con- 
{ifted entirely in their being conceard, of which they 
were now fully eonvine'd 5 they fet to Work to co- 
ver and conceal the Place yet more effedually than 
before : To this Purpofe, as I had planted Trees^ 
(or rather thruft in Stakes, which in Time all greiv 
up to be Trees) for fome good Diiiance before the 
Entrance into my Apartment, they w^ent on in the 
fame Manner, and fill'd up the reft of that whole 
Space of Ground, from the Trees I had fet, quite 
down to the Side of the Creek, where aslfaid, I 
landed my Floats, and even into the very Ouze where 
the Tide flow'd, not fo much as leaving any Place 
to land, or any Sign that there had been any Land- 
ing thereabout : Thefe Stakes alfo, being of a Wood 
f ery forward to grow, as I have noted formerly, they 

took 



C<^4] 



took Care to have generally very much larger and 
taller than thofe which I had planted them (b 
very thick and clofe together, that when they had 
been three or four Years grown, there was no pierc- 
ing with the Eye any confiderable Way into the 
Plantation. And as for that Part which I had plan- 
ted, the Trees were grown as thick as a Manx's 
Thigh ; and among them they placed fo many other 
fhort ones, and fo thick, that, in a Word, it flood 
like a Paiiifado, a quarter of a Mile thick, and it 
was next to impoffible to penetrate it, but with a 
little Army to cut it all down ; for a little Dog could 
hardly get between the Trees, they flood fo clofe. 

But this was not all ? for they did the fame by 
all the Ground to the right Hand^ ar.d tb the Lefty 
and round even to Top of the Hill ; leaving no Way, 
not fo much as for themfelves to come out, but by 
the Ladder placed up to the Side of the Hill, and 
then lifted up, and placed again from the firft Stage 
tip to the Top ; which Ladder^ when it was taken 
down, nothing but what had Wings or Witchcraft 
to affift it, could come at them. 

This was excellently well contriv'd : Nor was it 
lefs than what they afterwards found Occaiion for,- 
which ferv'd to convince me, that as humati' 
Prudence has Authority of Providence to jufli fy it^ 
fo it has, doubtlefs, the Diredion of Providence td 
fet it to Work ; and would we liflen carefully to the 
Voice of it, lam fully perfuaded we might prevenr 
many of the Difaflers which our Lives are now, by 
our own Negligence, fubjeded to. But this by the 
Way. 

I return to the Story. They liv'd two Years after 
this in perfeft Retirement, and had no mote VifitS 
from the Savages ; They had, indeed, an Alarm gi- 
ven them one Morning which put them into a great 
Confternation j for fome of the Spaniards being out 
early one Morning on the Wefl Side, or rather the 
End of the Ifland, vvhich^ by the Way, was that End 

were 



where I never went, for fear of being difcover'd, they 
were furpriz^d with feeing above twenty Canoes of 
hidians, jLift coming on Shore. 

They made the befl of their Way Home, in Hur- 
ry enoug;hi and giving the Alarm to their Comrades, 
they kept clofeall that Day and the next, going out 
only a: Njght to make obfervation : But they had 
the good Luck to be miftakea,* for, wherever the 
Savages went, chey did not Land at that Time oa 
the Illand, but purflied fome other Delign. 

And now they had another Broil with the three 
'Englishmen \ one of which, a moli; turbulent Fellow; 
being in a R.3ge ac one oi the three Slav^^s, which 
I mencioned they had raken^j becaufe the Fel- 
low had not donefomething right whrch he bid him 
do, and feem'd a little uncradable in his fhowing 
him, drew a Hatchet our of a Frog Belt, in which 
he wore it by his Side^ and fell upon the poor Savage, 
hot to correft him, but to kill him. Oi.e of the 
'Sfaniavdsy who was by^ feeing him gbjc the Fellov/ a 
barbarous Cut with the Hatchet, which he aim'd ac 
his Head, but (truck into his Shoulder, fo that he 
thought he had cut the poor Creature's Arm off, ran 
to him, and entreating him not to murder the poor. 
Man, clapt in between him and the Savage, to pre- 
vent the Mjfchieh 

The Fellow being enraged the more at this, llruck 
at the Spaniard with his Hatchet, and fwore he 
would ferve him as he intended to ferve the Savage ; 
which the Spaniard perceivingj avoided the Blow; 
and with a Shovel which he had in his Hand, (for 
they were all working m the Field about their Corn- 
Land) knocked the Brute down : Another of the Eng- 
tijhmen running at the fam-c Time to help his Com- 
rade, knock'd the Sprniiard down j and then two 
Spaniards m.ore came h. to help their Man, and a 
third Englifioman fell in upon them. They had -none 
ot them any Fire-Arms, or any other Weapons but 
Hatchets ^'nd other Tools, except this third EngUfi^

man ; he had one of my old rufty Catlafhes^ with 
which he made at the two laft Spaniards; and wound- 
ed them both* This Fray fet the whole Family in. 
an Uproar, and more Help coming in, they took the 
threQEngliJIomcnFr\(onQrs* The next Qiieftion was. 
What (hould be done with them, they had been fo . 
often mutinous, and were fo furious, fo defperate, 
and fo idle withal, that they knew not what Courfe 
to take with them? for they were mifchievous to 
the heigheft Degree, and valued not what Hurt tliey 
did any Man ; fo that, in Ihort^ it was not fafe to 
live with them. 

The Spaniard, who was Governour, told them m 
fo many Words, That if they had been of his own 
Country he would have iiang*d them ; for all Laws 
and all Governours were to preferve Society j and 
thofe who were dangerous to the Society, ought to 
be expeird out of it ; but as they were EngUfimen^ 
and that it was to the generous liind nefs of an EngUjh" 
»2a?i2 that they all ow'd their Prefervaticn an Deliver- 
ance, he would ufe them with all poffible Lenity, and 
would leave them to the J'jdgment of the other two 
EngliJJjmeity who were their Countrymen. 

One of the two hotieft Englijhmen flood up, and 
faid', they defir'd it might not be left to them ; for, 
fays he, 1 am fure we ought to fentence them to the 
Gallows i and with that gives an Account how NAll 
Atkins^ one of the three, had propofed to have all the 
fvv^EnglijIomen join together, and murder ail the Spa- 
niards when they were in thei-r Sleep. 

When the Spanijh Governour tnis, he calls to 
William Atkins, How, Seignior Atkins, fays he, 
would you murder iis all ? What have you to fay 
to that ^ Tha: hardened Villain was fo far 
from denying it, that he faid it was true, and 
G-d d— m him they would do it ftill before they 
had done with them. Well, but Seignior Atkim, 
fays the Spaniard, What have v/e don© to you, 

that 



[ ^7 ] 

that you will kill us ? And what would yon get 
by killing us ? And what muii: we do to prevent your 
killing us? Muft we kill you, or you will kill us? 
Why will you put us to the Neceflity of this, Seig* 
nior Atkins ? fa) s the Spaniard very calmly and 
fmiling. 

Seignior Atkins was in fuch a Rage at the Spa- 
niard's making a Jcft of it, that had he not been 
held by three Men, and withal had no Weapons 
wkh him, it was thought he would have attempt- 
ed to have kill'd the Spaniard in the Middle of all 
the Company. 

This hair-brain'd Carriage oblig'd them to confi- 
der fenoufly what was to be done. The two Eng- 
iijlmen and the Spaniard who fav'd the poor Savage, 
was of the Opinion, that they (l:iould hang one of 
the three for an Example to the reft, and that, par- 
ticularly, it fliould be he that had twice attemp- 
ted to commit Murder with his Hatchet ,' and in- 
deed there was fome Reafon to believe he had done iv, 
for the poor Savage was in fuch a miferable Condi- 
tion with the Wound he had received, that it was 
thought he could not live. , ^ 

But the Governor Spaniard ftill faid No, it w^as 
ain Eiiglijhman that had fav'd all their Lives, and he 
would never confent to put a Engli(Ioman to Death, 
tho' he had murder'd half of them ; nay, he laid, 
if he had been kill'd himfelf by an Engli/hman^ and 
had Time left to fpeak, it (hould be, that they 
fcoiild pardon him- 

This was To pofitively fnfifted on by the Gover- 
nor Spamdrd^ that there was no gainfaying it ? and 
is merciful Councils ^re nioft apt to prevail where 
they are (o earneftly prefs'd, fo they ah came into it j 
but then it was to be condder^'d, what fhould be 
done to keep them from doing the Mi(chiet they de- 
fignM ; for all agreed, Governor and all, that Means 
were to be ufed for preferving the Soc.ety from Dan- 
ger i after a long Debate it was agreed, Firft, That 

E 2 ihey 



[68] 



they fliould be dtfarm^d, and not permitted to hav'd 
either Gun, or Powder, or Shot^ or Sword, or any 
Weapon, and fhould be rurn'd out of the Society, 
and left to live where they would, and how they 
would by themfelves ; but that none of the reft, ei- 
ther Spaniards or Englijhy Ihould converfe with them, 
fpeak with them, or have any Thing to do with 
them ,' that they Ihould be forbid to eome within 
a certain Diftance of the Place where the reft dwelt ; 
and that if they ofFer'd to commit any Diforder, fo 
as to fpoil, burn, kill, or deftroy any of the Corn, 
Plantings, Buildings, Fences, or Cattle belonging 
to the Society*, that they (hould dye without Mercy, 
and they would flioot them where-ever they could find 
them. 

The Governour, a Man of great Humanity, mu- 
fing upon the Sentence, coniiderM a little upon it^ 
and turning to the two honeft EngUJlomen faid. Hold ; 
you muft refled, that it will be long e*cr they can 
raife Corn and Cattle of their own, and they muft 
not ftarve ,• We muft therefore allow them Provi- 
lions, fo he caus'd to be added, That they fhould 
have a Proportion of Corn given them to laft them 
eight Months, and for Seed to fow, by which 
Time they might be fuppos'd to raifed feme of their 
own ; that they fhould have ^\x Mileh-Goats, four 
He-Goats, and fix Kids given them, as well for% 
prefent Subfiftence, as for a Store ,• and that they 
fhould have Tools given them for their Work in the 
Fields y fuch as, fix Hatchets, an Ax, a Saw, and 
the like : But they fhould have none of thefe 
Tools or Provifions, unlefs they would fwear folemti- 
ly, that they would not hurt or injure any of the ! 
Spaniards with them, or of their Fellow Englijlomeni j 

Thus they difmis'd them the Society, and turn'd i 
them out to fhift for themfelves. They went away \ 
fullen and refradory, as neither contented to go away, ij 
or to ftay ,* but, as there was no Remedy, they |i 
ivent, pretending to go and choofs a Place where 

they 



C<^9 3 



itliey would fettle themfelves to plant and live by 
tiiemfelves ; and fome Provifion were given them, buc 
no Weapons, 

About four or five Days after, they can^ie again for 
fome Viduais, and gave the Governour an Account 
where they had pitchM their Tents, and mark^'d 
themfelves out an Habitation and Plantation ,* and ic 
was a very convenient Place indeed, on the remot^ft 
Part of the Ifland, N. E« much about the Place 
where I providentially landed in my iirfl Voyage, 
when I was driven out to Sea, the Lord alone knows 
whedier, in my foolilh Attempt to furround thg 
Illand. 

Here they built themfelves two handfome Huts^ 
and contrived them, in a Manner,, like my firfl Ha- 
bitation, being clofe under the Side of a Hill, ha- 
ving fome Trees growing already on the three Sides 
of it, fo that by planting others, it would be very 
eafily cover'd from the Sight, unlefs narrowly fearch'd 
for ; they de(ir-d fome dry'd Goats-skins for Beds and 
Covering, which were given them ; and upon giving 
their Words, that they would not diflurb the reft^ 
pr injure any of their Plantations, they gave them 
Hatchets and what other Tools they could fpare | 
fome Peas, Barley, and Rice, for fowing, and, in a 
Word, any Thing they wanted^ but Arnas and Am^. 
munition. 

They iiv*d in this (eparate Condition about fix 
Months, and had gotten in. their firft Harveft, tho^ 
the Quantity was but fmall, the Parcel of Land they 
had planted being but little ,* for indeed, having all 
their Plantation to form, they had a great deal of 
Work upon their Hands ; and when they came to 
make Boards, and Pots, and fuch Things, they 
were quite out of their Element, and could make 
nothing of it ; and when the rainy Seafon came on, 
for want of a Cave in the Earth, they could not 
keep their Grain dry, and it was in great Danger of 
Cpoiling: And this humbled them much ; fo the|^ 

E 3 eame 



[ 70 ] 

came and begg'd the Spaniards to help them, which 
they very readily did, and in four Days work'd d 
great Hole in the Side of the Hill for them, big 
enough to fecure their Corn, and other Things from 
the Rain i but it was but a poor Place, at beft^ com- 
par'd to mine ; and efpecialiy as 'mine was then, for 
the Spaniards had greatly enlarged it, and made lev e= 
ral new Apartments in it. 

About three Qiiarters of a Year after this Separa- 
tion) a new Frolick took thefe Rogues, which, to- 
gether with the former Vil] any they had committed, 
brought Mifchief enough upon them, and had very 
near been the Ruin of.the whole Colony : The three 
hew Sociates began, it feems to be weary of the 
laborious Life they led, and that without Hope of 
bettering their Circumftances,* and a Whim took 
them, that they would make a Voyage to the Con- 
tinent from whence the Savages came, and would 
try if they could not feize upon fome Prifoners a* 
mong the Natives there, and bring them Home, fo 
to make them do the laborious Part of their Work for 
themo - - 

The Projed was not fo prepoflerous, if they had 
gone no farther ; but they did nothing, and proposxl 
nothing, but had either Mifchief in the Defign, or 
Mifchief in the Event : And if I may give my Opi- 
nion, they feero'd to be under a Blaft from Heaven / 
for if we will not allov^ a vifible Curfe to purfue vi/i- 
ble Crimes^ how fhall we reconcile the Events o£ 
Things with the Divine Juflice ; It was certainly an 
apparent Vengeance on their Crime of Mutiny and 
Piracy, that brought them to the State they were 
in J and as they (he w^ not the leafl Remorfe for 
the Crime, but added new Villanies to it, fqch as, 
particularly, the Piece of monftrous Cruelty of 
wounding a poor Slave, becaufe he did not, or per- 
Iiaps could not, underftand to do what he was di- 
direded ; 'and to wound him in fuch a Manner, as, 
toQueftion, made him a Cripple ail his Life i and in 



J 



a Place where no Surgeon or Medicine could be had 
for his Cure j and what was ftill worfe, the murde- 
rous Intent, or, to do Juftice to the Crime, the in-* 
tentional Murder, for fuch, to be fure it was, as 
was afterwards the form'd Defign they all laid, to 
murder the Spaniards m cold Blood, and in their 
iSleep. 

But I leave obferving, and return to the Story : 
The three Fellows comes down to the Spaniards one 
Morning, and in very humble Terms defir'd «to be 
admitted to fpeak with them : The Spaniards very 
readily heard what they had "to fay, which was thisj 
That they were tir'd of living in the Manner they 
did ,* that they were not handy enough to make the 
NecefTaries they wanted ; and that having no Help, 
they found they fhould be ftarvM : But if the Spa- 
mards would give them Leave to rake one of the Ca- 
noes which they came over in, and give them Arms 
and Ammunition, proportion'd for their DefencCi, 
they would go over to the Main, and feek their For- 
tune, and f6 deliver them from the Trouble of fupply- 
ing them with any other Provifions« 

The Spaniards were glad enough to be rid of them, 
but yet very honeftly reprefented to them the certain 
Deftrudion they were running into i told them, they 
had fufer'd fuch Hardfliips upon that very Spot, that 
they could, without any Spirit of Prophefy, tell them, 
that they w^ould be ftarv'd, or be murdep'd, and bad 
them confider of it. 

The Men reply'd audacioufly, they fhould be 
flarv'd it they flay'd here, for they could not w^ork, 
and would not work ; and they could but be ftarv^d 
Abroad, and ii they were murder'd, there was an 
End of them, they had no Wives or Children to 
cry after them i and in fhort, infilled importu- 
nately upon their Demand, declaring, that they 
would go, whether they would give them any Arm§ 
or no. 

E 4 The 



[70 



The Spamards told them, with great Kindne^ 
that if they were refolv'd to go, they fliould not go 
like naked Men, and be in no Condition to defend 
thenifelves ; and that though they could ill fpare 
their Fire- Arms, having not enough ior them- 
felves, yet they would let^them have two Muf- 
kets, a Piftol, and a Cutlalh, and each Man ^ Hatchet^ 
which they thought was fufficient for them. 

In a Word, they accepted the Offer, and having 
baked them Bread enough to ferve chem a Monthj 
and given them as much Goats- Flefli as they could 
eat while it was fweer, and a great Basket full of 
dry'd Grapes, a Pot full of frefh Water, and a 
young Kid alive to kill, they boldly fet out in a Ca- 
noe for a Voyage over the Sea, where it was at 
lead 40 Miles broad. ' 

The Boat was indeed a large one, and would have 
very well carry'd fifteen or twenty Men ; and, there- 
fore, was rather too big for them to manage: But 
ss they had a fair Breeze, and the Flood-Tide with 
them, they did well enough: They had made a 
Maft of a long Pole, and a Sail of four large Goat^ 
Skins dry'd, which they had fow'dorlac'd together; 
and away they went merily enough ,* the Spaniards 
caliM after them, Bon Veyajo ; and no Man ever 
thought of feeing then! any more. 

The Spaniards would often fay to one another, and 
the two honefl Englijh Men who remained behind, 
how quietly and comfortably they livM now thofe 
three turbulent Fellows were gone ; as for their ever 
coming again, that was the remoteft Thing from 
their Thoughts that could be imagin'd ; when be- 
hold, after two and twenty Days Abfence, one of 
the Englift} Men being abroad upon his Plantings 
Work, fees three ftrange Men coming toward him at 
a Diflance, with Guns upon their Shoulders. 
• Away runs the Englijh Man, as if he was be- 
witched, comes frighted and amaz'd to the Go- 
verupur Spaniard^ and tells him they were all un- 
V ..... . . • ... doncj

done, for there were Strangers landed upon the |- 
fland, he could not tell who : Th^ Spaniard y pau- 
(ing a while, fays to him. How do you mean, you 
cannot tell who ? They are the Savages to be fure, 
"j^o, no, fays the Englijhman^ they are Men in Cloaths 
with Arms ; Nay? then, fays the Sfaniard, why are 
you concerned ? If they are not Savages they muft be 
Friends, for there is no Chriflian Nation upon Earth 
but will do us Gooci rather than Harm. 
^ While they were debating thus, comes the three 
Englifhmen, and {landing without the Wood, which 
Was new planted, hallo'd to them ; they prefently 
knew their Voices, and fo all the Wonder of that 
kind ceas'd. But now the Admiration was turn 'd 
upon another Queftion, (njiz..) what could be the 
Matter, and what made them come back again ? 

It Vv as not long before they brought the Men in^ 
and enquiring where they had been, and what they 
had been doing, they gave them a full Account of 
their Voyage in a few Words, (viz,^) That they 
reach'd the Land in two Days, -or fomething lefs, 
but finding the People alarmM at their coming, and 
preparing with Bows and Arrows to fight them, 
they durft not go on Shore, but faifd on to the 
Korthward fix or feven Hours, till they came to a 
great Opening, by which they perceiv'd,- that the 
Land they faw from our Ifland was not the Main, 
but an Ifland ; that entring that Opening of the Seai 
they faw another Ifland on the Righthand North, and 
feveral more Weft j and being refolv'd.to land fome-' 
where, they put over to one of the Iflands which 
lay Weft, and went boldly on Shore ; that they 
found the People very courteous and friendly to 
them, and that they gave them feveral Roots and 
fome dry'd Fifh, and appeared very fociable, and 
the Women, as well as the Men, were very forward 
to fupply them with any thing they could get for 
them to eat, and brought it to them a great Way 
tipon their Heads« 
V. ■ ■■ ■ ■ -- They 



[ 74 ] 

They contlnu'd here four Days, sind enquirM, z$ 
y/ell as they could of them, by Signs, what Nations 
were, this Way, and that Way ; and were told of 
fcveral fierce and terrible People that liv'd almoft eve- 
ry Way ; who, as they made known by Signs tQ 
them, ufed to eac Men ,♦ but as for themfelves, they 
laid, that they never eat Men or Women, except on^ 
iy fuch as they took in the Wars, and then they own'd 
that they made a great Feaft, and eat their Prifo- 
Ders. 

The Englijh Men enquired when they had a Feaft 
of that Kind, and they told them two Moons ago^ 
pointing to the Moon, and then to two Fingers i 
and that their great King had two hundred Prifoner^ 
nowj which he had taken in his War ; and they 
were feeding them to make them far, for the next 
Feaft. The Englijh Men feem'd mighty defirous to 
fee thofe Prifoners, but the other miftaking them, 
thought they were defirous to have fome of them, to 
carry away for their own eating. So they beckon'd 
to them, pointing to the Setting of the Sun, and 
f^ then to the riiing, which was to fignify, that the 
next Morning at Sun-ri(ing they would bring fome 
for them j and accordingly the next Morning they 
troughc down five Women and eleven Men, and gave 
them to the English Men, to carry with them on 
their Voyage, jud as we would bring fo many Cow§ 
and Oxen down to a Sea-Port TowUj, to vidual a 
Ship. 

As brutilh and barbarous as thefe Fellows were 
at home, their Stomachs turn'd at this Sight, and 
they ^i^ not know what to do j to refufe the Prifa- 
ners, would have been the highefl Affront to the fa- 
vage Gentry that offer'd them '-, and what to do with 
them, they knew not ,• however, upon fome Debates, 
they refolved to accept of them, and in Return, they 
gave the Savages' that brought them one of their 
Hatchets, an old Key, a Knife, and fix or feven of 
their Bullets, which though they did not underfland, 

?hey 



E 1\ ] 

they feem'd extreamly pleas'd with t And then ty- 
ing the poor Creatutes Hands behind them,they (the 
People) dragg'd the Prifoners into the Boat for our 
Men. 

The Englifi Men were oblig'd to come away as 
foon as they had them, or elfe they that gave them 
this noble Preferrt, would certainly have expeded 
that they fiiould have gone to work with them, have 
kilf d two or three ot them the next Morning, and 
perhaps have invited the Donors to Dinner. 

But having taken their Leave with ail the Re- ^. 
ipeds, and Thanks that could well pafs between # 
iPeople, where on either Side they underftood not 
6r\Q Word they could fay, they put off with their 
Boat, and came back towards the firfl Idand ,* where 
when they arrived, they kz eight of their Prifoners 
at Liberty, there being too many of them for theii: 
Occafibn. 

' In their Voyage, they endeavoured to have foijie 
Communication with their Prifoners, but it was im- 
-poflible to make them underfland any Thing ; No- 
thing they could fay to them, or give them, or do 
for them, but was look'd upon as going about to 
murder them. They firfl of all unbound them, but 
the poor Creatures skream'd at that, efpecially the 
Women, as if they had jufl felt the Kife at their 
Throats j for they immediately concluded, they 
were unbound on purpofe to be kill'd. 
' If they gave them any Thing to eat, it was the 
fame Thing ; then they concluded it was for Fear 
they fhouid fink in Flefh, and fo not be fat enough 
to kill. If they look'd at one of them more particu- 
larly, the Party prefently concluded, it was to fee 
whether he or (he was fattefl:, and fittefl to kill firft. 
Nay, after thty had brought them quite over, and 
began to ufe them kindly, and treat them well, ftill 
they expeded every Day* to make a Dinner or a 
Supper for their new Mafiers, 
- • Whea

When the three Wanderers had given this unac- 
countable Hiftory, or Journal oFthdr Voyage, the 
Spaniard askM them. Where their new Family was B 
and being told that they had brought them on Shore, 
and put them into one of their Huts, and were 
come up to beg fome Vidiials for them ; they (the 
Spaniards) and the other two Rngli'ibmeny that is to 
fay, the whole Colony, refolv'd to go all down to th^ 
Place and fee them, and did fo, and Fridays Father 
with them. 

When they came into the Hut, there they fate slU 
bound ; for when they had brought them on Shore, 
they bound their Hands that they might not take 
the Boat and make their efcape. There, I fay, they 
fate, all oF them ft ark naked : Fir ft ^ There were three 
Men, lufty comely Fellows, well fliaped^ flrait and 
fair Limbs, about thirty to thirty five Years of Age ; . 
and five Women, whereof two might be from thirty 
fo forty, two more not above four or five and twenty, 
and the fifth, a tail comely Maiden about fixreen or fe- 
venteen : The Women v/ere well favoured agreeable 
terfons both in Shape and Features, only ta\^ny, and 
two of them, had they been perked White, would have 
pafs^dfor very handfome Women,even in London it(cl[\ 
having pleafanc agreeable Countenances and oi a very 
modeft Behaviour, efpecially when they came af- 
terwards to be cloath'd, and drefs'd, as they cair4 
it-i tho*that Drefswas ver^ndifferent it muftbe con- 
fefs^d ; of which hereafter. 

The Sight, you may be fure, was fomething un- 
couth to our SpaniardSy who v/ere Cto give them a 
|u{i CharaSer) Men of fihe bed: Behaviour; of the 
moil calm, fedate Tempers, and perfed Gcod-hi»- 
mour that ever I met with ; and in particular, of 
the mofl Modefcy^ as will prefently appear : I fay, 
the Sight was very uncouth, to fee two naked Men 
and five naked Women, all together bound, and in 
a moft miferable Circumftances that Human Nature 
coiiid be fuppos'd to be, vix> to be cxpetfting every 

Momeut

iioment to be tiragg'd out, and have their Brains 
knocked out, and then to be eaten up like a Calf 
that is kill'd for a Dainty. 

The firft Thing they did, was to caufc the old 
Indiatiy Friday's Father, to go in and fee firfi if he 
knew any of them, and then if he underilood any of 
their Speech : As foon as the old Man came in, he 
look'd fcrioufly at them, but knew none of them ; 
neither could any of them underftand a Word he 
faid, or a Sign he could make, except one of the 
Women. 

However, this was enough to anfwer the End, 
which was to fatisfy them, tnat the Men into whofe 
Hands they were fallen, were Chriilians; that they 
abhorr'd earing of Men or Women, and that they 
might be fure they would not be kill'd : As foon as 
they were afllir'd of this, they difcover'd (uch a Joy^ 
and by fjch aukward, and feveral Ways, as h hard to 
defcribe ; for it feems they were of feveral Nations^ 

The Woman, who was their Interpreter, was 
bid in the next Place to ask them, if they were wil- 
h"ng to be Servants, and to Work for the Mc^n who 
had brought them away, to fave their Lives ; at 
which they ail fell a Dancing ; and prefenily one 
fell to taking up this, and another that, any Thing 
that lay next, to carry on their Shoulders, to inti- 
mate chat they were willing to Work. 

The Governour, who found, that the having Wo- 
men among them would prefently be attended with 
fome Inconvenience, and might Occadonfome Strife, 
and perhaps Biood j ask'd the three Men, what they 
intended to do with thefe V/omen, and how they 
intended to ufe them i v;^ether as Servants, or as 
Women ? One of the Engljfbmen anfwer'd very bold- 
ly and readily, That they would ufe them as both. 
To which the Governour faid, i am not a going to 
reflrain you from it, you are your own Mailers as 
to that : But this 1 think is bur juft, for avoiding J^K- 
orders and Qiiarrels among you 3 and I dciire it of 



[78] 



you, for that Reafon only, viz.. That you will all 
engage, that if any of you take any of thefe Women, 
as a Woman or Wife, that he iliall take but one ; and 
that having taken one, none elfe fhould touch her / 
for tho' we cannot matry any of you, yet 'tis but rea!- 
fonable, that while you ftay here, the Women any 
of you takes, (hotildbe maintain'd by the Man that 
takes her, and fhould be his Wife y 1 mean, fays 
he, while he continues here, and that none elfe fhal! 
have any Thing to do with her: Ail this appeared 
io Juft, chat every one agreed to it without any Di- 
fficuity. 

Then the Englijhmen ask'd the Spdhmrds, if they 
defign'd to take any of them ? But every one anfwer- 
ed N O : Some of them faid,they had Wives in Spain; 
and the others did not like Women that were not 
Chriftians; and all together declarM, that they 
would not touch one o^ theiii ; which was an 
Inilance of fuch Virtue, as I have not met with 
in all my Travils. On the other Hand, to be 
fhort, the five Englijlomen took them every one a Wife^ 
that is to fay> a temporary Wife i and fo they 
fet up a new Form of Living j for thQ Spaniards and 
Friday's Father liv'd in my old Habitation, which 
they had enlarged exceedingly within. The three Ser- 
vants which we taken in the lace Battle oF the Sal- 
vages, liv'd with them ,* and thefe carry^d on the 
main Part of the Colony, fupplying all the reft with' 
Food, and alTifting them in any Thing asthey couldi 
or as they found fJeceflicy requirM. 

But the Wonder ot this Story was, how five fuch 
refradory ill matched Fellows fhould agree abouc 
thefe Women, and rhat two of them fhould not pitch' 
upon the fame Woman, efpecially feeing two or three 
of them were, without Comparilon, more agreea- 
ble than the other : But they took a good Way enough' 
toprevent quarreling among themfelves ; for they fet 
the rive Women by themfelves in one of their Huts^- 
and they went all into the other Hut, and drew Lots 
among them, who £iould chufe firft. H^ 



[79 ] 

He that drew to chufe firfl:, went away by him- 
felf to the But where the poor naked Creatures were, 
and tetchM out her he chofe j and it was worth ob- 
fervingjthat he that chofe firft took her that was reck- 
on'd the homelieft, and the oldeft ot the five, which 
made mirth enough among the reft ; and even the 
Spaniards laughed at it : but the Fellow confider'd 
better than any of them, that was Appl'cation and 
Bufinefs that they were to exped Affiftance in, as 
much as any Thing elfe j and fiie provM the befl Wife 
of all the Parcel. 

When the poor Women faw themfelves fet in a Row 
thus, and fecch'd out one by one, the Terrors of their 
Condition returned upon them again, and they firmly 
believ'd that they were now a going to be devour'd f 
accordingly,when the&^/z/^^Sailor came in and fetched 
out one ot them ,• the refl fet up a moil lamentable 
Cry, and hung about her, and took their Leave of 
her with fuch Agonies and fuch AfFedion, as would 
have griev'd the hardeft Heart in the World; nor 
was it poiTible for the Englijhmen to fatisfy them, that 
were not to be immediately murder d, 'till they 
fetch'd the old Man, Friday's Father, who imme- 
diately lee them know that the five Men, who had 
fetch'd them Out one by one, had ehofen them far 
their Wives. 

When they had done, and the Fright the Women 
Were in was a Tittle over, the Men vv^ent to Work, and 
she Spaniards came and help'd themj and in a tew 
Hours they had built them every one anew Hut or 
Tent (or their Lodging apart ; for thofe they had al- 
ready, were crowded with their Tools, Houfhold- 
Stuft-5 and Provifion. The three wicked Ones had 
pitched farthefl off, and the two honed Ones nearer, 
but both on the North Shore oF the iiland, fo that 
they continued feparate as before : And thus my 
Ifland was peopled in three Places ; and as I might: 
lay^ three Towns were begun to be planted. 

And 



And here 'tis very well worth obferving, That 
as it often happens in the World (what the wife Ends 
of God's Providence are in fuch a Dirpoiition of 
Things, I cannot fay) the two honell Fellows had the 
two worft Wives, and the three Reprobates, that 
was fcarce worth hanging, that were fit for nothings 
and neither feem'd born to do themfelves Good, or j 
any one elfe, had three clever, diligent, careful, anj 
ingenious Wives ; not that the two Rril were ill 
Wives, as to their Teihper or Humour -y for all the 
five were mod willing, quiet, paffive, and fubjeded 
Creatures^ rather like Slaves than Wives ; but n:iy 
Meaning is, they were not alike capable, ingenious, 
or induftrious, or alike cleanly and neato 

Another Obfervation i muft make, to the Ho- 
nour of a diligent Application on one Hand, and to 
the Difgrace of a flothful, negligent, idlt Temper, 
on the other^ th^t when I came to the Place, and I 
viewed the feveral Improvements, Plantings, and ; 
Management of the feveral little Colonies ; the two 
Men had fo far out^gone the three, that there was 
no CompariTon ; they had indeed both of them as 
much Ground laid out for Corn as rhey wanted • 
and the Reafon was, becaufc, according to my Rule, 
Nature di<5cated, that it v^^as to no Purpofw to fow^ , 
more Corn than they wanted, but the Difference of 
the Cultivation, of the Planting, of the Fences, and 
indeed of every Thing elfe was eafy to be fcen at 
firft View. 

The two Men had innumerable young Trees 
planted about their Huts, that when you came to 
the Place, nothing was to be feen but a Wood, and ! 
the' they had twice had their Plantation demolifli'd, 
once by their own Countrymen, and once by the 
Enemy, as fhall be fliewn in its Place ; yet they had 
reflor'd all again, and every Thing was thriving and 
flourifliing about them ; they had Grapes planted in 
Order and manag'd like a Vineyard, tho' they had 
themfelves never feen any Thing of that Kind j and 

by 



[ 8i ] 

by their good ordering tlieit' Vines, their Grapes 
were as good again as any of the others. They had 
alfo found themfcives out a Retreat in the thickefl 
Part of the Woods, where, though there was not a 
natural Cave, as I had found, yet they made one 
with inceifant Labour of their Hands, and where 
when the Mifchief which follow'd happen^, they 
fecur'd their Wives and Children, fo as they could 
never be found j they having by flicking innumerable 
Stakes and Poles of the Wood^ which as I faid, 
grew fo eafily, made the Grove unpafTable, except 
in fome Places, where they climb'd up to get over 
the ou tilde Parti and then went on by Ways of theic ' 
own leaving. 

As to the three Reprobates, as I juflly call thems 
tho' they were much civilized by their new Settle- 
ment, compared to what they were before, and were 
not fo quarrelfom, having not the fame Opportu- 
nity j yet one of the certain Companions of a pro- 
fligate Mind never left them, and that was their 
Idlenefs. It is true, they planted Corn, and made 
Fences ; but Solomon s Words were never better ve- 
rified than in them : I went hy the Vineyard of the Sloth- 
ful ^ and it was all over-grown with 'Thorns; tor when 
the Spaniards came to view their Crop, they could 
not fee it in fome Places for Weeds ; the Hedge had 
feveral Gaps in it, where the wild Goats had got- 
ten in, and eaten up the Corn ,* perhaps, here and 
there, a dead Bufh was cramm'd in, to flop them 
out for the Prefent, but it was only Ihutting the Sta- 
ble-door after the Sreed was floln* WhereaSj wheii 
they lookM on the Colony of the other two, there 
was the very Face of Induftry and Succefs upon all 
they did ; there was not a Weed to be feen in all 
their Corn, or a Gap in any of their Hedges : And 
they on the other Hand verify 'd Solomons Words ia 
another Place, That the diligent Hand makes rich j for 
every Thing grew and thriv'd, and they had Plenty 
within and without ; they had no morejame Cattle 

F thaa 



[8i ] 

than the other, more Utenfils and Neceffaries with« 
in Doors, and yet more Pleafure and Diverfion coo» 

It is true, the Wives of the three, were very han- 
dy and cleanly within Doors, and having learn'd the 
Englijh Ways of Dreffing and Cooking from one of 
the other Enghflo Men, who, as I faid, was CookV i 
mate on board the Ship, they drefs'd their Husbands 
Viduals very nicely and well i whereas the other 
could not be brought to underftand it; but then the 
Husband, who, as I faid, had been CookV mate, 4id 
it himfelf j but as for the Husbands of three Wives, 
they ioyter'd about, fetch'd Turtles Eggs, and caught : 
Filh and Birds ; in a Word any Thing but Labour, 
and they far^d accordingly. The Diligent livM well 
and comfortably, and the Slothful liv'd hard and 
beggarly ; and fo I believe, generally fpeaking, it is 
all over the World. 

But now I come to a Scene, different from all that 
had happenM before, either to them, or to me j and 
the Original of the Story was this : 

Early one Morning there came on Shore five or fix 
Canoes oi IrJians^ or Savages^ call them which you 
pleafe ? and there is no room to doubt that they 
came upon the old Errand of feeding upon their 
Slaves : But that Part was now fo familiar to the 
Spaniards, and to our Men too, that they did not 
concern themfelves about it, as I did ; but having 
been made fenfible by their Experience, that their 
only Bufinefs was to lie conceal'd, and that if they 
were not k^n by any of the Savages, they would go 
off again quietly when their Bufinefs was done, ha- 
ving as yet not the leaft Notion of there being any 
Inhabitants in the Ifland j I fay, having been made 
fenfible of this, they had nothing to do but to give 
Notice to all the three Plantations, to keep within 
Doors, and not fhew themfelves, only placing a Scout 
in a proper Place, to giw^ Notice when the Boats 
yeai to Sea ag^inc. 

This 



[8i] 



This was without doubt very right ; but a Difafter 
fpoii'd all thefe Meafures, and made it knowa 
among the Savages, that there were Inhabitants 
there, which was in the End the Defolation of al- 
moil the whole Colony ; after the Canoes with the 
Savages were gone off^ the Spaniards peep'd abroad 
again, and fome of them had the Curiofity to go to 
the Place where they had been, to fee what they 
had been doing : Here, to their great Surprize^ 
they found three Savages left behind, and lying faft 
afleep upon the Ground ; it wasfuppos^d, they had 
either been fo gorg'd with their inhuman Feaft* 
that, like Beads, they were afleep^ and would not 
ilir when the others went, or they were wander'd 
into the Woods, and did not come back in time to 
be taken in. 

The Spaniards were greatly furpriz'd at this Sights 
and perfedly at a Lofs what to do ; the Spa-- 
niard Governour, as it happened, was with them^ 
and his Advice was ask^'d, but he profefs^d he knew 
not what to do j as for Slaves, they had enough al- 
ready, and as to killing them, they were none 
of them inclined to that j the Spaniard Governout! 
told me, they could not chink of fhedding innocent 
Blood, for as to them, the poor Creatures had done 
them no Wrong, invaded none of their Proper. y, aiid 
they thought they had no ju(t Quarrel againft chem^ 
to take away their Lives. 

And here I muft, in Juflice to thefe Spaniards^ 
obferve, that let the Accoa ::s of .^pani(h Crueky 
in Mexico and Peru^ be what chey will, I never met 
with feventeen Men of any Nation whatfocver, in 
any foreign Country, who were fo univerlally Mo- 
deft, Temperate, Virtuous, fo very Good-hu> 
mour'd, and fo Courteous as i:\.)c(q Spaniards ; and 
as to Cruelty they had nothmg of it in their very 
Nature ; no Inhumanity, no Barbarity, no outra- 
gious Paffions, and yet ail of them Men of great 
Courage and Spirit. 

F z Their 



[84] 

Their Temper and Calmnefs had appeared, in 
their bearing the unfufFerable Ufage of the three 
Engli(hmen , and their Juftice and Humanity ap- 
peared now in the Cafe of the Savages, as above. 
After fome Confuitation, they refolvM upon this, 
that they would lie fiill a while longer, ^till, if pof- 
iible, thefe three Men might be gone ; but then the 
Governour Spaniard recolleded, that the three Sa- 
vages had no Boat, and that if they were left to 
rove about the ifland, they would certainly difcover 
that there were Inhabitants in iXy and fo they Ihould 
be undone that Way. 

Upon this, they went back again, and there lay 
the Fellows faft afleep dill, fo they refolv'd to wa- 
ken them, and take them Prifoners, and they did 
•fo ; the poor Fellows were flrangcly frighted 
when they were feiz'd upon and bound, and a- 
fraid, like the Women, that they fhould be mur- 
der'd and eaten ; for it feems thofe People think all 
the World does as they do, eating Mens Flefh ,• but 
they were foon made eafy as to that, and away they 
carry'd them. 

It was very happy to them that they did not carry 
them Home to their Caftle. I mean to my Palace un- 
det the Hill j but they carry'd them firff to the 
Bower,, where was the chief of their Country-work, 
fuch as the keeping the Goats, the planting the Corn, 
CiTc. and afcerwards, they carried them to the Habi- 
tation of the two Englijhmen. 

Here they werefet to work, tho' it was not much 
they had for them to do -, and whether it was by 
Negligence in guarding them, or that they thought 
the Fellows could not mend themfelves, I know not, 
but one of them run away, and taking into the 
Woods, they could never hear of him more. 

They had good Reafon to believe he got Home 
again foon after, in fome other Boats or Canoes ; 
oT Savages, who came on Shore three or four 
Weeks afterwards, and who, carrying on their Re- 
vels ! 



[85] 

vels as ufual, went off again in two Days time : 
This Thought terrify 'd them exceedingly ; for they 
concluded, and that not without good Caufe indeed, 
that is if this Fellow came fafe Home among his 
Comrades, he would certainly give them an Account 
that there were People in the Ifland, as alfo how 
few and weak they were ,* for this Savage, as I ob- 
ferv'd before, had never been toldr arid it was very 
happy he had not^ how many they were, or where 
they liv'd; nor had he evQC feen or heard the 
Fire of any of their Guns, much \q[s had they 
(hewn him any of their other retir'd Places fuch as the 
Cave in the Valley, or the new Retreat which the 
two Englijlo?nen had made, and the like. 

The firft Teftimony they had that this Fellow 
had given Intelligence of them, was, that about 
two Months after this, fix Canoes of Savages, with 
about feven, or eight, or ten Men in a Canoe, 
came rovv^ing along the North-Side of the Ifland, 
where they never ufed to come before, and landed 
about an Hour after Sun-rife, at a convenient Place 
about a Mile from the Habitation of the two Eng- 
lijhmeny where this efcap'd Man had been kept: 
As the Spaniard Govern our faid, had they been 
all there, the Damage would not have been (o 
much, for not a Man of them would have efcaped; 
but the Cafe diff^r'd now very much, for two Men 
to fifty was too much odds : The two Men had 
the Happinefs to difcover them about a League 
off, fo that it was above an Hour before they 
landed, and as they landed a Mile from their 
Huts, it was fome time before they could come 
at them: Now having great Reafon to believe 
that they were betray^, the firft Thing they (iid, 
was to bind the tv/o Slaves which were left^ anci 
caufe two of the three Men, who they brough^ 
with the Women, who it feems prov'd very faith-^ 
iul tQ them, to kad them with their two Wives, 
F I and 



IhJ 



and what ever they could carry away with them^ to 
their retir'd Place in the Woods, which I have fpo- 
ken of above, and there to bind the two Fellows 
Hand and Foot ^till they heard farther. 

In the next Place, feeing the Savages were all come 
on Shore, and that they bent their Courfe diredly 
that Way, they open'd the Fences where their Milch- 
Goats v/ere kept, and drove them all out, leaving 
their Goats to ftragglc into the Wood, whither they 
pleasM, that the Savages might think they were all 
bred wildi but the Rogue who came with them 
was too cunning for that, and gave them an Account 
of it all; for they went directly to the Place. 

When the two poor frighted Men had fecur'd their 
Wives and Goods, they fent the other Slave they had 
of the three, who came with the Women, and who 
was at their Place by Accident, away to the Spam- 
ardsy with all Speed, to giv^ them the Alarm, and 
defire fpeedy Help ,* and in the mean Time they took 
their Arms, and what Ammunition they had, and re- 
treated to\v^Eds the Place in the Wood, where their 
Wives were fent, yeeping at a Diflance, yet fo that 
they might fee if poilible, which way the Savages 
took. 

They had not gone far, but that, from a rifing 
Ground, they could fee the little Army of their Ene- 
mies come on diredly to their Habitation, and in a 
Moment more, could fee ail their Huts and Houfhoid- 
Stuff framing up together, to their great Grief and 
Mortification^ for they had a very great Lofs, to 
them irretrievable, at leaf]: for fome Time. They 
kept their Station for a while, \\\\ they found the 
Savages, like wild Beafls, fpread themfelves all over 
t.ie Place, rumaging every Way, and every Place 
they could think of, in fearch for Prey, and in par- 
ticular for the People, of whom it now plainly ap- 
peared they had Intelligence^^ 

The 



The two Englijhmen feeing this, thinking them* 
lelves not fecure where they (lood, becaufe as it 
was likely fome of the wild People might come that 
Way, fo they might come too many together^ thought 
it proper to make another Retreat about half^ a 
Mile farther, believing, as it afterwards happened, 
that the farther they ftroll'd, the fewer would be 
together^ 

The next Halt was at the Entrance into a very 
thick grown Part of the Woods, and where an old 
Trunk of a Tree flood, which was hollow andvaftly 
larger and in this Tree they both took their ftand- 
ing, refolving to fee there what might offer. 

i hey had not flood there long, but two of the 
Savages appear'd running diredly that Way, as if 
they had already had Notice where they flood, and 
were coming up to attack them ; and a little Way 
farther, they fpy'd three more coming after them, 
^nd five more beyond them, all coming the fame 
Way ; befides which, they faw feven or eight 
more at a Diftance, running another Way ; for in a 
Word, they ran every Way like Sportfmen beating 
for their Game. 

The poor Men were now in great Perplexity, whe- 
ther chey Ihould ftand and keep their Pofture, or fly: 
But after a very fliort Debate with themfelves, they 
fonfider'd, that if the Savages rang'd the Country 
phus before Help came, they might perhaps find out 
their Retreat in the Woods, and then all would be 
loft ; fo they refolv'd to ftand them there ; and if 
they were too many to deal with, then they would 
get up to the Top of the Tree, from whence they 
doubted not to defend themfelves. Fire excepted, as 
long as their Ammunition lafted, though all the Sa- 
vages that were landed, which was near fifty, were 
to attack them. 

Having refolv'd upon this, they next cOnflderd, 

whether they fiiould fire at the lirfl two, or wait 

for the three, and fo take the middle Party, by 

F 4 which 



[88 ] 



which the two and the five that follow^ would be 
feparated ; at length they refolvM to let the two 
firft pafs by, unlefs they fhould fpy them in the 
Tree, and come to attack them. The two firfi: Sa- 
vages alfo confirmed them in this Regulation, by 
turning a little from them towards another Part of 
the Wood ; but the three, and the five after them, 
came forwards dirediy to the Tree, as if they had 
known the EngUJhmen were there. 

Seeing thenn come fo llrait towards them, they re- 
folv-d to take them in a Line, as they came ; and as 
they refolv'd to fire but one at a Time, perhaps the 
firfl Shot might hit them all three ; to which pur- 
pofe, the Man who was to fire, put three or four 
Bullets into his Piece, and having a fair Loop-hole, 
as it were, from a broken Hole in the Tree, he took ' 
a fure Aim, without being feen, waiting till they j 
were within about thirty Yards of the Tree, fo that 
he could not mifs. 

While they were thus waiting, and the Savages 
came on, they plainly faw, that one of the three 
^as the Run-away Savage that had efcap'd from 
them, and they both knew him diflinftly, and re-? 
folv'd, that if pofBble, he fhould not efcape, tho' 
they fliould both fire ; fo the other flood ready with 
his Piece, that ii he did not drop at the firfl Shot, 
he fhould be fure to have a fecond. 

But the firfl was too good a Markfman to mifs his 
Aim j for as the Savages kept near one another, a 
little behind in a Line ; in a Word, he iir^d, and hie 
two of them directly : The foremoft was killed 
outright, being fhot in the Head : The fecond, which 
was the run-away Indian^ was (hot through the Bo- 
dy, and fell, but was not quite dead : And the 
'third had a little Scratch in the Shoulder, perhaps by 
the fame Ball that went through the Body of th« 
fecond, and being dreadfully frighted, though not 
much hurt, fat down upon the Ground, skreaming 
and yelling in a hideous manner. 
^ • ' The 



[89 ] 



The five that were behind,more frighted with the 
Noife than fcnfible of the Danger, flood ftill at firft; 
for the Woods made the Sound a thoufand Times 
bigger than it really was ; the Echo's ratth'ng from 
one Side to another, and the Fowls rifing from all 
Parts, skreaming and making, every Sort, a fcve- 
ral Kind of Noife, according to their Kind, juft as 
it was when I fir'd the firft Gun that perhaps wa§ e" 
ver (hot off in that Place (ince it was an Ifland« 

However, all being filenc again, and they not 
knowing what the Matter was, came on uncon- 
cern'd, 'till they came to the Place where their Com- 
panions lay in a Condition miferable enough : And 
here the poor ignorant Creatures, not feqlible that 
they were within Reach of the fame Mifchief, flood 
all of a Huddle over the wounded Man, talking^ 
and, as may be fuppos'd, enquiring of him, how he 
came to be hurt ; and who, 'tis very rational to be- 
lieve, told them, that a Flafh of Fire firfl, and imme- 
diately after that. Thunder from their Gods, had kil- 
Vd thofe two, and wounded him : This 1 fay, is ra- 
tional ; for nothing is more certain than that, as they 
fawno Man near them, fo they had never heard a 
Gun in all their Lives, or fomuch as heard of a Gun; 
neither knew they any Thing of killing or wounding, 
at a Diflance, with Fire and Bullets ; if they had, 
one might reafonably believe, they would not have 
flood fo unconcern 'd, in viewing the Fate of their 
Fellows, without fome Apprehenfion of their own. 

Our two Men, tho' as they confefs'd to me, it 
griev'd them to beoblig'd to kill fo many poor Crea- 
tures, who, at the fame Time, had no Notion of 
their Danger ; yet having them all thus in the Power, 
and the firfl having loaded his Piece again ^ refolv'd 
to let fly both together among them ; and fingling 
out, by Agreement, which to aim at, theyfhot toge- 
ther, and kill'd or very much wounded four ofthera ; 
the fifth, frighted even to Death, tho' not hurt, fell 

with 



[39] 

With the reft ; fo that our Men feeing them all fall to- 
gether, thought they had kill'd them all. 

The Belief that the Savages were all kill'd, made 
our two Men come boldly out from the Tree before 
they had charg'd their Guns again, which was a 
wrong Step ; and they were under fome Surprize 
when they came to the Place, and found no lefs than 
four of the Men alive, and of them two very little 
hurt, and one not at all : This oblig'd them to fall 
upon them with the iStocks of their Muskets ; and 
firft they made fure bi the run away Savage, that 
had been the Caufe of all the Mifchief^ and of ano? 
ther that was hurt in his Knee, and put them out of 
their Pain ; then the Man that was not hurt at ail, 
came and kneel'd down to them, With his two Hand§ 
held up, and made pitepus Moans to them by Gef- 
tures and Si^ns, for his Life ; but could not fay one 
V/ord to^them that they could underftand. 

However, they Hgnd to him to fit down at the 
Foot of a Tree thereby ; and one of the Englijhmeny 
with a Piece of Rope Twine which he had, by 
great Chance, in his Pocket, ty'd his two Feet fall: 
together, and his two Hands behind him, and there 
they left him ; and, with what Speed they 
could, made after the other two, which were gone 
before; fearing they, or any more of them, fhould 
find the Way to their cover'd Place in the Woods, 
where their Wives, and the few Goods they had left 
lay. They came once in Sight of the two Men, but 
it was at a great Diflance ; however, they had the 
Satisfaction to fee them crofs over a Valley towards 
the Sea, the quite contrary Way from that which 
l^d to their Retreat, which they were'afraid of; and 
being fatisfy^'d with that, they went back to the Tree, 
where they left their Prifoner, who, as they fuppos'd, 
was deliver^ by his Comrades ; for he was gone, 
and the two Pieces of Rope-Yarne, with which they 
had bound him, lay jufi at the Foocof the Tree. 

They 



C90] 

They were now in as great a Concern as before, 
not knowing what Courfe to take, or how near the 
Enemy might be> or in what Numbers ,* fo they 
refolv'd to go away to the Place where their Wives 
were, to fee if all was well there, and to make 
them eafy, who were in Fright enough to be fure ; 
for tho' the Savages were their own Country Folk^ 
yet they were molt terribly afraid of them, and per- 
haps the more, for the Knowledge they had of 
them. 

When they come there, they found the Savages 
had been in the Wood, and very near that Place, 
but had not found it ; for it was indeed inacceilible, 
by the Trees (landing fo thick, as before, unlefs the 
Perfons feeking it had been direded by thofe that 
knew it, which thefe did not,* they found there- 
fore every Thing very fafe, only the W^omen in a ter- 
rible fright : Wjiile they were here, they had the 
Comfort of feven of the Spaniaydi come to their Afli- 
ftance ; the other ten, with their Servants, and old 
Friday y I m^mPridayh Father were gone in a Body 
to defend their Bower, and the Corn, and Cattle 
that was kept there, in Cafe the Savages fhould have 
rov'd over to that Side of the Country ; but they did 
not fpread fo far. V/ith the feven Spaniards came 
one of the three Savages, who, as I faid, were their 
Prifoners formerly *, and with them alfo came the Sa- 
vage, who the Englifl:>men had left bound Hand and 
Foot at the Tree ; for it feems they came that Way, 
faw the Slaughter of the feven Men, and unbound 
the eighth, and brought him along with them ; where 
however, they were obliged to bind him again^ 
as thfey had the two others, who were left when the 
third run away. 

The Prifoners began now to be a Burden to them i 
and they were fo afraid of their efcaping^ that they 
were under an abfolute Neceffity to do fo, for theit 
Qwn Prefervation : However, the Spaniard Gover- 
nour would not confent to iCj but ordered for the 

pre- 



[9^1 

prefent, that they fhould be fent out of the Way, to my 
old Cave in the Valley, and be kept there with two 
Spaniards to guard them, and give them Food for 
their Subiiftence, which was done; and they were 
bound there Hand and Foot for that Night. || 

When the Spaniards came, the two EngUJh Men I 
were fo encourag^'d, that they could not fatisfy them- 
felves to flay any longer there ; but taking five of the 
Sfaniards, and themfelves, with four Muskets and a 
Piflol among them, and two flout Qjiarter-Staves, 
away they went in Queft of the Savages. Andhrft 
they came to the Tree where the Men lay that had 
been kill'd ; but it was eafy to fee, that fome more 
of the Savages had been there,* for they had attempt- 
ed to carry their dead Men away, and had dragged 
two of them a good Way, but had given it over. I 
From thence theyadvanc'd to the firft riling Ground, 
where they had flood, and feen their Camp deflroy- 
ed, and where they had the Mortification flill to j 
fee fome of theSmoak ^ but neither could here fee 
any ofthe Savages : They then refolv'd, tho' with all 
pollible Caution, to go forward towards their ruin*4i 
Plantation : But a little before they came thither, 
coming in Sight of the Sea Shore, they faw plainly 
the Savages all embarking again in their Canoes, ixi 
order to be gone. 

They feemM ferry at firft that there was no Way 
to come at them, to give them a parting Blow ; But 
upon the whole^ were very well fatisfy 'd to be rid | 
of them. \ 

The poor Englifb Men being now twice ruin'd, 
snd all their Improvements deflroy'd, the refl all a- 
greed to come and help them rebuild, and to affifl 
them with needful Supplies. Their three Country- 
men, who were not yet noted for having theleaft In- 
clination to do any Good, yet as foon .as they heard 
of it (for they Viviug remote Eallward, knew nothing 
of the Matter 'till all was over) came and ofFer<i 
tiheir Help and Affiftanj;e, sind did v^ry friendly 

work 



[93] 



work for feveral Days, to reftore their Habitation, 
and make NeceiOfaries for them: and thus, in a little 
Time, they were fet upon their Legs again* 

About two Days atter this, they had the farther 
Satisfadion of feeing three of the Savages Canoes 
come driving on Shore, and at fome Diftance from 
them, two drown'd Men ; by which they had Rea- 
fon to beh'eve, that they had met with a Storm at 
Sea, and had overfet fome oi them ; for it had blown 
very hard the very Night after they went off. 

However^ as fome might mifcarry, fo on the 
other Hand enough of them cfcap'd to inform the 
reft, as well of what they had done, as of what had 
happen'd to them ; and to whet them on to another 
Enterprize of the fame Nature, which they, it feems, 
refolv'd to attempt, v/ith fufficienc Force to carry all 
before them, for except what the firft Man had toid 
them of Inhabitants, they could fay ;little to it of 
their own Knowledge i for they never faw one Man^ 
and the Fellow being kill'd that had affirmM ic^ 
they had no ocher Witnefs to coniirm it to them. 

It was five or (ix Months after this, before they 
heard any more of the Savages^ in which Time 
our Men were in Hopes they had either forgot their 
former bad Luck, or given over the Hopes of better ; 
when on a fudden they were invaded with a moil 
formidable Fleer, of no lefs than eight and twenty 
Canoes full of Savages, arm'd with Bows and Ar- 
rows, great Clubs, wooden Swords, and fuch like 
Engines of War ; and they brought fuch Numbers 
with them, that, in fhort, it put all our People into 
ihe utmoft Conflernation. 

As they came on Shore in the Evening, and at 
; theEafter-moftSideofthelfland, our Men had that 
Night to confult and confider what to do ,• and, in 
thefirftPlace, knowing that their being entirely con- 
ceal'd, was their only Safety before and would much 
more befo now^ while the Number of their Enemies 
was fo gr<5at^ they therefore refplv'd firft pf all to rake

the' Huts which were built for the two Englijh Men, 
and drive away their Goats to the old Cave -, becaufe 
they fuppofed the Savages would go diredly thither, 
as foon as it was Day, to play the old Game over a- 
gain, tho' they did not now land within two Leagues 
of it. 

In the next Place, they drove away all the Flock of 
Goats they had at the old Bower, as I call'd it,which 
belonged to the Spaniards; and, in fhort, left as little 
Appearance of Inhabitants any where as was poflible ; 
and the nextMorning early they polled rhemfelves with 
all their Force at the Plantation of the two Men, wait- , 
ing for their Coniing : As they guefs^d, fo it happened ; 
thefe new Invaders leaving their Canoes at the Eaft 
End olthelfland, came ranging along the Shore dired- 
ly towards the Place, to the Number of two hundred 
and fifty, as near as our Men could judge. Our Army 
was but fmall indeed ,• bur that which was worfe, they 
had not Arms for all their Number neither : The 
whole Account, it feems, flood thus ; Firft^as to Men* 
17 Spaniards' 
5 Englifh Men. 

I old Friday, or Fridays Father. 
3 the three Slaves taken with the Women, who 

prov'd very faithful. 
3 other Slaves who liv'd with the Spaniards. 
To Arm, thefe tkey had, 
II Muskets. 
5 Piftols. 

3 Fowling-Pieces. 

5 Muskets or Fowling-Pieces, which were ta- 
ken by me from the mutinous Seamen, who 
I reduc'd. 
2 Swords, 3 old Halberds. 
To their Slaves they did not give either Musket 
or Fuzee, but they had every one a Halberd, or a 
long Staff, like a Quarter-Staff, with a great Spike of 
Iron faftenM into each End of it, and by his Side a 
Hatchets alfo every one of our Men had Hatchets; 

Two 



[ 94 ] 



Two of the Women could not be prevaird upon but 
they would come into the Fight, and they had Bows 
and Arrows, which the Spaniards had taken from the 
Savages, when the firft Adion happened, which I have 
fpoken ofi where the Indians fought with one another, 
and the Women Hatchets too. 

The Spaniard Governcur, who I have defcrib'd fo 
often, commanded the whole ; and William Atkins^ 
who, tho' a dreadful Fellow for Wickednefs, was a 
moft daring bold Fellow, commanded under him. The 
Savages came forward like Lyons, and our Men, 
which was the woril of their Fate, had no Advan- 
tage in their Situation; only that Will. Atkins^ who 
now proved a moft ufeful Fellow, with fix Men, was 
planted juft behind a fmali Thicket oi Bufhes, as an 
advanc'd Guard, with Orders ro let the firft of them 
pafs by, and then fire into the Middle of them; and, 
as foon as he had hr'd, to make his Retreat as nim- 
ble as he could round a Part of the Wood, and io 
come in behind the Spaniards where they flood, hav- 
ing a Thicket of Trees all before them. 

When the Savages came on, they run flragling a- 
bout every way in Heaps, out of all manner of Or- 
der, and W Atkins let about fifty of them pafs by 
him, then feeing the reft come in a very thick Throng, 
he orders three of his Men to fire, having loaded their 
Mufquets with fix or feven Bullets apiece, about as 
big as large Piftol Bullets. How many they kill'd or 
wounded, they knew nac, but the Confternarion and 
Surprize was inexpreflible among the Savages ; they 
were frighted to the laft Degree, to hear fuch a dread- 
ful Noife, and fee their Men kill'd, and others hurt, 
but fee no Body that did ft; when in the Middle of 
their Fright, W. Atkins, and his other three, lee fly 
again among the thickeft of them ; and in lefs than a 
Minute the firft three, being loaded again, gave them 
a third Volley. 

Had /^. Atkins and his Men retir'd immediately, as 
foon as they h^ fir'd^ m they wer^ Qidsid to do ; or 

bad 



[9^1 



had the reft of the Body been at Hand to have pour'd 
m their Shot continualJy, the Savages had been effee- 
tually routed ; for the Terror that was among them, 
came principally from this, (vix>*) That they were 
kiil'd by the Gods with Thunder and Lightning, and 
could fee no Body that hurt them ; but IV* Atkins 
ftaying to load again, difcover'd the Cheat. Some of 
the Savages who were at a Diitance, fpying them, 
came upon them behind, and xho^ Atkins and his Men 
fir'd at them alfo, two or three Times, and kill'd a- 
bove twenty, retiring as fait as they could, yet they 
wounded Atkins himfe'f, and idll'd one of his Fellow 
Englifhrnen with their Arrows, as they did afterwards 
one Spaniard^ and one of the Indian Slaves who came 
with the Women; this Slave was a moft gallant Fel- 
low% and fought moft deiperately, killing five of them 
with his own Hand, having no Weapon, but one of 
the arm a Staves and a Hatchet. 

Our Men being thus hard laid at, Atkins wounded, 
and two ocher Men kiilM, retreated to a rifing Ground , 
in the Wood ; and the Spaniards^ after firing three 
Vollies upon them recreated aUo j for their Number 
was fo great, and they were fo defperate, that tho' 
above fifty of them were kill'd, and more than fo 
many wounded, yet they came on in the Teeth of 
our Men, fear lefs of Danger, and fliot their Arrows 
like a Cloudy and it was obferv'd, that their wounded 
Men, who were not quite difabled, were made out- 
rageous by their Wounds, and foiJght like Mad-men. 

V/hen our Men retreated, they left the Spaniard 
and the Englijh?nen that was kill'd behind them i and 
the Savages, when they came up to them, kill'd them 
over again in a wretched Manner, breaking the Arms^ 
Legs, and Heads, with their Clubs and wooden 
Swords, like true Savages : But finding our Men were 
gone, they did not feem to perfue them, but dre\^ 
themfelves up in a kind of a Ring, which is^ it feems, 
their Cuftom, and fiiouted twice in Token of their 
y idory ; After which, they had the Mortification to 

fee 



[97] 

fee feveral of their wounded Men fail, dying with the 
meer Lofs of Blood. 

The Spaniard Governor having drawn his little 
Body up rogetlier upon a riling Ground, ^^^/»^5 tho* 
he was wounded, v^^ould ha' had him marchM and 
charg'd them again altogether at once: But the Spa-- 
niards reply 'd, Seignior Atkins y you fee how thein 
wounded Men fight, let them alone till Morning*, all 
thefe wounded Men will be fliff and fore with theic 
Wounds, and faint with the Lofs of Blood ; and fo wc, 
fhail have the fewer to engage. 

The Advice was good: But /^/7/. ^//^z/^j reply 'cf 
merrily, That's true, Seignior, and fo fhalll toojand 
that's the Reafon I v/ould go on while I am warmi 
Well, Seignior Atkins, fays the Spaniards, you have 
behav'd gallantly, and done your Part ; we will fight 
for you, if you cannot come on, but I think it befi: to 
flay 'till Morning ; fo they waited. 

But as it was a clear Moon-light Night, and they 
found the Savages in great Difbrder about their dead 
and wounded Men, and a great Hurry and No'fe a- 
raong them where they lay, they afterwards refolv'd 
to fall upon them in the Night, efpecially i^ they could 
come to give them but one Volley before they were 
difcover'd, which they had a fair Opportunity todo> 
for one of the two Englifimen, in whofe Quarter it was 
where the Fight began> led them round between the 
Woods, and Sea- fide Weflward, and then turning fhort: 
South, they came fo near where the thickefl of them 
lay, that before they were feen or heard, eight of them 
lir'd in among them, and did dreadful Exeeution up- 
on themi in half a Minute more, eight others fir*d af-*,' 
ter them, pouring in their fmall Shot in fuch a Quan-; 
tity, that abundance were kiU'd and wounded ; and 
all this while they were not able to fee who hurc 
them, or which W^y to fly. 

ThQ Spaniards charg'd again with the utmofl: Expe- 
dition, and then divided tliemfelves into three Bodies,' 
^nd refolv'd to fall in among them altogether : They 

G had 



[98] 



had m each Body eight Perfons, that is to fay, 24^ 
whereof were 22 Men, and the 2 Women, who by 
the Way fought defperately. 

They divided the Fire- Arms equally in each Party, 
and fo of the Halberds and Staves : They would have 
had the Women keep back, but they faid they were 
refoiv'd to die with their Husbands. Having thus 
form'd their little Army, they march'd out from a- 
mong the Trees, and they came up to the Teeth of 
the Enemy, iliouting and hollowing as loud as they 
could ; the Savages flood all together, but were in the 
utmoft Confufion, hearing the Noife of our Men 
Clouting from three Quarters together,* they would 
have fought if they had feen us : And as foon as we 
came near enough to be feen, fome Arrows were 
(hot, and poor old Friday was wounded, tho' not 
dangerouily : But our Men gave them no Time ; but 
running up to them, fir'd among them three Ways, and 
then fell in with the But-ends of their Muskets, their 
Swords, arm'd Staves, and Hatchets, and laid about 
them fo well, that, in a Word, they fet up a difmal 
Skreaming and Howling, flying to fave their Lives 
which way foever they could. 

Our Men were tir'd with the Execution jand kill'd 
or mortally wounded, in the two Fights, about 180 
of them ; the refl, being frighted out of their Wits, 
fcour'd through the Woods, and over the Hills, with 
all the Speed and Fear that nimble Feet could help 
them to do; and as we did not trouble ourfelves 
much to purfue them, they got altogether to the Sea- 
fidCi where they landed, and where their Canoes lay. 
But their Difafier was not at an End yet ; for it blew 
a terrible Storm of Wind that Evening from the Sea- 
ward, fo that it was impofTible for them to go off; 
nay, the Storm continuing all Night, when the Tide 
came up, their Canoes were moft of them driven by 
the Surge of the Sea fo high upon the Shore, that it 
tequit'd infinite Toil to get therai off 5 and fome of 

them 



i 



[99] 



thetn were even dafli'd to Pieces agalnft the Beachil 
or againlt one another. 

Our Men, tho'glad of their Vidory, yet got lit- 
tle Reft that Night ; but having refrefh'd themfelves 
as well as they could, they refolv'd to march to that 
Part of the Ifland where the Savages were fled, and 
fee what Pofture they were in. This neceffarily led 
them over the Fiace where the Fight had been, and 
where they found fevera! of the poor Creatures not 
quite dead, and yet paft recovering Life'j a Sight dif- 
agreeable enough to generous Minds j for a truly, 
great Man, tho' obliged by the Law of Battle to de- 
itroy his Enemy, takes ^no Delight in his Mifery. 

However, there was no Need to give any Orders 
in this Cafe , for their own Savages, who were theic 
Servants^ difpatch'd thofe poor Creatures with theic 
Hatchets. 

At length they came in View of the Place where 
the more miferable Remains of the Savages Army, 
lay, where there appeared about an hundred ftill; 
their Pofture was general [y fitting upon the Ground, 
with their Knees up towards their Mouth, and the 
Head put between the two Hands, leaning down up- 
on the Knees. 

When our Men came within two Musket Shot o£ 
them, the Spaniard Governor orderM two Muskets to 
be fir'd without Ball, to alarm them ; this he did, that 
by their Countenance he might know what to expe^ir, 
'Viz,. Whether they were ftill in Heart to fight, or were 
fo heartily beaten, as to be defpirited and difcourag'd, 
and fo he might manage accordingly. 

This Stratagem took ; for, as foon as the Savages 
heard the firft Gun, and faw the Flafh of the Second, 
they ftarted up upon their Feet in the greateft Con- 
fternation imaginable ; and as our Men advanc'd 
fwiftly towards them, they all ran skreaming and 
yawUngaway, with a Kind of a howling Noife, which 
our Men did not underftand, and had never heard be- 
fore j and thus they ran up the Hills into the Country.' 

G 2 At 



C 100 ] 

At firft, our Men had much rather the Weathet 
had been calm, and they had all gone away to Sea : 
But they did noc then coniider that this might pro- 
bably have been the Occafion of iheir coming again 
in luch Multitudes, as not to be refifted, or, at leaft, 
to come fo many, and fo often, as would quite defo- 
late the Ifland, and ftarve thetn : WilL Atkins there- 
fore, who, nocwithftanding his Wound, kept always 
with them, prov'd the bed Counfelior in this Cafe : 
His Advice was, to take the Advantage that ofter'd, 
and clap in between them and their Boacs, and fo de- 
prive them of theCapacity of ever returning any more 
to plague the Itland. 

They confulted long about this, and fome were a- 
gainft it, for fear of making the Wretches fly to the 
Woods, and live there defperate,- and fo they fhould 
have them to hunt like wild Beafts, be arraid to ftir 
out about their Buiinefs, and have their Plantations 
continually rifled, all their tame Goats deftroy'd, and, 
in fhort, be reduced to a Life of continual Diftrefs. 

IViU, Atkins told them, they had better have to do 
with a hundred Men, than with a hundred Nations : 
That as they mufl deitroy their Boats, fo they mufl: 
deflroy the Men^ or be all of them deftroy'd them- 
felves. In a Word, he fhtw'd them the Necefficy of 
it fo plainly, that they all came inio it ,• fo they went 
to work immediately with the Boats, and getting 
fome dry Wood together from a dead Tree, they 
try'd to fet fome of them on Fire, but they were fo 
\?^et. that they would not burn ; however, the Fire 
fo burn'd the upper Part, that it foon made them 
unfit for fwimming in the Sea as Boats. When the 
Indians faw what they were about, fome of them 
came running out of the Woods, and coming as 
near as they could to our Men, kneefd down and 
cry'd, Oa, Oa^ JVaramokca, and fome other 
Words of their Language, which none of the others 
underftood any thing of i but as they made pitiful 
Geflures, and llrange Noifes, is was eafy to under- 

ftand 



[ loi ] 

fiand, they begg'd to have their Boats fpar'd, and 
that they would be gone, and never come there again. 

But our Men were now fatisfied, that they had no 
Way CO preftrve themleives, or to fave their Colony, 
but E^edually to prevent any of thefe People from 
ever going Home again ; depended upon this, that 
if ever (o much as one of them got back into their 
Country to trell the Story, the Colony was undone ; . 
fo that letting them know that theyfhould not have 
any Mercy, they fell to work with their Canoes, 
and deftroyed them every one, that the Storm had 
not defloyed before ; at the Sight of which, the Sa- 
vages raisM a hideous Cry in the Woods, which our 
People heard plain enough ; after which they ran a- 
bout the Ifland like difiraded Men j fo that, in a 
Wordj our Men did not really know at Ri[i what to 
do with them. 

Nor did the Spaniards, with all their prudence, 
confider, that while they made thofe People thus de- 
fperate, they ought to have kept good Guard at the 
fame Time upon their Plantations j for tho' it is 
true, they had driven away their Cattle, and the 
hdiam did not find out their main Retreat, I mean 
my old Caftle at the Hill, nor the Cave in the Val- 
ley, yet they found out my Plantation at the Bower, 
and pulled it all to Pieces, and all the Fences and 
Planting about it; trode ail the Corn under Foot^ 
tore up the Vines and Grapes, being juil: then al- 
moft ripe, and did to our Men in eftimable Damage, 
though to themfelves not one Farthingworth of Ser- 
vice. 

Tho' our Men were able to fight them upon all 
Occafions, yet they were in no Condition to purfue 
them, or hurt them up and down i for as they were 
too nimble of Foot for our Men, when they found 
them fingle, fo our Men durft not go about fingle, for 
fear of being furrounded with theirNumbers-The bell 
was, they had no Weapons, for tho' they had Bows 
they had no Arrows left, nor any Materials to make 

G 3 anyj 



[ IC2 ] 

any, nor had they any edg'd Tool or Weapon a- 
mong them. 

The Extremity and Diftrefs they were reduced to 
was great, and indeed deplorable ; but at the fame „ 
Time, our Men were alfo brought to very bad Cir- j 
cumftances by them ^ for tho' their Retreats were ; 
preferved, yet their Provifion was deftroyed, and 
their Harveft fpoiled, and what to do, or which 
Way to turn themfelves, they knew not : The only 
Refuge they had now, was the Stock of Cattle they 
had in the Valley by the Cave, and fome little Corn 
which grew there ; and the three Engliflmen, William 
■Atkins and his Comrades, who were now reduced to 
two, one oi them being kill'd by an Arrow which 
flruck him on the Side of his Head, juft under the 
Temple, fothat he never fpokemore^ and it was 
very remarkable, that this was the fame barbarous 
Fellow who cut the poor Savage Slave with his 
Hatchet, and who afterwards intended to have mur- 
der'd the Sfaniards. 

I look'd upon their Cafe to have been Worfe at 
this Time, than mine was at any Time, after I firft 
difcover'd the Grains of Barley and Rice, and got into 
the Method of planting and raifing my Corn, and 
my tame Cattle ; for now they had, as I may fay, a 
hundred Wolves upon the Ifland, which would de- 
vour every Thing they could come at, yet could 
very hardly be come at themfelves. 

The firft Thing they concluded, when they faw 
what their Circumftances were, was,that they would, 
if poffible, drive them up to the farther Part of the 
Ifland, South-we/i, that if any more Savages came on 
Shore, they might not find one another. Then, that 
they would daily hunt and harafs them, and kill as 
many of them as they could come at, till they had 
reduced their Number ; and if they could at laft 
tame them and bring them to any Thing, they would 
give them Corn, and teach them how to plant and 
live upon their daily Labour- 

In 



c ion , 

In order to this, they (o followed them, aud fo terri- 
fy 'd them with their Guns, that in a few Days, if 
any of them fired a Gun at a.n Indian, if he did not 
hit him, yet he would fall down for Fear ; and fo 
dreadfully frighted they were, that they kept out 
of Sight farther and farther, till at lall our Men fol- 
lowing them, and every Day almoft killing and woun- 
ding fome of them, they kept up in the Woods and 
hollow Places fo much, that it reduc'd them to the 
utmoft Mifery for want of Food ^ and many were 
afterwards found dead in the Woods, without any 
Hurt, but meerly ftarved to Death. 

When our Men found this, it made their Hearts 
relent, and Pity mov'd them ,* efpecially the Spaniard 
Governour. who was the moft gentlemanly generous- 
minded Man that ever I met with in my Life ; and 
he proposed, if poflible, to take one of them alive, and 
bring him to underftand what they meant, fofaras 
to be able to ad as Interpreter, and to go among 
them, and fee if they might be brought to fome Con- 
ditions, that might be depended upon, to fave their 
Lives, and to do us no Spoil. 

It was fome while before any of them could be 
taken ; but being weak and half ftarv'd, one of them 
was at laft furpriz'd and made a Prifoner h he was 
fullen at firft, and would neither eat or drink, but 
finding himfeif kindly ufed, and Viduais given him, 
and no Violence offered him, heat laft grew trada- 
ble, and came to himfeif. 

They brought old Riday to him, who talked often 
with him, and told him how kind the other would 
be to them all , that they would not only fave theic 
Lives, but would give them a Part of the Ifland to 
live in, provided they would give Satisfadion that 
they would keep in their own Bounds, and not come 
beyond it, to injure or prejudice others, and that 
they fhould have Corn given them, to planr and 
make it grow for their Bread, and fome Bread given 
them for their prefenc Subfiftence ; and old Friday b2Ld 

G 4 the 



[ 104 1 

the Fellow go and talk with the red of his Countrymen* | 
and fee what they faid to it, affuring them, that if they ^ 
did not agree immediarely,chey fhould be all deftroy'd. 

The poor Wretches, throughly humbled, and re- 
duced in Number to about thirty fcven, closM with 
the Propofal at the firft OfFer, and begg'd to have 
fome Food given them ; upon which, twelve Spa^ 
wards, and two Engliflomen well armed, and three 
Indian Slaves, and old Friday^ marched to the Place 
where they were ,* three Indian Slaves carried them a 
large Qiiantity of Bread j and fome Rice boiled up 
to Cakes, and dry'd in the Sun, and three live Goats ; 
and they were ordered to go to the Side of a Hill, 
where they fat down, eat the Proviiions, very thank- 
fully, and were the moft faithful Fellows to their 
jWords that could be thought of; for except when 
they came to beg Viduals and Diredicns, they ne- 
ver came out of their Bounds i and there they lived 
when I came to the Ifland, and I went to fee them. 

They had taught them both to plant Corn, make 
Bread, breed tame Coats, and milk them; they wanted 
nothing but Wives, and they foon vv^ould have been 
a Nation. They were confined to a Neck of Land, 
furrounded with high Rocks behind them, and lying 
plain towards the Sea before them, on the South-Eaft 
Corner of the Illand : They had Land enough, and it 
was very good and fruitful i they had a Piece of Land 
about a Mile and half broad, three or four yUlo, m 
Length. 

Our Men taught them to make wooden Spades, 
fuch as I made for my felf, and gave them among 
them twelve Hatchets and three or four Knives j 
and thete they liv'd the moft fubje^^ed innocent 
Creatures, that ever were heard of. 

After this, the Colony enjoy'd a perfed Tranqui- 
lity with Refped to the Savages, till I came to re- 
vifit them, which was above two Years : Not, but 
that miJi) and then, fome Canoes of Savages came 
on Shore for their triumphal unnatural Feafls^ but 
r,s. .■ as- 



[ 105 ] 

as they were of feveral Nations, and perhaps had 
never heard of thofe that came before, or the Rea- 
fon of it, they did not make any Search or Enquiry 
after their Countrymen ; and if they had, it would 
have been very hard to have found them out. 

Thus, I think, I have given a full Account of ail 
that happened to them, to my Return, at lead that 
was worth Notice. The Indians or Savages were 
wonderfully civilized by them, and they frequently 
went among them, but forbid, on Pain of Death, 
any one of the Indians coming to them, becaufe they 
would not have their Settlement betrayed again. 

One Thing was very remarkable, vix>. that they 
taught the Savages to make Wicker-work, or Baskets; 
but they foon out did their Mafters j for they made 
abundance ot moft ingenious Things in Wicker- 
work ; particularly, all Sorts of Baskets j Sieves, 
Bird-Cages, Cup-boards, &c, as alfo Chairs to fit 
on. Stools*, Beds, Couches, and abundance of other 
Things, being very ingenious at fuch Work, when 
they were once put in the Way of it. 

. My coming was a particular Relief to thcfe Peo- 
ple, becaufe we furnifti'd them with Knives, Scif- 
fars. Spades, Shovels, Pick-axes, and all Things of 
that Kind which they could want. 

With the Help of thefe Tools they were fo very 
handy, that they came at lail: to build up their 
Huts, or Houfes, very handfomely i raddl'ng or 
working it up like Basket-work all the Way round, 
which was a very extraordinary Piece of Ingenuity, 
and look'd very odd, but was an exceeding good 
Fence, as well again ft Heat, as againft all Sorts of 
Vermine ; and our Men were fo taken with it, that 
they got the wild Savages to come and do the like 
for them j fo that when I came to fee the two Eng- 
li[hmens Colonies, they look'd, at a Diftance, as if 
they liv'd all like Bees, in a Hive i and as for WilL 
Atkins y who was now become a very induftrious ne- 
j^effary and fober Fellow,^ he had made himfelf fucH 
< ' a Tent 



[ 106] 



a Tent of Basket- work, as I believe was never feen ;^ 
it was 1 20 Paces round in the Oi)t-{ide, as I raea- 
lur*d by my Steps; the Walls were as clofe work'd 
as a Basket inPannels, or Squares of 32 in Number, 
and very flrong, {landing about kvcn Foot high ; 
in the middle was another not above 22 Paces round, 
but built flronger, being Eight- fquare in its Form, 
and in the eight Corners iiood eight very fhong 
Pofts, round the Top of which he laid ftiong Pieces 
pinn^ together wjth wooden Pins, from which 
he raifed a Piramid for the Roof oi eight Rafters, 
very handfome, I aflure you, and join'd together ve- 
ry well, tho' he had no Nails, and only a few iron 
Spikes, which he made himfcif too, out of the old 
Iron that I had left there ? and indeed this Fellow 
ihew'd abundance of Ingenuity in feveral Things, 
which he had no Knowledge of; he made him a 
Forge, with a Pair of wooden Bellows to biow the 
Fire ; he made himfelf Ciiarcoal for his V/ork, and 
he formM out of one of the Iron-Crows, a mid- 
dling good Anvil to hammer upon ; in this Manner 
he made many Things, but efpccially Hooks, Sta- 
ples and Spikes, Bolts and Hinges : But to return to 
the Houfe ; after he had pitch a the Roof of his in- 
nermoft Tent, he work'd it up between the Rafters 
with Basket-work, fo firm, and thatch'd that over 
again fo ingenioufly with Rice-ftraw, and over that 
a large Leaf of a Tree, which covered the Top, 
that his Houte was as dry as if it had been til'd or 
flated. Indeed he own'd that the Savages made the 
Basket-work for him. 

The outer Circuit was cover'd, as a Lean- too, 
all round this inner Apartment, and long Pvafters lay 
from the two and rhiry Angles to the top Pofts of the 
inner Houfe, being about twenty Foot Diftant ; (o 
that there was a Space like a Walk, within the outer 
Wicker-wall, and without the inner, near twenty 
Foot wide. 

The 



[ 107 ]^ 

The inner Place he partition'd off with the fame 
Wicker-work, but much fairer, and divided it into 
fix Apartments, fo that he had fix Rooms on a 
Floor ; and out of every one of thefe there was a 
a Door, fifft into the Entry or Coming into the main 
Tent, and another Door into the Space or Walk that 
was round it ; fo that Walk was alfo divided into 
fix equal Parts, which ferv'd not only for Retreat, 
but to (lore up any Neceffaries which the Family had 
Occafion for, Thefe fix Spaces not taking up the 
whole Circumference, what other Apartments the 
outer Circle had, were thus orderM : As foon as 
you were in at the Door of the outer Circle, you 
had a fhort Paflage ftrait before you to the Door of 
the inner Houfe, but on either Side was a wicker Par- 
tition, and a Door in it, by which you went, firft, 
into a large Room or Store-houfe, twenty Foot wide, 
and about thirty Foot long, and thro' that into ano- 
ther not quite fo long h fo that in the outer Circle 
was tenhandfome Rociiis, fix ot which were only 
to be come at thro' the Apartments of the inner Tent, 
and ferv'd as Clofets or retiring Rooms to the ref- 
pedive Chambers of the inner Circle ; and four large 
Ware-houfes or Barns, or what you pleafe to call 
them, which went in thro' one another, two on ei- 
ther Hand of the Palfage, that led thro' the outer 
Door to the inner Tent. 

Such a Piece of Basket-work, I believe,^ was ne- 
ver feen in the World ,* nor a Houfe, or Tent, fo 
neatly contrived, much lefs, fo built. In this great 
Bee-hive liv'd the three Families, that is to fay, 
IVilL Atkins and his Companion ; the third was 
kill'd, but his Wife remained with three Children ; 
for £he was, it feems, big with Child when he dy'd, 
and the other two were not at all backward to give 
the Widow her full Share of every Thing, I mean, 
as to their Corn, Milk, Grapes, &c, and when they 
kill'd a Kid, or found a Turtle on the Shore ; fo 
ihat they all liv'd well enough, tho' it was true, 
. ^ thex 



[ io8 ] 

they were not fo induflrioiis as the other two, as 
lias been obferv'd ah'eady. 

One Thing, however, cannot be cn?.itted, I'/z. 
That as for Religion, I don*c know that there was 
any Thing of that Kind among them? they pretty 
often indeed put one another in Mind that there was 
a God, by the very common Method of Seamen, 
njtz,. Swearing by his Name : Nor were their poor 
'ignorant Savage Wives much the better for having 
been marry 'd to Chriftians, as we mu fl: call them ; 
for as they knew very little of God themfelves, fo 
they were utterly uncapable of entring into any 
Difcourfe with their Wives about a God^or to talk any 
thing to them concerning Religion. 

The utmofl: of all the Improvement which lean fay 
the Wives had made from them, was. that they had 
taught them tofpeak Englifh pretty well, and all the 
Children they had, which v/as near 20 in all, v/ere 
taught to fpeak Engliflo too, from their firfl learning 
to fpeak, tho' they at firfl fpoke it in a very broken 
Manner, like their Mothers. There were none of 
thefe Children above fix Years old when I came thi- 
ther, for it was not much above feven Years that they 
had fetched thefe five Savage Ladies over, but 
they had all been pretty fruitful, for they had 
all Children, more orlefs : I think the Cook's Mate's 
Wife was big of her Sixth Child ; and the Mothers 
were all a good Sort of well-govern'd, quite, labo- 
rious Women, modefc and decent, helpful to one 
another, mighty obfervant and fubjed to their Ma- 
fiers, I cannot call them Husbands ; and wanted 
nothing but to be well inflru6i:ed in the Chriftian Re- 
ligion, and to be legally marry 'd ; both which were 
happily brought about afterwards by my Means, or, 
at leaft, in Confequence of my coming among them. 

Having thus given an Account of the Colony in 
general, and pretty much of my five Runagate Eng- 
lijhy Imuftfay fomething of the ^SJ^^^^^rJj, who were 
tiie main Body of the Family i and in whofe Story 

there 



[ I09 ] 

there are fome Incidents alfo remarkable enough.' 

I had a great many DiTcourfes wich them about 
their CircLimftances, when they were among the Sa- 
vages; They told me readily, that they had no In- 
ftances to give of their Application or Ingenuity in 
that Country; that they were a poor miferable de- 
jected Handful of People ; that if Means had been put 
into their Hands_, they had yet fo abondon'd them- 
feives to Defpare, and fo funk under the Weight o£ 
their Misfortunes, that they thought of nothing but 
Starving : One of them, a grave and very fen(ible 
Man, told me, he was convinc'd they were in the 
wrong i that it was nor the Part of Wife Men to give 
up themfeives to their Mifery but always to take 
Hold of the Helps which Reafon offered, as well for 
prefeni Support, as for future Deliverance. He told 
me that Grief was the moft fenfelefs inlignificant 
Paffion in the World ^forthatit regarded only Things 
paft, which were generally impoffible to be recaifd 
or to be remedy M, but had no View to Things to 
come, and had no Share in any Thing that look'd 
like Deliverance, but rather added co the Affliction, 
than propofed a Remedy -. And upon this, he repeat- 
ed a SpanifJo Proverb ; which tho' I cannot repeat in 
juft the fame 'vVords that he fpoke it, yet I remember 
I made it into an Englijh Proverb of my own, thus : 

In Trouble to be trGuhPd^ 

h to have your 'Trouble doubled. 

He ran on then, in Remarks upon all the little 
Improvements I had made in my Solitude ; my un- 
weary 'd Application, ashecall'dit, and howl had 
made a Condition, which in its Circumflances, wasr, 
at firft much worfe than theirs, a thoufand Times 
more happy than theirs was, even now, when they 
were all together: He told me, it was remarkable, 
that Englijlomen had a greater Prefence of Mind in 
their Diftrefs, than any People that ever he met with ; 
that their unhappy Nation^ and the Ponuguefe^ wet^ 

the 



[no] 

the worfl Men in the World to flruggle with Mif- 
fortunes j for that their firft Step in Dangers, after 
the common Efforts are over, was always to defpair, 
lie down under it, and dk^ without roufing their 
Thoughts up to proper Remedies for Efcape. 

I told him, their Cafe and mine differed exceeding- 
ly, that they were caft upon the Shore without Ne- 
ceflaries, without Supply of Food, or of prefent Su- 
ftenance, 'till they could provide : That it is true, 
I had this Difadvantage and Difcomfort, that I was 
alone ; but then the Supplies I had providentaliy 
thrown into my Hands, by the unexpeded driving ot 
the Ship on Shore, was fuch a Help as would have en- 
couraged any Creature in the World to have apply'd 
himfelf as I have done. Seignior ^ fays the Spaniardy 
had we poor Spaniards been in your Cafe, we (hould 
never have gotten half thofe Thingsout of the Ship 
as you did ; Nay fays he^ we fhould never have found 
Means to have gotten a Raft to carry them, or to 
have gotten a Raft on Shore without Boat or Sail ; 
and how much lefs (hould we have done, faid he, if 
any of us had been alone ? Well, I defir'd him to a- 
bate his Compliment, and go on with the Hiftory of 
their coming on Shore, where they landed ; he told 
me, they unhappily landed at a Place where there 
were People without Providons ; whereas had'they 
had the common Senfe to have put off to Sea again, 
and gone to another Illand a little farther, they had 
found Provifions, tho' without People ; there being 
anifland that Way, as they have been told, where 
there was Provifions, tho' no People ,* that is to fay, 
that the Spaniards of Trinidad had frequently been 
there, and had fill'd the Ifland with Goats and Hogs 
at feveral Times : where they have bred in fuch Mul- 
titudes, and where Turtle and Sea- Fowls were in 
fuch Plenty, that they could ha^ been in no Want of 
Flefh, tho' they had found no Bread ; whereas here, 
they were only fuflain'd with a few Roots and Herbs, 
which they underlbod not, and which had no Sub- 

ilance 



[ III ] 



fiance in them, and which the Inhabitants gave them 
fparingly enough, and who could treat them no bet- 
ter, unlefs they would turn Canibals, and eat Mens 
Flefh, which was the great Dainty of their Country. 
They gave me an Account how many Ways they 
drove to civilize the Savages they were with, and to 
teach them rational Cufroms in the ordinary Way of 
Living, but in vain ; and how they retorted it upon 
them, as unjufl, that they who came there for Afli- 
ftance and Support, fhould attempt to fet up for In- 
ftrudtors of chole that gave them Bread j intimating, 
it feems, that none fhoi;ld fet up for the Inftrudors 
of others, but thofe who could live without them* 

They gave me difmal Accounts of the Extremities 
they were driven to ; how (ometimes they were ma- 
ny Days VvMthout any Food at all; the Ifland they 
were upon being inhabited by a Sort of Savages 
that lived more indolent, and for that Reafon were 
lefs fupplied with the Neceffaries of Life, than 
they had Reafon to believe others were, in the fame 
Part of the World ; and yet they found, that thefe 
Savages were kfs ravenous and voracious, than thofe 
who bad better Supplies cf Food. 

Alfo rhey added. That they could not but fee with 
what Demonilrations of Wifdom and Goodnefs the 
governing Providence of God direds the Event of 
Things in the World j which, they faid, appear'd 
in their Circumftance ; for i^ pmTcd by the Hard- 
fhips they were under, and the Barrennefs of the 
Country where they v/ere, they had fearchM after a 
better Place to live in ; they had then been out of 
the Way of the Relief that happened to them by my 
Means. 

Then they gave me an Account, how the Savages, 
who they Uv'd among, expeded them to go out with 
them into their Wars : And it was true, that, as they 
had Fire-Arms with them, had they not had the Dh 
fafter to lofe their Ammunition, they ftould not 
have been ferviceable only to their Friends, but have 

made 



[ Hi ] 

made themfelves terrible both to Friends and Ene- 
mies ,• but being without Powder and Shot, and yet 
in a Condition, that they could not in Reafon deny 
to go out with their Landlords to their Wars ; when 
they came into the Field of Battle, they were in a 
worfe Condition than the Savages themfelves ; for 
they neither had Bows nor Arrows, nor could they 
ufe thofe the Savages gave them ; io thar they 
could do nothing but fland ftill, and be wounded 
with Arrows, till they came up to the Teeth of 
their Enemy i and then indeed the three Hal bards 
they had, were of Ufe to them ,* and they would of- 
ten drive a whole little Army before them, with thofe 
Halbards and iharpned Sticks put into the Muzzles 
of their Muskets : But that for all this they were 
fometimes furrounded with Multitudes, and in great 
Danger from their Arrows ,* till at lafl they found the 
Way to make themfelves large Targets of Wood, 
which they covered with Skins of wild Beafts, whofe 
Names they knew not , aad thefe covered them from 
the Arrows of the Savagesj that notwithftanding thefe, 
they were fometimes in great Danger, and were once 
five of them knocked down together wich the Clubs of 
the Savages, which was the Time when one of them 
was taken Prifoner,- that is to fay, the Spaniard, 
whom I had relieved, that at hrft they thought had 
been killed : But when afterwards they heard he was 
taken Prifoner, they were under the greateft Grief 
imaginable, and would willingly have all ventured 
their Lives to have refcued him. 

They told me. That when they were fo knock'd 
down, the reft of their Company refcu'd them, and 
flood over them, fighting till they were come to them- 
felves, ail but him wno they thought had been dead; 
and then they made their Way with their Halbards 
and Pieces, (landing clofe together in a Line, thro' a 
Body of above a thoufand Savages, beating down all 
that came in their VVay,got the Vidory over their E- 
nemics, but to their great Sorrow, becaufe it was with 

the 



[ 113 ] 

the lois of their Friend ,* who, the other party find-* 
ing him alive, carry'd otF with fome others, as I 
gave an Account in my former* 

They defcrib'd moft affectionately, how they wer^ 
furpriz'd with Joy at the Return of tneir Friend and 
Companion in Mirvry, who they thought had been 
devour'd by wild Beafts of the worft Kind, (viz») 
by wild Men ; and yet how more and more ihey 
were (urpriz'd widi the Account he gave them of 
his Errand, and that there was a Chriftian in any 
Place near, much more one that was able^ and had 
Humanity enough to contribute to their Delive- 
rance. 

They defcribed how they were aflonifh'd at the 
Sight of the Relief I fent them, and at the Appea- 
rance of Loves of Bread, Things tiiev had not kca 
(ince there coming to that miferable Place ,• how of- 
ten they crolTed it, and blefled it as Bread fent trom 
Heaven ; and what a VQvivi g Cordial it was to 
their Spirits to tafte it; asalfo of the other Things 
I had fent for their Supply, and after all, they 
would have told me fomething of the Joy they were 
in, at the Sight of a Boat and Pilots to carry them 
away to the Perfon and Place from whence ail thefe 
new Comforts came ; but they told it was im- 
poflible to exprefs it by V/ords, for their excelTive Joy, 
naturally driving them to unbecoming Extravagan- 
cies, they had no way to defcribe them, but by tel- 
ling me that they bordered upon Lunacy, having no 
Way to give Vent to their PalTion, fiitiible to rhe 
Senfe that was upon them j that in fome it worked^ 
one Way, and in (ome another ; and that fome ot; 
them, thro' a Surprize of Joy, would birfl oul uico 
Tears j others be flark ma^i, and o hers immediately 
faint. This Difcourfe extreamly affected me, and 
caird to my mh>d Fridays Excacy, when ne mec his 
Fatherj and the poor People's Extacy, when I ^ook 
them up at Sea, after their Ship was on Fire i Tae 
Mate of the Ship^sJ^y, when he fouad liimleH de- 
li iirer^d 



C "4 3 



llvered in the Place where he expe6i:ed to perifh ; ji 
and niy own Joy when after 28 Years Captivity, I 
found a good Ship ready to carry me to my own 
Country. All thefe Things made me more fenfible , 
of the Relation of thofe poor Men, and more affe- 
ded with it. 

Having thus given a View of the State of Thingsf, 
as I found them, I muft relate the Heads of what I 
did for thefe People, and the Condition in which I 
left them. It was their Opinion and mine too, that 
they would be troubled no more with the Savages; 
or that if they were, they would be able to cut 
them oft, if they were twice as many as before ; I 
fo they had no Concern about that. Then I en- f 
tred into a ferious Difcourfe with the Spaniard j 
whom I call Governor^ about their Stay in the 
Ifland i for as I was not come to carry any of 
them of}-', fo it would not be juft to carry off 
fome, and leave others, who perhaps would 
be unwilling to flay, if their Strength was dimi- 
nifhed. 

On the other Handj I told them, I came to efla- 
blifh them there, not to remove them j and then I 
let them know, that I had brought with me Relief 
of fundry Kinds for them ; That I had been at a 
great Charge to fupply them with all Things necef^ 
^ry, as wefl for their Convenience, as their Defence ; 
and that I had fuch and fuch particular Perfons with 
me, as well to encreafe and recruit their Number, as 
by the particular neceffary Employments which they 
were bred to, being Artificers, to alTift them in thofe 
Things, in which, at prefent, they were to feek. 

They were altogether when I taik'd thus to them ; 
and before I delivered to them the Stores I had 
brought, I ask'd them one by one, If they had en- 
tirely forgot, and burry'd the firll Animofities that 
had been among them, and fhould fliake Hands with 
one another, and engage in 4 ftrj(^ Frieudfhip and 

Union 



[ 115 ] 

Union of Interefl, that (o there might be no more 
MjTundeiitandiiig or Jcialoiifies. 

fVilI' Atkins y with abundance of Franknefs and 
good Humour, faid. They had met with Afflic- 
tions enough to make them all fober, and Enemies 
enough to make them all Friends , that for his Part 
he would hve and die with them ; and was fo far 
from defigning any Thing againfl: the Spaniards ^ that 
he own'd they had done nothing to him, but what 
his own mad Humour made necefTary, and what he 
would have done, and perhaps much worfe in their 
Cafe ; and chat he would ask them Pardon, if I de- 
iired it, for the foolifh and brutifh Things he had 
done to them ,* and was very willing and defirous of 
living in Terms of entire Friendihip and Union with 
them ; and would do any Thing that lay in his Pow- 
er to convince them of it ; and as for going to Eng-" 
landy he car'd not if he did not go thither thefe twen- 
ty Years. 

The Spaniards faid. They had indeed at firft dif- 
arm'd and excluded Will. Atkins and his two 
Countrymen for their ill Conduct, as they had lec 
me know j and they appeal'd to me, for the Nece- 
ITity they were under to do fo : But that M/ill, Athns 
had behavM himfelf fo bravely in the great Fight 
they had with the Savages, and on feveral Occafiors 
(ince I and had fhew'd himfeif fo faithful to, and con- 
cerned for, the general Intereft of them all, that the/ 
had forgotten all that was paft, and thought he 
merited as much to be trufted with Arms, and lup- 
ply'd with Neceflaries as any of them ; and that they 
had teftify'd their Satisfadlion in him, by commit* 
ting the Command to him, next to the Govemout 
himfelf. And as they had an entire Confidence int 
him and all his CoTintrymen, fo they acknowledged 
they had merited that Confidence by all the Methods 
that honed Men could merit to be valued, and trufted^ 
and they moil heartily embraced the Oecafion of 
H % giving 



1 11^ ] 



giving me this Aflurance, that they would never ; 
have any Incereft feparate from one another. 

Upon thefe frank and open Declarations of Friend- 
fhip, we appointed the next Day to dine all together; 
and indeed we made a fplendid Feaft : I caufed the 
Ships Cook and his Mate to come on Shore, and 
drefs our Dinner ; and the old Cook's Mate we had 
on Shore, affifted. We brought on Shore fix Pieces 
of good Beef, and four Pieces of Pork out of the Ship's 
Provifion, with our Punch-Bowl, and Materials to 
fill it ; and ia particular, I gave them ten Bottles of 
French Chrct, and ten Bottles oi EngUflo Beer; Things 
that neither the Spaniards^ or the Englijh Men had 
tafted for many Years; and which, it may be fuppo- 
fed, they were exceeding glad of. 

The Spaniards added to our Feaft five whole Kids, 
which the Cooks roafted ; and three of them were 
fent cover'd up clofe on Board the Ship, to the 
Seamen^ that they might Feaft on frefli Meat from 
on Shore, as we did with their Salt Meat from on 
Board. 

After this Feaft, at which we \Vere very inno- 
cently merry, I brought out my Cargo of Goods, 
wherein, that there might be on Difpute about di- 
viding, I fhew'd ihem there was fufficient for them 
all; and defir'd that they might a.i take an equal 
Quantity of the Goods that Were for wearing ; that 
is to fay, equal when made up; as firft, I diftribu- 
ted Linnen fuificient to make every one of them font 
Shirts ; and at the Spaniards Requeft afterwards, made 
up fix ; thefe were exceeding comfortable to them, 
having been what, as I may fay, they had long fince 
forgot the Ufe of or what it was to wear them. 

1 allotted the thin £/2^///y?? Stuffs, which I mentioned 
before, to make every one a light Coat, like a Frock, 
which I jr.dged fittcft for the Heat of the Seafon ; 
tooi a.nd ioofe, and order'd, that whenever they de- 
cayed, they (hould make more, as they thought fit : 

The 



The like for Pumps, Shoes, Stockings and Hats, 

I cannot exprefs what Pleafure, what Satisfadion, 
fat upon the Countenances of all thefe poor Men, 
when they faw the Care I had taken of them, and 
how well I had furnifh'd them ^ they told me, I 
was a Father to them, and that having fuch a Cor- 
refpondent as I was, in fo remote a Part of the 
World, it would make them forget that they were 
left in a de folate Place ; and they all voluntarily en- 
gaged to me not to leave the Place without my 
Con fen r. 

^hen I prefented to them the People I had brought 
with me, particularly the Taylor, the Smith, and 
the two Carpenters, all of them moil necefl'ary Peo- 
ple ; but above all, my general Artificer, than whom 
they could not Name any Thing that was more ufe- 
ful to them. And the Taylor, to fliew his Concern 
for them, went to work immediately, and, with my 
Leave, made them every one a Shirt the fir/l: Thing 
he did \ and which was fiill more, he taught the Wo- 
men, not only how to fow and flitch, and ufe the 
Needle, but made them alTifl to make the Shirts for 
their Husbands, and for all the reft. 

As to the Carpenters, I fcarce need mention, how 
ufeful they were, for they took in Pieces all my clumfy 
unhandy Things, and made them clever convenient 
Tables^ Stools, Bed-fteads, Cup-boards, Lockers* 
Shelves, and every thing they wanted of that Kind* 

But to let them fee how Nature made Artificers 
at firft, I carried the Carpenters to fee WiU^ Atktms 
Basket-houfe, as I called it, and they both own*d 
they never faw an Inftance of fuch natural Ingenuity 
before ^ nor any Thing fo regular, and fo handily 
built, at leaft of its Kind : And one of them, when 
he faw it, after mufing a good while, turning about 
to me, I am fure, fays he, that Mi i has no need of 
us^ you need do nothing but give him Tools. 

H z Then 



[ ii8 ] 



Then I brought them out all my Store of Tools, 
and gave every Man a Digging- Spade, a Shovel, and 
a Rake, for we had no Harrows cr Plows; and ta 
every feparate Place, a Pick-ax, a Crow, a broad 
Ax, and a Stiw ; always appointing, that as often 
as any were broken, or worn out, they fliould be 
fupply'd without grudging, out of the general Stores 
that 1 left behind. 

Nails, Staples, Hinges, Hammers, Ch.fTels, Knives, 
Sc4ffars, and all forts of Toois, and Iron-work, 
they had without Tale, as they requir'd, for no Man 
would care to take more than they wanted, and he 
mufl be a Fool that would wall or (poil them, on 
any Account whatever,* and for the Ufe of a Smith, 
I left two Ton oi unwrought Iron for a Supply. 

My Magazine of Powder and Arms, which I 
brought them, was fuch, even to Profufion, that 
they could not but rejoice at them, for now they 
could march as I ufed to do, with a Musket upon 
each Shoulder, if there was Occaflon, and were able 
to fight a Thoufand Savages, if they had but fome 
little Advantages of Situation, which alfo they 
could notmifsof if they had Occafion. 

I carry 'd on Shore with me the young Man, whofe 
Mother was ftarv'd to Death, and the Maid alfo ; 
Ihe was a fober well educated religious young Wo- 
man, and behav'd fo incffcnfively, that every one 
gave her a good Word*, (he had indeed an unhappy 
Life witli u?5 there being no Woman in the Ship but 
herfelf ; but (he bore it with Patience. After a while 
feeing Things fo well order'd, and in fo fine a Way of 
thriving upon my Ifland, and confidering that they 
had neither Bufinefscr Acquaintance in the Eafi-Jn- 
diesj or Reafon for taking fo long a Voyage : I fay, 
confidering all this, both q^ them came to me, and 
defir'd I would give them leave to remain on the Ifland, 
and beenter'd among my Family, as rhey called it. 

I agreed to it readily, and they had a little 
Plat of Ground allotted to them, where they had 

thres 



[119] 

three Tents or Houfes fee up, furrounded with a 
Basket-work, Pallifado'd like Atkins's, adjoining to 
his Plantation: Their Tents were contrived, fo thac 
they had each of thena a Room apart to lodge in, 
and a middle lent like a great Srorehoufe to lay 
all their Goods in, and to eat and drink in ; and now 
the other two Englifimen vcmov'd their Habitation 
to the fame Place, and lb the Ifland was divided in- 
to three Colonies and no more, viz., the Spaniards 
with old Friday, and the firft Servants, at my old 
Habitation under the Hill ; which was, in a Word, 
the capital City ; and where they had fo enlarged 
and extended their Works, as well under as on the 
outfide of the Hill, that they liv'd, tho' perfedly 
conceal'd, yet full at large. Never was there fuch 
a little City in a Wood, andfo hid, I believe, in a- 
ny Part of the World ; ior I verily believe, a thou- 
land Men might have rang'd the Ifland a Month, 
and if they had not known there was fuch a Thing, 
and look'd on purpofe for it, they would not have 
found it ; for the Trees flood fo thick and foclofe, 
and grew fo faft mattered into one another, that 
nothing but cutting them down firft could difcover 
the Place; except the only two narrow Entrances^ 
where they went in and out^ could be found, which 
was not veryeafy; one of them was juft down at 
the Waters Edge on the Side of the Creek, and 
it was afterwards above two hundred Yards to the 
Place ; and the other was up the Ladder at twice, 
as I have already formerly defcrib'd it ; and they 
had a large Wood thick planted, alfo, on the 
Top of the Hill, which coatain'd above an Acre, 
which grew apace, and cover'd the Place from all 
Difcovery there, with only one narrow^ Place be- 
tween two Trees, noteafy to bedifcover'd to enter 
on that Side. 

The other Colony was that of /VUl Atkinses, 
where there were four Families of EngUfi Men, 

H 4 I mean 



[ 110] 



J mean thofe I had left there, with their Wives 
and Children ; three Savages that were Slaves ; the 
Widow and Children of the Englijh Man that was 
kih'd i the young Man and the Maid ; and by the 
Way, we made a W& ot her alfo, before we went 
away : There were alio the two Carpenters and the 
Taylor, who I brought with me for themj alfo the lil 
Smith, who was a very necefTary Man to them, efpe- 
cially as a Gunfmith, to take care of their Arms ; 
and my other Man, who I call'd. Jack of all Trades ; 
who was in himfelf as good, almoft as 20 Men, for 
he was not only a very ingenious Fellow, but a ve- 
ry merry Fellow, and before I went away, we mar- 
ried him to the honefl Maid that came with the 
Youth in the Ship, I mentioned before. 

And now I fpeak of Marrying, it brings me na- ( 
turally to fay fome thing of the French Eccleliaftic 
that I had brought with me out of the Ship's Crew, 
who I took up at Sea. It is true, this Man was a 
Roman, and perhaps it may give Offence to fome here- 
after, if I leave any Thing extraordinary upon Record, 
of a Man, who, before I begin, I muft, (to fet him 
Out in juft Colours) reprefent in Terms very much to 
his Difad vantage, in the Account of Proteftants j as 
fifty that he was a Papift ; fecmdly, a popifli Prieft y 
and thirdly, a French popifh Prieft. 

But Juftice demands of me to give him a dueCha- I 
rader i and I miiftfay, he was a grave, fober, pious, 
and moft religious Pcrfcn ; exad in his Life, extenfive 
in his Charity, and exemplar in almoft every Thing he 
did j what then can any one fay, againft my being ve- 
ry fenfible of the Value of fiich a Man, notwithftand" 
ing his Profeffioii ? Tiio' it may be my Opinion, per? |( 
haps, as well as the O;:inion of others, who fhalJ read 
this, that he was miftaken. 

^ The firft Hour that I began to converfe with 
him, after he had agreed to go with me to the 
Eafi Indies^ I found Reafon to delight exceedingly 

in 



C I2.I ] 

in his Converfation; and he firft be^an with me about 
Religion in the moft obliging Manner imagmable. 

S;r, fays he, you have not onl), under God, (and 
at that he crofs'd his Breaft) (av'd my Lite, but 
you have admitted me to go this Voyage in your 
Ship, and by your obliging Civility have taken me 
into your Family, giving me an Opportunity of 
free Converfation. Now Sir, fays he, you fee by 
my Habit, what my Prcfeffion is, and I guefs by 
your Nation what yours is : I may think it is my 
Duty, and doubtlefs it is fo, to ufe my utmoft En- 
deavours, on all Occations, to bring all the Souls I 
can to the Knowledge of the Truth, and to em-* 
brace the Catholick Dodtine ; but as I am here 
under your Permiffion, and in your Family, I am 
bound in Juftice to your Kindnefsj as well as in 
Decency and good Manners, to be under your Go- 
vernment ; and therefore I fhall not, without your 
Leave, enter into any Debates on the Point of Re- 
ligion, in which we may not agree, farther than you 
fliall give me Leave. 

I told him, h.s Carriage was fo modefl, that I 
could not but acknowledge it ; that it v/as true, we 
were fuch People as they call'd Hereticks ; but that 
he was not the firft Catholick that I had convers'd 
with, without fail'ng into any Inconveniencies, or 
carrying the Queftions to any height in Debate : 
That he (hould not find himfelf the worfe us'd for 
being of a different Opinion from us, and if we did 
not converfe without any Diflike on either Side up- 
on that Score, it would be his Fault, not ours. 

He reply'd, that he thought all our Converfation 
might be eafily feparated trom Difputes : That it 
was not his Bafinefs to cap Principles with every 
Man he difcours'd with ; and that he rather defir'd 
me to converfe with him as a Gentleman, than as 
a Religicufe; that if I would give him leave at any 
time to difcourfe upon religious Subjeds, he would 
readily comply with it i and that then, he did not 

doubt 



doubt but I would allow him alfo to defend his own 
Opinions, as well as he could ; but that without my 
Leave, he would not break in upon me with any 
fuch thing. 

He told me farther, that he would not ceafe to 
do all that became him in his Olfice, as a Pried, as 
well as a private Chriftian, to procure the Good of 
the Ship, and tlie Safety of all that was in her ; 
and tho' perhaps w^e would not join with him, and 
he could not pray with us, he hop^d he might pray 
for us, which he would do upon all Occafions. In 
this Manner we convers'd, and as he was oF a moft 
obliging Gentleman-like Behaviour ; fo he was, if I 
may be allowed to fay fo, a Man of good Senfe, and 
as I believe, of great Learning. 

He gave me a mod diverting Account of his 
Life, and of the many extraordinary Events of it, of 
many Adventures which had befallen him in the 
few Years that he had been abroad in the World, 
and particularly this was very remarkable, ('viz-) 
That during the Voyage he was now engaged in, 
lie had the Misfortune to be five times fhip'd 
and unfhip'd, and never to go to the Place whither 
any of the Ships, he was in, were at firft defign^d : 
That his firfl Intent was to have gone to Martmkoy 
and that he went on board a Ship bound thither, at 
St. Malo; but being forc'd into Liskrij by bad Wea- 
ther, the Ship received fome Damage, by running 
a-ground in the Mouth of the River Tagus^ and was 
oblig'd to unload her Cargo there ; that finding a 
Fortuguefe Ship there bound to the Maderas, and 
ready to fail, and fuppofing he fhould eafily meet 
with a VelTel there bound to Maninko j he went on 
board,in order to fail to the Maderas ; but the Mailer 
of the Portuguefe Ship being but an indifferent Mari- 
ner«, had been out in his Reckoning, and they drove 
to Fial ; where, however he happened to find a very 
good Market for his Cargo, which was Corn, and 
therefore refolv'd not to go to the Maderas^ but to 

load 



[ 1^3 ] 

load Salt at the Ifte of May, and to go away to New-, 
foundland: Hw had no Remedy in this Exigence, but 
to go with the Ship, and had a pretty good Voy- 
age as far as the Banks, fo they call the Place 
where they catch the Fifti, where meeting with a 
French Smp, boond from France to Quei?eck, in the Ri- 
ver of Canada, and from thence to Martmico, to carry 
Provilions, he thought he flioiild have an Opportunity 
to comp.eat his firft Defign : But when he came to 
Quebeck, the Mailer of the Ship dy'd, and the Ship 
proceeded no farther ; fo the next Voyage he Chip a 
himfelf for France, in the Ship that was burnt, when 
we took them up at Sea^ and then fhip'd them with us 
for the Eafl'Indies, as I have already faid : Thus he 
had been difappointed in five Voyages, all, as I 
may call it, in one Voyage, befides what I {hall 
have Occation to mention farther of the fame Per- 
fon. 

But, I fhall not make DIgreflions into other Mens 
Stories, which have no Relation to my own. I re- 
turn to what concerns our Affair in the Ifland : He 
came to me one Morning, for he lodgM among us, 
all the while we were upon the Ifland ; and it hap- 
pened to be juft when I was going to vidt the 
Englijh Men's Colony, at the fartheft Part of 
the Ifland ; I fay , he came to me and told 
me, with a very grave Countenance, that he had 
for two or three Days de/ir'd an Opportunity of 
fome Difcourfe with me, which he hopM (hould 
not be difpleafing to me, ' becaufe he thought it 
might in fome Meafure correfpond with my gene- 
ral Defign, which was the Profperity of my new 
Colony, and perhaps might put it, at lead more 
than he yet thought it was, in the Way of God*s 
Bleffing. 

I look'd a little furpriz'd at the laft Part of his 
Difcourfe, and turning a little fhort, How Sir! faid 
I, can it he faid, that we arc not in the Way of God*s 
Bleffingj after fuch vifthle Ajfiflances^ and "wonderful 



[ iH ] 

DeUnjerances as we have feen here, and of which I 
have given you a large Account ? 

If you had pleased Sir^ /aid he with a IVarld of Mo- 
dejiy^ and yet with great Readinefs, to have heard me, 
you would have found no room to have been dif- 
pieas'd, much lefs to think fo hard of me, that I 
fhould fugge/f, that you have not had wonderful 
Affiflances and Deh'verances ; and I hope, on your 
Behalf, that you are in the Way of God's Bleffing, 
and your Defign is exceeding good, and will prof- 
per : But Sir, /aid he, tho' it were more fo, than is 
even poflibie to you, yet there may be fome among 
you that are not equally right in their At5tions : And 
you know, that in the Story of the Children of If- 
rael, one Achan in the Camp removed Code's Bleffing 
from them, and turnM his Hand fo againft them^ 
that fix and thirty of them, tho^ not concernM in the 
Crime, were the Objed: of Divine Vengeance, and 
bore the Weight of that Punifliment. 

I was fenfibly touched with his .Difcourfe, and 
told him his Inference was fo jui^, and the whole 
Pefign feemM fo fincere, and was really fo religious 
in its own Nature, that I was very forry I had in- 
terrupted him, and beg'd him to go on ,• and in the 
mean Time, becaufe it feem'd, that what we had 
both to fay, might take up fome Time, I told him, 
I was going to the English Mens Plantations, and 
ask'd him to go with me, and we might difcourfe 
of it by the Way : He told me, he would more wil- 
lingly wait on me rhither, becaufe there parti y> the 
Thing was aded, which he defir'd to fpeak to me 
about \ fo we walk'd on ; and I prefs'd him to be 
free and plain with me, in what he had to fay. 

Why then Sir, fays he, be pleafed to give me 
Leave to lay down a few Propoliiions, as the Foun- 
dation of wliat I have to fay, that we may not 
differ m the general Principles, tho' we rnay be of 
feme d'ffering Opinions m the Practice of P.irticu- 
lars. f irft. Sir, tho' we diffei: in fome of the D^- 

(3:rinal 



[ ii5 ] 

ftrlnal Articles of Religion ', and it is very unhappy 
that it is fo, efpecially in the Cafe before us, as I 
fliall fliew afterwards : Yet there are fome general 
Principles in which we both agree, (viz,.) firft. That 
there is a God ; and that this God having given 
us fome ftated general Rules for our Service and O- 
bedience, we ought not willingly and knowingly to 
offend him ; either by negleding to do what he has 
commanded, or by doing what he has exprefly for- 
bidden : And let our different Religions be what 
they will, this general Prmciple is readily own'd by 
us all, That the Bieffing of God does not ordinarily 
follow a prefumpLuous iinning againft his Command; 
and every good Chriflian will be affedionately con- 
cern *d to prevent any that are under his Care, li- 
ving in a total Negledt of God and his Commands. 
It is not your Men being Proteftants, whatever my 
Opinion may be of fuch, that difcharges me from 
being concerii'd for ?:heir Souls, and from endeavour- 
ing, if it lies before me, that they fhould live m as 
little DiHance from and Enmity with their Maker, 
as poffible ; efpecially if you give me Leave to med- 
dle fo far in your Circuit. 

I could not yet imagine what he aim'd at, and 
told him, I granted all he had faid, and thank'd 
him, that he would fo far concern himfelf for us ; 
and beg'd he would explain the Particulars of what 
he had obferv'd, that like Joj]?ua^ to take his own 
Parable,! might put away the accurfcd Thing from us. 

Why then. Sir, fays he, I will take the Liberty 
you give me ; and there are three Things, which, 
if I am right, muft Hand in the Way of God's Blef- 
fmg upon your Endeavours here, and which I Ihould 
rejoice for your Sake, and their ovvu, to fee removed," 
And, Sir, fays he, I prcmife myfelf, that you will 
fully agree with me in them ail, zs foon as I name 
them ; efpecially becauie I ihall convince you, thac 
every one of them may, with great . Eafe, and very 
much to your Satisfaction^ be remedy^d^ 

He 



[ 116 ] 

He gave me no Leave to put in any more Civili- 
ties, but went on. Firfi, Sir, fays he, you have 
here four EngUjh Men, who have fetch'd Women 
from among the Savages, and have taken them as 
their Wives, and have had many Chi dren by them 
all, and yet are not marry 'd to rhem after any da- 
ted legal Manner, as the Laws ot God' and Man 
require j and therefore are yet, in theSenfe of both, 
no lefs than Adulterers^ and living in Adultery. To 
this, Sir, fays hey I know you' will objed; that there 
was no Clergyman or Prieft of any Kind, or of any 
Prpfeflion, to perform the Ceremony ^ nor any Pen 
and Ink, or Paper, to write down a Contract of 
Marriage, and have it llgn'd between them. And 
I know alfo, Sir, what the Spaniard Governour has 
told you ; I mean of the Agreement that he oblig d 
them to make, when they took thefe Women, {^uiz,.) 
That they fhould chufe them out by Confent, and 
keep feparately to them; which, by the way, is no- 
thing of a Marriage, no Agreement with the Wo- I 
men, as Wives, but only an Agreement among them- 
felves, to keep them from quarrelling. 

But, Sir, theEflenceof the Sacrament of Matri- 
mony (fo he caird it, being a Roman) confifts not 
only in the mutual Confent of the Parties to take 
one another, as Man and Wife, but iw the formal and 
legal Obligation, that there is in the Contrad, to 
compel the Man and Woman at all Times, to own 
and acknowledge each other j obliging the Man to 
abflain from all other Women, to engage in no o- 
ther Contract while thefe fubfift ; and on all Occa- 
fions, as Ability allows, to provide honeflly for 
them and their Children ; and to oblige the Woman 
to the fame, or like Conditions, mutatis mutandis, on 
their Side. 

Now, Sir, fays he^ thefe Men may, when they 
pleafe, or when Occafion prefents, abandon thefe 
Women, difown their Children, leave them to perifli, 
and take other Women, and marry them whillt thefe 

are 



[ 1^7 3 

are living. And here he added, with fome Warmth, 
How, Sir, is God honour'd in this unlawful Liber- 
ty ? And how (hall a Bl effing fucceed your Endea- 
vours in this Place, However good in themjehesy and 
however f mere in your Dejign, while thefe Men, who 
at prefent are your Subjed^s, under your abfolute 
Government and Dominion, are allowed by you to 
live in open Adultery ? 

I confefs, 1 was firuck at the Thing itfelf, but 
much m,ore with the convincing Arguments he fup- 
ported it with ; for it was certainly true, that tho' 
rhey had no Clergyman upon the Spot, yet a formal 
ConiTa6t on both Sides, made before Witneffes, and 
confirmed by any Token, which they had all agreed 
to be bound by, tho^ it had been but the breaking a 
Stick between them, engaging the Men to own thefe 
Women for their Wives, upon all Occafionsj and 
never to abandon them or their Children, and the 
Women to the fame with their Husbands, and had 
been an efi-edual lawful Marriage in the Sight of 
God ; and it was a great Negled that it was not 
done. 

But I thought to have gotten off with my young 
Prieft, by tdling him, that all that Part was done 
when I was not here, and rhey had Viv^d fo many 
Years with them now, that if it was an Adultery, it 
was paft Remedy, they could do nothing in it now. 

Sir, fays he, asking your Pardon for fuch Freedom^ 
you are right m this, that it being done in your 
Abfence, you could not be charg'd with that Part 
of the Crime : But I befcech you, flatter not youc 
felf, that you are not therefore under an Obligation 
to do your utmoft now, to put an End to it. How- 
can you think, but that, let the Time pafl lie on 
who it wiJ, all the Guilt, for the future, will lie 
entirely upon you ? Becaufe it is certainly in your 
Power now to put am End to it^ and in no Body's 
Power but your's. 

I was 



[ 118 ] 

1 was fo dull ftill, that I did not take him right ; 
bur I imagined, tiiat by putting an End to it, he 
meant that 1 fliould part them, and not luffer themi 
to live togerher any lunger ; And I faid to hhn, I 
could not do that by *iny Means, for tnat it v/otild 
put the vvliole Ifland into Confufion : He feem'd fur- 
prized, that 1 Ihoiild fo far miftake him. No, Sir> 
fayi hey I do no: mean, that you fhould now feperate 
them, bur ;egaiiy and effednally marry them now; 
and as Sir, my Way ot marrying them may not be 
fo eafy co reconcile them to, tho' it will be as effec- 
tual, even by your own Laws, fo your Way may be 
as well before God, and as valid among Men ; I 
mean, by a written Contrad, fignM by both Man 
and Woman, and by all the Witnefles prefent, which 
all the Laws of Europe would decree to be valid. 

I was amaz'a to fee fo much true Piety, and fo 
much Sincerity of Zeal, befides the unufuai Impar- 
tially in his Difcourfe,as to his own Party or Churchy 
and fuch a true Warmth for the preferving People 
that he had no Knowledge of, or Relation toi I 
fay, for preferving them from tranfgreiling the Laws 
of God i the ike of which, I had indeed not mec 
with any where : But recoUeding what he had faid, 
of marrying them by a written Contrad, which I 
knew would ftand too ; I return^ it back upon him^ 
and told him, I granted all that he had faid to be 
juff, and on his Part very kind, that I would dif- 
courfe wich the Men upon the Point now, when I 
came to them : And I knew no Reafon why they 
JhouM fcrupie to let him marry them all, which I 
knew well enough would be granted to be as authen- 
tick and valid in England, as it they were marry ^d 
by one of our own Clergymen. What was af- 
terwards done in this Matter, I fhall fpeak of it by 
it felf. 

I then prefs'd him to tell me what was the fecond 
Complaint which he had to make, acknowledging, 
that I was very much his Debtor for the firfi, and 

thanked 



[ 119 ] 

thank'd him heartily for it. He told me, he would 
u(e the fame Freedom and Plainnefs in the fecond^ 
and hcp'd I would take it as well : And this was, 
that notwich (landing thefe Engliji:) Subjeds of mine, 
as he caWd them, had lived with thofe Women for 
almoll feven Years, and had ta ight them to fpeak 
EnglijJj) and even to read it j and that they were, as he 
perceiv'd. Women of coUerable Underftanding, and 
capable of Inftrudion ; yet they had not to this 
jHour taught them any thing of the Chriftian Reli- 
gion ; no, not fo much as to know that there was a 
iGod, or a V/orfhip, or in what Manner God was 
|to be ferved, or that their own Idolatry, and wor- 
diipping they knew not who, was falfe and abfurd. 

This he faid, was an unaccountable Negled, and 
what God would certainly call them to Account 
for, and perhaps at laft take the • Work out of their 
Hands. He fpoke this very affedionately and warm- 
ly. I am perfwaded, fays he, had thofe Men lived 
;in the favage Country, whence their Wives came ; 
I the Savages would have taken more Pains to have 
'brought them to be Idolaters^ and to worfhip the 
Devil, than any of thefe Men, fo far as he could fee, 
ihad taken with them to teach them the Knowledge 
of the true God. Now, Sir, faid he, tho' I do not 
acknowledge your Religion, or you mine, yet we 
fhould be glad to fee the Devil's Servants, and the 
Subjeds of his Kingdom, taught to know the ge- 
neral Principles of the Chriftian Religion ; that they 
might, at leaft, hear of God, and of a Redeemer, 
and of the Kefurredion, and of a future StatCj 
Things which we all believe ; they had at leaft been 
fo much nearer coming into the Bofom of the true 
Church, than they are now in the publick Profeffion 
;of Idolatry and Devil- Worfhip. 

I could hold no longer j I took him in my Arms, 

and embrac'd him with an Excefs of PafTion : How 

far, faid I to him, have I been from underftanding 

^1 I the 



[ 130 ] 



the moft effential Part of a Chriflian, ('viz..) to love 
the Incercil of the Chriflian Church, and the good 
of other Mens Souls ? I fcarcehave known what be- 
longs to being a Chriflian. O, Sir, do not fay fo, re- 
flfd he, this Thing is not your Fault. No, fays i, 
but why did I never lay it to Heart as well as you ? 
^Tis not too late yet, Jaid he, be not coo forward to 
condemn yourfelf : But what can be done now, [aid 
/, you fee I am going away ? Will you give me leave, 
faid hey to talk with thofe poor Men about it ? Yes, 
with all my Heart, faid I, and will oblige them to i 
^ivc heed to what you fay too : As to that, faid he, 
we mufl leave them to the Mercy of Chnfl ; but 
^'cis our Bufinefs to aflift them, encourage them, and 
inflrud them ; and if you will give me Leave, and 
God his Blelling, i do not doubt but the poor igno- 
raijt Souls fhall be brought home into the great Cir- 
cle ol Chriflianity, if not into the particular Faith 
that we all embrace, and that even while you ftay 
here: Upon this, I faid, I (hall not only give you j 
Leave, but give you a thoufand Thanks for it. 
What followed on this Account, I fliall mention alfo 
again in its Place. 

I now prefs^'d him for the third Article, in which 
wewere to1:>lame. Why really, fays he, it is of the 
fame Nature, and I will proceed, asking your Leave^ \ 
vj'nh the fame Plainnefs as before j it is about your i 
poor Savages yonder, who are, as I may fay, your j 
conquer'd Subje6:s It is a Maxim, Sir, that iSy 
or ought to be receiv'd among all Chriflians of 
what Church, or pretended Church foever, Qviz.,) \ 
That Chriflian KuGzvIedge ought to be propagated by all 
poffible Means y and on aU poffibk Occafions : 'Tis on 
this Principle that our Church fends Miflionaries into 
Perjia^ India, and China, and that our Clergy, even 
of the tuperior Sort, willjngly engage in the moft 
hazardous Voyages, and the mofl: dangerous Refi- 
dence among Murderers and Barbarians, to teach 

them 



[ 131 ] 



tli^m the Knowledge cf the true God, and to bring 
them over to embrace the Chriflian Faith. Now, 
Sir, you have fiich an Opportunity here, to have Cik 
or (even and Thirty poor Savages brought over 
From Idolatry to the Knowledge of God, their Ma- 
ker and Redeemer, that I wonder how you can pafs 
{"uch an Occafion of doing Good, which is really 
vvorrh the Expence of a Man's whole Lite. 

I was now flrnck dumb indeed, and had not one 
Word to fay. I had here a Spirit of true Chrifliaa 
Zeal for God and Religion before me, let his par-' 
ticular Principles be of what kind foever ; as foe 
me, I had not fo much as entertained a Thought 
of this in my Heart before, and I believe fhould not 
have thought of it ; for I lookM upon thefe Sava* 
ges as Slaves, and People, who, had we any Work 
for them to do, we would ha' ufed as fuch, on 
would have been glad to have tranfported them to 
any other Part of the World ; for our Bufinefs was 
to get rid of them, and we would ail have been fa- 
tisfy'd, if they had been fent to any Country^ fo they 
had never feen their own : But to the Cafe, I fay, f 
was confounded at his Difcourfe, and knew, not 
what Anfwer to make him. He look'd earneftly at 
me, feeing me in fome Diforder, Sir, fiys he, I ihail 
be very ferry, if what I have faid gives you any Of*, 
fence : No, No, fays I, 1 am offended with no Body 
but myfelf ; but I am perfedly confounded, not on^ 
ly to think that I fhould never rake any Notice of 
this before, but with reflecting what Notice I am a- 
ble to take of it now. You know. Sir, faid /, what 
Circumflances I am in, I am bound to the Eafl-Indies^ 
in a Ship freighted by Merchants, and to w^hom ic 
would be an unfufferable Piece of Injuftice to detain 
their Ship here, the Men lying all this while at Vi- 
duals and Wages upon the Owners Accounts It is 
true, I agreed to be allow'd twelve Days here, and 
if I ftay more^ I muft pay 3 /. Sterling fer Diem 

I % Dei 



[ 132. ] 

Demorage, nor can I flay upon Demorage above eight 
Days more, and I have been here thirteen Days al- 
ready, fo that I am perfectly unable to engage in this 
Work, unkfs I would fufter myfelf to be left behind 
here again, in virhich Cafe, if this fingle Ship fhould 
miscarry in any Part of her Voyage, I (hould be 
juft in the fame Condition that I was left in here at 
firft, and from which I have been fo wonderfully de- 
livered. 

He own'd the Cafe was very hard upon mCj as to 
my Voyage j but laid it home upon my Confcience, 
whether the BlefTingof favingfeven and thirty Souls, 
was not worth my venturing all I had in the World 
for? I was not fo fenfible of that as he was, and I 
returned upon him thus ; why. Sir, it is a valuable 
Thing, indeed, to be an Inftrument in God's Hand 
to convert feven and thirty Heathens to the Know- 
ledge of Chrifl, but as you are an Ecclefiaftic, and 
are giving over to that Work, fo that it feems na- 
turally to fall into the Way of your ProfelTion ; how 
isitthenj that you do not rather ofter yourfe^fco 
undertake k, than preis me to it ? 

Upon this he fac'd about, jufl: before me, as we 
vvalk'd along, and putting me to a full Stop, made 
me a very low Bow ; I moft heartily thank God and 
you, Sir, Z^^^^^, for giving me fo evident a Call to 
fo blefied a Work ; and if you think your felf dif- 
charg'd from ir, and deiire me to undertake it, I will 
molt readily do it, and think it a happy Reward 
for all the Hazards and Difficulties of fuch a bro- 
ken difappointed Voyage as I have met with, that 
I may dropt at lafl inco fo glorious a Work. 

I difcover'd a kind of Rapture in his Face while 
he fpoke this to me ; his Eyes fparkl'd jlike Fire, his 
Face glow'd, and his Colour came and went, as if 
he had been falling inco Fits ; in a Word, he was 
fir'd with the Joy of beingembark'd in fuch a Work. 
Ipaus'd a confiderabie while before I could tell what 

to 



1^33 1 

to fay to him, for I was really furpriz'd to find a 
Man of fuch Sincerity and Zeal, and carry 'd out in 
his Zeal beyond the ordinary Rate of Men, not 
of his Profeffion only, but even of any ProfefFion what- 
foever. But after I had confiJer'd it a while, I ask'd 
himferioudy if he was in earned, and that he would 
venture on the fingle Conlideration of an Attempt on 
thole poor People, to be loc'd up in an unplanced I- 
fland for, perhaps, his Life ; and at laft might not 
know whether he fhould be able to do them any 
Good, or not ? 

He turn'd (hort upon me, and ask'd me what I cal- 
rd a Venture? Pray, Sir, f aid be, what do think I 
confentcd to go in your Ship to the Eafl- Indies iov > 
t^2Ly,faidIy that I know not, unleis it was to preach 
to the Indians: Doubtiefs it was faid he j and do 
you think, if I can convert thefe feven and thirty 
Men to the Faith of Chrifl, it is not worth my 
time, tho' I fhould never be fetched off the Ifland 
again ? nay, is it not infinitely of more worth 
tofavefomany Souls, than my Life is, or the Life 
of twenty more of the fame Profeffion ? Yes, Sir, 
fays he, I would give Chrift and the Bieifed Virgin 
Tlu^ks-^M my Days, if I could be made the leaO: 
happy Liflrument of faving the Souls of thefe poor 
Men, tho' I was never to fet my Foot off of this 
lOand, or fee my native Country any more. Buc 
Unce you will honour me, fays he, with putting 
me into this Work, for which I will pray for you all 
the Days of my Lije ^ I have one humble Petition to 
you, fatd he, befides. What is that, faid U Why, 
fays he, it is, that you will leave your Man Friday 
with me, to be my Interpreter to them, aud to affift 
me ,• for without fome Help 1 cannot fpeakto them, 
or they to me. 

I was fenfibly troubled at his requeuing ir/^/^jj/, 
becaufe I could not think of parting virith him, and 
that for many Reafons \ he had been the Companion 

I 3 oF 



[ 134 ] 

of my Travels ; he was not only faithful to me, but 
fincerely affectionate to the laft Degree; and I had 
refolv'd to do fomethirig confiderable for him, if he 
out liv'd me, as is was probable he would. Then 
I knew that, as I had bred Friday up to be a Prote- 
flant, it would quite confound him to bring him to 
embrace another ProteiTion ; and he would ne\ er, 
while his Eyes wereopen^, believe that his old Ma- 
iler was an Heretick and would be damn'd ; and 
this might m the End ruin the poor Feliow's Princi- 
ples, and fo turn him back again to his firil idola- 
try. 

However, a fudden Thought reliev'd me in this 
Strait, and it was this; I told him. 1 could not 
fay that I was willing to part with Friday on any 
Account whatever; tho' a Work that to him was 
of more Value than his Life, ought to be to me of 
much more Value than the keeping or parting with 
a Servant; But on the other hand, I was peifuad- 
ed that Friday would by no Means confenf to part 
with me, and I could not force him to it without 
hisConfenr, w^ould manifeft Injuflice i becaufe I had 
promifed I would never put him away, and he had 
promis'd and engag'dto me that he would never leave 
me, unlefs I put him away. 

He feem'd very much concern'd at it, for he had 
no rational Accefs to thefe poor People, feeing he 
did not underfland one Word of their Language, nor 
they one Word of his ; To remove this Difficulty, I 
told him, Friday's Father had learn 'd Spanip, which 
I found he alfo underftood, and he fliould ferve him 
for an Interpreter; fo he was much better (ati fied, 
and nothing could perfuade him but he would hay 
to endeavour to convert them ; but Providence gave 
another, and very happy, Turn to all this. 

I come back now to the firll Part of his Objedi- 
ons. When we come to the Englijh Men, I fent 
for tkm all together, and after fome Account gi- 
ven 



Iven them of what I had done for them, viz., what 
ncceflary Things I had provided for them, and how 
they were diftributed, which they were fenhble of, 
and very thankful for; I began to talk to them ot 
the fcandalous Lite they led, and gave them a full 
Account of the Notice the Clergyman had already 
taken of it, and arguing how unchriilian and irre- 
ligious a Life it was. 1 firfl: ask'd them if they were 
married Men or Batchelors ? They foon explain d 
their Condition to me, and (liew'd me that two or 
them were Widowers, and the other three were (in- 
gle Men or Batchelors. I ask'd them with what 
Confciences they could take thefe Women and lie 
with chem, as they had done, call them their Wives, 
^ and have fo many Children by them, and not be 
I marry 'd lawfully to them. 

I They all gave me the Anfwer that I expeded, viz., 
' that there was no Body to marry tiiem ; that they 
agreed before the Governor to keep them as their 
Wives j and to keep them and own them as their 
Wives j and they thought as Things flood with 
them, they were as legally married as if they had 
been married by a Parfon, and with all the Forma- 
lities in the World. , . 

I told them, that no doubt they Vv^ere married iii 
the Sight of God, and were bound ia Conlcience 
to keep them as their Wives, but that the Laws of 
Men being otherwife, they might pretend they were 
not married, and fo defert the poor Women and 
Children hereafter ; and that their Wives being 
poor defolate Women, hiendlefs and moneylefs, 
would have no way to help themfelves. I therefore 
told them, that unlefs I was affur'd of their honeit 
Intent, I could do nothing for them ; but would 
take Care that what I did fhould be for the Wo- 
men and their Children v/ithout them,- and that un- 
lefs they would give fome Affarances that they v/ould 
marry the Women, I could not think it was conve- 

I 4 nient 



p 



[ 13^] 



nient they fhoiild coutinue together as Man and 
Wife, for that it was borh fcandalous to Men, and 
offenfive to God, who they could chink would blefs 
rhem, i^ they went on thus. 

All this went on as 1 expecfted, and they told mQj 
efpecially Will. Atkins, who (eem'd now to fpeak for 
the reft, chat they lov'd their Wives as weUj^t as^ it 
they had been born in their own Native CStmciy, 
and would not leave them upon any Account wh^i- 
ever ; and they did verily believe their Wives were 
as virtuous and as modeft, and did, co the utmoil: 
of their Skill, as much for them, and for their Chil- , 
dren, as any Women could po/Iibly do, and they I 
would not part with them on any Account : And ' 
M^ill Atkins for his own particular added, if any Man 
would take him away, and offer to carry him home 
to England^ and make him Captain of the beft Man 
of War in the Navy, he would not go with him, i^ 
he might not carry his Wife and Children with 
him I and if there was a Clergyman in the Ship, he 
would be married to her now, with all his Heart. 

This was juft as I would have ic , the Priefl: was 
not with me at that Moment, but was nor far off: 
So to try him farther, I told him I had a Clergymi^n 
with me, and if he was iincere, I would have hira 
married the next Morning, and bid him consider of 
it, and talk with the reft; he faid, as for himfelf, 
he need not confider of it at all, for he was very 
ready to do ic, and was glad I had a Minifter with 
me, and he believ'd they would be all willing alfo. 
I then told him, that my Friend the Minifter Vv^as 
a Fre72ch Man^ and could not fpeak Englijb, but that 
1 would a6t the Clerk between them : He never fo 
much as ask'd me whether he was a Papift- or Pro- 
teftant, which was indeed what I was afraid of: 
But, I fay, they never enquired about it. So we 
parted, I went back to my Clergyman, and PFiU 
^r/^/«i went in to talk with h.s Companion^. Ide- 

fir'd 



[ in] 

fir'd the French Gentleman not to fay any thing 
to them, till the Bufinefs was thorough ripe, and 
I told him what Anfwer the Men had given me. 

Before I went from their Quarter, they all came 
to me, and told me, they had been confidering what 
I had faid •, that they were very glad to hear I had 
a Clergyman in my Company, and they were ve- 
ry willing to give me the Satisfadion I delir'd, 
and to be formally married as foon as I pleas'd, 
for they were far from deliring to part with their 
Wives, and that they meant nothing but what 
was very honefi: when they chofe them •, fo I ap- 
pointed them to meet me the next Morning, and 
that in the mean time they fhould let their Wives 
know the meaning of the Marriage-Law •, and that 
it was not only to prevent any Scandal, but alfo 
to oblige them, that they {hould not for fake them, 
whatever might happen. 

The "Women were ealily made feniible of the 
Meaning of the Thing, and were very well fatisfied 
v/ith it, as, indeed, they had lleafon to be •, fo they 
fail'd not to attend all together at my Apartment 
the next Morning, where I brought out my Clergy- 
man •, and tho' he had not on a Minifter's Gown, 
after the Manner of England, or the Habit of a 
Prieft^ after the Manner o^Frayice-^ yet having a 
black Yeft fom.ething like a CaiTock, with a Saih 
round it, he did not look very unlike a Minifter • 
and as for his Language, I was his Interpreter. 

But the Serioufnefs of his Behaviour to them, 
and the Scruples he made of marry' ng the V/omen, 
becaufe they were notbaptiz'd, and profefs'd CZ?n- 
fl'ians^ gave them an exceeding Reverence for his 
Perfon ^ and there was no need after that, to en- 
quire whether he was a Clergyman or no. 

Indeed, I was afraid his Scruple would have 
been carry'd fo far. as that he would not have 
marry'd them at all •, nay, notwithftanding all I 
was able to fay to him, *he refifted sane, tliough 

modeftly, 



[138 ] 

modeftlj, yet verj fteadil}^, and at laft refufed ab- 
folutei}'- to marry them, iinlefs he had firft talk'd 
with the Men, \ nd the Women too •, and though 
at firft I was a little backv/ard to it, yet at laft I 
agreed to it with a good Will, perceiving the Sin- 
cerity of his Deiign. 

When he came to them, he let them know, that 
I had acquainted him with their Circumftances, and 
with the prefent Deiign: That he was very willing 
to perform that Fart of his Fuiidicn, and marry 
them as I had defir'd •, but that before he could do 
it, he mull talce the Liberty to talk with them. 
He told them, That in the Sight of all indifierent 
Men, and in the Senfe of the Laws of Society, 
they had liv'd all this while in an open Adulte- 
ry •, and that it was true, that nothmg^ but the 
Ccnfenting to mari}^, or eifeanally feparating them 
from one another now, could put an End to it •, but 
there was a Difficulty m it too, with refpe6t to the 
Laws of Qhrifian Matrimony, which he was not 
fully fatisfy'd about, vi%. That of marrying one 
that is a profefs'd Chrijiia7i, to a Savage, an Ido- 
later, and a Heathen, one that is not baptiz'd •, and" 
yet that he did not fee that there was Time left for 
it to endeavour to perfuade the Women to be bap- 
tiz'd, or to profefs the Name o^Chrifl, whom they 
had, he doubted, heard nothing of, and without" 
which they could not be baptiz'd. 

He told them. He doubted they were but indif- 
ferent Chiiftians themfelves •, that they had but lit- 
tle Knowledge of Goi, or of his Ways- and there- 
fore he could not expeft that they had faid m.uch 
to their Wives on that Head yet-, but that unlefs 
they would promife him to ufe their Endeavours 
with their Wives,to perfuade them to become Chri- 
ftians, and would as v/ell as they could inftrud: 
them in the Knowledge and Belief of God that 
made them, and to worfhip Jefus Chrift that re- 
deem'd them, he could not many them-, for he 

would 



[ 139 ] 

would have no Hand in joyning Chriftians with 
Savages •, nor was it confiftent with the Principles 
of the Chriftian Religion •, and was indeed expref- 
ly forbidden in God's Law. 

They heard all this very attentively, and I deli- 
ver'd it very faithfully to them, from his Mouth, as 
near his ovvn Words as I could, only fometimes ad- 
ding fomething of my own to convince them how 
3uft it was, and how I was of his Mind •, and I al- 
ways very faithfully diftinguifli'd between what 
I faid from my felf,and what were the Clergyman's 
Words. They told me, it was ver}^ true, what the 
Gentleman had faid, that they v/ere but very 'm- 
different Chrijliavs themfelves, and that they had 
never talk'd to their "Wives about Religion. Lord^ 
Sir ! fays Will. Atldyn, How fhould we teach them 
Religion >^ Why we know nothing our felves-, and 
befides. Sir, [aid he^ Ihould we go to talk to them 
ofGoJ,and yefm Chrijl^ and Heaven andiFIelL 'twould 
be to make them laugh at us, and ask us. What 
we believe our felves > And if we fl^ould tell them 
we believe all the Things that we ijieak of to them, 
fuch as of good People going to Heavejt^ and v/ick- 
ed People to the Devil, they would ask us, Where 
we intended to go our felves, that believe all this, 
and are fuch wicked Fellows, as we indeed are > 
Why, Sir, faid Ifill^ 'tis enough to give them a 
Surfeit of Religion at firft Hearing : Folks mufl: 
have fome Religion themfelves, before the^r pre- 
tend to teach other People : JFill Atkins, faid I to 
hifU'^ though I am afraid what you fay has too 
much Truth in it, yet can you not tell your Wife 
that fhe's in the wrong ? That there is a God and 
a Religion better than her own^ that her Gods 
are Idols, that they can neither hear nor fpeak ^ 
that there is a great Being that made all Things, 
and that can deftrov all that he had made^ that 
he rewards the Good, and punishes the Bad ^ and 
that we are to be judg'd by him at lall for all we 

d® 



r 140 1 

do here : You are net fo ignorant, but even Na- 
ture it felf will teach you that all this is true, and 
I am fatisfy'dyouknowit all to be true, and be- 
lieve it yourfelf. 

That's true, Sir, faid Atki77s •, but with what Face 
can I fay any thing to my Wife of all this, when 
Ihe will tell me immediately it cannot be true> 

Not true 1 /aid I, What do you mean by that ? 
Wh}?^ Sir, faid he^ She will tell me it cannot be 
true, that this God I fnall tell her of can be juft, 
or can punifn, or reward, fmce I am not puniih'd, 
and fent to the Devil, that have been fuch a 
wicked Creature as ihe kncvv^s I have been, even 
to her, and to every Body elfe ^ and that I fhould 
be fuffer'd to live, that have been always ading fo 
contrary to what I mult tell her is Good, and to 
what I ought to have done, 

Why, trul}^, Athnsj faid J, I am auaid thou 
fpeak'ft too much Truth; and with tnatl let the 
Clergyman know what Atlir.s had faid, for he was 
impatient to know. 1 faid the PrieJI -^ tell him 
there is one Thing wdl m.ake him the beft Minifter 
intheW"orld to hisW^ife, and that is, Rej)e7itance -^ 
for none teach Repentance like true penitents : He 
wants nothing but to repent, and then he will be 
fo much the better qualifv'd to inftrucl his Wife : 
He will be then able to tell her, that there is not 
only a God, and that he is the jufi: Rewarder of 
Good and Evil, but that he is a merciful Being, 
and with infinite Goodnefs and Long-fuffering for- 
bears to puniih thofe tliat offend •, waiting to be 
gracious, and willing not the Death of a Sinner, 
but rather that he fliould return and live •, that 
oftentimes fuffers wicked Men to go on a long 
Time, and even referves Damnation to the gene- 
ral Day of Retribution ; that it is a clear Evi- 
dence of God, and of a future State, that-tighteous 
Men receive not their Reward, or wicked Men 
their Punilbme^t, till they ccme into another 

World i 



[ HI ] 



World; and this will lead him to teach his Wife 
the Dodrine of the Refurreftion, and of the laft 
Judgment ; let him but repent for himfelf, he will 
be an excellent Preacher of Repentance to his 
Wife. 

I repeated all this to Atkins^ who look'd very fe- 
rious all the while, and who, we could eafily perceive, 
was more than ordinarily afteded with it : When be- 
ing eager, and hardly fuftcring me to make an End, 
I know all this, Mafler, fays he, and a great deal more j 
but I han't the Impudence to talk thus to my Wife i 
when God, and my own Confcience knowSj and my 
Wife will be an undeniable Evidence againfl me, 
that I haveliv'd, as if I had never heard of a God, 
or future State, or any Thing about it ; and to talk 
of my repenting, ALAS! And with that he fetch'' d a 
deep Sigh ; and I could fee, that Tears flood in his 
Eyes; 'Tis paft all that with me. Paft it ! AT- 
K IN S,>'^/, What do'fl thou mean by that ? I 
know well enough what I mean. Sir, fays he, I mean 
'tis too late, and that is too true. 

I told my Clergyman Word for Word what he 
faid ; the poor zealous Friell (I muR call him fo ', for, 
be his Opinion what it will, he had certainly amoft 
(ingular Affedion for the Good of other Mens Souls h 
and ii would be hard to think he had not the like 
for his own) I fay, this zealous affedionate Man, 
could not refrain Tears alfo : But, recovering him- 
felf, he faid tome, ask him but one Queftion, Is he 
eafy that it is too late, or is he troubled, and wilhes 
it were not fo ? I put the Queftion fairly to Atkins, 
and he anfwered with a great deal of PafTion, How 
could any Man be eafy in a Condition that certainly 
muftend in eternal Deilrudion? that he was far from 
being eafy, but that on the contrary, he believ'd it 
would one Time or other ruin him. 

What do you mean by that ? faid I, Why, he faid 
he believ'd he fhould, one Time or others cut his 
Throat to put an End to th^ Terror of it. 

^ ^ ~ The 



[ Hi ] 



The Clergyman fhook his Head with a great CoQ" 
cern in his Face, when I told him all this : but turn- 
ing quick to me upon ir, fays he. If that be his Cafe, 
you may afTure him ic is not too late ; Chrifl will 
give him Repentance : But pray, fays he^ explain 
this to him, That as no Man is fav'd but by Chriil: 
and the Merit of his Pallion, procuring divine Mercy 
for him, how can it be too late for any Man to re- 
ceive Mercy ? Does he think he h able to (in beyond 
the Power or Reach of Divine Mercy > Pray tell 
him, there may be a Time when provok'd Mercy 
will no longer llrive, and when God may refufe to 
heatj^but that ^tis never too late for Men to ask Mer- 
cy s and we that are Chnft's Servants are commanded 
to peach Mercy at all times, in the Name of Jefus 
Chrifi, to allthofe thatfincerely repent ^ fo that \is ne- 
ver too late to repent. 

I told Atkins all this, and he heard me with great 
Earneftnefs ; but it feem'd as if he turn'doff the Dif- 
courfe to the reft ; for he faid to me, he w^ould go 
and have feme Talk with his Wife j fo he went out 
awhile, and we talk^'d to the reft. I perceiv^'d they 
were all ftupidly ignorant as to Matters of Religion^ 
much as I was when I went rambhng away from m y 
Father ,* and yet that there were none of them back- 
vv^ard to hear what had been (aid ; and all of them fe- 
rioufly promised that they would talk with their Wives 
about it, and do their Endeavour to perfuade them to 
turn Chriftians. 

The Clergyman fmil'd upon me, when I reported 
what Anfwer they gave, but faid nothing a good 
while ; but, at lafl, ftiaking his Head, We that are 
Chrift's Servants, fays he, can go on further ^than to 
exhort and inftrud ; and when Men comply, fubmit 
to the Reproof, and promife what we ask "'tis all we 
can do ,* we are bound to accept their good Words | 
But believe me. Sir, faid he, whatever you may have 
known of the Life of that Man you call IVil/. Atkins, 

I be- 



[ H3 ] 

I believe he is the only fincere Convert among them ; 
I take that JVIan to be a true Penitent ; I wont defpair 
of the reft j but that Man is patiently ftruck with 
the Senfe of his pad Lite j and 1 doubt not, but when 
he comes to talk religion to his Wile, he will talk 
himleif efFedually into it ; for attempting to teach o- 
thers, is fometimes the beft way of teaching ourfelves I 
knew a Man, added he, who having nothing but a fum- 
mary Notion of Religion himfelf, and being wicked 
and profligate to the laft Degree in his LKq, made a 
thorough Reformation in himfelf, by labouring to 
convert a Jevj. If that poor ^^/^/^^j begins but once 
to talk ferioLiily of Jcfcs Chriil: to his Wife, my Life 
for it, he talks himfelf into a thorough Convert, 
makes himfelf a Penitent : And who knows what may 
follow ? 

Upon this Difcourfe however, and their promifing, 
as above, to endeavour to perfuade their Wives to 
embrace Chriftianiry, he marryM the other three 
Couple ; but Will Atkins and his Wife were not yec 
come in. After this, my Clergyman, waiting a while, 
was curious to know were Atkins was gone ; and, 
turning to me, fays he, I entreat you. Sir, let us walk 
out of your Labyrinih here, and look i I dare fay, 
we (liall hnd this poor Man fomewhere or other talk- 
ing ferioufly to his Wife, and teaching her already 
fomething of Religion. I began to be of the fame 
Mind 5 fo we went out together, and I carry a him 
a Way which none knew but my felf, and where the 
Trees were fo thick fet, as that it was not eafy to 
fee thro' the Thicket of Leaves, and far harder to 
fee in, than to fee out ; when, coming to rhe Edge of 
the Wood, I fav^ Atkins and his tawny Savage 
Wife fitting under the Shade of a Bufii, very eager 
in Difcourfe ; I ftop'd fhort till my Clergymen came 
up to me ,* and then having fhow'd him. where they 
were, we ftood and look'd very fteadily at them a 
good while. 



[ H4 ] 

We obferv'd him very earnefl: with her, pointing 
up to the Sun, and to every Quarter of the Heavens ; 
then down to the Earth, then out to the Sea, then 
to himfelf, then to her, to the Woods, to the Trees. 
Now, fays my Clergyman, you fee my Words are 
made good ; the Man preaches to her ; mark him^ 
now he is telling her, that our God has made him, 
and her, and the Heavens, the Earth;» the Sea, the 
Woods, the Trees, &c. I believe he is, /aid I ; im- 
mediately we perceivM Will Atkins ftart up upon his 
Feet, fail down on his Knees, and life up both his 
Hands : We fuppofe he faid fome thing, but we 
could not hear him, it was too far for thau ,• he did 
not continue kneeling half a Minute, but comes and 
(its down again by his Wife, and talks to her again. 
We perceived then the Women very attentive, but 
whether fhe faid any thing or no we could not tell, 
while the poor Fellow was upon his Knees, I could 
fee the Tears run plentifully down my Clergyman's 
Cheeks, and I could hardly forbear my felf ; but it 
was a great Afflidion to us both, that we were not 
near enough to hear any Thing that pafs'd between 
them» 

Well, however, we could come no nearer for fear 
ofdifturbing them, fo we refolv'd to fee an End of 
this Piece of flill Convsrfation, and it fpoke loud 
enough to us, without the Help of Voce. He 
fat down again, as I have faid, clofe by her, and 
talkM again earneflly to herj and two or threev 
Times we could fee him embrace her mod paffio- 
nately, another time wefaw him take out his Hand- 
kerchief and wipe her Eyes, and then kifs her again, 
with a kind of Tranfport very unufual i and after fe- 
veral of thefe Things we fee him, on a fuddcn, jump 
up again and lend her his Hand to help her up» 
when immediatly, leading her by the Hand a Step 
or two, they both kneel'd down together, and conti- 
nued fo about two Minutes. 

My

My Friend could bear k no longer, bat cries out 
aloud, St. P A UL St. P A UL ! Mold he prayeth ; 
I was 2i^'C2i\d Atkins would hear him, therefore 1 en- 
treated him to withhold himfelf awhile, that we 
might fee an End of the Scene, which to me, I 
muft confefs, was the moft affeding, and yet the 
moft agreeable that ever 1 faw in my Life ; Well, 
he drove with himfelf and contained himfelf for a 
while, but was in fnch Raptures of Joy, to think that 
the poor Heathen Woman was become a Chriftian, 
I that he was not able to contain himfelf j he wept fe- 
' veral Times, then throwing up his Hands andcrofling 
: iiis Breail:, faid over feveral Things Ejaailat^y .and 
by way of giving God Thanks for fo miraculous a 
Tefiimony of the Succefs of our Endeavours j fome 
he fpoke foftly, and I could not well hear ; others 
' audibly, fome in Latin, fome in French ; then two oc 
three Times the Tears of Joy would interrupt him, 
that he could not fpeak at all : But 1 htgd that he 
would compofe himfelf, and kt us more narrowly and 
j fully obferve what was before us, v^rhich he did 
I for a Time, and the Scene was not ended there 
i yet ; for after the poor Man and his Wife were ri- 
■fen again from their Knees, we obferv'd he flood 
talking ftill eagerly to her ,* and we obferv'd by hec 
Motion, that (he was greatly affe&d with what 
he faid, by her frequent lifting up her Hands, lay- 
ing her Hand to her Breaft, and fuch other Pof- 
tures, as ufually exprefs the greateft Serioufnefs 
and Attention. This continu'd about half a Quar- 
ter of an Hour, and then they walked away too 5 
To that we could fee no more of them in that Si- 
tuation. . ; 

I took this interval to talk with my Clergyman i 
And firfl, I told him, 1 was glad to fee the Parti-

both in the Man and his Wife, however ignorant 
they might both be •, and I hop'd fuch a Beginning 
would have a yet more happy End-, and who 
knows, faid I, but thefe two may in Time, by In- 
ftrudtion and Example, work upon fome of the 
others > Some of them 1 faid he, turning quick upn 
nie, ay, upon all of them -, depend upon it, if thofe 
two Savages, for he has been but little better, as 
you relate it, {hould embrace Jefus Chrift, they 
will never leave 'till they work upon all the reft-, 
for true Religion is natu-ally communicative, and 
he that is once made a Chriftian, will never leave 
a Pagan behind him, if he can help it. I own'd 
it was a moft Chriftian Principle to think fo, and 
a Teftimony of a true Zeal, as well as a generous 
Heart in him: But, my Friend, faid I, will you 
give me Leave to ftart one Difficulty here ? I can- 
not tell how to objed the leaft Thing againft that 
affedionate Concern, which you {hew for the turn- 
ing the poor People fom their Paganifm to the 
Chriftian Religion : But how does this comfort 
you, while thefe People are in your Account out 
of the Pale of the Catholick Church, without 
which you believe there is no Salvation •, fo that 
you efteem thefe but Hereticks, and for other 
Reafons as effectually loft as the Pagans them- 
felves. 

To this he anfwer'd with abundance of Candor 
and Chriftian Charity thus •, Sir, I am a Catholick 
of the Roman Church, and a Prieft of the Order 
of St. Benedi^^ and I embrace all the Principles of 
the Rovim Faith : But yet if you will believe me, 
and that I do not fpeah in Compliment to you, or in 
refpeEt to 7ny Circumjlances and your Civilities \ I 
fay, neverthelefs, I do not look upon you, who call 
your felves reformed, without fome Charity: I 
dare not fav, tho' I know it is our Opinion in general •, ^ 

fay. 



[ 13^ ] 

fdy, I dare not fay that you cannot be fav'd : I will 
by no Means limit the Mercy of Chrift io far, as 
to think that he cannot receive 3^011 into the 
Bofom of his Church in a Manner to us unpercei- 
vable, and which it is limpoilibie for us to know ^ 
and I hope you have the fame Charity for us •, I 
pray daily for your being all reftor'd to Chrift's 
Church, by whatfoever Methods he, who is All- 
wtfe^ is pleas'd to direct : In the mean Time, fure 
you will allow it to coniifl: with me, as a Roman, 
to diftinguilli far between a Proteftant and a Pa- 
gan ', between one that calls on Jefus Chrift, tho' 
in a Way which I do not think is according to the 
true Faith : and a Savage, a Barbarian, that knows 
no God, no Chrift, no Redeemer at all ^ and if 
jrou are not within the Pale of the Catholiclc 
Church, v/e hope you are nearer being reftor'd to 
it than thofe that know nothing at all, of God or 
his Church : I rejoice therefore when I fee this poor 
Man, who you fay has been a Profligate, and al- 
moft a Murderer, kneel down and pray to Jefus 
Chrift, as we fuppofe he did, tho' not fully en« 
lighten'd ^ believing that God, from whom every 
fuch Work proceeds, will fenfibly touch his Heart, 
and bring him to the further Knowledge of the 
Truth in his own Time and if God ftiall influence 
this poor Man to convert and inftrud the ignorant 
Savage his Wife, I can never believe that he fliall 
be caft away himfelf •, and have I not Reafon then 
to rejoice, the nearer any are brought to the' Know- 
ledge of Chrift, tho' they may not be brought quite 
home into the Bofom of the Catholick Church, 
juft at the time when I may deiire it > leaving it 
to the Goodnefs of Chrift to perfed his Work in 
his own time, and his own Way : Certainly I would 
rejoice if all the Savages in Ainerica were brought 
Hke this poor Woman to pray to God, tho' they

were to be all Proteftants at firft, rather than they 
{hould continue Pagans and Heathens ^ firmljr be- 
lieving, that he that had beftow'd that firft Light 
to them, would further illuminate them with a 
Beam of his heavenly Grace, and bring them in- 
to the Pale of his Church when he {hould fee 
good. 

I was aftonifh'd at the Sincerity and Temper of 
this truly pious Papift, as much as I was opprefs'd 
by the Power of his Reafoning ♦, and it prefently 
occur'd to my Thoughts, that if fuch a Temper 
was univerfal, we might be all Catholick Chrifti-^ 
ans, whatever Church or particular Profeflion we 
joined to, or join'd in •, that a Spirit of ^ Charity 
would foon work us all up into right Principles 5 
and in a Word, as he thought that the like Charity 
Would make us all Catholicks, fo I told him I be* 
liev'd,| had all the Members of his Church the like 
Moderation, they would foon be all Proteftants. 
And there we left that Part, for we never difputed 
at all. 

However, I talk'd to him another waj^-, and ta- 
hiTig him by the Hand^ my Friend, fays I, I wifh all 
the Clergy of the Roman Church were bleft with 
fuch Moderation, and had an equal Share of you* 
Charity. I am entirely of your Opinion ♦, but I 
muft tell you, that if you Ihould preach fuch Do- 
ctrine in Spain, or Italy, they would put you into 
the Inqiiifition, 

It may be lo, faid he, I know not what they 
might do in Spain or Italy, but I will not fay they 
would be the better Chriftians for that Severity, 
for I am fure there is no Herefy in too much Cha^ 
rity. 

Well, as Will Atlim and liis Wife were gone, our 
Bulinefs there was over *, fo we went back our own 
Way^ and when we came back, we found them 

waiting 



[ 149 ] 

waiting to be call'd in : Obferving this, I aslc'd rvj 
Clergyman if we fliould difcover to him that we 
had leen him under the Bulh, or no-, and it was 
his Opinion we fliould not •, but that we fliould 
talk to him firft, and hear what he would fay^ to 
us-, fo we call'd him in alone, no Body being 
in the Place but our felves -, and I began with him 
thus : 

If ill Atlim, faid I, prithee what Education had 
you ? What was your Father > 

If. A, A better Man than ever I Ihall be. Sir^ 
viy Father was a Clergpnan, 

R. C What Education did he give you > 

If A. He would have taught me well, Sir ^ but 
I defpis'd all Education, Inftrudion, or Corredion, 
like a Beaft as I was. 

R. C It's true, Solomon fays, he that defpfes Re- 
proof is briitiJI), 

If. A, Ay, Sir, I was brutiili, indeed, I murdered 
my Father -, for God's fake Sir, talk no more about 
that. Sir, I murder'd my poor Father. 

Pr, Ha ! a Murderer I ^ 

"^ Here the Frlejl ftarted (for I interpreted every 
Word as he fpoke it) and look'd pale, Itfeems 
he believ'd that Will had really kilVd his own 
Father* 

R, C No, no, Sir, I do not under ftand him fo 5 
Jfill Atkirts^ explain yourfelf, you did not kill your 
Father, did you, with your own Hands > 

Jf,A, No, Sir, I did not cut his Throat-, but I 
cut the Thread of all his Comforts, and {horten'd his 
Days -, I broke his Heart by the moft ungrateful un- 
natural Return, for the moft tender affedionate 
Treatment that ever Father gave, or^ Child could 
receive, 

K 2 K» C 



[ 150 ] 

R, C Well, I did not aslc you about your Father 
to extort this Confefllon •, I pray God give you 
Repentance for it, and forgive you that, and all 
your other Sins -, but I ask'd you, becaufe I fee, 
that tho' you have not much Learning, yet 3^ou are 
not fo ignorant as fort^e are, in Things that are 
Good 5 that you have known more of Religion a 
great deal than jou have practifed. 

?r. A. Tho' you, Sir, did not extort the Con- 
feflion that I make a}>out my Father, Confcience 
does*, and when ever we come to look back upr 
on our Lives, the Sins againfl: our indulgent Pa- 
rents are certainly the firft that touch us •, the 
Wounds they make lie deepeft, and the Weight 
they leave will lie heavieft upon the Mind, of 
all the Sins we can commit. 

K. C ^ You talk too feelingly and fenlibly for 
nie Athhis'^ I cannot bear it. 

1K A, You bear it, Mailer 1 I dare fay you know 
nothing of it. 

R. C Yes, Atliim every Shore, every Hill, nay, 
I may fay, every Tree in this Ifland is witnefs 
to the Anguifh of my Soul, for my Ingratitude 
and bafe Ufage of a good tender Father •, ^a Father 
much like yours, by your Defcription •, and I mur- 
der'd my Father as well as you, Will Atkhis •, but 
think, for all that, my Repentaixe is Ihort of 
yours too ^ by a great deal. 

^ I would have f aid mon^ if I could have 
refirahi'd my Pajjiovs *, but I thought this 
poor Man's Repeiitavce rras fo much fine er 
rer than mive^ that I was going to leave 
of the Difcourfe and retire^ for I was 
jiirpri%'d 7vith what he [aid ^ and thought, 
that ivflead of viy going about to teach 



[ 151 ] 

ayd hijlriiB hini., the Man was maie a 
Teacher and InfiniBer to me^ in a moji 
fiiririxing and iinexpeBed manner, 

I laid all this before the young Clergyman, 
who was greatly afFeded with it, and {kid to 
me, Did I not fay, Sir, that when this Man was 
converted, he would preach to us all > I tell you. 
Sir, if this one Man be made a true Penitent, 
here will be no need of me, he will make Chri- 
ftians of all in the ffland. But having a little 
composed my felf, I renew'd my Difcourfe with 
Will Atkins. 

But JfIL L, faid I, How comes the Senfe of this 
Matter to touch you juft now ? 

TF. A. Sir, you have fet me about a Work that 
has ftiuck a Dart thro* my very Soul •, I have 
been talking about God and Religion to my 
Wife, in order, as you direded me, to make a 
Chriftian cf her, and (he has preach'd fuch a 
Sermon to me, as I ftiall never forget while I 
live. 

K. C. Noy no^ it is not your Wife has preach'd 
to you •, but when you were movir.g religious Ar- 
guments to her, Confcience has flung them back 
upon you. 

JT. A. Ay, Sir, with fuch a Force as is not to 
be refifted. 

R. C Pray If ill, let us know what pafs'd be- 
tween you and your Wife, for I know fomething 
of it already. 

JT, A, Sir, it is impoffible to give you a full 
Account of it ^ I am too full to hold it, and yet 
have no Tongue to exprefs it •, but let her have 
laid what flhe will, and tho' I cannot give you an 
Account cf it, this I can tell you of it, that I re*" 
iblve to amend and reform my Life, 

K4 KC 



C i5i ] 

R. C. But tell us foine cf it. How did you be- 
gin Jfill ? For this has been an extraordinary Cafe, 
that's certain. She has preach'd a Sermon, indeed, 
if fhe has wrought this upon yojf, 

JF, A, Why, 1 firft told her the Nature cf our 
Laws about Marriage, and what the Reafons were, 
that Men and "Women were oblig'd to enter into 
fuch Compads, as it was neither in the Power of 
one or other to break •, that otherwife, Order and 
Juftice could not be maintain'd, and Men would 
run from their Wives, and abandon their Chil- 
dren, mix confufedly with one another, and nei- 
ther Families be kept entire, or Inheritances be 
fettled by legal Defcent. 

R, C You talk like a Civilian, Tfill •, could you 
make her underftand what 3^ou meant by Inheri- 
tance and Families? they know no fuch Thing 
among the Savages, but marry any how, without 
regard to Relation, Confanguinity, or Family^ 
Brother and Sifter v^iay, as I have been told-, 
e\^en the Father and Daughter, and Son and the 
Mother. 

W. A, I believe, Sir, you are mifinform'd, and 
my Wife afliires me of the contrary, and that they 
abhor it •, perhaps, for any farther Relations they 
naay not be fo e^jcad as we are •, but fhe tells me 
they never touch one another in the near Relations 
you fpeak of. 

R. C Well, what did {he fay, to what you 
told her. 

If, A. She faid, fhe lik'd it very well, and it 
was much better than in her Country. 

R. C But did you tell her what Marriage 
was? 

TK A. Ay, 'ay, there began all our Dialogue. 
I ask'd her if ihe would be marry'd to me our 

Way ? 



[ 15? ] 

Way ? Slie ask'd me what Way that was ? I told 
her that Marriage was appointed of God ^ and here 
yrQ had a ftrange Talk together, indeed, as ever 
Mail and Wife had I believe, 

N. B. This Dialogue between W. Atkins ajii 
his Ififi-y as I took it down in writing^ 
jiiJJ: after he told it me^ was as follows, 

Wife. Appointed by your God ! why have you 
a God in your Country > 

IK A. Yes, my Dear, God is in every Coun- 
try. 

W^ife. No, your God in my Country ♦, my Coun- 
try have the great old Benamiiche God. 

F". A. Child, I am very unfit to {hew 3rou 
who God is-, God is in Heaven, and made the 
Heaven and the Earth, the Sea, and all that in 
them is. 

I Jfife, No makee de Earth •, no, you God make 
Ear n o make my Country, ^ 

^ W. A. laugh'd a little at her Ex^rejfwn of 
God not 7?iaki7ig her Comitry, 

Wife, No Laugh, why Laugh me> This no^ 
Thing to Laugh, t 

t He waijnfily reprov'd by his Wife, for fie 
was more ferious than he atfrfi, 

W. A. That's true indeed, I will not laugh any 
more my Dear. 

Wife, Why you fay, you God make all. 

W, A. Yes, Child, our God made the whole 
Worlds and you, and I, and all Things ^ for he 

is 



[ 154 ] 

is the only true God, there is no God but him, 
he lives for ever in Heaven. 

TFife, Why you no tell me long ago ? 

If, A. That's true indeed, but I have been b, 
wicked Wretch, and have not only forgotten to 
acquaint thee with any Thing before, but have 
lived without God in the World my felf 

Jfzfe, What have you de great God in you || 
Country, you no kno' kno' him ? No fay O to him > 
Ko do good Thing for him? That no pofllble 1 

7K J. It is too true, tho' for all that, we livei,| 
as if there was no God in Heaven, or that he had 
no Power on Earth. 

Wife. But wh}^ God let you do fo ? Why he i 
no makee you good live. 

Jf. A. It is all our own Fault. 

Wife, But you fay me, he is Great, much Great, 
have much great Power *, can makee kill, when he 
will •, why he no makee kill when you no ferve 
him ? Nofa}^ O to him> No be good Mans. 

W, A. That is true •, he might ftrike me Dead, 
and I ought to expcQ: it, for I have been a wickr 
ed Wretch, that is true •, but God is merciful, and 
does not deal with us as we deferve. 

Whfe, But then, do no you tell God Tankee 
for that too. 

W, A, No, indeed, I have not thank'd God 
for his Mercy, any more than I have fear'd God 
for his Power. 

Wife. Than you God no God-, me no think, 
believe, he be fuch one, great much Power, Strong ^ 
no makee kill you tho' you makee him much 
Angry. 

W. A, What ? Will my wicked Life hinder you 
from believing in God 1 what a dreadful Creature 
am 1 1 and what a fad Truth is it, that the horrid 
Lives of Chriftians hinders the Converfions of Hea- i 
thens? 

riff,

Tfife. How me link you have great much God 
t up there, and yet no do well, no do good Ting > 
can he tell ? Sure he no tell what you do ? 

t She pints up to Heaven^ 

jr. A. Yes, yes, he knows and fees all Things •, 
he hears us fpeak, fees what we do, knows what 
we think, tho' we do not fpeak. 

Wife. What 1 he no hear you fwear, curfe, fpeak 
the great Damn ? 

Jf, A, Yes, yes, he hears it all. 

W. Where be then the muchee great Power 
ftrong ? 

W. A, He is merciful, that's all we can fay for 
it •, and this proves him to be the true God •, he is 
God and not Man •, and therefore we are not con- 
fum'd. if 

if Here Will Atkins toli us he was flruck with 
Horror^ to think how he conU tdl his Tfife fo 
dearly that God feesj and hears, and knows 
the fecret Thoughts of the Hearty and all that 
we do •, and yet that he had dar d to do all the 
vile Things he had done, 

Jfife. Merciful 1 what you call that ? 
^ If A, He is our Father and Maker, and he pi- 
ties and fpares us. 

Wife. So then he never makee kill, never angry 
when you do wicked •, then he no good himfelf, or 
no great able, 

W. A* Tes^ yes^ my Dear^ he is infinitel3r good , 
and infinitely great, and able to punifh too \ and 
fometimes to ,fhew his Juftice and Yengeance, he 
lets fly his Anger to deftroy Sinners, and make 
Examples ^ many are cut off in their Sins. 



[ 15^ ] 

Wife. But no makee kill j^ou yet, than he tell 
you 7nay be that he no make yon kill, lo you make 
de Bargain with him, you do bad Thing, he no 
be angry at you, when he be angry at other 
Mans. 

W^, A, No indeed, my Sins are all Prefump^ 
tions upon his Goodnefs ^ and he would be infi- 
nitely juft if he deftroy'd me as he has done other 
Men. 

Wife. Well, and yet no kill, no makee you dead, 
what you fay to him for that, you no tell him- 
Tankee for all that too ? 

W, A. I am an unthankful, ungrateful Dog, 
that's true. 

Wife. Why he no makee y.u much good better, 
you fay he makee you. 

W. A. He made me as he made all the World ^ 
'tis I have deform'd my felf, and abus'd his Good- 
nefs, and made my felf an abominable Wretch. 

Wife. I wifh )^ou makee God know me, 1 no 
makee him angry, I no do bad wicked thing. 

Hen Will Atkins fall his Heart fiiyik within 
hhn^ to hear a [wor untaught Creature de- 
fire to he taught to htovp Godj and he fiich 
■ a wicked wretch^ that he could not fay one 
TPord to her about God, but what the Re- 
proach of his own Carriage would make moji 
irrational to her to believe • nay^ that al- 
ready fl)e had told hhn^ that fie could not 
believe In God^ becaufe he that was fo wick- 
ed was not deft r of d. 

W. A, My Dear, 3^ou mean, you wifh I could 
teach you to know God, not God to know you ^ 
for he knows you already, and every Thought in 
your Heart. 

Wife. 



[ 157] 

Wife. Why then he know what I fay to ydxi 
now > He know me wi{h to know him •, how mall 
me know who makee me ? 

Jf. A, Poor Creature, he muft teach thee,- I 
cannot teach thee ^ I'll pray to him to teach thee 
to know him, and to forgive me that I am un- 
worthy to teach thee. 

The poor Fellow was hi fiich an Agojiy at her 
defirhtg him to male her hnow God^ and her 
iv'ijlnng to hiow hhn^ that^ he faid, he fell 
down on his Knees before her, and prafd to 
God to enlighten her Mind with the faving 
Knowledge of Jefiis Chrift, and to pardon his 
Sins^ and accept of his being the unworthy In- 
Jiriiment of injIriiBing her in the Frinciples of 
Religion ^ after which he fate down by her 
again J and their Dialogue went on, N. B. 
This was the Time when we faw him 
kneel down, and lift up his Hands. 

Jfife, What you put down the Knee for ? What 
you hold up the Hand for ? What you fay > Who 
jrou fpeak to > What is that ? 

Jf, A, My Dear, I bow my Knees in Token of 
iny Submiflion to him that made me •, I faid O to 
him, as you call it, and as you fay, your old Men 
do to their Idol Bejtamiickee -^ that is, I pray'd to 
him. 

W'ife, What you fay O to him for > 

Jf, A. I pray'd to him to open your Ej^es, and 
your Underftanding, that you may know him, and 
be accepted by him. 

Wife. Can he do that too > 

jr. A. Yes, he can, he can do all Things, 

Wife. But no he hear what you fay } 

r. A. 



[ 1^2 ] 

TV. A, Yes, he has bid us pray to him, and pro- 
mised to hear us. 

Wije, Bid you pray ? When he bid you ? How he 
bid you ? What ! you hear him fpeak ? 

IV. A. No, we do not hear him fpeak, but he has 
reveal'd himfelf many Ways to us. 

Here he was at a great Lofs to make her under- 
flandy that God has reveaVd himfelf to us 
by his Wordy and what his Word was : But 
at lafl be told it her thus. 

W. A. God has fpoken to fome good Men in 
former Days, even from Heaven, by plain Words 5 
and God has infpir'd good Men by his Spirit! 
and they have written all his Laws down in a 
Book. 

Wife. Me no underfland that, where is Book I 

W. A* Alas, my poor Creature^ I have not this? 
Book ; but I hope I fliall one Time or other get it 
for you to read it. 

Here he emhracd her with great AffeBion > hut 
with inexprejfible Grief that he had not a 
Bible. 

Wife But how you makee me know, that God 
teachee them to write that Book ? 

W^ A. By the fame Rule that we know him to be 
God. 

Wife. What Rule, what Way you know. 

W.A. Becaufe he teaches and commands no- 
thing but what is good, righteous, and holy i 
and pretends to make us perfedly good, as well as 

per- 






[ 159 1 



' I perfedly happy ; and bcckufe he forbids and com- 
mands us to avoid all that is wicked, that is evil 
in it felf, or evil in its Confequences. 

fj/ife. That niie would iinderftand, thaf me faiti 
fee ; if he teachee all good Thing, fc^rbid all wic- 
ked Thing, he reward all good Thing, punifliall 
wicked Thing, he make all Thing, he give all Thing, 
he hear me when I fay O to hirri, asyougodojuft 
now; he makee me good, If 1 wiih be good, hefpare 
me, no makee kill me, when I no be good; all this 
you fay he do ; yes he be great God ; me take, think, 
believe him be great God; me fay O to him too 
with you, my Dear. 

Here the poor Man could forbear no longer ,* but 
railing her up, made her kneel by him, and he pray'd 
to God, aloud, to inilrudl her in the Knowledge of 
himfelf by his Spirit, and that by fome good Provi- 
dence, if polTible, fhe might fometime or other 
come to have a Bible, that (he might read the 
Word of God, and be taught by it to know 
him. 

This was the Time that wefaw him lift her up by 
the Hand, and faw him kneel down by her, as a- 
bove. 

They had feveral other Difcourfes it feems after 
this, too long to fet down here ; and particularly fhe 
made him promife, that fince he confeft his own 
Life had been a wicked abominable Courfe of Pro- 
vacation againfl God, that he would reform it, and 
not make God angry any more, lead he fhould make 
him deady as (lie call'd it, and then fhe fhould be 
left alone, and never be taught to know this God 
better ; and leaft he fhould be miferable, as he 
had told her wicked Men fhould be after Death. 

This was a flrange Account, and very affeding 
to us both, but particularly to the young Clergy-^ 
man; he was indeed wonderfully furpriz a with ir, 

but 



[ 1^0 ] 

but under the greateft Afilidion imaginable, that 
he could not talk to her, that he could notfpeak 
Englijl to make her underhand him \ and as fhe fpokc 
but very broken Engli(Jo, he could not underftand her-; 
However he tuili'd himfelf to me, and told me^, that 
he believed there muft be more to do with this Wo- 
man than to marry her : 1 did not underfland him at 
firft, but at length he explain'd himfelf, Qviz^,)thzx. 
£he ought to be Baptized. 

I agreed with him in that Part readily, and was 
for going about it prefently ; No, no, hold Sir, faid 
he, tho' I would have her be Baptiz'd by all Means, 
yet I muft obferve, that Wiii. Atkins, her Husband, 
has indeed brought her in a wonderful Manner to be 
willing to embrace a religious Life, and has given her 
Juft Ideas of the Being of a God, of his Power, Ju- 
ftice, Mercy; yet I deiire to know of him, if he had 
faid any Thing to her of Jefus Chrift, and of the Sal- 
vation of Sinners, of the Nature of Faith in him, 
and Redemption, by him ; of the holy Spirit, the 
Refuredion, the laft Judgment, and a future 
State. 

I caird Will- Atkins again, and as'd him ; but the 
poor Fellow fell immediately into Tears, and told 
us he had faid fomething to her of all thofe things, 
but that he was himfelf fo wicked a Creature, and 
his own Confcience fo reproach'd him with his hor- 
rid ungodly Life, that he trembled at the Apprehen- 
fionSj that herKnowledge of him, fhould leflen the At- 
tention ftie fhould give to thofe Things, and make her 
rather contemn Religion than receive it : But he was 
afllirM he faid that her Mind was fo difpos'd to re- 
ceive due ImpreiTions of all thofe Things, that if 
I would but difcourfe with her (he would make it 
appear to my Satisfaction, that my Labour would 
not be loft upon her. 

Accord- 



Accordingly I call'd her in, and placing my felf 
as Interpreter between my religious Prielt and the 
Woman, I entreated him to begin with her ^ but 
fare fuch a Sermon was never preach'd by a popifli 
IPrieft in thef^ latter Ages of the World ^ and, as I 
told him^ I thought he had all the Zeal, al) the 
Knowledge, all the Sincerity of a Chriltian, without 
the Error of a Roman Caiholick ^ and that I took 
him to be fuch a Clergy-man, as the Roman Bifhops 
were before the Church of Rome aflTum'd fpiritual 
Sovereignty over the Confciences of Men. 

In a word, he brought the poor Woman to em- 
brace the Knowledge of Chrift, and of Redemption 
by him, not with Wonder and Aftonifhment only, 
as (he did the firft Notions of a God, but with 
Joy and Faith, with an Affeftion and a furprifing 
Degree of Underftanding, fcarce to be imagin'd^ 
much lefs to exprefs'd 5 and at her own Requeft 
fhe was baptized, 

When he was preparing to baptize her, I entreat- 
ed him that he would perform that Office with 
fome Caution, thac the Man might not perceive he 
was of the Rvfmn Church, if poffible, becaufe of 
other ill Confequences which might attend a Dif- 
ference among us in that very Religion, which we 
were inftrufting the other in : He told me, that as 
he had no confecrated Chappel, no proper Things 
for the Office, 1 (hould fee he would do it in a 
Manner that I fhouid not know by it, that he was 
a Roman Catholick my felf^ if I had not known it 
before ; And fo he did •, for faying only fome 
Words over to himfelf in Latin^ which I could not 
underHand, he pour'd a whole Di(h-ful of Water 
upon the Woman's Head, pronouncing in French^ 
very loud, MARY, which was the Na?fie, her Hitf- 
i^and dejir'd me to give her ^ for I was her Godfither^ 
I baptize thee in the Name of the Father, and of 
the Son, and of the Holy Ghoit •, fo that none could 
know any Thing by it, what Religion he was of: 

L He 



C 162 ] 

He gave the Benediftion afterwards in Latin ^ but 1 
either Jnu. Atkins did not know but it was in French^ \ 
or elfe did nor rake Notice of it, at that Time. 

As foon as this was over we married them ^ and 
after the Marriage was over he turned himfelf to 
J^ill. Jtkins^ and in a very AflFeftionate Manner ex- 
horted him, not only to persevere in that good Di- 
fpofition he was in, but to fupport the Convictions 
that were upon hfm by a Refolution to reform bis 1 
Life ^ told him it was in vain to fay he repented, i 
if he did not forfake his Crimes : Reprefented to ; 
him, how God had honoured him with being the 1 
Inftrument of bringing his Wife to the Knowledge | 
of the Chriftian Religion, and that he fhould be 
careful he did not difhonoilr the Grace of God, and 1 
that if he did^ he would fee the Heathen a better | 
Chriftian than himlelf-, the Savage converted, and j 
the Inltrument caft away. 

He faid a great many good Things to them both, i 
and then recomending them in a few Words to | 
God's goodnefs, gave them the Benediction again, I | 
repeating every Thing to them in EngUfJ),^ and 1 
thus ended the Ceremony ; I think it was the moft 1 
pleafant agreeable Day to me that ever I pafTed in ■ 
tny whole Life. 

But my Clergy-man had not done yet ^ his , 
Thoughts hong continually tipon the Converfion of - 
the feven and thirty Savages, and fain he would have 
ftay'd upon the Ifland to have undertaken it ^ but I , 
convinced him, firlt, that his Undertaking was im- , 
prafticable in it felf; and fecondly, that perhaps I 
would put it into a Way of being done in this Ab- . 
fence to hisSatlsfaftion ^ of which^ by and by. 

Having thus brought the Affair of the Ifland to , 
a narrow Compafs, I was preparing to go on board . 
the Ship, when the ycimg Man who I had taken out j 
of the famifli'd Ship's Company came to me, and , 
told me, he underftood I had a Clergy-man with , 
me, and that I had caufed the En^UJJj Men to be j 

married 



married to the Savages, whom they calle'' Wives - 
thar he had a Match too, which he defired might be 
finifli'd before I went, between two Chriltians, which 
he hop'd would not be difagreeable to me. 

I knew this muft be the young Woman who was 
his Mother's Servant, for there was no other Chri- 
ftian Woman on the Ifland ^ fo 1 began to perfuade 
him not to do any Thing of that Kind rafhiy, or 
becaufe he found himfelf in this folatary Circum- 
ftance: I reprefented to him that he had fome con- 
liderable Subrtance in the World and good Friends 
as I underftood by himfelf, and by his Maid alfo 5 
that the Maid was not only poor, and a Servant, 
but was unequal to him, fhe being fix or feven and 
twenty years Old, and he not above feventeen or 
eighteen •, that he might very probablj^ with my 
iHiiiftance, make a remove from this Wilderneis and 
come into his own Country again, and that then it 
would be a thoufand to one but he would repent 
his Choice • and the Diflike of that Gircumftance 
might be difadvantageous to both. I was going to 
fiy more but he interrupted me, fmiling, and told 
me, with a great deal of Modefty, that 1 miftook m 
my Guefles, that he had nothing of that Kind in 
his Thoughts, his preferit CircumOance being me- 
lancholly and difconfolate enough 5 and he was very- 
glad to hear that I had Thoughts of putting them 
in a Way to fee their Country again, and nothing 
fliould have put him upon ftaying there, but that 
I the Voyage I was going was fo exceeding long and 
I nazardous, and would carry him quire out of th$ 
I Reach of all his Friends-, that he had nothing to 
defireof me, but that I would fertle him in Icme 
j little Properry in the Ifland where he was, give hinn 
'3 Servant or rwo and fome few NecefTifies, and he 
[^onld fettle himfelf here like a Pjinter, ^airing 
5 the good Time, when if ever I returnM to Ev.glaitd^ 
li I would redeem him, and hopM I woudd not be un- 
[jniindful of iiim when I came into Evgia7id'^ that he 
" L 2 would 



[ i(?4 ] 

would give me fotne Letters to his Friends in Lon^ 
don^ to let them know how good I had been to him, 
and in what Part of the World, and what Circum- 
ftance I had left him in ^ that he promifed me, that 
when ever I redeemed him, the Plantation and all the 
Improvements he had made upon it, let the Value 
be what it would, fhould be wholly mine. 

His Difcourfe was very prettily delivered, confi. 
dering his Youth, and was the more agreeable to me, 
becaufe he told me pofitively the Match was not 
ior himfelf : I gave him all poflible Affurances that 
if 1 liv'd to come fafe to England^ I would deliver 
his Letters and do his Bufinels effeftually, and that 
he might depend I would never forget the Circum- 
ftance I had left him in ^ but ftiH I was impatient 
to know who was the Perlbn to be married, upon 
which he told me it was my Jack of all Trades^ and 
his Maid Svfajt. 

I was moft agreeably furpriz'd, when he nam'd 
the Match, for indeed I thought it very fui table ^ 
the Charader of that Man I have given already , and 
as for the Maid, ftje was a very honeft, modeft, fo- 
ber and religious young Woman, had a very good 
Shaie of Senfe, was agreeable enough in her Perfon, 
fpoke very handforaely and to the Purpofe, always 
with Decency and good Manners, and not backward 
to fpeak when any Thing required it, or imperti- 
nently forward to fpeak when it was not her Bufi- 
nels •, very handy and houfewifely in any Thing that 
was before her ^ an excellent Manager, and fit in- 
deed to have been Governefs to the whole Ifland ; 
(he knew very well how to behave to all kind of 
Folks fhe had about her, and to better, if (he had 
found any there. 

The Match being propofed in this Manner, we 
married them the fame Day, and as I was Father at 
the Altar, as I may fay, and gave her away, ^o \ 
gave her a Portion 5 for i appointed ber and her 
Husband a handfom large Space of Grouud for 

t their 



[ i<^S ] 

their Plantation ^ and indeed this Match and the 
Propofal the young Gentleman made to me to give 
Mm a fmali a Property in the Ifland, put me upon par- 
celling it out amongft them, that they might not 
quarrel afterwards about their Situation. 

This fharing out the Land to them, 1 left to WiU. 
Atkins^ who indeed was now grown a moft fober, 
grave, managing Fellow •, perfeftly reform'd, ex- 
ceeding Pious and Religious, and as far as I tnay be 
allow'd to fpeak policively in fuch a Cafe, I verily 
believe, was a true fincere Penitent. 

He divided Things fo jultly , and fo much to eve- 
ry one's Satisfaflion, that they only defired one ge- 
neral Writing under my Hand for the whole, which 
I caufed to be drawn up and fign'd and feal'd to 
them, fetting out the Bounds and Situation of every 
Man's Plantation, and teftifying that I gave them, 
thereby feveraily a Right to the whole Poffeifion 
and inheritance of the refpeQive Plantations or 
Farms, with their Improvements to them and their 
Heirs, refervlng all the reft of the Ifland as my own 
Property, and a certain Rent for every particular 
Plantation after eleven Years, if I, or any one from 
me, or in my Name, came to demand it, produc 
ing an attefted Copy of the fame Writing. 

As to the Government and Laws among them, I 
told them 1 was not capable of giving them better 
Rules, than they were able to give themfelves ; 
only made them promife me to live in Love and. 
good Neighbourhood with one another •, and fo I 
prepared to leave them. 

One Thing I mult not omit, and this is, that 
being now fettled in a Kind of Common- Wealth 
among themfelves, and having much Buiinefs in 
Hand, it was but odd to have ^qvqxi and thirty In- 
dians live in a Nook of the Ifland, independent, 
and indeed un- employed 5 for excepting the pro- 
viding themfelves Food, which they had Difficulty 
enough in toOj fometimes, they had no manner 
L 3 of 



[ \66 ] 

of Bufinefs or Property to manage : I proposed 
therefore to the Govemour Spamard^ that he (hould 
go to them with Fridafs Father, and propofe to 
them to remove, and either plant for rhemfelves, or 
take them into their feveral Families as Servants to 
be maintained for their Labour, but without being 
abfolute Slaves, for I would not admit them to 
make them Slai^es by Force by any Means, becaufe 
they had their Liberty given them by Capitulation, 
and as it were Articles of Surrender which they 
ought not to breik. 

They moft willingly embrac'd the Propofal, and 
came all very cheatfuily along with him ^ fo we 
allotted them Land, and Plantations, which 
three or four accepted of, but ail the reft chofe 
to be emplcy'd as Servants in the feveral Families 
we had fettled ^ and thus my Colony was in a 
Manner fettled, as follows ;, The Spaniards pof- 
fefs'd my original Habitation, which was the Capi- 
tal City, and extended their Plantations all along 
the fide of the Brook, which made the Creek that 
I have fo often defer ib'd, as far as my Bower ^ and 
as they increas'd their Culture, it went always Eaft- 
ward 5 the EngltJI} liv'd in the North- Eaft Part, 
where 7 fill. Atldm^ and his Comrades began, and 
came on Southward, and South- Weft, towards the 
back Fart of the Spaniards^ and every Plantation 
had a great Addition of Land to take in, if they 
found Occafion, fo that they need not joftle one 
another for want of Room. 

All the Weft End of the Ifland was left uninha- 
bited, that if any of the Savages fhould come on 
Shore there, only for their ufual cuftomary Barba- 
rities, they might come and go , if they difturbno 
Body, no Body would difturb them ^ and no doubt 
but they were often afliore, and went away again ^ 
for I never heard that the Planters were ever at- 
tack'd or difiurb'd any more. 

It 



It now came into my Thoughts, that I had liint- 
ed to my Friend the Clergy-man, that the Work ot 
converting the Savages, might perhaps be fct on 
foot in his Abfence, to his Satistaftion ; and I told 
him that now I thought it was put in a fair Way ; 
lor the Savages being thus divided among the Chri- 
ftians, if they would but every one of them do 
their part with thole which came under their Hands, 
I hop'd it might have a very good EfFeft. 

He agreed prefendy in rhir, if, faid he^ they will 
do their Part ^ but \\(m\ fays he^ (hall we obtain 
that of them > I told him, we would call them all 
together, and leave ir in Charge with them, or go 
to them one by one, which he thought belt, fo we 
divided it ^ he to fpeak ro the Spa7iiards^ who were 
all Papilts, and I to the EvgUf?^ who were all Pro- 
teltants^ and we recommended it earneftly to them, 
and made them Promife, that they never would 
niake any Diftinftion , of Papift or Proteftantj in 
their exhorting the Savages to turn Chriftians •, hut 
teach them the general Knowledge of the true God, 
and of their Saviour Jefiis Chrilt *, and they like- 
wife promised us, that they would never have any 
Differences or Difpuies one with another^ about 
Religion. 

When I came to ^. AtJdns's Houfe^ I may call it 
fo, for fuch a Houfe or fuch a Piece of Basket- 
Work, I believe, was not {landing in the World a~ 
gain i I fay, when I came there, 1 tbund the young 
Woman i have mentioned abo\;e, and W, Atldns's 
Wife^ were become Intimates •, and, this prudent re- 
ligious young Woman, had perfected the Work W, 
Jtkbis had begun 5 and tho' it v^as not above four 
Days after what I have related, yet the nc^^ bap- 
tized Savage Woman was made fuch a Chriftian, as, 
1 have feldom heard of any like her in sjl my Ob- 
fervation, or Converfation, in the World. 

It came next into my Mind in the Morning be- 
fore I went to them, that arnongft all the needful 
' L 4 Things., 



[ 1^8 1 

Things I had to leave with them I had not left them 
a Bible; in which, 1 fhew'd myfelf lefs confidering 
for them, than my good Friend the Widdow was 
for me, when (he fent me the Cargo of an hundred 
Pounds from Lhbon^ where (he pack'd up g Bibles, 
and a Prayer-Book: Howerer, the good Woman's 
Charity had a greater Extent than ever fhe ima- 
gined 5 for they were referv'd for the Comfort and 
Inftruftion of thofe, that made much better life of 
them than I had done. 

I took one of the Bibles in my Poker, and when 
I came to IfiU, Atkins's Tent or Moufe, and found 
the voung Woman, and Athns's baptized Wife, had 
been difcourfing of Religion together ^ for WiU. At- 
hns told it me, with a great deal of Joy : I ask'd if 
they were together now, and he faid. Yes ^ fo I 
went into the Houle, and he, with me, and we 
found them together very earneft in Difcourfe ^ O 
Sir, fays Tfill. Atlins^ when God has Sinners to re- 
concile to himfelf, and Aliens to bring Home, He 
never wants a MeflTenger ^ my Wife has got a new 
Infiru&or •, I knew I was unworthy, as I was unca- 
pable of that Work ^ that young Woman has been 
fent hither from Heaven ^ flie is enough to convert a 
whole Ifland of Savages^ the young Woman blufh'd, 
and role up to go away, bur I defir'd her to fit Itil) ^ 
I told her, (he had a good Work upon her Hands, 
and 1 hop'd God would blefs her in it. 

We talk'd a little, and I did not perceive they 
had any Book among them, though I did not ask ^ 
but I put my Hand in my Pocket, and pull'd out 
my Bible ^ here, fays J, to Atkins^ I have brought 
you an AlTiftant that perhaps you had not before 5 
the Man was fo confounded, that he was not able to 
Ipeak for fome Time ^ but recovering himfelf, he 
takes it with both his Hands, and turning to his 
Wife, here, 7ny Dear^ fays he ^ did not I tell you, 
our God, tho' He lives above, could hear what we 
faid ? Here's the Book I pray'd for^ when you and I 

kneerd 



[ 169 1 

kneelM down under the Bulli ^ now God lias heard 
us, and fent it ^ when he had laid fb, the Man fell 
into fuch Tranfports of a paffionaie Joy, that be- 
tween the Joy of having it and giving God Thanl^s 
for it, the Tears run down his Face like a Child 
that was crying. 

The Woman was fjrprifed, and was like to have 
run into a Miftake, thar none of us were aware of^ 
for [he firmly believM God had fcnu the Book upon 
her Husband's Petition j It is tree, that pravidenti- 
ally it was fo, and might be taken fo in a confe- 
quent Senfe-, but I believ'd it would have been no 
difficult Matter at that Time to have perfiiaded the 
poor Woman to have believ'd, that an expreis Mef- 
fenger came from Heaven, on purpofe to bring that 
individual Book ^ but it was to ferious a Matter, to 
fufFer any Delufion to take Place •, -fo 1 lurn'd to 
the young Woman and told her we did not defiie to 
impofe upon the new Convert, in her firit, and 
more ignorant underftanding of Things -, and 
begg'd her to explain to her, that God may be ve- 
ry properly faid to aniwer our Petitions, when itj 
the Courfe of his Providence, fuch Thiiigs are ia 
a particular Manner broiight to pafs, as we petiii- 
on'd for ^ but we do not expeft rerurns from Hea- 
ven, in a miraculous and particular Manner, and 
that it is our Mercy, that it is not fo. 

This the young Woman did afterwards efFeftual^ 
ly 5 fo that there was I affure you, no Prieft-craft 
uled here 5 and I fhould have thought it one of the 
molt unjuftifiable Frauds in the World, to have 
had it fo 5 bur the Surprife of Joy upon JfiU. Au 
lim^ is really not to be exprefled -^ and there we 
may be fure, there was no Del u (ion : Sure, no Man 
was ever more thankful in the World for any Thing 
of its Kind, than he was for this Bible ^ nor I 
believe, never any Man was glad of a Bible from a 
better Principle ^ and though he had been a moft 
profligate Creature, defperate, headfirong, cutra- 

gious, 



[ 17® 1 

gious, furious, and wicked to a great Degree ^ yet 
this Man is a ftanding Rule to us al], for the well 
vinftrufting Children, (viz.) that Parents fhould ne- 
ver give over to teach and inliruQ, or ever difpair 
of the Succefs of their Endeavours, let the Chil- 
dren be ever fo obftinate, refraSory, or to Appear- 
ance, infenfible of Initru£lion •, for if ever God in 
his Providence, touches the Confciences of fuch, 
the Force of their Education returns upori them, 
and the early Inltruftion of Parents is not loft ^ 
though it nnay have been many Years laid afleep ^ 
but fome Tiiue or other, they may find the Benefit 
of it. 

Thus it was with this poor Man ^ However igno- 
rant he was, or divelted of Religion and Chriftian 
Knowledge: He found he had fome to do with 
now, more ignorant than himftlf^ and that the 
leaft Part of the Inftruftion of his good Father 
that could now come to his Mind, was of life to 
him, 

^ Among the reft it occcrr'd to him, he faid, how 
his Father us'd to infitt much upon the ine:<prefiible 
Value of the Bible ^ the Privilege and Bleding of 
it to Nations, Families, and Perfons ; but he never 
entertained the leaft Norion of the Worth of it, 
"till now 5 when being to talk to Heathens, Savages, 
and Barbarians, he wanted the Help of the writiea 
Oracle for his Affiftance. 

The young Woman was very glad of it alfo for 
the prefent Occafion, tho' (lie had one, and fo had 
the Youth on board our Ship among their Goods, 
which were not yet brought on Shore ^ and now ha- 
ving faid fo many Things of this young Woman, I 
cannot omit of telling one Story more of her, and 
my felf, which has lomething in it very informing 
and remarkable. 

I have related, to what Extremity the poor young 
Woman was reduced; how her Miftrefs was Itarv'd 
to Death, and did die on board that unhappy Ship 

we 



[ 171 ] 

we met at Sea ^ and how the whole Ship's Company 
being rednc'd ro the lait Extremity -, the Genrlewo- 
man, and her Son, and this Maid, were firft hardly 
ufed as to Provifions ^ and at iail totally neglefted 
and ftarvM ^ that is to fay, brought to the laft Ex- 
tremity of Hunger. 

One Day being Difcourfing with her upon the 
Extremities they fuffer'd, I ask'd her it (he could 
defcribe by what (he had lelr, what it was to 
flrarve, and how it appear'd •, fhe told me, (he 
bellev'd fhe cculd j and fhe told her Tale very du 
ftinftly thus, 

" Firfl-, Sir, faid fhe, we had for fome Days far'd 
exceeding hard, and loiFerM very great Hunger ^ 
but now at laft, we were wholly without Food 
of any Kind, except Sugar, and a little Wine, 
and a little Water. The firlr Day, after 1 had 
receiv'd no Food at all, I found my felf towards 
Evening, firft empty and fickifh at my Svomach> 
and nearer Night mightily enclin'd to yawning 
and fleepy t, I laid down on a Couch in the great 
Cabin to fleep, and flept about ihree Hours, and 
awak'd a little refrefhM ^ having taken a Glais 
of Wine when I lay down ^ after being about 
three Hours awake, it being about five a-Clock 
in the Morning, 1 found myfelf empty and mf 
Stomach fickifh, and lay'd down again, but could 
not fleep at all, being very faint, and ill ^ and 
thus i continued all the fecond Day, with a 
flrange Variety, fitft Hungry, then fick again, with 
Teachings to vomit ^ the fecond Night being 
oblig'd to go to Bed again, vyithout any Food, 
more than a Draught of fair Water ^ and being 
afleep, 1 drearn'd I was at Barbadnes.dDd rhar the 
Market was mightily ftork'd wirh Provifions ^ 
that I brought fome for my Milirels, and went 
and din'd very heartily. 

'^ I thought my Stomach was as fill after this as 
any would have been after, or at good Dinner ^ 

'' but 



tc 



[ 172 ] 

" but when I awak'd, I was exceedingly funk in 
** my Spirits, to find mylelf in the extremity of 
** Famine : The laft Glafs of Wine we had, I 
" drank, and put Sugar in it, becaufe, cf its ha- 
'' ving feme Spirit to fupply Nourifhment; but 
" there being no Subftance in the Stomach for the 
" digefting Oflice to work upon, I found the only 
^' effe£l of the Wine wa«;, to raife difagreeable 
**^ Fumes from the Stomach, into the Head 5 and I 
" lay, as they told me, ftupid, and fenfelefs, as 
" one Drunk for fome Time. 

" The third Day in the Morning, after a Nights 
" of ftrange and confus'd inconfiftent Dreams-, and 
" rather dozing than fleeping, I wak'd, ravenous 
" and furious, with Hunger ^ and I queftion, had 
" not my Qnderltanding returned and conquer'd it > 
" I fay, I queftion whether if I had been a Mother, 
" and had had a little Child with me, its Life would 
" have been fafe or not > 

" This lafted about three Hours ^ during which 
*' Time I was twice raging Mad as any Creature in 
*' Bedlam^ as my young Mafter told me, and as he 
^^ can now inform you. 

" In one of thefe fits of Lunaey or Diftra8:ion, 
" whether by the Motion of the Ship, or fome Slip 
^' of my Foot, I know not ^ I fell down, and ftruck 
^' my Face againft the Corner of a Palat Bed in 
^' which my Miftrefs by^ ani with the Blow the 
*' Blood gufh'd out of my Nolfe^ and the Cabin 
*' Boy bringing me a little Bifon, i fat down and 
'' bled into it a great deal ^ and as the Blood run 
" from me, I came to my felf ^ and the Violence of 
" the Flame or the Fever, I was in, abated, and fo 
" did the rjvenous Pare of the Hunger. 

'' Then I grew fick, and reached to Vomit, but 
" could not^ for I had nothing in my Stomach to 
" bring up : After I had bled fume Time, I fwoon'd, 
" and they all believ'd I was dead ^ but I came to 
'* myfelf foon after, and then had a moli dreadful 

" Pain 



[ 173 1 

" Pain in my Stomach, not to be defcribed 5 not 
" like the Cholick, but a gnawing eager Pain fot 
" Food^ and towards Night it went ofF with a 
" kind of earneft Wiflling or Longing for Food 5 
« fomething like, as 1 fuppofe, the Longing of a 
" Woman with Child. I took another Draught of 
*' Water with Sugar in it, but my Stomach loath- 
" ed the Sugar, and brought it all up again ^ then 
" I took 3 Draught of Water without Sugar, and 
" that ftay'd with me-, and I laid me down upon 
" the Bed, praying moft heartily, that it would 
" pleafe God to take me away ; and compofing 
" my Mind in Hopes of it, I flumber'd a while, 
*' and then waking, thought myfelf dying, being 
" light with Vapours from an empty Stomach, I re-- 
" commended mj Soul then to God, and earneSly 
" wifh'd that fome Body would throw me into 
" the Sea. 

" Ail this while my Miftrefs lay by me, juft, as I 
'' thought expiring, but bore it with much more 
" Patience than I, and gave the laft bit of Bread 
" Oie had left to her Child, my young Mafter, 
" who would nor have taken it, but fhe oblig'd him 
" to eat it 5 and I believe it fav'd his Life. 

" Towards the Morning i flept again, andfirft. 
" when I awak'd, I fell into a violent Paffion of 
" Crying, and after that had a fecond Fit of vio- 
" lent Hunger ^ 1 got up ravenous, and in a moft 
" dreadful Condition •, had my Miftrefs been dead, 
" as much as I lov'd her, I am certain, I (hould 
" have eaten a Piece of her Flefti, with as much

^' Flefh of any Creature appointed for Food ^ and 
" once or tv^ice I was going to hire my own Arm t 
*' At laCt, 1 favv the Bafon in which was the Blood 
" I had bled at my Noife rhe Day before ^ i ran to 
^^ it, and fwallow'd it with fuch Haik, and fuch a 
^' greedy Appetite, 2s if I had v?onder'd no Body 
'' had taken ir before, and afraid it fhould be taken 
*' from nie now. " Tho' 



[ 174 J 

*' Tho' after it was down, the Thoughts of it 
" fiU'd me with Horror, yet it check'd the Fit of 
*^ Hunger, and [ drank a Draught of fair Water, 
" and was composed and refrefh'd for fome Hours 
*^ after it : This was the 4th Day, and thus I held 
" it, 'till towards Night, when within the Com- 
'^ pais of three Hours, I had all thefe feveral Cir- 
'' cumltances over again, one after another, (vizj 
** fick, ileepy, eagerly hungry. Pain in the Sto* 
" mach, then ravenous again, then fick again, then 
" lanatfck, then crying, then ravenous again ^ and 
*^ fo every quarter of an Hour, and my Strength 
" vvafted exceedingly : At Night I laid me down, 
*' having no Comfort, but in the Hope that I (hould 
*' die before Morning. 

'^ AW this Night I had no Sleep ^ but the Hun- 
'' ger was now lurn'd into aDifeafe; and I had a 
" terrible Cholick and Griping, Wind inliead of 
'^ Food, having fciind its Way into the Bowels ; and 
'' in this Condition I lay 'till Morning, when I was 
*' iurpriz'd a little with the Cries and Lamentations 
*' of my young Mafter, who call'd out to me that 
*^ his Mother was dead : I lifted my felf up a Ht- 
'^ tie 5 for I had not Strength to rife, but found fhe 
" was not dead, tho' fhe was able to give very 
" little Signs of Life. 

" I had then fuch Convulfions in my Stomach, 
" for want of fome fuftenance, that I cannot de- 
** fcribe ; with fuch freequent Throws and Pangs 
" of Appetite, that nothing but the Tortures of 
^^ Death can imitate ^ and in this Condition I was 
*' when I heard the Seamen aboVe cry out a Sail^ d 
" Sail^ and hallow and jump about, as; if they 
" were diftrafted 

" I was not able to get off from the Bed, and 
''- my Miftrefs much lefs •, and my young Mafter 
*' was fo fick, that I thought he had been expiring ; 
*' fo we could not open the Cabin-Door, or get 
" any Account what it was that occafion'd fuch a

[ 175 ] 

*' Combuflion, nor had we had any Converfation 
*' with the Ship's Company for two Days ; they 
*' having told us they had not a Mouthful of any 
*' Thing to eat in the Ship •, and they told us after- 
*' wards, they thought we had been dead. 

" It was this dreadful Condition we were in when 
" you were fent to fave our Lives •, and how you 
*' found us. Sir, you know as well as I, and bet- 
" ter too. 

This was her own Relation, and isfuch a diftinft 
Account of ffarving to Death, as ! confefs I never 
met with^ and was exceeding entertaining to me 5 
I am the rather apt to believe it to be a true Ac- 
count, becaufe the Youth gave me an Account of a 
good Part of it *, tho' I muft own, not fo diftinft 
and fo feelingly as his Maid ^ and the rather, be- 
caufe it feems his Mother fed him at the Price of 
her own Life *. But the poor Maid, tho' her Confti- 
tutlon being ftronger than that of her Miftrefs, who 
was in Years, and a weakly Woman too, flie might 
ftruggle harder with it-, 1 fay, the poor Maid 
might be fuppofed to feel the Extremity fometbing 
fooner than her Miftrefs, who might be allowed to 
keep the laft Bit fomething longer than (he parted 
with any to relieve the Maid, Tslo Queftion, as the 
Cafe is here related, if our Ship or Ibme other, 
had not fo providentially met them, a few Days 
more would have ended all their Lives, unlefs they 
had prevented it by eating one another^ and even, 
that as their Cafe flood, would have ferv'd them 
but a little while, they being 500 Leagues from any 
Land ; or any Poffibility of Relief^ other than in 
the miraculous Manner it happened : But this is by 
the Way ^ I return to my Difpofition of Things 
among the People, 

And, Fhfr^ Ir is to be obferv'd here, Thar for 
many Reafons I did not think fit to let them know 
any Thiog of the Sloop \ had fram'd, and which I 
tLdught of fetting up among them j ki I found, 

at 



[ I70 

at hqfl at my firjf comlvg^ fuch Seeds of Divifions' 
among them, that I faw it plainly had I fet up the 
Sloop, and left it among them, they would upon 
every light Difguft have feperated, and gone away 
from one another, or perhaps have turn'd Pirates, and 
fo made theliland a Den of Thieves,inftead of a Plan- 
tation of fober and religious People, fo as I intended 
it^ nor did 1 leave the two Pieces of BrafsCannon that 
I had on Board, or the two Qjiarter-Deck Guns, 
that my Nephew took extraordinarily for the fame 
Reafon : 1 thought they had enough to qualify 
them for a defenfive War againft any that fhould in- 
vade them i but I was not to fet them up for an of- 
fenfive War, or to encourage them to go Abroad to 
attack others, which in the End would only bring 
Ruin and Dettruftion upon themfelves and all their 
Undertaking : I referv'd the Sloop therefore, and 
the Guns, for their Service another Way, as I fhall 
obferve in its Place. 

I have now done with the Ifland : I left them all 
in good Circumftances, and in a flourifliing Conditi- 
on, and went on board my Ship again the 
of , having been five and twenty Days 

among them -, and as they were all refolv'd to (fay 
upon the Ifland 'till I came to remove them, I pro- 
mised to fend fome further Relief from the Brafils^ 
if I could poiTibly find an Opportunity ^ and parti- 
cularly 1 promised to fend them fome Cattel, fuch 
as Sheep, Hogs, and Cows : For as to the two 
Cows and Calves which I brought from Englani^ 
we had been oblig'd by the Length of our Voyage 
to kill them at Sea, for want of Hay to feed them. 

The next Day, giving them a Salute of five Guns 
at parting, we let Sail, and arriv'd at the Bay of 
AU-Saifits in the Brajils in about 22 Days ^ meeting 
nothing remarkable in our PafTage, but this. That 
about three Days after we faifd, being becalm'd, and 
the Current letting ffrong to the E. N. E. running, as 
it were, into a Bay or Gulph on the Land Side, we 

were 



[ 177 ] 

were driven fomething out of our Courfe, and once 
or twice our Men cry'd Land to the Eaftward ^ but 
whether it was the Continent or Iflands, we could 
nor tell by any Means. 

But the third Day towards Evening, the Sea 
fmooth, and the Weather calm, we faw the Sea, as 
it were, cover'd towards the Land with fomething 
very biack, not being able to difcover what it was, 
'tin after fome Time, our chief Mate going up the 
main Shrowds a little Way, and looking at them 
with a Perfpeftive, cry'd out it was an Army, I could 
not imagine what he meant by an Army, and fpoke 
a little haftily, calling the Fellow a Fool, or fome 
fuch Word : Nay, Sir, fays he^ don't be angry, for 
'tis an Army and a Fleet too ; for I believe there 
are a thoufand Canoes, and you may fee them pad- 
dle along, and they are coming towards us too^ 
apace. 

1 was a little furpriz'd then indeed, and fo was 
tny Nephew, the Captain ^ for he had heard fuch 
terrible Stories of them in the Ifland, and having 
never hQQu in thofe Seas before, that he could not 
tell what to think of it, but faid two or three Times, 
we fhould all be devour'd. I niuft confefs confider- 
ing we were becaim'd, and the Current fet ftrong 
towards the Shore, I lik'd it the worfe : However, 
i bad him not be afraid, but bring the Ship to an 
Anchor, as foon as vve came fo near as to know 
that we mult engage them. 

The Weather continued calm, and they came on 
apace towards us 5 fo I gave Order to come to an 
Anchor, and furle all our Sails : As for the Savages, 
I told them they had nothing to fear but to Fire^ 
and therefore tbey fhould get their Boats out, and 
fatten them, one clofe by the Head, and the other 
by the Stern, and man them both well, and wait 
the iffue in that Pofture: This I did, that the Men 
in the Boats might be ready with Skeets and Buckets 

M to 



L 178 1 

to put out any Fire, thefe Savages might endeavour 
to fix to the Out- fide of the Ship. 

In this Pofture we lay by for them, and in a little 
while they came up with us ^^ but never was fuch a 
horrid Sight feen by Chriftians : My Mate was 
much miftaken in his Calculation of their Number^ 
I mean of a thoufand Canoes 5 the moft we could 
make of them when they came up, being about a 
hundred and fix and twenty and a great many of 
them too ^ for fome of them had fixteen or feven- 
teen Men in them, fome more ^ and the leaft fix 

orfeven. ,. r .j t. 

When they came nearer to us they feem d to be 
ftruck with Wonder and Aftonilhment, as at a Sight 
which they had doubtlefs never feen before •, nor 
could they at firft, as we afterwards underftood, know 
what to make of us : They came boldly up however 
very near to us, and feem'd to go about, to row 
round us 5 but we call'd to our Men in the Boats^ 
not to let them come too near them. 

This very Order brought us to an Engagement 
with them, without our defignlng it ; for hvQ or 
fix of their large Canoes came fo near our Long-Boat, 
that our Men beckon'd with their Hands to them to 
keep back, which they underftood very well, and 
went back •, but at their Retreat, about 50 Arrows 
came on board us from thofe Boats *, and one of our 
Men in the Long-Boat was very much wounded. 

However, I call'd to them not to fire by any 
Means ^ but we handed down fome Deal- Board sin- 
to the Boat, and the Carpenter prefently fet up a 
kind of a Fence like wafte Boards, to cover them 
from the Arrows of the Savages, if they (hould 
flioot again. 

About half an Hour afterwards they came all up 
in a Body a-ffern of us, and pretty near, fo near 
that we could eafily difcern what they were, tho' we 
could not tell their Defign : 1 eafily found they were 
fome of my old Friends, the fame Sort of Savages 
^ J that 



[ ^19 ] 

that I had been ufed to engage with ^ and in a little 
Time more they row'd a little farther out to Sea, 
'till they came dire£lly Broad-fide with us, and then 
row'd down ftrait upon us, 'till they came fo near 
that they could hear us fpeak : Upon this 1 ordered 
all my Men to keep clofe, leaft they (hould (hoot 
any more Arrows, and made all our Guns ready ; 
but being fo near as to be within hearing, I made 
Tnia'j go out upon the Deck, and call out aloud to 
them in his Language to know what they meant^ 
which accordingly he did 5 whether they underftood 
him or not, that I knew not: But as foon as he had 
calFd to them, fix of them who were in the fore- 
moft or nigheft Boat to us, turns their Canoes from 
us J and {looping down, fliew'd us their naked Back- 
fides, juft as if in EngllJIj^ faving your prefence, they 
had hid iis kifs — - ♦, whether this was a Defiance or 
Challenge, we know not 5 or whether it was done 
in meer Contempt, or as a Signal to the reft -, but 
immediately Friday^ cry'd out they were going to 
fiioot, and unhappily for him poor Fellow 5 they 
let fly about 300 of their Arrows, and, to my inex- 
preffible Grief, kill'd poor Friday^ no other Man be- 
ing in their Sight. The poor Fellow was fhot with 
no lefs than three Arrows, and about three more 
fell very near him ^ fuch unlucky Markfmen they 
were. 

I was fo enrag'd with the lofs of my old Servant, 
the Companion of all my Sorrows and Solitudes, 
that I immediately order'd five Guns to be loaded 
with fmall Shot, and four with great, and gave 
them fuch a Broad-fide, as they had hever heard in 
their Lives before, to be fure. 

They were not above half a Cable Length oflF 
when we fir'd and our Gunners took their aim fo well, 
that three or four of their Canoes were overfet, as 
we had reafon to believe, by one Shot only. 

The ill manners of turning up their bare Back- 
fides to us, gave us no great OfFence 1 neither did I 
M 2 know 



[ i8o ] 

know for certain, whether that which would pafs 
for the greateft Contempt annong us, might be un* 
derftood fo by them, or not ^ therefore in Return, 
I had only relolv'd to have fir'd four or five Guns at 
them with Powder only, which I knew would fright 
them fufficiently : But when they (hot at us dire^ly 
with all the Fury they were capable of, and efpeci- 
ally as they had kill'd my poor Friday^ who I fo en- 
tirely lov'd and valu'd, and who indeed fo well de- 
ferv'd it ^ I not only had been juftify'd before God 
and Man, but would have been very glad, if! could, 
to have overfet every Canoe there, and drown'd eve- 
ry one of them. 

I can neither tell, how many we kill'd, or how 
many we wounded at this Broad-fide ^ but fure fuch 
a Fright and Hurry never was feen among luch a 
Multitude 5 there were 13 or 14 of their Canoes 
Iplit and overfet in all, and the Men all fet a fwim- 
ming 5 the reft frighted out of their Wits fcour'd 
away as faft as they could, taking but little care to 
fave thofc whofe Boats were fplit or fpoil'd with 
our Shot: So I fuppofe, that they were many of 
them loft : And our Men took up one poor Fellow 
fwimming for his Life, above an Hour after they 
were all gone. 

Our fmall Shot from our Cannon muft needs kill 
and wound a great many 5 bur, in fhorr, we never 
knew any Thing how it went with them ^ for they 
fled fo faft, that in three Hours or thereabouts, we 
could not fee above three or four Itraggling Canoes ; 
nor did we ever lee the reft any more 5 for a Breeze 
of Wind iprlnging up the fame Evening, we 
weighed and let Sail for the Brajils, 

We had a Prifoner indeed •, but the Creature was 
fo fullen, that he would neither eat or fpeak •, and 
we all fanfied he would ftatve himfelf to Death: 
But I took a Way to cure him *, for I made them 
take him and turn him into the Long-Boat, and 
make him believe they would tofs him into the Sea 

i again, 



C i8i ] 

again, and fo leave him where they found him, if 
he would not fpeak: Nor would that do 5 but they 
really did throw him into the Sea, and came away 
from him j and then he folio w'd them 5 for he 
fwam like a Cork, and callM to them in his Tongue, 
tho' ihey knew not one Word of what he faid : How- 
ever, at laft they took him in again, and then he be- 
gan to be more tradable *, nor did I everdefign they 
fliould drown him. 

We were now under Sail again *, but I was the 
molt difconfolate Creature alive, for want of my 
Man Friday^ and would have been very glad to have 
gone back to the Iflaod, to have taken one of the 
reft from thence for my Occalion, but it could not 
be ^ fo we went on. We had one Prifoner, as I have 
faid 5 and 'twas a long while before we could make 
him underftand any thing : But, in time, our Men 
taught him fome EjigUJI) , and he began to be a lit- 
tle tra&able •, afterwards we enquir'd what Country 
he came from, but could make nothing of what he 
faid •, for his Speech was fo odd, all Gutturals, and 
fpoke in the Throat, in fuch an hollow odd manner, 
that we could never form a Word from him 5 and 
we were all of opinion that they might fpeak that 
Language as well, if they were gagg'd, as other- 
wife : Nor could we perceive that tfeey had any 
Occafion, either for Teeth, Tongue, Lips, or Palate | 
but form'd their Words juft as a hunting Horn forms 
a Tune with an open Tbroat ^ he told us however, 
feme time after, when we had taught him to fpeak a 
little Ergli/h^ that they were goiag with their Kings 
to fight a great Battle. When he faid Kings, we 
as'd him how many Kings? He faid, they were 
FIVE NATION, we could not make film un- 
derftand the Flnrial S. 2nd ttist they all jom'd to go 
againit Two Nation. We ask'd him what made 
them con^e up to us ? He faid, to mahee te great If oil- 
ier look : Where it is to be obferved, That all thole 
Natives, as alfo thofe of Jfrka^ when they learn 
M 3 Effgltfi^ 



[ l82 ] 



1 



EngliJIj^ they always add two Es at the End of the 
Words where we ufe one, and make the Accent up- 
on them, as maUe takee^ and the like 5 and we could 
not break them of it ^ nay, I could hardly make Fri 
day leave it ofF, tho' at laft he did. 

And now I name the poor Fellow once more, ] 
muft take my laft Leave of him •, poor honeft Fri 
day I We buried him with all the Decency and So 
lemnity poflible, by putting him into a Coffin, an; 
throwing him into the Sea : And I Cius'd 'em to fin 
eleven Guns for him ^ and fo ended the Life of th 
moft grateful, faithful, honeft, and moft affe£lionat 
Servant that ever Man had. 

We went now away with a fair Wind for Brafi 
and in about twelve Days Time we made Land 1 
the Latitude of five Degrees South of the Line, k 
ing the North-Eaftermoft Land of all that Part ( 
America. We kept on S* by E. in Sight of the Shoi 
four Days, when we made Cape St. Augufihte.^ ar 
in three Days came to an Anchor off of the Bay 
all Saints^ the old Place of my Deliverance, froi 
whence came both by good and evil Fate. 

Never Ship came to this Part that had lefs Bu 
nefs than I had ^ and yet it was with great Diffici 
ty that we were admitted to hold the leaft Con 
fpondency on Shore, not my Partner himfelf, w! 
was alive, and made ,a great Figure among their 
not my two Merchants Truflees, nor the Fame 
my wonderful Prefervation in that Ifland, could 
tain me that Favour : But my Partner remembrin 
that I had given ;oo Moidores to the Prior of tJ 
Monaftery of the Augupines.^ and 272 to the Poc 
went to the Monaftery, and oblig'd the Prior th 
then was, to go to the Governor, and get leavefor r 
perfon^lly, with the Captain, and one more, befid 
eight Seamen, to come on Shore, and no more ^ ai 
this upon Condition abfolutely capitulated for, tb 
we fhould not offer to land any Goods out of t 
Ship, or to carry any Perfon away without Licence 

Th' 



[183] 

They were fo Rri£l with us, as to landing any 
Goods, that it was with extream Difficulty that I 
got on Shore three Bales of Englt[!} Goods, fuch as 
fine broad Cloaths, Stuffs, and fome Linnen, which 
I had brought for a Prefent to my Partner. 

He was a very generous broad hearted Man, tho' 
like me, he came from little at firft j and though he 
knew not that 1 had the leaft Defign of giving him 
any Thing, he fent me on Board a Preient of frelh 
Proviiions, Wine, and Sweet-meats, worth above 
90 Moidores, including f^me Tobacco, and three 
or four fine Medals in Gold : But I was even with 
him in my Prefent, which, ,is I have faid, confitted 
of fine broad Cloatb, HvgUJI) Stuffs, Lace, and fine 
Hollands : Alfo I delivered him about the Value of 
loo lib. Sterl in the lime Goods for other Ufes % 
and I oblig'd him to fet up the Sloop which I had 
brought with me from Evglavd, as I have faid, for 
the Ufe of my Colony, in order to fend the Re- 
frefliments I intended to my Plantation. 

Accordingly, he got Hands, and finiftied the Sloop 
in a very few Days, for (he was already fram'd, 
and I gave the Malter of her fuch InftruSlions, as 
be could not mifs the Place, nor did he mifs them^ as 
Ihad an Account from my tartner afterwards, i got 
him foon loaded with the fmall Cargo I had lent 
them 5 and one of our Seamen that had been on 
(hore with me there, offer'd to go with the Sloop, 
and fettle there upon my Letter to the Governour 
Spaniardj to allot him a fiifficient quantity of Land 
for a Plantation ^ and giving him fome Cloaths, and 
Tools for his Planting- Work, which he faid he un- 
derftood, having been an old Planter zi Maryland^ 
and a Buckaneer into the Bargaiuo 

I encouraged the Fellow, by granting all he defir- 
ed ^ and as an Addition I gave him the Savage, which 
we had taken Prifoner of War, to be his Slave, and 
order'd the Governour Spaniard to give himihisftiare 
of every thing he wanted with the reft« 

M ^ ' - When, 



[ i84 1 

When we came to fie this Man out, my old Part" 
nertoid me there was a certain very honeft Fellow 
a Brajil¥hmti or h'^ --q-cinrance, who had fallen 
into the Dlfpleafure of the Church; I know not 
what the matter is with him, fays he ^ bur on my 
Conicience, I think he is an Herer'ck in his Heart, 
and he has been obliged to corceal himfelf for fear 
of the Inqulfirion •, that he v^ould be very glad of 
fuch an Opponunity to make his Efcape with his 
Wife and two Daughters % and if I would let them 
go to my Ifland, and allot them a Plantafion, he 
would give them a fmal] Stock to begin wich ^ for 
the Officers of the Jnquifirion had feiz'd all his Ef- 
fefls and Eitate, and he had nothing left but a little 
Houfliold Stuff and two Slaves. And, adds he^ 
Tho' I hate his Principles, yet I woold nor have 
him fall into their Hands ^ for he would affuredly 
be burnt alive, if he does. 

I -granted this prefently, and joln'd my EjigliJI) 
Man with them, and we conceaFd ibe Man, and his 
Wife and Daughters on Board our Shipj "till the 
Sloop put cur, to go to Sea ^ and then (having put 
all their Goods on board the Sloop, fome time be- 
fore^ we put them on board the Sloop, after he was 
got out of the Bay. 

Out Seamen was mightily pleas'd with this new 
Partner y and rheir Stock indeed was much alike rich 
in Tools, in Preparations, and a Farni, but nothing 
to begin with but as above : However, they carried 
over with them, which was worth all the reft, fome 
Materials for planting Sugar Canes, with fome 
Plants of Canes ^ which he, I mean, the Tortugal 
Man, underftood very well. 

Among the reft of the Supplies fent my Tenants 
in the ifland, 1 fent them by this Sloop, three Milch 
Cows, and fiveCalves,about 2 2Hogs among 'em,three 
Sows big with Pig, two Mares, and Stone- Horfe. 

For my Spaniards^ according to my promife, I en- 
gaged three Forfugal Women to go, and recom- 
mended 



[ i85 



j mended it to them to marry them, and ufe them 
kindly. I could have procured more Women, but 
I remembered, that the poor perfecuted Man had 
two Daughters, and there was bur ^vq of the Spani- 
ards that wanred ^ the reft had Wives of their own, 
tho' in another Country. 

All this Cargoe arrived (afe, and as you may eali- 
ly fuppofe, very welcome to my old Inhabitants, 
who were now with this Addition between fixty and 
ieventy People, besides little Children ; of which, 
there was a great many : I found Letters at London 
from them all by the Way of Lisbon^ when I came 
back to England^hQin^ fent back to the Brajils by this 
Sloop,of whichi ftiall take fome Notice in it's Place. 

I have now done with my Ifland, and all Manner 
of Difcourfe about it 5 and whoever reads the reft 
of my Memorandums, would do well to turn his 
Thoughts entirely from it, and expeft to read only 
of the Follies of an old Man, not warn'd by his own 
Harms, much lefs by thofe of other Men, to beware 
of the like •, not cooFd by almoft forty Years Mife- 
ry and Difappointments, not fatisfy'd with Profpe- 
rity beyond Expe&.ation, not made cautious by Af- 
fli£}ion and Diftrefs beyond Imitation. 

I had no more Bufinefs to go to the EaJI-Indies^ 
than a Man at full Liberty, and having comlcted no 
Crime, has to go to the Turn»key at Nerpgate^ and 
defire him to lock him up among the Prifoners there, 
and ftarve him. Had I taken a fmall Veffel from 
England, and went direftly to the Hland^ had I 
loaded her, as I did the other Veflel, with all the 
Neceffaries for the Plantation, and for my People, 
took a Patent from the Government here, to have 
fecur'd my Property, in fubjeftion only to that of 
England to be fure I might have obtain'd*, had I 
carried over Cannon and Ammunition, Servants and 
People, to plant, and taking poffeflion of the Place, 
fortified and itrengthen'd it in the N^mQ o[ England^ 
and increased it with People, as I might ealily have 

done j 



[1S6-] 1 

done ; had I then fettPd myfelf there, and fent the 
Ship back, loaden with good Rice, as I might alfa 
have done in fix Months tinae, and order'd my Friends 
to have fitted her out again for our Supply •, had I 
done this, and ftaid there myfelf^ I had, at leaft, 
afled like a Man of common Senfe ^ but I was pof- 
feft with a wandring Spirit, fcorned all Advantages, | 
pleafed myfelf with being the Patron of thofe Peo- ' 
pie I had placed there, and doing for them in a kind 
of haughty majeftick Way, like an old Patriarchal 
Monarch ^ providing for them, as if I had been Fa- 
ther of the whole Family, as well as of the Planta- 
tion : But I never fo much as pretended to plant in 
the Name of any Government or Nation, or to ac- 
knowledge any Prince, or to call my People Subjefts 
to any one Nation more than another •, nay, 1 never 
fo much as gave the Place a Name ^ but left it as I 
found it, belonging to no Man ^ and the People un- ' 
der no Difcipline or Government hot my own ^ who^ 
tho' I had influence over them as Father and Benefa- 
Sor, had no Authority or Power, to Aft or Com- 
mand one way or other, farther than voluntary Con- 
fent mov'd them to comply ^ yet even this, had I 
ftaid there, would have done well enough 5 but as I 
rambl'dfrom them, and came there no more, thelaft 
Letters I had from any of them, was by my Partners, 
means ^ who afterwards fent another Sloop to the 
Place, and who fent me word, tho' I had not the 
Letter 'till five Years after it was written ^ that they 
went on but poorly, were Male content with their 
long ftay there ^ That TfiH. Atkins was dead •, That 
five of the Spaniards were come away, and that tho* 
they had not been much moleKed by the Savages^ 
yet they had had fome Skirmiflies with them ^ That 
they begg'd of him to write to me, to think of the 
Promile i had made, to fetch 'em away that they 
might lee their own Country again before they 
ifd. 

But I was gone a Wili Goofe Chafe indeed -, and.

They who will have any more of me, muft be con- 
tent to follow me thro' a new Variety of Follies, 
Hardfhips, and Wild Adventures •, wherein the Ju- 
ftice of Providence may be duly obferved, and we 
may fee how eafily Heaven can gorge us with our 
own Defires ; make the ihongelt of onr Wiflies to 
be our Affliftion, and punifli us molt feverely with 
thofe very Things, which we think, it would be our 
utmoft Happinefs to be allowM in 

Let no wife Man flatter himfelf, with the Strength 
of his own Judgment^ as if he was ab^e to chufe 
any particular Station of Life for himfelf: Man, 
is a fliort lighted Creature, fees but a very little 
Way before him 5 and as his Paffions, are none of 
his beft Friends, fo his particular Affeftions, are 
generally his worft Counfellors, 

I fay this, with Refpeft to the irnpetuous Defire 
I had from a Youth, to wander into the Worlds 
and how evident it now was, that this Principle was 
preferv'd in me for my Punifhment : How it came 
on, the Manner, the Circumdance, and the Conclu- 
fion of it, it is eafy to give you Hiftorically^ and 
with its utmoft Variety of Particulars : But the le- 
pret Ends of Divine Power, in thus permitting us, to 
be hurry'd down to the Stream of our own Defires, 
is only to be underftood of thofe who can liften to 
the Voice of Providence, and draw religious Confe- 
quences from God's Juftice and their own Miftakes. 

Be it, I had Bufinefs, or no Btifinefs, away ! went ; 
'tis no Time now to enlarge any farther upon the 
Reafon, or Abfordity of my own Conduft 5 but to 
come to the Hiftory, I was embark'd for the Voyage, 
and the Voyage I went. 

I fhould only add here, that my Honeft and truly 
pious Clergyman left me here ; a Ship being ready 
to go to Lisbon^ he ask'd me leave to go thither ^ 
being flill, as he ohfervd, bound never to finifh any 
Voyage he began : How happy had it been for me^ 
if I had gone with him ! 

But 



[ i88 1 

But it was too late now •, all things Heaven ap- 
points are beft , had I gone with him, 1 had never 
bad fo many things to be thankful for, and you had 
never heard of the fecond Part of the Travels and 
Adventures oi RobhuCrvfoe-^ fo I muft leave here 
the fruitlefs exclaiming ac myfelf, and go on with 
my Voyage. 

From the Bvafih^ we made dire£Hy away over the 
^lantick Sea^ to the Cape de bon EJperance^ or as we 
call it, the Cape of Good Hope •, and had a tolerable 
good Voyage, our Courfe generally South Eaft ^ now 
and then a Storm, and fome contrary Winds, but 
my Difafters at Sea were at an End ^ my future 
Rubs and crofs Events were to befal me on (hore ^ 
ihat it might appear, the Land was as well prepaid 
to be our Scourge, as the Sea *, when Heaven, who 
dire£ts the Circumftances of Things, pleafes to ap- 
appoint it to befo. 

Our Ship was on a Trading Voyage, and had a 
Supra Cargo on board, who was to direft all her Mo- 
dons after fhe arrived at the Cape ^ only being limit- 
ed to certain Numbers of Days, for ftay, by Char- 
ter-party, at the feveral Ports fhe was to go to : 
This was none of my Bufinefs, neither did I med- 
dle with it at all ^ my Nephew, the Captain, and 
the Supra Cargo^ adjufling all rhofe things between 
them, as they thought fit. 

We made no &dy at the Cape^ longer than was 
iicedful, to take in frefli Water ^ but made the beft 
©f our way, for the Coaft of Coremandel ^ we were 
indeed informed, that a French Man of War of 
Bhy Guns, and two large Merchant Ships, were 
gone for the hdies^ and as I knew we were at War 
with France, I had fome Apprehenfions of them ; 
but they went their own Way, and we heard no 
more of them.

idian-Diftances, Trade-Winds, Situation of Ports, 
and the like 5 fuch as almoft all the Hiftories of 
long Navigation are full of, and which make the 
reading tirefome enough, and are perfe£^ly unprofi- 
table to all that read, except only to thofe, who are 
to go to thofe Places thennfelves. 

It is enough to name the Ports and Places, which 
we touched at, and what occurr'd to us upon our 
paffing from one to another. We totich'd firft at the 
Ifland of Madagafcar ^ where, tho' the People are 
fierce and treacherous, and in particular, very well 
arm'd with Launces and Bows, which they ule with 
inconceivable Dexterity 5 yet we fared very well 
with them a while ^ they treated us very civilly^ 
and for fome Trifles, which we gave them, fuch as 
Knives, Sciffars, ^c, they brought us eleven good 
fat Bullocks, middling in Size, but very good in 
Flefh 5 which we took in, partly for frefh Provifi- 
ons for our prefent fpending, and the reft, to Salt 
fbr the Ship's Ule. 

We were obliged to (fay here fome Time, after we 
had furnifli'd ourfelves vyith Provifions 1 and I, that 
was always too curious, to look into every Nook of 
the World where ever I came, was for going on 
Shore as often as I could : It was on the Eaft Side 
of the Ifland that we went on Shore, one Evening^ 
and the People, who by the Way are very numerous^ 
came thronging about us, and ftood gazing at us at 
a Diftance: As we had traded freely with thenrjj 
and had been kindly ufed, we thought ourfelves in 
no Danger *, but when we law the People, we cue 
three Boughs out of a Tree, and fluck them tip at a 
Diftance from us, which it feems, is a Mark \n the 
Country not only of Truce and Friendfliip, but 
when it is accepted, the other Side fet up three 
Poles or Boughs alfo, which is a Signal, that they 
accept the Truce too-, but then, this is a known 
Condition of the Truce, that you are not to pais be- 
yond their three Poles towards them^ nor they to 

come 



come paft your three Poles or Boughs, towards youi 
fo that you are perfeftly fecure within the three 
Poles, and all the Space between your Poles and 
theirs, is allowed like a Market, for free Convarfe, 
TrafRck, and Commerce : When you go there, you 
mlift not carry your Weapons with you ^ and if 
ihey come into that Space they flick up their Jave- 
lines and Launces, all at the firfl: Poles, and come 
on unarmed ^ but if any Violence is offer'd them, 
and the Trute thereby broken 5 away they run to 
the Poles, and lay hold of their Weapons, and then 
the Truce is at an End. 

It happened one Evening when we went on Shore, 
that a greate* Number of their People came down 
than ufual, all was very friendly and civil : They 
brought with them feveral Kinds of Frovifions, for 
which we fatisfied them, with fuch Toys as we had $ 
their Woman alfo brought us Milk, and Roots, and 
feveral Things very acceptable to us, and all was 
quiet 5 and we made us a little Tent or Hut, of fome 
Boughs of Trees, and lay on Shore all that Night. 

I know not what was the Occafion, but I was 
not fo well fatisfied to lye on Shore as the reff, and 
the Boat lying at an Anchor, about a Stone caft 
from the Land, with two Men in her to take care 
of her 5 I made one of them come on Shore, and 
getting fome Boughs of Trees to cover us alfo in the 
Boat, I Ipread the Sail on the Bottom of the Boar, 
and lay under the Cover of the Branches of Trees 
all Night. 

About two a Clock in the Morning, we heard 
one of our Men make a terrible Nolle on the Shore, 
calling out for God's fake, to bring the Boat in, and 
come and help them for they were all like to be 
murther'd ^ at the fame time, I heard the firing of 
5 Muskets, which was the Number of the Guns 
they had, and that, three times over •, for it feems, 
the Natives here were not fo eafily frighted with 
Guns, as the Savages were in America^ where I had 
to do with them. All 



[ 191 1 

AH this while, I knew not what was the Matter ^ 
fcut rouzing immediately from Sleep with the Noife, 
I caus'd the Boat to be thruft in, and refolv'd, with 
three Fufils we had on Board, to Land, and affift 
our Men. 

We got the Boat foon to the Shore, but our Men 
were in too much hatte: For being come to the 
Shore, they plunged into the Water, to get to the 
Boar, with all the Expedition they could, being pur- 
fued by between three and four hundred Men : Our 
Men were but Nine in all, and only five of them 
had Fufils with them •, the reft indeed had Piftols 
and Swords, but they were of fmall ufe to them. 

We took up feven of our Men, and with Dif- 
ficulty enough too, three of them being very ill 
wounded ^ and that which was flill worfe, was, 
that while we flood in the Boat to take our Men 
in, we were in as much Danger as they were in on 
Shore 5 for they pour'd their Arrows in upon us 16 
thick, that we were fain to barricade the Side of 
the Boat up with the Benches, and two or three 
ioofe Boards, which to our great Satisfa£lion, we 
had by itiere Accident, or Providence rather^ in the 
Boat. 

And yef^ had it been Day-light, they are it feems 
fuch exafl: Marks-men, that if they could have feen 
but the leaft Part of any of us, they would have 
been fure of Us 5 we had by the Light of the Moon 
a little Sight of them, as they flood pelting us from 
the Shore with Darts and Arrows ; and having got 
ready our Fire-arms, we gave them a Volley, and 
we could hear by the Cries of fome of them, that 
we had wottnded feveral •, however, they flood thus 
in Battle Array on the Shore 'till break of Day, 
which we fuppofe was, that they might fee the bet* 
ter to take their Aim at us. 

In this Condition we lay, and could not tell how 
to weigh cur Anchor, or fet up our Sail, becaufe 
we muft useds ftand up in the Boat, and they were 

as 



[ IP2 ] 

as lure to hit us, as we were to hit a Bird in a Tree 
with fmall Shot 5 we made Signals of Diftrels to 
the Ship, which, tho' we rode a League ofF, yet 
my Nephew the Captain hearing our firing, and by 
Glafles, perceiving the PoKure we lay in, and that 
we fir'd towards the Shore, pretty well under ftood 
us 5 and weighing Anchor, with all fpeed, he ftood 
as near the Shore as he durft with the Ship, and 
then fent another Boat, with ten Hands in her, to al- 
fift us 5 but we caird to them not to come too near^ 
telling them what Condition we were in : However, 
they ftood in nearer too us ^ and one of the Men ta- 
king the End of a Tow-Line in his Hand, and keep- 
ing our Boat between him and the Enemy, fo that 
they could not perfeftly iee him^ fwam on board uSj 
and made faft the Line to the Boat •, upon which we 
flipp'd our little Cable, and leaving our Anchor be- 
hind, they tow'd us out of the reach of the Arrows, 
we all the while lying clofe behind the Barricado we 
had made. 

As loon as we were got from between the Ship 
and the Shore, that (he could lay her Side to the 
Shore, (he run along joft by them and we pour'd 
in a Broad- jfide among them loaden with Pieces of 
Iron and Lead, fmall Bullets, and fuch ftufF, befides 
the great Shot 5 which made a terrible Havock 
amongft them. 

When we were got on board and out of Danger, 
we had time to examine into the Occafion of this 
Fray •, and indeed our Supra- Cargo who had been 
often in thofe Parts, put me upon it 5 for he faid, 
he was fure the Inhabitants would not have touch'd 
us, after we had made a Truce, if we had not done 
fomething to provoke them to it. At length it 
came out (viz.) that an Old Women who had come 
to fell us fome Milk, had brought it within our 
Poles, with a young Woman with her, who alfo 
brought fome Roots or Herbs •, and while the Old 
Woman, whether fhe was Mother to the young Wo- 
man, 



[ t93 3 

man or no, they could not tell, was felling iis the 
Milk, one of our Men offer'd fome Rudenefs to the 
Wench that was with her, at which the old Woman 
made a great Noife : However, the Seaman would 
not quit his Prize, but carried her cut of the old 
Woman's Sight among the Trees, it being almoft 
dark 5 the old Woman went away without her, 
land as we fuppofe, made an Out-cry among the 
{People (he came from ^ who upon Notice, raised 
jthis great Army upon us in three or four Hours ; 
land it was great oddSj but we had been all de- 
firoy'd. 

One of our Men was killed, with a Launce that 
was rhrown at him, jutt at the beginning of the 
Attack, as he falley'd out of the Tent we had made ^ 
the rfft came off free, all but the Fellow who was 
the Occafion of all the Mifchief, who paid dear 
enough for his black Miftrefs 5 for we could not 
hear what became of h^m, a great while; we lay 
upon the Snore two Days after, tho' the Wind pre- 
fented, and made Signals for him ♦, made our Boat 
fail up Shore and down Shore^ feveral Leagues, but 
I in vain-, fo we were oblig'd to give him over, and 
if he alone had fulFetUfor it, the Lofs had been the 
lefs. 

I could not fatisfy myfelf, however, without 

venturing on Shore once more, to try if I could 

I learn any Thing of him, or them -, it was the third 

I Night after the Aftion, that i had a great Mind 

ito learn if I could hy any Means, what Mifchief 

we had done, and how the Game ftood on the In- 

, diavs Side : I was careful to do it in the dark, left 

we fhould be attacked again ^ but fought indeed to 

have been fure, that the Men I went with, had been 

under my Gommandj before I engag'd in a Thing fo 

i hazardous and mifchievous as f was brought into hy 

it, without my Knowledge or DeOgn. 

;i We took twenty flout Fellows with us as ary 

jin the Ship, beiides the Supra Cargo and myfeil^

and we landed two Hours before Midnight, at the 
fame Place where the Indians flood drawn up the 
Evening before ^ I landed here, becaufe my Defign 
as I have faid, was chiefly to fee if they had quit- 
ted the Field, and if they had left any Marks be 
hind them of the Mifchief we had done them ^ and 
I thought, if we could furprize one or two of them 
perhaps we might get our Man again by Way oi 
Exchange. 

We landed without any Noife, and divided ou' 
Men into two Companies, whereof, the Boatfwaii 
commanded one, and I the other : We neirhe 
could fee or hear any Body ftir when we landed, f 
^;ve march'd up, one Body at a Diftance from th 
other, to the Field of Battle : At firft, we could fe 
nothing it being very dark 5 But by and by, ou 
Boatfwain that lead the firft Party, ftumbled an 
fell over a Dead Boy ^ this made them halt a whil( 
for knowing by the Circumftances that they were i 
the Place were thQ Indians had Itood, they waite 
for my coming up 5 here we concluded to halt 'ti|| 
the Moon began to rife, which we knew would be i 
lefs than an Hour 5 and then we could eafily difce 
the HavQck we h'^d made among them ^ we to! 
two and thirty Bodies upon the Ground, where< 
two were not quite dead : Some had an Arr 
and fome a Leg fliot off, and one his Head ^ tho 1 
that were wounded we fappos'd, they had carric 
away. 

W'hen we had made, as I thought, a full Difc 
t^ery of all we could come at the Knowledge of, 
was for going on Board again •, but the Boatfwa 
and his Party of ;en, fent me Word, that they we 
refolv'd to make a Vifit to the hidian Town, whe 
thefe Dogs, iis they calVd them^ dwelt, and defir'd r 
to go along with them ^ 2nd if they could fi 
them, as Itnl they fanfied they fJ;iould, they did r 
doubt they faid getting a good Booty, and it mig

Had rhey ferit to ask my Leave to go, I knew 
ivell enough what Anfwer to have given them ^ for 
I would have commanded them inltantly on Board, 
knowing jc w.is not a Hazard fie for us to run •, who 
had a Ship, and Ships loading in our Charge, and 
a Voyage ro make, which depended very much up- 
on the Lives of the Men 5 but as they fenc me 
Word they were refolved to go, and only ask'd me 
and my Company to go along with them -^ I pofi- 
tively reftis'd'ir, and rofe up, for I tpos fitting oit the 
Groiivd^ in Order to go to the Boat 5 one or two of 
the Men, began to imporiiineme to go, and when I 
ftiil refus'd pofitively, began to grumble, and fay they 
were not under my Command^ and they would go : 
Come jjc/c, lay 5 one of the Men, will you go with 
me ? ril go for one •, Jack faid he would, and ano- 
ther followed, and then another ^ and in a Word, 
they all left me bur one, who with mdch difficulty 
too, I perfuided to ftay 5 fo the Supra Cargo and I, 
with the third Man, went back to the Boar^ where 
/ told the??i we would ftay for them, and take Care, 
to take in as many of them as fhould be left ^ for J 
told 'em it was a mad Thing they were going aboiit„ 
and fuppofed moft of 'em would rtiri the Face of 
Tho. Jefry, 

They told me, like Seamen, they'd warrant it they 
would come off again, and they would take care, 
iffc. So away they went : 1 entreated 'em i > confider 
the Ship and the Voyage 5 that their Lives were 
not their own, and that they were entrulled -virh 
the Voyage in fome meafnre ^ that if they miicar- 
ry'd, the Ship might l>e lolt for want of their Help, 
and thanhey could not anfwer it to God of Man i 
I faid a great deal more to 'em on. that Head, but 
I might as well have taik'd to ih^ Main ?^aii of che 
Ship, they were mad upon their Journey, only 
they gave me good Words, and begg'd i would not

they did not dotibt but I'mj wotild be back again m

about an Hour at fartheft^ iot thQ Indian Tov^n^ 
they faid, was not above half a Mile ofF : Jho^ 
the^ found it above two Miles before they got to it. 

Well, they all went away, as above 5 and tho' 
the Attempt was defperate, and fuch, as none but 
mad Men would have gone about, yet to give 'em 
their due, they went ab©ut it warly as well as bold- 
ly s They were galantly armed, that's true ^ for 
they had every Ma^i a Fuzee or Musket, a Bayonet^ 
and every Man a Piftol •, fome of them had broad 
Cutlaffes, fome of them Hangers and the Boarfwaiii 
and Two more had PoIe^Axes : Befides all which, 
they had among them Thirteen Hand-Grenados. 
Bolder Fellows, and better provided, never went 
about any wicked Work in the World. 

When they went out, their chief Defign was 
Plunder, and they were in mighty hopes of finding 
Gold there 5 but a Circumftance which none of 
them were aware of, fet them on fire with Revenge, 
and made Devils of them all. When they came to 
the few Indian Houfes, vi'hich they thought had 
httn the Town, which was not above half a Mile 
oiF^ they were under a great Difappointment ^ for 
there were not above 12 or thirteen Houfes 5 and 
where the Town was, or how big, they knew not : 
They confulted therefore what to do, and were 
fome time before they could refolve : For if they 
fell upon thefe, they muft cut all their Throats, 
and it was ten to one but fome of them might: 
efcape, it being in the Night, tho' the Moon was 
up 5 and if one efcaped, he would run away, and 
raife all the Towns, fo they fhould have a wholfe 
Army upon them : Again, on the other hand, if 
they went away and left thofe untouch'd (for the 
People were all aileep) they could not tell which 
Way to look for the Town. 

riowever, the lalt was the beft Advice 5 fo thejri 
lefolved to leave thofe Houfes, and look for the 
Town as well as they could : They went on a littlej 
* wajr^ 



vyay, and found a Cow tied to a Tree -^ this they 
prefeotly concluded, would be a good Guide to 
them i for they faid, the Cow certainly belonged to 
the Town before them, or the Town behind them 5 
and if they untied her, they Ihould fee which Way 
fhe went 5 if (he went back they had nothing to 
fay to her ^ but if Ihe went forward, they had no- 
thing to do but to follow her : So they cut the Cord^ 
which was made of twilled Flags, and the Cowwent 
on before them 5 in a Word, the Cow led them dire£lly 
to the Town, which as they report, confifted of 
above 200 Houfes, or Huts ^ and in fome of thefej 
they found feveral Families living together. 

Here they found all in Silence 5 as profoundly 
fecure, as Sleep, and a Country that had never 
I feen an Enemy of that Kind, could make them 1 
I and firft, they calFd another Council to confider 
! what they had to do ^ and in a Word, they re- 
': folv'd to divide themfelves into three Bodies, and 
i to fet three Houfes on Fire in three Parts of the 
I Town i and as the Men came out, to feize them 
1 and bind them ^ if any refifted, they need not be 
isk'd what to do then^ and fo to fearch the reft of 
: the Houfes for Plunder 5 but they refolv'd to march 
I iilently firft, thro' the Town, and lee what Dinien- 
I fions it was of, and if they might venture upon it 
I or no/ 

! They did fo, and defperately refolv'd that they 
I would venture upon them 5 but while they were 
' animating one another to the Work, three of them 
i that were a little before the reft, call out aloud, and 
I told them they haid found Thorn, Je§ry % they all 
ran up to the Place, and fo it was indeed 5 for 
there they found the poor Fellow, hang'd up naked 
i by one Arm, and his Throat cut 5 there was an In- 
dian Houfe juft hy the Tree, where they found fix- 
teen or feventeen of the principal J?/if^??^ wHo had 
been concerned in the Fray with us before ^ and two 
or three of them wounded with our Shot ^ and our

Men found they were awake, and talking one to 
another in that Houfe, but knew not their Nunn- 
ber. 

The Sight of their poor mangled Comrade fo 
enrag'd 'en), as before, that they fwore to one ano- 
ther they would be reveng'd^ and that noc an Indi'- 
an who came into their Hands (houid have Quarter, 
and to work they went immediately ^ and yet not fo 
madly as by the Rage and Fury they were in might 
be expefted. Their firft Care was ro gee fom;:ching 
that would loon take Fire -^ but aicer a little fearch, 
they found that would be to no purpofe ^ for molt 
of the Houfes were low, and Thatch'd vAih Flags 
or Rufhes, of which the Country is full ^ io they 
prefently made fome wild Fire, as we call it^ by wet- 
ting a little I'owder in the Palms of their Hands, 
and in a quarter of an Hour they fee the Town on 
fire in four or five Places ^ and particularly that 
Houfe where the Indians were not gone lo Bed. As 
foon as che Fire began to bb^e, the poor frighted 
Creatures began to rofh ouc to faye their Lives , but 
inet wich their Fate in the Auenipi, and efpecially 
at the Door, vyhere they drove tbeai back, che Boat- 
fwain himffclf kilJing one or two vvith his Pole- Ax j 
The Houfe being large, and many in it, he did not 
care to go in, but caiFd for a Hand-Grenado, and 
threw it amoag 'em, vvhicb at tirft trigbted 'em ^ 
but when it burit, made fuch Havock among 'em> 
that they cried ouc in a hideous manner. 

In fhort, moft of the halms who were in the 
open Part of the Houfe, were killed or hurt with 
the Grenado, except two or three more who p efs'd 
to the Door, which the Soatfwain and two more 
kept with their Bay ones in the Muzzles of their 
Pieces, and difpatch'd all who came that Way, 
But there was another Apartment in the Houfe where 
the Prince or King, or whatfoever he was and feve- 
ral others were, and thefe they kept in till rhe Houle, 
which was by this time all of a light Flame, fell in

upon theiDj and they were finother'd or burnt to- 
gether. 

All this while they fir'd not 3 Gun, becaufe they 
would not waken the People falier than they could 
mafter them ; but the Fire began to waken them faft 
enough, and our Felicws were glad to keep a little 
together in bodies 5 for the Fire grew fo raging, all 
the Houfes being made of light combuftibk Stuff, 
that they could hardly bear the Street between them, 
and their Bufinefs was to follow the Fire for the 
furer Executions As fait as the Fire either forc'd 
the People out of thofe Houfes which were burning^ 
or frighted them out of others, our People wers 
ready at their Doors to knock them on the Head, 
ftill calling and hallowing to one another to remem- 
ber Tho. Jefrys. 

While this was d©ing, I muft confefs I was very 
uneafie, and efpecially when I faw the Flames of 
the Town, which, it being Night, feem'd to be juft 
by me. 

Ny Nephew, the Captain, who was rouz'd hy 
his Men too, feeing luch a Fire, was very uneafie, 
not knowing what the Matter was, or what Danger 
I was in 5 efpecially hearing the Guns too ; for by 
this time they began to ufe their Fire-Arms ^ a thou- 
fand Thoughts opprefi his Mind concerning me, 
and the Supra Cargo, what ihoiild become of us z 
And atbft, tho' he could ill fpare any more Men^ 
yet not knowing what Esiger.ce we might be in, he 
takes another Boar, and with 13 Men and himfelf^ 
comes on Shore to me. 

He was lurpri::'d to lee ibs and the Sopra-Cargo 
in the Boat with no more than two Men, for Ona 
Ji.id been left to keep the Boar ^ and tho' he was glad 
that we were well/ yet he was in the fame impati- 
ence with us to kno^y what was doing 5 for the 
Noife continued and the Flame encreas^d : I Con- 
fefs, it was next to an Impoiribillty for any Men irr 
the World to reftrain their Curioiity of knowing.

what had happen'd, or their Concern for the Safety i 
of the Men : In a Word, the Captain told me, he I 
would go and help his Men, let what would come, j 
I argu'd with him as I did before with the Men 5 j 
the Safety of the Ship, and the Danger of the 
Voyage, the Intereft of the Owners and Merchant, 
^c. and told him, I would go and the two Men, and 
only fee if ue could at a Diftance learn what was 
like to be the Event, and come back and tell him. 

It was all one, to talk to my Nephew, as it was. 
to talk to the relt before •, he would go he fald^ and 
he only wifh'd he had left but ten Men in the Ship ; 
for he could not chink of having his Men loft for 
want of Help,he had rather loofe theShip, the Voyage, 
and his Life and all •, and fo, away went he. 

Nor was I any more able to ffay behind now, 
than I was to perfuade them not to go before ; fo in 
lliorr, the Capatin order'd two Men to row back 
the Pinnace, and fetch twelve Men more from the 
Ship, leaving the Long Boat at an Anchor, and that 
when they came back, fix Men ftiould keep the two 
Boats and fix more come after us ^ fo that he left 
only 16 Men in the Ship ^- for the whole Ship's 
Company confifted of 65 Men, whereof two were 
loft in the firft Qjiarrel, which brought this Mif- 
chief on. 

Being now on the March, you may be fure we 
felt little of the Ground we trode on ^ and being 
guided by the Fire, we kept no Path, but went di- 
reftly to the Phce of the Flame : If the Noife of 
the Guns was furpri/^ing to us before, the Cries of 
the poor People were no^^^ of quire another Nature, 
and fiird us with Horror. I mult confefs 1 never was 
at the lacking of a City, or at the taking of a 
Town, by Itorm. I have beard of OUvey Crom'mell 
taking Drogheda in Irelavd^ and killing Man, Wo- 
man and Child : And I had read of Count TiUy^ 
lacking of the City of Magdehnrgh^ and cutting the 
Throats of 22000 of all Sexes : But I never had an 

Idea 



[ 201 ] 

Idea of the Thing itfelf before, nor is it poflible to 
defcribe ir, or the Horror which was upon our 
Minds at hearing it. 

However, vv'e went on, and at length came to the 
Town, tho' there was no entring the Streets of it 
for the Fire. The firft OhjeO: we met with, was 
the Ruins of a Hut or Hcufe, or rather the Afhes of 
ir, for the Houfe was confnm'd ^ and jult before ir, 
l>hin now to be feen by the Light of the Fire, lay- 
four Men and three Women kili'd 5 and as we 
thought, one or two more lay in the Heap among 
the Fire. In fhort, there were fuch Inliances of a 
Rage altogether barbarous, and of a Fury, fomething 
teyond what was human, that we thought it impof- 
fible our Men could be guilty of it ^ or if they 
were the Authors of ir, we thought they every one 
of 'em ought to be put to the worit of Deaths. 
But this was not alj, we faw the Fire encreas'd for- 
ward, and the Cry went on juft as the Fire went on 5 
fo that we were in the utmoft Confufion. We ad- 
yanc'd a little Way fartlier, and behold, to our A- 
ftonifhment, three Women naked, and crying in a 
molt dreadful Manner, come flying, as if they had 
indeed had Wings, and after them (ixreen or feven- 
teen Men, Natives, in the fame Teircr, and Con- 
flernation with three of our Evglij?) Butchers, for I 
€a7i caU thevt m better^ in their Rear ^ who, when 
they could not overtake them, fir'd in among them, 
and one that was kilFd by their Shot fell down in 
our Sight ^ when the relt faw us, believing us to be 
their Enemies, and that we would Murther them as 
well as thole that purfiied them, they let up a moft 
dreadful Shreik, efpecially the Women § and two of 
them fell down as if already dead with the Fright. 

My very Soul fhrunk within me, and my Blood 
run chil in my Veins, when I hw this ^ and 1 believe, 
had the three Englif) Sailors that purfu'd them come 
On, I had made our Men kill them all : However, 
we took fome Ways to let the poor flying Creatures 

know.

p^m, that we would not hurt them, and immedi- 
ately they came up to us, and kneeling down, with 
^tr Hands lifted up, made piteous Lamentation to 
ins. to fave them, which we let them know we would ^ 
^Thereupon the/ kept altogether in a Heddle dole 
Ijdiind us for Proteftion. I left my Men drawn up 
together, and charg'd them to hert no Body, but if 
pofSble to get at fome of our People, and fee what 
Ekvil it was pofTeQ" them, and what they intended 
mdo ^ and in a Word, to command them ofF^ aP 
fauing them, that if they ftay'd 'till DayJight, they 
noidd have an hundred thou&nd Men about theij 
"Ems I: I fay, I left them, and went amoag thofe fly» 
hg. People, taking only two of our Men with me 5 
md there was indeed a piteous SpeGacle among 
■$bsm: Some of them had their Feet terribly burnt 
with trampling and running thro' the Fire^ others 
^idf Hands burnt ^ one of the Women had fallen 
liown in the Fire, and wasalmoft burnt to Death be- 
fore ffie could get out again ; two or three of the^ 
%(kii had Cms in their Backs ami Thighs from our 
Iden purfuing ^ and another wasfliot thro' the Body» 
fed died while I was there. 

t would fain have learned what the Occafion of 
fffi^ this was, but I could not underftand one Word 
ifey laid 5 tho' by Signs I perceived that fome of 
^m knew not what was the Oceafion themfelvea. 
I was fo terrified in my Thougiiii ai ihis outrageous 
Attempr, that I could not (lay there ^ but wen*- back 
^myown Men, I told them my Refolution, and com- 
leanded them to follow me, when in the very Mo- 
laa&nt came four of our Men with the Boatfwain a£ 
ikcu Head, roving over the Herps of Botiies they 
ifld killed, all cover'd with Blood and Dnlt, as if 
tJiey wanted more People to maffacre, when ora 
B^en hallow'd to rhem as loud as they could hallow, 
liisd with much ado one of them maJe them hear^ 
fe that they knew who. we weiej and came up to 

As 



[ 203 ] 

As foon as the Boatfwain faw us, he fet up a 
Hallow like a Shout of Triumph, for having, as he 
thought, more help come, and without bearing to 
hear me, Captain, fays he. Noble Captain, 1 am 
glad you are come ^ we have not half done yet ^ 
Villains, Hell-hound Dogs ! Til kill as many of them 
as poor Tom. has Hairs upon his Head. We have 
fworn to Ipare none of them, we'll root out the ve^ 
ry Nation of "em from the Earth, and thus he run 
on, out of Breath too with Adion, and would not 
give us leave to (peak a Word. 

At lall, raiCng my Voice, that I might filence him 
a little } Barbarous Dog ! faid /, what are you do- 
ing ? I won't have one Creature touched more, upon 
p3'n of Death. / charge you vpon your Life.^ to (top 
ycur Hands, andJiand/lilihQte^ or you are a dead Man 
this P/ihmte, 

V\^hy^ Sir^ fays he, Do you know what you do^ or 
whatthe) have done ? if you want a Reafon for what 
we have done, come hither-^ and with that he Ihew'd 
me the poor Fellow hanging upon the Tree with his 
Throat cut, 

I confefs, I was urged then myfelf, and at another 
time ihould have been forward enough 5 but I 
thought they had carried their Rage too far, and 
thought of Jacob's Words to his Sons Simeon and 
Levi ^ Ciirfed be their Ayiger^ for it was ferce •, and their 
Wrath^ for it was cruel : But I had now a new Task 
ppon my Hands ^ for when the Men I carried with 
me faw the sight as I had done, I had as much to 
do to reftrain them, as I (hould have had with the 
other J nay, my Nephew himfelf fell in with them, 
and told me in their hearing that he was only con- 
cerned for fear of the Men being overpowered 5 for 
as to the People, he thought not one of 'em ought 
to live 5 for they had all glutted themfelves with the 
Murther of the poor Man, and that they ought to 
be ufed like Murtherers. Upon thele Words, away 
run eight of my Men with the Boatfwain and his 

Crew^ 



[ 204 } 

Crew, to compleat their bloody Work ^ and I fc 
mg k quite out of my Power to reftrain them, came 
sway penfive and fid y for I could not bear the Sight, 
much lefs the horrible Noife and Cries of the poor 
Wretches that fell into their Hands 

I got no Body to eome back with me but the Su- 
pra-Cargo and two Me^^ and with thele I walk'd 
lack to the Boats. It was a very great Piece of Fol- 
ly in me, I confefs, to venture back, as it were 
alone ^ for as k began now to be alrhoft Day, and 
the Alarm had run over the Country, there ftood 
about 40 Men arm'd with Launces and Bows at the 
little Place where the 12 or 19 Houfes ftood menti- 
€nQd before ^ but by Accident I mifs'd the Place^ 
and came dire£l:ly to the Sea-fide, and by the Time 
I got to the Sea-fide it was broad-Day ^ immediate- 
ly I took the Pinnace, and went aboard, and fent hcE 
back to afiilt the Men in what might happen. 

I obferv'd that about the Time that I came to the 
Boat- fide, that the Fire was pretty well out, and 
the Noife abated ^ but in about half an Hour after 
I got on Board, I heard a Volley of our Mens Fire- 
arms, and faw a great Smoak ^ this, as I underftood 
afterwards was our Men falling upon the forty Men^ 
who, as I faid, flood at the few Houfes on the Way 5 
of whom they kill'd fixteen or feventeen, and fet al! 
thofe Houfes on Fire, bat did not meddle with the 
Women or Children. 

By that Time the Men got to the Shore again 
vrith the Pinnace, our Men began to appear 5 they 
came dropping in ioir,e^ and fome, not in two Bo- 
dies, and in Form as thejj[ went out, but all in Heaps, 
Itraggling here, and there, in fuch a Manner, that a 
1Iti:^U Force of refolute Men might have cut them 
all off. 

But the Dread of them was upon the whole 
Country ; The People were amaz'd, and furpri:?:'d, 
and fo frighted, that I believe a hundred of 'em 
would have fkd ar the Sight of but five of our 

Mea 



[ 205 ] 

Men. Nor in all this terrible A&ion was there a 
tilan who made any confiderable Defence ^ they were 
fo furpriz'd between the Terror ©f the Fire, and the 
fudden Attack of our Men in the Dark, that they 
knew not which Way to turn themfelves 5 for if 
they fled one Way, they were met by one Party , 
if back again, by another : So that they were every 
where knock'd down : Nor did any of our Men re- 
ceive the lealt hurt 5 except one who lirain'd his 
Foot, and another had one of his Hands very much 
burnt. 

1 was very angry with my Nephew the Captain, 
and indeed with all the Men in my Mind, but with 
him in particular ^ as well for his a£ling fo out of 
his Duty as Commander of the Ship, and having 
the Charge of the Voyage upon him, as in his 
prompting^ rather than cooling the rage of his Men, 
in fo bloody and cruel an Enterprize, My Nephew 
anfwer'd me very refpeQfully ^ but told me, that 
when he faw the Body of the poor Seaman, whom 
they had murther'd in fuch a cruel and barbarous 
manner, he was not Matter of himfelf, neither couM 
he govern his Paffioo. He own'd, he (hould not 
have done fo, as he was Commander of the^Ship 5 
but as he was a Man, and Nature mcv'd him, he 
could not bear it. As for the reft of the Men, they 
were not fubjedl to me at all, and they knew it 
well enough ^ fo they took no notice of my DiP 
like. 

The next Day we fet fail, fo we never heard any 
more of it i Our MendifFer'd in the Account of the 
Number they kiil'd : Some faid one Thing f:)me ano- 
ther i but according to the beft of their Accounts 
put altogether, they kilFd or defiroyM about 150 
People, Men, Women, and Children^ and left not 
a Houfe fianding in the To'^^n. 

As for the poor Fellow Tho, Jifyys^ as he was 
quite dead,forhis Throat was fo cut,that his Head was 
half oiFj it would do him no Service to bring him 

away^ 



[ 205 1 

away, fo they left him where they found him, only 
took him down from the Tree where he was hang'd 
by one Hand. 

However juft our Men thought this AQion, I was 
againft them in it 5 and I always yfcer ihat Time^ 
told them God would blaft the Voyage 5 for I look'd 
upon all the Blood they flied that Night to be Mur- 
ther in them : For tho' it is true, that they had kill'd 
Tho. Jefrys, yet it was as true that Jejfrys was the 
y\ggrefror, had broken the Truce, and had violated 
or debauch'd a young Woman of theirs, who came 
to our Camp innocently 5 and on the Faith of their 
publick Capitulation. 

The Bbatfwaio defended this Qiiarrel when we 
were afterwards on board : He faid, It was true that 
we feem'd to break the Truce, but really had nor, 
and that the War was begun the Night before by 
the Natives themfelves, who had fhot us, and kill'd 
One of our Men withoat any juft Provocation •, fo 
that as we were in a Capacity to fight them then, 
we might alfo be in a Capacity to do ourlelves Ju- 
Rice upon them, in an extraordinary Manner, that 
tho' the poor Man had taken a little Liberty with a 
Wench, he ought not to have been murther'd, and 
that in fuch a villanous Manner : And that they did 
nothing, but what was juft, and what the Laws of 
God allow'd to be done to Miirtherers. 

One would think this fhculd have been enough to 
have warned us, againft going on Shore among Hea- 
thens and Barbarians : But it is impoffible to make 
Mankind wife, but at their own Expence, and their 
Experience feems to be always ot moft Ul^ to them, 
when it is deareft boughr. 

We were now bound to the Galph of Ferjta^ and 
from thence to the Coaft of Coreviandel^ ojly ro 
touch at Sitrrat : But the chief of the Supra-Cargo's 
Defign lay at the Bay of 5^»f^^/^,where if he mifs'd of 
his Bufinefs outward bound, he was to go up to Chbta^ 
and return to the Coatt as he came Home. 

The 



[ 207 ] 

The firft Difafter that befel us, was in the Giil,p6i 
of Perjia, where 6vq of our Men venturing on Shoit^ 
on the Arabian Side of the Gulph, were furrotiTj* 
ded by the Arabs, and either all kill'd, or carxy'd 
away into Slavery 5 the reft of the Boats Crew we're 
not able to refcue thenn, and had but jutt Timet® 
get off their Boat. I began to upbraid them witfe 
the jult Retribution of Heaven in this Caie : Bnt 
the Boatfwain very warmly told me, he thought I 
went faTther in my Ceniures, than I could (hew amy 
Warrant for in Scripture, and referr'd to the 19 sL 
Luke^ Verfe 4th. where our Saviour intimates, thit 
thofe Men, on whom the Tower of Siloam fell, were 
not Sinners above all the Galileans : But that whicfe 
indeed put me to Silence in the Cafe, was that none 
of thefe five Men, who were now loft, were of tht 
Number of thofe who vyent on Shore to the Maffi* 
ere of Madagafcar 5 (fo I always calVd it^ tho' mrSks^ 
could not bear the J/V^MaflTacre with any Tatienaez} 
And indeed, this lalt Circumftance, as I have faMj, 
put me to Silence for the prefent. 

But my frequent preaching to them on this SuB- 
Jeft, had work Confequences than i expe&d ^ mA 
the Boatfwain, who had been the Head of the At* 
.tempt, came up boldly to me one Time, and toM 
me, he found, that i continually brought that Affak 
upon the Srage, that i made unjuft RefleQions upom 
it, and had ufed the Men very ill on that Acccitat^ 
and himfelf in particular ^ that as I was biit a ?i^ 
fenger, and had no Command in the Ship, or Cor^ 
cern in the Voyage they were not oblidg'd ro bear 
it •, that they did not know, but I might havefoii^ 
ill Defign in my Head, and perh<3ps to cal) them m 
Account for it, when they came to England-^ airf 
that therefore, unlefs I would refolve to have done 
with it 5 and alio, not to concern myfelf any far* 
ther with him, or any of his AfEiirs, he would leav^ 
the Ship ^ for he did noi think it was fafe to fail 
^r^ith me among them. 

I heam 



[ 208 ] 

t teard hinri patiently enough 'till he had done, 
and then told him, that I did confefs I had all along 
oppos'd the Majfacre of Madagafcar^ for fuch I would ^1 
always call it ^ and that I had on all Occafions fpo- / 
ken my Mind freely about it, tho' not more upoii 
him than any of the reft : That as to my having no 
Command in the Ship, that was true : nor did I ex* 
ercife any Authority, only took my Liberty of fpea Ic- 
ing my Mind in Things which publickly concerned 
us all 5 and what Concern 1 had in the Voyage was 
none of his Bufinefs ^ that I was a confiderable Owner 
of the Ship 5 and in that Claim I conceived I had a 
Right to fpeak even farther than I had yet done, 
and would not be accountable to him or any one elfe, 
and begun to be a little warm with him : He made 
but little Reply to me at that Time, and I thought 
that Affair had been over. We were at this Time in 
the Road at Bevgah^ and being willing to fee the 
Place, I went on Shore with the Supra-Cargo in the 
Ship's Boar, to divert myfelf, and towards Evening, 
was preparing to go on Board, when one of the 
Men came to me, and told me, he would not have 
me trouble myfelf to come down to the Boat, fot 
they had Orders not to carry me on Board. Any one 
may guefs what a Surprize I was in at fo infolent a 
MefTage ; and I ask'd the Man who bad him deliver 
that Errand to me ? He told me, the Cockfwain. I 
faid no more to the Fellow, but bad him let them 
know he had deliver'd his Meffage, and that I had 
given him no Anfwer to it. 

I immediately went and found out the Supra-Car- 
go, and told him the Story, adding what I prefently 
forefaw, (viz.) That there would certainly be a Mu- 
tiny in the Ship, and entreated him to go immedi- 
ately on Board the Ship in an tftdian Boar, and ac- 
quaint the Captain of it ; But I might ha'fpai'd this 
Intelligence •, for before 1 had fpoken to him on 
Shore, the Matter was eftefted on Board, The Boat- 
Urt^ain, the Gunner, the Carpenter j and in a Word, 

all 



C 20p ] 

U the Inferiour Officets, as foon as I was gone cfF 
n the Boat, came up to the Quarter Deck, and de- 
ir'd to Ipeak with ihe Captain, and there the Boat- 
wain making a long Harangue for ihe Fellow talk'd 
^ery well, and repeating all he had fa id to me, told 
he Capraiii in few Words, That as I was nt w gone 
peaceably on Shore, they wete loth to ufe any Vio- 
ence with me ^ which, if 1 had not gone on Shore, 
:hey would otherwife have done, to oblidge me to 
lave gone : They therefore thought fit to tell hitn, 
Fhat as they fliipp'd themfelves to ferve in the Ship 
in^er his Command, they would perform it faith- 
ilily : But if 1 would not quit the Ship, or the 
"aprain oblige me to quit it, they would all leav6 
he bhip, and fill no farther with him ^ and at that 
-Vord, ALL, he turn'd his Face about towards 
he Main malt, which was it feems the Signal agre- 
:d on between them ^ at which, all the Seamen be« 
mg got together, they cry'd otst, One and ALL, 
Jne and ALL. 

My Nephew, the Captain, was a Man of Spirit, 
md of great Prelence of Miiid ^ and tho' he was 
iirprizM, you may be fure, at the Thing, yet he 
old thenn calmly, that he would confider cf the 
Thing, but that he could do nothing in ir, 'till he 
lad fpoken to me about it. He us'd fome Argu- 
ments with them, to (hew, them the Qnreafonable- 
lefs and Injiiftice of the Thing : But it was all in 
;/ain, they iwore and fhook Hands round, before his 
i^ace, that they would go all on Shore, unlefs he 
A'ould engage to them, not to foffer me to Come any 
nore on Board the Ship. 

This was a hard Article upon him, who knew his 
Obligation to me, and did not know how I mlgnt 
,:ake it ^ fo he began to talk Civalierly to them told 
:hem that I was a very confiderable Owner of the 
5hip, and that in Juftice he could not put me out 
:)f my own Houle ^ that this was next Door to ierv- 
ing me, as ilie famous Pirate Kid had done, who 



I 210 1 

tnade the Mutiny in a Ship, fet the Captain on 
Shore in an uninhabited Ifland, and run away with 
the Ship i that let them go into what Ship they 
would, if ever they came to England again, it would 
coft them dear ; that the Ship was mine, and that 
he would not put me out of it ^ and that he would 
father loofe the Ship and the Voyage too, than dif- 
oblige me fo much 5 fo they might do as they plea- 
led : However, he would go on Shore, and talk with 
me on Shore, and invited the Boatfwain to go with 
him, and perhaps they might accommodate the 
Matter with me. 

But they all reje^ed the Propofal ^ and faid, they 
would have nothing to do with me any more, nel 
ther on Board, or on Shore ; and if I came or 
Board, they would all go on Shore* Well, faid 
the Captain, if you are all on this Mind, let me gc 
on Shore and talk with him 5 fo away he came tc 
me with this Account, a little after the Meflage hac 
been brought to me from the Cockfwain. 

I was very glad to fee my Nephew, I muft coft 
fefs 5 for 1 was not without Apprehenfions, tha 
they would confine him by Violence, fet fail, an< 
jun away with the Ship, and then I had been ftripp'( 
naked in a remote Country, and nothing to help m] 
felf : In fhort, I had been in a worfe Cafe, thai 
when I was all alone in the Ifland/ 

But they had not come that length, it feems, t 
my great fatisfatbion 5 and when my Nephew tol 
me what they had faid to him, and how they ha 
fworn, and (hook Hands, that they would one an 
aU leave the Ship, if I was fufFer'd to come 
Board, ! told him, he fliould not be concern'd a 
it at ali, for I would ftay on Shore. I only defir' 
he would take Care and fend me all my neceflar 
Things on Shore, and leave me a fufficient Sum c 
Money, and I would find my Way to England, a 
well as I could. 

Th 



[2*1 ] 

This was a heavy Piece of News to my Nephewj 
bin there was no Way to help it, but to comply 
with it : So, in (hort, be went on Board the Ship 
again, and fatisty'd the Men, that his Uncle had 
yielded to their Importunity, and had fent for his 
Goods from on Board the Ship •, fo the Matter was 
over in a very few Hours, the Men returned to their 
Duty, and I began to confidet what Courfe I fhould 
fleer. 

I was now alone in the remoteft Part of the 
World, as I think I may call it •, for I was near three 
thoufand Leagues by Sea farther off from England^ 
than I was ai my liland ^ only it is true, I might 
travel here by Land over the Great Mogul's Conn- 
try to Suratte^ migh go from thence to Bafora by 
Sea, up the Gulph of P^r/^, and from thence might 
rake the Way of Caravans, over the Defarrs of 
Arabia to Aleppo and Scanderoon ^ from thence by 
Sea again into Italy^ and fo over Land into France^ 
and this put together might be at leaft a full Diame- 
ter of the Globe 5 but if it were to be meaiur'd, I 
fuppofe it would appear to be a great deal more. 

1 had another Way before me, which v;as to 
wait for fome ErtgUfi Ships, which were coming 
to Bevgale from Achin on the Klind of Sumatra^ 
and get PafDge on Board them for Eftglardi But 
as I came hither without any Concern with the En- 
^ly/) Eaji-India Company, foit would be difficult ro 
go from hence without rbeir Licen((!;, unlels with 
great Favour of the Captains of the Ships, or of 
the Companies Fa£lors, and to both, 1 was an utter 
Stranger. 

Here I had the particular Pleafure, fpeaking by 
Contraries, to fee the Ship fet Sail uithout me ^ a 
Ire.tment 1 shink a Man in my Grcumltances 
fcarce ever met with, except from Pirates running 
away i*^ith a Ship, an * fettii/g thofe that would not 
agree with their Villauy, on Shore : Indeed this 
was next Door to it, both Ways ^ however, my 
O 2 Nephew 



[ 211 1 

Nepl^ew left me two Servants, or rather, one Com- 
panion, and one Servant, the firft was Clerk to the 
f urfer, who he engagg'd to go with me, and the 
other was his own Servant •, I took me alfo a good 
Lodging in the Houfe of an EngUJI) Woman, where 
feveral Merchants lodg'd , fome French^ two Itali- 
ans^ or rather Jews^ and one EftgUJh Man : Here I 
was handfomely enough entertained 5 and that I 
might not be faid to run rafhly upon any Thing, I 
ftay'd here above nine Months, confidering what 
Courfe to take, and how to manage myfelf, I had 
fome EngUJI) Goods with me of Value, and a confi- 
derable Sum of Money, my Nephew furnifliing me 
with a thoufand Pieces of Eight, and a Letter of 
Credit for more, if I had Occafion, that I might 
not be flraiten'd whatever might happen. 

I quickly difpos'd of* my Goods, and to Advan- 
tage too ^ and, as I originally intended, I brought 
here fome very good Diamonds, which, of all 
other Things, was the mod proper for me, in my 
Circumftances, becaufe I might always carry my 
whole Eftate about me. 

After a long Stay here, and many Propofals made 
for my return to Eiighnd^ but none falling out to 
my Mind, the EngUJI) Merchant who lodged with 
me, and with whom I had contrafted an intimate 
Acquaintance, came to me one Morning : Country- 
man, fays he, I have a Projeft to communicate ro 
you, which, as it fuits with my Thoughts, may for 
ought I know, fuit with your's alfo, when you fliall 
have thoroughly confidered it. 

Here we are polled, fayshe^ you by Accident, and 
I by my own Choice^ in a Part of the World very 
remote from our own Country ^ but it is in a Coun- 
try, where, by us who underftood Trade and Buli- 
n^tsy a great deal of Money is to be got : If you 
will put a thoufand Pound to my thouland Pound, 
we will hire a Ship here, the firft we can get to our 
Minds y you (hall be Captain, HI be Merchant, 

and 



[ 213 ] 

and we will go a Trading Voyage to China -^ ht 
what (hould we ftand ftill for } The whole World 
.is in Motion, rouling round and round j all the 
Creatures of God, heavenly Bodies and earthly, are 
bufy and diligent, Why fhould we be idle ? There 
are no Drones, fay$ h^ livlrtg in the World but Men^ 
Why (hould we be of that Number > 

I iik'd his Propofal ¥ery well, and the more, be- 
caufe it feem'd to be expiefs'd with fo much good 
Will, and in fo friendly a Manner : I will not fay, 
but that I might by my loofe and unhing'd Circum- 
ftances be the fitter to embrace a Propofal for Trade^ 
and indeed for any Thing elfe 5 or, other wife. 
Trade was none of my Element : However, I mighe 
perhaps fay with f3me Truth, that if Trade was 
not my Element, Rambling was ^ and no Propofal 
for feeing any Part of the World which ! had nevei 
feen before, could poffibly come amifs to me. 

It w^as however, fome time before we could get a 
Ship to our Minds 5 and when we had got a VefTel, 
it was not eaiy to get Englljh Sailors ^ that is to fay, 
fo many as were necefljry to govern the Voyage, 
and manage the Sailors which we fhouid pick up 
there ; After fome time we got a Mate, a Boar-» 
fwair?, and a Gunner, EngliJI) 5 a Butch Carpenter, 
and three Fortugueze Fore^maft Men 5 with thele we 
found, we could do well enough, having Indian 
Sea men, fuch as they are, to make up. 

There are fo many Travellers, who have wrote 
the Hiilory of their Voyages and Travels this Way, 
that it would be very little DiverSon to any Body^ 
to give a long Account of the Places we went 10^ 
and the People who inhabit there : Thofe Things I 
leave to others, and refer the Reader to thofe Journ* 
als and Travels of EngUJb Men, of which, many I 
find are publifli'd, and more promis'd every Day | 
'tis enough to me to tell you, that we made the 
Voyage to Achi7t, in the Ifland of Sumatra firff^ 
and from whence to Shm^ where we exchanged fome 

,0a ot 



[ 214 1 

of our Wares for Opium, and for fome Arrack, the 
firft, a Comodiry which bears a great Price among 
the Ch'inefe^ and which at that Time, was very much j 
warned there 5 in a Word, we went up to Smkan^ f 
made a very great Voyage ^ was eight Months out, 
and returned to Bengale^ and 1 was very well fatif- 
fy'd with my Adventure ; I obferve that cur People 
in Ergland^ often admire how the Officers which 
thf < :omp^:ny fend into Ltdia^ and the Merchants 
which generally ftay there, get fuch very great E- 
Itates as they do, and fometiiTies corrie Home worih 
6o, to 70 and 100 thoufind Pound at a Time. 

But it is no Wonder, or at leaf! we fhali fee fo 
much farther into it, when we coniider the innume- 
rable Ports and Places where they have a free Com- 
merce, that it will then be no Wonder ; ard much 
lels will it be fb, when we confider, that at all ihofe 
Places and Pons where the Ev^UJI) Ships come, 
there is fo much, and Inch conltant Demand for 
the Growth of all other Couniries, that there is a 
certain Vent for the Returns, ^s well as a Market 
abroad, for the Goods canied out. 

In fhort, we made a very good Voyage, ard I got 
lb much Money by the hrft Adventure, and fuch an 
Infight into the Method of getting more, that had 
I been twenty Year ycun^^er, 1 fhould have been 
tempted to have Itaid here and fought no farther, 
for maidrg try Fortbne 5 but what was all this, to 
a Man on the wrong Side of threefcore ? That was 
ii;,b enough, and csme abroad more in Obedience to 
a reftlefe Defire of feeing the World, than a cove- 
tuous Defire of getting in it •, and indeed I think, 
'tis Vvitb great Jultice, that I now call it a reftlefe 
Defire, for it was fo •, when I was at home, 1 was 
leftiefs to go abroad \ and now I was abroad 
I was reftlels to be at Home : / fay^ what 
was this gain to me ? 1 was rich enough already, 
nor had I any uneafy Defires about getting more 
Money ^ and therefore, the Profits of the Voyage 

to 



[ 215 ] 

to me, were Things of no great Force, for the 
prompting me forward to farther Undertakings 5 
Hence I thought, that by this Voyage, 1 had made 
no Progrefs at all ^ becaufe I was come back as I 
might call ir, to the Place from whence I C3me, as 
to a Home ; whereas^ my Eye, which like that, 
which Solomon fpeaks of, v^as never fatisfied with 
Seeing^ was ftill more defirous of Wand'ring and 
Seeing 5 1 was come into a Part of the World, which 
I was never in before *, and that Part in particular, 
which I had heard much of ^ and was refolv'd to 
lee as much of it as I could ^ and then I thought, I 
might fay, I had feen all the World, that was worth 
feeing. 

But my Fellow Traveller and I, had diiFerent 
Notions I I do not name this, to infift upon my 
own, for I acknowledge his was the moft juft and 
the moft fuited to the end of a Merchants Life | 
who, when he is abroad upon Adventures, 'tis his 
Wifdom to ftick to that, as the beft Thing for him, 
which he is like to get the moft Money by : My 
new Friend kept himfelf to the Nature of the 
Thing, and would have been content to have gone 
like a Carrier's Horfe, always to the fame Inn, back- 
ward and forward-, provided he could, as he call'd 
it, fnd his Account in it ^ on the other Hand, mine 
as old as I was^ was the Notion of a mad ramb- 
ling Boy^ that never cares to fee a Thing twice 
over. 

But this was not all ^ I had a Kind of Impatience 
upon me to be nearer Home, and yet, the moft un- 
fettled Refolution immaginable, which Way to go 5 
in the Interval of thefe Confultations, my Friend, 
who was always upon the Search for Bufinefs, pro. 
pos'd another Voyage to me, (viz,) among th| 
^pice Iflandsj and to bring Home a Loading of 
Cloves from the Manillas^ or tliereabouts ^ Places 
where indeed tht Dutch do Trade, but the Iflands, be- 
longing partly to the Sganiards j thg' m went not fo 

Q4 .f^h 



[ 2,n 
far, but to fome other, where they have not th§| 
whole Power as they have at Batavia^ Ceylon^ Uc,\ 
We were not long in preparing for ihis Voyage 5 
the chief Difficulty was in bringing me to come in- 
to it ^ however, at laft nothing eife offering, and 
finding that really ftirring about and Trading, thq 
Profit being fo great, and as I may fay cercain, had! 
more Pleafure in it, and more Sansfaftion to the 
M^nd, than fitting ft ill, which to me efpcdally^ wa§i 
the unh-^pp'^eft Part of Life : I refolvM on this Voy- 
age too, which we made very fuccelsfuHy, touching 
at Borneo^ and feveral Ifljnds, v^hofe Names I do 
not remember, and came Home in about five 
Months 5 we fold our Sp'ce, which was chiefly 
Cloves, and f^me Nutmegs, to the l-erjiun Merch- 
ants, who carried them away for the Gulph ^ and ! 
making near five of one, we really got a great deal 
of Money. 

My Friend, when we made up this Acccunt 
fmil'd ac me ♦, well now, faid he, with a forr of 
agreeable infult upon my indolent Temper ^ is not 
this better than walking about here, like a Man uf 
mthhj^ to Jp, and fpending our Time in ftar*ng at 
the Nonfenfe and Ignorance of the Pagans > Why 
truly, fays 1 my Friend, I think it is ^ and I begin 
to be a Convert to the Principles of Merchandizing-, 
but I mutt tell you, faid 1, by the Way, you do 
iiot know what ! am a doing, for if once I conquer, 
my backwardnefs, and imbark neartily ; as old as I 
am, I [hall harrafs you up and down me World, 'till 
I tire you ^ for I fhall purfue it fo eagerly, I (h^ll 
Kever let you lye ft ill. 

But to be fhort with my Speculations, a little 
while after this, there came in a Dutch Ship from 
Eatavia ^ (he was a Coafier, not an European Trader, 
and of about two hundred Tun Burthen : The Men, 
(fis they pretended hmng been fo fiekly, that the Cap- 
tain had not Men enough to go to Sea with ^ he lay 
by at BiTJgal, and as if having got Money enough, 

-■.'-.• or 



[ 217 ] 

or being willing for other Reafons, to go for Europe^ 
he gave puoLck Notice, that he would fell his Ship : 
This came to my Ears before my new Partner heard 
of it 5 and. I had a great Mind to buy it, io I goes 
Home to him, and told him of it ^ he confiders a 
while, for he was nor.^lhMan neither ; but mufing 
fome Time, he reply'd, fhe is a little to big, but 
however, we will have her : Accordingly we bought 
the Snip, and agreeing with the Mafter, we paid for 
her, and rook Pofltffion ; when we had done fo, 
we refolv'd to entertain the Men if we could, to 
join them with thofe we had, for the purluing our 
Bufinefs ^ but on a fudden, they having received 
not their Wages, but their fhare of the Money, as 
we afterwards learnt, not one of them was to he 
found : We enquir'd much about them, and at length 
were told, that they were all gone together by Land 
to Agra^ the great City of the MoguVs Refidence ^ 
and from thence were to travel to Siiratte^ and fo by 
Sea, to the Gulph of Perfia, 

Nothing had fo heartily troubled me a good 

while 5 as that I mifs'd the Opportunity of going 

with them y for fuch a Ramble I thought, and in 

fuch Company as would both have guarded me, and 

diverted me, would have fuited mightily with my 

great Defign ^ and I fhould both have feen the 

World, and gone homewards too ^ but I was much 

better fatisfied a few Days after, when I came to 

jsnow what lort of Fellows they were •, for infiort^ 

their Hiftory was, that this Man they call'd Captain 

was the Gunner only, not the Commander^ that 

they had been a Trading Voyage, in which, they 

were attacked on Shore, by fome of the Mallayans^ 

who had kill'd the Captain and three of his Men ^ 

and that after the Captain was kilFd, thefe Men, 

Eleven in Number, had refolv'd to run away with 

the Ship, which they did ^ and had brought her in 

9t the Bay oiBejtgale^ leaving the Mate and five Men 

inors on Shore, of whom, we (hall hear farther. 

- ■ Weil 



[ 2i8 3 

Well, let them come by the Ship how they would, 
we came honefily by her, m we thought ^ tho' we 
did not, / confefs examine into Things fo exaftly as 
we ought, for we never enquired any Thing of the 
Seamen j who, if we had examin'd, would certain- 
ly have faulter'd in their Accounts, contradi£led 
one another, and perhaps contradifled themfelves ^ 
or one how or other, we fhould have feen Reafon 
to have fufpeSed them ; but the Man fhew'd us a 
Bill of Sale for the Ship, to one Emanuel Clofterfio" 
ven, or fome fuch Name ^ for I fuppofe it was all 
a Forgery, and call'd himfelf by that Name, and 
we could not contradift him 5 and being withal, a 
Ettle too unwary, or at leaft, having no Sulpicion of 
the Thing, we went thro' with our Bargain, 

We pick'd up fome more Erglip Seamen here af- 
ter this, and fome Dutch ; and now we refolved for 
a lecond Voyage, to th^ South Eaft for Cloves, 8^c 
that is to fay, among the Philippine and MoUucco 
Ifles 5 and in Oiott, not to fill this Part of my Story 
with Trifles, when what is yet to come, is fo re- 
markable 5 1 fpent from firft to laft, fix Years in 
this Country, trading from Port to Port, backward 
and forward, and with very good Succefs 5 and was 
now the laft Year with my Partner, going in the 
Ship above-mention'd, on a Voyage to China j but 
deiigning firft to Siam to buy Rice. 

In this Voyage, being by contrary Winds oblgi'd 
to beat up and down a great while in the Straits of 
MaUacca^ and among the Iflands ^ we were no loon- 
er got clear of thofe difficult Seas, but we found 
cur Ship had fprung a Leak, and we were not able 
hy all our Induftry to find out where it was : This 
forc'd us to make for fome Port, and my Partner, 
who knew the Country better than I did, direfted 
the Captain to put into the River of Cambodia, for 
I had made the Erglifll Mate one Mr. Thomfon, Cap- 
tain^ not being wiUing to take the Charge of the Ship 

upon 



[ 219 1 

upon myfelf : This River lies on the North Side of 
the great Bay or Gulph, which goes up to Siam. 

While we were here, and going often on Shore 
for Refrefhment, there comes to me one Day an 
EftgUJI) Man, and he was it feems a Gunner's Mate, 
on board an Englijb Eaft-hdia Ship, which rode in 
the fame River, up at, or near the City of Cambo- 
dia ; what brought him hither we knew not 5 but 
he comes up to me, and fpeaking ETigUfi : Sir, fays 
he, you are a Scranger to me, and 1 to you •, but I 
have fomething to tell you, that very nearly con- 
cerns you 

I look'd fteadily at him a good while, and 
thought at fiift I had known him, but I did not ^ if 
it very nearly concerns me, faid I,, and not yc.urfelfi 
what moves you to tell it me > I am moved, fays he, 
by the eminent Danger you are in, and for ought I 
fee, you have no knowledge of it 5 I know no Dan- 
ger I am in, laid I, but that my Ship is leaky, and 
I cannot find it out j but I propofe to lay her a- 
Ground to Morrow, to fee if I can find it 5 hut Sir, 
fays he, leaky, or not leaky, find it, or not find it, 
you will be wifer than to lay your Ship on Shore to 
Morrow, when you hear what I have to fay to you ^ 
do you know Sir, laid he, the Town of Cambodia^ 
lyes about fifteen Leagues up this River ? and there 
are two large Englijh Ships about five Leagues on 
this Side, and three Dutch 5 vi^Wfaid J, and what is 
that to me > Why Sir, faid be^ is it for a Man that 
is upon fuch Adventures as you are upon, to come 
into a Port, and not examine fird what Ships there 
are there, and whether he is able to deal with them ? 
I fuppofe you don't think you are a Match for them^ 
I was amufed very much at his Difcourle, but not 
amaz'd at it, for I could not conceive what lie meant, 
and I turn'd fhort upon him and faid. Sir, I wifh 
you would explain yourfelf j I cannot imagine what 
Reafon I have to be afraid of any of the Company's 
Ships or Dutch Ships 5 I am no Interloper, what can 
they have to fay to me ? He 



[ 220 ] 

I^ look'd like a Man half angrv^, half pleas'd, 
and paufing a while, but fmiiing , well Sir, fays he^ 
if you think yourfelf fecure, you muft take your 
Chance i I am forty your Fate fhould blind you, 
againft good Advice 5 but aflure yourfelf if you do 
not put to Sea immediately, you will the very next 
Tide be attacked by five Long- Boats full of Men, 
and perhaps if you are taken, you'll be hang'd for a 
Pirate, and the Particulars be examined afterwards : 
I thought Sir, added he, I fhould have met with a 
tetter Reception than this^ for doing you a Piece of 
Service of fuch Importance : lean never be ungrate- 
ful, faid J, for any Service or to any Man that of- 
fers me any Kindneft, but it is paft my Comprehen- 
fion laid I, what they fhould have fuch a Defign 
upon me for ^ however, fince you fay^ there is no 
Time to be lofi", and that there is fome villainous 
Defign in Hand againft me ^ Til go on board this 
Minute, and put to Sea immediately, if my Men 
can flop the leak, or if we can fwim without flop- 
ping it 5 But, Sir, faid I, fhail I go away ignorant 
of the Reafon of all this ? Can you give me no far- 
ther Light into it > 

i can tell you but Part of the Story, Sir, fays he, 
but I have a Dutch Seamen here with me, and I be- 
lieve I could purfuade him to tell you the reft ; but 
there is fcarce time for it. But the fhort of the 
Story is this, the firft Part of which, I fuppofe, you 
know well enough, (viz.) that you was with this 
Ship at Sumxtra ^ that there your Captain was mur- 
ther'd by the MaUayans^ with three of his Men ; 
and that you, or fome of thofe who were on Board 
with you, ran aw.nr with the Ship, aad are fince 
turned PIRATES'^ t is is the Sum of the Story, 
and you will be all fei2:'d as Pirates F can afTure you; 
and executed with very little Cert -nony 5 t^r you 
know. Merchants Ships fhew but litle Law to Pz-^ 
vates^ if they get them in their Power. 

Now 



[ S2I ] 

Now you fpeak plain EyjgJifi^ faid I, and I thank 
you ^ and tho' I know nothing, that we have done, 
like what you talk of, but am fure we came honeft- 
ly and fairly by the Ship, yet feeing fuch Work is a 
doing as you fay, and that you feem to mean honeft- 
ly, ni he upon my Guard 5 nay, Sir, fays he, do 
not talk of being upon your Guard ^ the beft De- 
fence is to be our of the Danger 5 if you hav€ any 
Regard to your Life, and the Life of all your Men^ 
put out to Sea without fail at High Water, and as 
you have a whole Tide before you, you will be gone 
too far out before they can come down, for they 
will come away at High Water ^ and as they have 
twenty Miles to come, you get near two Hours of 
them, by the DifFtrence of the Tide, not reckoning 
the length of the Way 5 befides, as they are only 
Boats, and not Ships, they will not venture to follow 
you far out to Sea, efpecially if it blows, 

Wd]^fays /, you have been very kind in this, what 
fhall I do to you, for make yoti amends > Sir, fays 
he, you may not be fo willing to make me any 
amends, becaufe you may not be conviiic'd of the 
Truth of it : I'll make an offer to you ^ I have nine- 
teen Months Pay due to me, on board the Ship— — 
which I came out oi England in, and the Dutch 
Man that is with me, has feven Months Pay due to 
him 5 if you will make good our Pay to us, we will 
go along with you -, if you find nothing more in it, 
we will defire no more •, but if we do convince yon, 
that we have fav'd your Lives, and the Ship, and 
the Lives of all the Men in her, we will leave ths 
reft to you. 

I confented to this readily, and went immediately 
on board, and the two Men with me 5 as foon as I 
came to the Ship Side, my Partner who was on 
board, came out on the Quarter-Deck, and call'd 
to me with a great deal of Joy, ho ! ho I we 
have flopped the leak ! we have ftopp^'d the leak ! Sa^ 
you fo, faid /, thank God 5 but weigh the Anchor 

then 



C 222 ] 

then immediately \ Weigh ! Sa) he : What do you 
mean by that ? What is the Matter, fays he > Ask 
no QueRions fays /, but all Hands to work, and 
fpeighy without loofirig a Minute : He was furpriz'd, 
but however, he call'd the Captain, and he immedi- 
ately ordered the Anchor to be got up •, and tho' 
the Tide was not quite done, yet a little Land 
Breeze blowing, we Itood out to Sea ^ then I call'd 
him into the Cabin and told him the Story at large, 
and we calFd in the Men, and they told us the reft 
of it 5 but as it took us up a great deal of Time, 
fo before we had done, a Sea-man comes to the Ca- 
bin Door, and calls out to us, that the Captain bad 
him tell us, we were chas'd ^ ch2is'd fays J, by who, 
and by what? By five Sloops or Boats, fays the 
Fellow, full of Men ; very well, faid /, then it is 
apparent there is fomething in it ^ in the next Place 
I ordered all our Men to be call'd up, and told 
them, that there was a Defign to feize the Ship, 
and to take us for Pirates, and ask'd them, if they 
would ftand hy us, and by one another § the Men 
anfwered chearfully, that one and all, they would 
live and die with us : Then 1 ask'd the Captain, 
what Way he thought beft for us to manage a 
Fight with them ; for refift them I refolved we 
would, and that to the laft drop; he faid readily. 
That the Way was to keep them off with our great 
Shot, as long as we could, and then to fire at them 
with our fmall Arms to keep them from boarding 
us 5 but when neither of thele would do any long- 
er, we fhouJd retire to our clofe Quarters ; perhaps 
they had not Materials to break open our Bulk- 
Heads, or get in upon us. 

The Gunner had in the mean Time Order, to 
bring two Guns to bear fore and aft, out of tha 
Steerage, to clear the Deck, and loaded them with 
Mufquit-Bullets and fmall Pieces of old Iron, and 
what next came to Hand, and thus we made ready 
for Fight J but all this while we kept out to Sea» 

with 



[ 223 ] 

with Wind enough ^ and could fee the Boats at a 
Diltance, being 6ve large Long-Boats^ following u% 
with all the fail they could make. 

Two of thefe Boats, which by our Glaffes we 
could fee were Englijh, had out failed the reft, were 
near two Leagues a Head of then}, and gain'd upon 
us confiderably •, fo that we found they would come 
up with us I upon which, we fired a Gun without 
a Shot, to intimate, that they fhould bring too, 
and we put out a Flag of Truce, as a Signal for 
Parley -, but they kept crowding after us, 'till they 
came within Shot : Upon this we took in our white 
Flag, they having made no Anfwer to it, hung out 
a red Flag, and fired at them with a Shot : Not- 
withftanding this, they came on, 'till they were 
near enough to call to them with a fpeaking Trum- 
pet, which we had on Board ^ fo we call'd to them^ 
and bid them keep oflf at their Peril. 

It was all one, they crowded after us, and endea- 
voured to come under our Stern, fo to board us on 
our Quarter ^ upon which, feeing they were refb- 
lute for Mifchief, and depended upon the ftrength 
that followed them, I ordered to bring the Ship too, 
fo that they lay upon our Broad-fide, when immedi- 
ately we fir'd five Guns at them •, one of which^ 
had been levelled fo true, as to carry away the Stern 
of the hindermoft Boat, and bring them to the Ne- 
ceffity of taking down their Sail, and running all to 
the Head of the Boat to keep her from fifjking 5 fo 
Ihe lay by, and had enough of it ^ but feeing the 
foremoft Boat crowd on after us, we made ready to 
fire at her in particular. 

While this was doing, one of the three Boats 
that was behind, being forwarder than the other 
two, made up to the Boat which we had difabled, to 
relieve her, and we could afterwards fee her take 
out the Men •, He calfd again to the foremoft Boat^ 
and ofFerM a Truce to parley again, and to know 
What was her Bufinefs with us 1 hm had no Anfwer,

only (he crowded clofe under our Stern ; upon thii 
our Gunner, who was a very dexterous Fellow, run 
out his two Chafe-Guns and fired again at her 5 
but the fhot miffing, the Men in the Boat lliouted, 
wav'd their Caps, and came on ^ but the Gunner 
getting quickly ready again, fir'd among them the 
fecond Time ; one Shot of which, tho' it mifs'd 
the Boat itfelfj yet iell in among the Men, and we 
could eafily fee, had done a great deal of Mifchief 
among them ^ but we taking no notice of that, 
war'd the Ship again, and brought onr Quarter to 
bear upon them ^ and firing three Guns more, we 
found the Boat was fplit almoft to Pieces •, in parti- 
cular, her Rudder, and a Piece of her Stern was 
(hot quite away, fo they handed their Sail immedi- 
ately, and were in great Diforder ^ but to compleat 
their Misfortune, our Gunner let fly two Guns at 
them again •, where he hit them we could not tell^ 
but we found the Boat was finking, and fome of the 
Men already in the Water 5 upon this, I immedi- 
ately man'd out our Pinnace, which we had kept 
dole by our Side, with Orders to pick up fome of 
the Men if they could and fave them from drown- 
ing, and immediately to come on board with them v 
becaufe we faw the reft of the Boats began to come 
up ^ our Men in the Pinnace followed their Orders, 
and took up three Men 5 one of which, was juft 
drowning, and it was a good while before we could 
recover him 5 as foon as they were on Board, we 
crouded all the Sail we coold make, and flood far- 
ther out to Sea, and we found that when the other 
three Boats came up to the firit two, they gave over 
their Chace 

Being thus deliver'd from a Danger, which tho' 
I knew not the Reafon of ir, yet feem'd to be much 
greater than I apprehended 5 I took care that we 
would change our Courfe, and not let any one ima- 
gine whither we were going ^ fo we ftood out to 
Sea Eaftward, quite out of the Courle of all Evro- 

pean 



[ 225 3 

pean Ships, whether they were bound to China^ or 
any where elfe, within the Comnnerce of the Eitro- 
pean Nations. 

When we were now at Sea, we began to conl'jlt 

with the two Seamen,^ and enquire firft what the 

meaning of all this (liould be, and the Dutch Man 

let us into the fecrec of it at once ^ telling us that 

the Fellow that fold us the Ship, as wefaid^ was no 

more than a Thief, that had run away with her; 

Then he told us, how the Captain, whofe Name 

too he told us, tho' I do not remember it now, was 

treacheroufly murthered by the Natives on the 

Coaft of MaUaca^ with three of his Men, and that 

he, this Dutch Man, and four more got into the 

Woods, where they wandred abruc a great while 5 

'till at length, he in particular, in a miraculous 

manner made his Efcape, and fwam off to a Dutch 

Ship, which failing near the Shore, in its Way from 

China^ had fent their Boat on Shore for frefli Watetj 

that he durft not come to that Part of the Shore 

where the Boat was, hot made (hift in the Night, 

to take into the Water farther, oft and fwimrning a 

great while, at hit the Ship's Boat took him up. 

He then told us, that he ¥:Qt\i to Battavia^ where 
two of the Sci-men belonging to ?he Ship arriv'd, 
' having deferted' the reft in their Travels, and gave an 
Account that the Fell cvv who had run away with 
the Ship, fold her at Bengak, to a Set of Pirates,- 
which were gone a Cruifmg in her , and that they 
ihad already taken an E^igUp Ship and two Dutch 
Ships very richly laden. 
I This later Part, we found to concern us direftly, 
^ and tho' we knew it to be falle j yet as my Partner 
; faid very well, if we had falkn into their Hands^ 
and they had had fuch a Prepofirion again us before- 
hand, it had been in vain for uS to have defended 
ourfelves, or to hope for any good Quarters at their 
Hands ; efpeclally confidering that our Accufers had 
been our Judges, and that we could have expefted 
P nothing 



[ 226 ] 

nothing from them, but what Rage would have di- 
lated, and ungoverned Paffion have executed 5 and 
therefore it was his Opinion, we fliould go direflly 
back to Bengale^ from whence we came, without 
putting in at any Port whatever •, becaufe there, we 
could give a good Account of ourfelves, and could 
prove where we were when the Ship put in, who 
we bought her of, and the like ^ and which was 
more than ail the reft, if we were put to the Ne-ii 
cefiity of bringing it before the proper Judges, we 
fhould be fure to have fome Juftice, and not be 
hang'd firft, and judg'd afterward. 

I was fometime of my Partner's Opinion 5 butj 
after a little more ferious thinking, I told him, 1 1 
thought it was a very great Hazard for us toattempti 
returning to Bejjgale^ for that we were on the wrong 
lide of the Straits of Malacca ^ and that if the A- 1 
larm was given, we (hould be fure to be Way-laid j 
on every fide, as well by xh^Butch of Battavia^ as the 
EngliJI) elfe-where^ that if we fhould betaken, a: 
it were, running away, we (hould even condemi 
ourfelves, and there would want no more Evidence 
to deftroy us •, I alfo asked the EngUfi Sailor's Opini- 
on, who iaid, he was of my Mind, and that w^ 
fliould certainly be taken. 

This Danger, a little ftartled my Partner and al 
the Ship's Company •, and we immediately refolvec i 
to go away , to the Coaft of Tbw^z/fw,and fo on to Chi 
9ta^ and from thence purfuing the firft Defign as t( 
Trade, find fome Way or other to difpofe of th( 
Ship, and come back in fome of the VefTels of tb 
Country, fuch as we could get : This was approvec 
of as the beft Method for our Security ^ and accord 
ingly we fleered away N. N. E. keeping above fiftj 
Leagues off from the ufual Courfe to the Eaftward. 

This however put us to fome Inconveniences y fo 
firft the Winds, when we came to that Diftano 
from the Shore, feem'd to be more fteadily againl 
us, blowing almoft Trade, <^ we call it, from th^ 



[ 227 ] 

Eaft, and E N. E. fo that we were a long while 
upon our Voyage, and we were but ill provided 
with Vi£luals for fo long a Run ^ and which was 
ftill worfe, there was fome Danger that thofe Englijh 
and Dutch Ships, whofe Boats purfu^ed us, whereof 
fome were bound that Way, might be got in before 
us ^ and if not, fome other Ship, bound to China^ 
might have Information of us from them, and pur- 
fue us with the fame Vigour. 

I muft confefs, I was now very uneafy, and 
thought mylelf, including the late Efcape from the 
Long-Boats, to have been in the moft dangerous 
Condition that ever I was in, thro' all my paftLife^ 
for whatever ill Circumitances I had been in, I was 
never purfu'd for a Thief before •, nor had I ever 
done any Thing that merited the Name of Diflioneft 
or Fraudulent, much lefs ThieviOi : I had chiefly- 
been my own Enemy, or as I may rightly fay, I had 
been no Body's Enemy but my own : But now I 
was embarrafs'd in the worft Condition immagina- 
ble •, for tho' 1 was perfeftiy innocent, I was in no 
Condition to make that Innocence appear : And if 
1 had been taken it had been under a fuppofed guilt 
of the worft Kind ; at leaft, a Crime efteem'd fo 
amovig the People 1 had to do with. 

This made me very anxious to make an Efcape, 
tho', which Vl^ay to do it, I knew not ^ or what 
Port or Place we fhoold go to : My Partner feeing 
me thus dejefted, tho' he was the moft concerned at 
firft, began to encourage me •, und defcribing to me 
the feveral Ports of that Coall, told me he would 
put in, on the Coaft of Ckochinchina, or the Bay 
of Tonqjiin 5 intending to go afterwards to Macao^ 
a Town once in the PofleOion of the tortiigiieze^ and 
where ftill a great many European Families refided, 
and particularly the miiiionary Prlefts uluaOy went 
thither, in order to their going forward to China, 

Hither then we refoiv'd to go ^ and accordingly, 

tho' after a tedious and irregular Courfe, and very 

P 2 much 



[ 228 ] 

much ftraited for ProvISons, we came within Sight 
of the Coaft very early in the Morning • and upon 
Refleflion upon the paft Circumftances we were in, 
and the Danger if we had not efcaped, we refolv'd 
to put into a fmall River, which, however had a 
Depth enough of Water for us, and to fee if we 
could, either over Land, or by the Ship's Pinnace, 
come to know what Ships were in any Port therea- 
bouts. This happy Step, was indeed our Delive- 
rance J for tho' we did not immediately fee any Eu- 
sropean Ships in the Bay of Tonqiiin^ yet the next 
Morning, there came into the Bay two Dutch Ships, 
and a third without any Colours fpread out,but which 
we believ'd to be a Dutch Man, pafs'd by at about 
two Leagues Diftance, fleering for the Coaft oiChU 
7ta 5 and in the Afternoon went by two EngliJI) Ships 
fleering the fame Courfe ^ and thus, we thought, 
we faw ourfelves befet with Enemies, both one Way 
or other. The Place we were in was Wild and Bar- 
barous, the People Thieves, even by Occupation or 
Profeffion ^ and tho' it is true, we bad not much to 
feek of them, and except getting a few Provifions, 
car'd not how little we had to do with them, yet it 
was with much Difficulty, that we kept ourfelves 
Jrom being infulted by them feveral Ways. 

We were in a fmall River of this Country, with- 
in a few Leagues of it's utmoft Limits Northward 5 
and by our Boat we coafted North-Eaft to the Point 
of Land, which opens the great Bay of Tonquhi 5 
and it was in this beating up along the Shore, that 
we difcover'd as above, that in a Word, we were 
furrounded with Enemies. The People we were 
among, were the moft barbarous of all the Inhabi- 
tants of the Coaft ^ having no Correfpondence with 
any other Nation, and dealing only in Filli, and 
Oil, and fuch gtofs Commodities ^ and it may be 
particularly feen, that they are, ds I /aid, the moft 
barbarous of any of the [nhabitant's ( viz. ) that 
among other Cuftoms they have this as one, (viz.) 

That 



C 225> ] 

That if any VefTel have the Misfortune to be Ship- 
u'reck'd upon their Coaft, they prefently make their 
Men all Prifoners, that is to fay Slaves 5 and it was 
not long before we found a fpice of their Kindnefs 
this Way, on the Qccafion following. 

I have obierved above^ that our Ship fprung a 
Leak at Sea, and that we could not find it out 5 and 
however, it happen'd, that as I have faid it was 
ftopp'd unexpeftedly in the happy Minute of our 
being to be feiz'd by the Dutch and EyigliJI) Ships in 
the Bay of Siam ^ yet as we did not find the Ship fo 
perfeftiy tight and found as wedefir'd, we refolv'd, 
while we were in this Place, to lay her on Shore, 
take out what heavy Things we had on Board, 
which were not many, and to wafh, and clean her 
Bottom; and, if polTibie, to find out where the 
Leaks were. 

Accordingly, having lightened the Ship, and 
brought all cur Guns, and other moveable Things to 
one fide, we try'd to bring her down, that we might 
come at her Bottom ^ for on fecond Thoughts, we 
did not care to lay her dry, a Ground, neither could 
we find out a proper Place for it. 

The Inhabitants, who had never been acquainted 
with fuch a fight, came wondering down the Shore, 
to look at us 5 and feeing the Ship lie down on one 
fide in fuch a manner, and heeling in towards the 
Shore ^ and not feeing our Men, who were at Work 
on her Bottom with Stages and with their Boats on 
the ofF-fide, they prefently concluded, that the Ship 
was caft away and lay fo very faft on the Ground. 

On this Suppofition, they came all about us in two 
or three Hours time, with ten or twelve large Boats, 
having fome of them eight, fome ten Men in a Boat, 
intending, no doubt, to have come on Board, and 
plundered the Ship 5 and if they had found us there^ 
fo have carry'd us away for Slaves to their King, or 
whatever they call him 5 for we knew nothings who 
was their Governour. 

P 3 Vihm 



[ 230 1 

When they came up to the Ship, and began to 
row round her, they difcover'd us all hard at Work, 
on the Out- fide of the Ship's bottom and fide, wafh- 
!ng, and graving, and flopping, as every feafaring 
Man knows how. 

They flood tor a while gazing at us, and we, 
who were a little furpriz'd, could not iuiagine 
what their Defign was -, but being wiUwg to he fure^ 
we rook this Opportunity, to get fome of us into 
the Ship, and others to hand down Arms and Am- 
munition to thofe that were at Work, to defend 
themlelves with if there fhould bs Occafion ; and it 
was no more than Need ^ far in lefs than a quarter 
of an Hour's Confulcation, the^ agreed, ir feems, 
that the Ship was really a Wieck, that we were all 
at Work endeavouring to fave her, or to fave our 
our Lives by the Help of our Boats^ and when we 
hand cur Arms into the Boats, they concluded, by 
that Motion, that we were endeavouring to fave 
fome of our Goods , upon this they took it for 
granted, we all belonged to them ^ and away they 
came DireQly upon our Men, as if it had been in a 
Line of Battle. 

Our Men, feeing fo many of them, began to be 
frighted ^ for we lay but in an ill Pofture to fight, 
and cry'd cut to us, to know what they fhould do : 
I immediatly call'd to the Men who work'd upon the 
Stages, to flip them down, and get up the fide into 
the Ship 5 and bad thofe in the Boat to row round 
and come on Board ; and thofe few of us, who wxre 
on Board, work'd with all the ftrength and hands we 
had, to bring the Ship to Rights 5 but however, 
neither the Men upon the Stages, or thofe in the 
Boats, could do as they were order'd, before the 
Cochinchinejfes were ^ipon them 5 and two of their 
Boats boarded our Long- Boat, and began to lay hold 
of the Men as their Prifoners. 

The firfl Man they laid hold of, was an Englijb- 
Seaman, a flout ftrong Fellow, who having a Mus- 
ket 



i 231 1 

ket in his Hand, never offer'd to fire it, but laid if- 
down in the Boat like a Fool, as Ithovght: But he 
iinderftood his Bufinefs better than I could teach him 
for he grappled the Pjgan, and dragg'd him b/ 
main Force, out of their own Boat i|ito ours 5 where, 
raking him by the two Ears, he beat his Head fo 
againft the Boat's Gunnel, that the Fellow dy'd in- 
ftantly in his Hands 5 and in the mean time, a Dutch 
Man, who flood next, took up the Musket, and 
with the But-end of it, fo laid about him, that he 
knock'd down fivQ of them, who attempted to en- 
ter the Boat J But this was doing little towards re- 
fitting thirty or forty Men, who fearlels, becaule ig- 
norant of their Danger, began to throw themfelves 
into the Long-Boar, where we had but fivQ Men in 
all to defend it : But one Accident gave our Men a 
compleat Viaory, which delerv'd our Laughter ra- 
ther than any Thing elfe, and that was this : 

Our Carpenter, being preparing to grave the Out- 
fide of the Ship, as well as to pay the Seams, where 
he had caulk'd her to flop the Leakes, had got two 
Kettles jufl: let down into the Boat 5 one fiD'd with 
boiling Pitch, and the other with Rofin, Tallow^ 
and Oil, and fuch Stuff, as the Ship- Wrights ufe for 
that Work 5 and the Man that tended the Carpenter^ 
had a great Iron Ladle in his Hand, with which he 
fupply'd the Men that were at Work with that hot 
Stuff ; two of the Enemies Men entred the Boat juft 
where this Fellow ftood, being in the Fore-ftieets ^ 
he immediately faluted them with a Ladle full of 
the Stuff, boiling hot, which fo burnt, and fcalded 
them, being half naked, that they roaf d out like 
two Bulls, and enrag'd with the Fire, leap'd both 
into the Sea : The Carpenter faw it, and cry'd out^ 
Well done, Jack^ give them fome more of it 5 when 
ftepping forward himfelf/ be takes one of their 
Mops, and dipping it in the Pitch^Pot, he and his 
Man threw it among them fo plentifully, that, in 
Ihort, of all the Men in three Boats^ there was not 



C 252 ] 

one that was not fcalded, and burnt u-itli it in a moft 
frightful pitiful Manner, and made fuch a Howling 
and Crying, that I never heard a worfe Noife, and 
indeed nothing like it •, for it is worth obferving, 
That tho' Pain Naturally makes all People ci y .ur, 
yet every Nation have a particular Way of Excla- 
mation, and make Noifes as different from one ano- 
ther, as their Speech ^ I cannot give the Noife, ihefe 
Creatures made, a better Name thin Howling, nor 
a Name more proper to the Tone of it ^ for I never 
heard any Thing more like the Noife of the Wolves, 
which as I have ftid. I he^rd hjwl in the Foreft on 
the Frf >niers of Languedoc, 

I eas never pleas'd with a ViQorv better in nw 
Life 5 not only as it was a perfe£l furprize to me, 
and that our Danger iva^ i:!vuinent before : But as 
we got thisViftory without any Blood fhecf, except 
of that Man the Fellow kilFd with his iik^hcd Hands, 
and which I was very much corcern'd at : for I was 
lick of killing fuch poor Savage Wretches, even 
tho'it was in my own Defence, knowing they came 
on Errands, which they thoughr jult, and knew no 
better ^ and that tho' it may be a ]\\ii Thing, becauie 
neceffary, for there is no nee ffary Wickednefs in 
Nature -, yet I thought it was a fad Life, when we 
muft be always oblig'd to be killing our Fellow- 
Creatures to preferve ourfelves, indeed I think fo 
ftill 'y and I would even now fulFer a great deal, ra- 
ther than I would take away the Life, even of the 
wroft Perfon injuring me : I believe aifo, all confide- 
ring People, who know the Value of Life, would be 
of my Opinion, if they entred ferioufly into the con- 
fideration of it. 

But to return to my Story •, all the while this was 
doing, my Partner and I, who managM the reft of 
the Men on Board, had with great Dexterity 
brought the Ship almolt to Rights 5 and having got- 
ten their Guns into their Places again, the Gunner 
call'd to me^ to bid our Boat get out of the Way, 
♦ for 



[ 233 ] 

for he would let fly among them. I rall'd back 
again to him, and bid him not offer to fire, for the 
Carpenter would do the Work without him ^ but 
bad h!m heat another Pitch-Kettle, which our Cook, 
who was on Board, took Care of: But the Enemy 
was fo tsrnfv'd with *l:at they had met with in 
their *fir^l Attack, t'- -^ they would not come on 
again j and fome e i .ntm that v^ete fattheft cff, fee- 
ing the Ship Iw'm, as it uere upright, begun, as 
we fuppofed, to fee their Miltake, and give over 
the En'vcrprize, fiiiding it was not as they expeSed : 
Thus we got clear of this merry Fight ^ and iiaving 
gotten fome Rice, and fome Roots, and Bread, 
with about fixteen good big Hogs on Board, two 
Days before ^ we lefolv'd to Itay here no longer, 
but go forward whatever came of it ^ for we made 
no Doubt but we fhould be furrounded the next Day 
with Rogues enough, perhaps more than our Pitch* 
Kettle would difpofe of for us. 

We therefore got all our Things onBoard the fame 
Evening, and the next Morning was ready to fail ; 
in the mean time, lying at an Anchor fome Diftance 
from t4ie Shore, we were not fo much concern'd, 
being now in a fighting Pofture, as well as in a fail- 
ing Pofture, if any Enemy had prefented : The next 
Day having finifhed our Work within Board, and 
finding our Ship was perfeftly heaPd of all her Leaks, 
we fet fail ^ we would have gone into the Bay of 
Tonquin-^ for we wanted to inform ourfelvesof what 
was to be known concerning the Dutch Ships that 
had been there, but we durft not ftand in there 5 
becaufe we had feen feveral Ships go in, as we fup- 
pos'd, but a little before j fo we kept on N. E. to- 
wards the Ifle of Formofa, as much afraid of being 
feen by a Dutch or EngJiJI? Merchant Ship, as a 
Dutch or Englifi Merchant Ship in the Mediteranean 
is of an Jigerzne Man of War. 

When we were thus got to Sea, we kept on N. E 
as if we would go to the 3ia7nIIas or the PhiUippme 

Iflands 



f 234 ]^ 

Iflands 5 and this we did that we might not fall irttc 
the Wav of any of the Eiivopean Ships \ and then 
we fteer'd North again, 'till we caroe to the Latitude 
of 22 Degrees, :o Minutes ^ by which means we 
made the Ifland Formofa direftly, where we came to 
an Anchor, in order to get Water, and frefh Provi- 
fionSj which the People there, who are very courte- 
ous and civil in their Manners, fupply'd us with 
willingly, and dealt very fairly and punftually with 
us in all their Agreements and Bargains ^ which is 
what we did not find among other People^ and may 
be owing to the Remains of Chriftianity, which 
was once Planted here by a Dutch Miflionary of Pro- 
teftants, and is a Teftimony of what I have often 
obferv'd, viz. That the Chriitian Religion always 
civilizes the People, and reforms their Manners, 
where it is receivM, whether in Works faving Ef- 
fefts upon them or no. 

From hence we fail'd ftill North, keeping the 
Coaft of China at an equal Diftance, 'till we knew j 
we were beyond all the Ports of China^ where out ' 
European Ships ufually come ^ being refolv'd, if pof 
fible, not to fall into any of their Hands, efpecially 
In this Country, where, as our Circumftances were, 
we could not fail of being entirely ruin'd 5 nay, fo 
great was my Fear in particular, as to my being ta- 
ken by them, that I believe firmly, I would much 
rather have chofen to fall into the Hands of the 
SpaniJI) Inquiption. 

Being now come to the Latitude of 50 Degrees^ 
we refolv'd to put into the firlt trading Port we 
fhould come at ^ and Handing in for the Shore, a 
Boat came off two Leagues to us, with an old For^ 
tttgueze Pilot on Board, who knowing us to be an 
European Ship, came to offer his Service, which in- 1 
deed we were very glad of, and took him on Board-,! 
upon which, without asking us whether we would 
go, he difmifs'd the Boat he came in^ and fent it 
back. 

I thought 



[ 235 ] 

I thought it was now lo much in our Choice, to 
nake the old Man carry us whither we would •, that 
began to talk with him about carrying us to the 
iulph of ISianqiiin^ which is the moft Northern 
'art of the Coaft of China : The old Man faid he 
[new the Gulph of Nanqitin very well ^ but Imiling, 
isk'd us what we would do there ? 

I told him, we would fell our Cargo, and pur- 
:hafe C/;7w^. Wares, Callicoes, Raw-Silks, Tea, 
iVrought-Silks, ^c. and fo would return by the fame 
3ourfe we came : He told us our belt Port had 
)een to nave put in at Macao^ where we could not 
have fail'd of a Market for our Opium, to our Sa- 
dsfaftion, and might for our Money have purchased 
all Sorts of Cifw^i-Goods, as cheap as we could at 
Nanqidn, 

Not being able to put the old Man out of his 
Talk, of which he was very opiniated, or conceited, 
I told him, we were Gentlemen, as well as Merch- 
ants, and that we had a Mind to go and fee the 
great City of PechiJig, and the famous Court of the 
Monarch of China, Why then, fays the old Man, 
you fliould go to Ningyo^ where, by the River 
which runs into the Sea there, you may go up with- 
in five Leagues of the Great Canal, This Canal is a 
navigable made Stream, which goes thorow the 
Heart of that vaft Empire of China^ croffes all the 
Rivers, paffes fome confiderable Hills by the Help 
of Sluices and Gates, and goes up to the City of 
Tecllng, being in Length near 270 Leagues. 

Wei], faid I, Seignior Portugvefe^ but that is not 
our Bufinels now : The great Queftion is, if yoii 
can carry us up to the City of Nanquin^ from 
whence we can travel to Pecking afterwards } Yes, 
he faid, he could do ib very well, and that there was 
a great Butch Ship gone up that Way juft before. 
This gave me a little Shock ^ a Butch Ship was now 
our Terror, and we had much rather have met the 
Devil J at leaft, if he had not come in too fright- 
ful 



[ 236 1 

ful a Figure^ we depended upon it, that a Dutch 
Ship would be our Deftruftion, for we were in no 
Condition to fight them •, all the Ships they trade 
with into thofe Parts being of great Burthen, and 
of much greater Force than we were. 

The old Man found me a littte confus'd, and un- 
der fome Concern, vhen he nam'd a Dutch Ship, 
snd faid to me, Sir you need be under no Apprehen- 
fionsof the Dutch^ I fuppofe they are not now at War 
with your Nuion : No,' fays I, that's true 5 but t 
know not what Liberties Men may take when they 
are out of the Reach of the Laws of their own 
Country 5 Why, fays he, you are no Pirates^ what 
need you fear > They will not meddle with peacea- 
Me Merchants fure, 1 

If I had any Blood in my Body that did not % j 
tip into my Face at that Word, it was hinder'd by 
fome Stop in the Veflils, appointed by Nature to 
circulate it ^ for it put me into the greateft Difor- 
der and Confufion imaginable : Nor was it pofTihle 
for me to conceal it lo, but that the old Man eaSty 
perceivM it. '' 

Sir, fays he, 1 find you are in fome Diforder in 
your Thoughts at my talk, pray be pleased to go 
which Way you think fit, and depend upon it, lif 
do you all the Service I can. ¥/hy,' Seignior, faid 
I, it is true, [ am a little unfettled in my Refoluti- 
on at this Time, whither to go in particular ; and I 
am fomething more fo, for what you faid about P£- 
rates^ I hope there are no Pirates in thefe Seas ^ we 
are but in an ill Condition to meet with them, for ^ 
you fee we have but a fmall Force, and but very ' 
weakly mannM. 

O Sir, fays he^^ do not be concern'd, I do not 
know that ;here has been any Pirates in thefe Seas 
thefe fifteen Years, except one which was feen, as I 
hear, in the Bay ofSiam^ about a Month fince ; but 
you may be afTured (he is gone to the Southward ^ 
Ror was fee a Ship of any great Force, or fit for 

the 



[ 257 1 

le Work •, (he was not built for a Privateer, but 
'as iiin away with by a Repribate Crew that were 
n Board, after the Captain and fbme of his Men 
ad been murther'd by the Malayans^ at or near 
:ie Ifland of Sumatra, 

What ] Said I, fiemlng to know nothing of the 
latter. Did they murther the Captain ? No^ /aid he^ 

do not underftand that they murther'd him-, but 
5 they afterwards run away with the Ship, it isge- 
erally believ'd they betray'd him into the Hands of 
iQ Malayans, who did murther him, and perhaps 
hey procur'd them to do it : Why then, /aid /, 
hey deferve Death as much as if they had done it 
hemfelves : Nay, fays the old Man^ they do deferve 
:, and they will certainly have it, if they light up- 
n any EngUJI) or Dutch Ship ^ for they have all a- 
reed together, that if they meet that Rogue, they 
viil give him no Quarter. 

But, faid I to him, you fay the Pirate is gone out 
f thefe Seas, how can they meet with him then ? 
Vhy, that is true, fays he, they do fay fo 5 but he 
vas, as! tell you, in the Bay of Siam, in the River 
•ambodia, and was difcover'd there by fome Dutch 
vlen who belonged to the Ship, and who were left 
)n Shore when they run away with her ^ and fome 
!%///; and Dutch Traders being in the River, they 
vere within a little of taking him : Nay, faid he^ 
I f the foremoft Boats had been well feconded by the 
eff, they had certainly taken him •, but he finding 
only two Boats within Reach of him, tack'd about, 
ind fir'd at thefe two, and difabled them, before the 
other came up, and then itanding off to Sea, the 
other were not able to follow him, and fo he got 
iway ; But they have all fo exaft a Defcriprion of 
the Ship, that they will be fure to know him -, and 
where-ever they find him, they have vow'd to give 
no Quarter to either the Captain, or the teamen, 
but to hang them all up at the Yard- Arm. 

What! 



[ 238 1 

What ! fays I, will they execute them right or 
wrong, hang them firft, and judge them afterwards? 
O Sir ! fays the old Pilot, there's no Need to make 
a formal Bufinefs of it with fuch Rogues as thole, i 
let them ty^ them Back to Back, and fet them a div-| 
ing •, 'tis no more than they richly delerve. 

I knew I had my old Man fait aboard, and that 
he could do me no Harm, fo that I turn'd fhort up- 
on him : Well now, Seignior, faid I, and this is 
the very Reafon, why I would have you carry us up 
to NanqiiiTt^ and not to put back to Macao^ or to 
any other Part of the Country, where the EngliJI) or 
Dutch Ships come ^ for be it known to you, Seigni- 
or, thofe Captains of the EngliJI) and Dutch Ships, 
are a Parcel of rafh, proud, infolent Fellows, that 
neither knows what belongs to Juftice, nor how I 
to behave themfelves, as the Laws of God and Na- 
ture direft ^ but being proud of their Offices, and 
not underftanding their Power, they would agb the 
Murtherers to punifli Robbers ^ would take uponji 
them to InfultMen falflyaccufed,and determine them 
guilty without due Enquiry 5 and perhaps I may 
live to call fome of them to an Account for it, 
where they may be taught how Juftice is to be exe- 
cuted, and that no Man ought to be treated as a 
Criminal, 'till fome Evidence may be had of the 
Crime, and that he is the Man. 

With this I told him, that this was the very Ship 
they attack'd, and gave him a full Account of the 
Skirmifh we had with their Boats, and how fool- 
iflily and coward-Iike they behav'd. I told him all 
the Story of our buying the Ship, and how the 
Dutch Men ferved us. I told him the: ReafonsI had 
to believe that this Story of killing the Matter by 
the Malayans was true ^ as alio "he running away 
with the Ship ^ but that it was all a Fiftion of their 
own, to fuggeft that the Men were turn'd Firates ^ 
and they ought to have been fure it was fo, before 
they had ventured to attack us by Surprize, and 

* oblige 



• C 239 ] 

©bilge us to refift them -, adding that they would 
have the Blood of thofe Men, who we kill'd there 
in our juft Defence, to anfwer for. 

The old Man was amaz'd at this Relation, and 
told us, we were very much in the Right to go away 
to the North, and that if he might advile us, it 
fhould be to fell the Ship in China, which we might 
very well do, and buy or build another in the 
Country ^ and, faid he, tho' you will not get fo 
good a Ship, yet you may get one able enough to 
carry you and all your Goods back again to Ben- 
gale, or any where elfe. 

I told him, I would take his Advice, when I 
came to any Port where I could find a Ship for my 
Turn, or get any Cuftomer to buy this : He reply'd, 
I fhould meet with Cuftomers enough for the Ship 
at Nanqiiin, and that a Chhiefe Jurk would lerve 
me very well to go back again -, and that he would 
procure me People, both to buy one, and fell the 
other. 

Well, but SeigmoT^ fays I, as you fay they know 
the Ship fo well, I may perhaps, if I follow your 
Meafures, be inifrumentai to bring fome honeft in- 
nocent Men into a terriHe Broil, and perhaps to be 
murther'd in cold Blood ^ for wherever they find the 
Ship, they will prove the Guilt upon the Men^ hy 
proving this was the Ship, and fo innocent Men 
may probably be overpowered and murther'd : Why, 
fays the old Man, ill find out a Way to prevent 
that alfo ^ for as I know all thofe Commanders you 
fpeak of very well, and (hall fee them all as they 
pafs by, 1 will be fore to*fet them to Rights in the 
Thing, and let them know that they had been fo 
much in the Wrong ^ that tho' the People, who 
were on board at firff, might run away with the Ship, 
yet it was not true that they had turned Pirates ^ 
and that in particular, thefe were not the Men that 
firft went oiF with the Ship, but innocently bought 
her for their Trade 5 and I am purfuaded they will fo 

far 



[ 240 ] 

far believe tne, as at leaft to afl: more tautioufly for 
the Time to come. Well, fays /, and will you de- 
lii^er one Meffage to them from me ? Yes, I will, 
fays he^ if you will give it under your Hand in Writ- 
ing, that I may be able to prove it came from you, 
and not out of my own Head. I anfwered, That I 
would readily give it him under my Hand ^ fo I 
took a Pen, and Ink, and Paper, and wrote at large 
the Story of aflaulting me with the Long Boats, 
i!fc. the pretended Reafonof it, and the unjult cruel 
Defign of it ; and concluded to the Commanders, 
that they had done what they not only fhould have 
been afham'd of, but alio, that if ever they came to 
England^ and I liv'd to fee them there, they fhould 
all pay dearly for it, if the Laws of my Country 
were not grown out of life before I arriv'd there. 

My old Pilot read this over and over again, and 
ask'd me feveral Times if I would ftand to it ? I an- 
fwer'd, I would ftand to it as long as I had any 
Thing left in the Word, being fenfible that I fhould 
one Time or other find an Opportunity to put ii 
home to them : But we had no Occafion ever to let 
the Pilot carry this Letter 5 for he never went back 
again : While thofe Things were pacing between us^ 
by Way of Dilcourfe, we went forward, direftly 
for Nanqiiin^ and in about thirteen Days Sail camei 
to an Anchor at the South Weft Point of the great 
Gulph of Nanquin, where, by the Way, I came by 
Accident to underftand, the two Dutch Ships were 
gone that length before me, and that I fhould cer- 
tainly fall into their Hands 5 I confulted my Partner 
again in this Exigency, and he was as much at a 
Lofs as I was, and would very gladly have been fafe 
on Shore almoft any where ^ however, I was not in 
fuch Perplexity neither, but I ask'd the old Pilot, 
if there was no Creek or Harbour, which I might 
put into, and purfue my Bufinefs with the Chinefe 
privately, and be in no Danger of the Enemy : He 
told me if I would fail to the Southward about two 

and 



C 241 3 

and forty Leagues, there was a little Port call'd 
^linchavg^ where the Fathers of the Miffion ufual- 
ly landed from Macao^ on their Progrefs to teach the 
Chriftian Religion to the Chinefes, and where no 
European Ships ever put in •, and if I thought to put 
in there, I might confider what farther Courfe to 
take when 1 was on Shore : He confefs'd, he faid, 
it was not a Place for Merchants, except that at 
fome certain Times, they had a kind of a Fair there, 
when the Merchants from Japan came over thither 
to buy ihQChi7iefe Merchandizes. 

We all agreed to go back to this Place -, the 
Name of the Port, as he cali'd it, I m,ay perhaps 
fpell wrong ^ for 1 do not particularly remember it, 
having lolt this, together with the Names of many 
other Places, ki down in a little Pccket-Book, which 
was fpoil'd by the Water, on an Accident, which I 
(hall relate in its Order ^ but this I remember, that 
the Chinefe^ or Japov.efe Merch ints we correfponded 
with, call'd it by a differing Naoie from that which 
our Portugyeze Pilot gave ir, and pronounc'd it as 
above, ^dnchavg. 

As we were Unanimous in our RefoUuions, to go 
to this Place, we weighed the next l)ay, having 
only gone twice on Shore, where we were to get 
frefh Water 5 on both which Occaiions, the People 
of the Country were very civil to us, and brought 
us abundance of Things to fell to m ^ Jjneart^ of 
Frovijwm^ Plants, Roots, Tea, Rice, and lotneFowls^ 
but nothing without Money. 

We came to the other Port, (^the Wind being con- 
trary) not 'till five Days, but it was very much to 
our Satisia£tlon 5 and i was joyful, and i may fay, 
thankful, when I fet my Foot fafe on Shore 5 re- 
folving, and my Partner too, that if it was poffible 
to difpofe of ourfelves and EfFecls, any other Way, 
tho' not every Way to our Satisfafllon, we would 
never fet one Foot on board that unhappy VeiTel 
more:, and indeed I muft acknowledge, that of all

the Circumftances of Life, that ever I had any Ex- 
perience of, nothing makes Mankind fo complearly 
miferableas that, of being in conftant Fear: Well 
does the Scripture lay, the Fear of Man brings a 
Snare •, it is a Life of Death, and the Mind is fo 
entirely fupprefs'd by it, that it is capable of no 
Relief^ the animal Spirits fink and all the Vigour 
of Nature, which ufually fupports Men under 
other Affliflions, and is prelent to them in the great- 
eft Exigencies, fails them here. 

Nor did it fail of it's ulual Operations upon the 
Fancy, by heightening every Danger, reprefenting 
the Englijl) and Dutch Captains, to be Men uncapa- 
ble of hearing Reafon, or of diftinsuixhing between 
honeft Men and Rogues ^ or between a Srory calcu^ 
lated for our own Turn, made out of nothing, on 
Purpofe to deceive ^ and a true genuine Account oi 
our whole Voyage, Progrefs, and Defign ^ fci we 
ftiight many Ways have convinc'd any reafonabk 
Creature, that we were not Pirates 5 the Goods wc 
had on board, the Courfe we fteer'd, our frankly 
fhewing ourfelves, and entring into fuch and fuc! 
Ports 5 even our very Manner, the Force we hac 
the Number of Men, the few Arms, little Ammu 
nition, fhort Provifions ^ all thefe would have leiv'c 
to convince any Men, that we were no Pirates ^ the 
Opium, and other Goods we had on board, would 
make it appear the Ship had been at Bengale ; the 
Dutch Men, who it was faid, had the Names of al 
the Men that was in the Ship, might eafily iee thai 
we were a Mixture of EngUJI), Porttigueze, and Lidi 
ans^ and but two Dutch Men on board : Thefe, and 
many other particular Circumftances, might have 
made it evident to the Underftanding of any Com- 
mandefj whofe Hands we might fall into, that va 
were no Pirates. 

But Fear, that blind ufelefs Paflion, ivork'd ano- 
ther Way, and threw us into the Vapours ^ it be 
wildred our Underftandings, and fet the Imaginatior

Work, to form a thoufand terrible Things, that 
rhaps might never happen ^ we fiTi\ fuppos'd, as 
leed every Body had related to us, that the Sea- 
zn on board the EngliJI) and Butch Ships, bat 
Decially the Dutch^ were fo enraged at the Name 
a Pirate, and efpecially at our bearing of their 
>ars, and efcaping, that they vvould not give 
smlelves leave to enquire, whether we were Pi- 
:es or no ^ but would execute us off Hand, as we 
11 it, without giving us any Room for a Defence j 
J reflefled that there was really fo much apparent 
idence before them, that they would fcarce en- 
iire after any more ^ as firlt. That the Ship was 
rtainly the fame, and that fome of the Seamen 
long tbem knew her, and had been on board her^ 
i fecondly, That when we had intelligence at the 
ver of Cambodia^ that they were coming down to 
imine us, we fought their Boat and fled 5 fo that 
made no doubt but they were as fully fatisfy'd 
our being Pirates, as we were fatisfy'd of the 
itrary ^ and as i often fa id, I know not but I 
)uld have been apt to have taken thefe Circum* 
nces for Evidence, if the Tables were turn'd, and 
' Cafe was theirs, and have made no Scruple of 
ting all the Crew to Pieces, without believing., 
perhaps confidering, what they might have to 
er in their Defence. 

But let that be how it will, thofe were our Ap- 
iihenfions ^ and both my Partner and I too, fcarce 
be a Night, without dreaming of Halters, and 
irdArms^ that is to fay, Gibbets, of fighting, 
;i being taken 5 of killing, and being kill'd 5 and

;^ng the Dutch Men had boarded us, and I was

Sleep, but I was once afraid I fhould have loft two 
of my Fingers. 

Another Apprehenfion I had, was of the cruel 
llfage we might meet with from them, if we fell 
into their Hands •, then the Story of Ainboyna camt 
into my Head, and how the Diitch^ might perhapi 
torture us, as they did our Country- men there •, anc 
make fome of our Men by extremity of Torture 
confefs thofe Crimes they never were guilty of \ 
own themfelves, and all of us to be Pirates, and f 
they would put us to Death, with a formal Appeal 
ance of Juftice 5 and that they might be tempre 
to do this, for the Gain of our Ship and Cargc 
which was worth four or five thoufand Pound, pt' 
altogether. 

Thefe Things tormented me and my Partner to* 
Night and Day ^ nor did we conlider that the Ca; 
tains of Ships have no Authority to aQ thus ^ art 
if we had furrender'd Prifoners to them, they coul' 
not anfwer the delhoying us, or torturing us, b' 
would be accountable for it, when they came 
their own Country : This 1 fay, gave me no Satisf , 
aioflj for if they will aft thus with us, what Aj 
vantage would it be to us, that they would 
cali'd to an /Account for it; or if we were firft 
be murthered, what SatisfaSion would it be to l 
to have them punifli'd when they came Home > 

I cannot retrain taking Notice here, what Refi 
aions I now had upon the palt Variety of my pc 
ticular Circumitances 5 how hard I thought it w; 
that 1 who had fpent forty Years in a Life of con 
nu'd Difficulties, and was at laft come as it were 
the Port of Haven, which all Men drive at, {vt 
to have Reft and Plenty, (hould be a Voluntier 
new Sorrows^ by my own unhappy Choice j a| 
that I3 who had efcaped fo many Dangers in r 
Youth, ftiould now come to be hang'd in my c 
Age, and in fo remote a Place, for a Crime 1 wii 
not in the leaft inclin'd to, much lefs guilty c; 



[ 245 ] 

and in a Place and Circumftance, where Innccenc® 
was not like to be any Proteftion at all to me. 

After thefe Tiioughrs, fbmething of Religion 
would come in ^ and I (hould be confidering, that 
this feem'd to me to be a Difpoficion of immediate 
Providence, and I ought to look upon it, and fub- 
mk to it as fuch ^ that although 1 was innocent as 
to Men, I was far from being innocent as to my 
Maker •, and I ought to look in and examine, what 
Dther Crimes in my Life, were molt obvious to mej 
md for which, Providence might juftly inflift this 
Punifhment, as a Retribution , and that I ought to 
fubmit to this, jult as I would to a Ship- wreck, if 
c had pleafed God to have brought foch a Difafter 
ipon me. 

In its Turn, Natural Courage would fometimes 
ake it's Place •, and then I would be talking myfelf 
]p to vigorous Refolutions, that I would not be ta- 
ien, to be barbaroufly ufed hy a Parcel of mercy- 
efs Wretches, in cold Blood ; that it were much 
)etter to have fallen into the Hand of the Savages, 
vbo were Man- Eaters, and who, i was fure, would 
eaft upon me, when they they had taken me ^ than 
)y thcic, who x^ould perhaps glut their Rage upon 
ne, by inhuman Tortures and Barbarities •, that 
n the Cafe of the Savages, I always refolv'd to die 
ighting, to the iaft Gafp, and why Ihould I not 
lo fo now, feeing it was much more dreadful to me 
It leaft^ to think of falling into thefe Mens Hands, 
"ban ever it was to think of being eaten by Men ; 
'or the Savages, give them their due, would not eat 
I Man 'rill he was dead, and kill'd them firft, as 
^e do a Bullock ^ but that thefe Men had many 
flrts beyond the Cruelty of Death : When ever thefe 
rhoughts prevail'd, I was iijre to put myfelf in a 
iind of Fever, with the Agitations of a fuppofed 
Fight ^ iny Blood would boil, and my Eyes fparkle, 
IS if I was engag'd ^ and I always refolv'd that I 
would take no Quarter at their Hands ^ but eyen at 
a ^ Iaft, 



[ 24^ ] 

laft, if I could refill no longer, I would blow up 
the Ship and ail that was in her, and leave them but' ' 
little Booty to boaft of k 

By how much the greater Weight, the Anxieties" 
and Perplexities of tliefe Things were to our 
Thoughts while we were at Sea, by fo much thel 
greater was our Satisfaflion, when we faw ourfelves' 
on Shore 5 and my Partner told me he dteam'd, 
that he had a veiy heavy Load upon his Back, which 
he was to carry up a Hill, and found that he was 
not able to ftand long under it ^ but that the For- 
tiiguexe Pilot came and took it off his Back, sr^^ 
the Hill difappear'd, the Ground before him Ifiew- 
!ng all fmooth and plain, and truly it was fo, we 
were all like Men, who had a Load taken off theii 
Backs. 

For my Part, I had a Weight taken off from my 
Heart, that I was not able any longer to bear ; 
and as I faid above, we refolv'd to go no more to 
Sea in that Ship : When we came on Shore, the old 
Pilot, who was new our Friend, got us a Lodging 
and a Ware-Houfe for our Goods, which by the 
Way, was much the hvn^ •, it was a little Houfe 01 
Hut, with a large Houfe joyning to it, all built with 
Canes, and palliladoed round with large Canes, tc 
keep out pilfering Thieves, of which, it feems 
there were not a it\M in that Country ^ however, xhi 
Magift rates allowed us alfo a little Guard, and we 
had a Soldier with a kind of Halberd, or Half pike, 
who ftood Sentinel ac our Door ; to whom we al- 
low'd a Point of Rice, and a little Piece of Money 
about the V^lue of three Pence ;7^f Day, fo that oui 
Goods were kept very fafe. 

The Fair or Mart, ufually kept in this Place, had 
been over fome Time ^ however, we found that there 
were three or four Junks in the River, and two Ja- 
fanners ; I mean, Ships from Japayi, with Goods; 
which they had bought in China^ and were not gont 
away, having Janojiefc Merchants on Shore. 

Thcl 



[ 247 ^ 

The firft Thing our eld Portuguese Pilot did for 
us, was to bring us acquainted with three miffiona- 
ry RomiJJ) Priefts, who were in the Town, and who 
had been there Ibme Time, converting the People 
to Chrittianity • but we thought they made but 
poor Work of it, and made them but forty Chri- 
itians when they had done ^ however, that was 
none of our Bufinefs: One of thefe was a Fremh 
Man, who they call'd Father Simon \ he was a jolly 
well conditionM Man, very free in his Converfation, 
not feeming fo ferious and grave as the other two 
did ^ one of whom was a Fortugueze^ and the 
other a Genoefe-^ but Father Simon was courteous, 
ealy in his Manner, and very agreeable Company ^ 
the other two were more referv'd, feemM rigid and 
auftere, and apply'd ferioufly to the Work they 
came about, (viz.) to talk with, and infinuate 
themfelves among the Inhabitants, where- ever they 
had Opportunity ^ we ciren eat and drank with 
thofe Men, and tho' I mutt confefs, the Converfion 
^ they call it, of the Chivcfes to Chriliianity, is (b 
far from thQ true Converfion reqiiir'd, to bring Hea» 
then People to the Faith of ChriO", that it feems to 
amount to little more, than letting them know the 
Name of Chrilt, and fay fome Prayers to the Virg- 
in Mary, and her Son, in a Tongue which they un- 
derftand nor, and to crofs themfelves and the like j 
yet it mull be confefs'd that thefe Religious, who 
we call Miffionaries, have a firm Belief that thefe 
People (hall be fav'd, and that they are the Inftru- 
ments of it 5 and on this Account, they undergo 
not only the Fatigue of the Voyage, and Halyards 
of living in fuch Places^ but oftentimes Death it« 
felf, with the moft violent Tortures, for the Sake 
of this Work ^ and it would be a great want of 
Charity in us, whatever Opinion we have of the 
Work itfelf, and the Manner of their doing it, if 
we fhould not have a good Opinion of their Zeal, 
who undertake it with fo many Ha^^ards, and who 

Q 4 have 



L 248 3 

have no Profpe£t of the leaft Temporal Advantage 
to themfelves. 

But to return to my Story •, this FreTich Prieft Fa- 
ther Simon, was appointed it leems, by Order of 
the Chief of the Miffion, to go up to Pekivg^ the 
Royal Seat of the Chinefe Emperor, and waited on- 
ly for another Prieft, who was order'd to come to 
him from Macao^ to go along with him ♦, and we 
fcarceever met together, but he was inviiing me to 
go that Journey wirh him, telling me, how he 
would fhew me all the glorious Things of that 
mighty Empire ^ and among the reft, the greatelt 
City in the World •, a City, faid he, that your Lon-^ 
don and our Faris put together cannot be equal to : 
This was the City of Feldvg^ which f confefs is ve- 
ry great, and infinitely full of People •, but as I 
look'd on thofe Things with different Eyes from 
other Men, fo I fhall give my Opinion of them in 
few Words, when I come in the Conrfe of my Tra- 
vels, to fpeak more particularly of them. 

But firft, 1 come to ray Fryar or MifTionary j di- 
ning with him one Day, and being very merry to- 
gether, I (hew'd feme little Inclination to go with 
him, and he prefs'd me and iriy Partner very hard, 
and with a great many Perfwafions to confent ^ why 
Father Simon^ fays my Partner, why (hould you de- 
fire our Company fo much : You know we are He- 
reticks, and you do not love us, nor cannot keep us 
Company with any Pleafure > O ! fays he, you 
may perhaps be good Catholicks in Time^ my Bu- 
finefs here is to convert Heathens, and who knows 
but 1 may convert you too > Very well, Father faid 
I5 fo you will Preach to us all the Way •, I won't be 
troublefome to you, fays he^ our Religion does not 
diveft us of good Manners ; befides, fays he, we 
are here like Country-men, and fo we are, compa- 
red to the Place we are in ^ and if you are Hugo, 
nots, and I a Catholick, we may be all Chriftians 
at laft 5 at leaft, faid he^ we are all Gentlemen, 

and 



[ 249 ] 

and we may converfe fo, without being uneafy to 
one another. I lik'd that Part of his Difcourie ve- 
ry wel], and it began to put me in Mind of my 
Prieft, that I had left in the Brajils ; bur this Fa- 
ther Simon did nor come up to his Charafter, by a 
great deal 5 for tho' Father Simon had no appearance 
of a Criminal Levity in him neither, yet he had 
not that Fund of Chriftian Zeal, flrift Piety, and 
fincere AfFeftion to Religion, that my other good 
Ecclefiafticli had, of whom 1 have faid fo much. 

But to leave him a little, tho' he never left us, 
nor foliciting us to go with him ^ but we had fome- 
thing elfe before us at that time ^ for we had all 
this while our Ship, and our Merchandi5:e to dif- 
pofe of; and we began to be very 'doubtful what 
we (hould do, for we were now in a Place of very- 
little Bufinefs ^ and once I was about to venture to 
fail for the River ofKilam^ and the City of JS'anquin : 
But Providence feem'd now more vifible as I 
thought, than ever, to concern itfelf in our Affair^ 
and I was encouraged from this very Time, to 
think, I (hould one Way or other get out of this 
tangled Circumftance, and be brought Home to my 
own Country again, tho' I had not the leaft View 
of the Manner; And when I began fometimes to 
think of it, could not imagine by what Method ic 
was to be done^ Providence, I fay, began here to 
clear up our Way a little ^ and the firft Thing that 
offered was, that our old Portitgtieze Pilot brought a 
Japan Merchant to us, who began to enquire what 
Goods we had -, and in the firlt Place, he bought 
all our Opium, and gave us a very good Price for it 
paying us in Gold by Weight, fome in fmall Pieces, 
of their own Coin, and fome in fmall Wedges, of 
about ten or eleven Ounces each. While we were 
dealing with him for our Opium, ic came into my 
Head, that he might perhaps deal with us for the 
Ship too, and I ordered the Interpreter to propole 
it to him ^ he (hrunk up his Shoulders at it^ when 

It 



[ 250 ] 

it was firft propos'd to him ^ but in a few Days af- 
ter, he came to me with one of the miffionary 
Priefts for his interpreter, and told me, he had a 
Propofal to make ro me, and that was this j he had 
bought a great (ipanrir^ of Goods of us, when he 
had no ThoughtsCor Propof^is made to him) of buy- 
ing the Ship s and that therefore, he had not Mo- 
ney enough to pay for the Ship 5 but if I would 
let the fame Men who wee in the Ship navigate her, 
he would hire the Ship to go to J^fp'xn^ and would 
fend them from thence to the thilipphe Illands 
with another Loading, which he would pay the 
Treight of, before they went from Japan ^ and 
that at their Return he would buy the Ship : I be- 
gan to liften to his Propofal, and fo eager did my 
Head ftill run upon Rambling, that I could not but 
begin to entertain a Notion myfelf of going with 
him, and fo to fail from the Fhilipphie Iflands, away 
10 the South Seas ; and accordingly I askM th^ Ja- 
ponefe Merchant, if he would not hire us to the 
Thilippbte Iflands, and difcharge us there ; he faid, 
no he could not do that, for then he could not 
Mve the Return of his Cargo •, but he would dif- 
charge us m Japav^ he fiid, at the Ship's Return. 
Wei], ftill I was for taking him at that Propofal, 
and going myfelf^ but my Partner, wifer than my- 
felf, perfuaded me from it reprefenting the Dangers 
as well of the Seas, as of the Japoncjes^ who are a 
falfe, cruel, and treacherous People ^ and then of 
the Spaniards at the Philippines^ more falfe, more 
cruel, more treacherous than they» 

But to bring this long Turn of our Affairs to a 
a Conclufion -, the firft Thing we had to do, was to 
confult with the Captain of the Ship, and with his 
Men, and know if they were willing to go to jfn- 
fan • and while I was doing this, the young Man, 
who, as I faid, my Nephew had left with me as 
my Companion for my Travels, came to me, and 
told me. that he Though: that Voyage promifed 

very 



[ 2SI ] 

very fair, and that there was a great Profpetl of 
Advantage, and he would be very glad if I under- 
took it ^ but that if I would not, and would give 
him leave, he would go as a Merchant, or how I 
pleas'd to order hinfi 5 that if ever he came to Eng- 
land^ and I was there, and alive 5 he would render 
me a faithful Account of his Succefs, and it fhould 
be as much mine as I pleas'd. 

I was really loth to part with him, bur confider- 
ing the Profpea of Advantage which was really 
confiderable, and that he was a young Fellow, as 
likely to do well in it-, as any I knew, I inclined to 
let him go •, but firft ! told him, I would confult 
my Partner, and give him an Anfwer the next Day ; 
my Partner and I difcours'd about it, and my Part- 
ner made a moil generous Offer ; he told me, you 
know it has been an unlucky Ship, and we both re- 
folve not to go to Sea in it again ^ if your Steward^ 
fo he caWd my Man^ will venture the Voyage, Til 
leave my Share of the Veffel to him and lee him 
make hisbeft of it ^ and if we live to meet in Evg-^ 
land^ and he meets with Succefs abroad, he fhall ac- 
count for our Half of the Profirs of the Ship^'s 
Freight to us, the other fhall be his own. 

[f my Partner, who was no Way concerned with 
my young Man, made him fuch an Offer, I could 
do jio lefs than offer him the fame •, and all the 
Ship's Company being willing to go with him, we 
made over Half the Ship to him in Property, and 
took a Writing from him, obliging him to account 
for the other and away he went to Japan, The 
Japan Merchant prov'd a verv punftual honeft 
.Man to him, protected him at Japan^ and got him 
a Licenfe to come on Shore, which the Europeajis, 
in general have not lately obtained •, pjy'd him 
his Freight very punQually, fent him to the PhiUp- 
pinesy loaded with Japan and China Wares, and a 
Supra-Cargo of their own, who trafficking with 
the Spamards^ brought back European Goods again. 



[ 252 ] 

and a great Quantity of Cloves, and other Spice ? 
and there he was not only pay'd his Freight very 
well, and at a very good Pric<?, but being not wil- 
ling to fell the Ship then, the Merchant furnifh'd 
him with Goods, on his own Account^ that for 
ibme Money, and feme Spices of his own, which 
he Krought with him, he went b^ck to the Manillas^ 
to the Spaniards^ where he fold his Cargo very well •„ 
Here having gotten a good Acquaintance at Manilla^ 
he got his Ship made a free Ship -, and the Govern- 
our of Mamlld hired him, to go to Jccapulco^ in 
J inert ca^ on the Co a ft of Me:fico^ and gave him a 
Licenfe to Land there, and travel to Mexico^ and to 
pafs in any Spjn'ijl) Ship lo Europe^ with all his Men. 

He made the Vovage to Accapulco very happily, 
and there he fold his i:hip 5 and having there alfo 
abtained Allowance to travel by Land to Bono Bello^ 
he found Means fome how or other, to get to Ja- 
maica^ with all his Treafure ^ and about eight Years 
after, came to Eyighnd exceeding Rich: Df the 
the which, 1 (hall rake Notice in its Place •, in the 
mean Time, I return to our particular Affairs. 

\Being now to part with the Ship, and Ship's Com- 
pany ^ it came bef3re us of Courfe, to confider 
what Recompence we fiiould give to the two Men, 
that gave us fitch timely Notice of ttiQ Defign 
againlt us in the River of Cambodia : The Truth 
was, they had done us a confiderable Service, and 
deferv'^d well at our Hands 5 tho' by the JFay, they 
were a Couple of Rogues too ^ for as they believ'd 
the Story of our being Pirates, and that we had re- 
ally run away with the Ship, they came down to 
us, not only to betray the Defign that was form'd 
againft us, but to go to Sea with us as Pirates ^ and 
one of them confefs'd afterwards, that nothing 
elfe but the Hopes of going a Rouging, brought 
him to do it 5 however, the Service they did us 
vyas not the lefs ^ and therefore as I had promised 
to be grateful to them, I firft order'd the Money to 

be 



[ 253 V 

be pay'd to them, which they faid was due to them 
on board their refpeOive Ships •, that is to fay, the 
EngliJI) Man nineteen Months Pay, and to the I)«tc& 
Man feven *, and over and above that, I gave them, 
each of them, a fmall Sum of Money in Gold, 
and which contented them very well *, then I made 
the EvgVifl) Man Gunner in the Ship, the Gunner 
being now made Second Mate, and Purfer 5 * the 
Dtitch Man i made Boatfwain ^ fo they were both 
very well pleas'd, and prcv'd very ferviceable, be- 
ing both able Seamen, and very Itouc Fellows. 

We were now on Shore in Chhta ♦, if I thought 
myfelf banifliM, and remote from my own Country 
at Bevgale, where I had many Ways to get home for 
my Money-, what could I think of myfelf now ? 
When I was gotten about a thoufand Leagues far- 
ther off from Home, and perfeftly deliitute of all 
manner of ProfpeO: of Return. 

All we had for it was this, that in about four 
Months Time, there was to be another Fair at the 
Place where we were ^ and then we might be able 
to purchafe all ff:>rts of the Manufactures of the 
Country, and withal, might pofTibly find fome Chi- 
fiefe Jonks or Veflels from Tonquin , that would be 
to be lold, and would carry us and our Goods, whi- 
ther we pkas'd ^ this I lik'd very well, and refolv'd 
to wait 3 belides, as our particular Perfons were 
not obnoxious, fo if any EvgliJI? or Dutch Ships 
came thither, perhaps we might have an Opportu- 
nity to load our Goods, and get Paffage to fome 
other Place in India nearer Home. 

Upon thefe Hopes we refolv'd to continue here -, 
but to divert ourfelves, we took two or three jour- 
neys into the Country •, firft we went ten Days Jour- 
ney to fee the City of Nanqiiht^ and 3 City well 
worth feeing indeed ^ rhey fay it has a Million of 
People in it ^ which however, I do nor believe ^ ic 
is regularly built, the Streets all exaClly Itrair, and 
crofs one another, in direQ Lines^ which gives the 
Figure of it great Advantage, But 



[ 254 1 

But when I come to compare the miferable Peo- 
ple of thefe Countries with ours, their Fabricks, 
their manner of Living, their Government, their 
Religion, their Wealth, and their Glory, (as fome 
call it) I muft confefs, I do not fo much as think 
it is worth naming, or worth my while to write of, 
or any that fhall come after me to read. 

It ibvery obfervable that we wonder at the Gran- 
deur, the Riches, the Pomp, the Ceremonies, the 
Government, the ManufaSures, the Commerce, and 
the ConduQ: of thefe People 5 not that it is to be 
ivonder'd at, or indeed in the leaft to be regarded ^ 
but becaufe, having firft a true Notion of the Bar- 
barity of thofe Countries, the Rudenefs and the 
Ignorance that prevails there, we do not expeft to 
find any fuch things fo far oiF. 

Othertvile, what are their Buildings to the Pala- 
ces and Royal Buildings of Europe > What their 
Trade, to the univerfal Commerce of England^ Hoi- 
land:, Frajice and Spain} What their Cities to ours, 
for Wealth, Strength, Gaiety of i^pparel, rich 
Furniture, and an infinite Variety > What are their 
Ports, fupply'd with a kva Jonks and Barks, to our 
Navigation, our Merchants Fleets, cur large and 
powerful Navys ? our City of London has more 
Trade than all their mighty Empire : One EjjgliJI)^ 
or Diitch^ or French Man of War of 80 Guns, 
would fight with, and deftroy all the Shipping of 
Cbi7ia : But the Greatnefs of their Wealth, their 
Trade, the Power of their Government, and Strength 
of their Armies, is furprifing to us, becaufe, as I 
have faid, confidering them as a barbarous Nation 
of Pagans, little better than Savages, we did not 
expefl: fuch Things among them j and this indeed 
is the Advantage with which all their Greatnefs and 
Power is reprefented to us ^ otherwife it is in itfelf 
nothing at all 5 for as I have faid of their Ships, fo 
may be iaid of their Armies and Troops 5 all the 
Forces of their Empire, tho' they were to bring 

two 



[ 255 1 

two Millions of Men into the Field together, would 
be able to do nothing bai ruin the Country, and 
ftarve themfelves : If they were to befiege a Itrong 
Town in Flanders, or to fight a difciplin'd Army, 
one Line of German CuriafJjers, or of French Caval- 
ry, would overthrow all the Horfe of China ^ A Mil« 
lion of their Foot could not Hand before one embat- 
tled Body of our Infantry, pofted fo as not to be 
furf0unded,tho' they were not to be One to Twenty in 
Number-, nay, I do not boalt, if I fay that 30000 
German or EjigUfi Foot, and loooo French Horfe, 
would fairly beat all the Forces of China : And io 
of our fortified Towns, and of the Art of our En- 
gineers in affaulting and defending Towns •, there's 
not a fortified Town in China^ could hold out one 
Month againlt the Batteries and Attacks of an Eu- 
ropean Army ♦, and at the fame time all the Armies 
of China could never take fuch a Town as Dunkirk^ 
provided it was not ftarv'd •, no, not in a ten Years 
Siege. They have Fire-Arms, 'tis true, but they 
are awkward clumfy and uncertain in going off: 
They have Powder, but it is of no Strength : They 
have neither Difcipline in the Field, Exercife to 
their Arms, Skill to Attack, or Temper to Retreat j 
and therefore, 1 muft confeft, it feem'd ftrange to 
me, when I came home, and heard our People fay 
Inch fine Things of the Power, Riches, Glory, 
Magnificence, and Trsde of the Chinefe ^ becaufe I 
faw, and knew, that they were a contemptible Herd 
or Crowd of ignorant fordid Slaves, fubjefted to a 
Governmeiit qualified only to rule fuch a People ^ 
and in a word, for I am now launched quite befide 
my Defign, I fay, in a word, were not its Diitance 
inconceivahly great from Mufcovy, and v^as not the 
Miifcozite Empire almolt as rude^ impotent, and ill. 
governed a Crowd of Slaves as ihey, the C-Lar of 
Mufcovy might with moch Eafe drive them all out 
of their Country, and conquer them in one Cam- 
paign i and had the Czar, who i iince hear is a 

grow- 



[ 2S6 ] 

growing Prince, and begins to appear formidable in 
the World, fallen this Way, inftead of attacking the 
Warlike Swedes^ in which Attempt none of the 
Powers of Eitrcps would have envy'd or interrupted 
him-, he might by this time have been Emperor of 
China^ inftead of being beaten by the King of Sweden 
at Narva^ when the latter was not One to Six in 
Number. As their Strength and their Grandeur, 
fo their Navigation, Commerce, and Husbandry, is 
imperfefl and impotent, compared to the fame Things 
in Europe 5 alfo in their Knowledge, their Learning, 
their Skill in the Sciences j they have Globes and 
Spheres, and a Smatch of the Knowledge of the 
Mathemiticks •, but when you come to inquire into 
their Knowledge, how fhort-fighted are the uifeft 
of their Studients ! they know nothing of the Mo- 
tion of the Heavenly Bodies 5 and fo grofly abfurdly 
ignorant, that when the Sun is eclipsed, they think 
'tis a great Dragon has afTaulted and run away with 
it, and they fall a clattering with all the Drums 
and Kettles in the Country, to fright the Monftef 
away, jaft as we do to hive a Swarm of Bees. 

As this is the only Excurfion of this kind which 
I have made in all the Account I have given of my 
Travels, fo I fhall make no m.ore Defcriptions of 
Countrys and People,, 'tis none of my Bufjnefs, or 
any part of my Defign •, but giving an Account of 
my own Adventures, through a Life of inimitable 
Wandrings, and a long Variety of Changes, which 
perhaps few that come after me will have heard the 
like of the mighty Places, defart Country's, and nu- 
merous People, I have yet to pafs thro' more than re- 
lates to my own Story, and which my Concern among 
them will make neceflary. I was now, as near as I 
can compute, in the heart of China^ about the La- 
titude of thirty Degrees North of the Line, for we 
were return'd from Nanquin ^ I had indeed a mind to 
fee the City of Fekin^ which I had heard fo much of, 
and Father Simoft irnportun'd me daily to do it -, at 

length 



C 257 ] 

length his Time of going away being fet, and the o- 
ther Millionary, who was to go with hinn, being ar- 
rived from Macao^ it was neceffary that we fhould re- 
folve, either to go, or no to go^ fo I referr'd him to 
my Partner, and left it wholly to his Choice, who at 
length refolv'd it in the Affirmative, and we prepared 
for our Journey. We fet out with very good Advan- 
tage, as to finding the Way, for we got leave to travel 
in the Retinue of one of their Mandarins, a kind of 
Viceroy, or principal Magiftrate in the Province where 
they relide, and who take great State upon them, 
travelling with great Attendance, and with greaj: 
Homage from the People, who are fometimes great- 
ly impoveriOi'd by them, becaufe all the Countries 
they pais thro' are oblig'd to furniOi Provlfions for 
them and all their Attendance : That which I par- 
ticularly obferved, as to our travelling with his Bag- 
gage was this, that tho' v"»/e received fufficient Provl- 
fions, both for our felves and our Horfes, from the 
Country, as belonging to the Mandarin, ye we were 
pblig'd to pay for every thing we had, after the 
Market Price of the Country, and the Mandarin's 
Steward, or CommiiTary of the Provlfions, coUefted 
it duly from us ^ fo chat our travelling in the Re- 
tinue of the Mandarin, tho' it was a very great Kind- 
nefs to us, was not fuch a mighty Favour in hinr?, 
i)ut was indeed a great Advantage ro him, confider- 
ing there were about thirty other People travelled in 
the fanne Manner befides us, under the Proteftionof 
his Retinue, or as we may call it, under his Convoy : 
This, I fay, was a great Advancag;e to him, for the 
Country furnifh'd all the Provifions for nothing, and 
he took all our Money for them. 

We were five and twent}^ Days travelling to Peh'tj^^ 
through a Country ir finitely populous, but mifera- 
bly cultivated •, the Husbandry, the Oeconorny, and 
the Way of living, all very miferable, tho' they boalt 
fo much of the Induftry of the People 5 I fay, miie- 
table 5 and fo n is, if we who underftand how to 

R live 



C 258 1 

live were to endure it, or to compare it with oiir 
own, but not lo to thefe poor Wretches who know 
no other; The Pride of thefe People is infinitely 
great, and exceeded by nothing, but their Poverty, 
which adds to that which I call their Mifery. I muft 
needs think the naked Savages of America live much 
more happy, becaufe, as they have nothing, fo they 
defire nothing*, whereas thefe are proud and infolenr, 
and in the main are meer Beggars and Drudges ^ 
their Oftentation is inexpreifible, and is chiefly 
fhew'd in their Cloaths and Buildings, and in the 
keeping Multitudes of Servants or Slaves, and, which 
is to the laft Degree ridciilous, their Contempt of 
all the World but themfelves. 

I muft confefs, I ttavell'd more pleafantly after- 
wards in the Defarts and vaft Wildernefles of Grand 
Tartary^ than here 5 and yet the Roads here are well 
pavM, and well kept, and very convenient for Tra- 
vellers ^ but nothing was more aukward to me, than 
to fee fuch a haughty, imperious, infolent People, 
in the midft of the grofeft Simplicity and Ignorance, 
for all their fam'd Ingenuity is no more : My Friend 
Father Simon and I us'd to be very merry upon thefe 
Occafions, to fee the beggarly Pride of thofe People •, 
for Example: Coming by the Houfe of a Country 
Gentleman, as Father Simon call'd him, about ten 
Leagues off of the City ofNanqiiin, we had firft of 
ail the Honour to ride with the Mailer of the Houfe, 
about two Miles : The State he rode in, was a per-^ 
feft Don ^lixotifmj being a mixture of Pomp and 
Poverty. 

The Habit of this greafy Don was very proper 
for a Scaramouch, or Merry-Andrew, being a dirry 
Callicoe, with all the Tawdry Trappings of a Foofs- 
Coar, Ibch as Hanging Sieves, Toffels, and Cuts and 
Slafhes almoit on every Sule^ it cover'd a Taffny 
Velt, as greafy as a Butcher, and which teflify'd, 
that his Honour mult needs be a molt exquifite 
Slovea 

His 



[ 255> ] 

His Horfe was a poor^ lean, ftarvM, hobbling Crea- 
ture, fuch as in Efighnd might fell for about 30 or 
4c Shillings, and he had two Slaves followed him 
on Foot, to drive the poor Creature along ^ he had a 
Whip in his Hand, and he belabour'd the Beaft as 
faft about the Head, as his Slaves did about the Tail j 
and thus he rode by us with about ten or twelve Ser- 
vants, and we were told he was going from the City 
to his Country Sear, about half a League before mt 
We travel rd on gently, but this Figure of a Gentle- 
man rode away before us, and as we Itop'd at a Vil- 
lage about an Hour to refrefh us, when we came by 
the Country Seat of this great Man, we faw him in 
a little Place, before his Door, eating his Repaft j 
it was a kind of a Garden, but he was eafy to be 
feen, and we were given to underftand that the more 
we look'd on him, the better he would be pleas'd. 

He fat under a Tree, fomething like the Palmet- 
to Tree, which efFe£lually fhaded him over the Head^ 
and on the South Side^ bur under the Tree alfo, was 
plac'd a large Umbrella, which made that Part look 
well enough 5 he fat lolling back in a great Elbow- 
Chair, being a heavy corpulent Man, and his Meat 
being brought him by two Women Slaves 5 he had 
two more, whofe Office, I think, few Gentlemen ia 
Europe would accept of their Service in, {viz,) One 
fed the Squire with a Spoon, and the other held the 
Difh with one Hand, and fcrap'd off what he let fall 
upon his Worfiiip's Beard and Taffaty Vefl, with the 
other ^ while the great fat Brute thought it below 
him to employ his own Hands in any of thofe fami- 
liar Offices, which Kings and Monarchs would ra- 
ther do, than be troubled with the clumfy Fingers 
of their Servants. 

I took this Time to think what Pain Mens Pride 
puts them to^ and how troiiblefome a haughty 
Temper, thus ill-managed, mult be to a Mao of 
Common Senfe •, and leaving the poor Wretch to 
pleafe himfelf with our looking at hlni^ as if iH^e

admir'dhis Pomp, whereas we really pity'dand con- 
temned him, we purfu'd our Journey 5 only Father Si^ 
monh^id the Curiofitytoftay to inform him feif what 
Dainties the Country Juftice had to feed on, in all his 
State 5 which hefaid he had the Honour to tafte of^ 
and which was, I think, aDofe that an Evglifi Hound 
would fcarce have eaten, if it had been ofFer'd him, 
Ct^iz.)a Mefs of boiFdRice, with a great piece cf Gar- 
lick in it, and a little Bag fiil'd with Green Pepper, and 
another Plant which they have there, fomething like 
our Ginger but fmelling like Musk, and tafting like 
Muftard ^ all this was put together, and a fmall 
Lump or Piece of lean Mutton boil'd in it 5 and 
this was his Worfliip's Repaft, four or Bvq Servants 
more attending at a Diftance. If he fed them 
meaner than he was fed himfelf, the Spice except- 
ed, they muft fare very coarfely indeed. 

As for our Mandarin, with whom we travelled, 
he was refpe£led like a King; furrounded always 
with his Gentlemen, and attended in all his Ap- 
pearances with fuch Pomp, that I faw little of 
liim but at a Diftance 5 but this I obferv'd, that 
there was not a Horfe in his Retinue, but that our 
Carriers Pack-Horles in England feem to me to look 
much better, but they were fo cover'd with Equi- 
page, Mantles, Trappicgs and fuch like Trumpery, 
that you cannot fee whether they are fat or lean 5 
in a Word, we could fee fcarce any thing but their 
Feet and their Heads. 

I was now light- hearted, and all my Trouble and 
Perplexity that I have given an Account of being 
over, I had no Anxious Thoughts about me, which 
made this Journey much the pleafanter to me 5 nor 
had I any ill Accident attended me, only in the paf- 
fing or fording a fmall River, my Horfe fell, and 
made me free of the Country, as they call it •, that 
is tofay^ threw me in j the Place was not deep, but 
it wetted me all over ^ I mention it becaufe it fpoil'd 
my Pocket-Bookj wherein 1 had fee down the Names 

of 



[ 2^1 ] 

of feveral People and Places which I had Occafion 
CO remember, and which, not taking due Care of, 
the Leaves rotted, and the Words were never after 
to be read, to my great Lofs, as to the Names of 
feme places which I touched at in this Voyage. 

At length we arriv'd at Pekivg y I had no Body 
with me but the Youth, who my Nephew, the 
Captain, had given me to attend me as a Servant, 
and who proved very trufty and diligent 5 and my 
Partner had no Body with him but one Servant, who 
was a Kinfman : As for the Portugiteze Pilot, he 
being defirous to fee the Court, we gave him. his 
Paflage, that is to fay, bore his Charges, for his 
Company 5 and to ufe him as an interpreter, for he 
underftood the Language of the Country, and fpoke 
good French^ and a little ErigliJJj ^ and indeed, this 
old fvlan was a moft ufefui Impliment to us every 
•where ^ for we had not been above a Week at Fe- 
Ung^ when he came laughing, Ah^ Seigmor Inglife, 
fays he, / have fomething to tell you will make your 
Heart glad. My Heart ghd, fays!, JFh at can that be? 
I dont know any thing in this Country can either give 
me Joy or Grief to any great Degree, Tes^ yes^ fa id 
the old Man in broken Englifi^ malie you glad^me 
fovYow ^ forry he would have faid. This made me 
more inquifitive. Jfhy^ laid f, will it make you forry > 
Becaufe^ faid he, you have brought me here 2$ days 
y.omney^ and will leave me to go back ahne^ and which 
way fly^U I get to my Fvrt afterwards without a Ship^ 
without a Hovfe^ without Pecune ? So he called Mo- 
ney, being his broken Latin^ of which he had 2- 
bundance to make us merry with. 

In fhort, he told us there was a great Caravan of 
Mufcovite and Falifl) Merchants in the City, and 
they were preparing to fet out on their Journey by 
Land to Mufcovy vvithin four or five Weeks, and he 
was furewe would take the Opportunity to go \mih 
them, and leave him behind to go back all alone % 
I conkfsj I was furpris'd with his News 5 a fscrct 



1262} 

Joy fpread itfelf over my whole Soul, which I can^ 
not defcribe, and never felt before or fince, and I 
had no power for a good while to fpeak a Word to 
the old Man ; but at laft I turned to him ^ How do 
you know this, laid I, are you fure it is true > Yes, 
lays he, I met this Morning in the Street an old 
Acquaintance of mine, an Armenian^ or one you 
call a Grecian^ who is among them, he came laft 
from Jjlracan^ and was defigning to go to Tonquiv^ 
where I formerly knew him, but has alter'd his mind, 
and is now refolv'd to go with the Caravan to Ahf- 
coWf and f ) down the River of Jf^ulha to Aftracan, 
Well, Seignior, fays 1, do not be uneafy about be* 
ing left to go back alone, if this be a Method for 
iny return to England^ it fhall be your Fault, if 
you go back to Macao at all. We then went to con- 
fulting together what was to be done, and f ask'd 
my Partner what he thought of the Pilot's News^ 
and whether it would fuit with his Affairs > He 
told me he would do juft as I would, for he bad 
fettled all his AfFairs fo well at Bengale^^ and left his 
EffeSs in luch good Hands, that as we had made a 
good Voyage here, if he could veft it in China Silks> 
wrought and raw, fuch as might be worth the Car- 
riage, he would be content to go to Eftglartd, and 
then make his Voyage back to Bevgale^ by the Com- 
pany's Ship. 

Having refblv'd upon this, we agreed, that if our 
Portugal Pilot would go with us, we would bear 
his Charges to Mvfcow^ or to Evglani if he pleas'dj 
nor indeed were we to be efteem'd over generous in 
that Part neither, if we had not rewarded him far- 
ther, for the Service he had done us was really worth 
all that, and more ^ for be had not only been a Pi- 
lot to us at Sea, but he had been like a Broker for 
tis on Shore 5 and his procuring for us the Japan 
Merchant, was fome hundreds of Pounds in our 
Pocket : So we conlulted together about it, and be- 
ing willing to gratify him^ which was indeed but 

dping 



[ 2^3 ] 

doing him Juftice, and very willing alfo to have 
him with us befides, for he was a moil necejQTary 
Man on all Occafions, we agreed to give him a 
Quantity of coin'd Gold, uhich, as I compute it, 
came to about 17s Pounds Sterling between us, 
and to bear all his Charges, both for himfell 
and Horfe, except only a Horfe to carry his 
Goods. 

Having fettled this among ourfelves, we call'd 
him to let him know what we bad refolv'd 5 I told 
him, he had complain'd of our being to let him go 
back alone, and I was now to tell Jiim we was re- 
folv'd he fhould not go back at all : That as we 
had refolv'd to go to Europe with the Caravan, we 
refolv'd alfo he Ihould go with us, and that we 
call'd him to know his Mind. He fhook his Head, 
and faid, it was a long Journey, and he bad no Pg- 
cme to carry him thither, or ro fubfilt himfelf when 
he came there. We told him, we believM it was 
fb, and therefore we had refolv'd to do fomething 
for him, that fiiould let him fee how fenfible we 
were of the Service he had done us, and alfo how 
agreeable he v^asto us 5 and then I told him what 
we had refolv'd to give him here, which he might 
lay out as we would do our own •, and that as for 
his Charges, if he would go with us, we would 
fet him fafe a fhore, (Life and Cafuahies excepted) 
either in Mufcovy or England, which he would, at 
our own Charge, except only the Carriage of his 
Goods. 

He received the Propofal like a Man tranfported, 
and told us he would go with us over the whole 
World 5 and fo, in fliort, we all prepar'd ourfelves 
for the Journey : However, as it was with us, fo it 
was with the other Merchants, they had many 
things to do, and inftead of being ready in five 
Weeks, it was four Months and fome odd Days, 
before all Things were got together*

It was the Beginning of February^ our Stile, 
when we fet from Pekhg ^ my Partner and the old 
Pilot had gone esprefs back ro the Port where we 
had firft put in, to difpofe of fome Goods which we 
had left there ^ and I with a Chinefe Merchant, 
who I had fonne Knowledge of at Nayiqim^ and 
who came to Fehyig on his own AflFiirs, went to 
Nanqiiht^ where 1 bought ninety Pieces of fine Da-? 
masks, with about two hundred Pieces of other 
very fine Silks, of feveral Sorts, fome mix'd with 
Gold, and had all thefe brought to Pekirjg againlt 
my Partner's Return 5 begdes this, we bought a ve- 
ry large Quantity of Raw Silk, and fome other 
Goods, our Cargo amounting in thefe Goods only 
to about three thoufand five hundred Pounds Ster- 
ling, which, together with Tea, and fome fine Cal- 
licoes, and three Camels Loads of Nutmegs and 
Cloves, loaded in all eighteen Camels for our Share, 
befides thole we rode upon •, which with two or 
three fpare Horfes, and two Hor(es loaded with Pro- 
vifions, made us in fhor i 26 Camels and Horfes in 
our Retinue. 

The Company was very great, and, as near as I 
can remember, made between three and four hun- 
dred Korfe, and upvi^ards of a hundred and twenty 
Men, very well armed and p!K)vided for all Events : 
For as the Eaitern Caravans are fubjefl: to be at- 
tacked by the Jrabs, fo are thefe by the Tartars 5 but 
they are not altogether fo dangerous as the Arabs, 
not fo barbarous when they prevail. 

The Company confifled of People of feveral Na- 
tions, fuch as Mvfcovhes chiefly, for there were a- 
bove Sixty of them who were Merchants or Inhabi- 
tants of Mvfcom^ tho' of them fome were Livofiians^ 
and to our particular Satibfaftion, Five of them 
were Scots^ who appeared alfo to be Men of great 
Experience in BufinefSj and Men of very good 
Subltaiice.

[ 2^5 1 

When we had travelled one Days Journey, the 
Guides, who were Five in Number, called all the 
Gentlemen and Merchants, that is to fay, all the 
PaiTengers, except the Servants, to a great Council, 
as they call it : At this great Council, every one de- 
ported a certain Quuntity of Money to a common 
Stock, for the neceflary Expence of buying Forage 
on the Way, where it was not otherwile to be had 
and for fatisfying the Guides, getting Horfes, and 
ihe like : And here they conftituted the Journey, 
as they call it, {viz,) They named Captains and Of- 
ficers, to draw m ail up, and give the Command in 
cafe of an Attack, and gave every one their turn of 
Command - Nor was this forming us into Order any 
more than what we found needful upon the Way, as 
(hall be obferved in its Place. 

The Road all on this Side of the Country is very 
populous, and is full of Potters: And Earth makers, 
that is to fay, People that tamper'd the Earth for 
the ChzJia. Ware 5 and as I was coming along, our 
Tortiigal Pilot, who had always fomething or other 
to fay to make us merry, came fneering to me, and 
told me he would fhow me the greaieft Rarity in all 
the Country, and that I fhould have this to fay of 
China^ after all the ill-humour'd things I had faid 
of it, that I had feen one Thing which was not to 
be feen in all the World befide. I was very impor« 
tunate to know what it was : At laft he told me it 
was a Gentleman's Houfe built all with C^fw^ Ware. 
Well, fays I, are not the Materials of their Build- 
ing the Produft of their own Country 5 and fo it 
is all China Ware, is not it > No, no, fays he, I 
mean, it is a Houfe all made of China Ware, fuch 
as you call it in England -^ or as it is cali'd in our 
Country, Vorcellain, Well, fays I, fuch a Thing 
may be ^ how big is it ? Can we carry it in a Box 
upon a Camel ? If we can, we will buy it. Upon a 
Caniel ! fays the old Pilot, holding up both his 
Hands, why there is a Family- of Thirty People lives in 
it. 1 was 



[ 266 3 

I was then curious indeed to fee it, and when I 
I came to it, it was nothing but this 5 it was a 
Timber- Houfe, or a Houfe built, as we call it in 
Evgland^ with Lath and Plaifter, but all the Plaif- 
tering was really China Ware, that is to fay, it was 
plaitter'd with the Earth that makes China Ware, 

The Outfide, which the Sun fhone hot upon, was 
glazed, and look'd very well, perfeft white, and 
painted with blue Figures, as the large China Ware 
in England is painted, and hard, as if it had been 
feurnt : As to the Infide, all the Walls, inftead of 
Wainfcot, were lined up with hardened and painted 
Tiles, like the little fquare Tiles we call Galley-Tiles 
in England, all made of the fineft China, and the 
figures exceeditig fine indeed, with extraordinary 
Variety of Colours mix'd with Gold, many Tiles 
making but one Figure, but join'd fo artificially, 
the Mortar being made of the fame Earth, that it 
was very hard to fee where the Tiles met : The 
Floors of the Rooms were of the fame Compofition, 
and as hard as the earthen Floors we have in ufe in 
feveral Parts of England^ efpecially Lincohjhirey 
Nottinghamjhtre^ LeiceJIerflnre^ &c. as hard as Stone, 
and fmooth, but not burnt and painted, except fome 
fmaller Rooms, like Clofets, which were all as it 
were paved with the fame Tile ; the Cielings, and 
in a Word, all the plaiftering Work in the whole 
Houfe were of the fame Earth 5 and after all, the 
Roof was cover'd with Tiles of the fame, but of a 
deep fhining black. 

This was a China Ware houfe indeed, truly and 
litterally to be call'd fo 5 and had I not been upon 
the Journey, I could have ftaid fome Days to fee 
and examine the Particulars of it .• They told me 
there were Fountains and Fifh-ponds in the Garden^ 
all paved at the Bottom and Sides with the fame, 
and fine Statutes fet up in Rows on the Walks, en-* 
tirely form'd of the torcdbin Earth, and burnt 
whole. 



[ 16^ ] 

As tfiis is one of the Singularities of CUm^ fo 
jihey may be allow'd to excel in it ^ but I am very 
fure they excel in their Accounts of it ^ tor ihey 
bid me fuch incredible things of their Performance 
jin Crockery-Jrare^ for fuch it is, that I care not to 
relate, as knowing it could not be true ^ they told 
me in particular of one Workman that made a Ship 
with all its Tackle, and Mafts, and Sails, in Earth- 
en Ware, big enough to carry fifty Men : If he had 
told me he launched it, and made a Voyage to Ja* 
pan in it, I might have faid fomething to it indeed ; 
but as it was, 1 knew the whole Story, which was 
in fliort, asking Pardon for the Word, that the 
Fellow lyed ^ fo 1 fmiled, and faid nothing to it. 

This odd Sight kept me two Hours behind the 
Caravan, for which, the Leader of it for the Day, 
fined me about the Value of three Shillings, and 
told me, if it had been three Days Journey without 
the Wall, as it was three Days within, he muft havt 
fined me four times as much, and made me ask Par- 
don the next Council Day 5 fo I promifed to be more 
orderly ^ for indeed I found afterward the Orders 
made for keeping altogether, were abfolutely necef- 
fary for our common Safety. 

In two Days more, we pafs'd the great China 
Wall, made for a Fortification againft the Tartars^ 
and a very great Work it is, going over Hills and 
Mountains in a needlefs Track, where the Rocks 
are impaffible, and the Precipices fuch as no Enemy 
could poflibly enter, or indeed climb up, or where 
if they did, no Wall could hinder them : They tell 
lis, its Length is near a Thoufand Evglifi Miles, but 
that the Country is five Hundred In a ftrait mealured 
Line, which the Wall bounds, without meafuring the 
Windings and Turnings it takes ^ Ws about four 
Fathom high, and as many thick in fome Places. 

I flood ftill an Hour or thereabout; without tref^ 
paffing our Orders, for fo lovg the Caravan was in 
gajtng the Gats I I fay, I flood flill an Hour to look 
i ■ ' at 



i 26B ] 

at ft on every Side, near, and far off, I meaoj that 
was within my View^ and the Guide of our Cara-i. 
van, who had been extolling it for the Wonder of 
the World, was mighty eager to hear my Opinion, 
of it^ I told him it was a molt excellent thing | 
to keep off the Tartars-^ which he happen'd not toj, 
under It and as I meant ir, and fo took it for a Com-^ 
pliment; but the old Pilot laugh'd : O Seignior In-] 
glefe^ fays he, you fpeak in Colours: In Colours, || 
Jaid /, what do you mean by that? Why, you 
ipeak what looks White this way^ and Black t/j^t I 
v^ay ^ gay one way^ and dull another n7ay : you tell I 
him it is a good Wall to keep out Tartars ^ you tell 1 
me by that^ it is good for nothing but to keep out ' 
Tartars^ or it will keep out none hut Tartars ^ I \ 
underftand you, Seigneur htghfe, I underftand you, i 
fays he Joking, bui: Seigneur Chingfe underftood 
you his own way. 

Well, fays I, Seignior, do you think it would 
Hand out an Army of our Country People, with 
2 good Train of Artillery ^ or our Engineers, with 
two Companies of Miners ^ would not they batter 
it down in ten Days, that an Army might enter in 
Battalia, or blow it up in the Air, Foundation and 
all, that there fhouid be no Sign of it left > Ay, ay, 
lays he, 1 know that. The C/jiw^/? wanted mightily 
to know what I faid, and I gave him leave to tell 
him a few Days after, for we was then almoft out 
of their Country, and he was to leave us in a little 
time afcerward ^ but when he knew what I had 
laid, he was dumb all the reft of the way, and we 
heard ho more of his fine Story, of the Ch'mefe Pow- 
er and Greatnefi, while he ftay'd. 

After we had pafs'd this mighty Nothing calFd a 
Wall, fomething like the PiBs Wall, fo famous in 
^Northumberland, and bud t by the Romans^ we began 
to find the Country thinly inhabited, and the People 
rather confined to live in fortified Towns and Cities, 
as being fubjeft to the Inroads and Depredations o^ 

the 



[ 2^P ] 

he Tartars^ who rob in great Armies, and therefore 
jre not to be refilted by the naked Inhabitans of an 
open Countrjr. 

And here I began to find the Necefiity of keeping 
together in a Caravan as we travelled ^ for we faw 
feveral Troops of Tartars roving about •, but when I 
:ame to fee them diftin^lly 1 wonder'd more that 
: he Chhiefe Empire could be conquer'd by fuch con- 
:emptible Fellows ; for they are a meer Hoord or 
Crowd of wild FeHows •, keeping no Order^ 
ind underftanding no Difcipline, or manner of 
?ight. 

Their Horfes are poor lean ftarved Creatures, 
:aught nothing and {it for nothing ^ and this we 
jound the firft Day we faw them, which was after 
ve entred the wilder Part of the Country ; our 
Leader for the Day, gave Leave for about fixteen of 
]S to go a hunting, as they call it -, and what was 
:his, but hunting of Sheep ; however, it may be 
:aird hunting too ^ for the Creatures are the wild- 
id and fwiftelt of Foot that ever I faw of their 
\ind 5 only they will not run a great way^ and 
/ou are fore of Sport when you begin the Chace 5 
for they appear generally thirty or forty in a Flock, 
ind like true Sheep, always keep together when 
:hey fiy. 

in purfuit of this odd fort of Game, it was our 
hap to m,eet with about forty Tartars ^ whether they 
were hunting Mutton as we were^ or whether they 
iook'd for another kind of Prey, I know not ^ but 
IS foon as they faw us one of them blew a kind of a 
Horn very loud, but with a barbarous Sound, that I 
had revet heard before, and by the way, never care 
to hear again : We ail fuppos'd this was to call their 
Friends about them^ and fo it was •, for in lefs thad 
Half a Quarter of an Hour, a Troop of forty or fif- 
ty more appeared, at about a Mile diftanee^- hut 
our Work was over firft^ as it happen'd. 

One 



[ 270 ] 

One of the Scots Merchants of Mtifcow, happened 
to be amongft us, and as foon as he heard the Horn, 
he told us in ihort, that we had nothing to do, but 
to charge them immediately without lofs of Time 5 
and drawing us up in a Line, he ask'd if we were re- 
folv'd } we told him we were ready to follow him 5 
fo he rode dire£lljr up to them : They Rood gazing 
at us like a meet Crowd, drawn up in no Order, 
nor (hewing the Face of any Order at all ^ but as 
foon as they (aw us advance, they let fly their Ar- 
rows, which however mifs'd us very happily ^ it 
feems they miftook not their Aim, but their Di- 
ftance 5 for their Arrows all fell a little (hort of us, 
but with fo true an Aim, that had we been about 
twenty Yards nearer, we mult have had fcveral Men 
wounded, if not kiii'd. 

Immediately we halted, and tho' it was at a great 
Diftance, we fir'd, and fent them Leaden Bullets, 
for Wooden Arrows, following our Shot full Gal- 
lop, refolving to fall in among them Sword in Hand, 
for fo cnr bold Scot that led us direfted: He was 
indeed but a Merchant, but he behav'd with that 
Vigour and Bravery on this Occafion, and yet, with 
fuch a cool Courage to, that I never faw any Man 
in Aftion fitter for Command, As foon as we came 
up to them, we fir'd out Piftols in their Faces, and 
then drew, but they fled in the greateft Confufion 
imaginable •, the only ftand any of them made, was 
on our Right, where three of them flood, and 
fcy figns caii'd the reft to come back to them, hav- 
ing a kind of Symiter in their Hands, and their 
Bows hanging at their Backs. Our brave Com- 
mander, without asking any body to follow him, 
gallops up dole to them, and with his Fuzee knocks 
one of them off his Horfe, kill'd the fecond with 
his Piftol, and the third ran away, and thus ended 
our Fii^ht ; but we had this Misfonane attending ir, 
(viz,) that all our Mutton that we had in chace, got 
away : We had not a Man kill'd or hurt j but as 

for 



[ 271 ] 

for the Tartars^ there was about five of them kill'd^ 
how many were wounded, we knew not 5 but this 
we knew, that the other Party was fo frighted with 
the Noife of our Guns, that they made oflF, and 
never made any attempt upon us. 

We were all this while in the Chinefe Dominion, 
and therefore the Tartars were not fo bold as after- 
wards^ but in about five Days we enter'd a vaS: 
great wild Defart, which held us three Days and 
Nights March ^ and we were oblig'd to carry our 
Water with us in great Leather Bottles, and to en- 
camp all Night, juft as I have heard they do in the 
Defarts of Arabia, 

1 ask'd our Guides whofe Dominion this was in, 
and they told me, this was a kind of Boarder, that 
might be called no Man^s Land *, being a Part of the 
Great Karakathay^ or Grand Tartary^ but that how- 
ever it was all reckoned to China -^ that there was 
no Care taken here, to preferve it from the Inroads 
of Thieves, and therefore it was reckon'd the worft 
Defart in the whole March 5 tho' we were to go 
over fome much larger. 

In paffing this Wildernefs, which I ccnfeis was 
at the firft View very frightful to me, we faw two 
or three times little Parties of the Tartars^ but they 
feem'd to be upon their own Affairs, and to have 
no Defign upon us ^ and fo, like the Man' who met 
the Devil, if they had nothing to fay to us, we 
had nothing to fay to them 5 we let them go. 

Once however, a Party of them came fo near, as 
to ftand and gaze at us^ whether it was to confider 
what they fhould do, (viz.) to attack us, or not at- 
tack us, that we knew not •, but when we were 
pafs'd at fome diffance bv them, we made a Rear- 
Guard of forty Men, and (food ready for them, let- 
ting the Caravan pjls half a Mile, or thereabouts, 
before us j after a whi'e they march'd oflF, only we 
found thev affaulred us v;ith five Arrows at their 
parting 5 one of which, wounded a Horlej fo that 

it 



[ 272 ] 

it difibled him y and we left him the next Day, pcot 
Creature, in great need of a good Farrier 5 wc fup- 
pofe they might fiioot more Arrows, which might 
fall fliorc of us, but we faw no more Arrows or 
Tartars, that time. 

We travelled near a Month after this, the Ways 
being not io good as at firft, tho' (till in the Domi- 
nions of the Emperor of China^ but lay for the moft 
Part in Villages, fome of which were fortified, be- 
caufe of the Incurfions of the Tartars. When we 
came to one of thefe Towns, fit was about two 
Days and a Halfs Journey before we were to come 
to the City Naitm ) I wanted to buy a Came), of 
which there are plenty to be fold all the Way upon 
that Road, and of Horfes alfo, fuch as they are,, 
becaulefo many Caravans coming that way, they 
are often wanted : The Perfon that I fpoke to to get 
me a Camd, would have gone and ferch'd it for 
me, but I like a Fool muft be officious, and go my- 
felf along with him ; The Place was about two 
Miles out of the Village, where, it feems, they kept 
the Camels and Horfes feeding under a Guard. 

I walk'd it on Foot with my old Pilot in Compa- 
ny, and a Chimfe, being very defirous, forfooth, of 
a little Variety : When we came to this Place, it 
%vaS^.a low marfhy Ground, wali'd round with a 
ftone Wall, piled up dry, without Morter or Earth 
among it, like a Park with a little Guard ofChbntefe 
Soldiers at the Door. Having bought a Camel, and 
agreed for the Price, I came away, 2Lnd thQ Chinefe 
Man that went with me, led the Camel ^ when on 
a fudden came up five T^nars on Horfe-back ^ two 
of rhem feized the Fellow, and took the Camel 
from him, while other three ftep'd up to me ^ and 
my old Pilot: Seeing us as it were unarm'd, fori 
had no Weapon about me but my Sword, which 
could but ill defend me againlt three Horfe-men 5 
the firft that came up, ftop'd fhort upon my draw- 
ing my Sword j (^for they are errant Cowards j but a 

Second 



C 273 ] 

Second coming upon my Left, gave me a Blow on 
the Head, which I never felt till afterward, and 
wondered when I came to myfelf, what was the 
matter with me, and where I was for he laid me flat 
on the Ground 5 but my never failing old Pilot, the 
Portugtieze (io Providence unlocked for direfts De- 
liverances from Dangers, which to us are untbre- 
feenj had a Piftol in his Pocket which 1 knew no- 
thing of, nor the Tartars neither ^ if they had, I 
fuppofe they would not have attack'd us : Bur Cow- 
ards are always boldeft when there is no Danger, 

The old Man feeing me down, with a bold Heart 
Kep'd up to the Fellow that had (truck me, and 
laying hold of his Arm with one Hand, and pulling 
him down by main Force, a little towards him with 
the other, (hot him into the Head, and laid him 
de^d upon the Spot 5 he then immediately ftep'd up 
to him who had ftop'd us, as I faid, and before he 
could come forward again, (for it was all done as 
as ic were in a moment j made a Blow at him with 
1 Scy meter which he always wore, but miffing the 
Man, cut 'his Horfe into the Side of his Head, cut 
one of his Ears ofF by the Root, and a great Slice 
iown the Side of his Face ^ the poor Beaft enraged 
^ich the Wound, was no more to be governed by 
lis Rider^ the' the FelJovv fat well enough too 5 but 
iway he fiew, and carried him quite out of the Pl- 
ot's Reach, and at fome diltance rifi.ng up upon his 
lind Legs, threw down the Tartar^ and fell upon 
lim. 

In this interval the poor Chinefe came in, who had 
oft the Camel, bat he had no Weapon •, however^ 
seeing the Tartar down, and his Horfe fallen upon 
lim, he runs to him, and feizing upon an ugly ill- 
ravour'd Weapon he had by his Side, fomething like 
ii Pole-ax, but not a Pole jx neither^ he v^rench'd 
t from him, and made (hift to knock his Tartarian 
drains out with it. But my old Man had the third 
Tartar to deal with itil), and feeing he did not fly, 

S as 



i 274 1 

as Tie expe£led, tior come on to fight him, as h^ 
apprehended^ but flood flock ftill, the old Man 
ftood flill too, and falls to work with his Tackle to 
charge his Piflol again ^ but as foon as the Tartar 
faw the Piflol, whether he fuppofed it to be the 
fame or another, 1 know not ^ but away he fcower. 
ed, and left my Pilot, my Champion I call'd him 
afterward, a compleat Viftory. 

By this time I was a little awake, for I thought 
when firft I began to wake, that I had been in a 
fweet Sleep 5 but as I faid above, I wondered where 
I was, how I came upon the Ground, and what was 
the matter : In a word, a few moments after, as 
Senfe returned, I felt Pain> tho' I did not know 
where 5 I clap'd my Hand to my Head, and took it 
away bloody -, then I felt my Head ach, and then 
in another Moment, Memory returned^ and every 
thing was prefent to me again. 

I jump'd up upon my Feet inflantly, and got 
hold of my Sword, but no Enemies in view : I 
found a Tartar lie dead and his Horfe ftanding very 
quietly by him-, and looking farther, 1 law my 
Champion and Deliverer, who had been to fee what 
the Chinefe had done, coming back with his Hanger 
in his Hand -, the old Man feeing me on my Feetj 
came running to me and embraced me with a great 
deal of Joy, being afraid before that I had been kil- 
led, and fteing me bloody, would fee how I was 
hurt, but it was not much, only what we call a 
broken Head j neither did I afterwards find any 
great Inconvenience from the Blow, other than the 
Place which was hurt, and which was well again in 
two or three Days. 

We made no great Gain however by this Vifl:ory, 
for we loft a Camel, and Gained a Horfe 5 but that 
which was remarkable, when we came back to the 
Village, the Man demanded to be paid for the Ca- 
mel 5 I dilputed it, and it was brought to a hearing 
before the Chinefe Judge of the Place 5 that is to 



[ 275 3 

ray, in Eitgliflj^ we went before a Juftice of the 
Peace : Give him his due, he afted with a great 
deal of Prudence and Impartiality; and having 
heard both Sides, he gravely ask'd xheChineJe Man, 
that went with me to buy the Camel, whole Servant 
he was > I am no Servant, fays he, but went with 
the Stranger. At whofe Requeft, fays the Juftice ? 
At the Stranger's Regueft, fays he. Why then, fays 
the Juftice, you wete the Scranger's Servant for the 
Time, and the Camel being deliver'd to his Ser- 
vant, it was delivered to him, and he miift pay 
for it. 

I confefs the Thing was fb clear, that I had not a 
Word to fay ^ but admiring to feefuch juft Reafon- 
ing upon the Corifequence, and fo accurate Bating 
the Caufe, I pay'd willingly for the Camel, and 
fent for another 5 but you may obferve, I fent fof 
it, 1 did not go to fetch it myfelf any morei I had 
enough of that. 

the City of I^aum is a Frontier of the Chkefi 
Empire ^ thev call it fortified, and fo it is as Forti- 
fications go there •, for this I will venture to afSrm, 
that all the Tartars in Karalathaze^ which 1 believe, 
are fome Millions, could not batter down the Walls 
with their Bows and Arrows •, but to call it ftrong^ 
If it were attacked with Cannon, would be to make 
fhofe who underftand it, laugh at you. 

We wanted as I have faid, above two Days Jour« 
ney of this City, when Meffengers were fent Exprels 
to every Part of the Road, to tell all Travellers and 
Caravans, to halt 'till they had a Guard fent for 
them 5 for that an iinufal Body of Tartars^ making 
ten thoufand in all, had appeared in the Way, about 
thirty Miles beyond the City. 

This was very bad News to Travellers % however^ 
It was carefully done of the Governour, and we 
were very glad to hear we fhould have a Guard 1 
accordingly, two Days after, we had two hundred 
Soldiers fent us from a Garrifon of the Chmfes^ on 

S a ont 



[ 2^6 3 

our left, and three hundred more from the City of 
Naim^ and with thofe we advanced boldly ^ the 
three hundred Soldiers from Najim^ march'd in our 
Front, the two hundred in our Rear, and our Men on j 
each fide of our Camels with our Baggage, and the ' 
whole Caravan in the Center ^ in this Order, and 
well prepared for Battle, we thought ourfelves a 
Match for the whole ten thoufand Movgid Tartars^ 
if they had appeared ^ but the next Day when they . 
did appear, it was quite another thing. 1 

It was early in the Morning, when marching' 
from a little well fituated Town call'd Chavgu^ we 
had a River to pafs, where we were obliged to ferry 5 i 
and had ihQ Tartars h^d any Intelligence, then hadi 
been the Time to have attacked us, when the Ca- 
ravan being over, the Rear Guard was behind , but 
they did not appear there. 

About three Hours after, when we were enter'dl 
upon a Defart of about fifteen or lixteen Miles over^ 
behold, by a Cloud of Duft they rais'd, we fiw an 
Enemy was at Hand, and they were at Hand indeed, 1 
for they came on upon the Spur. _ \ 

ThQ Chinefes^ our Guard on the Front, who had ' 
talk'd fo big the Day before, began to ftagger, and 
the Soldiers frequently look'd behind them, which 
is a certain Sign in a Soldier, that he is juft ready to 
run away ; my old Pilot was of my Mind, and 
being near me, he call'd out. Seignior hglefe^ fays 
he, thofe Fellows mufi be encourag'd, or they will 
ruin us all ^ for if the Tartars come on, they will 
never ftand it : I am of your Mind^faid I, hni what 
Courfe mult be done > Done \fays he^ let fifty of our 
Men advance, and flajk them on each Wing, --nd en- 
courage them, and they will fight like brave reiiows 
in brave Company ^ but without it, ihey will every 
Man turn his back 5 immediately 1 rode up to our 
Leader, and told him who was txaftly of our mind-, 
and arcording.y, fitry « f us march'd to the right 
.IVingj and fitly to the lefr^ and the reft m^de a 

Line 



[ 277 ] 

Line of Refcue ^ and fo we march'd, leaving the 
hft two hundred Men to make another Body by 
thenrifelves, and to guard the Camels ^ only that 
if need were, they Ihould fend a hundred Men, to 
aflift the lalt fifty. 

In a word, the Tartars came en, and an innume- 
rable Company they were^ how many, we could 
not tell, but ten Thoufand we thought was the leaft : 
A Party of them came on firft, and view'd our 
Pofture, traverfing the Grcund in the Front of our 
Line ^ and as we found them within Gun-fhor, our 
Leader ordered the two Wings to advance fwiftly, 
and give them a Salvo on each Wing with their 
Shot, which was done^ but they went off, and I 
fuppofe back to give an Account of the Reception 
they were like to meet with : And indeed that Sa- 
lute clogg'd their Stomach, for they immediately 
halted, flood a while to confider of it, and wheel- 
ing off to the left, they gave over the DeSgn, and faid 
no more to us for that time 5 which was very agree- 
able to our Circumftances, which were but very in» 
different for a Battle with fuch a Number. 

Two Days after this, we came to the City Naun^ 
or Naum ^ we thank'd the Governour for his Care 
for us, and collefted to the Value of a hundred 
Crowns, or thereabouts, which we gave to the 
Soldiers fent to guard us^ and here we refted one 
Day. This is a Garrifon indeed, and there were 
nine hundred Soldiers kept here ^ but the Reafon of 
it was, that formerly the Mufcovhe Frontiers lay 
nearer to them than they do now, the Ahifcovhes 
having abandoned that Part of the County (which 
lies from this City Weft, for about two hundred 
Miles^ as defolate and iinfit for life -, and more 
efpecially, being fo very remote, and fo difficult to 
fend Troops thither for its Defence-, for we had 
yet above two thoufand Miles to Mpfcovy^ properly 
fo call'd. 

S 3 Aftej 



C 278 } 

After this, we pafs'd feveral great Rivers, and 
two dreadful Defarrs, one of which we were fix- 
teen Days pjfling over, and which, as I faid, was 
to be caird wo man's Land 5 and on the 13th of 
April we cime to the h rentiers of the Mvfcovite Do- 
minions ; I think the firlt City, or Town, or For- 
trefs, whatever it m'ght be call'd, that belong'd 
to the Czar of ^lufiovy^ was call'd ^r^ww, being on 
the Weft Side of (tit River Argun 

I could nor but dilcover an infinite Satisfaftion, 
that I was fo loon arrived in, as I call'd it, a Cbri- 
ftian Country, or at lealt in a Country governed by 
Chriftians-, for tho' the Mvfcovites do, in my OpU 
mon^ but juft delcrve fhe Naine of Chriftians, yet 
iuch they pretend to be, and are very devout in 
their Way : It w* uld certainly occur to any Man 
who travels the World as I have done, and who 
had any Power of Refleaion •, I fay, it would oc- 
cur to him, to refl^a what a Bleffing it is to be 
brought into the World, where the Name of God, 
and of a Redeemer is known, worftiip'd and ador'dj 
and not where the People given up by Heaven to 
ftrong Delufions, worftiip the Devil, and proftrate 
themfelves to Stocks and Stones ^ worftiip MonfterSj 
Elements, horrible fliaped Animals, and Statues, or 
Images of Monfters; Not a- Town or City^ we 
pafs'd thro', but had their Pagods, their Idols, and 
their Temples, and ignorant People worftiipping^ 
even the Works of their own Hand3. 

Now we came where at leaft a Face of the 
Chriftian Worftiip appear'd, where the Knee was 
bow'd to Jefus •, and whether ignorantly or not, yet 
the Chriftian Religion was own'd, and the Name 
of the true God was call'd upon, and adored 5 and 
it made the very Recefles of my Soul rejoice to fee 
it : I faluted the brave 5ca5 Merchant 1 mentioned 
above, with my firtt acknowledgment of this 5 and 
taking him by the Hand, I faid to him, Bleffed be 
Goda we are once again come among Chriftians: He 

. finiled^ 



[ 27P ] 

fmiled, and anfwered, do not rejoice too fbon Coun* 
try-man, rhefe Mtifcovites are but an odd fort of 
Chriftians ; and but for the Name of it, you may 
fee very little of the Subltance^ for fome Months 
farther of our Journey. 

Well, fays I, but (till 'tis better than Paganifm, 
and worfhipping of Devils. Why, Til tell you, 
fays he, except the Unjjian Soldiers in Garrifons, 
and a few of the Inhabitants of the Cities upon the 
Road, all the reft of this Country, for above a thou- 
fand Miles farther, is inhabited by the worft, an4 
moft ignorant of Pagans % and fo indeed we found 
it. 

We were now launch'd into the greateft Piece of 
folid Earth, if I underftand any thing pf the Surface 
of the Globe, that is to be found in aay Part of the 
World 5 we had at leaft twelve hi^ndred Miles to 
the Sea, Eaftward 5 we had at leaft two^thouland 
to the Bottom of the Baltick Sea, Weftv?rard % and 
above three thoufand Miles, if we left that Sea^ 
and went on Weft to the BritiJI) and French Chan- 
nels : Wq had full five thoufand Miles to the M- 
flw, or Perfian Sea, South ; and about eight hundred 
Miles to the Frozen Sea, North ^ nay^ if fome 
People may be believed, there might be. no/ Sea 
North^Eaft, 'till we came round the Pole, and con- 
fequentiy into the Norths Weft, and fo had a Conti° 
Jient of Land into America^ no Mortal knows where^ 
tho' I could give fome Reafons, why I believe that 
to be a Miftake too. 

As we enter'd into the Mufcovite Dominions, a 
good while before we came to any confiderable 
Towns, we had nothing to obferve there but this ^ 
firft. That all the Rivers run to the Eaft : As I un- 
derftood by the Charts which fome in our Caravan 
had with them, it was plain, that all thole Rivers 
ran into the Great River Tamour^ otGammonri This 
River, by the natural Courfe of it muft run into 
Ihe Eaft Sea, or Chinefe Ocean, Tli« Story they tell 

S 4 u\ 



[ 28o ] 

us, that the Mouth of \ this River is choak'd up with 
Bull rufhes of a monftruous Growth, (viz.) three 
Foot about, and twenty or thirty Foot high, 1 muft 
be allowed to fay, I believe nothing of-, bur as its 
Navigation is of no life, becaufe there is no Trade 
that way, the Tartars^ to whom alone it belongs, 
dealing in nothing hut Cattle, fo no Body that ever 
I heard of, has been curious enough, either to go 
down to the Mouth of it in Boats, or come up from 
the Mouth of it in Ships ; but this is certain, that 
this River running due Eaft, in the Latitude of 
carries a vaft Concourfe of Rivers along 
with it, and finds an Ocean to empty itfelf in that 
Latitude ^ fo we are fure of Sea there. 

Some Leagues to the North of this River, there 
are feveral confiderable Rivers, whofe Streams run 
as due North as the Tamour runs Eaft, and thefe are 
all found to join their Waters with the Great River 
Tavtarusy nam'd fo, from the northeromoft Nations 
of the Movgul Tartars, who the CMnefe fay, were 
the firft Tartars In the World ; and who, as our Ge- 
ographers alledge, are the Gog and Magogs menci- 
on'd in facred Story. 

Thefe Rivers running aH Northward, as well as 
all the other Rivers, I am yet to fpeak of make it 
evident, that the Northern Ocean bounds the Land 
alfo on that fide ^ fo that it does not feem rational 
in the leaft to think, that the Land can extend itfelf 
to join with America on that fide, or that there is 
not a Communication between the Northern and 
the Fafiern Ocean ^ but of this I (hall fay no more, 
it was my Obfervation at that Time, and therefore 
I take Notice of it in this Place. We now advanc- 
ed from the River Argma by eafy and moderate 
Journeys, and were very vifibly oblig'd to the Care 
the Czar of Miifcovy has taken to have Cities and 
Towns built in as many Places as are poflible to 
place them, where his Soldiers keep Garrifon fome- 
thing like the Stationary Soldiers glac'd by the Ro- 

mam 



[ 28l 1 

mam in the remoteft Countries of their Empire, 
feme of which I had read particularly were plac'd 
in Britain for the Security of Commerce, and for 
the lodging Travellers ♦, and thus it was here -, for 
where-ever we came, tho'at thefe Towns and Stati- 
ons, the Garrifons and Governour were Ritffians, and 
profels'd Chriftians, yet the Inhabirants of the 
Country were meer Pagans^ facrificing to Idols, 
and worfhipping the Sun, Moon, and Stars, or all 
the Hoft of Heaven, and not only fo, but were of 
all the Heathens and Fagans that ever I met with, 
the moft barbarous, except only that they did not 
eat Man's Flefh, as our Savages of America did. 

Some Inftances of this we met with in the Coun- 
try between Jrgiina^ where we enter the Miifcovite 
Dominions, and a City o\ Tartars and Rv^ans toge- 
ther, call'd A'ortzimhy ^ in which Space is a conti- 
nu'd Defart or Forelt, which coft us twenty Days 
to travel over it : !n a Village nc^r the laft of thofe 
Places I had the Curiofity to go and fee their Way 
of Living, which is moft brutifli and unfufFerable | 
they had I fuppofe a great Sacrifice that Day, for 
there flood out upon an old Stump of a Tree, an 
Idol made of Wood, frightful as the Devil, ar leaft 
as any Thing we can think of to reprefent the Devi!, 
can be made ^ it had a Head certainly not fo much 
as refembling any Creature that the World ever faw ^ 
Ears as big as Goats Horns, and as high ^ Eyes as 
big as a Crown- Piece •, a Nofe like a crooked Ram's 
Horn, and a Mouth extended four corner'd, like 
that of a Lion, with horrible Teeth, hooked like a 
Parrot's under Bill -, it was drefled up in the filthi- 
eft manner that you could fuppofe ^ its upper Gar* 
ment was of Sheep-Skins, with the Wool outward, 
a great Tartar Bonnet on the Head, with two Horns 
growing through it 5 it was about eight Foot high, 
yet had no Feet or Legs^ or any other Proportion of 
Parts. 

This 



[ 282 ] 

This Scare crow was fet up at the outer Side of 
the Village, and when I came near to it, there were 
fixteen or feventeen Creatures, whether Men or Wo- 
men, I could not tell for thejr make no Deftin&ion 
by their Habits, either of Body or Head : Thefe 
lay all flat on the Ground, round this formidable 
Block of (hapelefs Wood; I faw no Motion among 
them any more, than if they had been all Logs of 
Wood like the Idol, at firft, f really thought they 
had teen fo •, but when I came a little nearer, they 
itarted up upon their Feet, and rais'd a howling 
Cry, as if it had been fo many deepmoothM Hounds, 
and walk'd away as if they were difpleas'd at our 
difturbing them : A little way off from this Monfter 
and at the Door of a Tent or Hutt, made all of 
Sheep-Skins and Cow Skins, dry*d. Rood three But- 
chers, I thought they r^ere fiich -, for when I came 
nearer to them, I found they had long Knives in 
their Hands, and in the middle of the Tent ap-^ 
j^ar'd three Sheep kill'd, and one young Bullock or 
Steer : Thefe it feems, were Sacrifices to that fenf- 
leis Log of an Idol, and thefe three Men, Priefts, 
belonging to it ^ and the feventeen proftrated 
Wretches, were the Peopk who brought the Offer- 
ing, and were making their Prayers to that Stock. 

i confefs I was more mov'd at their Stupidity and 
l>rutifh Worfhip of a Hobgoblin, than ever I was at 
any Thing in my Life •, to fee God's mod glorious 
and beft Creature, to whom he had granted fo ma- 
jsy Advantages, even by Creation^ above the reft of 
the Works of his Hands, veiled with a realbnable 
Soul, and that Soul, adoru'd with Faculties and Ca- 
pacities, adapted both to honour his Makjbr, and be 
honoured by him, I fay, to fee them funk and dege- 
xierated to a Degree fo more than ttupid, as to pro* 
ftrate itlelf to a frightful Nothing, a tneer imagina- 
jy Objeft, drefs'd up by themfelves, and made terri- 
ble to themfelves by their own Contrivance ^ adorn'dj 
only with Clouts and Rags 5 and that this (hould 

be 



[ 283] 

be ihe EfFeft of meer Ignorance, wrought up in- 
to hellifli Devotion by the Devil himfelf 5 who 
envying Cto his Maker) the Homage and Adoration 
of his Creatures, had deluded them into fuch grots, 
furfeiting, fordid and brutifli things, as one would 
think (hould fhock Nature itfelf 

But what fignify'd all the Afioniftiment and Re- 
flexion of Thoughts ^ thus it was and I faw it be- 
fore my Eyes, and there was no room to wonaer at 
it, or think it impoffible ^ all my Admiration lurn'd 
to Rage, and I rid up to the Image, or Moniker, call 
it what you will, and with my Sword cut the Bon- 
net that was on its Head in two in the middle, fo 
that it hung down by one of the Horns \ and one 
of our Men that was with me took hold of the 
Sheep-Skin that coverM it, and puD'd at it, when 
behold a molt hideous Outcry and Howling run 
thro' the Village, and two or three hundred Pe pie 
came about my Ears, fo that i was glad to Icour 
for it 5 for we faw feme had Bcws and Arri ws % 
but I refolved from that Moment to vifit them 

Our Caravan refied three Nights at the Town, 
again. 

which was about &ur Miles cfF, in order to provide 
fome Horfes which they wanted feveral of the i-ot- 
fes having been lam'd, and jaded, with the badnels 
of the Way and long March over the laft Defart ^ 
fo we had fome Leifure here to pur my Defign in 
Execution : I communicated my Projeft to the Scou 
Merchant of Myfcom^ of whofe Courage I had had 
fufRcient Teftimony, as above: I told him what I 
had feen, and with what indignation I bad fince 
thought that human Nature couM be fo degenerate : 
I told him, I was relolv'd if ^I could get but four or 
five Men well arm'd to go with me, I v^s refolv'd 
to go and deftroy that vile, abominable idol ^ to let 
them fee that it had no Power to ft el p i lelf, and 
confe quently could not be anObjeflof Worfhip^ 
or to be pray'd to, much lefs help them thac cfter'd 
Sacrifices to it* H& 



[ 284 ] 

He laugh'd at me ^ fays he^ Your Zeal may be 
good, but what do you propofe to yourfelf by it > 
Propofe, faid J, to vindicate the Honour of Gofdy 
which is infulted by this Devil Worfhip. But how 
will ic vindicate the Honour of God, faid he ^ 
While the People will not be able to know what 
you mean by it, unlefs you could fpeak to them 
too, and tell them 16, and then they will fight you, 
and beat you too, 111 affure you, for they are de- 
iperate Fellows, and that efpecially in Defence of 
their Idolatry. Can we not, faid I, do it in the 
Night, and then leave them the Reafonsand Caufes 
In Writing in their 0wn Language > Writing ! faid 
lie, why there is not a Man in five Nations of them 
that know any thing of a Letter, or hoy/ to read a 
Word in any Language, or in their own. Wretch- 
ed Ignorance \ faid I to him ^ however I have a 
great mind to do it 5 perhaps Nature may draw In- 
ferences from it to them, to let them fee how brutifli 
they are, to worfhip fuch horrid Things. Look yoit^ 
Sir, faid he^ if your Zeal prompts you to it fo 
warmly, you muft do it^ but in the next place I 
would have you confider, thefe wild Nations of Peo- 
ple are fubjefted by Force to the Czar of Mifcovfs 
Dominions, and if you do this, 'tis ten to one but 
they will come by Thoufinds to the Governour of 
Nertjimhay^ and complain, and demand Satisfaction % 
and if he cannot give them Satisfaction, 'tis ten to 
one but they revolt, and it will occafion a new War 
with all the Tartars in the Country. 

This, Iconfefs, put new Thoughts into my Head 
for a while •, but I harp'd upon the fame String ftill, 
and all that Day I was uneafy to put my Proje£l in 
Execution: Towards the Evening the Scots Mer- 
chant met me by Accident in our Walk about the 
Town, and defir'd to fpeak with me 5 I believe, faid 
he, I have put yon off of your good Defign ^ I 
have been a little concerned about it fince, for I ab- 
hor the Idol and Idolatry as much as you can do %■ 

Truly, 



[ 285 ] 

Truly, fays J, you have put it off a little as to the 
Execution of it, but you have not put it at all ouc 
of my Thoughts, and I believe 1 (hall do it ftill 
before 1 quit this place ^ tho' I were to be deliver'd 
up to them for Satisfaftion, No, no, fays he, God 
forbid they (hould deliver you up to Ibch a Crew 
of Monfters •, they fhall not do that neither, that 
would be murdering you indeed. Why,y^>s /, how 
would they ufe me? U(e you/ fays he^ I'll tell 
you how they ferved a poor RuSian, who affronted 
them m their Worfhip juft as you did, and who 
they took Prifoner ^ after they had lam'd him with 
an Arrow that he could not run away, they took 
him and ftripp'd him ihrk naked, and let him up 
on the top of the Idol Monfter, and flood all round 
him, and (hot as many Arrows into him as would 
ftick over his whole Body, and then they burnt 
him and all the Arrows iticking in him a Sacri- 
fice to the Idol. And was this the fame Idol > 
Yes, fays he, the very fame. Well, fays /, I'll tell 
you a Story ^ fo I related the Story of our Men at 
Madagafcar, and how they burnt and fack'd the Vil- 
lage there, and kiil'd Man, Woman and Child, for 
their murdering one of our Men, juit as it is related 
before^ and when I had done, I added, that I thought 
we ought to do fo to this Village. 

He liften'd very attentively to the Story-, but when I 
talk'd of doing fo to that VWhg^.fayshe^Yoxx miftake 
very much, it wss nor this Vil]age,itvva$ almoita hun- 
dred Mile from this place, bur ic wasthefanieldol,for 
they carry him aboji- m Proceffion aii over the Coun- 
try : Well, lays i, then that Idol ought to be punifli'd 
for it, and it ihUl, fays I, if I live this Night 0!?t, 

In a word, finding me refolure, he lik'd the^ De- 
fign, and told me I fliould not go alooe, but he would 
go with me, and bring a (tout Fellow, one of his 
Counrrymen, to go alfo with us^ and one, fays he, 
as hmous for his Zeal as you can defire any one 
■0 b% againliluch DevUilh things as thele: In a 

word 



[ 28^ 1 

#ord, fce brought me his Comrade, a Scots Man^ 
wtio he caiTd Czptdiin Ricbardfon^ znd I gave him 
a full account of what I had feen , and alfo of what 
I intended ^ and he told me readily, he would go 
with me if it coft him his Life; fo we agreed to 

fo only us Three. 1 had indeed propos'd it to mf 
artner, but ite declined it ^ he faid, he was ready to 
aflift me to the utAioft, and upon all occafions for 
iny defence i but that this was an Adventure quite 
out of his way ; fo, I fay, we refolv'd upon our 
Work only us Three and my Man-Servant, and to 
ptst it in Execution that Night about Midnight, 
with all the Secrecy imaginable. 

However, upon fecond Thoughts, we were will- 
ing to delay it till the next Night becaufe the Ca*^ 
ravan being to fet forward in the Morning, we fup- 
pos'd the Governoiir could not pretend to give 
them any Satisfaftion upon us when we were out 
of his Power. The Scots Merchant, as Iteady in his 
Refolution for Enterprise it, as bold in executing, 
brought me a Tariar^'s Robe or Gown of Sheep Skins, 
and a Bonnet, with a Bow and Arrows, and had 
provided the fame for himlelf and his Country-man, 
that the People, if they faw lis fhould not be able 
to determine who we were. 

All the firlt Night we fpent in mixing up fome 
combultible Matter with Aqua-vitap, Gun-powder, 
and fuch other Materials as we could get, and ha- 
ving a good Quantity of Tar in a little Pot, about 
an Hour after Night we fet out upon our Expedition. 

We came to the Place about Eleven a Clock at 
Night, and found that the People had not the leaft 
Jealoufy of Danger attending their Idol-, the Night 
was cloudy, yet the Moon gave us Light enough 
to fee that the Idol flood juft in the fame Poflure 
and Place that it did btiore: The People feemed to- 
be all at their Rett, only, that in the great Hutt, ot 
Tent, as we called it, where we faw the three Priefts^ 
who we miftook for Butchers, we faw a Light, and 

, going 



C 287 ] 

going up clofe to the Door, we heard People talking^ 
as if there were (ivQ or fix of them 5 we concluded 
therefore, that if we fet Wild fire to the Idol, thcfe 
Men would come out immediately, and run up to 
the Place to refcue it from the De[tru£lion that we 
intended for it, and what to do with them we knew 
not 5 once we thought of carrying it away and fet- 
ting Fire to it at a Dlftance ^ but when we came to 
handle it, we found it too bulky for our Carriage, 
fo we were at a Lofs again : The fecond Scots Man 
was for fetting Fire to the Tent or Hutt, and knock- 
ing the Creatures that were there on the Head when 
they came out •, but 1 could not joyn with that 5 I 
was againft killing them, if it was pollible to be 
avoided : Well then, faid the Scots Merchant, I'll 
tell you v;hat we will do, we will try to take them 
Prifoners, tye their Hands behind them, and make 
them Hand ftill, and fee their Idol deltroy'd. 

As it happened, we had Twine or Packthread 
enough about us, which was uled to tye our Fire- 
Works together with 5 fo we refolved to attack 
thefe People firft, and with as little Nolle as we 
could : The firft Thing we did, we knocked at the 
Door, which iffued juft as we defired it ^ for one 
of their Idol Priefts came to the Door i We imme- 
diately feized upon him, ftop'd his Mouth, and ty'd 
his Hands behind him, and led him to the Idol^ 
where we gagg'd him, that he might not make a 
Noife^ ty'd his Feet alfo together, and left him 
on the Ground. 

Two of us then waited at the Door, expeQing 
that another would come out to lee what the 
Matter was ^ but we waited fo long 'till the third 
Man came back to us 5 and then no Body coming 
out, we knock'd again gently, and immediately 
out came two more, and we ferved them juff in 
the fame manner, but was oblig'd to go all with 
them, and lay them down by the Idol fome Di- 
Sance from one another j when going back, we 

found 



[ 288 3 

found two more were come out to the Doofj 
and a third ftood behind them within the Doors 
We feiz'd the two, and immediately ty'd them, 
when the third flepping back, and crying out, my 
Sots Merchant went in after him, and taking out a 
Compofition we had made, that would only Smoak 
and Stink, he fet Fire to it, and threw it in among 
them 5 by that time the other Scots Man and my 
Man taking Charge of the two Men who were al- 
ready bound, and ty'd together alfo by the Arm, 
led them away to the Idol, and left them there, to 
fee if their Idol woMd relieve them, making haft 
back to us. 

When the Fuze we had thrown in had fill'd the 
Hutt with fo much Smoak, that they were almoft 
fiiffocared, we then threw in a fmal] Leather Bag 
ol another kind, which flam'd like a Candle, and 
following it in, we found there was btit four People 
left, who, it feems, were two Men and two Women, 
andv as we fjppofed, had been about fome of their 
Diaivolick Sacrifices ; They appeared, in (hort, fright- 
ed to Death, at leaft fo as to fit trimbling and flupid, 
and not able to fpeak neither, for the Smoak. 

In a Word, we took them, bound them as we 
had the other, and all without any Noife : I fhould 
have faid, we brought them out of the Houfe or 
Hutt firft 5 for indeed we were not able to bear the 
Smoak any more than they were. When we had 
done this, we carry'd them all together to the Idol : 
When we came there, we fell to work with him 5 
and firft we daub'd him all over, and his Robes alfo, 
with Tar and fuch other Stuff as we had, which 
was Tallow mixM with Brimftone 5 then we ftopp'd 
his Eyes, and Ears, and Mouth full of Gun-powder, 
then we wrapp'd up a great piece of Wild-fire in 
his Bonner, and then flicking all the Combuftibles 
we had brought with us upon him, we look'd about 
to fee if we could find any thing elfe to help to 
burn him, when my Scots Man remembred, that by 

ths 



C ^^9 ] 

the Tent or Hutt where the Men were, there lay a 
heap of dry Forage, whether Straw or Rufhes i do 
not remember ; away he and the other Scots Man 
run, and fetch'd their Arms full of that : vVhen we had 
done this, we took all our Pri Toners, and brought them, 
having unty'd their Feet, andung:?gg'd their Mouths, 
and made them (tand up, and fet them juft before 
their monftrousldol, and then fet fire to the whole. 

We itay'd by it a quarter of an Hour, or therea- 
bouts, 'till the Powder in the Eyes, and Mouth, 
and Ears of the Idol blew up, and as we could per- 
ceive had fplit and deformed the Shape of it 5 and in 
a Word, 'till we law it burn into a meer Block or 
Log of Wood, and then letting the dry Forage to 
it, we found it would be foon quite coniiim'd,'fo 
we began to think of going away ^ but the Scotk 
Man faid no, we muft not go, for thefe poor delud- 
ed Wretches will all throw chemfelves into the Fire, 
and burn themfelves with the Idol 5 fo we refolved 
to ftay 'till the Forage was burnt down too, and 
then we came away and left them. 

In the Morning we appear'd among our Fellow 
Travellers, exceeding bufy, in getting ready for our 
Journey ^ nor could any Man fuggeft that we had 
been any where but in our Beds, as Travellers might 
be fuppos'd to be, to fit themfelves for the Fatigues 
of that Day's Journey. 

But it did not end fo •, for the next Day came a 
great Multitude of the Country People, not only of 
! this Village, but of a hundred more, for ought I 
know, to the Town-Gates, and in a moft ourragioiis 
manner, demanded Satisfaction of the RuJ/ian Gov- 
lernour, for the infolting their Prieits, and burning 
their Great Cham-Chi-Thaipigu, fuch a hard Name 
they gave the monflrous creature they worfhip'd 5 
the People of Nertfimkay^ were at firft in agrearCon» 
fternation, for they faid, the Tartars were no lefs rhan 
thirty ihoufand, and that in a few days moit^ vvould 
be one hundred thoufand itrong. . 

T The 



[ 290 ] 

The Rvjim Governour fent out Meflengers to ap- 
peafe them, and gave them all the good words ima- 
ginable : He aflured them, he knew nothing of ir^ 
and that there had not a Soul of his Garrifon been 
abroad : That it could not be from any Body there 5 
and if they would let him know who it was, they 
(hould be examplarily puniflied. They return'd 
haughtily, that all the Country reverenced the Great 
Cham^Chi-Thamgu^ who dwelt in the Sun, and no 
Mortal would have decreed to offer Violence to his 
image, but fome Chriftian Mifcreant, fo they call'd 
them it leems 5 and they therefore denounced War 
againft him, and all the Rvjlans^ who, they faid, 
were Mifcreants and Chriftians. 

The Governour ftill patient, and unwilling to 
make a Breach, or to have any Caufe of War alledg- 
ed to be given by him^ The Czar having ffraicly 
charged them to treat the conqtier'd Country with 
Gentlenefs and Civiliry, gave them ftill all the good 
Words he could \ at laft he told them, there was a 
Caravan gone towards RuJJia that Morning, and per- 
haps it was fome of them, who had done them this 
Injury ^ and that if they would be fatisfied with that, 
he would fend after them, to enquire into it : This 
leem'd to appeafe them a little 5 and accordingly 
the Governour lent after us, and gave us a particu- 
lar Account how the Thing was ^ intimating withal^ 
that if any in our Caravan had done it, they fhould 
make their Efcape ^ but that whether they had done 
it or no, we fhould make all the haft forward that 
was poffible^ and that in the mean time, he would 
keep them in play as long as he could. 

This was very friendly in the Governour 5 how- 
ever, when it came to the Caravan, there was no 
Body knew any Thing of the Matter 5 and as for 
us that were guilty, we were the lealt of all fufpe- 
fted ^ none fo much asask'd us the Queftion ^ how- 
ever, the Captain of the Caravan for the Time^ 
took the Hint that the Governour gave' us, and we 

marched 



[ 2pl ] 

marched or travelled two Days and two Nights, 
without any confiderable Stop ; and then we lay at 
a Village called Plothus •, nor did we make any long 
Stop here, but haften'd on tow^Ltds JaratPem, zno- 
ther of the Czar of Mufcovyh Colonies, and where 
we expefted we fliould be fafe ; but it is to be ob- 
ferv'd, that here we began for two or three Days 
march, to enter upon a vaft namelefs Defart, of 
which I (hall fay more in its Place ♦, and which, if 
we had now been upon it, 'tis more than probable, 
we had been all detiroy'd : It was the fecond Day's 
march from Fhthus, that by the Clouds of Duft be- 
hind us at a great Dittance, lome of our People be- 
gan to be fenfible we were purfued ^ we had enter'd 
the Defart, and had pafTed by a great Lake call'd 
SchahOfer when we perceivM a very great Body of 
Horfe appear on the other Side of the Lake to the 
North, We travelling Weft : We obferv'd they went 
away Weft as we did, but had fuppofed we would 
have taken that Side of the Lake, whereas, we very 
happily took the South-Side *, and in two Days 
more we faw them not, for they believing we were 
itill before them, pufh'd on, 'till they came to the 
River Udda ^ this is a very great River when it paffes 
farther North ^ but where we came to it, we found 
it narrow, and fordable. 

The third Day they either found their Miftake, 
or had intelligence of us, and came pouring in up- 
on us, towards the Dusk of the Evening ; We had, 
to our great Satisfaftion, juft pitch'd upon a Place 
for our Camp, which was very convenient for the 
Night i for as we were upon a Defart, tho' but at 
the beginning of it, that was above (i\Q hundred 
Adiles over, we had no Towns to Lodge at, and in- 
deed expeOed none but the City Jarawena^ which 
we had yet two Days march to •, the Defart however, 
had fome few Woods in it on this Side, and little 
Rivers, which ran all into the great River Udda : 
It was in a narrow Strait between two litcle, but very 

T 2 thick 



[ 2^2 ] 

thick Woods, th^t we pitch'd our little Catiip for 
^ that Night, expeQing to be attack'd in the Night. 

No body knew but our felves, what we were pur- 
fued for ^ but as it was ufual for the Mongid Tart art 
to go about in Troops in that Defart, fo the Cara- 
vans always fortify thenifelves every Night againft 
them, as againlt Armies of Robbers 5 and it was 
therefore no new thing to be purfued. 

But we had this Night, of all the Nights of our 
Travels, a moft advantageous Camp •, for we lay 
between two Woods, with a little Rivulet running 
juft before our Front •, fo that we could not be fur- 
rounded, or attack'd any way, but in our Front or 
Rear 5 we took care alfo to make our Front as 
ftrong as we could, by placing our Packs, with our 
Camels and Horfes, all in a Line on the Infide of 
the River, and felling fome Trees in our Rear. 

In this Pofiure we encamp'd for the Night, but 
the Enemy was upon us before we had finifh'd our 
Situation : They did not come on us like Thieves as 
tve expe£ted, but fent three Meffengers to us, to de- 
inand the Men to be delivered to them, that had 
abus'd their Prieils, and burnt their God, Cham- 
Chi-Thaimgu with Fire, that they might b ^rn them 
with Fire ^ and upon this, they faid they would go 
away, and do us no farther harm, otherwife, they 
Would burn us all with Fire. Our Men looked very 
felank at this Meflage, and be^an to (tare at one ano- 
ther, to fee who look'd with molt Guilt in their 
Faces % but no Body was the Word, no Body did ito 
The Leader of the Caravan f;nt Word, he was well 
afTur'd, it was not done by any of cur Camp ^ that 
we were peaceable MerchantSj iravelling on our Bu* 
finefs -, that we had done no harm to them, or to 
any one elfe ^ and that therefore they muit look 
farther for their Enemies who had injur'd them^ for 
we were not the People ^ fo defir d them not to 
dilturb us, for if they did, we(hould defend our- 
felves. 

They 




IR-.Cnifoe widiyMufcovite ^arav^aILIiafs^ll5^yDe^aT(:s are uitu' k'J by v Tai (ars.^ 



They were fir from being fatisfy'd with this for 
an AnlWer, but a great Crowd of them came down 
in the Morning by break of Diy to our Camp^ but 
feeing us in fuch an unaccountable Situation, they 
durlt come no farther than the Brook in our Fronr^ 
where they flood and fhew'd us fuch a Number, that 
indeed terrify 'd us very much •, for thofe that ipoke 
iealt of them, fpoke of ten thoufand: Here they 
flood and look'd at us a while, and then fetting up 
a great Howl, they let fly a Cloud of Arrows among 
us ^ but we were well enough fortified for that 5 
for we (helter'd under our Baggage, and I do not 
remember that one Man of us was hurt. 

Some Time after this, we fee them move a little 
to our Right, and expefted them on the Rear, when 
a conning Fellow, a CcJJack^ as they call them, of 
Jarawena.^ in the Pay of the Mitfcovites^ calling to 
the Leader of the Caravan, faid to him, Fll go fend 
all thefe People away to Siheilka-^ this was a City, 
four or five Days Journey at leaft to the Sou'h,f and 
rather behind us : So he takes his Bow and Arrows, 
and getting on Horfe-back, he rides away from our 
Rear dire£ily, as it were back to Nertsfnskay ^ after 
this, betakes a great Circuit about, and comes to 
the Army of the Tartars^ as if he had been fent 
Exprels to tell them a long Story 5 that the People 
who had burnt the Charn ChiJhaungu, were gone to 
Siheiika^ with a Caravan of Mifcreants, as he call'd 
them, that is to fay, Chrifliaos ; and that they had 
refolv'd to burn the God Schallfar^ belonging to the 
Tovgitefes. 

As this Fellow was liimfelf a meet Tartar y and 
perfetlly fpoke their Language, he counterfeited fo 
well, that they aH took it from him, and away they 
drove in a moft violent Hurry to Siheilka^ which it 
feems was five Days Journey to the North, and in 
lefs than three Hours, they were entirely out of our 
Sight, and we never heard zny more of them 5 not 

T 5 ever 



[ 2^4 ] 

ever knew whether they went to that other Place 
called Siheilka^ or no. 

So we pafs'd fafely on to the City of Jarawena^ 
where there was a Garrifon of Mufcovites^ and there 
we retted five Days, the Caravan being exceedingly 
fatigued with the lalt Days hard march, and with 
want of Reft in the Night. 

From this City we had a frightful Defart, which 
held us three and twenty Days march : We fur- 
nifli'd our felves with fome Tents here, for the bet- 
ter accommodating our felves in the Night 5 and 
the Leader of the Caravan, procured (ixteen Car- 
riages or Waggons of the Country, for carrying our 
Water and Provifioijs, and thefe Carriages was our 
Defence every Night round our little Camp ^ fo 
that had the Tartars appeared, unlefs they had been 
very numerous indeed, they would not have been 
able to hurt us. 

We may well be fuppofed to want Reft again after 
this long Journey -, for in this Defart we faw neither 
Houle or Tree^ or Icarce a Bufli 5 we faw abundance 
of the Sable-Hunters, as they called them: Thefe 
are all Tartars of the Movgul Tartayy^ of which this 
Country is a parr, and they frequently attack fmall 
Caravans, but we faw no Numbers of them together: 
I was curious to fee the Sable Skins they catched, 
but could n^ver fpeak with any of them, for they 
durft not come near us, neitherdurft we ftraggle from 
our Company, to go near them. 

After we had pafs'd this Defart, we came into a 
Country pretty well inhabited ^ that is to fay, wq 
found Towns and Caftles, fettled by the Czar of 
Mufcovy, with Garrifons of Stationary Soldiers tq 
proteft the Caravans, and defend the Country a- 
gainft the Tartars^ who would otherwife make it 
very dangerous travelling *, and hisCzarifi Majefty 
has given fuch ftrift Orders for the well guarding the 
Caravans and Merchants, that if there are any Tar* 
tars heard of in the Country, Detachments of the 

G arrifons 



[ 2p5 1 

Garrifons are always fent to lee the Travellers fafe 
from Station to Station. 

And thus the Governour of Ailmhy^ who I had 
Opportunity to make a Vilit to, by means of the 
Scots Merchant who was acquainted with him, of- 
ferM us a Guard of fifty Men, if we thought there 
was any Danger to the next Station. 

I thought long before this, that as we came nearer 
to Europe we flhould find the Country better peo^ 
pled, and the People more civiliz'd, but I found mf 
felf miftaken in both, for we had yet the Nation of 
the Tonguefes to pafs thro' ^ where we faw the fame 
Tokens of Paganifm and Barbarity, or worfe, than 
before, only as they were conquer'd hy the Mufcovi- 
tes^ and entirely reduc'd, they were not lb dange^ 
rous; but for Rudenefs of Manners, Idolatry, and 
Multitheifm no People in the World ever went be- 
yond them : They are cloath'd all in Skins of Beafts^ 
and their Houfes are built of the fame : You know 
not a Man from a Woman, neither hy the Rugged^ 
nefs of their Countenances or their Cioaths ^ and 
in the Winter, when the Ground is cover'd with 
Snow, they live under Ground in Houfes like^VaulrSj 
which have Cavities going from one to another. 

If the Tartars had their Cham-Chi-Thaimgu for a 
whole Village or Country, thefe had Idols in every 
Hutt and in every Cave-, befides they Worfhip the 
Stars, the Sun, the Water, the Snow, and In a word^ 
every thing that they do not underftand, and they un- 
deritand'but \'ery little •, fo that almoit every Ele- 
ment, every uncommon thing, fetsthem a facrlficing. 

But I am ho more to defcribe People than Couo* 
tries, any farther than my own Story comes to be 
concerned in thetn : I met with nothing peculiar m 
my felf in all this Country, which I reckon was 
from the Defart which I fpoke of lafl, at ieail 400 
Miles, half of it being another Defart, which took 
us up twelve Days fevere travelling, without Houfe, 
or Treej, or Bufc, but were obliged again to carry 



[ 25»^ ] 

our own Provifions, as well Water as Bread. After 
we were out of this Defart, and had travell'd two 
Days, we came to Jamzay^ a Mufcovue City or Sta- 
tion, on the greac River Jatiezay : This River they 
told us par'-eH Europe from Afia^ tho' our Map ma- 
kers, as I am luid, d^:* not agree to it 5 however, it 
is certainly the Eaftern Boundary of the ancient Si- 
herla^ which now makes up a Province only of the 
vaft Miifcovite Empire, but is itfelf equal in Bignefs 
to the whole Empire of Germany, 

And yet here 1 obferv'd Ignorance and Paganifra 
Hill prevailed, except in the Mufcwite Gairifons ^ 
all the Country between the R ver Ob) and the Ri- 
ver Janezay is as entirely Pagan, and the People as 
barbarous, as che rem': teft of the Tartars, nay, as 
any Nation for ought I know in Jjia or America ; I 
alio found which I obfervM to the Alufcovite Govern- 
purs who I had Opportunity to converfe with, that 
the poor Pagans are not much the wiier or the near- 
er Chriftianity for being under the A)vfcovite Go- 
vernment 5 which they acknowledged was true 
enough, but, as they faid, was none of their Bufi- 
rels : Thu if the Czar exptSed to convert his Sibe- 
rian,^ or Tovgnefe, or Tartar Subjefls, it (hould be 
done by lenaing Clergymen among them, not Sol- . 
diets ^ and they added, with more Sincerity than I 
expe£led, that they found it was not io much the 
Concern of their Monarch to make the People Chri- 
ftians, as it was to make them SubjeQs. 

From this River to the great River Oby^ we crofs'd 
a wild uncultivated Country ^ I cannot fay 'tis a bar- 
ren oil •, 'tis only barren of People, and good Ma- 
nagement, otherwife it is in itfelf a moft pleafanr, 
fruitful and agreeable Country: What Inhabitants 
t^e found in it are all Pagans, except luch as are 
lent among them from Rvjia ^ for this is the Coun- 
try I mean on both Sides the River Oby,^ whither the 
Mufcovke Criminals, that are not put to Death, are 
banifh'd, and from whence it is next to impoflible they 
fhould ever come away, I have 



[ 25»7 ] 

I have nothing material to fay of my particulat 
y\ffairs, till 1 came to Tobohki, the Capital City of 
Siberia^ where I continued fome time on the fol- 
lowing Occjfion. 

We had been now almoft feven Months on our 
Journey, and Winter began to come on apace ; 
whereupon my Partner and I call'd a Council about 
our particular Affairs, in which we found it proper, 
confideiing that we were bound for Erglavd, and not 
for MiifcoTP^ to confider how to difpofe of ourfelves : 
They told us of Sledges and Raine Deer to carry us 
over the Snow in the Winter lime t, and iideed they 
have fuch things, that it would be incredible to re- 
late the Particulars of, by which means the RvJJiam 
travel more in the Winter than they can in Summer, 
becaule in thefe ^leds they are able to run Night and 
Day 5 the Snow being frozen, is one univerfal Co- 
vering to Nature, by which the Hills, the Vales, the 
Rivers, the Lakes, all are fmooth, and hard as a 
Stone, and they run upon the Surface, without any 
regard to what is underneath. 

But I had no occafion to pufh at a Winter Jour- 
ney of this kind : I was bound to Evglavd, not to 
Mufcow^ and my Rout lay two Ways, either I muft 
go on as the Caravan went 'till i came to Jenjlaw^ 
and then go off Weft for Narva and the Gulph of 
Finland ^ and fo either by Sea or Land to Dantzick^ 
where I might poffibly fell my China Cargo to good 
Advantage, or 1 muit leave the Caravan at a little 
Town on the Dmna^ from whence I had but 
fix Days by Water to Arch-Jtigel^ and from thence 
might be fure of Snipping, either to England^ Hol- 
land, or Hamburgh, 

Now to go any of thefe Journeys in the Winter, 
would have been prepofterous *, for as to Dantzick^ 
the Baltick would be frozen up, and I could not gee 
Paffage, and to go by Land in thofe Countries, 
was far lefs fafe than among the Movgul Tartars ^ 
likewife to go to ArchArgel in OBober^ all the Ships 

would 



C m ] 

would be gone from thence, and even the Merchants 
who dwell there in Summer, retire South to Miifcom 
In the Winter when the Ships are gone ; fo that I 
fhoMld have nothing but Extremity of Cold to en-; 
counter^ with a Scarcity of Provifions, and muft 
lie there in an empty Town all the Winter : So that 
* upon the whole I thought it much my better way to 
let the Caravan go, and to make Provifion to Win- 
ter where I was, (viz.) at TobohM in Siberia^ in the 
Latitude of Degrees, where I was ftjire of three 
Things to wear out a cold Winter with, fi;fz.) Plenty 
of Provifion fuch as the Country afForded -^ a warm 
Honfe, with Fuel enough, and excellent Company ^ 
of all which I fhall give a full Account of ia its Place. 

I was now in a quite different Clinaate from my 
belov'd Ifland, where I never felt Cold except when 
I had my Ague •, on the contrary, I had much to do 
to bear any Cloaths on my Back, and never made 
any Fire but without doors, and for my neceffity ira 
dreffing my Food, Sft.Now I made ibc three goodVefts^^ 
with large Robes or Gowns over them to hang dowr^ 
to the Feet,and button ciofe to the Wrifts, and all thefe 
litfd with Furs to make them fofBciently warm. 

As to a warm Houfe, I muft confefs I greatly dif« 
Mk'd our way in England of making Fires in every 
Room in the Houle, in open Chimneys, which when 
the Fire was out, always kept the Air in the Roona, 
cold as the Climate : Bat taking an Appartment in a 
good HoBfe in the Town, I ordered a Chimney to be 
built like a Furnace, in the Center of fix feveral 
Rooms, like a Stove, the Funnel to carry theSmoak 
went up one Way, the Door to come at the Fire 
went in another, and all the Rooms were kept 
equally warm, but no Fire ik^n ^ like as they heat 
itie Bagnios in Enghfid, 

By this means we had always the fjme Climate in 
all the Rooms, and an equal Heat was preferv'd ^ 
and how cold foever it was without, it was always 
warm within, and yet we faw no Fire, nor was ever 
incommoded with any Smoak. The 



[ 2^p 1 

The moft wonderful thing of all was, that it 
fliould be poffible to meet with good Connpan7 
here, in a Country fo barbarous as that of the moft 
Northerly Parts of Europe, near the frozen Ocean, 
and within but a very few Degrees of Nova Zcmbla.- 
But this being the Country where tie State Cri- 
minals of Miifcovy, as I obferv'd before, are all ba- 
nifli'd, this City was full of Noblemen, Princes, Gen- 
tlemen, Colonels, and in (hort all Degrees of the No- 
bility, Gentry, Soldiery and Courtiers of Mvfcovyi 
Here was the famous Prince Gallftozen, the old Ge- 
neral Robojiiski, and feveral other Ferfons of note, 
and fome Ladies. 

By means of my Sects Merchant, who neverthe- 
lefs I parted with here, I made an Acquaintance 
here with feveral of thefe Gentlemen, and lome of 
them of the firft Rank, and from thefe in the long 
Winter Nights in which I ftay'd here, I received fe- 
veral very agreeable Vifits : It was talking one Night 

with Prince one of the banifh'd Minifters 

of State belonging to the Czar of Mufcovy, that my 
Talk of my particular Cafe began : He had been teU 
ling me abundance of iinQ Things of the Greatnefs, 
the Magnificence, the Dominions, and the abfolure 
Power of the Emperor of the Rvffiavs, I interrupt- 
ed him, and told him I was a greater and more 
powerful Prince than ever the Czar of Mvfcovy was, 
the' my Dominions were not fo large, or my Peo- 
pie fo many. The Riifmt Grandee lock'd a little 
furpiz'd, and fixing his Eyes Iteddily upon me, be- 
gan to wonder what I meant. 

I told him, his Wonder would ceafe when I had 
explained myielf : Firft, / told him, I had the abfo- 
lure Difpofal of the Lives and Fortunes of all my 
SubjeSs : That notwithftanding my abfolute Power, 
I had not one Perfon difafFefted to my Government, 
or to my Perfon, in aD my Dominions. He Oiook 
his Head at that, and faid, there indeed 1 outdid the 
Czar of Mufcovy. I told him^ That all the Lands in 
\ my 



[ 



300 



my Kingdom were my own, and all my SubjeQs 
were not only my Tenants, but Tenants at Will : 
That they would all fight for me to the laft Drop ^ 
and that never Tyrant, forfuch I acknowledged myfelf 
ta be, was ever fo univerfally beloved, and yet fo 
horribly feared by his Subjetts. 

After amufing them with thefe Riddles in Go- 
vernment for a while, I open'd the Cafe, and told 
them the Story at large of my living in the Ifland, 
and how I managed both myfelf and the People 
there that were under me, juft as I have fince mi- 
nuted it down. They were exceedingly taken with 
the Story, and efpecially the Prince, who told me 
with a Sigh, that the true Greatnefs of Life was to 
be Mafter of ourfelves: That he would not have ex- 
changed fuch a State of Life as mine, to have been 
Czar of Mtifcovy-^ and that he found more Felicity 
in the Retirement he feemM to be baniffii'd to there, 
than ever he found in the highelt Authority he en-= 
joy'd in the Court of his Mafter the Czar : That 
the Heighth of human Wifdom was to bring our 
Tempers down to our Circumftances-, and to make 
a Calm within, under the Weight of the greateft 
Storm without. When he came firft hither, he /aid 
he uied to tear the Hair from his Head, and the 
Cloaths from his Back, as others had done before 
him ; but a little Time and Confideration had made 
him look into himfeif, as well as round himfelf, to 
things without 5 Thar he fouud the Mind of Man, 
if it was but once brought to refle£t upon the State 
of univerfal Life, and how little this World was 
concerned in its truij Felicity, was perfedly capable 
of making a Felicicy for itfelf, fuliy fatisfying to 
itfelf, and fuitable to its Owvii hsit Eads and De- 
fires, with but very little Affiftance from the World : 
That Air to breath in. Food to fulfain Life, Cloaths 
for Warmth, and Liberty for Exercife in order to 
Health, compleated, in his Opinion, all that the 
World could do for uSj and tho' the Greatnefs, the 

Authority, 



i 301 ] 

Authority, the Riches, and the Pleafures which 
fome enjoy 'd in the World, and which he had en- 
joy'd his Share of, had much in them that was agree- 
able to us, yet he oblerved that all thofe things 
chiefly gratify'd the coarfeft of our AfFetlions^ fuch 
as our Ambition, our particular Pride, our Avarice, 
our Vanity, and our Senfuality 5 all which were 
indeed the meer Produ£t of the worft part of Man, 
were in themfelves Crimes, and had in them the 
Seeds of all manner of Crime, but neither were re- 
lated to, or concern'd with any of thole Virtues 
that conftltuted us wife Men, or of thofe Graces 
which diftinguifh'd us as Chriftians : That being 
now deprived of all the fancy'd Felicity, which he 
enjoy'd in the full Exercile of all thofe Vices, he 
faid he was at leifure to look upon the dark Side 
of them, where he found all manner of Deformity 5 
and was now convinced, that Virtue only makes a 
Man truly Wife, Rich, and Great, and preferves 
him in the way to a foperior Happinefs in a fu- 
"ture State. And in this, he faid^ they were more 
happy in their Baniflimenr, than all their Enemies 
were, who had the full Poffeflion of all the Wealtn 
and Power that they (the Baniii/d) had left behind 
them. 

Nor, SiT^fays he^ do I bring my Mind to this 
politically, by the Neceflity of my Circumitances, 
which fome call miferabie ; but if! know any thing 
of my felf, I would not noiv go back, no not tho' 
the Czar, my MaRer, fhould call me, and offer to 
te-inftate me in all my former Grandeur 5 I lay, I 
would no more go back ro it, than I believe my 
Soul, when it fhall be delivered from this Prifon 
of the Body, and has had a Tafte of the glorious 
State beyond Life, would cqidq back to the Jayl of 
Flefh and Blood it is now inclos'd in, and leave 
Heaven to deal in the Dirt and Crime of human 
Affairs*

He fpoke this with fo much Warmth m his 
Temper, fo much Earneftnels and Motion of his 
Spirits, which were apparent in his Countenance, 
that it was evident it was the true Senfe of his 
Soul : And indeed there was no room to doubt his 
Sincery. 

I told him, I once thought myfelf a kind of a 
Monarch in my eld Station, of which I had given 
him an Account, but that I thought he was not a 
Monarch only, but a great Conqueror 5 for that he 
that has got a Viftory over his own exorbitant De- 
fires, and has the abfolute Dominion over himfelf, 
whofe Reafon entirely governs his Will, is certainly 
greater than he that conquers a City But, my Lord, 
faid J, (hall I take the Liberty to ask you a Quefti- 
on ? With all my Heart, fays he^ If the Door of 
your Liberty was open'd, faid /, would you not 
take hold of it to deliver yourfelf from this 
Exile. 

Hold, faid he^ your QueRion is fubtle, and re- 
quires fome ferious juft Dlftinftions, to give it a fin- 
cere Anfwer 5 and 111 give it you from the Bottom 
of my Heart. Nothing that I know of in this 
World would move me to deliver myfelf from this 
State of Banifhment, except thefe two, Firft, the 
Enjoyment of my Relations, and Secondly, a little 
warmer Climate ^ but I proteft to you, that to go 
back to the Pomp of the Court, the Glory, the Pow- 
er, the Hurry of a Minifter of State, the Wealth, 
the Gaiety, and the Pleafures, that is to fay ^ Follies 
of a Courtier 5 if my Mafter fhould fend me Word 
this Moment, that he rettores me to all he banifh'd 
me from ^ I proteft. If Ihiow myfelf at all^ I would 
not leave this Wildernefs, thefe Defarts, and thefe 
frozen Lakes, for the Palace at Mvfcow. 

But, my Lord^ faid /, perhaps you not only are 
banifh'd trom the t'leafures of the Court, and from 
the Power, and Authority, and Wealth you enjoy'd 
before ^ but you may be abfenc too from fome of the 

Cori- 



[ 3^3 1 



Gonvenlences of Life, your Eftate perhaps confifcat- 
€d and your Effe£ts plundered, and the Supplies left 
you here may not be fuliable to the ordinary De- 
mands of Life. 

Ay, fays he, that is as you fuppofe me to be a 
Lord, or a Prince, ^c. So indeed I am •, but you 
are now to confider me only as a Man ; a human 
Creature, not at all diftingur(h'd from another 5 and 
fo I can fuffer no Want, unlefs I Oiould be viijted 
with Sicknefs and Diftempers. However, to put 
the Queflion out of Difpute ^ you fee our Manner \ 
we are in this Place five Perfons of Rank we live per- 
feftly retir'd, as fuited to a State of Banifhment^ 
we have ibmething refcu'd from the Shipwreck of 
our Fortunes, which keeps us from the meer Necef- 
fity of hunting for our Food •, but the poor Soldiers 
who are here, without that Help, live in as much 
Plenty as we, who go into the Woods and catch Sa- 
bles and Foxes •, the Labour of a Month will main- 
tain them a Year ^ and as the Way of living is noc 
expenfive, fo it is not hard to get fufScient to our- 
felves. So that Obje£tion is out of Doors. 

I have not room to give a full Account of the moft 
agreeable Converfation I had with this truly great 
Man 5 in all which he (IiewM, that his Mind was 
fo infplr'd with a fuperior Knowledge of Things, fo 
fupported by Religion, as well as by a vaft Share 
of Wifdom-, that his Contempt of the World was 
really as much, as he had exprefs'd, and that he 
was always the fame to the lalt^ as will appear in 
the Story I am going to tell. 

I had been here 8 Months, and a dark dreadful 
Winter I thought it to be, the Cold fo intenfe that 
I could not fo much as look abroad withouc being 
wrapt in Furs, and a Mask of Fur before my Face, 
or rather a Hood with only a Hole for Breath, and 
two for Sight: The little Day-light we had, was, 
as we reckoned, for three Months, not above five 
Hours a day, and fix at molt 5 only that the Snow 

lying 



[ 304 ] 

lying on the Ground continually, and the Weather 
clear, it was never quite dark : Our Horfes were kept 
(oT rather ftarv'd) under Ground, and as for our 
Servants, for we hir'd three Servants here, to look 
after our Horfes and felves, we had every now and 
then their Fingers and Toes to thaw and take care of, 
left they fhould mortify and fall off. 

Itjs true, within Doors we were warm, the Hou- 
fes being clofe, the Walls thick, the Lights fmall, 
and the Glafs all double: Our Food was chiefly the 
Flefh of Deer dry'd and cur'd in the Seafon 5 good 
Bread enough, but bak'd as Biskets ^ dry'd Fifti of 
feveral Sorts, and fome Flefh of Mutton, and of 
the Buffeloes, which is pretty good Beef: All the 
Stores of Provifion for the Winter are laid up in the 
Summer, and well cur'd 5 our Drink was Water 
mix'd with Aqua-vira: inftead of Brandy, and for a 
Treat, Mead inftead of Wine, which, however, they 
have excellent good : TheHunters,who venture abroad 
all Weathers, frequently brought us in frefh Venif- 
on, very fat and good, and fometimes Bears FJefii, 
but we did not much care for the laft : We had a 
good Stock of Tea, with which we treated our 
Friends, as above 5 and in a word, we liv'd very 
chearfully and well, all things confider'd. 

It was now March ^ the Days grown confiderably 
longer, and the Weather, at leaft, tolerable 5 fo 
other Travellers began to prepare Sleds to carrv them 
over the Snow, and to get things ready to be going ; 
bur my Meafures being fix'd, as 1 have faid, for 
Arch-Angel^ and not for Mufcovy or the Baltkk^ I 
made no Motion ^ knowing very well that the Ships 
from the South do not fer out for that Part of the 
World till Ma) or Jmte^ and that if I was there by 
the beginning of y^vgujl^ it would be as foon as any 
Ships would be ready to go away 5 and therefore, I 
fay, I made no hafte to be gone, as others did ^ in a 
word, I faw a great many People, nay, all the Tra- 
vellers go away before me: It feems every Year they 

go 



[ 305 ] 

go from thence to Mvfcow for Trade, (vh.) to car- 
ry Furs, and buy Neceflaries with them, which 
they bring back to iurnifh their Shops ^ alio 
others went of ihe fame Errand to Arch-Avget^ but 
then they alfo being to come back again above 800 
Miles, went all out before me. 

In fhort, about the latter End of May I began to 
make all ready to pack up ^ and as I was doing this, 
it occur r'd to me, that feeing all thefe People were 
banifh'd by the Czar of Mnfcovy to Siberia^ and yet 
when they came there, were left at Liberty to go 
whither they would 5 why did they not then go 
away to any Parr of the World wherever they rhought 
fit ? and I began to examine what fhould hinder 
them from making fuch an Attempt* 

But my Wonder was over, when I entered upon 
that Subjeft with the Ferfon I have mention'd, who 
anfwer'd me thus : Confider, Firft, Sir, faid he, the 
Place where we are ^ and Secondly, the Condition we 
are in^ efperially, faid h^theGeneralliiy of thePeoplie 
who are banilh'd hither •, we are furrounded, faid he, 
with ftronger Things than Bars and Bolts ^ on the 
North Side an unnavigable Ocean, where Ship never 
fail'd, and Boat never fwam^ neither, if we had 
both, could we know where to go with them : Eve- 
ry other Way, faid he, we have above a rlioufand 
Miles to pafs thro' the Czar's own Dominions, and 
By Ways utterly unpaflible, except by the Roads 
made by the Government, and thro' the Towns gar- 
rifon'd by his Troops ^ fo that we could neither 
pafs undifcover'd by the Road, or fobfilt any othgr 
Way ; fo that it is in vain to attempt it. 

I was fiienc'd indeed at once, and found that they 
were in a Prifon, every Jot as fecure as if they had 
been lock'dup in the Caitle at Miijcow-^ However, it 
came into my Thoughts, that I mi^h^ cefrainly be 
made an Inftrument to procure the ricape of this 
excellent Perfon, and that whatever Hazard 1 ri?n, I 
would certainly try if I couid carry hirii ofF. Opon 

U this 



[ 30^ ] 

this I took an Occafion one Evening to tell him my 
Thoughts : I reprefented to him, that it was ve- 
ry eafy for me to carry him away, there being no 
Guard over him in the Country ^ and as I was not 
going to Miifcon?^ but to Arch-Angel^ and that I 
went in the nature of a Caravan, by which I was 
nor oblig'd to lye in the ftationary Towns in the 
Defart, but could encamp every Night where I 
would, we might eafily pafs uninterrupted, to 
Arch' Angela where 1 would immediately fecure him 
on board an Englijb or Dutch Ship, and carry him 
oflF fafe along with me •, and as to his Subfiftence^ 
and other Particulars, that fhould be my Care, 'till 
he could better fupply himfelf 

He heard me very attentively, and look'd earneft- 
ly on me all the while I fpoke i nay, I could fee in 
his very Face, that what I faid put his Spirits into 
an exceeding Ferment ^ his Colour frequently 
chang'd, his Eyes look'd red, and his Heart flut- 
ter'd, that it might be even perceiv'd in his Counte- 
nance 5 nor could he immediately anfwer me : When 
I had done, and as it were expefted what he would 
fay to it J and after he had paus'd a little he em- 
braced me, and faid how unhappy are we ! unguard- 
ed Creatures as we are, that even our greatefts A£ls 
of Friendftiip are made Snares to us, and we are 
made Tempters of one another! My dear Friend, 
faidhe^ your Offer is fo fincere, has fuch Kindnefe 
in it, is fo diiinterefted in icfelf, and is fo calculated 
for my Advantage, that I muft have very little. 
Knowledge of the World, if I did not both won- 
der at it, and acknowledge the Obligation I have 
upon me to you for it : But did you believe I was 
fincere in what I have fo often faid to you of my 
Contempt of the World ? Did you believe 1 fpoke 
my very Soul to you, and that I had really obtained 
that Degree of Felicity here, that had plac'd me a- 
bove all that the World could give me, or do for 
me ? Did you believe I was fincerej when I told 

you 



^ 307 3 

you I would not go back, if I was re-cal?d even 
ro be al], that once I was, in the Court and with 
the Favour of the Czar my Matter ? Did you believe 
me, my Friend, to be an honeft Man, or did you 
think me to be a boafting Hypocrite ? Here he flop- 
ped, as if he would hear whar I would fay, but in- 
deed, I foon after perceiv'd, that he ftopp'd becaufe 
his Spirits were in Motion, his great Heart was full 
of Struggles, and he could not go on : I was, I con- 
fefs, aftonifh'd at the thing as well as at the Man, 
and I us'd fome Arguments with him to urge him to 
fet himfelf free : That he ought to look upon this 
as a Door opened by Heaven for his Deliverance ^ and 
a Summons by Providence, who as the Care and 
Difpofition of all Events, to do himfelt good, and 
to render himfelf ufeful in the World. 

He had bv this time recovered himfelf : How do 
you know Sir, fays he warmly, that inftead of a 
Summons from Heaven, it may be a Feint of ano- 
ther Indrument > Reprefenting in all the alluring 
Colours to me the Shew of Felicity as a Deliverance^ 
which may in itfelf be my Snare, and tends direftly 
ro my Ruin : Here I am free from the Temptation 
of returning to my former miferableGreatnefs ^ there 
I am not fure, bur that all the Seeds of Pride, Am- 
bition, Avarce and Luxury, v\^hich I know remain 
in Nature, may revive and take Root, and in a 
Word, again overwhelm me, and then the happy 
Prifoner, who you lee now Matter of his Soul's Li- 
berty, fhall be the miferable Slave of his own Sen- 
fcSy in the Full of all perfonal Liberty : Dear Sir, 
let me remain in this blefTed Confinemsot, banifli'd 
from the Crimes of Life, rather than purchafe a 
Shew of Freedom, at the Expence of the Liberty 
of my Reafon, and at the Expence of the fnture 
Happinefs which now i have in my View, buc fhali 
then, 1 fear, quickly lofe Sight of it •, for 1 am hut 
Flefh, a Man, a meer Man, have Paffions and Af- 
fe£tions as likely to poffefs and overthrow m'e as 

U 2 any 



[ 3o8 ] 

any Man : be not my Friend, and my Tempter 
both together ! 

If I was furpriz'd before, I was quite dumb now, 
and flood filent, looking at him, and indeed admir'd 
at what I faw ; the Struggle in his Soul was fo great, 
that tho' the Weather was extreamly cold, it put 
him into a moft violent Sweat, and I found he 
wanted to give Vent to his Mind ^ fo 1 faid a Word 
or two, that I would leave him to confider of it^ 
and wait on him again, and then I withdrew to my 
own Apartment. 

About two Hours after I heard fome Body at, or 
near, the Door of my Room, and I was going to 
open the Door, but he had opened it, and came in : 
My dear Friend, fa)s he^ you hadalmoft overfet me, 
but I am recovered j do not take it ill that I do not 
clofe with your Offer, I aflure you, 'tis not for want 
of a Senfe of the Kindnefs of it in you, and I came 
to make the moft fincere Acknowledgment of it to 
you ; but I hope I have got the Viftory over myfelf. 

My Lord, faid /, I hope you are fully fatisfy'd 
that you do not refift the Call of Heaven. Sir, faid 
he^ if it had been from Heaven, the fame Power 
would have infiiuenc'd me to accept it ; but I hope, 
and am fully latisfy'd, that it is from Heaven that I 
decline ir, and I have an infinite Satisfdftion in the 
Parting, that you fhall leave me an honefl Man ftillj 
tho' not a free Man. 

I had nothing to do but to acquiefce, and make 
Profeflions to him of my having no End in it, but a 
fincere Defire to ferve him : He embraced me very 
paflTionately, and aiTur'd me, he was fenfible of that, 
and fhould always acknowledge ir, and with that he 
ofFer'd me a very fine Prefent of Sibles, too much 
indeed for me to accept, from a Man in his Circum- 
fiances, and 1 would have avoided them, but he 
would not be refused. 

The next Morning I fent my Servant to his Lord- 
Chip, with a fmall Prefent of Tea, two Pieces of 

China I 



[ 3^9 1 

Chlm Damask, and four little Wedges of Jaiia^ 
Gold, which did not all weigh above fix Ounces ^ 
or thereabout, but were far fhort of the Value of 
his Sables, which, indeed, when I came to Evglavd^ 
I found worth near 200 I He accepted the Tea, 
and one Piece of the Damask, and one of the Pieces 
of Gold, which had a fine Stamp upon it, of the 
Japan Coinage, which 1 found he took for the 
Rariety of it, but would not take anv more ^ and fent 
Word by my Servant that he defired to fpeakwith me. 

When I came to him, he told me, I knew what 
had pafs'd between us, and hop'd I would not 
move him any more in that Affair ^ but that fince I 
made fuch a generous Ofier to him, he ask'd me, 
if I had Kindnefs enough to offer the fame to an- 
other Perfon that he would name to trie, in whom he 
had a great Share of Concern^ I told him, that I could 
not fay I enclin'd to do fo much for any one but him- 
felf, lor whom 1 had a perticular Value, and fhould 
havebeen glad to have been the Infcrument of his De- 
liverance i however, if he would pleafe to name the 
Perfon to me, I would give him my Anfwer, and 
hop'd he would not be difpleafed with me, if he was 
with my Anfwer : He told me, it was only his Son, 
who, tho' I had not feen, yet was in the fame Condi- 
tion with himfelf, and above two hundred Miles 
from him, on the other Side theO^y^ but that if I 
confented, he would fend for him. 

I made no Hefitation, but told him I would do 
it: I made fome Ceremdny in letting him under* 
ftand that it was wholly on his Account, and 
that feeing I could not prevail on him, I would 
(hew my Refpeft to him, by my Concern for his 
Son 5 bat thefe Things are to tedious to repeat 
here ; He fent away the next Day for his Son, and 
in about Twenty Days he came back with the 
MefTenger, bringing fix or feven Horfes, loaded 
with V9ry rich Furs, and which in the whole^ 
amounted to a very great Value. 

• U ^ His 



[ 3IO ] 

His Servants brought the Horfes into the Town 
but left the young Lord at a Diftance, till Nigh t 
when he came incognito into our Apartment, and 
his Father prefented him to me ^ and in fhort, we 
concerted there the manner of our travelling, and 
every Thing proper for the Journey. 

I had bought a confiderable Quantity of Sa- 
bles, black Fox Skins, fine Ermines, and fuch 
other Furs as are very rich •, 1 fay, I had bought them 
in thdc Gity in Exchange for feme of the Goods 
brought from China ; in particular for the Cloves 
and Nutmegs, of which, I fold the greateft Part 
here, and the reft afterwards at Arch-Angel^ for a 
much better Price than I could have dons at Lon- 
don 5 and my Partner who was fenfible of the Profit, 
and whofe Bufinefs more particularly than mine 
was Merchandile, was mightily pleas'd with our 
Stay, on Account of the Traffick we made here. 

it was the beginning of Jime^ when I left this 
remote Place, a City, I believe, little heard of in 
the World ^ and indeed it is fo far out of the 
Road of Commerce, that I know not how it fhould 
be much talk'd cf. We were now come to a very 
fmall Caravan, being only thirty two Horfes and 
Camels in all, and all of them pafs'd for mine, tho' 
my new Gueft vi^as Proprietor of eleven of them 5 
it was moll natural alfo that 1 (hould take more 
Servants with me than I had before, and the young 
Lord pafs'd for my Steward ^ what great Man I 
pafs'd for my felf, I know nor, neither did it con- 
cern mc; CO enquire •, we had here, the worlt and the 
largelt Defart to pafs over that we met with in all 
the Jourrey ^ indeed I call it the worft, becaufe 
the Way was very deep in fome Places, and very- 
uneven in others ^ the beft we had to fay for it, was, 
that we thought we had no Troops of Tartars and 
Robbers to fear, and that they never came on this 
Side the River Oly^ or at leaft, but very feldomj 
but we found it otherwife. 

My 



[311] 

My young Lord had with him, a faithful Mufco- 
vite Servant, or rather a Siberian Servant, who was 
perfe£lly acquainted with the Country ^ and who, 
led us by private Roads, that we avoided coming 
in to the principal Towns and Cities, upon the great 
Road, fuch as Tumen^ Soly-Kainshi^ and feveral 
others ^ becaufe the Mvfcovite Garrlfons which are 
kept there, are very curious and firift in their Ob- 
fervation upon Travellers 5 and ferching leaft any 
of the banifh'd Perfons of Note fhonid make their 
Efcape that Way into Mnfcovy ^^ but by this means 
as we were kept out of the Cities, fo our whole 
Journey was a Defert, and we were oblig'd to en- 
camp and lye in our Tents, when we might have 
had very good Accommodation in the Cities on 
the Way : This the young Lord was fo fenfible of, 
that he would not allow us to lye abroad, when we 
came to feveral Cities, on the Way, but lay abroad 
himfelf with his Servant in the Woods, and met 
us always at the appointed Places. 

We were juft enter'd Europe^ having pafs'd the 
River Kama^ which in thefe Parts, is the Boundary 
between Europe and Jp.^ and the firft City on the 
European Side was call'd Sohy-Kamaskoy, which is 
as much as to fay, the great City, on the River 
Kama ^ and here we thought to have feen feme evi- 
dent Alteration in the People, their Manoer, their 
Habit, their Religion, and their Bofinefs •, but we 
were miftaken, for as we had a valt Defart to pafs^ 
which by Relation, is near fQVQn hundred Miles long 
in lome Places, but not above two hundred Miles 
over where we pafs'd it y fo till we came pait that 
horrible Place, we found very little DiiFerence be- 
tween that Country and the Mogul TaHary •, the Peo- 
ple, moftly Pagans, and little better than the Sava-^ 
ges of America ^ their Houfes and Towns fail of 
Idols, and their Way of Living wholly barbarous, 
except in the Cities as above, and the Villages near 
them 5 where they are Chriftians as they call them- 
Us fdyes-^ 



[ 512 > 

felves^ of the Greek Church ^ but even thefe have 
their Religion mingled with fo many Reliques of 
Superftition, that it is fcarce to be known in tome 
Places from meer Socery and Witchcraft. 

In paffing this Forrett,! thought indeed we mutt, 
after all our Dangers were in our Imagination 
efcap'd, as before, have been plunder'd and robVd, 
and perhaps murther'd by a Troop of Thieves 5 of 
what Country they were, whether the roving B nds 
of the Oftiachi. a Kind of Tartars^ or wild People 
on the Bark of the Ob'i^ had raug'd thus far, or 
whether they were the Sable-Hunters of Siberia^ I 
am yet at a Lofs to know ^ but they were all on 
Horlebick, carry'd Bows and Arrows, and were at 
firtt ab'Ut five and forty in Number ^ they came 
16 near to us, as within about two Mufquet Shot, 
?nd asking no Quefiions, they furrounded us with 
thtir Horfe, and look'd very earnefily upon us twice-, 
at length they plac'd themfelves jutt in our Way, 
upon which, we drew up in a litde Line befour our 
Camels, being not above fixieen Men in allj and 
being drawn up thus, we halted and fent cut the 
Siberian Servant, who attended his Lord, to fee who 
they were ^ his Mafter was the more willing to let 
him go, becaufe he was not a little apprehenfive, 
that they were a Sihsrian Troop fent out after him: 
The Man came up near them vixih a Flag of 
Truce, and call'd to them ^ but tho' he fpoke fe- 
veral of their Languages or DialeSs of Languages 
rather, he could not underftand a Word they faid ^ 
however, after fome Signs to him, not to come 
nearer to them at his Peril-, fo he faid he under- 
ftood them to mean oflFering to fhoot at him if he 
advanc d 5 the Fellow came back no wifer than he 
went, only that bv their Drels, he iiid, be believ'd 
them to be fome Tartars of Kalmuck^ or of the Gr- 
cajfian Hoords ^ and that there mult be more of them 
upon the great Defart, tho' he never heard that 
any of them ever were feen fo far North before. 

This 



C 313 ] 

This was fmall Comfort to us •, however, we had 
no Remedy •, there was on our left Hand at about 
a Quarter of a Mile's Diftance, a little Grove or 
Clunnp of Trees which Itood clofe together, and 
very near the Road ^ I immediately relolv'd we 
would advance to thofe Trees, and fortify ourfelves 
as well as we could there •, for firli I confidered, 
that the Trees would in a great Meafure cover us 
from their Arrows, and in the next Place, they could 
not come to charge us in a Body •, it was indeed my 
oid Fortiiguefe Pilot who propofed it, and who had 
this Excellency attending him, namely, that he was 
always leadieft and moft apt to direa anl encourage 
us in Caies of the moft Danger ; we advanced 
immediately with what Speed we could, and gain'd 
that little Wood, the Tartars or Thieves,for we knew 
not what to call them, keeping their Stand, and 
not attempting to hinder us : When we came thi« 
ther, we fjund to our great Satisfaftion, that it 
was a fwampy fpringy Piece of Ground, and on 
the one Side, a very great Spring of Water, which 
running out in a little Rill or Brook, was a little 
farther, join'd by another of the like Bignefs, and 
was in (hort, the Head or Source of a confiderable 
River, call'd afterwards the JHrtska 5 the Trees 
which grew about this Spring, were not in all above 
two hundred, but were very large, and flood pretty 
thick ^ fo that asfoon as we got in, we faw ourfelves 
perfeflly fafe from the Enemy, unlefs they alighted 
and attack'd us on Foot, 

But to make this more difficult, our Fortiigveze^ 
with indefatigable Application, cut down great Arms 
of the Trees, and laid them hanging not cut quite oJ[ 
from one Tree to another, fo that he made a conti- 
nued Fence almoft round us. 

We ftay'd here waiting the Motion of the Enemy 
fome Hours, without perceiving they made any o^ 
fer to fiir ^ when about two Hours before Night, 
they came down direftly upon us^ and tho' we had 

not 



[ 3H ] 

not perceiv'd it, we found they had been join'd hy 
fome more of the fame, fo that they were near 
fourfcore Horfe, whereof however, we fancy'd fome 
were Women : They came on till they were within 
half Shot of our little Wood, when we fir'd one 
Mufquet without Ball, and call'd to them in the 
Ruf/ian Tongue, to know what they wanted, and bid 
them keep off ^ but as if they knew nothing of 
what we faid they came on with a doable Fury di- 
reftly up to the Wood fide, not imagining we were 
fo barricado'd that they could not break in ^ our old 
Pilot was our Captain, as well as he had been our | 
Engineer^ and defir'd of us, not to fire upon them 1 
till they came within Piftol-Shot, and that we might 
be fure to kill, and that when we did fire, we fhould 
be liire to take good Aim ^ we bad him give the 
Word of Command ^ which he delay'd fo long, 
that they were fome of them within two Pikes 
length of us when we fir'd. 

We aim'd fo true. Cor Providence directed our 
Shot fo furej that we kill'd fourteen of them, at 
the firft Volley, and wounded feveral others, as alfo 
feveral of their Horfes^ for we had all of us loadedjour 
Pieces with two or three Bullets a pelce at leaft. 

They were terribly furpriz'd with our Fire, and 
retreated immediately about one Hundred Rods 
from us 5 in which Time, we loaded our Pieces 
again, and feeing them keep that Diftance, we fal- 
ly'd out and catch'd four or five of their Horfes, 
whole Riders we fuppos'd, were kill'd, and coming 
up to the dead, we could eafily perceive they were 
Tartars, bat knew not from what Country, or how 
they came to make an Excurfion fuch an unufual 
Lengrh. 

About an Hour after they made a Motion to at- 
tack us again, and rode round our little Wood, to 
fee where elfe rhey might break in j but finding us 
always ready to Face them, they went off again, and 
we refolv'd not to ftir from the Place for that Night. 

We 



[ 315 ] 

We flepc iittle you may be fure, but fpent the 
moft Part of the Night in ftrengthning our Situati- 
on, and barricadoing the Entrances into the Wood, 
and keeping a lirid Watch, we waited for Day- 
Lighr, and when it came, it gave us a very unwel- 
come Dilcovery indeed j for the Enemy, who we 
thought were difcouraged with the Reception they 
had met with, were now encreas'd to no lefs than 
three hundred, and had fet up eleven or twelve Huts 
and Tents, as if they were refolv'd to befiege us j 
and this little Camp they had pirch'd upon the open 
Plain, at about three Quarters of a Mile from us. 
We were indeed liirpriz'd at this Difcovery •, and 
now I confels, I gave myfelf over for loft, and all 
that I had , The Lofs of my Effefts did not lye Co 
near me, (tho^ they were very corjiderable) as the 
Thoughts of falling into the Hands of fuch Barhri- 
ans^ at the latter End of my Journey, after fo many 
Difficulties and Hazards as I had gone thro' •, and 
even in Sight of our Port, where we expefted Safe- 
ty and Deliverance 5 as for my Partner, he was ra- 
ging ^ he declared, that to lofe his Goods would be 
his Ruin 5 and he would rather die than be itarv'd 5 
and he was for fighting to hit the Drop. 

The young Lord, as gallant as ever Flefli fhew'd 
Itfelf, was for fighting to the laft alfo ^ and my old 
Pilot was of the Opinion we were able to refift them 
all, in the Situation we then were in ; and thus we 
fpent the Day in Debates of what we (hould do ^ but 
towards Evening, we found that the Number of our 
Enemies ftill encreasM, perhaps as they were 
abroad in feveral Parties for Prey ^ the firft had fent 
out Scouts to call for Help, and to acquaint them 
of the Booty, and we did not know, but by the 
Morning rhey might ftill be a greater Number 5 fo 
I began to enquire cf thofe People we had brought 
from Tobohki^ if there was no other, or more pri- 
vate Ways hy which we might avoid them in the 

Night,

Night, and perhaps either retreat to fomeTown, of 
get Help to guard us over the Defart. 

The Syberlan, who was Servant to the young Lord, 
told us, if we defign'd to avoid them and not fight, 
lie would engage to carry us off in the Night, to a 
Way that went North towards the River Fetrou^ by 
which he made no Queftion, hue we might get a- 
way, and the Tartars never the wifer ^ but he faid, 
Ills Lord had told him, he would not retreat, but 
would rather chufe to fight. I told him, he mif- 
fook his Lord, for that he was too wife a Man to 
love fighting for the fake of it ^ that I knew his 
Lord was brave enough by what he had fliew'd al» 
ready 5 but that his Lord knew better, than to de- 
fire to have feventeen or eighteen Men fight five hm- 
dred, unlels an unavoidable Neceffiry forc'd them to 
it 5 and that if he thought it poiTible for us to efcjpe 
in the Night, we had nothing elle to do but to at- 
tempt k. He anfwer'd if his Lord gave him fuch 
Orders, he would lofe his Life if he did not per- 
form it ; we foon brought his Lord to give that Or- 
der, tho' privately, and u'e immediately prepared 
for the putting it in Praftiee. 

And fir[t,as foon as it began to be dark, we kind- 
led a Fire in our little Camp, which we kept burn- 
ing, and prepared fo as to make it burn all Nighty 
that iheTartars might crinclude we were ftill there ^ 
tut as foon as it was dark, fthat is to fay) fo as we 
could lee the Staii> (for our Guide would not Qlt 
before) having all our Horfes and Camels ready 
loaden, we followed our new Guide, who I foon 
found fteer'd himfelf by the Pole, or North Star, all 
the Country being level for a long Way. 

After we had travell'd two Hours very bard, it 
l)egan to be lighter fliil, not that it was quite dark 
all N'ght, but the Moon began to rife, fo that in 
ftiorv, it was rather lighter than we wifli'd it to be ; 
hm by fix a Clock the next Morning we were gotten 
near forty Miles, tho' the Truth is, we almolt 

fpoil'd 



[ 317 1 

ipoil'd our Horfes. Here we found a RvjUian Village 
named Kirmazhiskoy^ where we refted, and heard 
nothing of the Calnntck Tartars that Day ^ about 
two Hours before Night we let out again, and tra- 
yeli'd till eight the next Morning, tho' not quite fo 
Haftily as before, and about feven a Clock we paf- 
fed a little River call'd Khtza^ and came to a good 
large Town inhabited by Rufiam^ and very popu- 
lous, call'd Ozomoys^ there we heard that feveral 
Troops or Hoords of Calmiichh^^ been abroad up- 
on the Defart, but that we were now coniplearly out 
of Danger of them, which was to our great Satif- 
faftion you may be liire. Here we were oblig'd to 
gei: ibme frefh Horfes, and having need enough of 
Relt, we ftay'd five Days s and my Partner and I 
agreed to give the honeft Syberian^ who brought us 
thither, the Value of ten Piltoles, for his conduc- 
ing us. 

In five Days more we came to Veitjlima, upon the 
River Witzogda^ which running into the Dwina, we 
were there very happily near the end of our Travels 
by Land, that River being navigable in feven Days 
Paflage to Jrch- Angel: From hencs we came to 
Lawremkoy where the River joins ths id, of Jitly^ 
and provided ourfelves with two Luggage Boats, 
and a Barge for cur own ConveniencCj we tribark'd 
the 7th, and arrived all fate at Arch-Mgd the i8th, 
having been a Year, five Months and three Days 
on the Journey, includirig our Stay of eight Months 
and odd Days at Tobohki. 

We were obliged to ftay at this Place fix Weeks 
for the Arrival of the Ships, and muft have tarry'd 
longer, had not a Hambiirgher come in above a 
Month fooner than any of the Englijl) Ships 5 when 
after feme Conlideration, that the City of Hamburgh 
might happen to be as good a Market for our Goods 
as Lo77don^ we all took Freight with him, and hav- 
ing put my Good on board, it was moft natural for 
me to put my Steward on board to take care of

them, by which means my young Lord had a fufE- 
clent Opportunity to conceal himfelf, never coming 
on Shore again in all the time we ftay'd there •, and 
this he did, that he might not be feen in the Gity, 
where fome of the Miijcom Merchants would cer- 
tainly have leen and difcover'd him. 

We fa i I'd from Arch-Avgel the 2Qth of Aiigvfi the 
fame Year, and after no extraordinary bad Voyage, 
arriv'd in the Elbe the lo^th of September, Here my 
Partner and I found a very good fail for our Goods, 
as well thofe of China as the Sables, ^c, of Syberia ^ 
and dividing the Produce of our EfFefts, my Share 
amounted to 3475— 17 — gJ, notwithflanding fo 
many LofTes we had fuftain'd, and Charges we had 
been at ^ only remembring that I had included in 
this, about fix hundred Pounds worth of Diamonds 
which I had purchased at Bengal, 

Here the young Lord took his leave of us, and 
went up the Elbe in order to go to the Court of 
Vienna^ where he refolv'd to feck Proteftion, and 
where he could correfpond with thofe of his Fa- 
ther's Friends who were left alive: He did not 
part without all the Teftimonies he could give 
me of Gratitude for the Service I had done him, and 
his Sence of my Kindnefs to the Prince his Father. 

To conclude, having ftay'd near four Months 
in Hamburghy I came from thence over Land to the 
Hagiie^ where I embark'd in the Pacquet, and 
arriv'd in Lo7idon the icth oi January^ 1705, having 
been gone from England ten Years and nine Months. 

And here, refolving to harnfs myfelf no more, 
I am preparingfor a longer Journey than all thefe, 
having liv'd 72 Years a Lite of infinite Variety, 
and learn'd fufficiently to know the Value of Retire- 
ment, and the Blefling of ending our Days in Peace.
