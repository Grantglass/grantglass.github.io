f HE STORY OF RdBlffSOif CRPSfli.
THE STORY OF ROBINSON CRUSOE.1
NEARLY three hundred years ago, there lived in
the city of York, England, a lad named Rob-
inson Crusoe. He was of good family and, being
the third son,
was not bred to
any trade. Very
early, however,
his head began
to be filled with
roving thoughts,
and, in spite of
his father's
counsel and his
^X^\^^V^W- mother's en-
CRUSOE WATCHING THE SAVAGES. treaties, he
would be satisfied with nothing but going to sea.
Being, one day, at Hull, he was met by one of his

i Daniel DeFoe, the author of the famous story which I am telling in brief,
was a native of London, and lived from 1661 to 1731. He wrote hundreds
of pamphlets and essays, most of them oh political and religious subjects.
Although none of his works except "Robinson Crusoe" are much read
nowadays, this was by no means his only novel. He was the author of
many interesting tales of adventure, among them being the " Life and Pira-
cies of Captain Singleton," the " Memoirs of a Cavalier," and the "Life of
Colonel Jacques."—M.
comrades, who was about to embark in his father's
ship for London. The latter urged young Crusoe to
go with him, promising him that the voyage should
cost him nothing. Robinson, wishing to play the
young man, readily yielded to his evil counselor, and,
without consulting either father or mother, went on
board the vessel.
Never did any young adventurer's misfortunes, be-
gin sooner or continue longer. The ship was hardly
out of the harbor when the wind began to blow and
the waves to rise in a most alarming manner. Poor
Crusoe, sick and terrified, wished over and over again
that he had heeded his father's tears and his mother's
pleadings. In his agony of mind, he resolved that,
if it should please God to spare his life, he would go
directly home to his father, and would never set foot
on ship again.
The next day, however, the wind was abated and
the sea calmer. By evening, the storm had cleared
up, and the sun sank in the west, perfectly clear, to
rise next morning upon a smooth sea. As young
Crusoe looked with wonder over the broad expanse
of quiet water shining in the sunlight, it seemed to
him the most beautiful sight that he had ever seen.
And now, as Robinson Crusoe afterwards told the
story, his tempter came up to him lest his good
resolutions should continue: "' Well, Bob/ says he,
clapping me on the shoulder, * how do you do after
it? I warrant you were frightened, wa' n't you, last
night, when it blew but a capful of wind?' 'A cap-
ful, d' you call it?' said I, "'twas a terrible storm.'
'A storm, you fool you,' replies he,' do you call that
a storm? Why, it was nothing at all; give us but a
good ship and sea room, and we think nothing of
such a squall of wind as that; but you 're but a
fresh-water sailor, Bob; come, let us make a bowl of
punch and we '11 forget all that; d' ye see what charm-
ing weather 't is now? '"
Thus made sport of, poor Crusoe forgot completely
ail his past fears, and drowned in the punch all his
resolutions for the future. For several days, all went
smoothly. The ship sailed on to Yarmouth Roads
and remained at anchor, though in a high wind.
Meanwhile a hurricane was rising, and Crusoe's
good ship was caught betimes. The sea went moun-
tains high. In vain the sailors cut away the masts,
in vain they worked the pumps. The vessel foun-
dered, and Robinson with the crew were barely saved
in another ship's boat.
With a little money in his pocket, Crusoe walked
from Yarmouth to London. Instead of repenting his
folly and returning home, he soon set out on a sec-
ond voyage, this time to Guinea. The adventure was
his first and only success. The five pounds nine
ounces of gold dust which he brought back to Lon-
don, filled him with aspiring thoughts which after-
wards completed his ruin. For poor Crusoe couldn't
remain long contented. Soon he made a third
voyage, was captured off the African coast by a Turk-
ish rover, and made a slave by the owner of the
pirate vessel.
For two years, Crusoe served his master faithfully
and well, and was often taken on little fishing ex-
cursions with him. Such slavery, however, could
but prove unbearable to so adventurous a spirit as
Crusoe's, and it was not long before he succeeded in
making his escape in his master's boat, taking Xury,
a fellow-slave, with him. They landed on the coast of
Africa, and you may be sure they were not a little
alarmed at the tigers and lions and great spotted leop-
ards there. At night they heard nothing but the
howling and roaring of wild beasts.
Robinson Crusoe and the boy Xury were hardly
contented in such strange company. They probably
wished to get back to their own people. At all
events, they embarked once more in the little sailing
boat, and before long were picked up by a Portuguese
ship bound for Brazil. Xury was kept by the captain
for a slave, but Crusoe was allowed to land at Brazil,
free.
One would have thought that Robinson Crusoe
would have been glad to stay on land for the rest
of his life, after such experiences. Indeed, for four
years he worked steadily at his plantation and might
have become no one knows how rich. But he seemed
born to be his own destroyer. In spite of his ease
and prosperity at home, and the dangers he knew he
must meet on the water, his longing for the sea re-
turned once more.
Meantime he had told his fellow-planters about his
fortunes on the Guinea coast, and they now proposed
that he should go with them to Africa to get slaves.
Robinson Crusoe could no more resist the offer
which they made him than he could restrain the
rambling designs when his father's good counsel was
lost upon him. They set sail at once, and a queer
cargo they carried,—beads, bits of glass, shells and
odd trifles such as little looking-glasses, knives and
scissors. These were for the negroes with whom
they were going to trade.
Cheerfully and boldly they set out on their voyage,
with never a thought of disaster. But it was as
though an efil spirit followed poor Crusoe's ventures.
The ship and her ill-starred crew were borne directly
into the path of a hurricane! This terrible storm
overhauled them, swept their scudding vessel out of
the way of all human commerce, and hurled her upon
a huge sand bar. As the surf crashed over the
foundering ship, no man dared hope for safety.
One boat remained. Committing their souls to God,
they launched her, and straightway pulled foi the
shore. It was in vain. Only a few moments did
their frail craft live in that wild sea. A mountainous
wave bore down upon the boat, overturned her,
and spilt the crew into the deep.
Nothing can describe the confusion of thought
which Robinson Crusoe must have felt when he sank
into the water; for, though he swam well, he could
not free himself from the waves to draw breath till
they had driven him a vast way on towards the shore.
Again and again he was carried off his feet and
dashed upon the strand. At length, nearly sense-
less, he grasped a bit of rock and clung to it till
the waves had gone back. Then he clambered up
the cliffs and threw himself down upon the grass, free
from danger. After thanking God for having saved
his life, Crusoe began to look about for his compan-
ions. But, alas, he never saw them again, nor any
sign of them, except three of their hats, one cap,
and two shoes that were not fellows.
You can easily imagine that Robinson^ Crusoe was
well worn out. His thankfulness, too, at his deliver-
ance, changed to despair when he thought of the
plight he was in. For the island1 seemed desolate
and without inhabitant. Upon what, pray, should he
live? What could save him from the fangs of the
wild beasts? Amid these unhappy reflections, Cru-
ijuan Fernandez island, which lies off the coast of Chili, is famous as the
one-time residence of Alexander Selkirk, a Scotch sailor, whose adventures
were the basis of the story of " Robinson Crusoe."
soe sought out a bush-thorn-tree, and, having armed
himself with a stout truncheon,1 climbed into its
branches and was soon fast asleep.
He awoke in the morning greatly refreshed in spite
of his uncomfortable position. To his delight, he
saw that the ship, which had gone aground several
miles off shore, had been loosed from the bar
during the night and borne in by the sea till it lay
not far from the rock he had climbed the day before.
About noon, as the ocean was quiet and the day
hot, he undressed and swam towards the ship. He
reached it safely; but how in the world should he
get up to her deck? He circled around her twice,
until he at length espied a small piece of rope hang-
ing from her fore-chains. He pulled himself up to
the forecastle and at once began a search to discover
what of her cargo was unharmed. And first he went
to the bread-room, for he was very hungry. Then,
having founfl some biscuits, he began to look about
him, and to long for a boat.
"It was in vain," he afterwards wrote, " to sit still
and wish for what was not to be had; and this ex-
tremity roused my application. We had several
spare yards, and two or three large spars of wood,
and a spare top-mast or two in the ship. I resolved
to fall to work with these, and flung as many of them
overboard as I could manage of their weight, tying
i Cudgel.
every one with a rope, that they might not drive
away. When this was done, I went down the ship's
side and, pulling them to me, I tied four of them
fast together at both ends, as well as I could, in the
form of a raft, and laying two or three short pieces
of plank upon them cross-ways, I found I could
walk upon it very well, but that it was not able to
bear any great weight, the pieces being too light; so
I went to work, and with the carpenter's saw I cut a
spare top-mast into three lengths, and added them to
my raft with a good deal of labor and pains. My
raft was now strong enough to bear any reasonable
weight."
Having loaded the raft with provisions and cloth-
ing, Robinson Crusoe began to look about him for
ammunition and arms. He first secured two very
good fowling-pieces, two pistols, some powder-horns,
a small bag of shot, and two old rusty swords. After
stowing these on board his little craft, he tugged out
two barrels of powder which had remained dry, and,
having made all snug on the raft, pushed off towards
land.1
He found little difficulty in gaining shore; but
upon unloading his supplies, he met a new problem:
Where was he to store his treasures! Where should
1 Crusoe made several trips to the ship, bringing away with him many
small articles which proved of great value to him. I must not forget to
mention that there were on board the vessel two cats and a dog. Both the
cats he carried away with him. As for the dog, he jumped out of the ship
of himself, and swam on shore the day after Crusoe landed his first cargo.
he build his fortress? For several days he contented
himself with protecting under a tent those articles
likely to be injured by sun or rain. Meanwhile he
made many trips to the ship and constantly searched
for a suitable place for his house.
In pitching his tent on this desert island, Crusoe

'POOR ROBIN CRUSOE."—SEE PAGE 18.
had to provide for four necessities: First, he must
find a high, healthful location; secondly, he must be
near fresh water; thirdly, he must be secure from
ravenous beasts; fourthly, he must be in sight of the
sea. In search of such a place, he at length found
a little plain on the side of a rising hill, whose front
towards this little plain was steep as a house-side, so
that nothing could come down upon him from the
top. On the side of this rock there was a hollow
place worn a little way in, like the entrance or door
of a cave; but there was not really any cave or way
in the rock at all.
Before he set up his tent, he drew a half-circle be-
fore the hollow place, which took in about ten yards
in its semi-diameter from the rock, and twenty yards
in its diameter, from its beginning and ending. In
this half-circle he pitched two rows of strong stakes,
driving them into the ground till they stood very
firm, like piles, the biggest end being out of the
ground about five feet and a half, and sharpened on
the top. The two rows did not stand above six inches
from one another.
Then he took the pieces of cable which he had cut
in the ship, and laid them in rows, one upon another,
within the circle, between these two rows of stakes,
up to the top, placing other stakes in the inside, lean-
ing against them, about two feet and a half high, like
a spur to a post; and this fence was so strong, that
neither man nor beast could get into or over it.
The entrance into this place he made to be, not by
a door, but by a short ladder to go over the top.
This ladder, when he was in, he lifted over after him.
And so he was completely fenced in and fortified
from all the world, and could at last sleep secure at
night.
Into this fence or fortress, with infinite labor, he
carried all his riches, all his provisions, ammunition,
and stores. Then, to protect himself from the vio-
lent rains, he made a large double tent and stored in
the inner one, all his provisions and everything that
would spoil by the wet.
When he had done all this, he began to work his
way into the rock, and bringing all the earth and
stones that he dug down, out through his tent, he
laid them up within his fence in the nature of a ter-
race, so that it raised the ground within about a foot
and a half; and thus he made a cave just behind his
tent, which served him like a cellar to his house.
But Crusoe's troubles were not ended, you may
be sure. A great thunder-storm made him fear for
his gun-powder. Poor Crusoe would probably have
gone with the powder, had it exploded; but, strange
to say, he was nowhere near so anxious about his
own danger, for, as he said, if the powder had taken
fire, he would have never known who had hurt him.
After the storm, his first care was to divide the pow-
der into a hundred parcels and to hide it in holes
among the rocks.
After Crusoe had been on the island for ten or
twelve days, he thought to himself: "Here I am,
without books, and with but little ink; how in the
world am I going to remember what day it is? How
am I going to tell Sabbaths from working days?"
Lest he should lose all reckoning of time, he cut in
capital letters upon a large post: "I CAME ON SHORE
HERE ON THE 30 TH OF SEPTEMBER, 1659." This he
made into a great cross and set up on the shore
where he first landed. Upon the sides of this square
post, he cut, every day, a notch with his knife. Ev-
ery seventh notch was as long again as the rest, and
every first day of the month as long again as that
long one. Thus he kept his calendar—his weekly,
monthly, and yearly reckoning of time.
Already fairly settled on his desert island, Robin-
son Crusoe could hardly keep from a feeling of
depression at the solitary life he must lead, he knew
not how long. But as he thought over his condition,
he found that he had many things to be thankful for.
And so, to ease his mind, he set down, like debtor
and creditor, the comforts he enjoyed against the
miseries he suffered, thus:
Evil. Good.

lieve me. in near enough to the shore, that
I have got out so many necessary
things as will either supply my wants
or enable me to supply myself, even
as long as I live.
Have you ever kept a journal—or diary as you
may have called it? Well, Robinson Crusoe kept a
real journal for a long time, and very interesting
reading it is, too. He began it like this:
September 30, 1659. I, poor, miserable Robinson Crusoe, being
shipwrecked during a dreadful storm, came on shore on this dismal
unfortunate island, which I call the Island of Despair, all the
rest of the ship's company being drowned, and myself almost
dead.
All the rest of the day I spent in afflicting myself at the dismal
circumstances I was brought to;—namely, I had neither food,
house, clothes, weapon, nor place to fly to, and, in despair of any
relief, saw nothing but death before me—either that I should
be devoured by wild beasts, murdered by savages or starved to
death for want of food. At the approach of night I slept in
a tree, for fear of wild creatures, but slept soundly* though it
rained all night.
If you have ever been very sick, you must remem-
ber how weak you felt when you were just getting
well. If you do, you can perhaps imagine how
miserable and wretched poor Robinson Crusoe was
when he was taken ill with ague upon an uninhabited
island. There was that unhappy man, shipwrecked,
ruined, and in danger of dying, far away from man.
In his distress he found a Bible and was comforted
by it. For on opening it he came to these words,
"Call upon me in the day of trouble: I will deliver
thee, and thou shalt glorify me."1 Thus cheered,
poor Crusoe, for almost the first time in his life,
knelt down and prayed to God. From that time on,
Robinson Crusoe was resigned to his condition.
Never afterwards did he feel the gloom which he set
down in his journal.
Shortly after he had recovered, Robinson Crusoe
made a trip about his island. One could hardly tell
the many discoveries he must have made. There
were open fields, covered with grass and flowers, and
valleys whose sides were covered with thick trees.
Many beautiful parrots he saw, too, and little hares
and shaggy goats, as well as glistening doves and
waddling turtles.
Now, when Crusoe had been at work on his fort-
ress several months before, he had found a bag of
seeds. As he thought them spoiled and of no value,
he threw them away, just as you or I might toss on
the ground a handful of peas. One day, after the
rains, (for on Crusoe's island, near South America,
there are terrific rainstorms), he was walking about
his little castle, when he saw ten or twelve ears of
* Psalms. I : 15.
perfect barley. It would seem absurd for us to be
happy over finding a few heads of barley or oats in
our front yards, and we should probably pluck the
little stocks up as quickly as we could. To Robin-
son Crusoe, however, every little head was more
precious there than a wealth of money. Not long
afterwards he found some corn and rice which had
sprung up in the same way. We shall see how he
used them.
I wonder if you have ever thought what a strange
multitude of little things are necessary in the provid-
ing, procuring, curing, dressing, and finishing the one
article of bread. How Robinson Crusoe must have
labored! You should remember that he had no
plow, no spade or shovel, no harrow, no mill, no
sieve, no yeast, no salt, nor any oven. It was six
months before he had all the utensils necessary for
making the grain (when he should have it) fit for his
use! At length, with a wooden spade he prepared
his land, and with a hollow wooden mortar, and a
pestle of iron-wood, he ground the grain. Then,
with a sieve of muslin (made from the seamen's
clothes) he sifted out the chaff, and, finally, in
earthen pots of his own making, he baked on very
hot tiles both barley-cakes and rice-cakes, and even
little puddings.
Robinson Crusoe, with his breads and puddings,
had now secured some real island luxuries, but he
was soon facing the clothing question. He had thus
far made out with the seamen's clothes which he had
taken from the ship, but it was now three years since
the wreck, and those garments which he still had
were too hot to wear. Now Crusoe was not very
skilful with the needle, though he had succeeded in
making some rude-looking waistcoats from the
sailors' suits. One other resort lay open to him,
however. He had saved all the skins of the goats he
had killed. These he fashioned into trousers, waist-
coats, hat and umbrella, so that he was once more
really presentable. The umbrella he regarded as his
masterpiece, for the southern sun had often well-nigh
prostrated him.
For five years nothing extraordinary happened to
Robinson Crusoe. He lived on in this same course,
*• in the same posture and place, just as before."
The chief things he was employed in, besides his
yearly labor of planting barley and rice, and curing
raisins, was the building of a canoe. This he finally
succeeded in-launching after digging a canal six feet
wide and four feet deep to the creek about half a
mile distant.
Having fitted the canoe with a sail, having stocked
his craft with a supply of victuals, and having set his
goatskin umbrella in the stern, Crusoe at last started
on a tour of the island. All went well with him till he
ventured to stem a strong eddy near a sharp point of
17
land. No sooner had he approached it than he was
caught up by a current like the sluice of a mill.
This carried the boat along with such violence that

CRUSOE'S FAMILY.— SEE PAGE 19.
he was hurried farther and farther out from the
eddy. There was no wind to help him, and, in spite
of his struggles, he was nearly carried out to sea.
i\fter having been tossed about by various currents,
he at last reached the island in safety, u a warning
piece against all rash and ignorant pilots."
One day, shortly afterwards, when Robinson Cru-
soe was dozing between sleeping and waking, he
thought he dreamed someone spoke to him: "Robin
Crusoe, Robin Crusoe, Robin, Robin, Robin Crusoe,"
said the voice. As he woke, he plainly heard his
name called, and you may be sure he was dreadfully
frightened. But no sooner were his eyes open than
he saw Poll, his tame parrot whom he had captured on
one of his expeditions, sitting on top of the hedge
about the bower. "Poor Robin Crusoe," said the
bird, "where have you been?"
One can hardly wonder that the parrot asked that
question, for Robinson Crusoe had been rambling to
sea most of the time. After his danger, however, he
was quite content to remain at home and finish his
plans for trapping goats. For he had been on the
island nowr for ten years, and he could no longer
afford to use precious ammunition on aught but big
game. His first trial was with snares, but as his
tackle was poor, he always found them broken, and
his bait gone. At last he hit upon the plan of dig-
ging pitfalls, and after some difficulty captured
several goats and kids. These he enclosed by a
hedge, within a piece of meadow land, and at the
end of three years he had a herd of over forty.
They furnished him with an abundance of milk, and
from that time his table was always supplied with
butter and cheese. He dined like a king, too, for
Poll, as Crusoe's favorite, was the only person per-
mitted to talk to him; his dog, very old and crazy,
sat always at his right hand; and his two cats sat
one on one side of the table and one on the other,
expecting now and then a bit from his hand as a
special favor.
Ten years of solitude had changed Crusoe's ap-
pearance wonderfully. He had a short jacket of
goat-skin, and a pair of open-kneed breeches of the
same. Stockings and shoes he had none, but had
made him a pair of buskins to flap over his legs and
lace on either side. He wore a broad belt of goat-
skin, dried, which he drew together with two thongs
of the same, instead of buckles. Instead of a sword
and dagger, hung a little saw and hatchet, one on
each side. He had another belt, not as broad, which
hung over his shoulder, and at the end of it, under
his left arm, hung two pouches, both made of goat-
skin, in one of which was his powder, in the other
his shot. At his back he carried his basket, on his
shoulder his gun, and over his head a great, clumsy,
ugly, goat-skin umbrella.
In the barbarous regalia I have just described,
Robinson Crusoe was one noon walking towards his
boat, when he was thunderstruck to see the print of
a man's foot upon the sand. He listened. He
looked about him. He could hear nothing, nor could
he see anything. Like a man out of his head, poor
Crusoe made his way back to the fortress, looking
behind him at every two or three steps, and mistak-
ing every bush and tree for a man.
In his terror Robinson Crusoe could not sleep that
night. Wild fancies ran through his head. How
could any human beings come to the place? Where
was the vessel that brought them? What marks
were there of any other footsteps? For three days
he hardly dared to stir from his castle, but at length
he began to take courage, and to peep about again.
To quiet his fears he tried to make himself believe
that the footprint was his own, but when he came to
measure the mark with his own foot, he found his
foot not so large by a great deal.
Poor Crusoe returned to his house not much
cheered, as one might suppose, at the thought of
neighbors, for he knew that neighbors in that part of
the island meant savages—possibly cannibals.1 He
at once set to work to fortify and barricade his
dwelling. He also rambled about to find suitable
quarters for his goats.
When he had come down the hill at the end of
the island—where, indeed, he had never been before
—he was perfectly confounded and amazed at see-
ing the shore spread with skulls, hands, feet and

other bones of human bodies, and he observed a
place where there had been a fire, and a circle dug
in the earth. "There," thought Crusoe, " the savage
wretches must have sat down to their inhuman feast."
In haste, Crusoe
fled towards his castle
and, in tears, thanked
God that He had
made him better
than such dreadful
creatures as these.
As he reached home,
his fears were some-

signs of a horrible feast. He had been there
eighteen years in safety, and might probably stay in
safety eighteen more. But he had constantly in mind
the insecurity of his present dwelling, and, night and
day, could think of nothing but how he might de-
stroy some of those monsters in their cruel, bloody
feast, and, if possible, save the victim.
In search of a more protected place for a new re-
treat, he at length found a spot where he could build
a fire without being detected, and a cave where he
might hide himself. Thither he carried nearly all his

powder, and all His spare muskets and fowling-pieces.
For five years, no further visit from the savages dis-
turbed him, but in the twenty-third year of his cap-
tivity, a second trip of the savages put Crusoe upon
his guard.
This time, to his great anxiety, the cannibals had
built their fire on his side of the island. He watched
them from his castle, and meanwhile prepared for
his defence. He loaded his cannon, as he called the
muskets he had mounted on the new fortification,
and all his pistols, and resolved to defend himself to
the last gasp.
After waiting in his castle for about two hours
without knowing what the wretches were about, he
set up his ladder against the hill, and mounting to
the top, peeped at them through his spy-glass. He
saw nine naked savages squatting about a little fire.
They had two canoes with them, but, as he observed,
they could come to this island only with the tide and
must always go with the ebb. Sure enough, as soon
as the tide made to the westward, they all took boat
and paddled away.
For over a year he was not again disturbed by the
horrible visitors, but his mind was ever busy with
schemes for destroying the next that should come
there.
Meantime a great ship was wrecked of! the island.
Robinson Crusoe had heard the shot of distress in the
night, and at break of day discovered the vessel out
at sea. As soon as it was calm, Crusoe resolved to
set out in his canoe, to see if there might still be some
living creature on board whom he might save. So
he hastened back to his castle, and prepared every-
thing for the voyage. He took with him raisins,
barley-cakes, milk, cheese, and other provisions, not
forgetting to set over his head the great goat-skin
umbrella. This time he was careful to study the
currents lest he should be borne out to sea, as he
came near being before. He cautiously steered his
craft into the eastward current, and was carried at a
great rate directly for the wreck, reaching it in less
than two hours.
It was a dismal sight to look at. The ship, which
by her building was Spanish, stuck fast, jammed
between two rocks; all the stern and quarter of her
was beaten to pieces by the sea; her mainmast and
foremast were broken short off, but her head and
bow seemed firm.
As soon as Robinson Crusoe came close to her, a
dog appeared upon her, which, seeing him coming,
yelped and cried. When Crusoe called him, the
dog jumped into the water to come to him. Crusoe
took him into the boat, and found him almost dead
from hunger and thirst. He gave the dog a cake,
which he ate like a ravenous wolf that had been
starving a fortnight in the snow. He then gave the
poor creature some fresh water.
After this, Robinson Crusoe went on board. He
found casks of liquors, and chests of money, besides
muskets and powder-horn. He brought back with
him a fire-shovel and tongs, which he needed much,
as he had been without them for twenty-four years.
He also carried off two little brass kettles, a copper
pot for making chocolate, and a gridiron. With this
cargo he returned to shore. As for treasure, why,
on his second trip he brought back great bags of
pieces of eight,1 Spanish doubloons,2 and many small
bars of solid gold! These he stored in his cave,
hoping some day to use them, should he ever return
to England.
One morning early, Robinson Crusoe was surprised
at seeing no less than five canoes all on shore together
on his side of the island. He at once judged by the
size of the canoes that there must be at least twenty
or thirty savages. For a time Crusoe lay in his castle,
perplexed and discomforted. Finally, hearing noth-
ing, he clambered to the top of the hill and observed
through his spyglass, about thirty naked savages
dancing about a fire on which, no doubt, their cruel
feast was to be cooked. Indeed, scarcely a moment
later, Robinson Crusoe spied two miserable victims
being dragged from the boats.
But, lo, while the cannibals were dispatching one
i Spanish money.

of the unfortunates, the other, being exceeding fleet
of foot, started to escape, making directly toward
the castle! Although Crusoe was dreadfully fright-
ened at perceiving a number of savages in pursuit, he
plucked up courage when he saw that they were quite
outdistanced by the swift runner whom they pursued.
Having swum the creek which lay between them and
the castle, the fellow had almost effected his escape,

CRUSOE RESCUES FRIDAY.
unaided, when he saw Robinson Crusoe, in his queer
goatskin costume, coming toward him at all speed.
Crusoe lost no time in rescuing the poor savage
and in assuring him of security from the cannibals.
The frightened fugitive soon gained courage and drew
near, kneeling to the ground at every ten or twelve
steps. As he came closer, he knelt again, kissed
the ground and laid his head upon the ground.
Then taking Crusoe by the foot, he placed it upon
his own head in token, as it seems, of swearing to be
the slave of his rescuer forever.
Now all this exciting adventure had taken place on
a Friday. So what could be more natural than that
the savage should be named after the day of his es-
cape? From this time on we shall hear of Robin-
son Crusoe and his man Friday as his boon com-
panion. But Crusoe was the " master," and Friday
was soon to become a faithful and excellent servant.
You are probably wondering how Friday looked.
Here is the way Crusoe himself described him:
He was a comely, handsome fellow, perfectly well-made, with
straight, strong limbs, not too large, tall and well-shaped, and
as I reckon about twenty-six years of age. He had a very good
countenance, not a fierce and surly aspect; but seemed to have
something very manly in his face; and yet he had all the sweetness
and softness of a European in his countenance too, especially when
he smiled. His hair was long and black, not curled like wool; his
forehead very high and large, and a great vivacity and sparkling
sharpness in his eyes. The color of his skin was not quite black,
but very tawny; and yet not of an ugly, yellow, nauseous tawny, as
the Brazilians and Virginians, and other natives of America are; but
of a bright dun-olive color, that had in it something very agreeable,
though not very easy to describe. His face was round and plump,
his nose small, not flat like the negroes; a very good mouth, thin
lips, and his fine teeth well set, and white as ivory.
As soon as Crusoe had taught Friday to speak
in broken English, he began to question him
eagerly about the country thereabout. To his sur-
prise he learned of his nearness to the mainland,
27
and straightway determined to visit it. You will
be interested to hear the conversation that took
place between Crusoe and his man Friday. One
day when they were walking up a hill from which,
in clear weather, they could see the continent, Crusoe
called to him and said:
"Friday, do not you
wish yourself in your own
country, your own nation?"
"Yes," he said, "I be
much O glad to be at my
own nation."
"What would you do
there? Would you turn
wild again, eat men's flesh
again, and be a savage as
you were before?"
He looked full of con-
cern, and shaking his head,
said, "No, no, Friday tell
them to live good, tell them
to pray God, tell them to eat corn-bread, cattle-flesh, milk, no eat
man again."
"Why then, they will kill you."
He looked grave at that, and then said, "No, they no kill me,
they willing love learn."
He meant by this, they would be willing to learn. He
added, "they learn much of the bearded mans that come in the
boat."
Then he told Crusoe, as well as he could, how kind
they were to seventeen white men, or bearded men,
as he called them, who came on shore there in dis-
tress.
One morning Robinson Crusoe called to Friday

CRUSOE INSTRUCTING FRIDAY.
and bade him go to the seashore and see if he could
find a turtle or tortoise, which they generally got
once a week for the sake of the eggs as well as the
flesh. Friday had not been gone long, when he
came running back, and flew over the outer wall like
one that felt not the ground or the step he set his
feet on. As soon as he saw Crusoe, he cried out,
"O, master! O, master! O, sorrow! O, bad!"
"What's the matter, Friday?'' asked Crusoe.
"O—yonder, there," said he; "one, two, three
canoe!" The poor fellow was terribly frightened, and
he trembled so, that Robinson Crusoe scarcely knew
what to do with him.
Nor was Friday's alarm to be wondered at. On
peeping through his spy-glass, Crusoe discovered
twenty-one savages at their cruel feast. He could
even see the three victims themselves! But Robin-
son Crusoe was no longer to be daunted by the bar-
barous wretches. Aided by Friday, he succeeded in
getting within firing distance. Then, by means of
powder and swanshot, and his faithful fowling-pieces,
he drove the cannibals to ftheir canoes in mortal
terror
Then came a surprise. What was Friday's de-
light to find that the captive he had helped to rescue
was his own father! At sight of him, Friday daffCml
and sang, kissed him, embraced him, hugged him,
cried, laughed, then cried again. Friday's devotion
to his father deeply moved Crusoe. . Both he and
Friday did all they could to relieve his hunger and
thirst and suffering. Nor did they forget in their
joy to give the same aid to the Spaniard, who had,
indeed, helped to drive off the savages as soon as
Crusoe had set him free. And now, as Robinson
Crusoe tells us, his island was peopled. He was no
longer a king without subjects. Henceforth he was
to have his friends about him. Till his death he was
to enjoy the society of his fellow-men.
Not long after this adventure with the cannibals,
Robinson Crusoe was overjoyed to sight a ship en-
tering his harbor. And best of all, she was an Eng-
lish ship and manned by his own countrymen!
Crusoe saved the ship's captain from the crew who
were plotting to kill him, and after bidding farewell
to his island home, returned to England, taking his
man Friday with him. There, with the money he
had saved from the Spanish ship, he was able to live
in very good circumstances. But his love for adven-
ture would never desert him, and for a number of
years he traveled, visiting China, Siberia and Russia,
and re-visited his " Island of Despair."
One incident of his journeyings can not be omitted.
That is the story of the bear, but I will let Robinson
Crusoe tell it in his own words:
My man Friday had delivered our guide, and when we came
up to him he was helping him off from his horse, when, on the
sudden, we spied the bear come out of the wood. And a vast
monstrous one it was, the biggest by far that ever I saw. We
were all a little surprised when we saw him; but when Friday saw
him, it was easy to see joy and courage in the fellow's counte-
nance. "Oh! oh! oh! " says Friday, three times, pointing to him;
"oh, master! you give me te leave; me shakee te hand with him;
me make you good laugh."
I was surprised to see the fellow so pleased. "You fool you,"
says I, "he will eat you up!" "Eatee me up! eatee me up!"
said Friday, twice over again; "me eatee him; me make you good
laugh. You all stay here; me show you good laugh." So down
he sits, and gets his boots off in a moment, and puts on a pair of
pumps (as we call the flat shoes they wear, and which he had in his
pocket, gives my other servant his horse, and with his gun away he
flew swift like the wind.
The bear was walking softly on, and offered to meddle with
nobody, till Friday, coming pretty near, calls to him, as if the bear
could understand him: "Hark ye! hark ye! says Friday; "me
speakee wit you."
Friday, who had, as we say, the heels of the bear, came up
with him quickly, and takes up a great stone and throws it at him,
and hits him just on the head, but did no more harm than if he
had thrown it against a wall. But it answered Friday's end; for
the rogue was so void of fear that he did it purely to make the
bear follow him, and show us some laugh, as he called it. As
soon as the bear felt the stone and saw him, he turns about and
comes after him, taking exceedingly long strides, and shuffling
along at a strange rate, so as would have put a horse to a middling
gallop. Away runs Friday, and takes his course as if he ran
toward us for help. So we all resolved to fire at once upon the
bear, and deliver my man; though I was angry at him heartily
for bringing the bear back upon us when he was going about
his own business another way. And especially I was angry that
he had turned the bear upon us and then run away, and I called
out, "You dog," said I, "is this your making us laugh? Come
away, and take your horse, that we may shoot the creature."
He hears me, and cries out, "No shoot! no shoot! Stand still;
you get much laugh.** And as the nimble creature ran two feet
for the beast's one, he turned on a sudden on one side of us,
and seeing a great oak-tree fit for his purpose, he beckoned to us
to follow; and doubling his pace, he gets nimbly up the tree, laying
his gun down upon the ground at about five or six yards from the
bottom of the tree.
The bear soon came to the tree, and we followed at a distance.
The first thing he did he stopped at the gun, smelt to it, but let
it lie; and up he scrambles into the tree, climbing like a cat,
though so monstrously heavy. I was amazed at the folly, as I
thought it, of my man, and could not for my life see anything to
laugh at yet, till seeing the bear get up the tree, we all rode nearer
to him.
When we came to the tree, there was Friday got out to the
small end of a large limb of the tree, and the bear got about half-
way to him. As soon as the bear got out to that part where the
limb of the tree was weaker, "Ha,*' says he to us, "now you see
me teachee the bear dance." So he falls a jumping, and shaking
the bough, at which the bear began to totter, but stood still, and
began to look behind him to see how he should get back; then,
indeed, we did laugh heartily. But Friday had not done with him
by a great deal. When he sees him stand still, he calls out to him
again, as if he had supposed the bear could speak English, "What!
you no come farther? Pray you come farther." So he left jump-
ing and shaking the tree; and the bear, just as if he had understood
what he said, did come a little farther; then he fell a jumping again,
and the bear stopped again.
We thought now was a good time to knock him on the head,
and I called to Friday to stand still and we would shoot the bear.
But he cried out earnestly, "O pray! O pray! no shoot; me shoot
by and then." He would have said by-and-by. However, to
shorten the story, Friday danced so much, and the bear stood so
ticklish, that we had laughing enough indeed, but still could not
imagine what the fellow would do; for first we thought he depended
upon shaking the bear off; and we found the bear was too cunning
for that too, for he would not go out far enough to be thrown down,
but clings fast with his great broad claws and feet, so that we could
not imagine what would be the end of it, and where the jest would
be at last.
But Friday put us out of doubt quickly; for seeing the bear cling
fast to the bough, and that he would not be persuaded to come any
farther, "Well, well," says Friday, "you no come farther, me go,
me go; you no come to me, me go come to you." And upon this
he goes out to the smallest end of the bough, where it will bend
with his weight, and gently lets himself down it, sliding down the
bough, till he came near enough to jump down on his feet, and away
he ran to his gun, takes it up, and stands still.
Then Friday shot the bear as he leisurely climbed
down the trunk of the oak.
* * *
In such divers adventures Robinson Crusoe filled
out his declining years, till the love for fireside that
comes with old age got the better of his venturesome
spirit. Then, resolved to harass himself no more, he
prepared for a longer journey than all these. Having
lived for seventy-two years a life of infinite variety,
he had learned the "value of retirement and the
blessing of ending our days in peace."
