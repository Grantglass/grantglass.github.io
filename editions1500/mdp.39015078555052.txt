Mv DEAR BLAKCnAItD,
It seems but a poor compliment to dedicate such an
unconnected string of doggrel as this to anybody; but, nevertheless,
I do dedicate it to you, in memory of the first Pantomime I ever
saw (two and twenty years ago, and, need I add, one of yours);
and in token of my sincere admiration for your unapproachable
talent as a concocter of wholesome Christmas fun.
Ever yours most sincerely
HENRY J. BYEON.
E. L. Blanchard, Esq..
ROBINSON CRUSOE.
Scene First.—The Common Hard at Hull, during the
war time. A public house and a tobacconist's shop, with
" Pigtail, Tobacconist" over the door. Serjeant Splen-
didshilling is reading the news from the seat of war
to the gaping Sailors and Seaport Loungers ; a Crier
ringing a bell, and distributing papers to the Sailors
and tlieir Sweethearts. All are laughing and chat'
ting as the scene opens to lively music, and the scene is
one of great bustle and stirring excitement.
Serj. (rising) Ladles and gen'lmen, I'm proud to say,
I read here in the paper of to-day,
We've beat them foreignors again.
All. (on the stage) Hooray!
Serj. But here comes Daddy Pigtail's pretty daughter,
I looks to-wards her; here ! more gin and water!
Music.—Enter Jenny Pigtail, r., followed by Billy
Bowline, Barney Bunting, and others.
Jenny. Now go along, you good-for-nothing crew,
I like your impudence, indeed I do.
Bow. (chucking her under the chin, r.) I know you like it.
Bunt, [ditto, l.) Course she likes it.
Jenny. Pah I
You sailors smell so horribly of tar,
It's really most unpleasant; then your words
Are terrible to hear, at least two thirds.
Breaking young women's hearts you fancy sport;
You have a wife you know in every port;
Which is by no means right, as you'll allow, sirs ;
Your manners are as loose as are your trousers.
Bunt. No matter; I for one will have a kiss.
(he attempts to kiss her, but fails)
Enter Daddy Pigtail, k.
Pig. Upon my word, extremely pretty, miss,
Such conduct I consider, Bunting
Bunt.- Pooh!
Pig. Sheer insolence! sheer off! she are not for you !
(Sailors grumble omd retire)
(bringing Jenny down) My child, I have a something
to impart;
You know young Craaoe ?
Jenny, (aside) Know him ? yes, by heart
Pig. He is a 'prentice, as you're well aware.
Jenny. Yes, at the Golden Teapot in the Square.
Pig. Ah, would that he were on the square as well.
Jenny. Oh, madness! misery! What mean you? Tell!
Pig. It wrings my heart. Oh, how—how shall I break it?
Jenny. Your heart?
Pig. No! no! (aside) I wonder how she'll take it.
(aloud) The fact is, Kobinson is poor.
Jenny. But proud.
Pig. Uncommonly! And I have had a crowd
Of applications—some of them are grand.
Behold! all these are offers for your hand.
(shews a huge bundle of letters)
Will Atkins, who's enriched by smuggler booty,
Is very anxious, dear, to pay his duty.
For with affection in his bosom rent
Jenny. Then let him pay it to the Government.
Pig. Why, here he is!
Enter Will Atkins, a buccaneer of the true Cobourg
stamp, enveloped in a rvugh pea jacket, and covered with
every variety of offensive weapon.
SC. I.] BOBIXSON CRUSOE. 9
As p'raps I'm in the way,
I'll say ta ta! Exit, r.
Atkins, (kneeling to Jenny) The Government, you say?
You are my government, by persecution
You have induced in m« a levolution :
I used to smoke and drink and use bad language;
But now my bosom is a prey to anguiage.
Jenny. Oh, why do you torment me thus, you fright?
Atkins. Torment! Why, this tar meant to be polite.
Jenny. You're too polite, much too polite, I'm loth
With such a person to p-light my troth.
I have no fortin'.
Atkins. I for tin don't care.
I, who have fought in battles everywhere ;
In one I lost my eye, missing my fut
I go-t backer, also this short cut
(points to a piece of black plaister which extends
the entire length of his countenance)
I have a skiff—a skimmer of the sea,
And I ask if you will its missus be ?
'Tis in the offing ready quite for sailing.
Jenny. I've told you offing that it's unavailing.
Atkins. Hah! some land-lubber's cut my hopes in two,
No one can lub her as I used to do.
The Golden Teapot I (Jenny starts violently)
Hah! that tell-tale start!
(aside) That smug young grocer's arts engross her 'art.
(aloud) Each week he serves you with his mild Bohea.
Jenny. Yes, I confess he suits me to a tea.
Atkins. But in your cup of happiness I Boon
Will make a precious stir I
Jenny. You precious spoon!
Atkins. Durance mostvile I'll quickly have you clapped in:
(shouts) Cutpurse and Gouge-eye! Hoh! assist your
Captain!
Atkins seizes Jenny—Cutpurse and Gouge-eye, villain-
ous buccaneering ruffians, enter, L.
Jenny. What would you do?
Atkins. In vain, proud ge-url, you wrestle:
Seize her and carry her aboard my vessel!
(the Ruffians run after the Girl, and, missing her,
come whack against each other, this is repeated,
and they come with a thump against Atkins, who
strikes them, and seines Jenny)
Jenny, (struggling violently as she is being carried away)
Ruffians! this insolence shall cost you dear.
Help I help! Oh, Robinson, where are you!
Crusoe, (without, l.) Here!
Enter Robinson Crusoe, l.—he knocks down the two
Ruffians with back-handed blows, and floors Atkins
with a driver, then stands c. with Jenny insensible in
his arms.—Picture.
Look up, my lovely Jane : she faints, she dies!
Oblige your Robinson and ope your eyes.
Jenny, (reviving) Where am I ?
Crusoe. Don't you know your Crusoe's voice ?
Your Robinson, the husband of your choice ?
Atkin3. (on the ground) Oh, horror and despair! dis
pair get married!
With fiendish thoughts my bosom is old harried.
(to Crusoe) Young Crusoe, you'll repent that bitter
blow. (Crusoe about to strike him)
What! raise your fist against a fallen foe ?
Crusoe, (kicking him) Certainly not.
Atkins, (howls and rises) A kick my frame upon !
I'll be revenged—a kick—kick—ki—kome on!
Rushes off with his Men, r.
Enter Daddy Pigtail and Others, b.
Pig. My child! (embrace)
Jenny. He from the ruffian did me snatch ;
You must consent, papa dear( to the match.
Pig. You've saved my child, and as I'm glad to heaf
10" ROBINSON CEUSOE. [SC.I.
Crusoe. You give your kind consent ?
Pig. I do my boy j
As you are wealthy, why I wish you joy.
I always had a great regard for you,
So take my blessing and my daughter too.
Jenny. Oh, rapture! We'll have such a grocer's shop!
Rob. Isn't the prospect plummy ? Come, dear!
(going with Jenny, l., is stopped by the entrance of
Atkins, Cutpukse, Gouge-eye, $' Marines, l.)
Atkins. Stop!
(hurried music piano)
Crusoe. What means this interruption ? Stand aside !
Atkins. My brave associate!. s?ize the lovely bride.
(Cutpukse and Gouge-eye seize Jenny)
And as for Crusoe, if it s all the same,
The press-gang grabs him in King George's name !
(Crusoe is seized by the Marines)
Jenny. The press-gang! oh! (faints)
Atkins. You'll make a noble tar.
Rob. (struggling) Let me get at the villain!
Atkins, (folding his arms with the scornful aetion of
transpontine melodrame) Ha, ha, ha !
Behold, triumphant William Atkins grins !
(to Jenny) You spurned my offers, (to Crusoe)
And you kicked my shins!
It's my turn now. Aboard my vessel take her,
And if she won't wake up from fainting, shake her !
As for that whipper-snapper grocer's 'prentice,
Drag him away!
Crusoe, (in an agony of rage and despair) Oh! am I
compos mentis?
Music.—Crusoe h'eaks away, and Jenny revives,
they rush into ecten other's arms, but are dragged
away by Atkins and his Myrmidons. This is
repeated, and some of the Populace knock down
Press-gang, the Women fly at the Smugglers,
and there appears some chance for Crusoe and
Jenny, when Atkins seizes her in his arms and
carries her off, r. The Press-gang take off
Crusoe, l. The bustle, confusion, and noise
kept up till close of Scene,
Scene Second.—The Abode of Tyranny.
The Scene is heavy, dismal, and dark. Tyranny, who
enters, l., is dressed completely in black, and no colour of
any kind is visible in the Scene or its adjuncts. Oppres-
sion enters after Tyranny, holding a newspaper.
Tyban. (pacing the stage enraged) Bring me no more
reports, I'm savage,—sad.
The way I'm losing ground is much too bad.
King Tyranny, a monarch, once despotic,
Become the sport of any wild Quixotic
Adventurer, who, anxious for a row,
Forces my purblind followers to bow
Beneath his notions of Utopian rule !
Oppres. Cheer up, great king.
Tyran. (striking him) Oppression, you're a fooL
But if I can't o'er nations hold my sway,
O'er individuals perhaps I may.
And that reminds me of my protege !
Oppres. That pirate smuggler, Captain Atkins, hight.
Tyran. Ah, he's a pirate of the main and might—
A youth who'll do me, his protector, credit.
His deck, while strangers unsuspicious tread it,
Covers five hundred niggers !
Oppres. (rubbing his hands in glee) He, he, he !
Tyban. Ha, ha! the notion tickles you, I see.
(they both laugh heartily—Liberty rises in an
illuminated bower—her dress is of shining silver,
and stands out in marked contrast to the extreme
darkness of the Scene)
Tou here ! How could you an admittance gain ?
Oppression, didn't you put up the chain?
Libeb. I'm Liberty—the chain's not forged that binds me.
Tyran. (cowering) Oh, how she shines—her dazzling
brightness blinds me!
Liber. Yes; Liberty shines e'en your dungeons through:
But stay,—I've come to have a shine with you.
Duet.—Buckley's "Sleighing Song."
Libeb. Oh, in a pretty way, sir,
You've acting been of late;
And I have come tc-day, sir,
King Tyranny to rate,
Tyran. Miss Liberty,
You'd better be
Polite, I beg to state;
Or in a cell,
You'll find, " ma belle,"
Full time to ruminate.
Liber. I tingle, tingle, tingle, ting,
Your ugly neck to wring.
Tyran. Come recollect,
With some respect
You ought to treat a king.
You tingle, tingle, tingle, ting,
My luckless neck to wring.
Come recollect, &c.
Libeb, I tingle, tingle, tingle, ting,
Your ugly neck to wring.
But recollect,
With some respect,
I ought to treat a king.
Tyran. How didst thou enter ? That fact thou concealest
Liber. Why surely Liberty is on the free list.
Tyran. I know no free list but the public press,
The press-gang I allude to, madam.
Liber. Yes.
I am aware you hold that system dear,
Liberty's soldier is a volunteer,
Who caring little for the pay or pain,
With glory in his mind, not greed of gain,
With honour in his heart, not hopes of wealth,
Devotes his stock of manly British health
To help Oppression's victims o'er the sea,
To fling aside their fetters and be free!
But as to the occasion of my visit,
It is concerning poor young Crusoe.
Tyran. (doggedly) Ts it?
Liber. You have oppressed him sadly, sent him o'er
The sea a thousand weary miles or more.
A thousand weary miles.
Tyran. Ha! hal
Liber. _ You smiled,
As if yon thought euch treatment weary mild.
B
I say it's shameful! Be more generous, come.
Tykan. He's in my power and I will use it, mum,
For he's my William Atkins's sworn foe,
And enemy to Tyranny al-so.
(Liberty icavea her wand, the Scene opens, and the
vessel of war in which Crusoe is seen, appears
Calmly sailing before the breeze)
LibeK. Behold! his vessel rides before the gale,
With union flying and distended sail,
In safety through the briny foam she glides.
Tykan. In safety, eh? No longer thus she rides.
(the view dissolves and discloses a wreck)
Behold! the ocean's shattered masts and decks.
Hurray for old King Neptune ! Vivat wrecks !
Liber. But though a victim to your envious shafts,
Behold, poor king, there are such things as rafts,
On one he rides, defiant of the storm.
(Crusoe is seen riding on a raft)
Tyran. Confusion ! I'm uncomfortably warm.
Liber. He's saved, and having passed through numerous
dangers,
Amidst extremely cannibalish strangers,
Shall come back to his home, Lis snug fireside,
His old acquaintances and blooming bride,
Having achieved a name revered by all,
Loved by great people, idolized by small—
Not merely in his native land alone,
A " household word " wherever speech is known.
Come, as you've treated me to such a show,
I will return the compliment—let's go
And see my home. (Tyranny hangs back, alarmed)
Why, what have you to fear?
Tyr. Not if I know it!
Lib. Then I'll bring it here.
Tyr. Surely 'gainst common sense that is a crime.
Lib. Please to remember this is Christmas time;
Whoever looked for anything like reason
In pieces written for this madcap season ?
Good geniuses have always had the skill
To move thetr magic whereabouts at will,
The power to make her palace go and come,
Always had Liberty ad libitum.
(the Scene changes to the " Lucid Labyrinths of
Liberty Hall"—a shining silvery scene in which
everything is dazzlingly brilliant, except the black
form of Tyranny) ^
Lib. This specimen of fairy locomotion,
I think, you will admit was a bright notion.
Come, ladies, while my home my guest I show,
Please trip it on the " light fantastic toe."
GRAND BALLET.
(tableau—closed in by dark scene, which opens and
discovers)
Scene Third.—The Island. The air of " Oh, poor
Robinson Crusoe " played as it opens.
Enter, first the Dog, then the Parrot, the Goat, and
Jinally, Crusoe ; he is dressed in the regular semi-
savage dress, his beard is long, his hair matted.
Medley song—Air, " Robinson Crusoe."
Crusoe. Please suppose since the last
Scene, just two years have passed;
I beg you politely to do so.
Beneath this disguise
You perhaps recognize
Unfortunate Robinson Crusoe.
I had bought my intended her trousseau;
It was premature rather to do so;
For I pressed was by force,
Which proceeding, of course,
Spoilt the plans of poor Robinson Crusoe.
Air, " Wobbledewoe."
(looking round miserably) " I'm monarch of all I surrey,
My right there is none to dispute,"
As some future poet will say
Of this poor unfortunate brute.
Oh! wretched Crusoe, oh I
Oh! most unlucky Crusoe, oh!
(the Animals, standing in a line, join in the chorus)
16 ROfeiiisoN crusoe. fscut
Through existence so lonely I jog,
For company only have that
Of my cat and my parrot and dog—
(very miserably) And my dog and my parrot and cat?
Oh ! wretched Crusoe, oh !
Oh! most unlucky Crusoe, oh!
Although this solitude begins to pall,
It has some trifling comforts, after all.
No Christmas bills for bread, for meat, for tea,
No rent and taxes ever worry me.
This rich ground raises me all sorts of fruits,
And in the rainy season my corn shoots.
(dog barks) For lack of loaves I'm never in the hole,
My faithful dog can always bark-a-roll.
No fear of petty robberies have I,
As no one's near I dread no fellow nigh.
I dread no burglars, for I haven't got tin,
No close garotting, for my clothes go rotting.
A rich warm sun we luckily have got, (reflectively
observing the Parrot)
A rich warm sun—yes, and a poor parr-ot.
I feel no winter's wind, however cutting, (the Goat
butts him)
Mapped by my great goat, with his large horn butting.
But sorrow's fruitless, so I bury mine,
And I sow meZon-choly, don't reap pine.
(Music ; he discovers a footprint on the sand, and
starts)
Ha! ha! what do I see ? a footprint, surely!
(kneels down, and places his eye close to it)
It is a footprint—oh, I'm very poorly!
The prints from some great black—oh dear, I wince,
As did the foreigners at our Black Prince.
If he's a cannibal—with fears I pant—
He'll come and nab this poor in'abitant.
(an Indian howl heard, r.)
Oh! I foresee that we shall come to grief,
' That howl proceeds from some hould Indian chief.
My courage rapidly is oozing from me,
His tommy-hawk will slice my ana-tommy.
Another howl—Robinson skips back with the
animals, r., Friday rushes on, r., and hides, l.—
Hokee-Pokee and Wanky-Fum, two fierce
Indiansjump on to the stage, from R., brandishing
their tomahawks fiercely.
Hokee, De pris'ner am escaped! Oh, Wanky-Fum !
(the Indian drum heard, r.)
De Indian drum!—turn, turn! Come, Fum.
Wanky. Some mm!
(pulls out a bottle, flourishes it—Friday comes
close behind him and takes the bottle out of his
hand, hides—Wanky-Fum turns upon Hokee-
Pokee, and they fight— they rush at each other,
miss, and as they get to r. and l., Robinson
strikes one and Friday the other—they jump
round at each other—an Indian whoop heard, r.)
Hokee. De signal of great Hoop-de-dooden-doo!
Wanky, me lub you.
Wanky. Hokee, me lub you.
(they embrace and go off, r.)
(Music.—Robinson and Friday advance—Friday
exhibits great awe and alarm—Crusoe offers
his hand in a friendly way, and Friday becomes
more easy, advancing, grinning, and nodding)
Crusoe. All apprehension, sombre party, smother;
Although you're black, you are a man and brother.
So tell me who you are, by action, nicely.
(Music.—Friday goes through pantomimic action,
expressive of having been taken captive, <$'<:.)
You have been taken prisoner!—precisely,
(Music.—Friday expresses his horror at the idea
of being eaten)
And not desiring to be eaten, you
Gave them the slip.
(Music.—Friday expresses his grief at his forlorn
condition)
You don't know what to do ?
Come now, what can you do ? Canst fish ?
(Music.—Friday expresses his piscatorial powers)
You can ?
(ande) He'd really make a first-rate servant-roan,
And would particularly useful be;
He wouldn't cost me much for livery ;
That is indeed a thing he ne'er can lack,
Nature provides him with a suit of black.
(to Friday) Wilt be my servant?
Friday. Oh iss, massa; me
You did deliber from de massa-cree.
I'll be your slave.
(kneels and places Crusoe's foot upon his head)
Crusoe. My slave, soft-hearted flat!
No, no, I place my wee toe upon that.
(gives Friday a playful kick, Friday falls flat
and appears attracted by a sound—he listens
eagerly—Indian music heard pianissimo, Friday
becomes violently agitated)
The Indians! Ha! they're coming you to nail;
With strong Attacks to levy their black male.
(Friday weeps)
He weeps ! forth from his eyes his dreadful doom
After the levee is a drawing rheum.
Friday, (in a state of feverish excitement) One, two, tree men!
Crusoe, (alarmed) I'd bolt at once outright,
But I am in one too tre-men-dous fright
Let's see, this day's a Friday—horrid thought!
'Twill truly be a, fry day if we're caught.
(a war whoop heard, r., Friday and Crusoe fall
back to back)
We shall be boiled, w go to make a stew;
They'll make black puddings, my young friend, of you:
Or cook you like a rabbit, and of course
Of poor young Crusoe they will make white sauce.
(the Indian drum heard—Crusoe clutches Friday
and they vialk tremulously across the stage to the
following song)
Air, " The Indian Drum."
Crusoe. Hark! 'tis the Indian drum I
(Friday supplies a refrain with a musical shudder)
(faintly) Hark I 'tis the Indian drum!
(Friday shudders)
{on tip-toe) Softly, softly, follow me,
Or discovered shall we be.
Hark, hark, hark! 'tis the Indian drum!
Abrupt note— Crusoe and Friday make a sudden
comic exit, l.
Scene Fourth.—The Interior of Crusoe's Dwelling, as
described in the work, with additional modern articles
of consumption, #c. A large barrel labelled " Flour,"
r.; a table, c, with two rough chairs; large pepper
box and salt box ; looking glass, clothes horse, fyc.
Music.—Crusoe and Friday appear scrambling over the
palisade at the back—Friday exhibits great comic terror,
and they continually get in each other's way; just as
Crusoe is getting over, Friday pulls him back, the same
when Friday is nearly over; at length Crusoe gets over
and slips on to the stage, Friday follows and falls on
him, Crusoe shouts and Friday jumps up and pulls
Crusoe on to his legs, apologising in extravagant action:
he seizes a gigantic clothes brush.
Crusoe. Thank'ee, be quiet, if it's all the same.
Oh ! by the way, you haven't got a name;
Stay—as to-day is Friday, that'll do
As well as any other one for you;
So recollect, you're Friday from to-day:
You are my man of all work, and shall stay-
So long as you behave yourself—with me ;
You'll have no wages, and you'll find your tea,
Your beer, your sugar, and your livery.
For dinner you will have to hunt about;
You'll have no followers, no Sundays out
Should Indians come, or any such disaster,
You'll have to fight in service of your master.
Of course you'll cook my dinner, clean the plate,
Sit up to let me in when I'm out late ;
If you're knocked up you're never to declare it,
And when I spank your nob, you'll grin and bear it
Now, as I'm going out, some game to track,
Have a meat pie made by the time I'm back.
(Music.—Crusob goes up and off" by the ladder,
over the palisade ; Friday goes to the flour barrel
and fetches out some dough, which he places on
the table; then he brings on a large pie-disk,
which he places, c, seizes a jar labelled " Butter,"
and, taking some out, butters the inside of the
pie-dish, sucking his fingers after so doing, and
greasing his woolly head ; he takes then a large
knife, and, after feeling the edge, cuts slices of
ham. from one hanging, v.; these he places in the
pie-dish, then peppers violently, sneezing occasion-
ally into tha pig; when his back is turned, the
Parrot enters and snatches a slice of ham, and
runs, r. ; the Goat enters and attempts to take it
from the Parrot ; Friday, discovering the theft,
strikes the Goat, who butts at him and sends him
backwards, in a sitting posture, into the pie- dish ;
the Dog enters, seizes the meat from the Parrot,
and runs to a corner with it; Friday gets out of
the dish, a piece of ham adhering to his back—
this he picks off and returns, carefully scraping
the grease off his clothes and putting it back into
the dish ; he tlien runs and lifts up the lid of the
flour barrel, putting his head and shoulders into
it; the Parrot gives him a peck at the calf, and
the Goat tilts down the lid on his head; he
wriggles about in extreme discomfort, until he
succeeds in getting himself out together with some
dough for paste, which he places on the table ; he
then seizes the rolling pin, flours it, beats out and
rolls'the paste, then places the pin on the table; the
Doa seizes it and runs away—Friday after him ;
he' succeeds in regaining it, and strikes the Dog,
who yelps ; Friday returns to the work of the pie,
.' and drops some of the dough on the floor; he
picks it up and picks out carefully several foreign
substances, amongst them an enormous hair, which
takes him some time to extract; he then covers the
dish with the paste, and gazes fondly on the pie
with conscious pride of an artist; the Parrot
- digs his long beak into the middle of the pie and
rushes away with a large piece of the paste;
Friday tears his wool in agony of rage; he
catches the Parrot and seizes the paste, pulling
violently ; the Parrot open his beak, and Friday
tumbles back ; he then rushes to the pie, claps the
piece of paste over the hole, and beats it down
with the rolling pin; just at this moment an
Indian howl is heard, just outside the palisade ;
Friday's knees drop together, he drops the rolling
pin into the pie, and shivers violently; the Parrot,
Dog, and Goat tremble terribly and exhibit
awful alarm, they sneak of, trembling ; Friday
turns and observes three long feathers swaying
backwards and forwards at the top of the palisade;
Friday, in a state of abject terror, hides himself
under the table ; the three Indians climb over the
palisade — Hokee-Pokee, "Wanky-Fum, and
their King, Hoopdeedoodendoo, a very fat
monarch, completely covered with ornaments;
Hokee-Pokeb and Wanky-Fum drop down on
to stage, but the King sticks on the palisade,
unable to move)
Hoop. Come, treat your monarch dread with more respect,
Him not de King of Naples recollect.
(the Indians help him down—he is very fat, un-
wieldy, and bald-headed)
I more resemble t'other one;—What's called he ?
I'm a bald Carib—oh, ah ! Carib-baldi!
(feeling his head)
Me got no heir, so when I die, my friends,
The Hoopdedoodendoo dy-nasty ends.
(starts) What do I see ? A human pie, by gum !
I stick to that! (reads from bottle) What's this?
"Jamaica Rum!"
. I thought nobody libbed upon this island,
It's plain that some one's been here alongwhile,and—
(seizes the pepper-box and smells it, sneezes horribly,
shakes the box, and Hokee-Pskee and Wanky-
Fum sneeze; they sneeze about the stage, and
bump against each other ; the Indians taste every-
thing, and squabble over the pie, slapping each
other with the slices of ham; they fill a cup with
rum, and sit round the table, drinking; they all
have their hands on the table ; suddenly, Friday
raps the table violently; the three Indians be-
come alarmed)
Hoop. The sperrets are a rapping, Wanky-fum,
P'raps you don't know that I'm a medi-um.
Hokee. (sceptically) Rubbish! their presence I •hould
like to feel
(Friday catchet hold of Hokee-Pokee's leg—he
is in horrible alarm, and tries to get away—the
others laugh immensely at him)
Oh ! oh ! the sperret's got me by the heel!
(Friday raises the table, and it begins to turn; the
Indians go round with it after the fashion of
table turners; it becomes more rapid, and they
tumble; Friday throws the table flat on to them,
and escapes into the flour barrel; comic business
en the part of the King, who looks up and
gradually rises, kicking his brother Indians;
they become jovial, when they see the lid of the
four barrel moving, and they all tremble and
sneak towards the palisade; suddenly Friday
pops his head (covered with the table cloth which
he has taken with him into the barrel) out of
the barrel; the Indians give a simultaneous
howl, and jump at the top of the palisade, they
hang on; the Goat rushes on, and butts at the
hanging form of the King; the Dog seizes Hokee-
Pokee, and the Parrot digs his beak into
Wanky-Fum's back, and hangs suspended from
him; Friday howls, andrattles the flour barrel lid
'with violent yatieulations; the Indians swing,
roaring as the scene closes)
Scene Fifth.—Creek in the Island, with the Wreck of
Atkins's Vessel in the distance.
Music—Enter Will Atkins, followed by Jenny Pigtail
who has her hair down, and has the wild determined
manner of melodramatic heroines in the Third Act.
Atkins. This in the elements is nice behaviour,
To go and wreck my copper-bottomed slavier.
We're on a desert island, lovely Jane,
You'll never see your native land again:
Therefore make up your mind to marry me—-
Don't silly be, but shun celibacy.
Your Crusoe's drowned, so, Jenny, what's the use in
Your ardent William Atkins still refusing ?
Why will you thus upon your lover frown ?
Jenny, [proudly) My Robinson was never born to drown.
Oh, Crusoe! Crusoe! oh, where art thou, Crusoe ?
Though Atkins doth your memory abuse, oh !
For you, since Fate says we can't be a pair,
I'll wear the willow, as your well-o-ware.
In single blessedness my days I'll drag out
(in great despair, and very loudly) Oh, Crusoe !
Atkins, (savagely) Silence! or I'll bring the gag out^
And clap it on your mouth—I seldom brags!
Jenny. An honourable actor never gags.
Atkins. I'm not an actor—I'm an amateur.
(aside) That is to say, that I'm in love with her.
(fiercely) You shall be mine, whether willin' or not.
(Music—as he advances she seizes from his belt a
large horse pistol, and stands at bay)
Jenny. Willin! you will in coming on be shot,
Therefore, come on at once ! (wildly) Ha, ha, ha, ha!
Atkins, (mildly) Miss P., you're not at the Victori-a.
Though the lorn damsels there you thus burlesque, you
Will find no gallant tar come to the rescue.
I've been too long on the high seas to fear you,
And thus I seize you, pretty little dear, you.
Music.—They rush across and miss— Jenny fires the pistol,
which takes effect on Hokee-Pokee, who is entering, e.
—and Atkins's cutlass sticks into Wanky-Fum, who is
entering, l.—they fall as if done for.
Jenny. Oh dear, oh dear, I've killed a man I fear.
Atkins. It's nothing when you're used to it, my dear.
Hokee. (sitting up) But I ain't dead.
Jenny, (running to him, and placing a flask to his lips)
Poor black, since you alive are,
And do not die, just try this black reviver.
(Hokee takes to it very kindly—Wanky watches him)
Hokee. Gollopshus! Oh, I'm all alive with this.
Wanky. (sittingup) I beg to state/ain't dead neither, miss.
(Jenny drops Hokee's head, which has been sup-
ported by her knee—it falls with a hard thump on
the stage—she runs to Wanky and gives him drink)
Jenny. Oh, say that you're alive again, pray do, man.
Atkins, (a, watching Jenny) Bewi^hing sight to see a
tender wooman
Tender assistance to the other gender.
Wanky. (pinching Jenny's arm) 'Iss wassa—she look
berry nice and tender.
Hokee. If she's discubbered by that chief of ours,
He berry soon will pay her his devours.
(an Indian whoop heard—Jenny and Atkins are
terribly alarmed—and the Indians jump on to
their feet)
Jenny. An Indian whoop !
Wanky. 'Iss missy, berry true!
Dat ar's the whoop of Hoop-de-dooden-doo I
Jenny. Where can we fly ?
Hokee. We're berry grateful both.
And so to save you we are nothing loth:
Eh, Wanky-Fum? (places his finger to his nose, and
winks at Wanky)
Wanky. (repeating the action) What—save 'em ? 'Iss, of
course, (chucks Jenny under the chin)
Jenny. Paws off! I don't want any Indian sauce.
Hokee. Come, by the shore my old canoe you'll find.
Atkins, (suspiciously) Your old canoe? Now, no ca-
noodling, mind!
Concerted Piece.—" Old Bob Ridley."
Hokee. Oh, white folks, for you we feel pity.
Wanky. Massa brave, and Missee pretty.
Hokee. We'll see you safe to the canoe.
Wanky. From mighty Hoop-de-dooden-doo.
Jenny. Oh! Hoop-de-dooden-doo.
Atkins. Oh! Hoop-de-dooden-doo.
All, Oh! Hoop-de-dooden-doo-oo—oo.
Oh! Hoop-de-dooden-doo.
(elaborate dance and exeunt, l,)
Scene Sixth.—The Virgin Forest.
* Dixey's Land," played by the orchestra, with an Indian'
drum accompaniment. Ente- a grand procession of
Indians dancing, r., then Hoop-de-dooden-doo, accom-
panied by Piccalillee, his favourite wife.
Hoop. Stop that vile tum-tuni, if you please this minute;
Your music's good but there's a sameness in it,
One note played for an hour appears to us
To be a leetle bit monotonous.
I'm used up, blase, really sick of life.
Piccal. Turn to your Piccalillee, to your wife;
You loved her once, but now your favourite squaw
I'ts very evident's become a baw. (weeps)
Hoop. You needn't blub-baw. (she cries aloud) Hush!
that rows's appalling;
(aside) My favourite squaw, is at her favourite
squalling.
Come, don't let fall those heavy sighs, please stop 'em,
As for those crocodilish tears just drop 'em.
Piccal. Oh, what a fool I was to marry you,
To become Mrs. Hoop-de-dooden-doo;
I might have had my cousin from Bermuda,
The noble minded and delightful Doodah I
His love for me devoured him quite he said.
Hoop. It would, but / devoured him, dear, instead.
Piccal. He would have made a good spouse.
Hoop. P'r'aps he would;
But as a second course he wasn't good.
Pical. I feel I love him still; pray emulate him.
Hoop. It's no use loving him, because I 'ate him.
Pical. You disagreed so with him.
Hoop, (aside) That may be,
He disagreed excessively with me.
Enter Hokge-Pokee, mysteriously, l.
Hokee. Retire, great King; behind the bushes hide }
Your Hokee-Pokee's brought you a new bride.
Hoop. My faithful Hokee
Hokee. Quick ! they come, they com*
Hoop. Friends, I've but one word, and that word is mum I
(Music.—All hide behind wings and set piece*)
Enter Wanky Fum, leading Jenny and Atkins, l.
Jenny. I don't like this at all. Where are we?—say !
Wanky. I've just discubbered that we've lost our way—
We always chop tht trees to mark our tracks.
(looking about for marks)
Jenny. In fact, when you don't know your way, you axe.
Wanky. Stop there—I'll seek and find a path no doubt.
Exit, k. u. E.
Atkins, (crying) Oh! if my mother knew that I was out
In these far distant wilds!
Enter Hoop-de-dooden-doo, from back, k.
Jenny, (with a smothered shriek) Oh ! who are you ?
Hoop, (blandly) Most interesting strangers, how de do ?
(Atkins is horribly alarmed, and shakes violently)
Hoop, (taking Jenny's hand) Lubly young female
Jenny. Nigger, let me go!
Who are you ?
Hoop. If you really wish to know,
(makes a war-whoop—the stage is covered instate
taneously with Indians, as in the great scene of the
"Lady of the Lake"—Atkins falls)
Hoop, (d la Roderick Dhu) These are my Carib warrior*
true,
And I am Hoop-de-dooden-doo ! (chord)
Jenny. What will become of us ?
Hoop. Miss, marry me.
You've c-ribbed the heart of this poor Carribbee.
(brandishing a tomahawk) If you don't wed this
Carib, you I'll gib dis!
Jenny. I feel that I'm 'tween Scylla and Charyb-dis.
Hoop. You shall be missus of my home and tribe—
There's something in your looks I can't describe.
Oh, Jenny, say you'll be my squaw.
Jenny. Get out, you.
Hoop. There is such a Jenny say s-quaw about you.
Duet, " Carry me bade to old Virginny."
Hoop. The mighty Hoop-de-dooden-doo'B
A monarch absolute,
And no one ever dare refuse
To smile upon his suit.
Jenny, But I'm a British maiden boldj
And Jenny begs to state,
You're ugly, black, and much too old,
So pray absquatulate.
Hoop, (spoken) Hab-squaw-too-late I
(sings) Oh, marry me smack, miss, or I die,
And nebber grin no more,
Jenny. You're Caribbee black, too old for Jenny,
Too old for Jenny a score.
(a short dance, and Jenny Pigtail is led up, a—
the Indians come and lift up Atkins, who is too
overcome with alarm to move—they place him
at back)
GRAND INDIAN BALLET.
During the revel, Friday, habited in a semi-Indian cos-
tume, enters, joins the dance, goes through some extra-
ordinary antics, and at last succeeds in arresting Jenny
Pigtail's attention ; he gives her a bottle, and expresses
by action that she is to give it to the Indians, and that
drowsiness will ensue; he does all this during his
dancing—the King and the Court are becoming rather
tipsy, and don't pay him much attention—Jenny Pigtail
pours some of the bottle's contents into the bowl, and
hands it about—all drink and become drowsy—at last
they all hang their heads simultaneously at one note, and
Friday beckons in Robinson Crusoe ; he enters, i. u. e.
Jenny, (wildly) My Robinson !
Crusoe. My Jane I
Jenny, (more wildly) What do I see?
Crusoe. My Jane!
Jenny My Robinson—'tis he I
Crusoe. 'Tisshe! (they embrace)
Friday, (after the manner of il comedy fathers") Bre-ss
you, my chilblains!
Music.—they steal off—as they go, Friday turns
and gives a tremendous " Ha, ha !" then scampers
off-—all the Indians rise, chattering, and bran-
dishing their weapons.
Hoop. She's gone ! (turning and seizing Atkins by the
throat)
What's come of her? Speak out ! Who's got her ?
Atkins. Leave me alone, you Caribbee garotter!
Hoop, (shaking him) Where has she gone, I say?
Atkins. Don't know, I tell 'ee.
Hoop, (throws him into the arms of the Indians) Cook him
at once, and serve with currant jelly.
As ven'son is just now a deal too dear,
I'll have a haunch from that fine 6ue-caneer !
(theyflourish their tomahawks round Atkins's head ;
Friday enters and fires off a musket into the air;
the Indians drop Atkins, who falls fiat, and
scamper off in the direst alarm; Friday capering
about in intense glee)
Scene Seventh.—A View in the Island. Robinson Crusob
rushes on with Jenny Pigtail reclining fainting in his
arms.
Crusoe. Thus far into the bowels of the land,
With this small female trifle on my hands,
Have I marched on, but now I fain would stop,
And in two senses have a little drop, (drops Jenny
gently, and taking out flask, drinks; Jenny
revives)
Ha ! ha! she wakes! Just taste of this, my beauty !
Jenny, (taking it) I looks to-wards you, Robinson—my
dooty!
(drinks) Now I'm quite well.
Crusoe. My Jenny rallies 1
Jenny. True;
With spirits people gene-rally do.
Crusoe. How do I find you here?
Jenny. Oh, I don't ktow.
There's nothing about me, dear, in De Foe.
Crusoe. But talking of defoe, where is de enemy ?
With his perambulating agapemone ?
Jenny, (objecting to the jingle) Enemy—pemone—that
rhyme's not perfection.
Crusoe. Oh, that's a niminy piminy objection.
But hide thee, Jane, here comes Will Atkins, fly!
(places Jenny behind wing r. and retires behind wing l.)
Atkins, (rushing in a la Macbeth) Why should I play
the Roman fool and die,
When I may liberty by living earn ?
Certainly not.
Crusoe, (rushing in d la Macduff") Turn, William Atkins,
turn.
Atkins. Of all men most have I avoided thee,
For you can whack me very easily.
Crusoe. I can ; come on!
Atkins. My weakness at you scoff;
Come on, indeed! this fight cannot come off.
Crusoe, (advancing) Your head shall though, and on a
pole we'll stick it.
Atkins. What?
Crusoe. As a frightful warning to the wicked.
Atkins. Cut off my head ?—I'll cut myself off first!
(is rushing off, r., when the Goat butts him back;
rushes, l., when he is met by the Parrot, with
open beak and distended wings)
This is too much!—with rage and hate I burst!
Of all the concentrated villanie
Of every ruffian that I e'er did see,
Standing at bay in Scene the Last, Act Three,
Of " Obi" or the " Forest of Bon-dee,"
Boils in my veins! Lay on, lay on, my Crusoe!
Consider you're already black and blue sol
(terrific combat, the Goat and Parrot acting as
seconds ; at last Crusoe misses his foot and falls
—Tyranny enters—Atkins is about to despatch
Crusoe, when Jenny rushes out and wards the
blow—at the same time the Dog flies on, and
fastening on to the neck of Atkins as in canine
dramas, drags him to the ground—they rise,
swing round, roll over, down to footlights and
backagain, Sfc.—Jenny goes ^Crusoe—Feioay
enters fighting Cutpuuse and Gouge-eye, whom
he conquers—enter Liberty—at her entrance the
Dog looses hold of Atkins and Friday lets go
Cutpurse and Gouge-eye)
Liber. Cease your insensate broils, its very clear
That it's high time for me to interfere—
Although I'm sorry thus to spoil what's fun for you.
Atkins. I give in.
Tyran. Give in! after all I've done for you!
Ungrateful snob, I leave you to your fate ! Exit.
Liber, (to Audience) Which is in your hands; as it's
getting late,
And droller creatures still your favour wait,
Our author asks me ere he takes his leave,
As 't has some trouble taken him to weave
This web of mere absurdity together,
To kill the evenings long of wintry weather.
Not to be hard upon his rhymes,—you see,
This is the season of tomfoolery,
When criticism his stern brow relaxes,
And Britons even smile upon the taxes:
Then smile on
Crusoe. Crusoe.
Atkins. Atkins.
Friday. Friday too.
Hoop, (entering) And not forgetting Hoop-de-dooden-doo I
2d EOBINSON CRUSOE. [SC. VII.
Jenny. Well, as our revels now are over——
Crusoe. Oh, say that we may live in clover.
Hoop. Our aim is but to raise a laugh;
Atkins. So with the clover mix no chaff.

pieces of wood are merely required, shaped
according to this design, and covered with the
paper; the proscenium having the appearance of
puffed .satin panels, in gold frames, with

Mv DEAR BLAKCnAItD,
It seems but a poor compliment to dedicate such an
unconnected string of doggrel as this to anybody; but, nevertheless,
I do dedicate it to you, in memory of the first Pantomime I ever
saw (two and twenty years ago, and, need I add, one of yours);
and in token of my sincere admiration for your unapproachable
talent as a concocter of wholesome Christmas fun.
Ever yours most sincerely
HENRY J. BYEON.
E. L. Blanchard, Esq..
ROBINSON CRUSOE.
Scene First.—The Common Hard at Hull, during the
war time. A public house and a tobacconist's shop, with
" Pigtail, Tobacconist" over the door. Serjeant Splen-
didshilling is reading the news from the seat of war
to the gaping Sailors and Seaport Loungers ; a Crier
ringing a bell, and distributing papers to the Sailors
and tlieir Sweethearts. All are laughing and chat'
ting as the scene opens to lively music, and the scene is
one of great bustle and stirring excitement.
Serj. (rising) Ladles and gen'lmen, I'm proud to say,
I read here in the paper of to-day,
We've beat them foreignors again.
All. (on the stage) Hooray!
Serj. But here comes Daddy Pigtail's pretty daughter,
I looks to-wards her; here ! more gin and water!
Music.—Enter Jenny Pigtail, r., followed by Billy
Bowline, Barney Bunting, and others.
Jenny. Now go along, you good-for-nothing crew,
I like your impudence, indeed I do.
Bow. (chucking her under the chin, r.) I know you like it.
Bunt, [ditto, l.) Course she likes it.
Jenny. Pah I
You sailors smell so horribly of tar,
It's really most unpleasant; then your words
Are terrible to hear, at least two thirds.
Breaking young women's hearts you fancy sport;
You have a wife you know in every port;
Which is by no means right, as you'll allow, sirs ;
Your manners are as loose as are your trousers.
Bunt. No matter; I for one will have a kiss.
(he attempts to kiss her, but fails)
Enter Daddy Pigtail, k.
Pig. Upon my word, extremely pretty, miss,
Such conduct I consider, Bunting
Bunt.- Pooh!
Pig. Sheer insolence! sheer off! she are not for you !
(Sailors grumble omd retire)
(bringing Jenny down) My child, I have a something
to impart;
You know young Craaoe ?
Jenny, (aside) Know him ? yes, by heart
Pig. He is a 'prentice, as you're well aware.
Jenny. Yes, at the Golden Teapot in the Square.
Pig. Ah, would that he were on the square as well.
Jenny. Oh, madness! misery! What mean you? Tell!
Pig. It wrings my heart. Oh, how—how shall I break it?
Jenny. Your heart?
Pig. No! no! (aside) I wonder how she'll take it.
(aloud) The fact is, Kobinson is poor.
Jenny. But proud.
Pig. Uncommonly! And I have had a crowd
Of applications—some of them are grand.
Behold! all these are offers for your hand.
(shews a huge bundle of letters)
Will Atkins, who's enriched by smuggler booty,
Is very anxious, dear, to pay his duty.
For with affection in his bosom rent
Jenny. Then let him pay it to the Government.
Pig. Why, here he is!
Enter Will Atkins, a buccaneer of the true Cobourg
stamp, enveloped in a rvugh pea jacket, and covered with
every variety of offensive weapon.
As p'raps I'm in the way,
I'll say ta ta! Exit, r.
Atkins, (kneeling to Jenny) The Government, you say?
You are my government, by persecution
You have induced in m« a levolution :
I used to smoke and drink and use bad language;
But now my bosom is a prey to anguiage.
Jenny. Oh, why do you torment me thus, you fright?
Atkins. Torment! Why, this tar meant to be polite.
Jenny. You're too polite, much too polite, I'm loth
With such a person to p-light my troth.
I have no fortin'.
Atkins. I for tin don't care.
I, who have fought in battles everywhere ;
In one I lost my eye, missing my fut
I go-t backer, also this short cut
(points to a piece of black plaister which extends
the entire length of his countenance)
I have a skiff—a skimmer of the sea,
And I ask if you will its missus be ?
'Tis in the offing ready quite for sailing.
Jenny. I've told you offing that it's unavailing.
Atkins. Hah! some land-lubber's cut my hopes in two,
No one can lub her as I used to do.
The Golden Teapot I (Jenny starts violently)
Hah! that tell-tale start!
(aside) That smug young grocer's arts engross her 'art.
(aloud) Each week he serves you with his mild Bohea.
Jenny. Yes, I confess he suits me to a tea.
Atkins. But in your cup of happiness I Boon
Will make a precious stir I
Jenny. You precious spoon!
Atkins. Durance mostvile I'll quickly have you clapped in:
(shouts) Cutpurse and Gouge-eye! Hoh! assist your
Captain!
Atkins seizes Jenny—Cutpurse and Gouge-eye, villain-
ous buccaneering ruffians, enter, L.
Jenny. What would you do?
Atkins. In vain, proud ge-url, you wrestle:
Seize her and carry her aboard my vessel!
(the Ruffians run after the Girl, and, missing her,
come whack against each other, this is repeated,
and they come with a thump against Atkins, who
strikes them, and seines Jenny)
Jenny, (struggling violently as she is being carried away)
Ruffians! this insolence shall cost you dear.
Help I help! Oh, Robinson, where are you!
Crusoe, (without, l.) Here!
Enter Robinson Crusoe, l.—he knocks down the two
Ruffians with back-handed blows, and floors Atkins
with a driver, then stands c. with Jenny insensible in
his arms.—Picture.
Look up, my lovely Jane : she faints, she dies!
Oblige your Robinson and ope your eyes.
Jenny, (reviving) Where am I ?
Crusoe. Don't you know your Crusoe's voice ?
Your Robinson, the husband of your choice ?
Atkin3. (on the ground) Oh, horror and despair! dis
pair get married!
With fiendish thoughts my bosom is old harried.
(to Crusoe) Young Crusoe, you'll repent that bitter
blow. (Crusoe about to strike him)
What! raise your fist against a fallen foe ?
Crusoe, (kicking him) Certainly not.
Atkins, (howls and rises) A kick my frame upon !
I'll be revenged—a kick—kick—ki—kome on!
Rushes off with his Men, r.
Enter Daddy Pigtail and Others, b.
Pig. My child! (embrace)
Jenny. He from the ruffian did me snatch ;
You must consent, papa dear( to the match.
Pig. You've saved my child, and as I'm glad to heaf
10" ROBINSON CEUSOE. [SC.I.
Crusoe. You give your kind consent ?
Pig. I do my boy j
As you are wealthy, why I wish you joy.
I always had a great regard for you,
So take my blessing and my daughter too.
Jenny. Oh, rapture! We'll have such a grocer's shop!
Rob. Isn't the prospect plummy ? Come, dear!
(going with Jenny, l., is stopped by the entrance of
Atkins, Cutpukse, Gouge-eye, $' Marines, l.)
Atkins. Stop!
(hurried music piano)
Crusoe. What means this interruption ? Stand aside !
Atkins. My brave associate!. s?ize the lovely bride.
(Cutpukse and Gouge-eye seize Jenny)
And as for Crusoe, if it s all the same,
The press-gang grabs him in King George's name !
(Crusoe is seized by the Marines)
Jenny. The press-gang! oh! (faints)
Atkins. You'll make a noble tar.
Rob. (struggling) Let me get at the villain!
Atkins, (folding his arms with the scornful aetion of
transpontine melodrame) Ha, ha, ha !
Behold, triumphant William Atkins grins !
(to Jenny) You spurned my offers, (to Crusoe)
And you kicked my shins!
It's my turn now. Aboard my vessel take her,
And if she won't wake up from fainting, shake her !
As for that whipper-snapper grocer's 'prentice,
Drag him away!
Crusoe, (in an agony of rage and despair) Oh! am I
compos mentis?
Music.—Crusoe h'eaks away, and Jenny revives,
they rush into ecten other's arms, but are dragged
away by Atkins and his Myrmidons. This is
repeated, and some of the Populace knock down
Press-gang, the Women fly at the Smugglers,
and there appears some chance for Crusoe and
Jenny, when Atkins seizes her in his arms and
carries her off, r. The Press-gang take off
Crusoe, l. The bustle, confusion, and noise
kept up till close of Scene,
Scene Second.—The Abode of Tyranny.
The Scene is heavy, dismal, and dark. Tyranny, who
enters, l., is dressed completely in black, and no colour of
any kind is visible in the Scene or its adjuncts. Oppres-
sion enters after Tyranny, holding a newspaper.
Tyban. (pacing the stage enraged) Bring me no more
reports, I'm savage,—sad.
The way I'm losing ground is much too bad.
King Tyranny, a monarch, once despotic,
Become the sport of any wild Quixotic
Adventurer, who, anxious for a row,
Forces my purblind followers to bow
Beneath his notions of Utopian rule !
Oppres. Cheer up, great king.
Tyran. (striking him) Oppression, you're a fooL
But if I can't o'er nations hold my sway,
O'er individuals perhaps I may.
And that reminds me of my protege !
Oppres. That pirate smuggler, Captain Atkins, hight.
Tyran. Ah, he's a pirate of the main and might—
A youth who'll do me, his protector, credit.
His deck, while strangers unsuspicious tread it,
Covers five hundred niggers !
Oppres. (rubbing his hands in glee) He, he, he !
Tyban. Ha, ha! the notion tickles you, I see.
(they both laugh heartily—Liberty rises in an
illuminated bower—her dress is of shining silver,
and stands out in marked contrast to the extreme
darkness of the Scene)
Tou here ! How could you an admittance gain ?
Oppression, didn't you put up the chain?
Libeb. I'm Liberty—the chain's not forged that binds me.
Tyran. (cowering) Oh, how she shines—her dazzling
brightness blinds me!
Liber. Yes; Liberty shines e'en your dungeons through:
But stay,—I've come to have a shine with you.
Duet.—Buckley's "Sleighing Song."
Libeb. Oh, in a pretty way, sir,
You've acting been of late;
And I have come tc-day, sir,
King Tyranny to rate,
Tyran. Miss Liberty,
You'd better be
Polite, I beg to state;
Or in a cell,
You'll find, " ma belle,"
Full time to ruminate.
Liber. I tingle, tingle, tingle, ting,
Your ugly neck to wring.
Tyran. Come recollect,
With some respect
You ought to treat a king.
You tingle, tingle, tingle, ting,
My luckless neck to wring.
Come recollect, &c.
Libeb, I tingle, tingle, tingle, ting,
Your ugly neck to wring.
But recollect,
With some respect,
I ought to treat a king.
Tyran. How didst thou enter ? That fact thou concealest
Liber. Why surely Liberty is on the free list.
Tyran. I know no free list but the public press,
The press-gang I allude to, madam.
Liber. Yes.
I am aware you hold that system dear,
Liberty's soldier is a volunteer,
Who caring little for the pay or pain,
With glory in his mind, not greed of gain,
With honour in his heart, not hopes of wealth,
Devotes his stock of manly British health
To help Oppression's victims o'er the sea,
To fling aside their fetters and be free!
But as to the occasion of my visit,
It is concerning poor young Crusoe.
Tyran. (doggedly) Ts it?
Liber. You have oppressed him sadly, sent him o'er
The sea a thousand weary miles or more.
A thousand weary miles.
Tyran. Ha! hal
Liber. _ You smiled,
As if yon thought euch treatment weary mild.
B
I say it's shameful! Be more generous, come.
Tykan. He's in my power and I will use it, mum,
For he's my William Atkins's sworn foe,
And enemy to Tyranny al-so.
(Liberty icavea her wand, the Scene opens, and the
vessel of war in which Crusoe is seen, appears
Calmly sailing before the breeze)
LibeK. Behold! his vessel rides before the gale,
With union flying and distended sail,
In safety through the briny foam she glides.
Tykan. In safety, eh? No longer thus she rides.
(the view dissolves and discloses a wreck)
Behold! the ocean's shattered masts and decks.
Hurray for old King Neptune ! Vivat wrecks !
Liber. But though a victim to your envious shafts,
Behold, poor king, there are such things as rafts,
On one he rides, defiant of the storm.
(Crusoe is seen riding on a raft)
Tyran. Confusion ! I'm uncomfortably warm.
Liber. He's saved, and having passed through numerous
dangers,
Amidst extremely cannibalish strangers,
Shall come back to his home, Lis snug fireside,
His old acquaintances and blooming bride,
Having achieved a name revered by all,
Loved by great people, idolized by small—
Not merely in his native land alone,
A " household word " wherever speech is known.
Come, as you've treated me to such a show,
I will return the compliment—let's go
And see my home. (Tyranny hangs back, alarmed)
Why, what have you to fear?
Tyr. Not if I know it!
Lib. Then I'll bring it here.
Tyr. Surely 'gainst common sense that is a crime.
Lib. Please to remember this is Christmas time;
Whoever looked for anything like reason
In pieces written for this madcap season ?
Good geniuses have always had the skill
To move thetr magic whereabouts at will,
The power to make her palace go and come,
Always had Liberty ad libitum.
(the Scene changes to the " Lucid Labyrinths of
Liberty Hall"—a shining silvery scene in which
everything is dazzlingly brilliant, except the black
form of Tyranny) ^
Lib. This specimen of fairy locomotion,
I think, you will admit was a bright notion.
Come, ladies, while my home my guest I show,
Please trip it on the " light fantastic toe."
GRAND BALLET.
(tableau—closed in by dark scene, which opens and
discovers)
Scene Third.—The Island. The air of " Oh, poor
Robinson Crusoe " played as it opens.
Enter, first the Dog, then the Parrot, the Goat, and
Jinally, Crusoe ; he is dressed in the regular semi-
savage dress, his beard is long, his hair matted.
Medley song—Air, " Robinson Crusoe."
Crusoe. Please suppose since the last
Scene, just two years have passed;
I beg you politely to do so.
Beneath this disguise
You perhaps recognize
Unfortunate Robinson Crusoe.
I had bought my intended her trousseau;
It was premature rather to do so;
For I pressed was by force,
Which proceeding, of course,
Spoilt the plans of poor Robinson Crusoe.
Air, " Wobbledewoe."
(looking round miserably) " I'm monarch of all I surrey,
My right there is none to dispute,"
As some future poet will say
Of this poor unfortunate brute.
Oh! wretched Crusoe, oh I
Oh! most unlucky Crusoe, oh!
(the Animals, standing in a line, join in the chorus)
Through existence so lonely I jog,
For company only have that
Of my cat and my parrot and dog—
(very miserably) And my dog and my parrot and cat?
Oh ! wretched Crusoe, oh !
Oh! most unlucky Crusoe, oh!
Although this solitude begins to pall,
It has some trifling comforts, after all.
No Christmas bills for bread, for meat, for tea,
No rent and taxes ever worry me.
This rich ground raises me all sorts of fruits,
And in the rainy season my corn shoots.
(dog barks) For lack of loaves I'm never in the hole,
My faithful dog can always bark-a-roll.
No fear of petty robberies have I,
As no one's near I dread no fellow nigh.
I dread no burglars, for I haven't got tin,
No close garotting, for my clothes go rotting.
A rich warm sun we luckily have got, (reflectively
observing the Parrot)
A rich warm sun—yes, and a poor parr-ot.
I feel no winter's wind, however cutting, (the Goat
butts him)
Mapped by my great goat, with his large horn butting.
But sorrow's fruitless, so I bury mine,
And I sow meZon-choly, don't reap pine.
(Music ; he discovers a footprint on the sand, and
starts)
Ha! ha! what do I see ? a footprint, surely!
(kneels down, and places his eye close to it)
It is a footprint—oh, I'm very poorly!
The prints from some great black—oh dear, I wince,
As did the foreigners at our Black Prince.
If he's a cannibal—with fears I pant—
He'll come and nab this poor in'abitant.
(an Indian howl heard, r.)
Oh! I foresee that we shall come to grief,
' That howl proceeds from some hould Indian chief.
My courage rapidly is oozing from me,
His tommy-hawk will slice my ana-tommy.
Another howl—Robinson skips back with the
animals, r., Friday rushes on, r., and hides, l.—
Hokee-Pokee and Wanky-Fum, two fierce
Indiansjump on to the stage, from R., brandishing
their tomahawks fiercely.
Hokee, De pris'ner am escaped! Oh, Wanky-Fum !
(the Indian drum heard, r.)
De Indian drum!—turn, turn! Come, Fum.
Wanky. Some mm!
(pulls out a bottle, flourishes it—Friday comes
close behind him and takes the bottle out of his
hand, hides—Wanky-Fum turns upon Hokee-
Pokee, and they fight— they rush at each other,
miss, and as they get to r. and l., Robinson
strikes one and Friday the other—they jump
round at each other—an Indian whoop heard, r.)
Hokee. De signal of great Hoop-de-dooden-doo!
Wanky, me lub you.
Wanky. Hokee, me lub you.
(they embrace and go off, r.)
(Music.—Robinson and Friday advance—Friday
exhibits great awe and alarm—Crusoe offers
his hand in a friendly way, and Friday becomes
more easy, advancing, grinning, and nodding)
Crusoe. All apprehension, sombre party, smother;
Although you're black, you are a man and brother.
So tell me who you are, by action, nicely.
(Music.—Friday goes through pantomimic action,
expressive of having been taken captive, <$'<:.)
You have been taken prisoner!—precisely,
(Music.—Friday expresses his horror at the idea
of being eaten)
And not desiring to be eaten, you
Gave them the slip.
(Music.—Friday expresses his grief at his forlorn
condition)
You don't know what to do ?
Come now, what can you do ? Canst fish ?
(Music.—Friday expresses his piscatorial powers)
You can ?
(ande) He'd really make a first-rate servant-roan,
And would particularly useful be;
He wouldn't cost me much for livery ;
That is indeed a thing he ne'er can lack,
Nature provides him with a suit of black.
(to Friday) Wilt be my servant?
Friday. Oh iss, massa; me
You did deliber from de massa-cree.
I'll be your slave.
(kneels and places Crusoe's foot upon his head)
Crusoe. My slave, soft-hearted flat!
No, no, I place my wee toe upon that.
(gives Friday a playful kick, Friday falls flat
and appears attracted by a sound—he listens
eagerly—Indian music heard pianissimo, Friday
becomes violently agitated)
The Indians! Ha! they're coming you to nail;
With strong Attacks to levy their black male.
(Friday weeps)
He weeps ! forth from his eyes his dreadful doom
After the levee is a drawing rheum.
Friday, (in a state of feverish excitement) One, two, tree men!
Crusoe, (alarmed) I'd bolt at once outright,
But I am in one too tre-men-dous fright
Let's see, this day's a Friday—horrid thought!
'Twill truly be a, fry day if we're caught.
(a war whoop heard, r., Friday and Crusoe fall
back to back)
We shall be boiled, w go to make a stew;
They'll make black puddings, my young friend, of you:
Or cook you like a rabbit, and of course
Of poor young Crusoe they will make white sauce.
(the Indian drum heard—Crusoe clutches Friday
and they vialk tremulously across the stage to the
following song)
Air, " The Indian Drum."
Crusoe. Hark! 'tis the Indian drum I
(Friday supplies a refrain with a musical shudder)
(faintly) Hark I 'tis the Indian drum!
(Friday shudders)
{on tip-toe) Softly, softly, follow me,
Or discovered shall we be.
Hark, hark, hark! 'tis the Indian drum!
Abrupt note— Crusoe and Friday make a sudden
comic exit, l.
Scene Fourth.—The Interior of Crusoe's Dwelling, as
described in the work, with additional modern articles
of consumption, #c. A large barrel labelled " Flour,"
r.; a table, c, with two rough chairs; large pepper
box and salt box ; looking glass, clothes horse, fyc.
Music.—Crusoe and Friday appear scrambling over the
palisade at the back—Friday exhibits great comic terror,
and they continually get in each other's way; just as
Crusoe is getting over, Friday pulls him back, the same
when Friday is nearly over; at length Crusoe gets over
and slips on to the stage, Friday follows and falls on
him, Crusoe shouts and Friday jumps up and pulls
Crusoe on to his legs, apologising in extravagant action:
he seizes a gigantic clothes brush.
Crusoe. Thank'ee, be quiet, if it's all the same.
Oh ! by the way, you haven't got a name;
Stay—as to-day is Friday, that'll do
As well as any other one for you;
So recollect, you're Friday from to-day:
You are my man of all work, and shall stay-
So long as you behave yourself—with me ;
You'll have no wages, and you'll find your tea,
Your beer, your sugar, and your livery.
For dinner you will have to hunt about;
You'll have no followers, no Sundays out
Should Indians come, or any such disaster,
You'll have to fight in service of your master.
Of course you'll cook my dinner, clean the plate,
Sit up to let me in when I'm out late ;
If you're knocked up you're never to declare it,
And when I spank your nob, you'll grin and bear it
Now, as I'm going out, some game to track,
Have a meat pie made by the time I'm back.
(Music.—Crusob goes up and off" by the ladder,
over the palisade ; Friday goes to the flour barrel
and fetches out some dough, which he places on
the table; then he brings on a large pie-disk,
which he places, c, seizes a jar labelled " Butter,"
and, taking some out, butters the inside of the
pie-dish, sucking his fingers after so doing, and
greasing his woolly head ; he takes then a large
knife, and, after feeling the edge, cuts slices of
ham. from one hanging, v.; these he places in the
pie-dish, then peppers violently, sneezing occasion-
ally into tha pig; when his back is turned, the
Parrot enters and snatches a slice of ham, and
runs, r. ; the Goat enters and attempts to take it
from the Parrot ; Friday, discovering the theft,
strikes the Goat, who butts at him and sends him
backwards, in a sitting posture, into the pie- dish ;
the Dog enters, seizes the meat from the Parrot,
and runs to a corner with it; Friday gets out of
the dish, a piece of ham adhering to his back—
this he picks off and returns, carefully scraping
the grease off his clothes and putting it back into
the dish ; he tlien runs and lifts up the lid of the
flour barrel, putting his head and shoulders into
it; the Parrot gives him a peck at the calf, and
the Goat tilts down the lid on his head; he
wriggles about in extreme discomfort, until he
succeeds in getting himself out together with some
dough for paste, which he places on the table ; he
then seizes the rolling pin, flours it, beats out and
rolls'the paste, then places the pin on the table; the
Doa seizes it and runs away—Friday after him ;
he' succeeds in regaining it, and strikes the Dog,
who yelps ; Friday returns to the work of the pie,
.' and drops some of the dough on the floor; he
picks it up and picks out carefully several foreign
substances, amongst them an enormous hair, which
takes him some time to extract; he then covers the
dish with the paste, and gazes fondly on the pie
with conscious pride of an artist; the Parrot
- digs his long beak into the middle of the pie and
rushes away with a large piece of the paste;
Friday tears his wool in agony of rage; he
catches the Parrot and seizes the paste, pulling
violently ; the Parrot open his beak, and Friday
tumbles back ; he then rushes to the pie, claps the
piece of paste over the hole, and beats it down
with the rolling pin; just at this moment an
Indian howl is heard, just outside the palisade ;
Friday's knees drop together, he drops the rolling
pin into the pie, and shivers violently; the Parrot,
Dog, and Goat tremble terribly and exhibit
awful alarm, they sneak of, trembling ; Friday
turns and observes three long feathers swaying
backwards and forwards at the top of the palisade;
Friday, in a state of abject terror, hides himself
under the table ; the three Indians climb over the
palisade — Hokee-Pokee, "Wanky-Fum, and
their King, Hoopdeedoodendoo, a very fat
monarch, completely covered with ornaments;
Hokee-Pokeb and Wanky-Fum drop down on
to stage, but the King sticks on the palisade,
unable to move)
Hoop. Come, treat your monarch dread with more respect,
Him not de King of Naples recollect.
(the Indians help him down—he is very fat, un-
wieldy, and bald-headed)
I more resemble t'other one;—What's called he ?
I'm a bald Carib—oh, ah ! Carib-baldi!
(feeling his head)
Me got no heir, so when I die, my friends,
The Hoopdedoodendoo dy-nasty ends.
(starts) What do I see ? A human pie, by gum !
I stick to that! (reads from bottle) What's this?
"Jamaica Rum!"
. I thought nobody libbed upon this island,
It's plain that some one's been here alongwhile,and—
(seizes the pepper-box and smells it, sneezes horribly,
shakes the box, and Hokee-Pskee and Wanky-
Fum sneeze; they sneeze about the stage, and
bump against each other ; the Indians taste every-
thing, and squabble over the pie, slapping each
other with the slices of ham; they fill a cup with
rum, and sit round the table, drinking; they all
have their hands on the table ; suddenly, Friday
raps the table violently; the three Indians be-
come alarmed)
Hoop. The sperrets are a rapping, Wanky-fum,
P'raps you don't know that I'm a medi-um.
Hokee. (sceptically) Rubbish! their presence I •hould
like to feel
(Friday catchet hold of Hokee-Pokee's leg—he
is in horrible alarm, and tries to get away—the
others laugh immensely at him)
Oh ! oh ! the sperret's got me by the heel!
(Friday raises the table, and it begins to turn; the
Indians go round with it after the fashion of
table turners; it becomes more rapid, and they
tumble; Friday throws the table flat on to them,
and escapes into the flour barrel; comic business
en the part of the King, who looks up and
gradually rises, kicking his brother Indians;
they become jovial, when they see the lid of the
four barrel moving, and they all tremble and
sneak towards the palisade; suddenly Friday
pops his head (covered with the table cloth which
he has taken with him into the barrel) out of
the barrel; the Indians give a simultaneous
howl, and jump at the top of the palisade, they
hang on; the Goat rushes on, and butts at the
hanging form of the King; the Dog seizes Hokee-
Pokee, and the Parrot digs his beak into
Wanky-Fum's back, and hangs suspended from
him; Friday howls, andrattles the flour barrel lid
'with violent yatieulations; the Indians swing,
roaring as the scene closes)
Scene Fifth.—Creek in the Island, with the Wreck of
Atkins's Vessel in the distance.
Music—Enter Will Atkins, followed by Jenny Pigtail
who has her hair down, and has the wild determined
manner of melodramatic heroines in the Third Act.
Atkins. This in the elements is nice behaviour,
To go and wreck my copper-bottomed slavier.
We're on a desert island, lovely Jane,
You'll never see your native land again:
Therefore make up your mind to marry me—-
Don't silly be, but shun celibacy.
Your Crusoe's drowned, so, Jenny, what's the use in
Your ardent William Atkins still refusing ?
Why will you thus upon your lover frown ?
Jenny, [proudly) My Robinson was never born to drown.
Oh, Crusoe! Crusoe! oh, where art thou, Crusoe ?
Though Atkins doth your memory abuse, oh !
For you, since Fate says we can't be a pair,
I'll wear the willow, as your well-o-ware.
In single blessedness my days I'll drag out
(in great despair, and very loudly) Oh, Crusoe !
Atkins, (savagely) Silence! or I'll bring the gag out^
And clap it on your mouth—I seldom brags!
Jenny. An honourable actor never gags.
Atkins. I'm not an actor—I'm an amateur.
(aside) That is to say, that I'm in love with her.
(fiercely) You shall be mine, whether willin' or not.
(Music—as he advances she seizes from his belt a
large horse pistol, and stands at bay)
Jenny. Willin! you will in coming on be shot,
Therefore, come on at once ! (wildly) Ha, ha, ha, ha!
Atkins, (mildly) Miss P., you're not at the Victori-a.
Though the lorn damsels there you thus burlesque, you
Will find no gallant tar come to the rescue.
I've been too long on the high seas to fear you,
And thus I seize you, pretty little dear, you.
Music.—They rush across and miss— Jenny fires the pistol,
which takes effect on Hokee-Pokee, who is entering, e.
—and Atkins's cutlass sticks into Wanky-Fum, who is
entering, l.—they fall as if done for.
Jenny. Oh dear, oh dear, I've killed a man I fear.
Atkins. It's nothing when you're used to it, my dear.
Hokee. (sitting up) But I ain't dead.
Jenny, (running to him, and placing a flask to his lips)
Poor black, since you alive are,
And do not die, just try this black reviver.
(Hokee takes to it very kindly—Wanky watches him)
Hokee. Gollopshus! Oh, I'm all alive with this.
Wanky. (sittingup) I beg to state/ain't dead neither, miss.
(Jenny drops Hokee's head, which has been sup-
ported by her knee—it falls with a hard thump on
the stage—she runs to Wanky and gives him drink)
Jenny. Oh, say that you're alive again, pray do, man.
Atkins, (a, watching Jenny) Bewi^hing sight to see a
tender wooman
Tender assistance to the other gender.
Wanky. (pinching Jenny's arm) 'Iss wassa—she look
berry nice and tender.
Hokee. If she's discubbered by that chief of ours,
He berry soon will pay her his devours.
(an Indian whoop heard—Jenny and Atkins are
terribly alarmed—and the Indians jump on to
their feet)
Jenny. An Indian whoop !
Wanky. 'Iss missy, berry true!
Dat ar's the whoop of Hoop-de-dooden-doo I
Jenny. Where can we fly ?
Hokee. We're berry grateful both.
And so to save you we are nothing loth:
Eh, Wanky-Fum? (places his finger to his nose, and
winks at Wanky)
Wanky. (repeating the action) What—save 'em ? 'Iss, of
course, (chucks Jenny under the chin)
Jenny. Paws off! I don't want any Indian sauce.
Hokee. Come, by the shore my old canoe you'll find.
Atkins, (suspiciously) Your old canoe? Now, no ca-
noodling, mind!
Concerted Piece.—" Old Bob Ridley."
Hokee. Oh, white folks, for you we feel pity.
Wanky. Massa brave, and Missee pretty.
Hokee. We'll see you safe to the canoe.
Wanky. From mighty Hoop-de-dooden-doo.
Jenny. Oh! Hoop-de-dooden-doo.
Atkins. Oh! Hoop-de-dooden-doo.
All, Oh! Hoop-de-dooden-doo-oo—oo.
Oh! Hoop-de-dooden-doo.
(elaborate dance and exeunt, l,)
Scene Sixth.—The Virgin Forest.
* Dixey's Land," played by the orchestra, with an Indian'
drum accompaniment. Ente- a grand procession of
Indians dancing, r., then Hoop-de-dooden-doo, accom-
panied by Piccalillee, his favourite wife.
Hoop. Stop that vile tum-tuni, if you please this minute;
Your music's good but there's a sameness in it,
One note played for an hour appears to us
To be a leetle bit monotonous.
I'm used up, blase, really sick of life.
Piccal. Turn to your Piccalillee, to your wife;
You loved her once, but now your favourite squaw
I'ts very evident's become a baw. (weeps)
Hoop. You needn't blub-baw. (she cries aloud) Hush!
that rows's appalling;
(aside) My favourite squaw, is at her favourite
squalling.
Come, don't let fall those heavy sighs, please stop 'em,
As for those crocodilish tears just drop 'em.
Piccal. Oh, what a fool I was to marry you,
To become Mrs. Hoop-de-dooden-doo;
I might have had my cousin from Bermuda,
The noble minded and delightful Doodah I
His love for me devoured him quite he said.
Hoop. It would, but / devoured him, dear, instead.
Piccal. He would have made a good spouse.
Hoop. P'r'aps he would;
But as a second course he wasn't good.
Pical. I feel I love him still; pray emulate him.
Hoop. It's no use loving him, because I 'ate him.
Pical. You disagreed so with him.
Hoop, (aside) That may be,
He disagreed excessively with me.
Enter Hokge-Pokee, mysteriously, l.
Hokee. Retire, great King; behind the bushes hide }
Your Hokee-Pokee's brought you a new bride.
Hoop. My faithful Hokee
Hokee. Quick ! they come, they com*
Hoop. Friends, I've but one word, and that word is mum I
(Music.—All hide behind wings and set piece*)
Enter Wanky Fum, leading Jenny and Atkins, l.
Jenny. I don't like this at all. Where are we?—say !
Wanky. I've just discubbered that we've lost our way—
We always chop tht trees to mark our tracks.
(looking about for marks)
Jenny. In fact, when you don't know your way, you axe.
Wanky. Stop there—I'll seek and find a path no doubt.
Exit, k. u. E.
Atkins, (crying) Oh! if my mother knew that I was out
In these far distant wilds!
Enter Hoop-de-dooden-doo, from back, k.
Jenny, (with a smothered shriek) Oh ! who are you ?
Hoop, (blandly) Most interesting strangers, how de do ?
(Atkins is horribly alarmed, and shakes violently)
Hoop, (taking Jenny's hand) Lubly young female
Jenny. Nigger, let me go!
Who are you ?
Hoop. If you really wish to know,
(makes a war-whoop—the stage is covered instate
taneously with Indians, as in the great scene of the
"Lady of the Lake"—Atkins falls)
Hoop, (d la Roderick Dhu) These are my Carib warrior*
true,
And I am Hoop-de-dooden-doo ! (chord)
Jenny. What will become of us ?
Hoop. Miss, marry me.
You've c-ribbed the heart of this poor Carribbee.
(brandishing a tomahawk) If you don't wed this
Carib, you I'll gib dis!
Jenny. I feel that I'm 'tween Scylla and Charyb-dis.
Hoop. You shall be missus of my home and tribe—
There's something in your looks I can't describe.
Oh, Jenny, say you'll be my squaw.
Jenny. Get out, you.
Hoop. There is such a Jenny say s-quaw about you.
Duet, " Carry me bade to old Virginny."
Hoop. The mighty Hoop-de-dooden-doo'B
A monarch absolute,
And no one ever dare refuse
To smile upon his suit.
Jenny, But I'm a British maiden boldj
And Jenny begs to state,
You're ugly, black, and much too old,
So pray absquatulate.
Hoop, (spoken) Hab-squaw-too-late I
(sings) Oh, marry me smack, miss, or I die,
And nebber grin no more,
Jenny. You're Caribbee black, too old for Jenny,
Too old for Jenny a score.
(a short dance, and Jenny Pigtail is led up, a—
the Indians come and lift up Atkins, who is too
overcome with alarm to move—they place him
at back)
GRAND INDIAN BALLET.
During the revel, Friday, habited in a semi-Indian cos-
tume, enters, joins the dance, goes through some extra-
ordinary antics, and at last succeeds in arresting Jenny
Pigtail's attention ; he gives her a bottle, and expresses
by action that she is to give it to the Indians, and that
drowsiness will ensue; he does all this during his
dancing—the King and the Court are becoming rather
tipsy, and don't pay him much attention—Jenny Pigtail
pours some of the bottle's contents into the bowl, and
hands it about—all drink and become drowsy—at last
they all hang their heads simultaneously at one note, and
Friday beckons in Robinson Crusoe ; he enters, i. u. e.
Jenny, (wildly) My Robinson !
Crusoe. My Jane I
Jenny, (more wildly) What do I see?
Crusoe. My Jane!
Jenny My Robinson—'tis he I
Crusoe. 'Tisshe! (they embrace)
Friday, (after the manner of il comedy fathers") Bre-ss
you, my chilblains!
Music.—they steal off—as they go, Friday turns
and gives a tremendous " Ha, ha !" then scampers
off-—all the Indians rise, chattering, and bran-
dishing their weapons.
Hoop. She's gone ! (turning and seizing Atkins by the
throat)
What's come of her? Speak out ! Who's got her ?
Atkins. Leave me alone, you Caribbee garotter!
Hoop, (shaking him) Where has she gone, I say?
Atkins. Don't know, I tell 'ee.
Hoop, (throws him into the arms of the Indians) Cook him
at once, and serve with currant jelly.
As ven'son is just now a deal too dear,
I'll have a haunch from that fine 6ue-caneer !
(theyflourish their tomahawks round Atkins's head ;
Friday enters and fires off a musket into the air;
the Indians drop Atkins, who falls fiat, and
scamper off in the direst alarm; Friday capering
about in intense glee)
Scene Seventh.—A View in the Island. Robinson Crusob
rushes on with Jenny Pigtail reclining fainting in his
arms.
Crusoe. Thus far into the bowels of the land,
With this small female trifle on my hands,
Have I marched on, but now I fain would stop,
And in two senses have a little drop, (drops Jenny
gently, and taking out flask, drinks; Jenny
revives)
Ha ! ha! she wakes! Just taste of this, my beauty !
Jenny, (taking it) I looks to-wards you, Robinson—my
dooty!
(drinks) Now I'm quite well.
Crusoe. My Jenny rallies 1
Jenny. True;
With spirits people gene-rally do.
Crusoe. How do I find you here?
Jenny. Oh, I don't ktow.
There's nothing about me, dear, in De Foe.
Crusoe. But talking of defoe, where is de enemy ?
With his perambulating agapemone ?
Jenny, (objecting to the jingle) Enemy—pemone—that
rhyme's not perfection.
Crusoe. Oh, that's a niminy piminy objection.
But hide thee, Jane, here comes Will Atkins, fly!
(places Jenny behind wing r. and retires behind wing l.)
Atkins, (rushing in a la Macbeth) Why should I play
the Roman fool and die,
When I may liberty by living earn ?
Certainly not.
Crusoe, (rushing in d la Macduff") Turn, William Atkins,
turn.
Atkins. Of all men most have I avoided thee,
For you can whack me very easily.
Crusoe. I can ; come on!
Atkins. My weakness at you scoff;
Come on, indeed! this fight cannot come off.
Crusoe, (advancing) Your head shall though, and on a
pole we'll stick it.
Atkins. What?
Crusoe. As a frightful warning to the wicked.
Atkins. Cut off my head ?—I'll cut myself off first!
(is rushing off, r., when the Goat butts him back;
rushes, l., when he is met by the Parrot, with
open beak and distended wings)
This is too much!—with rage and hate I burst!
Of all the concentrated villanie
Of every ruffian that I e'er did see,
Standing at bay in Scene the Last, Act Three,
Of " Obi" or the " Forest of Bon-dee,"
Boils in my veins! Lay on, lay on, my Crusoe!
Consider you're already black and blue sol
(terrific combat, the Goat and Parrot acting as
seconds ; at last Crusoe misses his foot and falls
—Tyranny enters—Atkins is about to despatch
Crusoe, when Jenny rushes out and wards the
blow—at the same time the Dog flies on, and
fastening on to the neck of Atkins as in canine
dramas, drags him to the ground—they rise,
swing round, roll over, down to footlights and
backagain, Sfc.—Jenny goes ^Crusoe—Feioay
enters fighting Cutpuuse and Gouge-eye, whom
he conquers—enter Liberty—at her entrance the
Dog looses hold of Atkins and Friday lets go
Cutpurse and Gouge-eye)
Liber. Cease your insensate broils, its very clear
That it's high time for me to interfere—
Although I'm sorry thus to spoil what's fun for you.
Atkins. I give in.
Tyran. Give in! after all I've done for you!
Ungrateful snob, I leave you to your fate ! Exit.
Liber, (to Audience) Which is in your hands; as it's
getting late,
And droller creatures still your favour wait,
Our author asks me ere he takes his leave,
As 't has some trouble taken him to weave
This web of mere absurdity together,
To kill the evenings long of wintry weather.
Not to be hard upon his rhymes,—you see,
This is the season of tomfoolery,
When criticism his stern brow relaxes,
And Britons even smile upon the taxes:
Then smile on
Crusoe. Crusoe.
Atkins. Atkins.
Friday. Friday too.
Hoop, (entering) And not forgetting Hoop-de-dooden-doo I
2d EOBINSON CRUSOE. [SC. VII.
Jenny. Well, as our revels now are over——
Crusoe. Oh, say that we may live in clover.
Hoop. Our aim is but to raise a laugh;
Atkins. So with the clover mix no chaff.
