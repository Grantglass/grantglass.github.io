Johnson's Court, London.LIFE OF THE AUTHOR,

DANIEL DE FOE was born in London about
the year 1663. His father was a butcher; and the
family name was Foc, until our author, for some
unknown reason, changed it to De Foe. He was
probably intended for trade; but very soon after he
had received such education as a school at Newing-
ton-green afforded,_he became a political writer.
He afterwards engaged in business as a hosier, and
then as a pantile-maker ; but in both was unsuccess-
ful. His head was frequently employed on pro.
jects, and he even wrote an essay on that subject;
but he was always either unskilful or unfortunate.
It is, however, much to his credit that he continued
satisfying the demands of his creditors, as he was
able, until they were paid the whole amount of
their debts.

The first of his performances which excited much
attention was ' The True-Born Englishman,' pub-
lished in 1701. This was a poetical satire, in de-
fence of King William, who, at that time, was
blamed for employing foreigners as his friends at
court. During the popularity of this piece, he
wrote another satire, called ' Reformation of Man-
ners,' in which, among other topics, appeared one
of the first ccnsures on the slave trade.

As De Foe was a wit, he often employed an iro-
nical way of writing which the age was too dull
to comprehend. In this style, he wrotea pamphlet,
entitled ' The Shortest Way with the Dissenters,
or Proposals for the Establishment of the Church.'
It was, in fact, a defence of the Dissenters, but so
ill understood, that the House of Commons pro-
nounced it to be a seditious libel; and De Foe suf-
fered fine, imprisonment, and the pillory; the latter
of which punishments he bore with great fortitude,
and amused himself by writing ' A Hymn to the
Pillory,' during his confinement. In February,
1703-4, while in Newgalc, he commenced a periodi.
cal publication, called the ' Review,' which has
been supposed, and not without some reason, to
have given rise to the Tatler and Spectator. At
length he was liberated, by the interposition of Mr.
Harley, afterwards Lord Oxford, and resumed his
occupation of political writing. Among his prin-
cipal productions of this kind, were ' J ure Divino,'
a poetical satire, in twelve books, against arbitrary
government; and ' The History of the Union,' which
has lately been reprinted: to promote this, he was
sent to Scotland,where he wrote a poem,in honour
of the inhabitants of that country, called ' Caledo-
nia.' He wrote also, ' The History of Addresses,'
and some pamphlets in favour of the house of Hano-
ver, which, being written in an ironical style, were
unfortunately mistaken for defences of the Pretend-
er, and the author was again prosecuted and im-
prisoned. These misfortunes induced him, about
the year 1715, to relinquish politics altogether, and
employ his pen on subjects of morals or manners.
I-lis performances in this way were chiefly ' The
' Family Instructor,' in dialogues, a work to which
Richardson in his novels owes great obligation. He
wrote also in the same form ' Religious Courtship,'
and the narratives of ' Robinson Crusoe,' ' The Life
of Captain Singleton,' ' Colonel Jack,' ' Moll F lan-
ders,' ' Duncan Campbell,' and ' The Fortunate
Mistress.' The morality of some of these has been
justly questioned, but they have all the fascinations
of simplicity of style and probability of adventure,
and all enjoyed a considerable share of popularity.
In 1722, he wrote a ' Journal of the Plague in 1665,'
which, although a fiction, imposed on Dr. Mead,
who considered it as a book of authority. I-Ie pub-
lished also three volumes of ' Travels through Eng-
land and Scotland,' which have been the foundation
of all the complete tours and other publications of
that kind since. In this manner, for several years,
he continued to publish treatises, or pieces of fic-
tion, many of which are no longer read; and his
poetry, it must be confessed, is only valuable as in-
cluding hints of the events and political characters
of the times.

He died at his house at Islington, in 1731,1eav-
ing a'danghtcr, who was married to Mr. H. Baker,
the ingenious naturalist.

Of all his writings, that which is now before the
reader has ever been the most popular. It was first
published in 1719; and, perhaps, few years have
since passed without its being reprinted in some
convenient form. A story has long prevailed that
De Foe defrauded a Scotch seaman, of the name of
Selkirk, of his papers, orjournals, and made them
the foundation of this novel. That such a seamen
existed, and was shipwrecked, and afterwards
wrote a journal, is probable enough; but that he
contributed more than the mere suggestion of writ-
ing Robinson Crusoe, it is impossible to believe,
nor have we any authenticated facts in favour of
the supposition. Robinson Crusoe, in all its essen-
' tial points, is a pure fiction, and displays a reach
of invention which had never before appeared in
any English work of the kind; a fertility of fancy
and genius which De Foe could have borrowed
from no source, but the inexhaustible fund of his
own mind. In adapting his style to the supposed
situation and rank of Crusoe, he is eminently suc~
cessful; simplicity and perspicuity being so uni-
formly preserved, that, perhaps, it is impossible to
name a work so fascinating to young and uneu.
lightened minds, or so happily adapted to their
comprehension. It has, for nearly a century, been
one of the most popular books in our language, and
translation into most of the European languages
has rendered it the subject of admiration abroad.
It has been well observed, that it breathes through-
out a spirit of piety and benevolence, and sets in a
very striking light the importance of the mechanic
arts: it fixes in the mind a lively idea of the hor-
rors of solitude, and, consequently, of the sweets of

social life, and of the blessings we derive from corn
versation and mutual aid.
I WASJJOrn in the year 1632, in the city of York,

of a good family, though not of that country,
my father being a foreigner of Bremen, who settled
first at Hull. He got a good estate by merchandise,
and, leaving oll' his trade, lived afterwards at York;
from whence he had married my mother, whose re-
lations were named Robinson, a very good family in.
that country, and from whom I was called Robinson
Krcutznaer ; but,hy the nSual corruption of words
in England, we are now called, nay, we call our-
selves, and write our name, Crusoe; and so my
companions always called me.

I had two elder brothers; one of whom was lieu-
?tenant-colonel to an English regimentoffoot in Flan-

' 'ders, formerly commanded by the famous colonel
|Lockhart, and was killed at the battle near Dunkirk
.-against the Spaniards. What bt'CallK'. of my second

'I.hrother 1 never knew, any more than my father or
another did know what was become of me.

Being the third son of the family, and nonbred to
.any trade, my head began to be filled very early with
rambling thoughts. My father, who was very an-
:'cient, had given me a competent share of learning,

' -~as far as house-education and a country free~school
-.-gencrally goes, and designed me for the law; but I
would be satisfied with nothing but going to sea:
' . and my inclination to'tliis led me so strongly against
--the will, nay, the commands of my father, and
against all the cntreaties and persuasions of my me-
ther and other friends, that there seemed to be some.
xvthing fatal in that propension of nature, tending di~
:ectly to the life of misery which was to befal me..
B
My father, a wise and grave man, gave me se-
rious and excellent counsel against what he foresaw '
was my design. He called me one morning into his
chamber, where he was confined by the gout, and
expostulated very warmly with me upon this subject. a
He asked me what reasons, more than a mere wan-
dering inclination, I had for leaving my father's:
house, and my native country; where I might be'
well introduced, and had a prospect of raising my
fortune by application and industry, with a life of l
ease and pleasure. He told me it was men of des
perate fortunes on one hand, or of aspiring snpe
rior fortunes on the other, who went abroad upon-
adventures, to rise by enterprise, and make them.
selves famous in undertakings of a nature out of the
common road; that these things were all either too
far'above me, or too far below me; that mine was '
the middle state, or-what might be called the upper
station of low life, which he had found, by long:

,expcrience, was the best state in the world; the,
most suited to human happiness, not exposed to the"
miseries and hardships, the labour and sufferings, oi
the mechanic part of mankind; and not embarrassed;
with the pride, luxury, ambition, and envy of the
Upper part of mankind. He told me, I mightjndgi
of the happiness of this state by this one thing; viz.
that this was the state of life which all other peoplt
envied; that kings have frequentlylamented the mi-f
Cerable consequences of being born to great things,
and wished they had been placed in the middle or
the two extremes, between the mean and the great;
that the wise man gave his testimony to this, as thr
just standard of true felicity, when he prayed to hart -
neither poverty nor riches.

I-Ie bade me observe it, and I should always find.
that the calamities of life were shared among the up
per and lower part- of mankind; but that the middli
station had the fewest disasters, and was not ex-
posed to so many vicissitudes as the higher or lowu
part of mankind 5 nay, they were not subjected to st
many distempers and uneasinesses, either of body or
mind, as those were, who, by vicious living, luxury,
and extravagancies on one hand, or by hard labour,
want of necessaries, and mean or insufficient diet,
on the other hand,bring distempers upon themselves
by the natural consequences of their way of living 5
that the middle station of life was calculated for all
kind of virtues, and all kind of enjoyments; that
peace and plenty were the handmaids of a middle
fortune; that temperance, moderation, quietness,

. health, society, all agreeable diversions, and all de-
' sirable pleasures, were the blessings attending the

middle station of life; that this way men went si-
lently and smoothly through the world, and comfort-
ably out of it; not embarrassed with the labours of
the hands, or of the head; not sold to a life of
slavery for daily bread, or harassed with perplexed
circumstances, which rob'the soul of peace, and the
body of rest; nor enraged with the passion of envy,
or the secret burning lust of ambition for great
things; but in easy circumstances, sliding gently
through the world, and sensibly tasting the sweets
of living, without the bitter; feeling that they are
happy, and learning by every day's "experience to
know it more sensibly.

After this, he pressed me earnestly, and in the
most affectionate manner, not to play the young
man, nor to precipitate myself into miseries, which
nature, and the station of life I was born in, seemed
to have provided against; that I was under no ne-

' cessity of seeking my bread; that he would do well

for me, and endeavour to enter me fairly into the

- .station of life which he had been just recommending

to me; and that if I was not very easy and happy
in the world, it must be my mere fate, or fault,
that must hinder it; and that he should have no-
thing to answer for, having thus discharged his duty
in warningme against measures which he knew
would be' to my hurt. In a word, that as he would
do vex y kindthings for me, if I would stay and settle
at home as he directed; so he would not have so
much hand in my misfortunes, as to give me any
encouragement to go away: and to close all, he told '-
me, I had my elder brother for an example, to whom '
he had used the same earnest persuasions to keep I
him from going into the Low Country Wars; butl
could not prevail, his young desires prompting him
to run into the army, where he was killed: and
though he said he would not cease to pray for me,
yet he would venture to say to me, that if I did
take this foolish step, God would not bless me; and
I would have leisure hereafter to reflect upon hav-
ing neglected his counsel, when there might be none
to assist in my recovery.

I observed in this last part of his discourse, which
was truly prOphclic,tllouglt I suppose my father did
not know it to be so himself; I say, I observed the
tears run down his face very plentifully, especially
when he spoke of my brother who was killed: and
that when he spoke of. my having leisure to repent,
and none to assist me, he was so moved, that he
broke oi? the discourse, and told me, his heart was
so full, he could say no more to me.

I was sincerely affected with this discourse, as. in-.
deed who could be otherwise? And I resolved not '
to think of going abroad any more, but to settle at
home according to my father's desire. But, alas! a
few days were it all ofi'; and, in short, to prevent
any of my father's farther importunities, in a few.
weeks after I resolved to run quite away from him.
l-lowever,I did notiact so hastily neither, as the first'
heat of my resolution prompted; but I took my mo-
ther at a time when I thought her alittle pleasanter
than ordinary, and told her, that my thoughts were
so entirely bent upon seeing the world, that I should
never settle to any thing with resolution enough to'
go through with it; and my father had better give'
me his consent, than force me to go without it:
that I was now eighteen years old, which was too.

hey: that. I was sure, if I did, I should never serve
out my time, but I should certainly run away from.
my master before my time was out, and go to sea:
and if she would speak to my father to letme go one
voyage abroad, if llcame home again, and did not
like it, I would go no more, and 1 would promise, by
a double diligence, to recover the time I had lost.
This put my mother into agreat passion. She told
me, she knew it would be to no purpose to Speak to
my father upon any such subject; that he know too
well what was my interest, to give his consent to any
thing so much for my hurt; and that she wondered
how I could think of any such thing, after the dis-
course I had had with my father, and such kind and
tender expressions, as she knew my father had used
to me; and that. in short, if I would ruin myself,
there was no help for me; but I might depend I
should never have their consent to it: that, for her
part, she would not have so much hand in my de-
struction; and I should never have it to say, that
my mother was willing, when my Father was not.
Though my mother refused to move it to my fa-
ther, yet I heard afterwards that she reported all the
discourSe to him; and that my father, after shewing
' a great concern at it, said to her, with a sigh, ' That
the boy might be happy, if he would stay at home;
but if he goes abroad, he will be the most miserable
wretch that ever was born: I can give no consent
to it.' .
It was not till almost a year after this that I broke
loose, though in the mean time I continued obsti-
.nately (leaf to all proposals of settling to business,
and frequently expostulating with my father and
mother about their being so positively determined
:against what they knew my inclinations prompted
.me to. But being one day at Hull, whither I went
scasnally, and without. any purpose of making an
elopement that time; but, 1 say, being there, and one
of my companions being going by sea to London, in
his father's ship, and prompting me to go with them.
\

with the common allurement of a seafaring man,

that it should cost me nothing for my passage, I con-

sulted neither father nor mother any more, nor so.
much as sent them word of it: but leaving them to g
hear of it, as they might, without asking God's bless--
ing, or my father's, without any consideration of cir-

cumstances or consequences, and in an ill hour, God

knows, on the first of September, 1551, I went on

board a ship bound for London. Never any young

adventurer's misfortunes, I believe, began sooner, or

continued longer, than mine. The ship was no

sooner got out of the Number, but the wind began

to blow, and the sea to rise in a most frightful mangi
ner; and, as I had never been at sea before, I was

most inexpressihly sick in body, and terrified in

mind. I began now seriously to reflect upon whatI

had done, and how justly I was overtaken by the

judgment or Ileaven, for my wicked leaving my

fathers house, and abandoning my duty. All the

good counsel of my parents, my father' s tears, and

my mother's entreaties. came now fresh into my-
mind; and my conscience, which was not yet come '
to the pitch of hardness to which it has been since,
reproached me with the contempt of advice, and the
breach of my duty to God and my father.

All this while the storm increased, and the sea?
went very high, though nothing like what 1 have seen
many times since; no, nor what 1 saw a few days' '
after. But it was enough to affect me then, who was
but a young sailor, and had never known any thing
of the matter. I eXpected every wave would have
swallowed us up, and that every time the ship fell
down, as I thought it (lid,in the trough or hollow of '
the sea, we should never rise more. In this agony'
of mind, I made many vows and resolutions, that if
it would please God to spare my life in this one
voyage, if ever I got once my foot upon dry land
again, I would go directly home to my father, and
never set it into a ship again while I lived: that I
would take his advice, and never run myself into
such miseries as these any more. Now I saw plain-
ly the goodness of his observations about the middle
station of life, how easy, how comfortable, he had
lived all his days, and never had been exposed to
tempests at sea, or troubles on shore: and, in short,
I resolved that I would, like a true repenting prodi-
gal, go home to my father.

These wise and sober thoughts continued all the
while the storm continued, and indeed some time
after; but the next day the wind was abated, and the
sea calmer, and I began to be a little inured to it.
However, I was very grave for all that day, being
also a little sea-sick still; but towards night the
weather cleared up, the wind was quite over, and a
charming fine evening followed; the sun went down
perfectly clear, and rose so the next morning; and
having little or no wind, and a smooth sea, the sun
shining upon it, the sight was, as I thought, the most
delightful that ever I saw.

I had slept well in the night, and was now no
more sea-sick, but very cheerful; looking with won.
dcr upon the see, that was so rough and terrible the
day before, and could be so calm and so pleasant in
so little a time after. And now, lest my good reso-
lutions should continue, my companion, who had in.
deed enticed me away, comes to me: ' Well, Bob,'
says he, clapping me upon the shoulder, 'how do you
do after it? I warrant you were PSrightcd, wa'n't you,
last night, when it blew but a capfull of wind?' ' A
capfull d'you call it?' said 1', ' 'twasaterriblc storm.'
' A storm, you fool you!' replies he: ' do you call
that a storm? Why it was nothing at all; give us
but a good ship and sea-room, and we think nothing
of such a squall of wind as that: but, you're but a
fresh-water sailor, Boh. Come, let us make a bowl
of punch,and we'll forget all that. D'yOu see what
charming weather 'tis now?' To make short this
sad part of my story, we went the way of all sailors :
the punch was made, and I was made half drunk
with it, and in that one night's wickedness I drowned
all my repentance, all my reflections upon my past
conduct, and all my resolutions for the future. In a
word, as the sea was returned to its smoothness of
surface, and settled calmness, by the abatement of
that storm, so the hurry of my thoughts being over,
my fears and apprehensions of being swallowed up
by sea being forgotten, and the current of my for-
mer deSires returned, I entirely forgot the vows
and promises that I made in my distress. I found
indeed some intervals of reflection, and the serious
thoughts did, as it were, endeavour to return again
sometimes; but i shook them off, and roused myself
from them, as it were from a distemper; and, apply-
ing myself to drinking and company, soon mastered
the return ofthose fits (for so I called them); and I
had, in five or six days, got as complete a victory
over conscience, as any young fellow that resolved
not to be troubled with it could desire. But [ was
to have anorher trial for it still; and Providence, as
in such cases generally it does, resolved to leave me
entirely without excuse: for, if I would not take
this for a deliveranc, the next was to be such a one,
as the worst and most hardened wretch among'us
would confess both the danger and the mercy.

The sixth day of our being at sea, we came into
Yarmouth Roads: the wind having been contrary,
and the weather calm, we had made but little way
since the storm. liere we were obliged to come to
an anchor: and here we lay, the wind continuing
contrary, viz. at south-west, for seven or eight days:
during which time a great many ships from New.
castle came into the same roads, as the common
harbour where the ships might wait for a wind for
the river.

We had not, however, rid here so long, but we
should have tidcd it up the. river, but that. the wind
blew too fresh; and, after we had lain four or five
days, blew very hard. I-Ibwever, the roads being
reckoned as good as a harbour, the anchorage
good, and our ground-tackle very strong, our men
were unconcerned, and not in the least apprehensive
of danger,but spent the time in rest and mirth, after
the manner of the sea: but the eighth day in the
morning the wind increased, and we had all hands
at work to strike our top-masts, and make every
thing snug and close, that the ship might ride as
easy as possible. By noon, the sea went very high
indeed, and our ship rid fore-castle in,shipped seve-
ral seas, and we thought once or twice our anchor
had comehome ; upon which our master ordered out
the sheet-anchor, so that we rode with two anchors
ahead, and the cables veered out to the better end.
By this time it blew a terrible storm indeed ; and
now I began to see terror and amazement in the faces
even of the seamen themselves. The master, though
vigilant in the business of preserving the ship,yet, as
he went in and out of his cabin by me, I could hear
him, softly to himself, say several times, ' Lord
be merciful to us! We shall be all lost: we shall be all
undone!' and the like. During these lirst hurries I
was stupid, lying still in my cabin, which was in the '
steerage, and cannot describe my temper. I could
ill resume the first penitence, which i had so appap
rently trampled upon, and hardened myself against.
I thought the bitterness of death had been past; and
that this would be nothing too, like the first. But
when the master himself came by me', as I said just
now, and said we should be all lost, 1 was dreadfully
frighted. I got up out of my cabin, and looked out;
but such a dismal sight.I never saw; the sea went
mountains high, and broke upon us every three or
four minutes. When I could look about, I could see
nothing but distress round- us. Two ships that rid
near us, we found had cut their masts by the board,
being deep loaden; and our men cried out, that a.
ship, which rid about a mile ahead of us, was foun-
dered. Two more ships, being driven from their
anchors, were run out of the roads to sea, at all ad-
ventures, and that not with a mast standing. The
light ships fared the best, as not so much labouring
B 2
in the sea; but two or three of them drove, and
came close by us, running sunny, with only their
sprit-sail out, before the wind.

Towards the evening, the mate and boatswain
begged the master of our ship to let them cut away
the foreomast, which he was very unwilling to do;
but the boatswain protesting to him, that if 'he did
not, the ship would founder, he consented: and
when they had cut away the fore-mast, the main-
mast stood so loose, and shook the ship so much,
they were obliged to cuther away also, and make a
clear deck. .

Any one may judge what a condition I must be
in at all this, who was but a young sailor, and who
had been in such a fright before at but a little. But,
if 1 can express at this distance the thoughts I had
about me at that time, I was in tenfold more horror
of mind upon account of my former convictions,
. and the having returned from them to the resolu-
tions I had wickedly taken at first, than I was at
death itself; and these, added to the terror of the
storm, put me into such a condition, that I can by
no words describe it. But the worst was not come
yet: the storm continued with such fury, that the
seamen themselves acknowledged they had never
seen a worse. We had a good ship, but she was
deep loaden, and wallowed in the sea, that the sea-
men every now and then cried out, she would
founder. It was my advantage in one respect, that
I did not know what they meant by founder, till I
inquired. However, the storm was so violent, that.
I saw what is not often seen, the master; the boat-
swain, and some others more sensible than the rest,
at their prayers, and expecting every moment when
the ship would go to the bottom. in the middle of
the night, and under all the rest of our distresses,
one of the men that had been down on purpose to
See, cried out we had sprunk a leak; another said,
there was four feet water in the hold. Then all

bands were called to the pump. At that very word
my heart, as I thought, died within me; and I fell
backwards upon the side of the bed where I sat,
into the cabin. However, the men roused me, and
told me, that I that was able to do nothing before,
was as well able to pump as another: at which I
stirred up, and went to the pump, and worked very
heartily. While this was doing. the master, seeing.
some light colliers, who, not able to ride out the
storm, were obliged to slip and run away to sea,
and would come. near us, ordered to fire a gun as
a signal of distress. I, who knew nothing what that
meant, was so surprised, that I thought the ship
had broke, or some dreadful thing happened. In a.
word, I was so surprised, that I fell down in a.
swoon. As this was a time when every body had
his own life to think of,uobody minded me, or what
was become of me: but another man stepped up to
the pump, and, thrusting me aside with his foot. let
me lie, thinking I had been dead; and it was a.
great while before I came to myself.

We worked on, but_ the water increasing in the
hold, it was apparent that the ship would founder;
and though the storm began to abate a little, yet
as it was not possible she could swim till we might
run into any port, so the master continued firing
guns for help; and a light ship, who had rid it out
justahead of us, ventured a boat out to help us."
It was with the utmost hazard the boat came near
us; but it was impossible for us to get on board, or
for the boat to lie near the ship-side, till at last the
men rowing very heartily, and venturing their lives
to save ours, our men cast them a rope over the
stern with a buoy to it, and then veered it out a
great length, which they, after much labour and.
hazard, took hold of ; and, we hauled them close
under our stern, and got all into their boat. It was
to no purpose for them or us, after we were in the
boat, to think of reaching to their own ship; so all
agreed to let her drive, and only to pull her in to-
wards shore as much as we could; and our master
promised them, that if the boat was stnved upon
shore, he would make it good to their master. So
partly rowing, and partly driving, our boat went

away to the northward, sloping towards the shore,
almost as far as Wintertonness.

We were not much more than a quarter of an hour
out of our ship, but we saw her sink: and then I
understood, for the first time, what was meant by a.
ship foundering in the sea. I must acknowledge I
had hardly eyes to look up. when the seamen told
me she was sinking; for, from that moment, they
rather put me into the boat, than that I might be
said to go in; my heart was. as it were, dead within
me, partly with fright, partly with horror of mind,
and the thoughts of what was yet before me.

While we were in this condition, the men yet la-
bouring at the oar to bring the boat near the shore,
we could see (when our boat mounting the waves,
we were able to see the shore) a great many people
running along the strand to assist us when We should
come near. But we made but slow way towards the
shore; nor were we able to reach the shore, till, being
past the light-house at Winterton, the shore falls off
to the westward towards Cromer; and so the land
broke off a little the violence of the wind. ' Here we
got in; and, though not without much difliculty, got
all safe on shore; and walked afterwards on fact to
Yarmouth,where, as unfortunate men, we were used
with great humanity. as well by the magistrates of
the town, who assigned us good quarters,as by par-
ticular merchants and owners of ships; and had
money given us sufficient to carry us either to Lon.
don, or back to Hull, as we thought litu

Had I now had the sense to have gone back to
Hull, and have gone home, I had been happy, and
my father, an emblem of our blessed Saviour's pa~
rable, had even killed the fatted calf for me; for,
hearing the ship I went away in was cast away in
Yarmouth roads, it was a great while before he had
any assurances that l was not drowned.
But my ill fate pushed me on now with an obsti- '
nacy that nothing could resist; and though I had
several times loud calls from my reason, and my
more composed judgment, to go home, yet I had no
power to do it. 1 know not what to call this; nor
, will I urge, that it is a secret over-ruling decree,
that hurries us on to be the instruments of our'own
destruction, even though it be before us, and that
we push upon it with our eyes open. Certainly,
nothing but some such decreed unavoidable misery
attending, and which it was impossible for me to
escape, could have pushed me forward against the
calm reasonings and persuasions of my most retired
thoughts, and against two such visible instructions
as I had met with in my first attempt.

My comrade, Who had helped to harden the before;
and who was the master's son, was now less forward
than I. The first time he spoke to me after we were
at Yarmouth,'which was not till two or three days,
for we were separated in the town to several quar-
ters; I say, the first time he saw me, it appeared
his tone was altered; and, looking very melancholy,
and shaking his hEad, asked me how I did: and
telling his father who I was, and how I had come'
this voyage only for a trial, in order to go farther
abroad; his father turning to me with a Very grave
and concerned tone, ' Young man,' says he, ' you
ought never to go to sea any more; you ought to
take this for a plain and visible token, that you are
not to be a seafaring man.' ' Why, sir,' said I, ' will
you go to sea no more 9' ' That is another case,' said
he; ' it is my calling, and therefore my duty; but,
as you made this. voyage for a trial, you see what
a taste Heaven has given you of what you are to
expect, if you persist: perhaps all this has befallen
us on your account, like Jonah in the ship of Tar.
shish. Pray,' continues he, ' what are you? and on
what account did you go to sea?' Upon that I told
him some of my story; at the end of which he burst
out with a strange kind of passion, ' What had I
doue.' says he, ' that such an unhappy wretch should
come into my ship? I would not set my foot in the
Same ship with thee again for a thousand pounds 1'
This indeed was, as I said,an excursion of his spirits,
which were yet agitated by the sense of his loss, and
was further than he could have authority to go.
However, he afterwards talked very gravely to me,
exhorting me to go back to my father, and not tempt
Providence to my ruin; told me I might see a visible
hand of Heaven against me: ' And, young man,'said
he, ' depend upon it, if you do not go back, wherever
you go, you will meet with nothing butdisasters and
disappointments, till your father's words are fulfilled
upon you.'

We parted soon after; for I made him little an-
swer, and I saw him no more: which way he went,
I knownot. As for me, having some money in my
pocket, I travelled to London by land; and there,
as well as 0n theroad, had many struggles with my.
self, what course of life I should take, and whether
I should go home, or go to sea.

.As to going home, shame opposed the best mo
tions that offered to my thoughts; and itimmcdiatc-
ly occurred to me how Ishould he laughed at among
the neighbours, and should be ashamed to see, not
my father and mother only, but even every body else.
From whence I have since often observed how in-
congruous and irrational the common temper of
mankind is, especially of youth, to that reason that
ought to guide them in such cases; viz. that they
are not ashamed to sin, and yet are ashamed to
repent; not ashamed of the action, for which they
ought justly to be esteemed fools; but are ashamed
of the returning, which only can make them esteem-
ed wise men.

.ln this state of life, however, Iremained some
time, uncertain what measures to take, and what
course of life to lead. An irresistible reluctance
continued to going home; and, as I stayed awhile,
the remembrance of the distress I had been in wore
off: and as that abated, the little motion I had in
my desires to a return were off with it, till at last

I quite laid aside the thoughts of it, and looked out

for a voyage.

That evil influence which carried me first away
frOm my father's house, which hurried me into the
wild and indigested notion of raising my fortune,
and that impressed those conceits so forcibly upon
me, as to make me deal" to all good advice, and to
the entreaties, and even the commands, of my father:
1 say, the same influence, whatever it was, presented
the most unfortunate of all'enterprises to my view;
and 1 went on board a vessel bound to the coast of
Africa, or, as our sailors vulgarly call it, a voyage to
Guinea.

It was my great misfortune, that, in all these ad-
ventures,l did not ship myself as a sailor; whereby,
though I might indeed have worked a little harder
than ordinary, yet at the same time I had learned
the duty and office of a fore-mastman; and in time
might have qualified myself for a mate or lieutenant,
if not for a master. But as it was always my fate
to choose for the worse, so 1 did here; for, having
money in my pocket, and good clothes on my back,
I would always go on board in the habit ofa gen.
tleman: and so 1 neither had any business in the
ship, nor learned to' do any. '

It was my lot'first of all to fall into pretty good
company in London, which does not always happen
to such loose and unguided young follows as I then
was; the devil, generally, not omitting to lay some
snare for them very early: but it was not so with
me. I first fell acquainted with the master of a
ship who had been on the coast of Guinea, and who,
having had very good success there, was resolved
to go again. This captain. taking a fancy to my
conversation, which was not disagreeable at that
time, hearing me say I had a mind to see the world,
told me, if I would go the voyage with him, I should
be at no expense, Ishould be his messmate, and his

16 ROBINSON CRUSOE.

companion; and if I could carry any thing with me,
I should have all the advantage of it that the trade
would admit; and perhaps I might meet with some
encouragement.

I embraced the offer, and, entering into a strict
friendship with this captain, who was an honest
plain-dealing man, went the voyage with him; and
carried a small adventure with me, which, by the
disinterested honesty of my friend the captain, I
increased very considerably; for I carried about 405.
in such toys and trifles as the captain directed me
to buy. This 401. 1 had mustered together by the '
assistance of some of my relations whom I corre- ,
sponded with, and who, I believe, got my father. or *
at least my mother, to contribute so much as that
to my first adventure. ,

This was the only voyage which I may say was .
successful in all my adventures, and which I owe to '-
the integrity and honesty of my friend the captain; -
under whom I also got a competent knowledge of the
mathematics, and the. rules of navigation; learned
how to keep an account of the ship's course, take an
ohservation, and, in short,to understand some things
that were needful to be understood by a sailor: for, '
as he took delight to introduce me, I took delight to i
learn; and, in a word, this voyage made me both ;
a. sailor and a merchant: for I brought home five '
pounds nine ounces ol' gold-dust for my adventure,
which yielded me in London, at my return, almost
300i. ; and this filled me with those aspiring thoughts
which have since so completed my ruin.

Yet, even in this voyage, I had my misfortunes
too; particularly that I was continually sick, being
thrown into a violent calenture by the excessive
heat of the climate,our principal trading being upon
the coast, from the latitude of 15 degrees N. even
to the Line itself.

I was now set up for a Guinea trader; and my
friend, to my great misfortune, dying soon after his
a) rival, I resolved to go the same voyage again. and
I embarked in the same vessel with one who was his
mate in the former voyage, and had now got the
command of the. ship. This was the unhappiest
voyage that ever man made; for though I did not
carry quite 1(P0l. of my new-gained wealth, so that
I had 2005. left. and which I lodged with my friend's
widow, who was very just to me, yet I fell'into
terrible misfortunes in this voyage: and the first
was this; viz. our ship, making her course towards
the Canary islands, or rather between those islands
and the African shore, was surprised in the gray of
the morning by a Moorish lover of Sallee, who gave
chase to us with all the sail she cauld make. We
crowded also as much canvass as our yards would
spread, or our masts carry, to have. got clear; but,
finding the pirate gained upon us, and would cer-
tainly come up with us in a Few hours, we prepared
to fight; our ship having twelve guns, and the
rogue eighteen. About three in the afternoon he
came up with us, and bringing to, by mistake,just
athwart our quarter, instead of athwart our stern, as
he intended, we brought eight of our guns to bear
on that side, and poured in a broadside upon him,
which made him sheer oll' again, after returning our
fire, and pouring in also his small shot from near two
hundred men which he had on board. However, we
had not a man touched. all our men keeping close.
I-Ic prepared to attack us again, and we to defend
ourselves; but, laying "us on board the next time
upon our other quarter, he entered ninety men upon
our decks, who immediately fell to cutting and hack-
ing the decks and rigging. We plied them with small
shot, half-pikes, powder-chests, and such like, and
cleared our decks of them twice. However, to cut
short this melancholy part of our story, our ship
being disabled, and three of our men killed, and
eight wounded, we were obliged to yield; and were
' carried all prisoners into Sallec, a port belonging to
the Moors. -

The usage I had there was not so dreadful as at
first I apprehended; nor was I carried up the coun-
try, to the emperor's court, as the rest of our men
were, but was kept by the captain of the rover as his
proper prize, and made his slave, being young and
nimble, and fit for his business. At this surprising
change of my circumstances, from a merchant to a
miserable slave, I was perfectly overwhelmed; and
now I looked back upon my father's prophetic dis-
course to me, that I should be miserable, and have
none to relieve me, which I thought was now so
effectually brought to pass, that I could not be
worse; that now the hand of Heaven had overtaken
me, and I was undone without redemption. But,
alas! this was but a-taste of the misery I was to
go through, as will appear in the sequel of this
story.

As my new patron or master had taken me home
to his house, so I was in hopes that he would take
me with him when he went to sea again, believing
that it would be some time or other his fate to be
taken by a Spanish or Portugal man of war; and
that then 1 should be set at liberty. But this hope
of mine was soon taken away; for when he went to
sea, he left me on shore to look after his little g-ar-
den, and do the common drudgery of slaves about
his house; and when he came home again from his
cruise, he ordered me to lie in the cabin, to look
after the ship.

Here I meditated nothing but 'my escape, and
what method I might take to effect it; but found no
way that had the least probability in it. Nothing
presented to make the supposition of it rational, for
I had nobody to communicate it to that would em-

' bark with me, no fellow-slave, no Englishman, Irish-
man, or Scotsman there, but myself; so that for
two years, though I often pleased myself with the
imagination, yet I neVer had the least encouraging
prospect of putting it in practice.

After about two years, an odd circumstance pre.
sented itself, which put the old thought of making
some attempt for my liberty again in my head. M y
patron lying at home longer than usual,without fit-
ting out his ship, which, as I heard, was for want of
money, he used,,constantly once or twice a week,
sometimes oftener, if the weather was fair, to take
the ship's pinnace, and go out into the road a fishing;
and as he always took me and a young Maresco with
him to row the boat, we made him very merry. and
1 proved very dextcrous in catching fish 5 inasmuch
that sometimes he would send me with a Moor,one
of his kinsmen, and the youth the Maresco, as they
called him, to catch a dish of fish for him.

It happened one. time, that going a fishing with
him in a calm morning, a fog rose so thick, that
though we were not half a league from the shore, we
lostsightof it; and, rowing we knew not whither, or
which way, we laboured all day, and all the next
night} and when the morning came, we found we
had pulled off to sea, instead of pulling in for the
shore, and that we were at least two leagues from
the land. However, we got well in again. though
with a great deal of labour, and some danger; for
the wind began to blow pretty fresh in the morning:
but particularly we were all very hungry. '

But our patron, warned by this disaster, resolved
to take more care of himself for the future; and, hav-
ing lying by him the long-boat of our English ship
which he had taken, he resolved he would not go a
fishing any more without a compass, and some pro-
vision: so he ordered the carpenter of his ship, who .
was also an English slave, to build a little state-room
or cabin in the middle of the long.boat, like that of
a barge, with a place to stand behind it to'steer, and
haul home the main-sheet; and room before for a
hand or two to stand and work the sails. She sailed
with what we call ashoulder-ofimutton-sail ; and the
boom jibbed over the top of the cabin,which lay very
snug and low, and had in it room for him to lie, with
a slave or two,and a table to eat on, with some small
lockers to put in some bottles of such liquor as hec - - -'o.xu'--q--v- ---' -

thought lit to drink; particularly his in ead rice, and
coffee.

We were frequently out with this boat a fishing;
and as I was most dexterous to catch fish for him,
he never went without me. It happened one day,
that he had appointed to go out in this boat, either
for pleasure or for fish, with two or three Moors of
some distinction, and for whom he had provided ex-
traordinarily, and had therefore sent on board the
boat over night a larger store of provisions than
usual; and had ordered me to get ready three fusils
with powder and shot, which were on board his ship;
for that they designed some sport of fowling as well
as fishing.

I got all things ready, as he had directed; and
waited the next morning with the boat washed clean,
her ancient and pendants out, and every thing to
accommodate his guests; when, by and by, my pa-
tron came on board alone, and told me his guests
had put off going, upon some business that fell out,
and ordered me, with the man and boy. as usual, to
go out with the boat, and catch them some fish, for
that his friends were to sup at his house. lie com-
manded me tea, that as soon as I had got some fish,
I should bring it home to his house. All which I
prepared to do.

This moment my former notions of deliverance
darted into my thoughts, for now I found I was like
to have a little ship at my command; and my master
being gone,l prepared to furnish myself, not for fish-
ing business, but for a voyage: though I knew not,
neither did I so much as consider, whither [ would
steer; for any where to get out of that place was
my way.

My first contrivance was to make a pretence to
speak to this Moor, to get something for our subsist-
ence on board; for I told him we must not presume
to eat of our patron's bread. He said, that was true;
so he brought a large basket of rusk or biscuit, of
their kind. and three jars with fresh water, into theROBINSON cavsoe. 21

, boat. I knew where my patron's case- of bottles
stood,which,it was evident by the make, were taken
out of some English prize, and I conveyed them into
the boat, while the Moor was on shore, as if they
had been there before for our master. 1 conveyed
also a great lump of bees-wax into the boat, which
weighed about half a hundred weight. with a par-
cel of twine or thread, a hatchet, a saw, and a.
hammer, all which were of great use to us after-
wards: especially the wax to make candles. Ano-
ther trick I tried upon him, which he innocently
came into also. His name was Ismael, whom they
called Muley, or Molcy; so I called to him: ' Moley,'
said I, ' our patron's guns are all on board the boat:
can you not get a little powder and shot? It may
be we may kill some alcamies (a fowl like our cur-
lieus) for ourselves; for I know he keeps the gunner's
stores in the ship.' ' Yes,' says he, ' I'll bring some.'
Accordingly he brought a great leather pouch, which
held about a pound and a half of powder, or rather
more; and another with shot. that had five or six
pounds,with some bullets, and put all into the boat.
At the same time I had found some powder of my
master's in the great cabin, with which I filled one
of the large bottles in the case, which was almost
empty, pouring what was in it'into another: and thus
furnished with every thing needt'ul', we sailed out of
.the port to fish. The castle, which is at the entrance
of the port, knew who we were, and took no notice
of us; and we were not above a mile out of the port,
before we hauled in our sail, and sat us down to fish.
The wind blew from the N .N.E. which was con-
trary to my desire; for had it blown southerly, I had
been sure to have made the coast of Spain, and at
least reached to the bay of Cadiz; but my resolu-
tions were, blow which way it would, I would be
gone from that horrid place where I was, and leave
the rest to fate.

After we had fished some time, and catched nothing
(for when I had fish on my book, I would not pull
them up, that he might not see them), I said to the
Moor, ' This will not do: our master will not be
thus served. We must stand farther off.' I-Ie,think-
ing no harm, agreed; and being in the head of the I
beat, set the sails, and, as I had the helm, I run the
boat out nearaleague farther, and then brought her

'to, as if 1 would fish; when,giving the boy the helm, '

I stepped forward to where the Moor was, and making
as if I stooped for something behind him, 1 took him
by surprise with my arm under his twist, and tossed
him clear overboard into the sea. He rose immedi- 3
ately, for he swam like a cork, and called to me,

begged to be taken in, told me he would go all over
the world with me. He swam so strong'after the
boat, that he would have reached me very quickly,~
there being but little wind; upon which I stepped '
into-the cabin, and, fetching one of the fowling- 1

pieces, I presented it at him, and told .him I had '

done him no hurt, and, if he would be quiet, I would '
do him none: ' But,' said I,' you swim well enough '
to reach the shore, and the sea is calm ; make the best '
of your way to shore, and I will do you no harm, '
but,if you come near the boat, l'll shoot you through '
the head, for I am resolved to have my liberty.' So :
he turned himself about, and swam for the shore, ;
and I make no doubt but he reached it with ease, E
for he was an excellent swimmer. '.
I could have been content to have taken this Moor
with me, and have drowned the boy, but there was
no venturing to trust him. When he was gone, I
turned to the boy, whom they called Xury, and said
to him, ' Xury,if you will be faithful to me, I'll make
you a great man; but if you will not stroke your 3
face to be true to me,' that is, swear by Mahomet, '
and his father's beard, ' I must throw you into the sea
too.' The boy smiled in my face, and spoke so in-
nocently, that I could not mistrust him; and swore '
to be faithful to me, and go all over the world with
me.

While I was in view of the Moor that was s'wim- '
ming, I stood out directly to sea with the boat, rather
stretching to windward, that they might think me
gone towards the Strait's mouth,(as indeed any one
that had been in their wits must have been sup-
posed to do); for who would have supposed we were
sailed on to the southward, to the truly Barbarian
coast, where whole nations of Negroes were sure to
surround us with their canoes,and destroy us; where
we could never once go on snore, but'we should be
devoured by savage beasts, or more merciless savages
of human kind? '

But, as soon as it grew dusk in the evening, I
changed my course, and steered directly south and
by east, bending my course a little towards the east,
that I might keep in with the shore; and, having a
fair fresh gale of wind, and a smooth quiet sea, I
made such sail. that, I believe, by the next day at
three o'clock in the afternoon, when I first made the
land, I could not be less than 150 miles south of
Sallee, quite beyond the Emperor of Morocco's do-
minions, or indeed of any other king thereabouts,
for we saw no people.

Yet such was the fright I had taken at the Moors,
and the dreadful apprehensions I had of falling into
their hands, that! would not stop, or go on shore, or
come to an anchor, the wind continuing fair, till I
had sailed in that manner five days; and then the
wind shifting to the southward, I concluded also,
that if any of our vessels were in chase of me, they
also would now give over; so I ventured to make to
the coast. and came to an anchor in the mouth of a
little river, I knew not what or where, neither what
latitude, what country, what nation, or what river.
I neither saw nor desired to see any. people: the prin-
cipal thing I wanted was fresh water. We came into
this creek in the evening. resolving to swim on shore
as soon as it was dark, and discover the country; but
as soon as it was quite dark, we heard such dreadful
noises of the barking, roaring, and howling of wild
creatures, of we knew not what kinds, that the poor -
boy was ready to die with fear, and begged of me not 3.

-to go on shore till day. ' Well, Xury,' said I, ' then
I won't; but it may be we may see men by day, who
will be as bad to us as those lions.' ' Then we may
give them the shoot gun,' says Xury, laughing, ' make

them run way.' Such English Xury spoke, by con- 9.

versing among us slaves. However, I was glad to
see the boy so cheerful, and I gave him a dram (out

of our patron'Srcase of.bottles) to cheer him up. ,
After all, Xury's advice was good; and I took it: we .

dropped our little anchor, and lay still all? night; I
say still, for we slept none; for in two or three hours
we saw vast great creatures, we knew not what to
call them, of many sorts, come down to the sea-
shore, and run into the water, wallowing and wash-
ing themselves for the pleasure of cooling them-
selves: aud they made such hideous howlings and
yellings, that I never indeed heard the like.

Xury was dreadfully frighted, and indeed so \ 'as I
too ; but we were both werse frightcd when we heard
one of the mighty creatures come swimming towards
our boat: we could not see him, but we might hear
him by his blowing to be a monstrous huge and fu-
rious beast. Xury said it was a lion, and that it
might be for anght I know. Poor Xury cried out to
me to weigh the anchor, and row away. ' No,' says I,
'Xury,we can slip our cable with a buoy to it, and go
to sea; they cannot follow us far.' I had no sooner
said so,'but l perceived the creature (whatever it
was) within two oars length, whichxsomething sur-
prised me; however, I immediately, stepped to the
cabin-door, and taking up my gun, fired at him,
upon which he immediately turned about, and swam
towards the shore again. >>

But it was not possible to describe the horrible

noises, and hideous cries andhowlings that were a

raised, as well upon the edge of. the shore as higher
within the country, upon the. noise or report of a

gun; a thing, I have some reason to believe, those is
creatures had never heard before. ' This convinced :
me that there was no going on shore for us in the
night. upon that coast, and how to venture on shore
in the day,.was another question too ; for, to have

? fallen into the hands of any of the savages, had been

as bad as to have fallen into the, paws of lions and

,. tigers; at least we were equally apprehensive, of the

danger of it. , .

Be that as it would, we were obliged to go. on
shore somewhere or other for water, for we. had not
a pint left in the boat: when or where to get to it,

. was the point. Xury said if I would let him go on
- shore with one of the jars, he. would find if there
, was any water, and bring some to me. I asked him
' why he would go, why I should not go, and he stay
" inthe boat. The boy answered with so much affecg

tion that made me love him ever after. Says he, ' If

- . wild mans come, they eat me; you -go wey.' ' Well,

' Xury,' said I, ' we will both go; and if the wild
1 mans come, we will kill them: they shall eat nei-

ther of us.' So I gave Xury a piece of rusk-bread

'. to eat, and a dram out of our patron's case of bot-
.. tles, which'I mentioned before, and we hauled the
- boat in as near the shore as we thought was proper,
j. and waded on shore, carrying nothing but our arms,
and two jars for water.

1 did not care to go out of sight of the boat,

fearing the coming of canoes with savages down

the river: but the boy seeing a low place, about:

>> j a mile up the country, rambled to it, 'and by and
. by I saw him come running towards me. I thought:
"3,110, was pursued by some savage, or frighted with '
.some wild beast, and I ran forward towards him '-
to help him; but when I came nearer to him,
' I saw something hanging over his shoulders, which
rwas a creature that he had shot, like a hare, but
1 dilferent in colour, and longer legs. However, we
were very glad of it, and it was very good meat;
:gbut the great joy that poor Xury came with, was
;to tell me he had found good water, and seen no

wild mans. .
C- r'

26 ROBINSON CRUSOE.

But we found afterwards that we need not take
such pains for water, for a little higher up the creek
where we were, we found the water fresh when the
tide was out, which flows but a little way up: so we
filled ourjars,and feasted on the hare we had killed,
and prepared to go on our way, having seen 110;
footsteps of any human creature in that part of the '
country.

As 1 had been one voyage to this coast before. I
knew very well that the islands of the Canaries, and 5
the Cape de Verd islands also, lay not far off from
the coast. But as I had no instruments to take an j
observation to know what latitude we were in, and 5
did not exactly know,or atlc-ast not remember, what
latitude they were in, I knew not where to look for 3
them, or when to stand off to sea towards them,'
otherwise 1 might now easily have found some off
these islands. But my hope was, that if I Istood'
along this coast till I came to that part, where the
English traded, i should find some of their vessvls .
upon'their usual design of tradeythat would relieve
and take us in.

By the best of my calculation, that place where I;
now was must he that country which, lying betwenni
the emperor of Morocco's dominions and the Ne-j
Ogroes, lies waste and uninhabited, except by wild.
beasts, the Negroes having abandoned it, and gone
farther south, for fear of the Moors; and the Moors
not thinking it worth inhabiting, hy'reason of its

'barrenness, and indeed both forsaking it because of

the prodigious numbers of tigers, lions, leopards, and -

l

other furious creatures which harbour there, so that,

l

. the Moors use it for their hunting only, where they

go like an army,two or three thousand men at_a time;
and indeed for near a hundred miles together upon
this coast. we saw nothing but a waste uninhabited
country by day, and heard nothing but howliugs aud-
Ioarings of wild beasts by night.

Once or twice. in the day-time, I thought I saw".
the Pico of Teuerili'e, being the high top of the
mountain Teneriife in the Canaries, and had a great
mind to venture out in hopes of reaching thither;
but, having tried twice, I was forced in again by
contrary winds, the sea also going too high for my
little vessel; so I resolved to pursue my first design,
and keep along the shore.

Several times we were obliged to land for fresh
water, after we had left this place; and once in par-
ticular, being early in the morning, we came to an
anchor under alittle point of water, which was pretty
high, and the tide beginning to flow, we lay still to
go farther in. Xury, whose eyes were more about
him than,it seems, minewere, calls softly to me, and
tells me that we had best go farther off the shore,
' For,' says he, 'look, yonder lies a dreadful monster
on the side of that hillock, fast asleep.' I looked
where he pointed, and saw a dreadful monster in-
deed; for it was a terrible great lion, that lay on
the side of the shore, under the shade of a piece of
the hill, that hung as it were a little over him.
' Xury.' said 1,' you shall go on shore,and kill him.'

- Xu'ry looked frighted, and said, ' Me kill! He eat
me at one mouth! ' one mouthful he meant. How.

', ever, I said no more to the boy. but bade him be
still, and took our biggest gun, which was almost
musket-bore, and loaded it with a good charge of
powder, and with two slugs, and laid it down ; then

I loaded another gun with two bullets, and the third
(for we had three pieces) I loaded with live smaller
bullets. I took the best aim I could with the first
piece, to have shot him into the head; but he lay so
with his leg raised a little above his nose. that the
slug hit his leg about the knee, and broke the bone.
He started up growling at first, but finding his leg

' broke, fell down again, and then got upon three
legs, and gave the most hideous roar that ever I
heard.. 1. was a little surprised that I had not hit
him on the head: however, 1 took up the second
piece immediately; and, though he began to more
off, fired again, and shot him into the head, and had
the pleasure to see him drop, and making but little
noise, he lay struggling for life. Then Xury took
heart, and would have me let him go on shore.
' Well, go,' said I. So the boy jumped into the
water, and taking a little gun in one hand,swam-
to shore with the other hand, and coming close
to the creature, put the muzzle of the piece to his
ear, and shot him into the head again, which disc
patched him quite.

.This was game indeed to us,but this was no food;
and I was very sorry to lose three charges of pow-
der and shot upon a creature that was good for no-
thing to us. I-lowevcr,_Xury said lie-would have
some of him: so he comes on board, and asked me

I

to give him the hatchet. ' For what, Xury?' said I. '
'Me cut off his head,' said he. However, Xury .

could not cut of? his head; but he cut elf a foot, and

brought-it with him, and it was a monstrous great '

one.
- I bethought myself, however, that perhaps the

skin of him might one way or other be of some value .

r to us; and I resolved to take oli' his skin if] could.
So Xury and I went to work with him; but Xury
was much the better workman at it, for i knew very

ill how to do it. Indeed it took us up both the -

whole day; but at last we got 05 the hide of him, =

and, spreading it on the top of our cabin, the sun '-

effectually dried it in two days' time, and it afterv
wards served me to lie upon.

After this stop,we made on to the southward con- '
tinually, for ten or twelve days, living very sparingly ? '

on our provisions, which began to abate very much,
and going no ol'tener in to the shore than we were

obliged to, for fresh water. My design in this was '

to make the river Gamhia or Senegall, that is to say, -

any where about the Cape dc Verd, where I was in
hopes to meet with some EurOpean ship; and if I did

not, I knew not what course I had to take, but to .

seek for the islands, or perish there among the Ne-
groes. I knew that all the ships from-Europe, which
' sailed either to the coast of Guinea, or to Brasil, or
to the East Indies, made this cape or those islands,
and, in a word,l put the whole of my fortune upon
this single point, either that I must meet with some
ship,.or must perish.

When I had pursued this resolution about ten days
longer, as I have said, I began to see that the land
was inhabited; and, in two or three places, as we
sailed by, we saw people stand upon the shore to
look at us: we could also perceive they were quite
black, and stark naked. 1 was once inclined to have
gone on shore to them,but Xury was my better coun-
sellor, and said to me, ' No go, no go.' However, I
hauled in nearer the shore, that 1 might talk to them,
and I found they ran along the shore by me a good
way. I observed they had no weapons in their
hands, except one, who had a long slender stick,
which Xury said was a lance, and that they would

throw them a great way with good aim: so I kept at
' a distance, but talked with them by signs as well as
I could, and particularly made signs for something to
eat. They beckoned to me to stop my boat, and they
would fetch me some meat. Upon this I lowered
the top of my sail, and lay by,and two ofthem ran up
into the country,and in less than half an hour came
back, and brought with themtwo pieces of dry flesh,
and some corn,such as is the produce of their coun-
try ;- but we neither knew what the one or the other
was: however. we were willing to accept it. But
how to come at it, was our next dispute, for I was
not for venturing on shore to them, and they were
as much afraid of us ; but they took a safe way for
us all, for they brought it to the shore, and laid it
down,.and went and stood a great way off, till we
fetched it on board, and then came close to us
again.

We made signs of thanks to them, for we had no-
thing to make them amends; but an opportunity of-
fered that very instant to oblige them wonderfully;
for while we were lying. by the shore, came, two
mighty creatures, one pursuing the other (as we took
it) with great fury, from the mountains towards the
sea: whether it was the male pursuing the female,
or whether they were in sport or in rage, we could
not tell any more than we could tell whetherit was
usual or strange; but I believe it was the latter,
because, in the first place, those ravenous creatures
seldom appear but in the night; and, in the second
place, we found the peeple terribly frighted, espe-
cially the women. The man that had the lance or
dart did not; fly from them, but the rest did. How-
ever, as the two creatures ran directly into the
water, they did not seem to ofl'er to fall upon the
Negroes, but plunged themselves into the sea, and
swam about as if they had come for their diversion: -
at last one of them began to come nearer our boat
than at first I expected; but I lay ready for him,for
I had loaded my gun with all possible expedition, -
and bade Xury load both the others. As soon as he
came fairly within my reach, I fired, and shot him
directly into the head. Immediately he sunk down
into the water, but he rose instantly, and plunged up
and down as if he was struggling for life; and so in.
deed he was. He immediately made to the shore;
but, between the wound, which was his mortal hurt '
and the strangling of the water, he died just before
he reached the shore.

It is impossible to express the astonishment of
these poor creatures at the noise and the of my gun:
some of them were ready even to die for fear, and
fell down as dead with the very terror. But when '
they saw the creature dead, and sunk in the
water, and that I made signs to them to come to the
shore, they took heart, and came to the shore, and
began to search for the creature. '1 found him by
his blood staining the water, and by the help of a
rope, which I flung round him,and gave the Negroes
to haul, they dragged him on shore,and found that
it was a most curious leopard, spotted and fine to
an admirable degree; and the Negroes held up their
hands with admiration, to think what it was I killed
him with.

The other creature, frighted with the flash of fire,
and the noise of the gun, swam to the shore, and
ran up directly to the mountains, from whence they
came, nor could I at. that distance know what it
Was. I found quickly the Negroes were for eating
the flesh of this creature, so I was willing to have
them take it as a favour from me, which, when I
made signs to them that they might take him, they
were very. thankful for. Immediately they fell to
work with him, and though they had no knife, yet
with a sharpened piece of wood they took elf his
skin as readily, nay, much more readily than we
would have done with a knife. They offered me some
of the flesh, which I declined, making as if I would
give it them, but made signs for the skin, which.
they gave me very freely, and brought me a great
deal more of their provision, which though I did not
understand, yet I accepted. Then I made signs to
them for some water, and held out one of my jars
to them, turning its bottom upward, to shew that
it was empty, and that I wanted to have it filled.
They called immediately to some of their friends,
and there came two women, and brought a great
vessel made of earth, and burnt, as I suppose, in
the sun : this they set down for me, as before, and E
sent Xury on shore with my jars, and filled them
all three. The women were as stark naked as the
men.

I was now furnished with roots and corn.such as
it was, and water; and, leaving my friendly Negroes,
I made forward for about eleven days more, with-
out ofl'ering to go near the shore, till I saw the land
run out a great length into the sea, at about the
distance of four or five leagues before me, and, the
sea being very calm, I kept a large offing tomake
this point; at length, doubling the point at about
two leagues from the land, I saw plainly land on
the other side to seaward; then I concluded, as it
was most certain indeed, that this was the Cape dc
Verd, and those the islands, called from thence
Cape 'de Verd Islands. However, they were at a
great distance, and I could not well tell what- I had
- best to do; for if I should be taken with a fresh of
wind, I might neither reach one nor other.

In this dilemma, as I was very pensive, I stepped
into the cabin, and sat me down, Xury having the.
helm,'when on a sudden the boy cried out, ' Mas.
ter, master, a ship was a sail!' and the foolish boy
was frighted out of his wits, thinking it must needs
be some. of his master's ships sent to pursue us.
when I knew we were gotten far enough out of
their reach. I jumped out of the cabin, and imme-
diately saw not only the ship, but what she was;
'viz. that it was a Portuguese ship, and. as I thought,

was bound to the coast of Guinea for Negroes. But .

when I observed the course she steered, I was soon
convinced they were bound some other way, and
did not design to go any nearer to the shore, upon
'which 'I stretched out to sea as much as I could,
'resolving to Speak with them, if possible.

With all the sail I could make, I found I should

it

not be able to come in their'way, but that they -

'would be gone by before! could make any signal to

them; but after I had crowded to the utmost, and .
began to despair, they, it seems. saw me by the 3

help of their perspective-glasses, and that it was
some European boat, which they supposed must be-
long to some ship that was lost; so they shortened
"sail to let me come up. I was encouraged with this,
and as I had my patron's ancient on board, I made
, a waft of it to them for a signal of distress, and
fired a gun, both which they saw; for they told me
they saw the smoke, though they did not hear the
gun. Upon these signals they very kindly brought

to, and lay by for me, and in about three hours -

time I came up with them.
They asked me what I was in Portuguese, and in
Spanish, and in French; but I understood none of
them: but at last a Scots sailor, who was on board,
called to me, and I answered him, and told him I
was an Englishman, that I had made my escapeout
of slavery from the Moors at Sallee. Then they bade
me come on board, and very kindly took me in, and
all my goods.

It was an inexpressible joy to me, that any one.
will believe, that I was thus delivered, as I esteemed
it, from such a miserable and almost hopeless con-
dition as l was in. I immediately offered all I had
to the captain of the ship, as a return for my deli-
verance; but he generously told me, he would take
nothing from me, but that all I had should be deli-
vered safe to me when I came to the Brasils. ' For,'
says he, ' I have saved your life on no other terms
than as I would be glad to be saved myself; and it
may one time or other be my lot to be taken up in
the same condition. Besides,' says he, ' when I carry
you to the Brasils, so great a way from your own
country, if I should take from you what little you
have, you will be starved there, and then [only take
away that life I have given. No, no,' says he, ' Sig-
nor Inglese [Mn Englishman], I will carry you thi-
ther in charity, and these things will help you to
buy your subsistence there, and your passage home
again.' ' '

As he was charitable in this proposal, so he was
just in the performance to a tittle; for he ordered the
seamen that none should offer to touch any thing I
had: then he took every thing into his own posses-
sion, and gave me back an exact inventory of them, ,
that I might hax 0. them again, even so much as my .
three earthen jars.

As to my boat, it was a very good one, and that
he saw, and told me he would buy it of me for the
ship's use, and asked me what I would have for it.
I told him he had been so generous to me in every
thing, that I could not offer to make any price of the
boat, but left it entirely to him; upon which he told
me he would give me a note of his hand to pay me

C 2
80 pieces of eight for it at Brasil, and when it came
there, if any one offered to give more, he would
make it up. He offered me also 60 pieces of eight
more for my boy, Xury, which I was loath to take;
not that I was not willing to let the captain have
him, but I was very loath to sell the poor boy's
liberty, who had assisted me so faithfully in procur-
ing my own. However, when I let him' know my -
reason, he owned it to he. just. and offered me this
medium, that he would give the boy an obligation
to set him free in ten years, if he turned Christian.
Upon this, Xury saying he was willing to go to
him, I let the captain have him. , '
' We had a very good voyage to the Brasils, and
arrived in the Bay de todos los Santos, or All Saints
Bay, in about twenty-two days after. And now I
was once more delivered from the most miserable ,
of all conditions of life; and what to do next with
myself, I was to consider.

The generous'treatment the captain gave me, I
can never enough remember: he would take nothing
of me for my passage, gave me 20 dueats for the
leopard's skin, and 40 for the lion's skimwhich I had
in the boat, and caused every thing I had in the
ship to be punctually delivered me; and what lwas
willing to sell, he bought, such as the ease. of bot-
tles, two of'my guns, and a piece of the lump. of
beeswax, for I had made candles of the rest: in a
word,l made about 920 pieces of eight of all my
cargo, and with this stock 1 went on snore in the
Brasils.

I had not been long here,but being recommended
_ to the house of a good honest man likehimself. who
had an ingenio, as they'call it, that is, a plantation
and a sugar-house, i lived with him some time, and
acquainted myself by that means with the manner
of their planting and making of sugar; and seeing
how well the planters lived, and how they grew
tic}: suddenly, I resolved, if i could get licence to

settle there, I would turn planter among them; reg
solving, in the mean time, to find out some way to
get my money which I had left in London remitted
to me. To this purpose, getting a kind of a letter
of naturalization, I purchased as much land that was
uncured as my money would reach, and formed a
plan for my plantation and settlement, and such a
one as mightbe suitable to the stock which I pro-
posed to myself to receive from England.

I had a neighbonry/a Portuguese of Lisbon, but
born of English parents, whose name was Wells, and. -
in much such circumstances as I was. I call him
neighbour, because his plantation lay-next to mine,
and we went on very sociably together: my stock
was but low asuvell as his, and we'rather planted
for food than any thing else for about two years.
However, we began to increase, and our land began
to come into order, so that the third year we planted
some tobacco, and made each of us a large piece of
ground ready for planting canes in the year to come;
but we both wanted help; and now ,1 found, more
than before, 1 had done wrong in parting with my
boy, Xury. '

' But, alas! for me to do wrong that never did
right, was no great wonder. I had no remedy but
to go on. I was gotten into an employment quite
remote to my genius, and directly contrary to the
life I delighted in, and for which I forsook my fa-
ther's house, and broke through all his good advice;
nay, I was coming into the very middle station, or
upper degree of low life, which my father advised
me to before, and which, if I resolved to go on with,
I might as well have staid at home, and never fa-
tigued myself in the world, as I have done: and I
used often to say to myself, I could have done this
as well in England among my friends, as have gone
5000 miles off to do it among strangers and savages
in a wilderness, and at such a distance as never to

hear from any part of the world that had the least
knowledge of me. - '

In this manner I used to look'upon my conditionage-ww- -

with the utmost regret. I had nobody to converse
with, but now and then this neighbour: no work to
be done but by the labour of my hands; and I used
to say, I lived just like a man cast away upon some
desolate island, that had nobody there but himself.
But how just has it been, and how should all men

reflect, that, when they compare their present con-

dition with others that are worse, lleaven may
oblige them to make the exchange, and be convinced
of their former felicity, by their experience! I say,
how just has it been, that the truly solitary life I

reflected on in an island of mere desolation should

be my lot, who had so often unjustly compared it.
with the life which I then led, in which, had I con-
tinned,1 had, in all probability, been exceedingly
prOSperous and rich!

I was in some degree settled in my measures for

carrying on the plantation, before my kind friend,

the captain of the ship that took me up at sea, went
back; for the ship remained there in providing her
loading, and preparing for her voyage, near thiee
months; when, telling him what little stock I had
left behind me in London, he gave me this friendly
and sincere advice: 'Signor lnglese,' says he (for
so he always called me), ' if you will give me letters,
and a procuration here in form to me, with orders
to the person who has your money in London, to
send your efi'ects to Lisbon, to such persons as I
shall direct, and in such goods as are proper for this
country, I will bring you the produce of them, God
willing, at my return; but, since human affairs are
all subject to changes .and disasters, I would have
you give orders but for 1001. sterling, which, you say,
is half your stock, and lot the hazard be run for the
first, so that if it come safe, you may order the rest
the same way, and if it miscarry, you may have the
other half to have recourse to for your supply.'
This was so wholesome advice, and looked so
friendly, that I could not but be convinced it was

the best course I could take; so I accordingly preo
pared letters to the gentlewomen with whom I had
left my money, and a procuration to the Portuguese
captain, as he desired.
' I wrote the English captain's widow a full ac-
count of all my adventures. my slavery, escape, and
how I had met with the Portugal captain at sea, the
humanity of his behaviour, and what condition I
was now in, with all other necessary directions for
my supply; and when this honest captain came to
Lisbon, he found means, by- some of the English
merchants there, to send over not the order only,
but a full account of my story, to a merchant at Lon-
don, who presented it effectually to her; whereupon
she not only delivered the money, but out of her
own pocket sent the POrtugal captain a very hand-
some present for his humanity and charity to me.
The merchant in London vested this 1005. in Enga
lish goods, such as the captain had written for, sent
them directly to him at Lisbon, and he brought them
all safe to me to the Brasils; among which, without
my direction (for I was too young in my business to
think of them), he had taken care to have all sorts
of tools, iron-work, and utensils necessary for my
plantation, and which were of great use to me.
When this cargo arrived, I thought my fortune
made, for I was surprised with the joy of it; and
my good steward, the captain, had laid out the 5!.
which my friend had sent him for a present for him-
selfuto purchase and bring me over a servant, under
bond for six years' service, and would not accept of -
any consideration, except a little tobacco, which I
would have him accept, being of my own produce.
Neither was this all; but my goods being all
English manufactures, such as cloth, stuff, baize, and
things particularly valuable and desirable in the
country, I found means "to sell them to avery great
advantage; so that I may say, I had more than four
times the value of my first cargo, and was now in-
finitely beyond my poor neighbour, I mean in the
advancement of my plantation; for the first thing Io'~"~| v rt' "" "

33 ROBINSON CRUSOE.

did-,Ibought me a Negro slave and an European
servant also : I mean another besides that which the
captain brought me from Lisbon.

But as abused prosperity is oftentimes made the
very means of our greatest adversity, so was it with
me. I went on the next year with great success in
my plantation: lraised fifty great rolls of tobacco
on my own ground, more than Iliad disposed of for
necessaries among my neighbours, and these fifty
rolls being each of above 100 lb. weight, were well
cured and laid by against the return of the fleet
from Lisbon. And now increasing in business and
wealth, my health began to be full of projects and
undertakings beyond my reach, such as are indeed
often the ruin of the best heads in business.

Had I continued in the station I was now in, I
had room for all the happy things to have yet be.
fallen me, for which my father so earnestly recom-
mended a quiet retired life, and which he had so
sensibly described the middle station of life to be
full of; but other things attended me, and I was still
to be the wilful agent of all my own miseries: and
particularly to increase my fault, and double the re-
flections upon myself which in my future sorrows I
should have leisure to make; all these miscarriages
were procured by my apparent obstinate adhering
to my foolish inclination of wandering abroad, and
pursuing that inclination in contradiction to the
clearest views of doing myself good in a fair and
plain pursuit of those prospepts,and those measures
of life, which Nature and Providence concurred to
present me with, and to make my duty.

As I had once done thus in breaking away from

'my parents, so I could not be content now; but I

must go and leave the happy view I had of, being a
rich and thriving man in my new plantation, only
to pursue a rash and immoderatc desire of rising
faster than the - nature of the thing admitted; and
thus I cast myself d0wn again into the deepest gulf
of human misery that ever man; fell into, or per-
haps could be consistent with life, and a state-of
health in the world.

To come then by just degrees to the particulars of
this part of my story: You maysuppose that having
now lived almost four years in the Brasils, and be-
ginning to thrive and prosper very well upon my
plantation, I had not only learned the language,but
had contracted acquaintance and friendship among
my fellow-planters, as well as among the merchants
at St. Salvadore, which was our port, and that, in'
my discourse'among them, I had frequently given
them an account of my two voyages to the coast of
Guinea, the manner of trading with the Negroes
there, and how easy it was to purchase upon the
coast, for trilies. such as beads, toys,knives, scissars,
hatchets, bits of glass, and the like, not only gold-
dust, Guinea-grains, elephant's teeth, 83c. but Nee
groes for the service of the Brasils,in great numbers.

They listened always very attentively to my dis-
courses on these heads, but especially to that part
which related to the buying Negroes, which was a
trade at that time not only not far entered into, but,
as far as it was, had been carried on by the assientos,
or permission of the kings of Spain and Portugal, and
engrossed in the public stock, so that few Negroes
were bought, and those excessive dear". '

It happened, being in company one day with some
merchants and planters of my acquaintance, and
talking of those things very earnestly, three of them
came to me the next morning, and told me they had
been musing very much upon what I had discoursed
of with them the last night, and they came to make
a secret proposal to me ; and, after enjoining me
secrecy, they totd me that they had a mind to fit
out aship to go to Guinea; that they had all planta-
tions as well as I, and were. straitened for nothing
so much as servants; that as it was a trade that
could not be carried on, because they could not
publicly sell the Negroes when they came home,
so they desired to make but one voyage, to bring
the Negroes on shore privately, and divide them:
among their own plantations; and, in a word, the

question was, whether I would go their supercargo '
in the ship, to manage the trading part upon the
coast of Guinea: and they offered me that I should
have my equal share of the Negroes, without pro- .
viding any part of the stock.

This was a fair. proposal, it must be confessed,had '
it been made to any one that had not had a settle-
ment and plantation of his own to look after, which
was in a fair way of coming to be very considerable,
and with'a good stock upon it. But for me that was
thus established, and had nothing to do but go on 351
had begun for three or four years more, and to have
sent for the other .1001. from England, and who in
that time, and with that little addition, could scarce
have failed of b. mg worth 3 or 40001 sterling, and .
that increasing too; for me to think of such a voyage,
was the most preposterous thing that ever man, in
such circumstances, could be guilty of.

But I, that was born to be my own destroyer,
could no more resist the ofl'er, than I could restrain
my first rambling designs, when my father's good
counsel was lost upon me. In a word, I told them '
I would'go with all my heart, if they would under,

take to look after my plantation in my absence,

and would dispose of it to such as I should direct,
if I miscarried. This they all engaged to do, and
entered into writings or covenants to do so, and
I made a formal will, disposing of' my plantation
and effects, in case of my death, making the cap-
tain of the ship that had saved my life, as before,
my universal heir, but obliging him to dispose of my
eil'ects as 1 had directed in my will: one half of the
produce being to himself, and the other to be shipped
to England.

In short, I tool: all possible caution to preserve
my effects, and to keep up my plantation. Had I
used half as much prudence to have looked into my
own interest, and have made a judgment of what I
' ought to have done and not to have done, I- had
certainly never gone away from so prosperous an
undertaking, leaving all the probable views of a
thriving circumstance, and gone upon a voyage to
. sea, attended with all its common hazards, to say
' nothing of the reasons I had to expect particular
misfortunes to myself.

But 1 was hurried on. and obeyed blindly the
dictates of my fancy, rather than my reason; and,
accordingly, the ship being fitted out, and the cargo
furnished, and 'all things done as by agreement by
my partners in the voyage, I went on board in an
evil hour again, the lst of September, 1659, being
the same day eight years that I went from my father
and mother at I~Iull,in order to act the rebel to their
authority, and the fool to my own interest.

Our ship was about 120 tons burden, carried six
guns, and fourteen men, besides the master, his boy,
and myself. We had on board no large cargo of
goods, except of such toys as were fit for our trade
with tho Negroes; such as beads, bits of glass,
shells,and odd trifles, especially little looking-glasses,
knives, scissars, hatchets, and the like.

The same day 1 went on board, we set sail,stand-
ing away to the northward upon our own coast,
with design to stretch over for the African coast,
when they came into about ten or twelve degrees of
northern latitude, which,it seems, was the manner of
their course in those days. We had very good wea'
ther, only excessive hot all the way upon our own
coast, till we came to the height of Cape St. Augus-
tiuo, from whence keeping farther off at sea, we lost
sight of land, and steered as if we were bound for
the Isle of Fernand de Norouba, holding our course
N.E. by N. and leaving those isles on the east. In
this course we passed the line in about twelve
days' time, and were, by our last observation, in
7 degrees, 22 minutes, northern latitude, when a
violent tornado or hurricane took us quite out of.
our knowledge: it began from the southeast. cameabout to the north-west. and then. settled into the

north-east, from whence it blew in such a terrible .

manner,that for twelve days together we could do
nothing but. drive; and scudding away before it, let
it carry us wherever fate and the fury of the winds
directed: and during these twelve days, I need not
say that I expected every day to be swallowed up;
nor did any in the ship expect to save their lives.
In this distress we had, besides the terror of the
storm,one of our men died of the calenture, and one

man and the boy washed overboard. About the

twelfth day, the weather abating a little, the master
made an observation as well as he. could,and found
that he was in about 11 degrees of north latitude,
but that he was 22 degrees of longitude difference
west from Cape St.Augustino; so that he found he
was gotten upon the coast of Guiana, 01 the north.
part of Brasil, beyond the river Amazoncs, towards
that of the river Oroonoque, commonly called the
Great River: and now he began to consult with me
what course he should take, for the ship was leaky,
and very much disabled, and he was for going di-
rectly back to the coast of Brasil.

I was positively against that; and, looking over
the charts of the sea coast of America with him, we.
concluded there was no inhabited country for us to
have recourse to, till we came within the circle of
the Caribbee islands, and therefore resolved to
stand away for Barbadoes, which, by keeping off at
sea, to avoid the iii-draught of the Bay or Gulf of
Mexico. we might easily perform, as we hoped,in
about fifteen days' sail: whereas we could not pos-
sibly make our voyage to the coast of Africa, with-
out some assistance both to our ship, and to our-
selves.

With this design, we changed our course, and
steered away N. W. by W. in order to reach some
of our Enulish islands, where I hoped for relici;
but our voyage was otherwise determined: for,being

4 in the latitude 0512 degrees, 18 minutes, a second-..

storm came upon us, which carried us away with
the same impetnosity westward, and drove us so
out of the very way of all human commerce, that
had all our lives been saved, as to the sea, we were
rather in danger of being devoured by savages, than
ever returning to our own'country. '

In this distress, the wind still blowing very hard,
one of our men, early one morning, cried out,
' Land!' and we had no sooner run out of the cabin
to look out, in hopes of seeing whereabouts in the
world we were. but the ship struck- upon a sand,
and,.in a moment, her motion being so stopped, the
sea broke over her in such a manner that we ex-
pected we should all have perished immediately;
and we were even driven into our close quarters,
to shelter us from the very foam and spray of the
sea. _ -

It is not easy for any one, who has not been in
the like condition, to describe or conceive the con-
sternation-of men in such circumstances. We knew
nothing where' we were, or upon what land it was
we were driven, whether an island or the main, whe-
ther inhabited or not inhabited; and as the rage of
the wind was still great, though rather less than at
first, we could not so much as hope to have the ship
held many minutes without breaking in pieces, unless
the winds, by a kind of miracle, should turn imme-
diately about. In a word, we sat looking one upon
another, and expecting death every moment, and
every man acting accordingly, as preparing for an-
other world, for there was little or nothing more for
us to do in this: that which was our present com-
fort, and all the comfort we had, was, that, contrary
to our expectation, the ship did not break yet, and
that the master said the wind began. to abate.

Now, though we thought that the wind did a
little abate, yet the ship having thus struck upon
the sand. and sticking too fast for us to expect her
getting off, we were in a dreadful condition indeed,
and had nothing to do but to think of saving our.__.--.- 'r .3--

44 ROBINSON CRUSOE.

lives as-well as we could. We had a boat at our
stern, just before the Storm, but she was first staved
by dashing against the ship's rudder, and in the
next place she broke away, and either sunk or was '
. driven off to sea, so there was no hope from her.
\Ve had another boat ex. board ; but how to get her '
offinto the sea, was a doubtful thing, However, ,
there was no room to debate, for we fancied the
ship would break in pieces every minute; and some
told us she was actually broken already.

In this distress, the mate of our vessel lays hold
of the boat, and with the help of the rest of the
men, they got her flung over the ship's side, and
getting all into her, let go, and committed ourselves,
being eleven in number, to God's mercy, and the
wild sea; for though the storm was abated consider-
ably, yet the sea went dreadfully high upon the
shore, and might well be'called, "Den wild zoe,' as
the Dutch call the sea in a storm.

And now our case was very dismal indeed ; for we
'all.saw plainly that the sea went so higli', that the
.boat could not escape, and that we should be in- .
evitably drowned. As to making sail, we had none;
nor, if we had, could we have done any thing with '
it; so we worked at the ear towards the land, though
with heavy hearts, like men going to execution; for
we all knew, that. when the heat came near the
shore, she would be dashed in a thousand pieces,
by the breach of the sea. However, we committed
our souls to God in the most earnest manner; and
the wind driving us towards the shore, we hastened
our destruction with our own hands, pulling, as well
as we could, towards land.

What the shore was, whether rock or sand, whe-
ther steep or shoal, we knew not; the only hope
that could rationally give us the least shadow of
expectation, was, if we'might happen into some bay
_ or gulf, or the mouth of some river, where, by great
chance, we might have run our boat in, or got under
the ice of the land,and perhaps made smooth waters
But there was nothing of this appeared; but as we
made nearer and nearer the shore, the land looked
more frightful than the sea.

After we had rowed, or rather driven, about a
league and a half, as we reckoned it, a raging wave,
_ mountain-like,came rolling aste'rn of us. and plainly
bade us expect the ' coup de grace.' In a word, it
took us with such a fury, that it overset the boat
at once, and separating us as well from the boat
as from one another, gave us not time hardly to
say, ' 0 God!' for we were all swallowed up in a
moment.

Nothing can describe the confusion of thought
which I felt when I sunk into the water, for though
1 swam very well, yet I could not deliver .myself
from the waves so as to draw breath, till that wave
having driven me, or rather carried me a vast way
on towards the shore, and having spent itself, went
back. and left me upon the land almost dry,' but
half dead with the water I took in. 1 had so much
presence of mind. as well as breath left, that seeing
myself nearer the main land than I expected, I got
upon my feet, and endeavoured to make on towards
the land, as fast as I could, before another wave
should return, and take me up again. But I soon.
found it was impossible to avoid it, for I saw the
sea come after me as high as a great hill, and as
furious as an enemy, which I had no means or
strength to contend with; my business was to hold
my breath, and raise myself upon the water, if I
could, and so by swimming to preserve my breath-
ing, and pilot myself towards the shore, it' possible;
my greatest concern now being that the wave, as it
would carry me a great way towards the shore when
it came on, might not carry me back again with it,
when it gave back towards the sea.

The wave that came upon me again, buried me at
once twenty or thirty feet deep in its own body,and
I could feel myself carried with a. mighty force and
swiftness towards the shore a very great way; butI
held my breath, and assisted myself to swim still
forward with all my might. I was ready to burst
with holding my breath, when, as I felt myself
rising up. so, to my immediate relief, I found my
head and hands shoot out above the surface of the
water; and though it was not two seconds of time
that I could keep myself so, yet it relieved me
greatly, gave me breath and new courage. I was
covered again with water a good while, but not so
long but I held it out, and finding the water had
spent itself, and began to return, I struck forward
against the return of the waves, and felt ground
again with my feet, I stood still a few moments to
recover breath, and till the water went from me,
and then I took to my heels, and ran with what
strength I had, farther towards the shore. But
neither would this deliver me from the fury of the_
sea, which came pouring in after me again, and
twice 'more I was lifted up by the waves, and car-
ried forwards as before, the shore being very flat.
The last time of these two had well near been
fatal to me; for the sea having hurried me along as
before, landed me, or rather dashed me, against a'
piece ofa rock, and that with such force as it left
me senseless. and indeed helpless, as to my own
deliverance; for the blow taking my side and breast,
beat the breath, as it were, quite out of my body,
and had it returned again immediately, I must have ,
been strangled in the Water; but 1 recovered at
little before the return of the waves, and. seeing I -
should be covered again with the water. I resolved
to hold fast by a piece of the rock, and so to hold
my breath. if, possible, till the wave went back.
Now, as the waves were not so high as at lirst, being
near land, I held my hold till the wave abated, and
then fetched another run,which brought me so near
the shore, that the next wave, though it went over ,
me, yet did not so swallow me up as to carry me-
away; and the next run I took, I got to the main
land, where, to my great comfort, I clambered up
the cliffs of the shore, and sat me down upon the
grass, free from danger, and quite out of the reach
of the water.

I was now landed, and safe on shore, and began
to look up and thank God that my life was saved,
in a case wherein there was some minutes before
scarce any room to hope.- I believe it is impossible
to express to the life, what the ecstasies and trans-
ports of the soul are when it is so saved, as I may
Say, out of the. very grave: and I do not wonder
now at that custom,viz. that when a malot'actor, who
has the halter about his neck, is tied up. andjust
going to be turned off, and has a reprieve brought
to him; I say, I do not wonder that they bring a
' surgeon with it, to let him blood that very mo-
ment they tell him of it, that the surprise may not
drive tlie'animal spirits from the heart, and over-

whelm him :
\

For sudden joys, like griefs, confound at first.

I walked about on the shore, lifting up my hands,
and my whole being, as I may say, wrapt up in the
contemplation of my deliverance,making a thousand
gestures and motions which Icannot describe, re-
fleeting upon all my comrades that were drowned,
and that there should not be one soul saved but
myself: for, as for them, I never saw them after-
wards,-or any sign of them, except three of their
hats, one cap, and two shoes that were not follows.

I cast my eyes to the stranded vessel, when the
breach and froth of the sea being so big, I could
:hardly see it, it lay so far off; and considered,
Lord! how Was it possible I could get on shore!

AfterI had solaced my mind with the comfortable
part of my condition, I began to look round me, to
see what kind of place I was in, and what was next
to be done, and I soon found my comforts abate,
and that, in a word, I had a dreadful deliverance;
for I was wet, had no clothes to shift me, nor any

\
thing either to eat or drink to comfort me, neither
did I see any prospect before me, but that of perish-
ing with hunger, or being devoured by wild beasts:
and that which was particularly afflicting to me,
was, that I had no weapon either to hunt and kill
any creature for my sustenance, or to defend myr
self against any other creature that might. desire to
kill me for theirs. In a word, 1 had nothing about
me but a knife, a tobacco-pipe, and a little tobacco
in a box: this was all my provision, and this threw
me into terrible agonios of mind, that for a whileI
ran about like a madman. Night coming upon me,
I began, with a heavy heart, to consider what
would be my lot, if there were any ravenous beasts
in that country, seeing at night they always come
abroad for their prey. .
All the remedy that offered to my thoughts at
that time, was, to get up into a thick bushy tree,-
like a fir, but thorny, which grew near me, and.
where I resolved to sit all night, and consider the
next day what death I should die; for, as yet, I saw
no prospect of life. I walked about a furlong from
the shore, to see. if I could find any fresh water to
drink, which I did to my great joy; and having
drank, and put a little tobacco in my mouth, to pre
vent hunger, I went to the tree, and getting up into.
it, endeavoured to place myself so as that, if I"
should sleep, 1 might not fall; and having cut me a
short stick, like. a trunchcon, for my defence, I took
up. my lodging; and having been excessively fa-

tigued, I fell fast asleep, and slept as comfortably

as I believe few could have done in my condition;
and found myself the most refreshed with it that1
think I ever was on such occasion. '

When I wakcd, it was broad day, the weather '
clear, and the storm abated. so that. the sea did, not
rage and swell as before: but that which surprised
me most, was, that the ship was lifted off, in the
night, from the sand-where she lay, by the swelling '
of the tide, and Was driven up almost as far. as the
rock, which I first mentioned, where 1 had been so
bruised by the dashing me against it. This being
within about a mile from the shore where] was, and
the ship seeming to stand upright still, I wished
_ myself on board, that, at least, I might save some
necessary things for my use.
When I came down from my apartment in the
' tree, I looked about me again; and the first thing I
. found was the boat, which lay as the wind and the
sea had tossed her upon the land, about two miles
on my right hand. I walked- as far as 1 could Upon
. the shore, to have got to her, but found a neck or
inlet of water between me and the boat, which was
about half a mile broad; so I came back for the
.prcsent, being more intent upon getting at the ship,
where I haped to find something for my present
subsistence. _
A little after noon I found the sea very calm ; and
the tide ebbed so far out, that I could come within

' p a quarter of a mile of the ship: and here I found a

fresh renewing of my grief; for 1 saw evidently that
if we had kept on board we had been all safe, that
is to say, we had all got safe on shore, and I had
not been so miserable as to be left entirely destitute
'of all comfort and company, as I now was. This
forced tears from my eyes again ; but as there was
little relief in that, I resolved, if possible, to get to
the ship; so I pulled off my clothes, for the weather
.was hot to extremity, and took the water; but.
when I came to the ship, my tlifiiculty was still
greater to know how to get on board; for as she lay
aground. and high out of the Water, there was no-
. thing within my reach to lay hold of. I swam round
her twice, and the second time I espied a small

. _ piece of rope, which I wondered I did not see at first,

hang down by the fore-chains, so low as that with
great difficulty 1 got hold of it, and, by the help of
that rope, got up into the forecastle of the ship.
Here I found that the ship was bulged, and had a

great deal of water in her hold, but that she lay so
D
on the side of a bank of hard sand, or rather earth,
that her stern lay lifted up upon the bank, and her
head low almost to the water; by this means all her
quarter was free, and all that was in that part was
dry: for you may be sure my first work was to search
and to see what was spoiled, and what was free; and
first I found that all the ship's provisions were dry
and untouched by the water; and being very well
disposed to eat, I went to the bread-room, and tilled
my pockets with biscuit, and ate it as I went about
other things, for I had no time to lose. I also found
some rum in the great cabin, of which I took a large
drawn, and which I had indeed need enough of, to
spirit me for what was before me. Now I wanted
nothing but a boat to furnish myself with many
things which I foresaw would be very necessary to
me.

It was in vain to sit still and wish for what was
not to be had ; and this extremity roused my applica-
tion. We had several spare yards, and two or three
large spars of wood, and a Spare top-mast or two in
the ship; I resolved to fall to work with these, and
flung as many of them overboard as I could manage
for their weight, tying every one with a rope, that
they might not drive away. When this was done, I
went down the ship's side. and pulling them to me,
I tied four of them fast together at both ends, as
well 351 could, in the form of a raft; and laying two
or three short pieces of plank upon them crossways.
I found I could walk upon it very well, but that it
was not able to bear any great weight, the pieces
being too light: so I went to work, and, with a car-
penter's saw, I cut a spare top-mast into three
lengths, and added them to my raft, with a great
deal of labour and pains; but the hope of furnish-
ing myself with necessaries encouraged me to go
beyond'ivhat I should have been able to have done
upon another occasion. -

My raft was new strong enough to bear any rea-
sonable weight. My next care was what to load it
with, and how to preserve what I laid upon it from
the surf of the sea: but I was not long considering
this; I first laid all the planks or boards upon it
that I could get, and having considered well what I
most wanted, I first got three of the seamen's chests,
which 1 had broken open and emptied, and lowered
them down upon my raft. The first of these I filled
with provisions, viz. bread, rice, three Dutch cheeses,
five pieces of dried goat's flesh, which we lived much
upon, and a little remainder of European core,
which had been laid by for some fowls which we
brought to sea with us ; but the fowls were' killed :
there had been some barley and wheat together,but,
to my great disappointment, I found afterwards that
the rats had eaten or spoiled it all. As for liquors,
I found several cases of bottles belonging to our
skipper, in which were some cordial waters, and in
all about five or six gallons of arrack: these I stowed
by themselves, there being no need to put them into
the chest, nor any room for them. While I was de-
ing this, I found the tide began to flow, though very
calm, and I had the mortification to see my coat,
shirt, and waistcoat. which I had left on shore upon
the sand, swim away ; as for my breeches, which were
only linen and Open-knee'd, I swam on board in them
and my stockings. However, this put me upon rum-
maging for clothes, of which I found enough, but
took no more than I wanted for present use, for
1 had other things which my eye was more upon:
.as first, tools to work with on shore, and it was after
long searching that I found out the carpenter's
chest, which was indeed a very useful prize to me,
and much more valuable than a ship-loading of gold
Would have been at that time. I got it down to my
Taft. even whole as it was, without losing time to look
into it, for I knew in general what it contained.
My next care was for some ammunition and arms.
There were two very good fowling-pieces in the great
cabin, and two pistols; these I secured first, with
some powder-horns, a small bag of shot, and two
old rusty swords. I knew there were three barrels

of powder in the ship, but knew not where our gun-
' ner had stowed them,but with much search I found
them, two of them dry and good, the third had
taken water: those two I got to my raft, with the
arms. And now I thought myself pretty well
freighted, and began to think how I should get to
shore with them, having neither sail,oar, or rudder,
and the least cap-fullof wind would have overset
all my navigation. .

I had three encouragements. First, A smooth and
calm sea. Secondly. The tide rising and setting in to
the shore. 'l'hirdly, What little wind there was, blew
me towards the land. And thus, having found two
or three broken oars belonging to the boat, and be-
sides the tools which were in the chest,l found two
saws, an axe, and a hammer. and with this cargo I
put to sea. For a mile, or thereahouts, my raft
went very \vcll, only that I found it drive a little
distant from the place where I had landed before,
by which 1 perceived that there was some indraught
of the water, and consequently I hoped to find some
creek or river there, which 1 might make use of as a
port to get to land with-my cargo.

As I imagined, so it was: there appeared before
me a little opening of the land. I found a strong
current of the tide set into it, so I guided my raft as
well as I could, to keep in the middle of the stream.
But here 1 had like to have suffered a. second ship-
wreck, whieh, if I had, I think verily would have
broken my heart; for knowing nothing of the coast,
my'r'aft run aground, at one end of it, upon a shoal.
and not being aground at the other end, it wanted
but a little that all my cargo had slipped off towards
that end that was afloat, and so fallen into the water:
I did my utmost by setting my back against the
chests, to keep them in their places, but could not

thrust of? the raft with all my strength; neither ._

durst 1 stir from the posture I was in, but, holding
up the chests withall my might, stood in that man-"New

ner near half an hour, in which time the rising of
the water brought me a little more upon a level; and
a little after,'the water still rising, my raft floated
again, and ~I thrust her off with the oar I had, into
the channel, and then driving up higher, I at length
found myself in the mouth of a little river, with
land on both sides. and a strong current of tide run-
ning up. I looked on both sides for a prOper place
to get to shore, for I was not willing to be driven
too high up the river, hoping in time to see some
ship at sea, and therefore resolved to place myself

as near the coast as I could.

At length I spied a little cove on the right shore
of the creek, to which with great pain and difficulty
1 guided my raft, and at last got so near, as that,
reaching ground with my oar, I could thrust her
directly in 3 but here I had like to have dipped all
my cargo in the sea again; for that shore lying pretty
steep, that is to say, sloping, there was no place to
land, but where one end of the float, if it ran on
shore, would lie so high, and the other sink lower,
as before, that it would endanger my cargo again.
All that I could do, was to wait till the tide was at
the highest, keeping the raft with my oar, like an
anchor, to hold the side of it fast to the shore, near
a flat piece of ground, which I expected the water
would flow over; and so it did. As soon asI found
water enough (fer my raft dr'ew about a foot of
Water), I thrust her upon that flat piece of ground,
and there "fastened or moored her, by sticking my

two broken oars into the ground, one on one side

near one end, and one on the other side near the
other end; and thus-I lay till the water ebbed away,

and left my raft and all my cargo safe on shore.

My next 'work was to view the country, and seek
a proper place for my habitation, and where to stow
my goods, to secure them from whatever might hap--
pen. Where I was,1 yet knew not; whether on the
continent, or on an island; whether inhabited, or
not inhabited; whether in danger of . wild beasts or
not. There was a hill not above a mile from me, V
which rose up very steep and high, and which seemed '
to overtop some other hills, which lay as in a ridge '

from it northward. I took out one of the fowling-
pieces, and one of the pistols, and a horn of pow.
der, and, thus armed, I travelled for discovery up
to the top of that hill, where, after I had with great
labour and difliculty got up, I immediately saw my
fate, to my great affliction: viz. that I was in an
island, environed every way with the sea, no land
to be seen, except some rocks, which lay a great way
off, and two small islands, less than this, which lay
about three leagues to the west.

I found also that the island I was in was barren,
and, as I saw good reason to believe, uninhabited,
except by wild beasts, of which, however, I saw
none ; yet I saw abundance of fowls, but knew not
their kinds, neither, when I killed them, could I
tell what was tit for food, and what not. At my
coming back, I shot at a great bird, which I saw
sitting upon a tree, on the side of a large wood. I
believe it was the first gun that had been fired there,
since the creation of the world. I had no sooner
fired, but from all the parts 'of the wood there arose
an- extraordinary number of fowls, of many sorts,
making a confused screaming and crying, every one
according' to his usual note; but not one of them
of any kind that I knew. As for that creature I
killed, I' took it to be a kind of a hawk, its colour
and beak resembling it, but it had no talons or claws
more than common: its flesh was carrion,and fit for
nothing.

Contented with this discovery, I came back to
my raft, and fell to work to bring my cargo on shore,
which took me up the rest or the day. What to do
with myself at night, I knew not, nor indeed where
to rest; for I was afraid to lie down on the ground,
not knowing but some wild beast might devour me.
though I afterwards found there was really no need
for those fears.
However, as well as I could, I barricadoed myself
round with the chests and boards thatI had brought
on shore, and made a kind of a hut for that night's
lodging: as for food, I yet saw not which way to
supply myself, except that I had seen two or three
creatures, like hares, run out of the wood where I
shot the fowl.

I now began to consider that I might yet get a.
great many things out of the ship, which would be
useful to me, and particularly some of the rigging
and sails, and such other things as might come to
hand, and I resolved to make another voyage on
board the vessel, if possible ; and as I knew that the
first storm that blew must necessarily break her all
in pieces, I resolved to 'set all other things apart,
till I got every thing out of the ship that I could
get: then I called a Council, that is to say, in my
thoughts, whether I should take back the raft, but
this appeared impracticable, so I resolved to go as
before, when the tide was down, and I did so, only
that'I stripped before I went from my hut, having
nothing on but a checkered shirt, a pair of linen
drawers, and a pair of pumps on my feet.

I got on board the ship as before, and prepared a
second raft; and having had experience of the first,
I neither made this so unwieldy, nor loaded it so
hard; but yet I brought away several things very
useful to me; as first, in the carpenter's store I found
two or three bags full of nails and Spikes, a great

'that I could find, and a spare fore-top-sail, ham-
.mock, and some bedding; and with this I loaded
-my second raft, and brought them also all safe on

shore, to my very great comfort.

I was under some apprehensions during my ab-
sence from the land, that at least my provisions
might. be devoured on shore; but when I came back,

.1 found no sign of any visitor, only there sat a crea-

ture like a wild cat upon one of the chests, which,
when I came towards it. ran away to a little dis-
tunce, and then stood still. She sat very composed
and unconcerned, and looked full in my face, as if
she had a mind to be acquainted with me. 1 pre-

sented my gun at her; but as she did not under-
.stand it, she was perfectly unconcerned at it, nor

did she offer to stir away; upon which I tossed her
a bit of biscuit, though by the'way I was not very
free of it, for my store was not great. However I
spared her a bit, I say. and she went to it, smelled
of it, and eat it, and looked (as pleased) for more;

' but I thanked her, and could spare no more; so she

marched ofl'.

Having got my second cargo on shore (though I
was fain to open the barrels of powder, and bring
them by parcels, for they were too heavy, being large
casks), I went to work to make a little tent with the
sail and some poles which I cut.for that purpose;
and into this tent I brought every thing that I
knew would spoil, either with rain or sun; and I piled
all the empty chests and casks up in a circle round
the tent, to fortify it from any sudden attempt, either
from man or beast.

When I had done this, I blocked up the door of
the tent with some boards within, and an empty
chest set up on end without, and'spreading one of
the beds upou the ground, laying my two pistolsjust
at my head, and my gun at length by me, I went to
bed, for the first time, and slept very quietly all
night, being very weary and heavy; for the night
before I had slept little, and had laboured very hard

all day. as well to fetch those things from the ship,
as to get them on shore. _

I had the biggest magazine of all kinds now that
ever were laid up, I believe, for one man ;, but I
Was not satisfied still, for while the ship sat upright
in that posture, I thought I ought to get every thing
out of her that I could: so every day, at low water,
I went on board, and brought away something or
other. But particularly the third time I went,-I
brought away as much of the rigging as I could, as
also all the small ropes and rope-twine I could get,
with a piece of spare canvas, which was to mend the
sails upon occasion, and the barrel of wet gun-pow-
der. In a word, I brought away all the sails first
and 12m, only that-I was fain to cut them in pieces,
and bring as much at a time as I could; fur they
were no more useful to me for sails, but as mere
canvas only.

But that which comforted me more still,was, that
at last of all, after I had made five or six such voy-
ages as these, and thought I had nothing moreto
expect from the ship that was worth my meddling
with, I say, after all this, I found a great hogshead
of bread, three large runlets of rum or spirits, a
box of sugar, and. a barrel of fine flour: this. was
surprising to me, because I had given over expect-
ing any more provisions. except what was spoiled
by the water. I soon emptied the hogshead of that
bread, and wrapt it up, parcel by parcel, in pieces
of the sails, which I cut out; and, in a word.
I got all this safe on shore also, though at several
times.

The next day I made another voyage; and now,
having plundered the ship of what was portable, and
fit to hand out,I began with the cables; and cutting
the great cable into pieces. such as I could move,
I got two cables and- a haulser on shore, with all
the iron-work I could get; and having cut down the
sprit-sail-yard, and the mizen-yard, and every thing

. I could to maize a large raft,I loaded it with all

D2those heavy goods, and came away. But my good

luck began to leave me, for this raft was so unwieldy,-

and so overladen, that after I was entered the little
cove, where I had landed the rest of my goods,

not being able to guide it so handily as I did the
other, it' overset, and threw me and all my cargo'

into the-water. As for myself, it was no great harm,
for I was near the shore; but as to my cargo it was
great part of it lost, especially the iron, which 1 ex-
pected would have been of great use to me. How-
ever,when the tide was out, I got most of the pieces
of cable ashore, and some of the iron, though with
infinite labour, for I was fain to dip for it into the
water,a work which' fatigued me very much. After
this, I went every day on board, and brought away
what I could get. -

I had been now thirteen days on shore, and had been
eleven times on board the ship, in which time I had
brought away all that one pair of hands could well
be supposed capable to bring, though I believe verily,
had the calm weather held, I should have brought
away the whole ship, piece by piece. But preparing
the twelfth time to go on board, I found the wind
began to rise: however, at- low water, I went 'on
board; and though I thought I had rummaged the
cabin so effectually, as that nothing more could be
found, yet I discovered a locker, with drawers in it,
in one of which I found two or three razors, and
one pair of large scissars, with ten or a dozen good
knives and forks; in another, 1 found about thirty-
six pounds value in money, some European coin.
some Biasil, some pieces of eight,s some go'ld, some
silver. .

I smiled to myself at the sight of this money. ' 0
drug!' said 1, aloud, ' what art thou good for? Thou
art not worth to me, no, not the taking off the
'ground. One of those knives ts worth all this heap.
I have no manner of use for thee: even remain where
thou art, and go to the bottom as a creature whose
life is not worth saving!' However, upon second
thoughts I took it away, and wrapping all this in a
piece of canvas, I began to think of making another
raft; but while I was preparing this, I found'the sky
overcast, and the wind began to rise, and in a quar-
ter of an hour it blew a fresh gale from the shore:
it.presently occurred to me, that it was in vain to
pretend to make a raft, with the wind offshore, and
that it was my business to be gone before the tide
of flood began, otherwise I might not- be able to
reach the shore at all: accordingly I let myself
down into the water, and swam cross the channel,
which lay between the ship and the sand, and even
that with dillicultyenough, partly with the weight
of the things I had about me, and partly the rough-
ness of the water, for the wind rose very hastily,
and before it was quite high water it blew a storm.

But I was gotten home to my little tent, where I
laywith all my wealth about me very- secure: it
blew very hard all that night; and in the morning,
when I looked out, behold, no more ship was to be
seen! I was a little surprised,but recovered myself
with this satisfactory reflection; viz. that I had lost
no time, nor abated any diligence, to get every thing
out of her that could be useful to me; and that
indeed there was little left in her that I was able to
.bringaway. if 1 had had more time.- I now gave
over anymore thought of the ship, or of any thing
out of her, except what might drive on shore from
her wreck, as indeeddivers pieces of her afterwards
did; but those things were of small use to me.

My thoughts were now wholly empIOyed about
securing myself against either savages, if any should
,appear, or wild beasts, if any were in the island;
and I had many thoughts of the method how to do
this, and what kind of dwelling to make; whether
I should make me a cave in the earth, or a tent
upon the earth :. and, in short, I resolved upon
both; the manner and description of which it may
not be improperto give an account of.

I soon found the place I was in was not for my
m-lw-ubv-cfi~mmr. - -

60 ROBINSON CRUSOE.

settlement, particularly because it was upon a low
moorish ground near the sea, and I believed would
not be wholesome,and more particularly because there
was no fresh water near it; so I resolved to find a
more healthy and more convenient spot of ground.

I consulted several things in my situation, which
I found would be proper for me; first, Health, and
fresh water, as I- just now mentioned; secondly,
Shelter from the heat of the sun; thirdly, Security
from ravenous creatures, whether man or beast;
fourthly, A view to the sea, that if God sent any
ship in sight, I might not lose any advantage for my
deliverance, for which I was not willing to banish
all my expectation yet.

In. search of a place proper for this, I found a.
little plain on the side of a rising hill, whose front
towards this little plainwas as steep as ahouse-side,
so that nothing could come down upon me from the
top. -0n the side of this rock there was a hollow
place, worn a. little way in, like the entrance or
door of a cave, but there was not really any cave
or way into the rock at all. ' '

0n the hat of the green, just before this hollow
place, I resolved to pitch my tent. This plain was
not above a hundred yards broad, and about twice
as long, and lay like a green before my door, and at
the end of it descended irregularly every way down
into the low grounds by the seaside. It was on the
N.N.W. side of the hill, so that it was sheltered
from the heat every day, till it came to a W. and by
S. sun, or thereabouts, which in those countries is
near the setting.

Before I set up my tent, I drew a half-circle be-
fore the hollnw place, which took' in about ten yards
in its semi-diameter, from the rock, and twenty yards
in its diameter, from its beginning and ending.

In this half-circle I pitched two rows of strong
stakes, driving them into the ground till they stood
\ery firm likc price, the biggest end being out of the
ground about five feet and a half, and sharpened
on the top; the two rows did not stand above six
inches from one another.

Then I took the pieces of cable which I had cut
in the ship,and laid them in rows upon one another,
within the circle between these two rows of stakes,
up to the top, placing other stakes in the inside.
leaning against them, about two feet and a half
high, like a spur to a post; and this fence was so
strong, that neither man nor beast could get into it,
or over it. This cost me a great deal of time and
labour, especially to cut the piles in the woods, bring
them to the place, and drive them into the earth.

The entrance into this place I made to be, not by
a door, but by a short ladder, to go over the top;
which ladder, when I was in, I lifted over after me;
and so I was completely fenced in, and fortified, as
I thought, from all the world. and consequently
slept secure in the night, which otherwise I could
not have done; though, as it appeared afterwards,
there was no need of all this caution from the ene-
mies I apprehended danger from.

Into this fence, or fortress, with infinite labour, I
carried all my riches, all my provisions, ammunition,
and stores, of which you have the account above;
and I made me a large tent also, which, to preserve me
from the rains, that in one part of the year are very
violent there, I made double, viz. one smaller tent
within, and one larger tent above it; and covered
the uppermost with a large tarpaulin, which I had
saved among the sails.

And now I lay no more for awhile in the bed
which I had brought on shore, but in a hammock,
which was indeed a very good one, and belonged to
the mate of the ship.

Into this tent I brought all my provisious, and
every thing that would spoil by the wet; and having
thus enclosed all my goods, I made up the entrance,
which till now I had left open, and so passed and
repassed, as I said, by a short ladder.

- When I had done this, I began to work my way
into the'rock; andbringing all the earth and stones
that I dug down, out through my tent, I laid them
up within my fence in the nature of a terrace, so
that it raised the ground within-about a foot and a
half; and thus I made me a cave just behind my
tent, which served me like a cellar to my house.

It cost me much labour, and many days, before T

all these things were brought to perfection; and

therefore I must go back to some other things ,

which took up some of my thoughts. At the same

time it happened, after I had laid my scheme for .

the setting up my tent, and making the cave, that
a storm of rain falling from a thick dark cloud, a
sudden flash of lightning happened, and after that,
a great clap of thunder, as is naturally the effect of
it. 1 was not so much surprised with the lightning,
as 1 was with the thought which darted into my
mind as swift as the lightning itself: 0.my powder!
My very heart sunk within me, when I thought, that
at one blast all my-powder might be destroyed; on
which, not my defence only, but the providing me
food, as I thought, entirely depended: I was no-
thing near so anxious about my own danger; though.
had the powder took fire, I had never known who
had hurt me. '

Such impression did this make upon me,'that after, -

the storm was over, I-laid aside all my works, my

building and fortifying, and applied myself to make .

bags and boxes to separate my powder, and to keep
it a little and a little in a parcel, in Impes, that
whatever might come, it might not all take fire at
once, and to keep it so apart, that it should not be
possible to make one part fire another. I finished
this work in about a fortnight, and I think my
powder, which in all was about 1401b. weight, was
divided into no less than a hundred parcels. As
to the barrel that had been wet, I did not appre-
hend any danger from that, so I placed it in my
new cave, which in my fancy I called my kitchen;

and the rest I hid up and down in holes among the.
rocks. so that no wet might come to it, marking very
carefully where I laid it. '
In the interval of time while this was doing. I
went out at least once every day with my gun, as
well to divert myself, as to see if I could kill any
thing lit for food, and, as near as I could, to acquaint
myself with what the island produced. The first
time. I went out, I presently discovered, that there
were goats in the island, which was a great satis-
faction to me; but then it was attended with this
misfortune to me, viz. that theywere so shy, so sub-
tle, and so. swift of foot, that it was the diflicultest
thing in the world to come at them; but I was not
discouraged at this, not doubting but I might now
and then shoot one, as it soon happened; for after
- I had found their haunts a little, I laid wait in this
manner for them: I observed, if they saw me in the
Valleys, though they were upon the rocks, they
would run away as in a terrible fright; but if they
were feeding in the valleys, and I was upon the
rocks, they took no notice of me; from whence I
concluded, that by the Position of their optics, their
sight was so directed downward, that they did not
readily see objects that were above them. So after-
wards I took this method: I always climbed the
rocks first, to get above them, and then had fre-
quently a fair mark. The first shot I made among
these creatures, I killed a she-goat which had a little
kid by her, which she gave suck to, which grieved
me heartily; but when the old one fell, the kid
stood'stock-still by her till I came and took her up;
and-not only so, but when I carried the old one
with me upon my shoulders, the kid followed me
quite to my enclosure; upon which I laid down the
dam, and took the kid in my arms, and carried 'it
over my pale, in hopes to have bred it up tame; but
it would not eat; so I was forced to kill it,~and eat
it myself. These two supplied me with flesh a great
While"; for I ate sparingly, and saved my provisions
(my bread especially) as much as possibly I could.6i , noems'ou censors;

Having now fixed my habitation, I found it abso-
lutely necessary to provide a place to make a fire in,
and fuel to burn; and what I did for that, as also .
how I enlarged my cave, and what conveniencies I
made, I shall give a full account of in its place: but
I must first give some little account of myself, and :
of my thoughts about living, which it may well be i
supposed were not a few.

I had a dismal prospect of my condition; for as I g
was not cast away upon that island without being
driven, as is said, by a violent storm quite out of
the course of our intended voyage, and a great way,
via. some hundreds of leagues, out of the ordinary
course of the trade of mankind, I had great reason
to consider it as a determination of Heaven, thatin
this desolate place, and in this desolate manner, I
should end my life. The tears would run plenti.
fully down my face, when I made these reflections;
and sometimes I would expostulate with myself,
Why Providence should thus completely ruin its
creatures, and render them soabsolutely miserable,
so without help, abandoned, and so entirely de-
pressed. that it could hardly be rational to be
thankful for such a life? '

But something always returned swift upon me to
check these thoughts, and to reprove me; and par-
ticularly one day, walking with my gun in my hand
by the sea-side,I was very pensive upon the subject
of my present condition, when reason, as it were,
put in, expostulating with me .the other way, thus:
Well, you are in a desolate condition,it is true, but
pray remember,where are the rest of you? Did not
you come eleven of you into the baat? where are
the ten? why were not they saved, and you 1051:?
why were you singled out? is it better to be here or
there? And then 1 pointed to the sea. All evils
are to be considered with the good that is in them,
and with what worse attended them..

Then it occurred to me again, how well I was
furnished for my subsistence, and what would have

.-- a-"been my case, if it had not happened, which-was an

' hundred thousand to one, that the ship fioatedfrom

the place where she first struck, and was driven so
near to the shore, that I had time to get all- these
things out of her? What would have been my-case,
if 1 had been to have lived in the condition in which
1 at first came on shore, without necessaries of life,
or any means to supply and procure them? Parti-
cularly, said I aloud (though to myself),what would
I have done without a gun, without ammunition,
without any tools to make any thing, or to work
with? without clothes, bedding, a tent, or any man-
ner of coverings? And that now I had all these to

a sufficient quantity, and was in a fair way to pro-

vide myself in such a manner, as to live without my
gun when my ammunition was spent, so that I had
Intolerable view .of subsisting without any want as

long as I lived; for I considered from the beginning
-how I would. provide-for the accidents that might

happen,- and for the time that was to come', even not
only after my ammunition should be spent, but even
after my health or strength should decay.

I confess I had not then entertained any notion
of my ammunition being destroyed at one blast, I
mean my powder being blown up by lightning; and
this made the thoughts of it so surprising to me, when
it lightened and thundered, as 1 observed just now.

And now, being to enter into a. melancholy rela-
tion of a scene of silent life, such, perhaps, as was
never heard of in the worldbefore, I shall take it
from its beginning, and continue it in its order. It
was, by my account, the 30th of September, when,
in the manner as abovesaid, Lfirst set foot upon
this horrid island, when the sun being, to us, in its

.a'utumnal equinox, was almostjust over my'head;

for I reckoned myself, by observation, to be in the.
latitude of 9 degrees 22 minutes North of the Line.

After 1 hadbeen there about ten or twelve days,
it came into my thoughts, that I should lose my
reckoning of time for want of books, and pen and
ink, and should even forget the Sabbath days from
the working days: but to prevent this, I cut it with
my knife upon a large post, in capital letters; and,
making it into a great cross, I set it up on the shore .
where I first landed; viz. I came on shore here the
30th of Sept. 1659. Upon the sides of this square :
post I out every day a notch with my knife, and,
every seventh notch was as long again as the rest,
and every first day of the month as long again as '
that long one; and thus I kept my calendar, or
weekly, monthly, and yearly reckoning of time.

In the next place we are to observe, that among
the many things which I brought off the ship in the
several voyages, which, as abovementioned, 1 made
to it, I got several things of less value, but not at
all less useful to me, which 1 omitted setting down
before; as in particular, pens, ink, and paper, seve-
ral parcels in the captain's, mate's, gunner's, and
carpenter's keeping, three or four compasses, some .

mathematical instruments, dials, perspectives, charts, i -

and books of navigation, all which 1 huddled to- j
gether, whether I might want them or no; alsoI
found three very good Bibles, which came to me in '
my cargo from England, and which I had packed up
among my things: some Portuguese books also, and
among them two or three Popish prayer-books, and
several other books, all- which I carefully secured.
And I must not forget that we had in the ship a
dog and two cats. of whose eminent history I may
have occasion to say something in its' place; for I
carried both the cats with me ;- and as for the dog,
hejumped out of the ship of himself, and swam on
shore to me the day after i went onshore with my
first cargo, and was a trusty servant to me many
years; [wanted nothing that he could fetch me,
nor any company that he could make up to me; I
only wanted to have him talk to me, but that he
could not do. As 1 observed before, 1 found pen,
ink, and paper, and l husbanded them to the ab .
most; and I shall shew, that while my ink lasted, I t
kept things very exact; but after that was gone, I
could not; for I could not make any ink, by any
means that I could devise.

And this put me in mind that I wanted many
things, notwithstanding all that I had amassed to-
gether; and of these, this of ink was one, as also a
spade, pick-axe, and shovel, to dig or remove the
earth; needles, pins, and thread; as for linen, I
soon learned to want that without much difficulty.

This want of tools made every work I did go on
heavily, and it was near a whole. year before I had
entirely finished my little pale, or surrounded ha-
bitation: the piles, or stakes, which were as heavy
as I could well lift, were a longr time in cutting and
preparing in the woods, and more by far in bringing
home; so that I Spent sometimes two days in, cut-
ting and bringing home one of those'posts, and a
third day in driving it into the ground; for which
purpose I got a heavy piece of wood at first, but at
last bethought myselfof one of the iron crows,which
however, though I found it, yet made driving those
posts or piles very laborious and tedious work.

But what .need I have been concerned at the
tediousness of any thingI had to do, seeing I had
time enough to do it in? Nor had I any other em-
ployment, if that had been over, at least that I
could foresee, except the ranging the island to seek
for food,which I did more or less every day.

I now began to consider seriously my condition,
and the circumstance I was reduced to, and I drew
Up the state of my affairs in writing; not so much
to leave them to any that were to come after me,
for I was like to have but few heirs, as to deliver
my thoughts from daily poring upou them, and
afflicting my mind; and as my reason began now to
master my dc-spondency, I began to comfort myself
as well as 1 could, and to set the good against the
evil, that I might have somethmg to distinguish my
case from worse; and I stated it very impartially,
like debtor and creditor, the comforts I enjoyed,
against the miseries I suffered, thus:EVIL.
I am cast upon a hor-
rible desolate island, void
of all hope of recovery.

. I am singled out, and
separated, as it were,
from all the world, to
be miserable.

I am divided from man-
kind, a solitary, one ba-
nished from human so-
ciety.

I have no clothes to
cover me.

I am without any de-
fence or means to resist
any violence of man or
beast.

I have no soul to speak
to, or relieve me.

' 68 ROBINSON CRUSOE.

' GOOD.
But I am alive, and

not drowned, as all my .

ship's company was.

But I am singled out
too, from all the ship's a
crew, to be spared from ;

death; and He that mira-

culously saved me from _

death, can deliver me
from this condition.

But I am not starved,
and perishing on a bar-
ren place, affording no

' sustenance.

But I am in a hot cli- '2
mate, where, if I had .
clothes, I could hardly 3

wear them.

But I am east on an
island where I see no
wild beasts to hurt me,
as I saw on the coast of
Africa: and what if I
had 'been shipwrecked
there? ~

But God wonderfully
sent the ship in near
enough to the shore, that
I have gotten out so many
necessary things as will
either supply my wants,
or enable me to supply
myself, even as long as
1 live.
Upon thewhole, here was an undoubted testi-
mony, that there was scarce any condition in the
world so miserable, but there was something nega-
tive, or something positive, to be thankful for in it:
and let this stand as a direction from the experience
of the most miserable of all conditions in this world,
that we may always find in it something to comfort
ourselves from, and to set, in the description of
good and evil, on the credit-side of the accompt.

Having now brought my mind a little to relish
my condition, and giving over looking out to sea, to
see if I could spy a ship; 1 say', giving over these
things, Ibegan to apply myself to accommodate my
way of living, and to make things as easy to me as
I could.

i have already described my habitation, which
was a tent under the side of a rock, surrounded
with a strong pale of posts and cables, but I might
now rather call it a wall; for I raised a kind of wall
up against it of turfs, about two feet thick on the
outside; and after some time (I think it was a year
and a half) I raised rafters from it, leaning to the
rock, and thatched or covered it with boughs of
trees, and such things as 1 could get to keep out
the rain, which 1 found at some times of the year
very violent. -

1 have already observed how I brought all my
. goods into this pale, and into the cave which I had
made behind me; but 1 must observe too, that, at
first, this was a confused heap of goods, which, as
they lay in no order,- so they took up all my place:
I had no room to turn myself: so I set myself to
enlarge my cave, and worked farther into the earth;
for it was a loose sandy rock, which yielded easily
to the labour I bestowed on it: and so, when [
found I was pretty safe as to the beasts of prey, I
worked sideways to the right hand into the rock;
and, then turning to the right again, worked quite
out, and made me a door to come. out on the out-
srde of my pale or fortification.
This gave me notonly egress and regress, as it
was a back-Way to my tent, and to my store-house,
but gave me room to stow my goods.

And now I began to apply myself to make such
necessary things as I found I most wanted, particu-
larly a chair and a table; for without these I was
not able to enjoy the few comforts I had in the
world; I could not write or eat, or several things,
with so much pleasure without a table.

So [went to work; and here I must needs ob-
serve,~that as reason is the substance and original
of the mathematics, so by stating and squaring every
thing by reason, and by making the most rational
judgment of things, every man may be, in time,
master of every mechanic art. I had never handled
a tool in my life, and yet, in time, by labour, appli-
cation, and contrivauce, I found, at last, that I
wanted nothing but I could have made it, especially
if I had had tools: however, I made abundance of
things, even without tools, and some with no more
tools than an adze and a hatchet, which perhaps were
never made that way before, and that with infinite
labour. For example; if I wanted a board, I had
no other way but to cut down a tree, set it on an
edge before me, and how it flat on either side with
my.axe, till I had brought it to be as thin as a plank,
and then dub it smooth with my adze. It is true, by
this method I could make but one board out of a
whole tree; but this I had no remedy for, but pa:
tience, any more than I had for the prodigious deal
of time and labour which it took me up to make a
plank or board: but my time or labour was little
worth, and so it was as well employed one way as
another.

However, I made me a table and a chair, as I ob-
served above, in the first place, and this 1 did out of
the short pieces of boards that I brought on my
raft from the ship; but when I had wrought out
some boards, as above, I made large shelves of the
breadth of a foot and a half, one over another, all

.. _ _...--__..

along one side .of my cave, to lay all my tools, nails,
and ironwork, and, in a word, to separate every
- thing at large in their places, that I might easily
' come at them: also, I knocked pieces into the wall
of the rock to hang my guns, and all things that
would hang up.

So that, had my cave been to be seen, it looked
like a general magazine of all necessary things; and
1 had every thing so ready at my hand, that it was a.
great pleasure to me to see all my goods in such
order, and especially to find my stock of all neces-
saries so great. .

And now it was when I began to keep a journal
of every day's employment; for indeed at first I
was in too much hurry, and not only a hurry as to
labour, but in too much discomposure of mind, and
my journal would have been full of many dull
things. For example. I must have said thus: Sep-
tember the 30th, After I got to shore, and had es-
caped drowning, instead of being thankful to God
for my deliverance, having first vomited with the
great quantity of salt water which was gotten into
my stomach, and recovering myself a little, I ran
about the shore, wringing my hands, and beating my
head and face, exclaiming at my misery, and crying
out, I was undone! undone! till, tired and faint, I
Was forced to lie down on the ground to repose, but
durst not sleep for fear of being devoured.

Some days after this, and after I had been on
board the ship, and had got all I could out of her,
yet I could not forbear getting up to the top of a
little mountain, and looking out to sea, in hopes of
seeing a ship: then fancy, at a vast distance,.l Spied
a sail; please myself with the hopes of it; and then,
after looking steadily, till 1 was almost blind, lose
it Quite, and sit down and weep like a child, and
thus increase my misery by my folly.

But having gotten over these things, in some
measure, and having settled my household-stuff
and habitation, made me a table and a chair, and
all as handsome about me as I could, I began, I say.
to keep my journal, of which I shall here give you
the copy (though in it will be told all these particu-
lars over again), as long as it lasted; for at last
having no more ink, I was forced to leave it off.

THE JOURNAL.

SEPTEMBER. so, 1059. I, poor miserable R0- 1

biuson Crusoe, being shipwrecked during a dreadful :
storm in the. offing, came on shore on this dismal '
unfortunate island, which I called the Island of;

Despair, all the rest of the ship's company being
drowned, and myself almost dead.

All the rest of the day I spent in afflicting myself
at the dismal circumstances I was brought to, viz.
I had neither food, house, clothes, weapon, or place

to fly to, and in despair of any relief, saw nothing ;

but death before me. either that I should be de-

voured by wild beasts, murdered by savages, or i

starved to death for want of food. At the approach
of night, I slept in a tree, for fear of wild creatures;
but slept soundly, though it rained all night.
October 1. In the morning I saw, to my great
surprise, the ship had floated with the high tide, and
was driven on shore again much nearer the island.
which, as it was some comfort on one hand (for see-
ing her sit upright, and not broken in pieces, I
hoped, if the wind abated, 1' might get on board,
and get some food and necessaries out of her for
my relief), so, on the other hand, it renewed my
grief at the loss of my comrades, who, I imagined,

if we had all staid on board, might have saved the -

ship, or at least that they would not have been all ;

drowned, as they were; and that, had the men been 2

saved,we might perhaps have built us a boat out of .

the ruins of the ship, to have carried us to some

other part of the world. 1 Spent great part of this "
day in perplexing myself on these things; but at
length seeing the ship almost dry, I went upon the
sand as near as I could, and then swam on board.
. This day also continued raining, though with no
wind at all.

From the lst of October to the 24th. All these
days entirely spent in making several voyages to get
all I could out of the ship, which I brought on
shore every tide of flood upon rafts. Much rain
also in these days, though with some intervals of
fair weather; but, it seems, this was the rainy sea-
son.

October 24. I overset my raft, and all the goods
I had got upon it; but being in shoal water, and the

things being chiefly heavy,I recovered many of them
when the tide was out.

October 25. It rained all night, and all day,
with some gusts of wind, during which time the
ship broke in pieces, the wind blowing a little
harder than before, and was no more to be seen,
except the wreck of her, and that only at low
water. I spent this day in covering and securing
the goods which I saved, that the rain might not
Spoil them.

October 26. I walked about the shore almost all
day to find out a place to fix my habitation, greatly
concerned to secure myself from any attack, in the
night, either from wild beasts or men. Towards
night I fixed upon a proper place under a rock, and
marked out a semicircle for my encampment, which
I resolved to strengthen with a work, wall, or forti-
fication, made of double piles, lined within with
cable, and without with turf.

From the 26th to the 30th, I worked very hard
in carrying all my goods to my new habitatio'n,
though some part of the time it rained exceeding

ard.

The alst, in the morning, I went out into the
island with my gun, to see for some food, and dis-

cover the country; when I killed a she-goat, and her
E
kid followed me home, which I afterwards killed
also, because it would not feed.

November 1. I set up my tent under a rock, and
lay there for the first night, making it as large as I
could, with stakes driven in to swing my hammock
upon.

November 2. I set up all my chests and boards,
and the pieces of timber which made my rafts, and 1
with them formed a fence round me, a little within -
the place I had marked out for my fortification. l

November 3. I went out with my gun, and i
killed two fowls like ducks, which were very good
food. In the afternoon, went to work to make me a
table.

November 4., This morning I began to order my
times of work, of going out with my gun, time of
sleep, and time of diversion; viz. every morning I
walked out with my gun, for two or three hours, if
it did not rain; then employed myself to work till !
about eleven o'clock; then eat what I had to live '
on: and, from twelve to two, I lay down to sleep,
the weather being excessive hot, and then in the
evening to work again. The working part of this !
day and the next were wholly employed in making
my table, for I was yet but a very sorry workman,
tho'ugh time and necessity made me a complete na-
tural mechanic soon after, as I believe it would do
any one else. .

November 5. This day I went abroad with my
gun and my dog, and killed a wild eat; her skin
pretty soft, but her flesh good for nothing. Every
creature I killed, I took off the skins and preserved
them. Coming back, by the seashore, I saw many
sorts of sea-fowls which I (lid not understand; but '
was surprised, and almost frighted, with two orl
three seals, which, while I was gazing at, not well!
knowing what they were, got into the sea, andf
escaped me for that time. - A

November 6. After my morning walk, I went to
work with my table again, and finished it, though
not to my liking; nor was it long before I learned
to mend it.

November 7. Now it began to be settled fair
weather. The 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, and part of the
12th (for the 11th was Sunday, according to my
reckoning), I took wholly up to make me a chair,
and, with much ado, brought it to a tolerable shape,
but never to please me; and even in the making I
pulled it to pieces several times. Note, I soon neg-
lected keeping my Sundays; for, omitting my mark
for them on my post, I forgot which was which.

November 13. This day it rained, which re-
freshed me exceedingly, and cooled the earth; but
it was accompanied with terrible thunder and light-
ning, which l'righted me dreadfully, for fear of my
powder. As soon as it was over, I resolved to se-
parate my stock of powder into as many little par-
cels as possible, that it might not be in danger.

November 14, 15, 16. These three days I spent
in making little square chests or boxes, which might
hold about a pound, or two pounds at most, of
powder; and so putting the powder in, I stowed it
in places as secure and remote from one another as
possible. On one of' these three days I killed a
large bird that was good to eat, but I knew not
what to call it.

November 17. This day I began to dig behind
my tent into the rock, to make room for my farther
conveniency. Note, Three things I wanted exceed-
ingly for this work; viz. a pick-axe, a shovel, and a
wheelbarrow or basket: so I desisted from my
work, and began to consider how to supply that
Want, and make me some tools. As for the pick-
axe, I made use of the iron crows, which were ,
Proper enough, though heavy: but-the next thing
was a shovel or spade; this was so absolutely no.
cessary, that indeed I could do nothing efi'ectuall y
wrthout it; but what kind of one to. make, I knew
not.

November 18. The next day, in searching the
woods, I found a tree of that wood, or like it,
which, in the Brasils, they call the iron-tree, for its
exceeding hardness: of this, with great labour, and
almost spoiling my axe, I cut a piece, and brought '
it home too with difficulty enough, for it was ex-
ceeding heavy. '

The excessive hardness of the wood, and having
no other way, made me a long while upon this ma-
chine; for I worked it effectually, by little and
.little, into the form of a shovel or spade, the handle
exactly shaped like ours in England, only that the i
broad part having no iron shod upon it at bottom.
it would not last me so long: however, it served
well enough for the uses which I had occasion to
put it to: but never was a shovel, I believe, made
after that fashion, or so long a making.

I was still deficient, for I wanted a'basket, or a -
wheelbarrow: a basket I could not make by any
means, having no such things as twigs that would ;
bend to make wicker-ware, or at least none yet found ;
out; and, as to the wheelbarrow, I'fancied I could
make all but the wheel; but that I had no notion of, -
neither did I know how to go about it: besides, I 5,
had no possible way to make iron gudgeons, for the '
spindle or axis of the. wheel to run in, so I gave it
over: and so, for carrying away the earth which I
du'g out of the cave, I made me a thing like a had,
which the labourers carry mortar in, when they serve ,
the bricklayers.

This was not so difficult to me as the making the
shovel; and yet this, and the shovel, and the at-
tempt which I made in vain to make a wheel-
barrow, took me up no less than four days: I mean, i
always excepting my morning walk with my gum;
which I seldom failed, and very seldom failed alsoi
of bringing home something fit to eat. 1

November 23. My other work having stood still,-
because of my making these tools, when they were:
finished I went on ; and, working every day as myl
strength and time allowed, I spent eighteen days
entirely in widening and deepening my cave, that it
might hold my goods commodibusly.

Note, During-all this time, I worked to make this
room, or cave,spacious enough to accommodate me
as a warehouse or magazine, a kitchen, a dining-
room, and a cellar; as for a lodging, I kept to the
tent, except that.sometimes in the wet season of
the year it rained so hard, thatI could not keep
myself dry; which caused me afterwards to cover
all my place within my pale, with long poles. in the
form of rafters, leaning against the rock, and load
them with flags, and large leaves of trees, like a
thatch. - *

December 10. I began now to think my cave or
vault finished, when, on a sudden (it seems I had
made it too large), a great quantity of earth fell
down from the top and one side, so much that, in
short, it frighted me, and not without reason too;
for if I had been under it, I had never wanted a
grave~digger. Upon this disaster, I had a great
deal of work to do over again: for I had the loose
earth to carry out, and, which was of more import-
ance, I had the ceiling to prop up, so that I might
be sure no more would come down.

December 11. This day I went to work with it
accordingly, and got two shores, or posts, pitched
upright to the top, with two pieces of boards across
over each post. This I finished the next day ; and
setting more posts up with boards, in about a week
more. 1 had the roof secured; and the posts, stand-
ing in rows, served me for partitions to part of? my
house.

December 17. From this day to the 20th, I
placed shelves, and knocked up nails on the posts,
to hang every thing up that could be hung up;
and now I began to be in some order within
doors. ,

December 20. Now I carried every thing into
the cave, and began to furnish my house, and set up
some pieces of boards, like a dresser, to order my
victuals upon, but boards began to be very scarce
with me. Also I made me another table.

December 24. Much rain all night and all day:
no stirring out. .

December 25. Rain all day.

December 26. No rain, and the earth much
cooler than before, and pleasanter.

December 9']. Killed a young goatyand lamed
another, so thatI catched it, and led it home in a
string; when I had it home I bound and splintered _
up its leg, which was broke. N. B. I took such &
care of it, that it lived, and the leg grew well, and i
as strong as ever ; but by nursing it so long it grew ;
tame, and fed upon the little green at my door, and f
would not go away. This was the first time that I
entertained a thought of breeding up some tame
creatures, that I might have food when my powder '
and shot was all spent.

December 28, PS9, 30. Great heats and no breeze; ;
so that there was no stirring abroad, except in the '
evening for food. This time I spent in putting all 1"
my things in order within doors.

January 1. Very hot still; but I went abroad,
early and late. with my gun, and lay still in the
middle of the day. This evening, going farther into
the valleys. which lay to the centre of the island,
I found there was plenty of goats, though exceed- I
ing shy, and hard to come at: however, I reSOIved I
to try if I could not bring my dog to hunt them a
down.

JanuaryQ. Accordingly, the next day, I went
out with my dog. and set him upon the goats; but I
was mistaken, for they all faced about upon the dog. ;
and he knew his danger too well, for he would not}
come near them. '

January 3. I began my fence or wall, which,
being still jealous of my being attacked by some.
body, I resolved to make very thick and strong.

[N. B. This wall being described before, I pur-
posely omit what was said In the journal: it is suf
ficient to observe, that l was no less time than from
the 3d of January. to the 14th of April, working,
finishing, and perfecting this wall, though it was no
more than about twenty~four yards in length, being,
a half circle, from one place in the rock, to another
place about eight yards from it, the door of the cave
being in the centre behind it] .

All this time I worked very hard, the rains hin-
dering me many days, nay,sometimes, weeks to-
gether; but I thought I should never be perfectly
secure till this wall was finished: and it is scarce
credible what inexpressible labour every thing was
done with, especially the bringing piles out of the
woods, and driving them into the ground; for I
made them much bigger than I needed to have
done. .

When this wall was finished, and the outside
double fenced, with a turf-wall raised up close to
it, I persuaded myself, that if any people were to
come on shore there, they would not perceive any
thing like a habitation: and it was very well I did
80, as may be observed hereafter, upon a very re-
markable occasion.

During this time, I made my rounds in the woods
for game every day,when the rain admitted me, and
made frequent discoveries in these walks of some.>>
thing or other to my advantage; particularly I
found a kind of wild' pigeons, which build not as
wood-pigeons in a tree, but rather as house pigeons,
m the holes of the rocks: and taking some young
ones, I endeavoured to breed them up tame, and
did so; but when they grew older, they flew all
away, which perhaps was at first for want of feeding
them, for I had nothing to give them: however, I
frequently found their nests, and got their young
ones, which were very good meat. .

And now, in the managing my household affairs, I
found myself wanting in many things, which I
lilIOUght atfirst it was impossible for me to make, as
Indeed as to some of them it was: for instance, I
could never make a cash to be hooped. I had a
small runlet or two, as I observed before, butI
could never arrive to the capacity of making one by

them, though I spent many weeks about it; Icould .
neither put in the heads, 'or join the staves so true 5

to one another, as to make them hold water; so I
gave that also over.

In the next place, I was at a great loss for can-
dies; so that as soon as it was dark, which was ge-
nerally by seven o'clock, I was obliged to go .to bed.

I remembered the' lump of bees-wax, with which I 3
made candles in my African adventure; but I had '

none of that now: the only remedy I had, was, that
when I had killed a goat, I saved the tallow, and
with a little dish made of clay, which I baked in
the sun, to which I added a wick of some oakum,

I inade me a lamp: and this gave me light, though '

not a clear steady light, like a candle. In the. mid- .
die of all my labours it happened, that, rummag- a
'ing my things, I found a little bag, which, asI L

hinted before, had been filled with corn, for the
feeding of poultry, not for this voyage, but before,
as I suppose, when the ship came from Lisbon:
what little remainder of corn had been in the bag,
was all devoured by the rats, and I saw nothing in
the bag but husks and dust; and being willing to
have the bag for some other use (I think it was to
put powder in, when I divided it for fear of the
lightning, or some such use), I shook the husks of
corn out of it, on one side of my fortification, under
the rock. '

It was a little before the great rains, just now
mentioned, that I threw this stuff away, taking no
notice of any thing, and not so much as remember-
ing that I had thrown any thing there; when, about
a month after, or thereabouts, I saw some few stalks

of something green shooting up on the ground"

which I fancied might be some plant I had not
seen; but I was surprised, and perfectly astonished.

when, after a little longer time, I saw about ten or j

i\<<h'ai

ROBINSON CRUSO E. 81

twelve ears come out, which were perfect green bar-
ley, of the same kind as our European, nay, as our
English barley.

It is impossible to express the astonishment and
confusion of my thoughts on this occasion: I had
hitherto acted upon no religious foundation at all 5
indeed I had very few notions of religion in my
head, nor had entertained any sense of any thing
that had befallen me, otherwise than as a chance,
or, as we lightly Say, what pleases God; without so
much as inquiring into the end of Providence in
these things, or his order in governing events in
the world: but, after I saw barley grow there, in a
climate which I knew was not proper for corn, and
eSpecially that I knew not how it came there, it
startled me strangely, and I began to suggest, that
God had miraculously caused this grain to grow,
without any help of seed sown, and that it was so
directed purely for my sustenance in that wild mi-
serable place.

This touched my heart a little, and brought tears
out of my eyes, and I began to bless myself, that
such a prodigy of nature should happen upon my
account; and this .was the more strange to me, be.
cause I saw near it still, all along by the side of the-
rock, some other straggling stalks, which proved to
be stalks of rice, and which _I knew, because I had
seen it grow in Africa, when I was ashore there.

1 not only thought these the pure productions of
Providence for my support; but, not doubting but
that there was more in the place, I went all over
that part of the island where I had been before,
peering in every corner, and under every rock, to
see for more of it; but I could not find any: at last
it occurred to my thoughts, that I had shaken the
bag of chickcn's meat out in that place; and then the
wonder began to cease; and I must confess, my re-
ligious thankfulness to God's providence began to
abate too, upon the discovering that all this was
nothing but what was common, though I ought to-

E 2
have been as thankful for so strange and unforeseen
providence, as if it had been miraculous; for it was

really the work of Providence as to me, that should i

order or appoint, that ten or twelve grains of corn

should remain unspoiled (when the rats had de- "

stroyed all the rest), as if it had been dropped from
heaven: as also that I should throw it out in that
particular place, where, it being in the shade of a
high rock, it sprang up immediately; whereas, if I
had thrown it any where else, at that time, it had
been burnt up and destroyed.

I carefully saved the ears of this corn, you may be
sure, in their season, which was about the end of
June 5 and laying up every com, I resolved to sow
them all again, hoping in time to have some quantity
sufficient to supply me with bread: but it was not
till the fourth year that I would allow myself the
least grain of this corn to eat, and even then but
sparingly, as I shall say afterwards in its order; for

I lost all that I sowed the first season, by not ob- f-
serving the proper time, for I sowed just before '

the dry season, so that it never came up at all, at

leastnot as it would have done: of which, in its

place.

Besides this barley, there were, as above, twenty i

or thirty stalks of rice, which I preserved with the

same care, and whose use was of the same kind, or .

to the same purpose; viz. to make me bread, or
rather food; for I found ways to cook it up without
baking, though I did that also, after some time. But
to return to my journal.

I worked excessive hard these three or four
months, to get my wall done; and, the 14th of
April, I closed it up, contriving'to go into it, not
by a door, but over the wall, by aladder, that there
might be no sign on the outside of my habitation.

April 16. I finished the ladder: so I went up
with the ladder to the top, and then pulled it up
after me, and let it down on the inside. This was

a complete enclosure to me ; for within I had :room .

j

l
enough, and nothing could come at me from with-
out, unless it could first mount my wall.

The very next day after this wall was finished, I
had almost had all my labour overthrown at once,
and myself killed. The case was thus: as I was
busy in the inside of it, behind my tent, just in the
entrance into my cave. I was terribly frighted with
a most dreadful surprising thing indeed; for, all on
a sudden, I found the earth came tumbling down
from the roof of my cave, and from the edge of the
hill, over my head, and two of the posts I had set
up in the cave. cracked in a frightful manner. I was
heartily scared, but thought nothing of what really
was the cause; only thinking that the top of my
cave was falling in, as some of it had .done before,
and, for fear I should be buried in it, I ran forwards
to my ladder; and, not thinking myself safe there
neither, I got over my wall, for fear of the pieces of
the hill, which I expected might roll down upon
me. I was no sooner stepped down upon the'firm
ground, but 1 plainly saw it was a terrible earth-
quake; for the ground I stood on shook three
times, at about eight minutes distance, with three
such shocks as would have overturned the strongest
building that could be supposed to have stood upon
the earth; and a great piece of the top of a rock,
which stood about half a mile from me next the sea,
fell down with such a terrible noise, as I never
heard in all my life. I perceived also the very sea
was put into a violent motion by it; and, i believe,
the shocks were stronger under the water than on-
the island. -

I was so amazed with the thing itself, having never
felt the like, or discoursed with any one that had,
that I was like one dead or stupified; and the mo-
tion of the earth made my Stomach sick. like one
that was tossed at sea; but the noise of the falling
of the rock awaked me, as it were, and. rousing me
from the stupified condition I was in, filled me 'with
horror, and I thought of nothing then but the hill
falling upon my tent, and all my household goods,
and burying all at once; and this sunk my very soul
within me a second time. >

After the third shock was over, and I felt no more
for some time, I began to take courage; and yet I
had not heart enough to get over my wall again, for
fear of being buried alive; but still sat upon the
ground, greatly hast down, and disconsolate, not
knowing what to do. All this while, I had not the
least serious religious thought, nothing but the com-
mon ' Lord, have mercy upon me !' and when it was
over, that went away too.

While I sat thus, I found the air overcast, and it
grew cloudy, as ifit would rain; and, in less than
half an hour, it blew a most dreadful hurricane of
wind. The sea was all on a sudden covered with
foam and froth, the shore was covered with the
breach of the water, the trees were torn up by the
roots, and a terrible storm it was; and this held
about three hours, and then began to abate; and
then in two hours more it was calm, and began to
rain very hard.

All this while, I sat upon the ground, very much
terrified and dejected ; when, on a sudden, it came
into my thoughts, that these winds and rain, being
the consequence of the earthquake, the earthquake
itself was spent and over, and I might venture into
my cave again. With this thought my spirits began
to revive, and the rain helping also to persuade me,
I went in, and sat me down in my tent; but the
rain was so violent, that my tent was ready to be
beaten down with it, and I was forced to go into
my cave, though very much afraid and uneasy, for
fear it should fall on my head.

This violent rain forced me to a new work, viz. to
cut a hole through my new fortification, like a sink,
to let the water go out, which would else have
drowned my cave. After [had been in my cave
some time, and found still no more shocks of the
earthquake follow, I began to be more composed:

l
i

'_v-4--.-.__ .,
o
.' _
and now, to support my spirits, which indeed wanted
it very much, I went to my little store, and took a
small sup of rum, which, however, I did then, and
always, very sparingly, knowing I could have no
more, when that was gone.

It continued raining all that night, and great part
of the next day, so that I could not stir abroad;
but, my mind being more composed, I began to
think of what I had best do; concluding that if
the island was subject to these earthquakes, there
would be no living for me in a cave, but I must con-
sider of building me some little hut, in an open
place, which I might surround with a wall, as I had
done here, and so make myself secure from wild
beasts or men; but concluded, if I staid where I'
was, I should certainly,one time or other, be buried
alive.

With these thoughts, I resolved to move my tent
from the place where it stood,which was just under
the hanging precipice of the hill, and which, if it
should be. shaken again, would certainly fall upon
my tent. And I spent the two next days, being the
19th and 20th of April, in contriving where and how
to remove my habitation.

I' he fear of being swallowed up alive, made me
that I never slept in quiet, and yet the apprehen-
sion of lying abroad, without any fence, was almost
equal to it: but still, when I looked about, and saw
how every thing was put in order, how pleasantly
concealed I was, and how safe from danger, it made
me very loath to remove.

In the mean time it occurred to me, that it would
require a vast deal of time for me to do this, and
that I must be contented to run the venture where
I was, till I had formed a camp for myself, and had
secured it so as to remove to it. So, with this reso-
lution, I composed myself for a time. and resolved
that 1 would go to work, With all speed. to build me
a wall, with piles and cables, &c. in a circle, as be-
fore, and set my tent up in it, when it was finished ;~r',.. 'w'.I-'\" "w uq.' . ly'V-lftlv", w-r-evv--QW

but that I would venture to stay where I was, till
it was finished, and fit to remove to. This was
the 215t.

April 22. The next morning I began to consider
of means to put this resolve in execution; but!

was at a great loss about my tools. 1 had three ,

large axes, and abundance of hatchets (for we car-
ried the hatchets for traffic with the lndians); but,
with much chopping and cutting knotty hard wood,
they were all full of notches, and dull; and though
I had a grindstone, I could not turn it, and grind
my tools too. This cost me as much thought as a
statesman would have. bestowed upon a grand point
of politics, or a judge upon the life and death of a
man. At length, I contrived a wheel, with astring,
to turn it with my foot, that I might have both my
hands at liberty. Note, I had not seen any such
thing in England, or at least not to take notice how
it was done, though since I have observed, it is very
common there; besides that, my grindstone was
very large and heavy. This machine cost me a full
week's work, to bring it to perfection.

April 28,29. These two whole days I took up in
grinding my tools; my machine for turning my
grindstone performing very well.

April 30. Having perceived my bread had been
low a great while, i now took a survey ofit, and re-
duced myself to one biscuit cake a day, which made
my heart very heavy. .

May 1. In the morning, looking towards the sea~
side, the tide being low, 1 saw something lie on the
shore, bigger than ordinary, and it looked like a
cask; when 1 came to it, I found asmall barrel,and
two or three pieces of the wreck of the ship, which
were' driven on shore by the late hurricane; and,
looking towards- the wreck itself, I thought it
seemed to lie higher out of the water than it used
to do. I examined the barrel which was driven on
shore, and soon found it was a barrel of gunpowder,
but it had taken water, and the powder was caked

as hard as a stone ; however, I rolled it farther on
'shore for the present, and went on upon the sands,
as near as I could to the wreck of the ship to look
for more.

When I came down to the ship, I found it
strangely removed: the forecastle, which lay before
buried in the sand,was heaved up at least six feet;
and the stern, which was broken to pieces, and
parted from the rest by the force of the sea, soon
after I had left rummaging of her, was tossed, as it
were, up, and cast on one side; and the sand was
thrown so high on that side next the stern, that
whereas there was a great place of water before, so
that I could not come within a quarter of a mile of
the wreck without swimming, I could now walk
quite up to her when the tide was out. I was sur.
prised with this at first, but soon concluded it must
be done by the earthquake; and as by this violence
the ship was more broken open than formerly, so
many things came daily on shore, which the sea
had loosened, and which the winds and water rolled
by degrees to the land. '

This wholly diverted my thoughts from the de-
sign of removing" my habitation; and I busied my-
self mightily, that day especially, in searching whe-
ther I could make any way into the ship; but I
found nothing was to be expected of that kind, for
that all the inside of the ship was choaked up with
sand. However, as I had learnt not to despair of
any thing, I resolved to pull every thing to pieces
that I could of the ship, concluding that every
thing I could get from her would be of some use or
other to me.

May 3. I began with my saw,'and cut a piece
of a beam through, which I thought held some of
the upper part, or quarter-deck, together; and when
I had cut it through, I cleared away the sand as well
as I could, from the side which lay highest: but the

tide coming in, I was obliged to give over for that
time.
May 4:. I went a fishing,.but caught not one fish 3 i
that 1 Adurst eat of, till I was weary of my sport, j

when,just going to leave oil", I caught a young dol-
phin. 1 had made me a long line of some rope-

yarn, but I had no hooks; yet I frequently caught _
fish enough, as much as I cared to eat; all which I '

dried in the sun, and eat them dry.

May 5. Worked on the wreck, cut another beam
asunder, and brought three great fir-planks off from
the decks, which I tied together, and made swim on
shore, when the tide of flood came on.

May 6. Worked on the wreck, got several iron

bolts out of her, and other pieces of iron-work; -

worked very hard, and came home very much tired,
and had thoughts of giving it over.

May 7. Went to the wreck again, but with an
intent not to- work; but found the weight of the
wreck had broken itself down, the beams being cut,
that several pieces of the ship seemed to lie loose,
and the inside of the hold lay so Open, that I could
see into it; but almost full of water and sand.

May 8. Went to the wreck, and carried an iron
crow to wrench up the deck, which lay now quite
clear of the water or sand. I wrenched open two
planks, and brought them on shore also with the
tide. I left the iron crow in the wreck for next
day.

May 9. Went tothe wreck, and, with the crow.
made way into the body of the wreck, and felt
several easks, and loosened them with the crew;
but could not break them up. I felt also the roll

of English lead, and could stir it; but it was too _

heavy to move.

May 10, 11,12, 13, 14. Went every day to the '

wreck, and got a great deal of pieces of timber, and
boards, or planks, and two or three hundred weight
of iron. -

May 15. I carried two hatchets, to try if I could
not cut a piece of? the roll of lead, by placing the
edge of one hatchet, and driving it with the other;
but as it lay about a foot and a half in the water, I
could not make any blow to drive the hatchet.

May 16. It had blowed hard in the night, and
the wreck appeared more broken by the force of the
water; but I staid so long in the woods, to get
pigeons for food, that the tide prevented me going
to the wreck that day. -

May 17. 1 saw some pieces of the wreck blown
on shore, at a great distance, two miles of? me} but
resolved to see what they were, and found it was a
piece of the head; but too heavy for me to bring
away. ' - -

May 24-. Every day, to this day, I worked on
the wreck, and, with hard labour, I loosened some
things so much with the crow, that, the first flow-
ing tide, several casks floated out, and two of the
seamen's chests; but the wind blowing from the
shore, nothing came to land that day, but pieces
of timber, and a hogshead which had some Brasil
pork in it; but the salt water and the sand had
spoiled it.

I continued this work every day to the 15th of
J une, except the time necessary to get food, which
I always appointed, during this part of my employ-
ment, to be when the tide was up. that 1 might be
ready when it was ebbed out: and, by this time, I
had gotten timber and plank. and iron-work enough
to have built a good boat, if 1 had known how; and
also I got at several times, and in several pieces,
near one hundred weight of the sheet-lead.

June 16. Going down to the sea-side, I found a
large tortoise or turtle; this Was the first I had seen,
which, it seems, was only my misfortune, not any
defect of the place, or scarcity; for, had I happened
to be on the other side of the island, I might have
had hundreds of them every day, as I found after-
wards; but',' perhaps, had paid dear enough for
them.

_ June 17. I spent in cooking the turtle. I found
In her threescore eggs: and her flesh was to me at
that time the most savoury and pleasant that ever I
tasted in my life, having had no flesh but of goats
and fowls, since. I landed in this horrible place.

June 18. .Rained all the day, and I staid within.
I thought, at this time, the rain felt cold, and I was
something chilly, which i knew was not usual in that
latitude.

June 19. Very ill, and shivering, as if the wea-
ther had been cold. '
June 20. No rest all night, violent pains in my

head, and feverish.

June 9.1. Very ill, frighted almost to death with
the apprehensions of my sad condition, to be Sick,
and no help. Prayed to God, for the first time
since the storm ofl" Hull; but scarce knew what!
said, or why: my thoughts being all confused.

June 22. A little better; but under dreadful ap-
prehensions of sickness. '

J une 23. Very bad again, cold and shivering, and
then a violent head-ach.

June 24. Much better. I

June 25. .An agne very violent; the lit held me 1
seven hours, cold fit and hot, with faint sweats
after it.

June 96. Better; and having no victuals to eat,
took my gun,but found myself very weak: however
I killed a she-goat. and, with much difficulty, got -
it home, and broiled some of it, and eat: I would
fain have stewed it, and made some broth, but had
no pot.

June 27. The ague again so violent, that I lay
abed all day, and neither eat nor drank. I was
ready .to perish for thirst; but so weak, I had not
strength to stand up, or to get myself any water to
drink: prayed to God again, but was light~headed3
and when I was not, I was so ignorant, that I knew i
not what to say; only I lay, and cried, ' Lord, look 2
upon me! Lord, pity me! Lord, have mercy upon
me! ' -I suppose I did nothing else for two or three
hours, till the fit. wearing olf, I fell asleep, and did
not awake till far in the night. When I awaked, I
found myself much refreshed, but weak, and exceed-
ingly thirsty: however, as I had no water in my
whole habitation, I was forced to lie till morning,
and went to SleEp again. In this second sleep, I had
this terrible dream:

I thought that I was sitting on the ground, on the
outside of my wall, where I sat when the storm blew
after the earthquake, and that I saw a man descend

' from a great black cloud, in a bright flame of fire,

and light upon the ground. He was all over as
bright as a flame, so that I could but just bear to
look towards him: his countenance was most in-

. cxpressibly dreadful, impossible for words to de-

scribe: when he stepped upon the ground with his
feet.I thought the earth trembled, just as it had
done before in the earthquake; and all the air
looked, to my apprehension, as if it had been filled
with flashes of fire.

He Was no sooner landed upon the earth, but he
moved forward towards me, with a. long spear or
weapon in his hand, to kill me; and when he came
to a rising ground, at some distance, he spoke to me,
or I heard a voice so terrible, that it is impossible to
express the terror of it; all that 1 can say I under-
stood was this: ' Seeing all these things have not
brought thee to repentance, now thou shalt die.'
At which words, I thoughthe lifted up the spear that
Was in his hand, to kill me.

No One that shall ever read this account, will ex-
pect that I should be able to describe the horrors of -
my soul at this terrible vision; I mean, that even
While it was a dream, I even dreamed of those hor-
rors: nor is it any more possible to describe the
impression that remained upon my mind, when I
awaked. and found it was but a dream.

I had, alas! no Divine knowledge: what I had
received by the good instruction of my father, was
then worn out by an uninterrupted series, for eight
years, of seafaring wickedness, and a constant con-' _'l'"|"' "v V'-

versation with none but such as were like myself.
wicked and profane to the last degree. I do not
remember that I had, in all that time, one thought
that so much as tended either to. looking upwards
toward God, or inwards toward a reflection upon
my own ways; but a certain stupidity of soul, with
out desire of good, or conscience of evil, had entirely
overwhelmed me, and 1 was all that the most har
dened.untl1inking, wicked creature among our coma

-mon sailors can be supposed to be, not having thei

least sense either of the fear of God in daugeis, or!
of thankfulness to God' 1n deliverances. ' i

In the relating what' is already past of my story!
this will he the more easily believed, when i shalll
add, that, through all the variety of miseries that
had to this day befallen me, I never had so much as
one thought of its being the hand of God, or that it
was a just punishment for my sin, my rebellious be-
haviour against my father, or my present sins, which
were great; or so much as a punishment for thei
general course of my wicked life. When I was on'
the desperate expedition, on the desert shores of .
Africa, I never had so much as one thought of whale
would become of me, or one wish to God to direct
me whither I should go, or to keep me from the
danger which apparently surrounded me, as well
from voracious creatures as cruel savages ; but I was
merely thoughtless of God, or a Providence: I acted!

 

like a mere brute, from the principles of nature, and' -

by the dictates of common sense only ; and indeed
hardly that.

When I was delivered and taken up at sea by the.
Portugal captain, well used, and dealt justly and:
honourabl y with, as well as charitably, I had not the;
least thankfulness in my' thoughts: when againl;
was shipwrecked, ruined, and in danger of drown-
ing on this island, 1 was as far from remorse, or
looking on it as a judgment: I only said to myself
often, that I was an unfortunate dog, and born to
be always miserable.It is true, when I got on shore first here, and

'found all my ship's crew drowned, and myself

spared, I was surprised with a kind of ecstasy and
some transports of soul, which, had the grace of
God assisted, might have come up to true thankful-
ness ; but it ended where it began, in a mere com-
mon flight of joy, or, as I may say, being glad I was

' alive, without the least reflection upon the distin-

guishing goodness of the Hand which had preserved
me, and had singled me out to be preserved, when

'A all the rest were destroyed; or an inquiry why Pro-

vidence had been thus merciful to me; even just
the same common sort of joy which seamen gene-
rally have, after they have got safe ashore from a
shipwreck, which they drown all in the next bowl
of punch, and forget almost as soon as it is over;
and all the rest of my life was like it.

Even when I was afterwards, on due considera-
tion, made sensible of my condition, how I was cast
on this dreadful place, out of the reach of human
kind, out of all hope of relief, or prospect of re-
demption, as soon as I saw a probability of living,
and that I should not starve and perish for hunger,
all the sense of my affliction were off, and I began
to be very easy, applied myself to the works proper
for my preservation and supply, and was far enough

' from being afflicted at my condition, as a judgment

from heaven, or as the hand of God against me:

these were thoughts which very seldom entered into
my head.

. The growing up of the corn, as is hinted in my
Journal, had at first some little influence upon me,
and began to affect me with seriousness, as long asI
thought it had something miraculous in it; but as
soon as ever that part of the thought was removed,
all the impression which was raised from it, wore
off also, as I have noted already.

Even the earthquake, though nothing could be
more terrible in its nature, or more immediately di-
recting to the invisible Power which alone directs.ing to God, though I cannot say they were either a

.the mere apprehensions; and in these hurries of my

.siclt, I shall certainly die for want of help; and

such things, yet no sooner was the first fright over.
but the impression it had made went off also. I had
no more sense of God, or his judgments, much less
of the present affliction of my circumstances being
from his hand, than if i had been in the most pro-
sperous condition of life.

But now when I began to be sick, and a leisurely
view of'the miseries of death came to place itself be-
fore me; when my spirits began to sink under the
burden of a strong distemper, and nature was ex'
hausted with the violence of the fever ; conscience,
that had slept so long, began to awake, and I began
to reproach myself with my past life, in which I had
so evidently, by uncommon wickedness, provoked
the justice 'of God to lay me under uncommon
strokes, and to deal with me in so vindictive a
manner. '

These reflections oppressed me from the second
or third day of my distemper-,and in the violence, as
well of the fever as of the dreadul reproaches of my
conscience, extorted some words from me, like pray-

prayer attended with desires, or with hopes; it was
rather the voice of mere fright and distress: my
thoughts were confused, the convictions great upon
my mind, and the horror of dying in such a miser-
able dc'tidition, raised vapours into my head, with

soul, I knew not what my tongue might express:
but it was rather exclamation, such as, ' Lord,
what a miserable creature am I! If I should be

what will become of me!' Then the tears burst
out of my eyes, and I could say no more for a
good while.

In this [inter-val, the good advice-of my father came

 

to my mind, and presently his prediction, which I

mentioned at the beginning of this'story; viz. That,
if I did take this foolish step, God would not bless
me, and I would have leisure hereafter to reflect

I
upon having neglected his counsel, when there might
be none to assist me in my recovery. ' 'Now,' said
I, aloud, ' my dear father's words are come to pass:
God's justice has overtaken me, and I have none to
help or hear me. I rejected the voice of Provi-
dence,which had mercifully put me in a posture or
station of life wherein I-might have been happy and
easy; but I would neither see it myself, nor learn
to know the blessing of it from my parents: I left
them to mourn over my folly, and now I am left
to mourn unde1 the consequences of it. I refused
their help and assistance, who would have lifted me
into the world, and would have made every thing
easy to me; and now I have difficulties to struggle
with, too great for even nature itself to support,
and no assistance, no help, no comfort, no advice.'
Then I cried out, ' Lord, be my help, for I am in
great distress!'

This was the first prayer, if I might call it so, that
I had made for many years. But I return to my
journal.

June 928. Having been somewhat refreshed with
the sleep I had had, and the fit being entirely off, I
got up; and though the fright and terror of my
dream was very great, yet I considered, that the fit
of the ague would return again the next day ; and
now was my time to get something to refresh and
support myself when I should be ill: and the first
thing I did, I filled a large square case bottle with
water, and set it upon my table, 1n reach of my bed,
and, to takeoff the chill or agueish disposition of the
water, I put about a quarter of a pint of rum into
it, and mixed them together; then i got me a piece
of the goat's flesh, and broiled it on the coals, but
could eat very little; 1 Walked about, but was very
weak, and withal, very sad and heavy-hearted in
the sense of my miserable condition, dreading the
return of my distemper the next day: at night I
made my supper of tlnee of the turtle' 5 eggs, which
I roasted' 1n the ashes, and eat, as we call it, in the
shell; and this was the first bit of meat I had ever
asked God's blessing to, even, as I could remember,
in my whole life.

After I had eaten, I tried to walk; but found my-
self so weak, that I could hardly carry the gun (for a
I never went out without that); so I went but a little
way, and sat down upon the ground, looking out
upon the sea, which was just before me, and very
calm and smooth. As I set here, some such thoughts
as these occurred to me.

What is this earth and sea, of which I have seen
so much? Whence is it produced? And what am I,
and all the other creatures, wild and tame, human
and brutal, whence are we?

Sure we are all made by some secret power, who
formed the earth and sea, the air'aud sky: and who
is that?

Then it followed most naturally: It is God that
has made it all. Well, but then it came on strongly:
If God has made all these things, he guides and
governs them all, and all things that concern them;
for the Being that could make all things, must cer-
tainly have power to guide and direct them.

If so, nothing can happen in the great circuit of
his works, either without his knowledge or appoint-
ment. .

And if nothing happens without his knowledge.
he knows that! am here, and am in this dreadful
condition; and if nothing happens without his ap'
pointment, he has appointed all this to befall me.

Nothing occurred to my thoughts to contradict
any of these conclusions; and therefore it rested
upon me with the greater force, that it must needs
be, that God has appointed all this to befall me; that
I was brought to this miserable circumstance by his
direction, he having the sole power, not of me only.
but of every thing that happened in the world.
Immediately it followed,

Why has God done this to me? What have I done-
to be thus used?
My conscience presently checked me in that in-
quiry, as if I had blasphemed ; and, methought, it
Spoke to me like a voice, Wretch! dost thou ask
what thou hast done? Look back upon a dreadful
miSpent life, and ask thyself what thou hast not
done? Ask, Why is it that thou wert not long ago
destroyed? Why wert thou not drowned in Yar-
mouth roads? killed in the fight, when the ship
was taken by the Sallee man of war? devoured by
wild beasts on the coast of Africa? or, drowned
here, when all the crew perished but thyself? Dost
thou ask, What have I done?

I was struck dumb with these reflections, as one
astonished, and had not a word to say, no, not to
answer to myself; but rose up, pensive and sad,
walked back to my retreat, and went up over my
wall, as if I had been going to bed; but my thoughts
were sadly disturbed, and I had no inclination to
sleep; so I sat down in my chair, and lighted my
lamp, for it began to be dark. Now, as the appro-
hensions of the return of my distemper terrified me
very much, it occurred to my thought that the Bra-
silians take no physic but their tobacco, for almost
all distempers; and I had a piece of a roll of tobacco
in one of the chests, which was quite cured, and
some also that was green, and not quite cured.

I went, directed by Heaven, no doubt; for in this
chest I found a cure both for soul and body. I
Opened the chest, and found what I looked for, viz.
the tobacco; and as the few books I had saved lay
there too, I took out one of the Bibles which I
mentioned before, and which, to this time. I had not
found leisure, or so much as inclination, to look
into: I say I took it out, and brought both that and
the tobacco with me to the table.

What use to make of the tobacco I knew not, as to
my distemper, or whether it was good for me or no;
but I tried several experiments with it, as if I was
resolved it should hit one way or other. I first took
a piece of a leaf, and chewed it in my mouth,which

I"
indeed, at first, almost stupified my brain; the to- '
bacco being green and strong, and that I had not
been much used to it: then I took some, and steeped '
it an hour or two in rum, and resolved to take a
dose of it when I lay down; and, lastly, 1 burnt
some upon a pan of coals, and held my nose close
over the smoke of it, as long as I could bear it, as
well for the heat as the virtue of it, and 1 held it
almost to suffocation.

In the interval of this operation, I took up the
Bible, and began to read; but my head was too
much disturbed with the tobacco to bear reading,
at least at that time: only, having opened the book
casually, the first words that occurred to me were
these, ' Call on me in the day of trouble, and I will
deliver, and thou shalt glorify me.'

The words were very apt to my case, and made
some impression upon my thoughts at the time of
reading them, though not so much as they did after-
wards; for, as for being delivered, the word had no
sound, as I may say, to me; the thing was so re.
mote, so impossible in my apprehension of things,
that I began to say as the children of Israel did.
when they were promised flesh to eat, ' Can God
spread a table in the wilderness." So I began to
say, Can God himself deliver me from this place?
And as it was not for many years that any hope ap
peared, this prevailed very often upon my thoughts.
But, however, the words made a great impression
upon me, and I mused upon them very often. It
grew now late, and, the tobacco had, as I said,
dozed my head so much, that I inclined to sleep;
so I left my lamp burning in the cave, lest I should
want any thing in the night, and went to bed: but
before I lay down, I did what -I never had done in
all my life, I kneeled down, and prayed to God to
fulfil the promise to me, that, if I called upon him in
the day of trouble, he would deliver me. After my
broken and imperfect prayer was over, I drank the >>
rum in which 1 had steeped the tobacco, which was
so strong and rank of the tobacco, that indeed I
could scarce get it down. Immediately upon this
1 went to bed, and I found presently it flew up into
my head violently; but I fell into a sound sleep,
and waked no more, till, by the sun, it must neces-
sarily be near three o'clock in the afternoon, the next
day: nay, to this hour, 1 am partly of the opinion
that I slept all the next day and night, and till
almost three the day after; for otherwise I knew
not how I should lose a day out of my reckoning in
the days of the week, as it appeared some years after
I had done; for if I had lost it by crossing and re-
crossing the line, I should have lost more than one
day; but certainly, I lost a day in my account, and
I never knew which way.

Be that, however, one way or other, when I
awaked'I found myself exceedingly refreshed, and
my spirits lively and cheerful. When I got up, I
was stronger than I was the day before, and my
stomach better; for I was hungry, and, in short, I
had no fit the next day, but continued much altered
for the better. This was the 29th.

The 30th was my well day, of course, and I went
abroad with my gun, but did not care to travel too
far. I killed a sea-fowl or two, something like a
brand-goose, and brought them home. but was not
very forward to eat them; so I eat some more of
the turtle's eggs, which were very good. This even-
ing I renewed the medicine, which I had supposed
did me good the day before, viz. the tobacco steeped
in rum, only I did not take so much as before, nor
didI chew any of the leaf, or hold my head over the
smoke. However, I was not so well the next day,
Which was the lst of July, as I hoped I should have
been; for I had a. little spice of the cold- fit, but it
was not much.

July 2. I renewed the medicine all the three
ways, and 'dosed myself with it as at first, and
doubled the quantity which I drank.

July 3. I missed the fit for good and all, though
I did not recover my full strength for some weeks
after. While I was thus gathering strength, my
thoughts ran exceedingly upon this Scripture, ' I
will deliver thee ;' and the impossibility of my de.
liverance lay much upon my mind, in barofmy ever
expecting it. But as I was discouraging myself
with such thoughts, it occurred to my mind, that I
pored so much upon my deliverance from the main
affliction, that I disregarded the deliverance I had
received; and 1 was, as it were, made to ask my-
self such questions as these: viz. Have I not been
delivered, and wonderfully too, from sickness; from
the most distressed condition that could be, and-
that was so frightful to me? And what notice had
I taken of it? Had I done my part? God had
delivered me: but I had not glorified him; that is
to say, I had not owned and beenthankful for that
as a deliverance; and how could I expect greater
deliverance?

This touched my heart very much, and imme-
diately I kneeled down,and gave God thanks aloud,
for my recovery from sickness.

July 4. In the morning, I took the Bible; and,
beginning at the New Testament, I began seriously
to read it, and imposed upon myself to read a while
every morning and every night, not tying myself to
a number of chapters, but as long as my thoughts
should engage me. It was not long after I set
seriously to this work. but I found my heart more
deeply and sincerely affected with the wickedness of
my past life. The impression of my dream revived,
and the words, ' All these things have not brought
thee to repentance,' ran seriously in my thoughts. I
was earnestly begging of God to give me repent-
ance, when it happened providentially, the very
day, that, reading the Scripture, I came to these
words, ' He is exalted a Prince, and a Saviour, to
give repentance, and to give remission.' I threw
down the hook, and, with my heart as well as my
hands lifted up to Heaven, in a kind of ecstacy of
joy, I cried out aloud, ' Jesus, thou Son of David,
Jesus, thou exalted Prince and Saviour, give me re-
pentance!'

This was the first time that I could say, in the
true sense of the word, that I prayed in all my
life; for now I prayed with a sense of my con-
dition, and with a true Scripture view of hope,
founded on the encouragement of the word of God;
and from this time, I may say,I began to have hope
that God would hear me.

Now I began to construe the words mentioned
above, ' Call on me, and I will deliver you,' in a
different sense from what I had ever done before;
for then I had no notion of any thing being called
deliverance, but my being delivered from the cap~
tivity I was in ; for though I was indeed at large in
the place, yet the island was certain] y a prison to
111e, and that in the worst sense in the world; but
now I learned to take it in another sense. Now, I
looked back upon my past life with such horror, and
my sins appeared so dreadful, that my soul sought
nothing of God but deliverance from the load of
guilt that bore down all my comfort. As for my
solitary life, it was nothing; I did not so much as
Play to be delivered from it, or think of it': it was
all of no consideration in comparison of this; and
I add this part here, to hint to whoever shall
read it, that whenever they come to a true sense
0f things, they will find deliverance from sin a
much greater blessing, than deliverance from afflic-
tion.

But, leaving this part, I return to my journal.

My condition began now to be, though not less
miserable as to my way of li\ing, yet much easier
to my mind; and my thoughts being directed, by a.
constant reading the (Scripture, and praying to God,
t0 things of higher nature. I had a great deal of
comfo1t within, which till now I knew nothing of.
A150, as my health and strength 1etu1ned,]' he~
Stirred myself to furnish myself with 8V8! y thing

i.
that I wanted, and make my way of living as regu-
lar as I could.

From the 4th of July to the 14th, I was chiefly
employed in walking about with my gun in my
hand, a little and a little at a time, as a man that
was gathering up'his strength after a fit of sickness:
for it is hardly to be imagined how low I was, and
to what weakness I was reduced. The application
which I made use of was perfectly new, and per-
haps what had never cured an ague before; neither
can I recommend it to any one to practise, by this
experiment; and though it did carry off the fit, yet
it rather contributed to weaken me: for I had fre-
quent convulsions in my nerves and limbs for some
time.

I learnt from it also this in particular, that being
abroad in the rainy season was the most pernicious
thing to my health that could be, especially in those
rains which came attended with storms and hurri-
canes of wind; for as the rain which came in a dry
season, was always most accompanied with such
storms, so I found this rain was much more danger-
ous than the rain which fell in September and
October.

I had been now in this unhappy island above ten
months: all possibility of deliverance from this con.
(lition seemed to be entirely taken from me; andI
firmly believed that no human shape had ever set
foot upon that place. Having now secured my
habitation, as I thought, fully to my mind, I had a
great desire to make a more perfect discovery of the
island, and to see what other productions I might
find, which yet I knew nothing of.

It was the 15th of July thatI began to take a
more particular survey of the island itself. I went
up the creek first, where, as I hinted, I brought my
rafts on shore. I found, after I came about two
miles up, that the tide did not flow any higher, and
that it was no more than a. little brook of running
water, and very fresh and good ; but this being the
dry season, there was hardly any water in some
parts of it, at least not enough to run in any stream,
so as it could be perceived.

0n the bank of this brook, I found many pleasant
savannas or meadows, plain, smooth, and covered
with grass; and, on the rising p'u ts of them, next
to the higher grounds, where the vatcr, as it might
be supposed, never overflowed, I found a great deal
of tobacco, green, and growing to a great and very
strong stalk. There were'divers other plants, which
I had no notion of. or understanding about; and
might, perhaps, have virtues of their own, which I
could not find out.

I searched for the Cassava root, which the In-
dians, in all that climate, make their bread of; but
I could find none. I saw large plants of aloes, but
did not then understand them. 1 saw several
sugar-canes, but wild, and, for want of cultivation,
imperfect. I contented myself with these discoveries
for this time, and came back, musing with myself
what course I might take to know the virtue and
goodness of any of run fruits or plants which I should
discover,but could bring it to no conclusion; for,in
short, I had made so little observation while I 'was
in the Brasils, that I knew little of the plants of the
field, at least, very little that might serve me to any
purpose now in my distress.

The next day, the 16th, I went up the same way
again; and, after going something farther than I had
gone the day before, I found the brook and the sa-
vannas began to cease,and the country became more
woody than before. In this part I found different
fruits, and particularly I found melons upon the
ground, in great abundance, and grapes upon the
trees: the vines had spread indeed over the trees,
and the clusters of grapes were just now in their
prime, very ripe and rich. This was a surprising
discovery, and I was exceeding glad of them, but
I was warned, by my experience, to eatsparingly of
them, remembering that when I was ashore in Bar-
bary, the eating of grapes killed several of our Eng-
lishmen, who were-slaves there, by throwing them
into fluxes and fevers: but I found an excellent use
for these grapes; and that was to cure or dry them
in the sun, and keep them as dried grapes or raisins
are kept, whiclr I thought would be, as indeed they
were, as wholesome, and as agreeable to eat, when
no grapes might be had.

I spent all that evening there, and went not back
to my habitation, which, by the way, was the first
night, as I might say, I had lain from home. In the
night I took my first contrivance, and got up into a
tree, where I slept well, and the next morning
proceeded upon my discovery, travelling near four
miles, as I mightjudge by the length of the valley,
keeping still due north, with a ridge of hills on the
south and north side of me.

At the end of this march, I came to an opening,
where the country seemed to descend to the west;
and a little Spring of fresh water, which issued out
of the side of the hill by me, ran the other way, that
is, due east: and the country appeared so fresh, so
green, so flourishing, every thing being in a constant
verdurc or flourish of spring, that it looked like a
planted garden.

I descended a little on the side of that delicious
valley, surveying it with a secret kind of pleasure
(though mixed with other afflicting thoughts), to
think that this was all my own; that I Was king
and lord of all this country indefeasibly, and had a
right of possession; and, if I could convey it, I
might have it in inheritance, as completely as any
lord of a manor in England. I saw here abundance
of cocoa-trees, orange and lemon and Citron-trees;
but all wild, and few bearing any fruit, at least not
then. However, the green limes that I gathered
were not-only pleasant to eat, but very wholesome;
and I mixed their juice afterwards with water,
which made it very wholesome, and very cool and
refreshing.
I found'now 1 had business enough to gather
and carry home; and I resolved to lay up a store,
as well of grapes as limes and lemons, to furnish
myself for. the wet season, which I knew was ap-
proaching. . '

In order to this,I gathered a great heap of grapes
in one place, and a lesser heap in another place,
and a great parcel of limes and lemons in another
place; and, taking a few of each with me, I tra-
velled homeward, and resolved to come again, and
bring a bag or sack, or what I could make, to carry
the rest home.

Accordingly, having spent three days in thisjour-
ney, 1 came home (so I must now call my tent, and
my cave); but1 before I got thither, the grapes were
Spoiled; the richness of the fruit, and the weight of
the juice, having broken them and bruised them,
they were good for little or nothing: as to the limes,
they were good, but I could bring but a few.

The next day, being the 19th, I went back, having
made me two small bags to bring home my harvest;
butI was surprised, when coming to my heap of
grapes, which were so rich and fine when I gathered
them, I found them all spread abroad, trod to pieces,
and dragged about, some here, some there, and
abundance eaten and devoured. By this, I con-
cluded there were some wild creatures thereabouts,
which had done this; but what they were, I knew
not.

However, as I found there was no laying them up
on heaps, and no carrying them away in a sack,but
that one way they would be destroyed, and the
other way they would be crushed with their own
weight, I took another course; for I gathered a
large quantity of the grapes, and hung them upon
the out-branches of the trees, that they might cure
and dry in the sun; and as for the limes and
lemons, I carried as many back as I could well
stand under.

When I came home from this journey, I contem-
F 2
plated, with great pleasure, the fruitfulness of that
valley, and the pleasantness of the situation, the
security from storms on that side of the water, and
the wood ; and concluded that I had pitched upon
a place to fix my abode, which was, by far, the worst
part of the country. Upon the whole, I began to
consider of removing my habitation, and to look
out for a place equally safe as where I now was
situate, if possible, in that pleasant fruitful part of
the island.

This thought run long in my head, and I was ex-
ceeding fond of it for some time, the pleasantness
of the place tempting me; but when I came to a
nearer view of it, and to consider that I was now
by the sea-side, where it was at least possible that
something might happen to my "advantage, and that
the same ill fate that brought me hither, might bring
some other unhappy wretches to the same place;
and though it was scarce probable that any such
thing should ever happen, yet, to enclose myself
among the hills and woods, in the centre of the
island, was to anticipate my bondage, and to ren-
der such an affair not only improbable, but impos-
sible; and that therefore I ought not, by any means,
to remove.

However, I was so enamoured with this place,
that I spent much of my time there, for the whole
remaining part of the month of July; and though,
upon second thoughts, I resolved as above, not to
remove, yet I built me a little kind ot'a bower, and
surrounded it, at a distance, with a strong fence,
being a double hedge, as high as I could reach,well
staked and filled between with brushwood; and
here I lay very secure, sometimes two or three
nights together, always going over it with a ladder,
as before, so that I fancied now I had my country
' house, and my sea-coast house: and this work took
me up to the beginning of August.

Iliad but newly finished my fence, and began to
enjoy my labour, when the rains came on, and made
me stick close to my first habitation; for though I
had made me a tent like the other, with a piece
of a sail, and spread it very well, yet I had not the
shelter of a hill to keep me from storms, nor a cave
behind me to retreat into, when the rains were ex
traordinary.

About the beginning of August, as I said, I had
finished my bower, and began to enjoy myself. The
3d of August, I found the grapes I had hung up
were perfectly dried, and indeed were excellent
good raisins of the sun; so I began to take them
down from the trees, and it was very happy'that I
did so, for the rains which followed would have
spoiled them, and I had .lost the best part of my
winter food; for I had above two hundred large
bunches of them. No sooner had 1 taken them all
down, and carried most of them home to my cave,
but it began to rain; andfrom hence, which was.
the 14th of August, it rained more or less every
day, till the middle of October; and sometimes so
violently that I could not stir out of my cave for
several days.

In this season, I Was much surprised with the in-
crease of my family. I had been concerned for the
loss of one of my cats, who ran away from me, or,
as I thought, had been dead; and I heard no more
tale or tidings of her, till, to my astonishment, she
came home about the end of August, with three
kittens. This was the more strange to me, because,
though I had killed a wild cat, as I called it, with
my gun, yet I thought it was a quite different kind
from our European cats; yet the young cats were
the same kind of house-breed, like the old' one;
and both my cats being females, I thought it very
strange. But from these three cats, 1 afterwards
came to be so pestercd with cats, that I was forced
to kill them like vermin, or wild beasts, and to drive
them from .my house as much as possible. .

From the 14th of August to the 26th, incessant
rain, so that I could not stir, and was now very
careful not to be much wet. In this confinement
bhegan to be straitened for food; but venturing out
twice, I one day killed a goat; and the last day,
which was the 26th, found a very large tortoise,
which was a treat to me; and my food was regu-
lated thus: I eat a bunch of raisins for my break-
fast; a piece of the goat's flesh, or of the turtle, for
my dinner, broiled (for, to my great misfortune, I
had no vessel to boil or stew any thing); and two or
three of the turtle's eggs for supper.

During this confinement in my cover by the rain,
I worked daily two or three hours at enlarging my
cave; and, by degrees, worked it on towards one
side, till I came to the outside of the hill, and made
a door or way out, which came beyond my fence or
Wall, and so I came in and out this way. But I was
not perfectly easy at lying so open; for, as I had
managed myself before, I was in a perfect enclo-
sure, whereas now I thought I lay exposed ; and
yet I could not perceive that there was any living
thing to fear, the biggest creature that I had yet
seen upon the island being a goat.

September the 30th. I was now come to the un-
. happy anniversary of my landing. I cast up the
notches on my post, and found I had been on shore
three hundred and sixty-five days. I kept this day
as a solemn fast, setting it apart to religious exer.
cise, prostrating myself on the ground with the
most serious humiliation, confessing my sins to God,
acknowledging his righteous judgments upon me,
and praying to him to have mercy on me, through
Jesus Christ; and having not tasted the least re-
freshment for twelve hours, even till the going
down of the sun, I then eat a biscuit cake, and a
bunch of grapes. and went to bed, finishing the day
as I began it.

I had all this time observed no Sabbath-day; for
as at first I had no sense of religion upon my mind,
I had after some time omitted to distinguish the
weeks, by making a longer notch than ordinary for
the Sabbathday, and so did not really know what
any of the days were; but now having cast up the
_ days as above, I found I had been there a year, so
I divided it into weeks, and set apart every seventh
day for a Sabbath; though I found at the end of my
account,1 had lost a day or two in my reckoning.

A little after this, my ink began to fail me, and so
I contented myself to use it more sparingly, and to
write down only the most remarkable events of my
life, without continuing a daily memorandum of
other things. .

The rainy season, and the dryseason, began now
to appear regular to me, and I learned to divide
them so as to provide for them accordingly. But I
bought all my experience before 1 had it: and this
I am going to relate, was one of the most discou-
raging experiments that I made at all. I have men-
tioned, that I had saved the few ears of barley and
rice, which I had so surprisingly found spring up,
as I thought, of themselves, and believe there were
about thirty stalks of rice, and about twenty of
barley ; and now I thought it a proper time to sow
it after the rains, the sun being in its southern posi-
tion going from me.

Accordingly, I dug up a piece of ground, as well
as I could, with my wooden spade, and dividing it
into two parts, 1 sowed my grain; but, as I was
sowing, it casually occurred to my thoughts, that I
would not sow it all at first, because I did not
know when was the proper time for it; so I sowed
about two-thirds of the seed, leaving about a hand-
ful of each.

It was a great comfort to me afterwards that I
did so; for not one grain of that I sowed this time
came to any thing; for the dry months following,
the earth having had no rain after the seed was
sown, it had no moisture to assist its growth, and
never came up at all, till the wet season had come

again, and then it grew as if it had been but newly
sown.
Finding my first seed did not grow, which I easily
imagined was by the drought, Isought for a moister
piece of ground to make another trial 1n; and I dug
up a piece of ground near my new bower, and sowed
the rest of my seed in February, a little before the
vernal equinox; and this, having the rainy months
of March and April to water it, Sprung up very
pleasantly, and yielded a very good crop; but hav-
ing part of the seed left only, and not daring to sow
all that I had yet, 1 had but a small quantity atlast,
my whole Clop not amounting to above half a peek
of each kind. 1

But, by this experiment, I was made master of my
business, and knew exactly when the proper season
was to sow; and that I might expect two seed-
times, and two harvests, every year.

While this corn was growing, I made a little dis-
covery, which was of use to me afterwards. As soon
as the rains were over, and the weather began to
settle, which was about the month of November, I
made a visit up the country to my bower, where,
though I had notbeen some months, yetI found all
things just as I left them.' The circle or double
hedge, that I had made, was not only firm and en--
tire, but the stakes which I had cut off of some
trees that grew thercabouts, were all shot out, and
grown with long branches, as much as a willow t1 ee
usually shoots the first year after lopping its head.
I could not tell what tree to call it that these stakes
were cut from. 1 was surprised, and yet very well
pleased, to seethe young trees grow; and I pruned
them, and led them up to grow as much alike as
I could; and it is scarce credible how beautiful a
figure they grew into in three years, so that though
the hedge made a circle of about twenty-live yards
in diameter, yet the trees, for such I might now call
them,soon covered it ; and it was a complete shade,
sufficient to lodge under all the dry season.

This made the resolve to cut some more stakes.
and make me a hedge, like this, in a semicircle,
round my wall, I mean that of my first dwelling,
which I did ; and, placing the trees or stakes in a
double row, at about eight yards' distance from my '
first fence, they grew presently, and were, at first,
a fine cover to my habitation, and afterwards served
for a defence also, as I shall observe in its order.

I found now that the seasons of the year might
generally be divided, not into summer and winter,
as in Europe; but into the rainy season, and the dry
season, which were generally thus:

Half February,
March,
Half April,

5

Half August,

Half October,
govemtber, Dry, the sun being then to the
January,

Half February,

. The rainy season sometimes held longer or shorter,
as the winds happened to blow; but this was the
general observation I made. After I had found, by
experience, the ill consequence of being abroad in
the rain, I took care to furnish myself with provisions
beforehand, that I mightuot be obliged to go out;
and I sat within doors, as much as possible, during
the wet months.

In this time I found much employment (and very
suitable also to the time); for I found great occa--
sion of many things which I had no way to furnish
myself with, but by hard labour, and constant appli-
cation: particularly, I tried many ways to make
myself a basket; but all the twigs I could get for
the purpose proved so brittle, that they would do
nothing; It proved of excellent advantage to me
now, that, when I was a boy, I used to take great
delight in standing at a basket-maker's, in the town
where my father lived, to see them make their
wickenware; and being, as boys usually are, very
oflicious to help, and a great observer of the man-
ner how they worked those things, and sometimes
lending a hand, I had, by this means,so full know-
ledge of the methods of it, that I wanted nothing
but the materials: when it came into my mind, that
the twigs of that tree, from whence I cut my stakes
that grew, might possibly be as tough as the sallows,
and willows,'and osiers, in England ; and I resolved
to try.

Accordingly, the next day, I went to my country
house, as I called it, and cutting some of the smaller
twigs, 1 found them to my purpose as much as I
could desire: whereupon I came the next time pre-
pared with a hatchet to cut down a quantity, which
I soon found, for there was great plenty of them.
These 1 set up to dry within my circle or hedge,
and when they were fit for use, I carried them to
my cave; and here, during the next season, I em-
ployed myself in making, as well as 1 could, a great
many baskets, both to carry earth, or to carry or lay
up any thing, as I had occasion ; and though I did
not finish them very handsomely, yet I made them
sufficiently serviceable for my purpose: and thus,
afterwards, I took care never to be without them;
and, as my wicker-ware decayed, I made more;
especially I made strong deep baskets to place my'
corn in, instead of sacks, when I should come to
have any quantity of it.

Having mastered this difliculty, and employed a
world of time about it, I bestirrcd myself to see, if
possible, how to supply two wants. I. had no ves-
sels to hold any thing that was liquid, except two
runlets, which were almost full of rum, and some
glass bottles, some of the common size, and others
which were case-bottles square, for the holding of
waters, spirits, &c. I had not so much as a pot to
boil any thing in, except a great kettle which I
saved out of the ship, and which was too big for
such uses as I desired it for, viz. to make broth, and
stew a bit of meat by itself. The second thing I
would fain have had, was a tobacco-pipe ; but it was
impossible for me to make one: however, I found
a contrivance for that too at last.

I employed myself in planting my second rows of
stakes or piles, and in this wicker-work, all the
summer, or dry season; when another business took
me up more time than it could be imagined I could
Spare.

I mentioned before, that I had a great mind to see
the whole island. and that I had travelled up the
brook, and so on to where 1 built my bower, and
where I had an opening quite to the sea, on the
other side of the island. I now resolved to travel
quite cross to the sea-shore on that side; so taking
my gun, a hatchet, and my dog, and a larger quan-
tity of powder and shot than usual, with two biscuit
cakes, and a great bunch of raisins in my pouch, for
my store, I began my journey. When I had passed
the vale where my bower stood, as above, I came
within view of the sea, to the west; and it being a
very clear day, I fairly descried land, whether an
island or a continent, I could not tell; but it lay
very high, extending from the west, to the W. S. W.
at a very great distance: by my guess, it could not
be less than fifteen or twenty leagues off.

I could not tell what part of the world this might
be, otherwise than that I knew it must be part of
America; and, as I concluded, by all my observa-
tions, must be near the Spanish dominions, and
perhaps was all inhabited by savages, where, if I
should have landed, I had been in a worse con-
dition than I was now; and therefore I acquiesced55. --v---- wan-w-- --.,..,.,-----. -

11'1' ROBINSON CRUSOE.

in the dispositions of Providence, which I began
now to own, and to believe, ordered every thing
for the best; I say, I quieted my mind with this,
and left afflicting myself with fruitless wishes of
being there.

Besides, after some pause upon this affair, I con-
sidered, that if this land was the Spanish coast, 1
should certainly one time or other, see some ves
sels pass or repass one way or other: but if not
then it was the savage coast between the Spanish
country and Brasils, which were indeed the worst
of savages, for they are. cannibals, or men esters, and
fail not to murder and devour all the human bodies
that fall into their hands.

With these considerations I walked very leisurely
forward. I found that side of the island whcrel
now was much pleasanter than mine, the open or
savanna fields sweet, adorned with flowers and grass,
and full of very fine woods. I Saw abundance of
parrots, and fa'm would I have caught one, if pos-
sible, to have kept it to be tame, and taught it to
speak to me. I did, after some pains taking, catch
a young parrot; for I knocked it down with a stick,
and having recovered it, I blought' 1!. home, butit
was some years before I could make him speak.
However, at last I taught him to call me by my
name very familiarly. But the accident that fol-
lowed, though it be a trifle, will be very diverting
in its place.

I was exceedingly diverted with this Jou111ey. I
found 111 the low grounds, hares, as I thought them
to be, and foxes, but they differed greatly from all
the other kinds I had met with; nor could I satisfy
myselfto eat them, though I killed several. ButI
had no need to be venturous, tor I had no want 0|
food, and of that which was very good too; espe-
cially these three sorts, viz. goats, pigeons, and tur:
tlc or tortoise, which, added to my grapes, Leaden-
hall market could not have furnished a table better
than I, in proportion to the company. And though
my case was deplorable enough, yet I had great
cause for thankfulness, that I was not driven to any
extremities for food; but had rather plenty, even to
dainties.

I never travelled in this journey above two miles
outright in a day, or thereabouts; but I took so
many turns and returns to see what discoveries I
could make, that I'came weary enough to the place
where I resolved to sit down for all night: and
then I either reposed myself in a tree, or surrounded
myself with a row of stakes set upright in the
ground, either from one tree to another, or so as
no wild creature could come at me, without waking
me. .
As soon as I came to the sea shore, I was sur-
prised to see that I had taken up my lot on the
worst side of the island; for here indeed the shore
was covered with innumerable turtles; whereas
on the other side I had found but three in a
year and a half. Here was also an infinite num-
ber of fowls, of many kinds, seme of which I had
seen, and some of which I had not seen before,
and many of them very good meat; but such as
I knew not the names of, except those called
penguins.

I could have shot as many as I pleased, but was
very sparing of my powder and shot ; and therefore
had more mind to kill a she-goat, if I could, which
1 could better feed on. And though there were
many goats here more than on my side of the
island, yet it was with much more difficulty that I
could come near them. the country being flat and
even, and they saw me much sooner than when I
was on the hills.

I confess this side of the country was much plea-
santer than mine, but yet I had not the least incli-
nation to remove; for as I was fixed in my habita-
tion, it became natural to me; andI seemed all the
while I was here, to be, as it were, upon ajourney,
and from home. However, I travelled along the
shore of the sea, towards the east, I suppose, aboul
twelve miles; and then setting up a great pole upo:
the shore, for a mark, I concluded I would go home
again; and that the nextjourney I took, should be on
the other side of the island, east from my dwelling,
and so round, till I came to my post again: of which
in its place.

I took another way to come back than that I
went, thinking I could easily keep all the island so
much in my view, that I could not miss finding my
first dwelling, by viewing the country: but 1 found ~
myself mistaken: for being come about two or three
miles, 1 found myself descended into a very large
valley, but so surrounded with hills, and those hills
covered with woods, that 1 could not see which
was my way by any direction but that of the sun,
nor even then, unless I knew very well the position
of the sun at that time of the day.

It happened, to my farther misfortune, that the
weather proved hazy for three or four days, while I
was in this valley; and not being able to see. the
sun, I wandered about very uncomfortably, and at
last was obliged to find out the sea-side, look for
' my post, and come back the same way I went; and
then, by easy journeys, I turned homeward, the
weather being exceeding hot; and my gun, ammu~
nition, hatchet, and other things, very heavy.

In this journey my dog surprised a young kid,
and seized upon it; and I running in to take hold
of it, caught it, and saved it alive from the (log. 1
had a great mind to bring it home. if I could; for I
had often been musing whether it,might not be pos-
sible to get a kid or two, and so raise a breed of
tame goats, which might supply me when my powder
and shot should be all spent.

I made acollar to this little creature, and with
a string, which 1 made of some rOpe-yarn, which I
always carried about me, I led him along, though
with some difficulty, till 1 came to my bower, and
there I enclosed him, and left him; for I was very
. impatient to be at home, from whence I had been
absent above a month.

I cannot express what a satisfaction it was to me
to come into my old hutch, and lie down in my
hammock-bed. This little wandering journey, with-
out any settled place of abode, had been so unplea-
sant to me, that my own house, as I called it to my-
self, was a perfect settlement to me, compared to
that; and it rendered every thing about me so com-
fortable, that I resolved I would never go a great
way from it again, while it should be my lot to stay
on the island.

I reposed myself here a week, to rest and regale
myself after my long journey, during which, most
of the time was taken up in the weighty affair of
making a cage for my poll, who began now to be a
mere domestic, and to be mighty well acquainted
with me. Then I began to think of the poor kid,
which I had pent in within my little circle, and
resolved to go and fetch it home, or give it some
food: accordingly I went. and found it where I left
it, for indeed it could not get out, but was almost
starved for want of food. 1 went and cut boughs
0f trees, and branches of such shrubs as I could
find, and threw it over; and having fed it, I tied it
as I did before, to lead it away; but it was so tame
with being hungry, that I had no need to have tied
it, for it followed me like a dog: and as I continu-
ally fed it, the creature became so loving, so gentle,
and so fond, that it became, from that time, one
of my domestics also, and would never leave me
afterwards.

The rainy season of the autumnal equinox was
now come, and I kept the 30th of September in the
same solemn manner as before, being the anniver.
Sary of my landing on the island, having now been
there two years, and no more prospect of being de-
livered than. the first day I came there. I spent the
whole day in humble and thankful acknowledge-
ments of the many wonderful mercies which my
solitary condition was attended with, and without
which it might have been infinitely more miserabfe.
I gave humble and hearty thanks, that God had
been pleased to discover to me, even that it was
possible I might be morehappy in this solitary cou-
dition, than I should have been in aliberty of so:
ciety, and in all the pleasures of the world ; that he
could fully make up to me the deficiencies of my
solitary state, and the want of human society, by his
presence, and the communications of his grace to
my soul, supporting, comforting, and encouraging
me to depend upon his providence here, and hope
for his eternal presence hereafter.

It was now that I began sensibly to feel how
much more happy the life I now led was, with all
its miserable circumstances, than the wicked, cursed,
abominable life I led all the past part of my days;
and now having changed both my sorrows and my
joys, my very desires altered, my affections changed
their gusts, and my delights were perfectly new.
from what they were at my first coming, or indeed
for the two years past.

Before, as I walked about, either on my hunting,
or for-viewing the country, the anguish of my soul
at my condition would break out upon me on a
sudden, and my very heart would die within me,
to think of the woods, the mountains, the deserts
I wasin ; and how I was a prisoner locked up, with
the eternal bars and bolts of the ocean,in an unin-
habited widerness, without redemption. In the
midst of the greatest composures of my mind, this
would break out upon me, like a storm, and make,
me wring my hands, and weep like a child. Some
times it would take me in the middle of my work>>
and I would immediately sit down and sigh, and
look upon the ground for an hour or twotogethen
and this was still worse to me; for if I could burst

,out into tears, or vent myself by words, it would
go off, and the grief, having exhausted itself, would
abate.
But now I began to exercise myself with new
thoughts. I daily read the word of God, and
applied all the comforts of it to my present state.
One morning, being very sad, I opened the Bible
upon these words, ' I will never, never leave thee,
nor forsake thee!' Immediately it occurred, that
these words were to me; why else should they be
directed in such a manner, just at the moment
when I was mourning over my condition, as one
forsaken of God and man? ' Well, then,' said I, ' if
God does not forsake me, of what ill consequence
can it be. or what matters it,' though the world
should all forsake me, seeing, on the other hand,
if I had all the world, and should lose the favour
and blessing of God, there would be no comparison
in the loss?'

From this moment I began to conclude in my
mind, that it was possible for me to be more happy
in this forsaken, solitary condition, than it was
probable I should have ever been in any other par-
ticular state in the world ; and, with this thought,
1 was going to give thanks to God for bringing me
to this place. "

I know not what it was, but something shocked
my mind at that thought, and 1 (lurst not speak the
words. ' How canst thou be such a hypocrite (said
I, even audibly), to pretend to be thankful for a
condition which, however thou mayest endeavour
to be contented with, thou wouldst rather pray
heartily to be delivered from?' So I stOpped there.
But though I could not say, I thanked God for
being there ; yet I sincerely gave thanks to God for
Opening my eyes, by whatever afflicting providences,
to see the former condition of my life, and to
mourn for my wickedness, and repent. I never
Opened the Bible, or shut it, but my very soul
within me blessed God for directing my friend in
England, without any order of mine, to pack it
up among my goods, and for assisting me after-
wards to save it out of the wreck of the ship.
Thus, and in this disposition of mind, I began my
third year: and though I have not given the reader
the trouble of so particular an account of my works
this year as the first; yet in general it may be
observed, that I was very seldom idle, having regu-
larly divided my time according to. the several
daily employments that were before me; such as.
First, My duty to God, and reading the Scriptures,
which I constantly set apart some time for, thrice
every day. Secondly, The going abroad with my
gun for food, which generally took me up three
hours in every morning, when it did not rain.
Thirdly, The ordering, curing, preserving, and cook-
ing, what I had killed or catchetl for my supply;
these took up great part of the day. Also it is to
be considered, that the middle of the day, when
the sun was in the zenith, the violence of the heat
was too great to stir out, so that about four hours
in the evening was all the time I could be sup
posed to work in; with this exception, that some-
times I changed my hours of hunting and working,
and went to work in the morning, and abroad with
my gun in the afternoon.

To this short time allowed for labour, I desire
may be added the exceeding laboriousness of my
work, the many hours, which, for want of tools,
want of help, and want of skill, every thing that 1
did, took up out of my time. For example, I was
full two-and-forty days making me a board fora
long shelf, which I wanted in my cave; whereas
two sawyers, with their tools and a saw-pit, would
have out six of them, out of the same tree, in half
a day.

My case was this: it was to be a large tree which
was to be cut down, because my board was to be a
broad one. This tree I was three days a cutting
down, and two more cutting'ofl" the boughs, and
reducing it to a log or piece of timber. With in-
expressible hacking and hewing, I reduced both
the sides of it into chips, till it began to be light
enough to move; then I turned it, and made one
side of it smooth and flat as a board, from end to
end; then turning that side downward, cut the
other side, till I brought the plank to be about
three inches thick, and smooth on both sides. Any
one may judge the labour of my hands in such a'
piece of work; but labour and patience carried me
through that, and many other things. I only observe
this in particular, to show the reason why so much
of my time went away with so little work, viz. that
what might be a little to be done with help and
tools, was a vast labour, and required a prodigious
time to do alone, and by hand.

But,notwithstanding this, with patience and la-
bour I went through many things, and indeed every
thing that my circumstances made necessary for me
to do, as will appear by what follows.

I was now in the months of November and De-
cember, expecting my crop of barley and rice. The
ground I had manured or dug up for them was not
great; for, as I observed, my seed of each was not
above the quantity of half a peck, for Iliad lost
' one whole crop by sowing in the dry season, but
now my crop promised very well, when, on a sud-
d'en, I found 1 was in danger of losing it all again,
by enemies of several sorts, which it was scarce
possible to keep from it; as first, the goats, and
wild creatures which I called hares, who, tasting
the sweetness of the blade, lay in it night and day,
as soon as it came up, and eat it so- close, that it
could get no time to shoot up into stalk.

This I saw no remedy for, but by making an en-
closure about it with a hedge, which I did with a
great deal of toil, and the more because it required
Speed, the creatures daily spoiling my corn. How-
ever, as my arable land was but small, suited to my
Cl'Op, I got it totally well fenced in about three
Weeks' time;- and shooting some of the creatures in'
the day-time, I set my dog to guard it in the night,
tying him- up to a stake at the gate, where he

6
would stand and bark all night long; so, in a little
time, the enemies forsook the place, and the care
grew very strong and well, and began to ripen
apace.

But, as the beasts ruined me before, while my
corn was in the blade, so the birds were as likely to
ruin me now, when it was in the car; for going
along by the place to see how it throve, I saw my
little crop surrounded with fowls, of I know not
how many sorts, who stood, as it were, watching
till I should be gone. I immediately let fly among
them (for I always had my gun with me). I had
no sooner shot, but there rose up a little cloud of
fowls, which I had not seen at all, from among the .
corn itself.

This touched me sensibly; for I foresaw that, in
a few days, they'would devour all my hopes; that
I should be starved, and never be able to raise a
crop at all; and what to do, I could not tell. '
However, I resolved not to lose my corn, if pos-
sible, though I should watch it night and day. In
the first place, I went among it to see what damage
was already done, and found they had spoiled: '
good deal of it; but that, as it was yet too green
for them, the loss was not so great, but that the
remainder was like to be a good crop, if it could be
saved.

I staid by it to load my gun, and then coming
away, I could easily see the thieves sitting upon all
the trees about me, as if they only waited till I was
gone away, and the event proved it to be so; for
as I walked off. as if I was gone, I was no sooner
out of their sight, but they dropped down, one by
one, into the corn again. I was so provoked, that I
could not have patience to stay till more came on,
knowing that every grain that they eat now, was,
as it might be said, a peck loaf to me in the conse
quence; but, coming up to the hedge, I fired again,
and killed three'of them. This was what I wished
for; so I took them up, and served them as we
serve notorious thieves in England, viz. hanged
them in chains for a terror to others. It is impos-
sible to imagine almost that this should have such
an efl'ect as it had; for the fowls would not only
not come at the corn, but, in short, they forsook
all that part of the island, and I could never see a
bird near the place as long as my scarecrows hung
there.

This I was very glad of, you may be sure; and,
about the latter end of December, which was our
second harvest of the year, I reaped my crop.

1 was sadly put to it for a scythe, or a sickle: to
cut it down, and all I could do was to make one as
well as I could, out of one of the broad swords, or
cutlasses, which I saved among the arms out of the
ship. However, as my crop was but small, I had
no great difficulty to cut it down. In short, I
reaped it my way; for I cut nothing off but the
ears, and carried it away in a great basket which I
had made, and so rubbed it out with my hands.
And at the end of all my harvesting, I found that,
out of my half peek of seed, I had near two bushels
of rice, and above two bushels and a half of barley;
that is to say, by my guess, for I had no measure
at that time.

However, this was a great encouragement to me;
and I foresaw that, in time, it would please God to
supply me with bread. And yet here I was per-
plexed again, for I neither knew how to grind or
make meal of 'my corn, or indeed how to clean it,
and part it; nor, if made into meal, how to make
bread of it; and if how to make it, yet I knew not
how to bake it. These things being added to my
desire of having a good quantity for store, and to
secure a constant supply, I resolved not to taste
any of this crop, but to preserve it all for seed
against the next season, and, in the mean time, to
employ all my study and hours of working to accom-

plish this great work of providing myself with corn
and bread.
It might be truly said, that now I worked for my
bread. It is a little wonderful, and whatl believe few '
people have thought much upon; viz. the strange
multitude of little things neceSsary in the providing,
producing, curing, dressing, making, and finishing
this one article of bread.

I, that was reduced to a mere state of nature,
found this to be my daily discouragement, and was
made more and more sensible of it every hour, even
after I had got the first handful of seed-corn, which,
as I have said, came up unexpectedly, and indeed
to a surprise.

First, I had no plough to turn up the earth, no
spade or shovel to dig it. Well, this I conquered
by making a wooden spade, as I observed before;
but this did my work but in a wooden manner:' and
though it cost me a great many days to make it,
yet for want of iron it not only wore out the
sooner, but made my work the harder, and made it
be performed much worse.

However, this I bore with, and was content to
work it out with patience, and bear with the bad-
ness of the performance. When the corn was
sowed, I had no harrow; but was forced to go over
it myself, and drag a great heavy bough of a tree
over it, to scratch the earth, as it may be called,
rather than rake or harrow it.

When it was growing and grown, I have observed
already how many things I wanted, to fence it,
secure it, mow or reap it, cure and carry it home,
thresh, part it from the chafl", and save it. Then I
wanted a mill to grind it, sieves to dress it, yeast
and salt to make it into bread, and an oven to bake
it in ; and yet all these things 1 did without, as shall
be observed; and yet the corn was an inestimable
comfort and advantage to me too. All this, as I'
said, made every thing laborious and tedious to me.
but that there was no help for: neither was my
time so much loss to me, because as I had divided

it, a certain part of it was every day appointed to
these works; and, as I resolved to use none of the
corn for bread, till I had a greater quantity by me,
I had the next six months to apply myself wholly
by labour and invention to furnish myself with
utensils proper for the performing all the operations
necessary for the making the corn, when I had it fit
for my use.

But, first, I was to prepare more land,' for I had
now seed enough to sow above an acre of ground.
Before I did this,I had a week's work at least to
make me a spade, which, when it was done, was but
a sorry one indeed, and very heavy, and required
double labour to work with it. However, I went
through that, and sowed my seed in two large flat
pieces of ground, as near my house as I could find
them to my mind, and fenced them in with a good
hedge, the stakes of which were all cut of that
wood which I had Set before, which I knew would
grow ; so that, in one year's time, I knew I should
have a quick or living hedge, that would want but
little repair. This work was not so little as to take
me up less than three months, because great part of
that time was of the wet season, when I could not
go abroad.

Within-doors, that is, when it rained, and I could
not go out, I found employment on the following
Occasions; always observing, that all the while I
was at work, I diverted myself with talking to my
parrot, and teaching him to speak; and I quickly
learned him to know his own name, at last, to
Speak it out pretty loud, ' Poll;' which was the
first word I ever heard spoken in the island by any
mouth but my own. This therefore was not my
work, but an assistant to my work; for now, as I
said, I had a great employment upon my hands, as
follows, viz. i had long studied, by some means or
other, to make myself some earthen vessels, which
Indeed I wanted sorely, but knew not where to
COme at them. However, considering the heat of
the climate, I did not doubt but, if I could find out
any such clay, I might botch up some such pot, as
might, being dried in the sun, be hard enough, and
strong enough, to bear handling, and to hold any
thing that was dry, and required to be kept so; and
as this was necessary in preparing corn, meal, &c.
which was the thing I was upon, I resolved to make
some as large as I could, and fit only to stand like
jars to hold what should be put into them.

It would make the reader pity me, or rather
laugh at me, to tell how many awkward ways i
took to raise this paste; what odd, mishapen, ugly
things I made; how many of them fell in, and how '
many fell out, the clay not being stiff enough to
bear its own weight; how many cracked by the
over-violent heat of the sun. being set out too
hastily; and how many fell to pieces with only re-
moving, as well before as after they were dried:
and, in a word, how, after having laboured hard to
find the clay, to dig it, to temper it, to bring it
home, and work it, 1 could not make above two '
large, earthen, ugly things, I cannot call them jam
in about two months'labour.

However, as the sun baked these two very dry
and hard, I lifted them very gently up, and sel .
them down again in two great wicker-baskets, which
I had made on purpose for them, that they might
not break; and as between the pot and the basket
there was a little room to Spare, I stuffed it full '
of the rice and barley straw; and these two pots.
being to stand always dry, I thought would hold
my dry corn, and perhaps the meal when the cor!l
was bruised. '

Though I miscarried so much in my design for
large pots, yet I made several smaller things with
better success; such as little round pots, llat dishes,
pitchers, and pipkins, and any thing my hand turned
to; and the heat of the sun baked them strangely
hard. '

0 But all this would not answer my end, which was
to get an earthen pot to hold what was liquid, and .
bear the fire, which none of these could do. It
happened after some time, making a pretty large
fire for cooking my meat, when I went to put it
out, after I had done with it, I found a broken
piece of one of my earthen-ware vessels in the fire,
burnt as hard as a stone, and red as a tile. I was
agreeably surprised to see it, and said to myself,
that certainly they might be made to burn whole, if
they would burn broken. '

This set me to study how to order my fire, so as
to make it burn me some pots. I had no notion of a
kiln, such as the potters burn in, or of glazing them
with lead, though I had some lead to do it with ;
but I placed three large pipkins, and two or three
pots, in a pile one upon another, and placed my
fire-wood all round it with a great heap of embers
under them. I plied the fire with fresh fuel round
the outside, and upon the top, till I saw the pots in
the inside red-hot quite through, and observed that
they did not crack at all. When I saw them clear
red, I let them stand in that heat about five or six
hours, till I found one of them, though it did not
crack, did melt or run; for the sand which was
mixed with the clay melted by the violence of the
heat, and would have run into glass, if I had gone
on; so 1 slacked my fire gradually, till the pots
began to abate of the red colour, and watching
them all night, that I might not let the (ire abate
too fast, in the morning I had three very good, I
will not say handsome, pipkins, and two other
earthen pots, as hard burnt as could be desired : and
one of them perfectly glazed with the running of
the sand.

After this experiment, I need not say that I
wanted no sort of earthen-ware for my use; but I
must needs say, as to the shapes of them, they were
very indilTerent, as any one may suppose, when I
had no Way of making them, but as the children

make dirt-pies, or as a woman would make pics that
never learnt to raise paste.
No joy at a thing of so mean a nature was ever
equal to mine, when I found I had made an earthen
pot that would bear the fire; and I had hardly
patience to stay till they were cold, before I set
one upon the fire again, with some water in it, to
boil'me some meat, which it did admirably well;
and, with a piece of a kid, I made some very good
broth, though I wanted oatmeal, and several'other
ingredients requisite to make it as good as I would
have had it.

My next concern was to get me a stone mortar
to stamp or beat some, corn in; for as to the mill,
there was no thought of arriving to that perfection
of art, with one pair of hands. To supply this want
1 was at a great loss; for, of all trades in the
world, I was as perfectly unqualified for a stone-
cutter, as for any whatever: neither had I any
tools to go about it with. I spent many a day to
find out a great stone big enough to cut hollow.
and make fit for a mortar, and could find none at
all, except what was in the solid rock, and which I
had no way to dig or cut out; nor indeed were
the rocks in the island of hardness sufficient, but
were all of a sandy crumbling stone, which would
neither bear the weight of a heavy pestle, nor
would break the corn without filling it with sand.
80, after a great deal of time lost in searching for
a stone, 1 gave it over, and resolved to look out a
great block of hard wood, which 1 found indeed
much easier; and getting one as big as I had
strength to stir, I rounded it, and formed it on the
outside with my axe and hatchet; and then, with
the help of tire, and infinite labour, made a hollow
place in it, as the Indians in Brasil make their
canoes. After this, I made a great heavy pestle or
heater, of the wood called the iron-wood, and this
I prepared and laid by against I had my next crop
of corn, when I proposed to myself to grind, or
rather pound, my corn into meal, to make my

bread.
My next difficulty was to make a sieve, or
searce, to dress my meal, and to part it from the
bran and the husk, without which I did not see it
possible I could have any bread. This was a most
difficult thing, so much as but to think on; for, to
be sure, I had nothing like the necessary thing to
make it with, I mean fine thin canvass, or stuff to
scarce the meal through. And here I was at a full
stop for many months; nor did I really know what
to do: linen I had none left, but what was mere
rags. I had goat's hair, but neither knew 1 how to
weave or spin it; and had I known how, here were
no tools to work it with: all the remedy that 1'
found for this, was, that at last I did remember I
had, among the seamen's clothes, which were saved
out of the ship, some neckcloths of calico or mus-
lin; and with some pieces of these I made three
small sieves, but proper enough for the work: and
thus I made shift for some years. How I did after-
wards, I shall show in its place.

The baking part was the next thing to be con--
sidered, and how I should make bread when I came
to have corn; for, first, I had no yeast. As to that
part, as there was no supplying the want, so I did
not concern myself much about it; but for an oven,
1 was indeed in great pain. At length, I found out
an expedient for that also, which was this : I made
some earthen vessels very broad, but not deep;
that is to say, about two feet diameter, and not
above nine inches deep: these I burnt in the fire, as _
I had done the other, and laid them by, and when I
wanted to bake, I made a great fire upon my hearth,
which I had paved with some square tiles, of my
own making and burning also: but I should not call
them square.

When the fire-wood was burnt pretty much into
embers, or live coals, I drew them forward upon
this hearth, so as to cover it all over; and there I
let them lie, till the hearth was very hot; then
sweeping away all the embers, I set down my loaf

G 2
or loaves, and, whelming down the earthen pot upon
them, drew the embers all round the outside of the
pot, to keep in, and add to the heat; and thus, as
well asin the best oven in the world, I baked my
barley-loaves, and became, in a little time, a mere
pastry-cook into the bargain; for I made myself
several cakes of the rice, and puddings: indeed I
made no pies, neither had I any thing to put into
them, supposing I had, except the flesh either of
fowls or goats.

It need not be wondered at, if all these things
took me up most part of the. third year of my abode
here: for it is to be observed, that, in the intervals
of these things, I had my new harvest and bus
bandry to manage, for I reaped my corn in its sea-
son, and carried it home as well as I could,'and
laid it up in the ear, in my large baskets, till I had
time to rub it out; for I had no floor to thresh it
on, or instrument to thresh it with.

And now indeed my stock of corn increasing, I
really wanted to build my barns bigger. I wanted
a place to lay it up in ; for the increase of the corn
now yielded me so much, that I had of the barley
about twenty bushels, and of the rice as much, or
more; insomuch that now I resolved to begin to
use it freely, for my bread had been quite gone a
great while; also I resolved to see .what quantity
would be sufficient for me a whole year, and to sow
but once a year.

Upon the whole, I found that the forty bushels
of barley and rice were much more than I could
consume in a year; so I resolved tosow just the
same quantity every year that I sowed the last, in
hopes that such a quantity would fully provide me
with bread, &c.

All the while these things were doing, you may
be sure my thoughts ran many times upon the pro-
spect of land, which I had seen from the other
side of the island; and I was not without secret

wishes that I were on shore there, fancying that
seeing the mainland, and an inhabited country, I
might find some way or other to convey myself
farther, and perhaps at last find some means of
escape.

But all this while I made no allowance for the
dangers of such a condition, and how I might fall
into the hands of savages, and perhaps such as I
might have reason to think far worse than the lions
and tigers of Africa: that if I once came into their.
power, I should run a hazard more than a thousand
to one of being killed, and perhaps of being eaten;
for I had heard, that the people of the Caribbean
coast were cannibals, or men-eaters: and I knew
by the latitude, thatI could not be far off from that
shore; that, suppose they were not cannibals, yet
they might kill me, as many Europeans who had
fallen into their hands had been served, even when
they had been ten or twenty together; much more
I that was but one, and could make little. or no de-
fence. All these things, I say, which I ought to have
considered well of, and did cast up in my thoughts
afterwards, yet took up none of my apprehensions
at first; and my head ran mightily upon the thought
Of getting over to that shore.

Now I wished for my boy Xury, and the long-
boat, with the shoulder-of-mutton sail, with which
I sailed above a thousand miles on the coast of
Africa; but this was in vain. Then I thought I
would go and look at our ship's boat, which, as I
have said, was blown up upon the shore, a great
way, in the storm, when we were first cast away.
She lay almost where she did at first, but not quite;
and was turned, by the force of the waves and the
winds, almost bottom upwards, against a high ridge
of beachy rough sand, but no water about her, as
before.

If I had had hands to have refitted her, and to
have launched her into the water, the boat would
have done well enough, and I might have gone
back into the Brasils with her easily enough: but I
might have easily foreseen that I could no more
turn her, and set her upright upon her bottom,than
1 could remove the island. However, I went to
the woods, and cut levers and rollers, and brought
them to the boat, resolved to try what I could do,
suggesting to myself, that if I could but turn her
down, I might easily repair the damage she had
received, and she would be a very good boat, and I
might go to sea in her very easily.

I spared no pains indeed in this piece of fruitless
toil, and spent, I think, three or four weeks about
it; at last, finding it impossible to heave it up with
my little strength, I fell to digging away the sand
to undermine it, and so to make it fall down, set-
ting pieces of wood to thrust and guide it right in '
the fall.

But when I had done this, I was unable to stir
' it up again, or to get under it, much less to move
it forward towards the water; so I was forced to
give it over: and yet, though 1 gave over the hopes
of the beat, my desire to venture over for the main
increased, rather than decreased, as the means for it
seemed impossible.

This at length set me upon thinking, whether it
was not possible to make myself a canoe, or pcria-
gua, such as the natives of those climates make;
even without tools, or, as I might say, without
hands; viz. of the trunk of a great tree. This I not
only thought possible, but easy; and pleased my.
self extremely with the thoughts of making it, and
with my having much more convenience for it than
any of the Negroes or Indians, but not .at all-con-
sidering the particular inconveniences which I lay
under more than the Indians did. viz. want of hands
to move it into the water, when it was made: a
difficulty much harder for me to surmount, than all
the consequences of want of tools could be to them;
for what was it to me,- that when I had chosen a
"cast tree in the woods, I might with great trouble
cut it down, if after I might be able with my tools
to hew and dub the outside into the proper shape
of a boat, and burn or cut out the inside to make it
hollow, so to make a boat of it, if, after all this, I
must leave it just where I found it, and was not
able to launch it into the water?

One would have thought, I could not have had
the least reflection upon my mind of my circum-
stance, while I was making this boat, but I should
have immediately thought how 1 should get it into
the sea; but my thoughts were so intent upon my
voyage over the sea in it, that I never once con-
sidered how I should get it off the land; and it
was really, in its own nature, more easy for me to
guide it over forty-five miles of sea than about
forty-live fathom of land, where it lay, to set it afloat
in the water.

I went to work upon this boat the most like a
fool that ever man did who had any of his senses
awake. I pleased myself with the design, without
determining whether I was ever able to undertake
it: not but that the difficulty of launching my boat
eame often into my head; but I put a stop to my
own inquiries into it, by this foolish answer, which I
gave myself: ' Let me iirst make it, I'll warrant
I'll find some way or other to get it along, when it
is done.'

This was a most preposterous method; but the
eagerness of my fancy prevailed, and to work I
went, and felled a cedar-tree. I question much
whether Solomon ever had such a one for the build-
ing the temple at Jerusalem: it was five feet ten
inches diameter, at the lower part next the stamp,
and four feet eleven inches diameter, at the end
of twenty-two feet; after which, it lessened for a
while, and then parted into branches. It was not
without infinite labour that I felled this tree. I
was twenty days hacking and hewing at it at the
bottom: I was fourteen more getting the branches
and limbs, and the vast spreading head of it cut
0"; which I hacked and hewcd through with my
axe and hatchet, and inexpressible labour. After
this it cost me a month to shape it, and dub it to a
proportion, and to something like the bottom of a
boat, that it might swim upright as it ought to do.
It cost me near three months more to clear the in-
side, and work it out so as to make an exact boat of
it. This I did indeed without fire, by mere mallet
and chisel, and by the dint of hard labour, till I
had brought it to be a very handsome periagua, and
big enough to have carried six-and-twenty men, and
consequently big enough to have carried me and all
my cargo.

When I had gone through this work, I was ex-
tremely delighted with it. The boat was really
much bigger than I ever saw a canoe, or periagua,
that was made of one tree, in my life : many a weary
stroke it had cost, you may be sure, and there
remained nothing but to get it into the water; and
had I gotten it into the water, I make no question
but I should have begun the maddest voyage, and
the most unlikely to be performed, that ever was
undertaken.

But all my devices to get. it into the water failed
me, though they cost me infinite labour too: it lay
about one hundred yards from the water, and not
more; but the first inconvenience was, it was up hill
towards the creek. Well, to take away this disc
couragement, I resolved to dig into the surface of
the earth, and so make a declivity. This I began,
and it cost me a prodigious deal of pains: but
who grudge pains, that have their deliverance in
view? But when this was worked through, and
this difficulty managed, it Was still much at one;
for I could no more stir the canoe, than I could the
other boat.

Then 1 measured the distance of ground, and re.
solved to cut a dock, or canal, to bring the water
up to the canoe, seeing I could not bring the canoe
down to the water. Well, I began this work, and
when I began to enter into it, and calculated how~'

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 135

deep it was to be dug, how broad, how the stuff was
to be thrown out, I found that, by the number of
hands I had, being none but my own, it must have
been ten or twelve years before I should have gone
through with it; for the shore lay high, so that at
the upper end it must have been at least twenty
feet deep; so at length, though with great reluc-
tancy, I gave this attempt over also. ,

This grieved me heartily; and now I saw, though
too late, the folly of beginning a work before we
count the cost, and before we judge rightly of our
own strength to go through with it.

In the middle of this work, I finished my fourth
year in this place, andkept my anniversary with the
same devotion, and with as much comfort, as ever
before; for by a constant study, and serious appli-
cation of the word of God, and by the assistance of
his grace, I gained a different knowledge from what
I had before. I entertained different notions of
things. I looked now upon the world as a thing
remote, which I had nothing to do with, no expecta-
tion from, and indeed no desires about; in a word,
I had nothing indeed to do with it, nor was ever
like to have, so I thought it looked, as we may per-
haps look upon it hereafter, viz. as a place I had
lived in, but was come out of it ; and well might I
say, as father Abraham to Dives, ' Between me and
thee is a great gulf fixed.'

In the first place, I was removed from all the
wickedness of the world here. I had neither the
' lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye, nor the pride
of life.' I had nothing to covet; for I had all I
was now capable of enjoying: I was lord of the
whole manor, or, if I pleased, I might call myself
king or emperor over the whole country which I
had possession of. There were no rivals. I had
no competitor; none to dispute sovereignty or com-
mand with-me. I might have raised ship-loadings
of corn, but. I had no use for it, so I let as little
grow as I thought enough for my occasion. I had'r'r-o'

- c VN'W -

136 ROBINSON CRUSOE.

tortoises or turtles enough; but now and then one
was as much as I could put to any use. I had
timber enough to have built a fleet of ships. 1 had
grapes enough to have made wine, orto have cured
into raisins, to have loaded that fleet when they had
been built.

But all I could make use of, was all that was
valuable. I had enough to eat, and to supply my
wants, and what was all the rest to me? If I killed
more flesh than I could eat, the dog must eat it, or
the vermin; if I sowed more corn than I could eat,
it must be spoiled. The trees that I cut down were
lying to rot on the ground, I could make no more
use of them than for fuel; and that I had no occa-
sion for, but to dress my food.

In a word, the nature and experience of things
dictated to me, upon just reflection, that all the
good things of this world are no farther good to
us, than they are for our use; and that whatever
we may heap up indeed to give others, we enjoy as
much as we can use, and no more. The most co-
vetous, griping miser in the world would have been
cured of the vice of covetousness, if he had been
in my case ; for I possessed infinitely more than I
knew what to do with. I had no room for desire,
except it was of things which I had "not, and they
were but trifles, though indeed of great use to me.
I had, as I hinted before, a parcel of money, as
well gold as silver, above thirtysix pounds sterling.
Alas! there the nasty, sorry, useless stuff lay: I had
no manner of business for it; and I often thought
with myself, that I would have given a handful of
it for a gross of tobacco-pipes, or for a handmill to
grind my corn; nay, I would have given it all for
six-pennyworth of turnip and carrot seed out Of
England, or for a handful of peas and beans, and a
bottle of ink. As it was, I had not the least ad'
vantage by it, or benefit from it; but there it lay ill
a drawer, and grew mouldy with the damp ol' the
cave, in the wet season: and if I had had the

  
    
   
  

. 0r.

l
drawer full of diamonds, it had been the same case;
and they had been of no manner of value to me,
because of no use.

.I had now brought my state of life to be much
easier in itself than it was at first, and much easier
to my mind, as well as to my body. I frequently
- sat down to my meat with thankfulness, and ad-
mired the hand of God's providence, which had thus
spread my table in the wilderness. I learned to look
more upon the bright side of my condition, and less
upon the dark side, and to consider what I enjoyed
rather than what I wanted; and this gave me some-
times such secret comforts, that I cannot express
them, and which I take notice of here to put those
discontented peoPIe in mind of it, who cannot eu-
joy comfortably what God has given them, because
they see and covet something that he has not given
them. All our discontents about what we want,
appeared to me to Spring from the want of thankful-
ness for what we have.

Another reflection was of great use to me, and
doubtless would be so to any one that should fall
into such distress as mine was: and this was to
compare my present condition with what I at first
expected it should be; nay, with whatit would cer-
tainly have been, if the good providence of God had
not wonderfully ordered the ship to be cast up
- nearer to the shore, where I not only could'come at
her, but could bring what I got out of her to the
shore, for my relief and comfort, without which I
had wanted tools to work, weapons for defence, or
gunpowder and shot for getting my food.

I spent whole hours, I may say whole days, in
representing to myself, in the most lively colours,
how I must have acted, if I had got nothing out of
the ship; how I could not have so much as got any
food, except fish and turtles, and that, as it was
long before 1 found any of them, I musthave pe-
rished first; that I should have lived, if I had not
perished, like a mere savage; that, if I had killed a
goat or a fowl, by any contrivance, I had no way
to flay or open them, or part the flesh from the skin
and the bowels, or to cut it up, but must gnaw it
with my teeth, and pull it with my claws, likca
beast.

These reflections made me very sensible of the
goodness of Providence to me, and very thankful
for my present condition, with all its hardships and
misfortunes: and this part also I cannot but recom-
mend to the reflection of those who are apt in their
misery to say, ' Is any aflliction like mine?' Let
them consider how much worse the cases of some
people are, and their case might "have been, if Prev
vidence had thought fit.

I had another reflection which assisted me also to
comfort my mind with hopes; and this was com- :
paring my present condition with what I had (10
served, and had therefore reason to expect from the
hand of Providence. I had lived a dreadful life,
perfectly destitute of the knowledge and fear of
God. I had been well instructed by father and me
ther; neither had they been wanting to me in their .
early endeavours to infuse a religious awe of God
into my mind, a sense of my duty, and of what the
nature and end of my being required of me. But.
alas! falling early into the sea-faring life, which, of
all lives, is the most destitute of the fear of God.
though his terrors are always before them; I say.
falling early into the sea-faring life, and into sea-
faring company, all that little sense of religion
which I had entertained, was laughed out or' me by
my messmates; by a hardened despising of dangers.
and the views of death, which grew habitual to me;
by my long absence from all manner of opportuni-
ties to converse with any thing but what Was like
myself, or to hear any thing that was good, at
tended towards it.

So void was I of every thing that was good, or 0f
the least sense of what I was, or was to be, that in
the greatest deliveranccs I enjoyed, such as I"!
escape from Sallee, my being taken up by the Por-
tuguese master of the ship, my being planted so
well in the Brasils, my receiving the cargo from
England, and the like, I never once had the words
'Thank God' so much as on my mind, or in my
1'mouth ; nor in the greatest distress had I so much
thought as to pray to him; nor so much as to say,
' Lord, have mercy upon me!' no, nor to mention
the name of God, unless it was to swear by: and
blasphemc it.

I had terrible reflections upon my mind for many
months, as I have already observed, on the account
of my wicked and hardened life past; and when I
looked about me, and considered what particular

' providences had attended me since my coming into
this place, and how God had dealt bountifully with
me; had not only punished me less than my ini-
quity deserved, but had so plentifully provided for
me; this gave me great hopes, that my repentance
was accepted, and that God had yet mercies in store
for me.

With these reflections I worked my mind up, not
only to resignation to the will of God, in the pre.
Sent disposition: of my circumstances, but even to a
sincere thankfulness for my condition, and that I,
who was yet a living man, ought not to complain,
seeing I had not the due punishment of my sins;
that I enjoyed so many mercies which I had no
reason to have expected in that place, that I ought
{lever more to ropine at my condition, but to re-
Joice, and to give daily thanks, for that daily bread,
which nothing' but a crowd of wonders could have
brought; that! ought to consider I had been fed
even by a miracle, even as great as that of feeding
Elijah by ravens, nay, by a long series of miracles;
and that I could hardly have named a place in the
uninhabited part of the world where 1 could have
been cast more to my advantage: a place where, as
1 had no society, which was my allliction on one
hand, so I found no ravenous beasts, no furious93"?'7'.'.~".',?~. "ft-33.1339 $fo-t-m*:ww 33". -w .-- nix! ow. - .-.-.- -m -' -

1-10 . ROBINSON CRUSOE.

Wolves or tigers, to threaten my life; no venomous
creatures or poisonous, which I might have fed on
to my hurt, no savages to murder and devour me.

In a word, as my life was a life of sorrow one way,
so it was a life of mercy another; and I wanted
nothing to make it a life of comfort, but to be able
to make my sense of God's goodness to' me, and care
over me in this condition, my daily consolation:
and after I made a just improvement of these things,
I went away and was no more sad.

I had now been here so long, that many things
which I brought on shore for my help were either
quite gone, or very much wasted, and near spent.

My ink, as I observed, had been gone for some
time, all but a very little, which I eked out with
water a little and a little, till it was so pale it scarce
left any appearance of black upon the paper. As
long as it lasted, I made use of it to minute down
the days of the month on which any remarkable
thing happened to me: and first, by, casting up
times past, I remember that there was a strange
concurrence of days, in the various providences
which befall me, and which, if I had been supersti-
tiousl y inclined to observe days as fatal or fortunate,
I might have had reason to have looked upon with
a great deal of curiosity.

First, I had observed that the same day that I
broke away from my father and my friends, and ran
away to Hull, in order to go to sea, the same day
afterwards I was taken by the Sallee man of war,
and made a slave.

The same day of the year that I escaped out of
the wreck of that ship in Yarmouth Roads, that same

~ day of the year afterwards I made my escape from

Sallee in the boat.

The same day of the year I was born on, viz. the
30th of September, the same day I had my life so
miraculously saved twenty-six years after, when I
was cast on shore in this island: so that my wicked

life, and solitary life, began both on a. day.3"

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 141

l The next thing to my ink's being wasted, was
that of my bread, I mean the biscuit which I brought
out of the ship. This I had husbanded to the last
degree, allowing myself but one cake of bread a.
day, for above a year; and yet I was quite without
bread, for near a year, before I got any corn of my
own: and great reason 1 had to be thankful that I
had any at all, the getting it being, as has been
already observed, next to miraculous.

My clothes too began to decay mightily. As to
linen, I had none at good while, except some check
shirts which I found in the chests of the other sea-
men, and which I carefully preserved, because many
times I could bear no other clothes on but a shirt;
and it was a very great help to me that I had
among all the men's clothes of the ship almost
three dozen of shirts. There were also several thick
watch-coats of the seamen, which were left indeed,
but they were too hot to wear; and though it is
true, that the weather was so violent hot, that there
was no need of clothes, yet I could not go quite
naked, no, though I had been inclined to it, which I
was not, nor could I abide the thoughts of it, though
I was all alone. .

' One reason why I could not go quite naked, was,

' I could not bear the heat of the sun so well when
- quite naked, as with some clothes on, nay, the very

heat frequently blistered my skin; whereas, with a
shirt on, the air itself made some motion, and-
whistling under that shirt, was twofold cooler than
without it. No more could I ever bring myself to

' go out in the heat of the sun without a cap or a

hat, the heat of the sun beating with such violence
as it does in that place, would give me the head.
ach presently, by darting so directly on my head,
without a cap or a hat on, so thatI could not bear
It; whereas, if I put on my hat, it would presently
go away.

Upon these views I began to consider about put-

.' ting the few rags I had, which I called clothes, into' "I"

142 ROBINSON CRUSOE.

some order. I had worn out all the waistcoatsl
had, and my business was now to try if I could not
make jackets out of the great watch-coatswhichl
had by me, and with such other materials. as I had;
so I set to work a tailoring, or rather indeed:
botching, for I made most piteous work of it.
Hotvever, I made shift to make two or three new
waistcoats, which I hoped would serve me a great
while ; as for breeches or drawers, I made but very
sorry shift indeed, till afterwards.

I have mentioned that I saved the skins of all
the creatures that I killed, I mean the four-footed
ones; and I had hung them up stretched out with
sticks in the sun, by which means some of them
were so dry and hard, that they were fit for little, -
but others were very useful. The first thing I made
of these was a great cap for my head, with the hair
on the outside to shoot off the rain; and this I pet.
formed so well, that, after this, I made me a suit of
clothes, wholly of those skins; that is to say, I
waistcoat and breeches, Open at knees, and both
loose; for they were rather wanting to keep me .
cool, than to keep me warm. I must not omit to
acknowledge, that they were wretchedly made; for
if I was a bad carpenter, I was a worse tailor.
However, they were such as I made a very good
shift with, and when I was abroad, if it happened
to rain, the hair of the waistcoat and cap being ouk
most, I was kept very dry.

After this I spent a great deal of time and pains
to make me an umbrella: I was indeed in great
want of one, and had a great mind to make one. I
had seen them made in the Brasils, where they aft
very useful in the great heats which are there ; and
I felt the heats every jot as great here, and greater
too, being nearer the equinox; besides, as I was
obliged to be much abroad, it was a most useful -
thing to me, as well for the rains as the heats. I
took a world of pains at it, and was a great while
before I could make any thing likely to hold; 113}:
after I thought I had hit the way, I spoiled two or
threebefore I had made one to my mind: but, at last,
I made one that answered indifferently well. The
main difficulty I found was to make it to let down.
I could make it to spread; but if it did not let
down too, and draw in, it would not be portable for
me any way but just over my head, which would
not do. However, at last, as I said, I made one to
answer: I covered it with skins, the hair upwards,

. so that it cast off the rain like a penthouse, and
kept oi? the sun so effectually, that I could walk
out in the hottest of the weather, with greater ad-
vantage than I could before in the coolest; and
when I had no need of it, I could close it, and carry
it under my arm. .

Thus I lived mighty comfortably, my mind being
entirely composed, by resigning to the will of God,
and throwing myself wholly upon the disposal of
his providence. This made my life better 'than so-
ciable; for when I began to regret the want of con-
versation, 1 would ask myself, whether thus convers-
ing mutually with my own thoughts, and, as I hope
I may say, with even my Maker, by ejaculations and '
petitions, was not better than the utmost enjoyment
of human society in the world?

I cannot say that after this, for five years, any ex-

.' tl'aordiiiary' thing happened to me; but I lived on
In the same course, in the same posture and place,
Just as before. The chief thing I was employed in,
besides my yearly labour of planting my barley and
rice, and curing my raisins, of both which I always
kept up just enough to have sufficient stock of one
.b'ear's provisions before-hand; I say, besides this
yearly labour, and my daily labour of going out
with my gun,I had one labour to make me a canoe,
which at last I finished. So that by digging a canal
to it six feet wide, and four feet deep, I brought it
into the creek, almost half a mile. As for the first,
that was so vastly big, as I made it without con-
sndering before-hand, as I ought to do, how I should
be able to launch it; so never being able to bring it
to the water, or bring the water to it, I was obliged
to let it lie where it was, as a memorandum to teach
me to be wiser next time. Indeed the next time,
though I could notget a tree proper for it, and was
in a place where I could not get the water to it, at
any less distance than, as I have said, of near half
a-mile, yet as I saw it was practicable at last,I
never gave it over; and though I was near two
years about it, yet I never grudged my labour, in
hopes of having a boat to go off to sea in at last.

However, though my little periagua was finished;
yet the size of it was not at all answerable to the
design which I had in view, when I made the first;
I mean of venturing over to the term firma, where
it was above forty miles broad: accordingly, the
smallness of my boat assisted to put an end to that
design, and now I thought no more of it. But asi
had a boat, my next design was to make a tour
round the island; for as I had been on the other
side in one place, crossing, as l have already de<<
scribed it, over the land, so the discoveries I made
in that journey made me very eager to see other
parts of the coast; and now I had a boat, I thought
of nothing but sailing round the island.

For this purpose, and that I might do every thing
with discretion and consideration, I fitted up a little
mast to my boat, and made a sail to it out of some
of the pieces of the ship's sails, which lay in store:
and of which I had a great stOck by me.

' Having fitted my mast and Sail, and tried the boat.
I found she would sail very well. Then I made
little lockers or boxes at either end of my boat, to
put provisions, necessaries, and ammunition, 65c.
into, to be kept dry. either from rain, or the spray
of the sea, and a little long hollow place I cut in
the inside of the boat, where I could lay my gun,
making a flap to hang down over it to keep it dry.

I fixed my umbrella also in a step at the stern>>

like a mast, to stand over my head, and keep the
heat of the sun off me, like an awning; and thus

I every now and then took a little voyage upon the
' sea, but never went far out, nor far from the little

creek ; but at last, being eager to view the circum-

ference of my little kingdom, I resolved upon my
tour, and accordingly I victualled my ship for the
voyage, putting in two dozen of my loaves (cakes

I should rather call them) of barley bread, an earth-

en pot full of parched rice, a food I eat a great

deal of, a little bottle of rum, half a goat, and
powder and shot for killing more, and two large
watch-coats, of those which, as I mentioned before,

I had Saved out of the seamen's chests; these I

took, one to lie upon, and the other to cover me in

the night.

It was the 6th of November, in the sixth year of
my reign, or my captivity, which you please, that I
set out on this voyage, and 1 feund it much longer
than 1 expected; for though the island itself was
not very large, yet when Icame to the east side of
it, I found a great'ledge ofrrocks lie out above two
leagues into the sea, some above water, some under
it; and beyond that a shoal of sand, lying dry,- half
a league more, so that I was obliged to go a great
way out to sea to double that point.

When I first discovered them, I was going to give
over my enterprise, and come back, not knowing
how far it might oblige me to go out to sea, and,
above all,doubting how I should get back again; so
I came to anchor, for I had made me a kind of an

_ anchor, with a piece of a broken grappling, which I
. gOt out of the ship.

Having secured my boat, I took my gun, and went
' on shore, climbing upon a hill, which seemedito
Overlook that point, where I saw the full extent of
it, and resolved to venture.

In my viewing the sea from that hill where I
5'00". I perceived a strong, and, indeed, a most
furious current, which ran to the east, and even
came close to the point; and I took the more no' -

II
tice of it, because I saw there might be some dan-
ger, that when I came into it, I might be carried
out to sea by the strength of it, and not be able to
make the island again; And indeed, had I not got
ten first up upon this hill, I believe it would have
been so; for there was the same current on the
'other side of the island, only that it set off at a
farther distance, and I saw there was a strong eddy
under the shore; so I had nothing to do but to get
in out of the first current, and I should presently
be in an eddy.

I lay here, however, two days; because the wind.
blowing pretty fresh (at E. S. E. and that being
just contrary to the said current), made a great
breach of the sea upon the. point; so that it was
not safe for me to keep too close to the shore for
the breach, nor to go too far off because of the
stream.

The third day in the morning, the wind having
abated over night, the sea was calm, and I ven-
tured; butI am a warning-piece again to all rash
. and ignorant pilots ; for no sooner was I come to the
point, when even I was not my boat's length from
the shore, but I found myself in a great depth of
water, and a current like the sluice of a mill. Il
carried my boat along with it with such 'violence.
that all I could do, could not keep her so much as
on the edge of it; but I found it hurried me fur-
ther and farther out from the eddy, which was on
the left hand. There was no wind stirring to help
me, and all that I could do with my paddles signified
nothing: and now I began to give myself over fol
lost; for, as the current was on both sides of the island.
I knew in a few leagues distance they must join
again, and then I was irrecoverably gone, nor didI
see any possibility of avoiding it; so that I had no
prospect before me but of perishing, not by the sea: .
for that Was calm enough, but of starving for hun'
ger. I had indeed found a tortoise on the shore,8s
big almost as I could lift, and had tossed it into the
boat; and I had a great jar of fresh water, that is
to say, one of my earthen pots: but what was all
this to being driven into the vast ocean, where, to be
sure, there was no shore, no mainland or island,
for a thousand leagues at least?

And now I saw how easy it was for the providence
of God to make the most miserable condition that
mankind could be in, worse. Now I looked back
upon my desolate solitary island, as the most plea-
sant place in the world; and all the happiness my
heart could wish for, was to be but there again. I
stretched out my hands to it with eager wishes. ' 0
happy desert,' said, I, ' I shall never see thee more!
0 miserable creature,' said I, ' whither am I going ?'
Then I reproached myself with my unthankful tem-
per, and how I had repined at my solitary con-
dition, and now what would I give to be on shore
there again? Thus we never see the true state of
our condition, till it is illustrated to us by its con-
traries; nor know how to value what we enjoy, but
by the want of it. It is scarce possible to imagine
the consternation I was now in, being driven from
my beloved island (for so it appeared to me now to
. be) into the wide ocean, almost two leagues, and in
the utmost despair of ever recovering it again.
However, I worked hard, till- indeed my strength
was almost exhausted, and kept my boat as much to
the northward, that is, towards the side'of the cur.
rent which the eddy lay on, as possibly I could.
When about noon, as the sun passed the meridian, I
thought I felt a little breeze of wind in my face,
springing up from 'the S. S. E. This cheered my
heart a little, and especially when in about half an
hour more it blew a pretty small gentle gale. By
this time I was gotten at a frightful distance from
the island, and had the least cloud or hazy weather
intervened,I had been undone another way too; for
I had no compass on board, and should never have
known how to have steered towards the island, if I
had but once lost sight of it: but the weather con.
tinuing clear, I applied myself to'get up my mast
again, and spread my sail, standing away to the
north, as much as possible, to get out of the cur-
rent.

Just as I had set my mast and sail, and the boat
began to stretch away, I saw, even by the clearness
of the water, some alteration of the current was
near; for where the current was so strong, the
Water was foul; but perceiving the water clear, I
found the current abate, and presently I found to
the east, at about half a mile, a breach of the sea
upon some rocks; these rocks I found caused the
current to part again, and as the main stress of it
ran away more southerly, leaving the rocks to the
north-east, so the other returned by the repulse of
the rock, and made a strong eddy, which ran back
again to the north-west, with a very sharp stream.

They who know what it is to have a reprieve
brought to them upon the ladder, or to be rescued
from thieves just going to murder them, or who
have been in such-like extremities, may guess what .
my present surprise of joy was, and how gladly!
put my boat into the stream of this eddy; and, .
the wind also freshening, how gladly I- spread my
sail to it, running cheerfully before the wind, and
with a strong tide or eddy under foot.

.This eddy carried me about a league in my way .
back again, directly towards the island, but about
two leagues more towards the northward than the
current lay, which carried me away at first 5 so that
when I came near the island, I found myself open
to the northern shore of it, that is to say,.the
other end of the island, opposite to that which I
went out from.

When I had made something more than a league '
of way, by the help of this current or eddy, I found
it was spent, and served me no farther. However.
1 found that being between the two great currentS:
viz. that on the south side, which had hurried me
away, and that on the north, which lay about twoRo'emson censors. 149

leagues on the other side; 1 say, between these
two, in the west of the island, I found the water at
least still, and running no way; and having still a
breeze of wind fair for me, I kept on steering di-
rectly for the island, though not making such fresh
way as I did before.

About four o'clock in the evening, being then
within about a league of the island, I found the
point of the rocks which occasioned this disaster
stretching out, as is described before, to the south-
ward, and casting off the current more southwardly,
had, of course, made another eddy to the north;
and this I found very strong, but not directly set-
ting the way my course lay, which was due west,
but almost full north. However, having a fresh
gale,I stretched across this eddy, slanting north-west,
and in abont an hour came within a mile of the shore,
where, it being smooth water, I soon got-to land.

When I was on shore, I fell on my knees and
' gave God thanks for my escape, resolving to lay
aside all thoughts of my deliverance by my boat;
and refreshing myself with such things as I had, I
brought my boat close to the shore, in a little cove
that I had espied under some trees, and laid me
down to sleep, being quite spent with the labour
and fatigue of the voyage.

I was now at a great loss which way to get home
with my boat. I had run so much hazard, and
knew too much the case, to think of attempting it
. by the Way I went out; and what might be at the
other side (I mean the west side), I knew not, nor
had I any mind to run any more ventures: so I
only resolved in the morning to make my way west-
ward along the shore, and to see if there was no
creek, where I might lay up my frigate in safety, so
as to have her again, if I wanted her. In about.
three miles, or thereabouts, coasting the shore, I
came to a very good inlet, or bay, about a mile
over, which narrowed till it came to a very little
rivulet or brook, where I found a convenient har-
hour for my boat, and where she lay as if she had
been in a little dock made on purpose for her:
here I put in, and having stowed my boat very safe,
I went on shore to look about me, and see where
I was.

I soon found I had but a little passed by the
place where I had been before, when I travelled on
foot to that shore; so taking nothing out of my
boat, but my gun and my umbrella, for it was ex-
ceeding hot, I began my march. The way was com-
fortable enough after such a voyage as I had been
upon, and I reached my old bower in the evening,
where I found every thing standing as I left it'; for
I always kept it in good order, being, as I said be.
fore, my country house.

I got over the fence, and laid me down in the
shade to rest my limbs; for I was very weary, and
fell asleep. But judge you, if you can, that read
my story, what surprise I must be in, when I was
awaked out of my sleep, by a voice calling me by
my name several times, ' Robin, Robin, Robin
Crusoe! poor Robin Crusoe ! Where are you, Re
bin Crusoe? Where are you? Where have you
been?'

I was so dead asleep at first, being fatigued with
rowing, or paddling as it is called, the first part Of
the day, and with walking the latter part, that I did
not awake thoroughly, and dozing, between sleeping
and waking, thought I dreamed that somebody
spoke to me. But as the voice continued to repeflI
' Robin Crusoe! Robin Crusoe!' at last I began to
awake more perfectly, and was at first dreadfullf
frighted, and started up in the utmost constet-
nation. But no sooner were my eyes open, butl
saw my I'oll sitting on the top of the hedge, and
immediately knew thatit'was he that spoke to me;
for just in such'bemoauing language I had used to
talk to him, and teach him; and he had learncdit '
so perfectly, that he would sit upon my finger, and
lay his bill close to my face, and cry, ' Poor Robin
Crusoe! Where are you? Where have you been?
How came you here?' and such things as I had
taught him.

However, even though I knew it was the parrot,
and that indeed it could be nobody else, it was a.
good while before 1 could compose myself. First, I
was amazed how the creature got thither, and then
how he should just keep about the place, and no
where else. But as I was well satisfied it could be
nobody but honest Poll, I got over it; and holding
out my hand, and calling him by his name, ' Poll,'
'the sociacle creaturo' came to me, and sat upon my
thumb, as he used to- do, and continued talking to
me, ' Poor Robin Crusoe!' and how did 1 come
here, and where had I been, just as if he had been
overjoyed to see me again; and so I" carried him
home along with me.

I had now had enough of rambling to sea for
some time, and had enough to do for many days to
sit still, and reflect upon the danger I had been in.
I would have been very glad to have had my boat
again on my side of the island; but I knew not how
it was practicable to get it about. As to the east
side of the island, which I had gone round, I knew
well enough there was no venturing that way: my
very heart would shrink, and my very blood run
chill, but to think of it. And as to the other side
of the island, I did not know how it might be
there; but supposing the current ran with the
same force against the shore at the east, as it passed
by it on the other, I might run the same risk of
being driven down the stream, and carried by the
island, as I had been before of being carried away
from it; so with these thoughts I contented myself
to be without any boat, though it had been the
product of so many months' labour to make it, and-

of so many more to get it into the sea.

In this government of my temper I remained near
a year, lived a very sedate, retired life, as you may
well suppose: and my thoughtsbeing very mucls
composed as to my condition, and fully comforted
in resigning myself to the dispositions of Provi-
dence, I thought I lived really very happily in all
things, except that of society.

I improved myself in this time in all the me-
chanic exercises which my necessities put me upon
applying myself to; and, I believe, could, upon
occasion, have made a very good carpenter, espe-
cially considering how few tools I had.

Besides this, I arrived at an unexpected perfec.
tion in my earthen-ware, and contrived well enough
to make them with a wheel, which I found infinitely
easier and better; because I made things round and
shapeable, which before were filthy things indeed to
look on. But I think I never was more vain of my
own performance, or more joyful for any thing!
found out, than for my being-able to make a to-

. bacco-pipe; and though it was a very ugly, clumsy
thing, when it was done, and only burnt red like
other earthen-ware, yet, as it was hard and firm, and
would draw the smoke, I was exceedingly com-

forted with it; for I-had been always used to .

smoke, and there were pipes in the ship, but I

forgot them at first, not knowing that there was .

tobacco in the island; and afterwards, when I
searched the ship again, I could not come at any
pipes at all.

In my wicker-ware I also improved much, and
made abundance of necessary baskets, as well as my
invention showed me, though not very handsome.
yet they were such as were very handy and con-
venient for my laying things up in, or- fetching
things home in. For example, if I killed a goat
abroad, I could hang it up in a tree, (lay it, and
dress it, and cut it in pieces, and bring it home in
a basket; and the like by a turtle, I could cut it
up, take out the eggs, and a piece or two of the

flesh, which was enough for me, and bring them :

home in a basket, and leave the rest behind me.
Also large deep baskets were my receivers for myn..-

com, which 1 always rubbed out as soon as it was
dry and cured; and keptit in great baskets,instead
of a granary.

I began now to perceive my powder abated con.
siderably, and this was a want which it was impos~
sible for me to supply, and I began seriously to
consider whatl must do when I should have no
more powder; that is to say, how I should do to
kill any goats. I had, as I observed in the third
year of my being herehkept a young kid, and bred
her up tame. I was in. hopes of getting a lie-kid ;
but I could not, by any means, bring it to pass, till
my kid grew an old goat, and I could never find in
my heart to kill her, till she died at last of mere
age.

But, being new in the eleventh year of my resi-
dence, and as I have said, my ammunition growing
low, I set myself to study some art to trap and
snare the goats, to see Whether I could not catch
some of them alive; and particularly I wanted a
she-goat great with young.

To this purpose I made snares to hamper them,
and I do believe they were more than once taken in
them; but my tackle was not good, for I had no
wire, and I always found them broken, and my bait
devoured.

At length I resolved to try a pit-fall; so I dug
several large pits in the earth. in places where I
had observed the goats used to feed, and over these
pits I placed hurdles of my own making too, with
a great weight upon them; and several times I put
ears of barley and dry rice, without setting the
trap, and I could easily perceive that the goats had
gone in, and eaten up the corn, for 1 could see the
mark of their feet. At length, I set three traps in
one night, and, going the next morning ,I found
them all standing, and yet the bait eaten and gone.
This was very discouraging . however, I altered
my traps: and, not to trouble you with particulars,
80mg one morning to see my traps, I found in one

H 2
of them a large old hegoat; and, in one of the
others, three kids, a male and two females.

As to the old one, I knew not what to do with
him: he was so fierce I durst not go into the pit
to him; that is to say, to go about to bring him
away alive, which was what I wanted. I could
have killed him, but that was not my business, nor
would it answer my end; so I even let him out,
and he ran away as if he had been frighted out of
his wits; but I had forgot then, what I learned
afterwards, that hunger will tame a lion. If I had
let him stay there three or four days without food,
and then have carried him some water to drink, and p
then a little corn, he would have been as tame as
oneof the kids; for they are mighty sagacious,
tractable creatures, when they are well used.

However, for the present I let him go, knowing
no better at that time; then I went to the three
kids, and, taking them one by one, I tied them with
strings together, and with some difiiculty brought
them all home.

It was a good while before they would feed ; but
throwing them some sweet corn, it tempted them,
and they began to be tame. And now I found.
that if I expected to supply myself with goat-flesh,
when I had no powder or shot left, breeding
some up tame was my only way, when perhapsl
might have them about .my house like a flock of
sheep.

But then it presently occurred to me, that I must
keep the tame from the wild", or else they would
always run wild when they grew up ; and the only
way for this was to have some enclosed piece 0f
ground. well fenced either with hedge or pale, to
keep them up so effectually, that those within
might not break out, or those without break in.

This was a great undertaking for one pair of
hands; yet, as I saw there was an absolute neccs'
sity of doing it, my first piece of work was to find
out a proper piece of ground; viz. where there was
likely to be herbage for them to eat, water for them
to drink, and cover to keep them from the sun.

Those who understand such enclosures will think
I had very little contrivancc, when I pitched upon
a place very proper for all these, being a plain Open
piece of meadow land, or saVanua (as our people
Call it in the western colonies), which had two 'or
three little drills of fresh water in it, and at oneend
was very woody; I say, they will smile at my fore.
cast, when I shall ,tell them I began my enclosing
of this piece of ground in such a manner, that my
hedge or pale must have been at least two miles
about: nor was the madness of it so great as to the
compass; for if it was ten miles about, I was like to
have time enough to do it in, but I did not consider
that my goats would be as wild in so much compass,
as if they had had the whole island; and I should
have so much room to chase them in, that I should
never catch them. .

My hedge was begun and carried on, I believe,
about fifty yards, when this thought occurred to
me; so I presently stopped short, and, for the first
beginning, I resolved to enclose a piece of about
one hundred and fifty yards in length, and one hun.
dred yards in breadth, which, as it would maintain
as many as I should have in any reasonable time,
so, as my flock increased, I could add more ground
to my enclosure. ' ,

This was acting with some prudence, and I went
to work with courage. I was about three months
hedging in the first piece, and, till I had done it, I
tethered the three kids in the best part of it, and.
used them to feed as near me as possible, to make
them familiar; and very often I would go and carry
them some cars of barley, or a handful of rice, and
feed them out of my hand, so that, after my enclo-
sure was finished, and I let them loose, they would
follow me up and down, bleating after me for a
handful of corn.

This answered my end, and in about a year and a-
half I had a flock of about twelve goats, kids and
all; and in two years more I had three-andforty,
besides several that I took and killed for my food:
and after that .I enclosed five several pieces of
ground to feed them in, with little pens to drive
them into. to take them asI wanted them; and
gates out of one piece of ground into another.

But this was not all; for now I not only had
goat's flesh to feed on when I pleased, but milk too;
a thing which indeed in the beginning I did not so
much as think of, and which, when it came into
my thoughts, was really an agreeable surprise: for
. now I set up my dairy, and had sometimes a gallon
or two of milk in a day. And as nature, who gives
supplies of food to every creature, dictates even
naturally how to make use of it; so I, that never
milked a cow, much less a goat, or saw butter or
cheese made, very readily and handily, though after
a great many essays and miscarriages, made me
both butter and cheese at last, and never wanted it
afterwards.

How mercifully can our great Creator treat his
creatures, even in those conditions in which they
seemed to be overwhelmed in destruction! How
can he sweeten therbitterest providences, and give
us cause to praise him for dungeons and prisons!
What a table was here Spread for me in a wilder-
ness, where I saw nothing at first but to perish for
hunger!

It would have made a Stoic smile to have seen
me and my little family sit down to dinner. There
Was my majesty, the prince and lord of the whole
island. I had the lives of all my subjects at my
absolute command: I could hang, draw, give
liberty, and take it away, and no rebels among all
my subjects.

Then to see how like a king I dined too, all
alone, attended by my servants! Poll, as if he had
been my favourite, was the only person permitted
to talk to me: my dog, who was now grown very
' old and crazy, and had found no species to multiply
his kind upon, sat always at my right hand; and
two cats, one on one side the table, and one on the
other, expecting now and then a bit from my hand,
as a mark of special favour. '

But these were not the two cats which I brought
on shore at first; for they were both of them dead,
and had been interred near my habitation by my
own hands; but one of them having multiplied by
I know not what kind of creature, these were two
which I had preserved tame, whereas the rest ran
wild in the woods, and became indeed troublesome
to me at last; for they would often come into my
house, and plunder me too, till at last I was obliged
to shoot them, and kill a great many; at length
they left me with this attendance. And in this plen-
tiful manner I lived; neither could I be said to want
any thing but society, and of that, in some time
after this, I was like to have too much.

was something impatient, as I before observed,

to have the use of my boat, though very loath to
run any more hazards; and therefore sometimes I
sat contriving ways to get her about the island, and
at other times I sat myself down contented enough
without her. But I had a strange uneasiness in
my mind to go down to the point of the island,
where, as I have said, in my last ramble, I went
up the hill to see how the shore lay, and how the
current set, that I might see what I had to do.
This inclination increased upon me every day, and
at length I resolved to travel thither by land ; and
following the edge of the shore, I did so: but had
any one in England been to meet such a man as I
was, it must either have frighted him, or. raised a
great deal of laughter; and as I frequently stood
still to look at myself, I could not but smile at the
notion of my travelling through Yorkshire with such
an equipage, and in sucha dress. Be pleased to
take a sketch of my figure as follows:

I had a great, high, shapeless cap, made of a
goat's skin, with a flap hanging down behind, as
well to keep the sun from me, as to shoot the rain
ofl' from running into my neck; nothing being so
hurtful' 1n these climates, as the rain upon the flesh
under the clothes.

I had a short jacket of goat's skin, the skirts
coming down to about the middle of my thighs;
and a pair of open knee'd breeches of the same:
the breeehes we1e made of the skin of an old he-
goat, whose hair hung down such a length on either
side, that, like pantaloons, it reached to the middle
of my legs. Stockings and shoes I had none; butI
had made me a pair of something, I scarce knew
what to call them, like buskins, to flap over my legs.
and lace on either side like spatterdashes, but of 11-;
most barbarous shape, as indeed we1e all the rest of
my clothes.

I had on a broad belt of goat' 5 skin dried, which
I drew together with two thongs of the same, in-
stead of buckles; and, in a kind of a frog, on either
side of this, instead of a sword and a dagger, hung
a little saw and a hatchet, one on one side, one on
the other. I had another belt not so broad, and
fastened in the same manner, which hung over my
shoulder, and at the end of it, under my left arm.
hung two pouches, both made of goat's skin' too:
in one of which hung my powde1, in the other my
shot. At my back I carried my basket, on my
shoulder my gun, and over my head a great, clumsy.
ugly.' goat skin umbrella, but which, after all, was
the most necessary thing I had about me, next to
my gun. As for my face, the colour of it was really
not so Mulatto-like as one might expect from a
man not at all careful of it, and living within nine
or ten degrees of the equinox. My beard I had !
once suffered to grow till it was about a quarter of
a yard long; but as I had both scissars and razor-'1 1
sufficient, 1 had cut it p1etty short, except what
grew on my upper lip, which I had trimmed into a '
large pair of Mahometan whiskers, such as 1 had
seen worn by some Turks, whom I saw at Sallee;
for the Moors did not wear such, though the Turks
did. Of these mustachioes, or. whiskers, I will not
say they were long enough to hang my hat upon
them; but they were of a length and shape mon-
strous enough, and such as in England would have
passed for frightful.

But all this is by the bye: for as to my figure, I
had so few to observe me, that it was of no manner
of consequence; so I say no more to that part.
In this kind of figure I went my new journey, and
was out five or six days. I travelled first along the
sea-shore, directly to the place where I first brought
my boat to anchor, to get up upon the rocks; and,
having no boat now to take care of, I went over
the land a nearer way, to the same height that I
was upon before, when looking forward to the point
of the rocks which lay out, and which I was to
double with my boat, as I said above, I was sur-
prised to see the see all smooth and quiet: no rip.
pling, no motion, no current, any more there than
in other places.

I was ata strange loss to understand this, and
resolved to spend some time in observing it, to see
if nothing from the sets of the tide had occasioned
it. But I was presently convinced how it was, viz.
that the tide of ebb setting from the west, and join-
ing with the current of waters from some great river
on the shore, must he the occasion of this current;
and that, according as the wind blew more forcibly
from the west, or from the north, this current came
near, or went farther from the shore; for, waiting
thereabouts till evening, I went up to the rock again,
and then the tide of ebb being made, I plainly saw
the current again as before, only that it ran farther
03'. being near half a league from the shore; whereas,
in my case, it set close upon the shore, and hurried
me in my canoe along with it, which at another
time it would not have done.

This observation convinced me, that I had nothing

. .'n. ._r ._..4__ __.._-.__M'.m<mm
to do but to observe the ebbing and the flowing of
the tide, and I might very easily bring my heat
about the island again: but when I began to think
of putting it in practice, I had such a terror upon
my spirits at the remembrance of the danger I had
been in, that I could not think of it again with any
patience; but, on the contrary, I took up another
resolution, which was more safe, though more labo-
rious, and this was, that I would build, or rather
make me another periagun, or canoe, and so have
one for one side of the island, and one for the
other. '

You are to understand that now I had, as I may
call it, two plantations in the island; one, my little
fortification or tent, with the wall about it under
the rock, with the cave behind 'me, which, by this
time I had enlarged into several apartments or caves,
one within another. One of 'these, which was the
driest and largest, and had a door out beyond my
wall or fortification, that is to say, beyond where
my. wall joined to the rock, was all filled up with
large earthen pots, of which I have given an account,
and with 'fourteen or fifteen great baskets, which
would hold five or six bushels each, where I laid
up my stores of provision, especially my corn, some
in the ear cut 011' short from the straw, and the
other rubbed out with my hand. -

As for my wall made, as before. with long stakes
or piles, those piles grew all like trees, and were
by this time grown so big, and Spread so very much,
that there was not the least appearance, to any one's
view, of any habitation behind them.

Near this dwelling of mine, but a little farther
within the land, and upon lower ground, lay my
two pieces of corn-ground, which I kept duly cul-
tivated and sowed, and which duly yielded me their
harvest in its season; and whenever I had occasion
for more com, I had more land adjoining as fit as
that. '

Besides this, I had my country seat, and I had
now a tolerable plantation there also. For, first,I
had my little bower, as I called it, which I kept in
repair; that is to say, I kept the hedge which circled
it in, constantly fitted up to its usual height, the
ladder standing always in the inside. I kept the
trees, which at first were no more than my stakes,
but were now grown very firm and tall; I kept
them always so cut, that they might spread and
grow thick and wild. and make the more agreeable
shade, which they did effectually to my mind. In
the middle of this,l had my tent always standing,
being a piece of a sail Spread over poles set up for
that purpose, and which never wanted any repair or
renewing; and under this I had made me a squab
or couch, with the skins of the creatures I had
killed, and with other soft things, and a blanket
laid on them, such as belonged to our sea-bedding,
which I had saved, and a great watch-coat to cover
me: and here, whenever I had occasion to be ab-
sent from my chief seat, I took up my country
habitation.

Adjoining to this, I had my enclosures for my
cattle, that is to say, my goats: and as I had taken
an inconceivable deal of pains to fence and enclose
this ground, I was so uneasy to see it kept entire,
lost the goats should break through, that I never
left off, till, with infinite labour, lhad stuck the
outside of the hedges so full of small stakes, and so
near to one another, that it was rather a pale than
a hedge, and there was scarce room to put a hand
through between them; which afterwards, when
those stakes grew, as they all did in the next rainy
season, made the enclosure strong, like a wall, in-
deed stronger than any wall.

This will testify for me that I was not idle, and
that I spared no pains to bring to pass whatever
appeared necessary for my comfortable support, for
1 considered the keeping up a breed of tame crea-
tures thus at my hand, would be a living magazine
of flesh, milk, butter, and cheese for me, as long as
I lived in the place, if it were to be forty years; and
that keeping them within my reach, depended en-
tirely upon my perfecting my enclosures to such a
degree, that I might be sure of keeping them toge-
ther; which by this method indeed I so effectually
secured, that when these little stakes began to
grow, I had planted them so very thick, I was forced
to pull some of them up again.

In this place also I had my grapes growing, which _
I principally depended on for my winter-score of
raisins, and which I never failed to preserve very
carefully, as the best and most agreeable dainty of
my whole diet; and indeed they were not agreeable
only, but physical, wholesome, nourishing, and re-
freshing to the last degree.

As this was also about half way between my other
habitation and the place where I had laid up my
boat, I generally staid and lay here in my way
thither; for I used frequently to visit my boat, and
I kept all things about or belonging to her in very
good order. Sometimes I went out in her to divert
myself; but no more hazardous voyages would I
go, nor scarce ever above a stone's cast or two from
the shore, I was so apprehensive of being hurried
out of my knowledge again by the currents, or
winds, or any other accident. But now I come to
a new scene of my life.

It happened one day about noon, going towards
my boat, I was exceedingly surprised with the print
of aman's naked foot on the shore, which was very
plain to be seen in the sand. I stood like one thun-
derstruck, or as if I had seen an apparition. I
listened, I looked round me ; I could hear nothing:
nor see any thing. I went up to a rising ground to
look farther. I went up the shore, and down the
shore, but it was all one; I could see no other im-
pression but that one. I went to it again to see if
there were any more, and to observe if it might
not be my fancy ; but there was no room for that;
for there was exactly the very print of a foot, toes:
heel, and every part of a foot: how it came thither,
I knew not, nor could in the least imagine. But
after innumerable fluttering thoughts, like a. man
perfectly confused and out of myself, I came home
to my fortification, not feeling, as we say, the
ground I went on, but terrified to the last degree,
looking behind me at every two or three steps, mis-
taking every bush and tree, and fancying every
stump at adistance to be a man. Nor is it possible
to describe how many various shapes an afi'righted
imagination represented things to me in; how many
wild ideas were formed every moment in my fancy,
and what strange unaccountable whimsies came into
my thoughts by the way.

When I came to my castle, for so I think I called
it ever after this, I fled into it like one pursued:
whether I went over by the ladder, as first contrived,
or went in at the hole in the rock, which I called a.
door, I cannot remember; for never frighted hare
fled to cover, or fox to earth, with more terror of
mind than I to this retreat.

I had no sleep that night. The farther I was from
the occasion of my fright, the greater my apprehen-
sions were; which is something contrary to the
nature of such things, and especially to the usual
practice of all creatures in fear. But I was so em.
barrassed with my own frightful ideas of the thing,
that I formed nothing but dismal imaginations to
myself, even though I was now a great way off it.
Sometimes I fancied it must be the devil; and rea-
son joined in with me upon this supposition: for
how should any other thing, in human shape, come
into the place? Where was the vessel that brought
them? What marks were there of any other foot-
steps? And how was it possible a man should come
there? But then ,to think that Satan should take
human shape upon him in such a place, where there
could be no manner of occasion for it, but to leave
the print of his foot behind him, and that even for
no purpose too (for he could not be sure I should
see it), this was an amazement the other way. I
considered that the devil might have found out
abundance of other ways to have terrified me, than
this of the single print of a foot: that as I lived
quite on the other side of the island, he would
never have been so simple to leave a mark ina
place where it was ten thousand to one whether I
should ever see it or not, and in the sand too,
which the first surge of the sea, upon a high wind,
would have defaced entirely. All this seemed in-
consistent with the thing itself, and with all no-
tions we usually entertain of the subtilty of the
devil. '

Abundance of such things as these assisted to

argue me out of _all apprehensions of its being the
devil: and I presently concluded then, that it must
be some more. dangerous creature; viz. that it must
be some of the savages of the mainland over
against me, who had wandered out to sea in their
canoes, and. either driven by the currents, or by
contrary winds, had made the island; and had
been on shore, but were gone away again to sea,
being as loath, perhaps, to have staid in this de-
solate island, as I would have been to have had
them. .
. While these reflections were rolling upon my
mind, I was very thankful in my thoughts, that I
was so happy as not to be thereabouts at that time,
or that they did not see my boat, by which they
would have concluded, that some inhabitants had
been in the place, and perhaps have searched far-
ther for me. Then terrible thoughts racked my in)>>
giuation about their having found my boat, and that
there were people here; and that, if so, 1 should
certainly have them come again in greater numbers,
and devour me; that if it should happen so that
they should not find me, yet they would find my
enclosure. destroy all my corn, carry away all my
flock of tame goats, and'I should perish at last for
mere want.
Thus my fear banished all my religious hope; all
that former confidence in God, which was founded
upon such wonderful experience as I had had of his
goodness, now vanished; as if he that had fed me
by miracle hitherto, could not preserve by his power
the provision which he had made for me by his
goodness. I reproached myself with my easiness,
that would not sow any more com one year than
would just serve me till the next season, as if no
accident could intervene to prevent my enjoying the
Crop that was upon the ground ; and this I thought
so just a reproof. that I resolved for the future to
have two or three years' corn before-hand; so that
whatever might come, I might not perish for want
of bread.

How strange a checkenwork of Providence is the
life of man! and by what secret different springs
are the affections hurried about, as difi'erent cir-
cumstances present! Today we. love what to-mor-
row we hate: to-day we seek what tomorrow we
, shun: today we desire what tomorrow we fear;
nay, even tremble at the apprehensions of. This
was exemplified in me, at this time, in the most
lively manner imaginable ; for I, whose only afflic-
tion was, that I seemed banished from human-so-
ciety; that I was all alone, circumscribed by the
boundless ocean, cut off from mankind, and con-
demned to what I call silent life; that I was as one
whom Heaven thought not worthy to be numbered '
among the living, or to appear among the rest of
his creatures; that to have seen one of my own
Species, would have seemed to me 3 raising me
from death to life, and the greatest blessing that
Heaven itself, next to the supreme blessing of sal-
vation, could bestow; I say, that I should now
tremble at the very apprehensions of seeing a man,
and was ready to sink into the ground at but the
shadow, or silent appearance of a man's having set
his foot on the island.

Such is the uneven state of human life; .and it
afi'orded me a great many curious speculations after-
wards, when I had a little recovered my first sur-
prise. I considered that this was the station of life,
the infinitely wise and good providence of God had
determined for me; that as I could not foresee
what the ends of Divine wisdom might be in all this,
so I was not to dispute his sovereignty. who, as I
was his creature, had an undoubted right, by crea~
tion, to govern and dispose of me absolutely as he
thought fit; and who, as I was a creature who had
offended him, had likewiSe a judicial right to con.
demn me to what punishment he thought fit; and
that it was my part to submit to hear his indignation,
because I had sinned against him. '

I then reflected that God, who was not only
righteous, but omnipotent, as he had thought fit thus
to punish and amict me, so he was able to deliver
me; that if he did not think fit to do it, it was my
unquestioned duty to resign myself absolutely and
entirely to his will: and, on the other hand, it was
my duty also to hope in him, pray to him, and
quietly to attend the dictates and directions of his
daily providence.

These thoughts took me up many hours, days;
nay, I may say, weeks and months; and one par-
ticular effect of my cogitations on this occasion, I
cannot omit; viz. one morning early, lying in my
bed, and filled with thoughts about my danger from
the appearance of savages, I found it decomposed
me very much; upon which those words of the
Scripture came into my thoughts, "Call upon me in
the day of trouble, and I will deliver thee, and thou
shalt glorify me.'

Upon this, rising cheerfully out of my bed, my
heart was not only comforted,' but I was guided
and encouraged to pray earnestly to God for de-
liverance. When I had done praying, I took up
my Bible. and opening it to read, the first words
that presented to me were ' Wait on the Lord, and
be of good cheer, and he shall strengthen thy heart;
'wait, I say, on the Lord.' It is impossible to express
"the comfort this gave me: and in return I thankfully
laid down the book, and was no more sad, at least
not on that occasion.

In the middle of these cogitations, apprehensions,
and-reflections, it came into my thoughts one day,
that all this might be a mere chimera of my own,
and that this foot might be the print of my own
foot, when I came on shore from my boat. This
cheered me up a little too, and I began to persuade
myselfxit was all a delusion; that it was nothing
else but my own foot; and why might not I come
that way from the boat, as well as I was going that
way to the boat? Again, I considered also, that I
could by no means tell for certain where I had trod,
and where I had not ; and that if at last this was
only the print of my own foot, "I had played the
part of those fools, who strive to make stories of
spectres and apparitions, and then are themselves
frighted at them more than any body else.

Now I began to take courage, and to peep abroad
again: for I had not stirred out of my castle for
three days and nights, so that I began to starve for
provision, for I had little or nothing within doors,
but some barley cakes and water. Then I knew
that my goats wanted to be milked too, which
usually was my evening diversion; and the poor
creatures were in great pain and inconvenience for
want of it, and indeed it almost spoiled some of
them, and almost dried up their milk.

. Heartening myself therefore with the belief, that
this was nothing but the print of one of my own
feet (and so I might be truly said to start at my
own shadow), I began to go abroad again, and went
to my country house to milk my flock; but to see
with what fear I went forward, how often I looked
behind me, how I was ready, every now and then',
to lay down. my basket, and run for my life, it
would have made any one have thought I was
haunted with an evil conscience, or that I had
been lately most terribly frighted; and so indeed
I had.

However, as I went on thus two or three days,
and had seen nothing, I began to be a little bolder.
and to think there was really nothing in it but
my own imagination; but I could not persuade
myself fully of this, till I should go down to the
shore again, and see this print of a foot, and mea-
sure it by my own, and see if there was any simi-
litude or fitness, that I might be assured it was my
own foot. But when I came to the place first, it
appeared evidently to me, that when I laid up my
boat, I could not possibly be on shore any where
thereabouts; Secondly, when I came to measure
the mark with my own foot, I found my foot not
so large by a great deal: both these things filled my
head with new imaginations, and gave me the va-
pours again to the highest degree, so that I shoot
with cold, like one in an ague, and I went home
again, filled with the belief that some man or men
had been on shore there; or, in short, that the
island was inhabited, and I might be surprised be-
fore I was aware; and what course to take for my
security, I knew not.

0 what ridiculous resolutions men take, when
possessed with fear! It deprives them of the use
of those means which reason offers for their relief.
The first thing I proposed to myself was, to throw
down my enclosures, and turn all my tame cattle
wild into the woods, that the enemy might not find
them, and then frequent the island in prospect 0f
the same, or the like booty; then the simple thinfl
of digging up my two corn fields, that they might
not find such a grain there, and still be prompted
to frequent the island; then to demolish my bower
and tent, that they might not see any vestiges 0'
habitation, and be tempted to look farther, in ordel
to find out the persons inhabiting. .

These were the subjects of the first night's cog!-
tation, afterI was come home again, while the ap'
prehensions which had so over-run my mind were
fresh upon .me, and my head was full of vapours,
as above. Thus fear of danger is ten thousand
times more terrifying than danger itself when 'ap.
parent to the eyes; and we find the burden of
anxiety greater by much, than. the evil which we
are anxious about; but. which was worse than all
this, I had not that relief in this trouble from the
resignation I used to practise, that I hoped to have.
I looked, I thought, like Saul, who complained not
only that the I'hilistiues were upon him, but that
God had forsaken him: for I did not now take due
ways to compose my mind, by crying to God in my
distress, and resting upon his providence, as I had
done before, for my defence and deliverance; which
if I had done, I had, at least, been more cheerfully
suPported under this new surprise. and perhaps car-
ried through it with more resolution. ,
This confusion of my thoughts kept me waking all
night; but, in the morning, I fell asleep, and hav-
ing, by the amusement of my mind, been, as it were,
tired,and my spirits exhausted, I slept very soundly,
' and awaked much better composed than I had ever
been before. And now I began to think sedately ;
and, upon the utmost debate with myself, I con-
cluded, that this island, which was so exceeding
pleasant, fruitful, and no farther from the main land
than as I had seen, was not so entirely abandoned
as I might imagine; that although there were no
stated inhabitants who lived on this Spot, yet that
there might sometimes come boats off from the
shore, who either with design, or perhaps never but
whenvthey were driven by cross winds, might come
to this place: that I had lived fifteen years now, and
had not met with the least shadow or figure of any
peOpIe before ; and that if at any time they should
be driven here, it was probable they went away
again as soon as ever they could, seeing they had
never thought lit to fix there, upon any occasion, to

this time: that the most I could suggest any dan-
I
ger from, was, from any such caSual accidental land-
ing of straggling people from the main; who, as it
was likely, if they were driven hither, were here
against their wills, so they made no stay here, but
went off again with all possible speed, seldom stay-
ing one night on shore, lest they should not have
the help of the tides and daylight back again; and
that therefore I had nothing to do but to consider
of some safe retreat, in case I should see any savages
land upon the spot.

Now I began sorely to repent, that I had dug my
cave so large as to bring a door through again,
which door, as I said, came out beyond where my
fortification joined to the rock. Upon maturely
considering this, therefore, I resolved to draw me a
second fortification, in the same manner of a semi.
circle, at a distance from my wall, just where I had
planted a double row of trees, about twelve years
before, of which I made mention. These trees hav-
ing been planted so thick before, there wanted but a
few piles to be driven between them, that they should
be thicker and stronger, and my wall would be soon

finished.
So that I had now a double wall, and my outer

wall was thickened with pieces of timber, old cables;
and every thing I could think of to make it strong;
having in it seven little holes about as big asI
might put my arm out at. In the inside of this I
thickened my wall to about ten feet thick, con-
tinually bringing earth put of my cave, and laying it
at the foot of the wall, and walking upon it; and
through the seven holes I contrived to plant the
muskets, of which I took notice that I got seven on
shore out of the ship; these, I say, I planted like
my cannon, and fitted them into frames that held
them liken carriage, that so I could fire all the seven
guns in two minutes' time. This wall I was many
a weary month in finishing, and yet never thought
myself safe till it was done. '
When this was done, I stuck all the ground with-
out my wall, for a great way every way, as full with
stakes or sticks of the osier-like wood, which I found
so apt to grow, as they could well stand; insomuch
that I believe I might set in near twenty thousand
of them, leaving a pretty large space between them
and my wall, that I might have room to see an
enemy, and they might have no shelter from the
young trees if they attempted to approach my outer
wall.

Thus, in two years' time,I had a thick grove;
and, in five or six years' time, I had a wood before
my dwelling grown so monsrrous thick and strong
that it was indeed perfectly impassable: and no
man, of what kind soever, would ever imagine that
there was any thing beyond it, much less a habi-
tation. As for the way I proposed to myself to go
in and out (for I left no avenue), it was by setting
two ladders; one to a part of the rock which was
low, and then broke in, and left room to place
another ladder upon that; so when the two ladders
were taken down, no man living could come down
to me without mischiefing himself; and if they
had come down, they were still on the outside of
my outer wall.

Thus I took all the measures human prudence
could suggest for my own preservation; and it will
be seen, at length, that they were not altogether
without just reason, though I foresaw nothing at
that time, more than my mere' fear suggested to
me.

While this was doing, I was not altogether care-
less of my other affairs ; for I had a great concern
Upon me for my little herd of goats: they were not
only a present supply to me upon every occasion,
and began to be sufficient to me, without the ex-
pense of powder and shot, but also abated the fa-
tigue of my hunting after the wild ones; and I was
loath to lose the advantage of them, and to have
them all to nurse up-over again.

To this purpose, after long consideration, I could.
think of but two ways to preserve them: one was
to find another convenient place to dig a cave under
ground, and to drive them intovit every night; and
the other was to enclose two or three little bits of
land, remote from one another, and as much con-
cealed as I could, where I might keep about half a
dozen young goats in each place, so that if any dis-
aster happened to the flock in general, I might be
able to raise them again with little trouble and time:
and this, though it would require a great deal of
time and labour, I thought was the most rational
design.

Accordingly I spent some time to find out the
most retired parts of the island; and I pitched upon
one which was as. private indeed as my heart could
wish; for it was a little damp piece of ground in
the middle of the hollow and thick woods, where, as
is observed, I almost lost myself once before, en-
deavouring to come back that way from the eastern
part of; the island. Here I found a clear piece of
land, nearthree acres, so surrounded with woods,
that it was almost an enclosure by nature; at least
it did not want near so much labour to make it
so, as the other pieces of ground I had worked so
hard at. ' ,

I immediately went to work with this piece of
ground ; and, in less than a month's time, I had so
fenced it round, that my flock or herd, call it which
you please, which were not so wild now as at first
they might be supposed to be, were well enough
secured in it. So, without any farther delay, I re-
moved ten she-goats and two hc.goats to this piece;
and when they were there, I continued. to perfect
the fence, till I had made it as secure as the other,
which, however, I did at more leisure, and it took
me .up more time by a great deal.

All this labour I was at the expense of, purely
from my apprehensions on the account of the print
of a man's foot' which I had seen; for as yetI
never saw any human creature come near the island;
and I had now lived two years under these uneasi-
nesses, which indeed made my life much less com-
fortable than it was before, as may well be imagined
by any who know what it is to live in the constant
snare of the fear oftman: and this I must observe
with grief too, that "the discomposnre of my mind
had too great impressions also upon the religious
part of my thenghts; for the dread and terror of
falling into the. hands of savages and cannibals'lay
so upon my spirits, that I seldom found myself in
a due temper for application to my Maker, at least
not with. the sedate calmness and resignation of
soul which I was wont to do. 1 rather, prayed to
God as under great affliction and pressure of mind,
surrounded with danger, .and in expectation every
night of being murdered and devoured before morn-
ing ; and I must testify, from my eiperience, that a
temper of peace, thankfulness, love, and affection,
is much the more proper frame for prayer, than that
of terror and discomposure; and that under the
dread of mischief impending, a man is no more fit
for a comforting performance of the duty of praying
to God, than he is for repentance on a sick bed;
for these discomposures all'ect the mind as the others
do the body; and the discomposure of the mind
must necessarily be as greata disability as that of
the body, and much greater, praying to God being
prOperly an act of the mind, not of the body.

But to go on: after I had thus secured one part
of my little living stock, I went about the whole
island, searching for another private place, to make
such another deposit; when wandering more to the
West point of the island than I had ever done yet,
and looking out to sea, I thought I saw a baat upon
the sea, at a great distance. I had found a perspec-
tive glass or two, in one of the seamen's chests
which I saved out of our ship, but I had it not

'about me, and this was so remote that I could not
tell what to make of it, though I looked' at it till
my 9-585 were not able to- hold to look any longer.
Whether it was a boat or not, I do not know; but
as I descended from the hill, I could see no more
of it, so I gave it over; only I resolved to go no
more without a perspective glass in my pocket.

When I was come down the hill, to the end of the
island, where indeed I had never been before, I was
presently convinced that the seeing the print of a
man's foot was not such a strange thing in the
island as I imagined; and, but that it was a special
providence that I was cast upon the side of the
island where the savages never came, I should
easily have known that nothing was more frequent
than for the canoes from the main, when they hap-
pened to be a little too far out at sea, to shoot over
to that side of the island for harbour; likewise, as
they often met, and fought in their canoes. the
victors, having taken any prisoners, would bring
them over to this shore, where, according to their
dreadful customs, being all cannibals, they would
kill and eat them. Of which hereafter.

When I was come down the hill to the shore, as
I said above, being the S. W. point of the island, I
was perfectly confounded and amazed; nor is it
possible for me to express the horror of my mind,
at seeing the shore spread with skulls, hands, feet,
and other bones of human bodies; and particularly
I observed a place where there had been a fire made,
and a circle dug in the earth, like a cockpit, where
it is supposed the savage wretches had sat down to
their inhuman feastings upon the bodies of their fel-
low-creatures.

I was so astonished with the sight of these things,
that I entertained no notions of any danger to my-
self from it for a long while: all my apprehensions
were buried in the thoughts of such a pitch of in
human, hellish brutality, and the horror of the dc-
generacy of human nature, which, though I had
heard of often, yet I never had so near a view of
before; in short, I turned away my face from the
horrid spectacle: my stomach grew sick, and I was
just at the point of fainting, when nature discharged
the disorder from my stomach; and, having voo
' mited with an uncommon violence, I was a little
relieved, but could not bear to stay in the -place a
moment; so I got me up the hill again, with all the
Speed I could, and walked on towards my own ha-
bitation.

When I came a little out of that part of the
island, I stood still a while as amazed; and then
recovering myself, I looked up with the utmost
affection of my soul, and, with a flood of tears in
my eyes, gave God thanks, that had cast my first
lot in a part of the world where I was distinguished
from such dreadful creatur'es as these, and that
though I had esteemed my present condition very
miserable, had yet given me so many comforts in
it, that I had still more to give thanks for, than to
complain of; and this, above all, that I had, even
in this miserable condition, been comforted with
the knowledge of Himself, and the hope of his
blessing, which was a felicity more than sufficiently
equivalent to all the misery which I had suffered,
or could suffer.

,In this frame of thankfulness I went home to my
castle, and began to be much easier now, as to the
safety of my circumstances, than ever I was be-
fore; for I observed that these wretches never
came to this island in search of what they could
get; perhaps not seeking, not wanting, or not ex.
pecting any thing here,- and having often, no doubt,
been up in the covered woody part of it, without
finding any thing to their purpose. I knew I had
been here now almost eighteen years, and never
saw the least footsteps of human creature there be-
fore; and might be here eighteen more as entirely
concealed as I was now, if I did not discover my.
self to them', which I had no manner of occasion to
do ; it being my only business to keep myself entirely
concealed where I Was, unless I found a better sort
0f creatures than cannibals to make myself known to;v'

1'76 ROBINSON CRUSOE.

Yet I entertained such an abhorrence of the
savage wretches that I have been speaking of, and
of the wretched inhuman custom of their devour-
ing and eating one another up, that I continued
pensive and sad, and kept close within my own
circle for almost two years after this. When I say
my own circle, I meanhy it my three plantations,
viz. my-castle, my country scat, which I called my
bower, and my enclosure in the woods; nor did I
look after this for any other use than as an enclo-
sure for my goats: for the aversion which nature '
gave me to these hellish wretches was such that I
was as fearful of seeing them, as of seeing the
devil himself. Nor did I so much as go to look
after my boat in all this time, but began rather to
think of making me another; for I could not think
'of ever making any more attempts to bring the other
boat round the island to me, lest I should meet
with some of those creatures at sea, in which, if I
had happened to have fallen into their hands, I knew
what would have been my lot.

Time, however, and the satisfaction I had thatI
was in no danger of being discovered by these peo-
ple, began to wear ofl" my uneasiness about them ;
and I began to live just in the same composed man-
ner as before; only with this difference, that I used
more caution, and kept my eyes more about me than
1 did before, lest I should happen to be seen by any
oftthem; and particularly I was more cautious in
firing my gun, lest any of them being on the island
should happen to hear it ; and it was therefore a
very good providence to me that I had furnished
myself with a tame breed of goats, that I needed
not hunt any more about the woods, or shoot at
them; and if I did catch any of them after this, it
was by traps and snares, as I had done before: so
that for two years after this, I believe I never (fired
my gun once off ; though I never went out without
.it; and, which was more, as I had saved three piSdeg
tols out of the ship, I always carried them out with
me, or at least two of them, sticking them in my
goat-skin belt: I likewise furbished up one of the
great cutlasses that I had out of the ship, and made
me a belt .to put it on also; so that I was now a
most formidable fellow to look at, when I went
abroad, if you add to the former description of my-
self the particular of two pistols, and a great broad
sword, hanging at my side in a belt, but without a
scabbard. _

Things going on thus, as I have said, for some time,
I seemed, excepting these cautions, to be reduced to
my former calm, sedate way of living. All these
things tended to showing me, more and more, how
far my condition was from being miserable, com-
pared to some others, nay, to many other particulars
of life, which it might have pleased God to have
made my lot. It put me upon reflecting how little
rcpining there would be among mankind, at any
condition of life, if people would rather compare
their condition with those that are worse, in order
to be thankful, than be always comparing them with
those which are better, to assist their mnrmurings
and complainings.

As in my present condition there were not really
many things which I wanted, so indeed I thought
that the frights I had been in about these savage
wretches, and the concern I had been in for my own
preservation, had taken off the edge of my inven-
tion foi' my own conveniences; and I had dropped
a good design, which I had once bent my thoughts
upon, and that was, to try if I could not make some
of my barley into malt, and then try to brew my-
self some beer. This wasreallyawhimsical thought,
and I rcproved myself often for the simplicity of
it; for I presently saw there would be the Want of
several things necessary to the making my beer
that it would be impossible for me to supply; as,
first, casks to preserve it in, which was a thing that,
as I have observed already, I could never compass;

178 ROBINSON CRUSOE.

months, in attempting it, but to no purpose. In
the next place, I had no heps to make it keep, no
yeast to make it work, no copper or kettle to make
it boil; and yet, had not all these things intervened,
I mean the frights and terrors I was in about the
savages, I had undertaken it, and perhaps brought '
it to pass too; for I seldom gave any thing over

. without accomplishing it, when I once had it in my

head enough to begin it.

But my invention now ran quite another way; for
night and day I could think of nothing but how I
might destroy some of these monsters in their cruel
bloody entertainment, and, if possible, save the vic-
tim they should bring hither to destroy. It would
take up a larger volume than this whole work is in-
tended to be, to set down all the contrivancesl
hatched, or rather brooded upon, in my thoughts,
for the destroying these creatures, or at least fright-
ing them, so as to prevent their coming hither any
more; but all was abortive; nothing could be pos-
sible to take effect, unless I was to be there to do
it myself: and what could one man do among them,
when perhaps there might: be twenty or thirty of
them together, with their darts, or their bows and
arrows, with which they could shoot as true to a
mark, as I could with my gun?

Sometimes I contrived to dig a hole under the place
where they made their tire, and put in five or six
pounds ofgunpowder, which, when they kindled their
fire, would consequently take fire, and blow up all
that was near it. But as, in the first place, I should
be very loath to waste so much powder upon them,
my store being now within the quantity of one bar-
rel, so neither could I be sure of its going off, at
any certain time, when it might surprise them, and
at best that it would do little more than just blow
the fire about their ears, and fright them, but not
sufficient to make them forsake the place; so I laid
it aside, and then proposed thatI would place my-
self in ambush, in some convenient place, with my
three guns, all double loaded, and, in the middle
of their bloody ceremony, Jet fly at them, when I
should be sure to kill or wound perhaps two or three
at every shot, and then falling in upon them with
my three pistols, and my sword, I made no doubt
but that if there were twenty, I should kill them all.
This fancy pleased my thoughts for some weeks, and
I was so full of": that I often dreamt of it, and
sometimes that I was just going to let fly at them in
my sleep.

I went so far with it in my imagination, that I
employed myself several days to find out proper
places to put myself in amhuscadc, as I said, to watch
for them; and I went frequently to the place itself,
- which was now grown more familiar to me, and es-
peciall y while my mind was thus filled with thoughts
of revenge, and of a bloody putting twenty or thirty
Of them to the sword, as I may call it; but the
horror I had at the place, and at the signals of the
barbarous wretches devouring one another, abated
my malice.

Well, at length I found a place in the side of the
hill, where I was satisfied I might securely wait
till I saw any of their boats coming, and might then,
even before they would be ready to come on shore,
convey myself unseen into thickets of the trees,
in one of which there was a hollow large enough
to conceal me entirely, and where I might sit, and
observe all their bloody doings, and take my full .
aim at their heads, when they were so close to-
gether as that it would be next to impossible that
I should miss my shot, or thatI could fail wounding
three or four of them at the first shot.

In this place then I resolved to fix my design,
and accordingly I prepared two muskets, and my
ordinary fowling-picce. The two muskets I loaded
with a brace of slugs each, and four or five smaller
bullets, about the size of pistol bullets; and the
fowliug-piece I loaded with near a handful of swan.
"wt, of the largest size. I also loaded my pistols
with about four bullets each: and in this posture,
well provided with ammunition for a second and
third charge, I prepared myself for my expedition.

After I had thus laid the scheme for my design,
and, in my imagination, put it in practice, I con-
tinually made my tour every morning up to the top
of the hill, which was from my castle, as I called it,
about three miles, or more, to see if I could observe
any boats upon the sea, coming near the island, or
standing over towards it; but I began to tire of this
hard duty, after I had for two or three months con-
stantly kept my watch, and come always back with-
out any discovery, there having not in all that time
been the least appearance, not only on or near the
shore, but not on the whole ocean, so far as my eyes .
or glasses could reach every way.

As long as I kept up my daily tour to the hill to
look out, so long also I kept up the vigour of my
design; and my spirits seemed to be all the while in
a suitable frame, for so outrageous an execution as
the killing twenty or thirty naked savages for an
offence which I had not at all entered into a discus-
sion of in my thoughts, any further than my passions
were at first fired by the horrorI conceived at the
unnatural custom of the people of that country;
who, it seems, had been suffered by Providence, in
his wise disposition of the world, to have no other
guide than that of their own abominable and vitiated
passions; and consequently were left, and perhaps
had been so for some ages, to act such horrid things.
and receive such dreadful customs, as nothing but
nature, entirely abandoned of Heaven, and actuated
by some hellish degeneracy, could have run them
into. But now, when, as I have said, I began to
be weary of the fruitless excursion which I had
made so long, and so far,- every morning in vain, so
my Opinion of the action itself began to alter, and
I began, with cooler and calmer thoughts, to con-
sider what it Was I Was going to engage in; what
authority or call I had, to pretend to be judge and
executioner upon these men as criminals, whom

Heaven had thought fit, for so many ages, to suf-

fer, unpunished, to go on, and to be, as it were,

the executioners of his judgements upon one

another; also how far these people were offenders

against me, and what right I had to engage in the

quarrel of that blood, which they shed promiscu-

ously one upon another. I debated this very often '
with myself thus: How do I know what God him-

self judges in this particular case? It is certain

these people do not commit this as a crime: it is

not against their own consciences reproving, or

their light reproaching them. They do not know it

to be an offence, and then commit it in defiance of
Divine justice, as we do in almost all the sins we

commitf They think it no more a crime to kill a,
captive taken in war, than we do to kill an ox; nor

to eat human flesh, than we do to eat mutton.

When I had considered this a little, it followed
necessarily that I was certainly in the wrong in it;
that these people were not murderers in the sense
that I had before condemned them in my thoughts,
any more than those Christians were murderers
who often put to death the prisoners taken in bat-
tle, or more frequently, upon many occasions, put
whole troops of men to the sword, without giving
quarter, though they threw down their arms, and
submitted. '

In the next place it occurred to me, that albeit the
usage they gave one another was.thus brutish and
inhuman, yet it was really nothing to me; that these
people had done me no injury; that if they at-
tempted me, or Isaw it necessary for my immediate
preservation to fall upon them, something might be
said for it; but that I was yet out of their power,
and they had really no knowledge of me, and conse-
tluently no'design upon me; and therefore it could
not be just for me to fall upon them: that this
would justify tlfi conduct of the Spaniards, in all
their barbarities practised in America, where they
destroyed millions of these people, who, however
they were idolaters and barbarians, and had several
bloody and barbarous rites in their customs, such as
sacrificing human bodies to their idols, were yet, as
to the Spaniards, very innocent people; and that
the rooting them out of. the country is Spoken of
with the utmost abhoi'rence and detestation, even
by the Spaniards themselves, at this time, and by all
other Christian nations of Europe, as a mere butch-
ery, and a bloody and unnatural piece of cruelty,
unjustifiable either to God or man; and such, as
for which the very name of a Spaniard is reckoned
to be frightful and terrible to all people of humanity,
or of Christian compassion; as if the kingdom of
Spain were particularly eminent for the product of
a race of men who were without principles of ten-
derness, or the common bowels of pity to the miser-
able, which is reckoned to be a mark of generous
temper in the mind.

These considerations really put me. to a pause, and
to a kind of a full stop; and I began, by little and
little, to be off my design, and to conclude I had
taken wrong measures in my resolutions to attack
the savages; that it was not my business to meddle
with them, unless they first attacked me, and this it
was my business, if possible, to prevent; but that
if I were discovered, and attacked, then I knew my
duty.

0n the other hand, I argued with myself that this
really was the way not to deliver myself, but en-l
tirely to ruin and destroy myself; for unless I was
sure to kill every one that not only should be on
shore at that time, but that should ever come on
shore afterwards, if but one of them escaped to tell
their country people what had happened, they would
come over again, by thousands, to revenge the death
of their fellows ; and 1 should only bring upon my-
self a certain destruction, which at present I had no
manner of occasion for.

' Upon the whole I concluded that neither in with
ciples nor in policy I ought, one way or other, to
concern myself in this attain; that my business
was, by all possible means, to conceal myself from
them, and not to leave the least signal to them to
guess by that there were any living creatures upon
the island; I mean of human shape.

Religion joined in with this prudential resolu-
tion ; and I was convinced' now many ways, that I
was perfectly out of my duty, when I was laying
all my bloody schemes for the destruction of inno-
cent creatures; I mean innocent as to me. As to
the crimes they were guilty of towards one another,
I had nothing to do with them: they were national,
and I ought to leave them to the justice of God,
who is the governor of nations, and knows how to
bring public judgements upon those who offend in
a public manner, by such ways as best please him.

This appeared so clear to me now, that nothing
was a greater satisfaction to me than that I had not
been suffered to do a thing which I now saw so
much reason to believe would have been no less a
sin, than that of wilful murder, ifI had committed
it ; and I gave most humble thanks on my knees to
God, that had thus delivered me from blood-guilti-
ness, beseeching him to grant me the protection of
his providence, that I might not fall into the hands
of barbarians, or that I might not lay my hands
upon them, unless I had a more clear call from Hea-
ven to do it, in defence of my own life.

In this disposition I continued for near a year
after this; and so far was I from desiring an oc-
casion for falling upon these wretches, that in all
that time I never once went up the hill to see
whether there were any of them in sight, or to
know whether any of them had been on shore
there or not, that I might not be tempted to renew
any of .my'contrivances against them, or be pro-
voked by any advantage which might present itself
to fall upon them; only this I did, I went and re-
moved my boat, which I had on the other side of
the island, and carried it down to the east end of
the whole island, where I ran it into a little cove,
which I found under some high rocks, and where I
knew, by reason of the currents, the savages durst
not, at least would not, come with their boats, upon
any account whatsoever.

With my boat, I carried away every thing that I
had left there belonging to her, though not neces-
sary for the bare going thither, viz. a mast and sail,
which I had made for her, and a thing like an an-
chor, but indeed which could not be called either
anchor or grappling: however, it was the best I
could make of its kind. All these I removed, that
there might not be the least shadow of any disco-
very, or any appearance of any boat, or of any hu-
man habitation upon the island.

Besides this, I kept myself, as I said, more re.
tired than ever, and seldom went from my cell,
other than upon my constant employment, via. to
milk my she-goats, and manage my little flock in
the wood, which, as it was on the other part of the
island, was quite out of danger: for certain it is
that these savage people, who sometimes haunted
this island, never came with any thoughts of finding
any thing here, and consequently never wandered
off from the coaSt ; and I doubt not, but they might
have been several times on shore, after my appre-
hensions of them had made me cautious, as well as
before; and indeed I looked back with some hon
ror upon the thoughts of what my condition would
have been, if I had chopped upon them, and been
discovered before that, when naked and unarmed,
except with one gun, and that loaded often only
with small shot. I walked every where peeping and
peering about the island, to see what I could get:
what a surprise should I have been in, if, when I
discovered the print of a man's foot, I had, instead
of that, seen fifteen or twenty savages, and found
them pursuing me, and, by the swiftness of their

running, no possibility of my escaping them..
The thoughts of this sometimes sunk my very
soul within me, and distressed my mind so much
that I could not soon recover it; to think what I
should have done, and how I not only should not
have been able to resist them, but even should not
have had presence of mind enough to do what I
might have done, much less what now, after so
much consideration and preparation, I might be able
to do. Indeed, after serious thinking of these
things, I would be very melancholy, and sometimes
it would last a great while; but i resolved it at
last all into thankfulness to that Providence which
had delivered me from so many unseen dangers,
and had kept me from those mischiefs, which I

could noway have been the agent in delivering my-

self from; because I had not the least notion of
any such thing depending, or the least supposition
of its being possible.

This renewed a contemplation which often had
come to my thoughts in former time, when first I
began to see the merciful diSpositions of Heaven, in
the dangers we run through in this life :'how won-
derfully we are delivered, when we know nothing of
it: how when we are in (a quandary, as we call it)
a doubt or hesitation, whether to go this way, or
that way, a secret hint should direct us this way,
when we intended to go that way ; nay, when sense,
our own inclination, and perhaps business, has called
to go the other way, yet a strange impression upon
the mind, from we know not what springs, and by
we know not what power, shall over-rule us to go
this way 3 and it shall afterwards appear that had
we gone that way which we should have gone, and
even to our imagination ought to have gone, we
Should have been ruined. and lost. Upon these,
and many like reflections, I afterwards made it a
certain rule' with me, that whenever I found those
secret hints, or pressings of my mind, to doing or
not doing any thing that presented, or to going this
Way 01' that way, I never failed to obey the secret
dictate, though I knew no other reason for it, than
that such a pressure, or such' a hint, hung upon my
mind. I could give many examples of the success
of this conduct in the course of my life'; but more
especially in the latter part of my inhabiting this
unhappy island; besides many occasions which it
is very likely I might have taken notice of, if I had
seen with the same eyes then, that I saw with now.
But it is never too late to be wise; andI cannot but
advise all considering men, whose lives are attended
with such extraordinary incidents as mine, or even
though not so extraordinary, not to slight such se-
cretintimations of Providence, let them come from
what invisible intelligence they will, that I shall
not discuss, and perhaps cannot account for; but
certainly they are a proof of the converse of spirits,
and the secret communication between those imbo-
died and those unimbodied, and such a proof as
can never be withstood: of which I shall have oc-
casion to give some very remarkable instances in
the remainder of my solitary residence in this dis-
m'al place.

I believe the reader of this will not think it
strange if I confess that these anxieties, these con.
stant dangers I lived in, and the concern that
was now upon me, put an end to all invention,
and to all the contrivances that I had laid for
my future accomodations and conveniences. I
had the care of my safety more now upon my hands;
than that of my food. I cared not to drive a .nail.
or chop a stick' of wood now, for fear the noiseI
should make should be heard, much less would I
fire a gun for the same reason; and, above all,I
was very uneasy at making any lire, lest the smoke,
which is visible at a great distance in the 633':
should betray me; and for this reason I removed
that part of my business, which required fire, such
as burning of pots and pipes, &c. into my new
apartment in the woods, where, after I had been
some time, I found, to my unsPeakable consolation.
a mere natural cave in the earth, which went in a
vast way, and where, I dare say, no savage, had
he been at the mouth of it, would be so hardy as
to venture in; nor indeed would any man else, but
one who, like me, wanted nothing so much as a safe
retreat.

The mouth of this hollow was at the bottom of
a great rock, where, by mere accident (I would
say, it: I did not see abundant reason to ascribe all
such things now to Providence), I was cutting down
some thick branches of trees, to make charcoal;
and before I go on,I must observe the reason of my
making this charcoal, which was thus :,

I was afraid of making a smoke about my habita-
tion, as I said before; and yet I couldnot live there
Without baking my bread, cooking my meat, &c.; so
I contrived to burn some wood here, as I had seen
done in England under turf, till it became chark, or
dry coal; and then putting the fire out, I preserved
the coal to carry home, and perfOrm the other ser-
vices which fire was wanting for at home, without
danger of smoke.

But this by the bye. While I was cutting down
some wood here, I perceived that, behind a very
thick branch of low brushwood, or underwood, there
was a kind of hollow place. I was curious to look
into it, and getting with difficulty into the mouth of
it, I found it was pretty large, that is to say, suf-
ficient for me to stand upright in it, and perhaps
another with me; but I must confess to you,I made
more haste out than I did in, when looking further
into the place, which was perfectly dark, I saw two
broad shining eyes of some creature, whether devil
or man I knew not, which twinkled like two stars;
the dim light from the cave's mouth shining directly
In, and making the reflection.

However, after some pause, I recovered myself.
and began to call myself a thousand fools, and tell
myself, that he that was afraid to see the devil, was
not [it to live twenty years in an island all alone,
and that I durst to believe there was nothing in this
cave that was more .frightful than myself. Upon
this, plucking up my courage, I took up a great fire.
brand, and in I rushed again, with the stick flaming
in my hand. I had not gone three steps in, hutI
was almost as much frighted as I was before; for I
heard a very loud sigh, like that of a man in some
pain, and it was followed by a broken noise, as if of
words half expressed, and then a deep sigh again. I
stepped back, and was indeed struck with such a
surprise, that it put me into a cold sweat; and ifI
had hada hat on my head, I will not answer for it,
that my hair might not have lifted it off. But still
plucking up my spirits as well as I could, and en.
couraging myself a little, with considering that the
power and presence of God was every where, and
was able to protect me, I stepped forward again,
and, by the light of the firebraud, holding it up a
little over my head, I saw, lying on the ground, a
most monstrous frightful old lie-goat, just making
his will, as we say, gasping for life, and dying indeed
of mere old age.

I stirred him a little, to see if I could get him
out, and he essayed to get up, but was not able to
raise himself: and I thought with myself he might
even he there; for if he had frightcd me so, he would
certainly fright any of the savages, if any of them
should be so hardy as to come in there, while he had
any life in him.

I was now recovered from my surprise, and began
to look round me, when I found the cave was but
very small ; that is to say, it might be about twelve
feet over, but in no manner of shape, either round or
square, no hands having ever been employed in
making it, but those of mere nature. I observed
also, that there was a place at the farther side of it;
that went in farther, but was so low that it required
me to creep upon my hands and knees to go into it,
and whither it went I knew not: so having :10
candle, I gave it over for some time, but resolved
to come again the next day, provided with candles
and a tinder-box, which I had made of the lock of
one of the muskets, with some wildfire in the pan.

Accordingly, the next day, I came provided with six
large candles of my own making, for I made very
good candles now of goat's tallow ; and, going into
this low place, I was obliged to creep upon all fours,
as I have said, almost ten yards, which, by the way,
Ithought was a venture bold enough, considering
that I knew not how far it might go, or what was
beyond it. When I was got through the strait, I
found the roof rose higher up, I believe near twenty
feet; but never was such a glorious sight seen in the
island, I dare say, as it was, to look round the sides
and roof of this vault or cave. The walls reflected
a hundred thousand lights to me from my two can-
dles: what it was in the rock, whether diamonds, or
any other precious stones, or gold, which I rather
supposed it to be, I knew not.

The place I was in, was a most delightful cavity,
or grotto, of its kind, as could be expected, though
perfectly dark: the floor was dry and level, and had
a sort of small loose gravel upon it, so that there
was no nauseous or venemous creature to be seen ;
neither was there any damp or wet on the sides or
root. The only difficulty in it was the entrance,
which, however, as it was a place of security, and
such a retreat as I wanted, I thought that was a
convenience; so that I was really rejoiced at the
discovery, and resolved, without any delay, to bring
some of those things which I was most anxious
about to this place; particularlyl resolved to bring
hither my magazine of powder, and all my spare
arms, viz. two fowling--pieces (for I had three in
all), and three muskets (for of them I had eight in
all); so I kept at my castle only five, which stood
ready mounted, like pieces of cannon, on my out-
most fence, and were ready also to take out upon
any expedition.

Upon this occasion of removing my ammunition,
Iv was obliged to open the barrel of powder which
I took up out of the sea, and which had been wet;
and I found that the water had penetrated about
three or four inches into the powder on every side,
which, caking and growing hard, had preserved the
inside like a kernel in a shell, so that I had near
sixty pounds of very good powder in the centre of
the cask; and this was an agreeable discovery to
me at that time: so I carried all away thither, never

. keeping above two or three pounds of powder with

me in my castle, for fear of a surprise of any kind.
I also carried thither all the lead I had left for
bullets.

I fancied myself now like one of the ancient
giants, which were said to live in caves and holes
in the rocks, where none could come at them; for
I persuaded myself, while I was here, if five hun-
dred savages were to hunt me, they could never find
me out; or if they did, they would not venture to
attack me here.

The old goat, whom I found expiring, died in the
mouth of the cave, the next day after' I made this
discovery; and I found rit'much easier to dig a great
hole there, and throw him in, and cover him with
earth, than to drag him out : so I interred him there,
to prevent offence to my nose.

I was now in my twenty-third year of residence
in.this island, and was so naturalized to the place,
and to the manner of living, that could I have but
enjoyed the certainty that no savages would come
to the place to disturb me, I could have been con-
tent to have capitulated for spending the rest of my
time there, even to the last moment, till I had laid
me down and died, like the old goat in the cave. I
had also arrived to some little diversions and amuse-
ments, which made the time pass more pleasantly
with me a. great deal than it did before ; as, first, I
had taught my Poll, as I noted before, to speak, and
he did it so familiarly, and talked so articulately and
plain, that it was very pleasant to me 3 and he lived

a
with me no less than six-and~twenty years. How
long he might live afterwards I know not; though I
know they have a notion, in the Brasils, that they
live.a hundred years. Perhaps poor Poll may be
alive there still, calling after ' poor Robin Crusoe'
to this day. I wish no Englishman the ill' luck to
come there and hear him; but if he did, he would
certainly believe it was the devil. My dog was a
very pleasant and' loving companion to me for no
less than sixteen years of my time, and then died
of mere old age. As for my cats, they multiplied,
as I have observed, to that degree, that I was
obliged to shoot several of them at first, to keep
them from devouring me, and all I had; but at
length, when the two old ones I brought with me
were gone, and after some time continually driving
them from me, and letting them have no provision
with me, they all ran wild into. the woods, except
two or three favourites, which I kept tame, and
whose young, when they had any, I always drown-
ed 3 and these were "part of my family. Besides
these, I always kept two or three household kids
about me, which I taught to feed out of my hand;
and I had some more parrots, which talked pretty
well, and would all call ' Robin Crusoe,' but none
like my first; nor, indeed, did I take the pains with
any of them that I had done with him. I had also
several tame sea fowls, whose na'mes I know not,
which I caught upon the shore, and cut their wings;
and the little stakes, which I had planted before my
castle wall, being now grown up to a good thick
grove, these fowls all lived among these low trees,
and bred there, which was very agreeable to me; so
that, as I said above, I began to be very well con-
tented with the life I led, if it might but have been
secured from the dread of the savages.

But it was otherwise directed; and it may not be
amiss for all people who shall meet with my story,
to make this just observation from it ; viz. how fre-
qucntly, in the course of our lives, the evil, which
in itselfwe seelr most to shun, and which, when we
are fallen into, is the most dreadful to us, is often-
times the very means or door of our deliverance, by
which alone we can be raised again from the amic-
tion we are fallen into. I could give many examples
of this in the course of my unaccountable life; but
in nothing was it more particularly remarkable than
in the circumstances of the last years of my solitary
residence in this island.

It was now the month of December, as I said
above, in.my twenty-third year; and this being the
southern solstice, for winter I cannot call it, was the
particular time of my harvest, and required my
being pretty much abroad in the fields; when going
out pretty early in the morning, even before it was
thorough daylight, I was surprised with seeing a
light of some fire upon the shore, at a distance from
me of about two miles, towards the end of the
island where I had observed some savages had
been as before; but not on the other side, but, to
my great affliction, it was on my side ofthe island.

. I was indeed terribly surprised at the sight, and
stopped short within my grove, not daring to go out,
lest [might be surprised; and yet I had no more peace
within, from the apprehensions I had that if these
savages in rambling over the island, should find my
corn standing, or cut, or any of my works and im-
provements, they would immediately conclude, that
there were people in the place, and would then never
give over till they found me out. In this extremity
I went back directly to my castle, pulled up the lad-
der after me, having made all things without look as
wild and natural as I could.

Then I prepared myself within, putting myself in
a posture of defence. I loaded all my cannon, asl
called them, that is to say, my muskets, which
were mounted upon my new fortification, and all
my pistols, and resolved to defend myself to tho
last gasp ; not forgetting seriously to commend my-
self to the Divine protection, and earnestly to prae'
to God to deliver me out of the hands of the bar.
barians: and in this posture I continued about two
hours, but began to be mighty impatient for intelli-
gence abroad, for I had no spies to send out.

After sitting awhile longer, and musing what I -
should do in this case, I was not able to bear sitting
in ignorance longer; so setting up my ladder to the
side of the hill, where there was a flat place, as I
observed before, and then pulling the ladder up
after me. I set it up again, and mounted to the top
of the hill; and pulling out my perspective glass,
which I had taken on purpose, I laid me down flat
on my belly on the ground, and began to look for
the ,place. I presently found there were no less
than nine naked savages sitting round a small the
they had made; not to warm them, for they had no
need of that, the weather being extreme hot, but,
as I supposed, to dress some of their barbarous diet
of human flesh, which they had'bronght with them,
whether alive or dead, I could not know.

They had two canoes with them, which they had
hauled up upon the shore; and as it was then tide
of cbb, they seemed to me to wait the return of the
flood to go away again. It is not easy to imagine
what confusion this sight put me into, especially
seeing them come on my side the island, and so
near me too; but when I observed their coming
must be always with the current of the ebb, I began
afterwards to be more sedate in my mind, being
Satisfied that! might go abroad with safety, all the
time of tide of flood, if they were not on shore be-
fore; and having made this observation, I went
abroad about my liarvesbwork with the more com-
posure.

. As I expected, so it proved; for as soon as the
tide made to the westward, I saw them all take
boat, and row (or paddle, as we call it) all away. I
should have observed, that for an hour and more
before they went 01?, they went to dancing, and I

could easily discern their postures and gestures by
K
my glasses: I could not perceive, by my nicest ob-
servation,but that they were, stark naked, and had
not the least covering upon them; but whether they
were men or women, that I could not distinguish.

As soon as I saw them shipped and gone, I took
two guns upon my shoulders, and two pistols at
my girdle, and my great sword by my side, without
. a scabbard, and with all the speed I was able to
make, I went away to the hill, where I had dis-
covered the first appearance of all. As soon as I
got thither, which was not less than two hours (for
I could not go apace, being so loaden with arms as
I was), I perceived there had been three canoes
more of savages on that place; and looking out fur-
ther, I saw they were all at sea together, making
over for the main. .

This was a dreadful sight to me; especially when
going down to the shore, I could see the marks of
horror which the dismal work they had been about
had left behind it, viz. the blood, the bones, and" part
of the flesh of human bodies, eaten and devoured
by those wretches with merriment and sport. I
was so filled with indignation at the' sight, that
I began now to premeditate the destruction of the
next thatI saw there, let them be who or how many
soever. -

It seemed evident to me, that the visits which
they thus made to this island, were not very fre-
quent; for it Was above fifteen months before any
more of them came on shore there again; that is
to say, I never saw them, or any footsteps or signals
of them, in all that time: for, as to the rainy sea-
sons, then they are sure not to come abroad, at
least not so far; yet all this while I lived uncom-
fortably, by reason of the constant apprehensions I
was in of their coming upon me by surprise: from
whence I observe, that the expectation of evil is
more bitter than the suffering, especially if there is
no room to shake off that expectation, or those ap-
prehensions.
During all this time, I was in the murdering hu-
mour; and took up most of my hours, which should
have been better employed, in contriving how to
circumvent and fall upon them the very next time
I should see them, especially if they should be
divided,as they were at the. last time. into two par.
ties: nor did I consider at all. that if I killed one
party, suppose ten or a dozen, l was still the next
day, or week, or month, to kill another, and so
another, even ad infinitum, till I should be at
length no less a murderer than they were in being
man-eaters, and perhaps much more so.

I spent my days now in great prrplexity and
anxiety of mind, expecting that I should one day or
other fall into the hands of these merciless crea-
tures. If I did at any time venture abroad, it was
not without looking round me with the greatest
care and caution imaginable; and now I found, to
my great comfort, how happy it was that! had pro-
vided a tame flock or herd of goats; forI durst not,
upon any account, fire my gun, especially near that
side of the island, where they usually came, lest I
should alarm the savages; and if they had fled from
me now, I was sure to have them come back again,
with perhaps two or three hundred canoes with
them, in a few days, and then I knew what to
expect.

However, I wore out a year and three months
more, before I ever saw any more of the savages; and
then I found them again, as I shall soon observe. It
is true, they might have been there once or twice;
but either they made no stay, or at least I did not
hear them: but in the month of May, as near as I
could calculate, and in my four-and-twentieth year,
I had a very strange encounter with them, of which
in its place.

The perturbation of my mind, during this fifteen
or sixteen months' interval, was very great. I slept
tmquiet, dreamed always frightful dreams, and often
started out' of my sleep in the night:. in the day
great troubles overwhelmed my mind; in the night
I dreamed often of killing savages, and the reasons
why I mightjustify the doing of it. But, to wave
all this for a while, it was in the middle of May, on
the sixteenth day, I think, as well as my poor
wooden calender would reckon; for I marked all
upon the post still: I say, it was on the sixteenth
of May, that it blew a very great storm of wind
all day, with a great deal of lightning and thunder,
and a very foul night' was after it. I know not
what was the particular occasion of it; but as I was
reading in the Bible, and taken up with serious
thoughts about my present condition, I was sur-
prised with the noise of a gun, as I thought, fired
at sea.

This was, to be sure, a surprise of a quite differ-
ent nature from any I had met with before; for the
notions this put into my thoughts were quite of
another kind. I started up in the greatest haste
imaginable; and, in a trice, clapped up my ladder
to the middle place of the rock, and pulled it after
me, and, mounting it the second time, got to the
top of the hill: that very moment a flash of fire
bade me listen for a second gun, which accordingly
in about half a minute, I heard; and by the sound
knew that it was from that part of the sea where I
was driven out with the current in my boat.

I immediately considered, that this must be some
ship in distress,and that they had some comrade, or
some other ship in company, and fired these guns
for signals of distress, and to obtain help. I had
this presence of mind at that minute, as to think
that though I could not help them, it may be they
might help me; so I brought together all the dry
wood I could get at hand,and making a good hand-
some pile, I set it on fire upon the hill. The wood
was dry, and blazed freely; and though the wind
bl'ew 'very hard, yet it burnt fairly out, so that I
was certain, if there was any such thing as a ship.
they must needs see it, and no doubt they did;
for as soon as ever my fire blazed up, I heard
another gun, and after that several others, all from
the same quarter. 1 plied my fire all night long,
till day broke; and when it was broad day, and the
air cleared up, I saw something at a great distance
at sea, full east of the island, whether a sail, or a
hull, I could not distinguish, no not with my glasses,
the distance was so great, and the weather still
something hazy also; at least it was so out at sea.

I looked frequently at it all that day, and soon
perceived that it did not move; so I presently con-
cluded that it was a ship at anchor; and being
eager, you may be sure, to be satisfied, I took my
gun in my hand, and ran towards the south-east
side of the island, to the rocks, where I had been
formerly carried away with the current; and get-
ting up there, the weather by this time being per-
fectly clear, I could plainly see, to my great sor-
row, the wreck of a ship cast away in the night
upon those concealed rocks, which I found when
I was out in my boat; and which rocks, as they
checked the violence of the stream, and made a
kind of counter-stream, or eddy, were the' occao
sion of my recovering then from the most. desper-
ate, hopeless condition that ever I had been in, all
my life.

Thus, what is one man's safety, is another man's
destruction; for it seems these men, whoever they
were, being out of their knowledge, and: the rocks
being wholly under water, had been driven upon
them in the night, the wind blowing hard at E. and
EN. E. Had they seen the island, as I must ne-
cessarily suppose they did not, they must, as I
thought, have endeavoured to have saved them.
selves on shore by the help of their boat; but their
firing of their guns for help, especially when they
saw, as I imagined, my fire, filled me with many
thoughts. First, I imagined that, upon seeing my
light. they might have put themselves into their
boat, and-have endeavoured to make the -sbore'e-'

198 ROBINSON CRUSOE.

but that the sea going very high, they might have
been cast away. Other times I imagined that they
might have lost their boat before, as might be the
case many ways; as particularly by the breaking
of the sea upon their ship, which many times
obliges men to stave, or take in pieces their boat;
and sometimes to throw it overboard with their
own hands. Other times I imagined they had some
other ship or ships in company, who, upon the sig-
nals of distress they had made, had taken them
up, and carried them 06'. Other whiles I fancied
they were all gone off to sea in their boat, and,
being hurried away by the current that I had been
formerly in, were carried out into the great ocean,
where there was nothing but misery and perish-
ing; and that perhaps they might, by this time,
think of starving, and of being in a. condition to eat
one another.

As all these were but conjectures at best, so, in
the condition I was in, I could do no more than
look upon the misery of the poor men, and pity
them, which had still this good effect on my side,
that it gave me more and more cause to give thanks
to God, who had so happily and comfortably pro-
vided for me in my desolate condition: and that of
two ships' companies, who were now cast away
upon this part of the world, not one life should be
Spared but mine. I learnt here again to observe,
thatit is very rare that the providence of God casts
us into any condition of life so low, or any misery
so great, but we may see something or other to be
thankful for, and may see others in worse circum-
stances than our own.

Such certainly was the case of these men, of whom
I could not so much as see room to suppose any of

them were saved: nothing could make it rational.

so much as to wish or expect that they did not all
perish there, except the possibility only of their
being taken up by another ship in company: and
this was but more possibility indeed; for I saw
not the least signal or appearance of any such
"thing.

I cannot explain, by any possible energy of words,
what a strange longing or hankering of desires I felt
in my soul upon this sight, breaking out sometimes
thus: ' O that there had' been but one or two, nay,
or but one soul saved out 'of the ship, to have
escaped to me, that I might. but have had one com-
panion, one fellow-creature, to have spoken to me,
and to have conversed with!' In all the time of
my solitary life, I never felt so earnest, so strong a.
desire after the society of my fellow-creatures, or so
deep a regret at the want of it.

There are some secret moving-springs in the affec-
tions, which, when they are set agoing by some
object in view, or be it some object, though not in
view, yet rendered present to the mind by the
power of imagination, whose motion carries out the
soul by its impetuosity to such violent, eager em-
bracings of the object, that the absence of it is in-
Slipportable.

Such were these earnest wishings, that but one
man had been saved. 0 that it had been but one I
I believe I repeated the words, ' 0 that it had been
but'one!" a thousand times; and my desires were
so moved by it, that when I spoke the words, my
hands would clinch together, and my fingers press
the palms of my hands, that if I had had any soft
thing in my hand, it would have crushed it in-
voluntarily; and my teeth in my head would strike
tOgether, and set against one another so strong, that
for some time I could not part them again.

Let the naturalists explain these things, and the
reason and manner of them: all I can say, is, to
describe the fact, which was even surprising to me
when I found it, though I knew not from what it
should proceed; it was doubtless the effect of ar-
dent wishes, and of strong ideas formed in my mind,
realizing the comfort which the conversation of one
of my fellow-Christians would have been to me.
But it was not to be; either their fate, or mine,
or both, forbade it: for, till the last year of my
being on this island, I never knew whether any
were saved out of that ship or no; and had only
the affliction, some days after, to see the corpse of a
drowned boy come on shore, at the end of the
island, which was next the shipwreck. He had on
no clothes but a seaman's waistcoat, a pair of
open-knee'd linen drawers, and a blue linen shirt;
but nothing to direct me so much as to guess what
nation he was of. He had nothing in his pocket but
two pieces of eight, and a tobacco-pipe; the last was
to me of ten times more value than the first.

It was now calm, and I had a great mind to ven-
ture out in my boat to this wreck, not doubting but
I might find something on board that. might be use-
ful to me; but that did not altogether press me so
much, as the possibility that there might be yet some
living creature on board, whose life I might not only
save, but might, by saving that life, comfort my
own to the last degree: and this thought clung so
to my heart, that I could not be quiet, night nor
day, but I must venture out in my boat on board
this wreck; and committing the rest to God's-pro-
vidence, I thought the impression was so strong
upon my mind, that it could not be resisted, that
it must come from some invisible direction, and that
I should be wanting to myself, if I did not go.

Under the power of this impression, I hastened
back to my castle, prepared every thing for my
voyage, took a quantity of bread, a great pot for
fresh water, a compass to steer by, a bottle of rum
(for I had still a great deal of that left), a basket
full of raisins: and thus loading myself with every
thing necessary, I went down to my boat, got the
water out of her, and got her afloat, loaded all my
cargo in her, and then went home again for more.
My second cargo was a great bag full of rice, the
umbrella to set up over my head for shade, another
large pot full of fresh water, and about two dozenJ

ROBINSON CRUS'OE. 201

of my small loaves, or barley-cakes, more than be-
fore, with a bottle of goat's milk, and a cheese; all
which, with great labour and sweat, I brought to
my boat, and praying to God to direct my voyage,
I put out; and rowing or paddling the canoe along
the shore, I came at last to the utmost point of the
island, on that side, viz. N.E. And now I was to
launch out into the ocean; and either to venture,
or not to venture. I looked on the rapid currents
which ran constantly on both sides of the island, at
a. distance, and which were very terrible to me,
from the remembrance of the hazard I had been in
before, and my heart began to fail me; for I fore-
saw, that if I was driven into either of those cur.
rents, I should be carried a vast way out to sea,
and perhaps out of my reach, or sight of the island
again; and that then, as my boat was but small, if
any little gale of wind should rise, 1 should be in-
evitably lost. '

These thoughts so oppressed my mind, that I
began to give over my enterprise, and having hauled
my boat into a little creek on the shore, I stepped
out, and sat me down upon a little spot of rising
ground, very pensive and anxious, between fear and
desire about my voyage; when, as I was musing, I
could perceive that the tide was turned, and the
flood came on, upon which my going was for so
many hours impracticable. Upon this it presently
occurred to me, thatI should go up to the highest
piece of ground I could find. and observe,if1 could,
how the sets of the tide or currents lay, when the
flood came in, that I mightjudge whether, if I was
driven one way out, I might not expect to be driven
another way home, with the same rapidness of the
currents. This thought was no sooner in my head,
but I cast my eye upon a little hill, which suffi-
ciently overlooked the sea both ways, and from
whence I had a clear view of the currents, or sets
9f the tide, and which way I was to guide myself
In my return.' Here I found that as the current of

K 2
the ebb set out close by the south point of the
island, so the current of the flood set in close by
the shore of the north side; and that I had nothing
to do but to keep to the north of the island in my
return, ,and I should do well enough.

Encouraged with this observation, I resolved the

next morning to set out with the first of the tide;
and reposing myself forthat night in the canoe,
under the great watch-coat I mentioned, I launched
out. I made first a little out to sea, full north, till
I began to feel the. benefit of the current, which set
eastward, and which carried me at a great rate, and
yet did not so hurry me as the southern side cur-
rent had done before, and so as to take from me
all government of .the boat; but, having a strong
steerage with my paddle, I went, I say, at a great
rate, directly for the wreck, and in less than two
hours I came up to it.
' It was a dismal sight to look at: the ship, which
by its building was Spanish, stuck fast, jambed in
between two rocks; all the stern and quarter of her
was beaten to pieces with the sea; and as her forc-
castlc, which stuck in the rocks, had run on with
great violence, her main-mast and fore-mast were
brought by the board, that is to say, broken short
of; but her bowsprit was sound, and the head and
bow appeared firm. When I came close to her, a
dog' appeared upon her, who, seeing me coming,
yelped and cried; and as soon as I called him,
jumped into the sea, to come to me; and I took
him into the boat, but found him almost dead for
hunger and thirst. I gave him a cake of my bread,
and he eat like a ravenous wolf, that had been
starving a fortnight in the snow. I then gave the
poor creature,some fresh water, with which, if I
would have let him, he would have burst him-
self.

After this I went on board. The first sight I met
with was two men drowned in the cook-room, or
forecastle of the ship, with their arms fast about
one another. I concluded, as is indeed probable,
that when the ship struck, it being in a storm, the
sea broke so high, and so continually over her, that
the men were not able to bear it, and were strangled
with the constant rushing in of the water, as much
as if they had been under water. Besides the dog,
there was nothing left in the ship that had life, nor
any goods that I could see, but what were spoiled.
by the water. There were some casks of liquor,
whether wine or brandy, I knew not, which lay
lower in the hold, and which, the water being ebbed
out, I could see; but they were too big to meddle
with. I saw several chests, which I believed be-
longed to some of the seamen, and I got two of
them into the boat, without examining what was in
them. '

Had the stern of the ship been fixed, and the fore
part broken off, I am persuaded I might have made
a good voyage ; for, by what I found in these two
chests, I had room to suppose the ship had a great
deal of wealth on board: and, if I may guess by the
course she steered, she must have been bound from
Buenos Ayres, or the Rio de la Plata, in the south
part of America, beyond the Brasils, to the Havanna,
in the. gulf of Mexico, and so perhaps to Spain. She
had, no doubt, a great treasure in her, but of no
use at that time to any body ; and what became of
the rest ofher people, I then knew not.

I found, besides. these chests, a little cash full of
liquor, of about twenty gallons, which I got into my
boat with much difficulty. There were several mus-
kets in a cabin, and a great powder-horn, with about
four pounds of powder in it: as for the muskets I
had no occasion for them, so 1 left them, but took
the powder-horn. I took a fire-shovel and tongs,
which I wanted extremely ; as also two little brass
kettles, a copper pot to make chocolate, and a grid-
iron; and with this cargo, and the dog, I came
away. the tide beginning to make home again: and
the same evening, about an hour within night, I
reached the island again, weary and fatigued to the
last degree.

I reposed that night in the boat, and in the morn-
ing I resolved to harbour what I had gotten in my
new cave, not to carry it home to my castle. After
refreshing myself, I got all my cargo on shore, and
began to examine the particulars. The cask of
liquor I found to be a kind of rum, but not such as
, we had at the Brasils; and, in a word, not at all
good. But when I came to open the chests, I found
several things which I wanted: for example, I found
in one a line case,of bottles, of an extraordinary
kind, and filled with cordial waters, fine, and very
good : the bottles held about three pints each, and
were tipped with silver. 1 found two pots of very
good succades, or sweetmeats, so fastened also on
.top, that the salt water had not hurt them; and
two more of the same. which the water had spoiled.
I found some very good shirts, which were very wel-
come to me, and about a dozen and a half of white
linen handkerchiefs and coloured neckcloths; the
former were also very welcome, being exceeding
refreshing to wipe my face in a hot day. Besides
this, when I came to the till in the chest, I found
there three great bags of pieces of eight, which held
about eleven hundred pieces in all ; and in one of
them, wrapt up in a paper, six doubloons of gold,
and some small bars of wedges of gold; I suppose
they might all weigh near a pound.

The other chestl found had some clothes in it,
but of little value; but by the circumstances it
must have belonged to the gunncr's mate, though
there was no powder in it, but about two pounds
of glazed powder, in three small flasks, kept, I sup-
pose, for charging their fowling--pieces on occasion.
Upon the whole, I got very little by this voyage,
that was of much use to me ; for, as to the money.
I had no manner of occasion for it, it was to me as
the dirt under my feet, and I would have given it
all for three or four pair of English shoes and stock-
ings,which were things I greatly wanted, but had not
had on my feet now for many years. I had, indeed,
gotten two pair of shoes now, which I took oil" the
feet of the two drowned men whom I saw in the
wreck; and I found two pair more in one of the
chests, which were very welcome to 'me; but they
were not like our English shoes, either for ease or
service, being rather what we call pumps than shoes.
I found in this seaman's chest about fifty pieces of
eight in royals, but no gold: I suppose this belonged
to a poorer man than the other, which seemed to
belong to some officer.

Well, however, I lugged this money home to my
cave, and laid it up, as I had done that before,
which .I brought from our own ship; but it was great
pity, as I said, that the other part of the ship had
not come to my share, for I am satisfied 1 might
have loaded my canoe several times over with mo-
ney, which, if I had ever escaped to England, would
have lien here safe enough till I might have come
again and fetched it. ,

Having now brought all my things on shore, and
secured them, i went back to my boat, and rowed
or paddled her along the shore to her old harbour,
where I laid her up, and made the best of my way
to my old habitation, where I found every thing
safe and quiet: so I began to repose myself, live
after my old fashion, and take care of my family
affairs; and for a while I lived easy enough, only
that I was more vigilant than I used to be, looked
out oftener, and did not go abroad so much; and if
at any time I did stir with any freedom, it was
always to the east part of the island, where I was
pretty well sat1slied the savages never came, and
where I could go without so many precautions, and
such a load of arms and ammunition as I always
carried with me, if I went the other way.

I lived 1n this condition near two years more; but
my unlucky head, that Was always to let me know
it was born to make my body miserable, was all
those two years filled with projects and designs,
how, if it were possible, I might get away from this
island; for sometimes I was for making another
voyage to the wreck, though my reason told me,
that there was nothing left there worth the hazard
of my voyage; sometimes for a ramble one way,
sometimes another; and I believe verily, if I had
had the boat that I went from Sallee in, I should
have ventured to sea, bound any where, I know not
whither.

I have been, in all my circumstances, a memento
to those who are touched with that general plague
of mankind, whence, for aught 1 now, one half of
their miseries flow ; I mean, that of not being satis-
fied with the station wherein God and nature hath
placed them. For, not to look back upon my primi-
tive condition, and the excellent advice of my fa-
ther, the opposition to which was, as I may call it,
my original sin, my subsequent mistakes of the
same kind have been the means of my coming into
this miserable condition; for had that Providence,
which so happily had seated me at the Brasils, as a
planter, blessed me with confined desires, and could
I have been contented to have gone on gradually,
I might have been by this time, I mean in the time
of my being in this island, one of the most con-
siderable planters in the Brasils; nay, I am per-
suaded that, by the improvements I had made in
that little time I lived there, and the increase I
should probably have made, if I had staid, I might
have been worth a hundred thousand moidores. And
what business had I to leaVe a settled fortune, a
well-stocked plantation. improving and increasing,
to turn supercargo to Guinea, to fetch Negroes,
when patience and time would have so increased
our stock at home, that we could have bought them
at our own doors, from those whose business it was
to fetch them? and though it had cost us something
more, yet the difference of that price was by 110
means worth saving at so great a hazard.

I
- But as this is ordinarily the fate of young heads,
so reflection upon the folly of it, is as ordinarily
the exercise of more years, or of the dear-bought
experience of time; and so it was with me now:
and yet so deep had the mistake taken root in my
temper, that I could not satisfy myself in my sta-
tion, but was continually poring upon the means and
possibility of my escape from this place. And that
I may, with the greater pleasure to the reader,
bring on the remaining part of my story, it may
not be improper to give some account of my first
conceptions on the subject of this foolish scheme
for my escape, and how, and upon what foundation,
lumm

I am now to be supposed to be retired into my
castle, aftermy late voyage to the wreck, my frigate
laid up, and secured under water as usual, and my
condition restored to what it was before. I had
more wealth, indeed, than I had before, but was
not at all the richer; for I had no more use for it
than the Indians of Peru had before the Spaniards
came thither.

It was one of the nights, in the rainy season, in
March, the four-and-twentieth year of my first set-
ting foot in this island of solitariness, I was lying
in mysbed, or hammock, awake, very well in health,
had no pain, no distemper, no uneasiness of body,
no, nor any uneasiness of mind more than ordinary;
but could by no means close my eyes; that is, so
as to sleep, no, not a wink all night long, otherwise
than as follows:

It is as impossible as needless to set down the
innumerable crowd of thoughts that whirled through
that great thoroughfare of the brain, the memory,
in this night's time. I ran over the whole history
of my life in miniature, or by abridgement, as I
may call it, to my coming to this island ; and also
of that part of my life since I came to this island.
In my reflections upon the state of my case, since I
came on shore on this island, I was comparing the
happy posture of my affairs, in the first years of my
habitation here, to that course of anxiety, fear, and
care, which I had lived in ever since I had seen
the print of a foot in the sand. Not that I did not
believe the savages had frequented the island even
all the while, and might have been several hundreds
of them at times on shore there; but as I had never
known it, and was incapable of any apprehensions
about it, my Satisfaction was' perfect, though my
danger was the same; and I was as happy in not
knowing my danger, as if I had never really been
exposed to it. This furnished my thoughts with
many very profitable reflections, and particularly
this one. How infinitely good that Providence is,
which has settled in its government of mankind
such narrow bounds to his sight and knowledge of
things; and though he walks in the midst of so
many thousand dangers, the sight of 'which, if dis-
covered to him, would distract his mind, and sink
his spirits, he is kept serene and calm, by hav~
ing the events of things hid from his eyes, and

knowing nothing of the dangers which surround
him.

After these thoughts had for some time enter-
tained me, I came to reflect seriously upon the real
danger I had been in for so many years in this very
island; and how I had walked about in the greatest
security, and with all possible tranquillity, even
when perhaps nothing but a brow of a hill, a great
tree, or the casual approach of night, had been be-
tween me and the worst kind of destruction; viz.
that of falling into the hands of cannibals and sa-
vages, who would have seized on me with the same
view as I did on a goat or a turtle,and have thought
it no more a crime to kill and devour me, than I
did of a pigeon or a curlieu 3 I should unjustly
slander myself, if I should say I was not sincerely
thankful to my great Preserver, to whose singular
protection I acknowledged, with great humility:
that all these unknown deliverances were due, and
without which I should inevitably have fallen into
their merciless hands.

When these thoughts were over, my head was for
some time taken up in considering the nature of
these wretched creatures, I mean, the savages; and
how it came to pass in the world, that the wise
Governor of all things should give up any of his
creatures to such inhumanity, nay, to something so
'much below even brutality itself, as to devour its
own kind. . But as this ended in some (at that time
fruitless) speculations, it occurred to me to inquire
what part of the world these wretches lived in;
how far off the coast was from whence they came;
what they ventured over so far from home for;
what kind of boats they had; and why I might
n0l. order myself, and my business so, thatI might
be as able to go over thither, as they were to come
to me.

Inever so much as troubled myself to consider
what 1' should do with myself when I came thither;
what should become of me, if I fell into the hands
of the savages; or how 1' should escape from them,
if they attempted me; no, nor so much as'how it
was possible for me to reach the coast, and not be
attempted by some or other of them, without any
possibility of delivering myself; and if I should not
fall into their hands, what ] should do for pro~
vision, or whither I should bend my course; none
0? these thoughts. I say, so much as came in my
Way; but my mind was wholly-bent upon the no-
tion of my passing over in my boat to the main
land. I looked back upon my present condition, as
the most miserable that could possibly be; that I
was not able to throw myself into any thing but
death that could be called worse; that if I reached
the shore of the main, I might, perhaps, meet with
relief; or I might coast along, as I did on the shore
of Africa, till I came to some inhabited country,
and where 1 might find some relief; and after all,
Perhaps, I might fall in with some Christian ship, .J-'pr I... H-,- - . '17?"

that might take me in; and if the worst came to .
the worst, I could but die, which would put an end
to all these miseries at once. Pray note, all this
was the fruit of a disturbed mind, an impatient
temper, made, as it were, deSperate by the long
continuance of my troubles, and the disappoint.
ments 1 had met in the wreck I had been on board
of, and where I had been so near the obtaining what
I so earnestly longed for, viz. somebody to Speak to,
and to learn some knowledge from, of the place
where I was, and of the probable means of my de-
liverance; I say, I was agitated wholly by these
thoughts. All my calm of mind, in my resignation
to Providence, and waiting the issue of the diSposi-
tions of Heaven, seemed to be suspended; andI
had, as it were, no power to turn my thoughts to
any thing, .but the project of a voyage to the main,
which came upon me with such force, and such an
impetuosity of desire, that it was not to be resisted.

When this had agitated my thoughts, for two hours
or more, with such violence, that it set my very
blood into a ferment, and my pulse beat as high as
if I had been in a fever, merely with the extraor-
dinary fervour of my mind about it; nature, as if
I had been fatigued and exhausted with the very
thought of it, threw me into a sound sleep. One
would have thought I should have dreamed of it;
but I did not, nor of any thing relating to it: butI
dreamed, that as I was going out in the morning, as
usual, from my castle, I saw upon the shore two
canoes, and eleven savages coming to land, and that
they brought with them another savage, whom they
were going to kill, in order to eat him, when, on
a sudden, the savage that they were going to kill,
jumped away, and ran for his life: then I thought, in
my sleep, that he came running into my little thick
grove, before my fortification, to hide himself; and
that I seeing him alone, and not perceiving that the
others sought him that way, showed myself to him.
and smiling upon him, encouraged him : that he kneel-
ed down to me, seeming to pray to me to assist him;
upon which I showed my ladder, made him go upon
it, and carried him into my cave. and he became my
servant; and that as soon as I had gotten this man, I
said to myself, ' Now I may certainly venture to the
main land; for this fellow will serve me as a pilot,
and will tell me what to do, and whither to go for
provisions, and whither not to go for fear of being
devoured, what places to venture into, and what to
escape.' I waked with this thought, and was under
such inexpressible impressions of joy at the pro-
spect of my escape in my dream, that the dis-
appointments which i felt upon coming to myself,
and finding it was no more than a dream, were
equally extravagant the other way, and threw me
into a very great dejection of spirit.

Upon this, however, I made this conclusion, that
my only way to go about an attempt for an escape,
was,if possible, to get a savage in my possession;
and, if possible, it should be one of their prisoners,
whom they had condemned to be eaten, and should
bring hither to kill; but these thoughts still were
attended with this difficulty. that it was impossible
to efiect this, without attacking a whole caravan of
them, and killing them all; and this was not only
a very desperate attempt, and might miscarry, but,
on the other hand, I had greatly scrupled the law-
fulness of it to me, and my heart trembled at the
thoughts of shedding so much blood, though it was
for my deliverance. I need not repeat the argu-
ments which occurred to me against this, they being
the same mentioned before: but though I had other
reasons to offer now; viz. that those men were ene- '
rules to my life, and would devour me, if they could;
that it was selfipreservation, in the highest degree,
to deliver myself from this death of a life, and was
acting in my own defence, as much as if they were
actually assaulting me, and the like; I say, though
these things argued for it, yet the thoughts of shed-
ding human blood for my deliverance, were very ter-
ribIe to me, and such as I could by no means recon.
cile myself to a great while.

Howe e,ver at last, after many secret diSputes with
myself, and aftez great perplexities about it (for all
these arguments, one way and another, struggled 111
my head a long time), the eager prevailing desire of
deliverance, at length mastered all the rest, and I
resolved, if possible, to get one of these savages
into my hands, cost what it would. My next thing
then was to contrive how to do it; and this indeed
was very difficult to resolve on: but as I could
pitch upon no probable means for it, so I resolved
to put myself upon the watch, to see them when
they came on shore, and leave the rest to the event,
taking such measures as the opportunity should pre-
sent, let be what would be.

With these resolutions in my thoughts, I set my-
self upon the scout, as often as possible, and indeed
so often, till I was heartily tired of it; for it was
above a year and a half that I waited, and fora
great part of that time went out to the west end,
and to the south-west corner of the island, almost
every day, to see the canoes; but none appeared.
This was very discouraging, and began to trouble
me much; though I cannot say that it did in this
case, as it had done some time before that; viz.
wear off the edge of my desire to the thing; but
the longer it seemed to be delayed, the more eager
I was for it. In a word, I was not at first more care-
ful to shun the sight of these savages, and avoid
being seen by them, than I was now eager to be
upon them.

Besides, I fancied myself able to manage one,
nay, two or-three savages, if I had them, so as to
make them entirely slaves to me, to do whatever I
should direct them, and to prevent their being able,
at any time to do me any hurt. Itwas a great while
thatI pleased myself with this affair; but nothing
still presented: all my fancies and schemes came to
nothing, for no savages came near me for a great while.
About a year and a half after I had entertained
these notions, and, by long musing, had, as it were,
resolved them all into nothing, for want of an oc-
casion to put them into execution, I was surprised
one morning early, with seeing no less than five
canoes, all on shore together, on my side the island,
and the people who belonged to them all landed,
and out of my sight. The number of them broke
all my measures; for seeing so many, and knowing
that they always came four or six, or sometimes
more, in a boat, 1 could not tell what to think of
it, or how to take my measures to attack twenty or
thirty men single-handed; so I lay still in my
castle, perplexed and discomfortcd. However, I put
myself into all the same postures for an attack, that
I had formerly provided, and was just ready for
action, if any thing had presented. Having waited
a good while, listening to hear if they made any
noise, at length, being very impatient, I set my
guns at the foot of my ladder, and clambered up to
the top of the hill by my two stages, as usual;
standing so, however, that my head did not appear
above the hill ; so that they could not perceive me,
by any means. Here I observed, by the help of my
perspective glass, that they were no less than thirty
in number; that they had a fire kindled, and that
they had had meat dressed: how they cooked it,
that I know not, or what it was; but they were all
dancing, in I know not how many barbarous ges-
tures and figures, their own way, round the fire.

While I was thus looking on them, I perceived,
by my perspective, two miserable wretches dragged -
from the boats. where, it seems, they were laid by,
and were now.brought out for the slaughter. I per-
ceived one of them immediately fell, being knocked
down, I suppose, with a club or wooden sword, for
that was their way; and two or three others were
at work immediately, cutting him open for their
cookery, while the other victim was left standing
by himself, till they should be ready for him. In- "k; '

214- ROBINSON CRUSOE.

that very moment this poor wretch seeing himself
a little at liberty, nature inspired him with hopes of
life, and he started away from them, and ran with
incredible swiftness along the sands, directly to-
wards me, i mean, towards that part of the coast
where my habitation was.

I was dreadfully frighted (that I must acknow-
ledge), when I perceived him to run my way; and
especially when, as I thought, I saw him pursued
by the whole body; and now chpected that part
of my dream was coming to pass,and that he would
certainly take shelter in my grove ; but I could not
depend, by any means, upon my dream for the rest
ofit, viz. that the other savages would not pursue
him thither, and find him there. However, I kept
my station, and my spirits began to recover, when I
found that there were not above three men that fol-
lowed him; and still more was I encouraged, when
I found that he. outstripped them exceedingly in
running, and gained ground of them, so that if he
could but hold it out for half an hour, I saw easily
he would fairly get away from them all.

There was between them and my castle the creek,
which I mentioned often at the first part of my,
story, when I landed my cargoes out of the ship;
and this I knew he must necessarily swim over, or
the poor wretch would be taken there: but when
the savage escaping came thither, he made nothing
of it, though the tide was then up; but, plunging
in, swam through, in about thirty strokes, or there-
abouts, landed, and ran on with exceeding strength
and swiftness. When the three pursners came to
the creek, I found that two of them could swim,
but the third could not, and that he standing on
the other side, looked at the other, but went no
farther; and soon after went softly back again,
which, as it happened, was very well for him in the
main. '

I observed that the two who swam, were yet more
than twice as long swimming over the creek, than

the fellow was that fled from them. It came now
very warmly upon my thoughts, and indeed irre-
sistibly, that now was my time to get me a: servant,
and, perhaps, a companion or assistant, and that I
was called plainly, by Providence, to save this poor
creature's life. I immediate! y got down the lad-
tiers, with all possible expedition, fetched my two
guns, for they were both at the foot of the ladders,
as I observed above; and getting up again with the-
same haste to the top of the hill, I crossed towards
the sea: and, having a very short cut, and all do'wn

. hi", clapped myself in the way between the pur-

suers and the pursued, hollowing aloud to him that
fled, who, looking back, was at first perhaps as much
frighted at me, as at them; but I beckoned with
my hand to him to come back, and, in the mean
time,I slowly advanced towards the two that fol-
lowed; then rushing at once upon the foremost, I
knocked him down with the stock of my piece: I
was loath to fire, because I would not have the rest
hear; though at that distance it would not have

.. been easily heard; and being out of sight of the

smoke too, they would not have easily known what
to make of it. Having knocked this fellow down,
the other who pursued him stopped, as if he had'
been frightened, and I advanced apace towards.
him; but as I came nearer, I perceived presently-
he had a bow and arrow, and was fitting it to shoot
at me; so I was then necessitated to shoot at him
first. which I did, and killed him at the first shot.
The poor savage who fled, but had stopped, though
he saw both his enemies fallen, and killed (as he
lh0ught), yet was so frighted with the fire and noise
or my piece, that he stood stock-still, and neither
came forward, nor went backward, though he
seemed rather inclined to fly still, than to come
on. I hollowed again to him, and made signs to
come forward, which he easily understood, and
C'ame a little way, then stopped again, and then a.-
httle farther, and stopped again; and I could then
perceive that he stood trembling, as if he had been
taken prisoner, and had just been to be killed, as
his two enemies were. I beckoned him again to
come to me, and gave him all the signs of encou-
ragement that I could think of; and he came nearer
and nearer, kneeling down every ten or twelve
steps, in token of acknowledgement for saving his
life. I smiled at him, and looked pleasantly, and
beckoned to him to come still nearer. At length
he came close to me, and then he kneeled down
again, kissed. the ground, and laid his head upon
the ground, and taking me by the foot, set my foot
upon his head: this, it seems, was in token of
swearing to be my slave for ever. I took him up,
and made much of him, and encouraged him all I
could. But there was more work to do yet ; for
I perceived the savage whom I knocked down was
not killed, but stunned with the blow, and began to
come to himself. So I pointed to him, and showing
him the savage, that he was not dead 3 upon this he
spoke some words to me, and though 1 could not
understand them, yet I thought they were pleasant
to hear, for they were the first sound of a man's
voice that I had heard, my own excepted, for above
five-and-twenty years. But there was. no time for
such reflections now. The savage who was knocked
down, recovered himself so far as to sit up upon
the ground ; and I perceived that my savage began
to be afraid: but when I saw that, I presented my
other piece at the man, as if I would shoot him;
upon this my savage, for so I call him now, made a
motion to me to lend him my sword, which hung
naked in a belt by my side; so I did. He no sooner
had it, but he runs to his enemy, and, at one blow:
cut oil" his head as cleverly, no executioner in Ger-
many could have done it sooner or better; which I
thought very strange for one, who, I had reason to
believe, never saw a sword in his life before, except
their own wooden swords. However, it seems, as I
learned afterwards, they make their wooden swords
so sharp, so heavy, and the wood is so hard, that
they will cut off heads even with them, ay, and
arms, and that at one blow too. When he had
done this, he comes laughing to me in sign of
triumph, and brought me the sword again, and, with
abundance of gestures, which I did not understand,
laid it down, with the head of the savage. that he
had killed, just before me. -

But that which astonished him most was to know
how I had killed the other Indian so far off; so
pointing to him, he made signs to me to let him go
to him; so I bade him go, as well as I could. When
he came to him, he stood like one amazed, looking
at him; turned him first on one side, then on the
ether; looked at the wound the bullet had made,
which, it seems, was just in his breast, where it had
made a hole, and no great quantity of blood had
followed, but he had bled inwardly, for he was
quite dead. Then he took up his bow and arrows,
and came back; so I turned to go away, and beck-
oned to him to follow me, making signs to him
that more might come after them.

Upon this, he signed to me, that he should bury
them with sand, that they might not be seen by the
rest, if they followed; and so I made signs again
to him to do so: he fell to work, and, in an instant,
he scraped a hole in the sand with his hands, big
enough to bury the first in, and then dragged him
into it, and covered him; and did so also by the
other. I believe he had buried them both in a quar-
ter of an hour; then calling him away, I carried
him not to my castle, but quite away to my cave, on
the farther part of the island: so I did not let my
dream come to pass in that part; viz. that he came
Into my grove for shelter. '

Here I gave him bread, and a bunch of raisins to
eat, and a draught of water, which I found he was
indeed in great distress for, by his running; and
having refreshed him, I made signs for him to go
lie down and. sleep, pointing to a place where I had

L
laid a great parcel of rice straw, and a blanket upon
it, which I used to sleep upon myself sometimes:
so the poor creature lay down, and went to sleep.
He was a comely, handsome fellow; perfectly well
made, with straight, long limbs, not too large; tall,
and well shaped; and, as I reckon, about twenty-six
years of age. He had a very good countenance;
not a fierce and surly aspect1 but seemed to have
something very manly in his- face. and yet he had
all the sweetness and softness of an European in
his countenance too, especially when he smiled.
His hair was long and black, not curled like wool ;
his forehead very high, and large, and a great viva-
city and sparkling sharpness in his eyes. The co-
lour of his skin was not quite black, but very
tawny, and yet not of an ugly, yellow, nauseous
tawny, as the Brasilians, and Virginians, and other
natives of America are, but of a bright kind ofa
dun olive colour, that had in it something very
agreeable, though not veryeasy to describe. His
face was round and plump, his nose small, not flat
like the Negroes, a very good mouth, thin lips, and
his teeth fine, well set, and white as ivory. After
he had slumbered, rather than slept, about half an
hour, he waked again, and comes out of the cave to
me, for I had been milking my goats which I had in
the enclosure just by. When he espied me, he came
running to me, laying himself down again upon the
ground, with all'the possible signs of a humble,
thankful disposition, making many antic gestures
to show it. At last he lays his head fiat upon the
ground, close to my'foot, and sets my other foot
upon his head, as he had done before; and after
this, made all the signs to me of subjection, servi'
tude, and submission imaginable, to let me know '
how much he would serve me as long as he lived.
I understood him .in many things, and let him
knowI was very well pleased with him. In a little
time I began to speak to him, and teach him to
speak to me; and first, I made him know his name
should be Friday, which was the day I saved. his
life; and I called him so for the memory of the
time: ' I likewise taught him to say, ' Master,' and
then let him know that was to be my name. I like.
wise taught him to say, ' Yes' and ' No,' and to
know the meaning of them. I gave him some milk
in an earthen pot, and let him see me drink it be-
fore him, and sop my bread in it; and I gave him
a cake of bread to do the like, which he quickly
complied with, and made signs that it was very good
for him.

I'kept there with him all that night; but as soon
as it was day, I beckoned him to come with me,
and let him know I would give him some clothes ;
at which he seemed very glad, for he was stark
naked. As we went by the place where we had
buried the two men, he pointed exactly to the spot,
and showed me the marks that he had made to
find them again, making signs to me that we should
dig them up again, and eat them: at this I ap-
peared very angry, expressed my abhorrence of it,
made as ifI would vomit at the thoughts ofit, and
beckoned with my hand to him to come away,
which he did immediately, with great submission.
I then led him up to the top of the hill, to see if
his enemies were gone, and pulling out my glass, I
looked, and saw plainly the place where they had
been, but no appearance of them, or of their ca-
noes; so that it was plain that they were gone, and
had left their two comrades behind them, without
any search after them. '

But I was not content with this discovery; but
having now more courage, and consequently more
curiosity, I took my man Friday with me, giving
him the sword in his hand, with the bow and ar-
rows at his back, which I found he could use very
dexterously, making him carry one gun for me, and
I two for myself, and away we marched to the
place where these creatures had been; for I had a
mind now to get some fuller intelligence of them.
When I came to the place, my very blood ran chill
in my veins, and my heart sunk within me at the
horror of the Spectacle. Indeed it was a dreadful
sight, at least it was so to me, though Friday made
nothing of it: the place was covered with human
bones, the ground dyed with the blood, great pieces
of flesh left here and there, half eaten, mangled,
and scorched; and, in short, all the tokens of the
triumphant feast they had been making there, after
a victory over the enemies. I saw three skulls, five
hands, and the bones of three or four legs and
feet, and abundance of other parts of the bodies:
.and Friday, by his signs, made me understand,
that they brought over four prisoners to feast upon;
that three of them were eaten up. and that he,
pointing to himself, was the fourth ; that there had
been a great battle between them and their next
king, whose subjects. it seems, he had been one of ;
' and that they had taken a great number of prison-
ers, all which were carried to several places by those
that had taken them in the light, in order to feast
upon them, as was done here by these wretches
upon those they brought hither.

I caused Friday to gather all the skulls, bones,
flesh, and whatever remained, and lay them toge-
ther on aheap, and make a great fire upon it, and
burn them all to ashes. I found Friday had still
a hankering stomach after some of the flesh, and
wasstill a cannibal in his nature; but I discovered
so much abhorrence at the very thoughts of it, and
at the least appearance of it, that he durst not disc
cover it; for I had, by some means, let him know,
that I would kill him if he offered it.

When we had done this, we came back to our
castle, and there I fell to work for my man Friday.
And first of all, I gave him a pair of linen drawers,
which I had out of the poor gunner's chest I men-
tioned, and which I found in thewreck; and which,
with a little alteration, fitted him very well: then
1 made him a jerkin of goat's skin, as well as my
skill would allow, and I was now grown a tolerable
good tailor; and I gave him a cap, which I had
made of a hare-skin, very convenient, and fashion-
able enough: and thus he was dressed, for the pre-
sent,tolerably well; and mighty well was he pleased
to see himself almost as well clothed as his master.
It is true, he went awkardly in these things at
first: wearing the drawers was very awkward to
him; and the sleeves of the waistcoat gelled his
shoulders, and the inside of his arms; but a little
easing them where he complained they hurt him,
and using himself to them, at length he took to
them very well.

The next day after I came home to my hutch
with him, I began to consider where I should lodge
him; and that I might do well for him. and yet be
perfectly easy myself, I made a little tent for him,
in the vacant place between my two fortifications,
in the inside of the last, and in the outside of the
first:- and as there was a door or entrance there
into my cave, I made a formal framed door-case,
and a door to it of boards, and set it up in the pas-
sage, a little within the entrance; and, causing the
door to open on the inside, I barred it up in the
night. taking in my ladders too; so that Friday
could no way come at me in the inside of my in-
nermost wall, without making so much noise in get-
ting Over, that it must needs awaken me; for my
first wall had now a complete roof over it of long
P0183, covering all my tent, and leaning up to the
side of the hill, which was again lai'd cross with
small sticks instead of'laths, and then thatched over
8 great thickness with the rice straw, which was
strong like reeds; and at the hole or place which
Was left to go in or out by the ladder, I had placed
a kind of trap-door, which, if it had been attempted
on the outside, would not have opened at all, but
would have fallen down, and made a great noise:

and as to weapons, I took them all in to my side
every night. a
But I needed none of all this precaution; for
never man had a more faithful, loving, sincere sero
vant than Friday was to me ; without passions, sul-
lenness, or designs; perfectly obliged and engaged;
his very affections were tied to me, like those of a
child to a father; and I dare say, he would have
sacrificed his life fer the saving mine, upon any oc-
casion whatsoever. The many testimonies he gave
me of this, put it out of doubt; and soon convinced
me, that I needed to use no precautions as to my
safety on his account.

This-frequently gave me occasion to observe, and
that with wonder, that, however it had pleased God
in his providence, and in the government of the
works of his hands, to take from so great a part of
the world of his creatures, the best uses to which
their faculties, and the powers of their souls, are
adapted; yet that he has bestowed upon them the
Same powers, the same reason, the same affections,
the same sentiments of kindness and obligation, the
same passions and resentments of wrongs, the same
sense of gratitude, sincerity, fidelitv, and all the
capacities of doing good, and receiving good, that
he has given to us; and that when he pleases to
offer them occasions of exerting these, they are as
ready, nay, more ready to apply them to the right
uses for which they were bestowed, than we are.
And this made me very melancholy sometimes, in
reflecting, as the several occasions presented, how
mean a use we make of all these, even though we
have these powers enlightened by the great lamp of
instruction, the Spirit of God, and by the knowledge
of his word, added to our understanding ; and why it
has pleased God to hide the like saving knowledge
from so many millions of souls, who, if I~ might
judge by this poor savage, would make a much bet-
ter use of it than we did. '

From hence I sometimes was led too far to invade
the sovereignty of Providence, and, as it were, 31'-
raigu the justice of so arbitrary a disposition of

U
things, that should hide that light from some, and
reveal it to others, and yet expect a like duty from
both. But I shut it up, and checked my thoughts
with this conclusion; first, that we did not know
by what light and law these should be condemned;
but that as God was necessarily, and by the nature
of his being, infinitely holy and just, so it could
not be, but that if these creatures were all sentenced
to absence from himself, it was on account of sin-
ning against that light, which. as the Scripture says,
was a law to themselves, and by such rules as their
consciences would acknowledge to be just, though
the foundation was not discovered to us: and, se-
condly, That still, as we are all the clayin the hand
of the potter, no vessel could say to him, ' Why
hast thou formed me thus ?' '

But to return to my new companion: I was
greatly delighted with him, and made it my busi-
ness to teach him every thing that was prOper to
make him useful, handy, and helpful; but am-
cially to make him speak, and understand me when
I spake; and he was the aptest scholar that ever
Was, and particularly was so merry, so constantly
diligent, and so pleased when he could but under-
stand me, or make me understand him, that it was
very pleasant to me to talk to him. And now my
life began to be so easy, that I began to say to my.
self, that could I but have been safe from more ea.
vages, I cared not if I was never to remove from the
place while I lived.

After I had been two or three days returned to
my castle, I thought, that, in order to bring Friday
at? from his horrid way of feeding, and from the
relish of a cannibal's stomach, I ought to let him
taste other flesh. So I took him out with me one
morning to the woods; I went, indeed, intending to
kill a kid out of my own flock, and bring it home
and dress it: but, as I was going, I saw a she-goat,
lying down in the shade, and two young kids sitting
by her. 1 catched hold of Friday; ' Hold,' said 1:
' stand still ;' and made signs to him not to stir:
immediately I presented my piece, shot, and killed.
one of the kids. The poor creature who had, at a
distance, indeed, seen me kill the savage, his enemy,
but did not know, nor could imagine, how it was
done, was sensibly surprised, trembled, and shock,
and looked so amazed, that I thought he would
have sunk down. He did not see the kid I had
shot at, nor perceive I had killed it, but ripped up
his waistcoat to feel if he was not wounded ; and,
as I found,'presently thought I was resolved to kill
him; for he came and kneelcd down to me, and
embracing my knees, said a great many things I
did not understand ; but I could easily see, that his
meaning was to pray me not to kill him.

I soon found a way to convince him, that I would
do him no harm; and, taking him up by the hand,
laughed at him, and pointing to the kid which I
had killed, beckoned to him to run and fetch it.
which he did; and while he was wondering and
looking to see how the creature was killed, I loaded
my gun again, and by-and-by I saw a great fowl,
like a hawk, sit upon a tree within shot; so, to let
Friday understand a little what I would 'do, I
called him to me again, pointing at the fowl, which
was indeed a parrot, though I thought it had been
a hawk; I say, pointing to the parrot, and to my
gun. and to the ground under the parrot, to let him
see I would make him fall, I made him understand
that I would shoot and kill that bird: accordingly.
I fired, and bade him look, and immediately he
saw the parrot fall. He stood like one frighted
again, notwithstanding all that I had said to him;
and I found he was the more amazed, because he
did not see me put any thing into the gun; but
thought there must be some wonderful fund of
death and destruction in that thing, able to kill man,
beast, bird, or any thing near or far off; for the
astonishment this created in him was such as could
not wear off for a long time; and I believe, if!
would have let him, he would have worshipped me
and my gun: as for the gun itself, he would not so
much as touch it for several days after; but would
speak to it, and talk to it, as if it had answered him,
when he was by himself, which, as I afterwards
'learned of him, was to desire it not to kill him.
Well, after his astonishment was a little over at
this, I pointed to him to run and fetch the bird I
had shot, which he did, but staid some time; for
the parrot, not being quite dead, was fluttered a
good way off from the place where she fell. How-
ever, he found her, took her up, and brought her- to
me; and, as I had perceived his ignorance about
the gun before, I took this advantage to charge the
gun again, and not let him see me do' it, that -I
might be ready for any other mark that might pre-
sent; but nothing more offered at that time. So I
brought home the kid, and the same evening I
took the skin off, and cut it out as well as I could;
and, having a pot for that purpose, I boiled or
stewed some of the flesh, and made some very good
broth: after I had begun to eat some, I gave some
to my man, who seemed very glad of it, and liked
it very well; but that which was strangest to him
was to see me eat salt with it. He made a sign to
me, that the salt was not good to eat, and putting a
little into his own mouth, he seemed to nauseate it,
and would spit and Sputter at it, washing his mouth
with fresh water after it; on the other hand, I took
some meat in my month without salt, and I pre-
tended to spit and sputter for want of salt, as fast
as he had done at the salt: but it would not do; he
would never care for salt with meat, or in his broth,
at least, not a great while, and then but a very little.
Having thus fed him with boiled meat and broth,
I was resolved to feast him the next day with roast.
ing a piece of the kid: this I did by hanging it before
the fire in a string, as I had seen many people do in
England, setting two poles up, one on each side the
fire, and one cross on the top, and tying the string
L 2
to the cross stick, letting the meat turn continu-
ally. This Friday admired very much; but when
he came to taste the flesh, he took so many ways
to tell me how well he liked it, that I could not but
understand him : and at last, he told me he would
never eat man's flesh any more, which I was very
glad to hear.

The next day I set him to work to beating some
corn out, and sifting it in the manner I used to do,
as I observed before ; and he soon understood how
to do it as well as I, especially after he had seen
what the meaning of it was, and that it was to make
bread of; for after that I let him see me make my
bread, and bake it too; and in a little time Friday
was able to do all the work for me, as well as I could
do it myself.

I began now to consider, that, having two months
to feed instead of one, I must provide more ground
for my harvest, and plant a larger quantity of corn
than I used to do ; so I marked out a larger piece
of land, and began the fence in the same manner as
before, in which Friday not only worked very will-
ingly, and very hard, but did it vcry cheerfully;
and I told him what it was for, that it was for corn
to make more bread, because he was now with me,
and thatI might have enough for him and myself
,too. He appeared very sensible of that part, and
let me know that he thought I had much more la-
bour upon me on his account, than I had for my-
self, and that he would work the harder for me, if
I would tell him what to do.

This was the pleasantest year of all the life I led
in this place. Friday began to talk pretty well, and
understand the names of almost every thing I had
occasion to call for, and of every place I had to
send him to, and talk a great deal to me; so that
in short, I began now to have some use for my
tongue again, which indeed I had very little occa-
sion for before; that is to say, about speech. Be-
sides the pleasure of talking to him, I had a singu-
lar satisfaction in the fellow himself: his simple,
unfeigned henesty appeared to me more and more
every day, and I began really to love the creature;
and on his side, I. believe he loved me more than
it was possible for him ever to love any thing be-
fore. '

I had a mind once to try if he had any hankering
inclination to his own country again; and having
learned him English so well, that he could answer
me almost any questions, I asked him whether the
nation that he belonged to never conquered in
battle. At which he smiled, and said, ' Yes, yes:
we always fight the better ;' that is, he meant,
always get the better in fight: and so we began
the following discourse. ' You always fight the
'better! ' said I: ' How came you to be taken pri~

soner then, Friday?'

Friday. My nation beat much for all that.

Master. flow heat? If your nation beat them,
how came you to be taken?

Friday. 'l'hey more than my nation in the place
where me was: they take one, two, three, and me.
My nation over-beat them in the yonder place,
where me no was: there my nation take one, two,
great thousand.

Master. But why did not your side recover you
from the hands of your enemies then? '

Friday. They run one, two, three, and me, and
make go in the canoe: my nation have no canoe
that time.

Master. Well, Friday, and what does your nation
do with the men they take? Do they carry them
away, and eat them, as these did?

Friday. Yes, my nation eat mans too, eat all up.

Master. Where do they carry them ?

Friday. Go to other place where they think.

Master. Do they come hither?

Friday. Yes, yes, they come hither; come other
else place.

Mastei'. Have you been here with them?
Friday. Yes, I been here. (Points to the N. W.
side of the island, which, it seems, was their side.)

By this I understood that my man Friday had
formerly been among the savages, who used to come
on shore, on the farther parts of the island, on the'
said man-eating occasions that he was now brought
for; and some time after, when I took courage to
carry him to that side, being the same I formerly
mentioned, he presently knew the place, and told
me, he was there once when they eat up twenty
men, two women, and one child: he could not tell
twenty in English, but he numbered them by laying
so many stones in a row, and pointing to me to tell
them over. .
. I have told this passage, because it introduces
what follows: that, after I had had this discourse
with him, I asked him how far it was from our island
to the shore, and whether the canoes were not often
lost, He told me there was no danger, no canoes
ever lost; but that, after a little way out to sea,
there was a current, and a wind always one way in
the morning, the other in the afternoon.

This I understand to be no more than the sets of
the tide, as going out or coming in; but I after-
wards understood it was occasioned by the great
draught and reflux of the mighty river Oroonoque ;
in the mouth of which river, as 1 thought~after~
wards, our island lay; and that this land, which I
perceived to the W. and N. W. was the great. island
Trinidad, on the north point of the mouth of the
river. I asked Friday a thousand questions about
the country, the inhabitants, the sea, the coast,'and
what nations were near: he told me all he knew,
with the greatest openness imaginable. I asked
him. the names of the several nations of his sort of
people, but could get no other name than- Caribs ;
from whence I easily understood, that these were
the Carribbees, which our maps place on that part of
America which reaches from the mouth of the river
Oroonoque to Guiana, and onwards to St. Martha.
He told me, that up a great way beyond the moon,
that was, beyond the setting of the moon, which
must be west'from their country, there dwelt white,
bearded men, like me, and pointed to my great
whiskers, which I mentioned before ; and that they
had killed ' much mans,' that was his'word. By all
which I understood he meant the Spaniards, whose
crueltics in' America had been spread over the whole
countries, and were remembered by all the nations
from father to son. ' ' '

I inquired if he could tell me how I might come
from this island, and get among those white men:
he told me, yes, yes, I might go in ' two canoe.' I
could not understand what he meant by ' two
canoe,' till at last, with great difficulty, I found he
meant, that it must" be in a large, great boat, as big
as two canoes. ' ' ' " '

This part of Friday's discourse began to relish
with me very well: and from this time I entertained
some hopes, that, one time. or other, I might find an
Opportuinty to make my escape from this place, and
that this poor savage might be a means to help me
to do it.

During the long time that Friday had now been
with me, and that he began to speak tome, and
understand me, 'I was not wanting to lay a foun-
dation of religious knowledge in his mind; particu~
larly I asked him one time, who made him. The
poor creature did not understand me at all, but
thought I had asked who was his father. But I
took it by another handle, and asked him, who made
the sea, the ground he walked on, and the hills and
woods. He told me, it was one old Benamuckee,
that lived beyond all. He could describe nothing
Of this great person, but that he was very old;
much older, he said, than the sea or the land, than
the moon or the Stats. I asked him then, if this
old person had made all things, why did not all
things worship him. He looked very grave. and
with a perfect look of innocence, said, ' All things
said O to him.' I asked him if the peeple who die
in his country went away any where. 118 said,
yes, they ,all went to Benamuckee. Then I asked
him, whether those they eat up went thither too:
he said, ' Yes.' '

From these things I began to instruct him in the
knowledge of the true God. I told him, that the
great Maker of all things lived up there, pointing
up towards heaven: that he governs the world by
the same power and providence by which he had
made it: that he was omnipotent, could do every
thing for us, give every thing to us, take every
thing from us; and thus, by degrees, I opened his
eyes. He listened withgreat attention, and re-
ceived with pleasure the notion of Jesus Christ
being sent to redeem us, and of the manner of mak-
ing our prayers to God, and his being able to hear
us, even into heaven. He told me one day, that if
our God could hear us up beyond the sun, he must
needs be a greater God than their Benamuckee, who
lived but a little way off, and yet could not hear,
till they went up to the great mountains where he
dwelt, to speak to him. i asked him, if ever he
went thither to speak to him: he said, no; they
never went that were young men; none went thither
but the old men, whom he called their Oowokakee,
that-is, as I made him explain it to me, their re-
ligious, or clergy; and that they went to say 0 (so
he called saying prayers), and then came back, and
told them what Benamuckee said. By this I ob-
served, that there is priestcraft even amongst the
most blinded ignorant Pagans in the world; and
the policy of making a secret religion, in order to
preserve the veneration of the maple to the clergy,
is not only to be found in the Roman, but perhaps
among all religions in the world, even among the
most brutish and barbarous savages.

I endeavoured to clear up this fraud to my man
Friday, and told him, that the pretence of their
old men going up to the mountains to say 0 to their
god Benamuckee, was a cheat; and their bringing
word from thence what he said, was much more so ;
that if they met with any answer, or Spoke with any
one there, it must be with an evil spirit: and then
I entered into a long discourse with him about the
devil, the original of him, his rebellion against God,
his enmity to man, the reason 'of it, his setting him-
self up in the dark parts of the world to be wor-
shipped instead of God, and as God, and the many
stratagems he made use of, to delude mankind to
their ruin; how he had a secret access to our pas-
sions, and to our affections, to adapt his snares so to
our inclinations, as to cause us even to be our own
tempters, and to run upon our own destruction, by
our own choice.

I found it was not so easy to imprint right no-
tions in his mind about the devil, as it was about
the being of a God. Nature assisted all my argu-
ments to evidence to him even the necessity of a
great First Cause, and over-ruling, governing power.
a secret, directing providence, and of the equity and
justice of paying homage to him that made us, and
the like: but there appeared nothing of all this in
the notion of an evil spirit, of his original,his being,
his nature, and, above all, of his inclination to do
evil, and to draw us in to do so too. And the poor
creature puzzled me. once in such a manner, by a
question merely natural and innocent, that I scarce
knew what to say to him. I had been talking a
great deal to him of the power of God, his omni-
potence, his dreadful aversion to sin, his being a
consuming fire to the workers of iniquity; how, as
he had made us all, he could destroy us, and all the
world, in a moment: and he listened with great
seriousness to me all the while. -

After this, I had been telling him how the devil
was God's enemy in the hearts of men, and used all
his malice and skill to defeat the good designs of
Providence, and to ruin the kingdom of Christ in
the world, and the like: ' Well,' says Friday, ' but
you say, God is so strong, so great, is he not much
strong, much might, as the devil?' ' Yes, yes,' said
I, ' Friday, God is stronger than the .devil, God is
above the devil, and therefore we pray to God to
tread him under our feet, and enable us to resist
his temptations, and quench his fiery darts.' ' But,'
says he again, ' if God much strong, much might,
asthe devil, why God not kill the devil, so make
him no more wicked?'

I was strangely surprised at his question, and
after all, though I was now an old man, yet 1 was
but a young doctor, and ill enough qualified for a
casuist, or a solver of difficulties: and, at first, I
could not tell what to say 5 so I pretended not to
hear him, and asked him what he said. But he
was too earnest for an answer to forget his ques-
tion, so that he repeated it in the very same broken
words as above. By this time I had recovered my-
self a Little, and I said, ' God will at last punish
himseverely; he. is reserved for the judgement, and
is to becast into the bottomless pit, to dwell with
everlasting fire.' This did not satisfy Friday; but
he returnsupon me, repeating my words, '. Reserve
at last! me no understand. But why not kill the
devil now, not kill great ago?' ' You may as well
ask me,'isaid I, ' why God does not kill you and
me, when we do wicked things here that offend
him: we are preserved to repent and be pardoned.'
He muses awhile at this: ' Well, well,' says he,
mighty affectionately, ' that well; so you, I, devil,
all wicked, all preserve, repent, God pardon all.'
Here I was run down again by him to the last de-
gree, and it was a testimony to me, how the mere
notions of nature, though they will guide reason-
able creatures to the knowledge of a God, and of a
worship or homage due to the supreme being of
God, as the consequence of our nature; yet nothing
but Divine revelation can form the knowledge of
Jesus Christ, and of a redemption purchased for
us, of a mediator of a new covenant, and of an in
tercessor at the footstsool of God's throne; I say,
nothing but a revelation from heaven can form
these in the soul; and that therefore the Gospel of
our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, I mean, the
word of God,.and the' Spirit of God, promised for
the guide and sanctifier of his peOple, are the ab-'
solutely necessary instructors of the souls of men
in the saving knowledge of God, and the means of
salvation.

I therefore diverted the present discourse be-
tween me and my man, rising up hastily, as upon'
some sudden occasion of going out; then sending
him for something a great way off, I seriously
Frayed to God that he would enable me to instruct
savingly this poor savage, assisting by his Spirit the
heart of the poor ignorant creature to receive the
light of the knowledge of God in Christ, reconciling
him to himself, and would guide me to speak so to
him from the word of God, as his conscience might
be convinced, his eyes opened, and his soul saved.
When he came again' to me, I entered into a long
discourse with .him upon the subject of the redemp-
tion of man, by the Saviour of the world, and of
the doctrine of the Gospel preached from heaven,
Viz. of repentance towards God, and faith in our.
blessed Lord Jesus. I then explained to him, as
Well as I could, why our blessed Redeemer took
not on him the nature of angels, but the seed of
Abraham, and how, for that reason, the fallen an.
gals had no share in the redemption; that he came
only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel, and
the like.

I had, God knows, more sincerity than know-
ledge, in all the methods I took for this poor crea-
ture's instruction; and must acknowledge what I
believe all that act upon the same principle will
find, that, in laying things open to him, I really in-
fOrmed and instructed myself in many things that
either I did not know, or had not fully considered
before; but which occurred naturally to my mind,
upon my searching into them for the information of
this poor savage; and I had more affection in my
inquiry after things upon this occasion, than ever I
felt before; so that whether this poor wild wretch
was the better for me or no, I had great reason to
be thankful that ever he came to me: my grief sat
lighter upon me, my habitation grew comfortable to
me beyond measure; and when I reflected, that, in
this solitary life which I had been confined to, I
' had not only been moved myself to look up to
heaven, and to seek to the Hand that brought me
thither, but was now to be made an instrument,
under Providence, to save the life, and for aught I
knew, the soul, of a poor savage, and bring him to
the true knowledge of religion, and of the Christian
doctrine, that he might know Christ Jesus, ' to
know whom is life eternal ;' I say, when I reflected
upon all these things. a secret joy ran through
' every part of my soul, and I frequently rejoiced
that ever I was brought to this place, which 1 had
often thought the most dreadful of all afflictions
that could possibly have befallen me.

In this thankful frame I continued all the re
mainder of my time; and the conversation which
employed the hours between Friday and me was
such as made the three years, which we lived there
together, perfectly and completely happy, if any
such thing as complete happiness can be found in a
sublunary state. The savage was now a good Chris-
tian; a much better than 1: though I have reason
to lmpe, and bless God for it, that we were equal-
ly penitent, and comforted restored penitents. We
had here the word of God to read, and no farther
off from his Spirit to instruct," than if we had been
in England.

I always applied myself to reading the Scripture,
and to let him know, as well as I could, the mean-
ing of what I read; and he again, by his serious
inquiries and questions, made me, as I said before:
a much better scholar in the Scripture knowledge
than 1 should ever have been by my own mere pri-
vate reading. Another thing I cannot refrain from
observing here also, from experience, in this re-
tired part of my life; viz. how infinite aad inex-
pressible a blessing it is, that the knowledge of God,
and of the doctrine of Salvation by Christ Jesus, is
so plainly laid down in the word of God, so easyto
be received and understood, that as the bare read-
ing the Scripture made me capable of understand-
ing enough of my duty to carry me directly on to
'the great work of sincere repentance for my sins,
and laying hold of a Saviour for life and salvation,
to a stated reformation in practice, and obedience
to all God's commands, and this without any
teacher or instructor (I mean human); so the same
plain instruction sufficiently served to the enlight-
ening this savage creature, and bringing him to be
such a Christian, as I have known few equal to him
in my life.

As to the disputes. wranglings, strife, and con-
tention, which hashappencd in the world about re-
ligion, whether niceties in doctrines, or schemes of
church government, they were all perfectly useless
to us, as, for anght I can yet see, they have been
to all the rest in the world. We had the sure guide
to heaven: via. the word of God ; and we had.
blessed be God! comfortable views of the Spirit of
God, teaching and instructing us by his word, lead-
ing us into all truth, and making us both willing
and obedient to the instruction of his word; and I
cannot see the least use that the greatest knowledge
of the disputed points in religion, which have made
such confusions in the world. would have been to
us, if we could have obtained it. But I must go
on with the historical part of things, and take every
part in its order.

After Friday and I became more intimately ace
quainted, and that he could understand almost all
I said to him, and speak fluently, though in broken
English, to me, I acquainted him with my own story,
or at least so much of it as related to my coming
into the place, how I had lived there, and howlong.
I let him into the mystery (for such it was to him)
of gunpowder and bullet, and taught him how to
shoot. I gave him a knife, which he was wonder.
fully delighted with, and I made him a belt with a
frog hanging to it, such as in England we wear
hangers in; and, in the frog, instead of.a hanger,"
I gave him a hatchet, which was not only as good
a weapon in some cases, but much more useful upon
many occasions. .

I described to him the countries of Europe, and
particularly England, which I came from; how we
lived, how we worshipped God, how we behaved to
one another, and how we traded in ships to all
parts of the world. I gave him an account of the
wreck which I had been on board of, and showed-
him, as near as I could, the place where she lay,
but she was all beaten in pieces long before, and
quite gone.

I showed him the ruins of our boat, which we
lost when I escaped, and which I could not stir
with my whole strength then, but was now fallen
almost all to pieces. Upon seeing this boat, Friday
stood musing a great while, and said nothing. 'I
asked him what it was he studied upon; at last,
says he, ' Me see such boat like come to place at
my nation.' '

I did not understand him a good while; but, at
last, when I had examined further into it, I under-
stood by him, that a boat, such as that had been.
came on shore upon the country where he lived;
that is, as he eXplained it, was driven thither by
stress of weather. I presently imagined, that some
European ship must have been cast away upon
their coast, and the boat might get loose, and drive
ashore; but was so dull that I never once thought
of men making escape from a wreck thither, much
less whence they might come; so I only inquired
after a description of the boat.
Friday described the boat to me well enough; but
brought me better to understand him when he add-
ed, with some warmth, ' We save the white mans
from drown.' Then I presently asked him if there
were any white mans, as he called them, in the
boat: ' Yes,' he said, ' the boat full of white mans.'
I asked him, ' How many?' He told upon his fin-
gers seventeen. I asked him then, ' What became
of them?' He told me, ' They live, they dwell at
my nation.'

This put new thoughts into my head again; for
1 presently imagined, that these might be the men
belonging to the ship that was cast away in sight
of my island, as I now call it; and who, after the
ship was struck on the rock, and they saw her in-
evitably lost, had saved themselves in their .boat,
and were landed upon that wild shore, among the
savages.

Upon this, I inquired of him more critically, what
was become of them: he assured me they lived still
there; that they had been there about four years;
that the savages let them alone, and gave them vic-
tuals to live. I asked him, how it came to pass

' they did not kill them, and eat them. He said,
' No, they make brother with them;' that is, as I
understood him, a truce: and then he added, 'They
no eat mans, but when make the war light; ' that is
to say, they never eat any men, but such as come to
fight with them, and are taken in battle.

It Was after this, some considerable time, that
being on the top of the hill, at the east side of the
island, from whence, as I have said, I had, in a
clear day, discovered the main or continent of
America; Friday, the weather being very serene,
looks very earnestly towards the main land, and, in
a kind of surprise, fails a jumping and dancing, and
calls out to me, for I was at some distance from
him: ' I asked him what was the matter. ' 0 joy!'
says .he, ' 0 glad! There see my country! there
my nation! '
I observed an extraordinary sense of pleasure'ap-
peared in his face, and his eyes sparkled. and his
countenance discovered a strange eagerness, as if he
had a mind to be in his own country again; and
this observation of mine put a great many thoughts
into me, which made me at first not so easy about
my new man Friday, as I was before; and I made
no doubt, but that if Friday could get back to his
own nation again, he would not only forget all his
religion, but all his obligation to me; and would be
forward enough to give his countrymen an account
of me, and come back, perhaps, with a hundred or
two of them, and make a feast; upon me, at which
he might be as merry as he used to be with those
of his enemies, when they were taken in war.

But I wronged the poor honest creature very
much, for which I was very sorry afterwards: how-
ever, as my jealousy increased, and held me some
weeks, I was a little more circumspect, and not so
familiar and kind to him as before; in which I was
certainly in the wrong too, the honest, grateful
creature having no thought about it, but what con-
sisted of the best principles, both as a religious
Christian, and as a grateful friend, as appeared afo
terwards to my full satisfaction. '

Whilst my jealousy of him lasted, you may be
sure I was every day pumping him to see if he
would discover any of the new thoughts, which I
suspected were in him; but I found every thing he
said was honest, and so innocent, that I could find
nothing to nourish my suspicion; and, in spite Of
all my uneasiness, he made me at last entirely his
own again; nor did he in the least perceive, thatl
was uneasy; and therefore I could not suspect him
of deceit.

One day,' walking up the same hill, but the wea-
ther being hazy at sea, so that we could not see the
continent, I called to him, and said, ' Friday, do not
you wish yourself in your own country, your own
nation." ' Yes,' he said, ' I be much 0 glad to be
at my own nation.' ' What would you do there 2'
said I: ' would you turn wild again, eat man's
flesh again, and be a savage as you were before."
He looked full of concern, and shaking his head,
said, ' No, no ; Friday tell them to live good, tell
them to pray God, tell them to eat corn-bread,
cattlediesh, milk: no eat man again.' ' Why then,'
said I to him, ' they will kill you.' He looked grave
at that, and then said, ' N 0, they no kill me; they
willing love learn.' He meant by this, they would
be willing to learn: he added, they learned much of
the bearded mans that came in the boat. Then I
asked him, if he would go back to them. He smiled
at that, and told me he could not swim so far. I
told him I would make a canoe for him. He told
me he would go, if I would go with him. ' I go! '
said I, ' why they will eat me, if I come there.'
' No, no,' says he, ' me make them no eat you: me
make they much love you.' He meant he would
tell them how I had killed his enemies, and saved
his life, and so he would make them love me.
Then he told me, as well as he could, how kind
they were to seventeen white men, or bearded men,
as he called them, who came on shore there in
distress. . .

From this time, I confess, I had a mind to ven-
ture over, and see if I could possibly join with these
bearded men, who,'I made no doubt, were Spani- '
ards or Portuguese; not doubting but, if I could,
we might find some method to escape from thence,
being upon the continent. and a good company
tOgether, better than I could from an island, forty
miles off the shore, and alone without help. 'So,
after some days, I took Friday to work again, by
Way of discourse ; and told him, I would give him a
boat to go back to his own nation; and accordingly,
I_ carried him to my frigate, which lay on the other
side of the island; and having cleared it of water
{for I always kept it. sunk in the water) I brought
1' 00% showed it him, and we both went into it.
I found he was a most dexterous fellow at manag-
ing it, would make it go almost as swift'and fast
again as I could; so when he was in, I said to him,
' Well, now, Friday, shall we go to your nation 1"
He looked very dull at my saying so, which it
seems, was because he thought the boat too small
to go so far. I told him then I had a bigger;'so
the next day, I went to the place where the first
boat lay which I had made, but which I could not
get into the water. He said that was big enough;
but then, as I had taken no care of it, and it had
lain two or three-and-twenty years there, the sun
had split and dried it, that it was in a manner rot-
ten. Friday told me that such a heat would do
very well, and would carry ' much enough vittle,
drink, bread;' that was his way of talking.

Upon the whole, I was by this time so fixed upon
my design of going over with him to the continent,
that I told him we would go and make one as big
as that, and he should go home in it. He an.
swered not one word, but looked very grave and
sad. I asked him what was the matter with him.
He asked me again thus, ' Why you angry mad
with Friday? What me done?' I asked him what
he meant: I told him I was not angry with him at
all. ' No angry! no angry!' says he, repeating the
words several times: ' why send Friday home away
to my nation?' ' Why,' said I, ' Friday did you not
say you wished you were there?' ' Yes, yes,' says
he, ' wish we both there; no wish Friday there, no
master there.' In a word, he would not think of
going there without me. ' I go there, Friday! ' said
I: ' what should I do there?' He turned very
quick upon me at this: ' You do great deal much
good,' says he; ' you teach wild mans be good.
sober, tame mans: you tell them know God, pray
God, and live new life.' ' Alas, Friday,' said I.
' thou knowest not what thou sayest: I am but an
ignorant man myself.' ' Yes, ' yes,' says he, ' you
teachee me good, you teachee them good.' ' No, no;Friday} said I, ' you shall go without me: leave

'me here to. live by myself, as I did before. He

looked confused again at that word; and, running
to one of the hatchets which he used to wear, he'
takes it up hastily, and gives it me. ' What must I
do with this?' said I to him. ' You take kill Fri.
day,' says he. ' What must I kill you for?' said I
again. He returns very quick, ' What you send
Friday away for? Take kill Friday: No send Friday
away.' This he spoke so earnestly, that 1 saw tears
stand in his eyes. In a word, I so plainly disco-
vered the utmost affection in him to me, and-a firm
resolution in him, that I told him then, and often
after, that I would never send him away from me,
if he was willing to stay with me.

Upon the whole, as I found, by all his discourse.
a settled affection to me, and that nothing should
part him from me, so I found all the foundation of
his desire to go to his own country was laid in his
ardent affection to the peeple, and his hopes of my
doing them good; a thing, which as I had no 110-
tion of myself, so I had not the least thought, or
intention, or desire of undertaking it. But still I
found a strong inclination to my attempting an es-
cape, as above, founded on the supposition gather-
ed from the former discourse; viz. that there were
seventeen bearded men there; and therefore, with-
out any more delay, I went to work with Friday, to
find out a great tree proper to fell, and make a large
Periagua, or canoe, to undertake the voyage. There
were trees enough in the island to have built a little
fleet, not of periaguas and canoes only, but even
0f good large vessels; but the main thing I looked
at, Was to get one so near the water, that we might
launch it when it was made, to avoid the mistake I
committed at first.

At last Friday pitched upon a tree; for I found
he knew much better than I what kind of wood was
fittest for it; nor can I tell, to this day, what wood
to call the tree we cut down, except that it was

M
very like the tree we call fustic, or between that
'and the Nicaragua wood, for it was'much of the
same colour and smell. Friday was for burning the
hollow or cavity of this tree out, to make it into a
boat: but I. showed him how rather to cut it out
with tools, which after I showed him how to use,
he did it very handily; and in about a month's
hard labour, we finished it, and made it very hand-
some, especially when with our axes, which I show-
ed him how to handle, we cut and hewed the out-
side into the true shape of a boat. After this.how'
ever, it cost us near a. fortnight's time to get her
along, as it were, inch by inch, upon great rollers.
into the water: but when she was in, she would
have carried twenty men with great case.

When she was in the water, and though she was
so big, it amazed me to see with what dexterity and
how swift my man Friday would manage her, turn
her, and paddle her along. 30 I asked him if he
would, and if we might, venture over in her; ' Yes}
he said, ' me venture over in her very well, though
great blow wind.' However, I had a farther design
that he knewnothing of, and that was to make a
mast and a sail, and to-fit her with an anchor and
cable. As to a mast, that was easy enough to get;
so I pitched upon a straight young cedar-tree, which
I found near the place, and which there was great
plenty of in the island; and 1 set Friday to work to
cut it down, and gave him directions how to shape
and order it: but as to the sail, that was my parti-
cular care. I knew I had old sails, or rather pieces
of old sails enough, but as I had had them now
twenty-six years by me, and had not been very care.
ful to preserve them, not imagining that 1 should
ever have this kind of use for them, I did not doubt
but they were all rotten; and indeed most of them
were so. However, I found two pieces which 7811'
peared pretty good, and with these I went to work;
and with a great deal of pains, and awkward tedious
stitching (you may be sure), for want of needles; I
at length made a thremcornered ugly thing, like
what we call in England, a shoulder-of-mutton sail,
to go with a boom at bottom, and a little short sprit
at the top, such as usually our ships' long-boats sail
with, and such as I best knew howlto manage, be-
cause it was such a one as I used in the boat in
which I made my escape from Barbary, as related
in the first part of my story.

. .- I was near two months performing this last work;
viz. rigging and fitting my mast and sails; for I
finished them very complete, making a small stay,
and a sail or fore-sail to it, to assist, if we should
turn to windward; and, which was more than all,
1 fixed a rudder to the stern of her, to steer with:
and though I was but a bungling shipwright, yet as
ngnew the usefulness and even necessity of such a
thing, I applied myself with so much pains to do it,
that at last I brought it to pass; though, consider-
ing the many dull contrivances I had for it that
failed, I think it cost me almost as much labour as
making the boat. - ~ -

After-all this was done, I had my man Friday to
teach as to what belonged to the navigation of my
boat; for though he knew very well how to paddle
the canoe, he knew nothing what belonged to a sail
and a rudder, and was the most amazed when he
saw me work the boat'to-and-again in the sea, by
the rudder, and how the sail gibbed, and filled this
Way or that way, as the course we sailed changed ;
Isay, when he saw this, he stood like one astonish-
ed and amazed. However, with a little use, I made
all these things familiar to him, and he became an
eXpert sailor, except that as to the compass, I could
make him understandvery little of that: on the
Other hand, as there was very little cloudy weather,
and seldom or never any fogs in those parts, there
was the less occasion for a compass, seeing the stars
were always to be seen by night, and the shore by
day, except in the rainy seasons; and then nobody
- cared to stir abroad, either by land or sea.
I was now-entered on the seven-and-twentieth
year of my captivity in this place ; though the three
last years that I had this creature with me ought
rather to be left out of the account, my habitation
being quite of another kind, than in all the rest of
the time. I kept the anniversary of my landing
here, with the same thankfnlness to God for his
mercies as at first; and if I had such cause of ac-
knowledgement at first, 1 had much more so now,
having such additional testimonies of the care of
Providence over me, and the great hopes I had of
being effectually and speedily delivered: for I had
an invincible impression upon my thoughts, that my
deliverance was at hand, and that I should not be
another year in this place. However, I went on
with my husbandry, digging, planting, fencing, as
usual; I gathered and cured my grapes, and did
every necessary thing, as before.

The rainy season was in the mean time upon me,
when I kept more within doors than at other times;
so I had stowed our new vessel as secure as we
could, bringing her up into the creek, where, as I
said in the beginning, I landed my rafts from the
ship: and hauling her up to the shore, at high-
water mark, I made my man Friday dig a little
dock, just big enough to hold her, and just deep
,enough to give her water enough to float in; and
then when the tide was out, we made a strong dam
cross the end of it, to keep the water out ; and so
she lay dry, as to the tide from the sea; and to
keep the rain off, we laid a great many boughs of
trees so thick, that she was as well thatched 388
house: and thus we waited for the months of N0.
. 'vember and December, in which I designed to make
my adventure. -

When the settled season began to come in, as the
thought of my design returned with the fair wea-
ther, I was preparing daily for the voyage; and the
first thing I did was to lay by a certain quantity.0f
provisions, being the stores for our voyage; and m-
tended, in a week or a fortnight's time, to 'open the
dock, and launch out our boat. I was busy one
morning upon something of this kind, whenI called
to Friday, and bade him go to the sea-shore, and
see if he could find a turtle, or tortoise, a thing
which we generally got once a week, for the sake of
the eggs, as well as the flesh. Friday had not been
long gone, when he came running back, and flew
over my outward wall, or fence, like one that felt
not the ground, or the steps he set his feet on; and
before I had time to speak to him, he cried out to
me, ' 0 master! 0 master! 0 sorrow! 0 bad! '
' What's the matter, Friday." said I. ' 0 yonder
there,' says he, ' one, two, three canoe! one, two,
three!' By this way of speaking, I concluded there
were six; but, on inquiry, 1 found there were but
three. ' Well, Friday,' said I, ' do not be frighted :'
50 I heartened him up as well as I could. How-
degV913 I saw the poor fellow was most terribly scared ;
for nothing ran in his head but that they. were
come to look for him, and would cut him in pieces,
and eat him; and the poor fellow trembled so, that
I scarce knew what to do with him. I comforted
him as well as I could, and told him I was in as
much danger as he, and that they would eat me as
Well as him. ' But,' said I, ' Friday, we must re-
solve to fight them. Can you fight, Friday 2 ' ' Me
31'0"} says he; ' but there come many great num-
ber.' ' No matter for that,' said I again, ' our guns
Will fright them that we do not kill.' So I asked
him, whether, if I resolved to defend him, he would
dfifend me, and stand by me, and do just as I bade
lflmo He said, ' Me die, when you bid die, master.'
50 I went and fetched a good dram of rum, and
gave him 3 for I had been so good a husband of my
rum, that I had a great deal left. When he had
drank it, I made him take the two fowling~pieces,
which we always carried, and load them with large
Swan-shot, as big as small pistol-bullets: then 1 took
four muskets, and loaded them with two slugs, and
five small bullets each; and my two pistols I load-
ed v'aith a brace of bullets each. I hung my great
sword, as usual, naked by my side, and gave Friday
his hatchet.

When I had thus prepared myself, I took my per-
spective glass, and went up to the side of the hill,
to see what I could discover; and I found quickly,
by my glass, that there were oneand-twenty savages,
three prisoners, and three canoes; and that their
whole business seemed to be the triumphant ban-
quet upon these three human bodies (a barbarous
feast indeed D: but nothing more than as I had ot-
served was usual with them.

I observed also, that they were landed, not where
they had done when Friday made his escape, but
nearer to my creek, where the shore was low, and
where a thick wood came close almost down to the
sea. . This, with the'abhorrence of the inhuman er-
rand these wretches came about, so filled me with
indignation, that I came down again to Friday, and
told him I was resolved to go down to them, and
kill them all; and asked him if he would stand by
me. He had now gotten over his fright, and his
spirits being a, little raised with the dram I had given
him, he was very cheerful; and told me, as before, -
' he would die, when I bid die.'

In this fit of fury, I took first and divided the
arms which I had charged, as before, between us:
I gave Friday one pistol to stick in'his girdle, and
three guns upon his shoulder; and I took one pis-
tol, and the other three myself; .and in this posture '
we marched out. I took a small bottle of rum in
my pocket, and gave Friday a large bag with more
powder and bullet; and as to orders, I charged him
to keep close behind me, and not to stir, or shoot.
or do any thing till I bade him; 'and, in the mean .
time, not to speak a word. In this posture I fetched'
a compass to my right hand of near a mile, as we"
to get over the creek as to get into the wood; so
that I might come within shot of them, before 1
should be discovered,which I had seen by my glass
it was easy to do. .

While I was making this march, my former thoughts
returning, I began to abate my resolution. I do not
mean that I entertained any fear of their number:
for as they were naked. unarmed wretches, it is cer-
tain I was superior to them; nay. though I had been
alone: but it occurred to my thoughts, what call,
what occasion, much less what necessity I was in,
to go and dip my hands in blood, to attack people
who had neither done nor intended me any wrong;
who, as to me, were innocent, and whose barbarous
customs were their own disaster, being in them a
token indeed of God's having left them, with the
other nations of that part of the world, to such
stupidity, and to such inhuman courses; but did not
call me to take upon me to be a judge of their ac.
tions, much less an executioner of his justice: that
wheneverhe thought fit. he would take the cause
into his own hands, and, by national vengeance, pu-
nish them for national crimes; but that in the mean
time, it was none of my business: that it was true,
Friday might justify it, because he was a declared
enemy, and in a state of war with those very par-
ticular people, and it was lawful for him to attack
them; but I could not say the same with respect to
me. These things were so warmly pressed upon
my thoughts all the way as I went, that I resolved
I would only go and place myself near them, that I
'might observe their barbarous feast, and that I
would act then as God should direct; but that, un-
less something ofl'ered that was more a call to me
than yet I knewof, I would not meddle with them.

With this resolution I entered the wood, and with
all possible wariness and silence (Friday following
close at my heels), I marched till 1 came to the
skirt of the wood, on the side which was next to
them; only that one corner of the wood lay be-
tween me and them. Here I called softly to Fri-
day, and showing him a great tree, which wasjust
at the corner of the wood, I bade him go to the tree.
and bring me word if he could see there plainly
what they were doing. He did so, and came im-
mediately back to me, and told me they might be
plainly viewed there; that they were all about the
fire, eating the flesh of one of their prisoners; and
that another lay bound upon the sand, a little from
them, whom, he said, they would kill next, and
which fired the very soul within me. He told me
it was not one of their nation, but one of the beard-
ed men whom he had told me of, that came to
their country in the boat. I was filled with horror at
the very naming the white, bearded man; and.
going to the tree, I saw plainly, by my glass, a
white man, who lay upon the beach of the sea, with
his hands and his feet tied with flags, or things like
rushes; and that he was an European, and had
clothes on.

There was another tree, and a little thicket be,
yond it, about fifty yards nearer to them than the
place where I was, which, by going a little way
about, I saw I might come at undiscovered, and
that then I should be within half shot of them. So
I withheld my passion, thoughI was indeed enraged
to the highest degree; and, going back about twenty
prices, I got behind some bushes, which held all the
way till I came to the other tree, and then 1 came
to a little rising ground, which gave me a full view
of them, at the distance of about eighty yards.

1 had now not a moment to lose; for nineteen of
the dreadful wretches sat upon the ground, all close
huddled together, and had just sent the other two to
butcher the poor Christian, and bring him, perhaps,
limb by limb, to their fire: and they were stooped
down to untie the bands at his feet. I turned to Fri-
day: ' Now Friday,' said I, ' do as I bid thee.' Fri'
day said he would. ' Then Friday,' said I, ' do ex-
actly as you see me do; fail in nothing.' So I set
down one of the muskets, and the fowiingopiece.
upon the ground, and Friday did the like by his;
and with the other musket I took my aim at the sa-
vages, bidding him'to do the like: then asking him if
he was ready, he said, ' Yes.' ' Then fire at them,'
said I ; and the same moment I fired also.

Friday took his aim so much .better than I, that
on the side that he shot, he killed two of them, and
wounded three more; and, on my side, I killed
one, and wounded two. They were, you may be
sure, in a dreadful consternation; and all of them,
who were not hurt, jumped up upon their feet im-
mediately, but did not know which way to run, or
which way to look; for they knew not from whence
their destruction came. Friday kept his eyes close
upon me, that, as I had hid him, he might observe
what I did: so, as soon as the first shot was made,
I threw down the piece, and took up the fowling-
piece, and Friday did the like: he sees me cock and
present; he did the same again.' ' Are you ready,
Friday?' said I. ' Yes,' said he. ' Let fly, then,'
said I, ' in the name of God ;' and with thatI fired
again among the amazed wretches, and so dld'Fri-
day; and as our pieces were now loaden with what
I called swan~shot, or small pistol-b ullets, we found -
only two drop; but so many were wounded, that
they ran about yelling and screaming like mad
creatures, all bloody and miserably wounded, most
of them; whereof three more fell quickly after,
though not quite dead.

.' Now, Friday,' said I, laying down the discharged
Pieces, and taking up the musket, which was yet
loaden, ' follow me,' said I; which he did, with a
deal of courage; upon which I rushed out of the
wood, and showed myself, and Friday close at my
f00t. As soon as I perceived they saw me, I shout-
ed as loud 1131 could, and bade Friday do so too;
and running as fast as I could, which, by the way,
was not very fast, being loaded with arms as I was,
I made directly towards the poor victim, who was,
as I said,--lying upon the beach or shore, between
the place where they sat, and the sea. The two.

N 2
butchers who were just going to work with him, had
left him, at the surprise of our first fire, and fled, in
a terrible fright, to the sea-side, and had jumped
into a canoe, and three more of the rest made the
same way. I turned to Friday, and bade him step
forwards, and fire at them: he understood me im-
mediately, and, running about forty yards to be near
them, he shot at them, and I thought he had killed
them all; for I saw them all fall on a heap in the
boat; though I saw two of them up again quickly:
however, he killed two of them, and wounded the
third, so that he lay down in the bottom of the
boat, as if he had been dead.

While my man Friday fired at them, I pulled out
my knife, and cut the flags that bound the poor vics
tim; and, loosing his hands and feet, I lifted him
up, and asked him, in the Portuguese tongue, what
he was. He answered, in Latin,' Christianus : ' but
was so weak and faint, that he could scarce stand,
or speak. I took my bottle out of my pocket, and
gave it him, making signs that he should drink,
which he did; and I gave him a piece of bread.
which he eat. Then I asked him what countryman
he was ; and he said, ' Espagnole:' and, being a
little recovered, let me know, by all the signs he
could possibly. make, how much he was in my debt
for his deliverance. ' Seignor,' said I, with as much
Spanish as I could make up, ' we will talk after-
wards, but we must fight now: if you have any
strength left, take this pistol and sword, and lay
about. you.' He took them very thankfully, and no
sooner had he the arms in his hands, but, as if they
had put new vigour into him, he flew upon his mur'
deters, like a fury, and had out two of them in
pieces in an instant; for the truth is, as the whole
- was a surprise to them, so the poor creatures were
so much frighted with the noise of our pieces, that
they fell down for mere amazement and fear, and
had no more power to attempt their own escape:
than their flesh had to resist our shot; and that
was the case of those five that Friday shot at in the .
boat; for as three of them fell with the hurt they
received, so the other two fell with the fright.

I kept my piece in my hand still, without firing,
being willing to keep my charge ready, because I had
given the Spaniard my pistol and sword; so I called
to Friday, and bade him run up to the tree from
whence we first fired, and fetch the arms which lay
there, that had been discharged, which he did with
great swiftness; and then giving him my musket, I
sat down myself to load all the rest again, and bade
them come to me when they wanted. While I was
loading these pieces, there happened a fierce en-
gagement between the Spaniard and one of the
savages, who made at him with one of their great
wooden swords, the same weapon that was to have
killed him before, if I' had not prevented it. The
Spaniard, who was as bold and as brave as could be
imagined, though wealr, had fought this Indian a
good while, and had cut him two great wounds on
his head; but the savage, being a stout, lusty fellow,
closing in with him, had thrown him down (being
faint), and was wringing my sword out of his hand,
when the Spaniard, though undermost, Wisely quit.
ting the sword, drew the pistol from his girdle, shot
the savage through the body, and killed him upon
the spot, before I, who was running to help, could
come near him.

Friday, being now left at his liberty, pursued the
flying wretches with no weapon in his hand but his
hatchet; and with that he dispatched those three
who, as I said before, were wounded at first and
fallen, and all the rest he could come up with; and
the Spaniard coming to me for a gun, I gave him one
of the fowling-pieces, with which he pursued two of
the savages, and wounded them both; but as he was
not able to run, they both got from him into the
wood, where Friday pursued them, and killed one
of them; but the other was too nimble for him;
and though he was wounded, yet had plunged into
the sea, and swam,.with all his might, ofl" to those
two who were left in the canoe, which three in the
canoe, with one wounded, we know notwhether
he died or no, were all that escaped our hands, '
of one-and-twenty. The account of the rest is as

follows:

3 Killed at our shot from the tree.

2 Killed at the next shot.

2 Killed by Friday in the boat.

2 Killed by ditto, of those at first wounded.

1 Killed by ditto, in the wood.

3 Killed by the Spaniard.

4. Killed, being found dropped here and there, of
their wounds, or killed by Friday in his chase
of them.

4 Escaped in the boat, whereof one wounded, if
not dead.

has----

Those that were in theccanoe, worked hard to get
out of gun-shot; and though Friday made two or
.three shot at them, I did not find that he hit any
of them. Friday would fain have had me take one
of their canoes, and pursue them, and indeed I was
fieryanxious about their escape, lest, carrying the
news home to their people, they should come back,
perhaps, with two or three hundred of their-canoes,
and devour us by mere multitude; so I consented
to pursue them by sea; and running to one of their
canoes, I jumped in, and bade Friday follow me;
but when I was in the canoe, I was surprised to
find another poor creature lie there alive, bound
' hand and foot, as the Spaniard was, for the slaugh-
ter, and almost dead with fear, not knowing what
-the matter was, for he had not been able to look
up over the side of the boat: he was tied so hard.
neck and heels, and had been tied so long, that he
had really little life in him.
I immediately cut the twisted'flags, or rushes,
which they had bound- him with, and would have
helped him ,up; but he could not stand, or speak,
but groaned most piteously, believing, it seems, still,
that he was only unbound in order to be killed.

When Friday-came to him,I bade him speak to
him, and tell him of his deliveranceyand pulling
out my bottle, made him give the poor wretch a
dram, which, with the news of his being delivered,
revived him, and he sat up in the boat; but when
Friday came to hear him. speak, and looked in his
face, it would have moved any one to tears, to have
seen how Friday kissed him, embraced him, hugged
him, cried, laughed, hallooed, jumped about, danced,
Sung, then cried again, wrung his hands, beat his
own face and head, and then sung and jumped about
again, like a distracted creature. It was a good
while before I cauld make him speak to me, or tell
me what was the matter; but when he came a little
to himself, he told me, that it was his father.

It is not "easy for me to express how it moved
me, to see what ectasy and filial affection .had
worked in this poor savage, at the sight of his
father, and of his being delivered from death; nor
indeed can I describe half the extravagances of his
affection after this; for he went into the boat, and
.out of the boat, a great many times. When he went
in to him, he would sit down by him, open 'his
breast, and hold his father's head close to his bosom,
half an hour together, to nourish it; then he took
his arms and ancles, which were numbed and stiff
with the binding. and chafed and rubbed them with
his hands; and I, perceiving what the case was,
gave him some rum out of my bottle to rub them
with, which did them a great deal of good. '

This action put an end to our pursuit of the canoe
with the other savages, who were now gotten almost
out of eight; and it was happy for us that we did
not. for it blew so hard within two hours after, and
before they could be gotten a quarter of their way,
and continued blowing so hard all night, and that
from the north-west, which was against them, thatI
could not suppose their boat could live, or that they
ever reached to their own coast.

But to return to Friday, he was so busy about
his father, that I could not find in my heart to take
him off, for some time: but after I thought he
could leave him a little, I called him to me, and he
came jumping and laughing, and pleased to the high-
est extreme. Then I asked him, if he had given his
father any bread. He shook his head, and said,
' None: ugly dog eat all up self.' 50 I gave him a
cake of bread out of a little pouch I carried on pur-
pose; I also gave him a dram for himself, but he
would not taste it: but carried it to his father. I
had in my pocket also two or three bunches of my
raisins, so I gave him a handful of them for his
father. He had no sooner given his father these
raisins, but I saw him come out of the boat, and run
away, as if he had been bewitched. He ran at such
arate (for he was the swiftest fellow of his foot that
ever I saw), I say, he ran at such a rate, that he was
out of sight, as it were, in an instant 3 and though I
called and hallooed too after him, it was all one:
away he went, and, in a quarter of an hour, I saw
him come back again, though not so fast as he went;
and as he came nearer, I found his pace was slacker,
because lie-had something in his hand.

When he came up to me, I found he had been
quite home for an earthen jug, or pot, to bring his
father some fresh water; and that he had got two
more cakes or loaves of bread. The bread he gave
me,but the water he carried to his father: however;
as I was 'very thirsty too, I took a little sup of it-
This water revived his father more than all the rum
or spirits I had given him: for he was just fainting
with thirst.

When his father had drunk, I called to him to
know if there was any water left: he said, ' Y85:'
and l bade him give it to the poor Spaniard, who was
in. as much want of it as his father; and I sent one
of the cakes, that Friday brought, to the Spaniard
too, who was indeed very weak, and was reposing
himself upon a green place, under the shade of a
tree, and whose limbs were also very stiff, and very
much swelled with the rude bandage he had been
tied with. When I saw that upon Friday's coming
to him with the water, he sat up, and drank, and
took the bread, and began to eat, I went to him,
and gave him a handful of raisins. He looked up
in my face with all the tokens of gratitude and
thankfulness that could appear in any countenance;
but was so weak, notwithstanding he had so exerted
himself in the fight, that he could not stand up upon
his feet: he tried to do it two or three times, but
was really not able, his ancles were so swelled, and
so painful to him; 'so I bade him sit still, and caused
Friday to rub his ancles,_and bathe them with rum,
as he had done his father's.

I observed the poor affectionate creature every
two minutes, or perhaps less, all the while he was
here, turned his head about, to see if his father was
in the same place and posture as he left him sitting;
and at last he found he was not to be seen, at which
he started up, and. without speaking a word, flew
with that swiftness to him, that one could scarce
perceive his 'feet to touch the ground as he went:
but when he came, he only found he had laid him-
self down to ease his limbs. So Friday came back to
me presently; and I then spoke to the Spaniard to
let Friday help him up, if he could, and lead him
to the boat, and then he should carry him to our
Mailing, where I would take care of him; but
Friday, a lusty young fellow, took the Spaniard
finite up upon his back, and carried him away to the
boat, and set him down softly upon the side or gun-
nel of the canoe, with his feet in the inside of it,
and then lifted him quite in, and set him close to his
father, and presently stepping out again, launched
the boat on", and paddled it along the shore faster
than I could walk, though the wind blew pretty
hard too; so he brought them both safe into our
creek, and leaving them in-the boat, runs away to
fetch the other canoe. - As he passed me, I spoke
to him, and asked him whither he went. -He told
me, ' Go fetch more boat.' So away he went, like
the wind ; for sure never man or horse ran like him;
and he had the other canoe in the creek, almost as
soon as I got to it by land: so he wafted me over,
and then went to help our new guests out of the
boat, which he did; but they were neither of them able
to walk; so that poor Friday knew not what to 'do.

To remedy this, I went to work in my thought,
and calling to Friday to bid them sit down on the
bank while he came to me, I soon made a kind of
hand-barrow to lay them on, and Friday and I car<<
ried them up both together upon it between us.
But when we got them to the outside of our wall,
or fortification, we were at a worse loss than before,
for it was impossible to get them over; and I was
resolved not to break it down. So I set to work
again; and Friday and-I, in about two hour's time,
made a very handsome tent, covered with old sails,
and above that with boughs of trees, being in the
space without our outward fence, and between that
and the grove of young wood which I had planted:
and here we made them two beds of such things as
I had; viz. of good rice straw, with blankets laid
upon it to lie on, and another to cover them on
each bed.

My island was now peopled, and I thought my
self very r1ch1n subjects; and it was a merry reflec-
tion which I frequently made, how like a king I
looked. First of all, the whole country was my own
mere property, so that I had an undoubted right of
dominion. Secondly, my people were perfectly sub-
jected: I was the absolute lord and lawgiver: they
all owed their lives to me, and were ready to 185'
down their lives, if there had been occasion of
it, far me. It was 1emarkable too, I had but three
subjects, and they were of three different religions:
my man Friday was a protestant; his father was a

' pagan and a cannibal; and the Spaniard wasa papist.

However, I allowed liberty of conscience throughout
my dominions. But this is by the way.

As soon as I had secured my two' weak, rescued
prisoners, and given them shelter, and a place to
rest them upon, I began to think of making some
provision for them : and the first thing I did, I or-
dered Friday to take a yearling goat, betwixt a kid
and a goat, out of my particular flock. to be killed.
Then I cut off the hinder quarter, and chopping it
into small pieces, I set Friday to work to boiling and
stewing, and made them a very good dish, I assure
you, of flesh and broth, having put some barley and
rice also into the broth; and as I cooked it without
doors, for I made no fire within my inner wall, so I
carried it all into the new tent: and having "set a
table there for them, I sat down and eat my dinner
also with them; and, as well as I could, cheered
them and encouraged them, Friday being my inter-
preter, especially to his father, and indeed to the
Spaniard too; for the Spaniard spoke the language
of the savages pretty well.

After we had dined, or rather supped, I ordered
Friday to take one of the canoes, and go and fetch
O'Hr muskets and other fire-arms, which, for want of
tline, we had left upon the place of battle; and the
next day I ordered him to go and bury the dead
bodies of the savages, which lay open to the sun,
and would'presently be offensive; and I also or-
dered him to bury the horrid remains of their bar--
barous feast, which I knew were pretty much, and
Which I could not think of doing myself; nay, I
could not bear to see them, if I went that way. All
which he punctually performed, and defaced the very
appearance of the savages being there; so that when
1 went again, 1 could scarce know where it was,
otherwise than by the corner of the wood, pointing
to the place. ' I
I then began to enter into a little conversation
with my two new subjects ; and first I set Friday to
inquire of his father what he thought of the escape of
the savages in that canoe, and whether we might
expect a return of them with a power too great for
us to resist. His first opinion was, that the savages
in the boat never could live out the storm which
blew that night they went off, but must of neces>>
sity be drowned or driven south to those other
shores, where they were as sure to be devoured as
they wereto be drowned, if they were cast away:
but as to what they would do, if they came safe on
shore, he said, he knew not; but it was his~0pinion
that they were so dreadfully frighted with the manner
of their being attacked, the noise, and the fire, that
he believed they would tell their people they were
all killed by thunder and lightning, and not by the
hand of man; and that the two which appeared
(viz. Friday and l) were two heavenly Spirits or
furies come down to destroy them, and not men with
weapons. This, he said, he knew, because he heard
them all cry out so in their language to one another;
for it wasimpossible to them to conceive that a man
could dart fire, and speak thunder, and hill at 3
distance, without lifting up the hand, as was done
now. - And this old savage was in the right; for. as
I understood since by other hands, the savages of
that part never attempted to go over to the island
afterwards. They were so terrified with the accounts
given by those four men (for it seems they did
escape the sea), that they believed, whoever went
to that enchanted island, would be destroyed with
fire from the gods.

This, however, I knew not, and therefore was un'
der continual apprehensions for a good while, and
kept always upon my guard, I and all my army; for
as we were now four of us, I would have ventured
upon a hundred of them fairly, in the open field, at
any time. -

In a little time, however, no more canoes appear-
ing, the fear of their coming wore elf, and I began
to take my former thoughts of a voyage to the main
into consideration, being likewise assured by Fri-
day's father, that I might depend upon good usage
from their nation, on his account, if I would go.

But my thoughts were a little suspended, when I
had a serious discourse with the Spaniard, and when
I understood that there were sixteen more of his
countrymen and Portuguese, who having been cast
away, and made their escape to that side, lived
there at peace indeed with the savages, but were
very sore put to it for necessaries,-and indeed for
life. .I asked him all the particulars of their voy-
age, and found they were a Spanish ship, bound
from the Rio de la Plata, to the Havanna, being di-
rected to leave their loading there, which was chiefly
hides and silver, and to bring back what European
goods they could meet with there; that they had
live Portuguese seamen on board, whom they took
out of another wreck; that five of their own men
were drowned when first their ship was lost; and
that these escaped through infinite dangers and ha-
zards, and arrived almost starved on the cannibal
"35C/. where they expected to have been devoured
every moment. , . _

He told me, they had some arms with them, but
they were perfectly useless, for that they had nei-
ther powder nor hall, the washing of the sea having
Spoiled all their powder, but a little which they used

I asked him what he thought would become of
them there; and if they had formed no design of
making any 'escape. . He said, they had many con-
sultations about it: but that having neither ves-
51"], nor tools to build one, nor provisions of any
kmfi. their counsels always ended in tears and de-
Spair.

I asked him how he thought they would receive
a proposal from me, which might tend towards an
escape; and whether, if they were all here, it might
not be done. I told him, with freedom, I feared
mostly their treachery and ill usage of me, if I put
my life into their hands; for that gratitude was no
inherent virtue in the nature of man ; nor did men
always square their dealings by the obligations they
had received, so much as they did by the advan-
tages they expected. I told him it would be very
hard, that I should be the instrument of their de-
liverance, and that they should afterwards make me
their prisoner in New Spain, where an Englishman '
was certain to be made a sacrifice, what necessity
or what accident soever, brought him thither: and
that I had rather be delivered up to the savages,
and be devoured alive, than fall into the merciless
claws of the priests, and be carried into the Inqui-
sition. I added, that otherwise I was persuaded, if
they were all here, we might, with so many hands,
build a bark large enough to carry us all away,
either to the Brasils southward, or to the islands,
or Spanish coast northward: but that if, in requital,
they should, when I had put weapons into their
hands, carry me, by force, among their own people,
I might be ill used for my kindness to them, and
make my case worse than it was before.

-IIe' answered with a' great deal of candour and
ingenuity, that their condition was so miserable,
and they were so sensible of it,-that he believed
they would abhor the thought of using any man
unkindly, that should contribute to their deliver.
ance ; and that, if I pleased, he would go to them
with the old man, and discourse with them about it,
and return again, and bring me their answer: that
he would make conditions with them, upon their
solemn oath, that they should be absolutely under
my leading, as their commander and captain; and
that they should swear upon the holy sacraments
and the Gospel, to be true to me, and to go to such
Christian country as I should agree to, and no
other; and to be directed wholly and absolutely
by my orders. till they were landed safely in such
country as I intended; and that he would bring
a contract from them, under their hands, for that
purpose. '

Then he told me, he would first swear to me
himself, that he would never stir from me as long
as he lived, till I gave him orders; and that he
would take my side to the last. drop of blood, if
there should happen the least breach of faith among
his countrymen.

He told me they were all of them very civil,
honest men, and they were under the greatest dis-
tress imaginable, having neither weapons nor clothes,
nor any food, but at the mercy and discretion of
the savages, out of all hopes of ever returning to
their own country; and that he was sure, if I
would undertake their relief, they would live and
die by me. .

Upon these assurances, I resolved to venture to
relieve them, if possible, and to send the old savage
and this Spaniard over to them to treat. But when
he had gotten all things in readiness to go, the Spa-
niard himself started an objection, which had so
much prudence in it on one hand, and so much
sincerity on the other hand, that I could not but
be very well satisfied in it; and, by his advice, put
oil" the deliverance of his comrades for at least half
a year. The case wasthus:

He had been with us now about a month, during
which time I had let him see in what manner I had
Provided, with the assistance of Providence, for my
support; and .he saw evidently what stock of corn-
and rice I had laid up, which, as it was more than
sufficient for myself, so it was not sufficient, at least,
Without good husbandry, for my family, now it was
increased to number four: but much less would it
be sufficient, if his countrymen, who were, as he
said, fourteen, still alive, should come over; and,
least of all, would it be sufficient to victual our
vessel, if we should build one, for a voyage to any
of the Christian colonies of'America. So he told me,
he thought it would be more advisable 'to let him,
and the two other, dig and cultivate some more
land, as much as I could spare seed to sow; and
that we should wait another harvest, that we might
have a supply of corn for his countrymen, when
they should come; for want might be a temptation
to them to disagree, or not to think themselves de-
livered, otherwise than out of one difficulty into
another. ' You know,' says he, ' the children of
Israel, though they rejoiced at first at their being
delivered out of Egypt, yet rebelled even against
God himself, that delivered them, when they came
to want bread in the wilderness.' - .

His caution was so seasonable, and his advice so
good, that I could not but be very well pleased
with his proposal, as well as I was satisfied with
his fidelity. So we fell to digging all four of us,
as well as the wooden tools we were furnished with
permitted; and in about a month's time, by the end
of which it was seed-time, we had gotten as much
land cured and- trimmed up as we sowed twenty-
two bushels of barley on, and sixteen jars of rice,
which was, in 'short, all the seed we had to spare;
nor indeed did we leave ourselves barley sufficient
for our own food, for the six months that we had to
expect our crop, that is to say, reckoning from the
time we set our seed aside for sowing , for it is not
to be supposed it is six months in the ground in
that country.

'Having new society enough, and our number
being sufficient to put us out of fear of the savages,
if they had come, unless their number had been
very great, we went freely all over the island,where-
ever we found occasion; and as here we had our
escape or deliverance upon our thoughts, it was im-
possible, at least for me, to have the means of it
out of mine. To this purpose, I marked out several
trees, which I thought fit for our work, and I set
Friday and his father to cutting them down; and"v ""7""? .

ROBINSON CRUSOEi 263

then I caused the Spaniard, to whom I imparted my
thoughts on that affair, to oversee and direct their
work, I showed them with what indefatigable pains
I had hewed a large tree into single planks, and I
caused them to do the like, till they had made
about a dozen large planks of good oak, near two
feet broad, thirty-five feet long, and from two inches
to four inches thick. What prodigious labour it
took up, any one may imagine.

At the same time, I contrived to increase my little
flock of tame goats as much as I could; and to this
purpose I made Friday and the Spaniard go out one
day, and myself with Friday the next day; for we
took our turns: and, by this means, we got about
twenty young kids to breed up with the rest; for
whenever we shot the dam, we saved the kids, and
added them to our flock. But, above all, the season
for curing the grapes coming on, I caused such a
prodigious quantity to lie hung up in the sun, that
I believe, had we been at Alicant, where the raisins
of the sun are cured, we should have filled sixty or
eighty barrels; and these, with our bread, was a
great part of our food, and very good living too, I
assure you; for it is an exceeding nourishing food.

It was now harvest, and" our crop in good order.
It was not the most plentiful increase 1 had seen in
the island, but, however, it was enough to answer
0ur end; for from our twenty-two bushels of barley,
"'6 brought in and threshed out above two hundred
"lid twenty bushels, and the like in proportion of the
rice, which was store enough for our food to the next
harvest, though all the sixteen Spaniards had been on
there with me'; or, if we had been ready fora voyage,
"5 would very plentifull y have victualled our ship, to
have carried us to any part of the world, that is'to
"LO? America. When we had thus housed and
Secured our magazine of corn, we fell to work to
make more wicker-work ; viz. great baskets, in which
we kept it: and the Spaniard was very handy and
dexterous at this part, and often blamed me, that I

O
did not make some things for defence, of this kind
of work, but I saw no need of it.

And now having a full supply of food for all the
guests I expected, I gave the Spaniard leave to go
over to the main, to see what he could do with those
he had left behind him there. I gave him a strict
charge in writing not to bring any man with him, who
would not first swear in the presence of himself, and
of the old savage, that he would no way injure, fight
with,or attack the person he should find in the island,
who was so kind as to send for them, in order to their
deliverance; but that they would stand by and dc-
fend him against all such attempts; and, wherever
they went, would be entirely under, and subjected to,
his command; and that this should be put in writing,
and signed with their hands. How we were to have
this done, when I knew they had neither pen nor ink,
that indeed was a question which we never asked. '

Under these instructions, the Spaniard. and the
old savage (the father of Friday), went away in one
of the canoes, which they might be said to come in.
or rather were brought in, when they came as pri'
soners to be devoured by the savages.

I gave each of them a musket, with a fircloclc on
it, and about eight charges of powder and ball,
charging them to be very good husbands of both,
and not to use either of them but upon urgent
'occasron.

This was a cheerfu'l work, being the first mea'
sures used by me, in view of my deliverance, for
now twentyseven years and some days. I gave
them provisions of bread, and of dried grapes, suf'
ficient for themselves for many days, and sufficient
for all their countrymen for about eight days' time;
and wishing them a good voyage, I let them go:
agreeing with them about a signal they should hang
out at their return, by which 1 should know them
again, when they came back, at a distance, before
they came on shore.

They went away, with a fair gale, on the day that
the moon was at the full; by my account, in the
month of October: but as for the exact reckoning
of days. after I had once lost it, I could never
recover it again; nor had I even kept the number
of years so punctually as to be sure that I was right,
though, as it proved, when I afterwards examined
my account, I found I had kept a true reckoning
of years.

It was no less than eight days I waited for them,
when a strange and unforeseen accident intervened,
of which the like has not, perhaps, been heard of
in history. I was fast asleep in my hutch one morn-
ing, when my man Friday came running in to me,
and called aloud, " Master, master, they are come,
they are come ! '

I jumped up, and regardless of danger, I went

out, as soon as I could get my clothes on, through
my little grove, which (by the way) was by this
time grown to be a very thick wood; I say, regard;
less of danger, I went without my arms, which was
not my custom to do; but I was surprised, when,
turning my eyes to the sea, I presently saw a boat,
at about a league and a half '5 distance, standing in
for the shore, with a shoulder-of-mutton sail, as
they call it, and the wind blowing pretty fair to
bring them. in. Also I observed presently, that
they did not come from that side which the shore
"3' on, but from the southernmost end of the island.
Upon this, I called Friday in, and bade him lie
dose, for these were not the people we looked for,
. and that we did not know yet whether they were
friends or enemies.
. In the next place, I went in to fetch my perspec-
tlve. glass, to see what I could make of them; and
having taken the ladder out, I climbed up to 'the
top of the hill, as I used to do when I was appre-
hensive of any thing, and to take my view the
Warner, without being discovered.

lhad scarce set my foot on the hill, when my
eye plainly discovered a ship lying at an anchor, at

N
about two leagues and a half's distance from me,-
S. S. E. but not above a league and a half from the
shore. By my observation, it appeared plainly to
be an English ship, and the boat appeared to be an
English long-boat.

I cannot express the confusion I was in, though
the joy of seeing a ship, and one which, I had rea-
son to believe, was manned by my own countrymen, '
and consequently friends, was such as I cannot de-
scribe; but yet I had some secret doubts hung
about me, I cannot tell from whence they came.
bidding me keep upon my guard. In the first place,
it occurred to me to consider what business an
English ship could have in that part of the world,
since it was not the way to or from any part of
the world where the English had any traffic; and
I knew there had been no storms to drive them in
there, as in distress; and that if they were Eng-
lish really, it was most probable that they were here
upon no good design, and that I had better conti'
nue as I was, than fall into the hands of thieves and
murderers.

Let no man despise the secret hints and notices
of danger, which sometimes are given him, when he
may think there is no possibility of its being real-
That such hints and notices are given us, 'I believe
few, that have made any observations of things, can
deny; 'that they are certain discoveries of an invisi'
ble world, and a converse of spirits, we cannot
doubt; and if the tendency of them seems to be to
warn us of danger, why should we not suppose thel'
are from some friendly agent (whether supreme, 0'
inferior and subordinate, is not the question), and
that they are given for our good?

The present question abundantly confirms me in
the justice of this reasoning; for had I not been
made cautious by this secret admonition, come It
from whence it will, 1 had been undone inevitably:
and in a far worse condition than before, as you WI"
see presently.
I had not kept myself long in this posture, when
I saw the boat draw near the shore, as if they looked
for a creek to thrust in at, for the convenience of
landing: however, as they did not come quite far
enough, they did not see the little inlet where I for-
merly landed my rafts, but run their boat on shore
upon the beach, at about half a mile from me, which
was very happy for me; for otherwise they would
have landed just, as I may say. at my door, and
would soon have beaten me out of my castle, and,
perhaps, have plundered me of all I bad.

When they were on shore, I was fully satisfied
they were Englishmen, at least, most of them: one
or two I thought were Dutch, but it did not prove
so. There were in all eleven men, whereof three I
found were unarmed, and (as I thought) bound;
and when the first four or five of them were jumped
on shore, they took those three out of the boat as
prisoners. One of the three I could perceive using
the most passionate gestures of entreaty, affliction,
and despair, even to a kind of extravagance; the
other two I could perceive lifted up their hands
Sometimes, and appeared concerned indeed, but
not to such a degree as the first.

I was perfectly confounded at the sight, and knew
not what the-meaning of it should be. Friday call-
ed out to me, in English, as well as he could, ' 0
master, you see English mans eat prisoners as well
as savage mans.' ' Why,' said I, ' Friday, do you
think they are going to eat them then?' ' Yes,'
says Friday, .' they will eat them.' ' No, no,' said I,
' Friday; I am afraid they will murder them indeed ;
but: you may be sure they will not eat them.'

All this while I had no thought of what the mat-
ter really was, but stood trembling with the horror
0f the sight, expecting every moment, when the
three prisoners should be killed; nay, once I saw
One of the villains lift up his arm, with a great cut-
la9:3(513 the seamen call it) or sword, to strike one of
the poor men; and I expected to see him fall every
moment, at which all the blood in my body seemed
to run chill in my veins.

I wished heartily now for my Spaniard, and the
savage that was gone with him; or that I had any
way to have come undiscovered within shot of
them, that I might have rescued the three men; for
I saw no fire-arms they had among them: but it fell
out to my mind another way.

After I had observed the outrageous usage of the
three men, by the insolent seamen, I observed the
fellows ran scattering about the land, as if they
wanted to see the country. I observed also, that
the three other men had liberty to go where they
pleased; but they sat down all three upon the
ground very pensive, and looked like men in de-
spair.

This put me in mind of the first time when I came
on shore, and began to look about me: how I gave
myself over for lost, how wildly I looked round me,
what dreadful apprehensions I had, and how I
lodged in the tree all night, for fear of being (is.
voured by wild beasts.

As I knew nothing that night of the supply I was
to receive, by the providential driving of the ship
nearer the land, by the storms and tide, by which I
have since been so long nourished and supported;
so these three poor, desolate men, knew nothing
how certain of deliverance and supply they were,
how near it was to them, and how effectually and
really they were in a condition of safety, at the
same time that they thought themselves lost, and
their case desperate.

So little do we see before us in the world, and so
much reason have we to depend cheerfully upon '
the great Maker of the world, that he does not
leave his creatures so absolutely destitute, but that
in the worst circumstances they have always some-
thing to be thankful for, and sometimes are nearer
their deliverance than they imagine; nay, are
even brought to their deliverance by the means by
which they seem to be brought to their destruc-
tion. -

It was just at the top of high-water when these
people came on shore, and while partly they stood
parlying with the prisoners they brought, and partly
while they rambled about to see what kind of place
they were in, they had carelessly staid till the tide
was spent, and the water was ebbed considerably
away, leaving their boat aground.

They had left two men in the boat, who, as I
found afterwards, having drank a little too much
brandy, fell asleep. However, one of them waking
sooner than the other, and finding the boat too fast
aground for him to stir it, hallooed for the rest,
who were straggling about, upon which they all
soon came to the boat; but it was past all their
strength to launch her, the boat being very heavy,
and the shore on that side being a soft, oosy sand,
almost like a quicksand.

In this condition, like true seamen, who are, per-

hang, the least of all mankind given to forethought,
they gave it over, and away they strolled about the
country again ; and I heard one of them say aloud
to another (calling them off from the boat), ' Why,
19t her alone, Jack, can't ye? She'll float next tide.'
By which I was fully confirmed in the main inquiry,
of what countrymen they were.
_ All this while, I kept myself close, not once dar
mg to stir out of my castle, any farther than to my
Place of observation, near the top of the hill ; and
very glad I was to think how well it was fortified.
I knew it was no less than ten hours before the
boat could be afloat again, and by that time it
would be dark, and I might be more at liberty to
see their motions, and to hear their discourse, if
they had any.

In the mean time, I fitted myself up for a battle,
as before, though with more caution, knowing I had
t0 do with another kind of enemy than I had at
"St. I ordered Friday also, whom I had made an
excellent marksman with his gun, to load himself
with arms. I took myself two fowling-pieces, andI
gave him three muskets. My figure indeed was very
fierce: Iliad my formidable goat-skin coat on, with
the great cap I have mentioned, a naked sword by
my side, two pistols in my belt, and a gun upon
each shoulder.

It was my design, as I said above, not to have
made any attempt. till it Was dark; but about two
o'clock, being the heat of the day, I found, that, in
short, they were all gone straggling into the woods,
and, as I thought, were all laid down to sleep. The
three poor distressed men, too anxious for their
condition to get any sleep, were, however, set down
under the shelter of a great tree, at about a quarter
of a mile from me, and, as I thought, out of sight of
any of the rest.

Upon this, I resolved to discover myself to them,
and learn something of their condition. Immedi-
ately I marched, in the figure above; my man Frio
day at a good distance behind me, as formidable
for his arms as I, but not making quite so staring a
spectre-like figure as I did.

I came as near them undiscovered as I could, and
then, before any of them saw me, 1 called aloud to
them, in Spanish, ' What are ye, gentlemen?'

They started up at the noise, but were ten times
more confounded when they sawme, and the un'
couth figure that I made. They made no answer
at all, but I thought I perceived them just going to
fly from me, when I spoke to them in English:
' Gentlemen,' said I, ' do not be surprised at me:
perhaps you may have a friend near you, when you
did not expect it.' ' He must be sent directly from
Heaven then,' said one of them, very gravely to me.
and pulling off his hat at the same time; ' for our
condition is past the help of man.' ' All help is
from Heaven, sir,' said I. ' But can you put a
stranger in the way how to help you ; for you seem
to me to be. in some great distress? I saw you when
you landed; and when you seemed to make appli-
cation to the brutes that came with you, I saw one '
of them lift up his sword to kill you.' '

The poor man, with tears running down his face,
and trembling, looking like one astonished, returned,
' Am I talking to God or man? Is it a real man, or
an angel?' ' Be in no fear about that, sir,' said I.
' If God had sent an angel to relieve you, he would
have come better clothed, and armed after another
manner, than you see me. Pray lay aside your
fears; I am a man, an Englishman, and disposed to
assist you, you see. I have one servant only: we
have arms and ammunition. Tell us freely: can
we serve you? What is your case?'

' Our case,' said he, ' sir, is too long to tell you,
while our murderers are so near; but, in short, sir,
I was commander of that ship; my men having mu-
tinied against me, they have been hardly prevailed
on not to murder me, and, at last, have set me on
shore in this desolate place, with these two men
with me, one my mate, the other a passenger, where
we expected to perish, believing the place to be un-
inhabited, and know not yet what to think of it.'

' Where are those brutes, your enemies?' said I.
' Do you know where they are gone?' ' There they
are, sir,' said he, pointing to a thicket of trees. ' My
heart trembles for fear they have seen us, and heard
you speak; if they have, they will certainly murder
us all.'

' Have they any firearms ?' said 1. He answered
they had only two pieces, and one which they left
in the boat. ' Well then,' said I, ' leave the rest to
me. I see they are all asleep. It is an easy thing
to kill them all: but shall we rather take them
prisoners?' He told me there were two desperate
villains among them, that it was scarce safe to show
any mercy to; but if they were secured, he believed
all the rest would return to their duty. I asked
him which they were. He told me he could not at
that distance describe them; but he would obey my
orders in any thing I would direct.' ' Well,' said I.
' let us retreat out of their view or hearing, lest
they awake; and we will resolve farther.' So they
willingly went back with me, till the woods covered
us from them.

' Look you, sir,' said I, ' if I venture upon your
deliverance, are you willing to make two conditions
with me 2' He anticipated my proposals, by telling
me, that both he and the ship, if recovered, should
be wholly directed and commanded by me in every
thing; and if the ship was not recovered, he would
live and die with me, in what part of the world so-
ever I would send him; and the two other men said
the same.

-' Well,' said I, ' my conditions are but two: first,
That while you stay on this island with me, you
will not pretend to any authority here; and if I
put arms into your hands, you will, upon all oc-
casions, give them up to me, and do no prejudice
to me or mine, upon this island; and, in the mean
time, be governed by my orders.

Secondly, That if the ship is or may be recovered,
you will carry me and my man to England passage-
free. .

He gave me all the assurances that the invention
and_faith of man could devise, that he would comply
with these most reasonable demands; and, besides,
would owe his life to me, and acknowledge it upon
all occasions as long as he lived.

' Well, then,' said I,' ' here are three muskets for
you, with powder and ball. Tell me next what you
think is proper to be done.' He showed all the
testimony of his gratitude that he was able; but of-
fered to be wholly guided by me. I told him I
'thought it was hard venturing any thing, but the
best method I could think of, was to fire upon them
at once, as they lay; and if any were not killed at
the first volley, and offered to submit, we might
save them, and so put it Wholly upon God's provi-

'dcnce to direct the shot.
He said very modestly, that he was loath to kill
them, if he could help it; but that those two were
incorrigible villains, and had been the authors of
all the mutiny in the ship; and if they escaped, we
should be undone still; for they would go on board
and bring-the whole ship's company, and destroy us
all. ' Well then,' said I, ' necessity legitimates my
advice; for it is the only way to save our lives.'
However, seeing him still cautious of shedding
blood, I told him they should go themselves, and
manage as they found convenient.

In the middle of this discourse, we heard some
of them awake, and soon after we saw two of them
on their feet. I asked him if either of them were
the men who, he had said, were the heads of the
mutiny. He said, ' No.' ' Well then,' said I, ' you
may let them escape; and Providence seems to have
wakened them on purpose to save themselves. Now,'
said I, ' if the rest escape you, it is your fault.'

Animated with this, he took the musket I had
given him in his hand, and a pistol in his belt, and
his two comrades with him, with each man a piece
in his hand. The two men, who were with him,
going first, made some noise, at which one of the
seamen, who was awake, turned about, and, seeing
them coming, cried out to the rest; but it was too
late then, for the moment he cried out, they tired,
I mean the two men, the captain wisely reserving
his own piece. They had so well aimed their shot
at the men they knew, that one of them was killed
on the spot, and the other very much wounded;
but not being dead, he started up upon his feet,
and called eagerly for help to the other: but the
captain, stepping to him, told him it was too late
to cry for help; he should call upon God to forgive
his villainy, and, with that word, knocked him down,
with the stock of his musket, so that he never Spoke.
more. There were three more in the company, and
one of them was also slightly wounded. By this
time I was come; and when they saw their danger,

"N 2
and that it was in vain to resist, they begged for
mercy. The captain told them, he would spare their
lives, if they would give him any assurance of their
abhorrence of the treachery they had been guilty
of, and would swear to be faithful to him in reco-
vering the ship, and afterwards in carrying her back
to Jamaica, from whence they came. They gave
him all the protestations of their sincerity that
could be desired. and he was willing to believe them,
and spare their lives, which I was not against; only
1 obliged him to keep them bound, hand and foot,
while they were upon the island.

While this was doing, I sent Friday, with the cap-
tain's mate, to the boat, with orders to secure her,
and bring away the oars and sail, which they did;
and, by-and-by, three straggling men, that were
(happily for them) parted from the rest, came back,
upon hearing the guns fired; and seeing their cap-
tain, who was before their prisoner, now their con-
queror, they submitted to be bound also; and so
our victory was complete.

It now remained that the captain and I should
inquire into one another's circumstances. I began
first, and told him my whole history, which he
heard with an attention even to amazement, and
particularly at the wonderful manner of my being
furnished with provisions and ammunition; and in-
deed, as my story is a whole collection of wonders,
it affected him deeply; but when be reflected from
thence upon himself, and how I seemed to have
been preserved therk on purpose to save his life, the
tears ran down his face, and he could not speak a
word more.

After this communication was at an end, I car-
ried him, and his two men, into my apartment,
leading them in just where I came out, via. at the
top of the house, where 1 refreshed them with such
provisions as I had, and showed them all the con-
trivances I had made, during my long, long inhabit-
ing that place..uu

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 275

All I showed them, all I said to them, was per~
fectly amazing; but, above all, the captain admired
my fortification, and how perfectly I had concealed
my retreat with a grove of trees, which having been
now planted near twenty years, and the trees grow-
ing much faster than in England, was become a
little wood, and so thick that it was impassable in
any part of it, but at that one side where I had
reserved my little winding passage into it. This I
told him was my castle, and my residence; but that
I had a seat in the country, as most princes have,
whither I could retreat upon occasion, and 1 would
show him that too another time; but at present
our business was to consider, how to recover the
ship. He agreed with me as to that; but told me,
he was perfectly at a loss what measures to take,
for that there were still six-and-twenty hands on
board, who, having entered into a cursed conspiracy,
by which they had all forfeited their lives to the
law. would be hardened in it now by desperation,
and would carry it on, knowing that if they were
reduced, they should be brought to the gallows as
soon as they came to England, or to any of the
English colonies; and that therefore there would
be no attacking them with so small a number as
we were.

I mused for some time upon what he had said,
and found it was a very rational conclusion; and
that therefore something was to be resolved on
very Speedily, as well to draw the men on board
mto some snare for their surprise, as to prevent
their landing upon us, and destroying us. Upon
this it presently occurred to me, that, in a little
while, the ship's crew, wondering what was become
of. their comrades, and of the boat, would cer-
tainly come on shore in their other boat, to see
for them; and that then, perhaps, they might come
armed, and be too strong for us: this, he allowed,
was rational.

Upon this I told him the first thing we had to do
was to stave the boat, which lay upon the beach,
so that they might not carry her off: and taking
every thing out of her, leave her so far useless as
not to be fit to swim. Accordingly we went on
board, took the arms which were left on board out
of her, and whatever else we found there, which
was a bottle of brandy, and another of rum, a few
biscuit cakes, a horn of powder, and a great lump
of sugar, in a piece of canvass; the sugar was five
or six pounds: all which was very welcome to me,
especially the brandy and sugar, of whichl had had
none left for many years.

When we had carried all these things on shore
(the oars, mast, sail, and rudder of the boat, were
carried away before, as above), we knocked a great
hole in her bottom, that if they had come strong
enough to master us, yet they could not carry off
the boat.

Indeed it was not much in my thoughts, that we
could be capable to recover the ship ; but my view
was, that if they went away without the boat, I
did not much question to make her fit again to.
carry us away t0'the Leeward Islands, and call
upon our friends, the Spaniards, in my way 5 for I
had them still in my thoughts.

While we were thus preparing our designs, and
had first, by main strength, heaved the boat up
upon the beach, so high that the tide would not
float her off at high-water mark ; and, besides, had
broken a hole in her bottom too big to be quickly
stopped, and were sat down musing what we should
do, we heard the ship fire a gun, and saw her make a
waft with her ancient, as a signal for the boat to
come on board: but no boat stun-,ed and they fired
several times, making other signals for the boat.

At last, when all their signals and firings proved
fruitless, and they found the boat did not stir, we
saw them (by the help of my glasses) hoist an-
other boat out, and row towards the shore; and we
found, as they approached, that there were no less
than ten men in her, and that they had fire-arms
with them.

As the ship lay almost two leagues from the
shore, we had a full view of them as they came,
and a plain sight of the men, even of their faces;
because the tide having set them a little to the east
of the other boat, they rowed up under shore, to
come to the same place where the other had landed,
and where the boat lay.

By this means, I say, we had a full view of them,
.and the captain knew the persons and characters of
all the men in the boat, of whom he said that there
were three very honest fellows. who, he was sure,
were led into this conSpiracy by the rest, being
overpowered and frighted.

But that as for the boatswain, who,it seems, was
the chief ofiicer among. them, and all the rest, they
were as outrageous as any of the ship's crew; and
were, no doubt, made desperate in their new enter.
prise: and terribly apprehensive he was, that they
would be too powerful for us.

I smiled at him, and told him that men in our
circumstances were past the operations of fear: that
seeing almost every condition that could be, was
better than that which we were supposed to be in,
We ought to expect that the consequence, whether
death or life," would be sure to be a deliverance.
I asked him what he thought of the circumstances
of my life; and whether a deliverance were not
worth venturing for. ' And where, sir,' said I, ' is
your belief of my being preserved here on purpose
to save your life, which elevated you a little while
330? For my part,' said I, ' there seems to be but
one thing amiss in all the prospect of it.' ' What's
that?' said he. ' Why,' Said I, ' 'tis that, as you
Say. there are three or four honest fellows among
them, which should be spared; had they been all
of the \wicked part of the crew, I should have
thought God's providence had singled them out, to
deliver them into your hands ; for, depend upon it,
every man of them that comes ashore are our own,
and shall die or lix- e, as they behave to us.'

As I spoke this with a raised voice and cheerful
countenance, I found it greatly encouragedhim;
so we set vigorously to our business. We had,
upon the first appearance of the boat's coming from
the ship, considered of separating our prisoners,
and had indeed secured them efi'ectually.

Two of them, of whom the captain was less as-
sured than ordinary, I sent with Friday, and one
of the three delivered men to my cave, where they
were remote enough, and out of danger of being
heard or discovered, or of finding their way out of
the woods, if they could have delivered themselves.
Here they left them bound, but gave them provi-
sions, and promised them, if they continued there
quietly, to give them their liberty in a day or two;
but that if they attempted their escape, they should
be put to death without mercy. They promised
faithfully to bear their confinement with patience,
andwere very thankful that they had such good'
usage, as to have provisions and a light left them ;
for Friday gave them candles (such as we made
ourselves) for their comfort: and they did not
know but that he stood sentinel over them at the
entrance.

The other prisoners had better usage: two of
them were kept pinioned indeed; because the cap-
taiu was not free to trust them; but the other two
were taken into my service, upon their captain's
recommendation, and upon their solemnly engaging
to live and die with us; so, with them and the
three honest men, we were seven men, well armed;
and I made no doubt we should be able to deal
well enough with the ten that were acoming, con-
sidering that the captain had said there were three
or four honest men among them also.

As soon as they got to the place where their
other boat lay, they ran their boat into the beach.
and came all on shore, hauling the boat up after
them, which 1' was glad to see: for I was afraid
they would rather have left the boat at an anchor,
some distance from the shore, with some hands in
her to guard her; and so we should not be able to
seize the boat.

Being on shore, the first thing they did, they ran
all to the other boat; and it was easy to see they
were under a great surprise, to find her stripped,
as above, of all that was in her, and a great hole
in her bottom.

After they had mused awhile upon this, they set
up two or three great shouts, hallooing with all their
might, to try if they could make their companions
hear; but it was all to no purpose: then they
came all close in a ring, and fired a volley of their
small arms, which indeed we heard, and the echoes
made the woods ring : but it was all one; those in
the cave we were sure could not hear, and those in
our keeping, though they heard it well enough,
yet durst give no answer to them.

They were so astonished at the surprise of this,
that, as they told us afterwards, they resolved to
go all on board again to their ship, and let them
know there, that the men were all murdered, and
the long-boat staved: accordingly, they immedi-
ately launched their boat again, and got all of them
on board. v

The captain was terribly amazed, and even con-
founded at this, believing they would go on board
the ship again, and set sail, giving their comrades
for lost, and so he should still lose the ship, which
he was in hopes we should have recovered: but he
was quickly as much frighted the other way.

They had not been long put off with the boat, but
We perceived them all coming on shore again; but
With this new measure in their conduct, which, it
seems, they consulted together upon ; viz. to leave
three men in the boat, and the rest to go on shore,
and go up into the country,to look for their fellows.

This was a great disappointment to us; for now
we were at a loss what to do; for our seizing those
seven men on shore would be no- advantage to us,
if we let the boat escape, because they would then
row away to the ship; and then the rest of them
would be sure to weigh, and set sail, and so our
hope of recovering the ship would be lost. '

However, we had no remedy but to wait and see
what the issue of things might present. The seven
men came on shore, and the three who remained
in the boat, put her off to a good distance from the
shore, and came to an anchor to wait for them; so
that it was impossible for us to come at them in
the boat.

Those that came on shore kept close together,
'marching towards the tap of the little hill, under
which my habitation lay; and we could see them
plainly, though they could not perceive us. We
could have been very glad they would have come
nearer to us, so that we might have fired at them;
or that they would have gone farther off, that we
might have come abroad.

, But when they were come to the brow of the hill.
where they could see a great way into the valleys
and woods, which lay towards the north-east part,
and where the island lay lowest, they shouted and
hallooed till they were weary; and not caring, it
seems, to venture far from the shore, nor far from
one another, they sat down together under a tree,
to consider of it. Had they thought fit to have
gone to sleep there, as the other party of them had
done, they had done the job for us; but they were
too full of apprehensions of danger, to venture to g0
to sleep, though they could not tell what the dam
ger was they had to fear neither.

The captain made a veryjnst proposal to me upon
this consultation of theirs, viz. that perhaps they
would all fire a volley again, to endeavour to make ._
their fellows hear, and that We should all sally upon
them, just at the juncture when their pieces were
all discharged, and they would certainly yield, and
we should have them without bloodshed. I liked
the proposal, provided it was done while we were
near enough to come up to them, before they could
load their pieces again.

But this event did not happen, and we lay still
a longrtime, very irresolute what course to take:
at length I told them there would be nothing to be
done in my. opinion till night; and then, if they
did not return to the boat, perhaps we might find
a way to get between them and the shore, and so
might use somestratagem with "them in the boat, to
get them on shore.

We waited a great while, though very impatient
for their removing, and were very uneasy; when,
after long consultations, we saw them start all up,
and march down toward the sea. It seems, they
had such dreadful apprehensions upon them of the
danger of the place, that they resolved to go on
board the ship again, give their companions over for
105% and so go on with their intended voyage with
the ship. .

As soon as I perceived them go towards the shore,
I imagined it to be as it really was, that they had
given over their search, and were for going back
again; and the captain, as soon as I told him my
tlloughts, was ready to sink at the apprehensions of
it: but I presently thought of a stratagem to fetch
them back again, and which answered my end to a
little.

I ordered Friday, and the captain's mate, to go
over the little creek westward, towards the place
Where the savages came on shore when Friday was
rescued, and as soon as they came to a. little rising
ground, at about half a mile's distance, I bade them
llalloo as loud as they could, and wait till they
found the seamen heard them; that as'soon as
over they heard the seamen answer them, they
Should return it again, and then keeping out of
Sight. take a round, always answering when the
other hallooed, to draw them as far into the island
and among the woods as possible; and then Wheel
about again to me, by such ways as I directed.

They were just going into the boat, when Friday
and the mate hallooed, and they presently heard
them, and answering, run along the shore west-
ward, towards the voice they heard, when they
were presently stopped by the creek, where the
water being up, they could not get over, and called
for the boat to come up, and set them over, as in-
deed I expected.

When they had set themselves over, I observed
that the boat being gone up a good way into the
creek, and, as it were, in a harbour within the
land, they took one of the three men out of her to
go along with them, and left only two in the boat,
. having fastened her to the stump of a little tree on
the shore.

This was what I wished for; and immediately
leaving Friday and the captain's mate to their busi
ness, I took the rest with me, and crossing the
creek out of their sight, we surprised the two men
before they were aware, one of them lying on shore,
and the other being in the boat: the'fcllow on
shore was between sleeping and waking, and going
to start up, the captain, who was foremost, ran
in upon him, and knocked him down, and then
called out to him in the boat to yield, or he was a
dead man.

There needed very few arguments to persuade a
single man to yield, when he saw five men upon
him, and his cemrade knocked down: besides, this
was, it seems, one of the three who were not so
hearty in the mutiny as the rest of the crew, and
therefore was easily persuaded not only to yield,
but afterwards to join very sincerely with us.

In the mean time, Friday and the captain's mate .

so well managed their business with the rest, that
they drew them, by hallooing and answering, from
one hill to another, and from one wood to another,
till they not only heartily tired them, but left them
where they were very sure they could not reach.
back to the boat before it was dark: and indeed
they were heartily tired themselves also by the time
they came back to us.

We had nothing now to do but to watch for them
in the dark, and to fall upon them, so as to make
sure work with them.

It was several hours after Friday came back to
me, before they came back to their boat; and we
could hear the foremost of them, long before they
came quite up, calling to those behind to come
along, and could also hear them answer, and com-
plain how lame and tired they were, and not able
to come any faster, which was very welcome news
to us.

At length they came up to the boat; but it is
impossible to express their confusion when they
found the, boat fast aground in the creek, the tide
ebbed out, and their two men gone: we could hear
them call to one another, in a most lamentable man-
ner, telling one another they were gotten into an
enchanted island; that either there were inhabitants
in it, and they should all be murdered, or else there
were devils or spirits in it, and they should be all
carried away and devoured. '

They hallooed again, and called their two com-
rades by their names a great many times, but no
answer. After some time, we could see them, by
the little light there was, run about wringing their
hands, like men in despair; and that sometimes
they would go and sit down in the boat to rest
themselves, then come ashore again, and walk about
again, and so the same thing over again.

My men would fain have had me given them
leave to fall upon them at once in the dark; but
I was willing to take them at some advantage, so
to spare them, and kill as few of them as I could;
and especially I was unwilling to hazard the killing
any of our own men, knowing the other were very
Well armed. I resolved to wait to see if they did not
separate; and therefore, to make sure of them, I
drew my ambuscade nearer, and ordered Friday
and the captain to creep upon their hands and
feet, as close to the ground as they could, that they
might not be discovered, and get as near them as
they possibly could, before they offered to fire.

They had not been long in that posture, when
the boatswain, who was the principal ringleader .of
the mutiny, and had now shewn himself the most
dejected, and dispirited of all the rest, came walking
towards them, with two more of their crew. The
captain was so eager, at having the principal rogue
so much in his power, that he could hardly have
patience to let him come so near as to be sure of
him; for he only heard his tongue before: but
when they came' nearer, the captain and Friday
starting up on their feet, let fly at them.

The boatswain was killed upon the spot: the next
man was shot into the body, and fell just by him,
though he did not die till an hour or two after; ~
and the third ran for it.

At the noise of the fire, I immediately advanced
with my whole army, which was now eight men,
viz. myself, generalissimo; Friday, my lieutenant-- '
general; the captain, and his two men, and the
three prisoners of war, whom we had trusted with
arms.

We came upon them indeed in the dark, so that
they could not see our number; and I made the
man they had left in the boat, who was now one of
us, to call them by name, to try if I could bring
them to a parley, and so might perhaps reduce them
to terms, which fell out just as we desired: for in-
deed it was easy to think, as their condition then
was, they would be very willing to capitulate. So
he calls out, as loud as he could, to one of them,
' Tom Smith! Tom Smith !' Tom Smith answer-
ed immediately, ' Who's that? Robinson?' for it
seems he knew his voice. The other answered,
' Aye, aye; for God's sake. Tom Smith, throw down
your arms, and yield: or you are all dead men this
moment! '

' Who must we yield to? where are they?' says
Smith again. ' Here they are,' says he. ' Here is
our captain, and fifty men with him, have been
hunting you this two hours. The boatswain is
killed, Will Frye is wounded, and I am a prisoner;
and if you do not yield, you are all lost.'

' Will they give us quarter then?' says Tom Smith,
' and we will yield.' ' I'll go and ask, if you pro-
mise to yield,' says Robinson. 50 he asked the
captain, and the captain himself then calls out,
' You,Smith, you know my voice; if you lay down
your arms immediately, and submit, you shall have
your lives, all but Will Atkins.'

Upon this, Will Atkins cried out, 'For God's
sake, captain, give me quarter! What have I done?
They have been all as bad as I!' which, by the way,
Was not true neither; for it seems this Will Atkins
was the first man that laid hold of the captain, when
they first mutiuied, and used him barbarously, in
tying his hands, and giving him injurious language.
However, the captain told him he must lay down his
arms at discretion, and trust to the Governor's
mercy, by which he meant me: for they all called
me governor.

In a word, they all laid down their arms, and
begged their lives; and I sent the man that had par-
leyed with them, and two more, who bound them all;
and then my great army of fifty men, which, particu-
larly with those three, were all but eight, came up,
and seized upon them all, and upon their boat, only
that I kept myself, and one more, out of sight, for
reasons of state.

Qur next work was to repair the boat, and to
think of seizing the ship; and as for the captain,
now he had leisure to parley with them, he expostu-
lated with them upon the villainy of their practices
With him, and, at length, upon the farther wicked.
Hess of their design; and how certainly it must
bring them to misery and distress in the end, and
perhaps to the gallows.

They all appeared very penitent, and begged hard
for their lives. As for that, he told them they were
none of his prisoners, but the commander's of the
island; that they thought they had set him on
shore in a barren, uninhabited island, but it had

pleased God so to direct them, that the island was "

inhabited, and that the governor was an English-
man; that he might hang them all there, if he'
pleased ; but as he had given them all quarter, he
supposed he would send them to England, to be

dealt with there as justice required, except Atkins, '

whom he was commanded by the governor to advise

to prepare for death; for that he would be hanged
in the morning.

Though this was all a fiction of his own, yet it
had its desired effect: Atkins fell upon his knees to
beg the captain to intercede with the governor for
his life; and all the rest begged of him, for God's
sake, that they might not be sent to England.

It now occurred to me that the time of our deli-
verance was come, and that it would be a most
easy thing to bring these fellows in, to be hearty in
getting possession of the ship. So I retired in the
dark from them, that they might not see what kind
of a governor they had, and called the captain to
me. When I called, as at a good distance, one of
the men was ordered to Speak again, and say to the
captain," Captain, the commander calls for you;'
and presently the captain replied, ' Tell his excel-
lency, I am just acoming.' This more perfectly
amused them; and they all believed that the com:
mander was just by, with his fifty men.

Upon the captain's coming to me, I told him my

project for seizing the ship, which he liked of we!!-

derfully well, and resolved to put it i?) execution
the next morning.

But, in order to execute it with more art, and t0
be secure of success, I told him we must divide the
prisoners, and that he should go and take Atkins,
and two more of the worst of them, and send them
pinioned to the cave where the others lay. This
was committed to Friday, and the two men who
came on shore with the captain.

They conveyed them to the cave, as to a prison;
and it was indeed a dismal place, especially to men
in their condition.

The other I ordered to my bower, as I called it,
of which I have given a full description; and as it
was fenced in, and they pinioned, the place was
secure enough, considering they were upon their
behaviour.

To these, in the morning, I sent the captain, who
was to enter into a parley with them; in a word, to
try them, and tell me whether he thought they
might be trusted or no, to go on board, and surprise
the ship. He talked to them of the injury done
him, of the condition they were brought to; and
that though the governor had given them quarter
for their lives, as to the present action, yet that if
they were sent to England, they would _all be
hanged in chains to be sure; but that if they would
join in so just an attempt, as to recover the ship,
he would have the governor's engagement for their
pardon.

Any one may guess how readily such a proposal
would he accepted by men in their condition; they
fell down on their knees to the captain, and pro-
mised, with the deepest imprecations, that they
would be faithful to him to the last drop, and that
they should owe their lives to him, and would go
with him all over the world; that they would own
him for a father to them as long as they lived.

' Well,' says the captain, ' I must go and tell the
governor what you say, and see what I can do to
bring him to consent to it. So he brought me an
account of the temper he found them in; and that
he verily believed they would be faithful.

However, that we might be very secure, I told
him he should go back again, and choose out five
of them, and tell them that they should see that
they did not want men ; bu the would take out
those five to be his assistants, and that the governor
would keep the other two, and the three that were
sent prisoners to the castle (my cave), as hostages,
for the fidelity of those five ; and that if they proved
unfaithful in the execution, the five hostages should
be hanged in chains alive upon the shore.

This looked severe, and convinced them, that the
governor was in earnest. However, they had no
way left them but to accept it; and it was now the
business of the prisoners, as much as of the captain,
to persuade the other five to do their duty.

Our strength was now thus ordered for the expe-
dition: First, the captain, his mate, and passenger.
Second, Then the two prisoners of the first gang,
to whom, having their characters from the captain,
I had given their liberty, and trusted them with
arms. ' 'hird, The other two, whom I had kept till
now in my'bower pinioned ; but, upon the captain's
motion, had now released. Fourth, these five re-
leased at last: so that they were twelve in all, be-
sides five we kept prisoners in the cave for hostages.

I asked the captain, if he was willing to venture
with these hands on board the ship; for, as for me
and my man Friday, I did not thinkit was proper
for us to stir, having seven men left behind; and it
was employment enough for us to keep them asun-
der, and supply them with victuals.

As to the five in the cave, I resolved to keep them
fast; but Friday went twice a day to them, to sup-
ply them with necessaries: and I made the other
two carry provisions to a certain distance, where
Friday was to take it.

When I showed myself to the two hostages, it
was with the captain, who told him I was the p81"
son the governor had ordered to look after them;
and that it was the governor's pleasure they should
not stir any where, but by my direction; that if theyr

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 289

did, they should be fetched into the castle, and be

'laid in irons: so that as we never suffered them to
see me as governor, so 1 now appeared as another
person, and spoke of the governor, the garrison, the
castle, and the like, upon all occasions.

The captain now had no difficulty before him,
but to furnish his two boats, stop the breach of one, .
and man them. He made his passenger captain of
one, with four other men: and himself, and his
mate, and five more, went in the other. And they
contrived their business very well; for they came
up to the ship about midnight. As soon as they
.came within call of the ship, he made Robinson
hail them, and tell them he had brought off the
men and the boat, but that it was a long time be-
fore they had found them, and the like; holding.
them in a chat, till they came to the ship's side:
when the captain and the mate, entering first with
their arms, immediately knocked down the second
mate and carpenter with the butt-end of their mus-
kelsi being very faithfully seconded by their men.
They secured all the rest that were upon the main
and quarter-decks, and began to fasten the hatches
to keep them down who were below,when the other
boat, and their men entering at the fore-chains, se-
cured the forecastle of the ship, and the skuttle
which went down into the cook-room, making three-
men they found there prisoners.

When this was done, and all safe upon the deck,-
the captain ordered the mate, with three men, to
break into -the round-house, where the new rebel
captain lay, and. having taken the alarm, was gotten
"P, and, with two men and a boy, had gotten fire-
arms in their hands; and when the mate, with 2.
"0w: split open the door, the new captain and his
men tired boldly among them, and wounded the
mate with a musket-ball, which broke his arm, and
wounded two more of the men. but killed nobody.-

The mate, calling for help, rushed, however, into.
ule-roundmouse, wounded as he was, and, with his -

. 0:
pistol, shot the new captain through the head, the
bullet entering at his mouth, and came out again
behind one of his ears 3 so that he never spoke a
word: upon Which the rest yielded, and the ship was
taken effectually, without any more lives lost.

As soon as the ship was thus secured, the captain
ordered seven guns to be tired, which was the sig-
nal agreed upon with me, to give me notice of his
success, which, you may be sure, I was very glad to
hear, having sat watching upon the shore for it, till
near two of the clock in the morning.

Having thus heard the signal plainly, I laid me
down; and it having been a day of great fatigue to
me, I slept very sound, till I was something sur-
'prised with the noise of a gun; and presently start-
ing up, I heard a man call me by the name of
' Governor, governor;' and presently I knew the
captain's voice, when climbing up to the top of the
hill, there he stood, and pointing to the ship, he
embraced me in his arms. ' My dear friend and
deliverer,' says he, ' there's your ship; for she is
all your's, and so are we, and all that belong to
her.' I cast my eyes to the ship, and there she
rode within'little more than half a mile of the
shore; for they had weighed her anchor as soon as
they were masters of her, and the weather being
fair, had brought her to an anchor just against the
mouth of a little creek; and the tide being up, the

. captain had brought the pinnace in near the place -

whereI first landed. my rafts, and so landed just
at my door. -

I was, at first, ready to sink down with the sur-
prise; for I saw my deliverance indeed visibly put
into my hands, all things easy, and a large ship just
ready to carry me away, whither I pleased to go.
At first, for some time, I was not able to answer
one word; but as he had taken me in his arms, I
held fast by him, or I should hai'e fallen to the
ground.

He perceived-the surprise, and immediately pulls
a bottle out of his pocket, and gave me a dram of
cordial, which he had brought on'purpose for me.
After I drank it, I sat down upon the ground, and '
thought it brought me to myself, yet it was a good
while before I could speak a word to him.

All this while, the poor man was'in as great an
ecstasy as I, only not under any surprise, as I was;
and he said a thousand kind, tender things to me,
to compose and bring me to myself; but such was
the flood of joy in my breast, that it put all my
spirits into confusion: at last, it broke out into tears,
and in a little while after I recovered my speech.

Then I took my turn, and embraced him as my
deliver-er; and we rejoiced together. I told him,
I looked upon him as a man sent from heaven -to
deliver me, and that the whole transaction seemed
to be a chain of wonders; that such things as these
were the testimonies we had of a secret hand of
Providence governing the world, and an evidence
that the eyes of an infinite Power could search into
the remotest corner of the world, and send help to
the miserable whenever he pleased.

I forgot not to lift up my heart in thankfulness
to Heaven; and what heart could forbear to bless
him, who had not only, in a miraculous manner,
provided for one in such a wilderness, and in such
a desolate condition, but from whom every deliver-
ance must always be acknowledged to proceed ?

When we had talked a while, the captain told me
he had brought me some little refreshment, such
as the ship afforded, and such as the wretches, who
had been so long his masters, had not plundered
him of. Upon this, he called aloud to the boat,
and bade his men bring the things ashore, that
were for the governor; and indeed it was a pre-
sent, as if I had been one, not that was to be car--
ried away along with them, but as if I had been to
dwell upon the island still, and they were to go
without me.

_ First, he had brought me a case of bottles full or

O
exeellent cordial water's, six large bottles of Na ,
.deira wine, the bottles;held two quarts a piece. .1
two pounds of excellent good tobacco, twelve good
pieces of the ship's beef, and six pgces of pork,
with a bag of pease,,and about a hundred weight of
biscuit.

He brought' me also a box of sugar, a box of
flour, a bag-full of lemons, and two bottles oflime-
juice, and abundance of- other things. But, besides" '
these, and what was a thousand times more useful
to me, he brought me six clean, new shirts, six very
good neckcloths, two pair of gloves, one pair of
shoes, a hat, and one pair of stockings, and a very
good suit of clothes of his own, which had been
worn but very little: in aword, he clothed me from
head to foot. ' . V ' .

It was a very kind and agreeable present, as any
one may imagine, to one in my circumstances; but
never was any thing in the world of that kind so
unpleasant. awkward, and uneasy as it was to'me to
wear such clothes at their first putting on.

After these ceremonies past, and after all his
good things were brought into my little apartment,
we began to consult what was to be done with the
prisoners we had; for it was worth considering,
whether we might venture to take them away with
use or no, cepecially two' of them, whom we knew
to be incorrigible and refractory to the last degree;
and the captain said he knew that they were such
rogues, that there was no obliging them ; and if he
did carry them away, it must be in irons, as male-
factors, to be delivered over to justice, at the first
English colony he could come at; and 1 found that
the captain himself was very anxious about it.

Upon this, I told him, that, if he desired. it, I.
durst undertake to bring the two men he spoke of
to make it their own. request that he should leave
them upon the island. '-I should be very glad of
that,' says the captain, ' with all my heart.'

' Well,' said I, ' 1- will- send for them, and talk

.'
with them for you.' $01 caused Friday and the
two hostages, .for they were now discharged, their
comrades having performed their promise; I say, I
caused them to go to the cave, and bring up the five
men, pinioned as they were, to the bower, and keep
' them there till I came. .
. After some time,'I came thither, dressed in my
.u new habit, aigisnow f-'ivas called governor again.
Being all met, and the captain with me, I caused
the men to be brought before me, and I told them
I had had a full account of their villainous beha.
viour to the captain, and how they had run away
with the ship, and were preparing to commit far-
ther'rebberies; but that Providence had ensnared
them in their own ways, and that they were fallen
into the pit which they had digged for others.

I let them know that, by my direction, the ship
had been seized ; that she lay now in the road ; and.
they might see by-and-by that their new captain
had received the reward of his villainy ; for that '
they might see him hanging at'the yardarm.

That as to them, I wanted to know what they had
to say, why I should not execute them as pirates,
taken in the fact, as by my commission they could
not douth had authority to do.

One of them answered in the name of the rest,
that they had nothing to say but this, that when
they were taken, the captain promised them their
lives, and they humbly implored my mercy. But I
told them I knew not what mercy to show them;
for, as for myself, I had resolved to quit the island
with all my men, and had taken passage with the
captain to go for England: and as for the captain
he could not carry them to England, other than as
prisoners in irons, to be tried for mutiny and run-
ning away with the ship; the'consequence of which,
they must needs know, would be the gallows: so
that I could not tell which was best for them, un-
less they had a mind to take their fate in the island;
If they desired that, I did not care, as I had liberty
to leave it. I had some inclination to give them
"their lives, if they thought they could shift on
shore. They seemed very thankful for it; said they
would much rather venture to stay there, than to
be carried to England to be hanged: -so I left it on
that issue.

However, the captain seemed to make some difii-
culty of it, as if he durst not leave them there.
Upon this I seemed a little angry with the captain,
and told him that they were my prisoners, not his ;
and that seeing I had offered them So much favour,
I would be as good as my word ; and that if he did
not think fit to consent to it, I would set them at
liberty as I found them; and if he did not like
that, he might take them again, if he could catch
them.

Upon this they appeared very thankful, and I
accordingly set them at liberty, and bade them re-
tire into the woods, to the place whence they came,
and 1 would leave them 'some fire-arms, some am-
munition, and some directions how they should live
'very well, if they thought fit.

Upon this 1 prepared to go on board the ship;
but told the captain that I would stay that night to
prepare my things, and desired him to go on board
in the meantime, and keep all right in the ship, and
send the boat on shore the next day for me ,- order-
ing him in the mean time to cause the new captain
who was killed, to be hanged at the yard-arm, that
these men might see him.

When the captain was gone, I sent for the men
up to me in my apartment, and entered seriously
into discourse with them '01" their circumstances. I
told them, I thought they had made a right choice;
that if the captain carried them away; they would
certainly be hanged. I showed them the new cap-
tain hanging at the yard-arm of the ship, and told
them they had nothing less to expect.

When they had all declaied their willingness to
stay, I then told them, I would let them into then '1' fl is

story of my living there, and put them into the
way of making it easy to them. Accordingly I
gave them the whole history of the place, and of
my coming to it; showed them my fortifications,
the way I made my bread, planted my corn, cured
my grapes; and, in a word, all that was necessary
to make them easy. I told them the story also of
the sixteen Spaniards that were to be expected ; for
whomI left a letter. and made them promise to
treat them in common with themselves.

I left them my fire-arms; viz. five muskets, three
fowlingpieces, and three swords. I had about a.
barrel and a half of powder left; for after the first
year or two I used but little, and wasted none. I
gave them a description of the way. I managed the
goats, and directions to milk and fatten them, to
make both butter and cheese.

In a word, I gave them every part of my own
story; and I told them I would prevail with the
captain to leave them two barrels of gunpowder
more, and some garden-seeds, which I told them I
would have been very glad of ; also I gave them
the bag of pease which the captain had broughtmc to
eat, and bade them be sure to sow and increase them.
. Having done all this, I left them the next day,
and went on board the ship. We prepared imme-
diately to sail, but did not weigh that night. The
next morning early, two of the five men came
swimming to the ship's side, and, making a most
lamentable complaint of the other three, begged to
be taken into the ship, for God's sake, for they
should be murdered; and begged the captain tO'
take them on board, though he hanged them im-
mediately. '

Upon this, the captain pretended to have no
power without me; but after some difficulty, and
after their solemn promises of amendment, they
were taken on board,' and were some time after
$0undly whipped and pickled; after which they
proved very honest and quiet fellows. ' -
Some time after this, I went with the boat on
shore. the tide being up, with the things promised :
to the men. to which the captain, at my interces- ,
sion, caused their chests and clothes to be added, "
which they took, and were very thankful for. I

, also encouraged them, by telling them that if it lay
in my way to' send any vessel to take them in, I
would not forget them. '

When I took leave of this island, I carried on
board, for relics, the great goat~skin cap I had
made, my umbrella, and one of my parrots; also I
forgot not to take the money I formerly mentioned,
which had lien by me so long useless, that it was
grown rusty, or tarnished, and could hardly pass
for silver, till it had been a little rubbed and
.handled ; and also the money I found in the wreck
of the Spanish ship.

And thus I left the island, the nineteenth of De-
cember, as I .found, by the ship's account, in the
year 1686, after I had been upon it eight-and-
twenty years, two months, and nineteen days, being
delivered from the second captivity the same day
of the month that I first' made my escape in the
barco- -longo, from among the Moors of Sallee.

In this vessel, after a long voyage, I arrived in '
England the eleventh of June, in the year 1687, hav-
ing been thirty-and- five years absent.

When I came to England, I was as perfect a stran,
ger to all the world, as I if had never been known
there. My benefactor and faithful steward, whom
I had left in' trust with my money, was alive, but
had had great misfortunes in the world, was be-
come a widow the second tinie, and very low inithe
world. I made her easy as to what she owed me.

assuring her I would give her no trouble; but, on
the contrary, in gratitude to her former care and
faithfulness to me, I relieved her as my little stock
.would afford, which at that time would indeed
allow me to do but little for her; but I assured her
I would never forget her former kindness to me:

her did I forget her, when I had suflicient to help
her, as shall be observed in its place.

I went down afterwards into Yorkshire; but my
father was dead, and my mother, and all the family
extinct, except that I found two sisters, and two of
the children of one of my brothers; and as I had
been long ago given over for dead, there had been
no provision made for me, so that, in a word, I found
nothing to relieve or assist me; and that the little
money I had', would net do much for me, as to
settling in the world. '

I met with one piece of gratitude, indeed, which"
I did not expect; and this was, that the master of
the ship, whom I had so happily delivered, and, by
the same means, saved the ship and cargo', having
given a very handsome account to the owners of
the manner how I had saved the lives of the men
and the ship, they invited me to meet them, arid
some other merchants concerned, and all together
'made me a very handsome compliment upon the
subject, and a present of almost two hundred pounds
sterling.

But, after making several reflections upon the cir-
cumstances of my life, and how little way this
would go toward settling me in the world, I re-
solved to go to Lisbon, and see if I might not come
by some information of the state of my plantation
in the Brasils, and of what was become of my part-
ner, who, I had reason to suppose, had some years
now given me over for dead. ,

With this view, I took shipping for Lisbon, where
I arrived in April following: my man Friday ac-
companying me very honestly in all these ram- '
blings, and proving a most faithful servant upon all
occasions. ' '

When I came to Lisbon, I'found out by inquiry

. and to my particular satisfaction, my old friend, the

captain of the ship, who first took me up at sea,

Off the shore of Afric. He was now grown old, and

had left off the sea, havizig put his son, who was
0 '2
far from a young man, into his ship, and who still'

used the Brasil trade. The old man did not know

me, and indeed I hardly knew him; but I soon.

brought myself to his remembrance, when I told
him who I was.

After some passionate expressions of our old ac-
quaintance, I inquired, you. may be sure, after my
plantation and my partner. The old man told me
he had not been in the Brasils for about nine years;
but that he could assure me, that when he came

away my partner was living, but the trustees whom-

] had joined with him to, take cognizance of my
part, were both dead; that, however, he believed
that I would haxe a very good account of the im-
provement of the plantation, for that, upon the ge-
neral belief of my being cast away and drowned,
my trustees had given in the account of the pro-
duce of my part of the plantation to the procurator
fiscal, who had appmpriatcd it, in case I never
came to claim it. one-third to the king, and two-
thirds to the monastery of St. Augustine, to be em
pended for the benefit of the poor, and for the
conversion of the Indians to-the Catholic faith ; but
that if I appeared, or any one for me, to claim the
inheritance, it would be restored ; only that the im-
provement, or annual production, being'distributed
to charitable uses, could not be restored: but he
assured me, that the steward of the king's revenue
(from lands). and the provedorc, or steward of the
monastery, had taken great care all along", that. the
incumbent, that is to say, my partner, gave every
year a faithful account of the produce, of which.
they received duly my moiety.

I asked him if he knew to what heightof improve-

ment he had brought the plantation ; and whether:
he thought it might be worth looking after; or.

whether, on my going thither, I should meet with
no obstruction to my possessing my just right in the
moiety.

He told me he could not tell exactly to what
degree the plantation was improved; but this he
knew. that my partner was grown exceeding rich
upon the enjoying but one half of-it: and that, to
the best of his remembrance, he had heard that the
king's third of my part, which was, it seems, granted
away to some other monastery, or religious house, _
amounted to above two hundred moidores a year;
that, as to my being restored to. a quiet possession
of it, there was no question to be made or" that, my
partner being alive to witness my title, and my
name being also enrolled in the register of the coun-
try. Also he told me, that the survivors of my two
trustees were very fair, honest people, and very
wealthy; and he. believed I would not only have -
their assistance for putting me in possession, but
would find a very considerable sum of money in
their hands, for my account, being the produce of
the farm, while their fathers held the trust, and
before it was given up, as above, which, as he re-
membered, was for about twelve years.

I showed myself a little concerned and uneasy at
this account, and inquired of the old captain how
it came to pass that the trustees should thus dis-
pose of my effects, when he knew that I had made
my will, and had made him, the Portuguese captain,
my universal heir, &c.

He told me that was true, but that as there was
no proof of my being dead, he could not act as
executor, until some certain account should come
of my death ; and that, besides,-he was not willing
to intermeddle with a thing so remote: that it was
true, he had registered my will, and put in his
claim; and could he have given any account of my
being dead or alive, he would have acted by pro-
curation, and taken possession of the ingenio (so
they called the sugar-house), and had given his son,
who was now at the Brasils, order to do it.

' But,' says the old man, ' I have one piece of
news-to tell you, which perhaps may not be so
acceptable to you as the rest; and that is, that, be.
lieving you were lost, and all the world believing
so also. your partner and trustees did offer to ac-
count to men in your name, for six or eight of the
first years of profits, which I received; but there
being at that time,' says he, ' great disbursements
far increasing the works,-bui|ding an ingenio, and
buying slaves, it did not amount to near so much as
afterwards it produced. However,' says the old
man, ' I shall give you a true account of what I
have received in all, and how I have disposed of it.'

After a few days farther conference with this an-
cient friend, he brought me an account of the first
six years' income of my plantation, signed by my
partner, and the merchant's trustees, being always
delivered 111 goods, viz. tobacco in roll, and sugar
in chests, besides rum, molasses, &c. which' 13 the
consequence of a sugar work; and I found, by this
account, that every year the income considerably
increased. But, as above, the disbursement being
large, the sum at first was small. However, the old
man let me see that he was debtor to me four hun-
dred and seventy moidores of gold, besides sixty
chests of sugar, and fifteen double rolls of tobacco,
which were lost in his ship, he having been ship-
wrecked coming home to Lisbon, about eleven years
after my leaving the place. -

The good man than began to complain of his mis-
fortunes, and how he had been obliged to make
use of my money to recover his losses, and buy
him a share in a new ship. ' However, my old
friend,' says he, ' you shall not want a supply in-
your necessity; and as soon as my son returns, you
shall be fully satisfied.'

Upon this he pulls out an old pouch, and gives
me one hundred- and-sixty Portugal moidores in
gold; and giving me the writings of his title to the
ship which his son was gone to the Brasils in, of
which he was a quarter-part owner, and his son
another, he puts them both into my hands for sec111ity
of the rest. '
I was- too much moved with the honesty and
kindness of the poor man, to be able to bear this;
and remembering what he had done for me, how he
had taken me up at sea, and how generously he
had used me on all occasions, and particularly how
sincere a friend he was now to me, I could hardly
refrain weeping at what he said to me. Therefore,
first I asked him if his circumstances admitted-him
to spare so much money at that time, and if it
would not straighten him. He told me he could
not say but it might straighten him a little: but,
however, it was my money, and I might want it
more than he.

Every thing the good man said was full of afl'ec
tion, and 1 could hardly refrain from tears while he
Spoke. In short, I took one hundred of the moi-
dores, and called for a pen and ink to give him a
receipt for them; then I returned him the rest, and

told him, if ever I had possession of the plantation, ' '

I would return the other to him also, as indeed I
afterwards did; and that, as to the bill of sale of
his part in his son's ship, I would not take it by
any means; but that, if I wanted the money, I
found he was honest enough to pay me; and if I
did not, but came to receive what he gave me rea-
son to expect, I would never have a penny more
from him.

When this was passed, the old man began to ask
me, if he should put me in a method to make my
claim to my plantation. I told him, I thought to
go over to it myself. He said, I- might do so, if I
pleased; but that if I did not, there were ways
enough to secure my right, and immediately to ap-
propriate the profits to my use: and as there were
ships in the river of Lisbon, just ready to go away
to Brasil, he made me enter my name in a public
register, with his affidavit, aflirming, upon oath, that
I was alive, and that I was the same person, who
took up the land for the planting the said plantation
at first.-
This being regularly attested by a notary, and a
procuration affixed, he directed me to send it with
a letter of his writing, to a. merchant of his ac-
quaintance at the place; and then proposed my
staying with him till an account came of the
return.

Never any thing was more honourable than the
proceedings upon this procuration ; for in less than
seven months I received a large packet from the
survivors of my trustees, the merchants for whose
account I went to sea, in which were the following
particular letters and papers enclosed:

' First, There was the account current of the pro
duce of my farm, or plantation, from the year when
their fathers had balanced with my old Portugal
captain, being for six years: the balance appeared
to be one thousand one hundred and seventy-four
moidores in my favour. '

Secondly, There was the account of four years

more, while they kept the effects in their hands,
before the government claimed the administration,
as being the effects of a person not to be found,
which they call civil death; and the balance of this,
the value of the plantation increasing, was to an
amount in crusadocs, which made three thousand
two hundred and forty-one moidores.
- Thirdiy, There was the prior of the Augustine's
account, who had received the profits for above
fourteen years; but not being able to account for
what was. diSposed to the hospital, very honestly
declared he had eight hundred and seventyotwo moi-
dores not distributed, which he acknowledged to
my account. As to the king's part, that refunded
nothing.

There was also a letter of my partner's congratu-
lating me very affectionately upon my being alive,
giving me an account how the estate was improved,
and what it produced a year, with a particular of
the number of squares.or acres that it contained:
how planted; how many slaves there were upon it;
and, making two-and-twenty crosses for blessings,
told me he had said so many ' Ave Murias,' to thank
the Blessed Virgin that I was alive; inviting me
very passionately to come over and take possession-
of my own; and,in the mean time, to give him orders
to whom he should deliver my effects, if I did not
come myself; concluding with a hearty tender of
his friendship, and that of his family ; and sent me,
as a present, seven fine leopards' skins, which he
had, it seems, received from Africa. by some other
ship, which he had sent thither, and who, it seems,
had made a better voyage than 1. He sent me also
live chests of excellent sweatmeats, and a hun-
dred pieces of gold uncoined, not quite so large as
moidores.

By the same fleet, my two merchant-trustees
shipped me twelve hundred chests of sugar, eight
hundred rolls of tobacco, and the rest of the whole
account in gold.

I might well say. now, indeed, that the latter end
Of Job was better than the beginning. It is impos-
sible to express the flutterings of my very heart,
when I looked over these letters, and especially
when I found all my wealth about me; for as the '
Brasil ships come all in fleets, the same ships which .
brought my letters brought my goods; and the
effects were safe in the Tagus before the letters came
to my hand. In a word, I turned pale, and grew
sick; and had not the old man run and fetched me
a cordial, I believe the sudden surprise of joy had
overset nature, and I had 'died upon the spot. ,

Nay, after'that, I continued very ill, and was So

some hours, till a physician being sent for, and
something of the real cause of my illness being
known, he ordered me to be let blood: after which
I had relief,'and grew well; but I verily believe, if-
it had not been eased by the vent-given in that man-
ner to the spirits, I should have died.

I was now master, all on a sudden, of above
five thousand-pounds sterling in money, and had

\
an estate, as I might well call it,' in the Brasils,
of above a thousand pounds a year, as sure as an
estate of'lands in England; and, in a word, I was
in a condition which I scarce knew how to under-
stand, or how to compose myself for the enjoy:
ment of.

The first thing I did, was to recompense my ori-
ginal benefactor, my good'old captain, who had
been first charitable to me in my distress, kind to
me in the beginning, and honest to me at the end.
I showed him all that was sent me. I told him
that, next to the providence of Heaven, which dis~
poses all things, it was owing to him; and that it
now lay on me'to reward him-which I would do a
hundredfold. So I first returned to him the huno
dred. moidores 1 had received of him ; then I sent
for a notary, and caused him to draw up a general
release, or discharge, for the four hundred and
seventy moidores, which he had acknowledged he
owed me, in the fullest and firmest manner-pos-
sible: after which, I caused a procuration to be
drawn, empowering him to be my receiver of the
annual profits of my plantation, and appointing my
partner to account to him, and make the returns by
the usual fleets to him, in my name. And a clause
in the end, being a grant of one hundred moi-
dores a year to him, during his life; out of the
effects; and fifty moidores a year to his son after
him, for his life: and thusI requited my old man.

I was now to consider which way to steer my
course next, and what to do with the estate that
Providence had thus put into my hands; and, in-
deed, I had more care upon my head now, than I
had in my silent state of life in'the island, where I
wanted nothing but what I had, and had nothing
but what I wanted; whereas I had now a great
charge upon me, and my business was how to
secure it. I had ne'er a cave now to hide my money
in, or a place where it might lie without lock or
key, till it grew mouldy and tarnished before any>> aw iafiievfi'iiii't..,r 1:1,. 4",,"

'body would meddle with it: on the contrary. I

knew not where to put it, or whom to trust with
it: my old patron the captain indeed was honest,
and that was the only refuge I had.

In the next place, my interest in the Brasils
seemed to summon me thither; but now I could
not tell how to think of going thither till I had
settled my affairs, and left my effects in some safe
hands behind me. At first, I thought of my old
friend the widow, who I knew was honest, and
would be just to me; but then she was in years,
and but poor, and, for aught I knew, might be in
debt; so that. in a word, I had no way but to go
back to Englandmyself, and take my effects with
me.

I was some months.howeve1, before I resolved
upon this; and therefore as I had rewarded the old
captain fully, and to his satisfaction, who had been
my former benefacton, so I began to think of .my
poor widow, whose husband had been my first be;
nefactor, and she, while it was in her power, my
faithful steward and instructor. So the first thing
Idid. I got a merchant in Lisbon to write to his
correspondent in London, not only to pay a bill,
but to go find her out, and carry her in money a
hundred pounds from me, and to talk with her
and comfort her in her poverty, by telling her; she
should, if I lived, have a further supply. At the
same time, I sent my two sisters in the country,
each of them, a hundred pounds, they being,
though not in want, yet not in very good circum.
stances; one. having been married, and left a
widow, and the other having a husband, not.so
kind to her as he should be.

But among all my relations or acquaintances I
could not yet pitch upon one, to whom I durst
commit the gross of my stock, that I might go away
to the Brasils, and leave things safe behind me;
and this greatly perplexed me.

I had once a mind to have gone to the Brasils,
and have settled myself there; for I was, as it
were, naturalized to the place; but I had some
little scruple in my mind about religion, which in.
sensibly drew me back, of which I shallsay more
presently. However, it was not religion that kept
me from going thither for the present; and as I
had made no scruple of being openly of the religion
of the country all the while I was among them, so
neither did I yet; only that now and then having
of late thought more of it than formerly, when I
began to think of living and dying among them, I
began to regret my having professed myself a
papist, and thought it might not be the best reli-
gion to die with.

But, as I have said, this was not the main thing
that kept me from going to the Brasils, but that

really I did not know with whom to leave my' '

effects behind me; so I resolved at last to go to
"England with them, where, if I arrived, I con-
cluded I should make some acquaintance, or find
some relations that would be faithful to me: and
accordingly I prepared to go for England with all
my wealth.

In order to prepare things for my going home, I
first (the Brasil fleet being just going away) re-
solved to give answers suitable to the just and
faithful account of things I had from thence. And
first to the prior of St. Agnstine I wrote a letter
full of thanks for his just dealings, and the offer of
the eight hundred and seventy~two moidores, which
was undisposed of, which I desired might be given:
five hundred to the monastery, and three hundred
and seventy.two to the poor, as the prior should
direct, desiring the good padre's prayersfor m9:
and the like.

I wrote next a letter of thanks to my two trus
tees, with all the acknowledgment that so much
justice and honesty called for: as for sending them
any present, they were far above having any occa-
sion for it. -m'?'1""-'r

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 307

Lastly. I wrote to my partner, acknowledging his
industry in the improving the plantation, and' his
integrity in increasing the stock of the works, giv-
ing him instructions for his future government of
my part, according to the powers I had left with
my old patron, to whom I desired him to send what.
ever became due to me, till he should hear from me
more particularly; assuring him that it was my in-
tention not only to come to him, but to settle my-
self there for the remainder of 'my life: to this I
added a very handsome present of some Italian
,silks for his wife and two daughters, for such the
captain's son informed me he had; with two pieces
of fine English broad-cloth, the best I could get in
Lisbon, five pieces of black baize, and some Flanders
lace of a good value.

Having thus settled my affairs, sold my cargo,
and turned all my effects into good bills of ex-
change, my next difficulty was, which Way to go
to England. I had been accustomed enough to the
sea, and yet I had a strange aversion to go to Eng.
land by sea at that time; and though I could give
no reason for it, yet the difficulty increased upon
me so much, that though I had once shipped my
baggage in order to go, yet I altered my mind, and
that not once, but two or three times.

It is true, I had been very unfortunate by sea, and
this might be one of the reasons: but let no man
slight the strong impulses of his own thoughts in
cases of such moment. Two of the ships which I had
singled out to go in, I mean more particularly
singled out than any other, that is to say, so as in
one of them to put my things on board, and in the

'other to have agreed with the captain; I say, two
of these ships miscarried, viz. one was taken by
the Algerines, and the other was cast away on the
Start, near Torbay, and all the people drowned ex
cept three: so that in either of those vessels I had
been made miserable, and in which most, it was
hard to say.

i
Having been thus harassed in iny thoughts, my
old pilot ,to whom I communicated every thing,
pressed me earnestly not to go by sea; but either
to go by land to the Groync, and cross over the
bay of Biscay to Rochelle, from whence it was but
an easy and safe journey by land to Paris, and so
to Calais and Dover; or to go up to Madrid, and so
all the way by land through France.

In a word, I was so prepossessed against my
going by sea at all, except from Calais to Dover,
that! resolved to travel all the way by land, which,
as I was not in haste, and did not value the charge,
was by much the pleasanten way; and to make it
more so, my old captain brought an English gentle-
man, the son of a merchant in Lisbon, who was
willing to travel with me: after which, we picked up
two more, who were English, and merchants also, and
two young Portuguese gentlemen, the last going to
Paris only; so that we were in all six of us, and
five servants: the two merchants, and the two For.
tuguese, contenting themselves with one servant
between two, to save the charge; and as for me,
1 got an English sailor to travel with me as a ser-
vant, besides my man Friday, who 'was too much a
stranger to be capable of supplying the place of a
servant upon the road.

In this manner I set out from Lisbon:.and our
company being all very well mounted and armed,
we made a little troop, whereof they did me the
honour to call me Captain, as well because ]
was the oldest man, as because I had two ser-
vants, and, indeed, was the original of the whole
journey.

As I have troubled you with none of my sea
journals, so shall I trouble you with none of my
land journal : but some adventures that happened
to us 'in this tedious and difficult journey, I must
not omit. .

' When we came to Madrid, we, being all of us
strangers to Spain, were willing to stay some time
to see the court of Spain, and to see what was
worth observing; but it being the latter part of the
summer, we hastened away, and set out from Ma-
drid about the middle of OctOber. But when we
came to the edge of Navarre, we were alarmed at
several towns on the way, with an account that so
much snow was fallen on the French side of the
mountains, that several travellers were obliged to
come back to Pampeluua, after having attempted, at
an extreme hazard, to pass on. .
When we came to Pampeluna itself, we found it
so indeed; and to me, that had been always used to
a hot climate, and indeed to countries where we '
could scarce bear any clothes on. the cold was in-
sufferable. Nor indeed was it more painful than
it was surprising, to come but ten days before out
of the Old Castile, where the weather was not
only warm, but very llOt; and immediately to feel
a wind from the Pyreuean mountains, so very
keen, so severely cold, as to be intolerable, and to
endanger beunmbing and perishing of our fingers
and toes. .

.Poor Friday was really frighted when he saw the
mountains all covered with snow, and felt cold
weather, which he had never seen or felt before iu
his life. '

'To mend the matter, after we came to Pampe-
luna, it continued snowing with so much violence,
and so long, that the peOple said winter was come
before its time, and the roads, which were difficult
before, were now quite impassable; in a word, the
snow lay in some places too thick for us to traccl;
and being not hard frozen, as is the caso in north-
ern countries; there was no, going without being
in danger of being buried alive every'step. We
staid no less than twenty days at Pampeluna, when
(seeing the winter coming on, and no likelihood of
its being better, for it was the severest winter all
over Eumpe that had been known in many years) I
proposed that we shouldall go away to Fontarabia,.
and there take shipping for Bourdeaux, which was
a very little'voyage.

But while we were considering this, there came
in four French gentlemen, who, having been stepped
on the French side of the passes as we were on
the Spanish, had found outaguide, who travers-
ing the country near the head of Languedoc, had
brought them over the mountains by such- ways,
that they were not much incommoded with the
snow; and where they met with snow in any

quantity, they said it was frozen hard enough to
hear them, and their horses.

We sent for this guide, who told us, he would
undertake to carry us the same way, with no
hazard from the snow provided we were armed
sufficiently to protect us from wild beasts; for he'
said, upon these great snows, it was frequent for
some wolves to show themselves at the foot of the
mountains, being made ravenous for want of food,
the ground being covered with snow. We told him
we were well enough prepared for such creatures
as they were, if he would ensure us from a kind
-of two-legged wolves, which we were told we were in
most danger from, especially on the French side of
the mountains.

I-Ie satisfied us there was no danger of that kind
in the way that we were to go. So we readily
agreed to follow him; as did also twelve other
gentlemen, with their servants, some French, some
Spanish, who, as I said, had attempted to go, and
were obliged to come back again.

Accordingly we'all set out from Pampeluna, with
our guide, on the fifteenth of November; and in-
deed, I was surprised, when, instead of going for-
ward, he came directly back with us, on the same
road that we came from Madrid, above twenty
miles; when having passed two rivers, and come
into the plain country, we found ourselves in a
warm climate again, where the country was pleao
sent, and no snow to be seen; but on a sudden,a. Mn. "~--

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 311

turning to the left, he approached the mountains
another way; and though it is true, the hills and
the precipices looked dreadful, yet he made so
many tours, such meanders, and led us by such
winding ways, we were insensibly passed the height
of the mountains without being much encumbered
with the snow; and, all on a sudden, he showed _
us the pleasant fruitful provinces of Languedoc
and Gascoigne, all green and flourishing; though
indeed they were at a great distance, and we had
some rough way to pass yet.

We were a little uneasy, however, when we found
it snowed one whole day, and at night so fast that
we could not travel; but he bade us be easy, we
should soon be past it all. We found, indeed, that
we began to descend every day, and to come more '
north than before; and so, depending upon our
guide, we went on. '

It was about two hours before night, when our.
guide being something before us, and not just in
sight, out rushed three monstrous wolves, and after
them a bear, out of a hollow way, adjoining to a
thick wood. Two of the wolves flew upon the
guide, and had he been half a mile before us he
had been devoured indeed, before we could have
he'Ped him. One of them fastened upon his horse,
and the other attacked the man- with that violence,
that he had not time, or not presence of mind
"mush to draw his pistol, but hallooed and cried
out to us most lustily. My man Friday being next
'0 me, I bade him ride up, and see what was the
matter. As soon as Friday came in sight of the
man, he hallooed as loud as the Other, ' 0 master!
0 master!' but, like a bold follow, rode directly
"P to the man, and, with a pistol, shot the wolf
that attacked him into the head.

It was happy for the poor man that it was my .
Man Friday; for he, having been used- to that kind
01' creature in his country, had no fear upon him,
bUt went close up to him, and shot him as above:
whereas any of us would have fired at a farther .
distance, and have, perhaps, either missed the wolf,
or endangered shooting the man. '

But it was enough to have terrified a bolder man
than I; and indeed it alarmed all our company,
when, with the noise of Friday's pistol, we heard
on both sides the dismalest howling of wolves, and
the noise r'edoubled by the echo of the mountains,
that it was to us as if there had been a prodigious
multitude of them; and perhaps indeed there were
not such a few, as that we had no cause of appreo
hensions. -

However, as Friday had killed this wolf, the
other, that had fastened upon the horse, left him
immediately, and fled, having happily fastened upon
his head, where the bosses of the bridle had stuck-
in his teeth, so that he had not "done him much
hurt. The man, indeed, was most hurt: for the
raging creature had bit him twice, once on the arm>>
and the other time a little above his knee; and
he was just, as it were, tumbling down by the dis-
order of his horse, when Friday came up, and shot
the wolf. '

It is easy to suppose, that at the noise of Friday's
pistol we all mended our pace, and rid up, as fast aS-
the way (which was very difficult) would give us
leave, to see what was the matter. Assoon as we
came clear of the trees, which blinded us before,
we saw plainly what had been the case, and how
Friday had disengaged the poor guide; though we
did not presently discern what kind of creature it
was he had killed. - -

But never was a fight managed so hardily, and in
such a surprising manner, as that which followed

-between Friday and the bear, which gave us all
(though at first we were surprised and afraid for
him) the greatest diversion imaginable. As the
bear is a heavy, clumsy creature, and does not gal-
lop as the wolf does, which is swift and light; so
he has two particular qualities, which generally are-' the rule of his actions. First, as to men, who are
not his proper pray. I say, not his proper prey, be-
cause, though I cannot say what egtcessive hunger
might do, which was now their case, the ground
being all covered with snow; yet, as to men, he
does not usually attempt them, unless they first
attack him: on the contrary, if you meet him in
the woods, though if you do not meddle with him,
he will not meddle 'with you; yet then you must
take care to be very civil to him, and give him the
road; for he is a very nice gentleman, he will not
go a step out of his way for a prince; nay, if you
are really afraid, your best way is to look another
way, and keep going on ; for sometimes if you stop
_ and stand still, and look stedl'astly at him, he takes
_' it for an affront; but if you throw or toss any
thing at him, and it hits him, though it were but
a bit of stick as big as your linger, he takes it for
an affront, and sets all other business aside to pur-
sue his revenge; for he will have satisfaction in
. point of honour: and this is his first quality. The
' next is, that if he be once aifronted, he will never
' . leave you, night or day, till he has his revenge,-
, but follow, at a good round rate, till he overtakes
i' you.
' My man Friday had delivered our guide, and
when we came up to him, he was helping him off
from his horse; for the man was both hurt and
frighted, and indeed the last more than the first;
when, on a sudden, we spied the bear come out of
the wood, and a vast monstrous one it was, the
biggest by far that ever I saw. We were all a little
surprised when we saw him; but when Friday saw
hun, it was easy to see joy and courage in the fel-
low's countenance. ' O! O! 0 !' says Friday, three
times, pointing to him; ' 0 master! you give me
te leave, me shakee'te hand with him, me malice
3011 good laugh.'
I was surprised to see the fellow so pleased.
' You fool you,' said I, 'he will eat you up l' ' Eatee
P
me up; Eatee me up?' says Friday, twice over
again. ' Me eatee him up: me make you good
laugh. You all stay here: me show you good
laugh.' So down he sits, and gets his boots off in
a moment, and put on a pair of pumps (as we call
the flat shoes they wear), and which he had in his
pocket, gives my other servant his horse, and with
his gun, away he flew, swift like the wind.

The hear was walking softly on, and offered to
meddle with nobody, till Friday, coming pretty
near) calls to him, as if the bear could understand
him, ' Hark ye, hark ye,' says Friday, ' me speakec
wit you.' We followed at a. distance; for now
being come down to the Gascoigue side of the
mountains, we were entered a vast great forest,
where the country was plain, and pretty open,
though many trees in it scattered here and there.

Friday, who had, as we say, the heels of the
bear, came up with him quickly, and takes up a
great stone, and throws it at him, and hit him just
on the head; but did him no more harm, than if
he had thrown it against a wall: but it answered
Friday's end; for the rogue was so void of fear,
that he did it purely to make the bear follow him,
and ' show us some laugh,' as he called it.

As soon as the bear felt the stone, and saw him,
he turns about, and comes after him, taking devil<<
ish long strides, and shuffling along atastrangc
rate, so as would put a horse to a middling gallop:
Away runs Friday, and takes his course, as if he
ran towards us for help; so we all resolved to fire
at once upon the bear, and deliver my man;
though I was angry at him heartily for bringing
the hear back upon us, when he was going about
his own business another way; and especially!
was angry that he had turned the bear upon us,
and then run away ; and 1 called out, ' You dog}
said 'I, ' is this your making us laugh? Come
away, and take your horse, that we may shoot the
creature.' He hears me, and cries out, ' No shoot;
no shoot! Stand still: you get much laugh.' And
as the nimble creature ran two feet for the beast's
one, he turned, on a sudden, on one side of us, and
seeing a great oak tree, fit for his purpose, he
beckoned us to follow, and doubling his pace, he.
gets nimbly up the tree, laying his gun down upon
the ground, at about five or six yards from the
bottom of the tree.

The bear soon came to the tree, and we followed
ata distance. The first thing he did, he stopped
at the gun, smelt to it, but let it lie, and up he
scrambles into the tree, climbing like a cat, though
so monstrously heavy. I was amazed at the folly
as I thought it, of my man, and could not for my
life see any thing to laugh at yet, till, seeing the
bear get up the tree, we all rode nearer to him.

When we came to the tree, there was Friday got
out to the small end of a large limb of the tree,and
the bear got about half way to him: as soon as the
bear got out to that part where the limb of the tree
was weaker, ' I'Ia,' says he, to us, ' now you see me
teaches the bear dance :' so he fails a jumping, and
shaking the bough, at which the bear began to tot-
tcr, but stood still, and began to look behind him,
to see how he should get back ; then indeed we did
laugh heartily. But Friday had not done with him
bya great deal: when he sees him stand still, he
calls out to him again, as if he had supposed the
bear could speak English, ' What, you no come far-
ther? Pray you come farther.' So he left jumping
and shaking the bough: and the bear, just as if he
had understood what he said, did come a little far-
ther: then he fell a jumping again, and the bear
StOpped again.-

We thought now was a good time to knock him
on the head, and I called to Friday to stand still
and we would shoot the bear; but he cried out
earnestly, ' 0 pray! O pray! no shoot! Me shoot
by and then.' He would have said, ' By and by.'
However, to shorten the story, Friday danced so
much, and the bear stood so ticklish, that we had
laughing enough indeed, but still could not imagine
what the fellow would do; for first we thought he
depended upon shaking the bear all", and we found
the hear was too cunning for that too; for he would
not go out far enough to be thrown down, but
clings fast with his great, broad claws and feet, so
that we could not imagine what would be the end of
it, and where the jest would be at last.

But Friday put us out of doubt quickly; for see-
ing the bear cling fast to the bough, and that he
would not be persuaded to come any farther, ' Well,
well,' said Friday, ' you no come farther, me go, me
go; you no come to me, me come to you.' And
upon this, he goes out to the smallest end of the
bough, where it should bend with his weight, and
gently lets himself down by it, sliding down the
bough, till he came near enough tojump down on
his feet, and away he ran to his gun, takes it up,
and stands still.

' Well,' said I to him, ' Friday, what will you do
now? Why don't you shoot him?' ' No shoot.'
says Friday, ' no yet, me shoot now, me no kill:
me stay, give you one more laugh.' And indeed so
he did, as you will see presently; for when the bear
saw his enemy gone, he comes back from the bough
where he stood; but did it mighty leisurely, looking
behind him every step, and coming backward till he
got into the body of'the tree. Then with the same
hinder end foremost, he came down the tree, grasp-
ing it with his claws, and moving one foot at a
time, very leisurely: at this juncture, and just be-
fore he could 'set his hind feet: upon the ground;
Friday stepped close to him, clapped the muzzle of
his piece into his ear, and shot him dead as 8
stone.

Then the rogue turned about, to see if we did
not laugh; and when he saw we were pleased by
our looks, hefalls a laughing himself very loud-
' So we kill bear in my country,' says Friday. ' SO
you kill them!' said I; ' why you have no guns.'
' No,' says he: ' no gun; but shoot great, much,
long arrow.'

This was, indeed, a good diversion to us ; but we
were still in a wild place, and our guide very much
hurt, and what to do we hardly knew: the howling
of wolves ran much in my head; and indeed, ex-
cept the noise I once heard on the shore of Africa,
of which I have said something already, I never
heard any thing that filled me with so much
horror.

These things, and the approach of night, called
us off, or else, as Friday would have had us, we
should certainly have taken the skin of this mon-
strous creature oil", which was worth saving; but

' we had three leagues to go, and our guide hast-

ened us; so we left him, and went forward on our
journey. ,

The ground was still covered with snow, though
not so deep and dangerous as on the mountains;
and the ravenous creatures, as we heard after.
wards, were come down into the forest and plain
country, pressed by hunger, to seek for food; and
had done a great deal of mischief in the villages,
where they surprised the country people, killed a
great many of their sheep and horses, and some
People too.

We had one dangerous place to pass, of which
fmr guide told us, if there were any more wolves
in the country, we should find them there; and
this was a small plain, surrounded with woods on
every side, and a long, narrow defile or lane, which
We were to pass, to get through the wood, and then
we should come to the village where we were to
lodge.

1! was within half an hour of sunosct, when we
entered the first wood ;' and a little after sun-set,
when we came into the plain. We met with nothing
"1 the first wood, except that, in a little plain,
Within the wood, which was not above two furlongs
over, we saw five great wolves cross the road, full
speed, one after another, as if they had been in
chase of some prey, and had it in view. They
took no notice of us, and were gone, and out of our
sight in a few moments.

Upon this, our guide, who, by the way, was a
wretched faint-hearted fellow, bade us keep in a
ready posture; for he believed there were more
Wolves a coming.

We kept our arms ready, and our eyes about us;
but we saw no more wolves till we came through
that wood, which was near half a league, and en-
tered the plain. As soon as we cameinto the plain,
we had occasion enough to look about us. The first
object we met with, was a dead horse; that is to
say, a poor horse, which the wolves had killed.
and at least a dozen of them at work; we could
not say, eating of him, but picking of his bones
rather; for they had eaten up all the flesh before.

We did not think fit to disturb them at their
feast, neither did they take much notice of us-
Friday would have let fly at them, but I would not
suffer him by any means; for 1 found we were like
tohave more business upon our hands than we were
aware of. We were not gone half over the plain,
but we began to hear "the wolves howl, in the wood
on our left, in a frightful manner; and, presently
after, we saw about a hundred coming on directly
towards us, all in a body, and most of them in a
line, as regularly as an army drawn up by ex-
perienced officers. I scarce knew in what manner
to receive them; but found to draw ourselves in 8
close line, was the only way. So we formed in a
moment. But that we might not have too much
interval, I ordered that only every other man should
fire, and that the others, who had not fired, should
stand ready to give them a second volley immc'
diately,if they continued to advance upon us; and
that then those who had fired at first should not
pretend to load their fusils again, but stand ready
with every one a pistol; for we were all armed
with a fusil, and a pair of pistols, each man: so we
were, by this method, able to fire six volleys, half
of us at a time. However, at present, we had no
necessity; for, upbn firing the first volley, the
enemy made a full stop, being terrified as well with
the noise as with the fire: four of them being shot
into the head, dropped ; several others were wound-
ed, and went bleeding off, as we could see by the
snow. I found they stopped, but did not imme-
diately retreat ; whereupon remembering that I had
been told, that the fiercest creatures were terrified
at the voice of a man, I caused all our company
to halloo as loud as we could: and I found the
notion not altogether mistaken; for, upon our
Shout, they began to retire, and turn about; then
I ordered a second volley to be fired in their rear,

which put them to the gallop, and away they went
to the woods.

This gave us leisure to charge our pieces again,
and that we might lose no time, we kept doing; but
we had but little more than loaded our fusils, and
put ourselves into a readiness, when we heard a
terrible noise in the same wood on our left; only
that it was farther onward, the same way we were
to go.

The night was coming on, and the light began to
be dusky, which made it the worse on our side;
but the noise increasing, we could easily perceive
that it was the howling and yelling of those hellish
creatures; and, on asudden, we perceived two or
three troops of wolves, one on our left, one behind
us, and one on our front: so that we seemed to be
surrounded with them. However, as they did not
full upon us, we kept our way forward, as fast as we
could make our horses go, which, the way being
Very rough, was only a good,large trot; and in this
manner we only came in view of the entrance of
the wood, through which we were to pass, at the

l'arther'side of the plain; but we were greatly sur-
prised, when, coming near the lane, or pass, we
saw a confused number of wolves standing just at
the entrance.

On a sudden. at another opening of the wood, we
heard the noise of a gun; and, looking that way,
out rushed a horse, with a saddle and a bridle on
him, flying like the wind, and sixteen or seventeen
wolves after him, full speed. Indeed, the horse
had the heels of them; but, as we supposed that
he could not hold it at that rate, we doubted not
but they would get up with him at last; and no
question but they did.

Here we had a most horrible sight,- for, riding
up to the entrance where the horse came out, we
found the carcase of another horse, and of two
men devoured by the ravenous creatures, and one
of the men was no doubt the same whom weheard
fire the gun; for there lay a gun just by him fired
off; but, as to the man, his head; and the upper
part of his body, were eaten up.

This filled us with horror, and we knew not what
course to take; but the creatures resolved us soon,
for they gathered about us presently, in hopes of
prey; and l verily believe there were three huno
dred of them. It happened very much to our ad-
vantage, that at the entrance into the wood, but a
little way from it, there lay some large timber trees,
which had been cut down the summer before, and
I suppose lay there for carriage. I drew my little
troop in among these trees, and placing ourselves
in a line, behind one long tree, I advised them all
to alight, and, keeping that tree beforens, for a
breastwork, to stand in a triangle or three fronts,
enclosing our horses in the centre.

We did so; and it was well we did, for never
was a more furious charge than the creaturesmade
upon us in this place: they came on us with a
growling kind of noise, and mounted the piece of
timber (which, as I said, was bur breastwork), as if
they were only rushing upon their prey ,- and this
fury of theirs, it seems, was principally occasioned
by their seeing our horses behind us, which was
the prey they aimed at. I ordered our men to fire
as before, every other man; and they took their
aim so sure, that indeed they killed several 01' the
wolves at the first volley; but there was a neces-
sity to keep a continual firing, for they came on
like devils, those behind pushing on those before.

When we had fired our second volley of our fa.
sils, we thought they stopped a little, and I heped
they would have gone off, but it was but a moment,
for others came forward again; so we fired two
volleys of our pistols, and I believe, in these four
firings, we killed seventeen or eighteen of them,
and lamed twice as many: yet they came on
again.

lwas loath to spend our last shot too hastily; so
Icalled my servant, not my man Friday, for he was-
better employed; for, with the greatest dexterity
imaginable, he charged my fusil, and his own,
while we were engaged; but, as I said, I called my
other man; and giving him a horn of powder, I
bade him lay a train, all along the piece of timber,
zmd let it be a large train. He did so, and had
but just time to get away, when the wolves came
up to it, and some were got up upon it, when I,
snapping an uncharged pistol close to the powder,
set it on fire. Those that were upon the timber
were scorched with it, and six or seven of them
fell, or rather jumped in among us, with the force
and fright of the fire. We dispatched these in an.
'instaut, and the rest were so frighted with the
light, which the night, for now it was very near
dark, made more terrible, that they drew back a
little.

Upon which, I ordered our last pistols to be
fired off in one volley, and after that we gave a
shout: upon this, the wolves turned tail, and we
sallied immediately upon near twenty lame ones,
which we found struggling on the ground, and fell

P 2
a cutting them with our swords, which answered
our expectation; for the crying and howling they
made were better understood by their fellows, so
that they all tied, and left us. '

We had, first and last, killed about threescore of
them; and had it been day-light, we had killed
many more. The field of battle being thus cleared,
we made forward again; or we had still near a
league to go.- We heard the ravenous creatures
howl and yell in the woods as we went, several
times; and sometimes we fancied we saw some of
them, but tbs snow dazzling our eyes, we were not
certain: so in about an hour more, we came to the
town, where we were to lodge, which we found in
a terrible fright, and all in arms; for it Seems, that.
the night before, the wolves and some bears had
broken into the village, and put them in a terrible
fright; and they were obliged to keep guard, night
and day, but especially in the night, to preserve
their cattle, and indeed their people.

The next morning our guide was so ill, and his
limbs so swelled with the rankling of his two
wounds, that he could go no farther; so we were
obliged to take a new guide there, and go to Tho-
louse, where we found a warm climate, a fruitful,
pleasant country, and no snow, no wolves, or any
thing like them. But when we told our story at
Tholouse, they told us it was nothing but what was
ordinary in the great forest, at the foot of the
mountains, especially when the snow lay on the
ground. But they inquired muchwhat kind of a
guide we had gotten, that would venture to bring
us that way in such a severe season; and told us,
it was very much we were not all devoured. When
we told them how we placed ourselves, and the
horses in the middle, they blamed us exceedingly:
and told us it was fifty to one but we had been
all destroyed; for it was the sight of the horses
that made the wolves so furious, seeing their prey;
and that at other times they are really afraid of
a gun 3 but they being excessive hungry, and raging
on that account, the eagerness to come at the
horses had made them senseless of danger; and
that if we had not by the continued-'fire, and at
last by the stratagem of the train of powder, mas-
tered them, it had been great odds but that we had
been torn to pieces; whereas had we been content
to have sat still on horseback, and fired as horse
men, they would not have taken the horses so
much for their own, when men were on their backs,
as otherwise; and, withal, they told us, that, at
last, if we had stood all together, and left our horses,
they would have been so eager to have devoured
them, that we might have come 06' safe, especially
having our fire-arms in our hands, and being so
many in number.

For my part, I was never so sensible of danger
in my life; for seeing above three hundred devils
come roaring and openomouthed to devour us, and
having nothing to shelter us, or retreat to, I gave
myself over for lost; and, as it was, I believe, I
shall never care to cross those mountains again: I
think I would much rather go a thousand leagues
by sea, though I were sure to meet with a storm
Once a week.

Ihave nothing uncommon to take notice of in
my passage through France; nothing but what
other travellers have given an account of, with
much more advantage than I can. I travelled from
Tholouse to Paris, and, without any considerable
stay, came to Calais, and landed safe at Dover, the
fourteenth of January, after having had a severe
cold season to travel in. .

I was now come to the centre of my travels, and
had, in a little time, all my newdiscovered estate
safe about me; the bills of exchange which I brought
with me having been very currently paid.

My principal guide and privy'couusellor, was my
good, ancient widow, who, in gratitude for the
money I had sent her, thought no pains too much,
or care too great, to employ for me; and I trusted
her so entirely with every thing, that I was per-
fectly easy as to the security of my effects: and
indeed I was very happy from my beginning, and
now to the end, in the unspotted integrity of this
.good gentlewoman.

And now I began to think of leaving my effects
with this woman, and setting out for Lisbon, and so
to the Brasils, But now another scruple came in
my way, and that was religion; for as I had enter-
tained some doubts about the Roman religion, even
while I was abroad, especially in my state of soli-
tude; so I knew there was no going to the Brasils
for me, much less going to settle there, unless I
resolved to embrace the Roman catholic religion,
without any reserve; except, on the other hand,
I resolved to be a sacrifice to my principles, be a
martyr for religion, and die in the Inquisition: so I
resolved to stay at home, and. ifI could find means
for it, to dispose of my plantation.

To this purpose I wrote to my old friend at Lis.
bon, who, in return, gave me notice, that he could
easily dispose of it there; but that, if I thought
fit to give him leave to offer it in my name to the
two merchants, the survivors of my trustees, who
lived in the Brasils, who must fully understand the
value of it, who lived just upon the spot, and whom
I knew to be very rich, so that he believed they
would be fond of buying it; he did not doubt, butI
should make four or five thousand pieces of eight
the more of it.

Accordingly I agreed, gave him orders to offer it
to them, and he did so; and in about eight months
a more, the ship being then returned, he sent me an
account, that they had accepted the offer, and had
remitted thirty-three thousand pieces of eight to a
correspondent of theirs at Lisbon, to pay for it.

In return, I signed the instrument'of sale in the
form which they sent from Lisbon, and sent it to
my old man, who sent me bills of exchange for
thirty-two thousand eight hundred pieces of eight,
for the estate, reserving the payment of one hun-
dred moidores a year to him, the old man, during
his life, and fifty moidores afterward to his son for
his life, which I had promised them ;.and which the
' plantation was to make good as a rent charge. .

And thus I have given the first part of a life of,
fortune and adventure, a life of Providence's check-
er-work, And of a variety which the world will sel-
dom be able to show the like of. Beginning fool-
ishly, but closing much more happily than any part
of it ever gave me leave so much as to hope for.

Any one would think, that, in this state of com-
plicated good fortune, I was past running any more
hazards; and so indeed I had been, if other cir-
cumstances had concurred: but I was inured to a
wandering life, had no family, nor many relations,
nor, however rich, had I contracted much acquaint-
ance; and though I had sold my estate in the
Brasils, yet I could not keep that country out of
my head, and had a great mind to be upon the
wing again; especially I could not resist the strong
inclination I had to see my island, and to know if
the poor Spaniards were in being there, and how
the rogues I left there had used them.

My true friend, the widow, earnestly dissuaded
me from it, and so far prevailed with me, that for
almost seven. years she prevented my running
abroad :_during which time I took my two nephews,
the children of one of my brothers, into my care.
The eldest having something of his own, I bred up
as a gentleman, and gave him a settlement of some
addition to his estate after my decease: the other I
put out to a captain of a ship; and after live years,
finding him a sensible, bold, enterprising young fel-
low, I put him into a good ship, and sent him to
sea. And this young fellow afterwards drew me
in, as old as I was, to farther adventures myself.

In the mean time. I in part settled myself here;
{Or first of all I married, and that not either to my
disadvantage or dissatisfaction; and had three
children, two sons and one daughter. But my
wife dying, and my nephew coming home, with
good success, from a voyage to Spain, my inclina-
tion to go abroad, and his importunity, prevailed,
and engaged me to go in his ship as a private trader
to the East Indies. This was in the year 1694.

In this voyage, l visited my new colony in the
island, saw my successors, the Spaniards; had the
whole story of their lives, and of the villains I left
there; how at first they insulted the poor Spaniards;
how they afterwards agreed, disagreed, united, see
parated, and how at last the Spaniards were obliged
to use violence with them; how they were subject-
ed to the Spaniards; how honestly the Spaniards
used them; a history, if it were entered into, as
full of variety and wonderful accidents, as my own
part: particularly also as to their battles with the
Caribbeans, who landed several times upon the
island, and as tothe improvement they made upon
the island itself: and how five of them made an
attempt upon the main land, and brought away
eleven men and five women prisoners, by which, at
my coming, I found about twenty young children
on the island.

. Here I staid about twenty days, left them supplies
of all necessary things, and particularly of arms,
powder, shot, clothes, tools, and two workmen,
which I brought from England with me: viz. a
carpenter and a smith.

. Besides this, I shared the island into parts with
them, reserved to myself the property of the whole,
but gave them such parts respectively as they agreed
on; and having settled all things with them, and
engaged them not to leave the place, I left them
there. '

From thence I touched at the Brasils, from
whence I sent a bark, which I bought there, with
more people, to the island ; and in it, besides other
supplies, I sent seven women, being such as I
found proper for service, or for wives to such as
would take them. As to the Englishmen, I pro-
mised them to send them some women from. Eng-
land, with a good cargo of necessaries, if they
would apply themselves to planting. which I after-
wards could not perform. The fellows proved
very honest and diligent, after they were mastered,
and had their properties set apart for them. I sent
them also from the Brasils five cows, three of them
being big with calf, some sheep, and some hogs,
which, when I came again, were considerably in-
creased.

But all these things, with an account how three
hundred Caribbees came and invaded them, and
ruined their plantations, and how they fought with
that whole number twice, and were at first defeat.
ed and one of them killed; but at last a storm de-
stroying their enemies' canoes, they famished or
destroyed almost all the rest, and renewed and re-
covered the possession of their plantation, and still
lived upon the island:

All these things, with some very surprising inci-
dents, in some new adventures of my own, for ten
years more, I may, perhaps, give a farther account
of hereafter.Killian]. .. .Bl.In|quhi--JI~.II\"IIIS III ' I uTHE

OF

ROBINSON CRUSOE.
__...o..._._

HAT homely proverb, used on so many occa-
sions in England, viz. that ' What is bred in
the bone will not go out of the flesh,' was never
more verified than in the story ot'imy life. Any one
would think, that after thirty-five years' affliction,
and a variety of unhappy circmnstances, which few
men, if any, ever went through before, and after
near seven years of peace and enjoyment in the.
fuluess of all things; grown old, and when, if
9"". it might be allowed me to have had experi-
ence of every state of middle life, and to know
which was most adapted to make a man completely
1"WW; I say, after all this. any one would have
thought that the native propensity to rambling,
which I gave an account of, in my first setting out
Into the world, to have been so predominant in my
thoughts, should be worn out, the volatile part be
hilly evacuated, or at least condensed, and I might
at sixty-one years of age have been a little inclined
to stay at home, and have done venturing life and
fOttnne any more. v
Nay, farther, the common motive of foreign ad-

ventures was taken away in me; for I had no for-
tune to make, I had nothing to seek. If I had
gained ten thousand pounds, I had been no richer;
for I had already sufficient for me, and for those. I
had to leave it to: and that I had was visibly in-
creasing; for having no great family, I could not
spend the income of what I had, unless I would
set up for an expensive way of living, such as a
great family, servants, equipage, gaiety, and the
like, which were things I had no notion of, nor in-
clination to; so that I had nothing indeed to do,
but to sit still, and fully enjOy what I had got, and
see it increase daily upon my hands.

" Yet all these things had no effect upon me, or at
least not enough to resist the strong inclination I
had to go abroad again, which hung about me like
a chronical distemper: particularly the. desire of
seeing my new plantation in the island, and the
colony 1 left there, run in my head continually. I
dreamed of it all night, and my imagination ran
upon it all day; it was uppermost in all my
thoughts, and my fancy worked so steadily and
strongly upon it, that I talked of it in my sleep.
In short, nothing could remove it out of my mind:
it even broke so violently into all my discourses,
that it made my conversation tiresome, for I could
talk of nothing else; all my discourse ran into it>>
even to impertincnce ; and I saw it myself.

1 have often heard persons of good judgemt'llt
say, that all the stir people make in the world about
ghosts and apparitions, is owing to the strength of
imagination, and the powerful operation of fancy
in their minds: that there is no such thing as a
spirit appearing, or a ghost walking, and the like:
that people's poring affectionately upon the past
conversation of their deceased friends, so realizes
it to them, that they are capable of fancying, upon
some extraordinary circumstances, that they see
them, talk to them, and are answered by them.
when in truth, there is nothing but shadow and

vapour in the thing, and they really know nothing
of the matter.
For my part, I know not to this hour, whether
there are any such things as real apparitions, spec-
tres, or walking of pe0ple after they are/ dead; or
whether there is any thing in the stories they tell
us of that kind, more than the product of va-
pours, sick minds, and wandering fancies; but this
I know, that my imagination worked up to such a
height, and brought me into such excess of vapours,
or what else I may call it, that I actually supposed
myself oftentimes upon the spot, at my old castle
behind the trees; saw my old Spaniard, Friday's
' father, and the reprobate sailors, whom I left upon
the island; nay, I fancied I talked with them, and
looked at them so steadily, though I was broad
awake, as at persons just before me; and this I
did, till I often frightcd myself with the images my
fancy represented to me. One time in my sleep I
had the villainy of the three pirate sailors so lively
related to me, by the first Spaniard, and Friday's
father, that it was surprising: they told me how
they barbarously attempted to murder all the Spa-
niards, and that they set fire to the provisions they
had laid up, on purpose to distress and starve
them: things that I had never heard of, and that in-
deed were never all of them true in fact. And it was
so warm in my imagination, and so realized to me,
that. to the hour I saw them, I could not be per-
suaded, but that it was, or would be true; also how
I resented it, when the Spaniards complained to
me ; and how I brought them to justice, tried them
before me, and ordered them all three to be hanged.
What there was really in this, shall be seen in its
place; for, however I came to form such things in
{"b' dream. and what secret converse of spirits in-
JcCted it, yet there was, I say, very much of it
true. I own, that this dream had nothing in it
llterally and specifically true; but the general part
"'85 so true, the base and villainous behaviour of
these three hardened rogues was such, and had
been so much worse than all I can describe, that
the dream had too much similitude of the fact;
and as I would afterwards have punished them se-
verely, so if I had hanged them all, I had been
much in the right. and should have been justified
both by the laws of God and man.

But to return to my story: in this kind of tem-
per 1 had lived some years. I had no enjoyment
of my life, no pleasant hours, no agreeable diver-
sion, but what had something or other of this in it;
so that my wife, who saw my mind so wholly bent
upon it, told me very seriously one night, that she
believed there was some secret, powerful impulse
of Providence upon me, which had determined me
to go thither again; anp that she found nothing
hindered my going, but my being engaged to a
wife and children. She told me, that it was true,
she could not think of parting with me; but as she
was assured, that if she was dead, it would be the
first thing I would do; so, as it seemed to her, that
the thing was determined above, she would not be
the only obstruction. For ifI thought fit, and re-
solved to go......l'lere she found me very intent
upon her words, and that I looked very earnestly
at 'her; so that it a little disordered her, and she
stopped. I asked her why she did not go on, and
say out what she was going to say. But I per-
ceived her heart was too full, and some tears stood
in her eyes. ' Speak out, my dear,' said I. ' Are
you willing I should go?' ' No,' says she, very
affectionately: ' I am far from willing. But if you
are resolved to go,' says she, ' and rather than I
,will be. the only hindrance, I will go with you:
for though I think it a preposterous thing for one
of your years, and in your condition, yet if it
must be,' said she again, weeping, ' I won't leave
you; for if it be of Heaven, you must do it. there
is no resisting it; and if Heaven makes it your
duty to go, He will also make it mine to go with
you, or otherwise dispose of me, that I may not

obstruct. it.'
This affectionate behaviour of my wife brought
me a little out of the vapours, and I began to con-
sider what I was a doing. I corrected my wander-
ing fancy, and began to argue with myself sedately,
_ what business I had, after threescore years, and
after such a life of tedious sufferings and disasters,
and closed in so happy and easy a manner; I say,
what business had I to rush into new hazards, and
put myself upon adventures, fit only for youth and
poverty to run into ?

With those thoughts, I considered my new en-
gagements, that I had a wife, one child born, and
my wife then great with child of another; that I
had all the world could give me, and had no need
to seek hazards for gain; that I was declining in
years, and ought to think rather of leaving what I
had gained, than of seeking to increase it; that as
to what my wife had said, of its being an impulse
from Heaven, and that it should be my duty to go,
I had no notion of that; so after many of these
cogitations, I struggled with the power of my ima-
gination, reasoned myself out of it, as I believe
people may always do in like cases, if they will;
and, in a word, I conquered it; composed myself
with such arguments as occurred to my thoughts,
and which my present condition furnished me plen-
tifnlly with; and, particularly, as the most effectual
method, I resolved to divert myself with other
things, and to engage in some business that might
effectually tie me up from any more excursions of
this kind; for I found the thing returned upon
me, chiefly when I was idle, had nothing to do, nor
any thing of moment immediately before me. .

To this purpose, I bought a little farm in the
county of Bedford, and resolved to remove myself
thither. I had a little convenient house upon it,
and the land about it 1 found was capable of great
Improvement, and that it was many ways suited to
my inclination, which delighted in cultivating, mn-
naging, planting, and improving of land ; and par-
ticularly, being an inland country, I was removed
from conversing among ships, sailors, and things
relating to the remote parts of the world.

In a word, I went down to my farm, settled my
family, bought me ploughs, harrows, a cart, waggon,
horses, cows, sheep; and, setting seriously to work,
became, in one half-year, a mere country gentle-
man. My thoughts were entirely taken up in ma-
naging my servants, cultivating the ground, enclos-
ing, planting, &c.; and I lived, as I thought, the
most agreeable life that nature was capable of di-
recting, or that a man always bred to misfortunes
was capable of being retreated to.

I farmed upon my own land; I had no rent to
pay; was limited by no articles. I could pull up,
or cut down, as I pleased. What I planted was for
myself; and what I improved was for my family;
and having thus left ofir the thoughts of wandering.
I had not the least discomfort in any part of my
life, as to this world. Now I thought indeed, that
I enjoyed that middle state of life, which my father
so earnestly recommended to me; and lived a. kind
ofheavenly life, something like what is described
by the poet upon the subject of a country life:

Free from vices, free from care;
Age has no pain, and youth no snare.

But in the middle of all this felicity, one blow
from unseen Providence unhinged me at once : and
not only made a breach upon me inevitable and
incurable, but drove me, by its consequence, into
a. deep relapse of the wandering disposition, which
as I may say, being born in my very blood,
soon recovered its hold of me, and, like the returns
of a violent distemper, came on with an irresistible
force upon me, so that nothing could make any
more impression upon me. This blow was the loss
of my wife.

It is not my business here to write an elegy upOn
my wife, to give a character of her particular vir-
tues, and make my court to the sex by the flattery
of a funeral sermon. She was, in a few words, the
Stay of all my affairs, the centre of all my enter-
prises; the engine, that by her prudence reduced
me to that happy compass I was in, from the most
extravagant and ruinous project that fluttered in
my head, as above; 'and did more to guide my
rambling genius, than a mother's tears, a father's
instructions, a friend's counsel, or all my own rea-
soning powers, could do. I was happy in listening
to her entreaties, and in being moved by her tears, _
and to the last degree desolate and dislocated in
the world by the loss of her.

When she was gone, the world looked awkwardly
round me: I was as much a stranger in it, in my
thoughts, as I was in the Brasils, when I first went
on shore there; and as much alone, except as to
the assistance of servants, as I was in my island.
I knew neither what to do, or what not to do. I
saw the world busy round me, one part labouring
for bread, and the other squandering it in vile
excesses, or empty pleasures; equally miserable,
because the end they proposed still fled from them;
for the men of pleasure every day surfeited of their
vice, and heaped up work for sorrow and repent-
ance: and the men of labour spent their strength
in daily strugglings for bread, to maintain the vital
strength they laboured with; so living in a daily
circulation of sorrow, living but to work, and
working but to live, as if daily bread were the only
end of a wearisome life, and a wearisome life the
only occasion of daily bread.

This put me in mind of the life I lived in my
kingdom, the island; where l suffered no more
com to grow, because I did not want it; and bred
no more goats, because I had no more use for them :
where the money lay in the drawer till it grew
mouldy, and had scarce the favour to be looked

"Pon in twenty years. .
All these things, had I improved them as I ought
to have done, and as reason and religion had dic-
tated to me, would have taught me to search fur-
ther than human enjoyments for a full felicity, and
that there was something which certainly was the
reason and end of life, superior to all those things.
which was either to he possessed, or at least hoped
for, on this side the grave.

But my sage counsellor was gone: I was like a
ship without a pilot, that could only run ' afore the
wind.' My thoughts ran all away again, into the
old affair: my head was quite turned with the
whimsies of foreign adventures; and all the pleas-
ing, innocent amusements of my farm, and my
garden, my cattle and my family, which before en-
tirely possessed me, were nothing to me: had no
relish, and were like music to one that has no can
or food to one that has no taste. In a word,l
resolved to leave off housekeeping, let'my farm.
and return to London; and in a few months after
I did so.

When I came to London, I was still as uneasy as
before: I had no relish to the place, no employment
in it, nothing-to do but to saunter about, like an
idle person, of whom it may be said, He is per-
fectly useless in God's creation, and it is not one
farthing matter to the rest of his kind whether he
be dead or alive. This also Was the thing, which.
of all circumstances of life, was the most my aversion,
who had been all my days used to an active life;
and I would often say to myself, ' A state of idle-
ness is the very dregs of life:' and, indeed, I
thought I was much more suitably employed, when
I was twenty-six days a making me a deal board.

It was now the beginning of the year 1693, when
my nephew, whom, as I have observed before, I had
brought up to the sea, and had made him com-
mander of a. ship, was come home from a short
voyage to Bilboa, being the first he had made. He
came to me, and told me, that some merchants of
his acquaintance had been proposing to him to go
a voyage for them to the East Indies and to China,
as private traders. ' And now, uncle,' says he, ' if
you will go to sea with me, I'll engage to land
you upon your old habitation in the island; for we
are to touch at the Brasils.'

Nothing can be a greater demonstration of a
future state, and of the existence of an invisible
world, than the concurrence of second causes with
the ideas of things which we form in our minds
perfectly reserved, and not communicated to any in
the world.

My nephew knew nothing how far my distemper
of wandering was returned upon me, and I knew
nothing of what he had in his thoughts to say,
"when that very morning before he came to me, I
had, in a great deal of confusion of thought, and
revolving every part of my circumstances in my
mind, come to this resolution; viz. that I would go
to Lisbon, and consult with my old sea captain,
and so, if it was rational and practicable, I would
go and see the island again, and see what was be-
come of my peOple there. I had pleased myself
also with the thoughts of peopling the place, and
carrying inhabitants from hence, getting a patent
for the possession, and 1 know not what; when, in
the middle of all this, in comes my nephew, as I
have said, with his project of carrying me thither,
in his way to the East Indies.

I paused a while at his words,and looking steadily
at him, ' What devil,' said I, ' sent you of this un.
lucky errand?' My nephew startled, as if he had
been frighted at first; but perceiving I was not
much displeased with the proposal, he recovered
himself. ' I hape it may not be an unlucky pro-
posal, sir,' says he: ' I dare say, you would be
Phased to see your new colony there, where you
once reigned with more felicity than most of your
brother monarchs in the world.'

111 a word, the scheme hit so exactly with my.
Q,
temper, that is to say, with the prepossession I was
under, and of which I have said so much, that I
told him, in few words, If he agreed with the mer-
chants, I would go with him. ButI told him,I
would not promise to go any farther than my own
island. ' Why, sir,' says he, ' you don't want to be
left there again, I hope?' 'Why,' said I, ' can you
not take me up again in your return?' He told me,
it would not be possible to do so; that the mer-
chants would never allow him to come that way
with a loaded ship of such value, it being a month's
sail out of his way, and might be three or four.
' Besides, sir, if I should miscarry,' said he, ' and
not return at all, then you would be just reduced to
the condition you were in before.'

This was very rational; but we both found outa
remedy for it; which was to carry a framed sloop on
board the ship, which being taken in pieces, and
shipped on board the ship, might by the help of
some carpenters, whom we agreed to carry with us.
be set up again in the island, and finished, fit to g0
to sea in a few days.

I was not long resolving; for indeed the impor
tunitics of my nephew joined in so effectually with
my inclination, that nothing could oppose me. On
the other hand, my wife being dead, I had nobody
that concerned themselves so much for me as to
persuade me one way or other, except my ancient
good friend the widow, who earnestly struggled
with me to consider my years, my easy circum-
stances, and the needless hazards of a long voyage;
and, above all, my young children. But it was all
to no purpose; I had an irresistible desire to the
voyage: and I told her, I thought there was some'
thing so uncommon in the impressions I had upon
my mind for the voyage, that it would be a kind of
resisting Providence, if I should attempt to stay at
home. After which, she ceased her expostulation5.
and joined with me, not only in making provision
for my voyage, but also in settling my family affairs>-;; ;. .<<WHFH. .4; _A . :.

in my absence, and providing for the education of
my children.

In order to this, I made my will, and settled the
estate I had in such a manner for my children, and
placed it in such hands, that I was perfectly easy,
and satisfied they would have justice done them,
whatever might befall'me ; and for their education,
I left it wholly to my widow, with a sufficient
maintenance to herself for her care. All which,
she richly deserved: for no mother could have
taken more care in their education, or underStood
it better: and as she lived till I came home, I also
lived to thank her for it.

My nephew was ready to sail about the beginning
of January, 1694-5, and I, with my man Friday,
went on board, in the Downs, the 8th, having, be-
sides that 5100p which I mentioned above, a very
considerable cargo of all kinds of necessary things
for my colony, which, if I did not find in good con-
dition, I resolved to leave so.

First, I carried with me some servants, whom I -
Purposed to place there as inhabitants, or, at least,
to set on work there upon my own account while I
Staid; and either to leave them there, or carry
them forward, as they should appear willing: par-
ticularly, I carried two carpenters, a smith, and a
very handy, ingenious fellow, who was a cooper by
trade, but was also a general mechanic; for he was
dexterous at making wheels, and hand-mills to grind
corn; was a good turner, and a good pot-maker.
He also made any thing that was proper to make
of earth, or wood: in a word, we called him our
' Jack of all trades.'

IWith these I carried a tailor, who had offered
himself to go passenger to the East Indies, with
my nephew, but afterwards consented to stay on
our new plantation, and proved a most necessary,
handy fellow, as could be desired, in many other
businesses, besides that of his trade; for, as I observ-
Ed formerly, necessity arms us for all employments.
My cargo, as near as I can collect, for I have not
kept an account of particulars, consisted of a suf-
ficient quantity of linen, and some thin English
stuffs for clothing the Spaniards that I expected to
find there; and enough of them as, by my calcu-
lation, might comfortably supply them for seven
years. If I remember right, the materials which I
carried for clothing them, with gloves, hats, shoes,
stockings, and all such things as they could want
for \ wearing, amounted to above two hundred
pounds, including some beds, bedding, and house-
hold stufi": particularly kitchen utensils, with pots,
kettles, pewter, brass, &c. besides near one hun-
dred pounds more in iron-work, nails, tools of every
kind, staples, hooks, hinges, and every necessary
thing I could think of.

I carried also a hundred spare arms, muskets,
and fusils, besides some pistols, a considerable quan-
tity of shot of all sizes, three or four tons of lead,
and two pieces of brass cannon; and, becauseI
knew not what: time, and what extremities, I was
providing for, I carried a hundred barrels of pow-
der, besides swords and cutlasses, and the iron
part of some pikes and halberts; so that, in short,
we had a large magazine of all sorts of stores; and
I made my nephew carry two small quarter-deck
guns more than'he wanted for his ship, to leave
behind, if there was occasion; that, when we came
there, we might build a fort, and man it against
all sorts of enemies. And, indeed, I at first thought
there would he need enough for it all, and much
more, if we hoped to maintain our possession of
the island, as shall be seen in the course of the
story.

I had not such bad luck in this voyage, 881
had been used to meet with; and therefore shall
have the less occasion to interrupt the reader, who
perhaps may be impatient to hear how matters
went with my colony; yet some odd accidents,
cross winds, and bad weather, happened, on this
.first setting out, which made the voyage longer
than I expected it at first; and I, who had never
made but one voyage, viz. my first voyage to
Guinea, in which I might be said to come back
again as the voyage was at: first designed, began
to think the same ill fate still attended me; and
that I was born never to be contented with being
on shore, and yet to be always unfortunate at
sea.

Contrary winds first put us to the northward,
and we were obliged to put in at Galway in Ire-
land, where we lay wind bound two-and-twenty days;
but we had this satisfaction with the disaster, that
provisions were here exceeding cheap, and in the
utmost plenty: so that while we lay here, we never
touched the ship's stores, but rather added to them.
Here also I took in several live hogs, and two cows
with their calves, which I resolved, if I had a good
passage, to put ashore in my island; but we found
occasion to dispose otherwise of them.

. We set out the fifth of February from Ireland,
and had a very fair gale of wind for some days.
As I remember, it might be about the twentieth of
February, in the evening late, when the mate,
having the watch, came into the round-house, and
told us, he saw a flash of fire and heard a gun
fired; and while he was telling us of it, a boy
came in, and told us the boatswain heard an-
other. This made us all run out upon the quarter-
deck, where, for a while, we heard nothing; but in
a few minutes we saw a very greatlight, and found
that there was some very terrible fire at a distance.
Immediately we had recourse to our reckonings, in
which we all agreed, that there could be no land
that way, in which the fire showed itself, no, not
for five hundred leagues; for it appeared at W. N .
W- Upon this, we concluded it must be some ship
on fire at sea; and as, by our hearing. the noise of
guns just before, we concluded it could not be far
Off, we stood directly towards it, and were presently
satisfied we should discover it, because the farther
we sailed, the greater the light appeared; though
the weather being hazy, we could not perceive any
thing but the light for a while. In about half an
hour's sailing, the wind being fair for us, though
not much of it, and the weather clearing up a
little, we could plainly discern, that it was a great
ship on fire in the middle of the sea. I was most
sensibly touched with this disaster, though not at
all acquainted with the persons engaged in it. I
presently recollected my former circumstances, and
what condition I was in, when taken up by the Por-
tugal captain; and how much more deplorable the
circumstances of the poor creatures belonging to this
ship must be, if they had no other ship in company
with them. Upon this, I immediately ordered that
five guns should be fired, one soon after another,
that, if possible, we might give notice to them, that
there was help for them at hand, and that they
might endeavour to save themselves in their boat:
for though we could see the flame of the ship, yet
they, it being night, could see nothing of us.

We lay by some time upon this, only driving as
the burning ship drove, waiting for daylight, when,
on a sudden, to our great terror, though we had
reason to expect it, the ship blew up in the air, and
immediately, that is to say, in a few minutes, all
the fire was out, that is to say, the rest of the ship
sunk. This was a terrible, and, indeed, an afflicting
sight, for the sake of the poor men, who, I con-
cluded, must be either all destroyed in the ship, or
. be in the utmost distress in their boats, in the mid- .
die of the ocean, which, at present, by reason it
was dark, I could not see. However, to direct
them as well as I could, I caused lights to be hung
out in all parts of the ship where we could, and
which we had lanterns for, and kept tiring guns 8"
the night long; letting them know by this, that
there was a ship not far off. '

_ About eight o'clock in the morning, we disco-
vered the ship's boats, by the help of our perspec-
tive-glasses; and found there were two of them,
both thronged with people, and deep in the water.
We perceived they rowed, the wind being against
them; that they saw our ship, and did their utmost
to make us see them.

We immediately spread our ancient, to let them
know we saw them; and hung a waft out as a sig-
nal for them to come on board 3 and then made
more sail, standing directly to them. In a little
more than half an hour we came up with them,
and, in a word, took them all in, being no less than
sixty-four, men, women, and children; for there
were a great many passengers.

Upon the whole, we found it was a French mer-
chant ship, of three hundred tons, homeward
bound from Quebec, in the river of Canada. The
master gave us a long account of the distress of
his ship, how the fire began in the steerage, by the
negligence 'of the steersman; but, on his crying out
for help, was, as every body thought, entirely put
out. But they soon found that some Sparks of the
first fire had gotten into some part of the ship so
difficult to come at, that they could not efl'ectually
'iuench it; and afterwards getting in between the
timbers, and within the ceiling of the ship, it pro.
ceedetl into the hold, and mastered all the skill, and
all-the application, they were able to exert.

They had no more to do then, but to get into
their boats, which, to their great comfort, were
pretty large; being their long-boat, and a great shal-
IOP. besides a small skill", which was of no great
service to them, other than to get some fresh wa-
ter and provisions into her, after they had secured
themselves from the fire. They had indeed small
hope of their lives by getting into these boats at
that distance from any land; only, as they said
well, that they were escaped from the fire, and had
a possibility that some ship might happen to be at
sea, and might take them in. They had sails, oars,
and a compass: and were preparing to make the
best of their way to Newfoundland, the wind blow--
ing pretty fair; for it blew an easy gale at 8.15.
by E. They had as much provisions and water, as,
with sparing it, so as to be next door to starving,
might support them about twelve days; in which,
if they had no bad weather, and no contrary
winds, the captain said, he heped he might get to
the banks of Newfoundland, and might, perhaps, take
some fish to sustain them, till they might go on
shore. But there were so many chances against
them, in all these cases; such as storms to overset
and founder them, rains and cold to benumb and
perish their limbs, contrary winds to keep them out
and starve them, that it must have been next to
miraculous if they had escaped.

In the midst of their consultations, every one
being hopeless, and ready to despair, the captain,
with tears in his eyes, told me, they were, on a
sudden, surprised with the joy of hearing a gun
fire, and, after that, four more: these were the five
guns which I caused to be fired at first seeing the
light. This revived their hearts, and gave them the
notice, which, as above, I designed it should, viz.
that there was a ship at hand for their help;

It was upon hearing these guns, that they took
down their masts and sails; and the sound coming
from the windward, they resolved to lie by till morn.
ing. Some time after this, hearing no more guns,
they fired three muskets, one a considerable while
after another; but these, the wind being contrary,
we never heard.

Some time after that again, they were still more
agreeably surprised with seeing our lights, and
hearing the guns, which, as I have said, I caused
to be tired all the rest of the night: this set them
to work with their cars, to keep their boats ahead.
at least, that we might the sooner come up with
them; and at last, to their inexpressible joy, the!)l
found we saw them.
It is impossible for me to express the several
gestures, the strange ecstasies, the variety of pos-
tures, which these poor delivered people run into,
to express the joy of their souls at so unexpected a
deliverance. Grief and fear are easily described;
sighs, tears, groans, and a very few motions of
head and hands, make up the sum of its variety;
but an excess of joy, a surprise of joy, has a thou-
sand extravagancies in it. There were some in tears;
some raging and tearing themselves, as if they had
been in the greatest agonies of sorrow; some stark
raving, and downright lunatic; some ran about the
ship,stamping with their feet, others wringing their
hands; some were dancing; some singing; some
laughing; more crying; many quite dumb, not
able to speak a word; others sick and vomit-
ing; several swooning, and ready to faint; and
a few were crossing themselves, and giving God
thanks.

I would not wrong them neither; there might be
ma"! that were' thankful afterward: but the pas-
sion was too strong for them at first, and they
were not able to master it; they were thrown into
ecstasies, and a kind of frenzy, and so there were
but a very few who were composed and serious in
their joy. '

Perhaps also the case may have some addition to
it: from the particular circumstance of the nation
they belonged to; I mean the French, whose tem-
per is allowed to be more volatile, more passionate,
and more sprightly, and their Spirits more fluid,
than in other nations. I am not philosopher
enough to determine the cause, but nothing I had
ever seen before came up to it. The ecstasies poor
Friday, my trusty savage, was in, when he found
his father in the boat, came the nearest to it; and
the surprise of the master, and his two compa-
mons, whom I delivered from the villains that set
them on shore in the island, come a little way
towards it: but nothing was to compare to this,

Q 2
346 ROBINSON CRUSOE.

either that I saw in Friday, or any where else in
my life.

It is farther observable, that these extravagancies
did not show themselves in that different manner
I have mentioned, in different persons only; but all
the variety would appear, in a short succession of
moments, in one and the same person. A man that
we saw this minute dumb, and, as it were, stupid
and confounded, should the next minute be danc-
ing and hallooing, like an antic; and the next
moment be tearing his hair, or-pulling his clothes
to pieces, and stamping them under his feet, like
a madman; a few minutes after that, we should
have him all in tears,'thcn sick, then swooning;
and, had not immediate help been had, would, in a
few moments more, have been dead: and thus it
was, not with one or two, or ten, or twenty, but
with the greatest part of them: and, if I remember
right, our surgeon was obliged to let above thirty
of them blood.

There were two priests among them, one an old
man, and the other a young man ; and that which
was strangest was, that the oldest man was the
worst.

As soon as he set his foot on board our ship, and
saw himself safe, he drOpped down stone dead, to
all appearance: not the least sign of life could be
perceived in him. Our surgeon immediately apa
plied proper remedies to recover him, and was the
only man in the ship that believed he was not
dead; and at length he opened a vein in his arm,
having first chafed and rubbed the part, so as to
warm it as much as possible. Upon this, the
blood, which only drOpped at first, flowed some-
thing freely: in three minutes after, the man
opened his eyes; and about a quarter of an hour
after that he spoke, grew better, and, in a little
time, quite well. After the blood was stopped, he
walked about, told us he was perfectly well, took a
drain of cordial which the surgeon gave him, and
was what we called ' come to himself.' About a quar-
ter of an hour after, they came running into the cabin
to the surgeon, who was bleeding a French woman
that had fainted; and told him the priest was gone
stark mad. It seems he had begun to revolve the
change of his circumstances in his mind, and-this
put him into an ecstacy of joy: his spirits whirled
about faster than the vessels could convey them;
the blood grew hot and feverish; and the man was
as fit for Bedlam as any creature that ever was in
it. The surgeon would not bleed him again in that
condition, but gave him something to doze and
put him to sleep, which, after some time, operated

upon him, and he waked next morning perfectly
composed and well.

The younger priest behaved himself with great
command of his passion, and was really an exam-
ple of a serious, well-governed mind. At his first
coming on board the ship. he threw himself flat on
ins face, prostrating himself in thankfulness for his
deliverance; in which I unhappily and unseason-
ably disturbed him, really thinking he had been in
a swoon: but he Spake calmly, thanked me, told
me he was giving God thanks for his deliverance,
begged me to leave him a few moments, and that,
nlext to his Maker, he would give me thanks
a so.

I was heartily sorry that I disturbed him 5 and
not only left him, but kept others from interrupt-
mg him also. He continued in that posture about
three minutes, or a little more, after I left him;
then came to me, as he had said he would, and,
with a great deal of seriousness and affection, but
with tears in'his eyes, thanked me, that had, under
God, given him, and so many miserable creatures, -
their lives. I told him, I had no room to move liim
to thank God for it, rather than me; for I had
seen that he had done that already. But I added,
that it was nothing but what reason and humanity
dictated to all men, and that we had as much tea.

I
son as he to give thanks to God, who had blessed-
us so far as to make us the instruments of his
mercy to so many of his creatures.

After this, the young priest applied himself to
his country folks, laboured to compose them, per-
suaded, entreated, argued, reasoned with them,
and did his utmost to keep them within the exer-
cise of their reason; and with some he had suco
cess, though others were, for a time, out of all
government of themselves. -

I cannot help committing this to writing, as per-
haps it may be useful to those into whose hands it
may fall,for the guiding themselves in allthe extra-
vagancies of their passions; for if an excess of joy
can carry men out to such a length beyond the
reach of their reason, what will not the extrava-
gancies of anger, rage, and a provoked mind, carry
us to? And, indeed, here I saw reason for keeping
an exceeding watch over our passions of every
kind, as well those of joy and satisfaction, as those
of sorrow and anger.

We were something disordered by these extra-
vagancies among our new guests for the first day;
but when they had been retired, lodgings provided
for them as well as our ship would allow, and they
had slept heartily, as most of them did, being fa.
tigued and frighted, they were quite another sort
of people the next day.

Nothing of good manners, or civil acknowledge-
ments for the kindness shown them, was wanting:
the French, it is known, are naturally apt enough
to exceed that way. The captain and one of the
priests came to me the next day, and, desiring to
speak with me and my nephew, the commander,
began to consult with us what should be done
with them. And first they told us, that as we had
saved their lives, so all they had was little enough
for a return to us for the kindness received. The
captain said, they had saved some money, and
some things ofvalue,in their boats, catched hastily
out of the flames; and if we would accept it, they
were ordered to make an offer of it all to us: they
only desired to be set on shore somewhere in our
way, where, if possible, they might get passage to
France.

My nephew was for accepting their money at first
word, and to consider what to do with them after-
wards: but I over-ruled him in that part; for I
knew what it was to be set on shore in a strange
country; and if the Portugal captain, that took me
up at sea, had served me so, and took all I had for
my deliverance, I must have starved, or have been
as much a slave at the Brasils, as I had been in
Barbary, the being sold to a Mahometan only ex-
cepted; and, perhaps, a Portuguese is not a much
better master than a Turk, if not, in some cases, a
much worse.

I, therefore, told the French captain, that we had
taken them up in their distress, it was true; but:
that it was our duty to do so, as we were fellow-
creaturcs, and as we would desire to be so deli-
vered, if we were in the like, or any other extre-
mity; that we had done nothing for them, but
what we believed they would have done for us, if
we had been in their case, and they in ours ; but
that we took them up to save them, not to plun-
der them; and that it would be a most barbarous
thing to take that little from them which they had
saved out of the fire, and then set them on shore,
and leave them; that this would be first to save
them from death, and then to kill them ourselves;
save them from drowning, and abandon them to
starving: and, therefore, I would not let the least
thing be taken from them. As to setting them on
shore, I told them, indeed, that was an exceeding
difficulty to us, for that the ship was bound to the
East Indies; and though we were driven out of
our course to the westWard a very great way, which,
Perhaps, was directed by Heaven, on purpose for
their deliverance, yet it was impossible for us wil-
fully to change our voyage, on this particular ac-
count; nor could my nephew, the captain, answer
it to the freighters, with whom he was under char-
terparty to pursue his voyage by the way of Brasil:
and all I knew we could do for them was to put
ourselves in the way or" meeting with other ships,
homeward bound, from the. West-Indies, and get
them passage, if possible, to England or France.

The first part of the proposal was so generous
and kind, they could not but be very thankful for
it; but they were in a great consternation, cape-
cially the passengers, at the notion of being car-
ried away to the East Indies. They then entrcat--
ed me, that seeing I was driven so far to the west-
ward, before I met with them, I would at least
keep on the same course to the banks of New-
foundland, where it was probable I might meet
with some ship or sloop, that they might hire to
carry them back to Canada, from whence they
came.

I thought this was but a reasonable request on
their part; and, therefore, I inclined to agree to
it: for, indeed, I considered, that, to carry this
whole company to the East Indies, would not only
be an intolerable severity to the poor peOple, but
would be ruining our whole voyage, by devouring
all our provisions; so that I thought it no breach
of charterparty, but what an unforeseen accident
made absolutely necessary to us ; and in which no
one could say we were to blame; for the laws of
God and nature would have forbid, that we should
refuse to take up two boats full of people in such
a distressed condition; and the nature of the
thing, as well respecting ourselves as the poor
people, obliged us to set them on shore, somewhere
or other, for their deliverance. So I consented
that we would carry them to Newfoundland, if
wind and weather would permit; and, if not, that

I would carry them to Martinico in the West
Indies. '
' The wind continued fresh easterly, but the wea-
ther pretty good; and as it had blowed continually
in the points between N. E. and S. E. a long time,
we missed several Opportunities of sending them
to France; for we met several ships bound to Eu-
rope, whereof two were French, from St. Christo-
pher's; but they had been so long beating up
against the wind, that they durst take in no passen-
gcrs, for fear of wanting provisions for the voyage,
as well for themselves as for those they should take
in: so we were obliged to go on. It was about a
week after this, that we made the banks of New-
foundland, where, to shorten my story, we put all
our French people on board a bark, which they
hired at see there, to put them on shore, and after-
wards to carry them to France, if they could get
provisions to victual themselves with. When, I say,
all the French went on shore, I should remember,
that the young priest I spoke of, hearing we
were bound to the East Indies, desired to go the
voyage with us, and to be set on shore on the
coast of Coromandel. l readily agreed to that; for
l wonderfully liked the man, and had very good
mason, as will appear afterwards. Also, four of the
seamen entered themselves in our ship, and proved
very useful fellows.

From hence we directed our course for the West
Indies, steering away S. and S. by E. for about
twenty days together, sometimes little or no wind
at all; when we met with another subject for our
humanity to work upon, almost as deplorable as
that before.

It was in the latitude of 27 degrees. 5 minutes N.
and the nineteenth day of March, 1694-55, when we
Spied a sail, our course S. E. and by S. We soon
perceived it was a large vessel, and that she bore
uP t0 us ; but could not at first know what to make
05 her, till, after coming a little nearer, we found
she had lost her main top-mast, fore-mast, and
boltsprit; and presently she fired a gun as a signal
of distress. The weather was pretty good; wind
at N. N. W. a fresh gale, and we soon came to
speak with her.

We found her a ship of Bristol, bound home from
Barbadoes, but had been blown out of the road at
Barbadoes, a few days before she was ready to sail,
by a terrible hurricane, while the captain and chief
mate were both gone on shore; so that, besides the
terror of the storm, they were but in an indifferent
case for good artists to bring the ship home. They
had been already nine weeks at sea, and had met
with another terrible storm, after the hurricane was
over, which had blown them quite out of their
knowledge to the. westward, and in which they lost
their masts, as above. They told us, they expected
to have seen the Bahama Islands, but were then
driven away again to the south-east,lby a strong
gale of wind at N. N. W. the same that blew now;
and having no sails to work the ship with, but a
main-course, and a kind of square sail, upon a
jury foremast, which they had set up, they could
not lie near the wind, but were endeavouring to
stand away for the Canaries.

But that which was worst of all, was, that they
were almost starved for want of provisions, besides
the fatigues they had undergone: their bread and
flesh was quite gone, they had not an ounce left
in the ship, and had had none for eleven days;
the only relief they had, was, their water was not
all spent, and they had about half a barrel of flour
left; they had sugar enough: some succades, or
sweetmeats, they had at first, but they were dec
voured ; and they had seven casks of rum.

There was a youth and his mother, and a maid
servant, on board, who were going passengers, and:
thinking the ship was ready to sail, unhappily came
on board the evening before the hurricane began;
and having no provisions of their own left, the)l
were in a more deplorable condition than the rest;
for the seamen, being reduced to such an extreme
necessity themselves, had no compassion, we may
be sure, for the poor passengers: and they were,
indeed, in a condition that their misery is very
hard to describe.

I had, perhaps, not known this part, if my curi-
osity had not led me, the weather being fair, and
the wind abated, to go on board the ship. The
second mate, who, upon this occasion, commanded
the ship, had been on board our ship; and he told
me, indeed, that they had three passengers in the

, great cabin, that they were in a deplorable condi-

tion. ' Nay,' says he, ' I believe they are dead, for
I have heard nothing of them for above two days;
and I was afraid to inquire after them,' said he,
' for I had nothing to relieve them with.' .

We immediately applied ourselves to give them
what relief we-'could spare; and, indeed, I had so
far over-ruled things with my nephew, that I would
have victualled them, though we had gene away to
Virginia, or any part of the coast of America, to
have supplied ourselves: but there was no neces-
sity for that. t .

But now they were in a new danger; for they
were afraid of eating too much, even of that little
we gave them. The mate, or commander, brought
six men with him in his boat; but these poor
Wretches looked like skeletons, and were so weak,
they could hardly sit to their oars. The mate him-
self was very ill, and half-starved ; for he declared
he had reserved nothing from the men, and went
share and share alike with them, in every hit they
eat.

I cautioned him to eat sparingly, but set meat
before him immediately; and he had not eaten
three mouthfuls before he began to be sick, and
Out of order. So he stepped a-while,,and our sur-
geon mixed him up something with some broth,
which he said would be to him both food and phy-
Slcs and, after he had taken it, he grew better. In
the mean time, I forgot not the men. I ordered-.. <<,. .-...

354 ROBINSON CRUSOE.

victuals to be given them, and the poor creatures
rather devoured than eat it: they were so exceed-
ing hungry, that they were in a kind ravenous, and
had no command of themselves: and two of them
eat with so much greediness, that they were in
danger of their lives the next morning.

The sight of these people's distress was very
moving to me, and brought to mind what I had a
terrible prospect of, at my first coming on shore in
my island, where I had not the least mouthful of
food, or any prospect of procuring it; besides the
hourly apprehension I had of being made the food
of other creatures. But all the while the mate was
thus relating to me the miserable condition of the
ship's company, I could not put out of my thought
the story he had told me of the three poor creatures
in the great cabin; viz. the mother, her son, and the
maid-servant, whom he had heard nothing of for
two or three days, and whom he seemed to confess
they had wholly neglected, their own extremities
being so great: by which I understood, that they
had really given them no food at all, and that
therefore they must be perished, and be all lying
dead, perhaps, on the floor or deck of the cabin.

As I, therefore, kept the mate, whom we then
called captain, on board with his men to refresh
them, so I also forgot not the starving crew that
were left on board, but ordered my own boat to g0
on board the ship, and, with my mate and twelve
men, to carry them a sack of bread, and four or five
pieces of beef to boil. Our surgeon charged the
men to cause the meat to be boiled while they
Staid, and to.' keep guard- in the cook-room, to pre-
vent the men's taking it to eat raw, or taking it out
of the pot before it was well boiled, and then to
give every man but a little at a time; and, by
this caution he preserved the men, who would
otherwise have killed themselves with that ver)'

food that was given them on purpose to save their
lives.
At the same time, I ordered the mate to go into
the great cabin, and see what condition the poor
passengers were in, and, if they were alive, to com-
fort them, and give them what refreshment was
proper; and the surgeon gave him a large pitcher,
with some of the prepared broth which he had
given the mate that was on board, and which he did
not question would restore them gradually.

I was not satisfied with this; but, as I said above,
having a great mind to see the scene of misery,
,which I knew the ship itself would present me
with, in a more lively manner than I could have
it by report, I took the captain of the ship, as we
now called him, with me, and went myself a little
after in their boat.

I found the poor men on board almost in a tu-
mult to get the victuals out of the boiler before it
was ready. But my mate observed his order, and
kept a good guard at the cook~room door; and
the man he placed there, after using all possible
persuasion to have patience, kept them off by force.
However, he caused some biscuit cakes to be dip-
ped in the pot, and softened with the liquor of
the meat, which they call Brewis, and gave them
every one one, to stay their stomachs, and told
them it was for their own safety that he was
obliged to give them but little at a time. But it
was all in vain, and had I not come on board, and
their own commander and officers with me, and
with good words, and some threats also of giving
lllcm no more, I believe they would have broke
Into the cook-room by force, and tore the meat out
Of the furnace; for words, indeed, are of very
small force to a hungry belly. However, we paci--
fied them, and fed them gradually and cautiously
for the first time, and the next time gave them
more, and at last filled their bellies, and the men
did Well enough.

13:ut the misery of the poor passengers in the
cabin was of another nature, and far beyond the
rest. For as, first, the ship's company had so little
for themselves, it was but too true, that they had
at first kept them very low, and at last totally
neglected them; so that for six or seven days, it
might be said, they had really had no food at all,
and, for several days before, very little. The poor
mother, who, as the mate reported, was a woman
of good sense, and good breeding, had Spared all
she could get so affectionately for her son, that at
last she entirely sunk under it. And when the
mate of our ship went in, she sat upon the floor, or
deck, with her back up against the sides, between
two chairs, which were lashed fast, and her head
sunk in between her shoulders, like a corpse,
though not quite dead. My mate said all he could
to revive and encourage her, and with a spoon put
some broth into her mouth. She opened her lips,
and lifted up one hand, but could not speak; yet
she understood what he said, and made signs to
him, intiinating that it was too late for her; but
pointed to her child, as if she would have said, they
should take care of him.

However, the mate, who was exceedingly moved
with the sight, endeavoured to get some of the
broth into her mouth ; and, as he said, got two or
three spoonfuls down, though I question whether
he could be sure of it or not. But it was too late,
and she died the same night.

The youth, who was preserved at the price of his
most affectionate mother's life, was not so far gone;
yet he lay in a cabin bed, as one stretched out,
with hardly any life left in him. He had a piece of
an old glove in his mouth, having eaten up the rest
of it. However, being young, and having more
strength than his mother, the mate got something
down his throat, and he began sensibly to revive,
though by giving him, some time after, but two or
three spoonfuls extraordinary, he was very sick, and
brought it up again.

But the next care was the poor maid. She lay
all along upon the deck, hard by her mistress, and
just like one that had fallen down with an apoplexy,
and struggled for life. Her limbs were distorted,
one of her hands was clasped round the frame of'
a chair, and she griped it so hard, that we could
not easily make her let go 3 her other arm lay over
her head, and her feet lay both together, set fast
against the frame of the cabin table: in short, she
lay just like one in the last agonies of death; and
yet she was alive too. '

The poor creature was not only starved with
hunger, and terrified with the thoughts of death,
but, as the men told us afterwards, was broken-
hearted for her mistress, whom she saw dying for
two or three days before, and whom she loved most
tenderly. '

We knew not what to do with this poor girl; for
when our surgeon, who was a man of very great
knowledge and experience, had with great applica-
tion recovered her, as to life, he had her upon his
hand, as to her senses; for she was little less than
distracted for a considerable time after, as shall ap-
pear presently.

Whoever shall read these memorandnms, must be
desired to consider, that visits at sea are not like a
JOurncy into the country, where sometimes people
Stay a week or a fortnight at a place. Our business
has to relieve this distressed ship's crew, but not
he by for them; and though they were willing to
steer the same course with us for some days, yet
We could carry no sail to keep pace with a ship
that had no masts. However, as their captain
begged of us to help him to set up a main~top-mast,
and a kind of tep.mast to his jury fore-mast; we
did>> as it were, lie by him for three or four days,
and then having "given him five barrels of beef, and
a barrel of pork, two hogsheads of biscuit, and a
PrdegPortion of pease, flour, and what other things we
could spare; and taking three casks of sugar, some
W"; and some pieces of eight of them for satisfac-
tion, we left them, taking on board with us, at
their own earnest request, the youth, and the maid,
and all their goods.

The young lad was about seventeen years of
age; a pretty, well bred, modest, and sensible
youth, greatly dejected with the loss of his mo-
ther; and, as it seems, had lost his father but a
few months before, at Barbadoes. I-Ie begged of
the surgeon to speak to me, to take him out of
the ship; for he said the cruel fellows had mur-
dered his mother: and, indeed, so they had, that
is to say, passively, for they might have Spared a
small sustenance to'the poor, helpless widow, that
might have preserved her life, though it had been
but just to keep her alive. But hunger knows
no friend, no relation, no justice, no right; and,
therefore, is remorseless, and capable of no com-
passion.

The surgeon told him how far we were going,
and how it would carry him away from all his
friends, and put him, perhaps, in as bad circum-
stances almost as those we found him in; that is to
say, starving in the world. He said, it mattered
not whither he went, if he was but delivered from
the terrible crew that he was among: that the cap-
tain (by which he meant me, for he could know
nothing of my nephew) had saved his life, and he
was sure would not hurt him; and as for the maid:
he was sure, if she came to herself, she would be
very thankful for it, let us carry them whither we
would. The surgeon represented the case so affec-
tionately to me, that I yielded; and we took them
both on board, with all their goods, except eleven
hogsheads of sugar, which could not be removed,
or come at: and as the youth had a bill of lading
for them, I made his commander sign a writing.
obliging himself to go, as soon as he came to Bristol,
to one Mr. Rogers, a merchant there, to whom the
youth said he was related, and to deliver a letter
which I wrote to him, and all the goods he had
belonging to the deceased widow; which, I suppose,
was not done, for I could never learn that the
ship came to Bristol, but was, as is most probable,
lost at sea, being in so disabled a condition, and so
far from any land, that I am of opinion, that the
first storm she met with afterwards, she might
founder in the sea; for she was leaky, and had
damage in her hold, when we met with her.

Iwas now in the latitude of 19 degrees, 32 mi-
nutes, and had hitherto had atolerable voyage as to
weather, though at first the winds had been con-
trary. I shall trouble nobody with the little inci-
dents of wind, weather, currents, &c. on the rest of
our voyage; but, shortening my story, for the sake
of what is to follow, shall observe that I came to
my old habitation, the island, on the 10th of April,
1595. It was with no small difficulty that I found
the place; for as I came to it, and went from it
before, on the south and east side'of the island,
as coming from the Brasils, so now coming in be-
tween the main and the island, and having no
chart for the coast, nor any land-mark, I did not

know it when I saw it, or know whether I saw it
or no.

We beat about a great while, and went on shore
on several islands, in the mouth of the great river
Croonoque, but none for my purpose, only this I
lea'ned, by my coasting the shore, that I was under
one great mistake before; viz. that the continent
which I thought I saw, from the island I lived
"1>> Was really no continent, but a long island, or
rather a ridge of islands, reaching from one to the
other side of the extended mouth of that great
river: and that the savages who came to my island,
were not properly those which we call Caribbees,
bpt islanders, and other barbarians of the same
k'nda who inhabited something nearer to our side
than the rest. .

In short, I visited several of these islands to no
Purpose: some I found were inhabited, and some
were not. On one of them I found some Spaa
niards, and thought they had lived there; but, speak-
ing with them, I found they had a sloop lay ina
small creek hard by, and that they came thither to
make salt, and to catch some peaeruscles, if they
could; but they belonged to the isle de Trinidad.
which lay farther north, in the latitude of ten and
eleven degrees.

Thus coasting from one island to another, some-
times with the ship, sometimes with the Frenchman's
shaIIOp (which we had found a convenient boat,
and therefore kept her with their very good will),
at length I came fair on the south side of my
island, and I presently knew the very countenance
of the place. So I brought the ship safe to an
anchor, broadside with the little creek, where was
my old habitation.

As soon as I saw the place, I called for Friday.
and asked him, if he knew where he was. He
looked about a little, and presently, clapping \hiS
hands, cried, ' 0 yes! 0 there! 0 yes! 0 there!'
. pointing to our old habitation, and fell a dancing
and capering like a mad fellow; and I had much
ado to keep him from jumping into the sea, to swnm
ashore to the place. '

' Well, Friday,' said I, ' do you think we shall
find any body here or no? And what do you
think, shall we see your father?' The fellow stood
mute as a stock a good while; but when I named
his father, the poor affectionate creature looked
dejected; and I could see the tears run down hi}
face very plentifnlly, ' What is the matter, Fri-
day?' said I. ' Are you troubled because you may
see your father?' ' No, no,' says he, shaking lllf;
head, ' no see him more; no, ever more see again!
' Why so,' said I, ' Friday? how do you kn?w
that?' ' 0 no, no,' says Friday; ' he long ago die:
long ago; he much old man.' ' Well, well,' said I;
' Friday, you don't know. But shall we see any
one else then?' The fellow, it seems, had better
eyes then I, and he points just to the hill above
my old house; and though we lay half a league
off, he cries out, ' Me see! me see! yes, yes; me
see much men there, and there, and there!' I
looked, but I could see nobody. no, not with a
perspective glass, which was, I suppose, because I
could not hit the place; for the fellOw was right,
as 1 found upon inquiry the next day: and there
were five or six men altogether stood to look at the
ship, not knowing what to think of us.

As soon as Friday had told me he saw people, I
caused the English ancient to be spread, and fired
three guns, to give them notice we were friends;
and about half a quarter of an hour after, we per.
ceived a smoke rise from the side of the creek. So
I immediately ordered a boat out, taking Friday
with me; and, hanging out a white flag, or flag of

' truce, I went directly on shore, taking with me

the young friar I mentioned, to whom I had told
the whole story of my living there, and the manner
0f". and every particular, both of myself, and
those that I left there; and who was, on that ac-

: caunt, extremely desirous to go with me. We had,

besides, about sixteen men, very well armed, if we
had found any new guests there which we did not
know of; but we had no need of weapons.

As we went on shore upon the tide of flood,
near high water, we rowed directly into the creek;
and the first man I fixed my eye upon was the
Spaniard, whose life I had saved, and whom I knew
by his face perfectly well: as to his habit, I shall
describe it afterwards. I ordered nobody to go on
shore at first but myself, but there was no keeping
Friday in the boat; for the affectionate creature
had spied his father at a distance, a good way ofl'
0_f the Spaniards, where indeed I saw nothing of
mm; and if they had not let him go on shore, he
would have jumped into the sea. He was no
Sponer on shore, but he flew away to his father,
11ch an arrow out of a bow. It would have made

- R
any man shed tears, in spite of the firmest resolu-
tion, to have seen the first transports of this poor
fellow's joy when he came to his father: how he
embraced him, kissed him, stroked his face, took
him up in his arms, set him down upon a tree, and
lay down by him; then stood and looked at him.
as any one would look at a strange picture, for a
quarter of an hour together; then lay down upon
the ground, and stroked his legs, and kissed them,
and then got up again, and stared at him': one
would have thought the fellow bewitched. But it
would have made a dog laugh to see how the next
day his passion ran out another way. In the morn-
ing he walked along the shore, to and again,'with
his father. several hours, always leading him by the
hand, as if he had been a lady; and every now
and then would come to fetch something or other
for him to the boat, either a lump of sugar, or a
dram, a biscuit, or something or other that was
good. In the afternoon, his frolics ran another
way, for then he would set the old man down upon
the ground, and dance about him, and make a
thousand antic postures and gestures; and all the
while he did this, he would be talking to him, and
telling him one story or another of his travels, and
of what had happened to him abroad, to divert him.
In short, if the same filial affection was to be found
in Christians to their parents in our parts of the
world, one would be tempted to say, there hardly
would have been any need of the Fifth Command'
ment. .

But this is a digression: I return to my landing-
It would be endless to take notice of all the cere-
monies and civilities that the Spaniards received me
with. The first Spaniard, whom, as I said, I knew
very well, was he whose life I had saved: he came
towards the boat, attended by one more, carryinga
flag of truce also; and he did not only not know
me at first, but he had no thoughts, no notion, 0f
its being me that was come, till I spoke to him-
'Seignior,' said I, in Portuguese, "do you not know
me?' At which he spoke not a word; but giving
his musket to the man that was with him, threw his
arms abroad, and, saying something in Spanish that
I did not perfectly hear, came forward and em-
braced me, telling me he was inexcusable not to
know that face again, that he had once seen, as of
an angel from heaven sent to save his life. He
said abundance of very handsome things, as a well-
bred Spaniard always knows how; and then beck-
oning to the person that attended him, bade him
go and call out his comrades. He then asked me,
if I would walk to my old habitation, where he
would give me possession of my own house again,
and where I should see there had been but mean
improvements. So I walked along with him; but,
alas! I could no more find the place again, than
if I had never been there: for they had planted so
many trees, and placed them in such a posture, so
thick and close to one another; and in ten years'
time they were grown so big, that, in short, the
place was inaccessible, except by such windings,
and blind ways, as they themselves only who made
them could find.

I asked them, what put them upon all these for-
tifications. He told me, 1 would say there was
need enough of it; when they had given me an
account how they hadpassed their time since their
arriving in the island, especially after they had the
misfortune to find I was gone. He told me, he
could not but have some satisfaction in my good
fertune, when he heard that I "was gone in a good
Ship. and to my satisfaction; and that he had often-
times a strong persuasion, that one time or other
he should see me again. But nothing that ever
bcfel him in his life, he said, was so surprising and
afflicting to him at first, as the disappointment he
Was under When he came back to the island, and
fOund I was not there.

>> As to the three barbarians (so he called them)
that were left behind, and of whom he said he had
a long story to tell me, the Spaniards all thought
themselves much better among the savages, only
that their number was so small. ' And,' says he,
' had they been strong enough, we had been all
long ago in purgatory;' and with that he crossed
himself upon the breast. ' But, sir,' says he, ' I
hope you will not be displeased, when I shall tell
you how, forced by necessity, we were obliged, for
our own preservation, to disarm them, and make
them our subjects, who would not be content with
being moderately our masters, but would be our
murderers. I answered, I was heartily afraid of it
when 1 left them there; and nothing troubled me
at my parting from the island, but that they were
not come back, that I might have put them in p05-
session of every thing first, and left the other in a
state of subjection, as they deserved. But if they
had reduced them to it, I was very glad, and should
be very far from finding any. fault with it; for
I knew they were a parcel of refractory, ungo-
vernable villains, and were fit for any manner of
mischief.

While I was saying this, came the man whom he
had sent back, and with him eleven men more. In
the dress they were in, it was impossible to guess
what nation they were of; but he made all clear,
both to them and to me. First, he turned to me,
and. pointing to them, said, ' These, sir, are some of
the gentlemen who owe their lives to you;' and
then turning to them, and pointing to me, he let
them know who I was. Upon which, they all
came up, one by one, not as if they had been
sailors, and ordinary fellows, and I the like, but
really as if they had been ambassadors of noble-
men, and I a monarch, or a great conqueror. Their
behaviour was, to the last degree, obliging and
courteous, and yet mixed with a manly, majestic
gravity which very well became them; and, in
short, they had so much more manners than I, that
I scarce knew how to receive their civilities, much
less how to return them in kind.

The history of their coming to, and conduct in,
the island, after my going away, is so remarkable,
and has so many incidents which the former part
of my relation will help to understand, and which
will, in most of the particulars, refer to that ac-
count I have already given, that I cannot but com-
mit them with great delight to the reading of those
that come after me.

I shall no longer trouble the story with a relation
in the first person, which will put me to the ex'
pense of ten thousand ' said I's,' and ' said he's,'
and ' he told me's,' and ' I told him's,' and the like;
but I shall collect the facts historically, as near as I
can gather them out of my memory, from what they
related to me, and from what 1 met with in my
conversing with them, and with the place.

In order to do this succinctly, and as intelligibly
as I can, I must go back to the circumstance in
which I left the island, and which the persons were
311.0? whom I am to speak. And first, it is neces-
sary to repeat, that I had sent away Friday's father
and the Spaniard, the two whose lives I had rescued
from the savages; I say, I had sent 'them away, in
a large canoe, to the main, as I then thought it,
to fetch over the Spaniard's companions whom he
had left behind him, in order to save them from the
like calamity that he had been in; and in order to
succour them for the present, and that, if possible,
we might together find some way for our deliver-
ance afterward.

. When I sent them away, I had no visible appear-
ance of, or the least room to hope for, my own deo
llverance any more than I had twenty years before;
much less had I any foreknowledge of what after
haWalled, I mean of an English ship coming on
shore there to fetch me ofi'; and it could not but
be a very great surprise to them, when they came
back, not only to find that I was gone, but to find
three strangers left on the spot, possessed of all
that I had left behind me, which would otherwise
have been their own.

The first thing, however, which I inquired into.
that I might begin where I left off, was of their own
part; and I desired he would give me a particular
account of his voyage back to his countrymen with
the boat, when I sent him to fetch them over. He
told me there was little variety in that part; for
nothing remarkable happened to them on the way.
they having very calm weather, and a smooth sea.
For his countrymen, it could not be doubted, he
said, but that they were overjoyed to see him: (It
seems, he was the principal man among them, the
captain of the vessel they had been shipwrecked
in, having been dead some time.) They were, he
said, the more surprised to see him. because they
knew that he was fallen into the hands of savages,
who, they were satisfied, would devour him, as they
did all the rest of their prisoners; that when he
told them the story of his deliverance, and in what
manner he was furnished for carrying them away.
it was like a dream to them; and their. astonish-
ment, they said, was something like that of Joseph's
brethren, when he told them who he was, and told
them the story of his exaltation in Pharoah's court-
But when he showed them the arms, the powder>>
the ball, and the provisions, that he brought them
for their journey, or voyage, they were restored to
themselves, took a just share of the joy of their (10'
liverance, and immediately prepared to come away
with him.

Their first business was to get canoes; and in
this they were obliged not to stick so much upqll
the honest part of it, but to trespass upon their
friendly savages, and to borrow two large canoes, 0r
periaguas, on pretence of going out a fishing, or for
pleasure.

In these they came away the next morning. It
seems they wanted no time to get themselves read}?
for they had no baggage, neither clothes, nor provi'
sions, nor any thing in the world, but what they
had on them, and a few roots to eat, of which they
used to make their bread.

They were in all three weeks absent, and in- that'
time, unluckily for them, I had the occasion offered
for my escape, as I mentioned in my other part, and
to get off from the island, leaving three of the most
impudent, hardened, ungoverned, disagreeable vil-
lains behind me, that any man could desire to meet
with; to the poor Spaniards' great grief and disap-
pointment, you may be sure.

The only just thing the rogues did, was, that
when the Spaniards came on shore they gave my
letter to them, and gave them provisions, and
other relief, as I had ordered them to do. Also
they gave them the long paper of directions, which
I had left with them, containing the particular
methods whichl took for managing every part of
My life there, the way how I baked my bread, bred
up my tame goats, and planted my corn; how I
cured my grapes, made my pots, and, in a word,
every thing I did. All this being written down,
they gave to the Spaniards, two of whom under-
Stood English well enough. Nor did they refuse to
accommodate the Spaniards with any thing else,
for they agreed very well for some time: they gave
them an equal admission into the house, or cave,
and they began to live very sociabiy; and the
head Spaniard,.who had seen pretty much of my
methods, and Friday's father together, managed all
their affairs; for, as for the Englishmen, they did
nothing but ramble about the island, shoot parrots,
and catch tortoises; and when they came home at
night, the Spaniards provided their suppers for
them.

The Spaniards would have been satisfied with
this. would the others but have let them alone,
which, however, they could not find in their hearts
to do long: but, like the dog in the manger, they..v V",-- .. '7 - "--'<'"'--_ .--

would not eat themselves, and would not let others
eat neither. The differences, nevertheless, were at
first but trivial, and such as are not worth relating;
but at last it broke out into open war, and it began
with all the rudeness and insolence that can be ima-
gined, without reason, without provocation, contrary
to nature, and, indeed, to common sense; and
though it is true, the first relation of it came from
the Spaniards themselves, whom I may call the ac-
cusers, yet when I came to examine the fellows, they
could not deny a word of it.

But before I come to the particulars of this part,
I must supply a defect in my former relation; and
this was, that I forgot to set down among the rest,
that, just as we were weighing the anchor to set
sail, there happened a little quarrel on board our
ship, which I was afraid once would turn to a
second mutiny; nor was it appeased, till the cap<<
tain, rousing up his courage, and taking us all to
his assistance, parted them by force, and making
two of the most refractory fellows prisoners, he
laid them in irons; and as they had been active
in the former disorders, and let fall some ugly.

'dangerous words the second time, he threatened to

carry them in irons to England, and have them
hanged there for mutiny and running away with
the ship. .

This, it seems, though the captain did not intend
to do it, frighted some other men in the ship; and
some of them had put it into the heads of the rest,
that the captain only gave them goodwdrds for the
present, till they should come to some English port;
and that then they should be all put into a goal, and
tried for their lives.

The mate got intelligence of this, and acquainted
us with it; ; upon which it was desired, that I, who
still passed for a great man among them, should go
down with the mate, and satisfy the men, and tell
them, that they might be assured, if they behaved
well the rest of the voyage, all they had done for
the time past should be pardoned. So I went,
and, after passing ' my houonr's' word to them,
they appeared easy, and the more so, when I caused
the two men, who were in irons, to be released and
forgiven.

But this mutiny had brought us to an anchor
for that night, the wind also falling calm. Next
morning we found that our two men, who had been
laid in irons, had stole each of them a musket,
and some other weapons; what powder or shot
they had, we know not; and had taken the ship's
pinnace, which was not yet hauled up, and run
away with her to their companions in roguery
on shore.

As soon as we found this, I ordered the long-
boat on shore, with tWelve men and the mate, and
away they went to seek the rogues ; but they could
neither find them, nor any of the rest, for they all
lied into the woods, when they saw the boat coming
on shore. The mate was once resolved, in justice
to their roguery, to have destroyed their planta-
tions, burnt all their household stuff and furniture,
and left them to shift without it: but having no
Order, he let all alone, left every thing as he found
it, and, bringing the pinnace away, came on board
without them.

These two men made their number five; but the
Other three villains were so much wickeder than
tlie-">8. that, after they had been two or three days
tOgether, they turned their two new-comers out of
doors to shift for themselves, and would have no-
. thing to do with them, nor could they, for a good
While. be persuaded to give them any food: as for
the Spaniards, they were not yet come.

When the Spaniards came first on shore, the busi-
ness began to go forward: the Spaniards would
have persuaded the three English brutes to have
taken in their'two countrymen again, that, as they
said, they might be all one family; but they would
n0t hear 'of it. So the two poor fellows lived by

R 2
themselves, and, finding nothing but industry and
application would make them live comfortably, they
pitched their tents on the north shore of the island,
but a little more to the west, to be out of the clan.
ger of the savages, who always landed on the east
parts of the island.

Here they built them two huts ; one to lodge in,
and the other to lay up their magazines and stores
in: and the Spaniards having given them some corn
for seed, and especially some of the pease which I
had left them, they- dug and planted, and enclosed,
after the pattern I had set for them all. and began
to live pretty well. Their first crop of corn was
on' the ground; and though it was but a little bit
of-land which they had dug up at first, having had
but a little time, yet it was enough to relieve them,
and find them with bread, and other eatables: and
one of the fellows, being the cook's mate of the
'ship, was very ready at making soup, puddings,
and such other preparations as the rice, and the
milk, and such little flesh as they got, furnished
him to do.

They were going on in this little thriving pos-
ture, when the three unnatural rogues, their own
countrymen too, in mere humour, and to insult
them, came and bullied them, and told them the
island was theirs; that the governor, meaning'me,
had given them possession of it, and nobody else
had any right to it; and d--n them, they should
build no houses upon their ground, unless they
would pay them rent for them.

The two men thought they had jested at first, and

asked them to come and sit down, and see what.

fine houses they were that they had built, and tell
them what rent they demanded. And one of them
merrily told them, if they were ground landlords,
he hoped, if they built tenements upon the land,
and made improvements, they would, according to
the custom of all landlords, grant them a long
lease; and bade them go fetch a scrivener to draw
the writings. One of the three, d--niug and rag-
ing, told them, they should see they were not in
jest; and going to a little place at a distance,
where the honest men had made a fire to dress
their victuals, he takes a fire-brand, and claps it
to the outside of their hut, and very fairly set it on
fire; and it would have been all burnt down in a
few minutes, if one of the two had not run to
the fellow, thrust him away, and trod the fire out
with his feet, and that not without some diffi-
culty too. i

The fellow was in such a rage at the honest man's
thrusting him away, that he turned upon him with
a pole he had in his hand; and had not the man
avoided the blow very nimbly, and run into the hut,
he had ended his days at once. His comrade, see-
ing the danger they were both in, ran in after him,
and immediately they came both out with their
muskets; and the man that was first struck at with
the pole, knocked the fellow down who began the
quarrel with the stock of his musket, and that be-
fore the other two could come to help him; and.
then seeing the rest come at them, they stood to-
gether, and presenting the other ends of their pieces
to them, bade them stand off.

The others had fire-arms with them too; but one
of the two honest men, bolder than his comrade,
and made desperate by his danger, told them, if
they offered to move hand or foot, they were all
dead men; and boldly commanded them to lay
down their arms. They did not,indeed, lay down
their arms; but seeing him so resolute, it brought
them to a parley, and they consented to take their
Wounded man with them, and be gone: and, in-
deed. it seems the fellow was wounded sufficiently
wrth the blow. However, they were much in the
wrong, since they had the advantage, that they
dld not disarm them effectually, as they might have
done, and have gone immediately to'the Spaniards,
and given them. an account how the rogues had
treated them; for the three villains studied nothing
but revenge, and every day gave them some intima-
tion that they did so.

But not to crowd this part with an account of.
the lesser part of their rogueries, such as treading
down their corn, shooting three young kids, and a
she goat, which the poor men had got to breed up
tame for their store; and, in a word, plaguing them
night and day in this manner; it forced the two
men to such a desperation, that they resolved to
fight them all three the first time they had a fair
opportunity. In order to do this, they resolved to
go to the castle, as they called it, that was my old
dwelling, where the three rogues and the Spaniards '
all lived together, at that time, intending to have
a fair battle, and the Spaniards should stand by to
see fair play. So they got up in the morning before
day, and came to the place, and called the English-
men by their names, telling a Spaniard that answer-
ed, that they wanted to speak with them.

It happened that the day before two of the Spa-
niards having been in the woods, had seen one
of the two Englishmen, whom, for distinction, Icall
the honest men; and he had made a sad complaint
to the Spaniards, of the barbarous usage they had
met with from their three countrymen, and how
they had ruined their plantation, and destroyed
their corn, that they had laboured so'hard to bring
forward, and killed the milch-goat, and their three
kids, which was all they had provided for their 3115'
tenance; and that if he and his friends, meaning
the Spaniards, did not assist them again, they
should be starved. When the Spaniards came
home at night, and they were all at. supper, he took
the freedom to reprovc the three Englishmen,
though in gentle and mannerly terms, and ask-
ed them, how they could be so cruel, they being
harmless, inoffensive fellows; and that they were
putting themselves in a way to subsist by their
labour, and that it had cost them a great PS1631
of pains to bring things to such a perfection as they
had.

One of the Englishmen returned very briskly,
what had they to do there: that they came on
shore without leave, and that they should not plant
or build upon the island; it was none of their
ground. ' Why,' says the Spaniard, very calmly,
' Seignior Inglcse, they must not starve.' The Eng-
lishman replied, like a true rough-hewn tarpanlin
they might starve and be (3-- ncd : they should not
plant, nor build in that place. ' But what must
they do then, seignior ?' says the Spaniard. An-
other of the brutes returned, Do! d--n them, they
should be servants, and work for them. ' But how
can you expect that of them? They are not bought
with your money: you have no right to make them
servants.' The Englishmen answered, the island
was theirs, the governor had given it to them, and
no man had any thing to do there but themselves ;
and with that swore by his Maker, that they would
go and burn all their new huts: they should build
none upon their land.

' Why, seignior,' says the Spaniard, ' by the same
rule, we must be your servants too.' ' Aye,' says
the bold dog, ' and so you. shall too, before we have
done with you,' mixing two or three ' G-d 'd--n
me's' in the proper intervals of his speech. The
Spaniard only smiled at that, and made him no an-
swer. However, this little discourse had heated
them; and starting up, one says to the other, I
think it was he they called Will Atkins, ' Come,
Jim", let us go and have t'other brush with them:
We'll demolish their castle, I'll warrant you; they
shall plant. no colony in our dominions.'

Upon this, they went all trooping away, with
every man a gun, a pistol, and a sword, and mut-
tered some insolent. things among themselves, of
what they would do to the Spaniards too, when op-
POTtunity olfered. But the Spaniards, it seems, did

particulars; only that, in general, they threatened
them hard for taking the two Euglishmen's part.

Whither they went, or how they bestowed their
time that evening, the Spaniards said, they did not
know ; but it seems they wandered about the coun-
try, part of the night, and then lying down in the
place which I used to call my bower, they were
weary, and overslept themselves. The case was
this: they had resolved to stay till midnight, and
so take the poor men when they were asleep ; and,
as they acknowledged afterwards, intended to set
fire to their huts, while they were in them, and
either burn them in them, or murder them as they
came out. And as malice seldom sleeps very sound,
it was very strange they should not have been kept
waking.

However, as the two men had also a design upon
them, as I have said, though a much fairer one than
that of burning and murdering, it happened, and
very luckily for them all,that they were up and
gone abroad, before the bloody-minded rogues came
to their huts. .

When they came thither, and found the men
gone, Atkins, who, it seems, was the forwardest
man, called out to his comrades, ' Ha! Jack, here's
the nest; but, d--n them, the birds are flown}
They mused a while to think what should be the
occasion of their being gone abroad so soon, and
suggested presently that the Spaniards had given
them notice of it; and with that they shook hands,
and swore to one another, that they would be re.
venged of the Spaniards. As soon as they had
made this bloody bargain, they fell to work with
the poor men's habitation. They did not set fire
indeed to any thing, but they pulled down both
their houses; and pulled them so limb from limb
that they left not the least stick standing, or scarce
any sign on the ground where they stood. They
tore all their little collected household stuff in
pieces, and threw every thing about in such a man-
ner, that the poor men found, afterwards, some of
their things a mile off from their habitation.

When they had done this, they pulled up all the
young trees which the poor men had planted:
pulled up the enclosure they had made to secure
their cattle and their corn ; and, in a word, sacked
and plundered every thing as completely as a horde
of Tartars would have done.

The two men were, at this juncture, gone to find
them out, and had resolved to fight them where.
ever they had been, though they were but two to
three: so that, had they met, there certainly would
have been bloodshed among them; for they were
all! very stout, resolute fellows, to give them their

ue.

But Providence took more care to keep them
asunder, than they themselves could do to meet;
for, as if they had dogged one another, when the
three were gone thither, the two were here; and
afterwards when the two went back to find them,
the three were come to the old habitation again:
we shall see their differing conduct presently.
When the three came back, like furious creatures,
flushed with the rage which the work they had
been about had put them into, they came. up to the
Spaniards, and told them what they had done, by
Wayof scoff and bravado; and one of them step-
Ping up to one of the Spaniards, as if they had
been acouple of boys at play, takes hold of his
hat, as'it was upon his head; and giving it a twirl
about. fleering in his face, says he to him, ' And
you.seignior Jack Spaniard, shall have the same
sauce, if you do not mend your manners.' The
Spaniard, who, though a quiet, civil man, was as
brave as a man could be desired to be, and withal
a strong well-made man, looked steadily at him,
{9! a good while; and then, having no weapon in
his hand,stepped gravely up to him, and. with one
blow of his fist, knocked him down, as an ox is fell-
9d with a pole-axe ; at which one of the rogues,
insolent as the first, fired his pistol at the' Spaniard
immediately. He missed his body, indeed, for the
bullets went through his hair; but one of them
touched the tip of his ear, and he bled pretty much.
The blood made the Spaniard believe he was more
hurt than he really was, and that put him into
some heat, for before he acted all in a perfect calm;
but, now resolving to go through with his work, he
stooped, and took the fellow's musket whom he had
knocked down, and wasjust going to shoot the man
who had fired at him, when the rest of the Spa-
niards, being in the cave, came out, and, calling to
him not to shoot, they stepped in, secured the other
two, and took their arms from them.

When they were thus disarmed, and found they
had made all the Spaniards their enemies, as well
as their own countrymen, they began to cool, and
giving the Spaniards better words, would have had
their arms again; but the Spaniards, considering
the feud that was between them and the other two
Englishmen, and that it would be the best method
they could take, to keep them from one another.
told 'them they would do them no harm; and if
they would live peaceably, they would be very will.
ing to assist and associate with them, as they did
before; but that they could not think of giving them
their arms again, while they appeared so resolved
to do mischief with them to their. own countrymen,
and had even threatened them all to make them
'their servants.

The rogues were not more capable to hear rea-
son, than to act reason; and, being'refused their
arms, they went raving away, and raging like mad-
men, threatening what they would do, though they
had no firearms. But the Spaniards, despising
their threatening, told them, they should take care
how they offered any injury to their plantation or
cattle; for if they did, theyfiwould shoot them, 85
they would do ravenous beasts, wherever the.)l
found them; and if they fell into their hands alive:
they would certainly be hanged. However, this
was far from cooling them; but away they went
raging and swearing, like furies of hell. As soon
as they were gone, came back the two men, in pas-
sion and rage enough also, though of. another kind:
for having been at their plantation, and finding
it all demolished and destroyed, as above, it will
easily be supposed they had provocation enough:
they could scarce have room to tell their tale, the
Spaniards were so eager to tell them theirs; and
it was strange enough to find, that three men
should thus bully nineteen, and receive no punish-
ment at all.

The Spaniards, indeed, despised them, and, espe-
cially having thus disarmed them, made light of
their threatenings; but the two Englishmen re-
solved to have their remedy against them, what
pains soever it cost to find them out.

But the Spaniards interposed here too, and told
them, that as they were already disarmed, they could
not consent that they (the two) should pursue
them with fire-arms, and perhaps kill them. ' But,'
said the grave Spaniard, who was their governor,
' we will endeavour to make them do you justice,
if you will leave it to us ; for as there is no doubt
but they will come to us again when their passion
Is over, being not able to subsist without our as.
sistance, we promise you to make no peace with
them, without having a full satisfaction for you;
and, upon this condition, we hope you will promise
to use no violence with them, other than in your
OWn defence.'

The two Englishmen yielded to this very awk-
wardly, and with great reluctance; but the Spa-
niards protested, they did it only to keep them
from bloodshed, and to make all easy at last;
f for,' said they, ' we are not so many of us: here
Is room enough for us all, and it is great pity we
Should not, be all good friends.' At length they did
consent, and waited for the issue of the thing, liv-
ing for some days with the Spaniards; for their own
habitation was destroyed,

In about five days' time, the three vagrants, tired
with wandering, and almost starved with hunger},
having chiefly lived on turtles' eggs all that while,
came back to the grove; and finding my Spaniard,
who, as I have said, was the governor, and two
more with him, walking by the side of the creek:
they came. up in a very submissive, humble man-
ner, and begged to be received again into the
family. The Spaniards used them civilly, but told
them, they had acted so unnaturally by their coun-
trymen, and so very grossly by them (the Spa-
niards), that they could not come to any conclu-
sion without consulting the two Englishmen, and
the rest. But, however, they would go to them,
and discourse about it, and they should know in
half an hour. It may be guessed, that they were
very hard put to it; for, it seems, as they were to
wait this half hour for an answer, they begged they
would send them out some bread in the mean time;
which they did, and sent them, at the same time,
a large piece of goat's flesh, and a broiled parrot,
which they eat very heartily, for they were hungry
enough. -

After half an hour's consultation, they were
called in, and a long debate had about them, their
two countrymen charging them with the ruin of all
their labour, and a design to murder them: a"
which they owned before, and therefore could not
deny now. Upon the whole, the Spaniards acted
the moderators between them; and as they had
obliged the two Englishmen not to. hurt the three,
while they were naked and unarmed, so they
now obliged the three to go and rebuild their
fellows' two huts, one to be of the same dimen-
sions, and the other larger than before; also to
fence their ground again, where they had pulled
up the fences, plant trees in the room of those
pulled up, dig up the land again for planting com;
' where they had spoiled it; and, in a word, to re-
store every thing in the same state as they found
it. as near as they could; for entirely it could not
be, the season for the corn, and the growth of the
trees and hedges, not being possible to be re-
covered. '

Well, they submitted to all this; and as they
had plenty of provisions given them all the while,
they grew very orderly, and the whole society
began to live pleasantly and agreeably together
again: only that these three fellows could never
be persuaded to work; I mean, for themselves,
except now and then a little, just as they pleased.
However, the Spaniards told them plainly, that if
they would but live sociably and friendly together,
and study. in the whole, the good of the plantation,
they would be content to work for them, and let
them walk about and be as idle as they pleased:
and thus having lived pretty well together for a
month or two, the Spaniards gave them, their arms
again, and gave them liberty to go abroad with them
as before. .

It was not above a week after they had these
arms and went abroad, but the ungrateful creatures
began to be insolent and troublesome as before.
But, however, an accident happening presently
upon this, which endangered the safety of them
all, they were obliged to lay by all private re-
fentments, and look to the preservation of their
1ves.

It happened one night, that the Spaniard gover-
"01335 I call him; that is to say, the Spaniard,
whose life I had saved, who was now the captain,
or leader, or governor of the rest, found himself
very uneasy in the night, and could by no means
get any sleep. He was perfectly well in body, as
he told me the story, only found his thoughts tu-
multous: his mind ran upon men fighting, and
killing one another, but was broad awake. and
could not by any means get any sleep. In short,
he lay a great while, but growing more and more
uneasy, he resolved to rise. As they lay, being
so many of them, upon goatskins, laid thick upon
such couches and pads as they made for them-
selves, and not in hammocks and ship~beds, as
I did, who was but one: 'so they had little to do,
when they were willing to rise, but to get up upon
their feet, and, perhaps, put on a coat, such as it
was, and their pumps, and they were ready for
going any way that their thoughts guided them.

Being thus gotten up, he looked out; but, being
dark, he could see little or nothing: and, besides,
the trees which I had planted, as in my former ac-
count is described, and which were now grown tall,
intercepted his sight, so that he could only look
up, and see that it was a clear star-light night;
and, hearing no noise, he returned, and laid him
down again; but it was all one, he could not sleep;
nor could he compose himself to any thing like
rest, but his thoughts were, to the last degree, ml-
easy, and yet he knew not for what.

Having made some noise with rising and walking
about, going out and coming in, another of them
waked, and, calling, asked who it was that was
up. The governor told him, how it had been with
him. ' Say you so ?' says the other Spaniard. ' Such
things are not to be slighted, I assure you: there is
certainly some mischief working,' says he, ' near
us.' And presently he asked him, ' Where are the
Englishmen ?' ' They are all in their huts}: says he,
' safe enough.' It seems, the Spaniards had kept
possession of the main apartment, and had made
"a place where the three Englishmen, since their
last mutiny, always quartered by themselves, and
could not come at the rest. ' Well,' says the Spa-
niard, ' there is something in it, I am persuaded
from my own experience. I am satisfied our spirits
embodied have a converse with, and receive intelli- .
genes from, the spirits 'unembodied, and inhabiting
the invisible world; and this friendly notice is given
for our advantage, if we know how to make use
of it. Come,' says he, ' let us go out, and look
abroad; and if we find nothing at all in it to justify
our trouble, I will tell you a story to the purpose,
that shall convince you of the justness of my pro-
posing it.'

In a word, they went out to go to the top of the
hill. where I used to go; but they, being strong, and
in good company, not alone, as I was, used none of
my cautions, to go up by the ladder, and then pull-
ing it up after them, to go up a second stage to the
tap, but were going round through the grove, un-
concerned and unwary, when they were surprised
with seeing a light, as of fire, a very little way off
from them, and hearing the voices of men, not of
one, or two, but of a great-number.

In all the discoveries I had made of the savages
landing on the island, it was my constant care to
prevent them making the least discovery of there
being any inhabitant upon the place; and when, by
any occasion, they came to know it, they felt it so
effectually, that they that got away were scarce
able to give any account of it; for they disappeared
as soon as possible; nor did ever any that had seen
me escape to tell any one else, except it were the
three savages in our last encounter, who jumped into
the boat, of whom I mentioned that I was afraid
they should go home, and bring more help.

Whether it was the consequence of the escape of
those men, that so greata number came now to-
gether; or whether they came ignorantly, and by
accident, "on their usual blooody errand, the Spa'
niards could not, it seems, understand. But what-
ever it was, it had been their business, either to
have concealed themselves, and not have seen
them at all, much less to have let the savages have
seen that there were any inhabitants in the place;
or to have fallen upon them so effectually, as that
nOt a man of them should have escaped, which
could only have been by getting in between them
and their-boats,- but this presence of mind was want-
ing to them, which was the ruin of their tranquil-
lity for a great while.

We need not doubt, but that the governor, and
the man with him, surprised with this sight, ran
back immediately, and raised their fellows, giving
them an account of the imminent danger they
were all in; and they again as readily took the
alarm; but it was impossible to persuade them to
stay close within where they were, but that they
must run all out to see how things stood.

While it was dark, indeed, they were well enough,
and they had opportunity enough, for some hours,
to view them by the light of three fires, they had
made, at some distance from one another. What
' they were doing, they knew not, and what to do
themselves, they knew not; for, first, the enemy
were too many; and, secondly, they did not keep
together, but were divided into several parties,
and were on shore in several places. t

The Spaniards were in no small consternation at
this sight; and as they found that the fellows ran
straggling all over the shore, they made no doubt,
but, first or last, some of them would chop in
upon their habitation, or upon some other place,
where they would see the tokens of inhabitants;
and they were in great perplexity also for fear of
their flock of goats, which would have been little
less than starving them, if they should have been
destroyed; so the first thing they resolved upon:
was, to dispatch three men away, before it was
light, viz. two Spaniards and one Englishman, to
drive all the goats away to the great valley Where

the cave was, and, if need were, to drive them into
' the very cave itself.

Could they have seen the savages altogether in
one body, and at any distance from their canoes,
they resolved, if they had been a hundred of them;
to have attacked them ; but that could not be ob'
tained, for they were some of them two miles off
from the other, and, as it appeared afterwards, were
of two different nations.

After having mused a great while on the course
they should take, and beaten their brains in con-
sidering their present circumstances, they resolved
at last, while it was dark, to send the old savage
(Friday's father) out, as a spy, to learn, if possible,
something concerning them, as what they came for,
and what they intended to do and the like. The
old man readily undertook it, and, stripping him-
self quite naked, as most of the savages were, away
he went. After he had been gone an hour or two,
he brings word, that he had been among them un-
discovered, that he found they were two parties,
and of two several nations, who had war with one
another, and had had a great battle in their own
country, and that both sides having had several
prisoners taken in the fight, they were, by mere
chance, landed in the same island, for the devoun
ing their prisoners, and making merry: but their
coming so by chance to the same place had spoiled
all their mirth; that they were in a great rage at
one another, and were so near that he believed
they would fight again, as soon as daylight began
to appear: but he did not perceive that they had
any notion of any body's being on the island but
themselves. He had hardly made an end of tell-
mg his story, when they could perceive by the un.
usual noise they made, that the two little armies
were engaged in a bloody fight.

Friday's father used all the arguments he could
1:0 persuade our people to lie close, and not be
seen. He told them their safety consisted in it,
and that they had nothing to do but to lie still,
and the savages would kill one another to their
hands, and then the rest would go away: and it was
39 to a tittle. But it was impossible to prevail, espe-
F'auy upon the Englishmen; their curiosity was so
lmportunatc upon their prudentials, that they must
mn'out and see the battle. However, they used some
caution too,-viz. they did not go openly, just by
their own dwelling, butwent farther into the woods,
and placed themselves to advantage where they
might securely see them manage the fight, and,
as they thought, not be seen by them; but, it
seems, the savages did see them, as we shall find
hereafter. .

The battle was very fierce, and, if I might be-
lieve the Englishmen, one of them said, he could
perceive that some of them were men of great
bravery, of invincible Spirits, and of great p0-
licy in guiding the fight. The battle, they said,
held two hours, before they could guess which
party would be beaten; but then that party which
was nearest our people's habitation began to ap-
pear weakest, and, after some time more, some of
them began to fly; and this put our men again
into a great consternation, lest any of those that
fled should run into the grove, before their dwell-
ing, for shelter, and thereby involuntarily discover
the place; and that, by consequence, the pursuers
should do the like in search for them. Upon this:
they resolved that they would stand armed within
the wall, and whoever came into the grove they
should, sally out over the wall, and kill them; 50
that if possible, not one should return to give an
account of it: they ordered also, that it should
be done with their swords, or by knocking them
down with the stock .of the musket, not by shoot-
ing them, for fear of raising an alarm by the
noise.

As they expected, it fell out: three of the rout-
ed army fled for life, and, crossing the creek, ran

directly into the place, not in the least knowing.

whither they went, but running as into a thick
wood for shelter. The scout they kept to look
abroad, gave notice of this within, with this ad-
dition, to our men's great satisfaction, viz. that
the conquerors had not pursued them, nor seen
which way they were gone. Upon this, the 598'
niard governor, a man of humanity, would not -
suffer them to kill the three fugitives; but, send-
ing three men out by the top of the hill, ordered
them to go round, and come in behind them, sur-
prise and take them prisoners, which was done.
The residue of the conquered peOple fled to their
canoes, and got off to sea; the victors retired, and
made no pursuit, or very little, but drawing them-
selves iuto a body together, gave two great scream-
ing shouts, which they supposed was by way of
triumph; and so the fight ended. And the same
day, about three o'clock in the afternoon, they also
marched to their canoes. And thus the Spaniards
had their island again free to themselves: their
fright was over, and they saw no savages in several
years after.

After they were all gone, the Spaniards came out
of their den; and viewing the field of battle, they
{Ound about two-and-thirty dead men upon the
Spot: some were killed with great, long arrows,
several of which were found sticking in their bo-
dies; but most of them were killed with their great
wooden swords, sixteen or seventeen of which
they found in the field of battle, and as many
bows, with a great many arrows. These swords
were great, unwieldy things, and they must be
"0'31 Strong men that used them. Most of those
men that were killed with them had their heads
inashed to pieces, as we may say; .or, as we call it
"1 English, their brains knocked out, and several
0f their arms and legs broken: so that it is evi-
dent they fight with inexpressible rage and fury.
They found not one wounded man that was not
Stone dead; for either they stay by their enemy till
they have quite killed him, or they carry all their
zounded men, that are not quite dead, away with

mm.

This deliverance tamed our Englishmen for a
great while ;' the sight had filled them with horror,
and the consequences appeared terrible to the

S
last degree, especially upon supposing that some
time or other they should fall into the hands of
those creatures, who would not only kill them as
enemies, but kill them for food, as we kill our
cattle. And they professed to me, that the thoughts
of being eaten up like beef or mutton, though it
was supposed it was not to be till they were dead,
had something in it so horrible, that it nauseated
their very stomachs, made them sick when they
thought of it, and filled their minds with such un-
usual terror, that they were not themselves for
some weeks after.

This, as I said, tamed even the'three English
brutes I have been speaking of; and, for a great
while after, they were very tractable, and went
about the common business of the whole society
well enough; planted, sowed, reaped, and be-
gan to be all naturalized to the country: but
some time after this, they fell all into such mea'
sures again as brought them into a great deal of
trouble.

They had taken three prisoners, as I have observ-
ed; and these three being lusty, stout, young fel-
lows, they made them servants, and taught them to
Work for them; and as slaves, they did well enough-
But they did not take their measures with them,
as I did by my that: Friday; viz". to begin with
them upon the principle of having saved their
lives, and then instruct them in the rational prin-
ciples of life, much less of religion, civilizing and
_reducing them by kind usage and ali'ectionate ar-
'guings; but, as they gave them their food ever!
day, so they gave them their work too, and kept
them fully employed in drudgery enoughz. bl"
they failed in this by it, that they never had them
to assist them and fight for them, as I had my 013?
Friday, who was as true to me as the very fits"
upon my bones.

But to come to the family part: being all now
good friends (for common danger, as I said above:
had efi'ectually reconciled them), they began to
consider their general circumstances. And the first
thing that came under their consideration was,
whether seeing the savages particularly haunted
that side of the island, and that there were more
remote and retired parts of it equally adapted to
their way of living, and manifestly to their advan-
tage, they should not rather remove their habita-
tion, and plant in some more proper place for their
safety, and especially for the security of their cattle
and corn.

Upon this, after long debate, it was concluded,
that they would not remove their habitation, be-
cause that some time or other they thought they
might hear from their governor again, meaning
me; and if I should send any one to seek them, I
would be sure to direct them on that side, where,
if they should find the place demolished, they
would conclude the savages had killed us all, and
we were gone; and so our supply would go away
too. .

But as to their corn and cattle, they agreed to
remove them into the valley where my cave was,
where the land was as proper for both, and where
indeed there was land enough. However, upon
second thoughts, they altered one part of that re-
solution too, and resolved only to remove part of
their cattle thither, and plant part of their corn
there; and so, if one part was destroyed, the other
might be saved. And one piece of prudence they
used, which it was very well they did; viz. that
they never trusted those three savages, which they
had taken prisoners, with knowing any thing of the
Plantation they had made in that valley, or of any
cattle they had there; much less of the cave there,
which they kept in case of necessity, as a safe re-
treat; and whither they carried also the two bar-
rels of powder which I had sent them at my com-
lng away. '

But, however, they resolved not to change their
habitation; yet they agreed that, as' I had care>>
fully covered it first with a wall or fortification, and
then with a grove of trees; so, seeing their safety
consisted entirely in their being concealed, of which
they were now fully convinced, they set to work
to cover and conceal the place yet more effectually
than before. To this purpose, as I had planted
trees (or rather thrust in stakes, which in time all
grew to be trees) for some good distance before the
entrance into my apartment, they went on in the
same manner, and filled up the rest of that whole
space of ground, from the trees I had set, quite
down to the side of the creek, where, as I said,
I landed my floats, and even in the very ooze
where the tide flowed, not so much as leaving any
place to land, or any sign that there had been any
landing thereabout. These stakes also being of a
wood very forward to grow, as I have noted for-
merly, they took care to have generally very much
larger and taller than those which 1 had planted.
and placed them so very thick and close, that when
they had been three or four years grown, there
was no piercing with the eye any considerable way
into the plantation. As for that part which I had
planted, the trees were grown as thick as a man's
thigh ; and among them they placed so many other
short ones, and so thick, that, in a word, it stood
like a palisado, a quarter of a mile thick, and it
was next to impossible to penetrate it, but with
a little army, to cut it all down; for a little dog
could hardly get between the trees, they stood so
close.

But this was not all; for they did the same
by all the ground, to the right hand and to the
left, and round even to the top of the hill, leaving
no way, not so much as for themselves to come
out, but by the ladder placed up to the side of
the hill, and then lifted up, and placed again.
from the first stage up to the top, which ladder>>
when it was taken down, nothing but what had
wings or witchcraft to assist it could come at
them.

This was excellently well contrived: .nor was it
less than what they afterwards found occasion for,
which served to convince me, that as human pru-
dence has the authority of Providence to justify it,
so it has, doubtless, the direction of Providence to
set it to work; and, would we listen carefully to
the voice of it, I am fully persuaded we might
prevent many of the disasters which our lives are
now by our own negligence subjected to. But this
by the way.

I return to the story. They lived two years
after this in perfect retirement, and had no more
visits from the savages. They had, indeed, an
alarm given them one morning, which put them
into a great consternation; for some of the Spa-
niards being out early one morning, on the west
side, or rather end, of the island, which, by the
way, was that end where I never went, for fear
9' bfling discovered, they were surprised with see-
lng above twenty canoes of Indians, just coming
on shore.

They made the best of their way home, in hurry
enough; and, giving the alarm to their comrades,
they kept close all that day and the next, going
out only at night, to make observation. But
they had. the good luck to be .rnistaken; for
Wherever the savages went, they did not land at
that time in the island, but pursued some other
design.

And now they had another broil with the three
Iallglishmen, one of which, a most turbulent fellow,
being in a rage 'at one of the three slaves which
I mentioned they had taken, because the fellow
had not done something right which he bade him
d?>> and seemed a little untractalfle in his showing
him, drew a hatchet out of a frog belt, in which he
wore it by, his side, and fell upon the poor savage,
not to correct him, but to lrill him. One of the
Spaniards, who was by, seeing him give the fellow
a barbarous cut with the hatchet, which he aimed
at his head, but struck into his shoulder, so that
he thought he had cut the poor creature's arm off,
ran to him, and, enereating him not to murder the
poor man, clapped in between him and the savage,
to prevent the mischief.

- The fellow, being enraged the more at this, struck
at the Spaniard with his hatchet, and swore he
would serve him as he intended to serve the sa-
vage, which the Spaniard perceiving, avoided the
blow, and, with a shovel, which he had in his hand
(for they were working in the field, about their
corn land), knocked the brute down. Another of
the Englishmen, running at the same time to help
his comrade, knocked the Spaniard down; and
then two Spaniards more came to help their man.
and a third Englishman fell upon them. They
had none of them any fire-arms, or any other weao
pons, but hatchets and other tools, except this
third Englishman: he had one of my old rusty
cutiasses, with which he made at the last SpaniardS.
and wounded them both. This fray set the whole
family in an uproar, and more help coming in, they
met: the three Englishmen prisoners. The next
question Was, what should be done with them;
They had been so often mutinous, and were 60
furious, so desperate, and so idle withal, that they
knew not what course to take with them; for they
were mischievous to the highest degree, and valued

not what hurt they did to any man; so that, ill.

short, it was not safe to live with them.

The Spaniard who was governor told them in SO
many words, that if they had been his own coun-
trymen, he would have hanged them all; for all
laws, and all governors, were to preserve society;
and those who were dangerous to society out:ht
to be expelled out of it: but as they were Eflg'
lishmen, and that it was to the generous kindness
of an Englishman that they all owed their pf!"
servation and deliverance, he would use them with
all possible lenity, and would leave them to the
judgment of the two other Englishmen, who were
their countrymen.

One of the two honest Englishmen stood up, and
said, they desired it might not be left to them;
'For,' says he, ' I am sure we ought to sentence
them to the gallows.' And with that he gives an
account how William Atkins, one of the three, had
proposed to have all the five Englishmen join to~
gether, and murder all the Spaniards, when they
were in their sleep.
_ When the Spaniard governor heard this, he calls

to Will Atkins, ' How, seignior Atkins,' says he,
' would you murder us all? What have you to say
to that?' That hardened villain was so far from
- denying it, that he said it was true; and G<<d
d--n him, they would do it still before they had
done with them. ' Well, but seignior Atkins,' said
the Spaniard, ' what have we done to you that you
would kill us? and what would you get by killing
us? and what must we do to prevent your killing
us? Must we kill you, or you will kill us? Why
will you put us to the necessity of this, seig.
nror Atkins ! ' says the Spaniard very calmly, and
smiling.

.Seignior Atkins was in such a rage at the Spa-
mard's making a jest of it, that, had he not been
"if" by three men, and withal had no weapons
""u' him, it was thought he would have attempted
to have killed the Spaniard in the middle of all the
company,

.This hare-brained carriage obliged them to con-
sider seriously what was to be done. The two
Englishmen. and the Spaniard who saved the poor
savage, were of the opinion, that they should hang
one of the three for an example to the rest; and
that particularly it should be he that had twice
attempted. to commit murder with his hatchet;
and. indeed, there was some reason to believe he
had done it, for the poor savage was in such a mi-
serable condition with the wound he had received,
that it was thought he could not live.

But the governor Spaniard still said, No, it was
an Englishman that had saved all their lives, and
he would never consent to put an Englishman to
death, though he had murdered half of them: nay,
he said, if he had been killed himself by an English-
man, and had time left to speak, it should be, that
they would pardon him. -

This was so positively insisted on by the govero
nor Spaniard, that there was no gainsaying it: and
as merciful counsels are most apt to prevail where
they are so earnestly pressed, so they all came into
it; but then it was to be considered, what should
be done to keep them from doing the mischief they
designed, for all agreed, governor and all, that
means were to be used for preserving the society
from danger. After a long debate it was agreed,
first, that they should be disarmed, and not per-
mitted to have either gun, or powder, or shot, or
sword, or any weapon; and should be turned out
of the society, and left to live where they would.
and'how they could, by themselves: but that none
of the rest, either Spaniards or English, should con--
verse with them, Speak with them, or have any
thing to do with them; that they should be forbid
to come within a certain dista'nce of the place where
the rest dwelt; and that if they ofi'ercd to commit
any disorder, so as to spoil, burn, kill, or destroy
any of the corn, plantings, buildings, fences, or cat-
tle belonging to the society, that they should die
without mercy, and they should shoot them wher-
ever they could find them.

The governor, a man of great humanity, musing
upon the sentence, considered a little upon it, and.
turning to the two honest Englishmen, said, ' Hold.
you must reflect that it will be long ere they can
raise corn and cattle of their own, and they mil-fit
not starve: we must, therefore, allow them prow-
sions.' So he caused to be added, that they should
have a proportion of corn given them to last them
eight months, and for seed to sow, by which time
they might be supposed to raise some of their own;
that they should have six milch-goats, four lie-goats,
and six kids given them, as well for present sub-
sistence, as for a store; and that they should have
tools given them for their work'in the fields; such
as six hatchets, an axe, a saw, and the like: but
they should have none of these tools, or provisions,
unless they would swear solemnly, that they would
not hurt or injure any of the Spaniards with them,
or of their fellow Englishmen.

Thus they dismissed them the society, and turned
them out to shift for themselves. They went away
sullen and refractory, as neither contented to go
away nor to stay; but, as there was'no remedy,
they went pretending to go and choose a place
where they would settle themselves to plant and
live by themselves; and some provisions were
given them, but no weapons.

About four or five days after, they came again for
some victuals, and gave the governor an account
where they had pitched their tents, and marked
themselves out a habitation and plantation. It
was a very convenient place indeed, on the re-
motest part of the island, N. E. much about the
place where I providentially landed in my first
voyage, when I was driven out to sea, the Lord
knows whither, in my foolish attempt to surround
the island. .

Here they built themselves two handsome huts,
and contrived them in a manner like my first habi-
tation, being close under the side of a hill, hav-
ing some trees growing already on three sides of
It. so that by planting others, it would be very
easily covered from the sight, unless narrowly
searched for. They desired some dried goat-skins
for beds and covering, which were given them;
"Dd, Upon giving their words, that they would not

3 2
disturb the rest, or injure any of their plantations,
they gave them hatchets, and what other tools they
could spare, some pease, barley, and rice, for sow-
ing, and, in a word, any thing they wanted, but
arms and ammunition.

They lived in this separate condition about six
months, and had gotten in their first harvest,
though the quantity was but small, the parcel of
land they had planted being but little; for, indeed,
having all their plantation to form, they had a
great deal of work upon their hands: and when
they came to make boards, and pots, and such
things, they were quite out of their element, and
could make nothing of it; and when the rainy
season came on, for want of a cave in the earth,
they could not keep their grain dry, and it was in
great danger of spoiling. And this humbled them
much; so they came and begged the Spaniards to
help them, which they very readily did; and, in
four days, worked a great hole in the side of the
bill for them, big enough to secure their corn, and
other things, from the rain. But it was but a
poor place at best, compared to mine; and espe-
cially as mine was then, for the Spaniards had
greatly enlarged it, and made several new apart-
ments in it.

About three quarters of a year after this separav
tion, a new frolic took these rogues, which, toge-
ther with the former villany they had committed;
brought iniSchief enough upon them, and had very
near been the ruin of the whole colony. The three
new associates began, it seems, to be weary of the
laborious life. they led, and that without hope of
bettering their circumstances; and a whim took
them, that they would make a voyage to the con-
tinent, from whence the savages came. and would
try if they could not seize upon some prisoners
among the natives there, and bring them home, 5_0
as to make them do the laborious part of their
work for them.

" "a.
The project was not so preposterous, if they had
gone no farther; but they did nothing, and pro-
posed nothing, but had either mischief in the de-
sign or mischief in the event: and, if I may give
my Opinion, they seemed to be under a blast from
Heaven; for if we will not allow a visible curse to
pursue visible crimes, how shall we reconcile the
events of things with the Divine justice? It was
certainly an apparent vengeance on their crime of
mutiny and piracy, that brought them to the state
they were in; and as they showed not the least r'e-
morse for the crime, but. added new villanies to it,
such as. particularly, that piece of monstrous cru-
elty of wounding a poor slave, because he did not,
01' perhaps could not, understand to do what he was
directed; and to wound him in such a manner, as,
no question, made him a cripple all his life; and
in a place where no surgeon or medicine could be
had for his cure; and, what was still worse, the
murderous intent, or, to do justice to the crime,
the intentional murder, for such to be sure it was,
as was afterwards the formed design they all laid,
to murder the Spaniards in cold blood, and in their
sleep. '

But I leave observing, and return to the story.
The three fellows came down to the Spaniards one.
morning, and, in very humble terms, desired to be
admitted to speak with them. The Spaniards very
readily heard what they had to say, which was
this: that they were tired of living in the manner
they did; that they were not handy enough to
make the necessaries they wanted, and that, hav~
mg no help, they found they should be starved:
but if the Spaniards would give them leave to take'
0P8 0f the canoes which they came over in, and
give them arms and ammunition proportioned for
their defence, they would go over to the main, and
seek their fortune, and so deliver them from the

t'i'ouble of supplying them with any other provi~
sions. _
The Spaniards were glad enough to be rid of
them, but yet very honestly represented to them
the certain destruction they were running into; told
them, they had suffered such hardships upon that
very spot, that they could, without any spirit of
prophecy, tell them that they would be starved, or
murdered; and bade them consider of it.

The men replied audaciously, they should be
starved if they staid here, for they could not
work, and would not work; that they could but
be starved abroad; and if they were murdered,
there was an end of them, they had no wives nor
children to cry after them; and, in short, insisted
importunately upon their demand, declaring that
they would go, whether they would give them any
arms or no.

The Spaniards told them with great kindness,
that if they were resolved to go, they should not
go like naked men, and be in no condition to defend
themselves; and that, though they could ill spare
their fire-arms, having not enough for themselves,
yet they would let them have two muskets, a pistol,
and a cutlass, and each man a hatchet, which they
thought was sufficient for them.

In aword, they accepted the offer, and having
baked them bread enough to serve them a month,
and given them as much goat's flesh as they could
eat while it was sweet, and agreat basket full of
dried grapes, a pot full of fresh water, and a young
kid alive to kill, they boldly set out in a canoe for
a voyage over the sea, where it was at least forty
miles broad.

The boat was, indeed, a large one, and would
have very well carried fifteen or twenty men; and
therefore, was rather too big for them to manage:
but as they had a fair breeze, and the flood-tide
with them, they did well enough. They had made
a mast of a long pole, and a sail of four large goats'
skins dried, which they had sewed or laced toge-
ther; and away they went merrily enough. The-
Spaniards called after them, ' Bon veyajo ;' and no
man ever thought of seeing them any more.

The Spaniards would often say one to another,
and the two honest Englishmen who remained be-
hind, how quietly and comfortably they lived, now
those three turbulent fellows were gone. As for
their ever coming again, that was the remotest
thing from their thoughts that could be imagined;
when behold, after twenty-two days' absence, one
of the Englishmen being abroad upon his planting
work, sees three strange men coming towards him,
at a distance, two of them with guns upon their
shoulders.

Away runs the Englishman, as if he was be-
witched, and came frighted and amazed to the
governor Spaniard, and tells him they were all
undone; for there were strangers landed upon
the island, he could not tell who. The Spaniard,
pausing a while, says to him, ' How do you mean,
you cannot tell who? They are savages, to be
sure.' ' No, no,' says the Englishmen, ' they are
men in clothes, with arms.' ' Nay then,' says the
Spaniard, ' why are you concerned? if they are
not savages, they must be friends; for there is no
Christian nation upon earth but will do us good,
rather than harm.' .

While they were debating thus, came the three
Englishmen, and,standing without the wood, which
was new planted, hallooed to them. They pre-
sently knew their voices, and so all the wonder
Of that kind ceased. But now the admiration was
turned upon another question; viz. what could
be the matter, and what made them come back
again.

It was not long before they brought the men in,
and inquiring where they had been, and what they
had been doing, they gave them a full account of
their voyage in a few words; viz. that they reached
the land in two days, or something less; but, find-
"18 the people alarmed at their coming, and P'I'C'.'
paring with bows and arrows to fight them, they
durst not go on shore, but sailed on to the north-
ward, six or seven hours, till they came to a great
opening, by which they perceived that the land they
saw from our island was not the main, but an
island; that, entering that Opening of the sea, they
saw another island on the right hand, north, and
several more west: and, being resolved to land
somewhere, they put over to one of the islands
which lay west, and went boldly on shore; that
they found the people very courteous and friendly
to them, and they gave them several roots, and
some dried fish, and appeared very sociable; and
the women, as well as the men, were very forward
to supply them with any thing they could get: for
them to eat, and brought it to them a great way
upon their heads.

They continued here four days, and inquired as
well as they could of them, by signs what nations
were this way, and that way; and were told of
several fierce and terrible people, that lived almost
every way, who, as they made known by signs to
them, used to eat men; but as for themselves, they
said that they never eat men or women, except
only such as they took in the wars; and then
they owned that they made a great feast, and eat
their prisoners.

The Englishmen inquired, when they had a feast
of that kind, and they told them two moons ago.
pointing to the moon, and then to two lingers;
and that their great king had two hundred prison- _
ers now, which he had taken in his war ; and they
were feeding them to make them fat for the next
feast. The Englishmen seemed mighty desirous to
see those prisoners; but the others mistaking
them, thought they were desirous to have some of
them, to carry away for their own eating. So they
beckoned to them, pointing to the setting of the
sun, and then to the rising, which was to signify
that the next morning, at run rising, they would
bring some for them; and, accordingly, the next
morning, they brought down five women, and
eleven men; and gavathem to the Englishmen t9
carry with them on their voyage, just as we would
bring so many cows and oxen down to a sea-port
town to victual a ship.

As brutish and barbarous as these fellows were
at home, their stomachs turned at this sight, and
they did not know what to do: to refuse the pri-
soners, would have been the highest affront to
the savage gentry that offered them; and what to
do with them, they knew not. However, upon
some debate, they resolved to accept of them; and,
in return, they gave the savages that brought them,
one of their hatchets, an old key, a knife, and six
or seven of their bullets, which, though they did
not understand, they seemed extremely pleased
with: and then tying the poor creatures' hands
behind them, they (the people) dragged the prison-
ers into the boat for our men.

The Englishmen were obliged to come away as
soon as they had them, or else they that gave
them this noble present would certainly have .ex-
Pected that they should have gone to work with
them, have killed two or three of them the next
morning, and, perhaps, have'invited the donors
to dinner.

But, having taken their leave, with all the re-
3PcC/ts and thanks that could well pass between
People, where, on either side, they understood not
One word they could say, they put off with their
b0": and came back towards the first island, where,
when they arrived, they set eight of their prisoners
at liberty, there being too many of them for their
Occasion.

In their voyage they endeavoured to have some
communication with their prisoners. but it was im-
possible to make them understand any thing:
nothing they could say to them, or give them, 01'
'10 for them, but was looked upon as going about
to murder them. They first of all unbound them,
but the poor creatures screamed at that, especially
the women, as if they had just felt the knife at
their throats; for they immediately concluded they
were unbound on purpose to be killed.

If they gave them any thing to eat, it was the
same thing; then they concluded, it was for fear
they should sink in flesh, and so not be fat enough
to kill. If they looked at one of them more particu-
larly, the party presently concluded, it was to see
whether he or she was fattest and fittest to kill
first; nay, after they had brought them quite over,
and began to use them kindly, and treat them well.
still they expected every day to make a dinner or
supper for their new masters.

When the three wanderers had given this unac~
countable history, or journal, of their voyage, the
Spaniards asked them where their new family was;
and, being told that they had brought them on
shore, and put them into one of their huts, and
were come to beg some victuals for them, they (the
Spaniards) and the other two Englishmen, that is
to say, the whole colony, resolved to go all down to
the place, and see them, and did so, and Friday's
father with them.

When they came into the hut, there they sat all
bound; for when they had brought them on shorr,
they bound their hands, that they might not take
the boat, and make their escape: there, I say, they
sat, all of them stark naked. First, there were
three men, lusty, comely fellows, well shaped.
straight and fair limbs, about thirty to thirty-five
years of age; and five women, whereof two might
be from thirty to forty, two more, not above twcn'
ty-four or twenty-five, and the fifth, a tall, comely
maiden," about sixteen or seventeen. The women
were well-favoured, agreeable persons, both in
shape and features, only tawny; and two of them:
had they been perfect white, would have passed for
handsome women, even in London itself; having

1
very pleasant, agreeable countenances, and of a
very modest behaviour, especially when they came
afterwards to be clothed, and dressed, as they
called it, though that dresswas very indifferent, it
must he confessed: of which hereafter.

The sight, you may be Sure, was something un-
couth to our Spaniards, who were (to give them a
just character) men of the best behaviour, of the
most calm, sedate tempers, and perfect good-hu-
mour, that ever I met with; and, in particular, of
the most modesty, as will presently appear: I say,
the sight'was very uncouth, to see three naked men,
and five nakedwomen, all together bound, and in
the most miserable circumstances that human na-
ture could be supposed to be; viz. to be expecting
every moment to be dragged out, and have their
brains knocked out, and then to be eaten up, 'like
a calf that is killed for a dainty.

The first thing they did was to cause the old In-
dian, Friday's father, to go in, and see first if he
knew any of them; and then, if he understood any
of their speech. As soon as the old man came in,
he looked seriously at them, but knew none of
them: neither could any of them understand "a
word he said, or a sign he could make, except one
of the women.

However, this was enough to. answer the end,
which was to satisfy them, that the men into whose
hands they were fallen were Christians; that they
abhorred eating of men or women. and that they
might be sure they would not be killed. As soon
as they were assured of this, they discovered such
a Josh and by such awkward and several ways
33 is hard to describe; for it seems they were of
several nations.

. The woman, who was their interpreter, was bid,
In the next place, to ask them if they were willing
tdeg be Servants, and to work for the men who had
["0"ng them away to save their lives. At which
they all fell a dancing; and presently one fell to
taking up this, and another that, any thing that lay
' next, to carry on their shoulders, to intimate that
they were willing to work.

The governor, who found that the having women
among them would presently be attended with some
inconveniency, and might occasion some strife and
perhaps blood, asked the three men, what they in,
tended to do with these women, and how they in
tended to use them, whether as servants or as "'02
men. One of the Englishmen: answered very boldly
and readily, that they would use them as both. To
which the governor said, ' I am not going to re-
strain you from it; you are your own masters as
to that: but this I think is but just, for avoiding
disorders and quarrels among you, and I desire it
ofyou for that reason only, that you will all on-
gage, if any of you take any of these women as a
woman, or a wife, he shall take but one; and that,
having taken one, none else should touch her; for
though we cannot marry any of you, yet it is but
reasonable, that while you stay here,.the woman
any of you takes should be maintained by the man
that takes her, and should be his wife: I mean.'
says he, ' while he continues here, and that none
else should have any thing to do with her.' All
this appeared so just, that every one agreed toii
without any difficulty.

Then the Englishmen asked the Spaniards if they
designed to take any of them; but every one an-
swered ' No.' Some of them said, they had wives
in Spain, and the others did not like women that
were not Christians; and altogether declared, that
they would not touch one of them, which was an
instance of such virtue as I have not met with in
all my travels. On the other hand, to be short, the
live Englishmen took them every one a wife; that
is to say, a temporary wife: and so they set Up 3
new form ofliving: for the Spaniards and Friday,5
father, lived in my old habitation, which the?
had enlarged exceedingly within: the three 5cm
ants, which were taken in the late battle of the

savages, lived with them; and these carried on the

main part of the colony, supplying all the rest with _
food. and assisting them in any thing as they could,

or as they found necessity required.

But the wonder of this story was, how five such
refractory, ill-matched fellows should agree about
these women, and that two of them should not
pitch upon the same woman, especially seeing two
or three of them were, without comparison, more
agreeable than the others. But they took a good
way enough to prevent quarrelling among them.
selves; for they set the five women by themselves
in one of their huts, and they went all into the
other hut, and drew lots among them, who should
choose first. ,

He that drew to choose first, went away by him.
self to the but where the poor, naked creatures
were, and fetched out her he chose: and it was
worth observing, that he that chose first took her
that was reckoned the homeliest, and the oldest
0f the five, which made mirth enough among the.
rest; and even the Spaniards laughed at it. But
the fellow considered better than any of them, that
It was application and business that they were to
expect assistance in, as much as any thing else; and
She proved the best wife in the parcel.

When the poor women saw themselves set in a
row thus, and fetched out one by one, the terrors
0f their condition returned upon them again, and
a"? firmly believed, that they were now going to
be devoured. Accordingly, when the English sailor
came in, and fetched out one of them, the rest
59' up a most lamentable cry, and hung about her
and took their leave of her with such agonies,
and such affection, as would have grieved the hard~
est heart in the world; nor was it possible for the
Englishmen to satisfy them, that they were not to
be immediately murdered, till they fetched the old
man, Friday's father, who instantly let them know
that the five men, .who had fetched them out, one by
one, had chosen them for their wives.

When they had done this, and the fright the wo-
men were in was a little over, the men went to
work, and the Spaniards came and helped them';
and, in a few hours, they had built every one a new
hut, or tent, for their lodging apart: for those they
had already were crowded with their tools, house.
hold stuff, and provisions. The three wicked ones
had pitched farthest off, and the two honest ones
nearer, but both on the north shore of the island;
so they continued separate as before. And thus
my island was peopled in three places, and, as
I might say, three towns were begun to be planted.

And here it is very well worth observing, that, as
it often happens in the world (what the wise ends
of God's providence are in such a disposition of
things, I cannot say), the two honest fellows had
the two worst wives; and the three reprobates, that
were scarce worth hanging, that were fitfor nothing,
and neither seemed born to do themselves good nor
any one else, had three clever, diligent, careful,
and ingenious wives: not that the two first were
ill wives, as to their temper or humour, for all the
five were most willing, ' quiet, passive, and sub-
jected creatures, rather like slaves than wives; but
my meaning is, they were not alike capable, ingeo
nious, or industrious, or alike cleanly and neat.

Another observation I must make, to the honour
of a diligent application on one hand, and to the
disgrace ofa slothful, negligent, idle temper, on the
other: that when I came to the place, and viewed
the several improvements, plantings, and manage-
ment of the several little colonies; the two men
had so far outgone the three, that there was no
comparison. They had, indeed, both of them as
much ground laid out for corn as they wanted, and
the reason was, because, according to my rule, na-
ture dictated that it was to no purpose to sow more
com than they wanted; but the difference of the
cultivation, of the planting, of the fences, and, in.
deed, every thing else, was easy to be seen at first
view. -

The two men had innumerable young trees planted
about their huts, that when you came to the place,
nothing was to be seen but a wood; and though
they had twice had their plantation demolished, once
by their own countrymen, and once by the enemy,
as shall be shown in its place, yet they had re-
stored all again, and every thing was flourishing
and thriving about them: they had grapes planted
in Order, and managed like a vineyard, though they
had themselves never seen any thing of that kind ;
and by their good ordering their vines, their grapes
were as good again as any of'the others. They had
also found themselves out a retreat in the thickest
partof the woods, where, though there was not a na-
tural cave, as I had found, yet they made one with
incessant labour of their hands, and where, when
the mischief which followed happened, they se.
cured their wives and children, so as they could
never be found; they having, by sticking innume-
rable stakes and poles of the wood, which, as I said,
grew so easily, made. a grove impassable, except in
one place, where they climbed up to get over the
outside part; and then went in by ways of their
own leaving.

As to the three reprobates, as I justly call them,
though they were much civilized by their new settle-
ment, compared to what they were before, and
were not so quarrelsome, having not the same 0p-
POrtnnity; yet one of the certain companions of a
profligate mind never left them, and that was their
ldleness. It is true, they planted corn, and made
fantes ; but Solomon's words were never better veri-
tied than in them, ' 1 went by the vineyard of the
slothful, and it was all overgrown with thorns ;' for
when the Spaniards came to view their crop, they
could not see it in some places for weeds: the
hedge had several gaps in it,'where the wild goats
had gotten in, and eaten up the corn. Perhaps
here and there a dead bush was crammed in, to stop
them out for the present; but it was only ' shuts
ting the stable-door after the steed was stolen :'
whereas, when they looked on the colony of the
other two, there was the very face of industry and
success upon all they did ; there was not a weed to
be seen in all their corn, or a gap in any of their
hedges; and they, on the other hand, verified So-
lomon's words, in another place, ' The diligent
hand makes rich.' For every thing grew and thriv-
ed, and they had plenty within and without: they
had more tame cattle than the other, more utensils
and necessaries within doors, and yet more plea-
sure and diversibn too.

It is true, the wives of the three were very handy
and cleanly within doors; and, having learned
the English ways of dressing and cooking from
one of the other Englishmen, who, as I said, was a
cook's mato on board the ship, they dressed their
husband's victuals very nicely and well; whereas
the other could not be brought to understand it ;
but then the husband, who, as I said, had been
cook's mate, did it himself; but as for the husband:
of the three wives, they loitered about, fetched
turtle's eggs, and caught fish and birds; in a word.
any thing but labour: and they fared accordingly-
The diligent lived well and comfortably, and the
slothful lived hard and beggarly; and so, I believe)
generally speaking, it is all over the world.

But now I come to a scene different from all that
had happened before, either to them or to me ; and
the original of the story was this:

Early one morning there came on shore five or
six canoes of Indians, or savages, call them which
you please; and there is no room to doubt, that
they came upon the old errand of feeding updn
their slaves. But that part was now so familiar to
the Spaniards, and to our men too, that they did
not concern themselves about it, as I did; but
having been made sensible, by their experiences,
that their only business was to lie concealed, and
that, if they were not seen by any of the savages,
they would go off again quietly when their busi-
ness was done, having as yet not the least notion
of there being any inhabitants in the island; I say,
having been made sensible of this, they had nothing
to do but to give notice to all the three plantations
to keep within doors, and not show themselves,
only placing a scout in a proper place to give notice
when the boats went off to sea again.

This was without doubt very right; but a disaster
spoiled all these measures, and made it known
among the savages, that there were inhabitants
there, which was, in the end, the desolation of
almost the whole colony. After the canoes with
the savages were gone off, the Spaniards peeped
abroad again, and some of them had the curiosity
to 80 to the place where they had been, to see
what they had been doing. Here, to their great sur-
prise, they found three savages left behind, and
lying fast asleep upon the ground ; it was supposed
they had either been so gorged with their inhuman
feast, that, like beasts, they were asleep, and would
not stir when the others went, or they were wan-
(lered into the woods, and did not come back in
time to be taken in.

The Spaniards were greatly surprised at this sight,
and perfectly at a less what to do. The Spaniard
g0vernor, as it happened, was with them, and his
advice was asked; but he professed he knew not
Whatto do; as for slaves, they had enough already,
alfd as to killing them, they were none of them in-
clined to that. The Spaniard governor told me
they could not think of shedding innocent blood':
{01" as to them, the poor creatures had done no
"7deg38. invaded none of their property; and they
thWth they had no just quarrel against them, to
take away their lives.

And here I must, in justice to these Spaniards,
observe, that, let all the accounts of Spanish cruelty
in Mexico and Peru be what they will, I never met
with seventeen men, of any nation whatsoever, in
any foreign country, who were so universally mo-
dest, temperate, virtuous, so very good-liuiiioured,
and so courteous, as these Spaniards; and, as to
cruelty, they had nothing of it in their very nature;
no inhumanity, no barbarity, no outrageous paS'
sions, and yet all of them 'men of great courage
and spirit.

Their temper and calmness had appeared in their
bearing the unsufferable usage of the three English-
men; and their justice and humanity appeared now
in the case of the savages, as above. After some
consultation, they resolved upon this, that they
would lie still a while longer, till, if possible, these
three men might be gone; but then the governor
Spaniard recollected that the three savages had no
boat, and that, if they were left to rove about the
island, they would certainly discover that there
were inhabitants in it, and so they should be un'
done that way.

Upon this, they went back again, and there la)"
the fellows fast asleep still; so they resolved to
awaken them, and take them prisoners, and they
did so. The poor fellows were strangely fright?d
when they were seized upon and bound, and afraid;
like the women, that they should be murdered and
eaten; for, it seems, those people think all the
world do as they do, eating men's flesh ; but they
were soon made easy as to that, and away they
carried them.

It was very happy for them, that they did not
carry them home to their castle; I mean, to my
palace under the hill; but they carried them fit"
to the bower, where was the chief of their counll'll
work; such as the keeping the goats, the" planting
the corn, &c. and afterwards they carried them to
the habitation of the two Englishmen. -

Here they were set to work, though it was not
much they had for them to do; and,whether it was
by negligence in guarding them, or that they thought
the fellows could not mend themselves, Iknow not,
but one of them ran away, and, taking into the
woods, they could never hear of him more.

They had good reason to believe he got home
again soon after, in some other boats or canoes ot'
savages, who came on shore three or four weeks
afterwards, and who, carrying on their revels as
usual, went off again in two days' time. This
thought terrified them exceedingly; for they con-
cluded, and that not without good cause indeed,
that if this fellow got safe home among his com-
rades, he would certainly give them an account that
there were people in the island, as also how weak
and few they were; for this savage, as 1 observed
before, had never been told, and it was very happy he
had not, how many there were, or where they lived;
nor had he ever seen or heard the fire of any of
their guns, much less had they shown him any of
their other retired places, such as the cave in the
valley, or the new retreat which the two English-
men had made, and the like.

The first testimony they had that this fellow had
given intelligence of them, was, that about two
months after this, six canoes of savages, with about
{Seven or eight, or ten men in a canoe, came row-
"lg along the north side of the island, where they
never used to come before, and landed about an
h(fur after sun-rise, at a convenient place, about a
mile from the habitation of the two Englishmen,
where this escaped man had been kept. As the
Spaniard governor said, ' Had they been all there,
the damage would not have been so much, for not
{man of them would have escaped.' But the case
differed now very much; for two men to fifty, was
too much odds. The two men had the happiness
to discover them about a league off, so that it was
above an hour before they landed; and, as they
latitled about a mile from their huts, it was some

'1'
time before they could come at them. Now hav-
ing great mama to believe that they were betrayed,
the 'first thing they did was to bind the two slaves
which were left, and cause two of the three men
whom they brought with the women, who, it seems
proved very faithful to them, to lead them with
their two wives, and whatever they could carry
away'with them, to their retired place in the
woods, which I have spoken of above, and there to
bind the two fellows, hand and foot, till they heard
farther.

In the next place, seeing the savages were all
come on shore, and that they bent their course di-
rectly that Way, they opened the fences where the
milch-goats were kept, and drove them all out.
leaving their goats to Straggle into the wood whi'
ther they pleased, that the savages might think
they were all bred wild: but the rogue who came
with them was too cunning for that, and gave
them an account of it all; for they went directly to
the place.

When the two poor frighted men had secured
their wives and goods, they sent the other slave
they had of the three who came with the women.
and who was at their place by accident, away to
the Spaniards with all speed, to give them the
alarm, and desire speedy help; and, in the mean
time, they took their arms, and what ammunition
they had, and retreated towards the place in the
wood, where their wives were scn't, keeping at 3
distance, yet so that they might see, if possible>>
which way the savages took.

They had-not gone far, butvthat, from a rising
ground, they could see the little army of the"
enemies come on directly to their habitation, and:
in a moment more, could see all their huts and
household stufi' flaming up together, to their great
grief and mortification: for they had a very gl'ea'
loss, to them irretrievable, at least for some time-
They kept their station for a while, till they foul!d
the savages, like wild beasts, spread themselves all
over the place, rummaging every way and every'
place they could think of, in search for prey; and,
in particular, for the people, of whom it now plainly
appeared they had intelligence.

The two Englishmen, seeing this, thinking them'
selves not secure where they stood, because, as it
was likely some of the wild people might come that
way, so they might come too many together, thought
it proper to make another retreat, about half a mile
farther, believing, as it afterwards happened, that the
farther they strolled, the fewer would be together.

The next hall: was at the entrance into a very
thick-grown part of the woods, and where an old
trunk of a tree stood, which was hollow and vastly
large; and, in this tree, they both'took their stand-
ing, resolving to see there what might offer.

They had not stood there long, but two of the
savages appeared running directly that way, as if
they had already had notice where they stood, and
were coming up to attack them; and, a little way
farther, they spied three more coming after them,
and five more beyond them, all coming the same
way; besides which, they saw seven or eight more
at a distance, running another way; for, in a word,
they ran every way, like sportsmen beating for their
game. .

The poor men were now in great perplexity, whe-
ther they should stand and keep their posture, or
fly. But, after-a very short debate with themselves,
they considered, that if the savages ranged the coun.
try thus, before help came, they might, perhaps,
find out their retreat in the woods; and then all
Would be lost; so they resolved .to stand them
there; and if there were too many to deal with,
then they would get up to the top of the tree. from
Whence they doubted not to defend themselves, lire
excepted, as long as their ammunition lasted, though

all the savages that were landed, which were near
my, were to attack them.
Having resolved upon this, they next considered
whether they should fire at the first two, or wait
for the three, and so take the middle party; by
which the two, and the. five that followed, would
be separated. At length, they resolved to let the
first two pass by, unless they should spy them in
the tree, and come to attack them. The first two
savages also confirmed them in this resolution, by
turning a little from them towards another part of
the wood; but the three, and the five after them.
came forwards directly to the tree, as if they had
known the Englishmen were there.

Seeing them come so straight towards them,they
resolved to take them in a line as they came; and
as they resolved to fire but one at a time, perhaps
the first shot might hit them all three; to which
purpose, the man who was to lire, put three or four
bullets into his piece, and, having a fairloop hole, as
it were, from a broken hole in the tree, he took a
sure aim, without being seen, waiting till they were
within about thirty yards of the tree, so that he
could not miss. ,

While they were thus waiting, and the savages
came on, they plainly saw, that one of the three
was the run-away savage that had escaped from
them; and they both knew him distinctly, and re-
solved that, if possible, he should not escape;
though they should both fire; so the other stood
ready with his piece, that if he did not dr0p at the
first shot, he should be sure to have a second.

But the first was too good a marksman to miss his
aim: for, as the savages kept near one another, a
little behind in a line, in a word, he fired, and hit
two of them directly. The foremost was killed out-
right, heing shotin the head ; the second, which was
the run-away Indian, was shot through the body
and fell, but was not quite dead; and the third had
a little scratch in the shoulder, perhaps by the same
ball that went through the body of the second, and:
being dreadfully frighted, though not much hurt:

I
l
|
sat down upon the ground, screaming and yelling
in a hideous manner.

The five that were behind, more frighted with
the noise than sensible of their danger, stood still
at first; for the woods made the sound a thou-
sand times bigger than it really was: the echoes
rattling from one side to another, .and the fowls
rising from all parts, screaming and making, every
sort, a several kind of noise, according to their
kind, just as it was when I fired the first gun' that,
perhaps, was ever shot oflc in that place since it was
an island.

However, all being silent again, they not know-
ing what the matter was, came on- unconcern-
ed, till they came to that place where their com-
panions lay, in a condition miserable enough. And
here the poor. ignorant creatures, not sensible that
they were within reach of the same mischief, stood
all of a huddle over the wounded man, talking,
and, as may be supposed, inquiring of him how
he came to be hurt, and who, it is very rational to
believe, told them that a flash of fire first, and im-
mediately after that, thunder from their gods, had
lulled those two. and wounded him: this, I say, is
rational; for nothing is more certain than that, as
they saw no man near them, so they had never
heard a gun in their lives, or so much as heard of
agun, neither knew they any thing of killing or
wounding at a distance, with fire and bullets; if
they had, one might reasonably believe they would
"(ft have stood so unconcerned, in viewing the fate
of their fellows, without some apprehension of their
own.

pur two men, though, as they confessed to me, it
grieved them to be obliged to kill so many poor
creatures, who, at the same time, had no notion of
their danger; yet having them all thus in their
WW3", and the first having loaded his piece again,
YfSOIved to-let'fly both together among them; and,
"ngh'lg Wt; by agreement, which to aim at, they
shot together, and killed, or very much wounded:
four of them; the fifth, frighted even to death>>
though not hurt, fell with the rest: so- that our
men, seeing them all fall together,thought they had
killed them all; '

The belief that the savages were all killed, made
our two men come boldly out from the tree before
they had charged their guns again, which was a
wrong step; and they were under some surprise
when' they came to the place, and found no 10-55
than four of the men alive, and of them, two very
little hurt, and one not at all. This obliged them
to fall upon them with the stocks of their muskelS;
and, first, they made sure of the run-away savage.
that had been the cause of all the mischief, and of
another that was hurt in his knee, and put them
out of their pain. Then the man that was I!"
hurt at all came, and kneeled down to them, with
his two hands held up, and made piteous moans to
them, by gestures and signs, for his life; but coultl
not say one word to them that they could under-
stand.

However, they signed to him to sit down at the
foot of a tree there by; and one of the Englishmen;
with a piece of rope-twine, which he had, by grt'.at
chance, in his pocket, tied his feet fast together, and
his hands behind him, and there they left him 3 and.
with what speed they could, made after the othel'
two, which were gone before, fearing they, or any
more of them, should find the way to their 00'
vered place in the woods, where their wives, and
the few goods they had left, lay. They came 01"?
in sight of the two men, but it was at a great 61'
stance. However, they had the satisfaction to 39deg
them cross over a valley, towards the sea, the lime
contrary way from that which led to their retreat
which they were afraid of; and, being satisfied
with that, they went back to the tree where the)'
left their prisoner, who, as they supposed, was de-
livered by his comrades; for he was gone, and W
two pieces of rope-yarn, with which they had bound
him, lay just at the foot of the tree.

They were now in as great concern as before,
not knowing what course to take, or how near the
enemy might be. or in what numbers ; so they re-
solved to go away to the place where their wives
were, to see if all was well there, and to make them
easy, who were in fright enough to be sure; for
though the savages were their own country folk,
yet they were most terribly afraid of them, and
perhaps the more, for the knowledge they had of
them.

When they came thither, they found the savages
had been in the wood, and very near the place, but
had not found it; for, indeed, it was inaccessible, by
the trees standing so thick, as before,.unless the
persons seeking it 'had' been directed by those that
knew it, which these were not. They found, there-
fore, every thing very safe, only the women in a
terrible fright. While they were here, they had the
comfort of seven of the Spaniards coming to their
assistance; the other ten, with their servants, and
old Friday, I mean Friday's father, were gone in a
body to defend their bower, and the corn and cat-
tlethat were kept there, in case the savages should
have roved over to that side of the country; but
they did not spread so far. With the seiren Spa-
niards came one of the three savages, who, asIsaid,
were their prisoners formerly, and with them also
came the savage whom the Englishmen had left
baund hand and foot at the tree; for it seems they
came that way,saw the slaughter of the seven men,
and unbound the eighth, and brought him along with
them: where, however, they were obliged to bind
him again, as they had done the two others who
Were left when the third ran away.

The prisoners began now to be a burden to them ;
and they were so afraid of their escaping that they
tbought they were under an absolute necessity to
kill them for their own preservation. However, the
Spaniard gOvernor would not consent to it; but
ordered that they should be sent out of the way
to my old cave in the valley, and be kept there, with
two Spaniards to guard them, and give them food,
which was done; and they were bound there hand
and foot for that night. - '

When the Spaniards came, the two Englishmen
were so encouraged, that they could not satisfy
themselves to stay any longer there; but taking
- five of the Spaniards, and themselves, with four
muskets and a pistol among them, and two stout
quarter-staves, away they went in quest of the sa.
vages. And first, they came to the tree where the
men lay that had been killed: but it was easy to
see, that some more of the savages had been there;
for they had attempted to carry their dead men away,
and had dragged two of them a good way, but had
given it over. From thence they advanced to the
first rising ground, where they had stood, and seen
their camp destroyed, and where they had the map
tification still to see some of the smoke; but neither
could they here see any of the savages. They
then resolved, though with all possible caution,
to go forward towards their ruined plantation.
But a. little before they came thither, coming in
sight of the sea-shore, they saw plainly the savages
all embarking again in their canoes, in order to be
gone. .
They seemed sorry at first, that there was no way
to come at them, to give them a parting blow: but.
upon the whole, were very well satisfied to be rid
of them.

The poor Englishmen, being new twice ruined,
and all. their improvements destroyed, the rest all
agreed to come and help them to rebuild, and to
assist them with needful supplies. Their three
countrymen, who were not yet noted for having
the least inclination to any good, yet, as $00n
as they heard of it (for they, living remote east-
ward, knew nothing of the matter till all was over}
came and offered their help and assistance, and did .
very friendly work, for several days, to restore their
habitations, and make necessaries for them; and
thus, in a little time, they were set upon their legs
again.

About two days after this, they had the farther
satisfaction of seeing 'three of the savages' canoes
come driving on shore; and, at some distance from
them, with two drowned men, by which they had
reason to believe, that they had met with a storm at
sea, which had overset some of them: for it had
blown very hard the night after they went off.

However, as some might miscarry, so, on the
other hand, enough of them escaped to inform the
rest, as well of what they had done as of what had
happened to them; and to whet them on to another
enterprise of the same nature, which they, it seems,
resolved to attempt, with sufficient force to carry
all before them; for, except what the first men had
told them of inhabitants, they could say little to it
of their own knowledge: for they never saw one
man, and the fellow being killed that had afl'irm-
ed it, they had no other witness to confirm it to
them. ~
It was live or six months after this before they
heard any more of the savages, in which time our
men were in hopes that they had not forgot their
former bad luck, or had given over the hopes of
better; when, on a sudden, they were invaded with
a. most formidable fleet, of no less than twenty-
EIght canoes full of savages, armed with bows and
arrows, great clubs, wooden swords, and such like
engines of war; and they brought such numbers
with them, that, in short, it put all our people into
the utmost consternation.

As they came on shore in the evening, and at

_.deg easternmost side of the island,our men had that

nlght to consult and consider what to do ;_ and, in

the first place, knowing that their being entirely

COncealed was their only safety before, and would
T 2

th
much more be so now, when the number of their"
enemies was so great; they therefore resolved,
first of all, to take down the two huts which were
built for the Englishmen, and drive away their
goats to the old cave; because they supposed the
savages would go directly thither, as soon as it was
day, to play the old game over again, though they
did not now land within two leagues of it.

In the next place, they drove away all the flock
of goats they had at the old bower, as I called it,
which belonged to the Spaniards; and, in short,
left as little appearance of inhabitants any where as
possible; and the next morning early they posted
themselves, with all their force, at the plantation of
the two men, waiting for their coming. As they
guessed, so it happened: these new invaders, leav-
ing their canoes at the east end of the island, came
ranging along the shore directly towards the place,
to the number of two hundred and fifty, as near as
our men could judge. Our army was but small in-
deed; but that which was worse, they had not arms
for all their number neither. The whole account,
it seems, stood thus: first, as to men,

17 Spaniards.
5 Englishmen.
1 Old Friday, or Friday's father.
3 Slaves, taken with the women, who proved
very faithful.
3 Other slaves who lived with the Spaniards.

To arm these they had

11 Muskets.

5 Pistols.

3 Fowling-pieces

5 Muskets, or fowling-pieces, which were taken
by me from the mutinous seamen, whomI

reduced.

2 Swords.
3 Old halberts.
To their slaves they did not give either musket
or fusil, but they had every one a halbert, or a
long staff, like a quarter-staff, with a great spike of
iron fastened into each end of it, and by his side
a hatchet; also every one of our men had hatchets.
Two of the women could not be prevailed upon,
but they would come into the fight,- and they had
bows and arrows, which the Spaniards had taken
from the savages when the first action happened
which I have Spoken of, where the Indians fought
with one another; and the w0men had hatchets
too. _

The Spaniard governor, whom I have described
so often, commanded the whole; and William At-
kins. who, though a dreadful fellow for wickedness,
was a most daring, bold fellow, commanded under
him. The savages came ferward like lions, and
our men, which was the worst of their fate, had
no advantage in their situation; only that Will
Atkins, who now proved a most useful fellow, ,with
Six men, was planted just behind a small thicket of
bushes, as an advanced guard, with orders to let
the first of them pass by, and then fire into the mid-
dle of they; and, as soon as he had fired, to make
lns retrea as nimbly as he could, round a part of
the .wood, and so come in behind the Spaniards
Where they stood, having a thigket of trees all be-
fore them. ,

When the savages came on, they ran straggling
about every way in heaps, out of all manner of
order: and Will Atkins let about fifty of them pass
by_ him: then seeing the rest come on in a very
thick throng, he orders three of his men to fire,
having loaded their muskets with six or seven bul-
lets a piece, about as big as large pistol bullets.
HOW many they killed or wounded, they knew not;
but the consternation and surprise was inexpressi.
hie among the savages, who were frighted to the
"St. degree, to hear such a dreadful noise, and see
their men killed, and others hurt, but see nobody
that did it; when, in the middle of their fright,
William Atkins, and his other three, let fly again
among the thickest of them; and, in less than a
minute, the first three, being loaded again, gave
them a third volley.

Had William Atkins and his men retired imme-
diately, as soon as they had fired, as they were or-
dered to do ; or had'the rest of the body been at
hand,.to have poured in their shot continually, the
savages had been efl'ectually routed; for the terror
that'was among them came principally from this, _
viz. that they were killed by the gods with thunder
and lightning, and could see nobody that hurt
them; but William Atkins, staying to load again;
discovered the cheat. Some of the savages, who
were at a distance, spying them, came upon them
behind; and though Atkins and his men fired at
them also, two or three times, and killed above
twenty, retiring as fast as they could, yet they
wounded Atkins himself, and killed one of his fel-
low Englishmen with their arrows, as they did
afterwards one Spaniard, and one of the Indian
slaves who came with the women: this slave wasa
most gallant fellow, and fought most desperately.
killing five of them with. his own hand, having
no weapon but one of the armed staves and a
hatchet.

Our men being thus hard laid at, Atkins wound-
ed, and two other men killed, retreated to a rising
ground in the wood ; and the Spaniards, after firing
three volleys upon them, retreated also; for their
number was so great. and they were so desperate.
that though above fifty of them were killed, and
more than so many wounded, yet they came on in
the teeth of our men, fearless of danger, and shot
their arrows like a cloud; and' it was observed, that
their wounded men, who were not quite disabled,
were made-outrageous by their wounds, and fought
like madmen.

When our men retreated, they left the Spaniard
and the Englishman that were killed behind them;
and the savages, when they came up to them, kill-
ed them over again in a wretched manner, breaking '
their arms, legs, and heads, with their clubs and
wooden swords, like true savages. But finding our
men were gone, they did not seem to pursue them,
but drew themselves up in a kind of a ring, which
is, it seems, their custom; and shouted twice, in
token of their victory. After which, they had, the
mortification to see several of their wounded men
fall, dying with the. mere loss of blood.

The Spaniard governor having drawn his little
body up together upon a rising ground, Atkins,
though he was wounded, would have had him
march, and charge them altogether at once.
But- the Spaniard replied, ' Seignior Atkins, you
see how their wounded men fight: let them alone
till morning; all these wounded men will be stiff
and sore with their wounds, and faint with the
loss of blood, and so we shall have the fewer to
engage.'

The advice was good; but Will Atkins replied
'merrily, ' That's true, seignior, and so shall I too;
and that's the reason I would go on while I am
Warm.' ' Well, seignior Atkins,' says the Spa-
niard, ' you have behaved gallantly, and done your
part: we will fight for you, if you cannot come
0"; but 1 think it best to stay till morning.' So
they Waited.

But as it was a clear moomlight night, and they
found the savages in great disorder about their
dead and wounded men, and a great hurry and
noise among them where they lay, they afterwards
resolved to fall upon them in the night, especially
if they could come to give them but one volley be~ .
fore they were discovered. This they had a fair
f'l'Portunity to do; for one of the two Englishmen,
In whose ,quarter it was where the fight began, led
them round, between the woods and the sea-side,
Westward, and, turning short south, they came so
near where the thickest of them lay, that, before
they were seen or heard, eight of them fired in
among them, and did dreadful execution upon
them. In half a minute more, eight others fired
after them. pouring in their small shot in such a
quantity, that abundance were killed and wounded;
and. all this while they were not able to see who
hurt them, or which way to fly.

The Spaniards charged again with the utmost ex-
pedition, and then divided themselves into three
bodies, and resolved to fall in among them all to-
gether. They had in each body eight persons;
that is to say, twenty-four, whereof were twenty-
two men, and the two women, who,. by. the way,
fought desperately.

They divided the firearms equally in each party,
and so of the halberts and staves. They would
have had the women keep back; but they said, they
were resolved to die with their husbands. Having
thus formed their little army, they marched out
from among the trees, and came up to the teeth
of the enemy, shouting and hallooing as loud as
they could. The savages stood all together, but
were in the utmost confusion, hearing the noise of
our men shouting from three quarters together.
They would have fought, if they had seen us: and
as soon as we came near enough to be seen, some
arrows were shot, and poor old Friday was wound-
ed, though not dangerously. But our men gave
them no time; but, running up to them, fired
among them three ways, and then fell in with the
butt ends of their muskets, their swords, armed
staves, and hatehets; and laid about them so well,
that, in a word, they set up a dismal screaming and
howling, flying to save their lives which way soever
they could.

Our men were tired with the execution; and kill-
ed, or mortally wounded, in the two fights, about
one hundred and eighty of them; the rest, being
frighted out of their wits, scoured through the
Woods, and over the hills, with all the speed and
fear that nimble feet could help them to do; and
as our men did not trouble themselves much to
pursue them, they got all together to the sea-side
Where they landed, and where their canoes lay.
But their disaster was not at an end yet; for it
blew a terrible storm of wind that evening from the
sea-ward, so that it was impossible for them to put
off; nay, the storm continuing all night, when the
tide came up, their canoes were most of them driven
by the surge of the sea so high upon the shore, that,
it required infinite toil to get them off; and some
Of them were even dashed to pieces against the
beach, or against one another.

Our men, though glad of their victory, yet got
little rest that night; but having refreshed them-
selves as well as they could, they resolved to march
to that part of the island where the savages were
lied, and see what posture they were in. This ne-
cessarily led them over the place where the fight
had been, and where they found several of the poor
creatures not quite dead, and yet past recovering
life: a sight disagreeable enough to generous
minds; 'for a truly great man, though obliged by
the law of battle to destroy his enemy, takes no
delight in his misery.

However, there was no need to give any order in
this case, for their own savages, who were their
servants, dispatched those poor creatures with their
hatchets.

At length they came in ~view of the place where
the more miserable remains of the savages' army
Jay, where there-appeared about one hundred still:
their posture was generally sitting upon the ground,
With their knees up towards their mouth, and the
head put between the hands, leaning down upon
the knees.

When our men came within two musket-shot
0f them, the Spaniard governor ordered two mus-
kets to be fired, without ball, to alarm them: this
he did, that, by their countenance, he might know
what to expect; viz. whether they were still in
heart to fight, or were so heartily beaten, as to be
dispirited and discouraged, and so he might ma-
nage accordingly.

This stratagem took; for, as soon as the savages
heard the first gun, and saw the flash of the se.
cond, they started up upon their feet in the great-
est consternation imaginable: and, as our men -adc
\anced swiftly towards them, they all ran scream~
ing and yawling away, with a kind ofahowling
noise, which our men did not understand, and had
never heard before; and thus they ran up the hills
into the country.

At first, our men had much rather the weather
had been calm, and they had all gone away to sea;
but they did not then consider, that this might pro-
bably have been the occasion of their coming again
in such multitudes as not to be resisted, or at least
to come so many, and so often, as would quite dc-
solate the island, and starve them. Will Atkins,
therefore, who, notwithstanding his wound, kept
always with them, proved the best counsellor in
this case: his advice was, to take the advantage
that offered, and clap in between them and their
boats, and so deprive them of the capacity of ever
returning any more to plague the island.

They consulted long about this, and some were
against it, for fear of making the .wretches fly to
the woods, and live there desperate; and, so they
should have them to hunt like wild beasts, be afraid
to stir out about their business, and have their
plantations continually rifled, all their, tame goats
destroyed, and,.in short, be reduced to a life of
_ continual distress. .

Will Atkins told them they had better have to do
with one hundred men, than with one hundred na-
tions ; that as they, must destroy their boats, so they
must destroy the men, or be all of them destroycd
themselves. In a word, he showed them the 118'
eessity of it so plainly, that they all came into it;
so they went to work immediately with the boats,
and, getting some dry wood together from a dead
tree, they tried to set some of them on fire; but
they were so wet that they would not burn. 110w-
eyer, the fire so burned the upper part, that it soon
made them unfit for swimming in the sea as boats.
When the'lndians saw what they were about, some
of them came running out of the woods, and com-
ing as near as they could to our men, kneeled down
and cried, ' 0a! oa! waramokoa! ' and some other
Words of their language, which none of the others
understood any thing of; but as they made piti-
ful gestures, and strange noises, it was easy to
understand, they begged to have their boats spared,
and that they would be_ gone, and never come thi-
ther again. .

But our men were now satisfied that they had no
way to preserve themselves, or to save their colony,
but effectually to prevent any of these people from
ever going home again; depending upon this, that
if ever so much as one of them got back into their
country to tell the story, the colony was undone:
so that, letting them know that they should not
have any mercy, they fell to work with their canoes,
and destroyed them every one, that the storm had
n0t destroyed before. At the sight of which the
sWages raised a hideous cry in the woods, which
our people heard. plain enough; after which they
ran about the island like distracted men; so that,
"1 aword, our men did not really know at first
what to do with them.

Nor did the Spaniards, with all their prudence,
consider that while they made those people thus
desperate, they ought to have kept good guard at
flu} same time upon their plantations; for though
it is true, they had driven away their cattle, and
the Indians did not find out their main retreat, I
mean my old castle at the hill, nor the cave in the
""1193; yet they found out my plantation at the
bower, and pulled it all to pieces, and all the fences
and planting about it; trod all the corn under
foot; tore up the vines, and grapes being just then
almost ripe; and did our men an inestimable da.
mage, though to themselves not one farthing's
worth of service.

Though our men were able to fight them upon
all occasions, yet they were in no condition to pur-
sue them, or hunt them up and down; for as they
were too nimble of foot for our men, when they
found them single, so our men durst not go about
single, for fear of being surrounded with their num.
bers. The best was, they had no weapons; for
though they had bows, they had no arrows left,
nor any materials to make any, nor had they any
edged tool or weapon among them.

The extremity and distress they were reduced to
was great, and, indeed, deplorable; but, at the same
time, our men were also brought to veryhhard cirv
cumstances by them; for though their retreats were
preserved, yet their provision was destroyed, and
their harvest spoiled; and what to do, or which
way to turn themselves, they knew not. The only
refuge they had now, was, the stock of cattle they
had in the valley, by the cave, and some little corn
which grew there, and the plantation of the three
Englishmen, William Atkins and his comrades;
who were now reduced to two, one of them being
killed by an arrow, which struck him on the side
of his head, just under the temple, so that he never
Spoke more 3 and it was very remarkable, that this
was the same barbarous fellow who cut the p00!"
savage slave with his hatchet, and who afterwards
intended to- have murdered the Spaniards.

I looked upon their case to have been worse at
this time, than mine was at any time, after I firSI
discovered the grains of barley and rice, and got
into the method of planting and raising my corn}
and my tame cattle; for now they had, as I may
say, a hundred wolves upon the island,which would
devour every thing they could come at, yet 'could
be very hardly come at themselves.

The first thing they concluded, when they saw
what their circumstances were, was, that they
would, if possible, drive them up to the farther
part of the island, south-east, that if any more sa-
vages came on shore, they might not find one an-
other; then, that they would daily hunt and harass
them, and kill as many of them as they could
come at, till they had reduced their number; and
if they could at last tame them, and bring them
to any thing, they would give them corn, and
teach them how to plant and live upon their daily
labour.

In order to this, they so followed them, and so
terrified them with their guns, that, in a few days,
if any of them fired a gun at an Indian, if he did
not hit him, yet he would fall down for fear; and
so dreadfully frighted they were, that they kept out
of sight farther and farther, till at last our men
following them, and every day almost killing and
wounding some. of them, they kept up in the woods
and hollow places so much, that it reduced them
to the utmost misery for want of food ; and many
were afterwards found dead in the woods, without
any hurt, but merely starved to death.

When our men found this, it made their hearts re-
lent, and pity moved them; eSpecially the Spaniard
governor, who was the most gentlemanly, generous-
minded man that ever I met with in my life. And
he proposed, if possible, to take one of them alive,
and bring him to understand what they meant, so
far as to be able to act as interpreter, and to go
among them, and see if they might be brought to
some conditions, that might be depended upon to
Save their lives, and do us no spoil.

It was some time before any of them could be
taken; but being weak and half starved, one of
them was at last surprised, and made a prisoner.
He was sullen at first, and would neither eat nor
drink; but, finding himself kindly used, and vic-
tuals given him, and no violence offered him, he at
last grew tractable, and came to himself.

They brought old Friday to him, who talked often
with him, and told him how kind the others would
be to them all; that they would not only save
their lives, but would give them a part of the island
to live in, provided they would give satisfaction
that they would keep in their own bounds, and not
come beyond them to injure or prejudice others;
and that they should have corn given them, to plant
and make it grow for their bread, and some bread
given them for their present subsistence; and old
Friday bade the fellow go and talk with the rest of
his countrymen, and see what they said to it, as-
suring them, that if they did not agree immediately
they should all be destroyed.

The'poor wretches, thoroughly humbled, and re-
duced in number to about thirtyoseven, closed with
the proposal at the first offer, and begged to have
some food given them; upon which twelve Spa-
niards, and two Englishmen, well armed, and three
Indian slaves, and old Friday, marched to the place
where they were. The three Indian slaves carried
them a large quantity of bread, and some rice boiled
up to cakes, and dried in the sun, and three live
goats; and they were ordered to go to the side of
a hill, where they sat down, eat the provisions
very thankfully, and were the most faithful fellows
to their words that could be thought of; for, ex-
cept when they came to beg victuals and directions,
they never came out of their bounds; and there
they lived when I came to the island, and I went
to see them.

They had taught them both to plant corn, make
bread, breed tame goats, and milk them. They
wanted nothing but wives, and they soon would
have been a nation. They were confined to a neck
of land, surrounded with high rocks behind them.
and lying plain tmvards the sea before them, on
the south-east corner of the island. They had land
enough, and it was very good and fruitful; for
they had a piece of land about a mile and half
broad, and three or four miles in length.

Our men taught them to make wooden spades,
such as I made for myself; and gave them among
them twelve hatchets, and three or four knives;
and there they lived the most subjected, innocent
creatures that ever were heard of.

After this, the colony enjoyed a perfect tranquil-
lity with respect to the savages, till I came to re-
visit them, which was in about two years: not but
that now and then some canoes of savagescame on
shore for their triumphal unnatural feasts; but as
they were of several nations, and, perhaps, had
never heard of those that came before, or the rea-
son of it, they did not make any search or inquiry
after their countrymen; and if they had, it would
have been very hard for them to have found them
out.

Thus, I think, I have given a full account of all
that happened to them, to my return, at least, that
was worth notice. The Indians, or savages, were
wonderfully civilized by them, and they frequently
went among them; but forbid, on pain of death,
any of the Indians coming to them, because they
would not have their settlement betrayed again.

One thing was very remarkable, viz. that they
taught the savages to make wicker-work, or has.
kets: but they soon outdid their masters; for they
made abundance of mostingenious things in wicker-
work, particularly all sorts of baskets, sieves, bird-
Cages, cup-boards, &c. ; as also chairs to sit on,
stools, beds, couches, and abundance of other things,
being very ingenious at such work, when they were
once put in the way of it.

My coming was a particular relief to these people,
because we furnished them with knives, scissars,
Spades. shovels, pick-axes, and all things of that
kInd which they could want.
With the help of these tools they were so very
handy, that they came, at last, to build up their
huts, or houses, very handsomely; raddling, or
working it up, like basket-work, all the way round,
which was a very extraordinary piece of ingenuity,
and looked very odd; but was an exceeding good
fence, as well against heat, as against all sorts of
vermin: and our men were so taken with it, that
they got the wild savages to come and do the like
for them; so that when I came to see the two Eng-
lishmen's colonies, they looked, at a distance, as if
they lived all like bees in a hive; and as for Will
Atkins, who was now become a very industrious,
necessity, and sober fellow, he had made himself
such a tent of basket-work, as I believe was never
seen; it was one hundred and twenty paces round
the outside, as I measured by my steps; the walls,
were as close worked as a basket, in pannels, or
squares, thirty-two in number, and very strong,
standing about seven feet high. In the middle was
another, not above twenty-two paces round, but
built stronger, being eight-square in its form, and
in, the eight corners stood eight very strong posts.
round the top of which he laid strong pieces,joined
together with wooden pins, from which he raised a
pyramid for the roof, of eight rafters, very hand.
some, I assure you, and joined together very well;
though he had no nails, and only a few.iron spikes,
which he had made himself too, out of the old iron
that I had left there; and, indeed, this fellow
showed abundance of ingenuity in several things
which he had no knowledge of. He made himself
a forge, with a pair of wooden bellows to blow the
fire. He made himself charcoal for his work, and
he formed, out of one of the iron crows, a middling
good anvil, to hammer upon. In this manner he
made many things, but especially hooks, staples.
and spikes, bolts and hinges. But to return to the
house: after he had pitched the roof of his inner-
most tent, he worked it up between the rafters
with basket-work, so firm, and thatched that over
again so ingeniously with rice straw, and over that
a large leaf of a tree, which covered the top, that
his house was as 'dry as if it had been tiled or
slated. Indeed, he owned, that the savages made
the basket-work for him.

The outer circuit was covered, as a lean-to, all
round this inner apartment, and long- rafters lay
from the thirty-two angles to the top posts of the
inner house, being about twenty feet distant; so
that there was a space like a Walk, within the outer
Wicker-wall, and Without the inner, near twenty
feet wide.

The inner place he partitioned off withthe same
Wither-work, but much fairer, and divided it into
Six apartments, so that he had six rooms on a.
floor, and out of every one of these there was a
door; first, into the entry or coming into the main
'0'", and another door into the space, or walk, that
"'88 round it; so that this walk was also divided
into six equal parts, which served not only for
retreat, but to store up any necessaries which the
family had occasion for. These six Spaces not tak-
ing up the whole. circumference, what other apart-
ments the outer_circle had were thus ordered: as
50deg" as you were in at the door of the outer
"T010. you had a short passage straight before you
to the door of the inner house; but, on either side,
was a wicker partition, and a door in it, by- which
YOB went, first, into a large room, or storehouse,
t"Verity feet wide, and about thirty feet loug,._and
through that into another not quite so long; so
that in the outer circle were ten handsome rooms,
Six of which were only to be come at through the
al'artments of the inner tent, and served as.~closets,
91' retiring rooms, to the respective chambers of the
Inner circle; and four large warehouses, or barns,
Or what you please to call them, which went in
through one another, two on either hand of the
passage, that led through the outer door to the

inner tent.

Such a piece of basket-work, I believe, was never
seen in the world ; nor a house, or tent, so neatly
contrived, much less so built. In this great bee-hire

lived the three families; that is to say, Will Atkins, '

and his companion: the third was killed, but his
wife remained with three children, for she was. it
seems. big with child when he died: and the other
two were not at all backward to give the widow
her full share of every thing; I mean as to their
corn, milk, grapes, &c. and when they killed a kid.
or found a turtle on the shore; so they all lived
well enough, though it was true, they were not so
industrious as the other two, as has been observed
already.

One thing, however, cannot be omitted, viz. that
as for religion, I do not know that there was any
thing of that kind among them: they pretty often.
indeed, put one another in mind, that there was 8
God, by the very common method of seamen, viz.
swearing by his name. Nor were their poor, igne-
rant, savage wives, much the better for having been
married to Christians, as we must call them; for as
they knew very little of God themselves, so the?
were utterly incapable of entering into any (liSv
course with their wives about a God, or to talk any
thing to them concerning religion.

The utmost of all the improvement which I can
say the wives had made from them, was, that they
had taught them to speak English pretty well; and
all the children they had, which were near twenty
in all, were taught to speak English too, from their
first learning to speak, though they at first spoke it
in a very broken manner, like their mothers. There
were none of those children above six years' old
when I came thither; for it Was not much above
seven years that they had fetched these five savage
ladies over; but they had all been pretty fruitful.
for they had all children, more or less. I think the
cook's mate's wife was big of her sixth child; and
the mothers were all a good sort of well-governed,
quiet, laborious women, modest and decent, help-
ful to one another, mighty observant and subject to
their masters, I cannot call them husbands; and
wanted nothing but to be well instructed in the
Christian religion, and to be legally married, both
which were happily brought about afterwards by
my means, or,'at least, in consequence of my com.
ing among them.

Having thus given an account of the colony in
generaltand pretty much of my live runagate Eng.
lishmen, I must say something of the Spaniards,
who were the main body of the family, and in
whose story there are some incidents also remark-
able enouglr.

I had a great many discourses with them about
their circumstances, when they were among the sa-
"35'9-5. They told me readily, that they had no in-
stances to give of their application or ingenuity in
that country; that they were a poor, miserable, de-
Jected handful of people; that if means had been
Put into their hands, they had yet so abandoned
themselves to despair, and so sunk under the
weight of their misfortunes, that they thought of
nothing but starving. One of them, a grave and
""3 sensible man, told me, he was convinced they
were in the wrong; that it was not the part of wise
men to give. up themselves to their misery, but
always to take hold of the helps which reason offer-
ed. as wellfor present support as for future deli.
verance. He told me that grief was the most sense-
less, insignificant passion in the world: for that it
regarded only things past, which were generally im-
POssible to be recalled or to be remedied, but had
degdeg_ view to things to come, and had no share in any
""8 that looked like deliverance, but rather added
t0 the. affliction, than proposed a remedy: and,
"P011 this, he repeated a Spanish proverb, which,
though 1 cannot repeat in justthe same words that

U
he spoke it, yet I remember I made it into an
English proverb of my own thus:

In trouble to be troubled,
Is to have your trouble doubled.

He ran on. then, in remarks upon all the little
improvements I had made in my solitude; my un-
wearied application, as he called it; and how 1 had
made a condition, which, in its circumstances, was,
at first, much worse than theirs, a thousand times
more happy than theirs was, even now, when they
were all together. He told me, it was remarkable:
that Englishmen had a greater presence of mind in
their distress, than any peOple that ever he ml
with; that their unhappy nation, and the Portu-
guese, were the worst men in the world to strug'
gle with misfortunes; for that their first step in
dangers, after the common efforts are over, was
'always to despair, lie down under it and die, with-
out rousing their thoughts up to proper remedies

for escape.
I told him, their case and mine differed exceed

ingly; that they were cast upon the shore withoul
necessaries, without supply of food, or of present
sustenance, till they could provide it. That it is
true, I had this disadvantage and discomfort. that
I was alone; but then the supplies I had providen'
tially thrown into my hands, by the- unexpected
driving of'the ship on shore, was such a help 35
would have encouraged any creature in the world
to have applied himself as 1 had done. ' Scignion'
'says the Spaniard, ' had. we poor Spaniards been in
your case, we should never have gotten half those
things out of the ship as you did; nay,' says he,
' we should never have found means to have gone"
a raft to carry them, or to. have gotten a raft 0"
shore without boat or sail; and how much 195'
should we have done,' said he, ' if any of us had
been alonel' Well, I desired him to abate h15
compliment, and go on with the history of their
coming on shore, where they landed. He told me,
they unhappil y landed at a place where there were
peeple without provisions; whereas, had they had
the common sense to have put off to sea again, and
gone to another island a little farther, they had
found provisions, though without people; there
being an island that way, as they had been told
where there were provisions, though no people;
that is to say, that the Spaniards of Trinidad had
frequently been there, and had filled the island with
goats and hogs at several times, where they have
bred in such multitudes, and where turtle and sea
fowls were in such plenty, that they could have
been in no want of flesh, though they had found
no bread; whereas here they were only sustained
with a few roots and herbs, which they understood
"0t. and which had no substance in them, and
which the inhabitants gave them sparingly enough,
and who could treat them no better, unless they
would turn cannibals, and eat men's flesh, which
was the great dainty of their country. '

They gave me an account how many ways they
Strove to civilize the savages, they were with, and
to teach them rational customs in the ordinary way
0f living, but in vain; and how they retorted it
uPOn them, as unjust, that they who came thither
for assistance and support, should attempt to set
"for instructors of those that gave them bread;
intimating, it seems, that none should set up for the
instructors ,of others, but those who could live
without them.

They gave me dismal accounts of the extremities
the? were driven to; how Sometimes they were
many days without any food at all; the island they
Vere upon being inhabited by a sort of savages that
lll'ed more indolent, and, for that reason, were less
sul'Plicd with the necessaries of life than they had
reason to believe others were in the same part of
the world 3 and yet they found that these savages
were less ravenous and voracious, than those who
had better supplies of food. '

Also they added, that they could not but see
with what demonstrations of wisdom and goodness
the governing providence of God directs the events
of things in the world. which, they said, appeared
in their circumstances; for, if pressed by the hard-
ships they were under, and the barrenness of the.
country where they were, they had searched after
a better place to live in, they had then been out of
the way of the relief that happened to them by my
means.

Then they gave me an account how the savages.
whom they lived among, expected them to go out
with them into their wars. And it was true, that,
as they had fire-arms with them, had they not had
the disaster to lose their ammunition, they should
not have been serviceable only to their friends, but
have made themselves terrible both to friends and
enemies. But being without powder and shot, and
yet in a condition that they could not in reason
deny to go out with their landlords to thein wars;
when they came into the field of battle, they were
in a worse condition than the savages themselves;
for they had neither bows no'r arrows, nor could
they use those the savages gave them, so that they
could do nothing but stand still, and be wounded
with arrows, till they came up to the teeth of their
enemy; and then, indeed, the three halberts they
had were of use to them, and they would often
drive a whole little army before them, with thosO
halberts and sharpened sticks put into'the muzzles
of their muskets. But that, for all this, they were
sometimes surrounded with multitudes, and in
great danger from their arrows; till at last the!
found the way to make themselves large target!
of wood, which they covered with skins of wild
beasts, whose names they knew not, and these CO-
.vered them from the arrows of the savages; thifh
notwithstanding these, they were sometimes in
great danger, and were once five of them knocked
down together, with the clubs of the savages, which
was the time when one of them was taken prisoner,
that is to say, the Spaniard whom I had relieved:
that at first they thought he had been killed, but
when afterwards they heard he was taken prisoner,
they were under the greatest grief imaginable, and
.WOuld willingly have all ventured their lives to
have rescued him.

'They told me that when they were so knocked
down the rest of their company rescued them, and
stood over them, lighting till they were come to
themselves, all but he' who they thought had been
dead; and then they made their way, with their
lialberts and pieces, standing close together in a
line, through a body of above a thousand savages,
beating down all that came in their way, got the
victory over their enemies, but, to their great sor-
TOW. because it was with the loss of their friend,
whom the other party, finding him alive, carried off,
with some others, as I gave an account in the for-
mer part of my life.

They described most affectingly how they were
surprised with joy at the return of their friend
and companion in misery, who they thought had
been devoured by wild beasts of the worst kind,
Vlz. by wild men; and yet how more 'and more
they were surprised with the account he gave
them of his errand, and that there was a Christian
"1 any place near, much more one that was able,
and had humanity enough to contribute to their
deliverance.

They described how they were astonished at the
Eht of the relief! sent them, and at the appear-
ifllce of loaves of bread, things they had not seen
since their coming to that miserable place; how

they would have told me something of the joy they
were in, at the sight of a boat and pilots to carry
them away to the person and place, from whence
all these new comforts came; but they told me it
was impossible to express it by words; for their ex-
cessive joy naturally driving them to unbecoming
extravagances, they had no way to describe them,
but by telling me that they bordered upon lunacy,
having no way to give vent to their passion suitable
to the sense that was upon them; that in some it
worked one way, and in some another; and that
some of them, through a surprise of joy, would
burst out into tears; others behalf mad, and others
immediately faint. This discourse extremely affect-
ed me, and called to my mind Friday's ecstacy
' when he met his father, and the poor people's ec-
stacy when I took them up at sea, after their ship
was on fire; the master of the ship's joy, when he
found himself delivered in the place where he ex-
pected to perish; and my own joy, when, after
twenty-eight years' captivity, I found a good ship
ready to carry me to my own country. All these
things made me more sensible of the relation of
these poor men, and more affected with it.

Having thus given a view of the state of things,
as I found them, I must relate the heads of whatI
did for these people; and the condition in which I
left them. It was their opinion, and mine too, that
they would be troubled no more with the savages;
or that, if they were, they would be able to cut
them off, if they were twice as many as before: so
, that they had no concern about that. Then I en-
tered into a serious discourse with the Spaniard
whom I called governor, about their stay in the
island; for, as I was not come to carry any of them
olf, so it would not be just to carry ofl" some. and
leave others, who, perhaps, would be unwilling to
stay, if their strength was diminished.

On the other hand, I told them, I came to 05""
blish them there, not to remove them; and then I
let them know, that I had brought~ with me relief
of sundi y kinds for them; that I had been at a
great charge to supply them with all things neces-
sary, as well for their convenience, as their de-
fence; and that I had such and such particular
persons with me, as well to increase and recruit'
their number, as by the particular necessary emi-
pioyments which they 'were bred to, being arti-
ficers, to assist them in those things in which, at
present, they were to seek.

They were all together when I talked thus to
them, and before I delivered to' them the stores I
had brought, I asked them, one by one, if they had
entirely forgot and buried the first animosities that
had been among them, and would shake hands with
one another, and engage in a strict friendship and
union of interest, so that there might be no more
misunderstandings or jealousics. '

William Atkins, with abundance of frankness and
good-humour, said they had met with afllictions
enough to make them all sober, and enemies enough
to make them all friends; that, for his part, he
would live and die with them: and was so far from
designing any thing against the Spaniards, that, he _
owned, they had done' nothing to him but what his
own mad humour made necessary, and what he
\iould have done, and perhaps much worse, in
their case; and that he would ask them pardon, if
I desired it, for the foolish and brutish things he
had done. to them; and was very willing and de-
snous of living in terms of entire friendship and
union with them; and would do any thing that lay
"this power to convince them of it. And as for
80mg to England, he cared not if he did not go
thither these twenty years.

The Spaniards said they had, indeed, at first, dis-
armed and excluded William Atkins and his two
COuntrymen, for their ill conduct, as they had let
me know: and they all appealed to me, for the ne-
"935!!! they were under to do so. But that William
Atkins had behaved himself so bravely in the great
fight they had with the savages, and on several
occasions since, and had showed himself so faithful
to, and concerned for, the general interest of them
all, that they had forgotten all that was past, and
thought he merited as much to be trusted with
arms, and supplied with necessaries, as any of
them ; and that they had testified their satisfaction
in him, by committing the command to him, next
to the governor himself. And as they had an entire
confidence in him and all his countrymen, so they
acknowledged they had merited that confidence,
by all the methods that honest men could merit
to be valued and trusted. And they most heartily
embraced the occasion of giving me this assurance.
that they would never have any interest separate
from one another.

Upon these frank and open declarations of friend.
ship, we appointed the next day to dine all togco
thcr; and, indeed, we made a splendid feast. I
caused the ship's cook, and his mate, to come on
shore, and dress our dinner; and the old cook's
mate we had on shore assisted. We brought on
shore six pieces of good beef, and four pieces of
pork, out: of the ship's provision, with our punch-
bowl, and materials to fill it; and, in particular, I
gave them ten bottles of French'claret, and ten
bottles of English beer; things that neither the
Spaniards nor the Englishmen, had tasted for many
years; and which, it may be supposed, they were
exceedingly glad of.

The Spaniards added to our feast five whole kids.
which the cooks roasted; and three of them were
sent, covered up close, on board the ship, to the
seamen, that they might feast on fresh meat from
on shore, as we did with their salt meat from on
board.

After this feast, at which we were very innocently
merry, I brought out my cargo of goods, wherein.
that there might be no diSpute about dividing I
showed them there was sufficient for them all; and
desired that they might all take an equal quantity
of the, goods that were for wearing; that is to say,
equal when made up. At first, I distributed linen
sufficient to make every one of them four shirts;
and, at the Spaniards' request, afterwards made
them up six. These were exceeding comfortable
to them, having been what, as I may say, they
had long since forgot the use of, or what it was to
wear them.

Iallotted the thin English stuffs which 1 men-
tioned before, to make every one a light coat, like
a frock, which I judged fittest for the heat of the
season, cool and loose; and ordered, that, when-
ever they decayed, they should make more, as they
thought fit: the like for pumps, shoes, stockings,
hats, 85c. '

Icaunot express what pleasure, what satisfac-v
tion, sat upon the countenanccs of all these poor
men, when they saw the care I had taken of them,
and how well I had furnished them. They told-
me, I was a father to them, and that, having such
a correspondent as I was, in so remote a part of
the world, it would make them forget that they
were left in a desolate place. And they all volun-
tarily engaged to me, not to leave the place without
my consent.

Then I presented to them the people I had
brought with me, particularly the tailor, the smith,
and the two carpenters, all of them most necessary
People; but, above all, my general artificer, than
whom they could not name any thing that was
more useful to them. And the tailor, to show his
concern for them, went to work immediately, and,
with my leave, made them every one a shirt the
first thing he did; and, which was still more, he
taught the women not only how to sew and
Stitch and use the needle, but made them assist
to make'the shirts for their husbands, and for all
the rest.

U2
As to the carpenters, Lscarce need mention how
useful they were ; for they took in pieces all my
clumsy, unhandy things, and made them clever.
convenient tables, stools, bedsteads, cupboards,
lockers, shelves, and every thing they wanted of
that kind.

But, to let them see how nature made artificers
at first. I carried the carpenters to see William At-
kins's basket-house, as I called it; and they both
owned they never saw an instance of such natural
ingenuity before; nor any thing so regular, and so
handily built, at least of its kind. And one of
them, when he saw it, after musing a good while,
turning about to me, ' I am sure,' says he, ' that
man has no need of us: you need do nothing but
give him tools.'

Then I brought them out all my store of tools.
and gave every man a digging-spade, a shovel, and
a rake, for we had no harrows or ploughs; and to
every separate place a pick-axe, a crow, a broad
axe, and a saw, always appointing, that as often as
any were broken or worn out, they should be sup-
plied, without grudging, out of the general stores
that I left behind.

Nails, staples, hinges, hammers, chisels, knives.
scissars, and all sorts of tools and iron-work, they
had without tale, as they required; for no man
would care to take more than he wanted ; and
he must be a fool that would waste or spoil them:
on any account whatever. And, for the use of the
smith, I left two tons of unwrought iron for'3
supply.

My magazine of powder and arms, which I
brought them, was such, even to profusion, that
they could- not but rejoice at them; for now they
could march, as I used to do, with a musket upon
each shoulder, if there was occasion, and were able
to light a thousand savages, if they had but some
little advantages of situation, which also they could
not miss of if they had occasion. '
I carried on shore with me the young man, whose
mother was starved to death, and the maid also.
She was a sober, well educated, religious young
woman, and behaved so inoffensively, that every
one gave her a good word. She had, indeed, an
unhappy life with us, there being no woman in the
ship but herself; but she bore it with patience.
After a. while; seeing things so well ordered, and
in so fine a way of thriving, upon my island; and
considering that they had neither business nor ac-
quaintance in the East Indies, or reason for taking
So lung a voyage; I say, considering all this, both
of them came to me, and desired I would give
them leave to remain on the island, and be entered
among my family, as they called it.

I agreed to it readily; and they had a little plat
0f ground allotted to them, where they had three
tents, or houses, set up, surrounded with a basket
Work, palisadoed like Atkins's, and adjoining to his
plantation. Their tents were contrived so, that
they had each of them a room apart to lodge in,
and a middle ti-nt, like a great storehouse, to lay
all their goods in, and to eat and drink in. And
now the other two Englishmen removed their ha-
bitation to the same place; and so the island was
divided into three colonies, and no more; viz. the
Spaniards, with old Friday, and the first servants,
in my old habitation under the hill, which was, in
a word, the capital city, and where they had so en-
larged and extended their works, as well under, 'as
on the outside of the hill, that they lived, though
perfectly concealed, yet full at large. Never was
there such a little city in a wood, and so hid, I be-
lie", in any part of the world: for 1 verily be-
}iWG, a thousand men might have ranged the
Island a month, and, if they had not known there
was such a thing, and looked on purpose for .it,
they would not have found it: for the trees stood
so thick, and so close, and grew so fast matted into
one another, that nothing but cutting them down,
first, could discover the place; except the two nar-
row entrances, where they went in and out, could
be found, which was not very easy: one of them
was just down at the water's edge, on the side of
the creek, and it was afterwards above two hun-
dred yards to the place; and the' other was up the
ladder at twice,'as I have already formally de-
scribed it; and they had a large wood, thick plant-
ed also, on the top of the hill, which contained
above an acre, which grew space, and covered the
place from all discovery there, with only one naro
.row place between two trees, not easy to be dis
covered, to enter on that side.

The other colony was that of Will Atkins's, where
there were four families of Englishmen, I mean
those I had left there, with their wives and child.
rem; three savages, that were slaves; the widow
and children of the Englishman that was killed;
the young man and the maid, and, by the way, we
made a wife of her also, before we went away.
There were also the two carpenters and the tailor,
whom I brought with me for them; also the smith,
who was a very necessary man to them, especially
as a gunsmith, to take care of their arms; and my
other man, whom I called ' Jack of all trades,' who
was in himself, as good almost as twenty men; for
he was not only a very ingenious fellow, but a vet)r
merry fellow; and, before I went away, we married
him to the honest maid that came with the youth
in the ship I mentioned before.

And now I speak of marrying, it brings me na-
turally to say something of the French ecclesiastic
that I had brought with me out of the ship's crew,
whom I took up at sea. It is true, this man was a
Roman, and, perhaps, it may give ofl'ence to some
hereafter, if I leave any thing extraordinary upon
record of a mamwliomkbefore I begin, I must (to
set him out in just colours) represent in terms
-very much to his disadvantage, in the account Or
Protestants; as, first, that he .was a Papist; 58'
condly, a popish priest; and, thirdly, a French po-
pish priest.

But justice demands of me to give him a due
character: and I must say, he was a grave, sober,
pious, and most religious person; exact in his life,
extensive in his charity, and exemplary in almost
every thing he did. What, then, can any one say
against my being very, sensible of the value of such
a man, notwithstanding his profession; though it
may be my Opinion perhaps, as' well as the opi-
nion of others, who shall read this, that he was
mistaken.

The first hour that I began to converse with him,
after he had .agreed to go with me to the East
Indies, I found reason to delight exceedingly in
his conversation. And he first began with me
about religion, in the most obligiug manner ima-
ginable. - '

' Sir,' says he, ' you have not only, under God
(and at that he crossed his breast) saved my life,
but you have admitted me to go this voyage in your
ship; and, by your obligiug civility, have taken me
into your family, giving me an opportunity of free
conversation. Now, sir,' says he, ' you see by my
habit, what my profession is, and I guess, by your
nation, what yours is. I may think it is my duty,
and doubtless it is so, to use my utmost endea-
vours, on all occasions, to bring all the souls that I
can to the knowledge of the truth, and to embrace
the catholic doctrine; but, as 1 am here under
your permission, and in your family, I am bound, in
Justice to your kindness. as well as in decency and
PS00d manners, to be under your government; and,
therefore, I shall not, without your leave, enter
Into any debates on the points of religion, in which
we may not agree, farther than you shall give me'
leave.'

I told him his carriage was so modest, that I
could not'but acknowledge it; that it was true, we
were such people as they called heretics, but that
he was not the first Catholic that I had conversed
with, without falling into any inconveniences, or
carrying the questions to any height in debate;
that he should not find himself the worse used
for being of a different opinion from us; and if
we did not converse without any dislike on either
side upon that score, it would be his fault, not
Ours. ' .

He replied, that he thought all our conversation
might be easily separated from disputes; that it was
not his business to cap principles with every man he
discoursed with; and that he rather desired me to
converse with him as a gentleman, than as a reli-
gieux; that if I would give' him leave, at any time.
to 'discourse upon religious subjects,' he would
'readin comply with it; and that then he did not
doubt but 1 would allow him also to defend his
own opinions as well as he c0uld; but that,without
my leave, he would not break in upon me with any
such thing.

He told me farther, that he would not cease to
do all that; became him in his office as a priest, as
well as a private Christian, to procure the good of
the ship. and the safety of all that was in her; and
though, perhaps, we would not join with him, and
he could not pray with us, he hoped he might pray
for us, which he would do upon all occasions. In'
this manner we conversed; and, as he was of a
most; obliging gentlemanlike behaviour, so he was.
if I may be allowed to say so, a man of good sense,
and,. as I believe, of great learning.

He gave me a most diverting account of his life.
and of the many extraordinary events of it; of
the many adventures which had befallen him in the
few years that he had been abroad in the world.
and particularly this-was very remarkable ; viz. that
during the voyage he was now engaged in, he had
had the misfortune to be five times shipped and un.
shipped, and never to go to the place whither any
of the ships he was in was at first designed: that
his first intent was to have gone to Martinico, and
that he went on board a ship bound thither, at St.
Male; but being forced into Lisbon by bad weather,
the ship received some damage, by running aground
in the mouth of the river Tagus, and was obliged
to unload her cargo there; that finding a Portu-
guese ship there, bound to the Madeiras, and
ready to sail, and supposing he should easily meet
with a vessel there'bound to Martinico, he went
on board, in order to sail to the Madeiras; but the
master of the Portuguese ship, being but an indif~
ferent mariner, had been out in his reckoning, and
they drove to Phil, where, however, he happened
to find a very good market for his cargo, which was
com ; and, therefore, resolved not to go to the
Madeiras, but to load salt at the Isle of May, and
to go away to Newfoundland. He had no remedy
in this exigence, but to go with the ship, and had a
pretty good voyage as far as the Banks, so they call
the place where they catch the fish; where meeting
with a French ship, bound from France to Quebec,
in the river of Canada, and from thence to Marti-
nico, to carry provisions, he thought he should have
an opportunity to complete his first design: but
when he came to Quebec, the master of the ship.
died, and the ship, proceeded no farther. So the
next voyage he shipped himself for France, in the
ship that was burnt, when we took them up at
sea, and then shipped with us for the East Indies,
as I have already said. Thus he had been disap-
Pdeginted in five voyages, all, as I may call it, in one
voyage, besides what I shall have occasion to men-
tion farther of the same person. '

But I shall not make digressions into other men's
Stories, which have no relation to my own. I re-
turn to what concerns our affair in the island. He
came to me one morning, for he lodged among us
all the while we were upon the island ; and it hap-
meed to be just.when I was going to visit the Bug
lashmen's colony, at the farthest part of the island;
I say, he came to me, and told me, with a very
grave countenance, that he had, for two or three
days, desired an opportunity of some discourse with
me, which he hoped would not be displeasing to
me, because he thought it might, in some measure,
correspond with my general design, which was the
prosperity of my new colony, and, perhaps, might
put it, at least more than he yet thought it was, in
the way of God's blessing.

I looked a little surprised at the last part of his
discourse, and turning a little short, ' How, sir,'
said I, ' can it be said, that we are not in the
Way of God's blessing, after such visible assist.
ances, and wonderful deliverances, as we have seen
here, and of which I have given you a large ac-
count?' '
l ' If you had pleased, sir,' said he (with a world
of modesty, and yet with great readiness), ' to
have heard me, you would have found no room to
have been displeased, much less to think so hard
of me, thatI should suggest that you have not had
wonderful assistances and deliverances: and, I
hope, on your behalf, that you are in the way of
God's blessing, and your design is exceeding good;
and will prosPer. But, sir,' said he, ' though it
were more so than is even possible to you, yet
there may be some among you that are not equally
right in their actions: and you know that, in the
story of the children of Israel, one Achau, in the
camp, removed God's blessing from them, all"
turned his hand so against them, that thirty-six of
them, though not concerned in the crime, were the
objects of Divine vengeance, and bore the weight
of that punishment.' -

1, was sensibly touched with this discourse, and
told him his inference was so just, and the whole
design seemed so sincere, and was really so reli-
gious in its own nature, that I was very sorry I had
interrupted him, and begged him to go on: and,
in the mean time, because it seemed that what we"in

'R0 BINSON CRUSOE. 449

had both to say might take up some time, I told
him, I was going to the Englishmen's plantations,
and asked him to go with me, and we might dis-
course of it by the way. He told me, he would the
more willingly wait on me thither, because there
partly the thing was acted which he desired to
Speak to me about. So we walked on, and I press-
ed him to be free and plain with me in what he had
to say.

' Why then, sir,' says he, ' be pleased to give me
leave to lay down a few propositions, as the foun-
dation of what I have to say, that we may not difl
fer in the general principles, though we may he of
some differing opinions in the practice of particu-
lars. First, sir, though we differ in some of the
doctrinal articles of religion, and it is very un-
happy that it is so, especially in the case before us,
as 1 shall show afterwards; yet there are some
general principles in which we both agree; viz.
"fit, that there is a God, and that this God having

and obedience, we ought not willingly and know.
ingly to offend him, either by neglecting to do what
he has commanded, or by doing what he has ex-
Pressly forbidden. And let our different religions
be what they will, this general principle is readily
owned by us all ;' that the blessing of God does not
Ordinarily follow a presumptuous sinning against
his command; and every good Christian will be
affectionately concerned to prevent any, that are
under his care, living in a total neglect of God and
his commands. It is not your men being Protest-
allIS. whatever my opinion may be of such, that
dlscharges me from being concerned for their souls,
and from endeavouring, if it lies before me, that-
llley should live in as little distance from, and
tummy with, their Maker as possible; especially
1': you give me leave to meddle so far in your
crrcuit.' ,

1 could not yet imagine what be aimed at, and
told him I granted all he had said; and thanked
him that he would so far concern himself for us;
and begged he would explain the particulars of
what he had observed, that, like Joshua (to take his .
own parable), I might put away the accursed thing
from us.

' Why then, sir,' says he, ' I will take the liberty
you give me 3 and there are three things, which, if
Iam right, must stand in the way of God's bless.
ing upon your endeavours here, and which I should
rejoice, for your sake and their own, to see re-
moved. And, sir,' says he, ' I promise myself that
you will fully agree with me in them all, as soon
as I name them; especially because I shall con-
Vince you, that every one of them may, with great
ease, and very much to your satisfaction, be re.
medied.'

He gave me no leave to put in any more civili-
ties, but went on. ' First, sir,' says he, ' you have
here four Englishmen, who have fetched women'
from among the savages, and haVe taken them as
their wives, and have had many children by them
all, and yet are not married to them, after any
stated, legal manner, as the laws of God and man
'require; and therefore are yet, in the sense of
both, no less than adulterers, and living in adul-
tery. To this, sir,' says he, ' I know you will ob-
ject, that there was no clergyman, or priest of 803'
kind, or of any profession, to perform the cere-
mony: nor any pen and ink, or paper, to write-
down a contract of marriage, and have. signed it
between them. And I know also, sir, what thc
Spaniard governor has told you: I mean, of W
agreement that he obliged them to make, when
they took these women, viz. that they should
choose them out by consent, and keep separately W
them, which, by the way, is nothing of a marriage!
no agreement with the women as wives, but only

an agreement among themselves, to keep them
from quarrelling.
ROBINSON cnus'on. 4-51

' But, sir, the essence of the sacrament of matri-
mony (so he called it, being a Roman) consists not
only in the mutual consent of the parties to take
one another, as man and wife, but in the formal
and legal obligation that there is in the contract, to
compel the man and woman, at all times, to own and
acknowledge each other, obliging the men to abstain
from all other women, to engage in no other con-
tract while these subsist, and, on all occasions, as
ability allows, to provide honestly for them and
their children; and to oblige the women to the
same or like conditions, mutatis mutandis, on their
side. . . -

' Now, sir,' Says he, ' these'men may, when they
please, or when occasion presents, abandon these
women, disown their children, leave them to perish,
and take other women, and marry them whilst these
are living.' And here he added, with some warmth,
' How, sir, is God honoured in this unlawful liber-
ty? And how shall a blessing succeed your endea-
vours in this place, however good in themselves, and
however sincere in your design, while these men,
who. at present, are your subjects, under your ab-
solute government and dominion, are allowed by
you to live in open adultery?'

I confess I was struck at the thing itself, but
much more with the convincing arguments he sup-
ported it with; for it was certainly true, that
though they had no clergyman on the spot, yet a
fomal contract on both sides, made before wit-
nesses, and confirmed by any token which they
had all agreed to be-bound by, though it had been
but the breaking a stick between them, engaging
the men to own these women for their wives upon
all occasions, and never to abandon them or their
children, and the women to the same with their
husbands, had been an efl'cctual lawful marriage in
the sight of God; and it was a great neglect that
It was not done.

But I thought to have gotten off with my young

- priest, by telling him, that all that part was done
when I" was not here; and they had lived so many
years with them now, that, if it was an adultery,
it was past remedy; they could do nothing in it
now.

'Sir,' says he, ' asking your pardon for such free-
dom, you are xightin this, that it being done in
"your absence, you could not he charged with that
part of the crime. But I beseech you, flatter not
yourself that you are not therefore under an obli-
gatiou to do your utmost now to put an end. to
it. How can you think but that, let the time past
lie on whom it will, all the guilt, for the future, will
lie entirely upon you; because it is certainly in
your power now to put an end to it, and in nee
body's power but yours?'

I was so dull still, that I did not take him right;
but I imagined, that by putting an end to it, he
meant that I should part them, and not suli'er them
to live together any longer; and I said to him, I
could not do that by any means, for that it would
put the whole island in confusion. He seemed sur--
prised that I should so far mistake him. ' E0, sir,'
says he, ' I do not mean that you should separate
them, but legally and effectually marry them now.
And, sir, as my way of marrying them may not be
so easy to reconcile them to, though it will be as
effectual, even by youn own laws; so your way
may be as well before God, and as valid among '
men; I mean, by a written contract. signed by both
man and woman, and by all the witnesses p1 esent,
which all the-laws of Europe would decree to be
valid.'

I was amazed to see so much true piety, and so
much sincerity of zeal, besides the unusual impar-
tiality in his discourse, as to his own party or
church, and such a true warmth for the preserving
people that he had no knowledge of, or relation to;
I say, for preserving them from transgressing the
laws of God, the like of which I had, indeed, not
met with any where. But recollecting what he
had said of marrying them by a written contract,
which I knew would stand too; I returned it back
upon him, and told him I granted all that he had
said' to bejust, and, on his part, very kind; that I
would discourse with the men upon the point now,
when I came to them. And I knew no reason why
they should scruple to let him marry them all,
which I knew well enough would be granted to be
as authentic and valid in England, as if they were
married by one of our own clergymen. What was
afterwards done in this matter, I shall speak of by
itself.

Itheu pressed him to tell me, what was the se-
cond complaint which he had to make, acknowledg-
ing that I was very much his debtor for the first,
and thanked him heartily for it. He told me he
would use the same freedom and plainness in the
second, and hoped I would take it as well; and this
Was, that, notwithstanding these English subjects
of mine, as he called them, had lived with those
Women for almost seven years, and had taught
them to speak English, and even to read it; and
that they were, as he perceived, women of tolerable
understanding, and capable of instruction; yet
they had not to this hour taught them any thing
of the Christian religion, no, not so much as to
know that there was a God, or a worship, or in
what manner God was to be served, or that their
own idolatry, and worshipping they knew not whom,
Was false and absurd.

This, he said, was an unaccountable neglect, and

"What God would certainly call them to an account

f0T; and, perhaps, at last, take the work out of
their hands. 'He spoke this very affectionately and
warmly. ' I am-persuaded,' says he, ' had those
men lived in the savage country whence their wives
came, the savages would have taken more pains to
have brought them to be idolaters, and to worship
the devil, than any of these men, so far as I can
see, has talcen'with them, to teach them the know-
ledge of the true God. Now, sir,' said he, ' though
I do not acknowledge your religion, or you mine,
yet we should be all glad to see the devil's serv-
ants, and the subjects of his kingdom, taught to
know the general principles of the Christian reli-
gion, that they might, at least, hear of God, and of
a Redeemer, and of the resurrection, and of a fu.
ture state, things which we all believe; they had,
at least, been so much nearer coming into the be
som of the true church than they are now, in the
public profession ofidolatry and devil worship.'

I could hold no longer; I took him in my arms,
and embraced him with an excess of passion. ' How
far,' said I to him, 'have I been from understanding
the most essential part of a Christian, viz. to love
the interest of the Christian church, and the good
of other men's souls? I scarce have known what
belongs to being a Christian.' ' Oh, sir, do not say
so!' replied he: ' this thing is not your fault.'
' No,' said I; ' but why did.I never lay it to heart
as well as you?' ' 'Tis not too late yet,' said he:
' be not too forward to condemn yourself.' ' But
what can be done now?' said I. ' You see I am
going away.' ' Will you give me leave,' said he,
' to talk with these poor men about it?' 'Yes,
with all my heart,' said 1; ' and will oblige them
to give heed to what you say too.' ' As to that,'
said he, ' we must leave them to the mercy of
Christ; but it is our business to assist them, en-
courage them, and instruct them; and, if you will
give me leave, and God his blessing, I do not
doubt but the poor, ignorant souls shall be brought
home into the great circle of Christianity, into
\the particular faith that we all embrace; and
that even while you stay here.' Upon this, I said:
' 1 shall not only give you leave, but give you 8
thousand thanks for it.' What followed on this ac
count, I shall mention also again in its place. .

I now pressed him for the third article in which
 

ROBINSON CRUSOE. ' 455

we were to blame. ' Why, really,' says he, 'it is of
the same nature; and I will proceed (asking your
leave) with the same plainness as before. It is
about your poor savages yonder, who are (as I may
say) your conquered subjects. It is a maxim, sir,
that is, or ought to be, received among all Chris-
tians, of what church, or pretended church, soever,
viz. that Christian knowledge ought to be propa-
gated by all possible means', and on all possible oc~
casions. It is on this principle that our church
sends missionaries into Persia, India, and China;
and that our clergy, even of the superior sort, will-
ingly engage in the most hazardous voyages, and
the most dangerous residence among murderers and
barbarians, to teach them the knowledge of the
true God, and to bring them over to embrace the
Christian faith. Now, sir, you have such an oppor-
tunity here, to have six or seven and thirty poor
savages brought over from idolatry to the knowledge
Of God, their Maker and Redeemer, that I wonder
h0W you can pass such an occasion of doing good ;
lthich is really worth the expense of a man's whole
ie.'

I was now struck dumb indeed, and had not one
word to say. I had here a spirit of true Christian
zeal for God and religion before me, let his particu-
lar principles be of what kind soever. As for me,
.I had not so much as entertained a thought of this
"I my heart before; and, I believe I should not
have thought of it; for I looked upon these savages
as slaves, and people whom, had we had any work for
them to do, we would have used as such, or would
have been glad to have transported them to any
other part of the world ; for our business was to
get rid of them: and we would all have been satis-
fied if they had been sent to any country, so they
had never seen their own. But to the case; I say,
I Was confounded at his discourse, and knew not
what answer to make him. He looked earnestly at
me, and seeing me in some disorder, ' Sir,' said he,
' I shall be very sorry, if what I have said gives you
any offence.' ' No, no,' said I ; ' I am offended
' with nobody but myself; but I am perfectly con-
founded, not only to think that I should never take
~ any notice of this before, but with reflecting what
notice'I am able to take of it now. You know,
sir,' said I, ' what circumstances I am in? I am
bound to the East Indies, in a ship freighted by
merchants, and .to whom it would be an insuffer-
able piece of injustice to detain the ship here, the
men lying all this while at victuals and wages upon
the-owners' account. It is true, I agreed to be al-
_ lowed twelve days here. and if I stay more, I must
pay three pounds sterling per dicm, demurragc. Nor
can I stay upon demurrage above eight days more;
and I have been here thirteen days already: so that
I am perfectly unable to engage in this work, unless
I would suffer myself to be left behind here again.
in which case, if this single ship should miscarry
in any part of her voyage, I should be just in the
same condition that I was left in here at first;
and from which I have been so wonderfully d8-
livered.' '

.He owned the case was very hard upon me, as to
my voyage; but laid it home upon my conscience.
whether the blessing of saving seven and thirty
souls was not worth my venturing all I had in the
world for. I was not so sensible of that as he was
and I returned upon him thus: ' Why, sir, itis a'
valuable thing indeed- to be an instrument iii-God's
hand, to convert seven and thirty heathens to the
knowledge of Christ. But as you are an eccle
siastic, and 'are given over to that work, so that
it seems naturally to fall into the way of your pm
fession; how is it then, that you do not rather ofTfl'
yourself to undertake it, than press me to it?'

Upon this he faced about, just before me, as "'8
Walked along, and putting me to a full stop, made
me a very low bow. ' I most heartily thank God,
and you, sir,' says he, ' for giving me so evident3
call to so blessed a work; and if you think your-
self discharged from it, and desire me to under-
take it, I will most readily do it, and think it a
happy reward for all the hazards and difficulties
of such a broken, disappointed voyage as I have
met with, that I have dropped at last into so glo-
rious a work.'

I discovered a kind of rapture in his face, while
he spoke this to me; his eyes sparkled like fire,
his face glowed, and his colour came and went, as
if he had been falling into fits: in a word, he was
fired with the joy of being embarked in such a
work. I paused a considerable while, before I
could tell what to say to him ; for I was really sur-
prised to find a man of such sincerity and zeal, and
carried out in his zeal, beyond the ordinary rate of
men, not of his profession only, but even of any
profession whatsoever. But, after I had considered
it a while, I asked him seriously if he was in ear-
nest, and that he would venture on the single con-
Sideration of an attempt on those poor people to
be locked up in an unplanted island for, perhaps,
his life; and at last might not know whether he
Should be able to do them any good, or not?

He turned short upon me, and asked me, what
I called a venture. ' Pray, sir,' said he, ' what do
you think I consented to go in your ship to the
East Indies for i ' ' Nay,' said I, ' that I know not,
unless it was to preach to the Indians.' ' Doubt-
less it was,' said he; ' and do you think, if I can
convert these seven-aud-thirty men to the faith of
Christ. it is not worth my time, though I should
never be fetched off the island again? Nay, is it
not infinitely of more worth to save so many souls,
than my life is, or the life of twenty more of the
same profession? Yes, sir,' said he, ' I would give
Phrist and the blessed Virgin thanks all my days,
If I could be made the least happy instrument of
saving the souls of these poor men, though I was
never to set my foot off this island, or see my. use

X
tive country any more. But since you will honour
me,' said he, ' with putting me into this work (for
which I will pray for you all the days of my life),
I have one humble petition to you,' said he, ' be-
sides.' ' What is that?' said I. ' Why,' said he,
' it is, that you will leave your man Friday with
me, to be my interpreter to them, and to assist me;
for without some help, I cannot speak to them, or
they to me.'

I was sensibly troubled at his requesting Friday:
because I could net think of parting with him, and
that for many reasons. He had been the companion
of my travels; he was not only faithful to me, but ,
sincerely affectionate to the last degree ; and i had
resolved to do something considerable for him, if he
outlived me, as it was probable he would. Thenl
knew that as I had bred Friday up to be a Protest-
ant, it would quite confound him to bring him to
embrace another profession; and he would never.
while his eyes were open, believe that his old ma-
ster was a heretic, and would be damned; and
this might, in the end, ruin the poor fellows prin-
ciples, and so turn him back again to his first
idolatry. '

However, a sudden thought relieved me in this
strait, and it was this: I told him I could notsal'
that I was willing to part with Friday on a"!
account whatever: though a work that to him was
of more value than his life, ought to be to me
of much more value than the keeping or parting
with a servant: but, on the other hand, I was per'
suaded that Friday would by no means consent to
part with me ; and then to force him to it, without
his consent, would be manifest injustice: becauseI
had promised I would never put him away; and he
had promised and engaged to me, that he would
never leave me, unless I put him away.

He seemed very much concerned at it, for he had
no rational access to these poor people, seeing I"
did not understand one word of their language: not
they one word of his. To remove this difficulty,
I told him Friday's father had learned Spanish,
which I found he also understood, and he should
serve him for an interpreter: so he was much
better satisfied, and nothing could persuade him,
but he would stay to endeavour to convert them:
but Providence gave another and very happy turn
to all this.

I come back now to the first part of his objec-
tions. When we came to the Englishmen, I sent
for them all together; and after some account
given them of what I had done for them, viz. what
necessary things I had provided for them, and how
they were distributed, which they were sensible of,
and very thankful for: I began to talk to them of

. the scandalous life they led, and gave them a full
account of the notice the clergyman had already
taken of it: and, arguing how unchristian and irre-
ligious a life it was, I first asked them, if they were
married men or bachelors. They soon explained
their condition to me, and showed me that two of
them were widowers, and the other three were
single men, or bachelors. I asked them with what
conscience they could take these women, and lie

. with them, as they had done, call them their wives,
and have so many children by them, and not be
married lawfully to them.

They all gave me the answer that I expected;
viz. that there was nobody to marry them; that
they agreed before the governor to take them as
their wives, and to keep them, and own them as
their wives; and they thought, as things stood
With them, they were as legally married, as if they
had been married by a parson, and with all the for-
malities in the world.

I told them that no doubt they were married in
the sight of God, and were bound in conscience to
keep them as their wives; but that the laws of men
being otherwise, they might pretend they were
not married, and so desert the poor women and
children hereafter; and that their wives, being poor
desolate women, friendless and 'moneyless, would
have no way to help themselves. I, therefore, told
them, that unless I was assured of their honest in-
tent, I could do nothing for them, but would take
care that what I did should be for the women and
children without them ; and that unless they
would give some assurances that they would marry
the women, I could not think it was convenient
they should continue together as man and wife;
for that it was both scandalous to- men, and offen-.
sive to; God, who they could not think would. bless
them, if they went on thus.

All this went on as I expected: and they told me,
especially Will Atkins, who seemed now to speak
for the rest, that they loved their wives as well as
if they had been born in their own native country:
and would not leave them upon any accountwhat-
ever; and they did verily believe their wives were
as virtuous, and as modest, and did, to the utmost
of their skill, as much for them and for their child-
ren, as any women could possibly do; and they
would not part with them on any account. And
William Atkins, for his own particular, added, if
any man would take him away, and offer to can!
him home to England, and make him captain of the
best man of war in the navy, he would not go with
him, if he might not carry his wife and children
with him; and if there was a clergyman in the
ship, he would be married to her now, with all his
heart.

This was just as I would have it. The priest was
ml: with me at that moment, but was not far all"
so to try him farther, I told him I had a clergymall
with me, and, if he was sincere, I would have him
married the next morning; and bade him considef
of it, and talk with the rest. He said, as for himsel'v
he need not consider of it at all; for he was ":0"
ready to do it, and was glad I had a minister with
me; and he believed they would 'be all willing 315"
I then told him that my friend, the minister. was a
Frenchman, and could not speak English; but that
I would act the clerk between them. He never so
much as asked me whether he was a Papist or Pro-
testant, which was, indeed, what I was afraid of ;
but I say, they never inquired about it. So we
parted. I went back to my clergyman; and Will
Atkins went in to talk with his companions. I de-
sired the French gentleman not to say any thing to
them, till the business was thorough ripe; and I
told him what answer the men had given me.

Before I went from their quarter, they all came
to me, and told me, they had been considering
what I had said; that they were very glad to hear
I had a clergyman in my company, and they were
very willing to give me the satisfaction I desired,
and to be formally married as soon as I pleased, for
they were far from desiring to part from their
wives, and that they meant nothing but what was
very honest when they chose them. So I appoint-
ed them to meet me the next morning, and that, in
the mean time, they should let their wives know
the meaning of the marriage law, and that it was
flat only to prevent any scandal, but also to oblige
them that they should not forsake them, whatever
might happen.

The women were easily made sensible of the
meaning of the thing, and were very well satisfied
with it, as indeed they had reason to be; so they
failed not to attend all together, at my apartment,
the next morning, where I brought out my clergy-
man: and though he had not on a minister's gown,
after the manner of England, or the habit of a priest,
after the manner of France: yet having a black vest,
Something like a cassock, with a sash round it, he
did not look very unlike a minister; and as for his
language, I was interpreter.

But the seriousness of his behaviour to them, and
the scruples he made of marrying the women, be-
cause they were not baptised, and professed Chris-
tians, gave them an exceeding reverence for his
person; and there was no need after that to inquire
whether he was a clergyman or no.

Indeed, I was afraid his scruple would have been
carried so far, as that he would not have married
them at all; nay, notwithstanding all I was able to
say to him, he resisted me, though modestly, yet
very steadily; and, at last, refused absolutely to
marry them, unless he had first talked with the
men, and the women too: and though, at first,[
Was alittle backward to it, yet, at last, I agreed to
it with a good will, perceiving the sincerity of his
design. -

When he came to them, he let them know that I
had acquainted him with their circumstances, and
with the present design: that he was very willing to
perform that part of his function, and marry them,
as I had desired , but that, before he could do it, he
must take the liberty to talk with them. He told
them that in the sight of all indifferent men, and in
the sense of the laws of society, they had lived all
this while in an open adultery; and that it was
true, that nothing but the consenting to marry, or
effectually separating them from one another now,
could put an end to it; but there was a diliiculty in
it too, with respect to the laws of Christian matri-
mony, which 'he was not fully satisfied about, viz.
that of marrying one that is a professed Christian;
to a savage, an idolater, and a heathen, one that is
not baptized; and yet that he did not see that
there was time left for it, to endeavour to pal"
suade the women to be baptized, or to profess the
name of Christ, whom they had, he doubted, heard
nothing of, and without which they could not be
baptized.

He told them he doubted they were biltindilferent
Christians themselves, that they had but little
knowledge of God, or of his ways; and therefore he
could not expect that they had said much to their
wives on that head yet; but that unless they would
promise him to use their endeavours with their
wives, to persuade them to become Christians, and
would, as well as they could, instruct them in the

knowledge and belief of God that made them, and

to worship Jesus Christ that redeemed them, he

'could not marry them ; for he would have no hand

in joining Christians with savages; nor was it
consistent with the principles of the Christian reli-
plea, and was, indeed, expressly forbidden in God's
aw.

They heard all this very attentively; and I deli-
vered it very faithfully to them, from his mouth, as
near his own words as I could, only sometimes add-
ing something of my own, to convince them how
just it was, and how I was of his mind: and I.
alvrrays very faithfully distinguished _between what
I said from myself, and what were the clergymen's
Words. They told me, it was very true what the
gentleman had said, that they were but very indif-
ferent Christians themselves, and that they had
never talked to their wives about religion. ' Lord,
sir,' said Will Atkins, ' how should we teach them
religion? Why, we know nothing ourselves; and
besides, sir,' said he, ' should we go to talk to them
of God, and Jesus Christ, and heaven, and hell, it
would he to make them laugh at us, and ask us,
what we believe ourselves? And if we should tell
them, we believe all the things that we speak of to
them, such as of good people going to heaven, and
Wicked peOpIe to the devil, they would ask us,
Where we intended to go ourselves, who believe all
""5. and yet are such wicked fellows, as we indeed
are? Why, sir,' said Will, ' it is enough to give
them a surfeit of religion at first hearing. Folks
must have some religion themselves, before they.
Pretend to teach other people.' ' "gill Atkins,' said.
I 1deg him, ' though I am afraid what you say has too
much truth in it, yet can you not tell your wife,
that she is in the wrong ; that there is a God, and
1'. religion better than her own; that her gods are
idols; that they can neither hear nor speak; that
there is a great Being that made all things, and
that can destroy all that he has made ; that he re-
wards the good, and punishes the bad; that we are
to be judged by him, at last, for all we do here?
You are not so ignorant, but even nature itself
will teach you that all this is true; and I am satis
lied you know it all to be true, and believe it your.
self.'

' That's true, sir,' said Atkins; ' but with what
face can I say any thing to my wife of all this,
when she will tell me immediately, it cannot be
true." .

" Not true?' said -I: ' what do you mean by thatl'
' Why, sir,' said he, ' she will tell me it cannotbc
true, that this God I shall tell her of can be just.
or can punish, or reward, since I am not punished>>
and sent to the devil, that have been such a wick-
ed creature as she knows I have been, even to her
and to every body else; and that I should be suf'
fered to live, that have been always acting so con-
trary to what I muSt tell her is good, and to what
I ought to have done.'

' Why truly, Atkins,' said I, ' I am afraid thou
speakest too much truth ;' and with that I let the
clergyman know what Atkins had said, for he W35
impatient to know. ' O!' said the priest, ' "3"
him there is one thing will make him the best mini-
ster in the world to his wife, and that is, repentance;
for none teach repentance like true penitents. He
wants nothing but to repent, and then he will be
so much the better qualified to instruct his wife; he
will be then able to tell her, that there is not only
a God, and that he is the just rewarder of good and
evil, but that he is a merciful Being, and, with infi-
nite goodness and long suffering, forbears to punis"
those that offend, waiting to be gracious, and will-
ing not the death of a sinner, but rather that he
should return and live; that he often suffers wick.
ed men to go on a long time, and even reserves
damnation to the general day of retribution; that
it is a clear evidence of God and of a future state,
that righteous men receive not their reward, or
wicked men their punishment, till they come into
another world; and this will lead him to teach
his wife the doctrine of the resurrection, and of the
last judgment. Let him but repent for himself, he
will be an excellent preacher of repentance to his
wife.'

I repeated all this to Atkins, who looked very se-
rious all the while, and who, we could easily per'
ceive, was more than ordinarily affected with it:
when being eager, and hardly suffering ,me to make
an end, ' I knew all this, master,' said he, ' and a
great deal more, but I ha'n't the impudence to talk
Lhas to my wife, when God and my own con-
science knows, and my wife will be an undeniable
evidence against me, that I have lived as if I had
never heard of a God, or of a future state, or any
thing aboutit; and to talk of my repenting, alas!
(and with that he fetched a deep sigh, and I could
see that tears stood in his eyes), 'tis past all that
with me.' ' Past it! Atkins,' said I; ' what dost
thou mean by that?' ' I know well enough what I
mean, sir,' said he: ' I mean 'tis too late; and that
15 too true.'

I told my clergyman, word for word, what he
said. The poor zealous priest (I must call him so,
for be his opinion what it will, he had certainly a
most singular affection for the good of other men's
""15. and it would be hard to think he had not the
like for his own; I say, this zealous, affectionate
nlam) could not refrain tears also; but, recovering
himself, he said to me, ' Ask him but one question,
Is he easy that it is too late, or is he troubled, and
wishes it were not so?' I put the question fairly to
{\tkins, and he answered with a great deal of pas-
510": How could any man be easy in a condition
that certainly must end in eternal destruction;
, that he was far from being easy, but that, on the
X 2
contrary, he believed it would, one time or other,
ruin him.

I What do you mean by that." said I. Why,
he said, he believed he should, one time or other,
out his own throat, to put an end to the terror
of it.

The clergyman shook his head; with a great con.
cern in his face, when I told him all this; but turn-
ing quick to me upon it, says, ' If that be his case.
you may assure him it is not too late: Christ will
give him repentance. But pray,' says he, ' explain
this to him, that as no man is saved but by Christ,
and the merit of his passion procuring Divine
mercy for him, how can it be too late for any man to
receive mercy? Does he think he is able to sin
beyond the power or reach of Divine mercy? Pray
tell him there may be a time when provoked mercy
will no longer strive, and when God may refuse to
hear; but that it is never too late for men to ask
mercy; and we that are Christ's servants are com.
mended to preach mercy at all times, in the name
of Jesus Christ, to all those that sincerely repent;
so that it is never too late to repent.'

I told Atkins all this, and he heard me with great
earnestness; but it seemed as if he turned oil" the
discourse to the rest, for he said to me he would go
and have some talk with his wife. So he went out
a while, and we talked to the rest. I perceived
they were all stupidly ignorant, as to matters of
religion, much as I was when I went rambling
away from my father, and yet that there were
none of them backward to hear what had been
said, and all of them seriously promised that the!
would talk with their wives about it, and do
their endeavours to persuade them to turn Chris-
tians.

The clergyman smiled upon me, when I reported
what answer they gave, and said nothing a 800d
while; but, at last, shaking his head, ' We that m
Christ's servants,' says he, ' can go no further than
to-exhort and instruct; and when men comply, sub'
mit to the reproof, and promise what we ask, it is
all we can do: we are bound to accept their good
words. But believe me, sir,' said he, ' whatever
you may have known of the life of that man you
call William Atkins, I believe he is the only sincere

_ convert among them. I take that man to be a true

penitent ; I will not despair of the rest; but that
man is apparently struck with the sense of his past
life; and I doubt not, but when he comes to talk
religion to his wife, he will talk himself effectually
into it; for attempting to teach others, is some-
times the best way of teaching ourselves. I knew
a man,' added he, ' who, having nothing but a sum-
mary notion of religion himself, and being wicked
and profligatc to the last degree, in his life, made a
thorough reformation in himself, by labouring to
convert a Jew: and if that poor Atkins begins but
once to talk seriously of Jesus Christ to his wife,
my life for it, he talks himselfiuto a thorough con-
vert, makes himself a penitent: and who knows
what may follow i' '

_ Upon this discourse, however, and their promis-
lng, as above, to endeavour to persuade their wives
to embrace Christianity, he married the other three
COUPIe: but Will Atkins and his wife were not yet
come in. After this, my clergyman waiting a
while, was curious to know where Atkins was gone,
and turning to me, says he, ' I entreat you, sir, let
us walk out of your labyrinth here, and look; I
dare say we shall find this poor man, somewhere
or other, talking seriously with his wife, and teach-
lng her already something of religion.' I began to
be of the same mind. So we went out together;
and I carried him a way which none knew but my-
?8", and where the trees were so thick set, as that
It Was not easy to see through the thicket of leaves,
andfar harder to see in, than to see out; when
coming to the edge of the wood, I saw Atkins and
his tawny, savage wife, sitting under the shade of a
bush, very eager in discourse. I stopped short, till
my clergyman came up to me, and then, having
showed him where they were, we stood and looked
very steadily at them a good while.

We observed him very earnest with her, pointing
up to the sun, and to every quarter of the heavens,
then down to the earth, then out to the sea, then
to himself. then to her, to the woods, to the trees,
' Now,' says my clergyman, ' you see my words are
made good: the man preaches to her. Mark him;
now he is telling her that our God has made him.
and her, and the heavens, the earth, the sea, the
woods, the trees, &c.' ' I believe he is,' said 1.
Immediately we perceived Will Atkins start up
upon his feet, fall down upon his knees, and lift
up both his hands. We suppose he said something;
but we could not hear him: it was too far for that-
He did not continue kneeling half a minute, but
comes and sits down again by his wife, and talks
to her again. We perceived then the woman very
attentive, but whether she said any thing or no, we
could not tell. While the poor fellow was upon
his knees, I could see the tears run plentifully down
my clergyman's cheeks; and I could hardly forbcar
myself: but it was a great affliction to us both, that
we were not near enough to hear any thing that
passed between them.

Well, however, we could come no nearer, for fear
of disturbing them; so we resolved to see an end
of this piece of still conversation; and it spoke
loud enough to us, without the help of voice. He
sat down again, as I have said, close by her. and
talked again very earnestly to her, and two or three
times we could see him embrace her passionately;
another time we saw him take out his handker-
chief, and wipe her eyes, and then kiss her again;
with a kind of transport very unusual: and. after
several of these things, we saw him, on .a sudden;
jump up again, and lend her his hand to help her
up, when immediately leading her by the hand: 5"
step or two, they both kneeled down together, and
continued so about two minutes. '

My friend could bear it no longer, but cries out
aloud, ' Saint Paul! Saint Paul! behold he pray-
eth! ' I was afraid Atkins would hear him; there-
fore I entreated him to withhold himself a while,
that we might see the end of the scene, which to
me, I must confess, was the most affecting, and yet
the most agreeable, that ever I saw in my life.
Well, he strove with himself, and contained him-
self for a while, but was in such raptures of joy to
think that the poor heathen woman was become a
Christian, that he was not able to contain himself:
he wept several times, then throwing up his hands,
and crossing his breast, said over several things
ejaculatory, and by way of giving God thanks for
so miraculous a testimony of the success of our
endeavours. Some he spoke softly, and I could
not well hear; others audibl y, some in Latin, some
in French; then two or three times the tears of
joy would interrupt him, that he could not speak
at all. ' But I begged that he would compose him-
self, and let us more narrowly and fully observe
what was before us, which he did for a time, and
the scene was not ended there yet; for after the
Poor man and his wife were risen again from their
knees, we observed he stood talking still eagerly to
he"; and we observed by her motion that she was
greatly affected with what he said, by her frequent
lifting up her hands, laying her hand to her breast,
and such other postures, as usually express the
greatest seriousness and attention. This continued
about half a quarter of an hour, and then they
Walked away too; so that we could see no more of
them in that situation.

1 took this interval to talk with my clergyman:
"lid, first, I told him I was glad to see the parti-
t'ulars we had both been witnesses to; that though
1 Was hard enough of belief in such cases, yet that
' heE-Ian to think it was all very sincere here, both
in the man and his wife, however ignorant they
might both be; and I hoped such a beginning
would have yet a more happy end, ' And who
knows,' said I, ' but these two may in time, by in-
struction and example, work upon some of the
others?' ' Some of them!' said he, turning quick
upon me, ' aye, upon all of them: depend upon it,
if those two savages (for he has been but little
better, as you relate it) should embrace Jesus
Christ, they will never leave till they work upon
all the rest; for true religion is naturally commu-
nicative, and he that is once made a Christian, will
never leave a Pagan behind him, if he can help it.'
I owned it was a most Christian principle to think
so, and a testimony of a true zeal, as well as a ge- _
nerous heart in him. ' But, my friend,' said I,
' will you give me leave to start one difficulty
here? I cannot tell how to object the least thing
against that affectionate concern which you show
for the turning the poor people from their Pagan-
ism to the Christian religion. But how does this
comfort you, while these people are, in your ac.
count, out of the pale of'the catholic church, with-
out which you believe there is no salvation; so
that you esteem these but heretics still, and, for
other reasons, as effectually lost as the Pagans
themselves.'

To this he answered, with abundance of candour,
and Christian charity, thus: ' Sir, I am a Catholic
of the Roman Church, and a priest of the order of
saint Benedict, and I embrace all the principles of
the Roman faith; but yet, if you will believe me,
and this I do not speak in compliment to you, 01'
in respect to my circumstances and your civilities;.I
say, nevertheless, I do not look upon you, who call
yourselves reformed, without some charity. I dare
not say, though I know it is our opinion in general;
yet I dare not say, that you cannot be saved; I will
by no means limit the mercy of Christ, so far as to
think that he cannot receive you into the bosom 0f
his church in a manner to us unperceivable, and
which it is impossible for us to know; and I hope
you have the same charity for us. I pray daily
for your being all restored to Christ's church, by
whatsoever methods He, who is all-wise, is pleased
to direct. In the mean time, sure you will allow
it to consist with me as a Roman, to distinguish far
between a Protestant and a Pagan; between one
that calls on Jesus Christ, though in a way which I
do not think is according to the true faith, and a
savage, a-barbariau, that knows no God, no Christ,
no Redeemer; and if you are not within the pale
0f the Catholic Church, we hope you are nearer
being restored to it, than those that know nothing
at all of God, or his church. I rejoice, therefore,
when I see this poor man, who, you say, has been
a profligate, and almost a murderer, kneel- down,
and pray to Jesus Christ, as we suppose he did,
though net fully enlightened; believing that God,
from whom every such work proceeds, will sensibly
touch his heart, and bring him to the further know-
ledge of the truth in his own time; and if God
shall influence this poor man to convert and in-
struct the ignorant savage his wife, I can never be-
lieve that he shall be cast away himself. And have
I not reason then to rejoice, the nearer any are
brought to the knowledge of Christ, though they
may not be brought quite home into the bosom of
the Catholic Church, just at the time when I may
desire it, leaving it to the goodness of Christ to
perfect his work in his own time, and his own
Way? Certainly I would rejoice if all the savages
in America were brought, like this poor woman, to
Pray to God, though they were to be all Protestants
at first, rather than they should continue Pagans
and Ileathens; firmly believing that he who had
bestowed that first light upon them, would further
illuminate them with a beam of his heavenly grace,

and bring them into the pale of his church, when
he should see good.'
I was astonished at the sincerity and temper of
this truly pious Papist, as much as I was oppressed
by the power of his reasoning; and it presently
occurred to my thoughts, that if such a temper was
universal, we might be all catholic Christians, what-
ever church, or particular profession, we joined to,
or joined in; that a spirit of charity would soon
work us all up into right principles; and, in a
word, as he thought, that the like charity would
make us all Catholics, so. I told him I believed,
had all the members of his church the like mo-
deration, they would soon be all Protestants: and
there we left that part; for we never disputed at

all.
' However, I talked to him another way, and tak-
ing him by the hand, ' My friend,' said I, ' I wish
all the clergy of the Roman Church were blessed
with such moderation, and an equal share of your
charity. I am entirely of your Opinion; but I
muSt tell you, that if you should preach such doc.
trine in Spain or Italy, they would put you into
the Inquisition.'

' It may be so,' said he: ' I know not what they
might do in Spain or Italy; but I will not say
they would be the better Christians for that 58'
verity, for I am sure there is no heresy in too much
charity.'

Well, as Will Atkins and his wife were gom',
our business there was over; so we went back our
own way; and when we came back, we found them
waiting to he called in. Observing this, I askell
my clergyman, if we should discover to him, that
we had seen him under the bush, or no; and
it was his opinion we should not, but that "'6
should talk to him first, and hear what he would
say to us. So we called him in alone, nobody
being in the place but ourselves; and I began with
him thus:

' Will Atkins,' said I, ' prithee what education
had you? What was your father."
W. A. Abetter man than ever I shall be. Sir,
my father was a clergyman. -

'R. C. What education did he give you?

W. A. He would have taught me well, sir; but I
de5pised all education, instruction, or correction,
like a beast as I was.

R. C'. It is true, Solomon says, ' He that despises
rcproof is brutish.'

W. A. Aye, sir, I was brutish indeed; I murder-
ed my father: for God's sake, sir, talk no more
about that, sir; I murdered my poor father!

Priest. Ha! a murderer! .

Here the priest started (for I interpreted every
word as he spoke it), and looked pale; it seems he
believed that Will had really killed his own father.

R. C'. No, no, sir; I do not understand him so.
Will Atkins, explain yourself: you did not kill
your father, did you, with your own hands?

117.11. No, sir; I did not cut his throat, but I
cut the thread of all his comforts, and shortened
his days. I broke his heart by the most ungrate-
ful, unnatural'return for the most tender, affection-
ate treatment that ever father gave, or child could
receive.

R. 0. Well, 1 did not ask you about your father,
to extort this confession: I pray God to give you
n'-Pentance for it, and forgive you that and all your
other sins; but I asked you because I see that
though you have not much learning, yet you are
not so ignorant as some are, in things that are good;
thall: you have known more of religion a great deal
than you have practised.

W. A. Though you, sir, did not extort the con-
fession that I make about my father, conscience
d003, and whenever we come to look back upon
our lives, the sins against our indulgent parents
are certainly the first that touch us; the wounds
Uley make lie deepest, and the weight they leave

Will lie heaviest upon the mind, of all the sins we
can commit.
R. C. You talk too feeliugly and sensibly for me'
Atkins; I cannot bear it.

W. A. You hear it, master! I dare say you know
nothing ofit. .

13.0. Yes, Atkins, every shore, every hill, nay,
I may say, every tree in this island, is witness to
the anguish of my soul, for my ingratitude and base
usage of a. good, tender father; a father much like
yours, by your description; and I murdered my
father aswell as you, Will Atkins: but I think, for
all that, my repentance is short of yours too by a
great deal. .

I would have said more, if I could have restrain-
ed my passions; but I thought this poor man's re-
pentance was so much sincerer than mine, that I
was going to leave of? the discourse, and retire; for
I was surprised with what he said, and thought that,
instead of my going about to teach and instruct
him, the man Was made a teacher and instructor to
me, in a most surprising and unexpected manner.

I laid all this before the young clergyman, who
was greatly affected with it, and said to me, ' Did
I not say, sir, that when this man was converted,
he would preach to us all? I tell you, sir, if this
one man be made a true penitent, here will be no
need of me; he will make Christians of all in the
island.' But having a little composed myself, I
renewed my discourse with Will Atkins.,

' But, Will,' said I, ' how comes the sense of this
matter to touch you just now?' ,
W. A. Sir, you have set me about a work that
has {struck a dart through my very soul. I have
been talking about God and religion to my wife, in
order, as you directed me, to make a Christian of
her; and she has preached such a sermon to me, as

I shall never forget while I live.

R. 0. No, no. it is not your wife has preached to
you; but when you were moving religious avgu'
ments to her, conscience has flung them back upon
you.
W. A. Aye, sir, with such a force as is not to be
resisted.

R. 0. Pray, Will, let us know what passed be-
tween you and your wife; for I know something of
it already.

W. A. Sir, it is impossible to give you a full ac-
count of it; I am too full to hold it, and yetuhave
,. no tongue to express it; but let her have said what
' _ She will, and though I cannot give you an account
of it, this I can tell you of it, that I resolve to
amend and reform my life.

R. 0. But tell us some ofit. How did you be-
gin, Will? For this has been an extraordinary case,
that is certain: she has preached a sermon indeed,
if she has wrought this upon you.

W. .4. Why I first told her the nature of our
laws about marriage, and what the reasons were
that men and women were obliged to enter into
Such compacts, as it was neither in the power of
one nor other to break; that otherwise order and
justice could not be maintained, and men would
run from their wives, and abandon their children,
mix confusedly with one another, and neither fa-
milies be kept entire, nor inheritances be settled by
3 legal descent.

13- C'. You talk like a civilian, Will. Could you
make her understand what you meant by inherit-
ance and families? They know no such thing among
the savages, but marry any how, without regard to
relation. consanguinity, or family; brother and sis-
ter, nay. us I have been told, even the father and
d"lighter. and the son and the mother.

WJI. I believe, sir, you are misinformed; and
my wife assures me of the contrary, and that they
ablior it: perhaps for any farther relations, they
may not be so exact as we are; but she tells me
they never touch one another in the near relations
you speak of.

l 15- 0. Well, what did she say to what you told
ter.
W. A. She said she liked it very well, and it was
much better than in her country.

.R. 0. But did you tell her what marriage was?

W. A. Aye, aye; there began. all our dialogue. I
asked her it she would be married to me our way.
She asked me what way that was. I told her mar
riage was appointed by God: and here we had a
strange talk together, indeed, as ever man and wife
had, I believe.

N. B. This dialogue between W. Atkins and his
wife, as I took it down in writing, just after he told
it me, was as follows:

Wife. Appointed by your God! why, have you a
God in your country?

IV. A. Yes, my dear: God is in every country.

IVz'Zfe. No you God in my country: my country
have the great old Benamuckee god.

W". Al. Child, I am very unfit to show you who
God is: God is in heaven, and" made the heaven
and the earth, the sea, and all mm; in them is.

With. No makee de earth; no you God makee
de earth; no makee my country. '

Will laughed a little at her expression of God not
making her country.

Wzlfe. No laugh: why laugh me? This no ting
to laugh.

He was justly reproved by his wife; for she was
more serious than he at first.

147. A. That's true, indeed: I will not laugh any
more, my dear.

Wefc. Why you say, you God make all?

IV. A. Yes, child, our God made the whole
world, and you, and me, and all things; for he 15
the only true God: there is no God but he. He
lives for ever in heaven.

Wife. Why you no tell me long ago?

W. A. That's true, indeed; but I have been a
wicked wretch, and have not only forgotten to ac.
quaint-thee with any thing before, but have lived
.without God in the world myself.
Wife. What have you de great God in you coun-
try, you no know him? No say 0 to him? No do -
good ting for him? That no possible.

W. A. It is true enough for all that. We live as
if there were no God in heaven, or that he had no
power on earth.

Wafc. But why God let you do so? Why he no
makce you good live?

W.A. It is all our own fault.

Wife. But you say me, he is great, much great,
have much great power; can makee _kill when he
will; why he no makee kill when you no serve
him? No say 0 to him? No be good mans?

W. A. That is true: he might strike me dead,
and I ought to expect it; for I have been a wicked
wretch, that is true; but God is merciful, and does
not deal with us as we deserve.

Wefe. But then do not you tell God, Tankee
for that too?

W. A. No, indeed; I have not. thanked God for
his mercy, any more than I have feared God for his
power.

Wife. Then you God no God; me no tink, 'be-
licvc, he be such one, great much power, strong;
no makee kill you, though you makee him much
angry.

W.A. What! will my wicked life hinder you
from believing in God? What a dreadful creature
am 1! and what a sad truth it is, that the horrid
lives of Christians hinder the conversion of hea-
thens!

szf'e. How me tink you have great much God
up there (she points up to heaven), and yet no do
well, no do good ting? Can he tell? Sure he no
tell what you do?

W. A. Yes, yes; he knows and sees all things:
he hears us speak, sees what we do, knows what we
think, though we do not speak.

Wife. What! he no hear you swear, curse, speak
the great damn?
W. A. Yes, yes; he hears it all.

Wife. Where be then the muchee great power
strong?

W. A. He is merciful; that is all we can say for
it; and this proves him to be thetrue God: he is
God, and not man; and therefore we are not com
sumed.

Hero Will Atkins told us, he was struck with hor-
ror to think how he could tell his wife so clearly
that God sees, and hears, and knows the secret
thoughts of the heart, and all that we do ; and yet
that he had dared to do all the vile things he had
done. .

szfe. Merciful! What you call dat?

W. .11. He is our Father and Maker; and he pi.
ties and spares us.

Wife. 80 then he never makee kill, never angry
when you do wicked; then he no good himself, or
no great able.

W. A. Yes, yes, my dear; he is infinitely good,
andinfinitely great, and able to punish too: and
sometimes, to show his justice and vengeance, he
lets fly his anger to destroy sinners, and make ex-
amples. Many are cut off in their sins.

szc. But no makee kill you yet'; then he tell
you, may be, that he no makee you kill, so you
makee de bargain with him, you do bad ting, he
no be angry at you, when he be angry at other
mans?

W. A. No, indeed; my sins are all presumptions
upon his goodness; and he would be infinitely
just, if he destroyed me, as he has done other
men. .
Wife. Well, and yet no kill, no makee you dead!
What you say to him for that? You no tell him,
Tankee for all that too!

W. A. I am an unthankful, ungrateful dog, that
is true.

Wife. Why he no makee you much good better?
You say he makee you.
W.A. He made me as he made all the world:
it is I have deformed myself, and abused his
goodness, and have made myself an abominable
wretch.

Wife. I wish you makee God know me: I no
makee him angry ; I no (lo bad wicked ting.

Here Will Atkins said his heart sunk within
him, to hear a poor, untaught creature desire to
be taught to know God; and he such a wicked
wretch, that he could not say one word to her
about God, but what the reproach of his own
carriage would make most irrational to her to be-
lieve ; nay, that already she had told him that she
could not believe in God, because he that was so
wicked was not destroyed.

W.A. My dear, you mean you wish I could
teach you to know God, not God to know you; for
:leknows you already, and every thought in your
mart.

szc. Why then he know what I say to you now;
he know me wish to know him. How shall me
know who makee me? _

W. A. Poor creature, he must teach thee: I can-
not teach thee. I'll pray to him to teach thee to
know him; and to forgive me, that I am unworthy
to teach thee. '

.The poor fellow was in such an agony at her de-

string him to make her know God, and her wishing
to know him, that he said he fell down on his knees
_ before her, and prayed to God to enlighten her
mind. with the saving knowledge of Jesus Christ,
and to pardon his sins, and accept of his beihg the
unworthy instrument of instructing her in the prin-
Ciples of religion; after which he sat down by her
again ; and their dialogue went on. _

N. B. This was the time when we saw him kneel
down, and lift up his hands.

Wife. What you put down the knee for? What
.You hold up the hand for? What you say? Who
you speak to? What is all that?
W. A. My dear, I bow my knees in token of
my submission to him that made me. I said, ' O!'
to him, as you call it; and as you. say your old
men do to their idol Benamuckee; that is, I prayed
to him. -

Wife. What you say, 0! to him for?

W. A. I prayed to him to open your eyes and

your understanding, that you may know him, and
be acccepted by him.

Wife. Can he do that too i _

W. A. Yes, he can : he can. do all things.

Wife. But he no hear what you say?

W'. A. Yes, he has bid us pray to him; and pro.
mised to hear us.

Wife. Bid you pray! When he bid you? how be
bid you? What! you hear him Speak?

W. A. No, we do not hear him speak ; but he has
revealed himself many ways to us.

Here he was at a great loss to make her under-
stand, that God has revealed himself to us by his
word, and what his word was; but, at last, he told
'it her thus:

W. A. God has spoken to some good men in
former days, even from heaven, by plain words;
and God has inspired good men by his Spirit? and
they have written all his laws down in a book.

Wife. Me no understand that. Where is book?

W. A. Alas! my poor creature, I have not this
book; but, I hope I shall, one time or other, get it
for you, and help you to read it. _

Here he embraced her with great affection; but
with inexpressible grief that he had not a Bible.

Wife. But how you makes me know, that God
teachee them to write that book? '

W. A. By the same rule that we know him to
be God. ;,

Wife. What rule, what way you know?

W. A. Because he teaches and commands nothing
but what is good, righteous, and holy; and tends to
make us perfectly good, as well as perfectly happSi
and because he forbids and commands us to avoid
all that is wicked, that is evil in itself, or evil in its
consequences.

ngc. That me would understand, that me fain
see: if he reward all good thing, punish all wicked
thing, he teachee all good thing, forbid all wicked
thing; he makee all thing, he give all thing; he
hear me when I say 0 to him, as you go dojust
now; he makee me good, if I wish be good; he
Spare me, no maltee kill me, when I no be good.
All this you say he do; yes, he be great God : me
take, think, believe, him be great God: me say,
0 to him too, with you, my dear.

Ilere the poor man said he could forbear no
longer; but raising her up, made her kneel by him,
and he prayed to God aloud, to instruct her in the
knowledge of himself by his Spirit, and that, by
50me good providence, if possible, she might, some
time or other, come to have a Bible, that she might
Itead the word of God, and be taught by it to know
um.

This was the time that we saw him lift her up
by the hand, and saw him kneel down by her, as
above. .

They had several other discourses, it seems, after
this. too long to set down here; and particularly
She made him promise, that since he confessed his
own life had been a wicked, abominable course of
provocation against God, that he would reform it,
and net make God angry any more, lest he should
' makee him dead,' as she called it, and then she
Should be left alone, and never taught to know
this God better; and lest he should be miserable,
as he had told her wicked men should be after
death.

This was a strange account, and very affecting to
us both, but particularly to the young clergyman:
he was indeed wonderfully surprised with it; but
under the greatest affliction imaginable, that he
Could not talk to her; that he could not speak

Y
English to make her understand him; and as she
spoke but very broken English, he could not un-
derstand her. However, he turned himself to
me, and told me, that he believed there must be
more to do with this woman than to marry her.
I did not understand him at first, but at length
he explained himself, viz. that she ought to be bap-
tized.

I agreed with him in that part readily, and was
for going about it presently. ' No, no; hold sir,'
said he, ' though I would have her baptized by all
means, yet I must ob'servevthat Will Atkins, her
husband, has indeed brought her, in a wonderful
manner, to be willing to embrace a religious life;
and has given her just ideas of the being of a God,
of his power, justice, mercy; yet I desire to know
of him, if he had said any thing to her of Jesus
Christ, and of the salvation of sinners; of the na-
ture of faith in him, and redemption by him; of the
Holy Spirit,'the resurrection, the last judgement,
and a future state.

I called Will Atkins again, and asked him; but
the poor fellow fell immediately into tears, and told
us, he had said something to her of all those things,
but: that he was himself so wicked a creature, and
his own conscience so reproached him with his her,
rid, ungodly life, that he trembled at the apprehen-
sions that her knowledge of him should lessen the
attention she should give to those things, and make
her rather contemn religion than receive it. But
he was assured, he said, that her mind was so dis'
posed to receive due impressions of all those things:
that if'I would but discourse with her, she would
make it appear to my satisfaction, that my labour
would not be lost upon her.

Accordingly I called her in, and placing myself
as interpreter between my religious priest and the
woman, I entreated him to begin with her; but '
sure such a sermon was never preached by a papiSh
priest in these latter ages of the world; and, as 1,-.- --.wr:

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 483

told him, I thought he had all the zeal, all the
knowledge, all the sincerity of a Christian, with-
out the errors of a Roman Catholic; and that I
took him to be such a clergyman as the Roman
bishops were, before the Church of Rome assum-
ed spiritual sovereignty over the consciences of
men.

In a word, he brought the poor woman to em-
brace the knowledge of Christ, and of redemption
by him, not with wonder and astonishment only,
as she did the first notions of a God, but with joy
and faith, with an affection, and a surprising de~
gree of understanding, scarce to be imagined, much
less to be expressed; and, at her own request, she
was baptized.

When he was preparing to baptize her, I entreat-
ed him that he would perform that office with some
caution, that the man might not perceive he was
of the Roman Church, if possible; because .of other
ill consequences which might attend a difl'erence
among us in that very religion which we were in-
structing the other in. He told me that as he had
no consecrated chapel, no proper things for the
office. I should see he would do it in a manner
that I should not know by it that he was a Roman
Catholic myself, if I had not known it before. And
so he did; for saying only some words over to
himself in Latin, which I could not understand,
be poured a dish full of water upon the woman's
head, pronouncing, in French, very loud, ' Mary,'
Which was the name her husband desired me to
give her, for I was her godfather, ' I baptize
thee in the name of the Father, and of the Son,
and of the Holy Ghost;' so that none could know
any thing by it, what religion he was of. He
gave the benediction afterwards in Latin; but
Either Will Atkins did not know but it was in
french, or else did not take notice of it at that
tune.

As soon as this was over, he married them; and
after the marriage was over, he turned himself to
Will Atkins, and, in a very affectionate manner.
exhorted him, not only to persevere in that good
disposition he was in, but to support the convic-
tions that were upon him, by a resolution to reform
his life; told him it was in vain to say he repented,
if he did not forsake his crimes; represented to
him how God had honoured him with being the in-
strument of bringing his wife to the knowledge of
the Christian religion; and that he should be care-
ful he did not dishonour the grace of God; and
that, if he did, he would see the heathen a better
Christian than himself, the savage converted, and
the instrument cast away.

He said a great many good things to them both,
and then rec0mmending them, in a few words, to
God's goodness, gave them the benediction again,
I repeating every thing to them in English. And
thus ended the ceremony. I think it was the most
pleasant, agreeable day to me that ever I passed in
my whole life.

But my clergyman had not done yet; his thoughts
hung continually upon the conversion of the thirty-
seven savages; and fain he would have staid upon
the island to have undertaken it; but I convinced
him, first, that his undertaking was impracticable
in itself; and, secondly, that perhaps I would pill
it into a way of being done, in his absence, to his-
satisfaction: of which by and by.

Having thus brought the affair of the island to a
narrow compass, I was preparing to go on board
the ship, when the young man whom I had taken
out of the famished ship's company, came to me.
and told me, he understood I had a clergyman
with me, and that I had caused the Englishmen
to be married to the savages, whom they called
wives; that he had a match too, which he desired
might be finished before I went, between two Chris-
tians, which, he hoped, would not be' disagreeable
to me.
I knew this must be the young woman who was
his mother's servant; for there was no other Chris-
tian woman on the island: so I began to persuade
him not todo any thing of that kind rashly, or be-
cause he found himself in this solitary circumstance.
I represented that he had some considerable sub.
stance in the world, and good friends, as I under-
stood by himself, and by his maid also; that the
maid was not only poor, and a servant, but was
unequal to him, she being twenty-six or twenty-
seven years old, and he not above seventeen or
eighteen; that he might, very probably, with my
assistance, make a remove from this wilderness,
and come into his own country again; and that
then it would be a thousand to one but he would
repent his choice; and the dislike of that circum-
stance might be disadvantageous to both. I was
gaing to say more, hut he interrupted me, smiling,
and told me, with a great deal of modesty, that
l mistook in my guesses, that he had nothing of
that kind in his thoughts, his present circumstance
being melancholy and disconsolate enough, and he
was very glad to hear that I had thoughts of put.
ting them in a way to see their own country again;
and that nothing should have set him upon stay-
ing there, but that the voyage I Was going was so
exceeding long and hazardous, and would carry
him quite out of the reach of all his friends; that
he had nothing to desire of me, but that I would
settle him in some little property in the island
Where he was, give him a servant or two, and some
few necessaries, and he would settle himself here
like a-planter, waiting the good time when, if ever
Ireturned to England, I would redeem him, and
hoped I w0uld not be unmindful of him when I
came to England; that he would give me some let-
ters to his friends in London, to let them know
how good I had been to him, and what part of the
"'0'", and what circumstance, I had left him in;
that he promised me, that whenever I redeemed<<w-.;.v_--

him the plantation, and all the improvements he
made upon it, let the value be what it would, should
be wholly mine. '

His discourse was very prettily delivered, consi~
dering his youth; and was the more agreeable to
me, because he told mepositively the match was
not for himself. I gave him all possible assurances
that if I lived to come safe to England, I would
deliver his letters, and do his business effectually,
and that he might depend I would never forget
the circumstance I left him in. But still I was im~
patient to know who were the persons to be mar-
ried; upon which he told me it was my Jack of all
trades, and his maid Susan.

I was most agreeably surprised when he named
the match, for indeed I thought it very suitable.
The character of that man I have given already;
and as for the maid, she was a very honest, modest,
sober, and religious young woman; had a very
good share of sense, was agreeable enough in her
person, spoke very handsomely, and to the purpose,
always with decency and good manners, and not
backward to speak when any thing required it, or
impertinently forward to speak when it was 110t
her business; very handy and housewifely in any
thing that was before her; an excellent manager,
and lit indeed to have been governess to the whole
island. She knew very well how to behave herself
to all kind of folks she had about her, and to bet-
ter, if she had found any there.

The match being proposed in this manner, we
married them the same day; and as I was father
at the altar, as I may say, and gave her aWay, 50
1 gave her a portion, for'I appointed her and'hel'
husband, a handsome, large space of ground for
their plantation; and indeed this match, and Ill?
proposal the young gentleman made to me, to give
him a small property in the island, put me upon
parcelling it out among them, that they might 110'
quarrel afterwards about their situation.
This sharing out the land to them I left to Will
Atkins, who indeed was now grown a most sober,
grave, managing fellow, perfectly reformed, exceed-
ing pious and religious; and, as far as I may be
allowed to speak positively in such a case, I verily
believe, was a true, sincere penitent.

I-Ie divided things so justly, and so much to
every one's satisfaction, that they only desired one
general writing under my hand for the whole;
which I caused to be drawn up, and signed and
sealed to them, setting out the bounds and situa-
tion of every man's plantation. and testifying that
1 gave them thereby severally a right to the whole
possession and inheritance of the respective plan-
tations or farms, with their improvements, to them
and their heirs, reserving all the rest of the island
as my own property, and a certain rent for every
particular plantation. after eleven years, if I, or
any one, from me, or in my name, came to de-
mand it producing an attested copy of the same
writing.

As to the government and laws among them, I
told them I was not capable of giving them better
rules than they were able to give themselves, only
made them promise me to live in love and good
neighbourhood with one another. And so I pre-
pared to leave them.

One thing I must not omit; and this is, that
being now settled in a kind of commonwealth
among themselves, and having much business in
hand, it was but odd to have seven-and-thirty 1n-
dians live in a nook of the island, independent, and
indeed unemployed; for, excepting the providing
themselves food, which they had difficulty enough
in too sometimes, they had no. manner of business
.01' Property to manage. I proposed, therefore, to
the governor Spaniard that he should go to them,
with Friday's father, and propose to them to re.
rnove, and either plantfor themselves, or take them
into their several families as servants, to be main-
tained for their labour, but without being absolute
slaves; for I would not admit them to make them
slaves by force, by any means, because they had
their liberty given them by capitulation, and, as it
were, articles of surrender, which they ought not
'to break.

They most willingly embraced the proposal, and
came all very cheerfully along with him. So we
allotted them land and plantations, which three or
four accepted of, but all the rest chose to be em-
ployed as servants in the several families we had
settled. And thus my colony was in a manner
settled, as follows: the Spaniards possessed my
original habitation, which was the capital city, and
extended their plantation all along the side of
the brook, which made the creek that I have so
often described, as far as my bower; and as they
increased their culture, it went always eastward.
The English lived in the north-east part, whereWill
Atkins and his comrades began, and came on south-
ward, and south-west, towards the back part of the
Spaniards; and every plantation had a great addi-
tion of land to take in, if they found occasion, so
that they need not jostle one another for want of
room.

All the west end of the island was left uninha-
bited, that if any of the savages should come 01l
shore there, only for their usual, customary barba-
rities, they might come and go; if they disturbed
nobody, nobody would disturb them; and no doubt
but they were often ashore, and went away again>>
for I 'never heard that the planters were attacked
0r- disturbed any more.

It now came into my thoughts, that I had hinted
to my friend the clergyman that the work of con'
verting the savages might perhaps be set on foot
in his absence, to his satisfaction; and I told him
that now I thought it was put in a fair way: for the
savages being thus divided among the Christians.
if they would but every one of them do their part
with those which came under their hands, I heped
it might have a very good effect.

He agreed presently in that : .' If,' said he, ' they
will do their part; but how,'.says he, ' shall we ob-
tain that of them?' I told him we could call them
all together, and leave it in charge with them, or
go to them one by one, which he thought best. So
we divided it: he to speak to the Spaniards, who
were all Papists; and I to the English, who were
all Protestants; and we recommended it earnestly
to them, and made them promise, that they would
never make any distinction of Papist or Protestant,
in their exhorting the savages to turn Christians;
but teach them the general knowledge of the true
God, and of their Saviour Jesus Christ: and they
likewise promised us that they would never have
any differences or disputes, one with another, about
religion.

When I came to Will Atkins's house (I may call
it 50, for such a house, or such a piece of basket-
work, I believe, was not standing in the world
again; I say, when I came thither), I found the
WWI! woman I have mentioned above, and Wil-
liam Atkins's wife, were become intimates, and this
prudent, religious young woman had perfected the
work Will Atkins had begun; and though it was
not above four days after what I have related,
Set the new-baptized savage woman was made such
a Christian as I have seldom heard of any like
lief, in all my observation or conversation in the
world.

It came next into my mind, in the morning before
I went to them, that, among all the needful things
I had to leave with them, I had not left a Bible, in
which I showed myself less considering for them,
than my good friend the widow was for me, when
she sent me the cargo of one hundred pounds from
Lisbon, where she packed up three Bibles and a.
Prayer-book. However, the 'good woman's charity
had a greater extent than ever she imagined; for

Y 2 '
they were reserved for the comfort and instruction

of those that made much better use of them than I
had done.

I took one of the Bibles in my pocket, and when
I came to William Atkins's tent or house, and found
the young woman, and Atkins's baptized wife, had
been-discoursing of religion together (for William,
Atkins told me, with a great deal of joy), I asked
if they were together now, and he said, ' Yes.'
50 I went into the house, and he with me, and
we found them together very earnest in discourse.
' O, sir,' says William Atkins, ' when God has
sinners to reconcile to himself, and aliens' to bring
home, he never wants a messenger. My wife has
got a new instructor. I knew I was unworthy as
I was incapable of that work: that young woman
has been sent hither from heaven; she is enough
to convert a whole island of savages.' The young
woman blushed, and rose up to go away, but. I de-
sired her to sit still. I told her she had a good

work upon her hands, and I-- hoped God would
bless her In it.

We talked a little, and I did not perceive they
had any book among them, though I did not ask; -
but I put my hand in my pocket, and pulled out
my Bible. ' I-Ierc,' said I, to Atkins, ' I have
brought you an assistant, that, perhaps, you had
not before.' The man was so confounded that he
was not able to speak for some time; but recover-
ing himself, he takes it with both his hands, and.
turning to his wife, ' Here, my dear,' says he, ' did
not I tell you our God, though he lives above, could
hear what we said? Here is the book I prayed for,
when you and I kneelcd down under the bush:
now God has Ward us, and sent it.' When he had
said thus, the man fell into such transports of a
passionate joy, that between the joy of having itr
and giving God thanks for it, the tears ran down
his face like a child that was crying.

The woman was surprised, and was like to have
run into a mistake that none of us were aware of;
for she firmly believed God had sent the book upon
her husband's petition. It is true, that providen~
tially it was so, and might be taken so in a conse-
quent sense; but I believed it would have been no
diflicult matter, at that time, to have persuaded the
poor woman to have believed that an express mes-
senger came from heaven. on purpose to bring that
individual book. But it was too serious a matter
to sufl'er any delusion to take place; so I turned to
the young woman, and told her, we did not desire
to impose upon the new convert in her first and
more ignorant understamling of things, and begged
her to eXplain to her, that God may be very pro-
perly said to answer our petitions. when, in the
course of his providence, such things are, in a par-
ticular manner, brought to pass, as we petitioned
for; but we do not expect returns from heaven in
a miraculous and particular manner, and that it is
out of mercy that it is not so.

This the young woman did afterwards effectual-
ly; so that there was, I assure you, no 'priestcraft
used here, and I should have thought it one of the
most unjustifiable frauds in the world to have had
it so; but the surprise of joy upon Will Atkins is
really not to be expressed; and there, we may be
sure, there was no delusion. Sure no man was ever
more thankful in the world for any thing of its
kind, than he was for this Bible; and, I believe,
never any man was glad of a Bible from a better
principle: and though he had been a most profli-
gate creature, desperate, headstrong, outrageous,
furious, and wicked, to a great degree; yet this
man is a standing rule to us all for the well in-
structing children, viz. that parents 'should never
'give over to teach and instruct, or ever despair of
the success of their endeavours, let the children
be ever so obstinate, refractory, or, to appearance.
insensible of instruction; for if ever God in his
providence touches the consciences of such, the
force of their education returns upon them, and
the early instruction of parents is not lost, though
it may have been many years laid asleep, but
some time or other, they may find the benefit
of it.

Thus it was with this poor man, however ignorant
he was, or divested of religion and Christian know-
ledge. He found he had some to do with now
more ignorant than himself; and that the least part
of the instruction of his good father that could now
come to his mind was of use to him.

Among the rest it occurred to him, he said, how
his father used to insist much upon the inexpressi.
ble value of the Bible, the privilege and blessing of
it to nations, families, and persons; but he never
entertained the least notion of the worth of it till
now, when being to talk to heathens, savages, and
barbarians, he wanted the help of the written oracle
for his assistance.

The young woman was very glad of it also, for
the present occasion, though she had one, and so
had the youth on board our ship, among their goods,
which were not yet brought on shore. And now
having said so many things of this young woman, I
cannot omit telling one story more of her and my-
self, which has something in it very informing and
remarkable.

I have related to what extremity the poor.young
woman was reduced; how her mistress was starved
to death, and did die, on board that unhappy ship
we met at sea; and how the whole ship's company
being reduced to the last extremity, the gentlewo~
man, and her son, and this maid, were first hardly
used as to provisions, and, at last, totally neglected
and starved; that is to say, brought to the last ex-
tremity of hunger.

One day, being discoursing with her. upon the.
extremities they suffered, I asked her if she could
describe, by what she had felt, what it was to starve,
and how it appeared. She told me, she believ-
ed she could ; and she told her tale very distinctly
thus: '

' First, sir,' said she, ' we had for some days
fared exceedingly hard, and suffered very great hun-
ger; but now, at last, were wholly without food
of any kind, except sugar, and alittle wine, and a
little water. The first day, after I had received no
food at all, I found myself, towards evening, first
empty and sickish at my stomach, and nearer night
mightily inclined to yauning, and sleepy. I laid
down on a couch, in the great cabin, to sleep, and
slept about three hours, and awaked a little re-
freshed, having taken a glass of wine when I lay
down. After being about three hours awake, it
being about five o'clock in the morning, I found
myself empty, and my stomach sickish again, and
laid down again, but could not sleep at all, being
very faint and ill: and thus I continued all the
second day, with a strange variety, first hungry,
then. sick again, with reacliing's to vomit. The se-
cond night, being obliged to go to bed again, with-
out any food more than a draught of fair water,
and being asleep. I dreamed I was at Barbadoes,
and that the market was mightily stocked with pro-
visions ,- that I bought some for my mistress, and
went and dined very heartily.

' I thought my stomach was as full after this, as
it would have been after, or at, a good dinner; but
when I awaited, I was exceedingly sunk in my spi-
rits to find myself in the extremity of famine. The
last glass of wine we had I drank, and put sugar
into it, because of its having some spirit to supply
nourishment; but there being no substance in the
stomach for the digesting office to work upon, I
found the only effect of the wine was, to raise dis-
agreeable fumes from the stomach into the head;
and I lay, as they told me, stupid and senseless, as
one drunk, for some time. '

' The third day in the morning, after a night of
Strange and confused, inconsistent dreams, and ra-
ther dozing than sleeping, I awaked, ravenous and
furious with hunger; and I question, had not my
understanding returned and conquered it, I say, I
question whether, if I had been a mother, and had
had a little child with me, its life would have been
safe, or not.

' This lasted- about three hours, during which
timeI was twice raging mad, as any creature in
Bedlam, as my young master told me, and as he
can now inform you.

' In one of these fits of lunacy, or distraction,
whether by the motion of the ship, or some slip of
my foot, Iknow not, I fell down, and struck my
face against the corner of a pallet-bed, in which my
mistress lay, and, with the blow, the blood gushed
out of my nose; and the cabin-boy bringing me a
little bason, I sat down, and bled into it a great
deal: and as the blood ran from me, I came to my-
self, and the violence of the flame, or the fever. I
was in, abated, and so did the ravenous part of the
hunger.

' Then I grew sick, and reached to vomit, but
could not, for I had nothing in my stomach to
bring up. After I had bled some time, I swooncd,
and they all believed I was dead; but I came to
myself soon after, and then had a most dreadful
pain in my stomach, not to be described; not like
the cholic, but a gnawing, eager pain for food; and
towards night it .went off, with a kind ol' earnest
wishing, or longing for food, something like, as I
suppose, the longing of a woman with child. I
took another draught of water, with sugar in it, but
my stomach loathed the sugar, and brought it all
up again. Then I took a draught of Water without
sugar, and that staid with me; and I laid me down
upon the bed, praying most heartily, that it would
please God to take me away, and, composing my
mind in hopes of it, I slumbered a while. and then
waking, thought myself dying. being light with va-
pours from an empty stomach. I recommended my-.i4

soul to God, and earnestly wished that somebody
would throw me into the sea. a

' All this while my mistress lay by me, just, as I
thought, expiring; but bore it with much more pa-
tience than I, and gave the last bit of bread she
had left to her child, my young master, who would
not have taken it, but she obliged him to eat it;
and, I believe, it saved his life.

' Towards the morning, I slept again; and, first,
when I awaked, I fell into a violent passion of cry-
ing, and, after that, had a second fit of violent hun-
ger, so that 1 got up ravenous, and in a most
dreadful condition: had my mistress been dead, as
much as I loved her, I am certain I should have
eaten a piece of her flesh, with as much relish, and
as unconcerned, as ever I did the flesh of any crea-
ture appointed for food; and, once or twice, I was
@0ng to bite my own arm. At last, I saw the
bason, in which was the blood I had bled at my
nose the day before: I ran to it, and swallowed it
with such haste, and such a greedy appetite, as if I
had wondered nobody had taken it before, and
afraid it should be taken from me now.

' Though after it was down, the thOughts of it
filled me with horror, yet it checked the fit of hun-
ger; and I drank a draught of fair water, and was
composed and refreshed for some hours after it.
This was the fourth day, and thus I held it till
towards night, when within the compass of three
hours, I had all the several circumstances over
again, one after another; viz. sick, sleepy, eagerly
hungry. pain in the stomach, then ravenous again,
then sick again, then lunatic, then crying, then ra-
venous again; and so every quarter of an hour:
and my strength wasted exceedingly. At night I
laid me down, having no comfort, but in the hope
that I should die before morning.

' All this night I had no sleep, but the hunger
was now turned into a disease, and I had a terri-

ble cholic'aud griping; wind, instead of food, hav;
ing found its way into the bowels: and in this con.
dition I lay till morning, when I was surprised a
little with the cries and lamentations of my young
master, who called out to me that his mother was
dead. I lifted myself up a little, for I had not
strength to rise, but found she was not dead.
though she was able to give very little signs of
life.

' I had then such convulsions in my stomach, for
want of some sustenance, that I cannot describe
them, with such frequent throes and pangs of ap-
petite, that nothing but the tortures of death can
imitate. And this condition I was in, when I
heard the seamen above cry out, A sail! a sail!
and halloo and jump about as if they were dis-
tracted. . -

' I was not able to get of? from the bed, and my
mistress much less; and my young master was so
sick, that I thought he had been expiring: so we
could not open the cabin door, or get any account
what it was that occasioned such a combustion.
Nor had we had any conversation with the ship's
company for two days. they having told us that
they had not a mouthful of any thing to eat in the
ship; and they told' us afterwards they thought we
had been dead. I

' It was this dreadful condition we were in
when you were sent to save our lives ; and how
you found us, sir, you know as well as I, and bet-
ter too.'

This was her own relation, and is such a distinct
account of starving to death, as I confess, I never
met with, and was exceedingly entertaining to me. I
am the rather apt to believe it to be a true account,
because the youth gave me an account of a good
part of it; though I must own, not so distinct, and
so feelingly as his maid; and the rather because,
it seems, his mother fed him at the price of her
own life. But the poor maid, though her constitu-
tion being stronger than that of her mistress, who

1
was in years, and a weakly woman too, she might
struggle harder with it; I say, the poor maid
might be supposed to feel the extremity something
sooner than her mistress, who might be allowed to
keep the last bits something longer than she parted
with any to relieve the maid. No question, as the
case is here related, if our ship, or some other, had
not so providentially met them, a few days more
would have ended all their lives; unless they had
prevented it by eating one another: and even that,
as their case stood, would have served them but
a little while, they being five hundred leagues from
any land, or any. possibility of relief, other than in
the miraculous manner it happened. But this is
by the way. I return to my disposition of things
among the people.

And, first, it is to be observed here, that, for
many reasons I did not think fit to let them know
any thing of the sloop 1 had framed, and which I
thought of setting up among them; for I found, at
least at my first coming, such seeds of divisions
among them, that I saw plainly had I set up the
sloop, and left it among them, they would, upon
every light disgust, have separated and gone away
from one another, or,-perhaps, have turned pirates,
and so made the island a den of thieves, instead of
a plantation of sober and religious people, as I in-
tended it to be ; nor did I leave the two pieces of
brass cannon that 1 had on board. or the two quaro
ter-deck guns, that my nephew took extraordinary,
for the same reason. I thought they had enough to
qualify them for a defensive war against any that
Should invade them ; but 1 was not to set them up
for an offensive War, or to encourage them to go
abroad to attack others, which,, in the end, would
Only bring ruin and destruction upon themselves,
and all their undertakings. I reserved the sloop.
therefore, and the guns, for their service another
Way, as I shall observe in its place.

I have'now done with the island. I left them
all in good circumstances, and in a flourishing cou'
dition, and went on board my ship again the fifth
day of May, having been five~and.twenty days
among them ; and, as they were all resolved to stay
upon the island till I came to remove them, I pro-
mised to send some further relief from the Brasils,
if I could possibly find an opportunity; and par-
ticularly I promised to send them some cattle,
such as sheep, hogs, and cows: for, as to the two
cows and calves which I brought from England,
we had been obliged, by the length of our voyage,
to kill them at sea, for want of hay to feed them.

The next day giving them a salute of five guns
at parting, we set sail, and arrived at the bay of
All-Saints, in the Brasils,in about twenty-two days;
meeting nothing remarkable in our passage but
this, that about three days after we sailed, being
becalmed, and the current setting strong to the E.
N. E. running. as it were, into a bay or gulf, on
the land side, we were driven something out of our
course ; and once or twice our men cried, ' Land to
the westward ;' but whether it was the continent, or
islands, we could not tell by any means.

But the third day, towards evening, the sea
smooth, and the weather calm, we saw the sea, as
it were, covered, towards the land, with something
very black, not being able to discover what it waS;
but after some time, our chief mate going up the
main shrouds a little way, and looking at them
with a perspective, cried out, it was an army. I
could not imagine what he meant by an army, and
spoke a little hastily, calling the fellow a fool, 01'
some such word. ' Nay, sir,' said he, ' do not be
angry; for it is an army, and a fleet too: for, I be-
lieve there are a thousand canoes, and you may see
them paddle along, and they are coming towards
us too apace, and full of men.'

I was a little surprised then, indeed, and 50
was my nephew, the captain: for he had heard
terrible stories of them in the island, and, haw
ing never been in those seas before, he could
not tell what to think of it, but said, two or three
times, we should all be devoured. I must confess,
considering we were becalmed, and the current set
strong towards the shore, I liked it the worse.
However, I bade him not to be afraid, but bring the
ship to an anchor, as soon' as we came so near as to
know that we must engage them.

The weather continued calm, and they came on
apace towards us; so I gave orders to come to an
anchor, and furl all our sails. As for the savages,
I told them they had nothing to fear but fire; and
therefore they should get their boats out, and
fasten them, one close by the head, and the other
by the stern, and man them both well, and wait
the issue in that posture. This I did that the
men in the boats might be ready, with sheets and
buckets, to put out any fire these savages might en-
deavour to fix upon the outside of the ship.

in this posture we lay by for them,and,in a little
while, they came up with us; but never was such a
horrid sight seen by Christians. My mate was
much mistaken in his calculation of their number, I
mean of a thousand canoes; the most we could
make of them when they came up, being about a
hundred and six and-twenty, and a great many of
them too; for some of them had sixteen or seven-
teen men in them, some more; and the least six
at seven. .

When they came nearer to us, they seemed to
be struck with wonder and astonishment, as at a
Si.'lht which they had, doubtless, never seen before;
nC'r could they at first, as we afterwards under-
stood, know what to make of us. They came
boldly up, however, very near to us, and seemed
to go about, to row round us; but we called to
our men in the boats, not.to let them come too
near them.

' .This very order brought us to an engagement
With them, Without our designing it 3 for five or six
of their large canoes came so near our long boat,
that our men beckoned with their hands to them to
keep back, which they understood very well, and
went back; but, at their rctreat, about fifty aro
rows came on board us from those boats, and
one of our men in the long boat was very much
wounded.

However, I called to them not to fire by any
means; but we handed down some deal boards into
the boat, and the carpenter presently set up a kind
of a fence, like waste boards, to cover them from
the arrows of the savages, if they should shoot
again.

About half an hour afterwards they came all up
in a body astern of us, and pretty near, so near
that we could easily discern what they were,
though we could not tell their design. I easily
found they were some of my old friends, the same
sort of savages that I had been used to engage
with: and, in a little time more, they rowed some-
what farther out to sea, till they came directly
broadside with us, and then rowed down straight
upon us, till they came so near, that they could
hear us speak. Upon this, I ordered all my men
to keep close, lest they should shoot any more are
rows, and make all our guns ready; but, being so
near as to be within hearing, I made Friday go out
upon the deck, and call out aloud to them in his
language to know what they meant, which accord-
ingly he did. Whether they understood him or
not. that I knew not; but as soon as he had called
to them, six of them. who were in the foremost or
nighest boat to us, turned their canoes from us,
and stooping down, showed us their naked back-
sides; just as if, in English (saving your presence),
they had bade us kiss ...Whether this was a de-
fiance, or challenge, we know not; or whether it was
done in more contempt, or as a signal to the rest,
but immediately Friday cried out, they were going
to shoot; and unhappily for him, poor fellow!
they let fly about three hundred of their arrows,
and, to my inexpressible grief, killed poor Friday,
no other man being in their sight. The poor fellow
was shot with no less than three arrows, and about
three more fell very nigh him ; such unlucky marks-
men they were.

I was so enraged with the loss of my old servant,
the companion of all my sorrows and solitudes,
that I immediately ordered five guns to be loaded
with small shot, and four with great, and gave them
such a broadside as they had never heard in their
lives before, to be sure.

They were not above half a cable's length of?.
when we fired; and our gunners took their aim
so well, that three or four of their canoes were
overset, as we had reason to believe, by one shot
only.

The ill manners of turning up their bare back-
sides to us, gave us no great offence; neither did
I know for certain whether that which would pass
for the greatest contempt among us, might be un--
derstood so by them, or not; therefore, in return, I
had only resolved to have fired four or five guns,
with powder only, which I knew would frightrthem
sufliciently. But when they shot at us directly,
with all the. fury they were capable of, and espe-
cially as they had killed my poor Friday, whom I
SO entirely loved and valued, and who indeed so
well deserved it; 1 not only had been justified
before God and man, but would have been very
glad, if I could, tohave overset every canoe there,
and drowned every one of them.

I can neither tell how many we killed, nor how
many we. wounded, at this broadside; but sure
such a fright and hurry never was seen among such
a multitude: there were thirteen or fourteen of
their canoes split, and overset, in all, and the men
all set a swimming; the rest, frighted out of their
Wits, scoured away as fast as they could, taking
but little care to save those whose boats-were Split
or spoiled with our shot. So I suppose that-there
were many of them-lost. And our men took up
one poor fellow swimming for his life, above an
hour after they were all gone.

Our small shot, from our cannon, must needs kill
and wound a great many; but, in short, we never
knew any thing howit went with them, for they fled
so fast, that, in three hours or thereabouts, we
could not see above three or four straggling canoes;
nor did we ever see the rest any more, for a breeze
of wind springing up the same evening, we weighed,
and set sail for the Brasils.

We had a prisoner indeed, but the creature was
so sullen, thathe would neither eat nor speak, and
we all fancied he would starve himself to death.
But I took a way to cure him, for I made them
take him, and turn him into the long boat, and
make him believe they would toss him into the
sea again, and so leave him where they found him,
if he would not Speak; nor Would that do, but
they really did throw him into the sea, and came
away from him, and then he followed them, for he
swam like a cork, and called to them in his
tongue, though they knew not one word of what he
said. However, at last, they took him in again,
and then he began to be more tractable; nor didI
ever design they should drown him.

We were now under sail again; but I was the
most disconsolate creature alive, for want of my
man Friday, and would have been very glad to
have gone back to the island, to have taken one of
the rest from thence for my occasion, but it could
not be so: so we went on. We had one prisoner,
as 1 have said, and it was a long while before we
could make him understand any thing; but, in
time, our men taught him some English, and he
began to be a little tractable. Afterwards we in-
quired what country he came from, but could make
nothing of what he said, for his speech was so
odd, all gutturals, and spoken in the throat in such
a hollow and odd manner, that we could never .
form a word from him; and we were all of opinion
that they might speak that language as well if
they were gagged, as otherwise; nor could we per.
ceive that they had any occasion either for teeth,
tongue, lips, or palate; but formed their words
just as a hunting-horn forms a tune, with an Open
throat. He told us, however, some time after,
when we had taught him to speak a little English,
that they were going with their kings to fight a
great battle. When he said kings, we asked him
how many kings. He said there were five nation
(we could not make him understand the plural s),
and that they all joined to go against two nation.
We asked him, what made them come up to us. He
said, ' to makee te great wonder look.' Where
it is to be observed, that all those natives, as
also those of Africa, when they learn English, they
always add two e's at the end of the words where
We use one, and place the accent upon them, as
' makee,takee,' and the like; and we could not
break them of it ; nay, I could hardly make Friday
leave it off, though at last he did.

And now 1 name the poor fellow'once more, Imust
take my last leave of him. Poor honest Friday! we
buried him with all the decency and solemnity pos-
sible, by putting him into a coffin, and throwing him
into the sea; and I caused them to fire eleven guns
for him: and so ended the life of the most grateful,
faithful, honest, and most affectionate servant that
ever man had.

We now went away with a fair wind for Brasil ;
and in about twelve days' time we made land, in
the latitude of five degrees south of the line, being
the north-easternmost land of all that part of Ame-
rIca. We kept on S. by E. in sight of the shore
four days, when we made the cape Saint Augus-
t'nc: and in three days came to an anchor off the
bay 0f All-Saints, the old place of my deliverance,
ftorn whence came both my good and evil fate.
Never ship came to this part that had less busi-
ness than I had, and yet it was with great difficulty
that we were admitted to hold the least correspond-
ence on shore. Not my partner himself, who was
alive, and made a great figure among them; notmy
two merchant-trustees, nor the fame of my won-
derful preservation in the island, could obtain me
that favour: but my partner, remembering thatl
had given five hundred moidores to the prior of the
monastery of the Augustines, and three hundred
and seventy-two to the poor, went to the mom.
stery, and obliged the prior that then was, to g0
to the governor, and get leave for me presently.
with the captain, and one more, besides eight sea-
men, to come on shore, and no more: and this
upon condition, absolutely capitulatod for, that we
should not offer to land any goods out of the ship,
or to carry any person away without licence.

They were so strict with us, as to landing any
goods, that it was with extreme difficulty thatI
got on shore three bales of English goods, such as
fine broadcloths, stuffs, and some linen, which [had
brought for a present to my partner.

He was a very generous, broad-hearted man.
though (like me) he came from little at first; and
though he knew not that I had the least design of
giving him any thing. he sent me on board a pre-
sent of fresh provisions, wine, and sweatmeatS,
worth 'above thirty moidores, including some [0- .
bacco, and three or four fine medals in gold. BlIt
I was even with him in my presents, which, 351
have said, consisted of fine broadcloth, EngliSh
stuffs, lace, and fine hollands. Also I delivered
him about the value of one hundred pounds ster-
ling, in the same goods, for other uses; andl
obliged him to set up the sloop which I had brought
with me from England, as I have said, for the use
of my colony, in order to send the refreshments I
intended to my plantation. .

Accordingly he got hands, and finished the 5100?
ROBINSON CRUSOE. 505

in a very few days, for she was already framed,
and I gave. the master of her such instructions as
he could not miss the place; nor did he miss it, as
I had an account from my partner afterwards. I
got him soon loaded with the small cargo I had
sent them; and one of our seamen, that had been
on shore with me there, offered to go with the
sloop, and settle there, upon my letter to the go-
vernor Spaniard, to allot him a sufficient quantity
of land for a plantation: ;-and giving him some
clothes, and tools for his plantingwork, which he
said he understood, having been an old planter in
Maryland, and a buccaneer into the bargain.

I encouraged the fellow, by granting all be de-
sired; and, as an addition, I gave him the savage
which we had taken prisoner of war, to be his
slave; and ordered the governor Spaniard to give
him his share of every thing he wanted with the
rest.

When we came to fit this man out, my old part-
ner told me there was a certain very honest fellow,
a Brasil planter of his acquaintance, who had fallen
into the displeasure of the church, ' I know not
what the matter is with him',' says he, ' but, on my
conscience, I think he is a heretic in his heart; and
he has been obliged to conceal himself for fear of
the Inquisition; that he would be very glad of
such an opportunity to make his escape, with his
wife and two daughters ; and if I would let them
80 to my island, and allot them a plantation, he
would give them a small stock to begin with; for
the officers of the Inquisition had seized all his
effects and estate, and he had nothing left but a.
little household stufi', and two slaves. And,' adds
he, ' though I hate his principles, yet I would not
have him falliuto their hands; for he will assuredly
be burnt alive, if he.docs.'

I granted this presently, and joined my English--
men with them; and we concealed the man, and
his wife and daughters, on board our ship, till. the

Z
sloop put out to go to sea; and then (having put
all their goods on board the sloop some time before)
we put them on board the sloop, after she was go:
out of the bay.

Our seaman was mightily pleased with this new
partner; and their stock indeed was much alike
rich in tools, in preparations, and a farm, but 3
nothing to begin with, but as above. However, they '
'carried over with them (which was worth all the
rest) some materials for planting sugar-canes, with
some plants of canes, which he, I mean the Portugal
man, understood very well.

Among the rest of the supplies sent my tenants
in the island, I sent them, by this sloop, three
milch cows, and five calves, about twenty-two hogS'
among them, three sows big with pig, two mares:
and a stone-horse. ,

For my Spaniards, according to my promise, I
engaged three Portugal women to go; and recom-
mended it to them to marry them, and use them
kindly. I could have procured more women, butl
remembered that the poor persecuted man had two
daughters, and there were but five of the Spaniards
that wanted: the rest had wives of their own:
though in another country.

All this cargo arrived safe, and, as you ma]
easily suppose, very welcome to my old inhabit-
ants, who were now (with this addition) between
sixty and seventy people, besides little children.
of which there were a great many. 1 found letters
at London from them, all by way of Lisbon, wheul
came back to England,- bei'ng Sent back to the Bradeg
sils, by this sloop: of which I shall take some 110'
tice in its place.

I have now done with my island, and all manner
of discourse about it; and whoever reads the mil:
of my memorandums would do well to turn 1H5
thoughts entirely from it, and expect to read 00'}
of the follies of an old man, not warned by "'5
own harms, much less by those of other men; to
beivare of the like: not cooled by almost forty
years of misery and disappointments; not satis-
fied with prosperity beyond expectation ; not made
cautious by affliction and distress beyond imitation.

I had no more business to go to the East Indies
than a man at full liberty, and having committed
no crime, has to go to the turnkey at Nev/gate, and
desire him to lock him "up among the prisoners
there, and starve him. Had I taken a small vessel
from England, and went directly to the island; had
I loaded her, as I did the other vessel, With all the
necessaries for the plantation, and, for my people,
took a patent from the government here, to have
secured my property, in subjection only to that of
England, which, to be sure, I might have obtained;
had I carried over cannon and ammunition, serv.
"MS, and people'to plant, and, taking possession of
the place, fortified and strengthened it, in the
name of England, and increased it with people, as
I might easily have done; had I then settled my~
self there, and sent the ship back, loa'den with' good
rice, as I might also have done in six months'
time, and ordered my friends to have fitted her out
again for our supply; had I done this. and staid
there myself, I had, at least, acted like a man of
common sense: but I was possessed with a web-
dering spirit, scorned all advantages, pleased my-
self with being the patron of these people I had
placed there, and doing for them in a kind of
haughty, majestic way, like an old patriarchal mo-
narch: providing for them, as if I had been father
of the whole family, as well as of the plantation.
But I never so much as pretended to plant in the
name of any government or nation, or to acknow.
ledge any prince, or to call my people subjects to
any one nation more than another; nay, I never so
much as gave the place a name, but left it as I
found it, belonging to no man, and the people un-
der no discipline or government but my own, Who,
"mush I had an influence over them as father
and benefactor, had no authority or power to act
or command, one way or other, farther than volun-
tary consent moved them to comply: yet even
this, had I staid there, would have done well
enough; but as I rambled from them, and came
thither no more, the last letters I had. from any of
them were by my partner's means, who afterwards
sent another sloop to the place, and who sent me
word, though Ihad not the letter till five years
after it was written, that they went on but poorly;
were malcontent with their long stay there; that
Will Atkins was dead; that {we of the Spaniards
were come away; and that though they had not
been much molested by. -'the savages, yet they had
had some skirmishes with them ; that they begged
of him to write to me, to think of the promise!
had made to fetch them away, that they might see
their own country again, before they died.

But 1 was gone a wild-goose chase indeed, and
they who will have any more of me,.must be con.
tent to follow me through a new variety of follies,
hardships, and wild adventures, wherein the justice
of Providence may be duly observed,~and we may
see how easily Heaven can gorge us with our own
desires, make the strongest of our wishes to be our
affliction, and punish us most severely with those
very things which we think it would be our utmost
happiness to be allowed in.

Let no wise man flatter himself with-the strength
of his own judgment, as if he was able to choose
any particular station of life for himself. Man is
a short-sighted creature, sees but a very little way
before him ; and as his passions are none of his best
friends, so his particular affections are generally his
worst counsellors. _ '

I say this, with respect to the impetuous desire
I had, from a youth, to wander into the world; _
and how evident it now was, that this prill'iiPl.e
was preserved in me for my punishment. How It
came on, the manner, the circumstance, and. the
conclusion of it, it is easy to give you historically,
and with its utmost variety of particulars. But the
secret ends of Divine Providence, in thus permit-
ting us to be hurried down the stream of our own .
desires, are only to be understood of those who can
listen to the voice of Providence, and draw religious
consequences from God's justice, and their own
mistakes.

Be it I had business, or no business, away I
went; it is no time now to enlarge any farther
upon the reason or absurdity of my own conduct:
but, to come to the history, I was embarked for the
\'0yage, and the voyage I went. '

I should only add here, that my honest and truly
pious clergyman left me here; a ship being ready
to go to Lisbon, he asked me leave to go thither,
being still, as he observed, bound never to finish
any voyage he began. How happy had it been for
me, if I had gone with him !

But it was too late now: all things Heaven ap-
points are best. Had I gone with him, I had never
had so many things to be thankful for, and you
had never heard of the second part of the travels
and adventures of Robinson Crusoe; so I must
leave here the fruitless exclaiming at myself, and
30 on with my voyage.

From the Brasils we made directly away over the
Atlantic Sea, to the Cape de Bonne ESperance, or,
. as we call it, the Cape of Good Hope; and had a

tolerable good voyage, our course generally south-
east: now and then a storm, and some contrary
Winds. But my disasters at sea were at an end:
"'1' future rubs and cross events were to befal
me on shore, that it might appear the land was as
Well prepared to be our scourge as the sea, when
Heaven, who directs the circumstances of things,
Pleases to appoint it to be so.

Our ship was on a trading voyage, and had a
sPPercargo on board, who was to direct all her mo-
tions, after she arrived at the Cape, only being
limited to certain numbers of days for stay, by
charterparty, at the several ports she was to go to._
This was none of my business, neither did I meddle
with it at all ; my nephew, the captain, and the
' supercurgo, adjusting all those things between
them, as they thought fit.

We made no stay at the Cape, longer than was
needful to take in fresh water, but made the best of
our way for the coast of Coromandel: we were in-
deed informed that a French man of war. of fifty
guns, and two large merchant ships, were gone
for the Indies ; and as I knew we were at war with
France, I had some apprehensions of them; but
they went their own way, and we heard no more of
them.

I shall' not pester my account, or the reader>>
with descriptions of places, journals of our voyages.
variations of the compass, latitudes, meridian di-
stances, trade--winds, situation of ports, and the
like; such as almost all the histories of long navi-
gation are full of, and which make the reading tirc-
some enough, and are perfectly unprofitable to all
that read, except only to those who are to go to
those places themselves.

It is enough to name the ports and places which
we touched at; and what occurred to us upon our
passing from one to another. We touched iirstat
the island of Madagascar, where, though the p00!
ple are fierce and treacherous. and, in particular.
very well armed with lances and bows, which they
use with inconceivable dexterity; yet we fared very
well with them a while: they treated us very
civilly, and, for some trifles which we gave them;
such as knives, scissars, 85c, they brought us eleven
good fat bullocks, middling in size, but very gm}!
in flesh, which we took in, partly for fresh pl'on'
sions for our present spending, and the rest to salt
for the ship's use. '

We were obliged to stay here for some time after
We had furnished ourselves with provisions; and I,
that was always too curious to look into every
nook of the world wherever I came, was for going
on shore as often as I could. It was on the east
side of the island that we went on shore one
evening, and the people, who, by the way, are very
numerous, came thronging about us. and stood gaz-
ing at us, at a distance. As we had traded freely
with them, and had been kindly used, we thought
ourselves in no danger; but when we saw the peo-
ple, we cut three boughs out of a tree, and stuck
them up at a distance from us, which, it seems, is
a mark in that country, not only of truce and friends
ship, but when it is accepted, the other side set up
three poles, or boughs, also, which is a signal that
they accept the truce too ; but then .this is a known
condition of the truce, that you are not to pass be-
yond their three poles towards them, nor they
come past your three poles, or boughs. towards
you ; so that you are perfectly secure within the
three poles, and all the space between your poles
and theirs is allowed like a market, for free con~
verse, traflic, and commerce. When you go thither,
you must not carry your weapons with you; and
if they come into that space, they stick up their
Jm'elins and latices all at the first poles, and come
on unarmed: but if any violence is ofl'ered them,
and the truce thereby broken, away they run to the
Poles. and lay hold of their weapons, and then the
truce is at an end.

It happened one eveningywhen we went on shore,
that a greater number of their people came down
than usual, but were all very friendly and civil.
They brought with them several kinds of provisions,
for which we satisfied them with such toys as we
had : their women also brought us milk and roots,
and several things very acceptable to us; and all
was quiet. And we made us a little tent, or hut,
0f Tome boughs of trees, and lay on shore all that:
Big it.

lknow net what was the occasion, but I was not
so well satisfied to lie on shore as the rest; and
the boat lying at an anchor, about a stone's cast
from the land, with two men in her to take care of
her, I made one of them come on shore, and,
getting some boughs of trees to cover us also in
the boat, I spread the sail on the bottom of the
boat, and lay on board, under the cover of the
branches of the trees all night.

About two o'clock in the morning we heard one
of our men making a terrible noise on the shore,
calling out, for God's sake, to bring the boat in,
and come and help them, for they were all like to
be murdered: at the same time I heard the firing
of five muskets, which was the number of the guns
they had, and that three times over: for, it seems,
the natives 'here were not so easily frighted with
guns as the savages were in America, where I had
to do with them. .

All this while I knew not what was the matter.
but rousing immediately from sleep with the noise.
I caused the boat to be thrust in, and resolved,
with three fusils we had on board, to land, and
assist our men.

We got the boat soon to the shore, but our
men werelin too much haste; for being come to
the shore, they plunged into the water, to get to
the boat with all the expedition they could, being
pursued by between three and four hundred men.
Our men were but nine in all, and only five Of
them had fusils with them : the rest indeed had pis-
tols and swords, but they were of small use to them.

We took up seven of our men, and with diffi-
culty enough too, three of them being very ill
wounded; and that which was still worse was, that
while we stood in the boat to take our men in,
we were in as much danger as they were in on
shore, for they poured their arrows in upon "5
so thick, that we were fain to barricade the side
of the boat up with the benches, and two or three
loose boards, which, to our great satisfaction, we
had, by mere accident, or Providence rather, in the
boat.

And yet, had it been daylight, they are. it seems,
such exact marksman, that if they could have seen
but the least part of any of us, they would have been
Sure of us. We had, by the light of the moon, a
little sight of them, as they stood pelting us from
the shore with darts and arrows; and having got
ready our fire-arms, we gave them a'volley, and we
could hear by the cries of some of them, that we
had wounded several. However, they stood thus
in battle-array on the shore till break of day, which
we suppose was, that they might see the better to
take their aim at us.

In this condition we lay, and could not tell how

. to weigh our anchor, or set up our sail. because we
must needs stand up in the boat, and they were as
sure to hit us as we were to hit a bird in a tree
with small shot We made signals of distress to
the ship, which, though she rode a league ofi', yet
my nephew, the captain, hearing our firing, and, by
glasses, perceiving the posture we lay in, and that
we fired towards the shore, pretty well understood
"5; and weighing anchor with all Speed, he stood
as near the shore as he durst with the ship, and
'then sent Another boat, with ten hands in her, to
assist us; but we called to them not to come too
near, telling them what condition we were in.
However, they stood in nearer to us : and one of
the men, taking the end of a towoline in his hand,
and keeping our boat between him and the enemy,
so that they could not perfectly see him, swam on
board us, and made fast the line to the-boat, upon
which we slipped our little cable; and, leaving our
anchor behind, they towed us out of the reach of
the arrows, we all the while lying close behind the
barricado we had made.

As soon as we were got from between the ship
and the share, that she could lay her side to the
shore, we ran along just by them, and we poured

Z 2
in a broadside among them, loaden with pieces of
iron and lead, small bullets, and such stufi", besides
the great shot, which made a terrible>> havoc among
them';

When we were got on board, and out of danger,
we had time to examine into the occasion of this
fray: and indeed our supercargo, who had been
often in those par-ts, put me upon it; for he said
he was sure the inhabitants would not have touch.
ed us. after we had made a truce, if we had not
done something to provoke them to it. At length
.it came one, viz. that an old woman, who had
come to sell us some milk, had brought it within
our poles. with a young woman with her, who also
brought some roots or herbs; and while the old we
man (whether she was mother to the young woman
or no, they could not tell) was selling us the milk,
one of our men offered some rudeness to the
wench that was with her, at which the old woman
made a great noise. However, the seaman would
not quit his prize, but carried her, out of the old
woman's sight, among the trees, it: being almost
dark; the old woman went away without her, and,
as we suppose, made an outcry among the people
she came from, who, upon notice. raised this great
army upon us, in three or four hours: and it was
great odds- but we had been all destroyed.

One of our men was killed-with-a lance that was
thrown at him, just at the beginning of the attack,
,as he sallied out of the tent we had made; tllb
rest came of? free, all but the fellow who was the
occasion of all the mischief, who paid dear enough
for his black mistress, for we could not hear what
became of him a great while. We lay upon. the
shore two days after. though the wind presented.
and made signals for him; made our boat 38"
UP shore, and down shore, several leagues, but in
vain. So we were obliged to give him over; 3""
if he alone had suffered. for it, the loss had been
the less.
I could not satisfy myself, however, withOut
venturing on shore once more to try if I could
learn any thing of him or them. It was the third
night after the action that I had a great mind to
learn, if I could, by any means, what mischief we
had done, and how the game stood on the Indian
side. I was careful to do it in the dark, lest we
should be attacked again; but I ought indeed to
have been sure, that the men I went with had been
under my command, before I engaged in a thing sci
hazardous and mischievous, as I was brought into it
without my knowledge or design.

We took twenty stout fellows with us as any in
the ship, besides the supercargo and myself; and
we landed two hours before midnight, at the same
place where the Indians stood drawn up the even-
ing before. I landed here, because my design, as
I have said, was chiefly to see if they had quitted
the field, and if they had left any marks behind
them, or of the mischief we had done them; and I.
thought, if we could surprise one or two of them,
perhaps we might get our man again, by way of _
exchange.

We landed without any noise, and divided our
men into two companies, whereof the boatswain
commanded one, and I the other. We; neither
could hear, nor see any body stir, when we landed;
so we marched up, one body at a distance from the
Other, to the field of battle. At first we could see
nOthing, it being very dark; but, by and by, our
boatswain, that led the first party, stumbled, and
fell over a dead body. This made them halt a
while; for, knowing by the circumstance, that they
were at the place where the Indians had stood,
they waited for my comingxup. Here we conclud-
ed to halt till the moon began to rise, which we
knew would be in less than an hour; and then
we could easily discern the havoc we had made
""038 them. We told two-and-thirty bodies upon
the ground, whereof two were not quite dead. Some
had an arm, and some a leg shot ofi', and one his
head. Those that were wounded, we supposed they
had carried away.

When we had made, as I thought, a full dis-
covery of all we could come at the knowledge of.
I was for going on board again; but the boatswain
and his party often sent me word, that they were
resolved to make a visit to the Indian town, where
these dogs, as they called them, dwelt; and dc:
sired me to go along with them: and if they could
find them, as they still fancied they should, they
did not doubt, they said, getting a good booty ; and
it might be, they might find Thomas Jeffrys there;
that was the man's name we had lost.

Had they sent to ask my leave to go, I knew
well enough what answer to have given them, for
I would have commanded them instantly on board.
knowing it was not a hazard lit for us to run, who
had a ship, and ship's loading, in our charge, and a
voyage to make, which depended very much upon
the lives of the men; but as they sent me word
they were resolved to go, and only asked me and
my company to go along with them, I positively
refused it: and rose up (for I was sitting on the
ground) in order to go to the boat. One or two of
the men began to importune me to go, and, whenI
still refused positively, began to grumble, and say
they were not under my command, and they would
go. ' Come, Jaek,' says one of the men, ' will you
go with me? I'll go for one.' Jack said he would:
and another followed, and then another, and, in 8
word, they all left me but one, whom, with much
difliculty too, I persuaded to stay; so the supercargo
and 1, with- the third man, went back to the boat:
where] told them we would stay for them, and
take care to take in as many of them as should be
left ; for I told them it was a mad thing they were
going about, and supposed most of them would run
the fate'of Thomas Jellrys.

They told me, like seamen, they would wane!"g
it they'would come off again, and they would take
care, 8m. 80 away they went. 1 entreated them
to consider the ship, and the voyage; that their
lives were not their own, and that they were in-
trusted with the voyage, in some measure; that if.
they miscarried, the ship might be lost for want of
their help, and that they could not answer it to
God and man. I said a great deal more to them
on that head, butI might as well have talked to
the maimnast of the ship: they were mad upon their
journey, only they gave me good words, and begged
I would not be angry; said they would be very cau--
tions, and that they did not doubt but they. would
be back again in about an hour at farthest; for the
Indian town, they said, was not above half a mile
oil": though they found it above two miles before
they got to it.

Well, they all went away, as. above; and though
the attempt was desperate, and such as none but
madmen would have gone about, yet, to give them
their due, they went about it warily, as well as
boldly. They were gallantly armed, that is true,
for they had every man a fusil, or musket, a-bay-
onet, and every man a pistol. Some of them
had broad cutlasses, some of them hangers; and
the boaLSWain, and two more, had pole-axes: be-
sndes all which, they had among them thirteen
hfmd'grenadoer:. Bolder fellows, and better pro-
vxded, never went about any wicked work in the
World.

When they went out, their chief design was plun-
der, and they were in mighty hopes of finding gold
"We; buc a circumstance, which none of them
were aware of, set them on fire with revenge, and
made devils of them all. When they came to the
few Indian houses, which they thought had been
the town, which were not above half a mile ofl',
they were under a great disappointment, for there
Were not above twelve or thirteen houses, and
where the town was, or how big, they knew not.
They consulted, therefore, what to do, and were
some time before they could resolve ;' for if they
fell upon these, they must cut all their throats, and
it was ten to one but some of them might escape, it
being in the night, though the moon was up, and
if one escaped, he would run away and raise all
the town, so they should have a whole army upon
them. Again, on the other hand, if they went
away, and left those untouched (for 'the peeple
were all asleep), they could not tell which way to
look for the town.

However, the last was the best advice; so they
resolved to leave those houses, and look for the
town as well as they could. They went on a little
way, and found a cow tied to a tree: this they pre-
sently concluded would beat good guide to them,
for they said the cow certainly belonged to the
town before them, or the town behind them: and
if they untied her, they should see which way she
went: if she went back, they had nothing to say to
her; but, if she went forward, they had nothing to
do but to follow her. So they cut the.cord, which
was made of twisted flags, and the cow went on
before them. In a word, the cow led them di-
rectly to the town, which, as they reported, con-
sisted of above two hundred houses, or huts ; and,
in some of these, they found several families living
together. .

Here they found all silent, as profoundly secure
as sleep, and a .country that had never seen an
enemy of that kind, could make them. Upon this
they called another council, to consider what they
had to do, and, in a word, they resolved to divide
themselves into three bodies, and to set three
houses on fire, in three parts of the town; and as
the men came out, to seize them and bind them; if
any resisted, they need not be asked what to do
then: and so to search the rest of the houses for
plunder; but they resolved to march silently first
through the town, and see what dimensions it was
of, and consider if they might venture upon it,
or no.

They did so, and desperately resolved that they
would venture upon them; but while they were
animating one another to the work, three of them
that were a little before the rest, called out aloud,
and told them that they had found Thomas Jef-
frys. They all ran up to the place, and so it was
indeed ; for there they found the poor fellow hang-
ed up, naked, by one arm, and his throat cut.
There was an lndian house just by the tree, where
they found sixteen or seventeen of the principal
Indians who had been concerned in the fray with
us before, and two or three of them wounded with
our shot; and our men found they were awake,
and talking one to another in that house, but knew
not their number.

The sight of their poor, mangled comrade so en-
raged-them, as before, that they swore to one'ano-
ther they would be revenged, and that not an In-
dian who came into their hands should have quar-
ter: and to work they went immediately; and yet
not so madly as, by the rage and fury they were in,
miEht be expected. Their first care was to get
something that would soon take fire; but after a
little search, they found that would be to no pur-
P038, fOr most of the houses were low, and thatch-
ed with flags or rushes, of which the country is
full. 80 they presently made some wildfire, as we
call it. by wetting a little powder, in the palms of
their hands, and, in a quarter of an hour, they set
the town on fire, in four or five places; and par-
ticularly that house where the lndians were not
gone to bed. As soon as the fire began to blaze,
the poor, frighted creatures began to rush out to
save their lives; but met with their fate in the at-
tempt. and especially at the door, where they drove
them back, the boatswain himself killing one or
No with his pole-axe: the house being large, and
"'3"! in it, he did not care to go in, but called for
ahand-grenado, and threw it among them, which,
at first,- frighted them; but when it burst, made
such havoc among them, that they cried out in a
hideous manner. ~

In short, most of the Indians who were in the
'open part of the house, were killed or hurt with
the grenado,- except two or three more, who press-
'ed to the door, which the boatswain, and two more,
kept with their bayonets in the muzzles of their
pieces, and dispatched all who came that way. But
there was another apartment in the house, where
the prince, or king, or whatever he was, and sew
ral others, were; and these they kept in till the
house, which was, by this time, all of a light flame,
fell in upon them, and they were smothered, o'r
burned together.

All this while they fired not a gun, because they
would not waken the people faster than they could
master them; but the tire. began to wakcn them
fast enough, and ourrfe'llows were glad to keep8
little together in bodies, for the fire grew so raging.
all the houses being made of light, combustible
stuff, that they could hardly hear the street be.
tween them: and their business was to follow the
fire for the surer execution. As fast as the fire
either forced the people out of those houses which
were burning, or frighted them out of others, our
people were ready at their doors to knock them
on the head, still calling and hallooing to one ano-
ther to remember Thomas J effrys.

While this was doing, I must confess I was very
uneasy, and especially when I saw the flames of
the town, which, it being night, seemed to be just
by me. ' '

My nephew, the captain, who was roused by his
men too, seeing such a fire, was very uneasy, not
knowing what the matter was, or what danger .1
was in, eSpecially hearing the guns too; for by this
time, they began to use their lire-arms. A thaw
sand thoughts oppressed his mind concerning me
and the supercargo. what should become of us-
And, at last, though he could ill spare any more
men, yet, not knowing what exigence .we might be
in, he takes another boat, and, with thirteen men
and himself, comes on shore to me.

He was surprised to see me and the supercargo
in the boat, with no more than two men, for one
had been left to keep the boat; and though he was
glad that we were well, yet he was in the same im-
patience with us to know what was doing; for the
noise continued, and the flame increased. In short,
it was next to an impossibility for any men in the
world to restrain their curiosity of knowing what
had happened, or their concern for the. safety of
the men. In a word, the captain told me he would
30 and help his men, let what would come. 5 I argu-
ed with him, as I did before with the men, the
safety of the ship, the danger of the voyage, the in-
terest of the owners and merchants, 85c. and told
flit". I would go, and the two men, and only see
if we could, at a distance, learn what was like to
be the event, and come back, and tell him.

It was all one to talk to my nephew, as it was to
talk to the rest before. He would go, he said, and
he only wished he had left but ten men in the
Ship; for he could not think of having his men lost
for want of help: he had rather, he said, lose the
3m?>> the voyage, and his life, and all; and so
away went he.

Nor was I any more able to stay behind now,
film I was to persuade them not to go before; so,
In short, the captain ordered two men to row back
the pinnace, and fetch twelve men more from the
Ship, having the long boat at an anchor, and that
when they came. back, six men should keep the
"90 boats, and six more come after us, so that he
MP only sixteen men in the ship: for the whole
Sh'P's company consisted of sixty-five men, whereof

":0 Were let in the first quarrel, 'whiCh brought
this mischief on.
Being now on the march, you may be sure we
felt little of the ground we trod on, and, being
guided by the fire, we kept no path, but went di-
rectly to the place of the flame. If the noise of
the guns were surprising to us before, the cries of
the. poor people were now quite of another nature,
and filled us with horror. I must confess I never
was at the sacking of a city, or at the taking of a
town by storm; I have heard of Oliver Cromwell
taking Drogheda, in Ireland, and killing man, wo-
man, and child; and I had read of count Tilly
sacking of the city of Magdeburgh, and cutting the
throats of twenty-two thousand, of both sexes; but
I never had an idea of the thing itself before, nor is
it possible to describe it, or the horror which was
upon our minds at hearing it. .

However, we went on, and at length came to the
town, though there was no entering the streets of
it for the fire. The first object we met with was
the ruins of 'a hut, or house, or rather the ashes of
it, for the house was consumed ; and just before it.
plain now to be seen by the light of the fire, lay
four men and three women killed, and, as we
thought, one or two more lay in the heap among
the fire. In short, there were such instances of a
rage altogether barbarous, and of a fury something
beyond what was human, that we thought it impos-
sible our men could be guilty of it; or, if they were
the authors of it, we thought that every one of them
ought to be put to the worst of deaths. But this
was not all: we saw the fire increased forward, and
the cry went onjust as the fire went on, so that we
were in the utmost confusion. We advanced a
little way farther, and beheld, to our astonishment-
three women, naked, crying in a most dreadful
manner, and flying, as if they had indeed had
wings, and after them sixteen or seventeen men,
natives, in the same terror and consternation, with
three of our English butchers (for I can call them
no better) in their rear, who, when they could not
overtake them, fired in among them, and one that
was killed by their shot- fell down in our sight.

When the rest saw us, believing us to be their
' enemies, and that we would murder them, as
well as those that pursued them, they set up a
most dreadful shriek, especially the women; and
two of them fell down as if already dead with the
fright.

My very soul shrunk within me, and my blood
ran chill in my veins, when I saw this ; and, I be-
lieve, had the three English sailors that pursued
them come on, I had made our men kill them all.
However, we took some ways. to let the poor. flying
creatures know that we would not hurt them ; and
immediately they came up to us, and kneeling
down, with their hands lifted up, made piteous la-
mentatiou to us to save them, which we let them
know we would do, whereupon they kept all to-
gether in a huddle, close behind us, for protection.
I left my men drawn up together, and charged
them to hurt nobody, but, if possible, to get at some
of our people, and see. what devil it was possessed
them. and what they intended to (10, and, in a
word, to command them off, assuring them that if
they staid till daylight, they would have a hundred
thousand men about their ears; I say, I left them,
and went among those flying people, taking only
two of our men with me; and there was indeed a.
l'ileous spectacle among them. Some of them had
their feet terribly burned with trampling and run-
ning through the fire; others their hands burned;
0'10 of the women had fallen down in the fire, and
was almost burned to death before she could get
("it again; two or three of the men had cuts in
their backs and thighs, from our men pursuing;
and another was shot through the body, and died
While I was there.

1 would fain have learned what the occasion of
a" this was; but I could not understand one word.
they said, though, by signs, I perceived that some
of them knew not what was the occasion them-
selves. I was so terrified in my thoughts at this
outrageous attempt, that I could not stay there,
but went back to my own men. I told them my
resolution, and commanded them to follow me,
when, in the very moment, came four of our men,
with the boatswain at their head, running over the
heaps of bodies they had killed, all covered with
blood and dust, as if they wanted more people to
massacre, when our men hallooed to them as loud
as they could halloo, and, with much ado, one Of
them made them hear: so that they knew who we
were, and came up to us.- '

As soon as the boatswain saw us, he set up a
halloo, like a shout of triumph, for having, as he
thought, more help come; and, without bearing to
hear me, ' Captain,' says he, ' noble captain, I am
glad you are come: we have not half done yet-
Villains! hell-hound dogs! I'll kill as many of
them as poor Tom has hairs upon his head. We
have sworn to spare none of them: we'll root out
the very nation of them from the earth! ' and thus
he ran on, out of breath too with action, and would
not give us leave to speak a word. .

At last, raising my voice, that I might silence him
a little, ' Barbarous dog!' said I, ' what are you
doing? I won't have one creature touched more;
upon pain of death. I charge you, upon your life;
to stop your hands, and stand still here, or you are
a dead man this minute.' '

' Why, sir,' says he, ' do you know what you do:
or what they have done? If you want a reason {01'
what we have done, come hithen' and with that
he showed me the poor fellow hanging upon a tree.
with his throat cut.

I confess I was urged then myself, and at another
time should have been forward enough; but I
thought they had carried their rage too far, and
thought of Jacob's words to his sons Simeon and
Levi, ' Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; and
their wrath, for it was cruel!' But I had now a
new task upon my hands, for when the men I car.
ried with me, saw the sight. as I had done, I had as
much to do to restrain them, as I should have had
with the others: nay, my nephew himself fell in
with them, and told me, in their hearing. that he
was only concerned for fear of the men being over-
powered ; for, as to the pe0ple, he thought not one
of them ought to live, for they had all glutted
themselves with the murder of the poor man, and
that they ought to be used like murderers. Upon
these words away ran eight of my men, with the
boatswain and his crew, 'to complete their bloody'
work: and I, seeing it quite out of my power to
restrain them, came away pensive and sad; for I
could not bear the sight, much less the horrible
noise and cries of the poor wretches that fell into
their hands.

I got nobody to come back with me, but the
supercargo and two men; and with these I walked
back to the. boats. It was a very great piece of
f0")? in me, I confess, to venture back, as it were,
alone; for as it began now to be almost day, and
the alarm had run over the country, there stood
about forty men, armed \with lances and bows, at
a little place, where the twelve or thirteen houses
5'00", mentioned before; but by accident I missed
the place, and came directly to the sea-side, and
by that time I got to the sea-side, it was broad day.
Immediately I took the pinnace, and went aboard.
and sent her back to assist the men in what might
happen.

I observed that about the time I came to the
boat side, the fire was pretty well out, and. the
noise abated; but in about half an hour after I got
on board, I heard a volley of our men's fire-arms,
and saw a great smoke: this, as I understood after-
Wards, was our men falling upon the forty men,
Who. as I said, stood at the few houses on the way,
0f whom they killed sixteen or seventeen, and set
all those houses on fire, but did not meddle (villi
the women or children.

By that time the man got to the shore again with
the pinnace, our men began to appear; they came
dropping in, some and some, not in two bodies, and
in form, as they went out, but all in heaps, snag.
gling here and there, in such a manner that a
small force of resolute men might have cut them
all off.

But the dread of them was upon the whole coun3
try. The people were amazed and surprised, and
so frighted, that, I believe, a hundred of them
would have fled at the sight of but five of our men.
N or in all this terrible action was there a man who
made any considerable defence; they were so sur-
prised between the ter'ror of the fire, and the Sud-
den attack of our men in the dark, that they knew
not which way to turn themselves; for if they fled
one way, they were met by one party, if back
again, by another, so that they Were every where
knocked down. Nor did ' any of our men re.
'ceive the least hurt, except one who strained his
foot, and another had one of his hands very much
burned.

I was very angry with my nephew, the captain:
and indeed with 'all the men, in my mind, but
'with him in particular, as well for his acting so out
of his duty, as commander of the ship, and having
the charge of the voyage upon him, as in his
prompting, rather than cooling, the rage of his
men, in so bloody and cruel an enterprise. My 118'
phew answered me very respectfully, but told me,
that when he saw the body of the poor seaman:
whom they had murdered in such a cruel and bar-
barous manner, he was not master of himself, nei'
ther could he govern his passion. He owned he
should not have done so, as he was commander of
the ship; but as he was a man, and nature moved
him, he could not bear it. As for the rest of the
men, they were not subject to me at all, and the!
knew it well enough; so they took no notice of my
dislike. -

.The next day we set sail, so we never heard any
more of it. Our men differed in the account of
the number they killed; some said one thing, some
another: but, according to the best of their ac-
counts put all together, they killed, or destroyed,
about one hundred and fifty people, men, women,
and children, and left not a house standing in the
town.

As for the poor fe110w,Thomas Jefi'rys, as he was
quite dead, for his throat was so cut that his head
Was half off, it would do him no service to bring
him away; so they left him where they found him,
"'3 took him down from the tree where he was
hanged by one hand.

However just our men thought this action to be,
I was against them in it; and I always, after that
time, told them God would blast the voyage; for I
looked upon the blood they shed that night to be
murder in them: for though it is true that'they
killed Thomas J efl'rys, yet it was as true that J efi'rys
Was the aggressor, had broken the truce, and had
violated, or debauched, a young Woman of theirs,
who came to our camp innocently, and on the faith
0f their capitnlation.

The boatswain defended this quarrel when we
were afterwards on board. He said it was true
that we seemed to break the truce, but really had
not; and that the war was begun the night before,
by the natives themselves, who had shot at us, and
killed one of our men, without any just provoca-
"011; so that as we were in a capacity to fight them,
we might also be in a capacity to do ourselves jus-
tree ul'On them in an extraordinary manner; that
"mush the poor man had taken a little liberty with
a wench, he ought not to have been murdered, and
that in such a villanous manner: and that they
did nothing. but what was just, and what the laws
of God allowed to be done to murderers.
One would think this should have been enough
to have warned us against going on shore among
heathens and barbarians; but it is impossible to
make mankind wise, but at their own experience,
and their experience seems to be always of most use
to them, when it is dearest bought.

We were now bound to the gulf of Persia, and
from thence to the coast of Coromandel, only to
touch at Surratte; but the chief of the supercar-
go's design lay at the bay of Bengal, where, if he
missed of the business outward bound he was to
go up to China, and return to the coast as he came
home.

The first disaster that befel us was in the gulf of
Persia, where five of our men venturing on share;
on the Arabian side of the gulf, were surrounded
by the Arabs, and either all killed, or carried away
into slavery: the rest of the boat's crew were not
able to rescue them, and had but just time to get
off their boat. I began to upbraid them with the
just retribution of Heaven in this case; but the ~
boatswain vcry warmly told me, he thought 1 went
farther in my censures than I could show any war-
rant for in Scripture, and referred to the thirteenth
of Saint Luke, verse fourth, where our Saviour in-
timates that those men, on whom the tower of Sh
loam fell, were. not sinners above all the Galileans:
but'that which indeed put me to silence in this case,
was, that not one of these five men, who were now
lost, were of the number of those who went on
shore to the Massacre of Madagascar (so I always
cnlleg it, though our men could not bear the word
' massacre" with any patience); and indeed this
last circumstance, as I have said, put. me to silence
for the present. .

But my frequent preaching to them on this sub-
ject had worse consequences than I expected; and
' the boatswain, who had been at the head of the
attempt, came up boldly to me one time, and told me
he found that I. continually brought that afl'air upon
the stage; that I made unjust reflections upon it
and had used the men very ill on that account, and
himself in particular; that as I was but a passenger,
and had no command in the ship, or concern in the
voyage, they were not obliged to bear it; that they
did not know but I might have some ill design in
my head, and, perhaps, to call them to an account
for it when they came to England; and that, there-
fore, unless I would resolve to have done with it,
and also not to concern myself any further with
him, or any of his affairs, he would leave the ship;
for he did not think it was safe to sail with me
among them.

Iheard him patiently enough till he had done,
and then told him, that I did confess I had all
along opposed the massacre of Madagascar, for such
I would always call it; and that 1 had, on all occa-
sions, spoken my mind freely about it, though not
more upon him than any of the rest; that as to my
having no command in the ship, that was true, nor
did '1 exercise any authority, only took the liberty
of s'Peaking my mind in things which publicly con-
cerned us all: as to what concern 1 had in the voy-
3% that was none of his business; that I was a
considerable owner in the ship, and in that claim I
conceived I had a right to speak, even farther than
1-had yet done, and would not be accountable to
him, Or any one else, and began to be a little warm
with him. He made but little reply to me at that
lime, and I thought that affair had been over. We
were at this time in the road at Bengal; and, being -
Wllllug to see the. place, 1 went on shore with the
sul'crcargo, in the. ship's boat, to divert myself,
and towards evening was preparing to go on board,
When one of the men came to me, and told me, he
Would not have me trouble myself to come down
'0 UN! boat, for they had orders not to carry me on
board. An y one may guess what a surprise I was
"I at so insolent a message; and I asked the man
who bade him deliver that errand to me. He told

3 A
me the cockswain. I said no more to the fellow,
but bade him let them know he had delivered his
message, and that I had given him no answer
to it.

I immediately went, and found out the super-
eargo, and told him the story, adding what I we-
sently foresaw, viz. that there would certainly be 8
mutiny in the ship, and entreated him to go imme-
diately on board the ship, in an Indian boat, and
acquaint the captain of it. But I might have
spared this intelligence; for, before I had spoken
to him on shore, the matter was effected on board>>
The boatswain, the gunner, the carpenter, and, in a
word, all the inferior officers, as soon as I was gons
off in the boat, came up to the quarter-deck, and de'
sired to speak with the captain; and there the
boatswain, making a long harangue (for the fellow
talked very well), and repeating all he had said to
me, told the captain, in few words, that as I was
now gone peaceably on shore, they were loath to
use any violence with me, which, if I had not gone
on shore, they would otherwise have done, to oblige
me to have gone. They therefore thought lit to
tell him, that as they shipped themselves to salve
in the ship, under hiseommand, they would per-
form it faithfully: but if I would not quit the ship!
or the- captain oblige me to quit it, they would all
leave the ship, and sail no farther with him. AI"l
at that word, ' all,' he turned his face about, to-
wards the maiumnst, which was, it seems. the SlS'
nal agreed on between them; at which all the sve-
men being got together, they cried out, ' One and
all! One and all!'

My nephew, the captain, was a man of spirit. and
of great presence of mind; and though he was sur-
prised, you may be sure, at the thing, yet he told
them calmly, he would consider the matter, bl"
that he could do nothing in it till he had spolfc"
to me about it. He used some arguments With
them, to show them the unreasonableness andm' .
justice of the thing: but it was all in vain; they
swore, and shook hands round, before his face, that
they would go all on shore, unless he would en-
gage to them, not to suffer me to come any more
on board the ship.

This was a hard article upon him, who knew his
obligation to me, and did not know how I might
take it; so he began to talk cavalierly to them,
told them that I was a very considerable owner of
the ship, and that in justice he could not put me
Out of my own house; that this was next door to
serving me, as the famous pirate Kid had done,
who made the mutiny in a ship, set the captain on
shore in an uninhabited island, and ran away with
the ship; that let them go into what ship they
could, if ever they came to England again, it
would cost them, dear; that the ship was mine, and
that he could not put me out of it; and that he
would rather lose the ship, and the voyage too,
than disoblige me so much; so they might do as
they pleased. However, he would go on shore,
and talk with me on shore; and invited the boat-
swain to go with him, and, perhaps, they might ac-
commodate the matter with me. -

But they all rejected the proposal, and said they

would have nothing to do with me any more, nei<<
ther on board nor on shore; and if I came on 'board,
they would all go on shore. ' Well,' said the cap-
tain, ' if you are all of this mind. let me go on
shore, and talk with him.' So away he came to me
with this account, a little after the message had
been brought to me from the cockswain.
. Iwas very glad to see my nephew, I must con-
:9"; for I was not without apprehensions, that
they would confine him by violence, set sail, and
run away with the ship; and then 1 had been
Stripped naked in a remote country, and nothing to
help myself. In short, I had been in a worse case
than when I was all alone in the island.

But they had not gone that length, it seems, to
my great satisfaction ; and when my nephew told
me what they had said to him, and how they had
sworn, and shook hands, that they would, one and
all, leave the ship, if I was suffered to come on
board, I told him he should not be concerned at it
at all, for I would stay on shore. I only desired
he would take care and send me all my necessary
things on shore, and leave me a sufficient sum of
money, and 1 would find my way to England as
well as I could. ,

This was a heavy piece of news to my nephew;
but there was no way to help it, but to comply
with it. So, in short, he went on board the ship
again, and satisfied the men that his uncle had
yielded to their importunity, and had sent for his
goods from on board the ship. So the matter was
over in a very few hours: the men returned to
their duty, and I began to consider what course I
should steer.

I was now alone in the remotest part of the
world, as 1 think I may call it; for I was near
three thousand leagues by sea farther off from Eng.
land, than I was at my island; only, it is truc,I
might travel here by land over the Great Mogul's
country to Surratte, might go from thence to Bas-
sora by sea, up the gulf of Persia, and from thence
might take the way of the caravans, over the deserts
of Arabia, to Aleppo and Scauderoon; from thence
by sea again to Italy, and so overland into
France; and this, put together, might be at least .
a full diameter of the globe; but, if it were to be
measured, I suppose, it would appear to be a great
deal more.

I had another way before me, which was to wait
for some English ships, which were coming to Ben-
gal, from Achin, on the island of Sumatra, and get
passage on board them for England. But as I came
hither without any concern with the English East
India Company, so it would be diflicult to go from
hence without their licence, unless with great favour
of the captains of the ships, or of the Company's
factors; and to both I was an utter stranger.

Here I had the particular pleasure, speaking by
contraries, to see the ship set sail without me;
a treatment, I think, a man in my circumstances
scarce ever met with, except from pirates running
away with a ship, and setting those that would not
agree with their villany on shore. Indeed, this
was next door to it, both ways. However, my
nephew left me two servants, or rather one compa-
nion and one servant: the first was clerk to the
purser, whom he engaged to go with me, and the
other was his own servant. I took me also a good
lodging in the house of an English woman, where
several merchants lodged, some French, two Ita-
lians, or rather Jews, and one Englishman. Here I
was handsomely enough entertained; and, that I
might not be said to run rashly upon any thing, I
staid here ahove nine months, considering what
course to take, and how to manage myself. I had
some English goods with me of Value, and a consi--
derable sum of money, my nephew furnishing me
with a thousand pieces of eight, and a letter of
credit for more, it' I had occasion, that I might not.
be straitened, whatever might happen.

I quickly disposed of my goods, and to advantage
too; and, as I originally intended, I bought here
some very good diamonds, which, of all other
""25. was the roost proper for me in my circumo
stances, because I might always carry my whoie
estate about me.

After a long stay here, and many proposals made
for my return to England, but none falling out to
my mind, the English merchant, who lodged with
me, and with whom I had contracted an intimate
acquaintance, came to me one morning: ' Country-
man,' said he, ' I have a project to communicate to
5'0". which, as it suits with my thoughts, may, for
allllht I know, suit with yours also, when you shall
have thoroughly considered it.

(4
' Here we are posted,' says he, ' you by accident,
and 1 by my own choice, in a part of the world very
remote from our own country; but it is in a noun
try where, by us who understand trade and busi-
ness, a great deal of money is to be got. If you
will put a thousand pounds to my thousand pounds,
we will hire a ship here, the first we can get to our
minds; you shall he captain, I will be merchant,
and we will go a trading voyage to China; for
what should we stand still for? The whole world is
in motion, rolling round and round: all the crea-
tures of God, heavenly bodies and earthly, are busy
and diligent. Why should we be idle? There are
no drones,' said he, ' living in the world but men.
Why should we be of that number?'

I liked this proposal very well, and the more be-
cause it seemed to be expressed with so much
good will, and in so friendly a manner. I will not
say but that I might, by my loose and nnhingcd
circumstances, be the fitter to embrace a proposal
for trade, and, indeed, for any thing else; or, other-
wise, trade was none of my element. However.
1 might, perhaps, say with some truth, that if
trade was not my element, rambling was; and n0
proposal for seeing any part of the world whichI
had never seen before, could possibly come amiss
- to me.

It was, however, some time before we could get
a ship to our mind, and when we had got a vessel;
it was not easy to get English sailors; that is to 583',
so many as were necessary to govern the voyage:
and manage the sailors which we should pick up
there. After some time we got a mate, a boatswain,
and a gunner, English; a Dutch carpenter, and
three Portuguese forcmast-mcn; with these we
found we could do well enough, having Indian
seamen, such as they are, to make up.

There are so many travellers who have written
the history of their voyages and travels this wily,
that it would be but very little diversion to any
body, to give a long account of the places we went
to, and the people who inhabit there. Those things
I leave to others, and refer the reader to those
journals and travels of Englishmen, many of which
I find are published, and more promised every day.
It is enough for me to tell you, that we made the
voyage to Achin, in the island of Sumatra, first;
and from thence to Siam, where we exchanged some
of our wares for opium, and for some arrack; the
first, a commodity which bears a great price among
the Chinese, and which, at that time, was very much
wanted there. 'In a word, we went up to Susham,
made a very great, voyage, were eight months out,
and returned to Bengal ; and I was very well satis-
fied with my adventure. I observe, that our people
in England often admire how the officers, which the
Company send into India, and the merchants which
generally stay there, get such very great estates as
they do, and sometimes come home worth from
sixty to seventy, and one hundred thousand pounds
at a time.

But it is no wonder; or, at least, we shall see so
much farther into it, when we consider the innu-
merable ports and places where they have a free
commerce, that it will then be no wonder; and
flinch less will it be so, when we consider that at:
all those places and ports, where the English ships
come, there is so much, and such constant demand
for the growth of all other countries, that there is
a certain vent for the returns, as well as a market
abroad for the goods carried out.

In short, we made a very good voyage, and I got
SS0 much money by the first adventure, and such an
msxght into the method of getting more, that had I
been twenty years younger, I should have been
tempted to have staid here, and sought no farther
for making my fortune. But what Was all this to a
man on the wrong side. of threescore, that was rich
enough, and_came abroad more in obedience to a
restless desire of seeing the world, than a covetous
desire of getting in it; and indeed, I think, it is
with great justice that I now call it a restless de-
sire; for it was so: when I was at home, I was
restless to go abroad; and now I was abroad, I was
restless to be at home. I say, what was this gain
to me? I was rich enough already; nor had I any
uneasy desires about getting more money; and,
therefore, the profits of the voyage to me were
things of no great force for the prompting me for-
ward to farther undertakings; and I thought, that,
by this voyage I had made no progress at all, be-
cause I was come back, as I might call it, to the
place from whence I came, as to a home; whereas.
my eye, which, like that which Solomon speaks of,
was never satisfied with seeing, was still more de-
sirous of wandering and seeing. I was come intoa
part of the world which I never was in before; and
that part in particular which I had heard much
of, and was resolved to see as much of as I could;
and then I thought I might say I had seen all the
world that was worth seeing.

But my fellow-traveller and I had different n0-
tions. I do not name this, to insist upon my own;
for I acknowledge his was the most just, and the
most suited to the end of a merchant's life, who.
when he is abroad upon adventures, it is his MS-
dom to stick to that, as the best thing for him.
which he is like to get the most money by. My
new friend kept himself to the nature of the thing,
and would have been content to have gone, like
a carrier's horse. always to the same inn, bask-
ward and forward, provided he -could, as he call-
edit, find his account in it; on the other hand:
mine, as old as I was, was the notion of a mad.
rambling boy, that never cares to see a thing twice
over.

But this was not all: I had a kind of impatience
upon me to be nearer home, and yet the most un-
settled resolution imaginable, which way to gO- 1"
the interval of these consultations, my friend, Whdeg
was always upon the search for business, proposed
another voyage to me, viz. among the Spice Islands,
and to bring home a load of cloves, from the Ma-
nillas, or thereabouts; places where, indeed, the
Dutch do trade, but the islands partly belong to
the Spaniards; though we went not so far, but to
some other, where they have not the whole power
as they have at Batavia, Ceylon, &c. We were not
long in preparing for this voyage; the chief diiii.
culty was, in bringing me to come into it. How.
ever, at last, nothing else offering, and finding that
really stirring about, and trading, the profit being
so great, and I may say certain, had more pleasure
in it, and more satisfaction tobthe mind, than sitting
still, which, to me especially, was the unhappicst
part of life, I resolved on this voyage too, which
we made very successfully, touching at Borneo,
and several islands, whose names I do not remem-
ber, and came home in about five months. We
sold our spice, which was chiefly cloves, and some
nutmcgs, to the Persian merchants, who carried
them away for the gulf, and, making near five of
one. we really got a great deal of money.

My friend, when we made up this account,
smiled at me: ' Well, now,' said he, with a sort of
an agreeable insult upon my indolent temper, ' is
not this better than Walking about here, like a man
of nothing to do, and Spending our time in staring
at the nonsense and ignorance of the Pagans?'
I Why, truly.' said I, ' friend, I think it is; and I
begin to be a convert to the principles of merchan-
disiug; but I must tell you,' said I, ' by the
Way, you do not know what I am doing, for if once
] Conquer my backwardness,' and embark heartily,
as old as I am, I shall harass you up and down the
world, till I tire you; for I shall pursue it so eager-
ly. I shall never let you lie still.'

Blit. to be short with my speculations, a little
While after this, there came in a Dutch ship from
Batavia: she was a coaster, not an European trader;

2 A 2
and of about two hundred tons burden. The men,
as they pretended, having been so sickly, that the
captain had not men enough to go to sea with, he
lay by at Bengal; and, as if having got money
enough, or being willing, for other reasons, to go
for Europe, he gave public notice, that he would
sell his ship. This came to my ears before my new
partner heard of it, and I had a great mind to buyit.
So I went home to him, and told him of it. He con.
sidered awhile; for he was no rash man neither,
but, musing some time, he replied: ' She is a little
too big: but, however, we will have her.' Accord-
ingly we bought the ship, and, agreeing with the
master, we paid for her, and took possession. When
we had done so, we resolved to entertain the men, if
we could, to join with those we had, for the pursu-
ing our business; but, on a sudden, they having re-
ceived not their wages, but their share of the money:
as we afterwards learned, not one of them was to
be found. We inquired much about them, and>>
at length, were told that they were all gone t0-
gether, by land,'to Agra, the great city of the MO'
gul's residence, and from thence were to travel to
Surratte, and so by sea to the gulf of Persia.
Nothing had so heartily troubled me a good
while, as that I missed the opportunity of going
with them, for such a ramble, I thought, and in
such company as would both have guarded me,
and diverted me, would have suited mightily will!
my great design; and I should both have seen th'
world, and gone homewards too. But 1 was mUCh
better satisfied a few days after, when I came to
know what sort of fellows they were; for, in short,
their history was, that this man they called captain,
was the gunner only, not the commander; that
they had been a trading voyage, in which they
were attacked on shore by some of the Mala-0'
cans, who had killed the captain, and three of his
men; and that after the captain was killed, the$8
men, eleven in number, had resolved to run away
with the ship, which they did, and had brought
her in at the bay of Bengal, leaving the mate and
five men more on shore; of whom we shall hear
farther.

Well, let them come by the ship how they would,
we came honestly by her, as we thought; though we
did not, Iconfess, examine into things so exactly.
as we ought, for we never inquired any thing of the
seamen, who, if we had examined, would certainly
have faltered in their accounts, contradicted one
another, and, perhaps, contradicted themselves, or.
one how or other, we should have seen reason to
have suspected them; but the man showed us a
bill of sale for the ship, to one Emanuel Clo-
stershoven, or some such name (for, I suppose,
it was all a forgery). and called himself by that
name, and we could not contradict him; and being
withal a little too unwary, or, at least, having no
suspicion of the thing, we went through with Our
bargain.

However, we picked up some English seamen
here after this, and some Dutch, and we now re-
solved for a second voyage to the south-east, for
cloves, 85m; that is to say. among the Philippine
and Malacca isles: and, in short, not to fill this
part of my story with trilles, when what is yet
to come is so remarkable, I spent, from first to
last, six years in this country, trading from port
to P0". backward and forward, and with very
800d success, and was now the last year, with my
partner, going in the ship abovementioned, on a
"Wage to China, but designing first to Siam, to
buy rice.

In this voyage, being, by contrary winds, obliged
t0 beat up and down a great while, in the straits of
Malacca, and among the islands, we were no sooner
Bot clear of those difficult seas, but we found our
sl'iP had sprung a leak, and we were not able, by
all our industry, to find out where it was. This
forced us to make for some port, and my partner ,
who knew the country better than I did, directed
the captain to put into the river of Cambodia; for
I had made the English mate, one Mr. Thomson,
captain, not being willing to take the charge or
the ship upon myself. This river lies on the north
side of the great bay, or gulf, which goes up to
Siam. _

While we were here, and going often on shore for
refreshment, there comes to me one day an Eng.
lishman; and he was, it seems, a gunner's mute on
board an English East India ship, which rode in
the same river, up at, or near, the city of Cambodia:
what brought him hither we knew not: but he
comes up to me, and, speaking in English, 'Sir.'
said he, ' you are a stranger to me, and I to you;
but I have something to tell you, that very nearly
concerns you.'

I looked steadily at him a good while, and
thought at first I had known him, but I did not
' If it very nearly concerns me,' said I, ' and not
yourself, what moves you to tell it me?' ' I am
moved,' said he, ' by the imminent danger you are
in; and, for aught I see, you have no knowledge 0f
it.' ' I know no danger I am in,' said I, ' but that
my ship is leaky, and I cannot find it out; but I
purpose to lay her aground tomorrow, to see i"
can find it.' ' But, sir,' said he, 'leaky or 110'
leaky, find it or not find it, you will be wiser than
to lay your ship on shore tomorrow, when you hear
what I have to say to you. Do you know, sir,' said
he, ' the town of Cambodia lies about fifteen
leagues up this river,'and there are two large Englis"
ships about five leagues on this side, and three
Dutch?' ' Well,' said I, ' and what is that to me?
' Why, sir,' says he, ' is it for a man that is upon
such adventures as you are, to come into a port, and
not examine first what ships there are there, and
whether he is able to deal 'with them? I suppose:
you do not think you are a match for them.' I
was amused very much at his discourse, but 110:
amazed at it, for I could not conceive what he
meant; and I turned short upon him, and said,
'Sir, I wish you would explain yourself; I cannot
imagine what reason I have to be afraid of any of
the Company's ships. or Dutch ships: 1 am no in-
terloper. What can they have to say to me ?'

He looked like a Man half angry, half pleased;
and pausing a while, but smiling, ' Well, sir,' said
he, ' if you think yourself secure, you must take
your chance. I am sorry your fate should blind
you against good advice; but assure yourself, if you
do not put to sea immediately, you will, the very
next tide, be attacked by live long boats full of
men; and perhaps, if you are taken, you. will be
hanged for a pirate, and the particulars be examined
into afterwards. I thought, sir,' added he, ' I
should have met with a better reception than this,
for doing you a piece of service of such import-
ance.' ' I can never be ungrateful,' said I, ' for
any service, or to any man that 06ch me any kind-
ness; but it is past my comprehensiou,' said I, ' what
they should have such a design upon me for. How-
ever, since you say there is no time to be lost, and
that there is some villanous design in hand against
me, I'll go on board this minute, and put to sea
- immediately, if my men can step the leak, or if we
can swim without stopping it. But, sir,' said I,
' shall I go away ignorant of the reason of all this?
Can you give me no farther light into it?'

' I can tell you but part of the story, sir,' says he;
' butI have a Dutch seaman here with me, and I
believe I could persuade him to tell you the rest,
but there is scarce time for it. But the short of the
Stpry is this, the first part of which I suppose you
know well enough, viz. that you were with this
5MP at Sumatra; that there your captain was mute
dared by the Malaccans, with three of his men; and
that 5011, or some of those that were on board with
3'9". ran away with the ship, and are since turned
Pirates. This is the sum of the story; and you will
be all seized as pirates, I can assure you, and exe-
cuted with very little ceremony ; for you know
merchant ships show but little law to pirates, if
they get them in their power.'

' Now you speak plain English.' said I, ' and I
thank you; and though I know nothing that we
have done like what you talk of, but I am sure we
came honestly and fairly by the ship, yet, seeing
such work is 3 doing, as you say, and that you seem
to mean honestly, I'll be upon my guard.' ' Nay, sir.'
says he, ' do not talk of being upon your guard,- the
best defence is to be out of the danger; if you have
any regard for your life, and the lives of all your
men, put out to sea without fail, at high water; and
as you have a whole tide before you, you will be
gone too far out before they can come down; for
they will come away at high-water; and as they
have twenty miles to come, you get near two hours
of them by the difference of the tide, not reckoning
the length of the way: besides, as they are only
boats, and not ships, they will not venture to follow
you far out to sea, eSpecially if it blows.'

' Well,' said I, ' you have been very kind in this:
what shall I do for you, to make you amends."
' Sir,' says he, ' you may not be so willing to make
me amends, because you may not be convinced of
the truth of it. I'll make an offer to you: I have
nineteen months' pay due to me on board the ship
......which I came out of England in; and the
Dutchman that is with me has seven months' pay
due to him; if you will make good our pay to us.
we will go along with you; if you lind nothing
more in it, we will desire no more; l)ut if we do
convince you that we have saved your life, and the
ship, and the lives of all the men in her, we will
leave the rest to you.'

I consented to this readily, and went immediately
on board, and the two men with me. As soon as I
came to the ship side, my partner, who was on board.
came out on the quarter-deck, and called to me
with a great deal of joy, ' 0 ho! 0 ho! we have
stopp'd the leak! we have stopp'd the leak!' ' Say
you so,' said 1; ' thank God; but weigh the an-
chor immediately.' ' Weigh!' says he, ' what do
' you mean by that? What is the matter?' says he.
' Ask no questions,' said I, ' but all hands to work,
and weigh without losing a minute.' He was sur-
prised; but, however, he called the captain, and he
immediately ordered the anchor to be got up; and
though the tide was not quite done, yet a little
land-breeze blowing, We stood out to sea. Then I
called him into the cabin, and told him the story in
general; and we called in the men, and they told us
the rest of it; but as it took us up a great deal of
time, so before we had done, a seaman comes to the
cabin door, and calls out to us, that the captain
bade him tell us we were chased. ' Chased,' said
I, ' by whom, and by what?' ' By five sloops, or
boats,' said the fellow, ' full of men.' ' Very well,'
said 1, ' then it is apparent there is something it.'
In the next place, I ordered all our men to be called
"P, and told them that there was a design to seize
the ship, and to take us for pirates, and asked them
If they would stand by us, and by one another.
The men answered cheerfully that, one and all, they
Would live and die with us. Then I asked the cap-
' tain, what way he thought best for us to manage a
fight with them; for resist them I resolved we would,
and that to the last (imp. He said readily, that the
Way was to keep them off with our great shot, as
long as we could, and then to fire at them with our
small arms, to keep them from boarding us; but
when neither of these would do any longer, we
should retire to our close quarters: perhaps they
hadnot materials to break open our bulk-heads, or
get in upon us. .

The gunner had, in the mean time, orders to bring
""0 guns to bear fore and aft," out of the steerage, to
clear the deck, and load them with muskebbullets
and small pieces of old iron, and what next came to
hand; and thus we made ready for fight, but all
this while kept out to sea, with wind enough, and
could see the boats at a distance, being five large
long-boats, following us with all the sail they could
make. '

Two of those boats, which by our glasses we could
see were English, had outsailed the rest, were near
two leagues ahead of them, and gained upon us
considerably, so that we found they would come
up with us: upon which we fired a gun without 1'.
shot, to intimate that they should bring to, and we
put out a flag of truce as a signal for parley; but
they kept crowding after us till they came within
shot. Upon this we took in our white flag, they
having made no answer to it, hung out the red flag.
and fired at them with shot. Notwithstanding thiS.
they came on till they were near enough to call to
them with a Speaking-trumpet which we had on
board ; so we called to them, and bade them keep
off at their peril. .

It Was all one: they crowded after us, and en-
deavoured to come under our stern, so to hoard us
on our quarter: upon which, seeing they were re-
solute for mischief, and depended upon the strength
that followed them, I ordered to bring the ship t0.
so that they lay upon our broadside, when imme-
diately we fired five guns at them, one of which had
been levelled so true as to carry away the stern of
the hindermost boat, and bring them to the notes
sity of taking down their sail, and running all to
the head of the boat, to keep her from sinking; 50
she lay by, and had enough of it; but, seeing the
foremost boat crowd still on after us, we made ready
to fire at her in particular.

While this was doing, one of the three boats that
were behind, being forwarder than the other we,
made up to the boat which we had disabled, to re'
lieve her, and we could afterwards see her take 0ul
her men. We called again to the foremost boaMDd
offered a truce to parley again, and to know what
was her business with us; but had no answer;
only she crowded close under our stern. Upon
this our gunner, who was a. very dexterous fellow,
run out his two chase-guns, and fired at her; but
~ the shot missing, the men in the boat shouted,
waved their caps, and came on; but the gunner
getting quickly ready again, fired among them the
second time, one shot of which, though it missed
the boat itself, yet it fell in among the men, and, we
could easily see, had done a great deal of mischief
among them: but we,'taking no notice of that,
weared the ship again, and brought our quarter to
bear upon them, and, firing three guns more, we
found the boat was split almost to pieces; in parti-
cular, her rudder and a piece of her stern were shot
quite away; so they handed their sail immediately,
and were in great disorder. But, to complete their
misfortune, our gunner let fly two guns at them
again: where he hit them we could not tell; but
we found the boat was sinking, and some of the
men already in the water. Upon this I immedi-
ately manned out our pinnace, which we had kept
close by our side, with orders to pick up some of
the men, if they could, and save them from drown-
ing, and immediately to come on board with them,
because we saw the rest of the boats began to come
up. Our men in the pinnace followed their orders,
and took up three men, one of which was just
drowning, and it was a. good while before we could
recover him. As soon as they were on board, we
crowded all the Sail we could make, and stood far-
ther out to sea; and we found that when the other
three boats came up to the first two, they gave over
their chase.

Being thus delivered from a danger which, though
I knew not the reason of it, yet seemed to be much
greater than I had apprehended, Itook care that we
would change our course, and not let any one
Imagine whither we were going; so we Stood out to
558 eastward, quite out of the course of all Euro.
pean ships, whether they were bound to China or
any where else within the commerce of the Euro-
pean nations.

When we were now at sea, we began to consult
with the two seamen. and inquire first, what the
meaning of all this should he. The Dutchman let
us into the secret of it at once, telling us, that the
fellow that sold us the ship, as we said, was no more
than a thief, that had ran away with her. Then he
told us how the captain, whose name too he men-
tioned, though I do not remember it now, was
treacherously murdered by the natives on the coast
of Malacca, with three of his men; and that he,
this Dutchman, and four more, get into the woods,
where they wandered about a great while, till at
length, he in particular, in a miraculous manner,
made his escape, and swam off to a Dutch ship,
which sailingr near the shore, in its way from China>>
had sent their boat on shore for fresh water; that he
durst not come to that part of the shore where the
boat was, but made shift, in the night, to take into
the water farther off, and, swimming at great while,
at last the ship's boat took him up.

He then told us, that he went to Batavia, where
two of the seamen belonging to the ship had arrived:
having deserted the rest in their travels; and gave
an account, that the fellow who had run away will!
the ship, sold her, at Bengal, to a set of piralfiu
who were gone a cruising in her; and that they
had already taken an English ship, and two DutCh
ships, very richly laden. '

This latter part we found to concern us directly;
and though wegknew it to be false, yet, as my Pa'l'
ner said very well, if we had fallen into their hands,
and they had had such a prepossession against "5
before-hand, it had been in vain for us to have de-
l'ended ourselves, or to hope for any good quarter
at their hands; especially considering that our ar-
cusers had been ourjudgcs, and that we could luu'c
expected nothing from them but what rage would
have dictated, and ungoverned passion have exe-
cuted: and therefore it was his opinion we should
go directly back to Bengal, from whence we came,
without putting in at any port whatever; because
there we could give an account of ourselves, and
could prove where we were when the ship put in,
whoane bought her of. and the like; and, which
was more than all the rest, if we were put to the
necessity of bringing it before the proper judges, we
should be sure to have some justice, and not be
hanged first, and judged afterwards.

I was some time of my partner's opinion; but
after a little more serious thinking, I told him I
thought it was a very great hazard for us to attempt
returning to Bengal, for that we were on the wrong
side of the straits of Malacca; and that if the alarm
was given, we should be sure to be way-laid on every
side, as well by the Dutch of Batavia as the English
elsewhere; that it' we should be taken, as it were,
running away, we should even condemn ourselves,
and there would want no more evidence .50 destroy
US- I also asked the English sailor's opinion, who
said, he was of my mind, and that we should cer-
tainly be taken.

This danger a little startled my partner and all
the ship's company; and we immediately resolved
tdeg E0 away to the coast of Tonquin, and so on to
China; and, from thence pursuing the first design,
aSlo trade, find some way or other to dispose of the
5""): and come back in some of the vessels of the
country, such as we could get. This was approved
of as the best method for our security; and accord-
Ingly we steered away N. N. E. keeping above fifty
1c"tines off from the usual course to the eastward.

This, however, put us to some inconveniences;
for,first, the winds, when we came to that distance
from the shore, seemed to be more steadil y against
"5, blowing almost trade, as we call it, from the
0Mt, and E. N. E. so that we were a long while
uPon our' voyage; and we were but ill provided
with victuals for so long a run, and, which was still
worse, there was some danger that those English
and Dutch ships whose boats pursued us, whereof
some were bound that way, might be got in before
us, and, if not, some other ship bound to China,
might have information of us from them, and pursue
us with the same vigour.

I must confess, I was now very uneasy, and thought
myself, including the late escape from the long
boats, to have been in the most dangerous condition
that ever I was in through all my past life; for,
whatever ill circumstances I had been in, I was
never pursued for a thief before; nor had I evrr
done any thing that merited the name of dishonest,
or fraudulent, much less thicvish. I had chiefly
been my own enemy, or, as I may rightly say, I
had been nobody's enemy but my own. But nowI
was embarrassed in the worst condition imaginable;
for though I was perfectly innocent, I was in no
condition to make that innocence appear: and ifI
had been taken, it had been under a supposed guilt
of the worst kind; at least, a crime esteemed so
among the peeple I had to do with.

This made me very anxious to make an escape;
though which way to do it, i knew not, or what
port or place we should go to. My partner seeing
me thus dejected, though he was the most concern-
ed at first, began to encourage me, and. describing
to me the several ports of that coast, told me. he
would put in, on the coast of Cochinchina, or the
bay of Tonquin, intending to go afterwards [0
Macao, a town once in the possession of the For-
tuguese, and where still a great; many European
families resided; "and particularly the missionary
priests usually went thither, in order to their going
forward to China.

Hither then we resolved to go, and accordingly.
though after a tedious and irregular course, and
very much straitened for provisions, we came within
sight of the coast very early in the morning;
and, upon-reflection upon the circumstances we
were in, and the danger, if we had not escaped, we
resolved to put into a small river, which, however,
had depth enough of water for us, and to see if we
could, either over land, or by the ship's pinnace,
come to know what ships were in any port th'ere-
abouts. This happy step was indeed our deliver-
ance; for though we did not immediately see any
EurOpean ships in the bay ofTonquin, yet the next
morning there came into the bay two Dutch ships;
and a third without any colours spread out, but
which we believed to be a Dutchman, passed by at
about two leagues' distance, steering for the coast of
China, and, in the afternoon, went by two English
ships, steering the same course; and thus we
thought we saw ourselves beset with enemies, both
one way and the other. The place we were in was
wild and barbarous, the people thieves, even by oc-
cupation or profession; and though it is true, we
had not much to seek of them, and except getting a
few provisions, cared not how little we had to do
with them, yet it was with much difficulty that we
kept ourselves from being insulted by them several
ways.

We were in a small river of this country, within
a few leagues of its utmost limits northward, and
by our boat we coasted north-east to the point of
land which opens the great bay of Tonquiu ; and it
was in this beating up along the shore, that we dis-
covered, as above, that, in a word, we were sur-
70unded with enemies. The people we were among
were the most barbarous of all the inhabitants of
.the coast, having no correspondence with any other
nation, and dealing only in fish, and oil, and such
gross commodities; and it may be particularly seen
that they are, as I said, the most barbarous of any
0f the inhabitants, viz. that among other customs
"{0}? have this as one, that if any vessel have the
misfortune to be shipwrecked upon their coast, they
Presently make the men all prisoners, that is to
say, slaves: and it was not long before we found 8
spice of their kindness this way, on the occasion fol
lowing,

I have observed above, that our ship sprang a
leak at sea, and that we could not find it out;
and, however it happened. that, as I have said, it
was stopped, unexpectedly, in the happy minute of
our being to be seized by the Dutch and English
ships, near the bay of Siam; yet as we did not find
the ship so perfectly tight and sound as we desired,
we resolved, while we were in this place, to lay
her on shore, take out what heavy things we had on
board, which were not many, and to wash and
clean her bottom, and, if possible, to find out when:
the leaks were.

Accordingly, having lightened the ship, and
brought all our guns, and other moveable things,
to one side, we tried to bring her down, that we
might come at her bottom; for, on second thoughts,
we did not care to lay her dry aground, neither
could we find out a proper place for it.

The inhabitants, who had never been acquainted
with such a sight, came wandering down to the
shore, to look at us, and seeing the ship lie down on
one side in such a manner, and heeling towards the
shore, and not seeing our men, who were at work
on her bottom, with stages, and with their boats
on the off side, they presently concluded that
the ship was cast away, and so lay fast on the
ground.

On this supposition they came all about us in two
or three hours' time, with ten or twelve large boatsi
having some of them eight, some ten men, in a
boat, intending, no doubt, to have come on board
and plundered the ship, and, if they had found 0.5
there, to have carried us away for slaves to their
king, or whatever they call him, for we knew
nothing who was their governor.

When they came up to the ship, and began to row
round her, they discovered us all hard at work, onLa

the outside of the ship's bottom and side, washing,
and graving, and stopping, as every seafaring man
knows how.

They stood for a while gazing at us, and we, who
were a little surprised, could not imagine what
their design was ; but, being willing to be sure, we
took this opportunity to get some of us into the
ship, and others to hand down arms and ammuni-
tion to those that were at work, to defend them-
selves with, if there should be occasion: and it was
no more than need, for, in less than a quarter of an
hour's consultation, they agreed, it seems, that the
ship was really a wreck ; that we were all at work,
endeavouring to save her, or to save our lives by
the help of our boats; and when we handed our
arms into the boats, they concluded, by that mo-
tion, that we were endeavouring to save some
of our goods. Upon this, they took it for granted
that all belonged to them ; and away they came di-
rectly upon our men, as if it had been in a line of
battle.

Our men, seeing so many of them, began to be
frighted, for we lay but in an ill posture to fight, and
cried out to us to know what they should do. I
immediately called to the men who worked upon the
Stage, to slip them down, and get up the side into
the ship, and bade those in the boat to row round,
and come on board, and those few of us who were
on board, worked with all the strength and hands
We had to bring the ship to rights. But, however,
neither the men upon the stage, nor those in the
b033, could do as they were ordered, before the Co-
chinchinese were upon them, and, with two of their
1'Ozits boarded our long boat, and began to lay hold
0f the men as their prisoners.

The first man they laid hold of was an English
Seamen, a stout, strong fellow, who, having a mus.
ket in his hand, never offered to lire it, but laid it
dOwn in the boat, like a fool, as I thought. But he
understood his business much better than 1 could552 no mnson causon.

teach him; for he grappled the Pagan, and dragged
him by main force out of their own boat into ours,
where, taking him by the two cars, he beat his head
so against the boat's gunnel, that the fellow died
instantly in his hands; and, in the mean time, a
Dutchman, who stood next, took up the musket.
and, with the butt-end of it, so laid about him, that
he knocked down live of them, who attempted to
enter the boat; but this was little towards resisting
thirty or forty men, who, fearless, because ignorant
of their danger, began to throw themselves into the
long boat, where we had but five men to defend it-
But an accident gave our men a complete victory.
which deserved our laughter rather than any thing
else; and that was this:

Our carpenter being preparing to grave the out-
side of the ship, as well as to pay the seams where
he had canlked her to stop the leaks, had got two
kettles just let down into the boat; one filled with
boiling pitch, and the other with rosin, tallow, and
oil, and such stuff as the Shipwrights use for that
work; and the man that attended the carpenter had
a great iron ladle in his hand, with which he sup-
plied the men that were at work with that hot stuff:
two of the enemy's men entered the boat just where
this fellow stood, being in the foresheets ; he imme-
diately saluted them with a ladleful of the stuff.
boiling hot, which so burned and scalded them;
being half naked, that they roared out like tWdeg
bulls, and, enraged with the fire, leaped both into
the sea. The carpenter saw it, and cried out,
' Well done,Jack ; give them some more of it ;' wllcl's
stepping forward himself, he takes one of their
mops, and, dipping it in the pitch-pot, he and his
man threw it among them so plentiful! y, that, In
short, of all the men in three boats, there was not
one that was not scalded and burned with it. in 3
most frightful, pitiful manner, and made such 3
howling and crying, that I never heard a worse
noise, and indeed nothing like it; for it is worth
observing, that though pain naturally makes all
people cry out, yet every nation have a particular
way of exclamation, and make noises as difi'erent
from another as their speech. I cannot give the
noise these creatures made a better name than
howling, nor a name more proper to the tone of it;
for! never heard any thing more like the noise of
the wolves, which, as I have said, I heard howl in
the forest on the frontiers of Languedoc.

I was never pleased with a victory better in my '
life, not only as it was a perfect surprise to me, and
that our danger was imminent before; but as we
got this victory without any bloodshed, except of
that man the fellow killed with his naked hands,
and which I was very much concerned at, for I was
sick of killing such poor savage wretches, even
though it was in my own defence, knowing they
came on errands which they thought just, and
knew no better; and that though it may be a just
thing, because necessary, for there is no necessary
wickedness in nature, yet I thought it was a sad
life, when we must be always obliged to be killing
our fellow-creatures to preserve ourselves, and, in-
deed I think so still: and I would, even now,
Suffer a great deal, rather than I would take
away the life even of the worstperson injuring
me. I believe also, all considering peeple, who
know the value of life, would be of my opinion,
ifffhey entered seriously into the consideration
0 It.

But to return to my story: all the while this was
doing, my partner and I, who managed the rest of
the men on board, had, with great dexterity, brought
the ship almost to rights, and having gotten the
guns into their places again, the gunner called to
me. to bid our boats get out of the way, for he
would let fly among them. I called back again to
1m". and bid him not offer to fire, for the carpenter
Would do the work without him, but bade him heat
another pitch-kettle, which our cook, who was on

9 B
board, took care of. But the enemy was so terri-
fied with what they met with in their first attack,
that they would not come on again; and some of
them, that were farthest of, seeing the ship swim,
as it were, upright, began, as we supposed, to see
their mistake, and give over the enterprise, finding
it was not as they expected. Thus we got clear of
this merry fight; 'and, having gotten some rice, and
some roots, and bread, with about sixteen good,
big hogs on board, two days before, we resolved to
stay here no longer, but go forward, whatever came
of it; for we made no doubt but we should be sur-
rounded the next day with rogues enough, per-
haps more than our pitch-kettle would dispose of
for us.

We, therefore, got all our things on board the
same evening, and the next morning were ready to
sail. In the mean time, lying at an anchor some
distance from the shore, we were not. so much con.
cerned, being new in a fighting posture, as well as
in a sailing posture, if any enemy had presented:
The next day, having finished our work within
board, and finding our ship was perfectly healed of
all her leaks, we set sail. We would have gone into
the bay of Tonquin, for we wanted to inform our-
selves of what was to be known concerning the
Dutch ships that had been there; but we durst
not stand in there, because we had seen several
ships go in, as we supposed, but a little before. 50
we kept on N. E. towards the isle of Formosa, as
much afraid of being seen by a Dutch or EngliSh
merchant ship, as a Dutch or English merchant
ship in the- Mediterranean is of an Algeriue man
of war. .

When we were thus got to sea, we kept on N. E:
as if we would go to the Manillas, or the Philip-
pine islands; and this we did that we might not
fall intothe way of any of the European ships ; and
then we steered north again, till we came to the
latitude of twenty-two degrees twenty minutes, b)'
which means we made the island of Formosa di-
rectly, where we came to an anchor, in order to get
water and fresh provisions, which the people there,
who are very courteous and civil in their manners,
supplied us with willingly, and dealt very fairly
and pnnctually with us in all their agreements and
bargains, which is what we did not find among
other peOple, and may be owing to the remains of
Christianity, which was once planted here by a
Dutch missionary of Protestants, and is a testimony
of what I have often observed, viz. that the Chris-
tian religion always civilizes the people, and reforms
their manners, where it is received, whether it
works saving effects upon them or no.

From hence we sailed still north, keeping the
coast of China at an equal distance, till we knew
we were beyond all the ports of China where our
European ships usually come, being resolved, if
possible, not to fall into any of their hands, espe-
cially in this country, where, as our circumstances
were, we could not fail of being entirely ruined;
"33', so great was my fear in particular, as to my
being taken by them, thatI believe firmly, I would
much rather have chosen to fall into the hands of
the Spanish Inquisition. '

Being now come to the latitude of thirty degrees.
we resolved to put into the first trading port we
should come at, and, standing in for the shore, a
boat came off two leagues to us, with an old Por-
t"guest: pilot on board, who, knowing us to be
an European ship, came to offer his service, which,
Indeed, we were very glad of, and took him on
board; upon which, without asking us whither we
Would go, he dismissed the boat he came in, and
sent it back.

I thought it was now so much in our choice to
make the old man carry us whither we would, that
I began to talk with him about carrying us to the
gulf of Nanquin, which is the most northern part
degf the coast of China. The old man said he knew
the gulf of Nanquin very well, but, smiling, asked
us what we would do there.

I told him we would sell our cargo, and pur-
chase China wares, calicoes, raw silks, tea, wrought
silks, &c. and so would return by the same course
we came. He told us our best port had been to
have put in at Macao, where we could not fail of
a market for our Opium to our satisfaction, and
might, for our money, have purchased all sorts of
China goods as cheap as we could at Nanquin.

Not being able to put the old man out of his talk,
of which he was very opinionated, or conceited,l
told him we were gentlemen, as well as merchants,
and that we had a mind to go and see the great
city of Pekin, and the famous court of the monarch
of China. ' Why then,' says the old man, ' you
should go to Ningpo, where, by the river which
runs into the sea there, you may go up within five
leagues of the great canal. This canal is .a navi-
gable made stream, which goes through the heart
of all that vast empire of China,_crosses all the
rivers, passes some considerable hills by the help
of sluices and gates, and goes up to the city of
Pekin, being in length near two.hundred and
seventy leagues.'

' Well,' said I, ' seignior Portuguese, but that is
not our business now: the great question is, if you
can carry us up to the city of Nanquin, from
whence we can travel to Pekin afterwards.' Yes,
he said, he could do so very well, and there was a
great Dutch ship gone up that way just before.
This gave me a little shock: a Dutch ship was now
our terror, and we had much rather have met the
devil, at least if he had not come in too frightful
a figure. We depended upon it, that a Dutch ship.
would be our destruction, for we were in no condl'
tion to fight them ; all the ships they trade with in
those parts being of great "burden, and of much
greater force than we were.

The old man found me a little confused, and
under some concenn, when he named a Dutch ship;
and said to me, ' Sir, you need be under no appre-
hension of the Dutch, I suppose they are not now
at war with your nation.' ' No,' said I, ' that's
true; but I know not what liberties men may take,
when they are out of the reach of the laws of their
own country.' ' Why,' said he, ' you are no pirates,
what need you fear? They will not meddle with
peaceable merchants sure.'

If I had any blood in my body that did not fly

up into my face at that word, it was hindered by
some stop in the vessels appointed by nature to cir-
culate it; for it put me into the greatest disorder
and confusion imaginable; nor was it possible for
me to conceal it so, but that the old man easily
PErceived it.
. 'Sir,' said he, ' I find you are in some disorder
in YOur thoughts, at my talk; pray be pleased t0
{10 which way you think fit, and, depend upon it,
I'll do you all the service I can.' ' Why, seignior.'
said I, ' it is true,.I am a little unsettled in my re-
SOlution at this time, whither to go in particular, and
I_am something more so for what you said about
Pirates. I hope there are no pirates in these seas:
We are but in an ill condition to meet with them,
f0!" 570:; see we have but a small force, and but very
WEakly manned.'

' 0, Sir) said he, ' do not be concerned; I do not
know that there have been any pirates in these seas
these fifteen years, except one, which was seen, as
I hear, in the bay of Siam, about a month since;
but You may be assured she is gone to the south-
Ward: nor was she a ship of any great force, 01' fit
for the work ; she was not built for a privateen bl";
Was run away with by a reprobate crew that were
on board,after the captain and some of his men had
been murdered by the Malaccans, at, or near, the
island of Sumatra.'

' What!' said I, seeming to know nothing of the
matter, ' did they murder the captain?' ' Na:
said he, ' I do not understand that they murdered
him; but, as they afterwards ran away with the
ship, it is' generally believed that they betrayed him
into the hands of the Malaccans, who did murder
him, and, perhaps, they procured them to do it.'
' Why, then,' said I, ' they deserve death as much
as if they had done it themselves.' ' Nay,' said the
old man, ' they do deserve it; and they will cer-
tainly have it, if they light upon any English or
Dutch ship ; for they have all agreed together, that
if they meet that 'rogue, they will give him no
quarter.'

' But,' said I to him, ' you say the pirate is gone
out of these seas: how can they meet with him
then?' ' Why that's true,' said he, ' they do 533'
so; but he was, as I tell you, in the bay of Siam,
in the river Cambodia, and was discovered thereby
some Dutchmen who belonged to the ship. and
who were left on shore when they run away with
her; and some. English and Dutch traders being in
the river. they were within a little of taking him.
Nay,' said he, ' if the Foremost boats had been WC"
seconded by the rest, they had certainly taken
him; but he. finding only two boats within reach of
him, tacked about, and fired at these twoI and dis.
abled them, before the others came up; and then
standing of}~ to sea, the others'were not able (0
follow him, and so he got away. But. they have
all so exact a description of the ship, that they will
be sure to know him. and wherever they'find him.
they have vowed to give no quarter to either the
captain or the seamen, but to hang them all up 3'
the yard-arm.' '

' What!' said I, ' will they execute them right
or wrong; hang them first, and judge them after-
wards." ' 0, sir,' said the old pilot, ' there is no
need to make a formal business of it with 500"
rogues as those: let them tie them back to bad"
and set them a diving; it is no more than they
rightly deserve.'
I knew I had 'my old man fast aboard, and that
he could do me no harm. so that I turned short
upon him. ' Well, now, seignior,' said I, ' and this
is the very reason why I would have you carry us
to Nanquin, and not to put back to Macao, or to
any other part of the country where the English or
Dutch ships come; for, be it known to you, sei-
gnior, those captains of English and Dutch ships
are a parcel of rash, proud, insolent fellows, that
neither know what belongs to justice, nor how to
behave themselves as the laws of God or nature
direct; but being proud of their offices, and not
understanding their power, they would act the mur-
derers to punish robbers, would take upon them to
insult men falsely accused, and determine them
guilty without due inquiry: and, perhaps, I may
live to call some of them to an account for it,
where they may be taught how justice is to be
executed, and that no man ought to be treated as a
criminal till some evidence may be had of the
crime, and that he is the man.'

With this I told him, that this was the very ship
they had attacked, and gave him a full account of
the skirmish we had with their boats, and how
foolishly and coward-like they behaved. I told
him all the story of our buying the ship, and how
the Dutchmen-served us. ' I told him the reasons 1
had to believe that this story of killing the master
by the Malaccans was not true, as also the running
away with the ship; but that it was all a fiction of
their own, to suggest that the men were turned
pirates, and they ought to have been sure it was
50, before they had ventured to attack us by sur-
prise, and oblige us to resist them; adding, that they
Would have the blood of those mcu, who were
killed there in our just defence, to answer for.

The old man was amazed at this relation, and
told us we were very much in the right to go away
to the north, and that, if he might advise us, it
. 'should be to sell the ship in China, which we might
very well do, and buy or build another in the coun.
try. ' And,' said he, ' though you will not getso
good a ship, yet you may get one able enough to
carry you and all your goods back again to Bengal.
or any where else.'

I told him, I would take his advice, when I came
to any port where I could find a ship for my turn.
or get any customer to buy this. He repliedJ
should meet with customers enough for the ship
at Nanquin, and that a Chinese junk would sent
me very well to go back again; and that he would
procure me people both to buy the one and sell
the other.

' Well, but, seignior,' says I, ' as you say they
know the ship so well, I may, perhaps, if I follow
.your measures, be instrumental to bring some ho.
nest, innocent men into a terrible broil, and, pet"
haps, occasion their being murdered in cold blood;
for wherever they find the ship, they will prove
the guilt upon the men, by proving this was the
ship, and so innocent men may probably be over-
powered and murdered. ' Why,' said the old man-
' I'll find out a way to prevent that also; for asI
know all those commanders you speak of very
well, and shall see them all as they pass by, Iwi"
be sure to set them to rights in the thing, and I"
them know that they had been so much in the
wrong, that though the people who were on board
at first, might run away with the ship, yet it was
not true that they had turned pirates; and that, in
particular, those were not the men that first went
oil" with the ship, but innocently bought her for
their trade: and I am persuaded they will so far
believe me, as, at least, to act more cautiously for
the time to come.' ' Well,' said I, ' and will you
deliver one message to themfrom- me?' ' Yesrl
will,' says he, ' if you will give it under your hand:
in writing, that I may be able to prove it came from
you, and not out of my own head." I answered
that I would readily give it him under my hand-noemsoiv CRUSOE. .561

So I took a pen and ink and paper, and wrote at
large the story of assaulting me with the long
boats, &c. the pretended reason of it, and the un-
just. cruel design of it, and concluded to the com-
manders that they had done what they not only
should have been ashamed of, but also, that if ever
they came to England, and I lived to see them
there, they should all pay dearly for it, if the laws
of my country were not grown out of use before I
arrived there.

My old pilot read this over and again, and
asked me several times, if I would stand to it. I
answered, I would stand to it as long as I had any
thing left in the world, being sensible thatI should,
one time or other, find an opportunity to put it
home to them. But we had no occasion ever to
let the pilot carry this letter; for he never went
back again. While those things were passing be-
tween us, by way of discourse, we went forward di-
rectly for Nanquin, and, in about thirteen days'
sail, we came to an anchor at the south-west point
of the great gulf of Nanquin, where, by the way,
I came, by accident, to understand that the two
Dutch ships were gone that length before me, and
that I should certainly fall into their hands. I
consulted my. partner again in this exigency, and he
was as much at a loss as I was, and would very
gladly have been safe on shore almost any where.
However, I was not in such perplexity neither, but
lashed the old pilot if there was no creek, or bar-
bour, which I might put into, and pursue my busi-
ness with the Chinese privately, and he in no dan-
tor of the enemy. He told me if I would sail to
the southward, about twoaud-forty leagues, there
was a little port, called Quiuchang, where the fa-
thers of the mission usually landed from Macao, on
their progress to teach the Christian religion to the
Chinese. and where no EurOpean ships ever put in ;
and if I thought to put in there, I might consider
what farther course to take when I was on shore.

B 2
He confessed, he said, it was not a place for met-
chants, except that, at some certain times, they had
a kind of fair there, when the merchants from Ja-
pan came over thither, to buy the Chinese mcr-
chandises.

We all agreed to go back to this place: the
name of the port, as he called it, I may, perhaps,
spell wrong; for I do-not particularly remember it.
having lost this, together with the names of many
other places set down in a little pocket-book, which
was spoiled by the water, on an accident whichI
shall relate in its order; but this I remember, that
the Chinese or Japanese merchants we correspond-
ed with, called it by a different name from that
which our Portuguese pilot gave it, and pronounced
it, as above, Quinchaug.

As we were unanimous in our resolutions to go to
this place, we weighed the next day, having only
gone twice on shore, where we were to get fresh
water: on both which occasions the people of the
country were very civil to us, and brought us abund-
ance of things to sell to us, I mean of provisions,
plants, roots, tca, rice, and some fowls; but nothing
without money.

We came to the other port (the wind being con-
trary) not till five days, but it was very much to
our satisfaction; and I. was joyful, and, I may say.
thankful, when I set my foot safe on shore, resolv-
ing, and my partner too, that, if it was possible to
dispose of ourselves and effects any other way.
though not every way to our satisfaction, we would
never set foot on board that unhappy vessel more:
and indeed I must acknowledge, that,of all the cir-
cumstances of life that ever I had any experience
of, nothing makes mankind so completely miser-
able as that of being in constant fear. Well does
the Scripture say, ' The fear of man bringsa snarez'
it is a life of death; and the mind is so entirely
oppressed by it, that it is capable of no relief; the
animal spirits sink, and all the vigour of nature:
which usually support men under other afflictions,
and is present to them in the greatest exigencies,
fails them there. -

Nor did it fail of its usual operations upon the
fancy, by heightening every danger, representing
the English and Dutch captains to be men uncapn-
ble of hearing reason, or distinguishing between ho-
nest men and rogues, or between a story calculated
for our own turn, made out of nothing, on purpose
to deceive, and a true, genuine account of our
whole voyage, progress, and design 3 for we might
many ways have convinced any reasonable creature,
that we were not pirates; the goods we had on
board, the course we steer-ed, our frankly showing
ourselves, and entering into such and such ports;
even our very manner, the force we had, the number
of men, the few arms, little ammunition, short pro-
visions; all these would have served to convince
any men that we were no pirates. The opium, and
other goods we had on board, would make it ap-
pear the ship had been at Bengal; the Dutchmen,
who, it was said, had the names of all the men
that were in the ship, might easily see that we
were a mixture of English, Portuguese, and Indians,
and but two Dutchmen on board. These and
many other particular circumstances might have
made it evident to the understanding of any com-
mander, whose hands we might fall into, that we
were no pirates.

But fear, that blind, useless passion, worked on-
other way, aud threw us into the vapours: it be-
wildered our understandings, and set the imagina~
tlon at work, to form a thousand terrible things
that, perhaps, might never happen. We first sup~
Posed, as indeed every body had related to us, that
the seamen on board the English and Dutch ships,
but especially the Dutch, were so enraged at the
name of a pirate, and especially at our beating off
their boats, and escaping, that they would not give
lhemselves leave to inquire, whether we were
pirates or no; but would execute us off hand, as
we call it, without giving us any room for a do
fence. We reflected, that there was really so much
apparent evidence before them, that they would
scarce inquire after any more; as, first, that the
ship was certainly the same, and that some of the
seamen among them knew her, and had been on
board her; and, secondly, that when we had intel-
ligence at the river Cambodia, that they were com-
ing down to examine us, we fought their boats, and
fled; so that we made no doubt but they were as
fully satisfied of our being pirates, as we were satiso
fled of the contrary: and I often said, I knew not
but I should'have been apt to have taken the like
circumstances for evidence, if the tables were
turned, and my case was theirs, and have made no
scruple of cutting all the crew to pieces, without
believing, or perhaps considering, what they might
have to offer in their defence.

But let that be how it will, those were our apo
prehensions; and both my partner and I too scarce
slept a night without dreaming of halters and
yard-arms, that is to say, gibbets; of fighting, and
being taken; of killing, and being killed; and one
night I was in such a fury in my dream, fancying
the Dutchmen had boarded us, and I was knocking
one of their seamen down, that I struck my doubled
fist against the side of the cabin I lay in, with such
a force as wounded my hand most grievously.
broke my knucles, and cut and bruised the flesh.
so that it not only awaked me out of my sleep, but
I was once afraid I should have lost two of my
fingers. '

Another apprehension I had, was, of the cruel
usage we should meet with from them, if we fell
into their hands. Then the story of Amboyna
came into my head, and how the Dutch might, per-
haps, torture us, as they did our countrymen there.
and make some of our men. by extremity of cor-
ture, confess those crimes which they never were
guilty of; mm themselves, and all of us, to be pio
rates, and so they would put us to death, with a
formal appearance of justice; and that they might
be tempted to do this, for the gain of our ship and
cargo, which was worth four or five thousand
pounds, put all together.

These things tormented me, and my partner too,
night and day: nor did we consider that the cap-
tains of ships have no authority to act thus; and
if we had surrendered prisoners to them, they
could not answer the destroying us, or torturing us,
but would be accountable for it when they came
into their own country: this, I say, gave me no se-
tisfaction, for if they will not thus with us, what
advantage would it be to us, that they would'be
called to account for it; or, if we were first to be
murdered, what satisfaction would it be to us to
have them punished when they came home?

Icaunot refrain taking notice here what reflec-
tious I now had upon the past variety of my parti-
cular circumstances; how hard I thought it was,
'that I, who had spent forty years in a life of con-
tinued difficulties, and Was, at last, come, as it
were. to the port or haven which all men drive at,
yiz. to have rest and plenty, should be a volunteer
to new sorrows, by'my own unhappy choice; and
that I, who had escaped so many dangers in my
)'outh, should now come to be hanged in my old
age, and in so remote a place, for a crime I was
not in the least inclined to, much less guilty of.
and in a place and circumstance where innocence
Was not like to be any protection at all to me.

After these thoughts, something of religion would
come in; and I would be considering that this
seemed to me to be a disposition of immediate Pro-
}'ldence, and I ought to look upon it, and submit to
1t; as such; that although I was innocent as to men,
I was far from being innocent as to my Maker;
and I ought to look in, and examine what other
cmnus in my life were most obvious to me, and
for which Providence might justly inflict this my
nishment, as a retribution; and that I ought to
submit to this, just as I would to a shipwreck, if it
had pleased God to have brought such a disaster
upon me.

In its turn, natural courage would sometimes
take its place, and then I would be talking myself
up to vigorous resolutions, that I would not be
taken to be barbarously used,.by a parcel of mer-
ciless wretches, in cold blood: that it was much
better to have fallen into the hands of the savages,
who were men-eaters, and who, I was sure, would
feast upon me, when they had taken me, than
by those who would, perhaps, glut their rage
upon me by inhuman tortures and barbarities;
that, in the case of the savages, I always resolved
to die fighting to the last gasp ; and why should I
not do so now, seeing it was much more. dread-
ful, to me at least, to think of falling into these
men's hands, than ever it was to think of being
eaten by men; for the savages, give them their
due, would not eat a man till he was dead, and
killed him first. as we do a bullock; but that these
men had many arts beyond the cruelty of death.
Whenever these thoughts prevailed, l was sure to
put myself into a kind of fever with the agitations
ofa supposed light: my blood would boil, and my
eyes sparkle, as if Iwas engaged; and I always
resolved that I would take no quarter at their
hands; but even, at last, ifl could resist no longer.
I would blow up the ship, and all that was in her,
and leave them but little booty to boast of.

By how much the greater weight the anxieties
and perplexities of these things were to our
thoughts, while we were at sea, by so much the
greater was our satisfaction, when we saw QUP
selves on shore; and my partner told me he
dreamed that he had a very heavy load upon his
back, which he was to carry up a hill, and found
that he was not able to stand long under it; but

\
the Portuguese pilot came, and took it off his
back, and the hill disappeared, the ground before
him showing all smooth and plain. And truly it
was so ; we were all like men who had a load taken
off their backs. '

For my part, I had a weight taken off from my
heart, that I was not able any longer to bear; and,
as I said above, we resolved to go no more to sea
in that ship. When we came on shore, the old
pilot, who was now our friend, got us a "lodging,
and a warsehouse for our goods, which, by the way,
was much the same: it was a little house, or hut,
with a large house joining to it, all built with
canes, and palisadoed round with large canes, to
keep out pilfering thieves, of which, it seems, there
were not a few in the country. However, the ma-
gistrates allowed us also a little guard, and we had
asoldier, with a.- kind of halbert, or halfpike, who
stood sentinel at our door, to whom we allowed a
piut'of rice, and a little piece of money, about the
value of three-pence per day, so that our goods
were kept very safe.

The fair, or mart, usually kept in this place, had
been over some time: however, we found that there
were three or four junks in the river, and two Ja-
Panese, I mean ships from Japan, with goods which
they had bought in China, and were not gone away,
having Japanese merchants on shore.

The first thing our old Portuguese'pilot did for
"F, was, to bring us acquainted with three mis-
sionary Romis'n priests, who were in the town, and
who had been there some time, converting the peo-
pie to Christianity; but we thought 'they made
but poor work of it, and made them but sorry
Christians when they had done. However, that
was not our business. One of these was a French-
' "'{m' whom they called Father Simon: he was
a JOHL well-conditioned man, very free in his con-
versation, not seeming so serious and grave as
the other two did; one of whom was a Portu-
guese, and the other a Genoese: but Father Simon
was courteous, easy in his manner, and very agree-
able company; the other two were more reserved,
seemed rigid and austere, and applied seriously to
the work they came about it, viz. to talk with, and
insinuate themselves among the inhabitants, when
ever they had opportunity. We often eat and drank
with those men: and though I must confess the
conversion, as they call it, of the Chinese to Chris-
tianity, is so far from the true conversion required
to bring heathen people to the faith of Christ,
that it seems to amount to little more than letting
them know the name of Christ, say some prayers
to the Virgin Mary and her Son, in a tongue which
they understand not, and to cross themselves, and
the like; yet it must be confessed. that these re-
ligious, whom we call missionaries, have a firm
belief, that these people shall be saved, and that
they are the instrument of it: and, on this account,
they undergo, not only the fatigue of the voyage;
and hazards of living in such places, but often-
times death itself, with the most violent tortures.
for the sake of this work; and it would be a great
want of charity in us, whatever opinion we have 0!
the work itself, and the manner of their doing it.
if we should not have a good opinion of their zeal.
who undertake it with so many hazards, and who
have no prOSpect of the least temporal advantage
to themselves.

But to return to my story: this French priest:
Father Simon, was appointed, it seems, by order
of the chief of the mission, to go up to Pekin. "'0
royal seat of the Chinese emperor, and waited
only for another priest, who was ordered to conic
to him from Macao, to go along with him. and we
scarce ever met together, but he was inviting me
to go that journey with. him, telling me how he
would show me all the glorious things of that
mighty empire, and, among the rest, the greatest
city in the world; ' a-city,' said he, ' that your
London and our Paris, put together, cannot be
equal to.' This was the city of Pekin, which, I
confess, is very great, and infinitely full of peo-
ple; but as I looked on those things with different
eyes from other men, so I shall give my opinion
of them in a few words, when 1 come, in the
course of my travels, to speak more particularly
of them.

But, first, I come to my friar. or missionary:
dining with him one day, and being very merry
together, I showed some little inclination to go
with him, and be pressed me and my partner very
hard, and with a great many pcrsuasions to con-
sent. ' Why, Father Simon,' says my. partner, ' why
should you desire our company so much? You
know we are heretics, and you do not love us, nor
can keep us company with any pleasure.' ' O,'
says he, ' you may, perhaps, be good Catholics in
time: my business here is to convert heathens;
and who knows but I may convert you too?' ' Very
well, father,' said I; 'so you will preach to us all
the way.' ' I will not be troublesome to you,' said
he. ' Our religion does not divest us of good man-
ners: besides,' said he, ' we are here like country-
fllen, and so we are, compared to the place we are
In; andif you are hugonots, and I a catholic, we
may be all Christians at last; at least,' said he,
' we are all gentlemen, and we may converse so
Without being uneasy to one another.' I liked that
part ofhis discourse very well, and it began to put
Die in mind of my priest, that I had left in the Bra-
snls; but this Father Simon did not come up to his
character by a great deal: for though Father Simon
had no appearance of a criminal levity in him nei- .
""38 yet he had not that fund of Christianzeal,
"mt piety, and sincere affection to religion, that
my Other good ecclesiastic had. of whom I have
said so much.

Buz to leave him a little, though he never left us,
her soliciting us to go with him; but we had some>>
thing else before us at that time, for we had all this
while our ship, and our merchandise, to dispose of:
and we began to be very doubtful what we should
do, for we were now in a place of very little busi-
ness; and once I was about to venture to sail for
the river Kilam, and the city of Nauquin: but Pro.
vidence seemed now more visibly, as I thought.
than ever, to concern itself in our afl'airs ; andl
was encouraged from this very time to think I
should, one way or other, get out of this tangled
circumstance, and be brought home to my own
country again, though I had not the least view of
the manner: and when I began sometimes to think
of it, could not imagine by what method it was to
be done. Providence, I say, began here to clear up
our way a little; and the first thing that offered
was, that our old Portuguese pilot brought a Japan
merchant to us, who began to inquire what good5
we had; and, in the first place, he bought all our
opium, and gave us a very good price for it, paying
us in gold, by weiglft, some in small pieces of their
own coin, and some in small wedges, of about ten
or eleven ounces each. While we were dealing With
him for our opium, it came into my head that he
might, perhaps, deal with us for the ship too; an"
ordered the interpreter to propose it to him. 118
shrunk up his shoulders at it, when it was first prO'
posed to him, but, in a few days after, he cameio
me, with one of the missionary priests for his "1'
terpreter, and told me he had a proposal to make
to me, and that was this: he had bought a 879'"
quantity of goods of us, when he had no though":
or proposals made to him, of buying the ship; 811d
that, therefore, he had not money enough to pay
for the ship: but if I would let the saline men Who
were in the ship navigate her, he would hire the
ship to go to Japan, and would send them from
thence to the Philippine islands with another load'
ing, which he would pay the freight of, before they
went from Japan, and that, at their return. he
would buy the ship. I began to listen to this pro-
posal; and so eager did my head still run upon
rambling, that I could not but begin to entertain
a notion myself of going with him, and so to sail
from the Philippine islands away to the South
Seas: and accordingly I asked the Japanese mer-
chant, if he would not hire us to the Philippine
islands, and discharge us there. He said, no, he
could not do that, for then he could not have the
return of his cargo; but he would'discharge us in
Japan, he said, at the ship's return. Well, still I was
for taking him at. that proposal, and going myself;
but my partner, wiser than myself, persuaded me
from it, representing the dangers, as well of the
seas as of the Japanese, who are a false, cruel,
and treacherous people, and then of the Spaniards,
at the Philippines, more false, more cruel, more
treacherous, than they.

But to bring this long turn of our affairs to a
conclusion; the first thing we had to do was to
consult with the captain of the ship, and with the
men, and know if they were willing to go to Japan:
and, while I was doing this, the young man, whom,
as I said, my nephew had left with me as my com-
panion for my travels, came to me, and told me,
that he thought that voyage promised very fair,
and that there was a great prospect of advantage,
and he would be very glad if I undertook it; but '
that if I would not, and would give him leave,
he would go as a merchant, or how I pleased to
order him; that if ever he came to England, and I
Was there, and alive, he would render me a faithful
account of his success, and it should be as much
mine as l pleased.

. I was really loath to part with him ; but consider-
ml-l the prospect of advantage, which was really
considerable, and that he was a young fellow as
likely to do well in it as any I knew, I inclined to
let him go; but first I told him, I would consult
m)' partner, and give him an answer the next day.

W-- W---

     

l
My partner and I discoursed about it ; and my part
ner made a most generous offer. He told me,
' You know it has been an unlucky ship, and we
_ both resolved not to go to sea in it again: if your

steward (so he called my man) will venture the
voyage, I'll leave my share of the,vessel to him.
and let him make the best of it; and if we live to
meet in England, and he meets with success
abroad, he shall account for one half of the profits
of the ship's freight to us: the other shall be his
own.'

If my partner, who was no way concerned with
my young man, made him such an offer, I could do
no less than offer him the same ;_ and all the ship's
company being willing to go'with him, we made
over half the ship to him in property, and took a
writing from him, obliging him to account for the
other; and away he went to Japan. The Japan
merchant proved a very punctual, honest man to
him, protected him at Japan, and got him a licence
to come on shore, which the Europeans in general
have not lately obtained, paid him his freight verlY
punctual] y, sent him to the Philippines loaded with
Japan and China wares, and a supercargo of their
own, who, traflicking with the Spaniards, brought
back European goods again, and a great quantit!
of cloves and other spice: and there he was not
only paid his freight very well, and at a very good
price, but being not willing to sell the ship then:
the merchant furnished him with goods on his own
account; that for some money, and some spices of
his own, which he brought with him, he went back
- to the Maniilas to the Spaniards, where he sold
his cargo very well. Here, having gotten a .SSdegdegd
acquaintance at Mauilla, he got his ship made 3
free ship; and the governor of Manilla hired him
to go to Accapulco, in America, on the coast of
Mexico ; and gave him a licence to land there, and
travel to Mexico, and to pass in any Spanish ship
to EuroPe, with all his men.
ROBINSON CRUSOE. see

He made the voyage to Accapulco very happi-
ly, and there he sold his ship: and having there
also obtained allowance to travel by land to Porto

: Bello, he found means, some how or other, to go to
. Jamaica with all his treasure, and about eight years

after came to England exceeding rich: of which I
shall take notice in its place. In the mean time, I
return to our particular affairs.

Being now to part with the ship, and ship's com-
pany it came before us, of course, to consider what
recompense we should give to the two men that
gave us such timely notice of the design against
us in the river of Cambodia. The truth was, they
had done us a considerable service, and deserved
well at our hands; though, by the way, they were
a couple of rogues too; for as they believed the
story of our being pirates, and that we had really
run away with the ship, they came down to us,
not only to betray the design that was formed
against us, but to go to sea with us as pirates ; and
one of them confessed afterwards, that nothing else
but the hopes of. going a roguing brought him to
do it. However, the serVice they did us was not
the less; and therefore, as I had promised to be
grateful to them, I first ordered the money to be
paid to them, which they said was due to them on
board their respective ships; that is to say, to the
Englishman nineteen months' pay, and to the
Dutchman seven; and, over and above that, I gave
each of them a small sum of money in gold, which
contented them very well: then I made the Eng-
lishman gunner in the ship, the gunner being now
made second mate and purser; the Dutchman I
made boatswaiu. So they were both very well
pleased, and proved very serviceable, being both
able seamen, and very stout fellows.

We were now on shore in China. If I thought
myself banished, and remote from my own country
at Bengal, where I had many ways to get home for
my money, whatcould I think of myself now, when
I was gotten about a thousand leagues farther off
from home, and perfectly destitute of all manner
of prospect of return!

All we had for it was this, that, in about four
months' time there was to be. another fair at that
place where we were, and then we might be able
to purchase all sorts of the manufactures of the
country, and, withal, might possibly find some
Chinese juuks, or vessels, from'Nanquin, that
would be to be sold, and would carry us and our
goods whither we pleased. This I liked very
well, and resolved to wait; besides, as our par-
ticular persons were not obnoxious, so if any
English or Dutch ships came thither, perhaps we
might have an opportunity to load our goods, and
get passage to some other place in India nearer
home.

Upon these [tapes we resolved to continue here;
but, to divert ourselves, we took two or three jour-
neys into the country. First, we went ten days'
journey to see the city of Nanquin, a city well
worth seeing indeed. They say it has a million of
people in it, which, however, 1 do not believe: it
is regularly built,- the streets all exactly strait, and
cross one another in direct lines, which gives the
figure of it great advantage.

But when I came to compare the miserable peo-
ple of these countries with ours; their fabrics, their
manner of living, their government, their religion,
their wealth, and their glory (as some call it),I
must confess I do not so much as think it worth
naming, or worth my while to write of, or any Illa"
shall come after me to read.

It is very observable, that we wonder at the gran.
deur, the riches, the pomp, the ceremonies, the 30'
vernment, the manufactures, the commerce; 3""
the conduct of these people; not that it is to be
wondered at, or indeed in the least to be regarded,
but because having first a notion of the barbarily Of
those countries, the rudeness and the ignorance
that prevail there, we do not expect to find any
such things so far off.

Otherwise what are their buildings to the palaces
and royal buildings of EurOpe? What their trade
to the universal commerce of England, Holland,
France, and Spain? What their cities to ours, for
wealth, strength, gaiety of apparel, rich furniture,
and an infinite'variety? What are their ports, sup-
plied with a few juuks and barks, to our navigation,
our merchants' fleets, our large and powerful na-
vies? Our city of London has more trade than all
their mighty empire. One English, or Dutch, or
French man of war, of eighty guns, would fight
with. and destroy, all the shipping of China. But
the greatness of their wealth, their trade, the power
of their government, and strength of their armies, is
surprising to us ; because, as I have said. consider-
ing them as a barbarous nation of pagans, little
better than savages, we did not expect such things
among them; and this indeed is theadvautage with
which all their greatness and power is represented
10 us; otherwise it is in itself nothing at all: for, as
Ihare said of their ships, so may be said of their
armies and troops; all the forces of their empire,
$1100in they were to bring two millions of men
Into the field together, would be able to do nothing
bUt ruin the country, and starve themselves. If
they were to besiege a strong town in Flanders, or
10 fight a disciplined army, one line of German
euirassiers, or of French cavalry, would overthrow
' all the horse of China ; a million of their foot could
not stand before one embattled body of our infan-
t')'. posted so as not to be surrounded, though they
Were not to be one-and-twenty in number; nay, I
do not boastit' I say that thirty thousand German
0" English foot, and ten thousand French horse,
would fairly beat all the forces of China. And so
of our fortified towns, and of the art of 4 our cu-
glneersinassaulting and defending towns: there
5 net a fortified town in China could hold out one
month against the batteries and attacks of an Euro-
pean army; and, at the same time, all the armies of_-'
China could never take such a town as Dunkirk,
provided it was not starved; no, not in ten years'
siege. They have fire-arms, it is true; but they are
awkward, clumsy, and uncertain in going off: they
have powder, but it is of no strength: they have
neither discipline in the field, exercise to their
arms, skill to attack, nor temper to retreat; and
therefore I must confess it seemed strange to me:
when I came home, and heard our people say such
fine things of the power, riches, glory,magnificcnce,
and trade of the Chinese, because I saw and knew
that they were a contemptible herd, or crowd, of.
ignorant, sordid slaves, subjected to a government
qualified only to rule such a pc0ple; and, iua
word, for I am now launched quite beside my (16'
sign, I say, in a word, were not its distance incon.
ceivably great from Muscovy, and were not the
Muscovitc empire almost as rude, impotent, and ill-
governed a crowd of slaves as they,the czar of
Muscovy might, with much ease, drive them allout
of their country, and conquer them in one cam-
paign; and had the czar, who, I since hear, 15.3
growing prince, and begins to appear formidable In
the world, fallen this way, instead of artacking the
warlike Swedes, in which attempt none of the
powers of Europe would have envied or inter-
rupted him, he might,-hy this time have been em-
peror of China, instead of being beaten by the
king of Sweden at Narva, when the latter was not
one to six in number. As their strength and the!"
grandeur, so their navigation, commerce, and bust
bandry, is imperfect and impotent, compared to the
same things in Europe; also in their knowledge!
their learning, their skill in the sciences, the! 1'3""
globes and spheres, and a smatch of the knowledge
of the mathematics; but when you come to iuq'"re
into their knowledge, how short-sighted/are the
wisest of their students! They know nothing or
the motion of the heavenly bodies; and are so
grossly, absurdly ignorant, that when the sun is
eclipsed, they think it is a great dragon has as-
' saulted and run away with it, and they fall a clat-
tering with all the drums and kettles in the coun~
" try, to fright the monster away, just as we do to
hive a swarm of bees.

As this is the only excursion of this kind which I
have made in all the account 1 have given of my
travels, so I shall make no more descriptions of
countries and people; it is none of my business. or
any part of my design; but giving an account of
my own adventures, through a life of inimitable
wanderings and a long variety of changes, which,
'perhaps, few have heard the like of, I shall say no-
thing of the. mighty places, desert countries, and
numerous people, I have yet to pass through, more
than relates to my own story, and which my con-
cern among them will make necessary.----I was now,
as near as 'I can compute, in the heart of China,

about the latitude of thirty degrees north of the
' PM, for we were returned from Nanquin. I had
Indeed a mind to see the city of Pekin, which I had
heard so much of, and father Simon importuned me
daily to do it. At length his time of going away
a being set, and the other missionary, who was to go
with him, being arrived from Macao, it was neces-
Sary that we should resolve either to go or not to
9deg: So I referred him to my partner, and left it
_\\'holly to his choice, who, at length, resolved it
in the affirmative; and we prepared for our jour-
ney. We set out with very good advantage, as to
"filling the way; for we got leave to travel in the
rcunue of one of their mandarius, a kind ofviceroy,
~ or principal magistrate, in the province where they
"5'40: and who take great state upon them, tra-
velling with great attendance, and with great ho-
P'"8e from the people, who are sometimes greatly
""Poverished by them, because all the countries
they pass through are obliged to furnish provisions

2 C
for them and all their attendants. That which!
particularly observed, as to our travelling with liis<<_
baggage, was this, that though we received suffi-
cient provisions, both for ourselves and our horses.
from the country, as belonging to the mandarin, yet
we were obliged. to pay for every thing we had,'
after the market-price of the country, and the man-
darin's steward, or commissary of the provisions.
collected it duly from us; so that our travelling in
the rctinue of the mandarin, though it was a very
great kindness to us, was not such a mighty favour
in him, but was indeed a great advantage to him.
considering there were about thirty other people.
travelled in the same manner besides 'us, under
the protection of his retinue, or, as we may call it.
under his convoy. This, 1 say, was a great ad-
vantage to him; for the country furnished all the
provisions for nothing, and he took all our money
for them. ~ .
We were five-and-twenty days travelling to Pekin.
through a country infinitely populous, but miserv
ably cultivated; the husbandry, economy, and the.
way of living, all very miserable, though they boast
so much of the industry of the people: I say. 1111'
serable; and so it is, if we, who understand howto -
live, were to endure it, or to compare it with 011r
own ; but not so to these poor wretches who know
no other. The pride of these people is infinitely
great, and exceeded by nothing but their poverll't
which adds to that which I call their misefl'
I must needs think the naked-"savages of Amenca
live much more happy, because, as they have 00'
thing, so they desire nothing; whereas these a"
proud and insolent, and, in the main, are'tnele
beggars and drudges: their ostentation is me:-
pressible. and is chiefly shown in their cloth95
and buildings, and in the keeping multitudes 0'
servants, or slaves, and, which is to the'last 603'"
ridiculous, their contempt of all the world b"!
~themselv s. '
1 must confess, I travelled more pleasantly after.
wards in the deserts and vast wildernesses of Grand
Tartary. than here: and yet the roads here are well'
paved, and well kept, and very convenient for tra-
vellers; but nothingwas more awkward to me than
to see. such a haughty, imperious, insolent people,
in the midst of the grossest simplicity and igno-
rance; for all their famed ingenuity is no more.
My friend, Father Simon, and I, used to be very
merry' upon these occasions, to see the beggarly
pride of those peOple; for example, coming by the.
. house of a country gentleman, as Father Simon
called him, about ten leagues off of the city of
Nanquin, we had, first of all, the honour to ride
with the master of the house, about two miles: the
state he rode in, was a perfect Don Quixotism,
being a mixture of pomp and poverty.

The habit of this greasy Don was very prOper for
a-scaramouch, or merryoandrew, being a dirty ca-
lico, with all the tawdry trappings of a fool's coat,
such as hanging sleeves, tafl'ety, and cuts and
slashes almost on every side. It covered a rich
taffety vest, as greasy as a butcher's, and which
testified that his honour must needs be a most ex~
quisite sloven. -

Ilis horse was a poor, lean, starved, hobbling
creature, such as in England might sell for about
thirty or forty shillings; and he had two slaves fol-
lowed him on foot to drive the poor creature along.
He had a whip in his hand, and he belaboured the
beast as fast about the head as his slaves did about
the tail; and thus he rode by us with about ten or
twelve servants, and we were told he was going
from the city to his country seat, about half a
10aEllie before us. We travelled on gently, but
this figure of a gentleman rode away before us; and
as we stopped at-a village about an hour to refresh
"5, when we came by the country seat ofthis great
man, we saw him in a little place, before his door,
eating his rcpast: it was a kind of a garden, but he
was easy to be seen, and we were given to under-
stand that the more we looked on him the better he
would be pleased.

He sat under a tree, something like the palmetto
tree, which effectually shaded him over the head,
and on the south side ; but under the tree also was
placed a large umbrella, which made that part look
well enough. He sat lolling back in a great elbow
chair, being a heavy, corpulent man, and his meat
being brought him by two women slaves: he had
two more, whose office, I think, few gentlemen in
Europe would accept of their service in, viz. one
fed the squire with a Spoon, and the other held the
dish with one hand, and scraped off what he let
fall upon his worship's beard and tafl'ety vest with
the other; while the great, fat brute thought it
below him to employ his own hands in any of those
familiar offices which kings and monarchs would ru-
ther do than be troubled with the clumsy fingers of
their servants.

I took this time to think what pains men's pride
puts them to, and how troublesome a haughty tem-
. per, thus ill managed, must be to a man of com.
mon sense; and leaving the poor wretch to please
himself with our looking at him, as if we ad~
mired his pomp, whereas we really pitied and con-
temued him, we pursued our journey: only Father
Simon had the curiosity to stay to inform himself
what dainties the country justice had to feed on,
in all his state, which he said he had the honour
to taste of, and which was, I think, a dose that an
English hound would scarce have eaten, if it had
been offered him, viz. a mess of boiled rice, with a
great piece of garlic in it, and a little bag filled with
green pepper, and another plant which' they have
there, something like our ginger, but smelling like
musk, and tasting like mustard. All this was put
together, and a small lump or piece of lean mut-
ton boiled in it: and this was his worship's {9'
past, four or five servants more attending at a (115'
tance. If he fed them meaner than he was fed
himself, the spice excepted, they must fare very

coarsely indeed.
As for our mandarin, with whom we travelled, he

was respected like a king, surrounded always with
his gentlemen, and attended in all his appearances
with such pomp, that I saw little of him but at a
distance; but I observed that there was not ahorse
in his retinue, but that our carriers' pack-horses in
England seem to me to look much better; but they
were so covered with equipage, mantles, trappings,
and such like trumpery, that you could not see
whether they were fat or lean. In a word,we could
see scarce any thing but their feet and their heads.

I was now light-hearted, and all my trouble and
perplexity, that I have given an account of, being
over, I had no anxious thoughts about me, which
made this journey much the pleasanter to me; nor
had 1 any ill-accident attended me, only in the pass-
ing or fording a small river, my horse fell, and made
me free of the country,'as they call it; that is to
say, threw me in: the place was not deep, but it
Wetted me all over. I mention it because it spoiled
my pocket book, wherein I had set down the names
of several pe0ple and places which I had occasion
to remember, and which not taking due care of, the
leaves rotted, and the words were. never after to be
read, to my great loss as to the names of some
places which I touched at in this voyage.

At length we arrived at Pekin. I had nobody
with me but the youth whom my nephew, the cap-
tain, had given me to attend me as a servant, and
Who proved very trusty and diligent; and my part-
ner had nobody with him but one servant, who was
a kinsman. As for the Portuguese pilot, he being
desirous to see the court, we gave him his passage,
that is to say, bore his charges for his company,
and to use him as an interpreter, for he understood
the language of the country, and spoke good French,
and a little English; and indeed this old man was a
most useful implement to us 'every where; for we
had not been above a week at Pekin, when he
came laughing. ' Ah, seignior Inglese,' said he, ' I
have something to tell you, will make your heart
glad.' ' My heart glad! ' said I. ' What can that
be? I don't know any thing in this country can
either give me joy or grief, to any great degree.'
' Yes, yes,' said the old man, in broken English,
' make you glad, me sorrow :' sorry, he would have
said. This made me more inquisitive : ' Why,' said
I, ' will it make you sorry?' ' Because,' said he,
' you have brought me here twenty-five days' jour-
ney, and will leave me to go back alone, and which
way shall I get to my port afterwards, without a
ship, without a horse, without pecune?' so he call-
ed money, being his broken Latin, of which he had
abundance to make us merry with.

In short, he told us there was a great caravan of
Muscovite and Polish merchants in the city, and
they were preparing to set out on their journey,
by land, to Muscovy,within four or five weeks, and
he was sure we would take the opportunity to g0
with them, and leave him behind to go back all
alone. I confess I was surprised with his news: a
secret joy spread itself over my whole soul, which
I cannot describe, and never felt before, or since;
and I had no power, for a good while, to speak8
word to the old man, but at last I turned to him,
" ' How do you know this?' said I. ' Are you sure
it is true?' ' Yes,' said he, ' I met this morning, in
the street, an old acquaintance of mine, an Arme-
nian, or one you call a Grecian, who is among
. them; he came last from Astracan, and was de-
signing to go to Tonquin, where I formerly knew
him, but has altered his mind, and is now resolved
to go back with the caravan to Moscow, and so
down the river of Wolga to Astracan.' ' Well,
~seignior,' said I, ' do not be uneasy about being
_ieft to go back alone: if this be a method for'my
return to England, it shall be your fault, if you PS0
back to Macao at all.' We then went to consult--
ing together what was to be done; and I asked my
partner what he thought of the pilot's news, and
whether it would suit with his affairs. He told me
he would do just as I would, for he had settled all
his 'afi'airs so well at Bengal, and left his effects in
such good hands, that 'as we had made a good
voyage here, if he could vest it in China silks,
wrought and raw, such as might be worth the car-
riage, he would be content to go to England, and
then make his voyage back to Bengal by the Com-
pany's ships.

Having resolved upon this, we agreed that if our
Portugal pilot would go with us, we would hear
his charges to Moscow. or to England, if he. pleas-
ed; nor indeed were we to be esteemed over gene-
rous in that part neither, if we had not rewarded
him farther; for the service he had done us was
really worth all that, and more, for he had not only
been a pilot to us at sea, but he had been also like
a broker for us on shore; and his procuring for us
the Japan merchant was some hundreds of pounds'
in our pockets. So we consulted together about it,
and being willing to gratify him, which was indeed
but doing him justice, and very willing also to have
him with us besides, for he was a most necessary
man on all occasions, we agreed to give him a.
quantity of coined gold, which, as I compute it,
came to about one hundred and seventy-five pounds
sterling between us,'and to bear his charges, both
for himself and horse, eitcept only a. horse to carry
his goods.

Having settled this among ourselves. we called
him to let him know what we had resolved. I told
him he had complained of our being like to let him
80 back alone, and I was now to tell him we were.
resolved he should not go back at all: that as we
had resolved to go to Europe with the caravan, we
resolved also he should go with us, and that we
called him to know his mind. He shook his head
and said it was a long journey, and he had no
pecune-to carry him thither, nor to subsist himself
when he came thither. We told him we believed
it was so, and therefore we had resolved to do
something for him, that should let him see how
sensible we were of the service he had done us, and
also how agreeable he was to us; and then I told
him what. we had resolved to give him here, which
he might lay out as we would do our own, and that
as for his charges, if he would go with us, we would
set him safe ashore (life and casualties excepted)
either in Muscovy or England, which he would, at
our own charge, except only the carriage of his
goods. '

He received the proposal like a man transported,
and told us, he would go with us over the whole
world; and so, in short, we all prepared ourselves
for the journey. However, as it was with us, so it '
Was with the other merchants, they had many
things to do; and, instead of being ready in five
weeks, it was four months and some odd days be-
fore all things were got together.

It Was the beginning of February, our style, when
we set out from Pekin. My partner and the 0ch
pilot had gone express back to the port where we
had first put in, to dispose of some goods which
we had left there; and I, with a Chinese merchant.
whom I had some knowledge of at Nanquin, and
who came to Pekin on his own affairs, went to
Nanquin, where I bought ninety pieces of fine da-
masks, with about two hundred pieces of other very
fine silks, of several sorts, some mixed with gold;
and had all these brought to Pekin against my
partner's return. Besides this, we bought a vet.)l
large quantity of,raw silk, and some other goods;
our cargo amounting, in these goods only, to about
three thousand five hundred pounds sterling, which,
together with tea and some fine calicocs, and
three camel loads of nutmegs and cloves, loaded
in all eighteen camels for our share, besides thOSO
we rode upon, which, with two or three spare
horses, and two horses loaded with provisions,
made us, in short, twentysix camels and horses in
our retinue. . .

The company was very great, and, as near as I
can remember, made between three and four hun-
dred horses and camels, and upwards of a hundred
and twenty men, very well armed, and provided
for all events: for as the eastern caravans are
subject to be attacked by the Arabs, so are these
by the Tartars; but they are not altogether so
dangerous as 'the Arabs, nor so barbarous when they
prevail.

The company consisted of people of several na-
tions, such as Muscovites chiefly, for there were
above sixty of them who were merchants or inha~
bitants of Moscow; though of them some were Li-
VOnians, and, to our particular satisfaction, five of
them were Scots, who appeared also to be men or"
great experience in business, and of very good
substance. '

When we had travelled one day's journey, the
guides, who were five in number, called all the gen-
tlemen and merchants, that is to say, all the pas-
Sengcrs, except the servants, to a great council, as
they termed it. At this great council every one
d8posited a certain quantity of money to a com-
mon stock, for the necessary expense of buying
forage on the way, where it was not otherwise to
be had, and for satisfying the guides,getting horses,
and the like. And here they constituted the jouro'
ney, as they called it, viz. they named captains and
Officers to draw us all up, and give the command
in case of an attack, and gave every one their turn
0f command. Nor was this forming us into order
My more than what we found needful upon the
Wily. as shall be observed in its place.

The road on all this side of the country is very
Populous, and is full of potters, and earth-makers,
that is to say, people that tempered the earth for

2 C 2
the China ware; and, as 1 was going along, our
Portugal pilot, who had always something or other
to say to make us merry, came sneering to me, and
told me, he would show me the greatest rarity in
all the country, and that I should have this to say
of China, after all the ill-humoured things I had
said of it, that I had seen one thing which was not
to be seen in all the world beside. I was very im-
portunate to know what it was; at last, he told me,
it was a gentleman's house, built all with China
ware. ' Well,' said I, ' are not the materials of
their building the product of their own' country?
and so it is all China ware, is it not?' ' No, no}
says he, ' I mean it is a house all made of China
ware, such as you call so in England, or, as it is
called in our country porcelain.' ' Well,' said I.
' such a thing may be. How big is it? Can we
carry it in a box upon a camel? If we can, we
will buy it.' ' Upon a camel!' said the old pilot,
holding up both his hands; ' why there is a family
of thirty peeple lives in it.'

I was then curious indeed to see it, and whcnI
came to it, it was nothing but this: it was a timber
house, or a house built, as we call it in England,
_ with lath and plaster, but all the plastering was
really China ware, that is to say, it was plastered
with the earth that makes China ware.

The outside, which the sun shone hot upon, W85
glazed, and looked. yery well, perfectly white, and
painted with blue figures, as the large China were
in England is painted, and hard as if it had been
burned. As to the inside, all the walls, instead of
wainscoat, were lined up with hardened and painted
tiles, like the little square tiles we call gally-tiles
in England, all made of the finest China, and the
figures exceedingly line indeed, with extraordinary
variety of colours, mixed with gold, many tiles mak-
ing but one figure, but joined so artificially with
mortar, being made of the saine earth, that it was
very hard to see where the tiles met. The floors
of the rooms were of the same composition, and as
hard as the earthen floors we have in use in several
parts of England, especially Lincolnshire, Notting:
hamshire, Leicestershire, &c. as hard as stone and
smooth, but not burned and painted, except some
smaller rooms, like closets, which were all, as it
were, paved with the same' tile, the ceilings, and,
in a word, all the plastering work in the whole
house, were of the same earth; and, after all, the
roof'was covered with tiles of the same, but of a
deep, shining black.

This was a China warehouse, indeed, truly and
literally to be called so; and, had I not been upon
the journey, I could have staid some. days to see
and examine the particulars of it. They told me
there were fountains and fish-ponds in the garden,
all'paved at the bottom and sides with the same,
and fine statues set up in rows on the walks, en-
tirely formed of the porcelain earth, and burned
whole.

As this is one of the singularities .of China, so
they may be allowed to excel in it; but I am very
Sure they excel in their accounts of it, for they told
me such incredible things of their performance in
crockery ware, for such it is, that I care not to
relate, as knowing it could not be true. One, told
me. in particular, ofa workman that made a ship,
with all its tackle, and masts, and sails, in earthen
W370. big enough to carry fifty men. If he had
[01d me. he launched it, and made a voyage to
Jflp'dn in it, 1 might have said something to it in-
deed ; but, as it was, I knew the whole story, which
"as. in short, asking pardon for the word, that
the fellow lyed. So I smiled, and said nothing
to it.

This odd sight kept me two hours behind the ca-
"'V'm. for which the leader of it for the day lined
_me about the .value of three shillings; and told me,
if it had been three days' journey without the wall,
.33 It was three days within, he must have lined me
four times as much, and made me ask pardon the
next council-day ; so I promised to be more orderly,
for indeed I found afterwards the orders made for
keeping all together, were absolutely necessary for
our common safety.

In two days more we passed the great Chin}!
wall, made for a fortification against the Tartars';
and a very great work it is, going over hills and
mountains in an endless track, where the rocks
are impassable, and the precipices such as no enemy
could possibly enter, or indeed climb up, or where,
if they did, no wall could hinder them. They tell
us its length is near a thousand English miles, but
that the country is five hundred in a straight men-
sured-line, which the wall bounds, without measur-
ing the windings and turnings it takes: it is about
four fathom high, and as many thick in some
places.

I stood still an hour, or thereabout, without tres-
pessiug on our orders, for so long the caravan was
in passing the gate; I say, I stood still an hour to
look at it on every side, near and far off; I mean
what was within my view; and the guide of our
caravan, who had been extolling it for the wonder
of the world, was mighty eager to hear my opinion
of it. I told him it was a most excellent thing to
keep off the Tartars; which he happened not to
understand as I meant it, and so took it for a com-
pliment: but the old pilot laughed; ' O seigniof
Inglese,' said he, ' you speak in colours.' ' In co-
lours!' said I; ' what do you mean by that."
' Why you speak what looks white this way, and
black 'that way; gay one way, and dull another
Way: you tell him it is a good wall to keep out
Tartars; you tell me by that, it is good for nothing
but to keep out Tartars; or, it will keep out none
but Tartars. I understand you, seignior Inglese} I
understand you,' said be, joking; ' but seilln'or
Chinese'understand you his own way.'

' ' Well,' said I, ' seignior, do you think it would
stand out an army of our country people, with a
good train of artillery; or our engineers, with two
companies of miners? Would they not batter it down
in ten days, that an army might enter in battalia, or
blow it up into the air, foundation and all, that there
should be no sign of it left E' ' Aye, aye,' said he,
' lknow that.' The Chinese wanted mightily to
know what I said, and I gave him leave to tell him
a few days after, for we were then almost out of
their country, and he was to leave us in a little
time afterwards; but when he knew what I had said,
he was dumb all the rest of the way,.and we heard
no more of his line story of the Chinese power and
greatness while he staid.

After we had passed this mighty nothing, called
a Wall, something like the Picts' wall, so famous in
Northumberland, and built by the Romans, we be-
gan to find the country thinly inhabited, and the
PEOPIe rather confined to live in fortified towns and
cities, as being subject to the inroads and depreda.
tions of the Tartars, who rob in great armies. and
therefore are not to be resisted by the naked inha-
bitants of an open country.

And here I. began to find the necessity of keeping
together in a caravan as we travelled; for we saw
several tr00ps of Tartars roving 'about: but when I
came to see them distinctly, 1' wondered more that
the Chinese empire could be conquered by such
contemptible fellows; for they are a mere herd, or
crowd, of wild fellows, keeping no order, and un-
derstanding uo discipline or manner of fight. ' _

Their horses are poor, lean, starved creatures,
taught nothing, and are fit for nothing; and this we
found the first day we saw them,which was afterwe
entered the wilder part of the country. Our leader
for the day gave leave for about sixteen of us to go
a hunting, as they call it! and what was this but
hunting of sheep! However, it may be called hunt-
mg, too, for the creatures are the wildest, "and
awiftest of foot, that ever I saw of their kind, only
they will not run a great way; and you are sure of
sport when you begin the chase, for they appear
generally by thirty or forty in a flock, and, liketrue
sheep, always keep together when they fly.

In pursuit of this odd sort of game, it was our
hap to meet with about forty Tartars: whether they
were hunting mutton, as we were, or whether they
looked for another kind of prey, I know not; but,
as soon as they saw us, one of them blew a kind of
horn very loud, but with a barbarous sound that I
had never heard-before, and, by the way, never care
to hear again. We all supposed this was to call
their friends about them; and so it was: for in less
than half a quarter of an hoor a troop of forty or
fifty more appeared, at about a mile distance; but
our work was over first, as it happened.

One of the Scots merchants of Moscow happened
to be amongst us; and as soon as he heard the
horn he told us, in short, that we had nothing to
do but to charge them immediately, without loss of
time; and, drawing us up in a line, he asked if we
were resolved? We toid him we were ready to fol-
low him. So we rode directly up' to them. They
stood gazing at us like a mere crowd, drawn up in
no order, not showing the face of any order at all;
but as soon as they saw us advance, they let fly
their arrows, which, however, missed us, very hap-
pily. It seems they mistook not their aim, but
their distance; for their arrows all fell a little short
of us, but with so true an aim, that, had we been
about twenty yards nearer, we must have had seve~
ral men wounded, if not killed.

Immediately we halted; and, though it was at 8
great distance, we fired, and sent them leaden bul-
lets for wooden arrows, following our shot full gal-
lop, resolving to fall in among them sword in hand,
for so our bold Scot that let us directed. He was:
indeed, but a merchant, but he behaved with that
vigour and bravery on this occasion, and yet with
such a .cool courage too, that I never saw any man
in action fitter for command. As soon as we came '
up to them, we fired our pistols in their faces, and
then drew; but they fled in the greatest confusion
imaginable: the only stand any of them made was
on our right, where three of them stood, and by
signs called the rest to come back to them, having
a kind of Scimitar in their hands, and their bows
hanging at their backs. Our brave commander,
without asking any body to follow him, galloped
up close to them, and with his fusil knocked one of
them off his horse, killed the second with his pistol,
and the third ran away ; and thus ended our fight.
But we had this misfortune attending it, viz. that
all our mutton that we had in chase got away. We
had not a man killed or hurt; but as for the Tar-
tar-'5. there were about five of them killed: how
many were wounded we knew not; but this we
knew, that the other party were so frightened with
the noise of our guns, that they fled, and never
made any attempt upon us. -

We were all this while in the Chinese dominion,
and therefore the Tartars were not so bold as after-
wards; but in about five days we entered a vast,
great, wild desert, which hold us three days and
nights' march; and we were obliged to carry our
water with us in great leather bottles, and to en-
camp all night, just as I have; heard they do in the
deserts of Arabia.

I asked our guides, whose dominion this was in?
and they told me, this was a kind of border, that
might he called NoMan's Land; beinga part of the
Great ~Karakathay, or Grand Tartary; but that, how-
'ever, it was reckoned to China: that there was no
tare taken here to preserve it from the inroads of
thieves, and therefore it was reckoned the worst
desert in the whole march, though we were to go
over some much larger.

In passing this wllderness, which, I confess, was at
the first view Very frightful to me, we saw, two or
thl'ce times, little parties of the Tartars: but they
seemed to be upon their own afi'airs, and to have
no design upon us; and so, like the man who met
the devil, if they had nothing to say to us, we had
nothing to say to them, we let them go. . '

Once, however, a party Of them came so near as

to stand and gaze at us; whether it was to consider
what they should do,viz. to attack us, or notattack
us, we knew not; but when we had passed at some
distance by them, we made a rear-guard of forty
men, and stood ready for them, letting the caravan
pass half a mile, or thereabouts, before us. After
a white they marched off, only we found they sa-
luted us with five arrows at their parting, one of
which wounded 21 horse so that it disabled him, and
we left him the next day, poor creature, in great
need of a good farrier: we suppose they might
shoot more arrows, which might fall short of us,
but we saw no more arrows or Tartars at that
time. -
We travelled near a month after this, the ways
being not so good at first, though still in the dam.
nions of the emperor of China, but lay, for the most
part, in villages, some of which were fortified be.
cause of the incursions of the Tartars. When we
came to one of these towns (it was about two days
and a half'sjourney before we were to come to the
city of Naum), I wanted to buy a camel, of which
there are plenty to be sold all the way upon that
road, and of horses also, such as they are; because
so many caravans coming that way, they are VOW
often wanted. The person that I Spoke. to to 35'
me a camel would have gone and fetched it for me,
but I,-like a fool, must be officious, and go myself
along with him. The place was about two miles
out of the village, where, it seems. they kept the
camels and horses feeding under a guard.

I walked it on foot, with my old pilot in com--
pany, and a Chinese; being very desirous, forsooth>>
of a little variety. When we came to this place>> It
was a low, marshy ground, walled round with a
stone wall piled up dry, without mortar or earth
among it, like a park, with a little guard of Chinese
soldiers at the door. Having bought a camel, and
agreed for the price, I came away, and the Chinese
man that went with me led the came], when on a
sudden came up five Tartars on horseback: two of
them seized the fellow, and took the camel from
him, while the other three stepped up to me and
my old pilot; seeing us, as it were, unarmed, for I
had no weapon about me but my sword, which
could but ill defend me against three horsemen.
The first that came up stepped short upon my draw-
ing my sword (for they are arrant cowards), but a
second coming upon my left, gave me a blow on the
head, which 1 never felt till afterward, and won-
dered, when I came to myself, what was the matter
with me, and where I was, for he laid me flat on the
ground ; but my never-failing old pilot, the Portu-
guese (50 Providence, unlooked-for, directs deliver-
ances from dangers, which to us are unforeseen),
had a pistol in his pocket, which I knew nothing of,
nor the Tartars neither; if they had, I suppose they
would not have attacked us. But cowards are al-
ways boldest when there is no danger.

The old man, seeing me down, with a bold heart
stepped up to the fellow that had struck me, and
1flying hold of his arm with one hand, and pulling
him down by main force a little towards him with
the other, he shot him in the head, and laid him
dead on the spot; he then immediately stepped up
to him who had stopped us, as I said, and before he
could come forward again (for it was all done, as it
were, in a moment), made a blow at him with a
Scimitar, which he always wore; but, missing the
man, cut his horse into the side of his head, cut one
this ears off by the root, and a great slice down
the side of his face. The poor beast, enraged with
the wound, was no more to be governed by his rider,
though the fellow sat well enough too; but away he
flew, and'carried him quite out of the pilot's reach,
and at some distance, rising upon his hind legs;
threw down the Tartar, and fell upon him.

In this interval the poor Chinese came in who
had lost the camel, but he had no weapon; how-
ever, seeing the Tartar down, and his horse fallen
upon him, he runs to him, and seizing upon an ugly,
ill-favoured weapon he had by his side, something
like a pole-axe, but not a pole-axe neither, he
wrenched it from him, and made shift to knock his
Tartariau brains out with it.' But my old man had
the third Tartar to deal with still; and seeing he
did not fly, as he expected, nor come on to fight
him, as he apprehended, but stood stock-still, the
old man stood still too, and falls to work with his
tackle to charge his pistol again; but as soon as the
Tartar saw the pistol, whether he supposed it to be
the same or "another I know not, but away he
scoured, and left my pilot (my champion I called
him afterwards) a complete victory. '

By this time I was a little awake, for I thought>>
when I first began to awake, that I had been in a
sweet sleep ; but, as I said above, I wondered where
I was, how I came upon the ground, and what was
the matter; in a word, a few moments after,as
sense returned, I felt pain, though I did not know
where: I clapped my hand to my head, and took
it away bloody, then I felt my head ache, and them
in another moment, memory returned, and ever!
thing was present to me again;

I jumped up upon my feetinstantly, and got hold
of my sword, but no enemies in view. I found 8
Tartar lie dead, and his horse standing very quietly
by him; and looking farther, I saw my champion
and deliverer, who had been to see what the
Chinese had done, coming back with his hanger in
his hand. The old man, seeing me on my feet,
came running to me, and embraced me with 218"?"t
deal of-joy, being afraid before, that I had been
killed, and, seeing me bloody, would see how I was
hurt; but it was not much, only what we call a
broken head; neither did I afterwards find any
great inconvenience from the blow, other than the
place which washurt, and which was well again in
two or three days.
. We made no great gain, however, by this victory,
for we lost a camel and gained a horse: but that
which Was remarkable, when we came back to the
village, the man demanded to be paid for the camel.
I disputed it, and it-was brought to a hearing be.
fore the Chinese judge of the place; that is to say. in
English, we went before a justice of the peace.
Give him his due, he acted with a great deal of
prudence and impartiality, and, having heard both
sides, he gravely asked the Chinese man that went
with me to buy the camel, whose servant he was.
' I am no servant,' said he, ' but went with the
stranger.' ' At whose request?' said the justice.
' At the stranger's rcquest,' said he. ' Why then,'
Said the justice, ' you were the stranger's servant
f0r the time; and the camel being delivered to his
servant, it was delivered to him, and he must pay
for it.'

I confess the thing was so clear, that I had not
a Word to say; but admiring to see such just rea-
soning upon the consequence, and so accurate stat-
ing the case, I paid willingly for the camel,. and
sent foran'other: but you may observe, I sent for
It; I did not go to fetch it myself any more. I had
enough of that. ' v

The city of Naum is a frontier of the Chinese
empire, - They call it fortified, and so it is, as forti-
fications go there; fer this I will venture to affirm.
that all the Tartars in Karakathay, which, I be-
have, are some millions, could not batter down
the walls with their bows and arrows; but to
call it strong, if it were attacked with cannon,
would be to make those who understand it laugh
at. you. . ..
_ We'wanted, as I have said, above two days'
JOurney of this city, when messengers were sent
express to every part of the road, to tell all tra-
vellers and caravans to halt, till they had a guard
sent to them, for that an unusual body of Tartars,
making ten thousand in all, had appeared in the
way, about thirty miles beyond the city.

This was very bad news to travellers: however,
it was carefully done of the governor, and we were
very glad to hear we should have a guard. Ac-
cordingly, two days after, we had two hundred sol-
diers sent us from a garrison of the Chinese, on
our left, and three hundred more of the city of
Naum, and with those we advanced boldly. The
three hundred soldiers from Naum marched in our
front, the two hundred in our rear, and our rush
on each side of our camels, with our baggage, and
the whole caravan in the centre. In this order,
and well prepared for battle, we thought ourselves
a match for the whole ten thousand Mogul Tartars,
if they had appeared; but the next day, when they
did appear, it was quite another thing.

It was early in the morning, when marching from
a little well-situated town, called Changu, we had
a river to pass, where we were obliged to ferry, and
had the Tartars had an intelligence, then had been
the time to have attacked us, when the caravan
being-over, the rear guard was behind; but they did
not appear there.

About three hours after, when we were entered
upon a desert of about fifteen or sixteen miles over:
behold, by a cloud of dust they raised, wesaw an
enemy was at hand: and they were at hand indeed,
for they came on upon the Spur.

The Chinese, our guard on the front, who had
talked so big the day before, began to stagger, and
the soldiers frequently looked behind them, which
is a certain sign in a soldier, that he is just ready
to run away. My old pilot was of my mind, and
being near me, he called out, ' Seignior Inglese;
said he, ' those fellows must be encouraged, or they
will ruin us all 5 for if the Tartars come on, they
will never stand it.' ' I am of your ruind,' said I ;
' but what course must be done?' ' Done!' said
he. ' Let fifty of our men advance, and flank them
on each wing, and encourage them, and they will
fight like brave fellows in brave company; but
without it, they will every man turn his back. Im.
mediately I rode up to our leader. and told him,
who was exactly of our mind ; and accordingly fifty
of us marched to the right wing, and fifty to the
left, and the rest made a line of reserve: and so
we marched, leaving the last two hundred men to
make another body by themselves, and to guard the
camels, only that, if need were, they should send a
hundred men to assist the last fifty.

In a word, the 'l'artars came on, and an innu-
numerable company they were: how many, we could
not tell; but ten thousand we thought was the
least. A party of them came on first, and viewed
001' posture, traversing the ground in the front of
our line ,- and as we found them within gun-shot,
our leader ordered the two wings to advance
swiftly, and give them a salvo on each wing with
their shot, which was done; but they went off. and
I suppose went back to give an account of the
reception they were like to meet with: and in-
deed- that salute clogged their stomachs, for they
immediately halted, stood a while to consider of
it, and, wheeling ofl' to the left, they gave over the
design, and said no more to us for that time,
which was very agreeable to our circumstances
which were but very indifferent for a battle with
such a number. '

Two days after this, we came to the city of
Naunm, or Naum. We thanked the governor for
his care for us, and collected to the value of one
hundred crowns, or thereabouts, which we gave to
the soldiers sent to guard us; and here we rested
one day. This is a garrison indeed, and there
were nine hundred soldiers kept here; but the
reason of it was that formerly the Muscovite
frontiers lay nearer to them than they do now, the
, Muscovites having abandoned that part of the
country (which lies from this city west, for about
two hundred miles) as desolate, and unfit for use:
and more especially, being so very remote, and so
difficult to send troops thither for its defence, for
we had yet above two thousand miles to Muscovy,
properly so called.

After this we passed several great rivers, and
two dreadful deserts, one of which we were sixteen
days passing over, and which, as I said, was to be
called ' No Man's Land ;' and on the thirteenth
of April we came to the frontiers of the Muscovite
dominions. I think the first city, or town, or for.
tress, whatever it might be called, that belonged to
the czar of Muscovy, was called Argun, being on the
west side of the river Argun.

1 could not but discover an infinite satisfaction;
that I was now arrived in, as I called it, a Chris-
tian country, or, at least, in a country governed by
Christians; for though the Muscovites do, in my
opinion, but just deserve the name ot'Christians, yet
such they pretend to be, and are very devout in
their way. It would certainly occur to any mail
who travels the world as I have done, and who
had any power of reflection, I say, it would occur
to him, to reflect what a blessing it is to he brought
into the world where the name of God, and OM
Redeemer, is known, worshipped, and adored; and
not where the pe0ple, given up by Heaven to strong
delusions,-worship the devil, and prostrate them-
selves to stocks and stones, worship monsters, ele-
ments, horrible shaped animals, and statues, 0'
images of monsters. Not a town, or city, We pass-
ed through, but had their pagods, their idols, and
their temples, and ignorant people worshipping even
the works of their own hands.

Now we came where, at least, the face of thc
Christian worship appeared, where the knee was
bowed to Jesus; and, whether ignorgntly or not:
yet the Christian religion was owned, and the name
of the true God was called upon and adored: and
it made the very recesses of my soul rejoice to see
it. I saluted the brave Scots merchant I men-
tioned above, with my first acknowledgment of
this, and, taking him by the hand, I said to him,
'Blessed be God, we are once again come among
Christians!' He smiled, and answered, 'Do not
rejoice too soon, countryman ; these Muscovites are
but an odd sort of Christians, and but for the name
of it, you may see very little of the substance for
some months farther of our journey.'

' Well,' said I, ' but still it is better than pagan-
ism, and worshipping of devils.' ' Why, I'll tell
you,' said he: ' except the Russian soldiers in gar-
risons, and a few of the inhabitants of the cities
Upon the road, all the rest of this country, for
above a thousand miles farther, is inhabited by the
worst and most ignorant of pagans :' and so indeed
we found it.

We were now launched into the greatest piece of
solid earth, if I understand any thing of the surface
of the globe, that is to be found in any part of the
world. We had, at least, twelve hundred miles to
the sea, eastward: we had, at least, two thousand
to the bottom of the Baltic Sea, westward; and
almost three thousand miles, if we left that sea, and
went on west to the British and French Channels ;
We had full five thousand miles to the Indian or
Persian Sea, south ; and about eight hundred miles
to the Frozen Sea, north. Nay, if some people may
be believed, there might be no sea, north-east, till
We came round the pole, and, consequently, into
the north-west, and so had a continent of land into
Annerica, no mortal knows where; though I could
give some reasons why I believe that to be a mis-
take too.

As we entered into the Muscovite dominions, a
good while before we came to any considerable
"W": we had nothing to observe there but this;
'first, that all the rivers run to the east. As I an.
dcrstood by the charts, which some of our caravans
had with them, it was plain that all those rivers ran
into the great river Yamour, or Gammour. This
river, by the natural course of it, must run into
the east sea, or Chinese ocean. The story they tell
us, that the mouth of this river is choahed up with
bulrushes of a monstrous growth, via. three feet
about, and twenty or thirty feet high, I must be al-
lowed to say, I believe nothing of. But as its na-
vigation is of no use, because there is no trade that
way, the Tartars, to whom it alone belongs, dealing
in nothing but cattle, so nobody, that over I heard
of, has been curious enough either to go down to
the mouth of it in boats, or come up from the
mouth of it in ships: but this is certain, that this
river running due east, in the latitude of sixty de-
grees, carries a vast concourse of rivers along with
it, and finds an ocean to empty itself in that lativ
tude: so we are sure of sea there.

Some leagues to the north of this river there are
several considerable rivers, whose streams run as
due north as the Yamour runs east; and these are
all found to join their waters with the great river
Tartarus, named so from the northernmost nations
of the Mogul Tartars, who, the Chinese say, were
the first Tartars in the world, and who, as our geOdeg
graphers allege, are the Gog and Magog mentioned
in sacred story.

These rivers running all northward, as well as all
the other rivers I am yet to speak of, make it eVl'
dent, that the northern ocean bounds the land 3'50
on that side; so that it does not seem rational in'tlle
least to think, that the land can extend itself tojom
with America on that side, or that there is not a
communication between the northern and the eas"
ern ocean; but of this I shall say no more: it W85
my observation at that time, and therefore I take
notice of it in this place.--We new advanced from
the river Arguna, by easy and moderate journeys
and were very visibly obliged to the care the czar of
Muscovy has taken to have cities and towns built
in as many places as it is possible to place them,
where his soldiers keep garrison, something like the
stationary soldiers placed by the Romans in the
remotest countries of their empire, some of which,
I had read, were particularly placed in Britain, for
the security of commerce, and for the lodging of
travellers: and thus it was here: for wherever we
came, though at these towns and stations the gar-
risons and governor were Russians, and professed
Christians, yet the inhabitants of the country were
mere pagans. sacrificing to idols, and worshipping
the sun, moon, and stars, or all the host of heaven;
and not only so, but were, of all the heathens and
pagans that ever I met with, the most barbarous,
except only that they did not eat man's flesh, as our
savages of America did.

Some instances of this we met with in the coun-
try between Arguna, where we enter the Muscovite
dominions, and a city of Tartars and Russians to-
gether, called Nortzinskoy, in which the Space is a
continued desert or forest, which cost us twenty
days to travel over it. In a village, near the last
of those places, I had the curiosity to go and see
their way of living, which is most brutish and un-
sufl'erable. They had, I suppose, a great sacrifice
that day: for there stood out,upon an old stump
of a tree, an idol, made of wood, frightful as the
devil, at least as any thing we can think of to re-
present the devil, can be made: it had a head cer-
tainly not so much as resembling any creature that
the world ever saw; ears as big as goats' horns,
and as high; eyes as big as a crown-piece; a nose
like a crooked ram's horn, and a mouth extended
fourcornered, like that of a lion, with horrible
teeth, hooked like a parrot's under bill. It was
dressed up in the filthiest manner that you can sup-
POse: its upper garment was of sheep skins, with
lJle wool outward; a great Tartar bonnet on the

2 D
head, with two horns growing through it. It was
about eight feet high; yet had no feet, or legs, or
any other proportion of parts.

This scarecrow was set up at the outside of the
village; and when I came near to it, there were six-
teen or seventeen creatures, whether men or women
I could not tell, for they make no distinction by
their habits, either of body or head: these lay all
flat on the ground, round this formidable block of
shapeless wood. I saw no motion among them, any
more than if they had been logs of wood, like their
idol. At firSt, I really thought they had been so;
but when I came a little nearer, they started up
upon their feet, and raised a howling cry, as if it
had been so many deep mouthed hounds, and walk-
ed away as if they were displeased at our disturb-
ing them. A little way off from this monster, and
at the door of a tent, or hut, made all of sheep-
skins and cow-skins dried, stood three butchers.
I thought they were such; fer when I came nearer .
to them, I found they had long knives in their
hands, and in the middle of the tent appeared
three sheep, killed, and one young bullock, or steer.
These, it seems, were sacrifices to that senseless
log of an idol, and these three men priests, belong-
ing to it; and the seventeen prostratcd wretches
were the people who brought the offering, and were
making their prayers to that stock.

I confess I was more moved at their stupidity.
and this brutish' worship of a hobgoblin, than ever
I was at any thing in my life: to see God's most
glorious and best creature, to whom he had granted
so many advantages, even by creation, above the
rest of the works of his hands, vested with a rea-
sonable soul, and that soul adorned with faculties
and capacities adapted both to honour his Maker.
and be honoured by him; I say, to see it sunk
and degenerated to a degree so more than stupid.
as to prostrate itself to a frightful nothing, a mere
imaginary object, dressed up by themselves, and
made terrible to themselves by their own contrivance,
adorned only with clouts and tags, and that this
should be the effect of mere ignorance, wrought up
into hellish devotion by the devil himself, who,
envying to his Maker the homage and adoration
of his creatures, had deluded them into such'gross
surfeiting, sordid, and brutish things, as one would
think should shock nature itself.

But' what signified all the astonishment and re-
flection of thoughts? Thus it was, and I saw it be-
fore my e'yes; and there was no room to wonder
at it, or think it impossible. All my admiration
turned to rage, and I rode up to the image or men-
ster, call it what you will, and, with my sword,
cut the bonnet that was on its head in two, in the
middle, so that it hung down by one of the horns;
and one of our men that was with me took hold of
the sheep-skin that covered it, and pulled at it,
when, behold, a most hideous outcry and howling
ran through the village, and two or three hundred
people came about my ears, so that; 1 was glad to
scour for it, for we saw some had bows and an
rows: but I resolved, from that moment, to visit
them again.

Our caravan rested three nights at the town,
which was about four miles ofi', in order to provide
some horses which they wanted, several of the
horses having been lamed and jaded with the bad.
boss of the way, and our long march over the last
desert; so we had some leisure here to put my de-
Sign in execution. 1 communicated my project to
the Scots merchant of Moscow, of whose courage I
had had sufficient testimony, as above. I told him
what I had seen, and with what indignation 1 had
since thought that human nature could be so dege-
nerate. I told him, I was resolved, if I could but
Set four or five men, well armed, to go with me, to
80 and destroy that vile, abominable idol; to let
them see that it had no power to help itself, and
consequently could not be an object of worship, or
to be prayed to, much less help them that offered
sacrifices to it.

He laughed at me. Said he, ' Your zeal may be
good; but what do you propose to yourself by it?'
' Propose!' said I. ' to vindicate the honour of
God, which is insulted by this devil-worship.' ' But
how will it vindicate the honour of God,' said he,
' while the people will not be able to know what
you mean by it, unless you could speak to them
too, and tell them so? And then they will light
you too, I'll assure you; for they are deSperate fel-
lows, and that especially in defence of their idola-
try.' ' Can we not,' said I, ' do it in the night, and
then leave them the reasons in writing in their
own language? ' ' Writing!' Said he: ' why there
is not in five nations of them, One man that knows
any thing of a letter. or how to read a word in any
language, even in their own.' ' Wretched igno-
rance!' said Ito him. ' However, I have a great
mind to do it: perhaps nature may draw inferences
from it to them, to let them see how brutish they
are to worship such horrid things.' ' Look you,
sir,' said he, ' if your zeal prompts you to it so
warmly, you must do it; but, in the next place, I
would have you consider these wild' nations of
(people are subjected by force to the czar of Mus-
covy's dominions; and if you do this, it is ten to
one but they will come by thousands to the gover-
nor of Nortzinskoy, and complain, and demand sa'
tisfaction, and if he cannot give them satisfaction:
it is ten to one but they will revolt, and it will
occasion a new war with all the Tartars in the
country.'

This, I confess, put new thoughts into my head
fora while; but I harped upon the same string still. '
and all that day I was uneasy to put my projectm
execution. Towards the evening the Scots mer-
chant met me by accident in our walk about the;
town, and desired to Speak with' me. ' I believe:
said he, ' I have put you off of your good deflg":
I have been a little concerned about it since, for I
abhor the idol and idolatry as much as you can
do.' ' Truly,' said I, ' you have put me off a little
as to the execution of it, but you have not put it
all out of my thoughts, and, I believe, I shall do it
still before I quit this place, though I were to be
delivered upto them for satisfaction.' ' No, no,'
said he; ' God forbid they should deliver you up
to such a crew of monsters: they shall not do that
neither; that would be murdering you indeed.'
'Why,' said I, 'how would they use me?' ' Use
you! ' said he. ' I'll tell you how they served a
poor Russian, who affronted them in their worship
just as you did, and whom they took prisoner.
After they had lamed him with an arrow, that he
could not run away, they took him, and stripped
him stark-naked, and set him upon the top of the
idol-monster, and stood all round him, and'shot as
many arrows into him as would stick over his whole
body; and then they burned him, and all the arrows
Sticking in him, as a sacrifice to the idol.' ' And
was this the same idol?' said I. ' Yes,' said he,
' the. very same.' ' Weil,'.said I, ' I'll tell you a
story.' So I related the story of our men at Mada-
gascar, and how they burned and sacked the village
there, and killed man, woman, and child, for their
murdering one of our men, just as it is related be
fore; and when I had done, I added, that I thought
we ought to do so to this village.

He listened very attentively to the story; but
when I talked of doing so to that village, said he,
' You mistake very much ; it was not this village, it
Was almost a hundred miles from this place, but it
Was the same idol, for they carry him about in
Procession all over the country.' ' Well,' said I,
'then that idol ought to be punished for it; and it
shall,' said I, ' if I live this night out.' .

.In a word, finding me resolute, he liked the de-
5'E". and told me I should not go alone, but he
Would go with me: but he would go first, and bring
a stout fellow, one of his countrymen, to go also
with us; ' and one,' said he, ' as famous for his
zeal as you can desire any one to be, against 'such
devilish things as these.' In a word, he brought
me his comrade, a. Scotsman, whom he called cap-
tain Richardson, and I gave him a full account of
what I had seen, and also of what I intended; and
he told me readily he would go with me, if it cost
him his life. So we agreed to go, only we three. I
had indeed proposed it to my partner, but he de-
clined it. lie said he was ready to assist me to the
utmost, and upon all occasions, for my defence; but
that this was an adventure quite out of his way: so:
I say, we resolved upon our work, only we three,
and my man-servant, and to put it in execution
that night about midnight, with all the secrecy ima'
ginable.

However, upon second thoughts, we were willing
to delay it till the next night, because, the caravan
being to set forward in the morning. we supposed
the governor could not pretend to give them any
satisfaction upon us when we. were out of his power-
The Scots merchant, as steady in his,rcsolution for
an enterprise as bold in executing it, brought me 9-
'.l'artar's robe, or gown of shecposkius, and a bon-
net, with a bow and arrows, and had provided the
same for himself and his countryman, that the peo-
ple, if they saw us, should not be able to determine
who we were.

All the first night we spent in mixing up some
combustible matter with aquavitm, gunpowder, and
such other materials as we could get; and, hav-
ing a good quantity of tar in a little pot. 8b":
an hour after night, we set out upon our expe'
dition.

We came to the place about eleven o'clock at
night, and found that the people had not the least
jealousy of danger attending their idol. The night
was cloudy, yet the moon gave us light enough to
see that the idol stood just in the same posture
and place that it did before. The people seemed
to be all at their rest. only that in the great hut, or
tent, as we called it, where we saw the three
priests, whom we mistook for butchers, we saw a
light; and, going up close to the door, we heard
people talking, as if there were five or six of them.
We concluded, therefore, that if we set wildfire to
the idol, these men would come out immediately,
and run up to the place to rescue it from the de-
struction that we intended for it: and what to do
with them we knew not ; once we thought of car-
rying it away, and setting fire to it at a distance;
but when we came to handle it, we found it too
bulky for our carriage, so we were at a loss
"gain. The second Scotsman was for setting fire to
the lent, or hut, and knocking the creatures that
were there on the head when they came out: but
I could not join with that; I was against killing
them, if it was possible to be avoided. ' Well,
then,' said the Scots merchant, ' I'll tell you what
we will do: we will try to take them prisoners,
tie their hands, and make them stand still and see
their idol dcstroyed-'

As it happened, we had twine or packthread
enough about us, which was used to tie our lire-
works together with: so we resolved to attack
these people first, and with as little noise as we
Could. The first thing we did, we knocked at the
door; when one of the priests coming to the door,
we immediately seized upon him, stopped his mouth,
and tied his hands behind him, and led him to the
Idol, where we gagged him, that he might not make
a noise: we tied his feet'also together, and left him
on the ground. '

Two of us then waited at the door, expecting
that another would come out to see what the mat-
ter was; but we Waited so long till the third man
Came back to us; and then, nobody coming out, we
kflocked again gently, and immediately out came
tWO more, and we served them just in the same
manner, but were obliged to go all with them, and
lay them down by the idol some distance from one
another; when, going back, we found two more were
come out to the door, and a third stood behind
them within the door. We seized the two, and im-
mediately tied them; when the third stepping back,
and crying out, my Scots merchant went in after
him, and taking out a composition we had made,
that would only smoke and stink, he set fire to it,
and threw it in among them. By that time'the
other Scotsman, and my man, taking charge of the
two men already bound, and tied together also by
the arm, led them away to the idol, and left them
there, to see if their idol would relieve them, mak.
ing haste back to us.

When the fuze we had thrown in had filled the
hut with so much smoke that they were almost suf-
focated, we then threw in a small leather bag of
another kind, which flamed like a candle, and,'fol-
lowing it in, we found there were but four people
left, who, it seems, were two men and two wo.
men, and, as we supposed, had been about some of
their diabolic sacrifices. They appeared, in short.
frighted to death, at least so as to sit trembling
and stupid, and not able to speak neither, for the
smoke.

In a word, we took them, bound them as we had
the others, and all without any noise. I should
have said, we brought them out of the house, 0|"
hut, first; for indeed we were not able to bear the
smoke, any more than they were. When we had
done this, we carried them all together to the idol.
When we came there, we fell to work with him;
and, first, we daubed him all over, and his robes
also, with tar, and such other stufl" as we had,
which was tallow mixed with brimstone; then We
stopped his eyes, and ears, and mouth, full of gun:
powder; then we wrapped up a great piece 0t
wildfire in his bonnet; and then, sticking all the
combustibles we had brought with .us upon him.
we looked about to see if we could find any thing
else to help to burn him, when my man remem.
bered that by the tent, or but, where the men
were, there lay a heap of dry forage, whether straw
or rushes I do not remember: away he and one
of the ScOtsmen ran, and fetched their arms full of
that. When we had done this, we took all our
prisoners, and brought them, having untied their
feet, and nngagged their mouths, and made them
stand up, and set them just before their monstrous
idol, and then set fire to the whole.

We staid by it a quarter of an hour, or thereabouts,
till the powder in the eyes, and mouth, and ears of
the idol blew up, and as we could perceive, had
split and deformed the shape of it: and, in a word,
till we saw it burn into arnere block or log of wood;
and then setting the dry forage to it, we found it
would be soon quite consumed, so we began to
think of going away: but the Scotsman said, ' No,
we must not go ; for these poor, deluded wretches
will all throw themsellves into the fire, and burn
themselves with the idoi.' So we resolved to stay
' till the forage was burned down too, and then we
came away, and left them.

In the morning we appeared among our fellow-
travellers, exceeding busy in getting ready for our
journey: nor could any man suggest that we had
been any where but in our beds, as travellers might
be supposed to be, to [it themselves for the fatigues
of that day'sjourney.

But it did not end so; for the next day came a
Err-at multitude of the country people, not only of
this village, but of a hundred more, for aught I
know, to the town gates, and, in a most outrageous
Ibanner, demanded satisfaction of the Russian go-
vernor, for the insulting their priests, and burning
their great Cham-Chi--'.l'haungu, such a hard'name
they gave the monstrous creature they worship-
l'degd~ The people of Nortzinskoy were at first in
a great consternation; for they said the Tartar-.5

2 D '3
were no less than thirty thousand, and that, in a few
days more, they would be one hundred thousand
strong. '

The Russian governor sent out messengers to
appease them, and gave them all the good words
imaginable. He assured them he knew nothing of
it, and that there had not a soul of his garrison
been abroad; that it could not be from any body
there; and if they would let him know who it was,
they should be exemplarily punished. They re-
turned, haughtily, that all the country reverenced
the great Cham-Chi-Thaungu, who dwelt in the
sun, and no mortal would have dared to oil'er
violence to his image, but some Christian mis-
creants, so they called them, it seems; and they
therefore denounced war against him and all the
Russians, who, they Said, were miscreants and
Christians.

The governor, still patient, and unwilling to make
a breach, or to have any cause of war alleged to
be given by him, the czar having strictly charged
him to treat the conquered country with gentle-
ness and civility, gave them still all the good words
he could: at last, he told them, there was a caravan
gone towards Russia that morning, and, perhaps, it
was some of them who had done them this injury;
and that, if they would be satisfied with that, he
would send after them, to inquire into it. This
seemed to appease them a little,and accordingly the
governor sent after us, and gave us a particular
account how the thing was, intimating withal, that
if any in our caravan had done it, they should
make their escape; but that, whether they had
done it or no, we should make all the haste for-
ward that was possible; and that, in the mean
time, he would keep them in play as long as he
could.

This was very friendly in the governor. HOW-
ever, when it came to the caravan, there was nobody
knew any thing of the matter; and, as for us that
were guilty, we were the least of all suspected:
none so much as asked us the question. However,
the captain of the caravan for the time, took the
hint that the governor gave us, and we marched, or
travelled two days and two nights, without any
considerable stop, and then we lay at a village
called Plothus; nor did we make any long st0p
here, but hastened on towards Jarawena, another
of the czar of Muscovy's colonies, and where we
expected we should be safe. But it is to be ob-
served that here we began, for two or three days'
march, to enter upon a vast, nameless desert, of
which I shall say more in its place, and which if
we had now been upon, it is more than probable
we had been all destrOyed. It was the second day's
march from Plothus, that, by the clouds of dust
behind us, at a great distance, some of our peeple
began to be sensible we were pursued. We had en-
tered the desert, and had passed by a great lake,
called Schaks Oser, when we perceived a very great
body of horse appear on the other side of the lake
to the north, we travelling west. We observed
they WEI": away west as we did, but had supposed
we would have taken that side of the lake, whereas
we very happily took the south side; and, in two
days more, we saw them not, for they, believing we.
were still before them, pushed on, till they came to
the river Udda: this is a very great river when it
passes farther north; but where we came to it, we
found it narrow and fordable.

The third day they either found their mistake or
had intelligence of us, and came pouring in upon
us, towards the. dusk of the evening. We had, to
our great satisfaction, just pitched upon a place for
our camp, which was very convenient for the night;
for as we were upon a desert, though but at the
beginning of it, that was above live hundred miles
War, we had no towns to lodge at, and indeed ex-
pected none but the city of Jarawena, which we
had yet two days' march to._ The desert, how-

I
ever, had some few woods in it on this side, and
little rivers, which ran all into the great river
Udda. It was in a narrow strait, between two small
but very thick woods, that we pitched our little.
camp for that night, expecting to be attacked in
the night. '

Nobody knew but ourselves, what we were pur-
sued for; but as it was usual for the Mogul Tartars
to go about in tr00ps in that desert, so the caravans
always fortify themselves every night against them,
as against armies of robbers; and it was therefore
no new thing to be pursued.

But we had this night, of all the nights of our
travels, a most advantageous camp; for we lay be-
tween two woods, with a little rivulet running
just before our front; so that we could not be
surrounded, or attacked any way but in our front
or rear. We took care also to make our front as
strong as we could, by placing our packs, with
our camels and horses, all in a line on the inside
of the river; and we felled some trees in our rear.

In this posture, we encamped for the night; but
the enemy was upon us, before we had finished our
situation. They did not come on us like thieves,
as we expected; but sent three messengers to us,
to demand the men to be delivered to them that
had abused their priests, and burned their god
Cham-ChLThaungu, that they might burn them
with fires and upon this, they said, they would go
away, and do us no further harm, otherwise they
would burn us all with fire. Our men looked very
blank at this message, and began to stare at one
another, to see who looked with most guilt in their
faces; but, ' nobody' was the word, nobody did it-

,The leader of the caravan sent word, he was well
assured it was not done by any of our camp; that
we were peaceable merchants, travelling on our
business; that we had done no harm to them, or
to any one else; and that therefore they must look
further for their enemies who had injured them:
for we were not the people; so desired them not
to disturb us, for if they did we should defend our-
selves.

They were far from being satisfied with this for
an answer, and a great crowd of them came down
in the morning, by break of day, to our camp; but
seeing us in such an advantageous situation, they
durst come no farther than the brook in our front,
where they stood, and showed us such a number as
indeed terrified us very much: for those that spoke
least of them spoke of ten thousand. Here they
stood, and looked at us a while, and then set-
ting up a great howl, they let fly a cloud of ar-
rows among us: but we were well enough fortified
for that, for we sheltered under our baggage;
and I do not remember that one man of us was
hurt.

Some time after this, we saw them move a little
to our right, and expected them on the rear; when
a cunning fellow, a Cossack, as they call them, of
Jarawena, in the pay of the Muscovites, calling to
the leader of the caravan, said to him. ' I'll go send
all these people away to Sibeilka.' This was a city
four or five days' journey, at least, to the south.
and rather behind us. So he takes his bow and ar-
rows, and getting on horseback, he rides away from
Our rear directly, as it were, back to Nortinskoy:
after this, he takes a great circuit about, and comes
to the army of the 'l'artars, as if he had been sent
express to tell them a long story, that the people
who had burned their Cham-Chi-Thaungu were gone
to Sibeilka, with a caravan of miscreants, as he call-
ed them, that is to say, Christians; and that they
were resolved to burn the god Schal-Isar, belonging
to the Tongueses.

As this fellow was a mere Tartar, and perfectly
Spoke their language, he counterfeitcd so well, that
they all took it from him, and away they drove
in a most violent hurry, to Sibeilka, which, it seems,
Was almost five days' journey to the south, and in
less than three hours they were entirely out of our
sight, and we never heard any more of them, nor
ever knew whether they went to that other place
called Sibeilka, or no.

So we passed safely on to the city of Jerawcua,
where there was a garrison of Muscovites; and
there we rested five days, the caravan being exceed.
ingly fatigued with the last day's march, and with
Want of rest in the night.

From this city we had a frightful desert, which
held us three-and-twenty days' march. We fur-
nished ourselves with some tents here, for the bet.
ter accommodating ourselves in the night; and the
leader of the caravan procured sixteen carriages,
or waggons, of the country, for carrying our water
and provisions; and these carriages were our de-

fence every night round our little camp: so that had'

the Tartars appeared, unless they had been very
numerous indeed, they would not have been able
to hurt us.

We may well be supposed to want rest again
after this long journey; for in this desert we saw
neither house nor tree, nor scarce a bush. We saw
indeed abundance of the sable hunters, as they
called them; these are all Tartars, of the Mogul
Tartary, of which this country is a part, and they
frequently attack small caravans; but we saw no
numbers of them together. 1 was curious to see
the sable skins they catched, but I could never
speak with them, for they durst not come near us,
neither durst we Straggle from our company to go
near them. .

After we had passed this desert, we'came into a
country pretty well inhabited; that is to say, we
found towns and castles settled by the czar of him-
covy, with garrisons of stationary soldiers to pro-
tect the caravans, and defend the country against
the Tartars, who would otherwise make it very
dangerous travelling; and his czarish majesty has
given such strict orders for the well guarding the
caravans and merchants, that if there are any Tar-
tars heard of in the country, detachments of the
garrison are always sent to see travellers safe from
station to station. '

And thus the governor of Adinskoy, whom I had
opportunity to make a visit to, by means of the
Scots merchant, who was acquainted with him, of-
fered us a guard of fifty men, if we thought there
was any danger, to the next station.

I thought, long before this, that as we came nearer
to Europe, we should find the country better peo-
plcd, and the people more civilized: but I found
myself mistaken in both; for we had yet the nation
of the Tongueses to pass through, where we saw
the same tokens of paganism and barbarity, or
worse than before; only as they were conquered
by the Muscovites, and entirely reduced, they were
not so dangerous: but for rudeness of manners,
idolatry, and polytheism, no peOpIe in the world
ever went beyond them. They are clothed all in
skins of beasts, and their houses are built of the
same. You know not aman from a woman, neither
by the ruggedness of their countenanccs, nor their
clothes; and in winter, when the ground is covered
With snow, they live under ground, in houses like
vaults, which have cavities, or caves, going from
one to another.

If the Tartars had their Cham-Chi-Thaungu for
a whole village or country, these had idols in
every but and every cave: besides, they worship
the stars, the sun, the water, the snow, and, in
a word, every thing that they do not understand,
and they understand but very little; so that almost
every element, every uncommon thing, sets them a
sacrificing. -

But I am no more to describe people than coun-
tries, any farther than my own story comes to be
concerned in them. I met with nothing peculiar to
myself in all this, country, which, I reckon, was
from the desert which I spoke of last, at least four
hundred miles, half of it being another desert,
which took us up twelve days' severe travelling,
without house, tree, or bush ; but we were obliged
again to carry our own provisions, as well water as
bread. After we were out of this desert, and had
travelled two days, we came to Janezay, a Mus-
covite city or station, on the great river Janezay.
This river, they told us, parted Europe from Asia,
though our map-makers as I am told, do not
agree to it. However, it is certainly the eastern
boundary of the ancient Siberia, which now makes
a province only of the vast Muscovite empire, but
is itself equal in bigness to the whole empire of
Germany.

And yet here I observed ignorance and paganism
still prevailed, except in the Muscovite garrisous:
all the country between the river Oby and the river
Janezay, is as entirely pagan, and the people as
barbarous, as the remotest of the 'I'artars ; nay, as
any nation, for anght I know, in Asia or America.
I also found, which I observed to the Muscovite go'
vernors whom I had opportunity to converse with.
that the pagans are not much the wiser, or the
nearer Christianity, for being under the Muscovite
government; which they acknowledged was true
enough: but they said it was none of their busi-
ness; that if the czar expected to convert his Sibe-
rian, or Tonguese, or Tartar subjects, it should be
done by sending clergymen among them, not sol-
diers; and they added, with more sincerity than I
expected, that they found it was not so much the
concern of their monarch to make the [maple Chris-
tians, as it was to make them subjects.

From this river to the great river Oby, we crossed
a wild, uncultivated country: I cannot say, it is
a barren soil; it is only barren of people, and
good management; otherwise it is in itsclt'a most
pleasant, fruitful, and agreeable country. What in-
habitants we found in it are all pagans, except
such as are sent among them from Russia; for
this is thecountry, I mean on both sides the river
Oby, whither the Muscovite criminals that are
not. put to death are banished, and from whence
it is next'to impossible they should ever come
away.

I have nothing material to say of my particular
afl'airs, till I came to Tobolski, the capital city of
Siberia, where I continued some time, on the fol-
lowing occasion.

We had been now almost seven months on our
journey, and winter began to come on apace;
whereupon my partner and I called a council about
Our particular affairs, in which we found it proper,
considering that we were bound for England, and
not for Moscow, to consider how to dispose of
ourselves. They told us of sledges and rein-deer
to carry us over the snow in the winter time;
and indeed they have such things as it would be
incredible to relate the particulars of, by which
means the Russians travel more in the winter than
they can in summer; because in these sleds they
are able to run night and day; the snpw, being
frozen, is one universal covering to nature, by
which the hills and vales, the rivers, the lakes, are
all smooth, and hard as a stone; and they run
upon the surface, without any regard to what is
underneath.

But I had no occasion to push at a winter jour-
ney of this kind; I was bound to England, not to
Moscow, and my route lay two ways: either I must
go on as the caravan went, till I came to Jeroslow,
and then go off west for Narva, and the gulf of
Finland, and so either by sea or land to Dantzic,
where I might possibly sell my China cargo to good
advantage; or I must leave the caravan at a little
town on the Dwina, from whence I had but. six
days, by water, to Archangel, and from thence
might be sure of shipping, either to England, Hol-
land, or Hamburgh.

Now to go any of these journeys in the winter
would have been preposterous; for, as to Dantzic,
the Baltic would be frozen up, and I could not get
passage, and to go up by land in those countries,
was far less safe than among the Mogul Tartars:
likewise to go to Archangel in October, all the ships
would be gone from thence, and even the men
chants, who dwell there in summer, retire south to
Moscow in the winter, when the ships are gone;
so that I should have nothing but extremity of cold
to encounter with a. scarcity of provisions, and
must lie there in an empty town all the winter.
So that, upon the whole, I thought it much my
better way to let the caravan go, and to make pro-
vision to winter where I was, viz. at Tobolski, in Si-
beria, in the latitude of sixty degrees, where I was
sure of three things to wear out a cold winter
with, viz. plenty of provision, such as the country
afforded, a warm house, with fuel enough, and ex-
cellent company: of all which I shall give a full
account in its place.

I was now in a quite different climate From my
beloved island, where [never felt cold except when
I had my agne; on the contrary, i had much to do
to bear. any clothes on my back, and never made
any fire but without doors, and for my necessity:
in dressing my food, &c. Now I made me three
good vests, with large robes or gowns over them, to
hang down to the feet, and button close to the
wrists, and all these lined with furs, to make them
sufficient! y warm.

As to a warm house, I must confess, I greatly
dislike our way in England, of making fires in
every room in the house, in open chimneys, which;
when the fire was out, alw;nys kept the air in the
room cold as the climate. But taking an apart-
ment in a good house in the town, I ordered a.
chimney to be built like a furnace, in the centre of
six several rooms, like a stove, the funnel to carri'
the smoke went up one way, the door to come at
the lire went in another, and all the rooms were
kept equally warm, but no fire seen; just as they
heat the bagnios in England.

By this means we had always the same climate in
all the rooms, and an equal heat was preserved;
and how cold soever it was without, it was always
warm within: and yet we saw no fire, nor were
ever incommoded with any smoke.

The most wonderful thing of all was, that it
should be possible to meet with good company here,
in a country so barbarous as that of the most north-
erly parts of Europe, near the frozen ocean. and
within but a very few degrees of Nova Zembla.

But this being the country where the state cri-
minals of Muscovy, as I observed before, are all
banished; this city was full ofnoblemen, princes,
gentlemen, colouels, and. in short, all degrees of
the nobility, gentry, soldiery, and courtiers of Mus-
covy. Here were the famous prince Galiloi'kcn,
0r Galoliken, and his son. the old general Robe-
stisky, and several other persons of note, and some
ladies. .

By means of my Scots merchant, whom, neverthce
[955, I parted with here, I made an acquaintance
With several of these gentlemen, and some of them
Of the first rank; and from these, in the long win-
ter nights in which I staid here, I received several
agl'eeable visits. It was talking one night with a
certain prince, one ofthe banished ministers of
State belonging to the czar of Muscovy, that my
talk of my particular case began. He had been
~tc|ling me abundance of line things, of the great-
ness, the magnificence, the dominions, and the ab-
_50|_ute power of the emperor of the Russians. I
Interrupted him, and told him, I was a greater and
more powerful prince than ever the czar of Mn:-
degdeg".Y was, though my dominions were not so large,
nor my people so many. The Russian grandee
kicked a little surprised; and, fixing his eyes stea-
(hly upon me, began to wonder what I meant.

I told him his wonder would cease when I had
explained myself. First, I told him I had the abso-
lute disposal of the lives and fortunes of all my
subjects: that notwithstanding my absolute power,
I had not one person disaffected to my government,
or to 'my person, in all my dominions. He shook
his head at that, and said, there indeed I outdid the
czar of Muscovy. I told him, that all the lands in
my kingdom were my own, and all my subjects
were not only my tenants, but tenants at will; that
they would all fight for me to the last drop; and
that never tyrant, for such I acknowledged myself
to be, was ever so universally beloved, and yet so
horribly feared by his subjects.

After amusing them with these riddles in govern-
ment for a while, I opened the case, and told them
the story at large of my living in the island, and
how I managed both myself and the peeple there
that were under me, just as I have since minuted it
down. They were exceedingly taken with the
story, and especially the prince, who told me with
a sigh, that the true greatness of life was to be mas-
ter of ourselves; that he would not have exchanged
such a state of life as mine, to have been czar 0f
Muscovy, and that he found more felicity in the re.
tirement he seemed to be banished to there, than
ever he found in the highest authority he enjoyed
in the court of his master the czar; that the height
of human wisdom was to bring our tempers down to
our circumstances, and to make a calm within,
under the weight of the greatest storm without.
When he came first hither, he said, he used to tear
the hair from his head, and the clothes from his
back, as others had done before him; but a little
time and consideration had made him look into him-
self, as well as round himself to things without:
that he found the mind of man, if it was but once
brought to reflect upon the state of universal life.
and how little this world was concerned in its true
felicity, was perfectly capable of making a felicity
for itself, fully satisfying to itself, and suitable to
its own best ends and desires, with but very little
assistance from the world: that air to breathe in',
food to sustain life, clothes for warmth, and liberty
for exercise in order to health, completed, in his
opinion, all that the world could do for us; and
though the greatness, the authority, the riches, and
the pleasures which some enjoyed in the world, and
which he had enjoyed his share of. had much in
them that was agreeable to us, yet he observed that
all those things chiefly gratified the coarsest of our
affections, such as our ambition, our particular
pride, our avarice, our vanity, and our sensuality;
all which were indeed the mere product of the
worst part of man, were in themselves crimes, and
had in them the seeds ofall manner of crimes; but
neither were related to, nor concerned with, any of
those virtues that constituted us wise men, or of
those graces which distinguished us as Christians:
that being new deprived of all the fancied felicity
which he enjoyed in the full exercise of all those
vices, he said, he was at leisure to look upon the
dark side of them, where he found all manner of
deformity, and was now convinced that virtue only
makes a man truly wise, rich, and great, and pre-
serves him in the way to a superior happiness in a
future state; and in this, he said, they were more
happy in their banishment, than all their enemies
were, who had the full possession of all the wealth
and power that they (the banished) had left behind
them. '

' Nor, sir,' said he, ' do I bring my mind to this
politically, by the necessity of my circumstances,
which some call miserable; but, if I know any
thing of myself, I would not now go back, no, not
though my master, the czar, should call me, and
offer to reinstate me in all my former grandeur;
I say, I would no more go back to it, than I be-
lieve my soul, when it shall be delivered from this
prison of the body, and has had a taste of the glo-
nous state beyond life, would come back to the
gaol of flesh and blood it is now enclosed in, and
leave heaven to deal in the dirt and grime of hu-
man affairs.'

He spoke this with so much warmth in his tem-
per, so much earnestness and motion of his Spirits,
which were apparent in his countenance, that it was
evident it was the true sense of his soul; and in
deed there was no room to doubt his sincerity.

I told him, I once thought myself a kind of a
monarch in my old station, of which I had given
him an account, but that I thought he was not a
monarch only, but a great conqueror; for that he
that has got a victory over his own exorbitant de-
sires, and has the absolute dominion over himself,
and whose reason entirely governs his will, is cer-
tainly greater than he that conquers a city. ' But,
my lord,' said I, ' shall I take the liberty to asl:
you a question?' ' With all my heart,' said he. ' 1f
the door of your liberty was opened,' said I, ' would
not you take hold of it to deliver yourself from this
exile ?'

' IIold,' said he; ' your question is subtle, and w I
"quires some serious just distinctions, to give it a
sincere answer; and 1'" give it you from the bot-
tom of my heart. Nothing that I know of in this
world would move me to deliver myself from this
state of banishment, except these two; first, the en-
joyment of my relations, and, secondly, a little
warmer climate. But I protest to you, that to go
back to the pomp of the court, the glory, the power,
the hurry of a minister of state; the wealth, the
gaiety, and the pleasures, that is to say, follies of a
courtier; if my master should send me word this
moment, that he restores me to all he banished me
from; I pretest, if I know myself at all, I would DOt
leave this wilderness, these deserts, and these frozen
lakes, for the palace of Moscow.'

' But, my lord,' said I, ' perhaps you not only are
banished from the pleasures of the court, and from
the power, and authority, and wealth, you enjoyed
before; but you may be absent too from some of
the conveniences of life, your estate, perhaps, con-
fiscated, and your efl'ects plundered; and the sup-
plies left you here may not be suitable to the ordi-
nary demands of life.'

' Aye,' said he, ' that is as you suppose me to be
:1 lord, or a prince, &c.; so indeed I am; but you
are now to consider me only as a man, a human
creature, not at all distinguished from another; and
so I can suffer no want, unless I should be visited
with sickness and distempers. However, to put the
question out of dispute, you see our manner: we
are in this place five persons of rank; we live per-
fectly retired, as suited to a state of banishment.
We have something rescued from the shipwreck of
our fortunes, which keeps us from the mere neces-
sity of hunting for our food; but the poor soldiers
who are here, without that help, live in as much
plenty as we. They go into the woods, and catch
sablcs and foxes: the labour of a month will main-
tain them a year; and as the way of living is not
expensive, so it is not hard to get sufficient for our-
selves: so that objection is out of doors.'

I have not room to give a full account of the most
agreeable conversation I had with this truly great
man; in all which he showed that his mind was so
inspired with a superior knowledge of things, so
supported by religion, as well as by a vast share of
Wisdom, that his contempt of the world was really
as much as he had expressed, and that he was al~
ways the same to the last, as will appear in the
Story 1 am going to tell.

I had been here eight months, and a dark, dread-
ful winter I thought it to be; the cold was so in-
tense, that I could not. so much as look abroad,
without being wrapped in furs, and a mask of fur
before my face, or rather a hood, with only a hole
for breath, and two for sight. The little daylight
We had, Was, as we reckoned, for three months,
not above five hours a day, and six at most, only
that the snow lying on the ground continually, and
the weather clear, it was never quite dark. Our
horses were kept (or rather starved) under ground;
and, as for our servants (for we hired servants here
to look after our horses and ourselves), we had
every now and then their fingers and tees to thaw
and take care of, lest they should mortify and
fall off. .

It is true, within doors we were warm, the houses
being close, the walls thick, the lights small, and
the glass all double. Our food was chiefly the flesh
of deer, dried and cured in the season ; good
bread enough, but baked as biscuits; dried fish, of
several sorts, and some flesh of mutton, and of the
buffaloes, which is pretty good beef. All the stores
of provision for the winter are laid up in the sum-
mer, and well cured. Our drink was water, mixed
with aquavitze, instead of brandy; and, for a treat,
mead, instead of wine, which, however, they have
excellent good. The hunters, who venture abroad
all weathers, frequently brought us in fresh veni-
son, very fat and good ; and sometimes bears' flesh,
but we did not much care for the last. We had a
good stock of tea, with which we treated our friends
as above; and, in a word, we lived very cheerfully
and well, all things considered.

It was now March, and the days grown considera-
bly longer, and the weather at least tolerable; so ,
the other travellers began to prepare sleds to carry
them over the snow, and to get things ready to be
going; but my measures being fixed, as I have said,
for Archangel, and not for Muscovy or the Baltic, I
made no motion, knowing very well, that the ships
frOm the south do not set out for that part of the
world till May or June; and that if I was there by
the beginning of August, it would be as soon as
any ships would be ready to go away; and there-
fore, I say, I made no haste to be gone, as others
did: in a word, I saw a great many people, nay: "'1
the travellers, go away before me. It seems, ever?
year they go from thence t- Moscow for trade, viz.
to carry furs, and buy necessaries with them, which
they bring back to furnish their shops; also others
went on the same errand to Archangel, but then
they also, being to come back again above eight
hundred miles, went all out before me.

In short, about the latter end of May,.I began
to make all ready to pack up; and as I was doing '
this, it occurred to me, that seeing all these peeple
were banished by the czar of Mnscovy to Siberia,
and yet, when they came there, were left at liberty
to go whither they would, why did they not then
go away to any part of the world, wherever they -
thought fit: and I began to examine what should
hinder them from making such an attempt.

But my wonder was over, when I entered upon
that subject with the person I have mentioned, who
answered me thus: ' Consider, first, sir,' said he,
'the place where we are; and, secondly, the cou-
ditiou we are in, especially,' said he, 'the gene-
rality of the people who are banished hither. We
are surrounded,' said he, ' with stronger things than
bars and bolts: on the north side is an unnavigable
ocean, where ship never sailed, and boat never
swam; neither, if we had both, could we know
whither to go with them. Every other way,' said
he, ' we have above one thousand miles to pass
through the czar's own dominions, and by ways
utterly unpassable', except by the roads made by the
government, and through the towns garrisoned by
its troops; so that we could neither pass undisco-
vered by the road, nor subsist any other way, so
that it is in vain to attempt it.'

I was silenced indeed at once, and found that
they were in a prison, every jot as secure as if they
had been locked up in the castle of Moscow. How-
ever, it came into my thoughts, that I might cer.
tainly be made an instrument to procure the es-
cape of this excellent person, and that it was very

"33' for me to carry him away, there being no
2 E
guard over him in the country; and, as I was not
going to Moscow, but to Archangel, and that I went
in the nature of a caravan, by which I was not
obliged to lie in the stationary towns in the desert,
but could encamp every night where I Would,
we might easily pass uninterrupted to Archangel,
where I would immediately secure him on board an
English or Dutch ship, and carry him off safe along
with me; and, as to his subsistence, and other par-
ticulars, that should be my care, till he could better
supply himself.

He heana. me very attentively, and looked. ear-
nestly on me all the while I spoke; nay, I could
see in his very face, that what] said put: his spirits
into an exceeding ferment: his colour frequently
changed, his eyes looked red, and his heart flut-
tered, that it might be even perceived in his coun-
tenance; nor could he immediately ansWer me,
when I had done, and, as it were, expected what he
would say to it, and after he had paused a little, he
embraced me, and said, ' How unhappy are we, un-
guided creatures as we are, that even our greatest
acts of friendship are made snares to us, and we are
made the tempters of <<one another! My dear
friend,' said he, ' your offer is so sincere, has such
kindness in it, is so disinterested in itself, and is
so calculated for my advantage, that I must have
very little knowledge of the world, if I did not
both wonder at it, and acknowledge the obligation
I have upon me to you for it. But did you be-
lieve I was sincere in what I have so often said to
you of my contempt of the world? Did you be-
lieve I spoke my very soul to you, and that I had
really attained that degree of felicity here, that had
placed me above all that the world could give
me, or do for me? Did you believe I was sincere,
when I told you I would not go back, if I was re-
called even to be all that once I was in the court;
and with the favour of the czar my master? Did

you believe me, my friend, to be an honest mam 0'
did you think me to be. a boasting hypocrite 2' Here
he stopped, as iflie would hear what I would say;
but indeed I soon after perceived that he stopped
because his spirits were in motion, his heart was
full of struggles, and he could not go on. I was,
I confess, astonished at the thing, as well as at
the man, and I used some arguments with him to
urge him to set himself free; that he ought to look
upon this as a door opened by Heaven for his de-
liverance, and a summons by Providence, who has
the care and good disposition of all events, to do
himself good, and to render himself .sful in the
world.

He had by this time recovered himself. ' How
do you know, sir,' said he, warmly, ' but that in-
stead of a summons from Heaven, it may be a feint
of another instrument, representing, in all the al-
luring colours to me, the show of felicity as a deli.
verance, which may in itself be my snare, and tend
directly to my ruin? Here I am, free from the
temptation of returning to my former miserable
greatness; there I am not sure but that all the
seeds of pride, ambition, avarice, and luxury, which
I know remain in nature, may revive and take root,
and, in a word, again overwhelm the, and then the
happy prisoner, whom you see new master of his
soul's liberty, shall be the miserable slave of his
own senses, in the full of all personal liberty. Dear
sir, let me remain in this blessed confinement, ba-
nished from the crimes of life, rather than purchase
a' show of freedom at the expense of the liberty of
my reason, and at the expense of the future hap--
piness which I now have in my 'view, but shall
then, I fear, quickly lose sight of; for I am but
flesh, a man, a mere mam-have passions and afi'ec-
tions as likely to possess and overthrow me as any
man. 0 be not my friend and my tempter both
together! '

If I was surprised before, I was quite dumb now,
and stood silent, looking at him, and indeed ad-

2 E 2
mired at what I saw: the struggle in his soul was
so great, that, though the weather was extremely
cold, itput him into a. most violent sweat, and I
found he wanted to give vent to his mind; so I said
a word or two, that I would leave him to consider

of it, and wait on him again, and then I withdrew

to my own apartment.

About two hours after, I heard somebody at, or
near, the door of my room, and I was going to
Open the door; but he had opened it and' came in.
' My dear friend,' said he, ' you had almost overset
me, but I am recovered. Do not take it ill that I
do not close with your offer. I assure you, it is
not for want of a sense of the kindness of it in you,
and I came tomake the most sincere acknowledge-
ment of it to you; but, I hope, I have got the vic-
tory over myself.'

' My lord,' said I, ' I hape you are fully satisfied
that you do not resist the call of Heaven.' ' Sir,'
said he, ' if it had been from Heaven, the same
power would have influenced me to accept it ; but,
I hope, and am fully satisfied that it is from Heaven
that I decline it, and I have an infinite satisfaction
in the parting, that you shall leave me an honest
man still, though not a free man.'

I had nothing to do'but to acquiesce, and make
professions to him of my having no end in it, but a
sincere desire to serve him. He embraced me very
passionately, and assured me he was sensible of
that, and should always acknowledge it; and with
that he offered me a very fine present of sables, too
much indeed for me to accept from a man in his
circumstances; and I would have avoided them,
but he would not be refused.

The next morning I sent my servant to his lord'
ship, with a small present of tea, two pieces of
China damask, and four little wedges of Japan
gold, which did not all weigh above six ounces, of
thereabout ; but were far short of the value of his
sables, which indeed, when I came to England, I
found worth near two hundred pounds. He accept,
ed the tea, and one piece of the damask, and one of
the pieces of gold, which had a fine stamp upon it,
of the Japan coinage, which I found he took for the
rarity of it, but would not take any more; and he
sent word, by my servant, that he desired to speak
with me.

When I came to him, he told me I knew what
had passed between us, and hoped I would not
move him any more in that affair; but that since I
had made such a generous offer to him, he asked
me, if I had kindness enough to offer the same to
another person that he would name to me, in whom
he had a great share of concern. I told him, that
I could not say I inclined to do so much for any
one but himself, for whom I had a particular value,
and should have been glad to have been the instru-
ment of his deliverance. However, if he would
please to name the person to me, I would give him
my answer, and hoped he would not be displeased
with me, if he was with my answer. He told me,
it was only his son, who, though I had not seen
him, yet was in the same condition with himself,
and above two hundred miles from him, on the
other side the Oby ; but that, if I consented, he
would send for him.

I made no hesitation, but told him I would do it.
I made some ceremony in letting him understand,
that it was wholly on his account; and that seeing
I could not prevail on him, I would show my re-
spect to him by my concern for his son: but these
things are too tedious to repeat here. He sent away
the next day for his son, and in about twenty days
he came back with the messenger, bringing six or
seven horses loaded with very rich furs, and which,
in the whole, amounted to a very great value.

_ His servants brought the horses into the town,
but left the young lord at a distance till night.
when he came incognito into our apartment, and
1.11: father presented him to me; and, in short, we,
concerted there the manner of our travelling, and
every thing proper for the journey.

I had bought a considerable quantity of sables,
black fox-skins, fine crmines, and such other furs
that are very rich; I say, I had bought them in that
city in exchange for some of the goods I brought
from China: in particular, for the cloves and nut-
megs, of which 1 sold the greatest part here, and
the rest afterwards at Archangel, for a much better
price than I could have done at London; and my
partner, who was sensible of the profit, and whose
business more particularly than mine was merchan-
dise, was mightily pleased with our stay, on ac-
count of the traflic we made here.

It was the beginning of June when I left this
remote place; a city, I believe, little heard of in
the world ; and indeed it is so far out of the road of
commerce, that I know not how it should be much
talked of. We were now come to a very small can
ravan, being only thirty-two horses and camels in
all; and all of them passed for mine, though my
new guest was proprietor of eleven of them. It
was most natural also, that I should take more ser-
vants with me than I had before, and the young
lord passed for my steward; what great man I
passed for myself, 1 know not, neither did it con-
cern me to inquire. We had here the worst and
the largest desert to pass over that we met with in
all the journey; indeed I call it the worst, because
the way was very deep in some places, and very un-
even in others: the best we had to say for it, was.
that we thought we had no troops of Tartars and
robbers to fear, and that they never came on this
side of the river Oby, or, at least, but very seldom;
but we found it otherwise.

My young lord had with hima faithful Muscovite
servant, or rather a Siberian servant, who was per-
fectly acquainted with the country, and who led "5
by private roads, that we avoided coming into the
principal towns and cities, upon the great road:
such as Tumen, Soloy-Kamaskoy, and several others,
because the Muscovite garrisons which are kept
there, are very curious and strict in their observa-
tion upon travellers, and searching lest any of the
banished persons'of note should make their escape
that way into Musc0vy; but by this means, as we
were kept out of the cities, so our whole journey
was a desert, and we were obliged to encamp, and
lie in our tents, when we might have had very good
accommodation in the cities on the way. This the
young lord was so sensible of, that he would not
allow us to lie abroad, when we came to several
cities on the way, but lay abroad himself, with his
servant, in the woods, and met us always at the ap-
pointed places.

We were just entered Europe, having passed the
river Kama, which, in these parts, is the boundary
between Europe and Asia; and the first city, on the
European side, was called Soloy-Kamaskoy, which
is as much as to say, the great city on the river
Kama; and here we thought to have seen some
evident alteration in the people, their manners, their
habit, religion, and their business; but we were
mistaken, for as we had a vast desert to pass, which,
by relation, is near seven hundred miles long, in
some places, but not above two hundred miles over
where we passed it; so, till we came past that hor-
rible place, we found very little difference between
that country and the Mogul Tartary, and the peo-
ple mostly pagans, and little better than the sa-
vages of America; their houses and towns full of
idols, and their way of living wholly barbarous, ex-
cept in the cities as above, and the villages near
them, where they are Christians, as they call them--
selves, of the Greek church; but even these have
their religion mingled with so many reliques of su~

,perstition, that it is scarce to be known in some
places from more sorcery and witchcraft.

In passing this forest, I thought indeed we must,
after all our dangers were, in our imagination, cs-
caped, as before, have been plundered and robbed.
and, perhaps, murdered, by a troop of thieves: of
what country they were, whether the roving bands
of the Ostiachi, a kind of Tartars, or wild peeple
on the bank of the Oby, and ranged thus far, or
whether they were the sable-hunters of Siberia,l
am yet at a loss to know; but they were all on
horseback, carried bows and arrows. and were at
first about five-and-forty in number: they came so
near to us, as within about two musket-shot, and,
asking no questions, they surrounded us with their
horse, and looked very earnestly upon us twice.
At length they placed themselves just in our way,
upon which we drew up in a little line before our
camels, being not above sixteen men in all; and
sent out the Siberian servant who attended his
lord, to see who they were. His master was the
more willing to let him go, because he was not a
little apprehensive, that they were a Siberian troop
sent out after him. The man came up near them.
with a flag of truce, and called to them; but though
he spoke several of their languages, or dialects of
languages rather, he could not understand a word
they said. However, after some signs to him, not
to come nearer to them at his peril, so he said he
understood them to mean, offering to shoot at him
if he advanced, the fellow came back no wiser than
he went; only that, by their dress, he said, he be-
lieved them to be some 'l'artars of Kalmuck, or of
the Circassiau hordes, and that there must be m0!"8
of them, on the great desert, though he never
.heard that ever any of them were seen so far north
before.

This was small comfort to us. However, we had
no remedy. There was, on our left hand, at about
a quarter of a mile's distance, a little grove or
clump of trees, which stood close together, and very
near the road. 1 immediately resolved we would
advance to those trees, and fortify ourselves as well
as we could there , for, first, I considered that $116
trees would, in a great measure, cover usfrom their
arrows, and, in the next place, they could not come
to charge us in a body. It was indeed my old Por-
tuguese pilot who proposed it, and who had this
excellency attending him, namely, that he was al.
ways readiest and most apt to direct and encourage
us, in cases of the most danger. We advanced im-
mediately with what speed we could, and gained
that little wood, the 'l'artars, or thieves, for we
knew not what to call them, keeping their stand,
and not attempting to hinder us. When we came
thither, we found, to our great satisfaction, that it
was a swampy, Springy piece of ground, and, on
the one side, a very great spring of water, which
running out in a little rill, or brook, was a little far-
ther joined by another of the like bigness, and was,
in short, the head, or source, of a considerable river,
called afterwards the Wirtska. The trees which
grew about this spring were not in all above two
hundred, but were very large, and stood pretty
thick; so that as soon as we got in, we saw our-
selves perfectly safe from the enemy, unless they
alighted and attacked us on foot.

But, to make this more difficult, our Portuguese,
with indefatigable application, cut down great arms
0f the trees, and laid them hanging, not cut quite
05, from onetree to another; so that he made a
continued fence almost round us.

We staid here, waiting the motion of the enemy
some hours, without perceiving they made any offer
to stir, when, about two hours before night, they
came directly uponrus; and, though we had not
Perceived it, we found they had been joined by
SS0me more of the same, so that they were near
lourscore horse; whereof, however, we fancied
some were women. They came on till they were
Within half a shot of our little wood, when we fired
one musket, without ball, and called to them, in
the Russian tongue, to know what they wanted,
and bade them keep off; but, as if they knew no:

i
.thing of what we said, they came on with a double
fury, directly up to the wood side, not imagining
we were so barricadoed that they could not break
in. Our old pilot was our captain, as well as he
had been our engineer, and desired of us not to
fire upon them till they came within pistol shot,
that we might be sure to kill; and that when we
did fire, we should be sure to take good aim. We
bade him give the word of command, which he dc-
layed so long, that they were, some of them, within
two pikes' length of us when we fired.

We aimed so true (or Providence directed our
shot so sure), that we killed fourteen of them a:
the first volley, and wounded several others, as also
several of their horses; for we had all of us loaded
our pieces with two or three bullets apiece, at least.

They were terribly surprised with our tire, and re-
treated immediately about one hundred rods from
us, in which time we loaded our pieces again, and
seeing them keep at that distance, we sallied out.
and caught four or five of their horses, whose ri-
ders, we supposed, were killed; and, coming up
to the dead, we could easily perceive they were
Tartars, but knew not from what country, or how
they came to make an excursion of such an unu~
sual length.

About an hour after, they made a motion to at'
tack us again, and rode round our little wood, to
see where else they might break in ; but finding 113
always ready to face them, they went ofl' again ,and
we resolved not to stir from the place for that
night.

We slept little, you may be sure, but spent the
most part of the night in strengthening our situadeg
tion, and barricadoing the entrances into the wood;
and, keeping a strict watch, we waited for daylight:
and, when it came, it gave us a. very unwelcome
discovery indeed; for the enemy, who we thought-
were discouraged with the reception they had mt't
with, were now increased to no less than three hun-
dred, and had set up eleven 'or twelve huts and
tents, as if they were resolved to besiege us; and
this little camp they had pitched was upon the open
plain, at about three quarters of a mile from us.
We were indeed surprised at this discovery, and now,
I confess, I gave myself over for lost, and all that I
had. The loss of my effects did not lie so near me
(though they were very considerable), as the
thoughts of falling into the hands of such barba-
rians, at the latter end of my journey, after so
many dili'iculties and hazards as I had gone through;
and even in sight of our port, where we expected
safety and deliverance. As for my partner, he was
raging: he declared that to lose his goods would be
his ruin, and he would rather die than be starved;
and he was for fighting to the last drop.

The young lord, as gallant as ever flesh showed
itself, was for fighting to the last also; and my old
pilot was of opinion that we were able to resist
them all, in the situation we then were in: and
thus we spent the day in debates of what we should
do; but towards evening we found that the num-
ber of our enemies still increased. Perhaps, as they
were abroad in several parties for prey, the first had
sent out scouts to call for help, and to acquaint
them of the booty; and we did not know but by
the morning they might still be a greater number;
50 I began to inquire of those people we had
brought from Tobolski, if there was no other, or
more private ways, by which we might avoid them
111 the night, and, perhaps, either retreat to some
town, or get help to guard us over the desert.

The Siberian, who was servant to the young lord,
told us, if we designed to avoid them, and not fight,
he would engage to carry us offiu the night to a
Way that went north, toward the river I'ctraz, by
Which he made no question but we might get away.
and the Tartars never the wiser ; but, he said, his
10rd had told him, he would not retreat, but would
rather choose to fight. I told him, he mistook his
lord, for that he was too wise a man to love fight;
ing for the sake of it; that I knew his lord was
brave enough, by what he had showed already; but
that his lord knew better, than to desire to have se-
venteen or eighteen men fight five hundred, unless
an unavoidable necessity forced them to it; and
that, if he thought it possible for us to escape in the
night, we had nothing else to do but to attempt it.
He answered, if his lord gave him such an order,
he would lose his life, if he did not perform it. We
soon brought his lord to give that order, though
privately. and we immediately prepared for the
putting it in practice.

And, first, as soon as it began to be dark, we
kindled a [fire in our little camp, which we kept
burning, and prepared so as to make it burn all
night, that the Tartars might conclude we were
still there; but as soon as it was dark, that is to
say, so as we could see the stars (for our guide
would not stir before), having all our horses and
camels ready loaden, we followed our new guide,
who, I soon found, steered himself by the pole, or
north star, all the country being level for a long
way.

After we had travelled two hours very hard, it
began to be lighter still; not that it was quite dark
all night, but the moon began to rise, so that, in
short, it was rather lighter than we wished it to be;
but by six o',clock next morning, we were gotten
near forty miles, though the truth is, wealmost
spoiled our horses. Here we found a Russian vil-
lage, named Kirmazinskoy, where we rested, and
heard nothing of the Kalmuck Tartars that day.
About two hours before night, we set out again.
and travelled till eight the next morning, though
not quite so hastily as before; and about seven
o'clock we passed a little river called Iiirtza, and
came to a good large town, inhabited by Russians,
and very populous, called Ozomoys. There we
heard, that several troops or hordes of Iialmucks
had been abroad upon the desert, but that we were
now completely out of danger of them, which was '
to our great satisfaction, you may be sure. Here
we were obliged to get some fresh horses, and,
having need enough of rest, we staid five days;
and my partner and I agreed to give the honcst
Siberian, who brought us thither, the value of ten
pistoles, for his conducting us.

In five days more we came to Veussima, upon
the river WitZOgda, which running into the river
Dwina, we were there very happily near the end
of our travels by land, that river being naviga-
ble in seven days' passage to Archangel. From
hence .we came to Lawrenskoy. where the river
joins, the third of July, and provided ourselves
with two luggage boats, and a barge, for our con-
venience. We embarked the seventh, and arrived
all safe at Archangel the eighteenth, having been a
year, five months, and three days, on the journey,
including our stay of eight months and odd days
at Tobolski.

We were obliged to stay at this place six weeks
for the arrival of the ships, and must have tarried
longer, had not a Hamburgher come in above a
month sooner than any of the English ships; when
after somegconsideration, that the city of Ham-
burgh might happen to be as good a market for
our goods as London, we all took freight with him;
and, having put our goods on board, it was most na-
tural for me to put my steward on board, to take
care of them, by which means my young lord had a
sufficient Opportunity to conceal himself, never
coming on shore again in all the time we staid
there; and this he did, that he might not be seen
In the city, where some of the Moscow merchants
would certainly have seen and discovered him.

We sailed from Archangel the twentieth of Au-
EDSt, the same year, and, after no extraordinary
bad voyage, arrived in the Elbe, the thirteenth
0f September. Here thy-partner and I found a very
good sale for our goods, as well those of China, as
the sables, &c. of Siberia; and dividing the pro-
duce of our effects, my share amounted to three
thousand four hundred and seventy-five pounds, se-
venteen shillings, and three-pence, notwithstanding
so many losses we had sustained and charges we
had been at, only remembering that I had included
in this about six hundred pounds' worth of dia-
monds, which I had purchased at Bengal.

Here the young lord took his leave of us, and
went up the Elbe, in order to go to the court of
Vienna, where he resolved to seek protection, and
where he could correspond with those of his father's
friends who were left alive. He did not part with-
out all the testimonies he could give me of grati-
tude for the service I had done him, and his sense
of my kindness to the prince his father.

To conclude: having staid near four months in
Hamburgh, I came from thence over land to the
Hague where I embarked in the packet, and ar-
rived iu London the tenth of January, 1705, having
been gone from England ten years and nine months.

And here, resolving to harass myself no more, I
am preparing for a longer journey than all these,
having lived seventy-two years, a life of infinite
variety, and learned sufficiently to know the value
of retirement, and the blessing of ending our days
in peace.

THE END.
