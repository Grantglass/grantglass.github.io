PREFACE.
f"Tp HE success the former part of this Work
has met with in the world, has yet been
no other than is acknowledged to be due to
the surprising variety of the subject, and to
the agreeable manner of the performance.
All the endeavours of envious people to re-
proach it with being a romance, to search it
for errors in geography, inconsistency in the
relation, and contradictions in the fact, have
proved abortive, and as impotent as mali-
cious.
The just application of every Incident, th<*
religious and useful inferences drawn from
every part, are so many testimonies to the
good design of making it public, and must
legitimate all the part that may be called in-
vention or parable in the story.
Vol. II. A The
IV PREFACE.
The Second Part, if the Editor's opinion
may pass, is (contrary to the usage of Second
Parts) every way as entertaining as the First;
contains as strange and surprising incidents,
and as great a variety of them; nor is the
application less serious or suitable; and doubt-
less will, to the sober, as well as the ingenious
Reader, be every way as profitable and di-
verting; and this makes the abridging this
Work as scandalous, as it is knavish and ridi-
culous. Seeing, to shorten the Book, that they
may seem to reduce the value, they strip it of
all those reflections, as well religious as moral,
which are not only the greatest beauties of the
Work, but are calculated for the infinite ad-
vantage of the Reader.
By this, they leave the Work naked of its
brightest ornaments; and yet they would (at
the same time they pretend that the Author
has supplied his story out of his invention)
take from it the improvement, which alone
recommends that invention to wife and good
men.
The injury these men do to the Propri-
etors of Works, is a practice all honest

men abhor; and they believe they may chal-
lenge them' to shew the disference between that
and robbing on the highway, or breaking open
a house.
If they cannot shew any difference in the
crime, they will find it hard to shew why
there should be any difference in the punish-
ment.

4 LIFE AND ADVENTURES
Nay sarther, the common motive of foreign ad-
ventures was taken away in me; for I had no fortune
to make, I had nothing to seek: If I had gained ten
thousand pounds, I had been no richer; for I had
already sufficient for me, and for those I had to leave
it to; and that I had was visibly increasing; for
having no great samily, I could not spend the income
of what I had, unless I would set up for an expensive
way of living, such as a'great samily, servants,
equipage, gaiety, and the like, which were things I
had no notion of, or inclination to; so that I had
nothing indeed to do but to sit still, and fully enjoy
what I had get, and see it increase daily upon my
hands.
Yet all these things had no effect upon me, or at
least not enough to resist the strong inclination I
had to go abroad again, which hung about me like a
chronical distemper; particularly the defire of seeing
my new plantation in the island, and the colony I left
there, run in my head continually. I dreamed of it
all night, and my imagination run upon it all day;
it was uppermost in all my thoughts, and my sancy
worked so steadily and strongly upon it, that I talked
of it in my fleep; in short, nothing could remove it
out of my mind; it even broke so violently into all
my discourses, that it made my conversation tiresome;
for I could talk of nothing else, all my discourse run
into it, even to impertinence, and I saw it myself.
I kavg
OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 3
T have often heard persons of good judgment say,
that all the stir people make in the world about
ghosts and apparitions, is owing to the strength of
imagination, and the powerful operation of sancy
in their minds; that there is no such thing as a spirit
appearing, or a ghost walking, and the like; that
people's poring affectionately upon the past conversa-
tion of their deceased friends so realises it to them,
that they are capable of sancying upon some extra-
ordinary circumstances that they fee them, talk, to
them, and are answered by them, when, in truth,
there is nothing but shadow and vapour in the thing;
and they really know nothing of the matter.
For my part, I know not to this hour whether
there are any such things as real apparitions, spectres,
or walking of people after they are dead, or whether
there is any thing in the stories they tell us of that
kind, more than the product of vapours, sick minds,
and wandering sancies: But this I know, that my
imagination worked up to such a height, and brought
me into such excess of vapours, or what else I may
call it, that I actually supposed myself often-times
upon the spot, at my old castle behind the trees, saw
my old Spaniard, Friday's sather, and the reprobate
sailors whom I left upon theisland; nay, I sancied I talk-
ed with them, and looked at them so steadily, though
I was broad awake, as at persons just before me; and
this I did till I often frightened myself with the images
my sancy represented to me: one time in my fleep I
had the villainy of the three pirate sailors so lively relat-
ed to me by the first Spaniard and Fry day's sather, that
it was surprizing; they told me how they barbarously
attempted to murder all the Spaniards, and that they
B 2 set

LIFE AND ADVENTURES
set fire to the provisions they had laid up, on pur-
pose to distress and starve them, things that I had
never heard of, and that were yet all of them
true in sact: but it was so warm in my imagina-
tion, and so realized to me, that to the hour I saw
them, I could not be persuaded but that it was or
would be true; also, how I resented it when the
Spaniard complained to me, and how I brought them
to justice, tried them before me, and ordered them
1 all three to be hanged: what there was really in this,
shall be seen in its place: for however I came to form
such things in my dream, and what secret converse
of spirits injected it, yet there was, I say, very much
of it true. I own, that this dream had nothing
literally and specifically true: but the general part
was so true, the base and villainous behaviour of these
three hardened rogues was such, and had been so
much worse than all I can describe, that the dream
had too much similitude of the fact, and as I would
afterwards have punished them severely; so if I had
hanged them all, I had been much in the right, and
should have been justifiable both by the laws of God
and man.
But to return to my story. In this kind of temper
I had lived some years; I had no enjoyment of my
life, no pleasant hours, no agreeable diversion but
what had something or other of this in it, so that
my wife, who saw my mind so wholly bent upon it,
told me very scriously one night, that she believed
there was some secret powerful impulse of Providence
upon me, which had determined me to go thither
again; and that she found nothing hindred my going
but my being engaged to.a wife and children. She
told
5
told me, that it was true she could not think of part-
ing with me; but as she was assured, that if she was
dead it would be the first thing I would do; so, as
it seemed to her that the thing was determined above,
she would not be the only obstruction: for if I
thought sit, and resolved to go here she found
me very intent upon her words, and that I looked
very earnestly at her; so that it a little disordered her,
and she stopped. I asked her why she did not go on,
and say out what she was going to say? But I per-
ceived her heart was too full, and some tears stood in
her eyes: Speak out my dear, said I, are you willing
I should go? No, says she, very affectionately, I am sar
from willing: but if you are resolved to go, says she,
and rather than I will be the only hindrance, I will
go with you; for though I think it a preposte-
rous thing for one of your years, and in your condi-
tion, yet if it must be, said she again, weeping, I
won't leave you; for if it be of heaven, you must
do it; there is no resisting it; and if heaven makes
it your duty to go, he will also make it mine to go
with you, or otherwise dispose of me, that I may
not obstruct it.
This affectionate behaviour of my wife brought
me a little out of the vapours, and I began to consider
what I was doing; I corrected my wandering sancy,
and began to argue with myself sedately, what busi-
ness I had, after threescore years, and after such a
life of tedious sufferings and disasters, and closed in
so happy and easy a manner, I say, what business
had I to rush into new hazards, and put myself upon
adventures, fit only for youth and poverty to run.
into?
B 3 With
"With those thoughts, I considered my new engage-
ment; that I had a wife, one child born, and my
Wife then great with child of another; that I had
all the world could give me, and had no need to seek
hazards for gain; that I was declining in years, and
ought to think rather of leaving what I had gained,
than of seeking to increase it; that as to what my
wife had said, of its being an impulse from heaven,
and that it should be my duty to go, I had no notion
of that; so after many of these cogitations, I strug-
gled with the power of my imagination, reasoned my-
self out of it, as I believe people may always do in like
eases, if they will; and, in a word, I conquered it;
composed myself with such arguments as occurred to
my thoughts, and which my present condition fur-
nished me plentifully with; and particularly, as the
most effectual method, I resolved to divert myself
with other things, and to engage in some business
that might effectually tie me up from any more
excursions of this kind; for I found the thing return
upon me chiefly when I was idle, had nothing to do,
or any thing of moment immediately before me.
To this purpose I bought a little sarm in the coun-
ty of Bedford, and resolved to remove myself thither.
I had a little convenient house upon it, and the land
about it I found was capable of great improvement,
and that it was many ways suited to my inclination,
which delighted in cultivating, managing, planting
and improving of land; and particularly, being an
inland country, I was removed from conversing
among ships, sailors, and things relating to the re-
mote part of the world.
In
In a word, I went down to my sarm, settled my
family, bought me ploughs, harrows, a cart, waggon,
horses, cows, sheep; and setting seriously to work,
became in one half year a meer country gentleman;
my thoughts were entirely taken up in managing my
servants, cultivating the ground, enclosing, planting,
&c. and I lived, as I thought, the most agreeable
life that nature was capable of directing, or that a
man always bred to misfortunes was capable of being
retreated to.
I sarmed upon my own land, I had no rent to
pay, was limited by no articles; I could pull up or
cut down as I pleased: what I planted was for my-
self, and what I improved, was for my samily; and
having thus left osf the thoughts of wandering, I had
not the least discomfort in any part of my life, as to this
world. Now I thought indeed, that I enjoyed the
middle state of life which my sather so earnestly re-
commended to me, a kind of heavenly life, some-
thing like what is described by the poet upon the
subject of a country life,
Free from vices, free from care,
Age has no pains, and youth no snare.
But in the middle of all this felicity, one blow
from unforeseen Providence unhinged me at once;
and not only made a breach upon me, inevitable and
incurable, but drove me, by its consequence, upon
a deep relapse into the wandering disposition; which,
as I may say, being born in my very blood, soon re-
covered its hold of me, and, like the returns of a
violent distemper, came on with an irresistible force
upon me; so that nothing could make any more
B 4 impression.

LIFE AND ADVENTURES
impression upon me. This blow was the loss of
my wife.
It is not my business here to write an elegy upon
my wife, to give a character of her particular virtues,
and make my court to the sex by the flattery of a
funeral sermon. She was, in a few words, the stay
of all my affairs, the center of all my enterprizes,
the engine that by her prudence reduced me to that
happy compass I was in, from the most extravagant
and ruinous project that fluttered in my head as
above; and did more to guide my rambling genius,
than a mother's tears, a sather's instructions, a friend's
counsel, or all my own reasoning powers could do.
I was happy in listening to her tears, and in being
moved by her entreaties, and to the last degree deso-
late and dislocated in the world by the loss of her.
When she was gone, the world looked aukwardly
round me; I was as much a stranger in it, in my
thoughts, as I was in the Brasils when I went first
on shore there; and as much alone, except as to the
assistance of servants, as I was in my island. I knew
neither what to do, or what not to do. I saw the
world busy round me, one part labouring for bread,
and the other part squandring in vile excesses or
empty pleasures, equally miserable, because the end
they proposed still fled from them; for the men of
pleasure every day surfeited of their vice, and heaped
up work for sorrow and repentance; and the men
of labour spent their strength in daily strugglings for
breath to maintain the vital strength they laboured
with, so living in a daily circulation of sorrow, living
but to work, and working but to live, as if daily
bread
9
bread were the only end of a wearisome life, and a
wearisome life the only occasion of daily bread.
This put me in mind of the life I lived in my
kingdom, the island; where I suffered no more corn
to grow, because I did not want it; and bred no
more goats, because I had no more use for them:
where the money lay in the drawer till it grew
mildewed, and had scarce the savour to be looked
upon in 20 years.
All these things, had I improved them as I ought
to have done, and as reason and religion had dictated
to me, would have taught me to search sarther than
human enjoyments for a full felicity, and that there
was something which certainly was the reason and
end of life, superior to all these things, and which
was either to be possessed, or at least hoped for, on
this fide the grave.
But my sage counsellor was gone; I was like a ship
without a pilot, that could only run before the wind:
my thoughts run all away again into the old affair, my
head was quite turned with the whimsies of foreign
adventures; and all the pleasing innocent amusements
of my sarm, and my garden, my cattle, and my
samily, which before entirely poffest me, were no-
thing to me, had no relish, and were like music to
one that has no ear, or food to one that has no taste:
In a word, I resolved to leave off house-keeping, lett
my sarm, and return to London; and in a few
months after I did so.
When I came to London, I was still as uneasy as
before i I had no relish to the place, no employ-
ment in it, nothing to do but to saunter about like
an idle person, of whom it may be said, he is per-
fectly useless in God's creation and it is not one
farthing
sarthing matter to the rest of his kind, whether he
be dead or alive. This also was the thing which of all
circumstances of life was the most my aversion, who
had been all my days used to an active life; and
I would often fay to myself, A slate of idleness is the
.very dregs of life; and indeed I thought I was much
more suitably employed, when I was 26 days
making me a deal board.
It was now the beginning of the year 1693, wnen
my nephew, whom as I have observed before I had
brought up to the sea, and had made him commander
of a ship, was come home from a short voyage to
Bilboa, being the first he had made; he came
to me, and told me, that some merchants of his
acquaintance had been proposing to him to go a
voyage for them to the East Indies and to China, as
private traders: and now uncle, says he, if you will
go to sea with me, I'll engage to land you upon your
old habitation in the island, for we arc to touch at
the Brasils.
Nothing can be a greater demonstration of a future
state, and of the existence of an invisible world, than
the concurrence of second causes with the ideas of
things which we form in our minds, perfectly re-
served, and not communicated to any in the world.
My nephew knew nothing how sar my distemper
of wandering was returned upon me, and I knew
nothing of what he had in his thoughts to say, when
that very morning before he came to me I had, in
a great deal of confusion of thought, and revolving
every part of my circumstances in my mind, come
to this resolution, viz. That I would go to Lisbon,
and consult with my old sea-captain; and so, if it was
rational
rational and practicable, I would go and see the
island again, and see what was become of my people
there. I had pleased myself also with the thoughts of
peopling the place, and carrying inhabitants from
hence, getting a patent for the possession, and I know
not what; when, in the middle of all this, in comes
my nephew, as 1 have said, with his project of carry-
ing me thither, in his way to the Eqsl Indies.
I paused a while at his words, and looking steadily
at him, What Devil, said I, sent you of this unlucky
errand? My nephew startled, as if he had been
frighted at first; but perceiving I was not much dis-
pleased with the proposal, he recovered himself. I
hope it may not be an unlucky proposal, Sir, says he;
I dare say you would be pleased to see your new co-
lony there, where you once reigned with more felicity
than most of your brother monarchs in the world.
In a word, the scheme hit so exactly with my tem-
per, that is to say, with the prepossession I was under,
and of which I have said so much, that I told him,
in few words, if he agreed with the merchants, I
would go with him: but I told him, I would not
promise to go any sarther than my own island. Why
Sir, says he, you don't want to be left there again,
I hope? Why, said I, can you not take me up again
in your return? he told me, it could not be possible
that the merchants would allow him to come that way
with a loaden ship of such value, it being a month's
sail out of his way, and might be three or four:
Besides, Sir, if I should miscarry, said he, and not
return at all, then you would be just reduced to
the condition you were in before.
This
This was very rational; but we both found out a
remedy for it, which was to carry a framed sloop on
board the ship, which, being taken in pieces and
shipped on board the ship, might, by the help of
some carpenters, who we agreed to carry with us,
be set up again in the island, and finished, fit to go
to sea in a few days.
I was not long resolving; for indeed the importu-
nities of my nephew joined in so effectually with my
inclination, that nothing could oppose me: on the
other hand, my wife being dead, I had nobody con-
cerned themselves so much for me, as to persuade
me one way or other, except my ancient good friend
the widow, who earnestly struggled with me to con-
sider my years, my easy circumstances, and the
needless hazard of a long voyage; and, above all,
my young children: but it was all to no purpose; I
had an irresistible defire to the voyage; and I told her
I thought there was something so uncommon in the
impressions I had upon my mind for the voyage, that
it would be a kind of resisting Providence, if I should
attempt to stay at home; after which me ceased her
expostulations, and joined with me, not only in
making provision for my voyage, but also in settling
my samily affairs in my absence, and providing for
the education of my children.'
In order to this, I made my will, and settled the
estate I had in such a manner for my children, and
placed in such hands, that I was perfectly easy and
satisfied they would have justice done them, what-
ever might besal me; and for their education, I left
it wholly to my widow, with a fuflicient maintenence
to herself for her care: all which she richly deserved;
for
for no mother could have taken more care in their
education, or understood it better; and as stie lived
till I came home, I also lived to thank her for it.
My nephew was ready to sail about the beginning
of "January 1694-5, and I with my man Friday went
on board in the Downs the 8th, having besides that
sloop which I mentioned above, a very considerable
cargo of all kinds of necessary things for my colony,
which, if I did not find in good condition, I resolved
to leave so.
First, I carried with me some servants, whom I pur-
posed to place there, as inhabitants, or at least to set
on work there upon my own account, while I stayed,
tind either to leave them there, or carry them for-
ward, as they should appear willing; particularly, I
carried two carpenters, a smith, and a very handy
ingenious fellow who was a cooper by trade, but
was also a general mechanick; for he was dextrous
at making wheels, and hand-mills to grind corn, was
a good turner, and a good pot maker; he also made
any thing that was proper to make of earth, or of
wood; in a word, we called him our Jack of all
trades.
With these I carried a taylor, who had offered
himself to go passenger to the East Indies with my
nephew, but afterwards consented to stay on our new
plantation, and proved a most necessary handy fellow
as could be defired, in many other businesses besides
that of this trade; for, as I observed formerly, neces-
sity arms us for all employments.
My cargo, as near as I can recollect, for I have
not kept an account of the particulars, consisted of a
sufficient quantity of linen, and some thin Englisb
stuffs
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
stusfs for cloathing the Spaniards that I expected to
find there, and enough of them as by my calculation
might comfortably supply them for seven years; if I
remember right, the materials which I carriedforcloath-
ing them, with gloves, hats, shoes, stockings, and all
such things as they could want for wearing, amount-
ed to above 200 pounds, including some beds, bed-
ding, and houshold-stusf, particularly kitchen uten-
sils, with pots, kettles, pewter, brass, Szc. besides near
a hundred pounds more in iron-work, nails, tools of
every kind, staples, hooks, hinges, and every neces-
sary thing I could think of.
I carried also a hundred spare arms, muskets, and
fuzees, besides some pistols, a considerable quantity
of shot of all sizes, three or four tons of lead, and
two pieces of brass cannon; and because I knew not
what time, and what extremities I was providing for,
I carried an hundred barrels of powder, besides
swords, cutlasses, and the iron part of some pikes,
and halberts; so that in short we had a large maga-
zine of all sorts of stores; and I made my nephew
carry two small quarter-deck guns more than he
wanted for his ship, to leave behind, if there was
occasion; that when they came there, we might build
a fort, and man it against all sorts of enemies: and
indeed, I at first thought there would be need enough
of it all, and much more, if we hoped to maintain
our possession of the island, as shall be seen in the
course of the story.
I had not such bad luck in this voyage as I had
been used to meet with; and therefore shall have the
less occasion to interrupt the reader, who perhaps
may be impatient to hear how matters went with
my . colony; yet some odd accidents, cross winds,
and bad Weather happened, on this first setting out,
which made the voyage longer than I expected it at
first; and I, who had never made but one voyage,
(viz.) my first voyage to Guinea, in which I might be
said to come back again as the voyage was at first
designed, began to think the same ill sate still attended
me; and that I was born to be never contented with
being on shore, and yet to be always unfortunate
at sea.
Contrary winds first put us to the northward, and
we were obliged to put in at Galway in Ireland, where
we lay. wind-bound two and thirty days; but we
had this satissaction.with the disaster, that provisions
were here exceeding cheap, and in the utmost plen-
ty; so that while we lay here we never touched
the ship's stores, but rather added to them; here also
I took several hogs, and two cows, with their calves,
which I resolved, if I had a good passage, to put on
shore in my island; but we found occasion to dispose
otherwise of them.
We set out the 5th of February from Ireland, and
had a very sair gale of wind for some days; as I re-
member, it might be about the 20th of February in
the evening late, when the mate having the watch,
came into the round-house, and told us he saw a
flash of fire, and heard a gun fired; and while he was
telling us of it, a boy came in, and told us the boat-
swain heard another. This made us all run out upon
the quarter-deck, where for a while we heard nothing,
but in a few minutes we saw a very great light, and
found that therewas some very terrible fire at a distance;
immediately we had recourse to our reckonings, in
which we all agreed that there could be no land
that
that way, in which the fire shewed itself, no not for
500 leagues, for it appeard at W. N. W. upon this
we concluded it must be some ship on fire at sea; and
as by our hearing the noise of guns just before, we
concluded it could not be sar oft", we stood directly
towards it, and were presently satisfied we should
discover it, because the sarther we sailed the greater
the light appeared, tho' the weather being hazy we
could not perceive any thing but the light for a
while; in about half an hour's sailing, the wind being
sair for us, though not much of it, and the weather
clearing up a little, we could plainly discern that it
was a great ship on fire in the middle of the sea.
I was most sensibly touched with this disaster,
though not at all acquainted with the persons engaged
in it; I presently recollected my former circumstances,
in what condition I was in when taken up by
the Portugal Captain ; and how much more deplorable
the circumstances of the poor creatures belonging to
this ship must be if they had no other ship in company
with them: upon this I immediately ordered, that
five guns should be fired, one soon after another,
that, if possible, we might give notice to them
that there was help for them at hand, and that they
might endeavour to save themselves in their boat;
for though we could fee the flame in the ship, yet
they, it being night, could see nothing of us.
We lay by some time upon this, only driving as
the burning ship drove, waiting for day light; when
on a sudden, to our great terror, though we had
reason to expect it, the ship blew up in the air, and
immediately sunk: this was terrible, and indeed an
asflicting sight, for the sake of the poor men, who, I
concluded,
17
toncluded must be either all destroyed in the ship,
or be in the utmost distress in their boats in the mid-
dle of the ocean, which, at present, by reason it was
dark, I could not see: however to direct them as well
as I could, I caused lights to be hung out in all the
parts of the ship where we could, and which we had
lanthorns for, and kept firing guns all the night
long 5 letting them know by this, that there was a
ship not sar off.
About eight o'clock in the morning, we discovered
the ship's boats, by the help of our perspective-glasses;
and found there were two of them, both thronged
with people, and deep in the water: we perceived
they rowed, the wind being against them; that they
saw our ship, and did the utmost to make us fee
them.
We immediately spread our ancient, to let them
know we saw them; and hung a waft out, as a sig-
nal for them to come on board; and then made more
fail, standing directly to them. In a little more than
half an hour, we came up with them, and, in a
word, took them all in, being no less than sixty-
four men, women, and children; for there were a
great many passengers.
Upon the whole, we found it was a French mer-
chant-ship of 300 tons, homeward-bound from
Quebeck, in the river of Canada. The master gave
us a long account of the distress of his ship, how the
fire began in the steerage by the negligence of the
steersman; but, on his crying out for help, was, as
every body thought, entirely put out: but they soon
found that some sparks of the first fire had gotten
into some part of the ship, so disficult to come at,
Vol. II. C that
that they could not effectually quench it; and after-
wards getting in between the timbers, and within
the cieling of the ship, it proceeded into the hold,
and mastered all the skill and all the application
they were able to exert.
They had no more to do then but to get into their
boats, which, to their great comfort, were pretty
large;- being their long boat, and a great shallop,
besides a small skiff, which was of no great service to
them, other than to get some fresh water and provi-
sions into her, after they had secured themselves from
the fire. They had indeed small hope of their lives
by getting into these boats at that distance from any
land; only, a6 they said well, that they were escaped
from the fire, and had a possibility, that some ship
might happen to be at sea, and might take them in.
They had sails, oars, and a compass; and were pre-
paring to make the best of their way to Newfound-
land, the wind blowing pretty sair; for it blew an
easy gale at S. E. by E. They had as much provi-
sions and water, as, with sparing it so as to be next
door to starving, might support them about 12 days;
in which, if they had no bad weather, and no con-
trary winds, the captain said, he hoped he might get
to the banks of Newfoundland, and might perhaps
take some sifli to sustain them till they might go on
shore. But there were so many chances against them
in all these cases; such as storms to overset and foun-
der them; rains and cold to benumb and perish their
limbs; contrary winds to keep them out and starve
them; that it must have been next to miraculous if
they had escaped.
In the midst os their consultations, every one being
hopeless, and ready to despair, the captain with tears
in
in his eyes told me, they were on a sudden surprised
with the joy of hearing a gun fire, and after that
four more; these were the five guns which I caused
to be fired at first seeing the light: this revived their
hearts, and gave them the notice, which, as above,
I designed it should, viz. that there was a ship at
hand for their help.
It was upon the hearing these guns, that they took
down their masts and fails; and the found coming
from the windward, they resolved to lie by till
morning. Some time after this, hearing no more
guns, they fired three musquets, one a considerable
while after another; but these, the wind being con-
trary, we never heard.
Some time after that again, they were still more
agreeably surprised with seeing our lights, and hear-
ing the guns, which, as I have said, I caused to be
fired all the rest of the night; this set them to work
with their oars to keep their boats a-head, at least
that we might the sooner come up with them; and
at last, to their inexpressible joy, they found we saw
them 4
It is impossible for me to express the several gestures,
the strange ecstasies, the variety of postures, which
these poor delivered people run into, to express the
joy of their fouls at so unexpected a deliverance;
grief and fear are easily described; sighs, tears,
groans, and a very few motions of head and hands,
make up the sum of its variety: but an excess of joy,
a surprise of joy, has a thousand extravagancies in it;
there were some in tears, some raging and tearing
themselves, as if they had been in the greatest agonies
of sorrow; some stark raving and down-right luna-
C 2 tic;
tic; some ran about the ship stamping with their
feet, others wringing their hands; some were
dancing, several singing, some laughing, more cry-
ing; many quite dumb, not able to speak a word;
others side and vomiting, several swooning, and
ready to saint; and a few were crossing themselves
and giving God thanks.
I would not wrong them neither; there might be
many that were thankful afterward; but the passion
was too strong for them at sirst, and they were not
able to master it; they were thrown into ecstasies and
a kind of frenzy, and so there were but a very few
who were composed and serious in their joy.
Perhaps also the case may have some addition to it,
from the particular circumstance of the nation they
belonged to; I mean the French, whose temper is
allowed to be more volatile, more passionate, and
more sprightly, and their spirits more fluid, than of
other nations. I am not philosopher to determine
the cause, but nothing I had ever seen before came
up to it: the ecstasies poor Friday, my trusty savage,
was in, when he found his sather in the boat, came
the nearest to it; and the surprise of the master, and
his two companions, whom I delivered from the two
villains that set them on more in the island, came a
little way towards it; but nothing was to compare
to this, either that I saw in Friday, or any where else
in my life.
It is sarther observable, that these extravagancies
d'd not show themselves in that different manner I
have mentioned, in disferent persons only: but all
the variety would appear in a short succession of mo-
ments, in one and the fame person. A man that we
saw
21
sow this minute dumb, and, as it were, stupid and
confounded, mould the next minute be dancing and
hallooing like an antick; and the next moment a
tearing his hair, or pulling his clothes to pieces, and
stamping them under his sect like a madman; a few
minutes after that, we should have him all in tears,
then sick, then swooning; and had not immediate
help been had, would in a few moments more have
been dead; and thus it was, not with one or two,
or ten or twenty, but with the greatest part of them;
and, if I remember right, our surgeon was obliged to
let above thirty of them blood.
There were two priests among them, one an old
man, and the other a young man; and that which
was strangest was, that the oldest man was the
worst.
As soon as he set his foot on board our ship, and
saw himself safe, he dropped down stone-dead, to all
appearance; not the least sign of life could be per-
ceived in him; our surgeon immediately applied pro-
per remedies to recover him; and was the only man
in the ship that believed he was not dead: and at
length he opened a vein in his arm, having first cha-
fed and rubbed the part, so as to warm it as much
as possible: upon this the blood, which only dropped
at first, flowed something freely; in three minutes
after the man opened his eyes; and about a quarter .
of an hour after that he spoke, grew better, and,
in a little time, quite well; after the blood was stop-
ped, he walked about, told us he was perfectly well,
took a dram of cordial which the surgeon gave him,
and was, what we called, come to himself; about a
quarter of an hour after this, they came running
C 3 into
22
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
into the cabbin to the surgeon, who was bleeding a
French woman that had sainted; and told him, the
priest was gone Hark mad. It seems" he had began
to revolve the change of his circumstances in his
mind, and this put him into an ecstacy of joy; his
spirits whirled about saster than the vessels could con-
vey them; the blood grew hot and feverish; and the
man was as fit for Bedlam as any creature that ever
was in it; the surgeon would not bleed him again in
that condition, but gave him something to doze and
put him to sleep, which, after some time, operated
upon him, and he waked next morning perfectly
composed, and well.
The younger priest behaved himself with great com-
mand of his passion, and was really an example of a
serious well-governed mind; at his first coming on
board the ship, he threw himself flat on his sace,
prostrating himself in thankfulness for his deliverance;
in which I unhappily and unseasonably disturbed him,
really thinking he had been in a swoon; but he spoke
calmly; thanked me; told me, he was giving God
thanks for his deliverance; begged me to leave him
a few moments, and that, next to his Maker, he
would give me thanks also.
I was heartily sorry that I disturbed him; and not
only left him, but kept others from interrupting him
also; he continued in that posture about three
minutes, or a little more, after I left him; then came
to me, as he had said he would, and, with a great
deal of seriousness and affection, but with tears in
his eyes, thanked me, that had, under God, given
him and so many miserable creatures their lives:
I told him, I had no room to move him to thank
God
God for it, rather than me; for I had seen, that he
had done that already: but I added, that it was
nothing but what reason and humanity dictated to
all men, and that we had as much reason as he to
give thanks to God, who had blessed us so sar as to
make us the instruments of his mercy to so many of
his creatures.
After this the young priest applied himself to his
country folks; laboured to compose them; persuaded
intreated, argued, reasoned with them, and did his
utmost tokcep them within the exercise of their rea-
son; and with some he had success, though others
were, for a time, out of all government of
themselves.
I cannot help committing this to writing, as per-
haps it may be useful to those into whose hands it
may sall, in the guiding themselves in all the extrava-
gancies of their paflions; for if an excess of joy can
carry men out to such a length beyond the reach of
their reason, what will not the extravagancies of
anger, rage, and a provoked mind, carry us to?
And indeed, here I saw reason for keeping an ex-
ceeding watch over our passions of every kind, as
well those of joy and satissaction, as those of sorrow
and anger.
We were something disordered by these extrava-
gancies among our new guests for the first day; but
when they had been retired, lodgings provided for
them as well as our ship would allow, and they had
slept heartily, as most of them did, being satigued
and frightened, they were quite another sort of peo-
ple the next day.
C 4 Nothing
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
Nothing of good manners, or civil acknow-
ledgments for the kindness shewn them was wanting;
the French, it is known, are naturally apt enough
to exceed that way. The captain, and one of the
priests, came to me the next day; and, desiring to
speak with me and my nephew, the commander,
began to consult with us what should be done with
them; and first they told us, that, as we had saved
their lives, so all they had was little enough for a
return to us for the kindness received. The captain
said, they had saved some money, and some things
of value in their boats, catched hastily out of the
flames; and if we would accept it, they were ordered
to make an osfer of it all to us; they only defired to
be set on shore somewhere in our way, where, if
possible, they might get a passage to France.
My nephew was for accepting their money at first
word, and to consider what to do with them after-
wards; but I over-ruled him in that part; for I knew
what it was to be set on ftore in a strange country;
and if the Portugal captain that took me up at sea
had served me so, and took all I had for my delive-
rance, I must have starved, or have been as much a
slave at the Brasilf, as I had been at Barbary, the
being fold to a Mahometan only excepted; and per-
haps a Portuguese is not a much better master than a
Turk, if not, in some cases, a much worse.
I therefore told the French captain, that we had
taken them up in their distress, it was true; but that
it was out duty to do so, as we we;e sellow-creatures,
and as we would defire to be so delivered, if we were
in the like or any other extremity; that we had done
nothing for them, but what we believed they would
have
*5
have done for us if we had been in their case, and
they in our's; but that we took them up to serve them,
not to plunder them; and that it would be a most bar-
barous thing, to take that little from them which they
had saved out of the fire, and then set them on shore,
and leave them; that this would be first to save
them from death, and then kill them ourselves; save
ihem from drowning, and then abandon them to
starving; and therefore I would not let the least
thing be taken from them: as to setting them on
shore, I told them indeed, that was an exceeding
difficulty to us, for that the ship was bound to the
East-Indics; and though w e were driven out of our
course to the westward a very great way, which per-
haps was directed by heaven on purpose for their de-
liverance, yet it was impossible for us wilfully to
change our voyage on this particular account; nor
could my nephew, the captain, answer it to the
freighters, with whom he was under charter-party to
pursue his voyage by the way of Brastl; and all I
knew he could do for them was, to put ourselves in
the way of meeting with other snips homeward-
bound from the West-Indies, and get them passage,
if possible, to England or France.
The first part of the proposal was so generous and
kind, they could not but be very thankful for it; but
they were in a great consternation, especially the pas-
sengers, at the notion of being carried away to the
East-Indies: they then intreated me, that seeing I
was driven so sar to the westward before I met with
them, I would at least keep on the same course to the
banks of 'Newfoundland, where it was possible I might
meet with some ship or sloop that they might hire to
carry them back to Canada, from whence they came.
I thought
2 6
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
I thought this was but a reasonable request on their
part; and therefore I inclined to agree to it; for in-
deed I considered, that to carry this whole company
to the East-Indies, would not only be an intolerable
severity to the poor people, but would be ruining our
whole voyage by devouring all our provisions; so I
thought it no breach of charter-party, but what an
unforeseen accident made absolutely necessary to us;
and in which no one could fay we were to blame;
for the laws of God and nature would have forbid,
that we should refuse to take up two boats full of
people in such a distressed condition; and the nature
of the thing as well respecting ourselves, as the poor
people, obliged us to fee them on shore somewhere
or other, for their deliverance; so I consented that
we would carry them to Newfoundland, if wind and
weather would permit; and, if nor, that I would
carry them to Mariinico in the IVcst-Indies.
The wind continued fresh easterly, but the wea-
ther pretty good; and as it had blov. ed continually
in the points between N. E. and S. E. a long time,
we miffed several opportunities of fending them to
France; for we met several ships bound to Europe,
whereof two were French, from St. Christopher's;
but they had been so long beating up against the
wind, that they durst take in no passengers for fear
of wanting provisions for the voyage, as well for
themselves as for those they should take in; so we
were obliged to go on. It was about a week after this,
that we made the Banks of Newfoundland, where, to
shorten my story, we put all our French people on
board a bark, which they hired at sea there, to put
them on more, and afterwards to carry them to
France,
27
France, if they could get provisions to victual them-
selves with: when, I say, all the French went on
shore, I mould remember, that the young priest I
spoke of, hearing we were bound to the Eqsl Indies,
desired to go the voyage with us, and to be set on
shore on the coast of Coromandel: I readily agreed to
that; for I wonderfully liked the man, and had very
good reason, as will appear afterwards; also four of
the seamen entered themselves in our ship, and pro-
ved very useful fellows.
From hence we directed our course for the West-
Indies, steering away S. and S. by E, for about 20
days together, sometimes little or no wind at all,
when we met with another subject for our humanity
to work upon, almost as deplorable as that before.
It was in the latitude of 27 degrees 5 minutes N.
and the 19th day of March, 1684-5, when we espied
a sail, our course S. E. and by S. We soon perceived
it was a large vessel, and that she bore up to us; but
could not at first know what to make of her, till, after
coming a little nearer, we found she had lost her
main-top-mast, sore-mast, and bowsprit; and pre-
sently she fires a gun as a signal of distress; the wea-
ther was pretty good, wind at N. N. W. a fresh gale,
and we soon came to speak with her.
We found her a ship of Bristol bound home from
Barbadocs, but had been blown out of the road at
Barbadoes, a few days before she was ready to sail, by
a terrible hurricane, while the captain and chief mate
were both gone on shore; so that beside the terror of
the storm, they were but in an indifferent case for
good artists to bring the ship home; they had been
already nine weeks at sea, and had met with another
terrible
terrible storm after the hurricane was over, which
had blown them quite out of their knowledge to the
westward, and in which they had lost their masts, as
above; they told us, they expected to have seen the
Bahama islands, but were then driven away again to
the south-east by a strong gale of wind at N. N. W.
the same that blew now, and having no sails to work
the ship with, but a main-course, and a kind of
square sail upon a jury fore-mast, which they had set
np, they could not lie near the wind, but were en-
deavouring to stand away for the Canaries.
But that which was worst of all, was, that they
were almost starved for want of provisions, besides
the fatigues they had undergone; their bread and
flesh was quite gone, they had not an ounce left in
the ship, and had had none for eleven days; the
only relief they had, was, their water was not all
spent, and they had about half a barrel of Hour left;
they had sugar enough; some succades or sweet-meats
they had at first, but they were devoured, and they
had seven casks of rum.
There was a youth and his mother, and a maid-ser-
vant, on board, who were going passengers, and
thinking the ship was ready to sail, unhappily came
on board the evening before the hurricane began;
and, having no provisions of their own left, they
were in a more deplorable condition than the rest;
for the seamen, being reduced to such an extreme
necessity themselves, had no compassion, we may be
sure, for the poor passengers; and they were indeed
in a condition that their misery is very hard to
describe
I had
I had perhaps not known this part, if my curiosity-
had not led me, the weather being sair, and the wind
abated, to go on board the ship: the second mate,
who upon this occasion commanded the ship, had
been on board our flup; and he told me indeed,
that they had three passengers in the great cabbin, that
they were in a deplorable condition; nay, says he, I
believe they are dead, for I have heard nothing of
them for above two days; and I was afraid to en-
quire after them, said he, for I had nothing to relieve
them with.
We immediately applied ourselves to give them what
relief we could spare; and indeed I had so sar over-
ruled things with my nephew, that I would have
victualled them, though we had gone away to Ver-
gir.ia, or any part of the coast of America, to have
supplied ourselves; but there was no necessity for
that.
But now they were in a new danger; for they were
afraid of eating two much, even of that little we
gave them; the mate or commander brought six men
with him in his boat; but these poor wretches looked
like skeletons, and were so weak, they could hardly
sit to their oars: the mate himself was very ill, and
half-starved; for he declared he had reserved nothing
from the men, and went share and share alike with
them in every bit they eaL
I cautioned him to eat sparingly, but set meat be-
fore him immediately, and he had not eaten three
mouthfuls before he began to be sick, and out of
order; so he stopt awhile, and our surgeon mixed
him up something with some broth, which he said
would be to him both food and physick; and after
he
he had taken It, he grew better: in the mean time
I forgot not the men; I ordered victuals to be given
them, and the poor creatures rather devoured than
eat it; they were so exceeding hungry, that they
were in a manner ravenous, and had no command
of themselves; and two of them eat with so much
greediness, that they were in danger of their lives
the next morning.
The sight of these people's distress was very moving
to me, and brought to mind what I had a terrible
prospect of at my first coming on shore in my island,
where I had not the least mouthful of food, or any
hopes of procuring it; besides the hourly apprehen-
sion I had of being made the food of other creatures.
But all the while the mate was thus relating to me
the miserable condition of the ship's company, I
could not put out of my thought the story he had
told me of the three poor creatures in the great cabbin;
(viz.) the mother, her son, and the maid servant,
whom he had heard nothing of for two or three days;
and whom he seemed to confess they had wholly neg-
lected, their own extremities being so great; by
which I understood, that they had really given them
no food at all; and that therefore they must be
perished, and be all lying dead perhaps on the floor
or deck of the cabbin.
As I therefore kept the mate, whom we then cal-
led captain, on board with his men to refresh them,
so I also forgot not the starving crew that were left on
board, but ordered my own boat to go on board the
ship, and with my mate and twelve men to carry
them a sack of bread, and four or five pieces of beef
to boil. Our surgeon charged the men to cause the
meat
meat to be boiled while they stayed, and to keep
guard in the cook-room, to prevent the men's taking
it to eat raw, or taking it out of the pot before it
was well boiled, and then to give every man but a
little at a time; and by this caution he preserved the
men, who would otherwise have killed themselves
with that very food that was given them on purpose
to save their lives.
At the fame time, I ordered the mate to go into
the great cabbin, and see in what condition the poor
passengers were in, and, if they were alive, to com-
fort them and give them what refreshment was pro-
per; and the surgeon gave him a large pitcher with
some of the prepared broth which he had given the
mate that was on board, and which he did not ques-
tion would restore them gradually.
I was not satisfied with this; but, as I said above,
having a great mind to see the scene of misery, which
I knew the snip itself would present me with, in a
more lively manner than I could have it by report, I
took the captain of the ship, as we now called him,
with me, and went myself a little after in their
boat.
I found the poor men on board almost in a tumult
to get the victuals out of the boiler before it was
ready: but my mate observed his order, and kept a
good guard at the cock-room door; and the man he
placed there, after using all possible persuasion to
have patience, kept them off by force: however, he
caused some biscuit cakes.to be dipped in the pot,
and softened them with the liquor of the meat, which
they call brewis, and gave them every one one, to
stay their stomachs, and told them it was for their
own
own safety, that he was obliged to give them but
little at a time. But it was all in vain, and had I
not come on board, and their own commander and
officers with me, and with good words, and some
threats also of giving them no more, I believe they
would have broke into the cook-room by force, and
tore the meat out of the furnace; for words indeed
are of a very small force to an hungry belly: however
we pacified them, and fed them gradually and
cautiously for the first time, and the next time gave
them more, and at last silled their bellies, and the
men did well enough.
But the misery of the poor passengers in the cabbin
was of another nature, and sar beyond the rest; for
as, first, the ship's company had so little for them-
selves, it was but too true, that they had at first kept
them very low, and at last totally neglected them;
so that for six or seven days, it might be said, they
had really had no food at all, and for several days
before, very little.
The poor mother, who, as the first mate reported,
was a woman of good fense, and good breeding, had
spared all she could get so affectionately for her son,
that at last she entirely sunk under it: and when the
mate of our ship went in, she set upon the floor or
deck, with her back up against the sides, between
two chairs, which were lashed sast, and her head
sunk in between her shoulders, like a corpse, though
not quite dead. My mate said all he could to revive
and encourage her, and with a spoon put some broth
into her mouth; she opened her lips, and lifted up
one hand, but could not speak: yet she understood
what he said, and made signs to him, intimating,
that
t
that it was too late for her; but pointed to her child,
as if she would have said, they should take care of
him.
However the mate, who was exceedingly moved
with the sight, endeavoured to get some of the broth
into her mouth; and, as he said, got two or three
spoonfuls down, though I question whether he could
be sure of it or not: but it was too late, and she
died the same night.
The youth, who was preserved at the price of his
most affectionate mother's life, was not so sar gone;
yet he lay in a cabin-bed as one stretched out, with
hardly any life left in him; he had a piece of an old
glove in his mouth, having eaten up the rest of it;
however, being young, and having more strength
than his mother, the mate got something down his
throat, and he began sensibly to revive, though, by
giving him some time after but two or three spoon-
fuls extraordinary, he was very sick, and brought
it up again*
But the next care was the poor maid; she lay all
along upon the deck hard by her mistress, and just
like one that had sallen down with an apoplexy, and
struggled for life: hei limbs were distorted, one of her
hands was clasped round the frame of one chair, and
Ihe griped it so hard, that we could not easily make
her let it go; her other arm lay over her head, and
her feet lay both together, set sast against the frame
of the cabin-table; in short, she lay just like one in
the last agonies of death; and yet she was alive too.
The poor creature was not only starved with
hunger, and terrified with the thoughts of death,
but, as the men told us afterwards, was broken-
Vol. II. D hearted
hearted for her mistress, whom she saw dying two
or three days before, and whom she loved most
tenderly.
We knew not what to do with this poor girl; for
when our surgeon, who was a man of very great
knowledge and experience, and with great applica-
tion recovered her as to life, he had her upon his
hand as to her fenses, for Ike was little less than
distracted for a considerable time after; as snall ap-
pear presently.
Whoever shall read these memorandums, must be
desired to consider, that visits at sea are not like a
journey into the country, where sometimes people
stay a week or a fortnight at a place. Our business
was to relieve this distressed ship's crew, but not lie
by for them; and though they were willing to steer
the same course with us for some days, yet we could
carry no sail to keep pace with a ship that had no
masts: however, as their captain begged of us to
help him to set up a main top-mast, and a kind of
top-mast to his jury fore-mast, we did, as it were,
lie by him for three or four days, and then having
given him five barrels of beef and pork, two hogsheads
of biscuit, and a proportion of peas, flour, and what
other things we could spare; and taking three casks
of sugar and some rum, and some pieces of eight of
them for satisfaction, we left them, taking on board
with us, at their own earnest request, the youth, and
the maid, and all their goods.
The young lad was about seventeen years of ager
a pretty, well-bred, modest, and sensible youth;
greatly dejected with the loss of his mother, and, as
it seems, had lost his sather but a few months before
at
at Barbadoes. He begged of the surgeon to speak to
me, to take him out of the ship; for he said, the
cruel fellows had murdered his mother; and indeed
so they had, that is to say, passively; for they might
have spared a small sustenance to the poor helpless
widow, that might have preserved her life, though
it had been just to keep her alive. But hunger knows
no friend, no relation, no justice, no right; and
therefore is remorseless, and capable of no com-
passion.
The surgeon told him how far we were going, and
how it would carry him away from all his friends,
and put him perhaps in as bad circumstances, almost,
as we found them in; that is to say, starving in the
world. He said he mattered not whither he went,
if he was but delivered from the terrible crew that
he was among: that the captain (by which he meant
me, for he could know nothing of my nephew) had
saved his life, and he was sure would not hurt him;
and as for the maid, he was sure, if she came to
herself, she would be very thankful for it, let us
carry them whither we would. The surgeon repre-
sented the case so affectionately to me, that I yielded,
and we took them both on board with all their goods,
except eleven hogsheads of sugar, which could not
be removed, or come at; and as the youth had a
bill of lading for them, I made his commander sign
a writing, obliging him to go, as soon as he came to
Bristol, to one Mr. Rogers, a merchant there, to
whom the youth said he was related, and to deli-
ver a letter which I wrote to him, and all the goods
he had belonging to the deceased widow; which I
suppose was not done; for I could never learn that
D 2 the
the ship came to Bristol; but was, as is most probj*
ble, lost at sea, being in so disabled a condition, and
so sar from any land, that I am of opinion, the first
storm she met with afterwards she might founder in
the sea; for she was leaky, and had damage in her
hold when I met with her.
I was now in the latitude of 19 deg. 32 min. and
had hitherto had a tolerable voyage as to weather,
tho' at sirst the winds had been contrary. I shall
trouble nobody with the little incidents of wind,
weather, currents, &c. on the rest of our voyage;
but, shortening my story for the sake of what is to
follow, shall observe, that I came to my old habitation,
the island, on the 10th of April, 1695. It was with
no small difficulty that I found the place; for as I
came to it, and went from it before, on the south
and east side of the island, as coming from the Brasils,
so now coming in between the main and the island,
and having no chart for the coast, nor any land-
mark, I did not know it when I saw it, or know
whether 1 saw it or no.
We beat about a great while, and went on shore
on several islands in the mouth of the great river
Orootwque, but none for my purpose; only this I
learned by my coasting the shore, that I was under
one great mistake before, viz. that the continent
which I thought I saw from the island I lived in,
was really no continent, but a long island, or rather
a ridge of islands reaching from one to the other side
of the extended mouth of that great river; and that
the savages who came to my island, were not pro-
perfy those which we call Caribee*, but islanders, and
other Barbarians of the same kind, who inhabited
something nearer to our side than the rest.
In
In short, I visited several of the islands to no pur-
pose; some I found were inhabited, and seme were
not. On one of them I found some Spaniards, and
thought they had lived there; but speaking with
them, found they had a sloop lay in a small creek
hard by, and that they came thither to make salt,
and catch some pearl-muscles, if they could; but
they belonged to the IJJe de Trinidad, which lay sar-
ther north, in the latitude of loand n degrees.
Thus coasting from one island to another, some-
times with the ship, sometimes with the Frenchman's
shallop (which we had found a convenient boat, and
therefore kept her with their very good will), at
length I came sair on the south-side of my island, and
I presently knew the very countenance of the place;
so I brought the ship safe to an anchor, broadside
with the little creek where was my old habitation.
As soon as I saw the place, I called for Friday,
and asked him, if he knew where he was? He looked
about a little, and presently clapping his hands, cri-
ed, O yes, O there, O yes, O there! pointing to
our old habitation, and fell a dancing and capering
like a mad fellow; and I had much ado to keep him
from jumping into the sea, to swim ashore to the
place.
Well, Friday, said I, do you think we shall sind
any body here, or no? and what do you think, shall
we see your sather? The fellow stood mute as a stock
a good while; but when I named his sather, the
poor affectionate creature looked dejected; and I
could fee the tears run down his sace very plentifully.
"What is the matter Friday, said I? are you troubled
because you may see your sather f No, no, says he,
D 3 shaking
shaking his head, no fee him more, no ever more
fee again. Why so, said I, Friday? how do you
know that? O no, O no, says Friday., he long ago
die; long ago, he much old man. Well, well, said
I, Friday, you don't know: but mall we fee any
one else then: the fellow, it seems, had better eyes
than I, and he points just to the hill above my old
house; and tho' we lay half a league off, he cries out,
Me see! me fee! yes, yes, me see much man there,
and there, and there. I looked, but I could fee no-
body, no, not with a perspective glass; which was,
I suppose, because I could not hit the place; for the
fellow was right, as I found upon enquiry the next
clay, and there were five or six men altogether stood
to look at the ship, not knowing what to think
of us.
As soon as Friday had told me he saw people, I
caused the English ancient to be spread, and fired three
guns, to give them notice we were friends; and
about half a quarter of an hour after, we perceived a
smoke rife from the side of the creek; so I imme-
diately ordered a boat out, taking Friday with me;
and, hanging out a white slag, or a flag of truce, I
went directly on snore, taking with me the young
friar I mentioned, to whom I had told the whole
story of my living there, and the manner of it, and
every particular, both of myself, and those that I
left there; and who was on that account extremely
defirous to go with me. We had besides about six-
teen men very well armed, if we had found any new
guest there which we did not know of; but we had
no need of weapons.
As we went on shore upon the tide of flood, near
high water, we rowed directly into the creek; and
the
39
The sirst man I fixed my eye upon, was the Spaniard
'whose life I had saved, and whom I knew by his face
perfectly well; as to his habit, I sha'.l describe it
afterwards. I ordered nobody to go on shore at first
but myself; but there was no keeping Friday in the
boat: for the affectionate creature had spied his
father at a distance, a good way off of the Spaniards,
where indeed I saw nothing of him; and if they had
not let him go on more, he would have jumped into
the sea. He was no sooner on shore, but he flew
awav to his sather like an arrow out of a bow. It
would have made any man shed tears, in spite of the
firmest resolution, to have seen the first transports of
this poor fellow's joy, when he came to his sather;
how he embraced him, kissed him, streaked his sace,
took him up in his arms, set him down upon a tree,
and lay down by him; then stood and looked at him
as any one would look at a strange picture, for a
quarter of an hour together; then lay down upon
the ground, and streaked his legs, and kissed them,
and then got up again, and stared at him; one would
have thought the fellow bewitched: but it would
have made a dog laugh to fee how the next day his
passion run out another way: in the morning he
walked along the shore, to and-again, with his sather,
several hours, always leading him by the hand, as if
he had been a lady; and every now-and-then would
come to fetch something or other for him from the
boat, either a lump of sugar, or a dram, a biscuit, or
something or other that was good. In the afternoon his
frolics ran another way, for then he would set the old
man down upon the ground, and dance about him,
and made a thousand antic postures and gestures; and
D 4 ' all
all the while he did this, he would be talking to him,
and telling him one story or another of his travels,
and of what had happened to him abroad, to divert
him. In short, if the same filial affection was to be
found in christians to their parents, in our parts of
the world, one would be tempted to say, there hard-
ly would have been any need of the fifth command-
ment.
But this is a digression; I return to my landing.
It would be endless to take notice of all the ceremo-
nies and civilities that the Spaniards received me with*
The first Spaniard, whom, as I said, I knew very well
was he whose life I saved, he came towards the boat,
attended by one more, carrying a flag of truce also;
and he did not only not know me at first, but he had
no thoughts, no notion, of its being me that was
come, till I spoke to him: Seignor, said I, in Portu-
guese, do you not know me? at which he spoke not
a word; but giving his musquet to the man that was
with him, threw his arms abroad, and saying some-
thing in Spanish, that I did not perfectly hear, came
forward, and embraced me, telling me, he was inex-
cusable not to know that sace again that he had
once seen, as of an angel from Heaven sent to save
his life: hesaid abundance of very handsome things,
as a well-bied Spaniard always knows how; and
then beckoning to the person that attended him, bade
him go and call out his comrades. He then asked
me, if I would walk to my old habitation, where
he would give me possession of my own house
again, and where I should see there had been but
mean improvements; so I walked along with him j
but, alas! I could no more find the place again, than
Is I had never been there; for they had planted so
many trees, and placed them in such a posture, so
thick and close to one another, in ten years time
they were grown so big, that, in short, the place was
inaccessible, except by such windings and blind ways,
as they themselves only who made them could sind.
I asked them, what put them upon all these forti-
sications? Me told me, I would say there was need
enough of it, when they had given an account how
they had pasted their time since their arriving in the
island, especially aster they had the misfortune to find
that I was gone: he told me he could not but have
some satissaction in my good fortune, when he heard
that I was gone in a good ship, and to my satissaction;
and that he had oftentimes a strong persuasion, that
one time or other he should see me again: but no-
thing that ever befel him in his life, he said, was so
surprising and afflicting to him at first, as the disap-
pointment he was under when he came back to the
island, and found I was not there.
As to the three Barbarians (so he called them) that
were left behind, and of whom he said he had a long
story to tell me; the Spaniards all thought themselves
much better among the savages, only that their
number was so small. And, says he, had they been
strong enough, we had been all long ago in purga-
tory; and with that he crossed himself upon the
breast. But Sir, says he, I hope you will not be
displeased, when I shall tell you how, forced by
necessity, we were obliged, for our own preservation,
to disarm them, and making them our subjects, who
would not be content with being moderately our
masters, but would be our murderers. I answered, I
was
was heartily afraid of it when I left them there;' and!
nothing troubled me at my parting from the island,
but that they were not come back, that,I might have
put them in possession of every thing first, and left the
other in a state of subjection, as they deserved: but
if they had reduced them to it, I was very glad, and
should be very sar from finding any sault with it;
for I knew they were a parcel of refractory ungo-
vernable villains, and were fit for any manner of
mischief.
While I was saying this, came the man whom he
had sent back, and with him eleven men more: in
the dress they were in, it was impossible to guess what
nation they were of; but he made all clear both to
them and to me. First he turned to me, and pointing
to them, said, These, Sir, are some of the gentlemen
who owe their lives to you; and then turning to
them, and pointing to me, he let them know who I
wasupon which they all came up one by one, not
as if they had been sailors, and ordinary fellows, and
I the like, but really, as if they had been ambassa-
dors or noblemen, and I a monarch, or a great con-
queror: their behaviour was to the last degree
obli'nnc: and courteous, and vet mixed with a manly
majestic gravity, which very well became them; and
in short, they had so much more manners than I,
that I scarce knew how to receive their civilities,
much less how to return them in kind.
The history of their coming to, and conduct in
the island, after my going away, is so remarkable,
and has so many incidents, which the former part of
mv relation will help to understand, and which will,
in most of the particulars, refer to that account I have
already
already given, that I cannot but commit them with
great delight to the reading of those that come after
me.
I mall no longer trouble the story with a relation
in the first person, which will put me to the expence
of ten thousand said I's, and laid he's, and he told
me's, and I told him's, and the like; .but I mall
collect the sacts historically, as near as I can gather
them out of my memory from what they related to
me, and from what I met with in my conversing with
them, and with the place.
In order to do this succinctly, and as intelligibly as
I can, I must go back to the circumstance in which
I left the island, and which the persons were in, of
whom I am to speak. At first, it is necessary to re-
peat, that I had sent away Friday's sather and / the
Spaniard, the two whose lives I had rescued from the
savages; I say, I had sent them away in a large canoe
to the main, as I then thought it, to fetch over
the Spaniard's companions whom he had left behind
him, in order to save them from the like calamity
that he had been in; and in order to succour
them for the present, and that, if possible, we might
together find "some way fer our deliverance after-
ward.
When I sent them away, I had no visible appear-
ance of, cr the least room to hope for, my own de-
liverance, any more than I had twenty years before;
much less had I any foreknowledge of what after hap-
pened, I mean of an English ship coming on shore
there to fetch them off; and it could not but be a
very great surprise to them, when they came back,
pot only to find that I was gone, but to find three
strangers
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
strangers left on the spot, possessed of all that I had1
left behind me, which would otherwise have been
their own.
The first thing, however, which I enquired into,
that I might begin where I left off, was of their own
part: and I defired he would give me a particular
account of his voyage back to his countrymen with
the boat, when I sent him to fetch them over. He
told me there was little variety in that part; for no-
thing remarkable happened to them on the way, they
having very calm weather, and a smooth sea; for his
countrymen, it could not be doubted, he said, but
that they were overjoyed to see him (it seems he
was the principal man among them, the captain of
the vessel they had been shipwrecked in, having been
dead some time): they were, he said, the more sur-
prised to see him, because they knew that he was sal-
len into the hands of savages, who, they were satisfied,
would devour him, as they did all the rest of their
prisoners; that when he told them the story of the
deliverance, and in what manner he was furnished
for carrying them away, it was like a dream to them:
and t'.icir astonishment, they said, was something like
that of Joseph's brethren, when he told them who he
was, and told them the story of his exaltation in
Pharaoh's court: but when he shewed them the arms,
the powder, the ball, and the provisions that he
brought them for their journey or voyage, they were
restored to themselves, took a just mare of the joy of
their deliverance, and immediately prepared to come
away with him.
Their first business was to get canoes; and in this
they were obliged not to stick so much upon the
honest
honest part of it, but to trespass upon their friendly.
savages, and to borrow two large canoes or periagua's,
on pretence of going out a.fishing, or for pleasure.
In these they came away the next morning; it
seems they wanted no time to get themselves ready,
for they had no baggage, neither clothes, or provi-
sions, or any thing in the world, but what they had
on them, and a few roots to eat, of which they used
to make their bread.
They were in all three weeks absent, and in that
time, unluckily for them, I had the occasion offered
for my escape, as I mentioned in my other part, and
to get off from the island; leaving three of the most
impudent, hardened, ungoverned, disagreeable villains
behind me, that any man could defire to meet with,.
to the poor Spaniards great grief and disappointment,
you may be sure.
The only just thing the rogues did, was, that when
the Spaniards came on shore, they gave my letter to
them, and gave them provisions, and other relief, as
I had ordered them to do; also they gave them the
long paper of directions, which I had left with them,
containing the particular methods which I took for
managing every part of my life there; the way how I
baked my bread, bred up my tame goats, and plant-
ed my corn; how I cured my grapes, made my pots,
and, in a word, every thing I did; all this being
written down, they gave to the Spaniards, two of
whom understood Englislj well enough; nor did they
refuse to accommodate the Spaniards with any thing
else, for they agreed very well for some time; they
gave them an equal admission into the house, or cave,
and they began to live very sociably; and the head
Spaniard,
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
Spaniard, who had seen pretty much of my methods
and Friday's sather together, managed all their affairs,
for, as for the Englishmen, they did nothing but ram-
ble about the island, shoot parrots, and catch tortoises,
and when they came home at night, the Spaniards
provided their suppers for them.
The Spaniards would have been satisfied with this,
would the other but have left them alone; which,
however, they could not find in their hearts to do
long; but, like the dog in the manger, they would
not eat themselves, and would not let others eat
neither: the differences, nevertheless, were at first
but trivial, and such as are not worth relating; but
at last it broke out into open war, and it began with
all the rudeness and infolsnce that can be imagined,
without reason, without provocation, contrary to
nature, and indeed to common fense; and though,
it is true, the first relation or it came from the
Spaniards themselves, whom I may call the accusers,
yet when I came to examine the fellows, they could
not deny a word of it.
But before I come to the particulars of this part,
I must supply a defect in my former relation; and
this was, that I forgot to set down among the rest,
that, just as we were weighing the anchor to set sail,
there happened a little quarrel on board our ship,
which I was afraid once would turn to a second mu-
tiny; nor was it appeased till the captain, rousing
up his courage, and taking us all to his assistance,
parted them by force, and making two of the most
refractory fellows prisoners, he laid them in irons;
and as they had been active in the former disorders,
and let fall some up'y dangerous words the second
time,
47
time, he threatened to carry them in irons to Eng-
land, and have them hanged there for mutiny, and
running away with the ship.
This, it seems, though the captain did net intend
to do, it frighted some other men in the ship; and
some of them had put it in the heads of the rest, that
the captain only gave them good words for the pre-
sent, till they should come to some English port; and
that then they mould be all put into a gaol, and tried
for their lives.
The mate got intelligence of this, and acquainted
us with it; upon which it was defired, that I, who
still passed for a great man among them, mould go
down with the mate, and satisfy the men, and tell
them, that they might be assured, if they behaved
well the rest of the voyage, all they had done for the
time past should be pardoned. So I went, and after
passing my honour's word to them, they appeared
easy, and the more so, when I caused the two men,
who were in irons, to be released and forgiven.
But this mutiny had brought us to an anchor for
that night, the wind also salling calm; next morning
we found, that our two men who had been laid in
irons, had stole each of them a musket, and some
other weapons; what powder or shot they had, we
knew not; and had taken the ship's pinnace, which
was not yet haled up, and run away with her to their
companions in roguery on more.
As soon as we found this, I ordered the long-boat
on more, with twelve men and the mate, and away
they went to feck the rogues; but they could neither
find them, nor any of the rest; for they all fled into
the woods, when they saw the boat coming on shore.
The
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
The mate was once resolved, in justice to their
roguery, to have destroyed their plantations, burnt
all their household-stuff and furniture, and left them
to shift without it; but having no order, he let all
alone, lest every thing as they found it, and bringing
the pinnace away, came on board without them.
These two men made their number five; but the
other three villains were so much wickeder than
these, that after they had been two or three days
together, they turned their two new-comers out of
doors to shift for themselves, and would have nothing
to do with them; nor could they, for a good while,
be persuaded to give them any food; as for the Spa-
niards, they were not yet come.
When the Spaniards came first on shore, the busi-
ness began to go forward; the Spaniards would have
persuaded the three English brutes to have taken in
their two countrymen again, that, as they said, they
might be all one samily; but they would not hear of
it: so the two poor fellows lived by themselves, and
finding nothing but industry and application would
make them live comfortable, they pitched their tents
on the north shore of the'island, but a little more to
the west, to be out of the danger of the savages, who
always landed on the east parts of the island.
Here they built two huts, one to lodge in, and
the other to lay up their magazines and stores in;
and the Spaniards having given them some corn for
feed, and especially some of the peas w hich I had left
them, they dug and planted, and inclosed, after the
pattern I had set for them all, and began to live pretty
well; their first crop of corn was on the ground,
.and though it was but a little bit of land which
they
they had dug up at sirst, having had but a little time,
yet it was enough to relieve them, and find them
with bread or other eatables; and one of the fellows,
being the cook's mate of the ship, was very ready at
making soup, puddings, and such other preparations,
as the rice and the milk, and such little slesh as they
got, furnished him to do.
They were going on in a little thriving posture,
when the three unnatural rogues, their own country-
men too, in mere humour, and to insult them, came
and bullied them, and told them the island was
theirs; that the governor, meaning me, had given
them possession of it, and nobody else had any right
to it; and, damn them, they should build no houses
upon their ground, unless they would pay them rent
for them.
The two men thought they had jested at first; and
asked them to come and sit down, and fee what sine
houses they were that they had built, and tell them
what rent they demanded: and one of them merrily
told them, if they were ground-landlords, he hoped
if they built tenements upon the land, and made im-
provements, they would, according to the custom of
all landlords, grant them a long lease; and bid them
go fetch a scrivener to draw the writings. One of
the three, damning and raging, told them, they
should fee they were not in jest; and going to a little
place at a distance, where the honest men had made
a fire to dress their victuals, he takes a fire-brand,
and claps it to the outside of their hut, and very
sairly set it on fire; and it would have been all burnt
down in a few minutes, if one of the two had not
run to the fellow, thrust him away, and trod the fire
OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 49
out w ith his feet, and that not without some difficult
ty too.
The fellow was in such a rage at the honest man's
thrusting him away, that he turned upon him with
a pole he had in his hand; and had not the man
avoided the blow very nimbly, and run into the hut,
he had ended his days at once. His comrade, see-
ing the danger they were both in, ran in after him,
and immediately they came both out with their mus-
kets; and the man that was first struck at with the
pole, knocked the fellow down, who began the
quarrel, with the stock of his musquet, and that
before the other two could come to lvJp him; and
then seeing the rest come at them, they stood toge-
ther, and presenting the other ends of their pieces to
them, bade them stand off.
The others had fire-arms with them too; but one
of the two honest men, bolder than his comrade, and
made desperate by his danger, told them, if they
offered to move hand or foot, they were all dead men;
and boldly commanded them to lay down their arms.
They did not indeed lay down their arms; but, see-
ing him resolute, it brought them to a parley, and
they consented to take their wounded man with them,
and be gone; and indeed, it seems the fellow was
wounded sufficiently with the blow; however, they
were much in the wrong, since they had the advan-
tage, that they did not disarm them effectually, as
they might have done, and have gone immediately
to the Spaniards, and given them an account how
the rogues had treated them; for the three villains
studied nothing but revenge, and every day gave
them some intimation that they did so.
But
51
But not to crowd this part with an account of the
lesser part of their rogueries, such as treading down
their corn, shooting three young kids, and a she-
goat, which the poor men had got to breed up tame
for their store; and, in a word, plaguing them night
and day in this manner, it forced the two men to
such a desperation, that they resolved to fight them
all three the sirst time they had a sair opportunity.
In order to this they resolved to go to the castle, as
they called it, that was my old dwelling, where the
three rogues and the Spaniards all lived together at
that time, intending to have a sair battle, and the
Spaniards should stand by to see sair play. So they
got up in the morning before day, and came to the
place, and called the Englifimcn by their names, tel-
ling a Spaniard that answered, that they wanted to
speak with them.
It happened that the day before two of the Spa-
niards, having been in the woods, had seen one of
the two Englishmen, whom, for distinction, I call the
honest men; and he had made a sad complaint to
the Spatiiards, of the barbarous usage they had met
with from their three countrymen, and how they had
ruined their plantation, and destroyed their corn,
that they had laboured so hard to bring forward, and
killed the milch-goat, and their .three kids, which
was all they had provided for their sustenance; and
that if he and his friends, meaning the Spaniards,
did not assist them again, they should be starved.
When the Spaniards came home at night, and they
were all at supper, he took the freedom to reprove
the three Englishmen, though in gentle and mannerly
terms, and asked them, how they could be so cruel,
E 2 they
they being harmless inoffensive fellows, and that they
were putting themselves in a way to subsist by their
labour, and that it had cost them a great deal of pains
to bring things to such perfection as they had?
One of the Englishmen returned very briskly, What
had they to do there? That they came on shore with-
out leave, and that they should not plant or build
upon the island; it was none of their ground. Why,
says the Spaniard, very calmly, Seignior Ingle/e, they
must not starve. The Englishman replied, like a true
rough-hewn tarpaulin, they might starve and be damn-
ed, they should not plant nor build in that place.
But what must they do then, Seignior? says the Spa-
niard. Another of the brutes returned, Do! d—n
them, they should be servants, and work for them.
But how can you expect that of them? they are
not bought with your money; you have no right to
make them servants. The Englishman answered, The
island was theirs, the governor had given it to them,
and no man had any thing to do there but themselves;
and with that swore by his Maker, that he would go
and burn all their new huts; they should build none
upon their land.
Why Seignior, says the Spaniard, by the same
rule, we must be your servants too. Ay, says the
bold" dog, and so you shall too, before we have done
with you, mixing two or three G—d d—mme's in
the proper intervals of his speech. The Spaniard
only smiled at that, and made him no answer. How-
ever, this little discourse had heated them; and
starting up, one says to the other, I think it was he
they called Will Atkins, Come Jack, let us go and
have the other brush with them; we will demolish
their
53
their castle, I will warrant you; they shall plant no
colony in our dominions.
Upon this they were all trooping away, with
every man a gun, a pistol, and a sword, and mut-
tered some insolent things among themselves, of
what they would do to the Spaniards too, when op-
portunity offered; but the Spaniards, it seems, did
not so perfectly understand them as to know all the
particulars; only that, in general, they threatened
them hard for taking the two Englishmen's part.
Whither they went, or how they bestowed their
time that evening, the Spaniards said they did not
know; but it seems they wandered about the country
part of the night; and then lying down in the place
which I used to call my bower, they were weary, and
overslept themselves. The case was this: they had
resolved to stay till midnight, and so to take the
poor men when they were afleep; and they acknow-
ledged it afterwards, intending to set fire to their
huts while they were in them, and either burn them
in them, or murder them as they came out: and,
as malice seldom sleeps very sound, it was very strange
they should not have been kept waking.
However, as the two men had also a design upon
them, as I have said, tho' a much sairer one than
that of burning and murdering, it happened, and
very luckily for them all, that they were up and
gone abroad, before the bloody-minded rogues came
to their huts.
When they came thither and found the men gone,
Atkins, who it seems was the forwardest man, called
out to his comrades, Ha! Jack, here's the nest; but
d—n them, the birds are flown: they mused a while
E 3 to
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
to think what should be the occasion of their being
gone abroad so soon, and suggested presently, that
the Spaniards had given them notice of it; and with
that they shook hands, arid swore to one another,
that they would be revenged of the Spaniards. As
soon as they had made this bloody bargain, they fell
to work with the poor men's habitation; they did
not set fire indeed to any thing, but they pulled down
both their houses, and pulled them so limb from limb
that they left not the least stick standing, or scarce
any sign on the ground where they stood; they tore
all their little collected household-stuff in pieces, and
threw every thing about in such a manner, that the
poor men found, afterwards, some of their things
a mile off" from their habitation.
When they had done this, they pulled up all the
young trees which the poor men had planted; pulled
up the inclosure they had made to secure their cattle
and their corn; and, in a word, sacked and plun-
dered every thing, as completely as a herd of Tartars
would have done.
The two men were at this juncture gone to find
them out, and had resolved to sight them wherever
they had been, tho' they were but two to three: so
that, had they met, there certainly would have been
bloodshed among them; for they were all very stout,
resolute fellows, to give them their due.
But Providence took more care to keep them
asunder, than they themselves could do to meet: for,
as they had dogged one another, when the three were
gone thither, the two were here; and afterwards,
when the two went back to find them, the three were
come to the old habitation again; we shall see their
differing
55
differing conduct presently. When the three came
back, like furious creatures, flushed with the rage
which the work they had been about put them into,
they came up to the Spaniards, and told them what
they had done, by way of scoff and bravado; and
one of them stepping up to one of the Spaniards, as
if they had been a couple of boys at play, takes hold
of his hat, as it was upon his head, and giving it a
twirl about, fleering in his sace, says he to him, And
you, Seignior Jack Spaniard, shall have the same
sauce, if you do not mend your manners. The Spa-
niard who, though quite a civil man, was as brave
as a man could desire to be, and withal a strong
well-made man, looked steadily at him for a good
while; and then, having no weapon in his hand,
slept gravely up to him, and with one blow of his
fist, knocked him down, as an ox is felled with a
pole-axe, at which one of the rogues, insolent as the
first, fired his pistol at the Spaniard immediately:
he miffed his body indeed, for the bullets went
through his hair, but one of them touched the tip
of his ear, and he bled pretty much. The blood
made the Spaniard believe he was more hurt than he
really was, and that put him into some heat, for be-
fore he acted all in a perfect calm; but now re-
solving to go through with his work, he stooped and
took the fellow's musquet whom he had knocked
down, and was just going to shoot the man who had
fired at him; when the rest of the Spaniards, being
in the cave, came out, and calling to him not to
shoot, they stept in, secured the other two, and took
their arms from them.
E 4 When
56
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
When they were thus disarmed, and found they
had made all the Spaniards their enemies, as well as
their own countrymen, they began to cool; and
giving the Spaniards better words, would have had
their arms again; but the Spaniards, considering the
feud that was between them and the other two English-
men, and that it would be the best method they could
take to keep them from one another, told them they
would do them no harm; and if they would live
peaceably they would be very willing to assist and
associate with them, as they did before; but that
they could not think of giving them their arms
again, while they appeared so resolved to do mis-
chief with them to their own countrymen, and had
even threatened them all to make them their
servants.
The rogues were now more capable to hear rea-
son than to act reason; but being refused their arms,
they went raving away, and raging like madmen,
threatening what they would do, though they had
no fire-arms: but the Spaniards despising their threat-
ening, told them they shouid take care how they
offered any injury to their plantation or cattle; for
if they did, they would shoot them, as they would
do ravenous beasts, wherever they found them; and
if they fell into their hands alive, they would cer-
tainly be hanged. However, this was sar from cool-
ing them; but away they went, swearing and raging
like furies of hell. As soon as they were gone, came
back the two men in passion and rage enough also,
though of another kind; for, having been at their
plantation, and finding it all demolished and destroy-
ed, as above, it will easily be supposed they had pro-
vocation
57
vocation enough; they could scarce have room to
tell their tale, the Spaniards were so eager to tell
them theirs; and it was strange enough to find, that
three men should thus bully nineteen, and receive no
punishment at all.
The Spaniards indeed despised them, and especially
having thus disarmed them, made light of their
threatenings; but the two Englishmen resolved to have
their remedy against them, what pains soever it cost
to find them out.
But the Spaniards interposed here too, and told
them, that they were already disarmed: they could
not consent that they (the two) should pursue them
with fire-arms, and perhaps kill them: but, said the
grave Spaniard, who was their governor, we will
endeavour to make them do you justice, if you will
leave it to us, for, as there is no doubt but they will
come to us again when their passion is over, being not
able to subsist without our assistance, we promise you
to make no peace with them, without having a full
satissaction for you ; and upon this condition we hope
you will promise to use no violence with them, other
than in your defence.
The two Englishmen yielded to this very awkwardly,
and with great reluctance; but the Spaniards pro-
tested, they did it only to keep them from bloodshed,
and to make all easy at last; for, said they, we are
not so many of us; here is room enough for us all,
and it is great pity we should not be all good friends.
At length they did consent, and waited for the issue
of the thing, living for some days with the Spaniards;
for their own habitation was destroyed.
In
In about five days time the three vagrants, tired
with wandering, and almost starved with hunger,
having chiefly lived on turtles eggs all that while,
came back to the grove; and finding my Spaniard,
who, as I have said, was the governor, and two
more with him, walking by the side of the creek;
they came up in a very submissive humble manner,
and begged to be received again into the family. The
Spaniards used them civilly, but told them, they had
acted so unnaturally by their countrymen, and so
very grossly by them (the Spaniards ), that they could
not come to any conclusion without consulting the
two Englishmen, and the rest; but however they
would go to them, and discourse about it, and they
should know in half an hour. It may be guessed
that they were very hard put to it; for it seems, as
they were to wait this half-hour for an answer, they
begged he would send them out some bread in the
mean time; which he did, and sent them at the same
time a large piece of goat's flesh, and a broiled par-
rot; which they eat very heartily, for they were
hungry enough.
After half an hour's consultation they were called
in, and a long debate had about them, their two
countrymen charging them with the ruin of all their
labour, and a design to murder them; all which they
owned before, and therefore could not deny now;
upon the whole, the Spaniards acted the moderators
between them; and as they had obliged the two
Englishmen not to hurt the three, while they were
naked and unarmed, so they now obliged the three
to go and rebuild their fellows two huts, one to be
of
of the same dimensions, and the other larger than
they were before ., also to fence their ground again,
where they had pulled up the fences, plant trees in
the room of those pulled up, dig up the land again
for planting corn, where they had spoiled it; and,
in a word, to restore every thing in the same state as
they found it, as near as they could; for entirely it
could not be, the season for the corn, and the growth
of the trees and hedges, not being possible to be
recovered.
Well, they all submitted to this; and as they
had plenty of provisions given them all the while,
they grew very orderly, and the whole society began
to live pleasantly and agreeably together again; only
that these three fellows could never be persuaded to
work; I mean, not for themselves, except now and
then a little, just as they pleased; however, the Spa-
niards told them plainly, that if they would but live
sociably and friendly together, and study in the whole
the good of the plantation, they would be content to
work for them, and let them walk about and be as
idle as they pleased; and thus having lived pretty
well together for a month or two, the Spaniards gave
them their arms again, and gave them liberty to go
abroad with them as before.
It was not above a week after they had these arms,
and went abroad, but the ungrateful creatures be-
gan to be as insolent and troublesome as before; but
however, an accident happened presently upon this,
which endangered the safety of them all; they were
obliged to lay by all private resentments, and look
to the preservation of their lives.
It

LIFE AND ADVENTURES
It happened one night, that the Spaniard governor,
as I call him, that is to say, the Spaniard whose
life I had saved, who was now the captain, or leader,
or governor of the rest, found himself very uneasy
in the night, and could by no means get any sleep:
he was perfectly well in body, as he told me the story,
only found his thoughts tumultuous; his mind ran
upon men fighting, and killing one another, but
was broad awake, and could not by any means get
any sleep; in short, he lay a great while; but grow-
ing more and more uneasy, he resolved to rise: as
they lay, being so many of them, upon goat-skins,
laid thick upon such couches and pads as they made
for themselves, and not in hammocks and ship-beds,
as I did, who was but one, so they had little to do,
when they were willing to rise, but to get up upon
their feet, and perhaps put on a coat, such as it was,
and their pumps, and they were ready for going any
way that their thoughts guided them.
Being thus gotten up, he looked out; but, being
dark, he could fee little or nothing; and besides,
the trees which I had planted, as in my former ac-
count is described, and which were now grevn tall,
intercepted his sight, so that he could only look up,
and see that it was a clear star-light night; and, hear-,
ing no noise, he returned and laid him down again;
but it was all one, he could not sleep, nor could he
compose himself to any thing like rest, but his
thoughts were to the last degree uneasy, and yet he
knew not for what.
Having made some noise with rising and walking
about, going out and coming in, another of them
waked,
waked, and, calling, asked who it was that was up?
The governor told him, how it had been with him.
Say you so? says the other Spaniard; such things are
not to be slighted, I assure you; there is certainly
some mischief working, says he, near us; and pre-
sently he asked him, Where are the Englishmen? They
are all in their huts, says he, safe enough. It seems,
the Spaniards had kept possession of the main apart-
ment, and had made a place, where the three Eng-
lisfjmen, since their last mutiny, always quartered by
themselves, and could not come at the rest. Well,
says the Spaniard, there is something in it, I am per-
suaded from my own experience; I am satisfied our
spirits embodied have converse with, and receive in-
telligence from, the spirits unembodied, and inhabit-
ing the invisible world; and this friendly notice is
given for our advantage, if we know how to make
use of it. Come, says he, let us go out and look
abroad; and if we find nothing at all in it to justify
our trouble, I'll tell you a story to the purpose,
that shall convince you of the justice of my pro-
posing it.
In a word, they went out to go to the top of
the hill, where I used to go; but they, being strong,
and in good company, nor alone, as I was, used
none of my cautions to go up by the ladder, and
then pulling it up after them, to go up a second stage
to the top, but were going round through the grove
unconcerned and unwary, when they were surprised
with seeing a light as of fire, a very little way off
from them, and hearing the voices of men, not of
one, or two, but of a great number.
In
62
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
In all the discoveries I had made of the savages
landing on the island, it was my constant care to
prevent them making the least discovery of there be-
ing any inhabitant upon the place; and when by
any necessity they came to know it, they felt it so
effectually, that they that got away, were scarce able
to give any account of it, for we disappeared as soon
as possible, nor did ever any that had seen me,
escape to tell any one else, except it were the three
savages in our last encounter, who jumped into the
boat, of whom I mentioned that I was afraid they
should go home, and bring more help.
Whether it was the consequence of the escape of
those men, that so great a number came now to-
gether; or whether they came ignorantly, and by.
accident, on their usual bloody errand, the Spaniards
could not it seems understand: but whatever it was,
it had been their business, either to have concealed
themselves, and not have seen them at all; much
less to have let the savages have seen, that there were
any inhabitants in the place; but to have sallen upon
them so effectually, as that not a man of them should
have escaped, which could only have been by getting
in between them and their boats; but this presence
of mind was wanting to them, w hich was the ruin of
their tranquillity, for a great while.
We need not doubt but that the governor, and
the man with him, surprised with this light, ran back
immediately, and raised their fellows, giving them
an account of the imminent danger they were all in;
and they again as readily took the alarm, but it was
impoffible to persuade them to stay close withirr* where
they
they were, but that they must all run out to see how
things stood.
While it was dark indeed, they were well enough,
and they had opportunity enough, for some hours, to
view them by the light of three fires they had made
at some distance from one another; what they were
doing they knew not, and what to do themselves they
knew not; for, first, the enemy were too many;
and, secondly, they did not keep together, but were
divided into several parties, and were on shore in
several places.
The Spaniards were in no small consternation at
this sight; and as they found that the fellows ran
straggling all over the shore, they made no doubt,
but, first or last, some of them would chop in upon
their habitation, or upon some other place, where
they would see the tokens of inhabitants; and they
were in great perplexity also for fear of their flock of
goats, which would have been little less than starving
them, if they should have been destroyed; so the
first thing they resolved upon, was to dispatch three
men away before it was light, viz. two Spaniards and
one Englishman, to drive all the goats away to the
great valley where the cave was, and, if need were,
to drive them into the very cave itself.
Could they have seen the savages altogether in
one body, and at a distance from their canoes, they
resolved, if there had been an hundred of them, to
have attacked them; but that could not be obtained,
for there were some of them two miles off from the
other, and, as it appeared afterwards, were of two
different nations.
After
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
After having mused a great while on the course
they should take, and beaten their brains in consi-
dering their present circumstances, they resolved at
last, while it was dark, to fend the old savage (Fri-
day's sather) out, as a spy, to learn, if possible, some-
thing concerning them, as what they came for, and
what they intended to do, and the like; the old
man readily undertook it, and, stripping himself
quite naked, as most of the savages were, away he
went: after he had been gone an hour or two, he
brings word, that he had been among them undisco-
vered, that he found they were two parties, and of
two several nations, who had war with one another
and had had a great battle in their own country, and
that both sides having had several prisoners taken in
the fight, they were by mere chance landed in the
same island, for the devouring their prisoners, and
making merry; but their coming so by chance to
the same place, had spoiled all their mirth; that they
were in a great rage at one another, and were so near,
that he believed they would sight again as soon as
day-light began to appear; but he did not perceive
that they had any notion of any body's being on the
ifland but themselves. He had hardly made an end
of telling the story, when they could perceive, by
the unusual noise they made, that the two little
armies were engaged in a bloody fight.
Friday's sather used all the arguments he could to
persuade our people to lie close, and not be seen; he
told them, their safety consisted in it, and that they
had nothing to do but to lie still, and the savages
would kill one another to their hands, and the rest
would
would go away; and it was so to a tittle. But it
was impossible to prevail, especially upon the Eng-
lishmen; their curiosity was so importunate upon
their prudentials, that they must run out and fee the
battle: however, they used some caution, viz. they
did not go openly just by their own dwelling, but
went sarther into the woods, and placed themselves
to advantage, where they might securely see them
manage the fight, and, as they thought, not to be
seen by them; but it seems the savages did fee
them, as we shall find hereafter.
The battle was very fierce, and if I might believe
the Englishmen, one of them said, he could perceive,
that some of them were men of great bravery, of
invincible spirits, and of great policy in guiding the
fight. The battle, they said, held two hours, before
they could guess which party would be beaten; but
then that party which was nearest our people's habita-
tion began to appear weakest, and after some time
more, some of them began to fly; and this put our
men again into a great consternation, lest any of
those' that fled should run into the grove, before their
dwelling, for shelter, and thereby involuntarily dis-
cover the place; and that by consequence the pur-
suers should do the like in search for them. Upon
this they resolved, that they would stand armed with-
in the wall, and whoever came into the grove, they
should sally out over the wall, and kill them; so
that, if possible, not one ssiould return to give an
account of it; they ordered also, that it should be
done with their swords, or by knocking them down
Vol. n. F with
66
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
with the stock of the musquet, not by shooting therri,
for fear of raising an alarm by the noise.
As they expected, it fell out; three of the routed
army fled for life, and crossing the creek, ran directly
into the place, not in the least knowing whither
they went, but running as into a thick wood for
shelter; the scout they kept to look abroad gave
notice of this within, with this addition, to our
men's great satissaction, viz. That the conquerors
had not pursued them, or seen which way they were
gone. Upon this the Spaniard governor, a man of
humanity, would not suffer them to kill the three
fugitives; but, sending three men out by the top of
the hill, ordered them to go found, and come in
behind them, surprise and take them prisoners, -which
was done; the residue of the conquered people fled
to their canoes, and got off to sea; the victors re-
tired, and made no pursuit, or very little; but, drawJ-
ing themselves into a body together, gave two great
screaming shouts, which they supposed were by way
of triumph, and so the fight ended: and the same
day, about three o'clock in the afternoon, they also
marched to their canoes. And thus the Spaniards
had their island again free to themselves, their fright
was over, and they saw no savages in several years
after.
After they were all gone, the Spaniards came out
of their den; and, viewing the field of battle, they
found about two-and-thirty dead men upon the spot;
some were killed with great long arrows, several of
which were found sticking in their bodies; but most
of them were killed with their great wooden swords,
sixteen
I
sixteen or seventeen of which they found in the sield
of battle, and' as many bows, with a great many
arrows: these swords were great unwieldly things,
and they must be very strong men that used them:
most of those men that were killed with them Ind
their heads mashed to pieces, as we may say, or, as
we call it in English, their brains knocked out, and
several of their arms and legs broken; so that it is
evident they fight with inexpressible rage and fury;
they found not one wounded man that was not stone
dead; for either they stay by their enemy till
they have quite killed them, or they carry all the
wounded men, that are not quite dead, away with
them.
This deliverance tamed our Englishmen for a great
while: the sight had filled them with horror, and
the consequence appeared terrible to the last degree,
especially upon supposing that some time or other
they should sall into the hands of those creatures,
who would not only kill them as enemies, but
kill them for food, as we kill our cattle. And
they professed to me, that the thoughts of being
eaten up like beef or mutton, though it was sup-
posed it was not to be till they were dead, had some-
thing in it so horrible, that it nauseated their very
stomachs, made them sick when they thought of it,
and fiHed their minds with unusual terror, that
thev were not themselves for some weeks after.
J
This, as I said, tamed even the three English
brutes I have been speaking of; and, for a great
while after, they were very tractable, and went about
the common business of the whole society well
F 2 enough;
63
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
enough; planted, sowed, reaped, and began to be
all naturalized to the country; but some time after
this, they fell all into such simple measures again as
brought them into a great deal of trouble.
They had taken three prisoners, as I had observed}
and these three being lusty stout young fellows, they
made them servants, and taught them to work
for them; and, as slaves, they did well enough;
but they did not take their measures with them
as I did by my man Friday, viz. to begin with them
upon the principle of having saved their lives, and
then instructed them in the rational principles of'
life, much less of religion, civilizing and reducing
them by kind usage, and asfectionate arguings;
but, as they gave them their food every day, so
they gave them their work too, and kept them fully
employed in drudgery enough; but they sailed in
this by it, that they never had them to assist them
and fight for them, as I had my man Friday, who
was as true to me as the very flesh upon my bones.
But to come to the samily part: Being all now
good friends (for common danger, as I said above,
had effectually reconciled them), they began to con-
sider their general circumstances; and the first thing
that came under their consideration was, whether,
seeing the savages particularly haunted that side of the
island, and that there were more remote and retired
parts of it equally adapted to their way of living, and
manifestly to their advantage, they should not rather
remove their habitation, and plant in some more
proper place for their safety, and especially for the
security of their cattle and corn..
Upon
Upon this, after long debate, it was conceived,
that they should not remove their habitation; be-
cause that some time or other they thought they
might hear from their governor again, meaning
me: and if I mould send any one to seek them, I
would be sure to direct them on that side, where, if
they mould find the place demolished, they would
conclude the savages had killed us all, and we were
gone, and so our supply would go away too.
But as to their corn and cattle, they agreed to
remove them into the valley where my cave was,
where the land was as proper to both, and where
indeed there was land enough: however, upon se-
cond thoughts, they altered one part of that resolu-
tion too, and resolved only to remove part of their
cattle thither, and plant part of their corn there;
and so, if one part was destroyed, the other might
be saved: and one piece of prudence they used,
which it was very well they did; viz. That they
never trusted these three savages, which they had
taken prisoners, with knowing any thing of the
plantation they had made in that valley, or of any
cattle they had there; much less of the cave there,
which they kept in case of necessity, as a safe retreat;
and thither they carried also the two barrels of pow-
der which I had left them at my coming away.
But, however, they resolved not to change their
habitation; yet they agreed, that as I had carefully
covered it first with a wall and fortification, and
then with a grove of trees; so, seeing their safety
consisted entirely in their being concealed, of which
they were now fully convinced, they set to work to
cover and conceal the place yet more effectually than
F 3 before:
before: to this purpose, as I had planted trees (of
rather thrust in stakes, which in time all grew to be
trees) for some good distance before the entrance
into my apartment, they went on in the same man-
ner, and filled up the rest of that whole space of
ground, from the trees I had set, quite down to the
side of the creek, where, as I said, I landed my
floats, and even into the very ouze where the tide
flowed, not so much as leaving any place to land, or
any sign that there had been any landing thereabout:
these stakes also, being of a wood very forward to
grow, as I had noted formerly, they took care to
have generally very much larger and taller than those
which I had planted, and placed them so very thick
and close, that when they had been three or four
years grown, there was no piercing with the eye any
considerable way into the plantation: as for that part
which I had planted, the trees were grown as thick
as a man's thigh; and among them they placed so
many other short ones, and so thick, that, in a word,
it stood like a palisado a quarter of a mile thick, and
it was next to impossible to penetrate it, but with a
little army, to cut it all down; for a little dog could
hardly get between the trees, they stood so close.
But this was not all; for they did the same by
all the ground to the right hand, and to the left,
and round even to the top of the hill; leaving no
way, not so much as for themselves to come out,
but by the ladder placed up to the side of the hill,
and then, lifted up, and placed again from the first
stage up to the top; which ladder, when it was taken
down, nothing but what had wings or witchcraft to
assist it, could come at them.
This
This was excellently well contrived: nor was it
less than what they afterwards found occasion for;
which served to convince me, that as human pru-
dence has authority of Providence to justify it, so
it has, doubtless, the direction of Providence to set
it to work; and, would we listen carefully to the
voice of it, I am fully persuaded we might prevent
many of the disasters which our lives are now, by
our own negligence, subjected to. But this by the
way.
I return to the story: they lived two years after
this in perfect retirement, and had no more visits
from the savages; they had indeed an alarm given
them one morning, which put them in a great con-
sternation; for, some of the Spaniards being out
early one morning on the west side, or rather end of
the island, which, by the way, was that end where
J never went, for fear of being discovered, they were
surprised with seeing above twenty canoes of Indians
just coming on shore,
They made the best of their way home, in hurry
enough; and giving the alarm to their comrades,
they kept close all that day and the next, going
out only at night, to make observation: but they
had the good luck to be mistaken; for wherever
the savages went, they did not land at that time
on the island, but pursued some other design.
And now they had another broil with the three
Englishmen; one of which, a most turbulent fellow,
being in a rage at one of the three slaves, which I
mentioned they had taken, because the fellow had
not done something right which he bid him do, and
F 4 seemed
seemed a little untractable in his shewing him, drew
a hatchet out of a frog-belt, in which he bore it by
his side, and fell upon him, the poor savage, not to
correct him, but to kill him. One of the Spaniards,
who was by, seeing him give the fellow a barbarous
cut with the hatchet, which he aimed at his head,
but struck into his shoulder, so that he thought he
had cut the poor creature's arm off, ran to him, and
intreating him not to murder the poor man, clapt
in between him and the savage, to prevent the
mischief. . N
The fellow, being enraged the more at this, struck
at the Spaniard with his hatchet, and swore he would
serve him as he intended to serve the savage; which
the Spaniard perceiving, avoided the blow, and
with a shovel, which he had in his hand (for they
were working in the field about the corn-land,)
knocked the brute down: another of the Englishmen,
running at the same time to help his comrade,
knocked the Spaniard down; and then two Spaniards
more came to help their man, and a third Englishman
sell upon them. They had none of them any fire-
arms, or any other weapons but hatchets and other
tools, except the third Englisloman; he had one of
my old rusty cutlasses, with which he made at the
last Spaniards, and wounded them both: this fray
set the whole samily in an uproar, and more help
coming in, they took the three Englishmen prisoners.
The next question was, What should be done with
them? They had been so often mutinous, and were
so furious, so desperate, and so idle withal, that they
knew not what course to take with them, for they
were
were mischievous to the highest degree, and valued
not what hurt they did any man; so that, in short,
it was'not safe to live with them.
The Spaniard who was governor, told them in so
many words, that if they had been his own country-
men, he would have hanged them all; for all laws,
and all governors, were to preserve society; and
those who were dangerous to the society ought to be
expelled out of it; but as they were Englishmen,
and that it was to the generous kindness of an Eng-
lishman that they all owed their preservation and de-
liverance, he would use them with all possible lenity,
and would leave them to the judgment of the other
two Englislmen, who were their countrymen.
One of the two honest Englishmen stood up, and
said, they defired it might not be left to them: for,
says he, I am sure we ought to sentence them to the
gallows; and with that gives an account how Will
Atkins, one of the three, had proposed to have all
the five Englishmen join together, and murder all the
Spaniards, when they were in their deep.
When the Spanish governor heard this, he calls to
Will Atkins: How, Seignior Atkins, says lie, Will
you murder us all? What have you to say to that?
That hardened villain was so sar from denying it,
that he said it was true, and G—d d—mn him they
would do it still before they had done with them.
Well, but Seignior Atkins, said the Spaniard, What
have we done to you that you will kill us? And
what would you get by killing us? And what must
we do to prevent your killing us? Must we kill you,
er will you kill us? Why will you put us to the ne-
cessity
celfity of this, Seignior Atkins? says the Spaniard
very calmly, and smiling.
Seignior Atkins was in such a rage at the Spaniard's.
making a jest of it, that, had he not been held by
three men, and withal had no weapons with him, it
was thought he would have attempted to have killed
the Spaniard in the middle of all the company.
This hare-brained carriage obliged them to consi-
der seriously what was to be done. The two English-
men and the Spaniard, who saved the poor savage,
were of the opinion, That they mould hang one of
the three for an example to the rest; and that par-
ticularly it should be he that had twice attempted to
commit murder with his hatchet; and indeed there
was some reason to believe he had done it, for the
poor savage was in such a miserable condition with
the wound he had received, that it was thought he
could not live.
But the governor Spaniard still said; No, it was
an Englishman that had saved all their lives, and he
would never consent to put an Englishman to death,
though he had murdered half of them; nay, he said,
if he had been killed himself by an Englishmau, and
had time left to speak, it should be, that they should
pardon him.
This was so positively insisted on by the governor
Spaniard, that there was no gainsaying it; and, as
merciful counsels are most apt to prevail, where they
are so earnestly pressed, so they all came into it; but
then it was to be considered, what mould be done
to keep them from the mischief they designed; for
all agreed, governor and all, that means were to ba
used
Of ROBIHSOtf CRttSOI?, J$
Used for preserving the society from danger: After a
long debate it was agreed, first, That they should be
disarmed, and not permitted to have either gun, or
powder, or shot, or sword, or any weapon, and
should be turned out of the society, and left to live
where they would, and how they could, by them-
selves; but that none of the rest, either Spaniards or
English, should converse with them, speak with them,
or have any thing to do with them; that they should
be forbid to come within a certain distance of the
place where the rest dwelt; and that if they offered
to commit any disorder, so as to spoil, burn, kill, or
destroy any of the corn, plantings, buildings, fences,
or cattle belonging to the society, that they should
die without mercy, and would shoot them wherever
they could find them.
The governor, a man of great humanity, musing
upon the sentence, considered a little upon it; and,
turning to the two honest Englishmen, said, Hold; you
must reflect, that it will be long ere they can raise
corn and cattle of their own, and they must not starve;
we muse therefore allow them provisions. So he cau-
sed to be added, That they should have a proportion
of corn given them to last them eight months, and for
feed to sow, by which time they might be supposed
to raise some of their own; that they should have
six milch-goats, four he-goats, and six kids given
them, as well for present subsistence, as for a store;
and that they should have tools given them for their
work in the field; such as, six hatchets, an axe, a
saw, and the like: But they should have none of
these tools or provisions, unless they would swear
solemnly
7^
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
solemnly, that they would not hurt or injure any of the
Spaniards with them, or of their fellow Englishmen.
Thus they dismissed them the society, and turned
them out to shift for themselves. They went away
sullen and refractory, as neither contented to go
away, or to stay; but, as there was no remedy, they
went, pretending to go and choose a place where they
should settle themselves, to plant and live by them-
selves; and some provisions were given, but no wea-
pons.
About four or five days after, they came again for
some victuals, and gave the governor an account
where they had pitched their tents, and marked them-
selves out an habitation or plantation; it was a very
convenient place indeed, on the remotest part of the
island, N. E. much about the place where I provi-
dentially landed in my first voyage, when I was dri-
ven out to sea, the Lord alone knows whither, in
my foolish attempt to surround the island.
Here they built themselves two handsome huts,
and contrived them in a manner like my first habita-
tion, being close under the side of a hill, having
some trees growing already to the three fides of it;
so that by planting others, it would be very easily
covered from the sight, unless narrowly searched
for; they defired some dry goat skins for beds and
covering, which were given them; and upon their
giving their words that they would not disturb the
rest, or injure any of their plantations, they gave
them hatchets, and what other tools they could
spare; some pease, barley, and rice, for sowing,
and, in a word, any thing they wanted but arms and
ammunition.
They
17
They lived in this separate condition about six
months, and had got in their first harvest, though
the quantity was but small, the parcel of land they
had planted being but little; for indeed, having all
their plantation to form, they had a great deal of
work upon their hands; and when they came to
make boards, and pots, and such things, they were
quite out of their clement, and could make nothing
of it; and when the rainy season came on, for want
of a cave in the earth, they could not keep their
grain dry, and it was in great danger of spoiling:
and this humbled them much; so they came and beg-
ged the Spaniards to help them, which they very
readily did; and in four days worked a great hole
in the side of the hill for them, big enough to secure
their corn, and other things from the rain; but it
was but a poor place at best, compared to mine ; and
especially as mine was then; for the Spaniards had
greatly enlarged it, and made several new apartments
in it.
About three quarters of a year after this separation,
a new frolick took these rogues, which, together
with the former villainy they had committed, brought
mischief enough upon them, and had very near been
the ruin of the whole colony: the three new associates
began, it seems, to be weary of the laborious life
they led, and that without hope of bettering their
circumstances; and a whim took them, that they
would make a voyage to the continent from whence
the savages came, and would try if they could not
seize upon some prisoners among the natives there
and bring them home, so as to make them do the
laborious part of the work for them.
The
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
The project was not so prepostero us, if they had go*n4
no sarther; but they did nothing, and proposed no*
thing, but had either mischief in the design, or mis-
chief in the event: and, if I may give my opinion,
they seemed to be under a blast from Heaven; for if
we will not allow a visible curse to pursue visible
crimes, how mall we reconcile the events of thing9
with divine justice? It was certainly an apparent ven-
geance on their crime of mutiny and piracy, that
brought them to the state they were in; and, as they
shewed not the least remorse for the crime, but added
new villainies to it, such as, particularly, that piece
of monstrous cruelty of wounding a poor flave, be-
cause he did not, or perhaps could not, understand to
do what he was directed; and to wound him in such
a manner, as, no question, made him a cripple all his
life, and in a place where no surgeon or medicine
"could be had for his cure: and, what was still worse,
the murderous intent; or, to do justice to the crime,
the intentional murder, for such to be sure it was,
as was afterwards the formed design they all laid, to
murder the Spaniards in cold blood, and in their
sleep.
But I leave observing, and return to the story:
The three fellows came down to the Spaniards one
morning, and, in very humble terms, defired to be
admitted to speak with them: the Spaniards very
readily heard what they had to say, which was this:
that they were tired of living in the manner they did;
that they were not handy enough to make the neces-
saries they wanted; and that, having no help, they
found they mould be starved; but if the Spaniards
would give them leave to take one of the canoes which
they
70
they came over in, and give them arms and ammuni-
tion, proportioned for their defence, they would go
over to the main, and seek their fortune, and so deli*
ver them from the trouble of supplying them with
any other provisions.
The Spaniards were glad enough to be rid of them;
but yet very honestly represented to them the certain
destruction they were running into; told them,
they had suffered such hardships upon that very spot,
that they could, without any spirit of prophecy, tell
them, that they would be starved or murdered; and
bade them consider of it.
The men replied audaciously, they should be star-
ved if they stayed here, for they could not work, and
would not work; and they could but be starved
abroad; 'and if they were murdered, there was an
end of them, they had no wives or children to cry
after them; and, in short, insisted importunately upon
their demand, declaring that they would go, whether
they would give them any arms or no.
The Spaniards told them, with great kindness>
that if they were resolved to go, they should not go
like naked men, and be in no condition to defend
themselves; and that though they could ill spare
their fire-arms, having not enough for themselves,
yet they would let them have two musquets, a pistol,
and a cutlass, and each man a hatchet, which they
thought susiieient for them.
In a word, they accepted the offer; and having
baked them bread enough to serve them a month,
and given them as much goat's flesh as they could
eat while it was sweet, and a great basket full of dried
grapes, a pot full of fresh water, and a young kid
alive
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
alive to kill, they boldly set out in a canoe for a
voyage over the sea, where it was at least forty miles
broad.
The boat was indeed a large one, and would have
very well carried 15 or 20 men; and therefore was
rather too big for them to manage; but as they had
a sair breeze and the flood-tide w ith them, they did
well enough: they had made a mast of a long pole,
and a sail of four large goat-skins dried, which they
had sowed or laced together; and away they went
merrily enough: the Spaniards called after them,
Bon Veajo; and no man ever thought of seeing them
any more.
The Spaniards would often say to one another, and
the two hone'I Englishmen who remained behind, how
quietly and comfortably they lived, now those three
turbulent fellows were gone; as for their ever coming
again, that was the remotest thing from their thoughts
could be imagined; when, behold, after twenty
two days absence, one of the Englishmen being
abroad upon his planting-work, fees three strange
men coming towards him at a distance, two of them
with guns upon their shoulders.
Away runs the Englislunan, as if he was bewitched,
and became frighted and amazed, to the governor
Spaniard, and tells him they were all undone, for
there were strangers landed upon the island, he could
not tell who: the Spaniard pausing a while, says to
him, How do you mean, you cannot tell who? They
are savages to be sure. No, no, says the Englishman,
they are men in clothes, with arms: Nay then, says
the Spaniard, why are you concerned? If they are
not savages, they must be friends; for there is no
Christian
Si
Christian nation upon earth, but will do us good ra-
ther than harm.
While they were debating thus, came the three
Englis}men, and, standing without the wood which
was new planted, hallooed to them; they presently
knew their voices, and so all the wonder of that
kind ceased. But now the admiration was turned
upon another question, 'viz. What could be the mat-
ter, and what made them come back again?
It was not long before they brought the men in;
and enquiring where they had been, and what they
had been doing? They gave them a full account
of their voyage in a few words, viz. That they
reached the land in two days, or something less; but
finding the people alarmed at their coming, and pre-
paring with bows and arrows to fight them, they
durst not go on more, but sailed on to the northward
six or seven hours, till they came to a great opening,
by which they perceived that the land they saw from
our island was not the main, but an island: that
entering that opening of the sea, they saw another
island on the right hand north, and several more
west; and being resolved to land somewhere, they
put over to one os the islands which lay west, and
went boldly on more; that they found the people
were courteous and friendly to them, and they gave
them several roots, and some dried fish, and ap-
peared very sociable; and the women, as well as
the men, were very forward to supply them with
any thing they could get for them to eat, and
brought it to them a great way upon their heads.
They continued here four days, and enquired, as
well as they could of them by signs, what nations
Vol. II. G were
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
were this way, and that way; and were told of se-
veral fierce and terrible people, that lived almost
every way; who, as they made known by signs to
them, used to eat men; but as for themselves, they
said, that they never eat men or women, except
only such as they took in the wars; and then they
owned, that they made a great feast, and eat their
prisoners.
The Englishmen enquired, when they had a feast
of that kind; and they told them two moons ago,
pointing to the moon, and then to two fingers; and
that their great king had two hundred prisoners now,
which he had taken in his war; and they were
feeding them to make them fat for the next feast.
The Englishmen seemed mighty desirous to fee those
prisoners; but the others mistaking them, thought
they were desirous to have some of them to carry
away for their own eating. So they beckoned to
them, pointing to the setting of the sun, and then
to the rising; which was to signify, that the next
morning, at fun-rising, they would bring some for
them; and accordingly, the next morning, they
brought down five women, and eleven men; and
gave them to the Englishmen, to carry with them
on their voyage, just as we would bring so many
cows and oxen down to a sea-port town, to victual
a ship.
As brutish and barbarous as these fellows were
at home, their stomachs turned at this sight, and
they did not know what to do; to refuse the pri-
soners would have been the highest affront to the
savage gentry that offered them; and what to do
with them they knew hot: however, upon some de-
bate,
bate, they resolved to accept of them; and, in re-
turn, they gave the savages that brought them one
of their hatchets, an old key, a knife, and six or
seven of their bullets, which, though they did not
understand, they seemed extremely pleased with:
and then, tying the poor creatures hands behind
them, they (the people) dragged the prisoners into
the boat for our men.
The Englishmen were obliged to come away as
soon as they had them, or else they that gave them
this noble present, would certainly have expected
that they should have gone to work with them, have
killed two or three of them the next morning, and
perhaps have invited the donors to dinner.
But, having taken their leave with all the respect
and thanks that could well pass between people, where,
on either side, they understood not one word they
could say, they put off with their boat, and came
back towards the first island, where, when they ar-
rived, they set eight of their prisoners at liberty,
there being too many of them for their occasion.
In their voyage they endeavoured to have some
communication with their prisoners, but it was im-
possible to make them understand any thing; no-
thing they could say to them, or give them, or do
for them, but was looked upon as going about to
murder them: they first of all unbound them; but
the poor creatures screamed at that, especially the
women, as if they had just felt the knife at their
throats; for they immediately concluded they were
unbound on purpose to be killed.
G2 If
If they gave them any thing to eat, it was the
same thing; then they concluded it was for fear they
should sink in flesh, and so not be sat enough to kill:
if they looked at one of them more particularly,
the party presently concluded, it was to fee whether
he or she was sattest and fittest to kill first; nay,
after they had brought them quite over, and began
to use them kindly, and treat them well, still they
expected every day to make a dinner or supper for
their new masters.
When the three wanderers had given this unac-
countable history or journal of their voyage, the
Spaniard asked them, where their new samily was?
And being told that they had brought them on shore,
and put them into one of their huts, and were come
to beg some victuals for them; they (the Spaniards)
and the other two Englishmen, that is to say, the
whole colony, resolved to go all down to the place,
and see them, and did so, and Friday's sather with
them.
When they came into the hut, there they sat ail
bound: for when they had brought them on shore,
they bound their hands, that they might not take
the boat and make their escape; there, I say, they
sat, all of them stark-naked: first, there were three
men, lusty, comely fellows, well shaped, strait and
sair limbs, about 30 or 35 years of age, and five
women, whereof two might be from 30 to 40, two
more not above 24 or 25, and the fifth, a tall, comely
maiden, about 16 or 17: the women were well sa-
voured agreeable persons, both in shape and features,
only tawny; and two of them, had they been per-
fect
sect white, would have passed for handsome women,
even in London itself, having very pleasant agreeable
countenances, and of a very modest behaviour, espe-
cially when they came afterwards to be clothed, and
dressed, as they called it, though" that dress was very
indifferent, it must be confessed; of which here-
after.
The sight, you may be sure, was something un-
couth to our Spaniards, who were (to give them a
just character) men of the best behaviour, of the most
calm, sedate tempers, and perfect good-humour that
ever I met with; and, in particular, of the most
modesty, as will presently appear: I say the sight
was very uncouth, to fee three naked men, and five
naked women, all together bound, and in the most
miserable circumstances that human nature could be
supposed to be, viz. to be expecting every moment •
to be dragged out, and have their brains knocked
out, and then to be eaten up like a calf that is killed
for a dainty.
The first thing they did was to cause the old Indian,
Friday's sather, to go in, and see first if he knew
any of them; and then, if he understood any of
their speech: as soon as the old man came in, he
looked seriously at them, but knew none of them;
neither could any of them understand a word he
said, or a sign he could make, except one of the
women.
However, this was enough to answer the end,
which was to satisfy them, that the men into whose
hands they were sallen, were Christians; that they
abhorred eating of men or women, and that they
might be sure they would not be killed: as soon as
G3 they
86"
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
they were assured of this, they discovered such
a joy, and by such awkward and several ways, as is
hard to describe; for it seems they were of several
nations.
The woman, who was their interpreter, was bid,
in the next place, to ask them if they were willing
to be servants, and to work for the men who had
brought them away, to save their lives? At which
they all fell a dancing; and presently one fell to
taking up this, and another that, any thing that lay
next, to can y on their shoulders, to intimate, that
they were willing to work.
The governor, who found that the having women
among them, would presently be attended with some
inconveniency, and might occasion some strife, and
perhaps blood, asked the three men, what they in-
tended to do with these women, and how they in-
tended to use them, whether as servants, or as wo-
men? One of the Englishmen answered very boldly
and readily, that they would use them as both. To
which the governor said, I am not going to restrain
you from it; you are your own masters'as to that:
but this I think is but just, for avoiding disorders and
quarrels among you, and I defire it of you for that
reason only, viz. that you will all engage, that if
any of you take any of these women, as a woman,
or wife, he shall take but one; and that, having
taken one, none else should touch her; for though
we cannot marry any of you, yet it is but reasonable,
that while you stay here, the woman any of you
takes should be maintained by the man that takes
her, and should be his wife; I mean says he, while
he continues here; and that none else should have
any
87
any thing to do with her. All this appeared so just,
that every one agreed to it without any difficulty.
Then the Englishmen asked the Spaniards, if they
designed to take any of them? But every one an-
swered, No: some of them said they had wives
in Spain; and the others did not like women
that were not Christians; and altogether declared,
that they would not touch one of them; which was
an instance of such virtue, as I have not met with
in all my travels; on the other hand, to be short,
the five Englishmen took them every one a wife;
that is to say, a temporary wife; and so they set
up a new form of living; for the Spaniards and
Fridays sather lived in my old habitation, which
they had enlarged exceedingly within; the three
servants, which they had taken in the late battle of
the savages, lived with them; and these carried on
the main part of the colony, supplying all the reft
with food, and assisting them in any thing as they
could, or as they found necessity required.
But the wonder of this story was, how five such
refractory, ill-matched fellows should agree about
these women, and that two of them should not
pitch upon the same woman, especially seeing two
or three of them were, without comparison, more
agreeable than the others: but they took a good
way enough to prevent quarrelling among them-
selves: for they set the five women by themselves
in one of their huts, and they went all into the
other hut, and drew lots among them who mould
choose first.
He that drew to choose first, went away by him-
self to the hut, where the poor naked creatures were,
G 4 and
ss
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
and fetched out her he chose; and it was worth ob-
serving, that he that chose first, took her that was
reckoned the homeliest, and the oldest of the five,
which made mirth enough among the rest; and even
the Spaniards laughed at it; but the fellow consi-
dered better than any of them, that it was appli-
cation and business that they were to expect assist-
ance in, as much as any thing else; and she proved
the best wife in the parcel.
When the poor women saw themselves in a row-
thus, and fetched out one by one, the terrors of
their condition returned upon them again, and they
firmly believed, that they were now going to be de-
voured: accordingly, when the English sailor came
in and fetched out one of them, the rest set up a
most lamentable cry, and hung about her, and took
their leave of her with such agonies and such affec-
tion, as would have grieved the hardest heart in the
world; nor was it possible for the Englishmen to
satisfy them that they were not to be immediately
murdered, till they fetched the old man, Friday's
sather, who instantly let them know, that the five
men who had fetched them out one by one, had
chosen them for their wives.
When they had done this, and the fright the wo-
men were in was a little over, the men went to
work, and the Spaniards came and helped them;
and, in a few hours, they had built them every one
, a new hut or tent for their lodging apart; for those
they had already were crowded with their tools,
household stuff, and provisions: The three wicked
ones had pitched sarthest off, and the two honest
ones nearer, but both on the north shore of the
island,
89
isiand, so that they continued separate as before:
and thus my island was peopled in three places,
and, as I might say, three towns were begun to be
planted.
And here it is very well worth observing, that as
it often happens in the world (what the wife ends
of God's providences are in such a disposition of
things, I cannot say) the two honest fellows had the
two worst wives; and the three reprobates, that
were scarce worth hanging, that were fit for nothing,
and neither seemed born to do themselves good, or
any one else, had three clever, diligent, careful, and
ingenious wives; hot that the two first were ill
wives as to their temper or humour; for all the five
were most willing, quiet, passive, and subjected
creatures, rather like slaves than wives ; but my
meaning is, they were not alike capable, ingenious,
or industrious, or alike cleanly and neat.
Another observation I must make, to the honour
of a diligent application on the one hand, and to
the disgrace of a slothful, negligent, idle temper on
the other, .that when I came to the place, and viewed
the several improvements, planting, and manage-
ment of the several little colonies; the two men had
so sar outgone the three, that there was no compa-
rison; they had indeed both of them as much
ground laid out for corn as they wanted; and the
reason was, because, according to my rule, nature
dictated, that it was to no purpose to sow more corn
than they wanted; but the difference of the culti-
vation, of the planting, of the fences, and indeed
eyery thing else, was easy to be seen at first view.
The
The two men had innumerable young trees planted
about their huts, that when you came to the place
nothing was to be seen but a wood; and though
they had their plantation twice demolished, once by
their own countrymen, and once by the enemy, as
shall be shewn in its place; yet they had restored all
again, and ev.ery thing was flourishing and thriving
about them: they had grapes planted in order, and
managed like a vineyard, though they had them-
selves never seen any thing of that kind: and by
their good ordering their vines, their grapes were
as good again as any of the others. They had also
formed themselves a retreat in the thickest part of
the woods, where, though there was not a natural
cave, as I had found, yet they made one with in-
cessant labour of their hands, and where, when the
mischief which followed happened, they secured
their wives and children, so as they could never be
found; they having, by sticking innumerable stakes
and poles of the wood, which, as I said, grew so
easily, made a grove impassable, except in one place,
where they climbed up to get over the outside part,
and then went in by ways of their own leaving.
As to the three reprobates, as I justly call them,
though they were much civilized by their new set-
tlement, compared to what they were before, and
were not so quarrelsome, having not the same oppor-
tunity, yet one of the certain companions of a pro-
fligate mind never left them, and that was their idle-
ness: It is true, they planted corn, and made fences;
but Solomon's words were never better verified than
in them: "I went by the vineyard of the slothful,
"and it was overgrown with thorns;" for when
the
the Spaniards came to view their crop, they could
not see it in some places for weeds; the hedge had
several gaps in it, where the wild goats had gotten
in, and eaten up the corn; perhaps here and there
a dead bush was crammed in, to stop them out for
the present, but it was only shutting the stable door
after the steed was stolen; whereas, when they
looked on the colony of the other two, there was
the very face of industry and success upon all they
did; there was not a weed to be seen in all their
corn, or a gap in any of their hedges; and they, on
the other hand, verified Solomon's words in another
place: " The diligent hand maketh richfor
every thing grew and thrived, and they had plenty
within and without; they had more tame cattle than
the others, more utensils and necessaries within doors,
and yet more pleasure and diversion too.
It is true, the wives of the three were very handy
and cleanly within doors; and having learned the
English ways of dressing and cooking from one of
the other Englishmen, who, as I said, was a cook's
mate on board the ship, they dressed their husbands
victuals very nicely; whereas the other could not be
brought to understand it; but then the husband,
who, as I said, had been cook's mate, did it him-
self; but, as for the husbands of the three wives,
they loitered about, fetched turtles eggs, and caught
fish and birds: in a word, any thing but labour;
and they sared accordingly. The diligent lived well
and comfortably; and the slothful lived hard and
beggarly; and so I believe, generally speaking, it is
all over the world.
But
But now I come to a scene different from all that
had happened before, either to them or me; and the
origin of the story was this:
Early one morning there came on shore five or
six canoes of Indians, or savages, call them which
you please; and there is no room to doubt that they
came upon the old errand of feeding upon their
slaves; but that part was now so samiliar to the
Spaniards, and to our men too, that they did not
concern themselves about it, as I did; but, having
been made sensible by their experience, that their
only business was to lie concealed, and that, if
they were not seen by any of the savages, they would
go off again quietly, when their business was done,
having as yet not the lead notion of there being
any inhabitants in the ifland; I say, having been
made sensible of this, they had nothing to do but to
give notice to all the three plantations to keep with-
in doors, and not to shew themselves; only placing a
scout in a proper place, to give notice when the boats
went off to sea again.
This wasi without doubt, very right; but a dis-
aster spoiled all these measures, and made it known
among the savages, that there were inhabitants
there; which was, in the end, the desolation of
almost the. whole colony. After the canoes with
the savages were gone off, the Spaniards peeped
abroad again, and some of them had the curiosity
to go to the place where they had been, to fee what
they had been doing. Here, to their great surprise,
they found three savages left behind, and lying sast
asleep upon the ground; it was supposed they had
either been so gorged with their inhuman feast, that,
like
like beasts, they were asleep, and would not stir when
the others went, or they Were wandered into the
woods, and did not come back in time to be taken
in.
The Spaniards were greatly surprised at this fight,
and perfectly at a loss what do; the Spaniard go-
vernor, as it happened, was with them, and his ad-
vice was asked; but he professed he knew not what
to do; as for slaves, they had enough already; and
as to killing them, they were none of them inclined
to that; the Spaniard governor told me they could
not think of shedding innocent blood; for as to
them, the poor creatures had done no wrong, in-
vaded none of their property; and they thought
they had no just quarrel against them to take away
their lives.
And here I must, in justice to these Spaniards,
observe, that let all the accounts of Spanish cruelty
in Mexico and Peru be what they will, I never met
with seventeen men, of any nation whatsoever, in any
foreign country, who were so universally modest, tem-
perate, virtuous, so very good-humoured, and so
courteous, as these Spaniards; and, as to cruelty,
they had nothing of it in their very nature; no in-
humanity, no barbarity, no outrageous passions, and
yet all of them men of great courage and spirit.
Their temper and calmness had appeared in their
bearing the insufferable, usage of the three EngliJ}j-
men; and their justice and humanity appeared now
in the case of the savages, as above: after some con-
sultation, they resolved upon this, that they would
lie still awhile longer, till, if possible, these three
men might be gone; but then the governor Spa-
niard
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
nlard recollected, that the three savages had no boat;
and that, if they ivere left to rove about the island,
they would certainly discover that there were inha-
bitants in it, and so they should be undone that
way.
Upon this they went back again, and there lay
the fellows sast asleep still; so they resolved to
awaken them, and take them prisoners ; and they did
so: the poor fellows were strangely frighted when
they were seized upon and bound, and afraid, like
the women, that they mould be murdered and eaten;
for, it seems, those people think all the world do
as they do, eating men's flesh; but they were soon
made easy as to that; and away they carried them.
It was very happy for them, that they did not
carry them home to their castle; I mean to my pa-
lace under the hill; but they carried them first to
the bower, where was the chief of their country
work; such as the keeping the goats, the planting
the corn, &c. and afterwards they carried them to
the habitation of the two English?nen.
Here they were set to work, though it was not
much they had for them to do: and whether it was
by negligence in guarding them, or that they thought
the fellows could not mend themselves, I know not,
but one of them ran away; and, taking into the
woods, they could never hear of him more.
They had good reason to believe he got home
again soon after in some other boats or canoes of
savages, who came on shore three or four weeks af-
terwards, and who, carrying on their revels as usual,
went off again in two days time: this thought ter-
rified them exceedingly; for they concluded, and
that
that not without good cause indeed, that if this fel-
low got safe home among his comrades, he would
certainly give them an account that there were peo-
ple in the island, as also how weak and few they were;
for this savage, as I observed before, had never been
told, as it was very happy he had not, how many
they were, or where they lived, nor had he ever seen
or heard the fire of any of their guns, much less
had they shewn him any other of their retired
places, such as the cave in the valley, or the new
retreat which the two Englishmen had made, and
the like.
The first testimony they had, that this fellow had
given intelligence of them was, that about two
months after this, six canoes of savages, with about
seven or eight, or ten men in a canoe, came rowing
along the north-side of the island, where they never
used to come before, and landed about an hour after
sun-rise, at a convenient place, about a mile from
the habitation of the two Englishmen, where this
escaped man had been kept: as the Spaniard go-
vernor said, had they been all there, the damage
would not have been so much, for not a man of
them would have escaped: but the case differed now.
very much; for two men to fifty were too much
odds: the two men had the happiness to discover
them about a league off, so that it was above an hour
before they landed; and as they landed about a mile
from their huts, it was some time before they could
come at them. Now having great reason to believe
that they were betrayed, the first thing they did was
to bind the slaves which were left, and cause two of
the three men, whom they brought with the women,
who,
who, it seems, proved very saithful to them, to lead
them with their two wives, and whatever they could
carry away with them, to their retired place in the
woods, which I have spoken of above, and there to
bind the two fellows hand and foot till they heard
sarther.
In the next place, feeing the savages were alt
come on shore, and that they bent their course di-
rectly that way, they opened the fences where their
milch-goats were kept, and drove them all out, leav-
ing their goats to straggle into the wood, whither
they pleased, that the. savages might think they were
all bred wild; but the rogue who came with them
was too cunning for that, and gave them an ac-
count of it all; for they went directly to the place.
When the poor frighted men had secured their
wives and goods, they sent the other slave they had
of the three, who came with the women, and who
was at their place by accident, away to the Spa-
niards with all speed, to give them the alarm, and
desire speedy help; and in the mean time they took
their arms, and what ammunition they had, and
retreated towards the place in the wood where their
wives were sent, keeping at a distance; yet so that
they might see, if possible, which way the savages
took.
They had not gone sar, but that, from a rising
ground, they could see the little army of their ene-
mies come on directly to their habitation, and in a
moment more could fee all their huts and household-
stuff slaming up together, to their great grief and
mortisication; for they had a very great loss, and
to them irretrievable, at least for some time. They
kept
97
kept their station for awhile, till they found the sa-
vages, like wild beasts, spread themselves all over the
place, rummaging every way, and every place they
could think of, in search for prey; and, in particu-
lar, for the people, of whom it plainly appeared they
had intelligence.
The two Englishmen seeing this, thinking them-
selves not secure where they stood, as it was likely
some of the wild people might come that way, so
they might come too many together, thought it pro-
per to make another retreat about half a mile sar-
ther, believing, as it afterwards happened, that the
sarther they strolled, the fewer would be together.
The next halt was at the entrance into a very
thick grown part of the woods, and where an old
trunk of a tree stood, which was hollow, and vastly
large; and in this tree they both took their standing,
resolving to see what might offer.
They had not stood there long, but two of the
savages appeared running directly that way, as if
they had already notice where they stood, and were
coming up to attack them; and a little way sarther
they espied three more coming after them, and five
more beyond them, all coming the same way; be-
sides which, they saw seven or eight more at a dis-
tance, running another way; for, in a word, they
ran every way, like sportsmen beating for their
game.
The poor men were now in great perplexity, whe-
ther they should stand, and keep their posture, or
fly; but after a very short debate with themselves,
they considered, that if the savages ranged the coun-
try thus, before help came, they might, perhaps,
Vol. II. 'H " find
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
find out their retreat in the woods, and then all
would be lost; so they resolved to stand them there;
and if there were too many- to deal with, then they
would get to the top of the tree, from whence they
doubted not to defend themselves, fire excepted, as
long as their ammunition lasted, though all the sa-
vages that were landed, which were near fifty, were
to attack them.
Having resolved upon this, they next considered
whether they should fire at the two first, or wait for
the three, and so take the middle party; by which
the two and the five that followed would be sepa-
rated; at length they resolved to let the two first
pass by, unless they should spy them in the tree, and
come to attack them. The two first savages also
confirmed them in this resolution, by turning a little
from them towards another part of the wood; but
the three, and the five after them, came forwards
directly to the tree, as if they had known the Eng-
lishmen were there.
Seeing them come so straight towards them, they
resolved to take them in a line as they came; and
as they resolved to fire but one at a time, perhaps
the first shot might hit them all three; to which
purpose, the man who was to fire, put three or
four bullets into his piece, and having a sair loop-
hole, as it were, from a broken hole in the tree, he
took a sure aim, without being seen, waiting till they
were within about thirty yards of the tree, so that
he could not miss.
While they were thus waiting, and the savages
came on, they plainly saw, that one of the three
was the run-away savage that had escaped from
them,
99
them, and they both knew him distinctly, and re-
solved, that, if possible, he should not escape, though
they should both fire; so the other stood ready with
his piece, that if he did not drop at the first shot, he
should be sure to have a second.
But the first was too good a marksman to miss his
aim; for, as the savages kept near one another, a
little behind in a line, in a word, he fired, and hit
two of them directly: the foremost was killed out-
right, being shot in the head; the second, which
was the run-away Indian, was shot through the
body, and fell, but was not quite dead; and the
third had a little scratch in the shoulder, perhaps by
the same ball that went through the body of the se-
cond; and being dreadfully frighted, though not
much hurt, sat down upon the ground, screaming
and yelling in a hideous manner.
The five that were behind, more frighted with the
noise than sensible of their danger, stood still at
first; for the woods made the found a thousand times
bigger than it really was; the echoes rattling from
one side to another, and the fowls rising from all
parts, screaming and making, every sort, a several
kind of noise, according to their kind, just as it was
when I fired the first gun that, perhaps, was ever
shot off in that place since it was an island.
However, all being silent again, and they not
knowing what the matter was, came on unconcerned,
till they came to that place where their companions
lay, in a condition miserable enough; and here the
poor ignorant creatures, not sensible that they were
within reach of the same mischief, stood all of a
huddle over the wounded man, talking, and, as may
Ha be
100
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
be supposed, enquiring of him how he came to be
hurt; aud who, 'tis very rational to believe, told
them that a flash of fire first, and immediately after
that, thunder from their gods, had killed those two,
and wounded him: This, I say, is rational; for no-
thing is more certain than that, as they saw no man
near them, so they had never heard a gun in all their
lives, or so much as heard of a gun; neither knew
they any thing of killing or wounding at a distance,
with fire and bullets; if they had, one might rea-
sonably believe, that they would not have stood
fo unconcerned, in viewing the sate of their fel-
lows, without some apprehension of their own.
Our two men, though, as they confessed to me,
it grieved them to be obliged to kill so many poor
creatures, who at the same time had no notion of
their danger; yet, having them all thus in their
power, and the first having loaded his piece again,
resolved to let fly both together among them; and
singling out by agreement which to aim at, they shot
together, and killed, or very much wounded, four
of them; the fifth, frighted even to death, though
not hurt, fell with the rest; so that our men, seeing
them all sall together, thought they had killed them
all.
The belief that the savages were all killed, made
our two men come boldly out from the tree before
they had charged their guns again, which was a
wrong step; and they were under some surprise,
when they came to the place, and found no less than
four of the men alive, and of them, two very little
hurt, and one not at all: this obliged them to sall
upon them with the stocks of their musquets; and,
firtt,
IOI
first, they made sure of the run-away savage, that
had been the cause of all the mischief; and of ano-
ther that was hurt in his knee, and put them out of
their pain; then the man that was not hurt at all
came and kneeled down to them, with his two hands
held up, and made piteous moan to them by ges-
tures and signs, for his life; but could not say one
word to them that they could understand.
However, they signified to him to sit down at the
foot of a tree thereby; and one of the Engli/otiten,
with a piece of rope-twine, which he had by great
chance in his pocket, tied his feet sast together, and
his hands behind him, and there they left him; and,
with what speed they could, made after the other
two which were gone before, fearing they, or any
more of them, should find the way to their covered
place in the woods, where their wives, and the few
goods they had left lay: they came once in sight of
the two men, but it was at a great distance; how-
ever, they had the satissaction to fee them cross over
a valley, towards the sea, the quite contrary way
from that which led to their retreat, which they were
afraid of; and, being satisfied with that, they went
back to the tree where they left their prisoner, who
as they supposed, was delivered by his comrades; for
he was gone, and the two pieces of rope-yarn, with
which they had bound him, lay just at the foot of
the tree.
They were now in as great a concern as before,
not knowing what course to take, or how near the
enemy might be, or in what numbers,; so they re-
solved to go away to the place where their wives
were, to fee if all was well there, and to make them
H 3 easy,
T02
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
easy, who were in fright enough to be sure; for
though the savages were their own country folks, yet
they were most terribly afraid of them, and perhaps
the more, for the knowledge they had of them.
When they came thither, they found the savages
had been in the wood, and very near the place, but
had not found it; for indeed, it was inaccessible, by
the trees standing so thick, as before, unless the per-
sons seeking it had been directed by those that knew
it, which these were not; they found, therefore,
every thing very safe, only the women in a terrible
. fright ; while they were here, they had the comfort
of seven of the Spaniards coming to their assistance;
the other ten, with their servants, and old Friday,
I mean Friday's sather, were gone in a body to de-
fend their bower, and the corn and cattle that were
kept there, in case the savages should have roved
over to that side of the country; but they did not
spread so sar. With the seven Spaniards came one of
the savages, who, as I said, were their prisoners for-
merly, and with them also came the savage whom
the Englishmen had left bound hand and foot at the
tree; for it seems they came that way, saw the
slaughter of the seven men, and unbound the eighth,
and brought him along with them, where, however,
they were obliged to bind him again, as they had
done the two others, who were left when the third
ran away.
The prisoners began now to be a burden to them;
and they were so afraid of their escaping, that they
thought they were under an absolute necessity to
kill them for their own preservation: however, the
Spaniard governor would not consent to it; but or-
dered,
dered, that they should be sent out of the way to
my old cave in the valley, and be kept there, with
two Spaniards to guard them, and give them food:
which was done; and they were bound there hand
and foot for that night.
When the Spaniards came, the two Englishmen
were so encouraged, that they could not satisfy
themselves to stay any longer there; but taking five
of the Spaniards, and themselves, with four mus-
quets and a pistol among them, and two stout quar-
ter staves, away they went in quest of the savages;
and first, they came to the tree where the men lay
that had been killed; but it was easy to see, that
some more of the savages had been there; for they
attempted to carry their dead men away, and had
dragged two of them a good way, but had given it
over; from thence they advanced to the first rising
ground, where they had stood and seen their camp
destroyed, and where they had the mortification still
to see some of the smoke; but neither could they
here see any of the savages: they then resolved,
though with all, possible caution, to go forward to-
wards their ruined plantation: but a little before
they came thither, coming in sight of the sea shore,
they saw plainly the savages all embarking again in
their canoes, in order to be gone.
They seemed sorry at first that there was no way
to come at them, to give them a parting blow; but
upon the whole, were very well satisfied to be rid of
them.
The poor Englishmen being now twice ruined, and
all their improvements destroyed, the rest all agreed
H 4 to
to come and help them to rebuild, and to assist them
with needful supplies. Their three countrymen,
who were not yet noted for having the least inclina-
tion to do any thing good, yet, as soon as they heard
of it (for they, living remote, knew nothing till all
was over) came and offered their help and assistance,
and did very friendly work for several days, to restore
their habitations, and make necessaries for them; and
thus, in a little time, they were set upon their legs
again.
About two days after this, they had the sarther sa-
tissaction of seeing three of the savages canoes come
driving on shore, and, at some distance from them,
with two drowned men; by which they had reason
to believe, that they had met with a storm at sea, and
had over-set some of them; for it blew very hard
the night after they went oss.
However, as some might miscarry, so on the
other hand, enough of them escaped to inform the
rest, as well of what they had done, as of what hap-
pened to them; and to whet them on to another en-
terprise of the same nature, which they, it seems,
resolved to attempt, with susficient force to carry all
before them; for, except what the first man had told
them of inhabitants, they could say little to it of
their own knowledge; for they never saw one man,
and the fellow being killed that had affirmed it, they
had no other witness to confirm it to them.
It was five or six months after this, before they
heard any more of the savages, in which time our
men were in hopes they had not forgot their former
bad luck, or had given over the hopes of better;
when, on a sudden, they were invaded with a most
formi-
formidable fleet, of no less than twenty-eight canoes,
full of savages, armed with bows and arrows, great
clubs, wooden swords, and such like engines of
war; and they brought such numbers with them,
that, in short, it put all our people into the utmost
consternation.
As they came on shore in the evening, and at the
eastermost side of the island, our men had that night
to consult and consider what to do; and, in the first
place, knowing that their being entirely concealed
was their only safety before, and would much more
be so now, while the number of their enemies was
so great, they therefore resolved, first of all, to take
down the huts which were built for the two English'
men, and drive away their goats to the old cave;
because they supposed the savages would go directly
thither, as soon as it was day, to play the old game
over again, though they did not now land within
two leagues of it.
In the next place, they drove away all the flock of
goats they had at the old bower, as I called it, which
belonged to the Spaniards; and, in short, left as
little appearance of inhabitants any where as possible;
and the next morning early they posted themselves
with all their force, at the plantation of the two men,
waiting for their coming. As they guessed, so it
happened; these new invaders, leaving their canoes
at the east end of the island, came ranging along the
shore, directly towards the place, to the number of
two hundred and fifty, as near as our men could
judge. Our army was but small indeed; but, that
which was worse, they had not arms for all their
number
number neither: The whole account, it seems, stood
thus: First, as to men:
17 Spaniards.
5 Englishmen.
1 Old Friday, or Friday's sather.
3 Slaves, taken with the women, who proved
very saithful.
3 Other slaves who lived with the Spaniards*
29
To arm these they had:
11 Musquets.
5 Pistols.
3 Fowling pieces.
5 Musquets, or fowling pieces, which were
taken by me from the mutinous sea-
men whom I reduced.
2 Swords.
3 Old halberts.
29
To their slaves they did not give either musquet
or fusil, but they had every one an halbert, or a long
stasf, like a quarter stasf, with a great spike of iron
fastened into each end of it, and by his side a hatchet;
also every one of our men had hatchets. Two of
the women could not be prevailed upon, but they
would come into the fight; and they had bows and
arrows, which the Spaniards had taken from the sa-
vages, when the first action happened, which I have
spoken
spoken of, where the Indians fought with one ano-
ther, and the women had hatchets too.
The Spaniard governor, whom I have described
so often, commanded the whole; and William Atkins,
who, though a dreadful fellow for wickedness, was a
most daring bold fellow, commanded under him.
The savages came forward like lions, and our men,
which was the worst of their sate, had no advan-
tage in their situation; only that Will Atkins, who
now proved a most useful fellow, with six men, was
planted just behind a small thicket of bustles, as an
advanced guard, with orders to let the first of them
pass by, and then fire into the middle of them; and,
as soon as he had fired, to make his retreat, as nim-
bly as he could, round a part of the wood, and so
come in behind the Spaniards where they stood,
having a thicket of trees all before them.
When the savages came on, they ran straggling
about every way in heaps, out of all manner of or-
der; and Will Atkins let about fifty of them pass by
him; then, seeing the rest come in a very thick
throng, he orders three of his men to fire, having
loaded their mufquets with six or seven bullets a-
piece, about as big as large pistol bullets. How
many they killed or wounded, they knew not; but
the consternation and surprise was inexpressible among
the savages, who were frighted to the last degree, to
hear such a dreadful noise, and see their men killed,
and others hurt, but fee nobody that did it; when
in the middle of their fright, William Atkins, and
his other three, let fly again among the thickest of
them; and in less than a minute, the first three,
being loaded again, gave them a third volley.
Had
Had William Atkins and his men retired immedi-
ately, as soon as they had fired, as they were or-
dered to do; or had the rest of the body been at
hand, to have poured in their shot continually, the
savages had been effectually routed; for the terror
that was among them came principally from this;
viz. That they were killed by the Gods with thun-
der and lightning, and could fee nobody that hurt
them; but William Atkins, staying to load again,
discovered the cheat; some of the savages, who were
at a distance, spying them, came upon them behind;
and though Atkins and his men fired at them also,
two or three times, and killed above twenty, retir-
ing as sast as they could, yet they wounded Atkins
himself, and killed one of his fellow Englishmen with
their arrows, as they did afterwards one Spaniard,
and one of the Indian slaves who came with the wo-
men; this flave was a most gallant fellow, and fought
most desperately, killing five of them with his own
hand, having no weapon but one of the armed
staves, and an hatchet.
Our men being thus hard laid at, Atkins wound-
ed, and two other men killed, retreated to a rising
ground in the wood; and the Spaniards, after firing
three vollies upon them, retreated also; for their
number was so great, and they were so desperate,
that though above fifty of them were killed, and
more than so many wounded, yet they came on in
the teeth of our men, fearless of danger, and shot
their arrows like a cloud; and it was observed, that
their wounded men, who were not quite disabled,
were made outrageous by their wounds, and fought
like madmen.
When
When our men retreated, they left the Spaniard
and the Englishman, that were killed, behind them;
and the savages, when they came up to them, killed,
them over again in a wretched manner, breaking
their arms, legs, and heads, with their clubs, and
wooden swords, like true savages: But, finding our
men were gone, they did not seem inclined to pursue
them, but drew themselves up in a kind of a ring,
which is, it seems, their custom; and shouted twice,
in token of their victory; after which, they had the
mortification to fee several of their wounded men
fall, dying with the mere loss of blood.
The Spaniard governor having drawn his little
body up together, upon a rising ground, Atkins,
though he was wounded, would have had him march-
ed, and charged them again all together at once; but
the Spaniard replied, Seignior Atkins, you fee how
their wounded men fight; let them alone till morn-
ing; all these wounded men will be stiff and sore
with their wounds, and saint with the loss of blood;
and so we shall have the fewer to engage.
The advice was good; but Will Atkins replied
merrily, That's true, Seignior, and so shall I too;
and that's the reason I would go on, while I am
warm. Well, Seignior Atkins, says the Spaniard,
you have behaved gallantly, and done your part; we
will fight for you, if you cannot come on; but I
think it best to stay till morning: so they waited.
But as it was a clear moon-light night, and they
found the savages in great disorder about their dead
and wounded men, and a great hurry and noise
among them where they lay, they afterwards resolved
to sall upon them in the night, especially if they
could
no
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
could come to give them but one volley before they
were discovered. This they had a sair opportunity
to do; for one of the two Englishmen, in whole
quarter it was where the fight began, led them round
between the woods and the sea-side, westward, and
turning short south, they came so near where the
thickest of them lay, that before they were seen or
heard, eight of them fired in among them, and did
dreadful execution upon them; in half a minute
more eight others fired after them, pouring in their
small {hot in such a quantity, that abundance were
killed and wounded; and all this while they were
not able to fee who hurt them, or which way to
fly.
The Spaniards charged again, with the utmost ex-
pedition, and then divided themselves into three
bodies, and resolved to sall in among them all toge-
ther: they had in each body eight persons; that is
to say, twenty-four, whereof were twenty-two men,
and the two women, who, by the way, fought des-
perately.
They divided the fire-arms equally in each party*
and so of the halberts and staves. They would have
had the women keep back; but they said, they were
resolved to die with their husbands. Having thus
formed their little army, they marched out from
among, the trees, and came up to the teeth of the
enemy, shouting and hallooing as loud as they could;
the savages stood all together, but were in the utmost
confusion, hearing the noise of our men shouting
from three quarters together; they would have
fought if they had seen us; and, as soon as we
came near enough to be seen, some arrows were
foot,
Ill
shot, and poor old Friday was wounded, though not
dangerously. But our men gave them no time;
but, running up to them, fired among them three
ways, and then fell in with the but-ends of their
mufquets, their swords, armed staves, and hatchets;
and laid about them so well, that, in a word, they
set up a dismal screaming and howling, flying to save
their lives which way soever they could.
Our men were tired with the execution; and
killed, or mortally wounded, in the two fights, about
180 of them; the rest, being frighted out of their
wits, scoured through the woods, and over the
hills, with all the speed that fear and nimble feet
could help them to do; and as we did not trouble
ourselves much to pursue them, they got all together
to the sea-side, where they landed, and where their
canoes lay. But their disaster was not at an end
yet; for it blew a terrible storm of wind that even-
ing from the sea-ward; so that it was impossible for
them to put off; nay, the storm continuing all night,
when the tide came up, their canoes were most of
them driven by the surge of the sea so high upon the
shore, that it required infinite toil to get them off;
and some of them were even dashed to pieces against
the beach, or against one another.
Our men, though glad of their victory, yet got
little rest that night; but having refreshed themselves
as well as they could, they resolved to march to that
part of the island where the savages were fled, and
fee what posture they were in. This necessarily led
them over the place where the fight had been, and
where they found several of the poor creatures not
quite dead, and yet past recovering life; a fight dis-
agreeable
agreeable enough to generous minds; for a truly
great man, though obliged by the law of battle to
destroy his enemy, takes no delight in his misery.
However, there was no need to give any order in
this case; for their own savages, who were their ser-
vants, dispatched those poor creatures with their
hatchets.
At length they came in view of the place where
the more miserable remains of the savages' army lay,
where there appeared about 100 still; their posture
was generally fitting upon the ground, with their
knees up towards their mouth, and the head put be-
tween the hands, leaning down upon the knees.
"When our men came within two musquet shot of
them, the Spaniard governor ordered two musquets
to be fired without ball, to alarm them; this he did,
that by their countenance he might know what to ex-
pect, viz. Whether they were still in heart to fight,
or were so heartily beaten, as to be dispirited and dis-
couraged, and so he might manage accordingly.
This stratagem took; for, as soon as the savages
heard the first gun, and saw the flash of the second,
they started up upon their feet in the greatest con-
sternation imaginable; and, as our men advanced
swistly towards them, they all ran screaming and
yawling away, with a kind of an howling noise,
which our men did not understand, and had never
heard before; and thus they ran up the hills into the
country.
At first, our men had much rather the weather had
been calm, and they had all gone away to sea; but
they did not then consider, that this might probably
have been the occasion of their coming again in such
multi-
multitudes as not to be resisted; or, at least, to
come so many and so often, as would quite desolate
the island, and starve them: Will Atkins therefore,
who, notwithstanding his wound, kept always with
them, proved the best counsellor in this case: his
advice was, to take the advantage that offered, and
clap in between them and their boats, and so deprive
them of the capacity of ever returning any more to
plague the island.
They consulted long about this, and some were
against it, for fear of making the wretches fly into
the woods, and live there desperate; and so they
should have them to hunt like wild beasts, be afraid
to stir about their business, and have their plantation
continually risled, all their tame goats destroyed,
and, in short, be reduced to a life of continual
distress.
Will Atkins told them, they had better have to do
with 100 men, than with 100 nations; that as they
must destroy their boats, so they must destroy the
men, or be all of them destroyed themselves. In a
word, he shewed them the necessity of it so plainly,
that they all came into it; so they went to work im-
mediately with the boats, and, getting some dry
wood together from a dead tree, they tried to set
some of them on fire; but they were so wet, that
they would scarce burn. However, the fire so burned
the upper part, that it soon made them unfit for
swimming in the sea as boats. When the Indians saw
what they were about, some of them came running
out of the woods; and coming as near as they could
to our men, kneeled down and cried, Oa, Oa, Wa-
Vol. II. I ramokoa,
LllrE AND ADVENTURES
ramokoa, and some other words of their language,
which none of the others understood any thing of;
but as they made pitiful gestures, and strange noises,
it was easy to understand they begged to have their
boats spared, and that they would be gone, and ne-
ver return thither again.
But our men were now satisfied, that they had no
way to preserve themselves, or to save their colony,
but effectually to prevent any of these people from
ever going home again; depending upon this, that
if ever so much as one of them got back into their
country to tell the story, the colony was undone; so
that, letting them know that they should not have
any mercy, they sell to work with their canoes, and
destroyed them every one that the storm had not de-
stroyed before; at the sight of which, the savages
raised a hideous cry in the woods, which our people
heard plain enough; aster which they ran about the
ifland like distracted men; so that, in a word, our
men did not really know at first what to do with
them.
Nor did the Spaniards, with all their prudence,
consider that while they made those people thus des-
perate, they ought to have kept good guard at the
same time upon their plantations; for though it is
true they had driven away their cattle, and the In-
dians did not find their main retreat, I mean my old
castle at the hill, nor the cave in the valley; yet
they found out my plantation at the bower, and
pulled it all to pieces, and all the fences and plant-
ing about it; trod all the corn under scot; tore up
the vines and grapes, being just then almost ripe;
and did oui men an inestimable damage, though,
to
"5
to themselves, not one sarthing's worth of ser-
vice.
Though our men were able to fight them upon all
occasions, yet they were in no condition to pursue
them, or hunt them up and down; for as they were
-k*, two nimble of foot for our men when they found
them single, so our men durst not go about single,
for fear of being surrounded with their numbers;
the best was, they had no weapons; for though they
had bows, they had no arrows left, nor any mate-
rials to make any, nor had they any edged tool or
weapon among them.
The extremity and distress they were reduced to
was great, and indeed deplorable, but at the same
time our men were also brought to very hard cir-
cumstances by them; for though their retreats were
preserved, yet their provision was destroyed, and
their harvest spoiled; and what to do, or which way
to turn themselves, they knew not; the only refuge
they had now was, the stock of cattle they had in the
valley by the cave, and some little corn which grew
there. The three Englifimen, William Atkins and
his comrades, were now reduced to two, one of
them being killed by an arrow, which struck him
on the side of his head, just under the temples, so
that he never spoke more; and it was very remark-
able, that this was the same barbarous fellow who
cut the poor savage slave with his hatchet, and who
afterwards intended to have murdered the Spa-
niards.
I looked upon their case to have been worse at this
time than mine was at any time after I first disco- UJ,,^x
vered the grains of barley and rice, and got into the
I 2 method
method of planting and raising my corn, and my
tame cattle; for now' they had, as I may say, an
hundred wolves upon the island, which would de-
vour every thing they could come at, yet could be
very hardly come at themselves.
The first thing they concluded, when they saw
what their circumstances were, was, that they would,
if possible, drive them up to the sarther part of the
island, south-east, that if any more savages came on
shore, they might not sind one another; then, that
they would daily hunt and harrass them, and kill as
many of them as they could come at, till they had
reduced their number; and if they could at last tame
them, and bring them to any thing, they would
give them corn, and teach them how to plant, and
live upon their daily labour.
In order to this, they followed them, and so ter-
rified them with their guns, that in a few days, if
any of them fired a gun at an Indian, if he did not-
hit him, yet he would sall down for fear; and so
dreadfully frighted they were, that they kept out of
sight sarther and sarther, till at last our men follow-
ing them, and every day almost killing and wound-
ing some of them, they kept up in the woods and
hollow places so much, that it reduced them to the
utmost misery for want of food; and many were
afterwards found dead in the woods, without any
hurt, but merely starved to death.
When our men found this, it made their hearts
relent, and pity moved them; especially the Spaniard
governor, who was the most gentleman-like, gene-
rous minded man that ever I met with in my life;
and he proposed, if possible, to take one of them
alive,
II7
alive, and bring him to understand what they meant,
so sar as to be able to act as interpreter, and to go
among them, and fee if they might be brought to
some conditions, that might be depended upon, to
save their lives, and do us no spoil.
It was some time before anv of them could be
taken; but being weak, and half-starved, one of
them was at last surprised, and made a prisoner; he
was sullen at first, and would neither eat nor drink;
but sinding himsels kindly used, and victuals given
him, and no violence offered him, he at last grew
tractable, and came to himself.
They brought old Friday to him, who talked of-
ten with him, and told him how kind the others
would be to them all; that they would not only save
their lives, but would give them a part of the island
to live in, provided they would give satissaction;
that they should keep in their own bounds, and not 1
come beyond them, to injure or prejudice others;
and that they should have corn given them, to plant
and make it grow for their bread, and some bread
given them for their present subsistence ., and old
Friday bade the fellow go and talk with the rest of
his countiymen, and hear what they said to it; as-
suring them, that if they did not agree immediately
they should all be destroyed.
The poor wretches, thoroughly humbled, and re-
duced in number to about thirty-seven, closed with
the proposal at the first offer, and begged to have
some food given them; upon which twelve Spaniards
and two Englishmen, well armed, and three Indian
slaves, and old Friday, marched to the place where
they were; the three Indian slaves carried them a
I 3 large
large quantity of bread, and some rice boiled up to
cakes, and dried in the fun, and three live goats;
and they were ordered to go to the side of an hill,
where they sat down, eat the provisions very thank-
fully, and were the most saithful fellows to their
words that could be thought of; for, except when
they came to beg victuals and directions, they never
came out of their bounds; and there they lived when
I came to the island, and I went to fee them.
They had taught them both to plant corn, make
bread, breed tame goats, and milk them; they want-
ed nothing but wives, and they soon would have
been a nation: they were confined to a neck of land,
surrounded with high rocks behind them, and lying
plain towards the sea before them, on the south east
corner of the island; they had land enough, and it
was very good and fruitful ; for they had a piece of
land about a mile and a half broad, and three or
four miles in length.
Our men taught them to make wooden spades,
such as I made for myself; and gave among them
twelve hatchets, and three or four knives; and there
they lived the most subjected innocent creatures that
were ever heard of.
After this the colony enjoyed a perfect tranquillity,
with respect to the savages, till I came to re-visit them,
which was in about two years; not but that now
and then some canoes of savages came on more for
their triumphal, unnatural feasts; but as they were
of several nations, and, perhaps, had never heard
of those that came before, or the reason of it, they
did not make any search or enquiry after their country-
men j
men; and if they had, it would have been very hard
for them to have found them out.
Thus, I think, I have given a full account of all
that happened to them, to my return, at least, that
was worth notice. The Indians, or savages, were
wonderfully civilized by them, and they frequently
went among them; but forbid, on pain of death,
any of the Indians coming to them, because they
would not have their settlement betrayed again.
One thing was very remarkable, viz. that they
taught the savages to make wicker-work, or baskets;
but they soon out-did their masters; for they made
abundance of most ingenious things in wicker-work;
'particularly, all forts of baskets, sieves, bird cages,
cup-boards, Sec. as also chairs to sit on, stools, beds,
couches, and abundance of other things, being very
ingenious at such work, when they were once put in
the way of it.
My coming was a particular relief to these people,
because we furnished them with knives, scissars, spades,
shovels, pick-axes, and all things of that kind which
they could want.
With the help of these tools they were so very
handy, that they came, at last, to build up their huts,
or houses, very handsomely; raddling, or working
it up like basket-work all the way round, which was
a very extraordinary piece of ingenuity, and looked
very odd; but was an exceeding good fence, as well
against heat, as against all sorts of vermin; and our
men were so taken with it, that they got the wild sa-
vages to come and do the like for them; so that when
I came to fee the two Englishmen's colonies, they
looked, at a distance, as if they lived all like bees in
I 4 a hive j
a hive; and as for Will Atkins, who was now be-
come a very industrious, necessary, and sober fellow,
he had made himself such a tent of basket-work, as
I believe was never seen. It was 120 paces round on
the outside, as I measured by my steps; the walls
were as close worked as a basket, in pannels or
squares, thirty-two in number, and very strong, stand-
ing about seven feet high: in the middle was ano-
ther not above 22 paces round, but built stronger,
being eight square in its form, and in the eight cor-
ners stood eight very strong posts, roy ad the top of
which he laid strong pieces, joined together with
wooden pins, from which he raised a pyramid before
the roof of eight rafters, very handsome, I assure
you, and joined together very well, though he had
no nails, and only a few iron spikes, which he had
made himself too, out of the old iron that I had left
there; and, indeed, this fellow shewed abundance
of ingenuity in several things which he had no know-
ledge of; he made himself a forge, with a pair of
wooden bellows to blow the fire; he made himself
charcoal for his work, and he formed out of one of
the iron crows a middling good anvil to hammer up-
on; in this manner he made many things, but espe-
cially hooks, staples and spikes, bolts and hinges.
But to return to the house; after he pitched the roof
of his innermost tent, he. worked it up between the
rafters with basket-work, so firm, and thatched that
over again so ingeniously with rice straw, and over
that a large leaf of a tree, which covered the top,
that his house was as dry as if it had been tiled or
slated. Indeed he owned that the savages made the
basket-work for him.
, The
121
The outer circuit was covered, as a learl-to, all
round this inner apartment, and long rafters lay
from the 32 angles to the top posts of the inner
house, being about twenty feet distant; so that there
was a space like a walk within the outer wicker-wall,
and without the inner, near twenty feet wide.
The inner place he partitioned off with the same
wicker-work, but much sairer, and divided into six
apartments, for that he had six rooms on a floor,
and out of every one of these there was a door; first,
into the entry, or coming into the main tent; and
another door into the space or walk that was round
it; so that this walk was also divided into six equal
parts, which served not only for a retreat, but to
store up any necessaries which the samily had occasion
for. These six spaces not taking up the whole cir-
cumference, what other apartments the outer circle
had, were thus ordered: as soon as you were in at
the door of the outer circle, you had a short passage
straight before you to the door of the inner house; but
on either side was a wicker partition, and a door in
it, by which you went, first, into a large room or
store-house, 20 feet wide, and about 30 feet long,
raid through that into another not quite so long: so
that in the outer circle were ten handsome rooms,
six of which were only to be come at through the
apartments of the inner tent, and served as closets or
retired rooms to the respective chambers of the inner
circle; and four large warehouses or barns, or what
you please to call them, which went in through one
another, two on either hand of the passage that led
through the outer door to the inner tent.
Such
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
Such a piece of basket-work, I believe, was never
seen in the world; nor an house or tent so neatly.
contrived, much less so built: in this great bee-hive
lived the three samilies; that is to say, Will Atkins,
and his companions; the third was killed, but his
wife remained with three children; for she was, it
seems, big with child when he died; and the other
two were not at all backward to give the widow her
full share of every thing, I mean, as to their corn,
milk, grapes, &c. and when they killed a kid, or
found a turtle on the shore; so that they all lived well
enough, though it was true, they were not so indus-
trious aa the other two, as has been observed already.
One thing, however, cannot be omitted, viz. that,
as for religion, 1 don't know that there was any
thing of that kind among them; they4pretty often,
indeed, put one another in mind, that there was a
God, by the very common method of seamen, viz.
swearing by his name; nor were their poor, igno-
rant savage wives much the better for having been
married to Christians, as we must call them; for as
they knew very little of God themselves, so they
were utterly incapable of entering into any discourse
with their wives about a God, or to talk any thing
to them concerning religion.
The utmost of all the improvement which I can say
the wives had made from them, was, that they had
taught them to speak English pretty well; and all the
children they had, which were near twenty in all,
were taught to speak Englislj too, from their first
learning to speak, though they at first spoke it
in a very broken manner, like their mothers. There
wsre none of those children above six years old
when I came thither; for it was not much above
seven
seven years that they had fetched these five savage
ladies over, but they had all been pretty fruitful, for
they had all children, more or less: I think the cook's
mate's wife was big of her sixth child; and the mo-
thers were all a good fort of well governed, quiet, labo-
rious women, modest and decent, helpful to one an-
other, mighty observant and subject to their masters,
I cannot call them husbands; and wanted nothing
but to be well instructed in the Christian religion,
and to be legally married; both which were happily
brought about afterwards by my means, or, at least,
by the consequence of my coming among them.
Having thus given an account of the colony in
general, and pretty much of my five runagade Eng-
lishmen, I must say something of the Spaniards, who
were the main body of the samily; and in whose
story there are some incidents also remarkable
enough.
I had a great many discourses with them about
their circumstances, when they were among the sa-
vages: they told me readily, that they had no in-
stances to give of their application or ingenuity in
that country; that they were a poor, miserable, de-
jected handful of people; that if means had been put
into their hands, they had yet so abandoned them-
selves to despair, and so sunk under the weight of
their misfortunes, that they thought of nothing but
starving. One of them, a grave and very sensible
man, told me, he was convinced they were in the
wrong; that it was not the part of wife men to give
up themselves to their misery, but always to take hold
of the helps which reason offered, as well sor present
support, as for future deliverance; he told me, that
grief
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
grief was the most senseless, insignificant passion in
the world; for that it regarded only things past,
which were generally impossible to be recalled or to
be remedied, but had no view to things to come,
and had no share in any thing that looked like deli-
verance, but rather added to the affliction than pro-
posed a remedy; and upon this, he repeated a Spa-
nisli proverb; which, though I cannot repeat in just
the same words that he spoke it, yet I remember I
made it into an English proverb of my own, thus:
In trouble to be troubled.
Is to have your trouble doubled.
He then ran on in remarks upon all the little im-
provements I had made in my solitude; my unwea-
ried application, as he called it, and how I had made
a condition, which, in its circumstances, was at first
much worse than their's, a thousand times more
happy than their's was, even now, when they were
altogether: he told me, it was remarkable, that
Englislmen had a greater presence of mind, in their
distress, than any people that ever he met with; that
their unhappy nation, and the Portuguese, were the
worst men in the world to struggle with misfortunes;
for that their first step in dangers, after common
efforts are over, was always to despair, lie down un-
der it and die, without rousing their thoughts up to
proper remedies for escape.
I told him, their case and mine differed exceed-
ingly; that they were cast upon the shore without
necessaries, without supply of food, or of present
sustenance, till they could provide it: that it is true, I
had this disadvantage and discomfort, that I was
alone; but then the supplies I had providentially
thrown
thrown into my hands, by the unexpected driving ot
the ship on shore, was such a help as would have en-
couraged any creature in the world to have applied
himself as I had done: Seignior, says the Spaniard,
had we poor Spaniards been in your case, we should
never have gotten half those things out of the ship
as you did: nay, says he, we should never have found
means to have gotten a raft to carry them, or to
have gotten a raft on shore without boat or sail; and
how much less should we have done, said he, if any
of us had been alone! Well, I defired him to abate
his compliment, and go on with the history of
their coming on shore, where they landed: he told
me, they unhappily landed at a place where there
were people without provisions; whereas, had they had
the common fense to have put off to sea again, and
gone to another island a little sarther, they had found
provisions, though without people; there being an
island that way, as they had been told, where there
were provisions, though no people; that is to say,
that the Spaniards of Trinidad had frequently been
there, and filled the island with goats and hogs at
several times; where they have bred in such multi-
tudes, and where turtle and sea fowls were in such
plenty, that they could have been in no want of
flesh, though they had found no bread; whereas
here they were only sustained with a few roots and
herbs, which they understood not, and which had
no substance in them, and which the inhabitants gave
them sparingly enough, and who could treat them
no better, unless they would turn canibals, and eat
men's flesh, which was the great dainty of the
country.
They
They gave me an account how many ways they
strove to civilize the savages they were with, and to
teach them rational customs in the ordinary way of
living; but in vain: and how they retorted it upon
them, as unjust, that they, who came thither for
assistance and support, should attempt to set up for
instructors of those that gave them bread; intimat-
ing, it seems, that none mould set up for the in-
structors of others, but those who could live without
them.
They gave me dismal accounts of the extremities
they were driven to; how sometimes they were ma-
ny days without any food at all; the island they were
upon being inhabited by a sort of savages that lived
more indolent, and, for that reason, were less sup-
plied with the necessaries of life, than they had rea-
son to believe others were in the same part of the
world; and yet they found that these savages were
less ravenous and voracious, than those who had
better supplies of food.
Also they added, that they could not but fee with
what demonstrations of wisdom and goodness, the
governing Providence of God directs the event of
things in the world; which, they said, appeared in
their circumstances; for if, pressed by the hardships
they were under, and the barrenness of the country
where they were, they had searched after a better
place to live in, they had then been out of the way
of the relief that happened to them by my means.
Then they gave me an account, how the savages,
whom they lived among, expected them to go out
with them into their wars; and it was true, that, as
they had fire-arms with them, had they not had the
disaster
disaster to lose their ammunition, they should not
have been serviceable only to their friends, but have
made themselves terrible both to friends and enemies;
but being without powder and shot, and in a con-
dition, that they could not in reason deny to go out
with their landlords to their wars: when thev came
in the field of battle, they were in a worse condition
than the savages themselves; for they neither had
bows nor arrows, nor could they use those the sa-
vages gave them; so that they could do nothing but
stand still, and be wounded with arrows, till they
came up to the teeth of their enemy; and then, in-
deed, the three halberts they had were of use to
them; and they would often drive a whole little
army before them, with those halberts and sharpened
sticks put into the muzzles of their muskets: but
that for all this, they were sometimes surrounded
with multitudes, and in great danger from their ar-
rows; till at last they found the way to make them-
selves large targets of wood, which they covered
with skins of wild beasts, whose names they knew
not; and these covered them from the arrows of the
savages; that, notwithstanding these, they were
sometimes in great danger, and were once five of
them knocked down together, with the clubs of the
savages, which was the time when one of them was
taken prisoner, that is to say, the Spaniard whom I
had relieved: That at first they thought he had been
killed, but when afterwards they heard he was taken
prisoner, they were under the greatest grief imagi-
nable, and would willingly have all ventured their
lives to have rescued him.
They
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
They told me, that when they were so knocked
down, the rest of their company rescued them, and
stood over them fighting,, till they were come to them-
selves, all but he who they thought had been dead;
and then they made their way with their halberts and
pieces, standing close together in a line, through a
body of above a thousand savages, beating down all
that came in their way, got the victory over their
enemies, but to their great sorrow, because it was
with the loss of their friend; whom the other party,
finding him alive, carried off with some others, as
I gave an account in my former.
They described most affectionately, how they were
surprised with joy at the return of their friend and
companion in misery, who they thought had been de-
voured by wild beasts of the worst of kind, viz. by
wild men; and, yet how more and more they were
surprised with the account he gave them of his er-
rand, and that there was a Christian in a place near,
much more one that was able, and had humanity
enough to contribute to their deliverance.
They described how they were astonished at the
fight of the relief I sent them, and at the. appear-
ance of loaves of bread, things they had not seen
since their coming to that miserable place; how often
they crossed it, and blessed it as bread sent from
Heaven; and what a reviving cordial it was to their
spirits to taste it; as also, of the other things I had
sent for their supply. And, after all, they would
have told me something of the joy they were in at
the sight of a boat and pilots to carry them away to
the person and place, from whence all these new
comforts came; but they told me, it was impossible
to
to express it by words; for their excessive joy driv-
ing them to unbecoming extravagancies, they had
no way to describe them, but by telling me, that
they bordered upon lunacy, having no way to give
vent to their passion, suitable to the sense that was
upon them; that in some it worked one way, and
in some another; and that some of them, through a
surprise of joy, would burst out into tears; others be
half mad, and others immediately saint. This dis-
course extremely affected me, and called to my mind
Friday's extacy, when he met his sather, and the
poor people's extacy, when I took them up at sea,
after their ship was on fire; the mate of the ship's
joy, when he found himself delivered in the place
where he expected to perish; and my own joy, when
after twenty-eight years captivity, I found a good
ship ready to carry me to my own country: All
these things made me more sensible of the relation
of these poor men, and more affected with it.
Having thus given a view of the state of things,
as I found them, I must relate the heads of what I
did for these people, and the condition in which I
left them. It was their opinion, and mine too, that
they would be troubled no more with the savages; or
that, if they were, they would be able to cut them
off, if they were twice as many as before; so that
they had no concern about that. Then I entered
into a serious discourse with the Spaniard, whom I
called governor, about their stay in the island; for
as I was not come to carry any of them off, so it
would not be just to carry off some, and leave others,
who perhaps would be unwilling to stay if their
strength was diministied.
Vol. II K On
On the other hand, I told them, I came to esta*
blissi them there, not to remove them; and .then
I let them know, that I had brought with me re-
lief of sundry kinds for them: That I had been
at a great charge to supply them with all things ne-
cessary, as well for their convenience, as their de-
fence; and that I had such particular persons with
me, as well to increase and recruit their number, as
by the particular necessary employments which they
were bred to, being artificers, to assist them in those
things, in which, at present, they were to seek.
They were all together when I talked thus to them;
and before I delivered to them the stores I had
brought, I asked them, one by one, if they had en-
tirely forgot and buried the first animosities that had
been among them, and could shake hands with one
another, and engage in a strict friendship, and union
of interest, so that there might be no more misun-
derstandings or jealousies.
William Atkins, with abundance of frankness and
good-humour, said, They had met with asflictions
enough to make them all sober, and enemies enough
to make them all friends: That, for his part, he
would live and die with them; and was so sar from
designing any thing against the Spaniards, that, he
owned, they had done nothing to him but what his
own bad humour made necessary, and what he would
have done, and, perhaps, much worse, in their case;
and that he would ask them pardon, if I defired it,
for the foolish and brutish things he had done to
them; and was very willing and defirous of living
on terms of entire friendship and union with them;
and would do any thing that lay in his power to con-
vince
vmce them of it: and as for going to England,
he'cared not if he did not go thither these twenty
years.
The Spaniards said, they had, indeed, at sirst,
disarmed and excluded William Atkins, and his two
countrymen, for their ill conduct, as they had let
me know: And they appealed to me, for the ne.
ceflity they were under to do so; but that William
A'tkins had behaved himself so bravely in the great
fight they had with the savages, ,and on several occa-
sions since, and had shewed himself so saithful to,
and concerned for the general interest of them all,
that they had forgotten all that was past, and thought
he merited as much to be trusted with arms, and
supplied with necessaries, as any of them; and that
they had testified their satissaction in him, by com-
mitting the command to him, next to the governor
himself; and as they had an entire considence in
him, and all his countrymen, so they acknowledged,
they had merited that considence, by all the methods
that honest men could merit to be valued and trusted:
and they most heartily embraced the occasion of
giving me this assurance, that they would never have
any interest separate from one another.
Upon these frank and open declarations of friend-
ship, we appointed the next day to dine all together;
and indeed, we made a splendid feast: I caused the
ship's cook and his mate to come on shore, and dress
our dinner; and the old cook's mate we had on
shore, assisted. We brought on shore six pieces of
good beef, and four pieces of pork, out of the
ship's provision, with our punch bowl, and mate-
K 2 rials
rials to fill it; and, in particular, I gave them ten
bottles of French claret, and ten bottles of English
beer; things that neither the Spaniards, or the
Englishmen, had tasted for many years; and which,
it may be supposed, they were exceeding glad
of.
The Spaniards added to our feast five whole kids,
which the cooks roasted; and three of them were
sent, covered up close, on board our ship to the sea-
men, that they might feast on fresh meat from on
shore, as we did with their salt meat from on
board.
After this feast, at which we were very innocently
merry, I brought out my cargo of goods, wherein,
that there might be no dispute about dividing, I
shewed them that there was sufficient for them all;
and defired, that they might all take an equal quan-
tity of the goods that were for wearing; that is to
say, equal when made up. As first, I distributed
linen sufficient to make every one of them four
shirts; and, at the Spaniard's request, afterwards
made them up six; these were exceeding comforta-
ble to them, having been what, as I may say, they
had long since forgot the use of, or what it was to
wear them.
I allotted the thin English stuffs, which I mentioned
before, to make every one a light coat, like a frock,
which I judged fittest for the heat of the season, cool
and loose; and ordered, that whenever they de-
cayed, they should make more, as they thought
fit: The like for pumps, shoes, stockings, and
hats, &c.
I cannot
I cannot express what pleasure, what satissaction,
sat upon the countenances of all these poor men,
when they saw the care I had taken of them, and
how well I had furnished them: they told me, I was
a sather to them; and that, having such a corres-
pondent as I was, in so remote a part of the world,
it would make them forget that they were lest in a
desolate place; and they all voluntarily engaged
to me, not to leave the place without my con-
sent.
Then I presented to them the people I had brought
with me; particularly the taylor, the smith, and the
two carpenters, all of them most; necessary people;
but above all, my general artificer, than whom they
could not name any thing that was more needful to
them; and the taylor, to shew his concern for them,
went to work immediately, and with my leave, made
them every one a shirt the first thing he did; and,
which was still more, he taught the women not only
how to sow and stitch, and use the needle, but made
them assist to make the shirts for their husoands, and
for all the rest-
As for the carpenters, I scarce need mention how
useful they were, for they took in pieces all my clum-
sy, unhandy things, and made them clever, conve-
nient tables, stools, bedsteads, cupboards, lockers,
shelves, and every thing they wanted of that kind.
But, to let them fee how nature made artificers at
first, I carried the carpenters to fee William Atkins's
basket-house, as I called it; and they both owned,
they never saw an instance of such natural ingenuity
before; nor any thing so regular, and so handily
K 3 built,
built, at least; of its kind: and one of them, when
he saw it, after musing a good while, turning about
to me, I am sure, says he, that man has no need of
us; you need do nothing but give him tools.
Then I brought them out all my store of tools,
and gave every man a digging spade, a shovel, and
a rake, for we had no harrows or ploughs; and, to
every separate place, a pick-axe, a crow, a broad-axe,
and a saw; always appointing, that as often as any
were broken, or worn out, they should be supplied,
without grudging, out of the general stores that I left
behind.
Nails, staples, hinges, hammers, chissels, knives,
scissars, and all forts of tools and iron-work, they
had without tale, as they required; for no man
would care to take more than they wanted; and he
must be a fool that would waste or spoil them, on any
account whatever: And for the use of the smith, I
left two tons of unwrought iron for a supply.
My magazine of powder and arms, which I brought
them, was such even to profusion, that they could
not but rejoice at them; for now they could march
as I used to do, with a musket upon each shoulder,
if there was occasion; and were able to fight iooo
savages, if they had but some little advantages of
situation; which also they could not miss of, if they
had occasion.
I carried on shore with me the young man whose
mother was starved to death, and the maid also; she
was a sober, well-educated, religious young woman,
and behaved so inoffensively, that every one gave her a
good word: She had, indeed, an unhappy life with
us, there being no woman in the ship but herself;
but
but she bore It with patience. After a while, seeing
things so well ordered, and in so sine a way of thriv-
ing upon my island, and considering that they had
neither business or acquaintance in the Eqsl Indies,
or reason for taking so long a voyage; I say, con-
sidering all this, both of them came to me, and de-
sired I would give them leave to remain on the
island, and be entered among my samily, as they
called it.
I agreed to it readily; and they had a little plot
of ground allotted to them, where they had three
tents or houses set up, surrounded with a basket-
work, palisaded like Atkins's, and adjoining to his
plantation; their tents were contrived so, that they
had each of them a room, a part to lodge in, and a
middle tent, like a great store-house, to lay all their
goods in, and to eat and drink in: And now the
other two Englishmen moved their habitation to the
same place; and so the island was divided into three
colonies, and no more; viz. The Spaniards, with
old Friday, and the first servants, at my old habita-
tion under the hill, which was, in a word, the ca-
pital city, and where they had so enlarged and ex-
tended their works, as well under as on the out-side
of the hill, that they lived, though perfectly conceal-
ed, yet full at large. Never was there such a little
city in a wood, and so hid, I believe, in any part of
the world: For, I verily believe, 1000 men might
have ranged the island a month, and, if they had
not known there was such a thing, and looked on
purpose for it, they would not have found it; for
the trees stood so thick, and so close, and grew so
sast matted into one another, that nothing but cutting
K 4 them
them down first, could discover the place, except
the two narrow entrances where' they went in and
out, could be found; which was not very easy:
One of them was just down at the water's-edge, on
the side of the creek; and it was afterwards above
200 yards to the place; and the other was up the
ladder at twice, as I have already formerly described
it; and they had a large wood, thick planted, also
on the top of the hill, which contained above an
acre, which grew apace, and covered the place from
all discovery there, with only one narrow place be-
tween two trees, not easy to be discovered, to enter
on that side.
The other colony was that of Will Atkins's, where
there were four samilies of Englishmen, I mean those
I had left there, with their wives and children; three
savages, that were slaves; the widow and children
of the Englishman that was killed; the young man
and the maid; and, by the way, we made a wife of
her also, before we went away: There were also the
two carpenters and the taylor, who I brought with
me for them; also the smith, who was a very ne-
cessary man to them, especially as the gunsmith, to
take care of their arms ; and my other man, whom
I called Jack of all trades; who was himself as good
almost as twenty men, for he was not only a very
ingenious fellow, but a very merry fellow; and,
before I went away, we married him to the honest
maid that came with the youth in the ship, whom \
mentioned before.
And now I speak of marrying, it brings me na-
turally to say something of the French ecclesiastic
that I had brought with me out of the stiip's crew,
whom.
*37
whom I took at sea. It is true, this man was a Ro.
wan, and perhaps, it may give offence to some here-
after, if I leave any thing extraordinary upon record,
of a man, whom, before I begin, I must (to set him
out in just colours) represent in terms very much to
his disadvantage, in the account of Protestants; as
first, that he was a Papist; secondly, a Popish priest;
and thirdly, a French Popish priest.
But justice demands of me to give him a due cha-
racter; and I must say, he was a grave, sober, pious,
and most religious person; exact in his life, extensive
in his charity, and exemplary in almost every thing
he did: What, then, can any one say against my
being very sensible of the value of such a man, not-
withstanding his profession? Though it may be my
opinion, perhaps, as well as the opinion of others,
who shall read this, that he was mistaken.
The first hour that I began to converse with him,
after he had agreed to go with me to the East In-
dies, I found reason to delight exceedingly in his
conversation: And he first began with me about re-
ligion, in the most obliging manner imaginable.
Sir, says he, you have not only, under God (and
at that he crossed his breast) saved my life, but you
have admitted'me to go this voyage in your ship,
and by your obliging civility, have taken me into
your samily, giving me an opportunity of free con-
versation: Now, Sir, says he, you fee by my habit,
what my profession is; and I guess by your nation,
what your's is: I may think it is my duty, and
doubtless it is so, to use my utmost endeavours, on
all occasions, to bring all the souls that I can to the
knowledge of the truth, and to embrace the Catholic
doctrine;
'38
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
doctrine; but, as I am here under your permission,
and in your samily, I am bound in justice to your
kindness, as well as in decency and good manners,
to be under your government; and therefore I
shall not, without your leave, enter into any debates
on the points of religion, in which we may not
agree, sarther than you shall give me leave.
I told him, his carriage was so modest, that I could
not but acknowledge it; that it was true, we were
such people as they call heretics; but that he was
not the first Catholic that I had conversed with, with-
out salling into any inconveniencies, or carrying the
questions to any height in debate; that he should not
find himself the worse used for being of a different
opinion from us; and if we did not converse with-
out any dislike on either side, upon that score, it
would be his sault, not ours.
He replied, That he thought our conversation
might be easily separated from disputes; that it was.
not his business to cap principles with every man he
discoursed with; and that he rather defired me to
converse with him as a gentleman, than as a religieux;
that if I would give him leave, at any time, to dis-
course upon religious subjects, he would readily
comply with it; and that then he did not doubt but
I would allow him also to defend his own opinions,
as well as he could: but that, without my leave, he
would not break in upon me with any such thing.
He told me sarther, that he would not cease to do
all that became him in his office, as a priest, as well
as a private Christian, to procure the goods of the
ship, and the safety of all that was in her; and
though, perhaps, we would not join with him, and
he
he could not pray with us, he hoped he might pray
for us, which he would do upon all occasions. In
this manner we conversed; and, as he was of a most
obliging genileman-like behaviour, so he was, if I
may be allowed to say so, a man of good fense,
and, as I believe, of great learning.
He gave me a most diverting account of his life,
and of the many extraordinary events of it; of
many adventures which had besallen him in the few
years that he had been abroad in the world, and par-
ticularly this was very remarkable; viz. That during
the voyage he was now engaged in, he had the mis-
fortune to be five times stiipped and unshipped, and
never to go to the place whither any of the ships he
was in were at first designed: That his first intent
was, to have gone to Martinico; and that he went
on board a ship bound thither at St. Maloes; but
being forced into Lisbon in bad weather, the ship
received some damage, by running aground in the
mouth of the river Tagus, and was obliged. to un-
load her cargo there: That finding a Portuguese ship
there, bound to the Madeiras, and ready to sail, and
supposing he mould easily meet with a vessel there
bound to Martinico, he went on board, in order to
sail to the Madeiras; but the master of the Portu-
guese ship, being but an indifferent mariner, had
been out in his reckoning, and they drove to Fial;
where, however, he happened to find a very good
market for his cargo, which was corn; and there-
fore resolved not to go to the Madeiras, but to load
salt at the IJle of May, to go away to Newfoundland:
He had no remedy in the exigence, but to go with
the ship} and had a pretty good voyage as sar as the
Banks,
Banks, (so they call the place where they catch the
fish) where meeting with a French ship bound from
France to Quebec, in the river of Canada, and from
thence to Mariinico, to carry provisions, he thought
he should have an opportunity to complete his first
design: But when he came to .Quebec, the master of
the ship died, and the ship proceeded no sarther: So
the next voyage he shipped himself for France, in the
ship that was burnt, when we took them up at sea,
and then shipped them with us for the East Indies,
as I have already said. Thus he had been disap-
pointed in five voyages, all, as I may call it, in one
voyage, besides what I shall have occasion to men-
tion sarther of the same person.
But I shall not make digressions into other men's
stories, which have no relation to my own. I return
to what concerns our affair in the island: He came
to me one morning, for he lodged among us all the
while we were upon the island; and it happened to
be just when I was going to visit the Englishmen's co-
lony, at the sarthest part of the island; I say, he
came to me, and told me, with a very grave coun-
tenance, that he had, for two or three days, defired
an opportunity of some discourse with me, which,
he hoped, would not be displeasing to me, because
he thought it might, in some measure, correspond
with my general design, which was the prosperity
of my new colony; and, perhaps, might put it, at
least, more than he yet thought it was, in the way
of God's blessing.
I looked a little surprized at the last part of his
discourse; and turning a little short, How, Sir, said
I, can it be said, that we are not in the way of God's
blessing,
blessing, after such visible assistances, and wonderful
deliverances, as we have seen here, and of which I
have given you a large account?
If you had pleased, Sir, said he, (with a world
of modesty, and yet with great readiness) to have
heard me, you would have found no room to have
been displeased, much less to think so hard of me
that I should suggest, that you have not had won-
derful assistances and deliverances: And, I hope, on
your behalf, that you are in the way of God's
blessing, and your design is exceeding good, and will
prosper. But, Sir, said he, though it were more so,
than is even possible to you, yet there may be some
among you that are not equally right in their actions:
And you know, that in the story of Israels one
Achan, in the camp, removed God's blessing from
them, and turned his hand so against them, that
thirty-six of them, though not concerned in the
crime, were the objects of divine vengeance, and
bore the weight of that punishment.
I was sensibly touched with this discourse; and
told him his inference was so just, and the whole
design seemed so sincere, and was really so religious
in its own nature, that I was very sorry I had inter-
rupted him; and begged him to go on: And, in the
mean time, because it seemed, that what we had both
to say, might take up some time, I told him I was
going to the Englishman % plantation, and aflced him
to go with me, and we might discourse of it by the
way: He told me, he would more willingly wait on
me thither, because there, partly, the thing was
acted, which he defired to speak to me about: So
we
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
we walked on, and I pressed him to be free and
plain with me, in what he had to say.
Why then, Sir, says he, be pleased to give me
leave to lay down a few propositions, as the founda-
tion of what I have to say, that we may not differ in
the general principles, though we may be of some
differing opinions in the practice of particulars. First,
Sir, though we differ in some of the doctrinal articles
of religion, and it is very unhappy that it is so, es-
pecially in the case before us, as I shall shew after-
wards; yet, there are some general principles in
which we both agree; viz. First, that there is a
God; and that this God, having given us some stated
general rules for our service and obedience, we ought
not willingly and knowingly to offend him, either
by neglecting to do what he has commanded, or by
doing what he has expressly forbidden; and let our
different religions be what they will, this general
principle is readily owned by us all: That the bles-
sing of God does not ordinarily follow a presumptu-
ous sinning against his command; and every good
Christan will be affectionately concerned to prevent
any that are under his care, living in a total neglect
of God and his commands. It is not your men be-
ing Protestants, whatever my opinion may be of
such, that discharges me from being concerned for
their souls, and from endeavouring, if it lies before
me, that they should live in as little distance from,
and enmity with their Maker as possible; especially
if you give me leave to meddle so sar in your cir-
, cuit.
I could
I could not yet imagine what he aimed at, and told
him I granted all he had said; and thanked him,
that he would so sar concern himself for us; and
begged he would explain the particulars of what he
had observed, that, like Joshua, (to take his own
parable) I might put away the accursed thing from
us.
Why then, Sir, says he, I will take the liberty
you give me; and there are three things, which, if
I am right, must stand in the way of God's blessing
upon your endeavours here, and which I should re-
joice, for your sake, and their own, to fee removed.
And, Sir, says he, I promise myself that you will
fully agree with me in them all, as soon as I name
them; especially, because I shall convince you, that
every one of them may, with great ease, and very-
much to your satissaction, be remedied.
He gave me no leave to put in any more civilities,
but went on. First, Sir, says he, you have here four
Engliflmen, who have fetched women from among
the savages, and have taken them as their wives, and
have had many children by them all, and yet are not
married to them after any stated legal manner, as
the laws of God and man require; and therefore
are yet, in the fense of both, no less than adulterers,
and living in adultery. To this, Sir, says he, I
know you will object, that there was no clergyman,
or priest of any kind, or of any profession, to per-
form the ceremony; nor any pen and ink, or paper,
to write down a contract of marriage, and have it
signed between them. And I know also, Sir, what
the Spaniard governor has told you; I mean, of the
agreement
tIFE AMD ADVENTURES
agreement that he obliged them to make when they
took these women, viz. That they should chuse them
out by consent, and keep separately to them;
which, by the way, is nothing of a marriage, no
agreement with the women as wives, but only an
agreement among themselves, to keep them from
quarrelling.
But, Sir, the essence of the sacrament of matri-
mony (so he called it, being a Roman) consists not
only in the mutual consent of the parties to take one
another as man and wife, but in the formal and legal
obligation that there is in the contract, to compel the1
man and woman, at all times, to own and acknow-
ledge each other; obliging the man to abstain from
all other women, to engage in no other contract
while these subsist; and on all occasions, as ability
allows, to provide honestly for them, and their chil-
dren; and to oblige the women to the same, or like
conditions, mutatis mutandis, on their side.
Now, Sir, says he, these men may, when they
please, or when occasion presents, abandon these
women, disown their children, leave them to perish,
and take other women, and marry them whilst these
are living. And here he added, with some warmth,
How, Sir, is God honoured in this unlawful liberty?
And how shall a blessing succeed your endeavours in
this place, however good in themselves, and however
sincere in your design, while these men, who at pre-
sent are your subjects, under your absolute govern-
ment and dominion, are allowed by you to live in
open adultery?
I confess, I was struck at the thing itself, but
much more with the convincing arguments he sup-
ported
ported it with: for it was certainly true, that though
they had no clergyman on the spot, yet a formal con-
tract on both sides, made before witnesses, and con-
firmed by any token, which they had all agreed to
be bound by, though it had been but the breaking a
stick between them, engaging the men to own these
Women for their wives upon all occasions, and never
to abandon them or their children, and the women
to the same with their husbands, had been an effec-
tual lawful marriage in the fight of God; and it
was a great negtect that jf was not done.
But I thought to have gotten off With my young
priest, by telling him, that all that part was done
when I was not here; and they had lived so many
years with them now, that if it was adultery, it was
past remedy; they could do nothing in it now.
Sir, says he, asking your pardon for such freedom,
you are right in this; that it being done in your ab-
sence, you could not be charged with that part of the
crime. But I beseech you, flatter not yourself, that
you are not therefore under an obligation to do your
uttermost now to put an end to it: How can you
think, but that, let the time Dast lie on whom it will,
all the guilt, for the future, will lie entirely upon
you? Because it is certainly in your power now to
put an end to it; and in nobody's power but your's.
I was so dull still, that I did not take him right;
but I imagined, that, by putting an end to it, he
meant, that I should part them, and not suffer them
to live together any longer; and I said to him, I
could not do that by any means, for that it would
put the whole island in confusion. He seemed sur-
Vol. II. L prised
prised that I should so sar mistake him. No, Sir,
says he, I do not mean that you mould separate them,
but legally and effectually marry them now: And,
Sir, as my way of marrying may not be so easy to
reconcile them to, though it will be as effectual, even
by your own laws; so your way may be as well be-
fore God, and as valid among men 5 I mean, by a
written contract, signed by both man and woman,
and by all the witnesses present; which all the laws
of Europe would decree to be valid.
I was amazed to fee so^much true piety, and so
much sincerity of zeal, besides the unusual impar-
tiality in his discourse, as to his own party or church,
and such a true warmth for the preserving people
that he had no knowledge of, or relation to; I say,
for preserving them from transgressing the laws of
God; the like of which, I had, indeed, not met
with any where. But recollecting what he had said
of marrying them by a written contract, which I
knew would stand too, I returned it back upon him,
and told him, I granted all that he had said to be
just, and, on his part, very kind; that I would dis-
course with the men upon the point now, when I
came to them. And I knew no reason why they
should scruple to let him marry them all; which I
knew well enough would be granted to be as authentic
and valid in England, as if they were married by one
of our own clergymen. What was afterwards done
in this matter, I shall speak of by itself.
I then pressed him to tell me, what was the second
complaint which he had to make; acknowledging,
that I was very much his debtor for the first; and
.1 thanked
thanked him heartily for it. He told me he would
use the same freedom and plainness in the second;
and hoped I would take it as well: and this was,
that notwithstanding these English subjects of mine,
as he called them, had lived with these women for
almost seven years, and had taught them to speak
English, and even to read it; and that they were,
as he perceived, women of tolerable understanding,
and capable of instruction; yet they had not to this
hour taught them any thing of the Christian religion;
no, not so much as to know that there was a God,
or a worship, or in what manner God was to be
served; or that their own idolatry, and worshipping
they knew not who, was salse and absurd.
This, he said, was an unaccountable neglect, and
what God would certainly call them to an account
for; and, perhaps, at last take the work out of their
hands. He spoke this very affectionately and warm-
ly. I am persuaded, says he, had those men lived
in the savage country, whence their wives came, tha
savages would have taken more pains to have brought
them to be idolators, and to worship the devil, than
any of these men, so sar as I can fee, has taken with
them, to teach them the knowledge of the true God.
Now, Sir, said he, though I do not acknowledge
your religion, or you mine, yet we should be all glad
to see the devil's servants, and the subjects of his
kingdom, taught to know the general principles of
the Christian religion; that they might at least: hear
of God, and of a Redeemer, and of the resurrec-
tion, and of a future state, things which we all be-
lieve , they hud at least been so much nearer coming
. L 3 into
into the bosom of the true church, than they are
now, in the public profession of idolatry, and devil-
worship.
I could hold no longer; I took him in my arms,
and embraced him with an excess of passion: How
far, said I to him, have I been from understanding
the most essential part of a Christian, viz. to love
the interest of the Christian church, and the good of
other men's fouls! I scarce have known what belongs
to being a Christian. O, Sir, do not say so, replied
he; this thing is not your sault. No, said I, but
why did I never lay it to heart as well as you? It is
not too late yet, said he; be not too forward to con-
demn yourself. But what can be done now? said I;
you see I am going away. Will you give me leave,
said he, to talk with these poor men about it? Yes,
with all my heart, said I; and I will oblige them to
give heed to what you say too. As to that, said he, we
must leave them to the mercy of Christ; but it is
our business to assist them, encourage them, and in-
struct them; and, if you will give me leave, and
God his blessing, I do not doubt but the poor ig-
norant souls shall be brought home into the great
circle of Christianity, if not into the particular faith
that we all embrace; and that even while you stay
here. Upon this I said, I shall not only give you
leave, but give you a thousand thanks for it. What
followed on this account I shall mention also again
in its place.
I now pressed him for the third article in which we
were to blame: Why really, says he, it is of the
same nature, and I will proceed (asking your leave)
4 with
149
•with the same plainness as before: It is about your poor
savages yonder, who are (as I may say) your conquered
subjects. It is a maxim, Sir, that is, or ought to be re-
ceived among all Christians, of what church, or pre-
tended church soever, viz. that Christian knowledge
ought to be propagated by all possible means, and on
all possible occasions. It is on this principle that our
church fends missionaries into Persia, India, and China;
and that our clergy, even of the superior sort, wil-
lingly engage in the most hazardous voyages, and
the most dangerous residence, among murderers and
barbarians, to teach them the knowledge of the true
God, and to bring them over to embrace the Chris-
tian saith. Now, Sir, you have an opportunity here,
to have six or seven-and-thirty poor savages brought
over from idolatry to the knowledge of God, their
Maker and Redeemer, that I wonder how you
can pass by such an occasion of doing good; which
is really worth the expence of a man's whole life.
I was now struck dumb indeed, and had not one
word to say: I had here a spirit of true Christian
zeal for God and religion before me, let his parti- ,
cular principles be of what kind soever: As for me,
I had not so much as entertained a thought of this in
my heart before; and, I believe, should not have
thought of it; for I looked upon these savages as
slaves, and people, whom, 'had we any work for
them to do, we would have used as such, or would
have been glad to have transported them to any other
part of the world; for our business was to get rid
of them; and we would all have been satisfied, if
they had been sent to any country, so they had ne-
ver seen their own. But, to the case: I say, I was
L 3 confounded
confounded at his discourse, and knew not what an
swer to make him. He looked earnestly at me, seeing
me in some disorder: Sir, said he, I shall be very
sorry, if what I have said gives you any osfence.
No, no, said I, I am osfended with nobody but my-
self; but I am perfectly confounded, not only to
think that I should never take any notice of this be-,
fore, but with reflecting what notice I am able to
take of it now. You know, Sir, said I, what cir-
cumstances I am in; I am bound to the East Indies,
in a ship freighted by merchants, and to whom it
would be an insufferable piece of injustice to detain
their ship here, the men lying all this while at vic-
tuals and wages upon the owner's account: it is
true, I agreed to be allowed twelve days here; and
if I stay more, I must pay 3I. sterling per diem de-
murrage; nor can I stay upon demurrage above
eight days more; and I have been here thirteen
days already: So that I am perfectly unable to engage
in this work, unless I would suffer myself to be left
behind here again; in which case, if this single ship
should miscarry in any part of her voyage, I should
be just in the same condition that I was left in here
at sirst; and from which I have been so wonderfully
delivered.
He owned the case was very hard upon me as to
my voyage •, but laid it home upon my conscience,
whether the blessing of saving seven-and-thirty souls,
was not worth my venturing all I had in the world
for? I was not so sensible of that as he was: and I
returned upon him thus: Why, Sir, it is a valuable
thing indeed, to be an instrument in God's hand, to
"convert
convert seven-and-thirty heathens to the knowledge of
Christ; but as you are an ecclesiastic, and are given
over to that work, so that it seems naturally to sall
into the way of your profession, how is it then, that
you do not rather osfer yourself to undertake it, than
press me to it?
Upon this he saced about, just before me, as he
walked along, and, putting me to a full stop, made
me a very low bow: I most heartily thank God, and
you, Sir, says he, for giving me so evident a call to
so blessed a work; and if you think yourself dis-
charged from it, and defire me to undertake it, I
will most readily do it, and think it a happy reward
for all the hazards and difficulties of such a
broken, disappointed voyage as I have met with,
that I have dropped at last into so glorious a
work.
I discovered a kind of rapture in his sace, while
he spoke this to me; his eyes sparkled like fire, his
sace glowed, and his colour came and went, as if he
had been salling into fits: in a word, he was fired
with the joy of being embarked in such a work. I
paused a considerable while before I could tell what
to. say to him; for I was really surprised to find a
man of such sincerity and zeal, and carried out in
his zeal beyond the ordinary rate of men, not of his
profession only, but even of any profession whatso-
ever: but, after I had considered it a while, I asked
him seriously, if he was in earnest, and that he would
venture on the single consideration of an attempt on
those poor people, to be locked up in an unplanted island
for, perhaps, his life; and at last, might not know
X. 4 whether
whether he should be able to do them any good or
.not?
He turned short upon me, and asked me, what I
called a venture? Pray, Sir, said he, what do you
think I consented to go in your ship to the East In-
dies for? Nay, said I, that I know not, unless it was
to preach to the Indians. Doubtless it was, said he;
and do you think, if I can convert these seven-and-
thirty men to the saith of Christ, it is not worth
my time, though I should never be fetched off the
island again? Nay, is it not infinitely of more worth
to save so many souls, than my life is, or the life of
twenty more of the same profession? Yes, Sir, says
he, I would give Christ and the Blessed Virgin thanks
all my days, if I could be made the least happy in-
strument of saving the souls of these poor men,
though I was never to set my foot off this island, or
see my native country any more: But since you will
honour me, says he, with putting me into this work,
(for which I will pray for you all the days of my life)
I have one humble petition to you, said he, besides-
"What is that? said I. "Why, says he, it is, that
you will leave your man Friday with me, to be my
interpreter to them, and to assist me; for, without
, some help, I cannot speak to them, or they to me.
I was sensibly troubled at his requesting Friday,
because I could not think of parting with him, and
that for many reasons: He had been the companion
of my travels; he was not only saithful to me, but
sincerely affectionate to the last degree; and I had
resolved to do something considerable for him, if he
out-lived me, as- it was probable he would: then I
knew, that as I had bred Friday up to be a Protestant,
v
it
it would quite confound him, to bring him to em-
brace another profefiion; and he would never, while
his eyes were open, believe that his old master was
an heretic, and would be damned; and this might
in the end ruin the poor fellow's principles, and so
turn him back again to his first idolatry.
However, a sudden thought relieved me in this
strait, and it was this: I told him, I could not say
that I was willing to part with Friday on any account
whatever; though a work, that to him was of more
value than his life, ought to me to be of much more
value than the keeping or parting with a servant.
But, on the other hand, I was persuaded, that
Friday would by no means consent to part with me;
and then to force him to it, without his consent,
would be manifest injustice; because I had promised
I would never put him away; and he had promised
and engaged to me that he would never leave me,
unless I put him away.
He seemed very much concerned at it; for he had
no rational access to these poor people, seeing he did
not understand one word of their language, nor
they one word of his. To remove this difficulty, I
told him, Friday's sather had learned Spanish, which
I found he also understood; and he should serve him
for an interpreter: so he was much better satisfied,
and nothing could persuade him but he would stay
to endeavour to convert them; but Providence gave
another and very happy turn to all this.
I come back now to the first part of his objections.
When we came to the Englishmen, I sent for them
all together; and after some accounts given them of
what
what I had done for them, 'viz. what necessary thing*
I had provided for them, and how they were distri-
buted, which they were sensible of, and very thank-
ful for; I began to talk to them of the scandalous life
they led, and gave them a full account of the notice
the clergyman had already taken of it; and, ar-
guing how unchristian and irreligious a life it was, I
first asked them, if they were married men or bache-
lors? They soon explained their condition to me,
and shewed me that two of them were widowers, and
the other three were single men or bachelors: I asked
them, with what conscience they could take these
women, and lie with them, as they had done, call
them their wives, and have so many children by them,
and not be married lawfully to them?
They all gave me the answer that I expected, viz.
that there was nobody to marry them; that they
agreed before the governor to keep them as their
wives; and to keep them, and own them, as their
wives; and they thought, as things stood with them,
they were as legally married as if they had been
married by a parson, and with all the formalities in
the world.
I told them, that no doubt they were married in
the sight of God, and were bound in conscience to
keep them as their wives; but that the laws of men
being otherwise, they might pretend they were not
married, and so desert the poor women and children
hereafter; and that their wives, being poor desolate
women, friendless and moneyless, would have no way
to help themselves: I therefore told them, that unless
I was assured of their honest intent, I could do no-
thing
thing for them; but would take care, that what I
did should be for the women and children, without
them; and that unless they would give some assur-
ances that they would marry the women, I could
not think it was convenient they should continue to-
gether as man and wife; for that it was both scan-
dalous to men, and offensive to God, who they could
not think would bless them, if they wenc on thus.
All this passed as I expected; and they told me,
especially Will Atkins, who seemed now to speak for
the rest, that they loved their wives as well as if they
had been born in their own native country, and
would not leave them upon any account whatever;
and they did verily believe their wives were as vir-
tuous and as modest, and did, to the utmost of their
skill, as much for them, and for their children, as
any women could possibly do; and they would not
part with them on any account: And Will Atkinsx
for his own particular, added, if any man would
take him away, and offer to carry him home to
England, and to make him captain of the best man
of war in the navy, he would not go with him, if
he might not carry his wife and children with him;
and if there was a clergyman in the ship, he would
be married to her now, with all his heart.
This wras just as I would have it; the priest was
not with me at that moment, but was not sar off:
So, to try him sarther, I told him I had a clergyman
with me, and, if he was sincere, I would have him
married the next morning; and bade him consider
of it, and talk with the rest: He said, as for him-
self,
self, he need not consider of it at all; for he was very
ready to do it, and was glad I had a minister with
me; and he believed they would be all willing also.
I then told him, that my friend, the minister, was
a Frenchman, and could not speak English; but that
I would act the clerk between them. He never so
much as asked me whether he was a Papist or Pro-
testant; which was indeed what I was afraid of.
But, I say, they never enquired about it. So we
parted: I went back to my clergyman; and Will
Atkins went in to talk with his companions. I de-
sired the French gentleman not to say any thing to
them, till the business was thorough ripe; and I
told him what answer the men had given me.
Before I went from their quarter, they all came
to me, and told me, they had been considering what
I had said; that they were very glad to hear I had
a clergyman in my company; and they were very
willing to give me the satissaction I desired, and to
be formally married as soon as I pleased; for they
were sar from defiring to part from their wives; and
that they meant nothing but what was very honest,
when they chose them: so I appointed them to meet
me the next morning; and that, in the mean time,
they mould let their wives know the meaning of the
marriage law; and that it was not only to prevent
any scandal, but also to oblige them, that they
should not forsake them, whatever might happen.
The women were easily made sensible of the mean-
ing of the thing, and were very well satisfied with
it, as, indeed, they had reason to be; so they sailed
not to attend all together, at my apartment, the
next
*57
next morning, where I brought out my clergyman:
and though he had not on a minister's gown, after
the manner of England, or the habit of a priest,
after the manner of France; yet having a black
vest, something like a cassock, with a sash round it,
he did not look very unlike a minister; and as for
his language, I was interpreter.
But the seriousness of his behaviour to them, and
the scruples he made of marrying the women, be-
cause they were not baptized, and professed Chris-
tians, gave them an exceeding reverence for his
person; and there was no need after that to enquire
whether he was a clergyman or no.
Indeed I was afraid his scruple would have been
carried so sar, as that he would not have married
them at all: nay, notwithstanding all I was able to
say to him, he resisted me, though modestly, yet
very steadily; and at last, refused absolutely to
marry them, unless he had first talked with the men,
and the women too; and though at first I was a little
backward to it, yet at last I agreed to it with a
good will, perceiving the sincerity of his design.
When he came to them, he let them know that
I had acquainted him with their circumstances, and
with the present design; that he was very willing to
perform that part of his function, and marry them,
as I had defired; but that, before he could do it, he
must take the liberty to talk with them; he told
them, that in the sight of all different men, and in
the fense of the laws of society, they had lived all
this while in an open adultery; and that it was true,
that nothing but the consenting to marry, or effec-
tually
tually separating them from one another now, could
put an end to it; but there was a difficulty in it too,
with respect to the laws of Christian matrimony,
which he was, not fully satisfied about, viz. That of
marrying one that is a professed Christian, to a sa-
vage, an idolater and an heathen, one that is not
baptized; and yet that he did not fee, that there
was time left for it, to endeavour to persuade the
women to be baptized, or to profess the name of
Christ, whom they had, he doubted, heard no-
thing of, and without which they could not be
baptized.
He told me, he doubted they were but indifferent
Christians themselves; that they had but little know-
ledge of God, or his ways; and therefore he could
not expect, that they had said much to their wives on
that head yet; but that unless they would pro-
mise him to use their endeavours with their wives,
to persuade them to become Christians, and would
as well as they could instruct them in the knowledge
and belief of God that made them, and to worship
Jesus Christ that redeemed them, he could not marry
them; for he would have no hand in joining Chris-
tians with savages; nor was it consistent with the
principles of the Christian religion; and was, indeed,
expressly forbidden in God's law.
They heard all this very attentively, and I deli-
vered it very saithfully to them, from his mouth, as
near his own words as I could, only sometimes adding
something of my own, to convince them how just it
was, and how I was of his mind: And I always very
saithfully distinguished between what I said from
myself,
myself, and what were the clergyman's words. They
told me, it was very true what the gentleman had
said, that they were but very indisferent Christians
themselves, and that they had never talked to their
wives about religion: Lord, Sir, says Will Atkins,
how should we teach them religion? Why, we know
nothing ourselves; and besides, Sir, said he, should
we go to talk to them of God, and Jesus Christ, and
heaven and hell, it would be to make them laugh at
us, and ask us, what we believe ourselves? And if
we should tell them, we believe all the things that
we speak of to them, such as of good people going
to heaven, and wicked people to the devil, they
would ask us, where we intended to go ourselves,
who believe all this, and yet are such wicked fel-
lows, as we indeed are: Why, Sir, said Will, 'tis
enough to give them a surfeit of religion, at first
hearing: folks must have some religion themselves,
before they pretend to teach other people.—Will
Atkins, said I to him, though I am afraid what you
say has too much truth in it, yet can you not tell
your wife, that she is in the wrong? that there is a
God, and a religion better than her own; that her
gods are idols; that they can neither hear nor speak;
that there is a great Being that made all things, and
that can destroy all that he has made; that he re-
wards the good, and punishes the bad; that we are
to be judged by him, at last, for all we do here: you
are not so ignorant, but even nature itself will teach
you, that all this is true; and I am satisfied you know
it all to be true, and believe it yourself.
That's
That's true, Sir, said Atkins; but with what face
can I say any thing to my wife of all this, when she
will tell me immediately, it cannot be true?
Not true! said I,—what do you mean by that?
Why, Sir, said he, she will tell me it cannot be true,
that this God (I shall tell her of) can be just, or can
punish or reward, since I am not punished, and sent
to the devil, that have been such a wicked crea-
ture as she knows I have been, even to her, and to
every body else; and that I should be suffered to
live, that have been always acting so contrary to what
I must tell her is good, and to what I ought to
have done.
Why truly, Atkins, said I, I am afraid thou speakest
too much truth: and with that I let the clergyman
know what Atkins had said; for he was impatient to
know: O! said the priest, tell him there is one
thing will make him the best minister in the world
to his wife, and that is repentance; for none teach
repentance like true penitents: He wants nothing
but to repent, and then he will be so much the bet-
ter qualified to instruct his wife; he will then be
able to tell her, that there is not only a God, and
that he is the just rewarder of good and evil; but
that he is a merciful Being, and, with infinite good-
ness and long suffering, forbears to punish those that
offend; waiting to be gracious, and willing not the
death of a sinner, but rather that he should return
and live; that he often suffers wicked men to go on
a long time, and even reserves damnation to the ge-
neral day of retribution: that it is a clear evidence
of God, and of a future state, that righteous men
receive
receive not their reward, or wicked men their pu-
nishment, till they come into another world; and
this will lead him to teach his wife the doctrine of
the resurrection, and of the last judgment: let him
but repent for himself, he will be an excellent preacher
of repentance to his wife.
I repeated all this to Atkins, who looked very se-
rious all the while, and who, we could easily per-
ceive, was more than ordinarily affected with it:
* when being eager, and hardly suffering me to make
an end—I knew, all this, master, says he, and a
great deal more; but I han't the impudence to talk
thus to my wife: when God, and my own con-
science knows, and my wife will be an undeniable
evidence against me, that I have lived as if I had
never heard of God, or a future state, or any thing
about it; and to talk of my repenting, alas! (and
with that he fetched a deep sigh; and I could see
that tears stood in his eyes) 'tis past all that with me.
Past it! Atkins, said I: What dost thou mean by
that? I knQw well enough what I mean, Sir, says
he; I mean 'tis too late; and that is too true.
I told my clergyman word for word what he said:
the poor zealous priest (I must call him so; for be
his opinion what it will, he had certainly a most
singular affection for the good of other men's fouls;
and it would be hard to think he had not the like for
his own; I say, this zealous, affectionate man) could
not refrain tears also: But recovering himself, he
said to me, Aik him but one question: Is he easy
that it is too late, or is he troubled, and wishes it
were not so? I put the question sairly to Atkins;
Vol. II. M and.
and he answered with a great deal of passion, How
could any man be easy in a condition that certainly
must end in eternal destruction? That he was sar
from being easy; but that, on the contrary, he be-
lieved it would one time or the other ruin him.
What do you mean by that? said I. Why, he
said, he believed he should, one time or another,
cut his own throat, to put an end to the terror
of it.
The clergyman shook his head, with a great con-
cern in his sace, when I told him all this; but,
turning quick to me upon it, said, If that be his
case, you may assure him it is not too late; Christ
will give him repentance: But pray, says he, ex-
plain this to him, That as no man is saved but by
Christ, and the merit of his passion, procuring di-
vine mercy for him, how can it be too late for any
man to receive mercy? Does he think he is able to
sin beyond the power or reach of divine mercy? Pray
tell him, There may be a time when provoked mercy
will no longer strive, and when God may refuse to
hear; but that 'tis never too late for men to ask
mercy; and we that are Christ's servants are com-
manded to preach mercy at all times, in the name of
Jesus Christ, to all those that sincerely repent: so
that 'tis never too late to repent.
I told Atkins all this, and he heard me with great
earnestness; but it seemed as if he turned off the
discourse to the rest; for he said to me, he would
go and have some talk with his wife: so he went out
awhile, and we talked to the rest. I perceived they
were all stupidly ignorant, as to matters of religion;
much
much as I was when I went rambling away from
my sather: and yet that there were none of them
backward to hear what had been said; and all of
them seriously promised, that they would talk with
their wives about it, and do their endeavour to
persuade them to turn Christians.
The clergyman smiled upon me, when I reported
what answer they gave, but said nothing a good while;
but, at last, making his head, We that are Christ's
servants, says he, can go no sarther than to exhort
and instruct:; and when men comply, submit to the
reproof, and promise what we ask, 'tis all we can do;
we are bound to accept their good words; but, be-
lieve me, Sir, said he, whatever you may have known
of the life of that man you call William Atkins, I
believe he is the only sincere convert among them; I
take that man to be a true penitent; I won't despair
of the rest; but that man is perfectly struck with
the fense of his past life; and I doubt not, but when
he comes to talk of religion to his wife, he will
talk himself effectually into it; for attempting to
teach others is sometimes the' best way of teaching
ourselves. I knew a man, added he, who, having
nothing but a summary notion of religion himself,
and being wicked and profligate, to the last degree,
in his life, made a thorough reformation in himself,
by labouring to convert a Jew: And if that poor At-
kins begins but once to talk seriously of Jesus Christ
to his wife, my life for it, he talks himself into a
thorough convert, makes himself a penitent: and
who knows what may follow?
Upon this discourse, however, and their promising,
as above, to endeavour to persuade their wives to
M 2 embrace
embrace Christianity, he married the other thretf
couple; but Will Atkins and his wife were not yet
come in. After this, my clergyman, waiting a while,
was curious to know where Atkins was gone; and,
turning to me, says he, I intreat you, Sir, let us
walk out of your labyrinth here, and look; I dare
say we shall find this poor man somewhere or other,
talking seriously with his wife, and teaching her al-
ready something of religion. I began to be of the
same mind; so we went out together; and I carried
him a way which none knew but myself, and where
the trees were so thick set, as that it was not easy to
see through the thicket of leaves, and sar harder to
fee in, than to fee out; when coming to the edge of
the wood, I saw Atkins, and his tawny savage wise,
sitting under the shade of a bush, very eager in dis-
course: I stoppped short, till my clergyman came up
to me; and then, having shewed him where they
were, we stood and looked very steadily at them a
good while.
We observed him very earnest with her, pointing
up to the sun, and to every quarter of the heavens;
then down to the earth, then out to the sea, then to
himself, then to her, to the woods, to the trees.
Now, says my clergyman, you fee my words are
made good; the man preaches to her; mark him;
now he is telling her that our God has made him,
and her, and the heavens, the earth, the sea, the
woods, the trees, &c. I believe he is, said I. Im-
mediately we perceived Will Atkins start up upon his
feet, sall down upon his knees,and liftupbothhishands;
we supposed he said something, but we could not
hear him: it was too far osf for that: he did not
continue
»<>5
continue kneeling half a minute, but comes and sits
down again by his wife, and talks to her again. We
perceived then the woman very attentive; but whe-
ther she said any thing or no, we could not tell.
While the poor fellow was upon his knees, I could
fee the tears run plentifully down my clergyman's
cheeks; and I could hardly forbear myself; but it
was a great affliction to us both, that we were not
near enough to hear any thing that passed between
them.
Well, however, we could come no nearer, for
fear of disturbing them: so we resolved to see an end
of this piece of still conversation; and it spoke loud
enough to us, without the help of voice. He sat
down again, as I have said, close by her, and talked
again earnestly to her; and two or three times we
could fee him embrace her passionately; another time
we saw him take out his handkerchief, and wipe her
eyes, and then kiss her again, with a kind of trans-
port very unusual; and after several of these things,
we saw him on a sudden jump up again, and lend
her his hand to help her up; when immediately lead-
ing her by the hand a step or two, they both kneeled
down together, and continued so about two mi-
nutes.
My friend could bear it no longer, but cries out
aloud, St. Paul, St. Paul! behold he prayeth !—
I was afraid Atkins would hear him; therefore I in-
treated him to withhold himself awhile, that we
might see an end of the scene, which to me, I must
confess, was the most affecting, and yet the most
agreeable, that ever 1 saw in my life. Well, he
strove with himself, and contained himself for a
. M 3 - while,
while, but was in such raptures of joy to think that
the poor heathen woman was become a Christian,
that he was not able to contain himself; he wept
several times: then throwing up his hands, and
crossing his breast, said over several things ejacula-
tory, and by way of giving God thanks for so mi-
raculous a testimony of the success of our endea-
vours: some he spoke softly, and I could not well
hear; others audibly; some in Latin, some in French;
then two or three times the tears of joy would inter-
rupt him, that he could not speak at all. But I
begged that he would compose himself, and let us
more narrowly and fully observe what was before us,
which he did for a time, and the scene was not end-
ed there yet; for, after the poor man and his wife
were risen again from their knees, we observed he
stood talking still eagerly to her; and we observed
by her motion that she was greatly affected with what
he said, by her frequent lifting up her hands, laying
her hand to her breast, and such other postures, as
usually express the greatest seriousness and attention:
This continued about half a quarter of an hour, and
then they walked away too; so that we could fee
no more of them in that situation.
I took this interval to talk with my clergyman:
and first, I told him, I was glad to fee the particu-
lars we had both been witnesses to; that though I
was hard enough of belief in such cases, yet that I
began to think it was all very sincere here, both in
the man and his wife, however ignorant they both
might be; and I hoped such a beginning would have
yet a more happy end: and who knows, said I,
but these two may in time, by instruction and ex-
2 ample,
167
ample, work upon some of the others? Some of
them! said he, turning quick upon me, ay, upon
all of them: depend upon it, if those two savages
(for he has been but little better, as you relate it)
should embrace Jesus Christ, they wijl never leave
till they work upon all the rest; for true religion is
naturally communicative; and he that is once made
a Christian will never leave a pagan behind him, if
he can help it. I owned it was a most Christian
principle to think so, and a testimony of a true zeal,
as well as a generous heart in him. But, my friend,
said I, will you give me liberty to start one difficulty
here? I cannot tell how to object the least thing
against that affectionate concern which you shew for
the turning the poor people from their paganism to
the Christian religion; but how does this comfort
you, while these people are, in your account, out
of the pale of the Catholic church, without which,
you believe, there is no salvation; so that you esteem
these but heretics still; and, for other reasons, as ef-
fectually lost as the pagans themselves?
To this he answered with abundance of candour
and Christian charity, thus: Sir, I am a Catholic of
the Roman church, and a priest of the order of St.
Benedift, and I embrace all the principles of the Ro-
man saith: But yet, if you will believe me, and this
I do not speak in compliment to you, or in respect
to my circumstances, and your civilities; I say, ne-
vertheless, I do not look upon you, who call yourselves
reformed, without some charity: I dare not say,
tho' I know it is our opinion in genei al; yet I dare
not say, that you cannot be saved ; I will by no means
limit the mercy of Christ, so sar as to think that he
M 4 cannot
cannot receive you into the bosom of his church, in
a manner, to us, imperceivable, and which, it is
impossible tor us to know; and I hope you have the
same charity for us: I pray daily for your being all
restored to Christ's church, by whatsoever methods
he, who is all wife, is pleased to direct. In the
mean time, sure, you will allow it to consist with
me, as a Roman, to distinguish sar between a Pro.
testant and a Pagan: between him that calls on Jesus
Christ, though in a way which I do not think is ac-
cording to the true saith; and a savage, a barbarian,
that knows no God, no Christ, no Redeemer at all:
And if you are not within the pale of the Catholic
church, we hope you are nearer being restored to
it, than those that know nothing at all of God, or
his church. I rejoice, therefore, when I fee this poor
man, who, you say, has been a profligate, and al-
most a murderer, kneel down and pray to Jesus
Christ, as we suppose he did, though not fully en-
lightened; believing that God, from whom every
such work proceeds, will sensibly touch his heart,
and bring him to the further knowledge of the truth
in his own time: and if God shall influence this
poor man to convert and instruct the ignorant sa-
vage his wife, I can never believe that he shall be
cast away himself: and have I not reason then to
rejoice, the nearer any are brought to the knowledge
of Christ, though they may not be brought quite
home into the bosom of the Catholic church, just at
the time when I may defire it; leaving it to the
goodness of Christ to perfect his work in his own
time, and his own way? Certainly I would rejoice,
if all the savages in America were brought, like this
poor
poor woman, to pray to God, though they were to
be all Protestants at first, rather than they should con-
tinue pagans and heathens; firmly believing, that
he who had bestowed that first light upon them,
would sarther illuminate them with a beam of his
heavenly grace, and bring them into the pale of his
church, when he should fee good.
I was astonished at the sincerity and temper of this
truly pious Papist, as much as I was oppressed by the
power of his reasoning: and it presently occurred to
my thoughts, that if such a temper was universal,
we might be all Catholic Christians, whatever
church or particular profession we joined to, or
joined in; that a spirit of charity would soon work
us all up into right principles; and, in a word, as
he thought that the like charity would make us all
Catholics, so I told him, I believed, had all the
members of his church the like moderation, they
would soon be all Protestants: And there we left
that part, for we never disputed at all.
However, I talked to him another way; and,
taking him by the hand, My friend, said I, I wish
all the clergy of the Roman church were bleffed with
such moderation, and an equal share of your cha-
rity: I am entirely of your opinion; but I must
tell you, that if you should preach such doctrine
in Spain or Italy, they would put you into the in-
quisition.
It may be so, said he; I know not what they might
do in Spain and Italy; but I will not say they would
be the better Christians for that severity; for I
am sure there is no heresy in too much charity.
Well,
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
Well, as Will Atkins and his wife were gone,
our business there was over: so we went back our
own way; and when we came back, we found them
waiting to be called in. Observing this, I asked
my clergyman if we should discover to him that
we had seen him under the bush, or no; and it was
his opinion we should not; but that we should talk
to him first, and hear what he would say to us: so
we called him in alone, nobody being in the place
but ourselves; and I began with him thus:
Will Atkins, said I, prithee what education had
you? What was your sather?
W. A. A better man than ever I shall be. Sir,
my sather was a clergyman.
R. C. What education did he give you?
W. A. He would have taught me well, Sir; but
I despised all education, instruction, or correction,
iike a beast as I was.
R. C. It is true, Solomon says " he that despiseth
"reproof is brutish."
W. A. Ay, Sir, I was brutish indeed; I mur-
dered my sather: for God's sake, Sir, talk no more
about that, Sir; I murdered my poor sather.
Priest. Ha? a murderer!
[Here the priest started (fer I interpreted every word
as he spoke it) and looked pale: It seems he believed
that Will had really killed his own father.]
R. C. No, no, Sir, I do not understand him so.
Will Atkins, explain yourself: you did not kill your
father, did you, with your own hands?
W. A. No, Sir; I did not cut his throat; but I
cut the thread of all his comforts, and shortened
his
his days; I broke his heart by the most ungrate-
ful, unnatural return, for the most tender, asfection-
ate treatment that ever sather gave, or child could
receive.
R. C. Well, I did not ask you about your sather, to
extort this confession; I pray God give you repent-
ance for it, and forgive you that, and all your other
sins: but I asked you, because I see that though you
have not much learning, yet you are not so ignorant
as some are, in things that are good; that you have
known more of religion a great deal than you have
practised.
W. A. Though you, Sir, did not extort the con-
fession that I make about my sather, conscience does;
and whenever we come to look back upon our lives,
the fins against our indulgent parents are certainly .
the first that touch us; the wounds they make lie
deepest; and the weight they leave will lie heaviest
upon the mind of all the sins we can commit.
R. C. You talk too feelingly and sensible for me,
Atkins; I cannot bear it.
W. A. Tou bear it, master! I dare say you know
nothing of it.
R. C. Yes, Atkins; every shore, every hill, nay,
I may say, every tree in this island, is witness to the
anguish of my soul, for my ingratitude, and base
usage of a good tender sather; a sather much like
your's, by your description; and I murdered my
father as well as you, Will Atkins; but think, for
all that, my repentance is short of your's too, by a
great deal.
[I would have said more, is I could have restrained my
passions; but I thought this poor man's repentance
was
was so much fincerer than mine; that I was going to
leave off the discourse, and retire, for I was sur-
prised with what he said; and thought that instead
of my going about to teach and instruct him, the
man was made a teacher and instructor to me, in a
most surprising and unexpected manner.]
I laid all this before the young clergyman, who
was greatly affected with it, and said to me, Did I
not say, Sir, that when this man was converted, he
would preach to us all? I tell you, Sir, if this one
man be made a true penitent, here will be no need
of me; he will make Christians of all in the island.
But having a little composed myself, I renewed my
discourse with Will Atkins.
But, Will, said I, how comes the fense of this
matter to touch you just now?
W. A. Sir, you have set me about a work that
has struck a dart through my very foul; I have been
talking about God and religion to my wife, in order,
as you directed me, to make a Christian of her; and
she has preached such a fern jn to me as I mall never
forget while I live.
R. C. No, no; it is not your wife has preached
to you: but when you were moving religious argu-
ments to her, conscience has flung them back upon
you.
W. A. Ay, Sir, with such a force as is not to
be resisted.
R. C. Pray, Will, let us know what passed be-
tween you and your wife; for I know something of
it already.
W. A. Sir, it is impossible to give you a full ac-
count of it: I am too full to hold it, and yet have
no
Ho tongue to express it: but let her have said what
she will, and though I cannot give you an account
of it, this I can tell you of it, that I resolve to
amend and reform my life.
R. C. But tell us some of it. How did you be-
gin, Will? For this has been an extraordinary case,
that is certain; she has preached a sermon, indeed,
if she has wrought this upon you.
W. A. Why, I first told her the nature of our
laws about marriage, and what the reasons were that
men and women were obliged to enter into such
compacts, as it was neither in the power of one or
other to break; that otherwise, order and justice
could not be maintained, and men would run from
their wives, and abandon their children, mix con-
fusedly with one another, and neither samilies be
kept entire, or inheritances be settled by a legal de-
scent.
R. C. You talk like a civilian, Will. Could you
make her understand what you meant by inheri-
tance and samilies? They know no such thing
among the savages, but marry any how, without
any regard to relation, consanguinity, or samily;
brother and sister, nay, as I have been told, even
the sather and daughter, and the son and the mo-
ther.
W. A. I believe, Sir, you are misinformed;—
my wife assures me of the contrary, and that they
abhor it. Perhaps, for any further relations, they
may not be so exact as we are; but she tells me they
never touch one another in the near relations you
speak of.
R.C. Well,
R. C. Well, what did she say to what you told
her?
'W. A. She said she liked it very well; and it was
much better than in her country.
R. C. But did you tell her what marriage was?
W. A. Ay, ay, there began all our dialogue. I
asked her, If she would be married to me our way?
She asked me, What way that was? I told her mar-
riage was appointed of God; and here we had a
strange talk together indeed, as ever man and wife
had, I believe.
[N. B. This dialogue between W. Atkins and his wise,
as I took it down in writing, just aster he told it me,
was as follows:
Wife. Appointed by your God! Why, have you
a God in your country?
W. A. Yes, my dear, God is in every country?
Wife. No your God in my country; my country
have the great old Benamuckee God.
W. A. Child, I am very unsit to shew you who
God is; God is in heaven, and made the heaven
and the earth, the sea, and all that in them is.
Wife. No makee de earth; no you God makee
de earth; no make my country.
{W. A. laughed a little at her expression of God not
making her country.]
Wife. No laugh: Why laugh me? This no ting
to laugh.
[He was justly reproved by his wise; for she was more
serious than he at first. J
W. A. That's
W. A. That's true indeed; I will not laugh any
more, my dear.
Wife. Why you say, you God make all?
W. A. Yes, child, our God made the whole
world, and you, and me, and all things; for he is
the only true God; there is no God but he; he lives
for ever in heaven.
Wife. Why you no tell me long ago?
W. A. That's true indeed; but I have been a
wicked wretch, and have not only forgotten to ac-
quaint thee with any thing before, but have lived
without God in the world myself.
Wife. What have you de great God in your coun-
try, you no know him? No say O to him? No do
good ting for him? That no imposlible!
W. A. It is too true though, for all that: we live
as if there was no God in heaven, or that he had no
power on earth.
Wise. But why God let you do so? Why he no
makee you good live?
W. A. It is all our own fault.
Wife. But you say me, he is great, much great,
have much great power; can make kill when he
will: why he no makee kill when you no serve him?
No say O to him? No be good mans?
W. A. That is true; he might strike me dead,
and I ought to expect it; for I have been a wicked
wretch, that is true: but God is merciful, and does
not deal with us as we deserve.
Wife. But then, do not you tell God tankee for
that too?
W. A. No, indeed; I have not thanked God for
his mercy, any more than I have feared God for his
power.
Wife.
Wife. Then you God no God; me no think, be*
lieve he be such one, great much power, strong;
no makee kill you, though you makee him much
angry?
W. A. What! will my wicked life hinder you
from believing in God! What a dreadful creature
am I! And what a sad truth is it, that the horrid
lives of Christians hinder the conversion of heathens!
Wife. How me tink you have great much God up
there, (she points up to heaven,) and yet no do well,
no do good ting? Can he tell? Sure he no tell what
you do.
W. A. Yes, yes, he knows and fees all things; he
hears us speak, sees what we do, knows what we
think, though we do not speak.
Wife. What! he no hear you swear, curse, speak
the great damn?
W. A. Yes, yes, he hears it all.
Wife. Where be then the muchee great power
strong?
W. A. He is merciful; that is all we can say for
it; and this proves him to be the true God: He is
God, and not man; and therefore we are not con-
sumed.
[Here Will Atkins told us, he was struck with horror
to think how he could tell his wife so clearly, that
God fees, and hears, and knows the secret thoughts
of the heart, and all that we do; and yet that he
had dared to do all the vile things he had done.]
Wife. Merciful! what you call dat?
W. A. He is our sather and maker; and he pities
and spares us.
I Wife.
Wise. So then he never makee kill, never angry
when you do wicked; then he no good himself, or
no great able.
W. A. Yes, yes, my dear; he is insinitely good,
and infinitely great, and able to punish too; and
sometimes to shew his justice and vengeance, he lets
fly his anger to destroy sinners, and make examples;
many are cut osf in their sins.
Wise. But no makee kill you yet; then he tell
you, may be, that he no makee you kill, so you
make de bargain with him, you do bad ting, he
no be angry at you, when he be angry at other
mans?
W. A. No, indeed, my sins are all presumptions
upon his goodness; and he would be infinitely just,
is he destroyed me, as he has done other men.
Wise. Well, and yet no kill, no makee you dead I
What you say to him for that? You no tell him
tankee for all that too!
W. A. I am an unthankful, ungrateful dog, that
is true.
Wife. Why he no makee you much good better?
You say he makee you.
W. A. He made me as he made all the world;
*tis I have deformed myself, and abused his goodness,
and have made myself an abominable wretch.
Wise. I wish you makee God know me; I no
makee him angry; I no do bad wicked ting.
[Here Will Atkins said his heart funk within him, to
hear a poor, untaught creature, desire to be taught
to know God; and he such a wicked wretch, that
he could not say one word to her about God, but
what the reproach of his own carriage would make
Vol. II. N most:
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
most Irrational to her to believe; nay, that already
she could not believe in God, because he that was so
wicked was not destroyed.]
W. A. My dear, you mean you wish I could teach
you to know God, not God to know you; for he
knows you already, and every thought in your
heart.
Wise. Why then he know what I saw to you now;
he know me wish to know him; how shall me know
who makee me?
W. A. Poor creature, he must teach thee, I can-
not teach thee; I'll pray to him to teach thee to know
him; and to forgive me, that I am unworthy to
teach thee.
[The poor fellow was in such an agony at her desiring
him to make her know God, and her wishing to
know him, that, he said, he sell down on his knees
before her, and prayed to God to enlighten her
mind with the saving knowledge of Jesus Christ,
and to pardon his sins, and accept of his being the
unworthy instrument of instructing her in the prin-
ciples of religion; after which he fat down by her
again, and their dialogue went on.]
N. B. This was the time when we saw him kneel down
and lift up his hands.
Wife. What you put down the knee for? What
you hold up the hand for? What you say? Who
you speak to? What is that?
W. A. My dear, I bow my knees in token of my
submission to him that made me: I said O to him,
as you call it, and as you say your old men do to
their idol Benamuckee; that is, I prayed to him.
Wife.
Wise. What you say O to him for?
W. A. I prayed to him to open your eyes and
your understanding, that you may know him, and
be accepted by him.
Wise. Can he do that too?
W. A. Yes, he can; he can do all things.
Wise. But he no hear what you say?
W. A. Yes, he has bid us pray to him; and pro-
mised to hear us.
Wise. Bid you pray? When he bid you? How he
bid you? What you hear him speak?
W. A. No, we do not hear him speak; but he
has revealed himself many ways to us.
[Here he was at a great loss to make her understand
that God had revealed himself to us by his word;
and what his word was ; but at last he told it her thus:
W. A. God has spoken to some good men in for-
mer days, even from heaven, by plain words; and
God has inspired good men, by his Spirit; and they
have written all his laws down in a book.
Wise. Me no understand that: where is book?
W. A. Alas! my poor creature, I have not this
book; but I hope I shall, one time or other, get it
for you to read it.
[Here he embraced her with great affection; but with
inexpressible grief, that he had not a bible.]
Wise. But how you makee me know, that God
teachee them to write that book?
W. A. By the same rule that we know him to be
God.
Wise. What rule; what way you know?
N 2 W. A. Be-
W. A. Because he teaches and commands nothing
but what is good, righteous, and holy; and tends
to make us perfectly good,, as well as perfectly happy;
and because he forbids, and commands us to avoid
all that is wicked, that is evil in itself, or evil in its
consequences.
Wife. That me would understand, that me sain
fee; if he reward all good thing, punish all wicked
thing, he teachee all good thing, forbid all wicked
thing, he makee all thing, he give all thing; he
hear me when I say O to him, as you go to do just
now; he makee me good, if I wish be good; he
spare me, no makee kill me, when I no be good; all
this you say he do; yes, he be great God; me take,
think, believe, him be great God; me say O to him
too, with you, my dear.
Here the poor man said he could forbear no
longer; but raising her up, made her kneel by him;
and he prayed to God aloud, to instruct her in the
knowledge of himself,"by his Spirit; and that by
some good providence, if possible, she might some
time or other come to have a bible, that she might
read the word of God, and be taught by him to
know him*
[This was the time that we saw him list her up by the
hand, and saw him kneel down by her, as above.]
f .
They had several other discourses, it seems, after
this, too long to set down here; and particularly
she made him promise, that since he confessed his
own life had been a wicked, abominable course of
provocation against God, that he would reform it,
and not make God angry any more, lest he should
"2 make
make him dead, as me called it, and then she should
be left alone, and never be taught to know this God
better 4 and lest he should be miserable, as he had
told her wicked men should be after death.
This was a strange account, and very affecting to
us both, but particularly the young clergyman: he
was indeed wonderfully surprised with it .; but under
the greatest affliction imaginable, that he could not
talk to her; that he could not speak English to make
her understand him; and as she spoke but very
broken English, he could not understand her. How-
ever, he turned himself to me, and told me, that
he believed there must be more to do with this wo-
man than to marry her; I did not understand him
at first; but at length he explained himself; viz-
That she ought to be baptized.
I agreed with him in that part readily, and was for
going about it presently: No, no; hold, Sir, said
he, though I would have her baptized by all means,
yet I must observe, that Will Atkins., her husband, has
indeed brought her, in a wonderful manner, to be
willing to embrace a religious life; and has given
her just ideas of the being of a God, of his power,
justice, and mercy; yet I defire to know of him, if
he has said any thing to her of Jesus Christ, and of
the salvation of sinners; of the nature of saith in
him4 and the redemption by him.; of the holy Spi-
rit, the resurrection, the last judgment, and a fu-
ture state.
I called Will Atkins again, and asked him; bat the
poor fellow fell immediately into tears, and told us;
he had laid something to her of all those things, but
that he was himself so wicked a creature, and his
N 3 own
own conscience so reproached him with his horrid,
ungodly life, that he trembled at the apprehensions,
that her knowledge of him should lessen the attention
she should give to those things, and make her rather
contemn religion, than receive it: but he was as-
sured, he said, that her mind was so disposed to re-
ceive due impressions of all those things, that if I
would but discourse with her, she would make it
appear to my satissaction, that my labour would not
be lost upon her.
Accordingly I called her in, and placing myself
as interpreter, between my religious priest and the
woman, I entreated him to begin with her: but sure
such a sermon was never preached by a popish priest
in these latter ages of the world; and, as I told him,
I thought he had all the zeal, all the knowledge, all
the sincerity of a Christian, without the errors of a
Roman Catholic; and that s took him to be such a
clergyman as the Roman bishops were, before the
church of Rome assumed spiritual sovereignty over
the consciences of men.
In a word, he brought the poor woman to em-
brace the knowledge of Christ, and of redemption
by him, not with wonder and astonishment only, as
slie did the first notions of a God, but with joy and
saith, with an affection, and a surprising degree of
understanding, scarce to be imagined, much less to
be expressed; and at her own request she was bap-
tized.
When he was preparing to baptize her, I en-
treated him, that he would perform that office with
some caution, that the man might not perceive he
was of the Roman church, if possible; because of
other
other ill consequences which might attend a difference
among us in that very religion which we were in-
structing the other in. He told me, that as he had
no consecrated chapel, nor proper things for the
office, I should see he would do it in a manner, that
I should not know by it that he was a Roman Ca-
tholic myself, if I had not known it before: and
so he did; for saying only some words over to him-
self in Latin, which I could not understand, he poured
a whole dish full of water upon the woman's head,
pronouncing in French very loud, Mary; which was
the name her husband defired me to give her, for I
was her god-sather, / baptize thee in the name of
the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost;
so that none could know any thing by it, what reli-
gion he was of: he gave the benediction afterwards
in Latin; but either Will Atkins did not know but it
was in French, or else did not take notice of it at
that time.
As soon as this was over, he married them; and
after the marriage was over, he turned himself to
Will Atkins, and in a very affectionate manner ex-
horted him not only to persevere in that good dispo-
sition he was in, but to support the convictions that
were upon him, by a resolution to reform his life:
told him, it was in vain to say he repented, if he
did not forsake his crimes; represented to him, how
God had honoured him with being the instrument
of bringing his wife to the knowledge of the Chris-
tian religion; and that he should be careful he did
not dishonour the grace of God; and that, if he
did, he would see the heathen a better Christian than
N 4 himself;
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
himself; the savage converted, and the instrument
cast away!
He said a great many good things to them both,
and then recommended them, in a few words, to
God's goodness; gave them the benediction again,
I repeating every thing to them in English: And thus
ended the ceremony. I think it was the most plea-
sant, agreeable day to me, that ever I passed in my
whole life.
But my clergyman had not done yet; his thoughts
hung continually upon the conversion of the 37 sa-
vages? and sain he would have staid upon the island
to have undertaken it: but I convinced him, First,
that his undertaking was impracticable in itself; and
secondly, that, perhaps, I could put it into a way of
being done, in his absence, to his satissaction; of
which by and by.
Having thus brought the affair of the island to a
narrow compass, I was preparing to go on board the
ship, when the young man, whom I had taken out
of the samished ship's company, came to me, and
told me, he understood I had a clergyman with me,
and that I had caused the Englishmen to be married to
the savages, whom they called wives; that he had a
match too, which he defired might be finished before
I went, between two Christians; which he hoped
would not be disagreeable to me.
I knew this must be the young woman who was
his mother's servant, for there was no other Christian
woman on the island; so I began to persuade him
not to do any thing of that kind rashly, or because
he found himself in this solitary circumstance: I re-
presented, that he had some considerable substance in
the
the world, and good friends, as I understood by him-
self, and by his maid also; that the maid was not only
poor, and a servant, but was unequal to him, she
being twenty-six or twenty-seven years old, and he
not above seventeen or eighteen; that he might very
probably, with my assistance, make a remove from
this wilderness, and come into his own country again;
and that then it would be a thousand to one but he
would repent his choice; and the dislike of that cir-
cumstance might be disadvantageous to both. I was
going to say more, but he interrupted me, smiling;
and told me, with a great deal of modesty, that I
mistook in my guesses; that he had nothing of
that kind in his thoughts, his present circum-
stances being melancholy and disconsolate enough;
and he was very glad to hear, that I had some
thoughts of putting them in a way to fee their
own country again; and that nothing should have
set him upon staying there, but that the voyage I
was going was so exceeding long and hazardous, and
would carry him quite out of the reach of all his
friends; that he had nothing to defire of me, but
that I would settle him in some little property in the
island where he was; give him a servant or two, and
some few necessaries, and he would fettle himself
here like a planter, waiting the good time when, if
ever I returned to England, I would redeem him,
and hoped I would not be unmindful of him when I
came to England; that he would give me some letters
to his friends in London, to let them know how good
I had been to him, and what part of the world, and
what circumstances I had left him in; and he pro-
mised me, that whenever I redeemed him, the plan-
tation,
tation, and all the improvements he had made upon
it, let the value be what it would, should be wholly
mine.
His discourse was very prettily delivered, consi-
dering his youth; and was the more agreeable to
me, because he told me. positively the match was not
for himself. I gave him all possible assurances, that
if I lived to come safe to England, I would deliver
his letters, and do his business effectually; and that
he might depend I would never forget the circum-
stances I left him in; but still I was impatient to
know who was the person to be married: Upon
which he told me it was my Jack of all Trades, and
his maid Susan.
I was most agreeably surprised when he named
the match; for indeed I had thought it very suita-
ble. The character of that man I have given al-
ready; and as for the maid, she was a very honest,
modest, sober, and religious young woman; had a
very good share of fense; was agreeable enough in
her person; spoke very handsomely, and to the pur-
pose; always with decency and good manners, and
not backward to speak when any thing required it,
or impertinently forward to speak when it Was not
her business; very handy and housewifely in any
thing that was before her; an excellent manager,
and fit indeed to have been governess to the whole
island; she knew very well how to behave herself to
all kind of folks she had about her, and to better, if
she had found any there.
The match being proposed in this manner, we
married them the same day; and, as I was sather
at the; altar, as I may say, and gave her away, so I
gave
gave her a portion; for I appointed her and her hus-
band a handsome large space of ground for their
plantation; and, indeed, this match, and the pro-
posal the young gentleman made to me, to give him
a small property in the island, put me upon parcel-
ling it out among them, that they might not quarrel
afterwards about their situation.
This sharing out the land to them I left to Will
Atkins, who, indeed, was now grown a most sober,
grave, managing fellow; perfectly reformed, exceed-
ing pious and religious; and, as sar as I may be al-
lowed to speak positively in such a case, I verily be-
lieve, was a true sincere penitent.
He divided things so justly, and so much to every
one's satissaction, that they only defired one general
writing under my hand for the whole; which I caused
to be drawn up, and signed and sealed to them, set-
ting out the bounds and situation of every man's
plantation, and testifying, that I gave them thereby,
severally, a right to the whole possession and inhe-
ritance of the respective plantations or sarms, with
their improvements, to them and their heirs; re-
serving all the rest of the island as my own property,
and a certain rent for every particular plantation,
after eleven years, if I, or any one from me, or in
my name, came to demand it, producing an attested
copy of the same writing.
As to the government and laws among them, I
told them, I was not capable of giving them better
rules than they were able to give themselves; only
made them promise me, to live in love and good
neighbourhood with one another: And so I prepared
to leave them.
One
i88
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
One thing I must not omit; and that is, that being
now settled in a kind of commonwealth among them-
selves, and having much business in hand, it was
but odd to have seven-and-thirty Indians live in a
nook of the island, independent, and, indeed, un-
employed; for, excepting the providing themselves
food, which they had disficulty enough in doing some-
times, they had no manner of business or property
to manage: I proposed therefore to the governor
Spaniard, that he should go to them with Friday's
father, and propose to them to remove, and either
plant for themselves, or take them into their several
families as servants, to be maintained for their la-
bour, but without being absolute slaves; for I would
not admic them to make them slaves by force, by
any means, because they had their liberty given by
capitulation, and, as it were, articles of surrender,
which they ought not to break.
They most willingly embraced the proposal, and
came all very chearfully along with him; so we al-
lotted them land and plantations, which three or
four accepted of, but all the rest chose to be em-
ployed as servants in the several samilies we had set-
tled; and thus my colony was in a manner settled,
as follows: The Spaniards possessed my original ha-
bitation, which was the capital city, and extended
their plantation all along the side of the brook,
which made the creek that I have so often described,
as far as my bower; and as they increased their cul-
ture, it went always eastward; the Englft lived in
the north-east part, where Will Atkins and his com-
rades began, and came on southward and south-
west, towards the back part of the Spaniards; and
every
189
every plantation had a great addition of land to take
in, if they found occasion; so that they need not
jostle one another for want of room.
All the west end of the isiand was left uninhabited,
that if any of the savages should come on more there,
only for their usual customary barbarities, they might
come and go; if they disturbed nobody, nobody
would disturb them ; and no doubt but they were
often ashore, and went away again; for I never heard
that the planters were ever attacked and disturbed any
more.
It now came into my thoughts, that I had hinted
to my friend the clergyman, that the work of con-
verting the savages might, perhaps, be set on foot in
his absence, to his satissaction; and I told him, that
now I thought it was put in a sair way; for the sa-
vages being thus divided among the Christians, if
they would but every one of them do their part with
those which came under their hands, I hoped it might
have a very good effect.
He agreed presently in that: If, said he, they will
do their part; but how, says he, shall we obtain that
of them? I told him, we would call them all together,
and leave it in charge with them, or go to them one
by one, which he thought best; so we divided it;
he to speak to the Spaniards, who were all Papists;
and I to the English, who were all Protestants; and
we recommended it earnestly to them, and made
them promise, that they would never make any dis-
tinction of Papist or Protestant, in their exhorting
the savages to turn Christians; but teach them the
general knowledge of the true God, and of their Sa-
viour
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
viour Jesus Christ; and they likewise promised us,
that they would never have any differences or dis-
putes, one with another, about religion.
When I came to Will Atkins's house (I may call it
so; for such a house, or such a piece of basket-work,
I believe was not standing in the world again !) I fay,
when I came thither, I found the young woman I
have mentioned above, and William Atkins's wife,
were become intimates; and this prudent, religious
young woman, had perfected the work Will Atkins
had begun; and though it was not above four days
after what I have related, yet the new-baptized sa-
vage woman was made such a Christian, as I have
seldom heard of any like her, in all my observation
or conversation in the world.
It came next into my mind, in the morning, be-
fore I went to them, that among all the needful
things I had to leave with them, I had not left a
bible; in which I shewed myself less considering for
them, than my good friend the widow was for me,
when she sent me the cargo of iool. from Lisbon,
where she packed up three bibles and a prayer-book.
However, the good woman's charity had a greater
extent than ever she imagined; for they were re-
served for the comfort and instruction of those that
made much better use of them than I had done.
I took one of the bibles in my pocket, and when
I came to William Atkins's tent, or house, I found the
young woman, and Atkins's baptized wife, had been
discoursing of religion together; ("for William Atkins
told it me, with a greal deal of joy.) I asked, if they
were together now? And he said yes ; so I went
into the house, and he with me, and we found them
together,
4
together, very earneO: in discourse: O, Sir, says Wil-
liam Atkins, when God has sinners to reconcile
to himself, and aliens to bring home, he ne-
ver wants a messenger: My wife has got a new
instructor; I knew I was unworthy, as I was incapa-
ble of that work; that young woman has been sent
hither from Heaven; she is enough to convert a
whole island of savages. The young woman blushed,
and rose up to go away, but I defired her to sit still;
I told her she had a good work upon her hands, and
I hoped God would bless her in it.
We talked a little, and I did not perceive they
had any book among them, though I did not ask;
but I put my hand in my pocket, and pulled out my
bible; Here, said 1 to Atkins, I have brought you
an assistant, that, perhaps, you had not before. The
man was so confounded, that he was not able to
speak for some time; but recovering himself, he
takes it with both hands, and, turning to his wife,
Here, my dear, says he, did not I tell you, our
God, though he lives above, could hear what we
said? Here is the book I prayed for, when you and
I kneeled down under the bush; now God has heard
us and sent it. When he had said thus, the man
fell into such transport of a passionate joy, that be-
tween the joy of having it, and giving God thanks
for it, the tears ran down his sace like a child that
was crying.
The woman was surprized, and was like to have
run into a mistake, that none of us were aware of;
for she firmly believed God had sent the book upon
her husband's petition: It is true, that providentially
it was so, and might be taken so in a consequent
sense;
sense; but I believed it would have been no difficult
matter, at that time, to have persuaded the poof
woman to have believed, that an express messenger
came from heaven, on purpose to bring that indivi-
dual book; but it was too serious a matter to suffer
any delusion to take.place: So I turned to the
young woman, and told her, we did not desire to
impose upon the new convert, in her first and more
ignorant understanding of things; and begged her
to explain to her, that God may be very properly
said to answer our petitions, when in the course of
his Providence, such things are, in a particular
manner, brought to pass, as we petitioned for; but
we do not expect returns from Heaven, in a miracu-
lous and particular manner; and that it is our mercy
it is not so.
This the young woman did afterwards effectually;
so that there was, I assure you, no priestcraft used
here; and I mould have thought it one of the most
unjustifiable frauds in the world, to have had it so:
but the surprize of joy upon Will Atkins, is really
not to be expressed; and there, we may be sure, was
no delusion. Sure no man was ever more thankful
in the world for any thing of its kind, than he was
for this bible; and I believe, never any man was
glad of a bible from a better principle; and though
he had been a most profligate creature, desperate,
headstrong, outrageous, furious, and wicked to a
great degree; yet this man is a standing rule to us
all, for the well instructing children; viz. That pa-
rents mould never give over to teach and instruct, or
ever despair of the success of their endeavours,. let
the children be ever so obstinate, refractory, or, to
appear-
appearance, insensible of instruction; for if ever
God in his Providence touches the consciences of
such, the force of their education returns upon them,
and the early instruction of parents is not lost,
though it may have been many years laid afleep;
but, some time or other, they may find the benefit
of it.
Thus it was with this poor man. However igno-
rant he was, or divested of religion and Christian
knowledge, he found he had some to do with now more
ignorant than himself; and that the least part of the
instruction of his good father, that could now come
to his mind, was of use to him.
Among the rest it occurred to him, he said, how
his sather used to insist much upon the inexpressible
value of the bible; the privilege and blessing of it
to nations, samilie:, and persons; but he never en-
tertained the least notion of the worth of it till now;
when, being to talk to heathens, savages, and bar-
barians, he wanted the help of the written oracle for
his assistance.
The young woman was very glad of it also, for
the present occasion, though she had one; and so
had the youth on board our ship, among the goods
which were not yet brought on shore. And now,
having said so many things of this young woman, I
cannot omit telling one story more of her and my-
self, which has something in it very informing and
remarkable.
I have related to what extremity the poor young
woman was reduced; how her mistress was
starved to death, and did die, on board that un-
happy ship we met at sea; and how the whole ship's
Vol. II. O company
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
company being reduced to the last extremity, ths
gentlewoman, and her son, and this maid, were first
hardly used, as to provisions; and, at last, totally
neglected and starved -r that is to fay, brought to
the last extremity of hunger.
One day, being discoursing with her upon the ex-
tremities they suffered, I asked her, if she could de-
scribe, by what she felt, what it was to starve, and
how it appeared? She told me, she believed she
could; and she told her tale very distinctly thus:
First, Sir, said she, we had for some days fared
exceeding hard, and suffered very great hunger; but
now, at last, we were wholly without food of any
kind, except sugar, and a little wine, and a little
water. The first day after I had received no food
at all, I found myself, towards evening, first empty
and sickish at my stomach; and nearer night, migh-
tily inclined to yawning, and sleepy; I laid down
on a couch in the great cabin, to sleep; and slept
about three hours, and awaked a little refreshed,
having taken a glass of wine when I lay down: after
being about three hours awake, it being about five
o'clock in the morning, I found myself empty, and
my stomach sickish again, and laid down again; but
could not sleep at all, being very saint and ill: and
thus I continued all the second day, with a strange
variety \ first hungry, then sick again, with Teachings,
to vomit: the second night, being obliged to go to
bed again, without any food more than a draught of
fair water, and being asleep, I dreamed I was at
Barbadocs, and that the market was mightily stocked
with provisions; that I bought some for my mistress,
and went and dined very heartily.
2 I thought
I thought my stomach was full after this, as it
'would have been after, or at, a good dinner; but
when I waked, I was exceedingly funk in my spirits
to find myself in the extremity of samine: the last
glass of wine we had, I drank, and put sugar into
it, because of its having some spirit to supply nou-
rishment; but there being no substance in the sto-
mach for the digesting office to work upon, I found
the only effect of the wine was, to raise disagreeable
fumes from the stomach into the head; and I lay,
as they told me, stupid and senseless, as one drunk,
for some time.
The third day in the morning, after a night of
strange and confused inconsistent dreams, and rather
dozing than sleeping, I awaked, ravenous and fu-
rious with hunger; and I question, had not my un-
derstanding returned, and conquered it; I say, I
question whether, if I had been a mother, and had
had a little child with me, its life would have been
safe or no.
This lasted about three hours; during which time
I was twice raging mad, as any creature in Bedlam,
as my young master told me, and as he can now in-
form you.
In one of these fits of lunacy, or distraction, whe-
ther by the motion of the ship, or some slip of my
foot, I know not; I fell down, and struck my sace
against the corner of a pallet-bed, in which my mis-
tress lay; and with the blow the blood gushed out
of my nose; and the cabin-boy bringing me a little
bason, I sat down and bled into it a great deal; and
as the blood ran from me, I came to myself; and the
O 2 violence
violence of the dame, or the fever I was in, abated,
and so did the ravenous part of the hunger.
Then I grew sick, and reached to vomit, but could
not; for I had nothing in my stomach to bring up;
after I had bled some time, I swooned, and they all
believed I was dead; but I came to myself soon af-
ter, and then had a most dreadful pain in my sto-
mach, not to be described; not like the cholic, but a
gnawing eager pain for food; and, towards night,
it went off with a kind of earnest wishing or longing
for food; something like, as I suppose, the long-
ing of a woman with child. I took another draught
of water, with sugar in it, but my stomach loathed
the sugar, and brought it all up again: Then I took
a draught of water, without sugar, and that stayed
with me; and I laid me down upon the bed, pray-
ing most heartily, that it would please God to take
me away; and composing my mind in hopes of it, I
slumbered awhile; and then waking, thought my-
self dying, being light with vapours from an empty
stomach: I recommended my foul to God, and ear-
nestly wished that somebody would throw me into
the sea.
All this while my mistress lay by me, just, as I
thought, expiring; but bore it with much more pa-
tience than I, and gave the last bit of bread she had
to her child, my young master, who would not have
taken it, but she obliged him to eat it; and, I believe,
it saved his life.
Towards the morning, I slept again; and first,
when I awaked, I fell into a violent passion of cry-
ing; and after that, had a second fit of violent hun-
ger, so that I got up ravenous, and in a most dread-
1 ful
ful condition: Had my mistress been dead, as much
as I loved her, I am certain I mould have eaten a
piece of her flesh with as much relish, and as uncon-
cerned, as ever I did the flesti of any creature ap-
pointed for food; and once or twice I was going to
bite my own arm. At last, I saw the bason, in
which was the blood I had bled at my nose the day
before; I ran to it, and swallowed it with such haste,
and such a greedy appetite, as if I had wondered
nobody had taken it before, and afraid it should be
taken from me now.
Though after it was down the thoughts of it silled
me with horror, yet it checked the fit of hunger;
and I drank a draught of sair water, and was composed
and refreshed for some hours after it. This was the
fourth day; and thus I held it till towards night,
when, within the compass of three hours, I had all
these several circumstances over again, one after ano-
ther; viz. sick, sleepy, eagerly hungry, pain in the
stomach, then ravenous again, then sick again, then
lunatic, then crying, then ravenous again, and so
every quarter of an hour; and my strength wasted
exceedingly. At night I laid me down, having no
comfort, but in the hope that I should die before
morning.
All this night I had no sleep, but the hunger was
now turned into a disease; and I had a terrible cho-
lic and griping; wind, instead of food, having found
its way into the bowels; and in this condition I lay
till morning, when I was surprized a little with
the cries and lamentations of my young master, who
called out to me, that his mother was dead. I lifted
O 3 myself
myself up a little, for I had not strength to rise, but
found she was not dead, though she was able to give
very little signs of life.
1 had then such convulsions in my stomach, for
want of some sustenance, that I cannot describe them;
with such frequent throes and pangs of appetite, that
nothing but the tortures of death can imitate; and
this condition I was in, when I heard the seamen
above cry put, A sail! a sail! and halloo and jump
about as if they were distracted.
I was not able to get off from the bed, and my
mistress much less; and my master was so sick, that
J thought he had been expiring; so we could not
open the cabin door, or get any account what it
was that occasioned such a combustion; nor had we
any conversation with the ship's company for two
days, they having told us they had not a mouthful
of any thing to eat in the ship; and they told us
afterwards, they thought we had been dead.
It was this dreadful condition we were in when
you were sent to save our lives; and how you found
us, Sir, you know as well as I, and better too.
This was her own relation, and is such a distinct
account of starving to death, as, I confess, I never
met with, and was exceeding entertaining to me:
I am the rather apt to believe it to be a true account,
because the youth gave me an account of a good part
of it; though I must own, not so distinct, and so
feelingly as his maid; and the rather, because, it
seems, his mother fed him at the price of her own
life: but the poor maid, though her constitution
being stronger than that of her mistress, who was in
years.,
199
years, and a weakly woman too, me might struggle
harder with it; I say, the poor maid might be sup-
posed to feel the extremity something sooner than
her mistress, who might be allowed to keep the last
bits something longer than she parted with any to
relieve the maid. No question, as the case is here
related, if our ship, or some other, had not so provi-
dentially met them, a few days more would have
ended all their lives, unless they had prevented it by
eating one another; and even that, as their case
stood, would have served them but a little while,
they being 500 leagues from any land, or any possi-
bility of relief, other than in the miraculous manner
it happened.—But this is by the way; I return to my
disposition of things among the people.
And first, it is to be observed here, that for many
reasons, I did not think fit to let them know any
thing of the sloop I had framed, and which I thought of
setting up among them; for I found, at least at my
first coming, such seeds of division among them)
that I saw it plainly, had I set up the sloop, and lest
it among them, they would, upon very light disgust,
have separated, and gone away from one another;
or perhaps have turned pirates, and so made the
island a den of thieves, instead of a plantation of so-
ber and religious people, as I intended it to be; nor
did I leave the two pieces of brass cannon that I had
on board, or the two quarter deck guns, that my
nephew took extraordinary, for the same reason: I
thought they had enough to qualify them for a de-
fensive war, against any that should invade them; but
J. was not to set them up for an offensive war, or to
O $ encourage
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
encourage them to go abroad to attack others, which,
in the end, would only bring ruin and destruction
upon themselves and all their undertakings: I re-
served the sloop, therefore, and the guns, for their
service another way, as I shall observe in its place.
I have now done with the island: I left them all
in good circumstances, and in a flourishing condi-
tion, and went on board my ship again the fifth day
of May, having been five-and-twenty days among
them; and, as they were all resolved to stay upon
the island till I came to remove them, I promised to
send some further relief from the Brasils, if I could
possibly find an opportunity; and particularly I pro-
mised to send them some cattle; such as sheep, hogs,
and cows; for as to the two cows and calves which
I brought from England, we had been obliged, by
the length of our voyage, to kill them at sea, for
want of hay to feed them.
The next day, giving them a salute of five guns
at parting, we set sail, and arrived at the bay of All
Saints, in the Brafils, in about twenty-two days;
meeting nothing remarkable in our passage but this,
That about three days after we sailed, being becalmed,
and the current setting strong to the N. N. E. run-
ning, as it were, into a bay or gulph, on the land-
side, we were driven something out of our course;
and once or twice our men cried Land, to the west-
ward; but whether it was the continent, or islands,
we could not tell by any means.
But the third day, towards evening, the sea smooth
and the weather calm, we saw the sea, as it were,
covered, towards the land, with something very
black,
black, not being able to discover what it was; but,
after some time, our chief mate going up the main
lhrouds a little way, and looking at them with a per-
spective, cried out, it was an army. I could not
imagine what he meant by an army, and spoke a little
hastily, calling the fellow a fool, or some such word;
Nay, Sir, says he, don't be angry, for it is an army,
and a fleet too; for I believe there are a thousand
canoes, and you may fee them paddle along, and
they are coming towards us too apace, and full of
men.
1 was a little surprised then, indeed, and so was
my nephew the captain; for he had heard such ter-
rible stories of them in the island, and having never
been in those seas before, that he could not tell what
to think of it, but said two or three times, we should
all be devoured. I must confess, considering we
were becalmed, and the current set strong towards the
shore, I liked it the worse; however, I bade him not
be afraid, but bring the ship to an anchor, as soon
as we came so near as to know that we must engage
them.
The weather continued calm, and they came on
apace towards us; sol gave orders to come to an an-
chor, and furl all our sails. As for the savages,
I told them they had nothing to fear from them but
fire; and therefore they should get their boats out,
and sasten them, one close by the head, and the other
by the stern, and man them both well, and wait the
issue in that posture: this I did, that the men in the
boats might be ready, with sheet arid buckets, to put
out
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
out any fire these savages might endeavour to six upon
the outside of the ship.
In this posture we lay by for them, and in a little
while they came up with us, but never was such a
horrid sight seen by Christians: My mate was much
mistaken in his calculation of their number, I mean
of a thousand canoes; the most we could make of
them when they came up, being about 126; and a
great many of them too; for some of them had six-
teen or seventeen men in them, some more, and the
least six or seven.
When they came nearer to us, they seemed to be
struck with wonder and astonishment, as at a sight
which they had, doubtless, never seen before; nor
could they, at first, as we afterwards understood,
know what to make of us. They came boldly up
however, very near to us, and seemed to go about
to row round us; but we called to our men in the
boats, not to let them come too near them.
This very order brought us to an engagement with
them, without our designing it; for five or six of
their large canoes came so near our long-boat, that
our men beckoned with their hands to them to keep
back; which they understood very well, and went
back; but at their retreat about 500 arrows came on
board us from those boats; and one of our men in
the long-boat was very much wounded.
However, I called to them not to fire by any means;
but we handed down some deal boards into the boat,
and the carpenter presently set up a kind of a fence,
like waste boards, to cover them from the arrows of
the savages, if they mould shoot again.
About
About half an hour afterwards they came all up in a
body astern of us, and pretty near, so near that we
could easily discern what they were, though we could
not tell their design, I easily found they were some
of my old friends, the same sort of savages that I
had been used to engage with; and in a little time
more they rowed somewhat sarther out to sea, till
they came directly broadside with us, and then rowed
down straight upon us, till they came so near,
that they could hear us speak: Upon this, I ordered
all my men to keep close, lest they should shoot any
more arrows, and make all our guns ready; but
being so near as to be within hearing, I made Friday
go out upon the deck, and call out aloud to them
in his language, to know what they meant; which
accordingly he did: whether they understood him
or not, that I know not; but, as soon as he had
called to them, six of them, who were in the fore-
most, or nighest boat to us, turned their canoes from
us; and, stooping down, shewed us their naked
backsides ; just as if, in English, (saving your pre-
sence) they had bid us kiss . Whether
this was a defiance or challenge, we know not; or
whether it was done in mere contempt, or a signal
to the rest; but immediately Friday cried out, They
were going to shoot; and unhappily for him (poor
fellow) they let fly about 300 of their arrows; and,
to my inexpressible grief, killed poor Friday, no other
man being in their sight. The poor fellow was shot
with no less than three arrows, and about three more
fell very nigh him; such unlucky marksmen they
were!
I was
I was so enraged with the loss of my old servant,
the companion of all my sorrows and solitudes, that
I immediately ordered five guns to be loaded with
small mot, and four with great; and gave them such
a broadside as they had never had in their lives be-
fore, to be sure.
They were not above half a cable's length off
when we fired; and our gunners took their aim so
well, that three or four of their canoes were over-
set, as we had reason to believe, by one mot only.
The ill manners of turning up their bare backsides
to us, gave us no great offence; neither did I know
for certain whether that, which would pass for the
greatest contempt among us, might be understood so
by them or not; therefore in return, I had only re-
solved to have fired four or five guns with powder
only, which I knew would fright them susficiently:
but when they mot at us directly with all the fury they
were capable of, and especially as they had killed my
poor Friday, whom I so entirely loved and valued,
and who, indeed, so well deserved it; I not only had
been justified before God and man, but would have
been very glad, if I could, to have overset every
canoe there, and drowned every one of them.
I can neither tell how many we killed, or how
many we wounded, at this broadside; but sure such
a fright and hurry never was seen among such a
multitude: there were thirteen or fourteen of their
canoes split, and overset, in all; and the men all set
a swimming; the rest, frighted out of their wits,
scoured away as sast as they could, taking but little
care to save those whose boats were split or spoiled
with our shot: so I suppose that they were many of
them
them loll; and our men took up one poor fellow
swimming for his life, above an hour after they were
all gone.
Our small shot from our cannon must needs kill
and wound a great many; but, in short, we never
knew any thing how it went with them; for they
tied so sast, that, in three hours, or thereabouts, we
could not fee above three or four straggling canoes;
nor did we ever see the rest any more; for a breeze
of wind springing up the same evening, we weighed
and set sail for the Brasih.
We had a prisoner indeed, but the creature was
so sullen, that he would neither eat or speak; and
we all sancied he would starve himself to death; but
I took a way to cure him; for I made them take
him, and turn him into the long-boat, and make him
believe they would toss him into the sea again, and
so leave him where they found him, if he would not
speak: nor would that do, but they really did throw
him into the sea, and came away from him; and then
he followed them, for he swam like a cork, and
called to them in his tongue, though they knew not
one word of what he said. However, at last, they
took him in again, and then he began to be more
tractable; nor did I ever design they should drown
him.
We were now under sail again; but I was the most
disconsolate creature alive, for want of my man
Friday, and would have been very glad to have gone
back to the island, to have taken one of the rest
from thence for my occasion, but it could not be;
so we went on. We had one prisoner, as 1 have said;
and it was a long while before we could make him
understand
io6 Life and adventures
understand any thing; but, in time, our men taught
him some English, and he began to be a little tracta-
ble: Afterwards we enquired what country he came
from, but could make nothing of what he said; for
his speech was so odd, all gutturals, and spoken in
the throat , in such an hollow and odd manner, that
we could never form a word from him; and we were
all of opinion that they might speak that language
as well, if they were gagged, as otherwise; nor
could we perceive that they had any occasion either
for teeth, tongue, lips, or palate; but formed their
words just as a hunting-horn forms a tune, with an
open throat: He told us, however, some time after *
when we had taught him to speak a little English,
that they were going, with their kings, to fight a
great battle. When he said kings, we asked him,
how many kings? He said, there were five nation,'
(we could not make him understand the plural s.)
and that they all joined to go against two nation.
We asked him, What made them come up to us?
He said, To makee te great wonder look—Where it
is to be observed, that all those natives, as also those
of Africa, when they learn English, they always add
two e's at the end of the words where we use one,
and place the accent upon the last of them; as
makce, takee, and the like; and we could not break
them of it; nay, I could hardly make Friday leave
it off, thought at last he did.
And now I name the poor fellow once more, I
must take my last leave of him; poor honest Fridays
We buried him with all decency and solemnity possi-
ble, by putting him into a coffin, and throwing him
into the sea; and I caused them to fire eleven guns
for
for him: and so ended the life of the most grateful,
saithful, honest, and most affectionate servant that
ever man had.
We now went away with a sair wind for Brasil,
and, in about twelve days time, we made land in the
latitude of five degrees south of the line, being the
north-eastermost land of all that part of America.
We kept on S. by E. in sight of the shore four days,
when we made the Cape St. Augustine, and in three
days came to an anchor off the bay of All Saints,
the old place of my deliverance, from whence came
both my good and evil sate.
Never did a ship come to this part that had less
business than I had; and yet it was with great diffi-
culty that we were admitted to hold the least corres-
pondence on shore. Not my partner himself, who
was alive, and made a great figure among them,
not my two merchant trustees, nor the same of my
wonderful preservation in the island, could obtain
me that savour: but my partner, remembering that
I had given five hundred moidores to the prior of
the monastery of the Attgustines, and three hundred
and seventy-two to the poor, went to the monastery,
and obliged the prior that then was, to go to the go-
vernor, and beg leave for me presently, with the
captain, and one more, besides eight seamen, to come
on shore, and no more; and this upon condition
absolutely capitulated for, that we should not offer
to land any goods out of the ship, or to carry any
person away without licence.
They were so strict with us, as to landing any
goods, that it was with extreme difficulty that I got
on shore three bales of English goods, such as sine
broad
t^TE AND ADVENTURES
broad cloths, stuffs, and some linen, which I had
brought for a present to my partner.
He was a very generous, broad-hearted man,
though (like me) he came from little at first; and
though he knew not that I had the least design of
giving him any thing, he sent me on board a pre-
sent of fresh provisions, wine, and sweetmeats, worth
above thirty moidores, including some tobacco, and
three or four sine medals in gold. But I was even
with him in my present, which, as I have said, con-
sisted of sine broad cloth, English stuffs, lace, and fine
Hollands. Also, I delivered him about the value of
lool. sterling, in the same goods, for other uses;
and I obliged him to set up the sloop which I had
brought with me from England, as I have said, for
the use of my colony, in order to send the refresh-
ments I intended to my plantation.
Accordingly he got hands, and finished the sloop
in a very few days, for shc was already framed; and
I gave the master of her such instructions as he could
not miss the place; nor did he miss it, as I had an
account from my partner afterwards. I got him
soon loaded with the small cargo I had sent them;
and one of our seamen, that had been on shore with
me there, offered to go with the sloop, and settle
there, upon my letter to the governor Spaniard, to
allot him a sufficient quantity of land for a planta-
tion; and giving him some clothes, and tools for his
planting work, which he said he understood, having
been an old planter in Maryland, and a buccaneer
into the bargain.
I encouraged the fellow by granting all he de-
fired; and, as an addition, I gave him the savage
which
which we had taken prisoner of war, to be his slave,
and ordered the governor Spaniard to give him his
share of every thing he wanted, with the rest.
When we came to fit this man out, my old part-
ner told me, there was a certain very honest fellow,
a Brasil planter of his acquaintance, who had fallen
into the displeasure of the church: I know not what
the matter is with him, says he, but, on my con-
science, I think he is an heretic in his heart; and he
has been obliged to conceal himself for fear of the
inquisition; that he would be very glad of such an
opportunity to make his escape, with his wife and
two daughters; and if I would let them go to the
island, and allot them a plantation, he would give
them a small stock to begin with; for the osficers
of the inquisition had seized all his esfects and estate,
and he had nothing left but a little houshold stuff,
and two slaves; and, adds he, though I hate his
principles, yet I would not have him sall into their
hands, for he will assuredly be burnt alive if he
does.
I granted this presently, and joined my English-
man with them; and we concealed the man, and his
wife and daughters, on board our ship, till the sloop
put out to go to sea; and then (having put all their
goods on board the sloop some time before) we put
them onboard the sloop,after she was got out of thebay.
Our seaman was mightily pleased with this new
partner; and their stock, indeed, was much alike
rich in tools, and in preparations, for a sarm; but
nothing to begin with, but as above. However, they
carried over with them (which was worth all the rest)
some materials for planting sugar canes, with some
Vol. II. P plants
2IO
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
plants of canes; which he (I mean the Portugal
man) understood very well.
Among the rest of the supplies sent my tenants
in the illand, I sent them, by this sloop, three milch
cows and five calves, about twenty-two hogs among
them, three sows big with pig, two mares, and a
stone-horse.
For my Spaniards, according to my promise, I
engaged three Portugal women to go; and recom-
mended it to them to marry them, and use' them
kindly. I could have procured more women, but I
remembered that the poor persecuted man had two
daughters, and there were but five of the Spaniards
that wanted; the rest had wives of their own, tho'
in another country.
All this cargo arrived safe, and as you may easily
suppose, very welcome to my old inhabitants, who
were now (with this addition) between sixty and se-
venty people, besides little children; of which there
were a great many: I found letters at London from
them all, by way of Lisbon, when I came back to Eng-
land, being sent back to the Brasils by this sloop; of
which I shall take some notice in its place.
I have now done with my island, and all manner
of discourse about it; and whoever reads the rest
of my memorandums, would do well to turn his
thoughts entirely from it, and expect to read only of
the follies of an old man, not warned by his own harms,
much less by those of other men, to beware of the like;
not cooled by almost forty years misery and disap-
pointments; not satisfied with prosperity beyond
expectation; not made cautious by affliction and dis-
tress beyond imitation.
I had
211
I had no more business to go to thcEa/l Indies, than
a man at full liberty, and having committed no
crime, has to go to the turn-key at Newgate, and
desire him to lock him up among the prisoners there,
and starve him. Had I taken a small vessel from
England, and went directly to the island; had I
loaded her, as I did the other vessel, with all the ne-
cessaries for the plantation, and for my people ; took
a patent from the government here, to have secured
my property, in subjection only to that of England,
which, to be sure, I might have obtained; had I
carried over cannon and ammunition, servants, and
people to plant, and, taking possession of the place,
fortified and strengthened it in the name of England,
and increased it with people,asImight easily have done;
had I then settled myself there, and sent the ship back,
loaded with good rice, as I might also have done in
six months time, and ordered my friends to have
fitted her out again for our supply; had I done this,
and stayed there myself, I had, at least, acted like a
man of common sense; but I was possessed with
a wandering spirit, scorned all advantages, pleased
myself with being the patron of these people I had
placed there, and doing for them in a kind of haughty
majestic way, like an old patriarchal monarch; pro-
viding for them, as if I had been sather of the whole
samily, as well as of the plantation: but I never so
much as pretended to plant iii the name of any go-
vernment or nation, or to acknowledge any prince,
or to call my people subjects to any one nation more
than another; nay, I never so much as gave the
place a name; but left it as I found it, belonging to
no man; and the people under no discipline or go-
P 2 vernment
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
vernment but my own; who, though I had an in*
fluence over them as sather and benesactor, had no
authority or power to act or command one way or
other, sarther than voluntary consent moved them to
comply: yet even this, had I staid there, would have
done well enough; but as I rambled from them, and
came thither no more, the last letters I had from any
of them, were by my partner's means, who after-
wards sent another sloop to the place; and who sent
me word, though I had not the letter till five years
after it was written, that they went on but poorly, were
malecontent with their long stay there; that Will
Aikins was dead; that five of the Spaniards were
come away; and that though they had not been
much molested by the savages, yet they had had some
skirmishes with them; that they begged of him to-
write to me, to think of the promise I had made to-
fetch them away, that they might see their own*
country again before they died.
But I was gone a wild-goose chase indeed; and
they who will have any more of me, must be content to
follow me through a new variety of follies, hard-
ships, and wild adventures; wherein the justice of
Providence may be duly observed, and we may see
how easily Heaven can gorge us with our own de-
sires, make the strongest of our wishes to be our af-
fliction, and punish us most severely with those very
things which we think it would be our utmost happi-
ness to be allowed in.
Let no wise man flatter himself with the strength
of his own judgment, as if he was able to chuse any
particular station of life for himself. Man is a short-
sighted creature, fees but a very little.way before
him;
Mm; and as his passions are none of his best friends,
so his particular affections are generally his Worst
counsellors.
I say this with respect to the impetuous defire I
had from a youth, to wander into the world; and
how evident it now was, that this principle was pre-
served in me for my punishment. How it came on,
the manner, the circumstance, and the conclusion
of it, it is easy to give you historically, and with its
utmost variety of particulars. But the secret ends
of Divine Providence, in thus permitting us to be
hurried down the stream of our own defires, are only to
be understood of those who can listen to the voice of
Providence, and draw religious consequences from
God's justice, and their own mistakes.
Be it, had I business, or no business, away I went;
it is no time now to enlarge any sarther upon the
reason or absurdity of my own conduct; but to
come to the history; I was embarked for the voy-
age, and the voyage I went.
I shall only add here, that my honest and truly
pious clergyman left me here; a ship being ready to
go to Lisbon, he asked me leave to go thither; being
still, as he observed, bound never to finish any voyage
he began. How happy had it been for me, if I had
gone with him!
But it was too late now; all things Heaven ap-
points are best: had I gone with him, I had never
had so many things to be thankful for, and you had
never heard of the second part of the Travels and Ad-
ventures of Robinson Crusoe; so I must leave here the
fruitless exclairaingat mysclf,andgoon withmy voyage.
P 3 From
From the Brasih we made directly away over the
Atlantic sea, to the Cape de Bonne Esperance, or, as
we call it, the Cape of Good Hope; and had a tole-
rable good voyage, our course generally south-east;
now and then a storm, and some contrary winds.
But my disasters at sea were at an end; my future
rubs and cross events were to besal me on more; that
it might appear, the land was as well prepared to be
our scourge as the sea, when Heaven, who directs
the circumstances of things, pleases to appoint it to
be so.
Our ship was on a trading voyage, and had a su-
per-cargo on board,, who was to direct all her mo-
tions, after she arrived at the Cape; only being li-
mitted to a certain number of days for stay, by char-
ter-party, at the several ports she was to go to: this
was none of my business, neither did I meddle with
it at all; my nephew, the captain, and the super-
cargo, adjusting all those things between them as
they thought fit.
We made no stay at the Cape, longer than was
needful to take in fresh water, but made the best of
our way for the coast. of Coromandc; we were
indeed informed that a French man of war of
fifty guns, and two large merchant ships, were gone
for the Indies; and, as I knew we were at war with
France, I had some apprehensions of them; but they
went their own way, and we heard no more of
them.
I shall not pester my account, or the reader, with
descriptions of places, journals of our voyages, va-
riations of the compass, latitudes, meridian distances,
trade winds, situation of ports, and the like; such
as
as almost all the histories of long navigation are full
of, and which make the reading tiresome enough;
and are perfectly unprofitable to all that read, ex-
cept only to those who are to go to those places
themselves.
It is enough to name the ports and places which
we touched at; and what occurred to us upon our
pasting from one to another. We touched first at
the island of Madagascar, where, though the peo-
ple are fierce and treacherous, and, in particular,
very well armed with lances and bows, which they
use with inconceivable dexterity, yet we sared very
well with them awhile; they treated us very civilly;
and for some trisles which we gave them, such as
knives, scistars, &c. they brought us eleven good sat
bullocks, middling in size, but very good in flesh;
which we took in, partly for fresh provisions for our
present spending, and the rest to salt for the ship's
use.
We were obliged to stay here for some time, after
we had furnished ourselves with provisions; and I,
that was always too curious to look into every nook
of the world wherever I came, was for going on shore
as often as I could. It was on the east side of the
island that we went on shore one evening; and the
people, who, by the way, are very numerous, came
thronging about us, and stood gazing at us at a dis-
tance; as we had traded freely with them, and had
been kindly used, we thought ourselves in no dan-
ger; but when we saw the people, we cut three
boughs out of a tree, and stuck them up at a distance
from us, which, it seems, is a mark in the country,
not only of truce and friendfliip, but when it is ac*
P 4 cepted,
cepted, the other side set up three poles, or boughs,
also; which is a signal that they accept the truce too;
but then this is a known condition of the truce, that
you are not to pass beyond their three poles towards
them, nor they come past your three poles or boughs
towards you; so that you are perfectly secure within
the three poles; and all the space between your poles
and their's, is allowed like a market, for free con-
verse, traffick, and commerce. When you go thi-
ther, you must not carry your weapons with you;
and if they come into that space, they stick up their
javelins and launces, all at the first poles, and come
on unarmed; but if any violence is offered them,
and the truce thereby broken, away they run to the
poles, and lay hold of their weapons, and then the
truce is at an end.
It happened one evening, when we went on fliore,
that a greater number of their people came down
than usual, but was all very friendly and civil. They
brought with them several kinds of provisions, for
which we satisfied them with such toys as we had;
their women also brought us milk and roots, and
several things very acceptable to us, and all was
quiet; and we made us a little tent, or hut, of some
boughs of trees, and lay on shore all that night.
I know not what was the occasion, but I was not
so well satisfied to lie on shore as the rest; and the
boat lying at an anchor about a stone's cast from the
land, with two men in her to take care of her, I
made one of them come on shore; and getting some
bpughs of trees to cover us also in the boat, I spread
the sail on the bottom of the boat, and lay on board,
2 under
under the covct of the branches of the trees, all
night.
About two o'clock in the morning we heard one of
our men make a terrible noise on the more, calling
out for God's sake to bring the boat in, and come and
help them, for they were all like to be murdered;
at the same time I heard the firing of five musquets,
which was the number of the guns they had, and
that three times over; for, it seems, the natives here
were not so easily frighted with guns as the savages
were in America, where I had to do with them.
All this while I knew not what was the matter;
but rousing immediately from sleep with the noise, I
caused the boat to be thrust in, and resolved, with
three fusils we had on board, to land and assist our
men.
We got the boat soon to the more; but our men
were in too much haste; for, being come to the
shore, they plunged into the water, to get to the
boat with all the expedition they could, being pur-
sued by between three and four hundred men. Our
men were but nine in all, and only five of them had
fusils with them; the rest, indeed, had pistols and
swords, but they were of small use to them.
We took up seven of our men, and with difficulty
enough too, three of them being very ill wounded;
and that which was still worse, was, that while we
stood in the boat to take our men in, we were in as
much danger as they were in on shore; for they
poured their arrows in upon us so thick, that we
were sain to barricade the side of the boat up with
the benches, and two or three soose boards, which,
to
to our great satissaction, we had, by mere accident,
or providence rather, in the boat.
And yet, had it been day-light, they are, it seems,
such exact marksmen, that if they could have seen
but the least part of any of us, they would have
been sure of us: we had, by the light of the moon,
a little sight of them, as they stood pelting us from
the shore with darts and arrows; and, having got
ready our fire-arms, we gave them a volley; and
we could hear by the cries of some of them, that we
had wounded several; however they stood thus in
battle array on the shore till break of day, which
we suppose was, that they might fee the better to
take their aim at us.
In this condition we lay, and could not tell how
to weigh our anchor, or set up our sail, because we
must needs stand up in the boat, and they were as
sure to hit us, as we were to hit a bird in a tree with
small shot: we made signals of distress to the ship,
which though she rode a league off, yet my nephew,
the captain, hearing our firing, and by glasses per-
ceiving the posture we lay in, and that we fired to-
wards the shore, pretty well understood us; and,
weighing anchor with all speed, he stood as near the
shore as he durst with the ship, and then sent another
boat, with ten hands in her, to assist us; but we
called to them not to come too near, telling them
what condition we were in: however, they stood in
nearer to us; and one of the men, taking the end
of a tow-line in his hand, and keeping our boat be-
tween him and the enemy, so that they could not
perfectly fee him, swam on board us, and made the line
sast to the boat; upon which we slipt our little cable,
i and
and leaving our anchor behind, they towed us out
of the reach of the arrows; we all the while lying
close behind the barricade we had made.
As soon as we were got from between the ship and
the shore, that she could lay her side to the shore, we
ran along just by them, and we poured in a broad-
side among them, loaded with pieces of iron and
lead, small bullets, and such stusf, besides the great
fliot, which made a terrible havock among them.
When we were got on board, and out of danger,
we had time to examine into the occasion of this
fray; and, indeed, our supercargo, who had been
often in those parts, put me upon it; for he said he
was sure the inhabitants would not have touched us
after we had made a truce, if we had not done some-
thing to provoke them to it: At length it came out,
'viz. That an old woman, who had come to sell us
some milk, had brought it within our poles, with a
young woman with her, who also brought some
roots or herbs; and while the old woman (whether
she was mother to the young woman or no, they
could not tell) was selling us the milk, one of our
men offered some rudeness to the wench that was
with her; at which the old woman made a great
noise. However, the seaman would not quit his
prize, but carried her out of the old woman's sight,
among the trees, it being almost dark; the old wo-
man went away without her; and, as we suppose,
made an outcry among the people she came from;
who, upon notice, raised this great army upon us in
three or spur hours; and it was great odds but we
had been all destroyed.
One
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
One of our men was killed with a lance that was
thrown at him, just at the beginning of the attack,
as he sallied out of the tent we had made; the rest
came off free, all but the fellow who was the occasion
of all the mischief, who paid dear enough for his
black mistress, for we could not hear what became
of him a great while. We lay upon the more two
days after, though the wind presented, and made sig-
nals for him; made our boat sail up more, and down
more, several leagues, but in vain; so we were
obliged to give him over; and if he alone had suf-
fered for it, the loss had been the less.
I could not satisfy myself, however, without ven-
turing on shore once more, to try if I could learn any
thing of him or them; it was the third night after the
action, that I had a great mind to learn, if I could
by any means, what mischief we had done, and how
the game stood on the Indian side: I was careful to
do it in the dark, lest we should be attacked again;
but I ought indeed to have been sure, that the men
I went with had been under my command, before I
engaged in a thing so hazardous and mischievouS,
as I was brought into it without my knowledge or
defire.
We took twenty stout fellows with us as any in
the ship, besides the supercargo and myself; and we
landed two hours before midnight, at the same place
where the Indians stood drawn up the evening before:
I landed here, because my design, as I have said, was
chiefly to fee if they had quitted the field, and if they
had left any marks behind them, or of the mischief
we had done them; and I thought, if we could sur-
prise
221
prise one or two of them, perhaps we might get our
man again, by way of exchange.
We landed without any noise, and divided our
men into two companies, whereof the boatswain com-
manded one, and I the other: We neither could hear
nor see any body stir when we landed; so we marched
up, one body at a distance from the other, to the
field of battle: At first we could see nothing, it be-
ing very dark; but by and by, our boatswain, that
led the first party, stumbled and fell over a dead bo-
dy: This made them halt there awhile; for knowing
by the circumstances, that they were at the place
where the Indians had stood, they waited for my
coming up: Here we concluded to halt till the moon
began to rife, which we knew would be in less than
an hour; and then we could easily discern the havock
we had made among them: We told two-and-thirty
bodies upon the ground, whereof two were not quite
dead. Some had an arm, and some a leg, shot off;
and one his head: Those that were wounded, we
supposed they had carried away.
When we had made, as I thought, a full discovery
of all we could come at the knowledge of, I was for
going on board again; but the boatswain and his
party often sent me word, that they were resolved to
make a visit to the Indian town, where these dogs,
as they called them, dwelt; and defired me to go
along with them; and if they could find them, as
they still sancied they should, they did not doubt,
they said, getting a good booty; and it might be,
they might find Thomas Jefflrys there: that was the
man's name we had lost.

LIFE AND ADVENTURES
Had they sent to ask my leave to go, I knew well
enough what answer to have given them; for I would
have commanded them instantly on board, knowing
it was not a hazard fit for us to run, who had a
ship, and a ship's loading in our charge, and a voyage
to make, which depended very much upon the lives
of the men; but as they sent me word they were
resolved to go, and only asked me and my com-
pany to go along with them, I positively refused it,
and rose up (for I was sitting on the ground) in or-
der to go to the boat. One or two of the men began
to importune me to go; and, when I still refused
positively, began to grumble, and say they were not
under my command, and they would go. Come,
Jack, says one of the men, will you go with me?
I will go for one. Jack said he would; and ano-
ther followed, and then another; and, in a word,
they all left me but one, whom, with much difficulty
too, I persuaded to stay: so the supercargo and I,
with one man, went back to the boat, where, I told
them, we would stay for them, and take care to take
in as many of them as should be left; for I told
them, it was a mad thing they were going about,
and supposed most of them would run the sate of
Tliomas Jcffrys.
They told me, like seamen, they'd warrant it they
would come off again; and they would take care,
&c. So away they went. I intreated them to con-
sider the ship, and the voyage; that their lives were
not their own; and that they were intrusted with
the voyage, in some measure; that if they miscar-
ried, the ship might be lost for want of their help;
and
and that they could not answer it to God and man.
I said a great deal more to them on that head, but I
might as well have talked to the main-mast of the
ship; they were mad upon their journey; only they
gave me good words, and begged I would not be
angry; said they would be very cautious, and they
did not doubt but they would be back again in
about an hour, at sarthest; for the Indian town, they
said, was not above half a mile off; though they
found it above two miles before they got to it.
Well, they all went away, as above; and though
the attempt was desperate, and such as none but mad-
men would have gone about, yet, to give them their
due, they went about it warily, as well as boldly.
They were gallantly armed, that is true; for they
had every man a fufil or musquet, a bayonet, and
every man a pistol; some of them had broad cut-
lasses, some of them hangers; and the boatswain,
and two more, had pole-axes: besides all which, they
had among them thirteen hand-grenadoes. Bolder
fellows, and better provided, never went about any
wicked work in the world.
When they went out, their chief design was
plunder; and they were in mighty hopes of finding
gold there; but a circumstance, which none of them
were aware of, set them on fire with revenge, and
made devils of them all: When they came to the
few Indian houses, which they thought had been the
town, which were not above half a mile off, they
were under a great disappointment; for there were
not above twelve or thirteen houses; and where the
town was, or how big, they knew not: They con-
sulted
suited therefore what to do, and were some time be-
fore they could resolve: for if they fell upon these,
they must cut all their throats; and it was ten to
one but some of them might escape, it being in the
night, though the moon was up; and if one escaped,
he would run away, and raise all the town, so they
should have a whole army upon them. Again, on
the other hand, if they went away, and left those
untouched (for the people were all afleep) they could
not tell which way to look for the town.
However, the last was the best advice; so they re-
solved to leave those houses, and look for the town as
well as they could : They went on a little way, and
found a cow tied to a tree: this they presently con-
cluded would be a good guide to them; for they
said the cow certainly belonged to the town before
them, or the town behind them; and if they untied
her, they should see which way she went: if she went
back, they had nothing to say to her; but if she
went forward, they had nothing to do but to fol-
low her; so they cut the cord, which was made of
twisted flags, and the cow went on before them: In
a word, the cow led them directly to the town, which,
as they reported, consisted of above 200 houses, or
huts; and in some of these they found several sa-
milies living together.
Here they found all silent ; as profoundly secure,
as sleep and a country that had never seen an enemy
of that kind, could make them. Upon this they
called another council, to consider what they had to
do; and, in a word, they resolved to divide them-
selves into three bodies, and to set three houses on
fire
fire In three parts of the town; and as the men came
out, to seize them, and bind them; if any resisted,
they need not be asked what to do then; and so to
search the rest of the houses for plunder; but re-
solved to march silently first through the town, and
see what dimensions it was of, and consider if they
might venture upon it, or no.
They did so, and desperately resolved that they
would venture upon them; but while they were ani-
mating one another to the work, three of them, that
were a little before the rest, called out aloud, and
told them they had found Thomas Jeff'rys; they all
ran up to the place, and so it was indeed, for there
they found the poor fellow, hanged up naked by one
arm, and his throat cut: There was an bidian house
just by the tree, where they found sixteen or seven-
teen of the principal Indians, who had been con-
cerned in the fray with us before, and two or three
of them wounded with our shot; and our men found
they were awake, and talking one to another in that
house, but knew not their number.
The sight of their poor mangled comrade so en-
raged them, as before, that they swore to one ano-
ther they would be revenged, and that not an Indian
who came into their hands mould have quarter; and
to work they went immediately; and yet not so madly
as by the rage and fury they were in might be expected.
Their first care was to get something that would soon
take fire; but after a little search, they found that
would be to no purpose, for most of the houses were
low, and thatched with flags or rushes, of which the
country is full; so they presently made some wild
Vol. II. Q„ fire,
sire, as we call it, by wetting a little powder in thai
palms of their hands; and, in a quarter of an hour,
they set the town on fire in four or five places; and
particularly that house where the Indians were not
gone to bed. As soon as the fire began to blaze,
the poor frighted creatures began to rush out to save
their lives; but met with their sate in the attempt,
and especially at the door, where they drove them
back, the boatswain himself killing one or two with
his pole-axe; the house being large, and many in it,
he did not care to go in, but called for an hand gre-
nado, and threw it among them, which, at first,
frighted them; but when it burst, made such havock
among them, that they cried out in a hideous
manner.
In short, most of the Indians who were in the open
part of the house, were killed or hurt with the gre-
nado, except two or three more, who pressed to the
door, which the boatswain and two more kept with
the bayonets in the muzzles of their pieces, and dis-
patched all who came that way. But there was ano-
ther apartment in the house, where the prince, or
king, or whatsoever he was, and several others, were;.
and they kept in, till the house, which was by this.
time all of a light slame, fell in upon them, and they
were smothered, or burnt together.
All this while they fired not a gun, because they
would not waken the people saster than they could
master them; but the fire began to waken them
sast enough, and our fellows were glad to keep a
little together in bodies; for the fire grew so raging,
all the houses being made of light combustible stuff,
that they could hardly bear the street between them;
and
227
and their business was to follow the fire for the surer
execution: As sast as the fire either forced the peo-
ple out of those houses which were burning, or
frighted them out of others, our people were ready
at their doors to knock them on the head, still calling
and hallooing to one another to remember Thomas
Jeffrys.
While this was doing, I must confess I was very
uneasy, and especially, when I saw the flames of the
town, which, it being night, seemed to be just by
me.
My nephew, the captain, who was roused by his
men too, seeing such a fire, was very uneasy, not
knowing what the matter was, or what danger I
was in; especially hearing the guns too; for by this
time they began to use their fire-arms: A thousand
OF ROBINSON CRUSOE.
supercargo, what should become of us: and at last,
though he could ill spare any more men, yet, not
knowing what exigence we might be in, he takes
another boat, and with thirteen men and himself
comes on shore to me.
He was surprised to see me and the supercargo in
the boat, with no more than two men, for one had
been left to keep the boat; and though he was glad
that we were well; yet he was in the same impa-
tience with us to know what was doing; for the noise
continued, and the flame increased: I confess it was
next to an impossibility for any men in the world to
restrain their curiosity of knowing what had happen-
ed, or their concern for the safety of the men. In a
word, the captain told me, he would go and help his
men,
men, let what would come. I argued with him, as
I did before with the men, the safety of the ship, and
the danger of the voyage, the interest of the owners
and merchants, &c. and told him I would go, and the
two men, and only fee if we could, at a distance,
learn what was like to be the event, and come back
and tell him.
It was all one to talk to my nephew, as it was to
talk to the rest before; he would go, he said, and
he only*wished he had left but ten men in the ship;
for he could not think of having his men lost for
want of help: he had rather, he said, lose the ship,
the voyage, and his life, and all: And so away
went he.
Nor was I any more able to stay behind now, than
I was to persuade them not to go before; so, in
short, the captain ordered two men to row back the
pinnace, and fetch twelve men more from the ship,
leaving the long-boat at an anchor; and that when
they came back, six men should keep the two boats,
and six more come after us; so that he left only six-
teen men in the ship; for the whole ship's company
consisted of 65 men, whereof two were lost in the first
quarrel which brought this mischief on.
Being now on the march, you may be sure we
felt little of the ground we trod on; and being
guided by the fire, we kept no path, but went di-
rectly to the place of the flame. If the noise of the
guns were surprising to us before, the cries of the poor
people were now quite of another nature, and fill .d us
with horror. I must confess I never was at the sacking
of a city, or at the taking of a town by storm; I have
heard
heard of Oliver Cromwell taking Drogheda, in Ireland,
and killing man, woman, and child; and I had read of
Count Tilly sacking the city of Magdcbourg, and
cutting the throats of 22000 of both sexes; but I
never had an idea of the thing itself before; nor is
it possible to describe it, or the horror which was up-
on our minds at hearing it.
However we went on, and, at length, came to the
town, though there was no entering the streets of it
for the fire. The first object we met with was the
ruins of a hut or house, or rather the ashes of it,
for the house was consumed; and just before it,
plain now to be seen by the light of the fire, lay four
men and three women killed; and, as we thought,
one or two more lay in the heap among the fire. In
short, these were such instances of a rage altogether
barbarous, and of a fury something beyond what
was human, that we thought it impossible our men
could be guilty of it; or, if they were the authors
of it, we thought that every one of them ought to
be put to the worst of deaths: But this was not all;
we saw the fire increased forward, and the cry went
on just as the fire went on, so that we were in the
utmost confusion. We advanced a little way sar-
ther; and beheld, to our astonishment, three women
naked, crying in a most dreadful manner, and flying
as if they had, indeed, had wings, and after them
sixteen or seventeen men, natives, in the same terror
and consternation, with three of our English butchers
(for I can call them no better) in the rear; who,
when they could not overtake them, fired in among
them, and one that was killed by their shot, fell
down in our sight; when the rest saw us, believing
us to be their enemies, and that we would murder
them, as well as those that pursued them, they set
up a most dreadful shriek, especially the women;
and two of them fell down as if already dead with
the fright.
My very soul shrunk within me, and my blood
ran chill in my veins when I saw this; and I believe,
had the three English sailors that pursued them come
on, I had made our men kill them all. However,
we took some ways to let the poor flying creatures
know that'-we would not hurt them; and immedi-
ately they came up to us, and kneeling down, with
their hands lifted up, made piteous lamentations to
us to save them, which we let them know we would
do; whereupon they kept all together in a huddle,
close behind us, for protection. u I left my men drawn
up together, and charged them to hurt nobody, but,
if poflible, to get at some of our people, and fee.
what devil it was possessed them, and what they in-
tended to do; and, in a word, to command them
off; assuring them, that if they staid till day-light,
they would have a hundred thousand men about their,
ears; I say, I left them, and went among those fly-
ing people, taking only two of our men with me:
and there was, indeed, a piteous spectacle among
them: Some of them had their feet terribly burnt
with trampling and running through the fire; others
their hands burnt; one of the women had sallen
down in the fire, and was almost burnt to death be-
fore she could get out again; two or three of the
men had cuts in their backs and thighs, from our
men pursuing; and another was shot through the
body, arid died while I was there.
I would.
I would fain have learned what the occasion of all
this was, but I could not understand one word they
said, though by signs I perceived that some of them
knew not what was the occasion themselves. I was
so terrified in my thoughts at this outrageous attempt,
that I could not stay there, but went back to my
own men: I told them my resolution, and command-
ed them to follow me, when in the very moment
came four of our men, with the boatswain at their
head, running over the heaps of bodies they had
killed, all covered with blood and dust, as if they
wanted more people to massacre; when our men
hallooed to them as loud as they could halloo; and,
with much ado, one of them made them hear;
so that they knew who we were, and came up to
,us.
As soon as the boatswain saw us, he set up a hal-
loo, like a shout of triumph, for having, as he
thought, more help come; and without bearing to
hear me, Captain, says he, noble captain, I am glad
you are come; we have not half done yet: Vil-
lains! hell-hound dogs! I will kill as many of them
as poor Tom has hairs upon his head. We have
sworn to spare none of them; we will root out the
very name of them from the earth: and thus he ran
on, out of breath too with action, and would not
give us leave to speak a word.
At last, raising my voice that I might silence him
a little: Barbarous dog! said I, what are you doing?
I won't have one creature touched more, upon pain
of death. I charge you, upon your life, to stop
your hands, and stand still here, or you are a dead
wan this minute.
(^4 Why,
Why, Sir, says he, do you know what you do,
or what they have done? If you want a reason for
what we have done, come hither; and with that he
shewed me the poor fellow hanging upon a tree, with
his throat cut.
I confess I was urged then myself, and at ano-
ther time should have been forward enough; but I
thought they had carried their rage too sar, and
thought of Jacob's words to his sons Simeon and Lew",
"Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce ; and their
"wrath, for it was cruel." But I had now a new
task upon my hands; for when the men I carried
with me saw the sight, as I had done, I had as much
to do to restrain them, as I should have had with the
others; nay, my nephew himself fell in with them,
and told me, in their hearing, that he was only con-
cerned for fear of the men being overpowered; for,
as to the people, he thought not one of them ought
to live; for they had all glutted themselves with the
murder of the poor man, and that they ought to be
used like murderers: upon these words, away ran
eight of my men with the boatswain and his crew,
to complete their bloody work: and I, seeing it quite
out of my power to restrain them, came away pen-
sive and sad; for I could not bear the sight, much
less the horrible noise and cries of the poor wretches
that fell into their hands. 1
I got nobody to come back with me but the super-
cargo and two men, and with these I walked back to
the boats. It was a very great piece of folly in me,
I confess, to venture back as it were alone; for as
it began now to be almost day, and the alarm had
run over the country, there stood about forty men,
4 armed
armed with lances and bows, at the little place where
the twelve or thirteen houses stood, mentioned be-
fore; but by accident I missed the place, and came
directly to the sea-side; and by that time I got to
the sea-side, it was broad day: immediately I took
the pinnace, and went aboard, and sent her back to
assist the men in what might happen.
I observed, that about the time I came to the boat-
side, the fire was pretty well out, and the noise abated;
but in about half an hour after I got on board, I
heard a volley of our men's fire arms, and saw a
great smoke; this, as I understood afterwards, was
our men salling upon the forty men, who, as I said,
stood at the few houses on the way; of whom they
killed sixteen or seventeen, and set all those houses
on fire, but did not meddle with the women or
children.
By that time the men got to the sttore again with
the pinnace, our men began to appear; they came
dropping in, some and some; not in two bodies, and
in form, as they went out, but all in heaps, straggling
here and there in such manner, that a small force
of resolute men might have cut them all off.
But the dread of them was upon the whole coun-
try: The people were amazed and surprised, and so
frighted, that, I believe, an hundred of them would
have fled at the sight of but five of our men. Nor
in all this terrible action* was there a man who made
any considerable defence; they were so surprized be-
tween the terror of the fire, and the sudden attack
of our men in the dark, that they knew not which
way to turn themselves; for if they fled one way,
they were met by one party; if back again, by ano-
ther;
ther; so that they were every where knocked down*
Nor did any of our men receive the least hurt, ex-
cept one who strained his foot, and another had one
of his hands very much burnt.
I was very angry with my nephew, the captain,
and, indeed, with all the men, in my mind, but with
him in particular; as well for his acting so out of
his duty, as commander of the ship, and having the
charge of the voyage upon him, as in his prompting,
rather than cooling, the rage of his men, in so bloody
and cruel an enterprise: My nephew answered me
very respectfully; but told me that when he saw the
body of the poor seaman, whom they had murdered in
such a cruel and barbarous manner, he was not master
of himself, neither could he govern his passion; he
owned, he should not have done so, as he was comman-
der of the ship; but, as he was a man, and nature moved
him, he could not bear it. As for the rest of the
men, they were not subject to me at all; and they
knew it well enough, so they took no notice of my
dislike.
The next day we set sail; so we never heard any
more of it. Our men differed in the account of the
number they killed; some said one thing, some
another: But, according to the best of their ac-
counts put all together, they killed, or destroyed,
about 150 people, men, women, and children, and
left not a house standing in the town.
As for the poor fellow Thomas "Jeffrys, as he was
quite dead, for his throat was so cut that his head
was half off, it would do him no service to bring
him away; so they left him where they found him^
only
only took him down from the tree where he was
hanged by one hand.
However just our men thought this action to be, I
was against them in it; and I always, after that time,
told them God would blast the voyage; for I looked
upon the blood they shed that night to be murder in
them: for though it is true that they killed Thomas
jeffrys, yet it was as true that Jeffrys was the aggressor,
had broken the truce, and had violated or debauched
a young woman of their's, who came to our camp
innocently, and on the saith of their capitulation.
The boatswain defended this quarrel when we were
afterwards on board. He said, it was true that we
seemed to break the truce, but really had not; and
that the war was begun the night before by the na-
tives themselves, who had mot at us, and killed one
of our men without any just provocation -r so that,
as we were in a capacity to fight them, we might also .
be in a capacity to do ourselves justice upon them in
an extraordinary manner; that though the poor
man had taken liberty with a wench, he ought not to
have been murdered, and that in such a villainous
manner; and that they did nothing but what was
just, and that the laws of God allowed to be done to
murderers.
One would think this should have been enough
to have warned us against going on more among
heathens and barbarians; but it is impossible to
make mankind wife, but at their own experience;
and their experience seems to be always of most use
to them, when it is dearest bought.
We were now bound to the gulph of Persia, and
from thence to the coast of Coromandcl, only to touch
at
at Swat; but the chief of the supercargo's design
lay at the bay of Bengal, where, if he missed of the
business outward-bound, he was to go up to China,
and return to the coast as he came home.
The first disaster that befel us was in the gulph of
Persia, where five of our men, venturing on shore on
the Arabian side of the gulph, were surrounded by
the Arabs, and either all killed, or carried away into
slavery; the rest of the boat's crew were not able to
rescue them, and had but just time to get off their
boat: I began to upbraid them with the just retribu-
tion of Heaven in this case; but the boatswain very
warmly told me, he thought I went sarther in my
censures than I could shew any warrant for in scrip-
ture, and referred to the thirteenth of St. Luke, ver. 4.
where our Saviour intimates, that those men, on
whom the Tower of Siloam fell, were not sinners
above all the Galileans; but that which, indeed, put
me to silence in this case, was, that none of these
five men, who were now lost, were of the number of
those who went on shore to the massacre of Madagas-
car (so I always called it, though our men could not
bear the word massacre with any patience): and, in-
deed, this last circumstance, as I have said, put me
to silence for the present.
But my frequent preaching to them on this subject:
had worse consequences than I expected; and the
boatswain, who had been the head of the attempt,
came up boldly to me one time, and told me, he
found that I continually brought that affair upon the
stage} that I made unjust reflections upon it, and had
used
237
used the men very ill on that account, and himself in
particular; that as I was but a passenger, and had no
command in the ship, or concern in the voyage, they
were not obliged to bear it; that they did not know
but I might have some ill design in my head, and,
perhaps, call them to an account for it, when they
came to England; and that therefore, unless I would
resolve to have done with it, and also not to concern
myself farther with him, or any of his affairs, he
would leave the ship; for he did not think it was safe
to sail with me among them.
I heard him patiently enough till he had done, and
then told him, that I did confess I had all along op-
posed the massacre of Madagascar, for such I would
always call it; and that I had on all occasions spoken
my mind freely about it, though not more upon him
than any of the rest; that as to my having no com-
mand in the ship, that was true, nor did I exercise
any authority, only took the liberty of speaking my
mind in things which publickly concerned us all; as
to what concern I had in the voyage, that was none
of his business; I was a considerable owner of the
sliip, and in that claim I conceived I had a right to
speak, even sarther than I had yet done, and would
not be accountable to him, or any one else; and be-
gan to be a little warm with him: he made but little
reply to me at that time, and I thought that affair had
been over. We were at this time in the road to Ben-
gal; and, being willing to fee the place, I went on
shore with the supercargo, in the ship's boat, to di-
vert myself; and towards evening was preparing to
go on board, when one of the men came to me, and
told
told me, he would not have me trouble myself to
come down to the boat, for they had orders not to
carry me on board. Any one may guess what a sur-
prise I was in at so insolent a message; and I asked the
man, who bade him deliver that errand to me? Ho
told me the cockswain. I said no more to the fel-
low, but bid him let them know he had delivered
his message, and that I had given him no answer
to it.
I immediately went, and found out the supercargo,
and told him the story, adding, what I presently fore-
saw, viz. that there would certainly be a mutiny in
the ship; and intreated him to go immediately on
board the ship in an Indian boat, and acquaint the
captain of it: but I might have spared this intelli-
gence, for, before I had spoken to him on shore, the
matter was effected on board: the boatswain, the
gunner, the carpenter, and in a word, all the inferior
officers, as soon as I was gone off in the boat, came
up to the quarter-deck, and defired to speak with the
captain; and there the boatswain, making a long
harangue (for the fellow talked very well), and re-
peating all he had said to me, told the captain in a
few words, that as I was now gone peaceably on
shore, they were loth to use any violence with me;
which, if I had not gone on shore, they would other-
wise have done, to oblige me to have gone. They
therefore thought fit to tell him, that as they shipped
themselves to serve in the ship under his command,
they would perform it saithfully: but if I would not
quit the ship, or the captain oblige me to quit .it, they
would all leave the ship, and sail no sarther with him:
and at that word ALL, he turned his sace about
towards
towards the main-mast, which was, it seems, the sig-
nal agreed on between them; at which all the sea-
men being got together, they cried out, One and
ALL, One and ALL!
My nephew* the captain, was a man of spirit, and
of great presence of mind, and though he was sur-
prised, you may be sure, at the thing, yet he told
them calmly he would consider of the matter; but
that he could do nothing in it till he had spoken to
me about it: he used some arguments with them, to
shew them the unreasonableness and injustice of the
thing; but it was all in vain; they swore, and shook
hands round, before his face, that they would go all
on shore, unless he would engage to them not to suffer
me to come on board the ship.
This was an hard article upon him, who knew his
obligation to me, and did not know how I might
take it; so he began to talk cavalierly to them;
told them that I was a very considerable owner of the
strip, and that in justice he could not put me out of
my own house; that this was next door to serving
me as the samous pirate Kid had done, who made
the mutiny in the ship, set the captain on shore in an
uninhabited island, and ran away with the ship ; that
let them go into what ship they would, if ever they
came to Englandagain, it would cost them dear; that
the ship was mine, and that he would not put me out
of it; and that he would rather lose the ship, and
the voyage too, than disoblige me so much; so they
might do as they pleased. However, he would go on
fliore, and talk with me there; and invited the boat-
swain to go with him, and perhaps they might ac-
commodate the matter with me.
2 But
But they all rejected the proposal; and said, they
would have nothing to do with me any more, neither
onboard, or on shore; and if I came on board, they
would go on shore. Well, said the captain, if you
are all of this mind, let me go on more, and talk with
him : so away he came to me with this account, a
little after the message had been brought to me from
the cockswain.
I was very glad to fee my nephew, I must confess;
for I was not without apprehensions that they would
confine him by violence, set sail, and run away with
the ship; and then I had been stript naked, in a remote
country, and nothing to help myself: in short, I had
been in a worse case than when I was all alone in the
island.
But they had not come to that length, it seems, to
my great satissaction; and when my nephew told me
what they had said to him, and how they had sworn,
and shook hands, that they would one and all leave
the ship, if I was suffered to come on board, I told
him, he mould not be concerned at it at all, for I
would ltay on more: I only desired he would take
care and send me all my necessary things on shore,
and leave me a sufficient sum of money, and I would
find my way to England as well as I could.
This was a heavy piece of news to my nephew; but
there was no way to help it, but to comply with it.
So in short, he went on board the ship again, and sa-
tisfied the men, that his uncle had yielded to their
importunity, and had sent for his goods from on
board the ship. So the matter was over in a very few
hours : the men returned to their duty, and I begun,
to consider what course I mould steer.
I was
I was now alone in the remotest part of the world,
as I think I may call it; for I was near three thou-
sand leagues, by sea, sarther off from England than
I was at my island; only, it is true, I might travel
here by land, over the Great Mogul's country to
Surat, might go from thence to Bassora by sea, up
the gulph of Persia, and from thence might take the
way of the caravans, over the deserts of Arabia to
Aleppo and Scanderoon ; and from thence by sea again
to Italy, and so over land into France; and this, put
together, might be, at least, a full diameter of the
globe ; but, if it were to be measured, I suppose it
would appear to be a great deal more.
I had another way before me, which was to wait
for some English ships, which were coming to Bengal,
from Achin, on the island of Sumatra, and get pas-
sage on board them for England: but as I came
hither without any concern with the English East-
India Company, so it would be difficult to go from
hence without their licence, unless with great savour
of the captains of the ships, or of the company's sac-
tors; and to both I was an utter stranger.
Here I had the particular pleasure, speaking by
contrarieties, to fee the ship set sail without me; a
treatment, I think, a man in my circumstances scarce
ever met with, except from pirates running away with
a ship, and setting those that would not agree with
their villainy on shore: indeed, this was the next
door to it, both ways. However, my nephew left
me two servants, or rather, one companion, and one
servant: the first was clerk to the purser, whom he
engaged to go with me; and the other was his own
servant. I took me also a good lodging in the house
Vol. II. R of
of an Englis}j woman, where several merchants lodged,
some French, two Italians, or rather Jews, and one
Englishman. Here I was handsomely enough enter-
tained; and, that I might not be said to run rashly
upon any thing, I stayed here above nine months,
considering what course to take, and how to manage
myself. I had some Englis}j goods with me of value,
and a considerable sum of money; my nephew fur-
nishing me with a thousand pieces of eight, and a
letter of credit for more, if I had occasion, that I
might not be straitened, whatever might happen.
I quickly disposed of my goods, and to advan-
tage too; and, as I originally intended, I bought
here some very good diamonds, which, of all other
things, was the most proper for me, in my circum-
stances, because I might always carry my whole estate
about me.
After a long stay here, and many proposals made
for my return to England, but none salling to my
mind, the Engli/h merchant, who lodged with me,
and with whom 1 had contracted an intimate ac-
quaintance, came to me one morning: Country,
man, says he, I have a project to communicate to you,
which, as it suits with my thoughts, may, for aught
I know, suit with your's also, when you mail have
thoroughly considered it.
Here we are posted, says he, you by accident, and
I by my own choice, in a part of the world very re.
mote from our own country ; but it is in a country
where, by us who understand trade and business, a
great deal of money is to be got: if you will put a
thousand pounds to my thousand pounds, we will
hire a ship here, the first we can get to our minds,
you
you shall be captain, I'll be merchant, and we
will go a trading voyage to China : for what should
we stand still for? The whole world is in motion,
rolling round and round; all the creatures of God,
heavenly bodies and earthly, are busy and dili.
gent: why should we be idle? There are no drones,
says he, living in the world but men: why ihould
we be of that number?
I liked this proposal very well; and the more, be-
cause it seemed to be expressed with so much good
will, and in so friendly a manner. I will not say,
but that I might, by my loose and unhinged cir-
cumstances, be the sitter to embrace a proposal for
trade, and, indeed, for any thing else; or other-
wise, trade was none of my element: however, I
might, perhaps, say, with some truth, that if trade
was not my element, rambling was; and no propo-
sal for seeing any part of the world, which I had
never seen before, could possibly come amiss to
me.
It was, however, some time before we could get a
ship to our mind; and when we got a vessel, it was
not easy to get English sailors; that is to say, so many
as were necessary to govern the voyage, and manage
the sailors which we should pick up there. After
some time we got a mate, a boatswain, and a gunner,
English; a Dutch carpenter, and three Portuguese^
foremast men; with these, we found we could do
well enough, having Indian seamen, such as they are,
to make up.
There are so many travellers who have written the
history of their voyages and travels this way, that it
would be but very little diversion to any body, to
R 2 give
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
give a long account of the places we went to, and the
people who inhabit there: those things I leave to
others, and refer the reader to those journals and
travels of Englishmen, many of which, I find, are
published, and more promised every day. It is
enough for me to tell you, that we made the voyage
to Acbin, in the island of Sumatra, first; and from
thence to Siam, where we exchanged some of our
wares for opium, and for some arrack; the first, a
commodity which bears a great price among the
Chinese, and which, at that time, was very much
wanted there : in a word, we went up to Susham;
made a very great voyage ; were eight months out;
and returned to Bengal: and I was very well satisfied
with my adventure. I observe, that our people in
England, often admire how the osficers, which the
Company fend into India, and the merchants which
generally stay there, get such very good estates as
they do, and sometimes come home worth sixty,
seventy, and an hundred thousand pounds at a
time.
But it is no wonder, or, at least, we shall fee so
much sarther into it, when we consider the innume-
rable ports and places where they have a free com-
merce, that it will then be no wonder; and much less
will it be so, when we consider, that all those places and
ports where the English ships come, there is so much,
and such constant demand for the growth of all other
countries, that there is a certain vent for the re-
turn, as well as a market abroad for the goods car-
ried out.
In short, we made a very good voyage, and I got
so much money by the first adventure, and such an
insight
245
insight into the method of getting more, that, had I
been twenty years younger, I should have been
tempted to have stayed here, and sought no sarther
for making my fortune: but what was all this to a
man on the wrong side of threescore, that was rich
enough, and came abroad more in obedience to a
restless defire of seeing the world, than a covetous
defire of getting in it? And, indeed, I think, it is
with great justice that I now call it a restless defire;
for it was so: when I was at home, I was restless to
go abroad; and now I was abroad, I was restless to
be at home. I say, what was this gain to me? I
was rich enough already; nor had I any uneasy de-
fires about getting more money; and therefore, the
profits of the voyage to me, were things of no great
force to me, for the prompting me forward to sar-
ther undertakings: hence I thought, that by this
voyage I had made no progress at all ; because I was
come back, as I might call it, to the place from
whence I came, as to an home; whereas my eye,
which, like that which Solomon speaks of, was
never satisfied with seeing, was still more defirous of
wandering and seeing. I was come into a part of the
world which I never was in before; and that part in
particular, which I had heard much of; and was
resolved to see as much of it as I could; and then I
thought, I might say, I had seen all the world that
was worth seeing.
But my fellow-traveller and I had different notions:
I do not name this to insist upon my own, for I ac-
knowledge his was most just, and the most suited to
the end of a merchant's life; who, when he is
R 3 abroad
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
abroad upon adventures, it is his wisdom to stick to
that, as the best thing for him, which he is like to
get the most money by. My new friend kept himself
to the nature of the thing, and would have been con-
tent to have gone, like a carrier's horse, always to
the same inn, backward and forward, provided he
could, as he called it, find his account in it : on the
other hand, mine, as old as I was, was the notion of
a mad rambling boy, that never cares to fee a thing
twice over.
But this was not all : I had a kind of impatience
upon me to be nearer home, and yet the most un-
settled resolution imaginable, which way to go. In
the interval of these consultations, my friend, who
was always upon the search for business, proposed
another voyage to me, viz. among the Spice-Iflands;
and to bring home a load of cloves from the Manillas,
or thereabouts ; places where, indeed, the Dutch do
trade, but the islands belong partly to the Spaniards .
though we went not so sar, but to some other, where
they have not the whole power as they have at Bata-
.via, Ceylon, &c. We were not long in preparing for
this voyage; the chief disficulty was in bringing me
to come into it; however, at last, nothing else offering,
and finding that really stirring about and trading, the
profit being so great, and, as I may say, certain,
had more pleasure in it, and more satissaction to the •
mind, than sitting still; which, to me especially,
was the unhappiest part of life, I resolved on this
voyage too: which we made very successfully, touch-
ing at Borneo, and several iflands, whose names I do
not remember, and came home in about five months.
We fold our spice, which was chiefly cloves, and
4 some
247
some nutmegs, to the Persian merchants, who car-
ried them away for the Gulph; and, making near five
of one, we really got a great deal of money.
My friend, when we made up this account, smiled
at me: Well now, said he, with a sort of an agreeable
insult upon my indolent temper, is not this better
than walking about here, like a man of nothing to
do, and spending our time in staring at the nonsense
and ignorance of the Pagans? "Why truly, said I,
my friend, I think it is; and I begin to be a convert
to rhe principles of merchandizing. But I must tell
you, said I, by the way, you do not know what I
am doing; for if once I conquer my backwardness,
and embark heartily, as old as I am, I shall harrass
you up and down the world till I tire you; for
I shall pursue it so eagerly, I shall never let you
lie still.
But to be short with my speculations: a little while
after this, there came in a Dutch ship from Batavia;
she was a coaster, not an European trader, and of
about two hundred tons burden: the men, as they
pretended, having been so sickly, that the captain
had not men enough to go to sea with, he lay by at
Bengal; and, as if having got money enough, or
being willing, for other reasons, to go for Europe^
he gave public notice, that he would fell his ship:
this came to my ears before my new partner heard of
it; and I had a great mind to buy it. So I went
home to him, and told him of it: he considered
awhile, for he was no rash man neither; but musing
some time, he replied, She is a little too big; but,
however, we will have her. Accordingly we bought
the ship y and, agreeing with the master, we paid
R 4 for
for her, and took possession; when we had done so,
we resolved to entertain the men, if we could, to
join them with those we had, for the pursuing our
business; but on a sudden, they not having received
their wages, but their share of the money, as we af-
terwards learnt, not one of them was to be found.
We enquired much about them, and at length were
told, that they were all gone together, by land, to
Agra, the great city of the Mogul's residence; and
from thence were to travel to Surat, and so by sea to
the gulph of Persia.
Nothing had so heartily troubled me a good while,
as that I missed the opportunity of going with them;
for such a ramble, I thought, and in such company
as would both have guarded me, and diverted me,
would have suited mightily with my great design;
and I should both have seen the world, and gone
homewards too; but I was much better satisfied a
few days after, when I came to know what fort of
fellows they were; for, in short, their history was,
that this man they called captain was the gunner only,
not the commander; that they had been a trading
voyage, in which they were attacked on shore by
some of the Malaccans, who had killed the captain
and three of his men; and that after the captain
was killed, these men, eleven in number, had re-
solved to run away with the {hip, which they did;
and had brought her in at the hay of Bengal, leav-
ing the mate and five men more on fliore; of whom
we mall hear sarther.
Well; let them come by the ship how they would,
we came honestly by her, as we thought; though
we did not, I confess, examine into things so ex-
actly
249
actly as we ought; for we never enquired any
thing of the seamen, who, if we had examined,
would certainly have saultered in their accounts,
contradicted one another, and perhaps have contra-
dicted themselves; or, one how or other, we
should have seen reason to have suspected them: but
the man shewed us a bill of sale for the ship, to one
Emanuel Clostershoven, or some such name (for I sup-
pose it was all a forgery) and called himself by that
name; and we could not contradict him; and being
withal a little too unwary, or at least, having no
suspicion of the thing, we went through with our
bargain.
However we picked up some Engliflj seamen here
after this, and some Dutch; and we now resolved
fora second voyage to the south-east, for cloves, &c»
that is to say, among the Philippine and Malacca
ifles; and, in short, not to fill this part of my story
with trifles, when what is yet to come is so remark-
able, I spent, from first to last, six years in this coun-
try, trading from port to port, backward and for-
ward, and with very good success; and was
now the last year with my partner, going in the
ship above-mentioned, on a voyage to China; but
designing first to go to Siam, to buy rice.
In this voyage, being by contrary winds obliged
to beat up and down a great while in the straits of
Malacca, and among the islands, we were no sooner
got clear of those disficult seas, but we found our
ship had sprung a leak,'and we were not able, by all
our industry, to find out where it was. This forced
us to make for some port; and my partner, who
knew the country better than I did, directed the
captain to put into the river of Cambodia; for I
had
had made the English mate, one Mr. Thompson, cap-
tain, not being willing to take the charge of the
ihip upon myself: This river lies on the north fide
of the great bay or gulph, which goes up to Siam.
While we were here, and going often on shore
for refreshment, there comes to me one day an Eng-
lislman, and he was, it seems, a gunner's mate on
board an English Eqsl India ship, which rode in the
same river, up at, or near the city of Cambodia:
what brought him hither we knew not; but he comes
up to me, and, speaking Etiglistj, Sir, says he, you
are a stranger to me, and I to you; but I have
something to tell you, that very nearly concerns
you.
I looked stedsastly at him a good while, and he
thought at first I had known him, but I did not: If
it very nearly concerns me, said I, and not your-
self, what moves you to tell it me? I am moved,
says he, by the imminent danger you are in; and for
aught I fee, you have no knowledge of it. I know
no danger I am in, said I, but that my ship is leaky,
and I cannot find it out; but I propose to lay her
aground to-morrow, to see if I can find it. But, Sir,
says he, leaky or not leaky, find it or not find it,
you will be wiser than to lay your ship on shore
to-morrow, when you hear what I have to say to you:
Do you know, Sir, said he, the town of Cambodia
lies about fifteen leagues up this river? And there
are two large English ships about five leagues on this
fide, and three Dutch. Well said I, and what is
that to me? Why, Sir, says he, is it for a man that
is upon such adventures as you are, to come into a
port,' and not examine first what ships there are there,
and whether he is able to deal with them? I suppose
you do not think you are a match for them? I was
amused very much at his discourse, but not amazed
at it; for I could not conceive what he meant; and
I turned short upon him, and said, Sir, I wish you
would explain yourself; I cannot imagine what rea-
son I have to be afraid of any of the Company's
ships, or Dutch ships; I am no interloper; what can
they have to say to me?
He looked like a man half angry, half pleased;
and, pausing awhile, but smiling, Well, Sir, says
he, if you think yourself secure, you must take your
chance; I am sorry your sate should blind you against
good advice; but assure yourself, if you do not put
to sea immediately, you will the very next tide be
attacked by five long-boats full of men; and, per-
haps if you are taken, you will be hanged for a pi-
rate, and the particulars be examined into after-
wards: I thought, Sir, added he, I mould have
met with a better reception than this, for doing you
a piece of service of such importance. I can never
be ungrateful, said I, for any service, or to any man
that offers me any kindness; but it is past my com-
prehension, said I, what they mould have such a de-
sign upon me for: However, since you say there is
no time to be lost, and that there is some villainous
design in hand against me, I will go on board this
minute, and put to sea immediately,' if my men can
stop the leak, or if we can swim without stopping it:
But, Sir, said I, shall I go away ignorant of the rea-
son of all this? Can you give me no sarther light
into it?
I can
I can tell you but part of the story, Sir, says he ; but
I have a Dutch seaman here with me, and, I believe,
I could persuade him to tell you the rest; but there
is scarce time for it: But the short of the story is
this, the sirst part of which, I suppose, you know
well enough, viz. That you were with this ship at Su-
matra; that there your captain was murdered by
the Malaccans, with three of his men; and that
you, or some of those that were on board with you, ran
away with the snip, and are since turned PIRATES.
This is the sum of the story, and you will all be seized
as pirates, I can assure you, and executed with very
little ceremony; for you know merchant ships shew
but little law to pirates, if they get them in their
power.
Now you speak plain English, said I, and I thank
you; and though I know nothing that we have done,
like what you talk of, but I am sure we came honest-
ly and sairly by the ship; yet seeing such work is a
doing, as you say, and that you seem to mean ho-
nestly, I will be upon my guard. Nay, Sir, says
he, do not talk of being upon your guard; the best
defence is to be out of the danger: if you have any
regard to your life, and the lives of all your men,
put out to sea without sail at high-water; and as
you have a whole tide before you, you will be gone
too sar out before they can come down; for they will
come away at high water; and as they have twenty
miles to come, you'll get near two hours of them
by the difference of the tide, not reckoning the length
of the way: Besides, as they are only boats, and
not ships, they will not venture to follow you sar out
to sea, especially if it blows.
Well,
253
Well, said I, you have been very kind in this:
"What shall I do for you to make you amends? Sir,
says he, you may not be so willing to make me
amends, because you may not be convinced of the
truth of it: I will make an osfer to you; I have
nineteen months pay due to me on board the ship
OF ROBINSON CRUSOE.
Dutchman, that is with me, has seven months pay
due to him; if you will make good our pay to us,
we will go along with you: If you find nothing
more in it, we will defire no more; but if we do
convince you, that we have saved your life, and the
ship, and the lives of all the men in her, we will leave
the rest to you.
I consented to this readily; and went immediately
on board, and the two men with me. As soon as I
came to the ship's side, my partner, who was on
board, came on the quarter-deck, and called to me
with a great deal of joy, O ho! O ho! we have
stopped the leak! Say you so, said I, thank God;
but weigh the anchor then immediately: Weigh!
says he, what do you mean by that? What is the
matter? says he. AIk no questions, said I, but all
hands to work, and weigh without losing a minute.
He was surprised: But, however, he called the cap-
tain, and he immediately ordered the anchor to be
got up; and though the tide was not quite done, yet
a little land-breeze blowing, we stood out to sea;
then I called him into the cabin, and told him the
story at large; and we called in the men, and they
told us the rest of it: but as it took us up a great
deal of time, so before we had done, a seaman
comes to the cabin-door, and calls out to us, that
the
1
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
the captain bade him tell us, we were chased:
Chased, said I, by whom, and by what? By five
sloops, or boats, said the fellow, full of men. Very
well, said I; then it is apparent there is something
in it. In the next place, I ordered all our men to
be called up: and told them, that there was a de-
sign to seize the ship, and to take us for pirates;
and asked them, if they would stand by us, and by
one another? The men answered, chearfully, one
and all, that they would live and die with us. Then
I asked the captain, what way he thought best for
us to manage a fight with them: For resist them I
resolved we would, and that to the last drop. He
said, readily, that the way was to keep them off
with our great {hot, as long as we could, and then
to fire at them with our small arms, to keep them
from boarding us; but when neither of these would
do any longer, we mould retire to our close quar-
ters; perhaps they had not materials to break open
our bulk-heads, or get in upon us.
The gunner had, in the mean time, orders to bring
two guns to bear fore and aft, out of the steerage, to
clear the deck, and load them with musquet-bullets,
and small pieces of old iron, and what next came to
hand; and thus we made ready for fight; but all
this while kept out to sea, with wind enough, and
could fee the boats at a distance, being five large
long-boats following us, with all the sail they could
make.
Two of these boats, which, by out glasses, we
could fee were English, had out-sailed the rest, were
near two leagues a-head of them, and gained upon
us considerably; lo that we found they would come
up with us: upon which we fired a gun without a
(hot, to intimate that they should bring to; and we
put out a" flag of truce, as a signal for parley; but
they kept crowding after us, till they came within
shot: upon this we took in our white flag, they
having made no answer to it, hung out the red flag,
and fired at them with shot: Notwithstanding this,
they came on till they were near enough to call to
them with a speaking trumpet, which we had on
board; so we called to them, and bade them keep
off at their peril.
It was all one, they crowded after us, and en-
deavoured to come under our stern, so to board us
on our quarter: Upon which, seeing they were re-
solute for mischief, and depended upon the strength
that followed them, I ordered to bring the ship to,
so that they lay upon our broadside, when immedi-
ately we fired five guns at them; one of them had
been levelled so true, as to carry away the stern of
the hindermost boat, and bring them to the necessity
of taking down their sail, and running all to the
head of the boat to keep her from sinking; so me
lay by, and had enough of it; but seeing the fore-
most boat still crowd on after us, we made ready to
fire at her in particular.
While this was doing, one of the three boats that
was behind, being forwarder than the other two,
made up to the boat which we had disabled, to re-
lieve her, and we could afterwards fee her take out
the men: we called again to the foremost boat, and
offered a truce to parley again, and to know what
was her business with us; but had no answer: only
she crowded close under our stern. Upon this our
gunner
gunner, who was a very dexterous fellow, run out
his two chace guns, and fired at her; but the shot
missing, the men in the boat shouted, waved their
caps, and came on; but the gunner, getting quickly-
ready again, fired among them a second time; one
shot of which, though it missed the boat itself, yet
fell in among the men, and we could easily see had
done a great deal of mischief among them; but we,
taking no notice of that, weared the ship again, and
brought our quarter to bear upon them; and, firing
three guns more, we found the boat was split almost
to pieces; in particular, her rudder, and a piece of
her stern, were shot quite away; so they handed
their sail immediately, and were in great disorder:
but, to compleat their misfortune, our gunner let
fly two guns at them again; where he hit them we
could not tell, but we found the boat was sinking,
and some of the men already in the water:—
Upon this I immediately manned out our pinnace,
which we had kept close by our side, with orders to
pick up some of the men, if they could, and save
them from drowning, and imediately to come on
board with them; because we saw the rest of the
boats began to come up. Our men in the pinnace
followed their orders, and took up three men; one
of which was just drowning, and it was a good while
before we could recover him. As soon as they were
on board, we crowded all the sail we could make,
and stood sarther out to sea; and we found, that
when the other three boats came up to the first two,
they gave over their chace.
Being
Being thus delivered from a danger, which tho'
I knew not the reason of it, yet seemed to be much
greater than I apprehended, I took care that we should
change our course, and not let any one imagine whi-
ther we were going; so we stood out to sea eastward,
quite out of the course of all European ships, whe-
ther they were bound to China, or any where else,
within the commerce of the European nations.
When we were now at sea, we began to consult
with the two seamen, and enquire first, what the
meaning of all this should be? The Dutchman let us
into the secret of it at once; telling us, that the fel-
low that fold us the ship, as we said, was no more
than a thief that had run away with her. Then he
told us how the captain, whose name too he men-
tioned, though I do not remember it now, was
treacherously murdered by the natives on the coast of
Malacca, with three of his men; and that he, this
Dutchman, and four more, got into the woods, where
they wandered about a great while; till at length, he,
in particular, in a miraculous manner, made his
escape, and swam off to a Dutch ship, which sailing
near the more, in its way from China, had sent their
boat on shore for fresh water; that he durst not
come'to that part of the shore where the boat was,
but made shift in the night to take in the water
sarther off, and swimming a great while, at last the
ship's boat took him up.
He then told us, that he went to Batavia, where
two of the seamen belonging to the ship had arrived,
having deserted the rest in their travels; and gave
an account, that the fellow who had run away with
the ship, sold her at Bengal to a set of pirates, which
Voin II. S were
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
were gone a cruising in her; and that they had al-
ready taken an E/iglish ship, and two Dutch ships,
very richly laden.
This latter part we found to concern us directly;
and though we knew it to be salse, yet, as my part-
ner said very well, if we had sallen into their hands,
and they had such a prepossession against us before-
hand, it had been in vain for us to have defended
ourselves, or to hope for any good quarters at their
hands; especially considering that -our accusers had
been our judges, and that we could have expected
nothing from them but what rage would have dic-
tated, and ungoverned passion have executed; and
there/ore it was his opinion, we should go directly
back to Bengal, from whence we came, without put-
ting in at any port whatever; because there we could
give an account of ourselves, and could prove where
we were when the ship put in, whom we bought her
of, and the like; and, which was more than all the
rest, if we were put to the necessity of bringing it
before the proper judges, we should be sure to have
some justice; and not be hanged first, and judged
afterwards.
I was some time of my partner's opinion; but
after a little more serious thinking, I told him, I
thought it was a very great hazard for us to attempt
returning to Bengal, for that we were on the wrong
side of the straits of Malacca; and that if the
alarm was given, we should be sure to be way-laid on
every side, as well by the Dutch of Batavia, as the
Engtislj elsewhere; that if we should be taken, as it
were, running away, we should even condemn our-
selves, and there would want no more evidence to
destroy
destroy us. I also asked the English sailor's opinion,
who said, he was of my mind, and that we should
certainly be taken.
This danger a little startled my partner, and all
the ship's company; and we immediately resolved to
go away to the coast of Tonquin, and so on to China;
and from thence pursuing the first design, as to trade,
find some way or other to dispose of the ship, and
come back in some of the vessels of the country,
such as we could get. This was approved of as the
best method for our security; and accordingly we
steered away N. N. £. keeping above fifty leagues off
from the usual course to the eastward.
This, however, put us to some inconveniencies;
for first the winds, when we came to that distance
from the shore, seemed to be more steadily against
us, blowing almost trade, as we call it, from the east
and E. N. E. so that we were a long while upon our
voyage; and we were but ill provided with victuals
for so long a run; and, which was still worse, there
was some danger, that those English and Dutch ships,
whose boats pursued us, whereof some were bound
that way, might be got in before us; and if not,
some other ship, bound to China, might have infor-
mation of us from them, and pursue us with the
same vigour.
I must confess, I was now very uneasy, and thought
myself, including the late escape from the long-boats,
to have been in the most dangerous condition that
ever I was in through all my past life; for, whatever
ill circumstances I had been in, I was never pursued
for a thief before; nor had I ever done any thing
S 2 that
that merited the name of dishonest or fraudulent,
much less thievish. I had chiefly been mine own
enemy; or, as I may rightly say, I had been no-
body's enemy but my own. But now I was embar-
rassed in the worst condition imaginable; for though
I was perfectly innocent, I was in no condition to
make that innocence appear. And if I had been
taken, it had been under a supposed guilt of the
worst kind; at least, a crime esteemed so among the
people I had to do with.
This made me very anxious to make an escape,
though which way to do it, I knew not; or what
port or place we should go to. My partner, seeing
me thus dejected, though he was the most con-
cerned at first, began to encourage me; and de-
scribing to me the several ports of that coast, told
me, he would put in on the coast of Cochinchina, or
the bay of Tonquin; intending to go afterwards to
Macao, a town once in the possession of the Portu-
guese, and where still a great many European samilies
resided, and particularly the missionary priest usually
went thither, in order to their going forward to
China.
Hither we then resolved to go; and accordingly,
though after a tedious and irregular course, and very
much straitened for provisions, we came within sight
of the coast very early in the morning; and, upon
reflection upon the past circumstances we were in,
and the danger, if we had not escaped, we resolved
to put into a small river, which, however, had depth
enough of water for us, and to fee if we could, ei-
ther over land or by the ship's pinnace, come to
i know
know what (hips were in any port thereabouts. This
happy step was, indeed, our deliverance; for tho'
we did not immediately fee any European ships in the
bay of Tonquin, yet, the next morning, there came
into the bay two Dutch ships, and a third without
any colours spread out, but which we believed to be
a Dutchman, passed by at about two leagues distance,
steering for the coast of China/ and in the after-
noon went by two English ships, steering the same
course; and thus, we thought, we saw ourselves
beset with enemies, both one way and the other.
The place we were in was wild and barbarous, the
people thieves, even by occupation or profession;
and though, it is true, we had not much to seek of
them, and except getting a few provisions, cared not
how little we had to do with them; yet it was" with
much difficulty that we kept ourselves from being in-
sulted by them several ways.
We were in a small river of this country, within
a few leagues of its utmost limits northward; and by
our boat we coasted north-east to the point of land
which opens to the great bay of Tonquin; and it
was in this beating up along the shore, that we dis-
covered as above, that in a word, we were surrounded #
with enemies. The people we were among were
the most barbarous of all the inhabitants of the
coast; having no correspondence with any other na-
tion, and dealing only in fish and oil, and such gross
commodities; and it may be particularly seen, that
they are, as I said, the most barbarous of any of
the inhabitants, viz. that among other customs they
have this one, that if any vessel had the misfortune
S3 to
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
to be shipwrecked upon their coast, they presently
make the men all prisoners; that is to say, slaves;
and it was not long before we found a spice of their
kindness this way, on the occasion following:
I have observed above, that our ship sprung a
leak at sea, and that we could not find it out; and
however it happened, that, as I have said, it was
stopped unexpectedly, in the happy minute of our
being to be seized by the Dutch and English shipS,
near the bay of Siam; yet, as we did not find the
ship so perfectly tight and found as we defired, we
resolved, while we were in this place, to lay her
on shore, take out what heavy things we had on
board, which were not many, and to wash and clean
her bottom; and if possible, to find out where the
leaks were.
Accordingly, having lightened the ship, and brought
all our guns, and other moveable things, to one
side, we tried to bring her down, that we might
come at her bottom; for, on second thoughts, we
did not care to lay her dry a-ground, neither could
we find out a proper place for it.
The inhabitants, who had never been acquainted
with such a sight, came wondering down to the
shore to look at us; and seeing the ship lie down on
one side in such a manner, and heeling towards the
shore, and not seeing our men, who were at work
on her bottom, with stages, and with their boats on
the off side, they presently concluded that the ship
was cast away, and lay so very sast on the ground.
On this supposition they came all about us in two
or three hours time, with ten or twelve large boats,
4 having
having some of them eight, some ten men in a boat,
intending, no doubt, to have come on board" and
plundered the ship; and if they had found us there,
to have carried us away for slaves to their king, or
whatever they call him, for we knew not who was
their governor.
When they came up to the ship, and began to row
round her, they discovered us all hard at word, on
the outside of the ship's bottom and side, washing
and graving, and stopping, as every seasaring man
knows how.
They stood for a while gazing at us, and we, who
were a little surprized, could not imagine what their
design was; but, being willing to be sure, we took
this opportunity to get some of us into the ship, and
others to hand down arms and ammunition, to those
that were at work to defend themselves with, if there
should be occasion; and it was no more than need;
for, in less than a quarter of an hour's consultation,
they agreed, it seems, that the ship was really a
wreck; that we were all at work, endeavouring to
save her, or to save our lives by the help of our
boats; and when we handed our arms into the boats,
they concluded, by that motion, that we were endea-
vouring to save some of our goods. Upon this they
took it for granted they all belonged to them;
and away they came directly upon our men, as if it
had been in a line of battle.
Our men, seeing so many of them, began to be
frighted; for we lay but in an ill posture to fight, and
cried out to us to know what they should do? I im-
mediately called to the men who worked upon the
S 4 stages,
stages, to flip them down, and get up the side into
the ship; and bade those in the boat to row round
and come on board: and those few of us who were
on board, worked with all the strength and hands
we had, to bring the ship to rights; but however,
neither the men upon the stage, nor those in the
boats, could do as they were ordered, before the
Cochinchinese were upon them; and, with two of
their boats boarded our long-boat, and began to lay
hold of the men as their prisoners.
The first man they laid hold of was an English
seaman, a stout strong fellow, who having a mus-
quet in his hand, never offered to fire it, but laid it
down in the boat, like a fool, as I thought. But he
understood his business better than I could teach him;
for he grappled the pagan, and dragged him by main
force' out of their own boat into ours; where, tak-
ing him by the two ears, he beat his head so against
the boat's gunnel, that the fellow died instantly in
his hands; and in the mean time, a Dutchman, who
stood next, took up the musquet, and with the butt-
end of it, so laid about him, that he knocked down
five of them, who attempted to enter the boat: but
this was little towards resisting thirty or forty men,
who fearless, because ignorant of their danger, be-
gan to throw themselves into the long-boat, where
we had but five men to defend it: but one accident
gave our men a complete victory, which deserved
our laughter rather than any thing else; and that
was this:—
Our carpenter being prepared to grave the out-
side of the ship, as well as to pay the seams where
he
he had caulked her, to stop the leaks, had got two
kettles just let down into the boat; one filled with
boiling pitch, and the other with rosin, tallow, and
oil, and such stuff as the shipwrights used for that
work; and the man that tended the carpenter had
a great iron ladle in his hand, with which he sup-
plied the men that were at work with that hot stuff:
two of the enemy's men entered the boat just where
this fellow stood, being in the fore-sheets; he imme-
diately saluted them with a ladleful of the stuff, boiL
ing hot, which so burnt and scalded them, being
half naked, that they roared out like two bulls, and
enraged with the fire, leaped both into the sea. The
carpenter saw it, and cried out, Well done, Jack,
give them some more of it; when stepping forward
himself, he takes one of their mops, and dipping it
in the pitch pot, he and his man threw it among
them so plentifully, that, in short, of all the men
in three boats, there was not one that was not
scalded and burnt with it in a most frightful pi-
tiful manner, and made such an howling and crying,
that I never heard a worse noise, and, indeed, no-
thing like it: for it was worth observing, that tho'
pain naturally makes all people cry out, yet every
nation have a particular way of exclamation, and
make noises as different from one another as then-
speech. I cannot give the noise these creatures made
a better name than howling, nor a name more pro-
per to the tone of it; for I never heard any thing
more like the noise of the wolves, which, as I have
said, I heard howl in the forest on the frontiers of
Languedoc.
I was
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
I was never pleased with a victory better in my life;
not only as it was a perfect surprise to me, and that
our danger was imminent before; but as we got this
victory without any bloodshed, except of that man
the fellow killed with his naked hands, and which I
was very much concerned at; for I was sick of killing
such poor savage wretches, even though it was in my
own defence, knowing they came on errands which
they thought just, and knew no better: and that
though it may be a just thing, because necessary, for
there is no necessary wickedness in nature; yet I
thought it was a sad life, when we must be always
obliged to be killing our fellow-creatures to preserve
ourselves; and, indeed, I think so still; and I would,
even now, suffer a great deal, rather than I would
take away the life even of the worst person injuring
me. I believe also, all considering people, who know
the value of life, would be of my opinion, if they en-
tered seriously into the consideration of it.
But to return to my story: All the while this was do-
ing, my partner and I, who managed the rest of the
men on board, had, with great dexterity, brought
the ship almost to rights; and, having gotten the guns
into their places again, the gunner called to me, to
bid our boat get out of the way, for he would let fly
among them. I called back again to him, and bid
him not offer to fire, for the carpenter would do the
work without him; but bade him heat another pitch
kettle; which our cook, who was on board, took
care of. But the enemy was so terrified with what
they met with in their first attack, that they would
not come on again; and some of them, that were
sarthest off, seeing the ship swim, as it were, upright,
began
began, as we supposed, to see their mistake, and
gave over the enterprise, finding it was not as they
expected. Thus we got clear of this merry fight;
and, having gotten some rice, and some roots and
bread, with about sixteen good big hogs, on board,
two days before, we resolved to stay here no longer,
but go forward, whatever came of it; for we made
no doubt but we should be surrounded the next day
with rogues enough, perhaps more than our pitch-
kettle would dispose of for us.
We, therefore, got all our things on board the
fame evening, and the next morning were ready to
sail. In the mean time, lying at an anchor some
distance from the shore, we were not so much con-
cerned, being now in a fighting posture, as well as
in a sailing posture, if any enemy had presented. The
next day, having finished our work within board,
and finding our ship was perfectly healed of all her
leaks, we set sail: we would have gone into the bay
of Tonquin, for we wanted to inform ourselves of what
was to be known concerning the Dutch ships that
had been there; but we durst not stand in there, be-
cause we had seen several ships go in, as we supposed,
but a little before; so we kept on N. E. towards the
isle of Formosa, as much afraid of being seen by a
Dutch or English merchant stiip, as a Dutch or Englislj
merchant ship in the Mediterranean is of an Algerine
man of war.
When we were thus got to sea, we kept on N. E.
as if we would go to the Manillas or the Philippine
islands, and this we did, that we might not sall into
the way of any of the European ships; and then we
steered north again, till we came to the latitude
of
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
of 22 deg. 20 min. by which means we made the
ifland of Formosa directly, where we came to an an-
chor, in order to get water and fresli provisions,
which the people there, who are very courteous and
civil in their manners, supplied us with willingly,
and dealt very sairly and punctually with us in all
their agreements and bargains; which is what we
did not find among other people; and may be owing
to the remains of Christianity, which was once
planted here by a Dutch missionary of protestants,
and is a testimony of what I have often observed, viz.
That the Christian religion always civilizes the peo-
ple, and reforms their manners, where it is received,
whether it works saving effects upon them or not.
From hence we sailed still north, keeping the coast
of China at an equal distance, till we knew we were
beyond all the ports of China, where our European
ships usually come; but being resolved, if possible,
not to sall into any of their hands, especially in this
country, where, as our circumstances were, we could
not sail of being entirely ruined; nay, so great was
my fear in particular, as to my being taken by them,
that I believe firmly I would much rather have chosen
to sall into the hands of the Spanish inquisition,
Being now come to the latitude of 30 degrees, we
resolved to put info the first trading port we mould
come at; and standing in for the shore, a boat came
off two leagues to us, with an old Portuguese pilot on
board, who, knowing us to be an European ship,
came to offer his service, which, indeed, we were
very glad of, and took him on board; upon which,
without asking us whither we would go, he dismisled
the boat he came in, and sent it back.
I thought
269
I thought it was now so much in our choice to make
the old man carry us whither we would, that I began
to talk with him about carrying us to the Gulpb of
Nanquin, which is the most northern part of the
coast of China. The old man said he knew the
Gulpb of Nanquin very well; but smiling, asked us
what we would do there?
I told him we would fell our cargo, and purchase
China wares, callicoes, raw silks, tea, wrought silks,
&c. and so would return by the same course we came.
He told us our best port had been to have put in at
Macao, where we could not sail of a market for our
opium, to our satissaction, and might, for our money,
have purchased all sorts of China goods, as cheap as
we could at Nanquin.
Not being able to put the old man out of his talk,
of which he was very opiniated, or conceited, I told
him, we were gentlemen as well as merchants; and
that we had a mind to go and fee the great city of
Pckin, and the samous court of the monarch of
China. Why then, says the old man, you should
go to Ningpo, where, by the river that runs into the
sea there, you may go up within five leagues of the
great canal. This canal is a navigable made stream,
which goes through the heart of all that vast empire
of China, crosses all the rivers, passes some conside-
rable hills by the help of sluices and gates, and goes
up to the city of Pekin, being in length near 270
leagues.
Well, said I, Seignior Portuguese, but that is not
our business now: the great question is, If you can
carry us up to the city of Nanquin, from whence we
C|a travel to Pekin afterwards? Yes, he said, he
could
could do so very well, and there was a great Dutch
ship gone up that way just before. This gave me a
little shock ; a Dutch ship was now our terror, and
we had much rather have met the devil, at least if he
had not come in too frightful a figure: we depended
upon it, that a Dutch ship would be our destruction,
for we were in no condition to fight them; all the
ships they trade with in those parts being of great
burden, and of much greater force than we were.
The old man found me a little confused, and under
some concern, when he named a Dutch ship; and
said to me, Sir, you need be under no apprehension
of the Dutch, I suppose they are not now at war with
your nation. No, said I, that's true; but I know
not what liberties men may take, when they are
out of the reach of the laws of their country. Why,
said he, you are no pirates, what need you fear?
They will not meddle with peaceable merchants,
sure.
If I had any blood in my body that did not fly up
into my sace at that word, it was hindered by some
stop in the vessels appointed by nature to circulate it;
for it put me into the greatest disorder and confu-
sion imaginable; nor was it possible for me to con-
ceal it so, but that the old man easily perceived it.
Sir, said he, I find you are in some disorder in
your thoughts at my talk: pray be pleased to go
which way you think fit; and depend upon it, I'll
do you all the service I can. Why, Seignior, said
I, it is true, I am a little unsettled in my resolution
at this time, whither to go in particular; and I am
something more so, for what you said about pirates;
I hope there are no pirates in these seas; we are but
in
m an ill condition to meet with them; for you fee we
have but a small force, and but very weakly manned.
O, Sir, said he, do not be concerned; I do not
know that there have been any pirates in these seas
these fifteen, years, except one, which was seen, as I
hear, in the bay of Siam, about a month since; but
you may be assured she is gone to the southward;
nor was she a ship of any great force, or fit for the
work: she was not built for a privateer, but was run
away with by a reprobate crew that were on board,
after the captain and some of his men had been
murdered by the Malaccans, at or near the island of
Sumatra.
What! said I, seeming to know nothing of the
matter, did they murder the captain? No, said he,
I do not understand that they murdered him; but, as
they afterwards ran away with the ship, it is gene-
rally believed they betrayed him into the hands of
the Malaccans, who did murder him; and, perhaps,
they procured them to do it. Why then, said I,
they deserved death, as much as if they had done it
themselves. Nay, said the old man, they do deserve
it; and they will certainly have it if they light upon
any English or Dutch ship; for they have all agreed
together, that if they meet that rogue, they will
give him no quarter.
But, said I to him, you say the pirate is gone out
of these seas; how can they meet with him then?
Why, that is true, said he, they do say so; but he was,
as I tell you, in the bay of Siam, in the river Cambodia,
and was discovered there by some Dutchmen, who
belonged to the ship, and who were left on shore
when
when they run away with her; and some Englijh
and Dutch traders being in the river, they were with-
in a little of taking him. Nay, said he, if the fore-
most boats had been well seconded by the rest, they
had certainly taken him; but he, finding only two
boats within reach of him, tacked about, and fired at
these two, and disabled them before the others came
up; and then standing off to sea, the others were
not able to follow him, and so he got away. But
they have all so exact: a description of the ship, that
they will be sure to know him; and wherever they
find him, they have vowed to give no quarter to
either the captain or the seamen, but to hang them
all up at the yard-arm.
What! said I, will they execute them right or
wrong; hang them first, and judge them afterwards?
O, Sir! said the old pilot, there is no need to make
a formal business of it with such rogues as those;
let them tie them back to back, and set them a div-
ing; it is no more than they rightly deserve.
I knew I had my old man sast aboard, and that
he could do me no harm; so I turned short upon
him: Well, Seignior, said I, and this is the very
reason why I would have you carry us lo Nanquin,
and not to put back to Macao, or to any other part
of the country, where the English or Dutch ships
. came; for, be it known to you, Seignior, those cap-
tains of the English and Dutch ships, are a parcel of
rash, proud, insolent fellows, that neither know
what belongs to justice, or how to behave them-
selves, as the laws of God and nature direct; but
being proud of their offices, and not understanding
their power, they would act the murderers to punish
robbers j
robbers; would take upon them to insult men salse-
ly accused, and determine them guilty without due
Enquiry; and perhaps I may live to call some of them
to an account for it, where they may be taught how.
justice is to be executed; and that no man ought to
be treated as a criminal till some evidence may be
had of the crime, and that he is the man.
With this I told him, that this was the very ship
they had attacked; and gave him a full account of
the skirmim we had with their boats, and how fool-
ishly and coward-like they had behaved. I told
him all the story of our buying the ship, and how
the Dutchmen served us. I told him the reasons I
had to believe that this story of killing the master
by the Malaccans was not true; as also the running
away with the ship; but that it was all a fiction of
their own, to suggest that the men were turned pi-
rates; and they ought to have been sure it was so,
before they had ventured to attack us by surprise,
and oblige us to resist them; adding, that they
Would have the blood of those men, who were killed
there, in our just defence, to answer for.
The old mast was amazed at this relation; and told
us, we were very much in the right to go away to the
north; and that if he might advise us, it should be to
fell the ship in China, which we might very well do,
and buy or build another in the country: and, said
he, though you will not get so good a ship, yet you
may get one able enough to carry you and all your
goods back again to Bengal, or any where else.
I told him I would take his advice, when I came to
any port where I could find a ship for my turn, or get
any customer to buy this. He replied, I should
Vol. II. T meet
meet with customers enough for the ship at,Nanqu'm,
and that a Cbinese]unk would serve me very well to go
back again; and that he would procure me people
both to buy one, and sell the other.
Well, but, Seignior, says I, as you say they know
the ship so well, I may, perhaps, if I follow your
measures, be instrumental to bring some honest inno-
cent men into a terrible broil, and, perhaps, be mur-
dered in cold blood; for wherever they find the
ship they will prove the guilt upon the men, by prov-
ing this was the ship; and so innocent men may pro-
bably be overpowered and murdered. Why, said
the old man, I'll find out a way to prevent that also;
for as I know all those commanders you speak of very
well, and shall see them all as they pass by, 1 will be
sure to set them to rights in the thing, and let them
know that they had been so much in the wrong; that
though the people who were on board at first might
run away with the ship, yet it was not true that they
had turned pirates; and that in particular those were
not the men that first went off with the ship, but inno-
cently bought her for their trade: and I am per-
suaded they will so sar believe me, as, at least, to act
more cautiously for the time to come. Well, said I,
and will you deliver one message to them from me?
Yes, I will, says he, if you will give it under your
hand, in writing, that I may be able to prove it came
from you, and not out of my own head. I answered,
that I would readily give it him under my hand. So
I took a pen and ink, and paper, and wrote at large
the story of assaulting me with the long-boats, &c.
the pretended reason of it, and the unjust cruel deiign
of it; and concluded to the commanders, that they
had
had done what they not only should have been
ashamed of, but also, that if ever they came to
England, and I lived to see them there, they should
all pay dearly for it, if the laws of my country were
not grown out of use before I arrived there.
My old pilot read this over and over again, and
asked me several times, if I would stand to it. I
answered, I would stand to it as long as I had anv
thing left in the world; being sensible that I should,
one time or other, find an opportunity to put it home
to them. But we had no occasion ever to let the
pilot carry this letter; for he never went back again.
While those things were passing between us, by way
of discourse, we went forward directly for Nanquin,
and, in about thirteen days sail, came to anchor at
the south-west point of the great gulph of Nanquin;
where, by the way, I came by accident to under-
stand, that the two Dutch ships were gone that length
before me, and that I should certainly sall into their
hands. I consulted my partner again in this exi-
gency, and he was as much at a loss as I was, and
would very gladly have been safe on shore al-
most any where. However, I was not in such per-
plexity neither, but I asked the old pilot if there was
no creek, or harbour, which I might pui into, and
pursue my business with the Chinese privately, and be
in no danger of the enemy? He told me, if I would
sail to the southward about two and forty leagues,
there was a little port called Shtinchang, where the
sathers of the mission usually landed from Macao, on
their progress to teach the Christian religion to the
Chinese, and where no European ships ever put in;
and, if I thought proper to put in there, I might con-
T 2 slder
sider what sarther course to take when I was on shoret-
He confessed, he said, it was not a place for mer-
chants, except that at some certain times they had a
kind of a sair there, when the merchants from
Japan came over thither to buy the Chinese mer-
chandizes.
We all agreed to go back to this place: the name
of the port, as he called it, I may, perhaps spell
wrong , for I do not particularly remember it, having
lost this, together with the names of many other
places set down in a little pocket-book, which was
spoiled by the water, on an accident which I shall
relate in its order; but this I remember, that the
Chinese or Japanese merchants we correspond with
call it by a different name from that which our Por-
tuguese pilot gave it,, and pronounced it as above,:
S$uincbang.
As we were unanimous in our resolutions to go to'
this place, we weighed the next day, having only
gone twice on more, where we were to get fresh water;
on both which occasions the people of the country
wrere very civil to us, and brought us abundance of
things to fell to us; I mean of provisions, plants,
roots, tea, rice, and some fowls; but nothing, with-
out money-
We came to the other port (the wind being con-
trary) not till five days; but it was very much to our-
satissaction; and I was joyful, and, I may say^
thankful, when I set my foot safe on more; resolving^
and my partner too, that if it was possible to dispose,
of ourselves and effects any other way, though not
every way to our satissaction, we would never set one
foot on board that unhappy vessel again: and indeed,
I must
5 must acknowledge, that of all the circumstances of
life that ever I had any experience of, nothing makes
mankind so completely miserable as that of being in
constant fear. Well does the scripture say, 'The
fear of man brings a snareit is a life of death; and
the mind is so entirely suppressed by it, that it is ca-
pable of no relief; the animal spirits sink, and all
the vigour of nature, which usually supports men
under other afflictions, and is present to them in the
greatest exigencies, sails them here.
Nor did it sail of its usual operations upon the sancy,
iby heightening every danger; representing the En-
glis}j and Dutch captains to be men incapable of hear-
ing reason, or distinguishing between honest men and
rogues; or between a story calculated for our own
turn, made out of nothing, on purpose to deceive, and
a true genuine account of our whole voyage, progress,
and design; for we might many ways have convinced
any reasonable creature that we were not pirates; the
goods we had on board, the course we steered, our
frankly shewing ourselves, and entering into such and
such ports; even our very manner, the force we had,
ihe number of men, the few arms, little ammunition,
and short provisions; all these would have served to
convince any man that we were no pirates. The
•opium, and other goods we had on board, would
make it appear the ship had been at Bengal; the
Dutchmen, who, it was said, had the names of all the
men that were in the ship, might easily fee that we
were a mixture of English, Portuguese, and Indians,
and but two Dutchmen on board. These, and many
other particular circumstances, might have made it
'evident to the understanding of any commander*
T 3 whose
whose hands we might sall into, that we were no
pirates.
But fear, that blind useless passion, worked another
way, and threw us into the vapours; it bewildered
our understandings, and set the imagination at work,
to form* a thousand terrible things, that, perhaps-,
might never happen. We first supposed, as indeed
every body had related to us, that the seamen on board
the Englisl) and Dutch ships, but especially the Dutch,
were so enraged at the name of a pirate, and especially
at our beating off their boats, and escaping, that they
would not give themselves leave to enquire whether we
were pirates or no; but would execute us off-hand,
as we call it, without giving us any room for a de-
fence. We reflected that there was really so much
apparent evidence before them, that they would scarce
enquire after any more: as, first, that the ship was
certainly the same, and that some of the seamen
among them knew ,her, and had been on board her;
and, secondly, that when we had intelligence at the
river Cambodia, that they were coming down to ex-
amine us, we fought their boats, and fled: So that we
made no doubt but they were as fully satisfied of our
being pirates, as we were satisfied of the contrary;
and I often said, I knew not but I should have been
apt tQ have taken the little circumstances for evidence,
if the tables were turned, and my case was theirs;
and have made no scruple of cutting all the crew
to pieces, without believing, or perhaps consider-
ing, what they might have to offer in their de-
fence.
But let that be how it will, those were our appre-
hensions; and both my partner and I too, scarce slept
a night
279
a night without dreaming of halters and yard-arms;
that is to say, gibbets; of fighting, and being taken;
of killing, and being killed; and one night I was in
such a fury in my dream, sancying the Dutchmen had
boarded us, and I was knocking one of their seamen
down, that I struck my double fist against the side of
the cabin I lay in, with such a force as wounded my
hand most grievously, broke my knuckles, and cut
and bruised the flesh, so that it not only waked me out
of my sleep, but I was once afraid I should have lost
two of my fingers.
Another apprehension I had, was, of the cruel
usage we should meet with from them, if we fell into
their hands: then the story of Amboyna came into my
head^ and how the Dutch might, perhaps, torture us,
as they did our countrymen there; and make some
of our men, by extremity of torture, confess those
crimes they never were guilty of; own themselves,
and all of us, to be pirates; and so they would put us
to death, with a formal appearance of justice.; and ~"
that they might be tempted to do this, for the gain of
our ship and cargo, which was worth four or five
thousand pounds, put all together.
These things tormented me, and my partner too,
night and day; nor did we consider that the captains
of ships have no authority to act thus; and if we had
surrendered prisoners to them, they could not answer
the destroying us, or torturing us, but would be ac-
countable for it when they came into their own coun-
try. This, I say, gave me no satissaction; for, if
they will act thus with us, what advantage would it
be to us that they would be called to an account for
it; or, if we were first to be murdered, what satis-
T 4 saction
saction would it be to us to have them punished when
they came home?
I cannot refrain taking notice here what reflections
I now had upon the past variety of my particular cir-
cumstances; how hard I thought it was, that I, who
had spent forty years in a life of continued disficulties,
and was, at last, come, as it were, at the port or
haven which all men drive at, viz. to have rest and
plenty, should be a volunteer in new sorrows, by my
own unhappy choice; and that I, who had escaped so
many dangers in my youth, should now come to be
hanged in my old age, and in so remote a place, for
a crime I was not in the least inclined to, much less
guilty of; and in a place and circumstance, where
innocence was not like to be any protection at all to
me.
After these thoughts, something of religion would
come in; and I would be considering that this seemed
to me to be a disposition of immediate Providence; and
I ought to look upon it, and submit to it, as such:
that although I was innocent as to men, I was sar from
being innocent as to my Maker; and I ought to look
in, and examine what other crimes in my life were
most obvious to me, and for which Providence might
justly inflict this punishment as a retribution; and
that I ought to submit to this, just as I would to a ship-
wreck, if it had pleased God to have brought such a,
disaster upon me.
In its turn, natural courage would sometimes take
its place; and then I would be talking myself up to
vigorous resolution, that I would not be taken to be
barbarously used by a parcel of merciless wretches in
cold blood; that it was much better to have sallen
2 into
{nto the hands of the savages, who were men-eaters,
and who, I was sure, would feast upon me, when they
had taken me, than by those, who would, perhaps,
glut their rage upon me by inhuman tortures and
barbarities: that, in the case of the savages, I always
resolved to die fighting, to the last gasp; and whT
should I not do so now, seeing it was much mor:
dreadful, to me at least, to think of salling into thct
men's hands, than ever it was to think of being eatei
by men: for the savages, give them their due, woull
not eat a man till he was dead; and killed him first
as we do a bullock; but that these men had mam
arts beyond the cruelty of death. Whenever thei
thoughts prevailed, I was sure to put myself into i
kind of fever, with the agitations of a supposed fight;
my blood would boil, and my eyes sparkle, as if [
was engaged; and I always resolved that I would tale
no quarter at their hands; but even at last, if [
could resist no longer, I would blow up the ship, anl
all that was in her, and leave them but little booty t)
boast of.
Butbyhow much the greater weightthe anxieties anl
perplexities of those things were to our thoughts whie
we were at sea, by so much the greater was our satis-
saction, when we saw ourselves on shore; and rry
partner told me, he dreamed, that he had a very hea^y
load upon his back, which he was to carry up an hi 1,
and found that he was not able to stand long under i:;
but the Portuguese pilot came, and took it off his
back, and the hill disappeared, the ground before h;m
shewing all smooth and plain: And truly it was so;
we were all like men who had a load taken off their
backs.
For
For my part, I had a weight taken off from my
ieart, that I was not able any longer to bear; and, as
I said above, we resolved to go no more to sea in that
ship. When we came on shore, the old pilot, who
was now our friend, got us a lodging, and a ware-
house for our goods, which, by the way, was much
:he same: it was a little house or hut, with a large
louse joining to it, all built with canes, and palisadoed
.ound with large canes, to keep out pilfering thieves,
Df which it seems there were not a few in the country.
However, the magistrates allowed us all a little guard,
md we had a soldier with a kind of halbert, or half
jike, who stood sentinel at our door; to whom we
illovved a pint of rice, and a little piece of money,
ibout the value of three-pence per day: so that our
joods were kept very safe.
The sair or mart, usually kept in this place, had
.>een over some time; however, we found that there
.vere three or four junks in the river, and two Japan^
ten, I mean, ships from Japan, with goods which
hey had bought in China, and were not gone away,
laving Japanese merchants on shore.
The first thing our old Portuguese pilot did for us>
vas, to bring us acquainted with three missionary
Romifi priests, who were in the town, and who had
teen there some time, converting the people to
Christianity; but we thought they made but poor
work of it; and made them but sorry Christians
vfien thev had done. However, that was not our
business. One of these was a Frenchman, whom they
called father Simon; he was a jolly well-conditioned
man, very free in his conversation, not seeming so
seikius and grave as the other two did, one of whom
was
283
was a Portuguese, and the other a Genoese; but sather
Simon was courteous, easy in his manner, and very
agreeable company; the other two were more re-
served, seemed rigid and austere, and applied seriously
to the work they came about, viz. to talk with, and
insinuate themselves among the inhabitants, where-
ever they had opportunity: we often eat and drank
with those men: and though I must confess, the con-
version, as they call it, of the Chinese to Christianity,
is so sar from the true conversion required to bring
heathen people to the saith of Christ, that it seems
to amount to little more than letting them know the
name of Christ, say some prayers tothe Virgin Mary,
and her Son, in a tongue which they understand
not, and to cross themselves, and the like; yet it must
be confessed, that these religious, whom we call Mis-
sionaries, have a firm belief that these people mould
be saved, and that they are the instrument of it; and,
on this account, they undergo not only the satigue of
the voyage, and hazards of living in such places, but
oftentimes death itself, with the most violent tortures,
for the sake of this work : and it would be a great
want of charity in us, whatever opinion we have of
the work itself, and the manner of their doing it, if
we mould not have a good opinion of their zeal, who
undertake it with so many hazards, and who have
no prospect of the least temporal advantage to them-
selves.
But, to return to my story: This French priest,
sather Simon, was appointed, it seems, by order of
the chief of the mission, to go up to Pekin, the royal
seat of the Chinese emperor; and waited only for ano-
ther priest, who was ordered to come to him from
Macao^
Macao, to go along with him; and Ave scarce ever
met together, but he was inviting me to go that jour-
ney with him, telling me, how he would shew me all
the glorious things of that mighty empire; and among
the rest, the greatest city in the world; a city, said he,
that your London, and our Paris, put together, can-
not be equal to. This was the city of Pekin, which,
I confess, is very great, and infinitely full of people;
but, as I looked on those things with different eyes
from other men, so I shall give my opinion of them in
few words, when I come, in the course of my travels,
to speak more particularly of them.
But first, I come to my friar or mislionary: Dining
with him one day, and being very merry together,
I shewed some little inclination to go with him; and
he pressed me and my partner very hard, and with a
great many persuasions to consent. Why, sather
Simon, says my partner, why should you desire our
company so much? You know we are heretics, and
.you do not love us, nor can keep us company with
any pleasure. O! says he, you may, perhaps, be
good catholics in time; my business here is to con-
vert heathens; and who knows but I may convert you
*oo? Very well, sather, said I, so you will preach to
us all the way. I won't be troublesome to you, said
he'; our religion does not divest us of good manners;
besides, said he, we are all here like countrymen;
and so we are, compared to the place we are in; and
if you are hugonots, and I a catholic, we may be all
Christians at last; at least, said he, we are all gentle-
men, and we may converse so, without being uneasy
to one another. I liked that part of his discourse
very well, and it began to put me in mind of my
priest
priest that I had left in the Brasils; but this sather
Simon did not come up to his character by a great
deal; for though sather Simort had no appearance of
a criminal levity in him neither, yet he had not that
fund of Christian zeal, strict piety, and sincere af-
fection to religion, that my other good ecclesiastic
had, of whom I have said so much.
But to leave him a little, though he never left us,
nor soliciting us to go with him, but we had some-
thing else before us at that time; for we had, all this
.while, our ship and our merchandize to dispose of j
and we began to be very doubtful what we mould do,
for we were now in a place of very little business;
and once I was about to venture to sail for the river
of Kilam, and the city of Nanquin: But Providence
seemed now more visibly, as I thought, than ever, to
concern itself in our affairs; and I was encouraged
from this very time to think I should, one way or
other, get out of this entangled circumstance, and be
brought home to my own country again; though I
had not the least view of the manner; and when I
began sometimes to think of it, could not imagine by
what method it was to be done. Providence, I fay,
began here to clear up our way a little; and the first
thing that offered was, that our old Portuguese pilot
brought a Japan merchant to us, who began to en-
quire what goods we had; and, in the first place, he
bought all our opium, and gave us a very good price
for it, paying us in gold by weight, some in small
pieces of their own coin, and some in small wedges,
of about ten or eleven ounces each. While we were
dealing with him for our opium, it came into my head
that he might, perhaps, deal with us for the ship
too;
too; and I ordered the interpreter to propose it to
him. He shrunk up his shoulders at it, when it was
first proposed to him; but, in a few days after, he
came to me, with one of the missionary priests for his
interpreter, and told me, he had a proposal to make
to me, and that was this: He had bought a great
quantity of goods of us when he had no thoughts (or
proposals made to him) of buying the ship; and that,
therefore, he had not money enough to pay for the
ship; but if I Would let the same men who were in the
ship navigate her, he would hire the ship to go to
Japan, and would fend them from thence to the
Philippine islands with another loading, which he
would pay the freight of, before they went from
Japan; and that, at their return, he would buy the
ship. I began to listen to this proposal; and so eager
did my head still run upon rambling, that I could not
but begin to entertain a notion myself of going with
him, and so to sail from the Philippine islands away
to the South Seas; and accordingly I asked the
Japanese merchant, if he would not hire us to the
Philippine islands, and discharge us there. He said,
no, he could not do that; for then he could not have
the return of his cargo; but he would discharge us in
Japan, he said, at the ship's return. Well, still I
was for taking him at that proposal, and going my.
self; but my partner, wiser than myself, persuaded
me from it, representing the dangers., as well of the
leas, as of the Japanese, w ho are a salse, cruel, and
treacherous people; and then of the Spaniards at the
Philippines; more salse, more cruel, more treacherous
than they.
287
But, to biing this long turn of our asfairs to a con-
clusion: the first thing we had to do, was to consult
with the captain of the ship, and with the men, and
know if they were willing to go to "Japan; and, while
I was doing this, the young man, whom, as I said,
my nephew had left with me as my companion for my
travels, came to me and told me, that he thought that
voyage promised very fair, and that there was a great
prospect of advantage, and he would be very glad if I
undertook it; but that if I would not, and would give
him leave, he would go as a merchant, or how I
pleased to order him; that if ever he came to England,
and I was there, and alive, he would render me a
faithful account of his success, and it should be as
much mine as I pleased.
I was really loth to part with him; but, considering
the prospect of advantage, which was really consider-
able, and that he was a young fellow as likely to do
well in it as any I knew, I inclined to let him go;
but first I told him I would consuls my partner, and
give him an answer the next day. My partner and I
discoursed about it; and my partner made a most
generous ofFer: he told me, you know it has been an
unlucky ship, and we both resolve not to go to sea in
it again; if your steward (so he called my man) will
venture the voyage, I'll leave my share of the vessel
to him, and let him make the best of it; and if we
live to meet in England, and he meets with success
abroad, he shall account for one half of the pro-
fits of the ship's freight to us, the other shall be
his own. 1
If my partner, who was no way concerned vvith my
young man, made him such an offer, I could do no
3 less
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
less than offer him the same; and all the ship's com-
pany being willing to go with him, we made over half
the ship to him in property, and took a writing from
him, obliging him to account for the other; and away
he went to Japan* The Japan merchant proved a
very punctual honest man to him, protected him a*
Japan, and got him a licence to come on shore, which
the Europeans in general have not lately obtained;
paid him his freight very punctually, sent him to the
Philippines, loaded him with Japan and China wares,
and a supercargo of their own, who trafficking with
the Spaniards, brought back European goods again,
and a great quantity of cloves, and other spice; and
there he was not only paid his freight very well, and
at a very good price, but being not willing to fell the
ship then, the merchant furnished him with goods on
his own account; that, for some money, and some
spices of his own, which he brought with him, he
went back to the Manillas, to the Spaniards, where
he sold his cargo very well. Here, having gotten a
good acquaintance at Manilla, he got his ship made a
free ship; and the governor of Manilla hired him to
go to Acapulco in America, on the coast of Mexico;
and gave him a licence to land there, and travel to
Mexico; and to pass in any Spanish ship to Europe ^
with all his men.
He made the voyage to Acapulco very happily, and
there he sold his ship; and having there also obtained
allowance to travel by land to Porto Bella, he found
means, some how or other, to goto Jamaica with all
his treasure; and about eight years after came to Eng-
land, exceeding rich; of which I shall take notice irt
its
its place; in the mean time, I return to our particular
affairs. .,
Being now to part with the ship, and ship's com-
pany, it came before us, of course, to consider what
recompence we should give to the two men, that
gave us such timely notice of the design against us in
the river of Cambodia. The truth was, they had done
us a considerable service, and deserved well at our
hands; though, by the way, they were a couple of
rogues too: for, as they believed the story of our
being pirates, and that we had really run away with
the ship, they came down to us, not only to betray the
design that was formed against us, but to go to sea
with us as pirates; and one of them confessed after-
wards, that nothing else but the hopes of going a
roguing brought him to do it. However, the ser-
vice they did us was not the less; and therefore, as J
had promised to be grateful to them, I first ordered
the money to be paid to them, which they said was
due to them on board their respective ships; that is
to fay, the Engliflman nineteen months pay, and to
the Dutchman seven; and, over and above that, I
gave each of them a small sum of money in gold,
which contented them very well: then I made the
Englishman gunner of the ship, the gunner being now
made second mate and purser; the Dutchman I made
boatswain: so they were both very well pleased, and
proved very serviceable, being both able seamen, and
very stout fellows.
We were now on shore in China. If I thought
myself banished, and remote from my own country
at Bengal, where I had many ways to get home for
my money, what could I think of myself now, when
Vol. II. U I was
I was gotten about a thousand leagues sarther off
from home, and perfectly destitute of all manner of
prospect of return!
All we had for it was this; that in about four
months time there was to be another sair at that
place where we were, and then we might be able
to purchase all sorts of the manusactures of the coun-
try, and withal might possibly find some Chinese
junks or vessels from Nanquin, that would be to be
fold, and would carry us and our goods whither we
pleased. This I liked very well, and resolved to
wait; besides, as our particular persons were not
obnoxious, so if any English or Dutch ships came
thither, perhaps we might have an opportunity to
load our goods, and get passage to some other place
in India nearer home.
Upon these hopes we resolved to continue here;
but, to divert ourselves, we took two or three jour-
nies into the country; first, we went ten days jour-
ney to see the city of Nanquin, a city well worth
, seeing indeed: they say it has a million of people in
it;. which, however, I do not believe: It is regularly
built, the streets all exactly strait, and cross one
another in direct lines, which gives the figure of it
great advantage. ,
But when I came to compare the miserable people
of these countries with our's; their fabrics, their
manner of living, their government, their religion,
their wealth, and their glory (as some call it), I must
confess, I do not so much as think it worth naming,
or worth my while to write of, or any that shall come
after me to read.
It
It is very observable, that we wonder at the gran-
deur, the riches, the pomp, the ceremonies, the go-
vernment, the manusactures, the commerce, and the
conduct of these people; not that they are to be won-
dered at, or, indeed, in the least to be regarded;
but because, having first a notion of the barbarity of
those countries, the rudeness, and the ignorance that
prevail there, we do not expect to find any such
things so sar off.
Otherwise, what are their builings to the palaces
and royal buildings of Europe? What their trade to
the universal commerce of England, Holland, France,
and Spain? What their cities to our's, for wealth,
strength, gaiety of apparel, rich furniture, and an
infinite variety? What are their ports, supplied with a
few junks and barks, to our navigation, our mer-
chants fleets, our large and powerful navies? Our
city of London has more trade than all their mighty
empire. One Englis}j, or Dutch, or French man of
war of 80 guns, would fight with and destroy all
the shipping of China. But the greatness of their
wealth, their trade, the power of their government,
and strength of their armies are surprizing to us,
because, as I have said, considering them as a bar-
barous nation of pagans, little better than savages,
we did not expect such things among them; and
this, indeed, is the advantage with which all their
greatness and power is represented to us: otherwise,
it is in itself nothing at all; for, as I have said of
their ships, so it may be said of their armies and
troops; all the forces of their empire, though they
were to bring two millions of men into the field to-
ll 2 gether,
gether, would be able to do nothing but ruin the
country, and starve themselves. If they were to
besiege a strong town in Flanders, or to fight a dis-
ciplined army, one line of German cuirassiers, or of
French cavalry, would overthrow all the horse of
China; a million of their foot could not stand be-
fore one embattled body of our insantry, posted so
as not to be surrounded, though they were not to be
one to twenty in number: nay, I do not boast if I say,
that 30,000 German or English foot, and 10,000
French horse, would fairly beat all the forces of
China. And so of our fortified towns, and of the
art of our engineers, in assiiulting and defending
towns; there is not a fortified town in China could
hold out one month against the batteries and attacks
of an European army; and at the same time, all the
armies of China could never take such a town as
Dunkirk, provided it was not starved; no, not in ten
years siege. They have fire-arms, it is true, but
they are awkward, clumsy, and uncertain in going
off; they have powder, but it is of no strength;
they have neither discipline in the field, exercise in
their arms, skill to attack, or temper to retreat:
and therefore I must confess it seemed strange to me
when I came home, and heard our people say such
sine things of the power, riches, glory, magnifi-
cence, and trade of the Chinese, because I saw and
knew that they were a contemptible herd or croud of
ignorant, sordid flaves, subjected to a government
qualified only to rule such a people; and, in a word,
for I am now launched quite beside my design, I say,
in a word, were not its distance inconceivably great
from Muscovy, and were not the Muscovite empire
almost
293
almost as rude, impotent, and ill-governed a croud
of Haves as they, the czar of Muscovy might, with
much ease, drive them all out of their country, and
conquer them in one campaign; and had the czar,
who I since hear is a growing prince, and begins to
appear formidable in the world, sallen this way, in-
stead of attacking the warlike Swedes, in which at-
tempt none of the powers of Europe would have
envied or interrupted him; he might, by this time,
have been emperor of China, instead of being beaten
by the king of Sweden at Narva, when the latter
was not one to six in number. As their strength and
their grandeur, so their navigation, commerce, and
husbandry, is imperfect and impotent, compared to
the same things in Europe. Also, in their knowledge,
their learning, their skill in the sciences; they have
globes and spheres, and a fmatch of the knowledge
of the mathematics; but when you come to enquire
into their kno * ledge, how short-sighted are the wisest
of their students! They know nothing of the mo-
tion of the heavenly bodies; and so grossly, absurd-
ly ignorant, that when the sun is eclipsed, they
think it is a great dragon has assaulted and run away
with it; and they fall a clattering with all the drums
and kettles in the country, to fright the monster
away, just as we do to hive a swarm of bees.
As this is the only excursion of this kind which I
have made in all the account I have given of my
travels, so I shall make no more descriptions of
countries and people: it is none of my business, or
any part of my design; but giving an account of my
own adventures, through a life of infinite wander-
ings, and a long variety of changes, which, perhaps,
U 3 few
few have heard the like of, I shall say nothing of the
mighty places, desart countries, and numerous peo-
ple, I have yet to pass through, more than relates
to my own story, and which my concern among
them will make necessary. I was now, as near as I
can compute., in the heart of China, about the lati-
tude of thirty degrees north of the line, for we
were returned from Nanquin; I had indeed a mind
to fee the city of Pekin, which I had heard so much
of, and sather Simon importuned me daily to do it:
at length his time of going away being set, and the
other missionary, who was to go with him, being ar-
rived from Macao, it was necessary that we fnould re-
solve either to go, or not to go; so I referred him to
my partner, and left it wholly to his choice; who,
at length, resolved it in the affirmative; and we pre-
pared for our journey. We set out with veiy good
advantage, as to finding the way; for we got leave
to travel in the retinue of one of their mandarins,
a kind of viceroy, or principal magistrate, in the
province where they reside, and who take great state
upon them, travelling with great attendance, and
with great homage from the people, who are some-
times greatly impoverished by them, because all the
countries they pass through are obliged to furnish
provisions for them, and all their attendants. That
which I particularly observed, as to our travelling
with his baggage, was this; that though we received
sufficient provisions, both for ourselves and our horses,
from the country, as belonging to the mandarin, yet we
were obliged to pay for every thing we had after the
market-price of the country, and the mandarin's
steward, or commissary of the provisions, collected
it
295
it duly from us; so that our travelling in the retinue
of the mandarin, though it was a very great kind-
ness to us, was not such a mighty savour in him, but
was, indeed, a great advantage to him, considering
there were about thirty other people travelling in the
same manner besides us, under the protection of bis
retinue, or, as we may call it, under his convoy.
This, I say, was a great advantage to him; foi the
country furnished all the provisions for nothing, and
he took all our money for them.
We were five-and-twenty days travelling to Pekin,
through a country infinitely populous, but miserably
cultivated; the husbandry, ceconomy, and the way
Gf living, all very miserable, though they boast so
much of the industry of the people: I say misera-
ble; and so it is; if we, who understand how to
live, were to endure it, or to compare it with our
own; but not so to these poor wretches, who know
no other. The pride of these people is infinitely
great, and exceeded by nothing but their poverty,
which adds to that which I call their misery. I must
needs think the naked savages of America live much
more happy, because, as they have nothing, so they
defire nothing $ whereas these are proud and inso-
lent, and, in the main, are mere beggars and drudges;
their ostentation is inexpressible, and is chiefly shewed
in their clothes and buildings, and in the keeping
multitudes of servants or slaves, and, which is to
the last degree ridiculous, their contempt of all the
world but themselves.
I must confess, I travelled more pleasantly after-
wards, in the desarts and vast wildernesses of Grand
Tartary, than here; and yet the roads here are well
U 4 paved,
paved, and well kept, and very convenient for tra-
vellers: but nothing was more awkward to me, than
to fee such an haughty, imperious, insolent people,
in the midst of the grossest simplicity and ignorance;
for all their samed ingenuity is no more. My friend,
father Simon, and I, used to be very merry upon these
occasions, to fee the beggarly pride of those people:
for example, coming by the house of a country gen-
tleman, as sather Simon called him, about ten leagues
off from the city of Nanquin, we had, first of all,
the honour to ride with the master of the house about
two miles; the state he rode in was a perfect Don
Quixotism, being a mixture of pomp and poverty.
The habit of this greasy Don was very proper for
a scaramouch, or merry-andrew; being a dirty ca-
lico, with all the tawdry trappings of a fool's coat,
such as hanging sleeves, taffety, and cuts and flashes
almost on every side.: it covered a rich taffety vest,
as greasy as a butcher, and which testified, that his
honour must needs be a most exquisite sloven.
His horse was a poor, lean, starved, hobbling crea-
ture, such .as in England might fell for about
thirty or forty shillings; and he had two slaves
followed him on foot, to drive the poor creature
along: he had a whip in his hand, and he bela-
boured the beast as sast about the head as his slaves
did about the tail; and thus he rode by us with
about ten or twelve servants; and we were told he
was going from thz city to his country feat, about
half a league before us. We travelled on gently,
but this figure of a gentleman rode away before us;
and as we stopped at a village about an hour to re-
fresh us, when we came by the country feat of this
great
297
great man, we saw him in a little place before his
door, eating his repast; it was a kind of a garden*
but he was easy to be seen; and we were given to
understand, that the more we looked on him, the
better he would be pleased.
He sat under a tree, something like the palmetto-
tree, which effectually shaded him over the head,
and on the south side; but under the tree also was
placed a large umbrella, which made that part look
well enough: he sat lolling back in a great elbow-
chair, being a heavy corpulent man, and his meat
being brought him by two women slaves, he had two
more, whose office, I think, few gentlemen in Eu-
rope would accept of their service in, viz. one fed
the 'squire with a spoon, and the other held the dish
with one hand, and scraped off what he let sall upon
his worship's beard and taffety vest, with the other;
while the great sat brute thought it below him to em-
ploy his own hands in any of those samiliar offices,
which kings and monarchs would rather do than be
troubled with the clumsy fingers of their servants.
I took this time to think what pain men's pride
puts them to, and how troublesome a haughty tem-
per, thus ill-managed, must be to a man of common
fense; and, leaving the poor wretch to please him-
self with our looking at him, as if we admired his
pomp, whereas we really pitied and contemned him,
we pursued our journey; only sather Simon had the
curiosity to stay to inform himself what dainties the
country justice had to feed on, in all his state; which
he said he had the honour to taste of, and which was,
I think, a dose that an English hound would scarce
have eaten, if it had been offered him, viz. a mess
of
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
of boiled rice, with a great piece of garlick in it,
and a little bag filled with green pepper, and ano-
ther plant which they have there, something like
our ginger, but smelling like musk, and tasting like
mustard; all this was put together, and a small lump
or piece of lean mutton boiled in it; and this was
his worship's repast, four or five servants more at-
tending at a distance. If he fed them meaner than
he was fed himself, the spice excepted, they must sare
very coarsely indeed.
As for our mandarin with whom we travelled, he
was respected like a king; surrounded always with
his gentlemen, and attended in all his appearances
with such pomp, that I saw little of him but at a dis-
tance; but this I observed, that there was not a
horse in his retinue, but that our carriers pack-horses
in England seem to me to look much better; but they
were so covered with equipage, mantles, trappings,
and such like trumpery, that you cannot see whether
they are sat or lean. In a word, we could scarce sec
any thing but their feet and their heads.
I was now light-hearted, and all my trouble and
perplexity that I had given an account of being over,
I had no anxious thoughts about me; which made
this journey much the pleasanter to me; nor had I
any ill accident attended me, only in the passing or
fording a small river, my horse fell, and made me
free of the country, as they call it; that is to say,
threw me in; the place was not deep, but it wetted
me all over: I mention it, because it spoiled my
pocket-book, wherein I had set down the names of
several people and places which I had occasion to re*
2 member,
member, and which not taking due care of, the
leaves rotted, and the words were never after to be
read, to my great loss, as to the names of some
places which I touched at in this voyage.
At length we arrived at Pekin: I had nobody
with me but the youth, whom my nephew the cap-
tain had given me to attend me as a servant, and
who proved very trusty and diligent; and my part-
ner had nobody with him but one servant, who was
a kinsman. As for the Portuguese pilot, he being;
defirous to fee the court, we gave him his passage,
that is to say, bore his charges for his company; and
to use him as an interpreter, for he understood the
language of the country, and spoke good French
and a little English; and, indeed, this old man was a
most useful implement to us every where; for we had
not been above a week at Pckin, when he came laugh-
ing: Ah, Seignior Inglese, said he, I have something
to tell you, will make your heart glad. My heart
glad! said I: What can that be? I don't know any
thing in this country can either give me joy or grief,
to any great degree. Yes, yes, said the old man, in
broken English, make you glad, me sorrow ; sorry he
would have said. This made me more inquisitive.
Why, said I, will it make you sorry? Because, said
he, you have brought me here twenty-five days
Journey, and will leave me to go back alone; and
which way shall I get to my port afterwards, without
a ship, without a horse, without pecune? So he called
money; being his broken Latin, of which he had
abundance to make us merry with.
In short, he told us there was a great caravan of
Muscovy and PolisI) merchants in the city, and that they
were
were preparing to set out on their journey, by land,
to Muscovy, within four or five weeks, and he was
sure we would take the opportunity to go with them,
and leave him behind to go back alone. I confess I
was surprised with this news: a secret joy spread it-
self over my whole soul, which I cannot describe,
and never felt before, or since; and I had no power,
for a good while, to speak a word to the old man;
but at last I turned to him: How do you know this?
said I: are you sure it is true? Yes, he said, I met
this morning, in the street, an old acquaintance of
mine, an Armenian, or one you call a Grecian, who
is among them; he came last from Astracan, and
was designing to go to Tonquin, where I formerly
knew him, but has altered his mind, and is now re-
solved to go back with the caravan to Moscow, and
so down the river of Wolga to Aslracan. Well, Seig-
nior, said I, do not be uneasy about being left to go
back alone; if this be a method for my return to
England, it shall be your fault if you go back to
Macao at all. We then went to consult together
what was to be done, and asked my partner what he
thought of the pilot's news, and whether it would
suit with his affairs: he told me he would do just as
I would; for he had settled all his affairs so well at
Bengal, and left his effects in such good hands, that
as we made a good voyage here, if he could vest it
in China silks, wrought and raw, such as might be
worth the carriage, he would be content to go to
England, and then make his voyage back to Bengals
by the company's ships.
Having resolved upon this, we agreed, that if our
Portuguese pilot would go with us, we would bear his
3 charges
charges to Moscow, or to England, if he pleased;
nor, indeed, were we to be esteemed over generous
in that part neither, if we had not rewarded him
sarther; for the service he had done us was really worth
nll that, and more; for he had not only been a pilot
to us at sea, but he had been also like a broker for us
on shore; and his procuring for us the Japan mer-
chant, was some hundreds of pounds in our pockets.
So we consulted together about it; and, being
willing to gratify him, which was, indeed, but doing
him justice, and very willing also to have him with us
besides, for he was a most necessary man on all oc-
casions, we agreed to give him a quantity of coined
gold, which, as I compute it, came to about 175
pounds sterling between us, and to bear his chargeSj
both for himself and horse, except only a horse to
carry his goods.
Having settled this among ourselves, we called
him to let him know what we had resolved: I told
him, he had complained of our being like to let him
go back alone, and I was now to tell him we were
resolved he should not go back at all: that as we had
resolved to go to Europe with the caravan, we re-
solved also he should go with us, and that we called
him to know his mind. He shook his head, and
said it was a long journey, and he had no pecune to
carry him thither, nor to subsist himself when he
came thither. ' We told him, we believed it was so,
and therefore we had resolved to do something for
him, that should let him see how sensible we were of
the service he had done us; and also how agreeable
he was to us: and then I told him what we had
resolved to give him here, which he might lay out as
we
LIFJt AND ADVENTURES
we would do our own; and that as for his charges* if*
he would go with us, we would set him safe ashore,
(life and casualties excepted) either in Muscovy or in
England, which he would, at our own charge, except
only the carriage of his goods.
He received the proposal like a man transported,
and told us, he would go with us over the whole
world; and so, in short, we all prepared ourselves
for the journey. However, as it was with us, so it
was with the other merchants, they had many things
to do; and instead of being ready in five weeks, it
was four months and some odd days before all things
were got together.
It was the beginning of February, our style, when
we set out from Pekin. My partner and the old pilot
had gone express back to the port where we had first
put in, to dispose of some goods which we had left
there; and I, with a Chinese merchant, whom I had
some knowledge of at Nanquin, and who came to
Pekin on his own asfairs, went to Nanquin, where I
bought ninety pieces of fine damasks, with about two
hundred pieces of other very fine silks, of several
sorts, some mixed with gold, and had all these brought
to Pekin against my partner's return: besides this, we
bought a very large quantity of raw silk, and some
other goods; our cargo amounting, in these goods
only, to about three thousand five hundred pounds
sterling, which, together with tea, and some fine
callicoes, andthreecamel-loads of nutmegs and cloves,
loaded in all eighteen camels for our share, besides
those we rode upon; which, with two or three spare
horses, and two horses loaded with provisions, made
us,
us, in short, twenty-six camels and horses in our
retinue.
The company was very great, and, as near as I can
remember, made between three and four hundred
horses and camels, and upward of an hundred and
twenty men, very well armed, and provided for all
events. For, as the eastern caravans are subject to
be attacked by the Arabs, so are these by the Tar.
tars; but they are not altogether so dangerous as the
Arabs, nor so barbarous when they prevail.
The company consisted of people of several nations,
such as Muscovites chiefly; for there were about sixty
of them who were merchants or inhabitants of Muf-
cow, though of them some were Livonians; and to
our particular satissaction, five of them were Scots,
who appeared also to be men of great experience in
business, and very good substance.
When we had travelled one day's journey, the
guides, who were five in number, called all the gen-
tlemen and merchants; that is to fay, all the passen-
gers, except the servants, to a great council, as they
termed it. At this great council every one deposited
a certain quantity of money to a common stock, for
the necessary expence of buying forage on the way,
where it was not otherwise to be had, and for satis-
fying the guides, getting horses, and the like. And
here they constituted the journey, as they called it,
viz. They named captains and osficers to draw us all
up, and give the command in case of an attack, and
gave every one their turn of command. Nor was
this forming us into order any more than what we
found needful upon the way, as shall be observed in
its place.
The
The road all on this fide of the country is very po-
pulous, and is full of potters and earth-makers; that
is to say, people that tempered the earth for the China
ware; and, as I was going along, our Portuguese
pilot, who had always something or other to say to
make us merry, came sneering to me, and told me,
he would shew the greatest rarity in all the country;
and that I should have this to say of China, after all
the ill-humoured things I had said of it, that I had
seen one thing which was not to be seen in all the
world beside. I was very importunate to know what
it was; at last he told me, it was a gentleman's house,
built all with China ware. Well, said I, are not the
materials of their building the product of their own
country; and so it is all China ware, is it not? No,
no, says he, I mean, it is a house all made of China
ware, such as you call so in England; or, as it is
called in our country, porcelain. Well, said I, such
a thing may be: How big is it; Can we carry it in
a box upon a camel? If we can, we will buy it.
Upon a camel! said the old pilot, holding up both
his hands, why there is a samily of thirty people
lives in it.
I was then curious, indeed, to see it; and when I
came to it, it was nothing but this: it was a timber
house, or a house built, as we call it in England, with
lath and plaister, but all the plaistering was really
China ware, that is to say, it was plaistered with the
earth that makes China ware.
The outside, which the fun shone hot upon, was.
glazed, and looked very well, perfectly white, and
painted with blue figures, as the large China ware
in England is painted, and hard, as if it had been
burnt.
burnt. As to the inside, all the walls, instead of
wainscot, were lined with hardened and painted tiles,
like the little square tiles we call gally tiles in England,
all made of the finest China, and the figures exceed-
ing sine indeed, with extraordinary variety of co-
lours, mixed with gold, many tiles making but one
figure, but joined so artificially with mortar, being
made of the same earth, that it was very hard to fee
where the tiles met. The floors of the rooms were
of the same composition, and as hard as the earthen
floors we have in use in several parts of England,
especially Lincolnshire, Nottinghamshire, Leicestershire,
Sec. as hard as stone, and smooth, but not burnt
and painted, except some smaller rooms, like closets,
which were all, as it were, paved with the same tile;
the cielings, and in a word, all the plaistering-work
in the whole house, were of the same earth; and,
after all, the roof was covered with tiles of the
same, but of a deep shining black.
This was a China warehouse indeed, truly and li-
terally to be called so; and, had I not been upon the
journey, I could have staid some days to fee and ex-
amine the particulars of it. They told me there
were fountains and fish-ponds in the garden, all
paved at the bottom and sides with the fame, and
fine statues set up in rows on the walks, entirely
formed of the porcelain earth, and burnt whole.
As this is one of the singularities of China, so
they may be allowed to excel in it; but I am very
sure, they excel in their accounts of it; for they
told me such incredible things of their perform-
ance in crockery-ware, for such it is, that I care
not to relate, as knowing it could not be true:—
One told me, in particular, of a workman that made
Vol. II. X a ship,
a ship, with all its tackle, and masts, and sails, in
earthen-ware, big enough to carry fifty men. If he
had told me he launched it, and made a voyage to
Japan in it, I might have said something to it indeed;
but as it was, I knew the whole story, which was,
in short, asking pardon for the word, that the fellow
lied; so I smiled, and said nothing to it.
This odd sight kept me two hours behind the ca-
ravan, for which the leader of it for the day fined
me about the value of three millings; and told me,
if it had been three days journey without the wall,
as it was three days within, he must have fined me
four times as much, and made me ask pardon th«
next council day: so I promised to be more orderly;
'for, indeed, I found afterwards the orders made for
306 LIFE AND ADVENTURES
common safety.
In two days more we passed the great China wall,
made for a fortification against the Tartars; and a
very great work it is, going over hills and moun-
tains in an endless track, where the rocks are impassa-
ble, and the precipices such as no enemy could pos-
sibly enter, or, indeed, climb up, or where, if they
did, no wall could hinder them. They tell us, its
length is near a thousand English miles, but that the
country is five hundred, in a straight measured line,
which the wall bounds, without measuring the
windings and turnings it takes: 'tis about four sa-
thom high, and as many thick in some places.
I stood still an hour, or thereabouts, without
trespassing on our orders, for so long the caravan
was in passing the gate; I say, I stood still an hour
to look at it, on every side, near, and sar off, I
mean,
mean, what was within my view; and the guide of
our caravan, who had been extolling it for the win-
der of the world, was mighty eager to hear my opi-
nion of it. I told him it was a most excellent thing
to keep off the Tartars, which he happened not to
understand as I meant it, and so took it for a com-
pliment: but the old pilot laughed i O Seignior Inglese,
said he, you speak in colours. In colours! said I,
what do you mean by that? Why you speak what
looks white this way, and black that way; gay one
way, and dull another way: you tell him it is a
good wall to keep out Tartars; you tell me, by that,
it is good for nothing but to keep out Tartars; or,
will keep out none but Tartars: I understand you,
Seignior Inglese, I understand you, said he, joking;
but Seignior Chinese understand you his own way.
Well said I, Seignior, do you think it would stand
out an army of our country people, with a good
train of artillery; or our engineers, with two com-
panies of miners? Would they not batter it down
in ten days, that an army might enter in battalia, or
blow it up into the air, foundation and all, that there
should be no sign of it left? Ay, ay, said he, I know
that. The Chinese wanted mightily to know what I
said, and I gave him leave to tell him a few days after,
for we were then almost out of their country, and
he was to leave us in a little time afterwards; but
when he knew what I had said, he was dumb all
the rest of the way, and we heard no more of his
fine story of the Chinese power and greatness while
he staid.
. After we had passed this mighty Nothing, called
a wall, something like the Picls wall, so samous in
Northumberland, and built by the Romans, we began
X 2 to
to find the country thinly inhabited, and the people
rather confined to live in fortified towns and cities,
as being subject to the inroads and depredations of
the Tartars, who rob in great armies, and there-
fore are not to be resisted by the naked inhabitants
of an open country.
And here I began to find the necessity of keeping
together in a caravan, as we travelled; for we saw
several troops of Tartars roving about; but when I
came to see them distinctly, I wondered how that the
Chinese empire could be conquered by such contempti-
ble fellows; for they are a mere herd or crowd of
wild fellows, keeping no order, and understanding
no discipline, or manner of sight.
Their horses are poor, lean, starved creatures,
. taught nothing, and are sit for nothing; and this
we found the first day we saw them, which was after
we entered the wilder part of the country. Our
leader for the day gave leave for about sixteen of us
to go a hunting, as they call it; and what was this
but hunting of sheep! However, it may be called
hunting too; for the creatures arc the wildest, and
swiftest of foot, that ever I saw of their kind; only
they will not run a great way, and you are sure of
sport when you begin the chace; for they appear ge-
nerally by thirty or forty in a flock, and, like true
sheep, always keep together when they fly.
In pursuit of this odd fort of game, it was our
hap to meet with about forty Tartars: Whether they
were hunting mutton as we wore, or whether they
looked for another kind of prey, I know not; but
as soon as they sow us, one of them blew a kind of
horn very loud, but with a barbarous found that I
had
had never heard before; and, by the way, never
care to hear again. We all supposed this was to call
their friends about them; and so it was; for in less
than half a quarter of an hour, a troop of forty or
fifty more appeared at about a mile distance; but
our work was over first, as it happened.
One of the Scots merchants of Moscow happened
to be amongst us; and as soon as he heard the horn,
he told us, in short, that we had nothing to do but
to charge them immediately, without loss of time;
and, drawing us up in a line, he asked, If we were
resolved? We told him, We were ready to follow
him: So he rode directly up to them. They stood
gazing at us, like a mere crowd, drawn up in no
order, nor shewing the sace of any order at all; but
as soon as they saw us advance, they let fly their ar-
rows; which, however, missed us very happily: It
seems they mistook not their aim, but their distance;
for their arrows all fell a little short of us, but with
so true an aim, that had we been about twenty yards
nearer, we must have had several men wounded, if
not killed.
Immediately we halted; and though it was at a
great distance, we fired, and sent them leaden bullets
for wooden arrows, following our shot full gallop,
resolving to sall in among them sword in hand; for
so our bold Scot that led us, directed. He was, in-
deed, but a merchant, but he behaved with that vi-
gour and bravery on this occasion, and yet with such
i cool courage too, that I never saw any man in action
sitter for command. As soon as we came up to them,
we fired our pistols in their saces, and then drew; but
they fled in the greatest confusion imaginable; the
X 3 only
only stand any of them made was on our right, where
three of them stood, and, by signs, called the rest
to come back to them, having a kind of scymitar in
their hands, and their bows hanging at their backs.
Our brave commander, without asking any body to
follow him, galloped up close to them, and with his
fusil knocked one of them off his horse, killed the
second with his pistol, and the third ran away; and
thus ended our fight; but we had this misfortune
attending it, viz. That all our mutton that we had
in chace got away. We had not a man killed or
hurt; but, as for the Tartars, there were about five
of them killed; how many were wounded, we knew
not; but this we knew, that the other party was so
frighted with the noise of our guns, that they fled,
and never made any attempt upon us.
We were all this while in the Chinese dominions,
and therefore the Tartars were not so bold as after-
wards; but in about five days we entered a vast
great wild desart, which held us three days and
nights march; and we were obliged to carry our
water with us in great leather bottles, and to encamp
all night, just as I have heard they do in the desarts
of Arabia.
I asked our guides, whose dominion this was in?
and they told me this was a kind of border that
might be called No Man's Land ; 'being, part of the
Great Karakathy, or Grand Tartary; but that, how-
ever, it was reckoned to China; that there was no
care taken here to preserve it from the inroads of
thieves; and therefore it was reckoned the worst desart
in the whole march, though we were to go over some
much larger.
i In
3"
In passing this wilderness, which, I confess, was
at the first view very frightful to me, we saw two
or three times little parties of the Tartars, but they
seemed to be upon their own asfairs, and to have no
design upon us; and so, like the man who met the
devil, if they had nothing to say to us, we had no-
thing to say to them; we let them go.
Once, however, a party of them came so near as
to stand and gaze at us; whether it was to consider
what they mould do, viz. to attack us, or not at-
tack us, we knew not.; but when we were passed at
some distance by them, we made a rear guard of forty
men, and stood ready for them, letting the caravan
pass half a mile, or thereabouts, before us: After a
while they marched off, only we found they assaulted
us with five arrows at their parting; one of which
wounded a horse, so that it disabled him; and we
left him the next day, poor creature, in great need
of a good sarrier. We suppose they might shoot more
arrows, which might fall short of us; but we saw no
more arrows, or Tartars, at that time.
We travelled near a month after this, the ways
being not so g6od as at first, though still in the do-
minions of the Emperor of China; but lay, for the
most part, in villages, some of which were fortified,
because of the incursions of the Tartars. When
we came to one of these towns (it was about two
days and a half's journey before we were to come to
the city of Naurii,J I wanted to buy a camel, of
which there are plenty to be sold all the way upon
that road, and of horses also, such as they are, be-
cause so many caravans coming that way, they are
X 4 . very
very often wanted. The person that I spoke to
to get me a camel, would have gone and fetched it
for me; but I, like a fool, must be officious, and
go myself along with him. The place was about
two miles out of the village, where, it seems, they
kept the camels and horses feeding under a guard.
I walked it on foot, with my old pilot in company,
and a Chinese, being desirous, forsooth, of a little va-
riety. When we came to this place, it was a low
marshy ground, walled round with a stone wall, piled
up dry, without mortar or earth among it, like a
park, with a little guard of Chinese soldiers at the
doors: Having bought a camel, and agreed for the
price, I came away; and the Chinese man, that went
with me, led the camel, when on a sudden came up
five Tartars on horseback; two of them seized the
fellow, and took the camel from him, while the
other three stepped up to me and my old pilot; seeing
us, as it were, unarmed, for I had no weapon about
me but my sword, which could but ill defend me
against three horsemen. The first that came up
stopped short upon my drawing my sword (for they
are arrant cowards;) but a second coming upon
my left, gave me a blow on the head, which I never
felt till afterwards, and wondered, when I came to
myself, what was the matter with me, and where I
was, for he laid me flat on the ground; but my ne-
ver-sailing old pilot, the Portuguese (so providence,
unlooked for, directs deliverances from dangers, which
to us are unforeseen,) had a pistol in his pocket,
which I knew nothing of, nor the Tartars neither;
if they had, I suppose they would not have attacked
us;
us ; but cowards are always boldest when there is no
danger.
The old man, seeing me down, with a bold heart
stepped up to the fellow that had struck me, and lay-
ing hold of his arm with one hand, and pulling him
down by main force a little towards him with the
other, he shot him into the head, and laid him dead
on the spot; he then immediately stepped up to him
who had stopped us, as I said, and before he could
come forward again (for it was all done as it were in
a moment) made a blow at him with a scymitar,
which he always wore, but, miffing the man, cut
his horse into the side of his head, cut one of his
ears off by the root, and a great slice down the side
of his sace. The poor beast, enraged with the
wounds, was no more to be governed by his rider,
though the fellow sat well enough too; but away he
flew, and carried him quite out of the pilot's reach;
and, at some distance, rising upon his hind legs, threw
down the Tartar, and fell upon him.
In this interval the poor Chinese came in, who had
lost the camel, but he had no weapon; however, see-
ing the Tarter down, and his horse sallen upon him,
he runs to hnn, and seizing upon an ugly ill-savoured
weapon he had by his side, something like a pole-
axe, but not a pole-axe either, he wrenched it from
him, and made shift to knock his Tartarian brains
out with it. But my old man had the third Tartar
to deal with still; and, seeing he did not fly as he
expected, nor come on to fight him, as he appre-
hended, but stood stock still, the old man stood still
too, and salls to work with his tackle to charge his
pistol again: but as soon as the Tartar saw the
4 pistol,
pistol, whether he supposed it to be the same or ano-
ther, I know not; but away he scoured, and left
my pilot, my champion I called him afterwards, a
complete victory.
By this time I was a little awake; for I thought,
when I first began to awake, that I had been in a
sweet sleep; but, as I said above, I wondered where
I was, how I came upon the ground, and what was
the matter: in a word, a few minutes after, as fense
returned, I felt pain, though I did not know where;
I clapped my hand to my head, and took it away
bloody; then I felt my head ache; and then, in
another moment, memory returned, and every thing
was present to me again.
I jumped up upon my feet instantly, and got hold
of my sword, but no enemies in view. I found a
Tartar lie dead, and his horse standing very quietly
by him; and looking sarther, I saw my champion
and deliverer, who had been to see what the Chinese
had done, coining back with his hanger in his hand.
The old man, seeing me on my feet, came running to
me, and embraced me with a great deal of joy, being
afraid before that I had been killed; and seeing me
bloody, would see how I was hurt; but it was not
much, only what we call a broken head; neither
did I afterwards find any great inconvenience from
the blow, other than the place which was hurt, and
which was well again in two or three days.
We made no great gain, however, by this victory;
for we lost a camel, and gained a horse: but that
which was remarkable, when we came back to the
village, the man demanded to be paid for the ca-
mel;
mel; I disputed it, and it was brought to a hearing
before the Chinese judge of the place; that is to say,
in English, we went before a justice of the peace.
Give him his due, he acted with a great deal of pru-
dence and impartiality; and having heard both sides,
he gravely asked the Chinese man that went with me
to buy the camel, whose servant he was? 1 am no
servant said he, but went with the stranger. At
whose request? said the justice. At the stranger's
request, said he. Why then, said the justice, you
were the stranger's servant for the time ; and the
camel being delivered to his servant, it was delivered
to him, and he must pay for it.
I confess the thing was so clear, that I had
not a word to say; but admiring to fee such just
reasoning upon the consequence, and so accurate
stating the case, I paid willingly for the camel, and
sent for another; but you may observe, /sent for it;
I did not go to fetch it myself any more; I had
enough of that.
The city of Naum is a frontier of the Chinese em-
pire: they call it fortified, and so it is, as fortifica-
tions go there; for this I will venture to asfirm, that
all the Tartars in Karakathay, which, I believe, are
some millions, could not batter down the walls with
their bows and arrows; but to call it strong, if it
were attacked with cannon, would be to make those
who understand it laugh at you.
We wanted, as I have said, above two days jour-
ney of this city, when messengers were sent express
to every part of the road, to tell all travellers and
caravans to halt, till they had a guard sent to them;
for
for that an unusual body of Tartars, making ten
thousand in all, had appeared in the way, about
thirty miles beyond the city.
This was very bad news to travellers; however,
it was carefully done of the governor, and we were
very glad to hear we mould have a guard. Accord-
ingly, two days after, we had 200 soldiers sent us
from a garrison of the Chinese on our left, and three
hundred more from the city of Naum, and with those
we advanced boldly: the three hundred soldiers from
Naum marched in our front, the two hundred in our
rear, and our men on each fide of our camels with
our baggage, and the whole caravan in the centre:
in this order, and well prepared for battle, we thought
ourselves a match for the whole ten thousand Mogul
Tartars, if they had appeared; but the next day,
when they did appear, it was quite another thing.
It was early in the morning, when marching from
a little well-situated town, called Cbangu, w e had a
river to pass, where we were obliged to ferry; and
had the Tartars had any intelligence, then had been
the time to have attacked us, when, the caravan
being over, the rear guard was behind: but they
did not appear there.
About three hours after, when we were entered upon
a desart of about fifteen or sixteen miles over, be-
hold, by a cloud of dust they raised, we saw an
enemy was at hand; and they were at hand indeed,
for they came on upon the spur.
The Chinese, our guard on the front, who had
tasked so big the day before, began to stagger, and
the soldiers frequently looked behind them; which is
a certain sign in a soldier, that he is just ready to run
away.
away. My old pilot was of my mind; and being
near me, he called out: Seignior Inglese, said he,
those fellows must be encouraged, or they will ruin
us all; for if the Tartars come on, they will never
stand it. I am of your mind, said I: But what
course must be done? Done, said he; let fifty of our
men advance, and flank them on each wing, and
encourage them, and they will sight like brave fel-
lows in brave company; but without it, they will
every man turn his back. Immediately I rode up to
our leader, and told him, who was exactly of our
mind; and accordingly fifty of us marched to the
right wing, and fifty to the left, and the rest made a
line of reserve; for so we marched, leaving the last
two hundred men to make another body to them-
selves, and to guard the camels; only that, if need
were, they should fend an hundred men to assist the
last fifty.
In a word, the Tartars came on, and an innume-
rable company they were; how many, we could not
tell, but ten thousand we thought was the least. A
party of them came on first, and viewed our posture,
traversing the ground in the front of our line; and as
we found them within gun-shot, our leader ordered
the two wings to advance swiftly, and give them a
salvo on each wing with their snot, which was done;
but they went off, and I suppose went back to give
an account of the reception they were like to meet
with; anJ, indeed, that salute clogged their sto-
machs; for they immediately halted, stood awhile
to consider of it, and, wheeling off to the left, they
gave over the design, and said no more to us for
that time; which was very agreeable to our circum-
stances,
stances, which were but very indifferent for a battle
with such a number.
Two days after this we came to the city of Naum,
or Naunm: We thanked the governor for his care for
us, and collected to the value of 100 crowns, or
thereabouts, which we gave to the soldiers sent to
guard us; and here we rested one day. This is a
garrison indeed, and there were nine hundred sol-
diers kept here; but the reason of it was, that for-
merly the Muscovite frontiers lay nearer to them than
they do now, the Muscovites having abandoned that
part of the country (which lies from the city west,
for about two hundred miles) as desolate and unfit
for use; and more especially, being so very remote*
and so difficult to send troops hither for its defence;
for we had yet above two thousand miles to Muscovy,
properly so called.
After this we passed several great rivers, and two
dreadful desarts, one of which we were sixteen days
passing over, and which, as I said, was to be called
No Man's Land; and on the 13th of April, we came
to the frontiers of the Muscovite dominions. I think
the first city, or town, or fortress, whatever it might be
called, that belonged to the Czar of Muscovy, was
called Argun, being on the west side of the river
Argun.
I could not but discover an infinite satissaction,
that I was now arrived in, as I called it, a Christian
country; or, at least, in a country governed by
Christians: for though the Muscovites do, in my opi-
nion, but just deserve the name of Christians; (yet
such they pretend to be, and are very devout in their
way);
3*9
way); it would certainly occur to any man who
travels the world as I have done, and who had any
power of reflection; I say, it would occur to him,
to reflect, what a blessing it is to be brought into the
world where the name of God, and of a Redeemer,
is known, worshipped, and adored—and not where
the people, given up by Heaven to strong delusions,
worfcip the devil, and prostrate themselves to stocks
and stones; worship monsters, elements, horrible
shaped animals, and statues, or images of monsters.
Not a town or city we passed through but had their
pagods, their idols, and their temples; and ignorant
people worshipping even the works of their own hands!
Now we came where, at least, a sace of the
Christian worship appeared, where the knee was
bowed to Jesus; and whether ignorantly or not,
yet the Christian religion was owned, and the name
of the true God was called upon and adored; and
it made the very recesses of my foul rejoice to fee it.
I saluted the brave Scotch merchant I mentioned
above, with my first acknowledgment of this; and,
taking him by the hand, I said to him, Blessed be
God, we are once again come among Christians!
He smiled, and answered, Do not rejoice too soon,
countryman; these Muscovites are but an odd sort of
Christians; and but for the name of it, you may fee
very little of the substance for some months far-
ther of our journey.
Well, said I, but still it is better than paganism,
and worshipping of devils. Why, I'll tell you, said
he; Except the Ruffian soldiers in garrisons, and a
few of the inhabitants of the cities upon the road,
all
all the rest of this country, for above a thousand
miles sarther, is inhabited by the worst .and most
ignorant of pagans: and so indeed we found it.
We were now launched into the greatest piece of
solid earth, if I understand any thing of the sursace
of the globe, that is to be found in any part of the
world: we had at least twelve hundred miles to the
sea, eastward; we had at least two thousand to the
bottom of the Balk sea, westward; and almost three
thousand miles, if we left that sea, and went on west
to the British and French channels; we had full five
thousand miles to the Indian or Persian sea, south; and
about eight hundred miles to the frozen sea, north:
nay, if some people may be believed, there might be
no sea north-east till we came round the pole, and
consequently into the north-west, and so had a con-
tinent of land into America, no mortal knows where;
though I could give some reasons why I believe that
to be a mistake too.
As we entered into the Muscovite dominions, a
good while before we came to any considerable town,
we had nothing to observe there but this: first, that
all the rivers run to the east. As I understood by the
charts which some of our caravans had with them,
it was plain that all those rivers ran into the great
river Tamour, or Gammour. This river, by the
natural course of it, must run into the east sea, ot
Chinese ocean. The story they tell us, that the
mouth of this river is choaked up with bulrushes of a
monstrous growth, viz. three feet about, and twenty
or thirty feet high, I must be allowed to say, I be-
lieve nothing of; but as its navigation is of no use,
because
because there is no trade that, way, the Tartars, to
whom alone it belongs, dealing in nothing but cattle;
so nobody that ever I heard of, has been curious
enough either to go down to the mouth of it in boats,
or to come up from the mouth of it in ships; but
this is certain, that this river running due east, in
the latitude of 60 degrees, carries a vast concourse
of rivers along with it, and finds an ocean to empty
itself in that latitude; so we are sure of sea there.
Some leagues to the north of this river there are
several considerable rivers, whose streams run as due
north as the Yamour runs east; and these are all found
to join their waters with the great river Tartarus,
named so from the northermost nations of the Mogul
Tartars, who, the Chinese say, were the first Tartars
in the world; and who, as our geographers alledge,
are the Gog and Magog mentioned in sacred story.
These rivers running all northward, as well as all
the other rivers I am yet to speak of, made it evident
that the northern ocean bounds the land also on that
side; so that it does not seem rational in the least to
think that the land can extend itself to join with
America on that side, or that there is not a commu-
nication between the northern and the eastern ocean;
but of this I shall say no more; it was my observation
at that time, and therefore I take notice of it in this
place. We now advanced from the river Arguna by
easy and moderate journeys, and were very visibly
obliged to the care the czar of Muscovy has taken
to have cities and towns built in as many places as are
possible to place them, where his soldiers keep garri-
son, something like the stationary soldiers placed
Vol. Is. Y by
by the Romans in the remotest countries of their
empire, some of which 1 had read were particularly
placed in Britain for the security of commerce, and
for the lodging of travellers; and thus it was here;
for wherever we came, though at these towns and
stations, the garrisons and governor were Ruffians
and professed mere pagans, sacrisicing to idols, and
worshipping the sun, moon, and stars, or all the
host of heaven; and not only so, but were, of all
the heathens and pagans that ever I met with, the
most barbarous, except only that they did not eat
man's flesh, as our savages of America did.
Some instances of this we met with in the
country between Arguna, where we enter the Mus-
covite dominions, and a city of Tartars and Ruffians
together, called Nertzinftay; in which space is a
continued desart or forest, which cost us twenty
days to travel over it. In a village, near the last
of those places, I had the curiosity to go and see
their way of living; which is most brutish and un-
sufferable: they had, I suppose, a great sacrifice that
day; for there stood out upon an old stump of a
tree, ;m idol made of wood, frightful as the devil;
at least as any thing we can think of to represent the
devil that can be made: It had an head certainly not
so much as resembling any creature that the world
ever saw; ears as big as goats horns, and as high;
eyes as big as a crown piece; and a nose like a
crooked ram's horn, and a mouth extended four-
cornered, like that of a lion, with horrible teeth,
hooked like a parrot's under bill. It was dressed up
in the filthiest manner that you can suppose; its up-
2 per
per garment was of sheep-skins, with the wool out-
ward; a great Tartar bonnet on the head, with two
horns growing through it: it was about eight feet
high, yet had no feet or legs, or any other propor-
tion of parts.
This scarecrowwas set upatthe outsideof thevillage;
and when I came near to it, there were sixteen or
seventeen creatures, whether men or women I could
not tell, for they make no distinction by their habits,
either of body or head; these lay all flat on the
ground, round this formidable block of shapeless
wood. I saw no motion among them any more than
if they had been logs of woods like their idol; at
first I really thought they had been so; but when I
came a little nearer, they started up upon their feet;
and raised an howling cry, as if it had been so
many deep-mouthed hounds, and walked away as
if they were displeased at our disturbing them. A
little way osf from this monster, and at the door of
a tent or hut, made all of sheep-skins and cow-skins,
dried, stood three butchers: I thought they were
such; for when I came nearer to them, I found they
had long knives in their hands, and in the middle
of the tent appeared three sheep killed, and one
young bullock, or steer. These, it seems, were sa-
crifices to that senseless log of an idol; and these
three men priests belonging to it; and the seventeen
prostrated wretches were the people who brought
the offering, and were making their prayers to that
stock.
I confess I was more moved at their stupidity, and
this brutiih worship of an hobgoblin, than ever I
Y 2 was
was at any thing in my life: to fee God's most; glo-
rious and best creature, to whom he had granted so
many advantages, even by creation, above the rest
of the works of his hands, vested with a reasonable
soul, and that soul adorned with saculties and capa-
cities adapted both to honour his Maker and be ho-
noured by him; I say, to fee it funk and degenerated
to a degree so more than stupid, as to prostrate itself
to a frightful nothing, a mere imaginary object dressed
up by themselves, and made terrible to themselves
by their own contrivance, adorned only with clouts
and rags; and that this mould be the effect of mere
ignorance, wrought up into hellish devotion by the
devil himself; who, envying his Maker the homage and
adoration of his creatures, had deluded them into
such gross, surfeiting, sordid, and bruitish things, as
one would think mould shock nature itself.
But what signified all the astonishment and reflec-
tion of thoughts? Thus it was, and I saw it before
my eyes; and there was no room to wonder at it,
or think it impossible. All my admiration turned to
rage; and I rode up to the image or monster, call
it what you will, and with my sword cut the bonnet
that was on its head in two in the middle, so that it
hung down by one of the horns; and one of our
men that was with me, took hold of the sheep-stun
that covered it, and pulled at it, when, behold, a most
hideous outcry and howling ran through the village,
and two or three hundred people came about my
ears, so that I was glad to scour for it; for we saw
some had bows and arrows; but I resolved from
that moment to visit them again.
Our
Our caravan rested three nights at the town,
which was about four miles off, in order to provide
some horses, which they wanted, several of the
horses having been lamed and jaded with the badness
of the way, and our long march over the last de-
sart; so we had some leisure here to put my design
in execution. I communicated my project to the
Scuts merchant, of Moscow, of whose courage I had
a susficient testimony, as above. I told him what I
had seen, and with what indignation I had since
thought, that human nature could be so degenerate.
I told him, I was resolved, if I could get but four
or five men well armed to go with me, to go and
destroy that vile, abominable idol; to let them see,
that it had no power to help itself, and consequently
could not be an object of worship, or to be prayed
to, much less help them that offered sacrifices to it.
He laughed at me: said he, Your zeal may be
good; but what do you propose to yourself by it?
Propose! said I; to vindicate the honour of God,
which is insulted by this devil-worship. But how
will it vindicate the honour of God? said he, while
the people will not be able to know what you mean
by it, unless you could speak to them too, and
tell them so; and then they will fight you too, I will
assure you; for they are desperate fellows, and that
especially in defence of their idolatry. Can we not,
said I, do it in the night, and then leave them the
reasons in writing, in their own language? Writing!
said he, why there is not in five nations of them,
one man that knows any thing of a letter, or how
to read a word in any language, or in their own.
Y 3 Wretched
Wretched ignorance! said I to him; however, I
have a great mind to do it; perhaps nature may
draw inferences from it to them, to let them fee how
brutish they are to worship such horrid things. Look
you, Sir, said he, if your zeal prompts you to it so
warmly, you must do it; but, in the next place, I
would have you consider these wild nations of people
are subjected by force to the czar of Muscovy's do-
minions; and if you do this, it is ten to one but
they will come by thousands to the governor of
Nertzinftay, and complain, and demand satissaction;
and if he cannot give them satissaction, it is ten to
one but they revolt; and it will occasion a new
war with all the Tartars in the country.
This, I confess, put new thoughts into my head
for a while; but I harped upon the same string still;
and all that day I was uneasy to put my project in
execution. Towards the evening, the Scots merchant
met me by accident in our walk about the town,
and defired to speak with me: I believe, said he,
I have put you osf your good design; I have been
a little concerned about it since; for I abhor the
idol and idolatry as much as you can do. Truly,
said I, you have put it oft' a little as to the execution
of it, but you have not put it all out of my thoughts;
and, I believe, I shall do it still before I quit this
place, though I were to be delivered up to them for
satissaction. No, no, said he; God forbid they
should deliver you up to such a crew of monsters!
they shall not do that neither; that would be mur-
dering you indeed. Why, said I, how would they
use me? Use you! said he; I'll tell you how they
served a poor Ruffian, who affronted them in their
worship
•worship just as you did, and whom they took pri-
soner, after they had lamed him with an arrow, that
he could not run away; they took him and stripped
him stark naked, and set him upon the top of the
idol monster, and stood all round him, and shot as
many arrows into him as would stick over his whole
body; and then they burnt him and all the arrows
sticking in him, as a sacrifice to the idol. And was
this the same idol? said I. Yes, said he, the very
same. Well, said I, I will tell you a story: So I
related the story of our men at Madagascar, and how
they burnt and sacked the village there, and killed
man, woman, and child, for their murdering one of
our men, just as it is related before; and when I
had done, I added, that I thought we ought to do
so to this village.
He listened very attentively to the story; but when
I talked of doing so to that village, said he, you mis-
take very much; it was not this village, it was al-
most an hundred miles from this place; but it was
the same idol, for they carry him about in procession
all over the country. Well, said I, then that idol
ought to be punished for it; and it shall, said I, if I
live this night out.
In a word, finding me resolute, he liked the de-
sign, and told me, I should not go alone, but he
would go with me; but he would go first, and bring
a stout fellow, one of his countrymen, to go also
with us; and one, said he, as samous for his zeal
as you can defire any one to be against such devilish
things as these. In a word, he brought me his com-
rade, a Scotsman, whom he called Captain Richard-
son; and I gave him a full account of what I had
Y 4 seen,
seen, and also of what I intended; and he told me
readily, he would go with me, if it cost him his life.
So we agreed to go, only we three. I had, indeed}
proposed it to my partner; but he declined it. He
said, he was ready to assist me to the utmost, and
upon all occasions, for my defence; but that this
was an adventure quite out of his way : so, I say,
we resolved upon our work, only we three, and my
man-servant, and to put it in execution that night
about midnight, with all the secrecy imaginable.
However, upon second thoughts, we were willing
to delay it till the next night, because the caravan
being to set forward in the morning, we supposed the
governor could not pretend to give them any satis-
faction upon us when we were out of his power.—
The Scots merchant, as steady in his resolution to en-
terprize it as bold in executing, brought me a Tar-
tar's robe or gown of sheep-skins, and a bonnet,
with a bow and arrows, and had provided the same
for himself and his countryman, that the people, if
they saw us, should not be able to determine who we
were.
All the first night we spent in mixing up some
combustible matter with aqua-vitæ, gunpowder, and
such other materials as we could get; and, having
a good quantity of tar in a little pot, about an hour
after night we set out upon our expedition.
We came to the place about eleven o'clock at
night, and found that the people had not the least
jealousy of danger attending their idol; the night
was cloudy; yet the moon gave us light enough to
fee that the idol stood just in the same posture and
place that it did before. The people seemed to be
1 all
all at their rest; only, that in the great hut, or tent
as we called it, where we saw the three priests, whom
we mistook for butchers, we sa* a light, and, go-
ing up close to the door, we heard people talking,
as if there were five or fix of them; we concluded
therefore, that if we set wild-fire to the idol, these
men would come out immediately, and run up to the
place to rescue it from the destruction that we intended
for it; and what to do with them we knew not. Once
we thought of carrying it away, and setting fire to it
at a distance; but when we came to handle it, we
found it too bulky for our carriage; so we were at
a loss again. The second Scotsman was for setting
fire to the tent or hut, and knocking the creatures
that were there on the head, when they came out;
but I could not join with that; I was against killing
them, if it was possible to be avoided. Well then,
said the Scots merchant, I will tell you what we will
do; we will try to make them prisoners, tie their
hands, and make them stand and fee their idol
destroyed.
As it happened, we had twine or packthread
enough about us, which we used to tie our fire-
works together with; so we resolved to attack these
people first, and with as little noise as we could.
The first thing we did, we knocked at the door,
when one ol the priests coming to it, we immediate-
ly seized upon him, stopped his mouth, and tied his
hands behind him and led him to the idol, where we
gagged him that he might not make a noise; tied
his feet also together, and left him on the ground.
Two of us then waited at the door, expecting that
another would come out to fee what the matter
was;
was; but we waited so long till the third man came
back to us; ' and then, nobody coming out, we
knocked again gently, and immediately out came
two more, and we served them just in the same man-
ner, but were obliged to go all with them, and lay
them down by the idol some distance from one
another; when, going back, we found two more
were come out to the door, and a third stood
behind them within the door. We seized the two,
and immediately tied them: when the third stepping
back, and crying out, my Scots merchant went in
after him, and taking out a composition we had
made, that would only smoke and stink, he set
sire to it, and threw it in among them: by that time
the other Scotsman and my man taking charge of the
two men already bound, and tied together also by
the arm, led them away to the idol, and left them
there, to see if their idol would relieve them, making
haste back to us.
When the furze we had thrown in had silled the
hut with so much smoke that they were almost susfo-
cated, we then threw in a small leather bag of
another kind, which flamed like a candle, and, fol-
lowing it in, we found there were but four people
left, who, it seems, were two men and two women,
and, as we supposed, had been about some of their
diabolic sacrifices. They appeared, in short, fright-
ed to death, at least so as to sit trembling and stupid,
and not able to speak neither, for the smoke.
In a word, we took them, bound them as we had
the other, and all without any noise. I should have
said, we brought them out of the house, or hut, first;
for, indeed, we were not able to bear the smoke any
more
331
more than they were. When we had done this, we
carried them altogether to the idol: when we came
there we fell to work with him; and first we daubed
him all over, and his robes also, with tar, and such
other stuff as we had, which was tallow mixed with
brimstone; then we stopped his eyes, and ears, and
mouth full of gunpowder; then we wrapped up a
great piece of wildfire in his bonnet; and then stick-
ing all the combustibles we had brought with us upon
him, we looked about to fee if we could find any
thing else to help to burn him; when my Scotsman
remembered, that by the tent, or hut, where the
men were, there lay a heap of dry forage, whether
straw or rushes I do not remember: away he and
the other Scotsman ran, and fetched their arms full of
that. When we had done this, we took all our pri-
soners, and brought them, having untied their feet,
and ungagged their mouths, and made them stand
up, and set them just before their monstrous idol,
and then set fire to the whole.
We stayed by it a quarter of an hour," or there-
abouts, till the powder in the eyes, and mouth, and
ears of the idol blew up, and, as we could perceive,
had split and deformed the shape of it; and, in a
word, till we saw it burnt into a mere block or log
of wood; and then setting the dry forage io it, we
found it would be soon quite consumed; so we began
to think of going away; but the Scotsman said: No,
we must not go; for these poor deluded wretches
will all throw themselves into the fire, and burn
themselves with the idol; so we resolved to stay till
the forage was burnt down too, and then we came
away and left them.
-
In the morning we appeared among our fellow
travellers, exceeding busy in getting ready for our
journey; nor could any man suggest that we had been
anywhere but in our beds, as travellers might be
supposed to be, to fit themselves for the satigues of
that day's journey.
But it did not end so; for the next day came a
great multitude of the country people, not only of
this village, but of an hundred more, for aught I
know, to the town gates; and, in a most outrageous
manner, demanded satissaction of the Ruffian gover-
nor, for the insulting their priests, and burning their
great Cham-Chi-Thaungu; such an hard name they
gave the monstrous creature they worshipped: the
people of Nertzinffay were at first in a great conster-
nation; for, they said, the Tartars were no less than
thirty thousand, arid that in a few days more, they
would be one hundred thousand stronger.
The Ruffian governor sent out messengers to ap-
pease them, and gave them all the good words ima-
ginable. He assured them he knew nothing of it,
and that there had not a foul of his garrison been
abroad; that it could not be from any body there;
and if they would let him know who it was, they
should be exemplaiily punished. They returned
haughtily, That all the country reverenced the
great Cham-Chi-Thaungu, who dwelt in the sun, and
no mortal would have dared to offer violence to his
image, but some Christian miscreant; so they called
them, it seems, and they therefore denounced war
against him, and all the Riiffians, who, they said,
were miscreants and Christians.
The
The governor, still patient, and unwilling to
make a breach, or to have any cause of war alledged
to be given by him, the czar having straightly charged
him to treat the conquered country with gentleness
and civility, gave them still all the good words he
could; at last he told them, there was a caravan
gone towards Russia that morning, and perhaps it
was some of them who had done them this injury;
and that, if they would be satisfied with that, he
would fend after them, to enquire into it. This
seemed to appease them a little; and accordingly
the governor sent after us, and gave us a particular
account how the thing was; intimating, withal, that
if any in our caravan had done it, they should make
their escape; but that, whether they had done it or
no, we should make all the haste forward that
was possible; and that in the mean time, he would
keep them in play as long as he could.
This was very friendly in the governor. How-
ever, when it came to the caravan, there was no-
body knew any thing of the matter; and, as for us
that were guilty, we were the least of all suspected;
none so much as asked us the question; ho wever, the
captain of the caravan, for the time, took the hint
that the governor gave us, and we marched or tra-
velled two days and two nights without any conside-
rable stop, and then we lay at a village called
Platbus; nor did we make any long stop here, but
hastened on towards Jarawena, another of the czar
of Muscovy's colonies, and where we expected we
mould be safe; but it is to be observed, that here
we began, for two or three days march, to enter
upon a vast nameless desart, of which I shall say more
in
334
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
in its place; and which if we had now been upon
is more than probable, we had been all destroyed.
It was the second day's march from-Plotbus, that by
the clouds of dust behind us at a great distance, some
of our people began to be sensible we were pursued;
we had entered the desart, and had passed by a great
lake, called Schanks OJier, when we perceived a very
great body of horse appear on the other side of the
lake to the north, we travelling west. We ob-
served they went away west, as we did; but had sup-
posed we mould have taken that side of the lake,
whereas we very happily took the south side; and in
two days more we saw them not, for they, believing
we were still before them, pushed on, till they came
to the river Udda: This is a very great river when it
passes sarther north; but when we came to it, we
found it narrow and fordable.
The third day they either found their mistake, of
had intelligence of us, and came pouring in upon
us, towards the dusk of the evening. 'We had, to
our great satissaction, just pitched upon a place for
our camp, which was very convenient for the night;
for as we were upon a desart, though but at the be-
ginning of it, that was above five hundred miles over,
we had no towns to lodge at, and, indeed, expected
none but the city 'Jarawcna, which we had yet two
days march to; the desart, however, had some few
woods in it on this side, and little rivers, which ran
all into the great river Udda. It was in a narrow
strait between two small, but very thick woods,
that we pitched our little camp for that night, ex-
pecting to be attacked in the night.
N Nobody
335
Nobody knew but ourselves what we were pursued
for; but as it was usual for the Mogul Tartars to go
about in troops in that desart, so the caravans al-
ways fortify themselves every night against them, as
against armies of robbers: and it was therefore no
new thing to be pursued.
But we had this night, of all the nights of our tra-
vels, a most advantageous camp; for we lay between
two woods, with a little rivulet running just before
our front; so that we could not be surrounded or
attacked any way, but in our front or rear: we took
care also to make our front as strong as we could, by
placing our packs, with our camels and horses, all
in a line on the side of the river, and we felled some
trees in our rear.
In this posture we encamped for the night; but
the enemy was upon us before we had finished our
situation: they did not come on us like thieves, as
we expected, but sent three messengers to us, to
demand the men to be delivered to them, that had
abused their priests, and burnt their god Cbam-Cbi-
Tbaungu, that they might burn them with fire; and,
upon this, they said, they would go away, and do
us no sarther harm, otherwise they would burn us
all with fire. Our men looked very blank at this
message, and began to stare at one another, to fee
who looked with most guilt in their saces, but, no-
body was the word, nobody did it. The leader of
the caravan sent word, he was well assured it was not
done by any of our camp; that we were peaceable
merchants, travelling on our business; that we had
done no harm to them, or to any one else; and
therefore they must look sarther for their enemies,
who
who had injured them, for we were not the people;
so defired them not to disturb us; for if they did,
we mould defend ourselves.
They were sar from being satisfied with this for an
answer, and a great crowd of them came down in
the morning, by break of day, to our camp; but,
seeing us in such an advantageous situation, they
durst come no sarther than the brook in our front,
where they stood, and shewed us such a number, as,
indeed, terrified us very much; for those that spoke
least of them, spoke of ten thousand. Here they
stood, and looked at us a while, and then setting up
a great howl, they let fly a cloud of arrows among
us; but we were well enough fortified for that, for
we were sheltered under our baggage; and I do not
remember that one man of us was hurt.
Some time after this, we saw them move a little
to our right, and expected them on the rear, when
a cunning fellow, a Co/sack, as they call them, of
"Jara'wena, in the pay of the Muscovites, calling to
the leader of the caravan, said to him, I will send
all these people away to Sibeilka: This was a city four
or five days journey, at least to the south, and rather
behind us. So he takes his bow and arrows, and,
getting on horseback, he rides away from our rear
directly, as it were, back to Ncrtzinskay; after this,
he takes a great circuit about, and comes to the army
of the Tartars, as if he had been sent express to
tell them a long story, that the people who had
burnt their Cham-Chi-Tbaungu were gone to Sibeilka,
with a caravan of miscreants, as he called them;
that is to say, Christians; and that they were re-
solved
solved to burn the god Seal Isarg, belonging to the
Tongujcs.
As this fellow was a mere Tartar, and perfectly
spoke their language, he counterfeited so well, that
they all took it from him, and away they drove, in
a most violent hurry, to Sibeilka, which, it seems,
was five days journey to the south; and in less than
three hours they were entirely out of our sight,
and we never heard any more of them, nor ever
knew whether they went to that other place called
Sibeilka, or no.
So we passed safely on to the city of Jaraivena^
where there was a garrison of Muscovites; and there
we rested five days, the caravan being exceedingly
satigued with the last day's march, and with want
of rest in the night.
From this city we had a frightful desart, which
held us three-and-twenty days march. We furnished
ourselves with some tents here, for the better ac-
commodating ourselves in the night; and the leader
of the caravan procured sixteen carriages, or wag-
gons, of the country, for carrying o.ur water and *
provisions; and these carriages were our defence
every night round our little camp; so that had the
Tartars appeared, unless they had been very nume-
rous indeed, they would not have been able to hurt
us.
We may well be supposed to want rest again after
this long journey; for in this desart we saw nei-
ther house or tree, or scarce a bush; we saw, indeed,
abundance of the sable-hunters, as they called them:
These are all Tartars of the Mogul Tartary, of which
this country is a part; and they frequently attack
Vol. II. ' Z small
small caravans; but we saw no numbers of them to-
gether. I was curious to fee the sable-skins they
catched; but I could never speak with any of them;
for they durst not come near us; neither durst we
straggle from our company to go near them.
After we had passed this desart, we came into a
country pretty well inhabited; that is to say, we
found towns and castles settled by the czar of Mus-
covy , with garrisons of stationary soldiers to protect
the caravans, and defend the country against the
Tartars, who would otherwise make it very dan-
gerous travelling; and his czarish majesty has given
such strict orders for the well guarding the caravans
and merchants, that if there are any Tartars heard
of in the country, detachments of the garrison are
always sent to see travellers safe from station to sta-
tion.
And thus the governor of Adinskoy, whom I had
an opportunity to make a visit to, by means of the
Scots merchant, who was acquainted with him, of-
fered us a guard of fifty men, if we thought there
was any danger, to the next station.
I thought long before this, that as we came nearer
to Europe, we should find the country better peopled,
and the people more civilized; but I found myself
mistaken in both, for we had yet the nation of the
Tongucses to pass through; where we saw the same
tokens of paganism and barbarity, or v, orse, than
before; only as they were conquered by the Mus-
covites, and entirely reduced, they were not so dan-
gerous; but for the rudeness of manners, idolatry,
and polytheism, no people in the world ever went
beyond them. They are clothed all in skins of
beasts,
beasts, and their houses are built of the fame.
You know not a man from a woman, neither by
the ruggednefs of their countenances, or their
clothes; and in the winter, when the ground is co-
vered with snow, they live under ground, in houses
like vaults, which have cavities of caves going from
one to another.
If the Tartars had their Cham-Cbi-Thaungu for a
whole village, or country, these had idols in every
hut, and every cave; besides, they worship the
stars, the fun, the water, the snow; and, in a word,
every thing that they do not understand, and they
understand but very little; so that almost every ele-
ment, every uncommon thing, sets them a sacri-
ficing.
But I am no more to describe people than coun-
tries, any sarther than my own story comes to be
concerned in them. I met with nothing peculiar
to myself in all this country, which, I reckon was,
from the desart which I spoke of last, at least four
hundred miles, half of it being another desart,
which took us up twelve days severe travelling,
without house, tree or bush; but were obliged again
to carry our o,wn provisions, as well water as bread.
After we were out of this desart, and had tra-
velled two days, we came to yanezay, a Musco-
vite city or station, on the great river jfanczay.
This river, they told us, parted Europe from Asia,
though our map-makers, as I am told, do not agree
to it; however, it is certainly the eastern boundary
of the antient Siberia, which now makes a province
only of the vast Muscovite empire, but is itself equal
in bigness to the whole empire of Germany.
Z 2 And
f And ret here I observed ignorance and paganism
'still prevailed, except in the Muscovite garrisons:
All Lhe country between the river Oby, and the river
jsa..iezay, is as entirely pagan, and the people as bar-
barous, as the remotest of the Tartars; nay, as
any nation, for aught I know, in Asia or America.
I also found, which I observed to the Muscovite go-
vernors, whom I had opportunity to converse with,
that the pagans are not much the wiser, or the nearer
Christianity, for being under the Muscovite go-
vernment; which they acknowledged was true
enough, but, they said, it was none of their bu-
siness ; that if the czar expected to convert his Si-
berian, or Tongurse, or Tartar subjects, it should be
done by sending clergymen among them, not so!-
diers; and they added, with more sincerity than I
expected, that they found it was not so much the con-
cern of their monarch to make the people Christians,
as it was to make them subjects.
From this river to the great river Oby, we crossed
a wild uncultivated country; I cannot say 'tis a bar-
barous soil; 'tis only barren of people, and wants good
management; otherwise it is in itself a most
pleasant, fruitful, and agreeable country. What
inhabitants we found in it are all pagans, except
such as are sent among them from Russia; for this
is the country, I mean on both sides the river Oby,
whither the Muscovite criminals, that are not put
to death, arc banished, and from whence it is next
to impossible they should ever come away.
I have nothing material to say of my particular
affairs, till I came to Tobolsk'^ the capital of Si-
berij,
beria, where I continued some time on the following
occasion :—
We had been now almost seven months on our
journey, and winter began to come on apace;
whereupon my partner and I called a council about
our particular asfairs, in which we found it proper,
considering that we were bound for England, aud
not for Moscow, to consider how to dispose of our-
selves. They told us of sledges and rein deer to
carry us over the snow in the winter-time; and, in-
deed, they have such things, as it would be incredi-
ble to relate the particulars of, by which means the
Russians travel more in the winter than they can in
summer; because in these sledges they are able to
run night and day: the snow being frozen, is one
universal covering to nature, by which the the hills,
the vales, the rivers, the lakes, are all smooth, and
hard as a stone; and they run upon the sursace,
without any regard to what is underneath.
But I had no occasion to push at a winter journey
of this kind; I was bound to England, not to Mos-
cow, and my route lay two ways: either 1 must go
on as the caravan went, till I came to jarijlaw, and
then go off west for Narva, and the gulph of Fin-
land, and so either by sea or land to Dantzick, where
I might possibly sell my China cargo to good advan-
tage, or I must leave the caravan at a little town on
the Dwina, from whence I had but six davs bv wa-
ter to Arch-Angel, and from thence might be sure
of stripping, either to Er.gland, Holland, or Ham-
burgh.
Z 3 Now
Now to go any of these journies in the winter
would have been preposterous; for as to Dantzic, the
Baltic would be frozen up, and I could not get passage;
and to go by land in those countries, was sar less
safe than among the Mogul Tartars; likewise to
Arch-Angel, in October all the ships would be gone
srom thence, and even the merchants, who dwell
there in summer, retire south to Moscow in the win-
ter, when the ships are gone; so that I should have
nothing but extremity of cold to encounter, with a
scarcity of provisions, and must lie there in an
empty town all the winter: so that, upon the whole,
I thought it much my better way to let the caravan
go, and to make provision to winter where I was,
viz. at Toboljki, in Siberia, in the latitude of sixty
degrees, where I was sure of three things to wear
out a cold winter with, viz. plenty of provisions,
such as the country afforded, a warm house, with
fuel enough, and excellent company; of all which
I shall give a full account in its place.
I was now in a quite different climate from my
beloved island, where I never felt cold, except when
I had my ague; on the contrary, I had much to do
to bear my clothes on my back, and never made any
fire but without doors, and my necessity, in dressing
my food, &c. Now I made me three good vests,
with large robes or gowns over them, to hang down
to the feet, and button close to the wrists, and all
these lined with furs, to make them sufficiently
warm.
As to a warm house, I must confess, I greatly dis-
like our way in England, of making fires in every
room
room in the house, in open chimnies, which, when
the fire was out, always kept the air in the room
cold as the climate. But taking an apartment in a
good house in the town, I ordered a chimney to be
built like a furnace, in the centre of fix several rooms,
like a stove; the funnel to carry the smoke went up
one way, the door to come at the fire went in
another, and all the rooms were kept equally warm,
but no fire seen; like as they heat the bagnios in
England.
By this means we had always the same climate in
all the rooms, and an equal heat was preserved; and
how cold soever it was without, it was always warm
within; and yet we saw no fire, nor were ever in-
commoded with any smoke.
The most wonderful thing of all was, that it should
be possible to meet with good company here, in a
country so barbarous as that of the most, northerly
parts of Europe, near the frozen ocean, and within
but a very few degrees of Nova Zembla.
But this being the country where the state crimi-
nals of Muscovy, as I observed before, are all banished;
this city was full of noblemen, princes, gentlemen,
colonels, and, in short, all degrees of the nobility,
gentry, soldiery, and courtiers of Muscovy. Here
were the samous Prince Galilfkcn, or Galoffken, and
his son; the old general Robostisky, and several other
persons of note, and some ladies.
By means of my Scots merchant, whom, never,
thelefs, I parted with here, I made an acquaintance
with several of these gentlemen, and some of them
of the first rank; and from these, in the long winter
nights, in which I staid here, I received several agree-
Z 4 able
able visits. It was talking one night with a certain
prince, one of the banished ministers of state be-
longing to the czar of Muscovy, that my talk of my
particular case began, He had been telling me abun-
dance of fine things, of the greatness, the magni-
ficence, and dominions, and the absolute power of
the emperor of the Ruffians. I interrupted him, and
told him, I was a greater and more powerful prince
than ever the zcar of Muscovy was, though my do-
minions were not so large, or my people so many.
The Russian grandee looked a little surprized, and
fixing his eyes steadily upon me, began to wonder
what I meant.
I told him his wonder would cease when I had
explained myself. First, I told him, I had the ab-
solute disposal of the lives and fortunes of all my
subjects; That notwithstanding my absolute power,
I had not one person disaffected to my government
or to my person, in all my dominions. He shook
his head at that, and said, There, indeed, I out-did
the czar of Muscovy. I told him, that all the lands
in my kingdom were my. own, and all my subjects
were not only my tenants, but tenants at will; that
they would all fight for me to the last drop; and
that never tyrant, for such I acknowledged myself to
be, was ever so universally beloved, and yet so hor-
ribly feared, by his subjects.
After amusing them with these riddles in go-
vernment for a while, I opened the case, and told
them the story at large of my living in the island,
and how I managed both myself and the people there
that were under me, just as I have since minuted it
down. They were exceedingly taken with the story,
and

and especially the prince, who told me with a sigh,
that the true greatness of life was to be master of
ourselves; that he would not have changed such a
state of life as mine, to have been czar of Muscovy;
and that he found more felicity in the retirement he
seemed to be banished to there, than ever he found
in the highest authority he enjoyed in the court of
his master the czar: that the heighth of human wis-
dom was to bring our tempers down to our circum-
stances, and to make a calm within, under the
weight of the greatest storm without. When he
came first hither, he said, he used to tear the hair
from hisNhead, and the clothes from his back, as
others had done before him; but a little time and
consideration had made him look into himself, as
well as round himself, to things without: that he
found the mind of man, if it was but once brought
to reflect upon the state of universal lise, and how
little this world was concerned in its true felicity,
was perfectly capable of making a selicity for itself,
fully satisfying to itself, and suitable to its own best
ends and defires, with but very little assistance from
the world; that air to breathe in, food to sustain life,
clothes for warmth, and liberty for exercise, in order
to health, compleated, in his opinion, all that the
world could do for us: and though the greatness,
the authority, the riches, and the pleasures, which
some enjoyed in the world, and which he had en-
joyed his mare of, had much in them that was agree-
able to us, yet he observed, that all those things
chiefly gratified the coarsest of our asfections; such
as our ambition, our particular pride, our avarice,
j*ur vanity, and our sensuality; all which were,
indeed,
indeed, the mere product of the worst part of man,
were in themselves crimes, and had in them the feeds
of all manner of crimes; but neither were related to
or concerned with, any of those virtues that consti-
tuted us wife men, or of those graces which distin-
guished us as Chri/lians: that being now deprived of
all the sancied felicity, which he enjoyed in the full
exercise of all those vices, he said, he was at leisure
to look upon the dark side of them, where he found
all manner of deformity; and was now convinced,
that virtue only makes a man truly wife, rich, and
great, and preserves him in the way to a superior
happiness in a future state; and in this, he said,
they were more happy in their banishment, than all
their enemies were, who had the full possession of all
the wealth and power that they (the banished) had
left behind them.
Nor, Sir, said he, do I bring my mind to this
politically, by the necessity of my circumstances,
which some call miserable; but, if I know any thing
of myself, I would not go back, no not though
my mailer, the czar, mould call me, and offer to
reinstate me in all my former grandeur; I say, I
would no more go back to it, than I believe my soul
when it shall be delivered from this prison of the body
and has had a taste of the glorious state beyond life,
would come back to the goal of flesh and blood it is
now inclosed in, and leave heaven to deal in the dirt
and grime of human affairs.
He spake this with so much warmth in his temper,
so much earnestness and motion of his spirits, which
were apparent in his countenance, that it was evident
it was the true sense of his soul; and, indeed, there
was no room to doubt his sincerity.
I told
I told him, I once thought myself a kind of a
monarch in my old station, of which I had given
him an account, but that I thought he was not a
monarch only, but a great conqueror; for that he
that has got a victory over his own exorbitant de-
sires, and has the absolute dominion over himself,
and whose reason entirely governs his will, is cer-
tainly greater than he that conquers a city. But,
my lord, said I, shall I take the liberty to ask you a
question? With all my heart, said he. If the door
of your liberty was opened, said I, would not you
take hold of it to deliver yourself from this exile?
rlold, said he, your question is subtle, and re-
quires some serious just distinctions to give it a sincere
answer; and I'll give it you from the bottom of my
heart. Nothing that I know of in this world would
move me to deliver myself from the state of banish-
ment, except these two: First, the enjoyment of my
relations; and, secondly, a little warmer climate:
but I protest to you, that to go back to the pomp of
the court, the glory, the power, the hurry of a mi-
nister of state; the wealth, the gaiety, and the plea-
sures, that is to say, foliies of a courtier; if my mas-
ter should send me word this moment, that he restores
me to all he banished me from; I protest, if I know
myself at all, I would not leave this wilderness, these
desarts, and these frozen lakes, for the palace of
Moscow.
But, my lord, said I, perhaps you not only are .
banished from the pleasures of the court, and from the
power, and authority, and wealth, you enjoyed be-
fore, but you may be absent too from some of the con-
veniencies of life; your estate, perhaps, confiscated,
and
and your esfects plundered; and the supplies left
you here may not be suitable to the ordinary demands
of life.
Ay, said he, that k as you suppose me to be, a lord,
or a prince, &c. So, indeed, I am; but you are
now to consider me only as a man, an human crea-
ture, not at all distinguished from another; and so I
can suffer no want, unless I should be visited with
sickness and distempers. However, to put the ques-
tion out of dispute; you see our manner; we are in
this place five persons of rank; we live perfectly re-
tired, as suited to a state of banishment; we have
something rescued from the shipwreck of our fortunes,
which keeps us from the mere necessity of hunting
for our food; but the poor soldiers who are here,
without that help, live in as much plenty as we.
They go into the woods, and catch sables and foxes;
the labour of a month will maintain them a year;
and as the way of living is not expensive, so it is not
hard to get sufficient to ourselves: So that objection
is out of doors.
I have no room to give a full account of the most
agreeable conversation I had with this truly great
man; in all which he shewed, that his mind was so
inspired with a superior knowledge of things, so sup-
ported by religion, as well as by a vast share of wis-
dom, that his contempt of the world was really as
much as he had expressed, and that he was always
• the same to the last, as will appear in the story I am
going to tell.
I had been here eight months, and a dark dreadful
winter I thought it to be; the cold was so intense,
tha
349
that I couki not so much as look abroad without
being wrapt in furs, and a mask of fur before my
face, or rather a hood, with only an hole for breath,
and two for fight. The little day-light we had, vyas,
as we reckoned, for three months, not above five
hours a day, and six at most; only that the snow
lying on the ground continually, and the weather
being clear, it was never quite dark. Our horses were
kept (or rather starved) under-ground; and, as, for
our servants (for we hired servants here to look after
our horses and ourselves), we had every now and then
their fingers and toes to thaw, and take care of, lest
they mould mortify and sall off.
It is true, within doors we were warm, the houses
being close, the walls thick, the lights small, and the
glass all double. Our food was chiefly the flesh of
deer, dried and cured in the season; good bread
enough, but baked as biscuits; dried fish of several
sorts, and some flesh of mutton, and of buffaloes,
which is pretty good beef. AH the store of pro-
vision for the winter are laid up in the summer, and
well cured; our drink was water mixed with aqua
vitæ instead of brandy; and, for a treat, mead instead
of wine; which, however, they have excellent good.
The hunters, who ventured abroad all weathers, fre-
quently brought us in fresh venison, very sat and
good; and sometimes bears flesh, but we did not
much care for the last. We had a good stock of tea,
with which we treated our friends as above; and, in
a word, we lived very chearfully and well, all things
considered.
It was now March, and the days grown consider-
ably longer, and the weather at least tolerable; so
other
other travellers began to prepare fledges to carry them
over the snow, and to get things ready to be going .
but my measures being fixed, as I have said, for
Arch-Angel, and not for Muscovy or the Baltick, I
made no motion, knowing very well, that the ships
from the south do not set out for that part of the
world till May or June; and that if I was there at
the beginning of August, it would be as soon as any
ships would be ready to go away; and therefore, I
say, I made no haste to be gone, as others did; in a
word, I saw a great many people, nay, all the tra-
vellers, go away before me. It seems, every year
they go from thence to Moscow for trade; viz. tp
carry furs, and buy necessaries with them, which
they bring back to furnish their shops; also others
went on the same errand to Arch-Angel; but then
they also, being to come back again above eight
hundred miles, went all out before me.
In short, about the latter end of May, I began to
make all ready to pack up; and as I was doing this,
it occurred to me, that seeing all these people were
banished by the czar of Muscovy to Siberia, and yet,
when they came there, were at liberty to go whither
they would; why did they not then go away to any
part of the world wherever they thought fit? and I
began to examine what should hinder them from
making such an attempt.
But my wonder was over, when I entered upon
that subject with the person I have mentioned, who
answered me thus: Consider, first, said he, the
place where we are; and, secondly, the condition we
are in; especially, said he, the generality of the
people
people who are banished hither. We are surrounded,
said he, with stronger things than bars and bolts:
on the north fide is an unnavigable ocean, where ship
never sailed, and boat never swam; neither, if we
had both, could we know whither to go with them.
Every other way, said he, we have above a thousand
miles to pass through the czar's own dominions, and
by ways utterly impassable, except by the roads made
by the government, and through the towns garrisoned
by his troops; so that we could neither pass undis-
covered by the read, or subsist any other way: so
that it is in vain to attempt it.
I was silenced, indeed, at once, and found that
they were in a prison, every jot as secure, as if they
had been locked up in the castle of Moscow; how-
ever, it came into my thoughts, that I might
certainly be made an instrument to procure the escape
of this excellent person, and that it was very easy
for me to carry him away, there being no guard over
him in the country; and as I was not going to Mos-
cow, but to Arch-Angel, and that I went in the na-
ture of a caravan, by which I was not obliged to lie
in the stationary towns in the desart, but could en-
camp every night were I would, we might easily
pass uninterrupted to Arch-Angel, where I could im-
mediately secure him on board an English or Dutch
ship, and carry him off safe along with me; and
as to his subsistence, and other particulars, that
mould be my care, till he mould better supply him-
self.
He heard me very attentively, and looked earnestly
on me all the while I spoke; nay, I could see in his
very sace, that what I said put his spirits into an ex-
3 ceeding
ceeding ferment; his colour frequently changes
his eyes looked red, and his heart fluttered, that it
might be even perceived in his countenance; nos
could he immediately answer me when I had
done, and, as it were, expected what he would say to
it; and after he had paused a little, he embraced
me, and said, How unhappy are we! unguided crea-
tures as we are, that even our greatest acts of friend-
ship are made snares to us, and we are made tempters
of one another! My dear friend, said he, your osfer is
so sincere, has such kindness in it, is so disinterested
in itself, and is so calculated for my advantage, that
I must have very little knowledge of the world, if I
did not both wonder at it, and acknowledge the
obligation I have upon me to you for it: But did
you believe I was sincere in what I have so often said
to you of my contempt of the world? Did you be-
lieve I spoke my very soul to you, and that I had
really maintained that degree of felicity here, that
had placed me above all that the world could give
me, or do for me? Did you believe I was sincere,
when I told you I would not go back, if I was re-
called even to be all that once I was in the court, and
with the savour of the czar my master? Did you
believe me, my friend, to be an honest man, or did
you think me to be a boasting hypocrite ?—Here he
stopped, as if he would hear what I would say; but,
indeed, I soon after perceived, that he stopped be-
cause his spirits were in motion; his heart was full
of struggles, and he could not go on. I was, I con-
fess, astonished at the thing, as well as at the man,
and I used some arguments with him to urge him to
set himself free; that he ought to look upon this as a
2 door
door opened by Heaven for his deliverance, and a
summons by Providence, who has the care and
good disposition of all events, to do himself good,
and to render himself useful in the world.
He had by this time recovered himself. How do
you know, Sir, said he, warmly, but that instead of
a summons from Heaven, it may be a feint of another
instrument, representing, in all the alluring colours,
to me, the shew of felicity as a deliverance, which
may in itself be my snare, and tend directly to my
ruin? Here I am free from the temptation of return,
ing to my former miserable greatness; there I am
not sure, but that all the seeds of pride, ambition,
avarice, and luxury, which I know remain in my
nature, may revive and take root, and, in a word,
again overwhelm me; and then the happy prisoner,
whom you see now master of his soul's liberty, shall
be the miserable slave of his own fenses, in the full
possession of all personal liberty. Dear Sir, let me
remain in this blessed confinement, banished from the
crimes of life, rather than purchase a show of free*
dom at the expence of the liberty of my reason,
and at the expence of the suture happiness which
now I have in my view, but shall then, I fear, quick-
ly lose sight of; for I am but flesh, a man, a mere
man, have passions and affections as likely to possess
and overthrow me as any man: O be not my friend
and my tempter both together!
If I was surprised before, I was quite dumb now,
and stood silent, looking at him; and, indeed, ad-
mired what I saw; the struggle in his foul was so
Vol. II. A a great,
great, that though the weather was extremely cold,
it put him into a most violent sweat, and I found he
wanted to give vent to his mind; so I said a word or
two, that I would leave him to consider of it, and
wait on him again; and then I withdrew to my own
apartment.
About two hours after, I heard somebody at or
near the door of the room, and I was going to open
the door; but he had Opened it, and come in: My
dear friend, said he, you had almost overset me, but
I am recovered: do not take it ill that I do not close
with your offer; I assure you, it is not for want of
a fense of the kindness of it in you; and I come to
make the most sincere acknowledgement of it to you;
but, I hope, I have got the victory over myself.
My lord, said I, I hope you are fully satisfied, that
you did not resist the call of Heaven. Sir, said he,
if it had been from Heaven, the same power would
have influenced me to accept it; but I hope, and am
fully satisfied, that it is from Heaven that I decline
it; and I have an infinite satissaction in the parting,
that you shall leave me an honest man still, though
not a free man.
I had nothing to do but to acquiesce, and make
pro,r lion to him of my having no end in it, but a
sincere defire to serve him. He embraced me very
passionately, and assured me, he was sensible of that,
and should always acknowledge it; and with that
he offered me a very fine present of sables, too much
indeed for me to accept from a man in his circum-
stances; and I would have avoided them, but he
would not be refused.
The
The next morning I sent my servant to his lord-
ship, with a small present of tea, two pieces of China
damask, and four little wedges of japan gold, which
did not all weigh above six ounces, or thereabouts;
but were sar short of the value of his sables, which
indeed, when I came to England, I found worth near
two hundred pounds. He accepted the tea, and
one piece of the damask, and one of the pieces of
gold, which had a fine stamp upon it, of the Japan
coinage, which I found he took for the rarity of it,
but would not take anv more; and sent word by my
servant, that he defired to speak with me.
When I came to him, he told me, I knew what
had passed between us, and hoped I would not move
him any more in that affair; but that, since I made
such a generous offer to him, he aslied me, if I had
kindness enough to offer the same to another person
that he would name to me, in whom he had a great
share of concern. I told him, that I could not say I
inclined to do so much for any one but himself, for
whom I had a particular value, and should have been
glad to have been the instrument of his deliverance:
however, if he would please to name the person to me,
I would give him my answer, and hoped he would
not be displeased with me, if he was with my answer.
He told me, it was only his son, who, though I had
not seen, yet was in the same condition with himself,
and above two hundred miles from him, on the other
side the Oby; but that, if I consented, he would
send for him.
I made no hesitation, but told him I would do it:
I made some ceremony in letting him understand
that it was wholly on his account; and that seeing I
A a 2 could
could not prevail on him, I would shew my respect
to him by my concern for his son: but these things
are too tedious to repeat here. He sent away the
next day for his son, and in about twenty days he
came back with the messenger, bringing six or seven
horses loaded with very rich furs, and which, in the
whole, amounted to a very great value.
His servants brought the horses into the town,
but left the young lord at a distance till night, when
he came incognito into our apartment, and his
sather presented him to me; and, in short, we con-
certed there the manner of our travelling, and every
thing proper for the journey.
I had bought a considerable quantity of sables,
black fox-skins, fine ermins, and such other furs
that are very rich; I say, I had bought them in
that city for exchange for some of the goods brought
from China; in particular, for the cloves and nut-
megs, of which I sold the greatest part here; and
the rest afterwards at Arch-Angel, for a much better
price than I could have done it London; and my
partner, who was sensible of the profit, and whose
business, more particularly than mine, was merchan-
dize, was mightily pleased with our stay, on account
of the traffic we made here.
It was in the beginning of "June when I left this
remote place, a city, I believe, little heard of in the
world; and, indeed, it is so sar out of the road of
commerce, that I know not how it should be much
talked of. We were now come to a very small cara-
van, being only thirty-two horses and camels in all,
and all of them passed for mine, though my new
guest was proprietor of eleven of them. It was most
natural
natural also, that I should take more servants with
me than I had before, and the young lord passed for
my steward; what great man I passed for mysels I
know not, neither did it concern me to enquire.
We had here the worst and the largest desart to pass
over that we met with in all the journey; indeed I
call it the worst, because the way was very deep in
some places, and very uneven in others; the best we
had to say for it, was, that we thought we had no
troops of Tartars and robbers to fear, and that they
never came on this side the river Oby, or at least but
very seldom; but we found it otherwise.
My young lord had with him a saithful Muscovite
servant, or rather a Siberian servant, who was per-
fectly acquainted with the country; and who led us
by private roads, that we avoided coming into the
principal towns and cities upon the great road, such
as Tumen, Soloy Kamaskoy, and several others; be-
cause the Muscovite garrisons,which are kept there,are
very curious and strict in their observation upon tra-
vellers, and searching lest any of the banished persons
of note should make their escape that way into Mus-
covy.; but by this means, as we were kept out of the
cities, so our whole journey was a desart, and we
were obliged to encamp and lie in our tents, when
we might have had good accommodation in the cities
on the way: this the young lord was so sensible of,
that he would not allow us to lie abroad, when we
came to several cities on the way; but lay abroad
himself, with his servant, in the woods, and met us
always at the appointed places.
We were just entered Europe, having passed the
river Kama, which, in these parts, is the boundary
A a 3 between
between Europe and Asia; and the first city on the
European side was called Soloy Kamofkoy, which is as
much as to say, the great city on the river Kama;
and here we thought to have seen some evident alte-
ration in the people, their manners, their habit,
their religion, and their business; but we were mis-
taken; for as we had a vast desart to pass, which,
by relation, is near seven hundred miles long in some
places, but not above two hundred miles over where
we passed it; so, till we came past that horrible
place, we found very little difference between that
country, and the Mogul Tartary; the people mostly
Pagans, and little better than the savages of America;
their houses and towns full of idols, and their way
of living wholly barbarous, except in the cities as
above, and the villages near them; where they
are Christians, as they call themselves, of the Greek
church; but even these have their religion mingled
with so many reliques of superstition, that it is scarce
to be known in some places from mere sorcery and
witchcraft.
In passing this forest, I thought, indeed, we must,
after all our dangers were, in our imagination, esca-
ped, as before, have been plundered and robbed,
and perhaps murdered by a troop of thieves; of what
country they were, whether the roving bands of the
Ojiiachi, a kind of Tartars, or wild people on the
banks of the Oby, had ranged thus far; or whether
they were the sable-hunters of Siberia, I am yet at a
loss to know; but they were all on horseback,
carried bows and arrows, and were at first about
five-and-forty in number; they came so near to
2 us
us as within about two musquet shot; and, asking
no questions, they surrounded us with their horse,
and looked very earnestly upon us twice; at length
they placed themselves just in our way; upon which
we drew up in a little line before our camels, being
not above sixteen men in all; and being drawn up
thus, we halted, and sent out the Siberian servant
who attended his lord, to fee who they were; his
master was the more willing to let him go, because
he was not a little apprehensive that they were a
Siberian troop sent out after him. The man came
up near them with a flag of truce, and called to
them; but though he spoke several of their languages,
or dialects of languages rather, he could not under-
stand a word they said: however, after some signs
to him not to come nearer to them at his peril, so
he said he understood them to mean, osfering to
shoot at him if he advanced, the fellow came back
no wiser than he went, only that by their dress,
he said, he. believed them to be some Tartars os
Kalmuck, or of the Circajstan hords; and that there
must be more of them on the great desart, though
he never heard that ever any of them were seen so
sar north before.
This was small comfort to us; however, we
had no remedy: there was on our left hand, at
about a quarter of a mile's distance, a little grove
or clump of trees, which stood close together, and
very near the road; I immediately resolved we
would advance to those trees, and fortify ourselves
as well as we could there; for, first, I considered
that the trees would in a great measure cover us from
their "arrows; and in the next place, they could not
A a 4 come
come to charge us in a body: it was, indeed, my
old Portuguese pilot who proposed it; and who had
this excellency attending him, namely, that he was
always readiest and most apt to direct and encourage
us in cases of the most danger. We advanced im-
mediately with what speed we could, and gained
that little wood, the Tartars, or thieves, for we
knew not what to call them, keeping their stand,
and not attempting to hinder us. When we came
thither, we found, to our great satissaction, that it
was a swampy, springy piece of ground, and, on
the other side, a great spring of water, which,
running out in a little rill or brook, was a little sar-
ther joined by another of the like bigness; and was,
in short, the head, or source of a considerable river,
called afterwards the Wirtska. The trees which grew
about this spring, were not in all above two hundred,
but were very large, and stood pretty thick; so that
as soon as we got in, we saw ourselves perfectly safe
from the enemy, unless they alighted-and attacked
us on foot.
But to make this more difficult, our Portuguese^
with indesatigable application, cut dowslgreat arms
of the trees, and laid them hanging, not cut quite
off, srom one tree to another; so that he made a con-
tinued fence almost round us.
We staid here, waiting the motion of the enemy
some hours, without perceiving they made any offer
to stir; when about two hours before night, they
came down directly upon us; and, though we had
not perceived it, we found they had been joined by
some more of the same, so that they were near four*
score
361
fcore horse, whereof, however, we sancied some were
women. They came in till they were within half a
shot of our little wood, when we fired one musquet
without ball, and called to them in the Ruffian tongue,
to know what they wanted, and bid them keep osf;
but, as if they knew nothing of what we said, they
came on with a double fury directly up to the wood-
side, not imagining we were so barricaded, that they
could not break in: our old pilot was our captain,
as well as he had been our engineer; and defired
of us, not to fire upon them till they came within
pistol shot, that we might be sure to kill; and that
when we did fire, we mould be sure to take good
aim. We bade him give the word of command;
which he delayed so long, that they were, some of
them, within two pikes length of us when we fired.
We aimed so true (or Providence directed our
shot so sure) that we killed fourteen of them at the
first volley, and wounded several others, as also
several of their horses; for we had all of us loaded our
pieces with two or three bullets a piece, at least.
They were terribly surprised with our fire, and
retreated immediately about one hundred rods from
us; in which time we loaded our pieces again, and,
seeing them keep that distance, we sallied out, and
caught four or five of their horses, whose riders,
we supposed, were killed; and coming up to the
dead, we could easily perceive they were Tartars,
but knew not from what country, or how they came
to make an excursion such an unusual length.
About an hour after, they made a motion to at-
tack us again, and rode round our little wood, to
see where else they might break in; but finding us
always
always ready to sace them, they went off again,
and we resolved not to stir from the place for that
night.
We flept a little, you may be sure; but spent the
most part of the night in strengthening our situation,
and barricading the entrances into the wood; and,
keeping a strict: watch, we waited for day-light, and,
when it came, it gave us a very unwelcome disco-
very indeed: for the enemy, who we thought were
discouraged with the reception they had met with,
were now increased to no less than three hundred,
and had set up eleven or twelve huts and tents, as
if they were resolved to besiege us; and this little
camp they had pitched, was upon the open plain, at
about three quarters of a mile from us. We were in-
deed surprized at this discovery; and now, I confess, I
gave myself over for lost, and all that I had. The
loss of my effects did not lie so near me (though
they were very considerable) as the thoughts of
falling into the hands of such barbarians, at the
latter end of my journey, after so many difficulties
and hazards as I had gone through; and even in
sight of our port, where we expected safety and de-
liverance. As for my partner, he was raging: he
declared, that to lose his goods would be his ruin;
and he would rather die than be starved; and he
was for fighting to the last drop.
The young lord, as gallant as ever flesh shewed
itself, was for fighting to the 'aft also; and my old
pilot was of the opinion we were able to resist them
all, in the situation we then were in: and thus we
spent the day in debates of what we should do;
but towards evening, we found that the number of
our
our enemies still increased: perhaps, as they were
abroad in several parties for prey, the first had sent
out scouts to call for help, and to acquaint them of
their booty; and we did not know but by the morn-
ing they might still be a greater number; so I
began to enquire of those people we had brought
from Tobol/ki, if there was no other, or more pri-
vate ways, by which we might avoid them in the
night, and perhaps, either retreat to some town, or
get help to guard us over the desart.
The Siberian, who was servant to the young lord,
old us, if we designed to avoid them, and not fight,
he would engage to carry us off in the night to a
way that went north towards the river Petraz, by
which he made no doubt but we might get away,
and the Tartars never the wiser; but he said, his lord
had told him he would not return, but would rather
chuse to fight. I told him, he mistook his lord;
for that he was too wife a man to love sighting for
the sake of it that I knew his lord was brave enough
by what he had shewed already; but that his lord
knew better than to defire to have seventeen or
eighteen men fight five hundred, unless an unavoida-
ble necessity forced them to it; and that if he thought
it possible for us to escape in the night, we had no-
thing else to do but to attempt it. He answered, if
his lord gave him such order, he would lose his life
if he did not perform it. We soon brought his lord
to give that order, though privately, and we imme-
diately prepared for the putting it in practice.
And first, as soon as it began to be dark, we
kindled a fire in our little camp, which we kept
burning,
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
burning, and prepared so as to make it burn all
night, that the Tartars might conclude we were still
there; but, as soon as it was dark, that is to say,
so as we could fee the stars, (for our guide would
not stir before) having all our horses and camels
ready loaded, we followed our new guide, who, I
soon found, steered himself by the pole, or north
star, all the country being level for a long way.
After we had travelled two hours very hard, it
began to be lighter still; not that it was quite dark
all night, but the moon began to rile, so that, iai
short, it was rather lighter than we wished it to be;
but by six o'clock next morning, we were gotten
near forty miles, though the truth is, we almost
spoiled our horses. Here we found a Rujfian village,
named Kirmazinskoy, where we rested, and heard
nothing of the Calmuck Tartars that day. About
two hours before night we set out again, and tra-
velled till eight the next morning, though not quite
so hastily as before; and about seven o'clock we
passed.a little river, called Kir/za, and came to a good
large town inhabited by Rufftans, and very popu-
lous, called Ozomys: There we heard, that several
troops, or herds of Calmucks had been abroad upon
the delart, but that we were now completely out of
danger of them, which was to our great satisfaction^
you may be sure. Here we were obliged to get some
fresh horses, and having need enough of rest, we
staid five days; and my partner and I agreed to give
the honest Siberian, who brought us hither, the va-
lue of ten pistoles for his conducting us.
In five days more we came to Vcujfima, upon the
river Witzogda, which running into the river Dwina,
we
365
we were there very happily near the end of our tra-
vels by land, that river being navigable in seven
days passage to Arch-Angel: from hence we came to
Lawrenstov, where the river joins, the third of July;
and provided ourselves with two luggage-boats, and
a barge, for our convenience. We embarked the se-
venth, and arrived all safe at Arch-Angel the eigh-
teenth, having been a year, five months, and three
•days on the journey, including our stay of eight
months and odd days at Tobolski.
We were obliged to stay at this place six weeks for
the arrival of the ships, and must have tarried longer,
had not a Hamburther come in above a month sooner
than any of the English ships; when, after some con-

to be as good a market for our goods as London, we
all took freight with him; and having put our goods
on board, it was most natural for me to put my
steward on board to take care of them; by which
means my young lord had a sufficient opportunity to
conceal himself, never coming on shore again in
all the time we staid there; and this he did, that he
might not be seen in the city, where some of the
Moscow merchants would certainly have seen and
discovered him.
We sailed from Arch-Angel the twentieth of Au-
gust the same year; and, after no extraordinary bad
voyage, arrived in the Elbe the thirteenth of Sep-
tember: here my partner and I found a very good
sale for our goods, as well those of China, as the
sables, &c. of Siberia; and dividing the produce of
our effects, my share amounted to 3475I. 17s. 3d.

Here the young lord took his leave of us, and
went up the Elbe, in order to go to the court of
Vienna, where he resolved to seek protection, and
where he could correspond with those of his sather's
friends who were left alive. He did not part with-
out all the testimonies he could give, of grati-
tude for the service I had done him, and his fense
of my kindness to the prince his sather.
To conclude: having staid near four months in
Hamburgh, I came from thence over land to the
Hague, where I embarked in the packet, and arrived
in London the 10th of January, 1705, having been
gone from England ten years and nine months.

HT^HE ensuing Life was written for
-*- amusement, during a period of conva-
lescence in 1785; and published anonymously
by Stockdale, before The History of the Union,
in 1786. As the Author fears no reproach
for such amusement, during such a period, he
made no strong objections to Stockxkle's soli-
citations, that it might be annexed, with the
Author's name, to this splendid edition of
Robinson Crusoe. The Reader will now
have the benefit of a few corrections, with
some additions, and a List of De Foe's

i
LIFE of DE FOE.'
IT is lamented by those who labour the fields of
British biography, that after being entangled in
briars they are often rewarded with the scanty pro-
ducts of barrenness. The lives of literary men are
generally passed in the obscurities of the closet,
which conceal even from friendly inquiries the arti-
fices of study, whereby each may have risen to emi-
nence. And during the same moment that the dili-
gent biographer sets out to ask for information, with
regard to the origin, the modes of life, or the vari-
ous fortunes of writers who have amused or in-
structed their country, the house-keeper, the daugh-
ter, or grand-child, that knew connexions and tra-
ditions, drop into the grave.
These reflexions naturally arose from my inquiries
about the life of the Author of The History of
the Union of Great Britain; and of The
Adventures of Robinson Crusoe. Whether
he were born on the neighbouring continent, or in
this island; in London, or in the country; was
equally uncertain- And whether his name were
Foe, or De Foe, was somewhat doubtful. Like
B b 2 Swift,
37* THE LIFE OF DE FOEf
Swift, he had perhaps reasons for concealing what
would have added little to his consequence. It is
at length known, with sufficient certainty, that our
author was the son of James Foe, of the parish of
St. Giles's, Cripplegate, London, Citizen and But-,
cher. The concluding sentiment of The True-born
Englishman, we now see, was then as natural as it
will ever be just:
Then, let us boast of ancestors no more,
For, same of samilies is all a cheat;
'Tis personal virtue only makes us great.
If we may credit the Gazette, Daniel Foe, or De
Foe, as he is said by his enemies to have called
himself, that he might not be thought an EnglisiV
man, was born in London *, about the year 1663.
His samily were probably Dissenters f, among whom

* It is at last discovered, by searching The Chamberlain's books,
which have since been burnt, that our author was the son of James
Foe, of the parish of Cripplegate, London, Citizen and Butcher;
who was himself the son of Daniel Foe, of Elton, in the county
of Northampton, Yeoman ; and who obtained his Freedom by
serving his apprenticeship with John Levit, Citizen and Butcher.
Daniel Foe, the son of James, was admitted to hit Freedom by birth,
on the 26th of January, 1687-8. I was led to these discoveries
by observing that De Foe had voted at an election for a Repre-
sentative of London; whence I inferred, that he must have been
a citizen either by birth or service. But in the parish books I
could find no notice of his baptism; as his parents were Dis-
senters.
f In his Preface to " More Reformation," De Foe complains,
That some D'Aenters had reproached him, as if he had said,
"that the gallows and the gallies ought to be the penalty of go-
ing to the conventicle; forgetting, that I must design to have my
father, my wife, fix innocent children, and myself, put into the same
condition. To such Dissenters I can only regret," fays he, " That

he received no unlettered educationj at least it is
plain, from his various writings, that he was a
zealous defender of their principles, and a strenuous
supporter of their politics, before the liberality of
our rulers in church and state had freed this conduct
from danger* He merits the praise which is due
to sincerity in manner of thinking, and to unifor-
mity in habits of acting, whatever obloquy may have
been cast on his name, by attributing writings to
him, which, as they belonged to others, he was
studious to disavow.
Our Author was educated at a dissenting academy,
which was kept at Ne^ington-Green by Charles
Morton. He delights to praise " that learned gen-
tleman*," whose instructive lessons he probably en-
joyed from 1675 to 1680, as a master, who taught
nothing either in politics, or science, ahich was
dangerous to monarchial government, or which
was improper for a diligent scholar to know.
Being in 1705 accused by Tutchin of illiterature,
De Foe archly acknowledged, " I owe this justice
to my ancient sather, who is yet living, and in
whose behalf I freely testify, that if I am a blockhead,
it was nobody's sault but my own; he having
spared nothing that might qualify me to match
the accurate Dr. B or the most learned
Tutchinf."
when I had drawn the picture, I did not, like the Dutchman
with his man and bear, write under them—"This is the man; and
this it the hear." De Foe expressly admits, that he was a dis-
senter, though no independent, fifth-monarchy man, or leveller.

De Foe was born a writer, as other men are born
generals and statesmen: and when he was not twenty-
one, he published, in 1683, a pamphlet against a
very prevailing sentiment in savour of the Turks, as
opposed to the Austrians; very justly thinking, as
he avows in his riper age, that it was better the
Popish House of Austria should ruin the Protestants
in Hungary, than the insidel House of Ottoman
should ruin both Protestants and Papists, by over-
running Germany *. De Foe was a man who would
fight as well as write for his principles: and before
he was three-and-twenty he appeared in arms for
the Duke of'Monmouth, in June 1685. Of this
exploit he boasts .j. in his latter years, when it
was no longer dangerous to avow his participation
in that imprudent enterprise, with greater men of
similar principles.
Having escaped from the dangers of battle, and
from the sangs of Jefferys, De Foe found complete
security in the more gainful pursuits of peace. Yet,
he was prompted by his zeal to mingle in the con-
troversies of the reign of James 2d, whom he effi-
caciously opposed, by warning the Dissenters of the
secret danger of the insidious tolerance, which was
osfered by the monarch's bigotry, or by the minis-
ter's artifice. When our Author collected his writ-
ings, he did not think proper to republifii either his
tract against the Turks, or his pamphlet against the
Kin?.
O
De Foe was admitted a Liveryman of London
on the 26th of January, 1687—8; when, being al-
lowed his freedom by birth, he was received a mem-

ber
ber of that eminent corporation. As he had en-
deavoured to promote the revolution by his pen and
his sword, he had the satissaction of partaking,
ere long, in the pleasures and advantages of that great
event. During the hilarity of that moment, the Lord
Mayor of London asked King William to partake of
the city feast on the 29th of October, 1689. Every
honour was paid the Sovereign of the people's choice.
A regiment of volunteers, composed of the chief
citizens, and commanded by the celebrated Earl of
Peterborough, attended the King and Queen from
Whitehall to the Mansion House. Among these
troopers, gallantly mounted, and richly accoutred,
was Daniel De Foe, if we may believe Oldmixon *.
While our author thus displayed his zeal, and
courted notice, he is laid to have acted as a hosier
in Freeman's Yard, Cornhill: but the hosier f, and
the poet are very irreconcileable characters. With
the usual imprudence of superior genius, he was
carried by his vivacity into companies who were
gratified by his wit. He spent those hours with a
small society for the cultivation of polite learning,
which he ought to have employed in the calculations
of the counting-house: and being obliged to abscond
from his creditors in 1692, he naturally attri-
* Hist. vol. ii. p. 37.
t Being reproached by Tutchin in his Observator with having
been bred an apprentice to a hosier, De Foe asserts, in May 1705,
that he never ivas a hosier, or an apprentice, but admits that he
had been a Trader. [Review, vol. ii. p. 149.] Oldmixon, who
never speaks favourably of De Foe, allows that he had never been
a merchant otherwise than peddling a little to Portugal. Hist,
vol. ii. p. 519.—But, Peddling to Portugal makes a Trader.

buted those misfortunes to the war, which were pro-
bably owing to his own misconduct. An angry
creditor took out a commission of bankruptcy,
which was soon superseded on the petition of those
to whom he was most indebted, who accepted a
composition on his single bond. This he punctu-
ally paid by the efforts of unwearied diligence.
But some of those creditors, who had been thus
satisfied, salling afterwards into distress themselves,
De Foe voluntarily paid them their whole claims;
being then in riling circumstances from King Wil-
liam's savour *. This is such an example of ho-
nesty, as it would be unjust to De Foe and to the
world to conceal. Being reproached in 1705 by
Lord Haverfiiam with mercenariness, our" author
feelingly mentions; " How, with a numerous sa-
mily, and no helps but his own industry, he had
forced his way with undiscouraged diligence, through
a sea of misfortunes, and reduced his debts, ex-
clusive of composition, from seventeen thousand to
less than five thousand pounds f." He continued
to carry on the pan-tile works near Tilbury-fort;
though probably with no great success. It was af-
terwards sarcastically said, that he did not, like the
Egyptians, require bricks without Jlraw, but, like the
yen's, required bricks without paying his labourers.
He was born for other enterprises, which, if they
did not gain him opulence, have conferred a renown,
that will descend the stream of time with the lan-
guage wherein his works are written.
While he was yet under thirty, and had mortified
no great man by his satire, or offended any party

Vindication.
by
by his pamphlets, he had acquired friends by his
powers of pleasing, who did not, with the usual in-
stability of friendships, desert him amidst his distres-
ses. They offered to settle him as a sactor at Cadiz,
where, as a trader, he had some previous correspond-
ence. In this situation he might have procured bu-
siness by his care, and accumulated wealth without
a risque: but, as he assures us in his old age, Pro-
vidence, which had other work for him to do, placed
a secret aversion in his mind to quitting England. He
had confidence enough in his own talents to think,
that on this field he could gather laurels, or at least
gain a livelihood.
In a projecling age, as our Author denominates
King William's reign, he was himself a projector.
While he was yet young, De Foe was prompted by
a vigorous mind to think of many schemes, and to
offer, what was most pleasing to the ruling powers,
ways and means for carrying on the war. He wrote,
as he says, many shects about the coin; he proposed
a register for seamen, long before the acl of Parlia-
ment ivas thought of; he projected county banks and
faflorics for goods; he mentioned a proposal for a
commission of inquiries into bankrupt's estates; he con-
trived a pension-office for the relief of the poor. At
length, in January 1696—7, he published his Essay
upon Projecls; which he dedicated to Dalby Tho-
mas, not as a Commissioner of glass duties, under
whom he then served, or as a friend, to whom he
acknowledges obligations; but as to the most pro-
per judge on the subject. It is always curious to
trace a thought, in order to fee where it first origi-
nated, or how it was afterwards expanded. Among
other projects, which shew a wide range of know-
ledge,
THE LITE OF DE FOE.
ledge, he suggests to King William the imitation of
Lewis 14th, in the establishment of a society " for
encouraging polite learning, for refining the Eng-
lish language, and for preventing barbarisms of
manners." Prior offered in 1700 the same project
to King William^ in his Carmen Seculare; Swift
mentioned in 1710 to Lord Oxford a proposal for
improving the English tongue; and Tickell flatters
himself in his Prospccl of Peace, that our daring lan-
guage—-shall sport no more in arbitrary found. How-
ever his projects were taken, certain it is, 'that when
De Foe ceased to be a trader, he was, by the inter-
position of Dalby Thomas probably, appointed in
1695, accomptant to the Commissioners for manag-
ing the duties on glass; who, with our Author
ceased to act, on the first of August, 1699, when
the tax was suppressed by act of Parliament *.
From projects of ways and-uieans, De Foe's ar-
dour soon carried him into the thorny paths of sa-
tiric poetry; and his muse produced, in January
1700—1, The True-born Englishman. Of the origin
of this satire, which was the cause of much good for-
tune, but of some disasters, he gives himself the fol-
lowing account:-—" During this time came out
an abhorred pamphlet, in very ill verse, written
by one Mr. Tutchin, and called The Foreigners: in
which the Author, who he was I then knew not,
fell personally upon the King, then upon the Dutch
nation, and, after having reproached his Majesty
with crimes that his worst enemies could not think
of without horror, he sums up all in the odious
name of Foreigner. This filled me with a kind
of rage against the book, and gave birth to a trifle,
* io-ii Wm.III. ch. 18.
which
379
which I never could hope should have met with so
general an acceptation." The sale was prodigious,
and probably unexampled; as Sacheverel's trial had
not then appeared. The True-born Engliflman was
answered, paragraph by paragraph, in February
1700—1, by a writer, who brings hade to apo-
logize for dulness. For this Defence of King
William and the Dutch, which was doubtless circu-
lated by detraction and by power, De Foe was
amply rewarded. "How this poem was the occa-
sion," says he, " of my being known to his Ma-
jesty; how I was afterwards received by him; how
employed abroad; and how, above my capacity of
deserving, rewarded, is no part of the present case."
Of the particulars, which the Author thus declined
to tell, nothing now can be told. It is only certain,
that he was admitted to personal interviews with the
King, who was no reader of poetry; and that for
the Royal savours De Foe was always grateful.
When " the pen and ink war was raised against
a standing army," subsequent to the peace of Rys-
wick, our Author published An Argument, to
prove that a standing army, with consent of Parlia-
ment, is not inconsistent with a free government.
"Liberty and property," says he, " are the glo-
rious attributes of the English nation; and the
dearer they are to us, the less danger we are in of
losing them: but I could never yet see it proved,
that the danger of losing them by a small army was
such, as we should expose ourselves to all the world
for it. It is not the King of England alone, but
the sword of England in the hand of the King, that
gives laws of peace and war now to Europe: and
those who would thus wrest the sword out of
his hand in time of peace, bid the sairest of all men
in
1
in the world to renew the war." He, who is de-
sirous of reading this treatise on an interesting topic,
will meet with strength of argument, conveyed in
elegant language.
When the nation flamed with saction, the Grand
Jury of Kent presented to the Commons, on the 8th
of May 1701, a petition, which desired them—
a to mind the public business more, and their pri-
vate heats lessand which contained a sentiment,
that there was a design, as Burnet tells, other coun-
ties and the city of London should equally adopt.
Messrs. Culpeppers, Polhill, Hamilton, and Champ-
neys, who avowed this intrepid paper, were com-
mitted to the Gatehouse, amid the applauses of their
countrymen. It was on this occasion that De
Foe's genius dictated a Remonstrance, which was
signed Legion, and which has been recorded in his-
tory for its bold truths and seditious petulance. De
Foe's zeal induced him to assume a woman's dress,
while he delivered this sactious paper to Harley,
the Speaker, as he entered the House of Commons*.
It was then also that our Author, who was transported
by an equal attachment to the country and the
• Mr. Polhill, of Cheapstcad-place, in Kent, whose father,
Mr. David Polhill, was committed to the Gatehouse, and thereby
gained great popularity, was so good as communicate to me
the curious anecdote of De Foe's dressing himself in women's
clothes, and presenting the Legion Paper to the Speaker. De
Foe says himself in his Original Power os the People, p. 24:
"This is evident from the tenor and yet undiscovered original
of the Legion Paper; the contents of which had so nrtch plain
truth of sect; and which I could give a belter hislory of, if it were
needful" When De Foe republimed his works in 1703, he
thought it prudent to expunge this passage, that too plainly
pointed out the real history of the Legion Paper, which is not men-
tioned by the Commons Journals. \
court,
court, published The Original Power of the eolleclive
Body of the People of England, examined and asserted.
This timeful treatise he dedicated to King William,
in a dignified strain of nervous eloquence. *' It is
not the least of the extraordinaries of your Majesty's
character," says he, " that, as you are King of
your people, so you are the people's King; a title,
which, as it is the most glorious, so it is the most
indisputable." To the Lords and Commons he ad-
dresses himself in a similar tone: The vindication of
the original right of all men to the government of
themselves, he tells them, is so sar from being a de-
rogation from, that it is a confirmation of their legal
authority. Every lover of liberty must be pleased
with the perusal of a treatise, which vies with Mr.
Locke's samous tract in powers of reasoning, and is
superior to it in the graces of style.
At a time when *. union and charity, the one
relating to our civil, and the other to our religious
concerns, were strangers in the land," De Foe pub-
lished The Freeholder's Plea against Stockjobbing Elec
tions of Parliament Men. "It is very rational to
suppose," says our Author, "that they who will buy
will fell; or, what seems more rational, they who
have bought must fell" This is certainly a persuasive
performance, though we may suppose, that many
voters were influenced then by arguments still
more persuasive. And he concludes with a sentiment,
which has not been too often repeated, That nothing
can make us formidable to our neighbours, and
maintain the reputation of our nation, but union
.among ourselves.
How much soever King William may have been
pleased with The True-born Englishman, or with
other
other services, he was little gratified probably by our
Author's Reasons again/I a War with France. This
argument, shewing that the French King's owning the
Prince of Wales as King of England, is no sufficient
ground of a War, is one of the finest, because it is
one of the most useful, tracts in the English lan-
guage. After remarking the universal cry of the peo-
ple for war, our Author declares he is not against
war with France, provided it be on justifiable
grounds; but, he hopes, England will never be so
inconsiderable a nation, as to make use of dishonest
pretences to bring to pass any of her designs: and
he wishes that he who defires we should end the
war honourably, ought to defire also, that we begin it
fairly. "But if we must have a war," our Author
hoped, " it might be wholly on the defensive in
Flanders, in order to carry on hostilities in remote
places, where the damage may be greater, by wound-
ing the Spaniard in some weaker part; so as upon a
peace he shall be glad to quit Flanders for an equi-
valent." Who,at present does not wish that De
Foe's argument had been more studiously read, and
more efficaciously admitted?
A scene of sorrow soon after opened, which pro-
bably embittered our Author's future life. The
death of King William deprived him of a protector,
who, he says, trusted, esteemed, and much more
valued him than he deserved; and who, as he flattered
himself amidst his later distresses, would never have
suffered him to be treated as he had been in the
world. Of that monarch's memory, he says, that
he never patiently heard it abused, nor ever could
do so: and in this gratitude to a Royal benesactor
there is surely much to praise, but nothing to blame.
In
In the midst of that furious contest of party, civil
and religious, which ensued on the accession of
Queen Anne, our Author was no unconcerned
spectator. He reprinted his Enquiry into the Occa-
sional Conformity of Dissenters, which had been pub-
lished in 1697, with a dedication to Sir Humphrey
Edwin, a Lord Mayor, who having carried the
regalia to a conventicle, gave rife to some wit in
The Tale of a Tub, and occasioned some clauses in
an act of Parliament. De Foe now dedicated his
Enquiry to John How, a dissenting minister, of whom
Anthony Wood speaks well. Mr. How did not
much care, says Calamy *, to enter upon an argu-
ment of that nature with one of so warm a temper as
the author of that Enquiry, and contented himself
with publishing some Considerations on the Preface of
an Enquiry concerning the occasional Conformity of
Dissenters. De Foe's pertinacity soon produced a
reply. He out-laughs and out-talks Mr. How, who
had provoked his antagonist's wrath by.personal sar-
casms, and who now thought it hard that the old
should be shoved off the stage by the young. De
Foe reprobates, with the unforbearance of the
times, " this sast and loose game of religion ;" for
which he had never met with any considerable ex-
cuse but this, " that this is no conformity in point
of religion, but done as a civil action." He soon
after published another Enquiry, in order to shew,
that the Dissenters arc no ways concerned in occasional
conformity. The controversy, which in those days
occasioned such vehement contests between the two
Houses of Parliament, is probably silenced for ever.
* Life os Mr. John How, p. 210.
"During
THE LIFE OF DE FOE.
"During the sirst; fury of high-flying," says he,
"I fell a sacrifice for writing against the madness
of that high party, and in the service of the Dissen-
ters." He alludes here to The Shortest Way; which
he published towards the end of the year 1702; and
which is a piece of exquisite irony, though there
are certainly passages in it that might have shewn
considerate men how much the Author had been
in jest. He complains how hard it was, that this
Jkould not have been perceived by all the town, and that
not one man can see it, either churchman or dijenter.
This is one of the strongest proofs, how much the
minds of men were inflamed against each other,
and how little the virtues of mutual forbearance
and personal kindness existed amid the clamour of
contradiction, which then shook the kingdom, and
gave rise to some of the most remarkable events in
our annals. The Commons shewed their zeal, how.
ever they may have studied their dignity, by prose-
cuting * several libelists.
During the previous twenty years of his life, De
Foe had busied himself unconsciously in charging a
mine, which now blew himself and his samily into
air. He had fought for Monmouth; he had op-
posed King James; he had vindicated The Revolu-
tion; he had panegyrized King William; he had
defended the rights of the collective body of the

was at length obliged to seek for shelter from the
indignation of persons and parties, thus overpower-
ing and resistless.
A proclamation was issued in January, 1702—3 *,
offering a reward of fifty pounds for discovering
his retreat. De Foe was described by the Gazette—

ple are like to come under the displeasure of the Go-
vernment for it; in justice to those who are in dan-
ger to suffer by it; in submission to the Parliament
and Council who may be offended at it; and cour-
tesy to all mistaken people, who, it seems, have not
penetrated into the real design; the Author presents
the world with the genuine meaning of the paper,
which he hopes may allay the anger of Government,
or at least satisfy the minds of such as imagine a
design to inflame and divide us." Neither his fub-
missiveness to the ruling powers, nor his generosity
to his printers, was a susficient shield from the re-
sentment of his enemies. He was found guilty of a
libel, sentenced to the pillory, and adjudged to be
fined and imprisoned. Thus, as he acknowledges,
was he a second time ruined; and by this affair, as
he asserts, he lost above £3,500 sterling, which
consisted probably in his brick works and in the more
abundant product of his pen.
When, by these means, immured in Newgate, our
Author consoled himself with the animating reflec-
tion, that having meant well he unjustly susfered.
He had a mind too active to be idle in the solitude
of a prison which is seldom invaded by visitors.
.And he wrote a hymn to the pillory, that—
Hieroglyphick state machin,
Contrived to punish sancy in.
In this ode the reader will find satire, pointed by
his sufferings; generous sentiments, arising from his
situation; and an unexpected flow of easy verse.
For example:
The
The first intent of laws
Was to correct the effect, and check the cause.
And all the ends of punishment
"Were only future mischiefs to prevent:
But justice is inverted, when
Those engines of the law,
Instead of pinching vicious men,
Keep honest ones in awe.
He employed this involuntary leisure in correcting
for the press a collection of his writings, which,
with several things he had no hand in, had been al-
ready published by a piratical printer. He thought
it a most unaccountable boldness in him to print
that particular book called The Shortest Way with the
Dijfcnters, while he lay under the public resentment
for the same sact. In this collection of 1703, there
are one-and-twenty treatises in poetry and prose,
beginning with The True-born Englishman, and end-
ing with The Shortest Way to Peace and Union. To
this volume there was prefixed the first print of De
Foe; to which was afterwards added, the apt in-
scription: Laudatur et alget.
In the solitariness of a goal, the energy of De Foe
projected The Review. This is a periodical paper
in quarto, which was first published on the 19th of
February, 1703—4; and which was intended to
treat of news, foreign and domestic; of politics,
British and European; of trade, particular and uni-
versal. But our Author foresaw, from the natural
aver/ion of the age to any tedious affair, that however
profitable, the world would never read, if it were
not diverting. With this design, both instructive
and amusing, he skilfully institutes a Scandal Club,
C c 2 which

which discusses questions in divinity, morals, war,
trade, language, poetry, love, marriage, drunken-
ness, and gaming. Thus, it is easy to see, that
The Review pointed the way to the Tatlers, Spec-
tators, and Guardians, which may be allowed how-
ever to have treated those interesting topics with
more delicacy of humour, more terseness of style^
and greater depth of learning: yet, has De Foe
• many passages, both of prose and poetry, which, for
refinement of wit, neatness of expression, and effi-
cacy of moral, would do honour to Steele or to
Addifon. Of all this was Johnson unconscious, when
he speaks of the Tatlers and Spectators as the first
English writers who had undertaken to reform either
the savageness of neglect, or the impertinence of
civility; to shew when to speak, or to be silent; how
to refuse, or how to comply.
In the midst of these labours our Author publish-
ed, in July 1704, The Storm; or, a collection of
the most remarkable casualties, which happened in
the tempest, on the 23d of November, 1703. In
explaining the natural causes of winds De Foe shews
more science, and in delivering the opinions of the an-
cients that this island was moresubjccl to forms than
other parts of the worlds he displays more literature,
than he has been generally supposed to possess.
Our Author is moreover entitled to yet higher
praise. He seized that awful occasion to inculcate
the fundamental truths of religion; the being of a
God, the superintendency of Providence, the cer-
tainty of heaven and hell, the one to reward, the
other to punish.
While, *as he tells himself, he lay friendless
in the prison of Newgate, his samily ruined, and
himself
3^9
himself without hopes of deliverance, a message was
brought him from a person of honour, whom till
that time be had not the least knowledge of. This
was no less a person than Sir Robert Harley, the
Speaker of the House of Commons. Harley ap-
proved probably of the principles and conduct of
De Foe, and doubtless foresaw, that, during a sac-
tious age, such a genius could be converted to many
uses. And he sent a verbal message to the prisoner,
desiring to ktiozv what he could do for him. Our Au-
thor readily wrote the story of the blind man in the
Gospel; concluding—Lord, that I may receive my
sight.
When the high-flyers were driven from the station
which enabled them to inflame rather than conciliate,
Harley became Secretary of State, in April 1704.
He had now frequent opportunities of representing
the unmerited sufferings of De Foe to the £>ueen and
to the Treasurer; yet, our Author continued four
months longer in goal. The Queen, however, in.
quired into his circumstances; and Lord Godol-
phin sent, as he thankfully acknowledges, a consi-
derable sum to his wife, and to him money to pay
his fine and the expence of his discharge. Here is
the foundation, says he, on which he built his first
sense of duty to the Queen, and the indelible bond of
gratitude to his first benefaclor. "Let any one say,
then," he asks, " what I could have done, less or
more than I have done for such a Queen and such a
benesactor?" All this he manfully avowed to the
world *, when Queen Anne lay lifeless and cold as
King William, his first patron; and when Oxford,
* By his Appeal ia 171 j. ,
C.c3' in
in the vicissitude of party, had been persecuted by
saction, and overpowered, though not conquered,
by violence.
Such was the high interposition by which De Foe
was relieved from Newgate, in August 1704. In
order to avoid the town-talk, he retired immediately
to St. Edmund's Bury: but his retreat did not pre-
vent persecution. Dyer, the news-writer, propa-
gated that De Foe had fled from justice. Fox, the
bookseller, published that he had deserted his
security. Stephen, a state-messenger, every where
said, that he had a warrant for seizing him.
This I suppose was wit, during the witty age of
Anne. In our duller days of law, such out-
rages would be referred to the judgment of a Jury.
De Foe informed the Secretary of State where he
was, and w hen he v\ ould appear; but he was told
not to fear, as he had not transgressed. Notwithstand-
ing this vexation, our Author's muse produced, on
the 29th of August 1704, A Hymn to Viclory, when
the successful skill of Marlborough furnished our
poets with many occasions to publish Gazettes in
Rhyme.
De Foe opened the year 1704—5 with his Double
.welcome to the Duke of Marlborough; disclaiming any
expectation of place or pension. 11 is encomiastic
strains, I fear, were not heard while he wrote,
like an honest Englishman, against the continuance
of the war—a war indeed of personal glory, of na-
tional celebration, but of fruitless expence. De
Foe's activity, or his needs, produced in March
1705, The Confolidator; or, Memoirs of Sundry
Transactions, from the world in the moon. It was
one of De Foe's felicities to catch the living manners
2 aj
as they rose, or one of his resources, to Jhootfolly as it
fiew. In the lunar language he applies his satiric
file to the prominences of every character: of the
poets, from Dryden to Durfy; of the wits, from Ad-
dison to Prior; of the metaphysicians, from Mal-
branche to Hobbs; of the free-thinkers, from Asgyl
to the Tale of a Tub. Our author continually com-
plains of the ill usage of the world; but with all his
acuteness he did not advert, thdt he who attacks the
world, will be by the world attacked. He makes the
lunar politicians debate the policy of Charles XII. in
pursuing the Saxons and Poles, while the Musco-
vites ravaged his own people. I doubt whether it
were on this occasion that the Swedish Ambassador
was so ill-advised as to complain against De Foe, for
merited ridicule of a futile warsare. They had not
then discovered, that the best defence against the;
shafts of satire is to let them fly. Our Author's sen-
timent was expanded by Johnson, in those energetic
lines, which thus conclude the character of the
Swedish Charles;
"Who left the name, at which the world grew pale,
"To point a moral, or adorn a tale."
De Foe was so little disturbed by the appearance
of The Moon Calf, or accurate reflections on the
Consolidator, that he plunged into a controversy with
Sir Humphrey Mackworth about his bill for employ-
ing the poor. This had been passed by the Com-
mons, with great applause, but received by the
Peers with suitable caution. De Foe, considering
this plausible project as an indigested chaos, represented
it, through several reviews, as a plan which would
C c 4 ruin

ruin the industrious, and thereby augment the poor.
Sir Humphrey endeavoured to support his work-
houses, in every parish, with a parochial capital
for carrying on parochial manusacture. This drew
from De Foe his admirable treatise, which he en-
titled Giving alms no charity. As an English Free-
holder he claimed it as a right to address his per-
formance to the House of Commons, having a par-
ticular interest in the common good; but, consider-
ing the persons before whom he appeared, he laid
down his" archness, and assumed his dignity. He
maintained, with wonderful knowledge of sact and
power of argument, the following positions: ist, That
there is inEnglandmore labour than hands to perform
it; and consequently a want of people, not of em-
ployment : — 2dly, No man in England, of sound
limbs and senses, can be poor merely for want of
work:—3dly, All workhouses for employing the
poor, as now they are employed, serve to the ruin
of samilies and the increase of the poor :— 4thly,
It is a regulation of the poor that is wanted, not a
setting them to work. Longer experience shews
this to be a difficult subject, which increases in dif-
ficulty with the esiluxion of time.
De Foe had scarcely dismissed Sir Humphrey,
when he introduced Lord Haversham, a peer, who
is samous in our story, as a maker and publisher of
speeches. His Lordfnip published his speech on the
state of^the nation in 1705, which was cried about
the town with unusual earnestness. Our Author's
prudence induced him to give no answer to the
speech; but a pamphlet, which was hawked about
the streets and fold for a penny, our Author's
shrewdness considered as a challenge to every reader*
He
393
He laughed and talked so much, through several Re-
views, about this sactious esfusion, as to provoke a
defence of topics, which his Lordship ought neither
to have printed nor spoken. Be Foe now published
a Reply to Lord Haversham's vindication of bis Speech.
During such battles the town never saite to cheer the
smaller combatant. Our Author, with an allusion
to the biography of both, says sarcastically: "But,
sate that makes footballs of men, kicks some up
stairs, and some down; some are advanced without
honour, others suppressed without infamy; some are
raised without merit, some are crushed without a crime;
and no man knows by the beginning of things, whe-
ther his course shall issue in a peerage or a pillory."
In the midst of these disputes, either grave or lu-
dicrous, De Foe published Advice to all Parties. He
strenuously recommends that moderation and for-
bearance, which his opponents often remarked he
was not so prone to practice as to preach. While
he thus gave advice to all parties, he conveyed many
salutary lessons to the Dissenters, whom he was
zealous to defend. In the Review, dated the 25th
of December 1705, he conjures them for God's
sake, if not for their own sake, to be content. "Are
there a few things more you could wish were done
for you? resolve these wishes into two conclusions:
1st, Wait till Providence, if it shall be for your
good, shall bring them to pass; 2dly, Compare the
present with the past circumstances, and you can-
not repine without the highest ingratitude both to
God and man."
De Foe found leisure, notwithstanding all those
labours, perhaps a necessity, to publish in 1705, A
Second Volume of the Writings of the Author of the True.

born Englishman. The same reasons which formerly-
induced him to collec l some loose pieces, held good,
says he, for proceeding to a second volume, " that
if I do not, somebody else will do it for me." He
laments the scandalous liberty of the press; whereby.
piratic printers deprive an author of the native pro-
duct of his own thought, and the purity of his own
style. It is said, though perhaps without authority,
that the vigorous remonstrances of De Foe procured
The* Aclfor the encouragement of learning, by vesting
the copies of printed books in the authors or their assigns.
The vanity of an administration, which affected
to patronize the learned, concurring with the mu.
tual interest of bookmakers and booksellers, pro-
duced this salutary law, that our Author alone had
called for without success. De Foe's writings, thus
collected into volumes, were soon a third time
printed, with the addition of a key. The satire be-
ing now pointed by the specification of characters,
and obscurities being illuminated by the annexation
of circumstances, a numerous class of readers were
induced, by their zeal of party, or defire of scan-
dal, to look for gratification from our Author's
treatises. He is studious to complain, That his writ-
ings had been most neglccled of them, who at the same
time have owned them useful. The second volume of
1705, containing eighteen treatises in prose and
rhyme, begins with A new Discovery of an old In-
trigue, and ends with Royal Religion.
The year 1705 was a year of disquiet to De Foe,
not so much from the oppressions of state as from
the persecutions of party. When his business, of
* 9 Anne, c. 19,
whatever
whatever nature, led him to Exeter, and other west-
ern .towns, in August, September, and October,
1705, a project was formed to fend him as a soldier
to the army, at a time w hen footmen were taken
from the coaches as recruits: but conscious of his
being a Freeholder of England, and a Liveryman of
London, he knew that such characters could not be
violated, in this nation, with impunity. When some
of the Western Justices, of more zeal of party than
fense of duty, heard from his opponents of De Foe's
journey, they determined to apprehend him as a
vagabond: but our Author, who, among other qua-
lities, had pers>nal courage in a high degree, reflected,
that to sace danger is most effectually to prevent it.
In his absence, real suits were commenced against
him for sictitious debts: but De Foe advertised, that
genuine claims he would sairly satisfy. If all these
uncommon circumstances had not been published
in The Review, we should not have seen this striking
picture of savage manners. So much more free ave
we at present, that the Editor of a newspaper, how-
ever obnoxious to any party, may travel peaceably
about his affairs over England, without fear of in-
terruption. Were a Justice of Peace, from what-
ever motive, to offer him any obstruction, such a
magistrate would be overwhelmed by the public in-
dignation, and punished by the higher guardians of
our quiet and our laws.
De Foe began the year 1706 with A Hymn to
Peace *; occasioned by the two Houses of Parlia-
ment joining in one address to the Queen. On
»he 4th of May he published An EJsay at removing

A few weeks after he gave the world a second essay,
to soften rancour and defeat perversity. But the
time was now come, when he was to perform what
he had often promised: and his fruitfulness produced
in July 1706, Jure Divino, a satire against tyranny
"and passive obedience, which had been delayed, for
fear, as he declares, of parliamentary censure. Of
this poem, it cannot be said, as of Thomson's Li-
berty, that // was written to prove what no man ever
denied. This satire, says the presace, had never
been published, though some of it has been a long
time in being, had not the world seemed to be go-
ing mad a second time with the error of passive obedi-
ence, and non-rejislance. And because some men
require, says he, more explicit answers, I declare
my belief, that a monarchy, according to the pre-
sent constitution, limited by Parliament, and depend-
ent upon law, is not only the best government in thœ
world, but also the best for this nation in par-
ticular, most suitable to the genius of the people,
and the circumstances of the whole body. Drvden
had given an example, a few years before, of ar-
gumentative poetry in his Hind and Panther;
by which he endeavoured to defend the tenets of the
Church of Rome. Our author now reasoned in
rhyme, through twelve books, in defence of every
man's birth-right by nature, when all sorts of liberty
were run down and opposed. His purpose is doubt-
less honester than Dryden's; and his argument, be-
ing in support of the better cause, is perhaps superior
in strength: but in the Jure Divine we look in
vain for
The varying verse, the full-resounding line,
The Jong majestic march, and energy divine.
Our
Our author was soon after engaged in more im-
portant, because much more useful, business. Lord
Godolphin, who knew how to discriminate charac-
ters, determined to employ him on an errand,
which, as he says, was sar from being unfit for a
Sovereign to direct, or an honest man to perform.
By his Lordship he was carried to the Queen, who
said to him, while he kissed her hand*, that she had
such satisfaction in his former services, that she had
again appointed him for another affair, which was
something nice, but the treasurer would tell him the
reft. In three days he was sent to Scotland. His
knowledge of commerce and revenue, his powers of
insinuation, and above all his readiness of pen, were
deemed of no small utility in promoting the Union.
He arrived at Edinburgh, in October 1706. And
we shall find him no inconsiderable actor in the
performance of that greatest of all good works. He
attended the committees of Parliament, for whose
use he made several of the calculations f on the sub-
ject of trade and taxes. He complains \, however,
that when afterwards some clamour was raised upon
the inequality of the proportions, and the contrivers
began to be blamed, and a little threatened a-la-mob,
then it was D. V. § made it all, and he was to be
stoned for it. He endeavoured to confute || all that

was published by Webster, and Hodges, and the other
writers in Scotland against the Union: and he had
his share of danger, since, as he says, he was
watched by the mob; had his chamber windows
insulted; but, by the prudence of his friends, and
God's providence, he escaped *. In the midst of
this great scene of business and tumult, he collected
the documents, which he afterwards published for
the instruction of posterity, with regard to one of
the most difficult, and, at the same time, the most
fortunate, transactions, in our annals.
During all those labours and risques, De Foe pub-
lished, in December 1706, Caledonia, a Poem, in
honour of the Scots nation. This poetic essay,
which was intended to rescue Scotland from Jlander
in opinion, Caledonia herself bade him dedicate to
the Duke of Queensberry. Beside other benesac-
tions, the Commissioner gave the author, whom he
calls Daniel De Foe, Esquire, an exclusive privilege
to fell his encomiastic strains for seven years, with-
in the country of his celebration. Amidst our
Author's busy occupations at Edinburgh, he was
anxious to assure the world, that wherever the wri-
ter may be, the Reviews are written with his own
hand; no person having, or ever had, any concern
in writing them, but the known author, D. F. On
the 16th of January, the act of Union was passed
by the Scots Parliament; and De Foe returned
to London, in February 1706-7. While he thus
acted importantly at Edinburgh, he formed con-

Howour Author was rewarded by the ministers who
derived a benefit from those services, and from that
danger, as he does not tell, cannot now be known.
Before his departure for Scotland, indeed, Lord
Godolphin, as he acknowledges f, obtained for
him the continuance of an appointment, which her
Majesty, by the interposition of his first benesactor,
had been pleased to make him, in consideration of a
former service, in a foreign country, wherein he run
as much risque as a grenadier on the counter-scarp.
As he was too prudent to disclose his secret services.,
they must at present remain undiscovered. Yet is
there reason to think that he had a pension rather
than an office, since his name is not in the red book of
the Queen; and he solemnly avers, in bis Appeals
that he had not interest enough with Lord Oxford
• Lord Buchan was so obliging as to communicate the subjoined
extract of a letter to his Lordship's grandfather, the Earl of
Buchan, from De Foe, dated the 29th of May, 1711 :—" The
person, with whom / endeavoured to plant the interefl of your Lord-
Jhip'i friend, has been strangely taken up, since I had that occa-
sion; was. first, in suffering the operation of the surgeons to heal
the wound of the assassin; and since, in accumulating honours
from Parliament, the Queen, and the people. On Thursday
evening her Majelty created him Earl Mortimer, Earl of Oxford,
and Lord Hailcy of Wigmore: and we expect that to-morrow in
council he will have the white staff given him by the Queen, and
be declared Lord High Treasurer. I wrote this yesterday; and
this day, May the 29th, he is made Lord High Treasurer cf
Great Britain, and carried the white staff before the Queen this

to
to procure him the arrears due to him in the time of the
former Ministry. This appointment, whatever it were,
he is studious to tell, he originally owed to
Harley:. he, however, thankfully acknowledges,
that Lord Godolphin continued his savour to him
after the unhappy breach that separated his first be-
nesactor from the Minister, who continued in power
till August 1710.
The nation, which was filled with combustible
matter, burst into flame the moment of that memo-
rable separation, in 1707. In the midst of this
conflagration our Author was not inactive. He
waited on Harley after he had been driven from
power, who generously advised him to continue his
services to the J(>ueen, which he supposed would have n»
relation to personal differences among statesmen. Go-
dolphin received him with equal kindness, by say-
ing—/ always think a man honest till I find to the
contrary. And if we may credit De Foe's assevera-
tions, in the presence of those who could have con-
victed him of salsehood, he for three years held m
correspondence with his principal benefaclor, which the.
great man never took ill cf him.
As early as February 1706—7, De Foe avowed
his purpose to publish the History of the Union, which
he had ably assisted to accomplish. This design he
executed in 1709, though he was engaged in other
lucubrations, and gave the world a Review three
times a week. His history seems to have been
little noticed when it first appeared; for^ as the
presace states, it had many difficulties in the way;
many sactions to encounter, and parties to please.
Yet it was republished in 1712; and a third time in
1786, when a similar union had become the topic
of public debate and private conversation. The
subject of this work is the completion of a measure,
which was carried into esfect, notwithstanding ob-
structions apparently insurmountable, and tumults
approaching to rebellion, and which has produced the
ends designed,beyond expectation, whether we consider
its influence ontheGovernment,or its operationonthe
governed. The minuteness with which he describes
what he saw andheard on the turbulent stage, where he
acted a conspicuous part, is extremely interesting to
us, who wish to know what actually pasted, however
this circumstantiality may have disgusted contempo-
raneous readers. History is chiefly valuable as it
transmits a saithful copy of the manners and sentiments
of every age. This narrative of De Foe is a drama,
in which he introduces the highest peers and the
lowest peasants, speaking and acting, according as
they were each actuated by their characteristicpassions;
and while the man of taste is amused by his manner,
the man of business may draw instruction from the
documents, which are appended to the end, and in-
terspersed in every page. This publication had alone
preserved his name, had his Crusoe pleased us less.
De Foe published in 1709, what indeed required
less esfort of the intellect or the hand, The History of
Addresses; with no design, he says, and as we may
believe, to disturb the public peace, but to com-
pare the present tempers of men with the past, in
order to discover who had altered for the better, and
who for the worse. He gave a second volume of Ad-
dresses in 1711, with remarks serious and comical.
His purpose plainly was to abate, by ridicule, the
public fervour with regard to Sachevcrel, who, by
Vol. II. D d I know
I know not what satality, or folly, gave rise to
eventful changes. De Foe evinces, by these timeful
publications, that amidst all that enthusiasm and
tumult, he preserved his fenses, and adhered to his
principles.
When, by such imprudence as the world had never
seen before, Godolphin was in his turn expelled, in
August 171 o, our Author waited on the ex-minister;
who obligingly said to him, That be had the same
good-will, but not the same power to assist him: and
Godolphin told him, what was of more real use—
1o receive the Satteen's commands from her confidential
servants, when he saw thingsfettled. It naturally oc-
curred to De Foe, that it was his duty to go along
with the^Ministers, while, as he says, they did not
break in on the constitution. And who can blame
a very subordinate officer, (if indeed he held an
office), who had a wife and six children to maintain
with very precarious means? He was thus, says he,
cast back providentially on his first benesactor, who
laid his case before her Majesty, whereby he preserved
his interest, without any engagement. On that me-
morable change De Foe however somewhat changed
his tone. The method I shall take, says he*, in talking
of the public affairs, shall for the future be, though
with the same design to support truth, yet with more
caution of embroiling myself with a party, who have
no mercy, and who have no sense of service.
De Foe now lived at Newington, in comfortable
circumstances, publishing The Reviews, and send-
ing out such tracts, as either gratified his prejudices,
or supplied his needs. During that contentious pe-

tiod he naturally gave and received many wounds;
and he prudently entered into a truce with Mr. J.

however they might clash in party, they may write

yet preserve the Christian and the gentleman *.

Mr. Dyer,
I have your letter. I am rather glad to find you
put it upon the trial who was aggressor, than justify a thing
which I am sure you cannot approve; and in this I assure you I
am far from injuring you, and refer you to the time when long
since you had wrote / wasfledfrom juJlice: one Sammon being taken
up for printing a libel, and / being then on a journey, nor the least
charge against me for being concerned in it by any body but your
letter: — also many unkind personal reflections on me in your
letter, when I was in Scotland, on the affair of the Union, and I assure
you, when my paper had not in the least mentioned you, and
those I reser to time and date for the proof of.
I mention this only in desence of my last letter, in which I said
no more of it than to let you see I did not merit such treatment,
and could nevertheless be content to render any service to you,
though I thought myself hardly used.
But to state the matter fairly between you and I, [me] a writ-
ing for different interests, and so possibly coming und :r an una-
voidable necessity of jarring in several cases: I am ready to make a
fair truce of honour with you, viz. that if what either party are
doing, or saying, that may clash with the party we are for, and
urge us to speak, it shall be done without naming either's name,
and without personal reflections; and thus we may differ still, and
yet preserve both the Christian and the gentleman.

But between professed controvertists such a treaty
could only be persevered in with Punic saith.
While thus occupied, De Foe was not forgotten
by the City of Edinburgh with the usual ingratitude
of public bodies. On the first of February 1710-n,
that Corporation, remembering his Caledonia, em-
powered him to publish the Edinburgh Courant, in
the room of Adam Booge *, though I suspect that he

affront a man's person, because I do not join with him in prin-
ciple. I please myself with being the first proposer of so fair a
treaty with you, because I believe, as you cannot deny its being
very honourable, so it is not less so in coming first from me, who
I believe could convince you of my having been the first and most
ill-treated—for further proof of which I refer you to your letters,
at the time I was threatened by the Envoy of the King of Sweden.
However, Mr. Dyer, this is a method which may end what i»
past, and prevent what is future; and if refused, the future part
I am sure cannot lye at my door.
As to your letter, your proposal is so agreeable to me, that
truly without it I could not have taken the thing at all: for it
would have been a trouble intolerable, both to you as well as me,
to take your letter every post, first from you, and then send it
to the post-house.
Your method of sending to the black box, is just what I de-
signed to propose, and Mr. Shaw will doubtless take it of you: if
you think it needful for me to speak to him it shall be done—
What I want to know is only the charge, and that you will order
it constantly to be sent, upon hinting whereof I shall send you
the names. Wishing you success in all things (Tour opinions of
Government excepted) I am,
Your humble servant,

much to think of, and much to do at a distance:
and he soon after gave some support to Lord Ox-

The Ministers, by the course of events, were en-

can be assigned to British statesmen—the re-establish*
ment of tranquillity after a glorious war. The
treaty at Utrecht furnishes a memorable example of

and great sweetness, considering how much party then embittered
every composition. The British Merchant, which opposed The
Mercator, and which was compiled by Henry Martyn and his

assisted by Doctor D'Avenant; but the latter solemnly
denied it: and it soon after appeared to be the
production of Daniel De Foe, an ambidextrous
hireling, who for this dirty work received a large
weekly allowance from the Treasury. T hat he wrote
in the Mercator, De Foe admits; but he expressly
denies " that he either was the Author of it, had
the property of it, the printing of it, the profit of it,
or had the power to put any thing into it, if he
would." And, by his Appeal, he affirms before
God and the world, " that he never had any pay-
ment, or reward, for writing any part of it." Yet,
that he was ready to defend those papers of the
Mercator which were really his, if men would an-
swer with arguments, rather than abuse; though
not those things which he had never written, but
for which he had received such usage. He adds,
with the noble spirit of a true-born Englishman,
"The press was open to me as well as to others;
and how, or when I lost my English liberty of
speaking my mind, I know not: neither how my
speaking my opinions, without fee or reward, could
authorise any one to call me villain, rascal, traitor,
and such opprobrious names."
Of the imputed connexion with his jirsl benefactor,
Harley, during that memorable period, our Author
speaks with equal firmness, at a moment when sirm-
plainly mentioned in the fourth. Mr. Daniel Foe may change
his name from Review to Mercator, from Mercator to any other
title, yet still his singular genius mall be distinguished by his ini-
mitable way of writing. Thus personal sarcasm was introduced
to supply desicience of facts, or weakness of reasoning. When
Charles King republifhed The British Merchant in volumes, among.
various changes, he expunged, with other personalities, the name
of De Foe.
ness was necessary. "I solemnly protest," says he,
by his Appeals " in the presence of Him who mall
judge us all, that I have received no instructions,
orders, or directions for writing any thing, or ma-
terials from Lord Oxford, since Lord Godolphin
was Treasurer, or that I have ever shewn to Lord
Oxford any thing I had written or printed."
He challenges the world to prove the contrary;
and he affirms, that he always capitulated for
liberty to speak, according to his own judgment of
things. As to consideration, pension, or reward, he
declares most solemnly that he had none, except
his old appointment made him long before by Lord
Godolphin. What is extremely probable we may
easily credit, without such strong asseverations.
However Lord Oxford may have been gratified by
the voluntary writings of De Foe, he had doubtless
other persons who shared his confidence, and wrote
his Examiners *.
But De Foe published that, which by no means pro-
moted Lord Oxford's views, and which, therefore,
gained little of his savour. Our Author wrote
* It is now sufficiently known, That Lord Oxford had relin-
quished the Treaty of Commerce to its fate, before it was finally de-
bated in Parliament. See much curious matter on this subject in
Macpherson's State Papers, vol. ii. p. 421-23. It is there said,
that he gave up the commercial treaty, in compliment to Sir
Thomas Hanmer, as he would by no means be an occasion of a
breach among friends. The Treasurer had other reasons: The
treaty had been made by Bolingbroke, whom he did not love;
the Lords Anglesea and Abingdon had made extravagant de-
mands for their support; and, like a wise man, he thought it
idle to drive a nail that would not go. Yet Lord Halifax boasted
to the Hanoverian minister, That he alone had been the occasion of the
treaty being rejecled. Same papers, p. 509-47.

against the peace of Utrecht, because he approved
of it as little as he had done the treaty at Gertruy-
denburgh, under very different influences, a few
years before. The peace he was for, as he himself
says, was such as should neither have given the
Spanish monarchy to the House of Bourbon, nor to
the House of Austria; but that this bone of conten-
tion should have been so broken to pieces, as that it
should not have been dangerous to Europe; and
that England and Holland should have so strength-
ened themselves, by sharing its commerce, as should
have made them no more afraid of France, or the
Emperor; and that all that we should conquer in the
Spanish West Indies should be our own. But it is
equally true, he asfirms, that when the peace was
established, " I thought our business was to make
the best of it; and rather to inquire what improve-
ments could be made of it, than to be continually
exclaiming against«those who procured it."
He manfully avowed his opinion in 1715, when
it was both disgraceful and dangerous, that the 9th
article of the Treaty of Commerce was calculated
for the advantage of our trade; " Let who will make
it, that," says he, "is nothing to me. My reasons
are, because it tied up the French to open the door
to our manusactures, at a certain duty of importation
there, and left the Parliament of Britain at liberty to
shut their's out, by as high duties as they pleased
here, there being no limitation upon us, as to duties
on French goods, but that other nations should pay
the same. While the French were thus bound, and
the British free, I always thought we must be in a
condition to trade to advantage, or it must be our
own sault: this was my opinion, and is sostill; and
I would
I would engage to maintain it against any man, on a
public stage, before a jury of fifty merchants, and
venture my life upon the cause, if I were.assured of
fair play in the dispute. But, that it was my opi-
nion, we might carry on a trade with France to our
great advantage, and that we ought for that reason
to trade with them, appears in the third, fourth,
fifth, and sixth volumes of The Reviews, above nine
years before The Mercator was thought of." Expe-
rience has decided in savour of De Foe against his
opponents, with regard both to the theory and the
practice of commerce.
In May 1713, our Author relinquished the Re-
view, after nine years continuance: in Newgate it
began, and in Newgate it ended. Whether we
consider the frequency of the publication, or the
power of his disquisitions, the pertinacity of his op-
ponents, or the address of his defences, amid other
studies, without assistants, this must be allowed to
be such a work, as few of our writers have equal-
led. Yet, of this great performance, said Gay;
"The poor Review is quite exhausted, and grown
so very contemptible, that though he has provoked
all his brothers of the quill, none will enter into a
controversy with him. The fellow, who had excel-
lent natural parts, but wanted a small foundation
of learning, is a lively instance of those wits, who,
as an ingenious author says, will' endure but one*
skimming Poor Gay had learned this cant in the
Scriblerus Club, who thought themselves the wisest,
the wittiest, and virtuousest men, that ever were, or

ever would be. But of all their works, which
of them have been so often flammed, or yielded such
cream, as Robinson Crusoe, the Family Instructor, or
Religious Courtslrip? Some of their writings may
indeed be allowed to have uncommon merit; yet,
let them not arrogate exclusive excellence, or claim
appropriate praise.
When De Foe relinquished the Review, he began
to write A General History of Trade, which he pro-
posed to publish in monthly numbers. The first
number appeared on the first of August 1713. His
great design was to shew the reader, " What the whole
world is at this time employed in as to Trade" But
his more immediate end was, to reclify the mistake we
are fallen into as to Commerce, and to inform those
who are willing to inquire into the truth. In the
execution of this arduous undertaking, he avows his
intention of speaking what reason dictates and fact:
justifies, however he may clash with the popular
opinions of some people in trade. He could not
however wholly abstract himself from the pasting
scene. When his second number appeared, on the
15th of August i7I3, he gave a discourse on the har-
bour of Dunkirk; wherein he insists, that the port
ought to be destroyed, if it must remain with France;
but, if it were added to England, or made a free-
port, it would be for the good of mankind to have a
safe harbour in such dangerous seas. This History
of Trade, which exhibits the ingenuity, the strength,
and the piety of De Foe, extended only to two num-
bers. The agitations of the times carried him to
other literary pursuits; and the sactiousness of the
times constrained him to attend to personal security.
"While

- <{ While I spoke of things thus," says our Author,
"I bore infinite reproaches, as the defender of the
peace, by pamphlets, which I had no hand in." He
appears to have been silenced by noise, obloquy, and
insult; and finding himself in this manner treated,
he declined writing at all, as he assures us; and for
great part of a year never set pen to paper, except
inThc Reviews. "After this" continues he, " /

The place of his retreat is now known to have been
Halisax, or the borders of Lancashire*. And observ-
ing here, as he himself relates, the insolence of the
Jacobite party, and how they insinuated the Preten-
der's rights into the common people, " I set pen to
paper again, by writing A seasonable Caution; and,
to open the eyes of the poor ignorant country peo-
ple, I gave away this all over the kingdom, as gain
was not intended." With the same laudable pur-
pose he wrote three other pamphlets; the first,

• The late History of Halifax relates, That Daniel De Foe,
being forced to abscond, on account of his political writings, re-
iided at Halifax, in the Back-lane, at the sign of the Rose and
Crown, being known to Doctor Nettlcton, the physician, and
the Rev. Mr. Priestley, minister of a dissenting congregation there.
Mr. Watson is mistaken when he supposes that De Foe wrote his
Jure Divino here, which had been published previously in 1706;
and he is equally mistaken, when he fays, that De Foe had made
an improper use of the papers of Selkirk, whose story had been
often published.

third, What if the ^ueen should die?" Nothing
could be more plain," says he, " than that the titles
of these were amusements *, in order to put the books
into the hands of those people, who had been de-
luded by the Jacobites." These petty volumes were
so much approved by the zealous friends of the Pro-
testant succession, that they were diligent to disperse
them through the most distant counties. And De
Foe protests, that had the Elector of Hanover given
him a thousand pounds, he could not have served him
more effectually, than by writing these three trea-
tises.
The reader will learn, with surprise and indigna-
tion, that for these writings De Foe was arrested,
obliged to give eight hundred pounds bail, contrary
to the Bill of Rights, and prosecuted by informa-
tion, during Trinity term 1713. This groundless
prosecution was instituted by the absurd zeal of
"William Benson, who afterwards became ridicu-
lously famous for literary exploits, which justly
raised him to the honours of the Dunciad. Our
Author attributes this prosecution to the malice of
his enemies, who were numerous and powerful.
No inconsiderable people were heard to say, that they
knew the books were against the Pretender, but that
De Foe had disobliged them in other things, and
they resolved to take this advantage to punish him.
This story is the more credible, as he had procured

gate in Easter term 1713. He was however soon releas-
ed on making a proper submission. But it was happy
for De Foe that his first benefactor was still in power,
whoprocured him the Queen's pardon, inNovember*
1713. This act of liberal justice was produced by
the party-writersf °^ those black and bitter days, as an
additional proof of Lord Oxford's attachment to the
abdicated samily, while De Foe was laid to be con-
victed of absolute Jacobitism, contrary to the tenor
of his life, and the purpose of his writings. He him-
self said sarcastically, that they might as well have
made him a Mahometan. On his tomb-stone it
might have been engraved, that he was the only
Englishman who had been obliged to ask a royal par-
don, for writing in savour of the Hanover succession.
"By this time, says Boyer, in October 1714, the
treasonable design to bring in the Pretender was
manifested to the world by the agent of one of the
late managers, De Foe, in his History of the White
Staff. The Detection of the Secret History of the White
Staff, which was soon published, considently tells,
that it was written by De Foe; as is to be seen by
his abundance of words, his salse thoughts, and
his false English \." We now know that there was

at that epoch, no plot in savour of the Pretender-
except in the assertions of those who wished to pro,
mote their interest by exhibiting their zeal. And
I have shewn, that De Foe had done more to keep
out the Pretender, than the political tribe, who pro-
fited from his zeal, yet detracted from his same.
"No sooner was the Queen dead," says he,
£t and the King, as right required, proclaimed, but
the rage of men increased upon me to that degree,
that their threats were such as I am unable to ex-
press. Though I have written nothing since the
Queen's death; yet, a great many things are called
by my name, and I bear the answerers insults. I have
not seen or spoken with the Earl of Oxford," con-
tinues he, "since the King's landing, but once; yet,
he bears the reproach of my writing for him, and I
the rage of men for doing it." De Foe appears in-
deed to have been, at that noisy period, stunned by
factious clamour, and overborne, though not silenced,
by unmerited obloquy. He probably lost his original
appointment, when his first benesactor was finally ex-
pelled. Instead of meeting with reward for his
zealous services in support of the Protestant succession,
he was on the accession of George I. discountenanced
by those who had derived a benefit from his active
exertions. And of Addison, who was now exalted
into office, and enjoyed literary patronage, our

Royal and Noble Authors. Whether the Duke wrote this petty
pamphlet may be doubted ; but there can be no doubt that De Foe
was not the Author: For, he solemnly asserts by his Appeal int
1715, That he had written nothingjince the Queen's death. The inter-
nal evidence is stronger than this positive assertion.
Author
Author had said in his Double Welcome to the Duke of
Marlborougb, with less poetry than truth—
Mæcenas has his modern sancy strung,
And fixed his pension first, or he had never fung.
While thus insulted by enemies, and discounte-
nanced by power, De Foe published his Appeal
to Honour and fustice, in 1715; being a true Ac-
count of bis Conducl in public Affairs. As a motive
for this intrepid measure, he affectingly says, That,
"by the hints of mortality and the infirmities of a
life of sorrow and satigue, I have reason to think,
that I am very near to the great oceanof eternity, and
the time may not be long ere I embark on the last
voyage : wherefore, I think I should even accounts with
this world before I go, that no slanders may lyc
against my heirs, to disturb them in the peaceable
possession of their sather's inheritance, his character."
It is a circumstance perhaps unexampled in the life
of any othes writer, that before he could finissi his
Appeal, he was struck with an apoplexy. After
languishing more than six weeks, neither able to go
on, nor .likely to recover, his friends thought sit to
delay the publication no longer. "It is the opinion
of most who know him," says Baker, the publisher,
"that the treatment which he here complains of,
and others of which he would have spoken, have been
the cause of this disaster." When the ardent mind
of De Foe reflected on what he had done, and what
he had suffered, how he had been rewarded and per-
secuted, his heart melted in despair. His spirit, like
a candle struggling in the socket, blazed and sunk,
and blazed and sunk, till it disappeared in dark-
ness.
While
While his strength remained, he expostulated with
his adversaries in the following terms of great man-
liness, and instructive intelligence :—" It has been
the disaster of all parties in this nation, to be very-
hot in their turn, and as often as they have been so,
I have differed with them all, and shall do so.
I will repeat some of the occasions on the Whig side,
because from that quarter the accusation of my turn-
ing about comes.
"Thefirst time I had the misfortune to differ with
my friends, was about the year 1683, when the
Turks were besieging Vienna, and the Whigs in
England, generally speaking, were for the Turks
taking it; which I, having read the history of the
cruelty and perfidious dealings of the Turks in their
wars, and how they had rooted out the name of the
Christian religion in above three score and ten king.
doms, could by no means agree with: and though
then but a young man, and a younger author, I op-
posed it, and wrote. against it, which was taken
very unkindly indeed.
"The next time I differed with my friends, was
when King James was wheedling the Dissenters to
take off the penal laws and test, which I could by
no means come into. 1 told the Dissenters, I had
rather the Church of England should pull our clothes
off by fines and forfeitures, than the Papiils should
1'all both upon the Church and the Dissenters, and
pull our skins off by fire and saggot.
"The next differencel had with good men,was about
the scandalous practice of occasional conformity, in
which I had the misfortune to make many honest men
angry, rather because I had the better of the argu-
ment, than because they disliked what I said.
And,
"And now I have lived to see the Dissenters them-
selves very quiet; if not very well pleased with an act
of Parliament to prevent it. Their friends indeed laid
it on; they would be friends indeed, if they would
talk of taking it off again.
"Again, I had a breach with honest men for their
male-trenting King William, of which I say nothing;
because I think they are now opening their eyes, and
making what amends they can to his memory.
"The fifth difference I had with them, was about
the treaty of partition, in which many honest men
were mistaken, and in which I told them plainly
then, that they would at last end the war upon
worse terms; and so it is my opinion they would
have done, though the treaty of Gertruydenburgh
had taken place.
"The sixth time I differed with them, was when
the old Whigs sellout with the modern Whigs; and
when the Duke of Marlborough and my Lord Go-
dolphin were used by the Observator in a manner
worse, I confess, for the time it lasted, than ever
they were used since; nay, though it were by Abel
and the Examiner. But the success sailed. In this
dispute my Lord Godolphin did me the honour to
tell me, I had served him and his Grace also, both
faithfully and successfully. But his Lordship is dead,
and I have now no testimony of it, but what is to
be found in the Observator, where I am plentifully
abused for being an enemy to my country, by acting'
in the interest of my Lord Godolphin and the Duke
of Marlborough. What weathercock can turn with
such tempers as these?
"/ am now in the seventh breach with them, and
my crime now is, that I will not believe and say the

it of either of them; and which, if I had believed,
yet I ought not to have been the man that should
have said it, for the reasons aforesaid.
"In such turns of tempers and times a man must
have been ten-fold a Vicar of Bray, or it is impossi-
ble but he must one time or other be out with every
body. This is my present condition; and for this I
am reviled with having abandoned my principles,
turned Jacobite, and what not: God judge between
me and these men! Would they come to any par-
ticulars with me, what real guilt I may have, I
would freely acknowledge; and if they would pro-
duce any evidence of the bribes, the pensions, and
the rewards I have taken, I would declare honestly
whether they were true or no. If they would give
a list of the books which they charge me with, and
the reasons why they lay them at my door, I would
acknowledge any mistake, own what I have done,
and let them know what I have not done. But these
men neither shew mercy, nor leave room for re-
pentance; in which they act not only unlike their
Maker, but contrary to'his express commands *."
With
• The most solemn afleverations, and the most unanswerable
arguments of our Author, were not, after all, believed. When
Charles King re-published The British Merchant, in 1721, he with-
out a scruple attributed The Mercator to a hireling writer of a
weekly paper called The Review. And Anderson, at a still later
period, goes further in his Chronology of Commerce, and names
De Foe, as the hireling writer of The Mercator, and other papers
in favour of the French treaty of trade. We can now judge
with
With the same independence of spirit, but with
greater modesty of manner, our Author openly dis-
approved of the imtemperance, which was adopted
by Government in 1714, contrary to the original pur-
pose of George I. "It is and ever was my opi-
nion," says De Foe in bis Appeal, " that modera-
tion is the only virtue by which the tranquillity of
this nation can be preserved; and even the King
himself, (I believe his Majesty will allow me that
freedom,) can only be happy in the enjoyment of
the crown, by a moderate administration: if he
mould be obliged, contrary to his known disposition,
to join with intemperate councils, if it does not
lessen his security, I am persuaded it will lessen his
satissaction. To attain at the happy calm, which is
the consideration that mould move us all, (and
he would merit to be called the nation's phy-
sician, who could prescribe the specific for it,) I
think I may be allowed to say, a conque/i of parties
.will never do it, a balance of parties may." Such was
the political testament of De Foe; which it had been
happy for Britain, had it been as saithfully executed
as it was wisely made!
The year 1715 may be regarded as the period of
our Author's political life. Faction henceforth
found other advocates, and parties procured other
writers to propagate their salsehoods. Yet, when a
with the impartiality of arbitrators: on the one hand, there are
the living challenge, and the death-bed declaration of De Foe;
on the other, the mere surmise and unauthorised assertion of
King, Anderson, and others, who detract from their own vera-
city by their own factiousness, or foolery. It is surely time .to
free ourselves from prejudices of every kind, and to disregard the
sound of names as much as the falsehoods of party.

cry was raised against foreigners, on the accession of*
George I. The True-born Englishman was revived,
rather by Roberts the bookseller, than by De Foe
the Author *. But the persecutions of party did
not cease when De Foe ceased to be a party-writer.
He was insulted by Boy er, in April 1716, as the
author of The Triennial Acl impartially stated: "but,
whatever was offered," says Boyer, " against the
Septennial Bill, was fully confuted by the ingenious
and judicious Joseph Addison, Esquire." Whether
De Foe wrote in defence of the people's rights, or
in support of the law's authority, he is to be cen-
sured: whether Addison defended the Septennial
Bill, or the Peerage Bill, he is to be praised. Wit3i
the same misconception of the sact, and malignancy
of spirit, Tolland reviled f De Foe for writing an
answer to The State Anatomy, in 1717. The time
however will at last come, when the world will
judge of men from their actions rather than pre-
tensions.
The death of Anne, and the accession of George I.
seem to have convinced De Foe of the vanity of
party-writing. And from this eventful epoch, he ap-
pears to have studied how to meliorate rather than to
harden the heart; how to regulate, more than to
vitiate, the practice of life.
Early in 1715 he published The Family Instructor,
in three parts: 1st, relating to sathers and children;
2<3, to masters and servants; 3d, to husbands and
wives. He carefully concealed his authorship, lest
the good effects of his labour should be obstructed by
the great imperfections of the writer. The world

The bookseller soon procured a recommendatory let-
ter from the Reverend Samuel Wright, a well-
known preacher in the Black-Friars. It was praised
from the pulpit and the press: and the utility of the
end, with the attractiveness of the execution, gave
it, at length, a general reception *. The Author's
first design was to write a Dramatic Poem; but the
subject was too solemn, and the text too copious, to
admit of restraint, or to allow excursions. His
purpose was to divert and instrucl, at the same mo-
ment; and by giving it a dramatic form, it has been
called by some A religious play. De Foe at last says
with his usual archness: As to its being called a play,
be it called so, if they please: it must be confessed,
some parts of it are too much acted in many sami-
lies among us. The Author wishes, that either all
our Plays were as useful for the improvement and
entertainment of the world, or that they were less
encouraged. There is, I think, some mysticism in
the presace, which, it were to be defired, a judicious
hand would expunge, when The Family Instructor
shall be again reprinted; for, reprinted it will be,
while our language endures; at least, while wife men
shall continue to consider the influences of religion
and the practice of morals as of the greatest use to
society.
• The family of George I. had been instructed by the copy of
this book, which is in The Museum. It would seem from the
title page and Mr. Wright's letter being printed on a different
paper from the work itself, that both were added after the first,
publication. The Family Instructor and Mr. Wright's letter
ivere entered at Stationers Hall, for Emanuel Mathews, on the

THE LIFE OF DE FOE.
De Foe afterwards added a second volume, in two
parts; ist, relating to Family Breaches; 2dly, to the
great Mi/lake, of mixing the Passions in the managing of
Children. He considered it, indeed, as a bold adven-
ture to write a second volume of any thing; there
being a general opinion among modern readers, that
second parts never come up to the spirit of the sirst.
He quotes Mr. Milton, for disfering from the world
upon the question, and for affirming with regard to
his own great performances, That the people had a
general fense of the loss of Paradise, but not ah equal
gust for regaining it. Of De Foe's second volume,
it will be easily allowed, that it is as instructive and
pleasing as the first. His Religions Courtship, which
he published in 1722, may properly be considered as
a third volume: For the design is equally moral, the
manner is equally attractive, and it may in the same
manner be called a Religious Play.
But the time at length came, when De Foe was
to deliver to the world the most popular of all his
performances. In April 1719, he published the
well-known Life and surprising Adventures of Robin-
son Crusoe. The reception was immediate and univer-
sal; and Taylor, who purchased the manuscript
after every bookseller had refused it, is said to have
gained a thousand pounds. If it be inquired by
what charm it is that these surprising Adventures
should have instantly pleased, and always pleased, it
will be found, that few books have ever so natu-
rally mingled amusement with instruction. The at-
tention is fixed, either by the simplicity of the nar-
ration, or by the variety of the incidents; the heart
is amended by a vindication of the ways of God to
jiictn; and the understanding is informed, by various
examples,
examples, how much utility ought to be preferred to
ornament: the young are instructed, while the old
are amused.
Robinson Crusoe had scarcely drawn his canoe
ashore, when he was attacked by his old enemies,
the savages. He was assailed first by The Life and
strange Adventures of Mr. D De F—, of London,
Hosier, who has lived above Fifty Tears by himself in
the Kingdoms of North and South Britain. In a dull
dialogue between De Foe, Crusoe, and his man Fri-
day, our Author's life is lampooned, and his mis-
fortunes ridiculed. But he who had been struck by
apoplexy, and who was now discountenanced by
power, was no fit object of an Englishman's satire.
Our Author declares, when he was himself a writer
of satiric poetry, " that he never reproached any
man for his private infirmities, for having his house
burnt, his ships cast away, or his samily ruined; nor
had he ever lampooned any one, because he could
not pay his debts, or differed in judgment from
him." Pope has been justly censured for pursuing
a vein of satire extremely dissimilar. And Pope
placed De Foe with Tutchen, in The Dunciad, when
our Author's infirmities were greater and his com-
fort less. He was again assaulted in 1719, by An
Epistle to D De F—, the reputed Author of Ro-
binson Crusoe. "Mr. Foe," says the letter-writer,
"I have perused your pleasant story of Robinson
Crusoe; and if the saults of it had extended no fur-
ther than the frequent solecisms and incorrectness of
style, improbabilities, and sometimes impossibilities,
I had not given you the trouble of this Epistle."
"Yet," said Johnson to Piozzi, " was there ever
any thing written by mere man, that was wished

longer by its readers, except Don Quixote, Robinson
Crusoe, and the Pilgrim's Progress?" This episto-
lary- critic, who renewed his angry attack when the
second volume appeared, has all the dulness, with-
out the acumen, of Dennis, and all his malignity,
without his purpose of reformation. The Life of
Crusoe has passed through innumerable editions, and
has been translated into foreign languages, while the
criticism sunk into oblivion.
De Foe set the critics at defiance while he had
the people on his side. As a commercial legislator he
knew, that it is rapid sale which is the great incen-
tive: and, in August 1719, he published a second
volume of Surprising Adventures, with similar suc-
cess. In hope of prosit and of praise, he produced
in August 1720, Serious Reflections during the Life
of Robinson Crusoe, with bis Vision of the Angelic World.
He acknowledges,' that the present work is not
merely the product of the two first volumes, but the
two first may rather be called the product of this:
the sable is always made for the moral, not the moral
for the sable. He however did not advert, that in-
struction must be insinuated rather than enforced.
That this third volume has more morality than sable,
is the cause, I fear, that it has never been read with
the same avidity as the former two, or spoken of with
the same approbation. We all prefer amusement to
instruction; and he who would inculcate useful
truths, must study to amuse, or he will offer his
lessons to an auditory, neither numerous, nor atten-
tive.
The tongue of detraction is seldom at rest. It has
often been repeated, that De Foe had surreptitiously
appropriated the papers of Alexander Selkirk, sc
Scotch
4^5
Scotch mariner, who having lived solitarily on the
ifle of Juan Fernandez, four years and four months,
was relieved on the 2d of February, 1708-9, by Cap-
tain Woodes Rogers, in his cruizing voyage round the
world. But let no one draw inferences till the sact;
be first ascertained. The adventures of Selkirk had
been thrown into the air, in 1712, for literary
hawks to devour *; and De Foe may have catched a
* The whole story of Selkirk is told in Woodes Rogers's voyage,
which he published in 1712, from p. 12510131, inclusive : whence
it appears, that Selkirk had preserved no pen, ink, or paper, and
had lost his language; so that he had no journal or papers, which he
could communicate, or by others could be stolen. There is an
account of Selkirk in The Englishman, No. 26. The particular
manner how Alexander Selkirk lived four years and four months,
in the ifle of Juan Fernandez, is related in Captain Cook's
voyage into the South Sea, which was published in 1712. And
Selkirk's tale was told in the Memoirs of Literature, 5. voL
p. vi 8: so that the world was fully possessed of Selkirk's story in
1712, seven years prior to the publication of Crusoe's adventures.
Nor were his adventures singular; for, Ringrose mentions, in his
account of Captain Sharp's voyage, a person who had escaped
singly from a ship that had been wrecked on Juan Fernandez, and
who lived alone five years before he was relieved: And Dam-
pier mentions a Mosquito Indian, who having been accidentally
left on this island, subsisted three years solitarily, till that voyager
carried him oss. From which of these De Foe borrowed his great
incident, it is not easy to discover. In the preface to The Se-
rious ReJIedions, he indeed saye, " That there is a man alive and
well known, the actions of whose lise are the just subject of these
volumes, and to whom the most part of the story directly alludes."
This turns the scale in favour of Selkirk. Nor, was the name of
Crusoe wholly fictitious; for, among De Foe's contemporaries,
JohnDunton fpeaksof Timothy Crusoe, who was called the Golden
Preacher, and was so great a textuary, that he could pray two
hours together in scripture language; but, he was not arrived at
persection ; as appeared by his sloth in tying the conjugal knot:

common
common prey, which he converted to the uses of his
intellect, and distributed for the purposes of his in-
terest. Thus he may have sairly acquired the fun-
damental incident of Crusoe's life; but, he did not
borrow the various events, the useful moralities,
or the engaging style. Few men could write such a
poem; and few Selkirks could imitate so pathetic an
original. It was the happiness of De Foe, that as
many writers have succeeded in relating enterprises
by land, he excelled in narrating adventures by sea,
with such felicities of language, such attractive vari-
eties, such infinuative instruction, as have seldom
been equalled, but never surpassed.
While De Foe in this manner busied himself in
writing adventures, which have charmed every
reader, a rhyming fit returned on him. He pub-
lished in 1720, The complete Art of Painting, which
he did into Englis}j from the French of Du Fresnoy.
Dryden had given, in 1695, a translation of DuFres-
noy's poem, which has been esteemed for its know-
ledge of the sister arts. What could tempt De Foe
to this undertaking it is not easy to discover, unless
we may suppose, that he hoped to gain a few guineas,
without much labour of the head or hand. Dryden
has been justly praised for relinquishing vicious ha-
bits of composition, and adopting better models
for his muse. De Foe, after he had seen the cor-
rectness, and heard the music of Pope, remained
unambitious of accurate rhymes, and regardless of
sweeter numbers. His politics and his poetry, for
which he was long samous among biographers,
would not have preserved his name beyond the fleet-
'ing day; yet I suspect that, in imitation of Milton, he
would have preferred his Jure Divino to his Robin-
son Crusoe.
De
De Foe lived not then, however, in pecuniary
distress; for his genius and his industry were to him
the mines of Potosi: and in 1722, he obtained from
the Corporation of Colchester, though my inquiries
have not discovered by what interposition, a ninety-
nine years lease of Kingswood-heath, at a yearly rent
of a hundred and twenty pounds, with a fine of
five hundred pounds *. This transaction seems to
evince a degree of wealth much above want, though
the assignment of his lease not long aster to Walter
Bernard equally proves, that he could not easily hold
what he had thus obtained. Kingswood-heath is now
worth three hundred pounds a year, and is advertised
for sale by Bennet, the present possessor-
Whatever may have been his opulence, our Au-
thor did not waste his subsequent life in unprofitable
idleness. No one can be idly employed who endea-
vours to make his fellow subjects better citizens and
wiser men. This will sufficiently appear if we con-
sider his future labours, under the distinct heads of
voyages; fictitious biography; moralities, either
grave or ludicrous; domestic travels; and tracts on
trade.
The success of Crusoe induced De Foe to publish,
in 1720, The Life and Piracies of Captain Singleton,
though not with similar success: The plan is narrower,
and the performance is less amusive. In 1725, he
gave A New Voyage round the World, by a Course
never failed before. Most voyagers have had this
misfortune, that whatever success they had in the ad-
venture, they had very little in the narration: they are
indeed full of the incidents of sailing, but they have
Jvlorant's Colchester, p. 134.
nothing
%
nothing of story for the use of readers who never in-
tend to brave the dangers of the sea. These faults
De Foe is studious to avoid in his new voyage. He
spreads before his readers such adventures as no
writer of a real voyage can hope to imitate, if we ex-
cept the teller of Anson's tale. In the life of Crusoe
we are gratified by continually imagining that the
fiction is a sact: in the voyage round the world we
are pleased by constantly perceiving that the fact
is a fiction, which, by uncommon skill, is made
more interesting than a genuine voyage.
Of fictitious biography it is equally true, that by
matchless art it may be made more instructive
than a real life. Few of our writers have excelled
De Foe in this kind of biographical narration, the
great qualities of which are, to attract by the diver-
sity of circumstances, and to instruct by the useful-
ness of examples.
He published, in 1720, the History of Duncan
Campbell. Of a person who was born deaf and
dumb, but who himself taught the deaf and dumb
to understand, it is easy to see that the life would be
extraordinary. It will be found, that the Author
has intermixed some disquisitions of learning, and
has contrived that the merriest passages shall end
with some edifying moral. The fortunes and mis-
fortunes of Moll Flanders were made to gratify the
world in 1721. De Foe was aware, that in relating
a vicious life, it was necessary to make the best use
of a bad story; and he artfully endeavours, that
the reader shall be more pleased with the moral than
the sable; with the application than the relation;
with the end of the writer than the adventures of
the person. There was published in 1721, a work
2 of
of a similar tendency, the Life of Colonel Jack, who
was born a gentleman but was bred a pickpocket.—
Our Author is studious to convert his various adven-
tures into a delightful field, where the reader might
gather herbs, wholesome and medicinal, without
the incommodation of plants, poisonous, or noxious.
In 1724, appeared the Life of Roxana. Scenes of
crimes can scarcely be represented in such a manner,
says De Foe, but some make a criminal use of them;
but when vice is painted in its low-prized colours, it
is not to make people love what from the frightful-
ness of the figures they ought necessarily to hate.
Yet, I am not convinced, that the world has been
made much wiser, or better, by the perusal of these
lives: they may have diverted the lower orders, but
I doubt if they have much improved them; if how-
ever they have not made them better, they have not
left them worse. But they do not exhibit many
scenes which are welcome to cultivated minds. Of a
very different quality are the Memoirs of a Cu-
valicr, during the Civil Wars in England, which
seem to have been published without a date. This
is a romance the likest to truth that ever was writ-
ten. It is a narrative of great events, which is
drawn with such simplicity, and enlivened with such
reflections, as to inform the ignorant and entertain
the wife.
The moralities of De Foe, whether published in
single volumes, or interspersed through many pas-
sages, must at last give him a superiority over the
crowd of his contemporaries. The approbation
which has been long given to his Family Instructor and
his Religious Courtship, seem to contain the savour-
able decision of his countrymen. But there are still
other
43°
THE LIFE OF DE FOE.
other performances of this nature, which arc now
to be mentioned, of not inferior merit.
De Foe published, in 1722, A Journal os the
Plague in 1665. The Author's artifice consists in
fixing the reader's attention by the deep distress of
fellow-men; and, by recalling the reader's recollec-
tion to striking examples of mortality, he endeavours
to inculcate the uncertainty of life, and the useful-
ness of reformation. In 1724, De Foe published
The great Law of Subordination. This is an admi-
rable commentary on the Unsufferablc Behaviour of
Servants. Yet, though he interest by his mode, in-
form by his sacts, and convince by his argument,
he sails at last, by expecting from law what must
proceed from manners. Our Author gave the
Political Hi/lory of the Devil, in 1726. The matter
and the mode conjoin to make this a charming per-
formance. He engages poetry and prose, reasoning
and wit, persuasion and ridicule, on the side of reli-
gion and morals, with wonderful esficacy. De Foe
wrote a system of magic in 1726. This may be pro-
perly regarded as a supplement to the History of the
Devil. His end and his execution are exactly the
same. He could fee no great harm in the present
pretenders to magic, if the poor people would but
keep their money in their pockets; and that they
should have their pockets picked by such an unper-
forming, unmeaning, ignorant crew as these are,
is the only magic De Foe could fee in the whole
science. But the reader will discover in our Au-
thor's system extensive erudition, salutary remark,
and useful satire. De Foe published in 1727, his
31realise on the Use and Abuse of the Marriage-Bed.
The Author had begun this performance thirty years
before:
before: he delayed the publication, though it had
been long finished, in hopes of reformation. But
being now grown old, and out of the reach of scandal,
and despairing of amendment from a vicious age,
he thought proper to close his days with this satire.
He appealed to that Judge, before whom he expect-
ed soon to appear, that as he had done it with an
upright intention, so he had used his utmost endeavour
to perform it in a manner, which was the least liable
to reflection, and the most answerable to the end
of it—the reformation of the guilty. After such an
appeal, and such asseverations, I will only remark,
that this is an excellent book with an improper title-
page.
We are now to consider our Author's Tours.
He published his Travels through England, in
1724 and 1725; and through Scotland, in
1727. De Foe was not one of those travellers
who seldom quit the banks of the Thames.
He had made wide excursions over all those coun-
tries, with observant eyes and a vigorous intellect.
The great artifice of these volumes consists in the fre-
quent mention of such men and things, as are always
welcome to the reader's mind.
De Foe's Commercial Tracts are to be reviewed
lastly. Whether his sancy gradually sailed, as age
hastily advanced, I am unable to tell. He certainly
began, in 1726, to employ his pen more frequently
on the real business of common life. He published,
in 1727, The Complete English Tradesman; directing
him in the several parts of trade. A second volume
soon after followed, which was addressed chiefly to
the more experienced and more opulent traders. In
1 these
these treatises the tradesman found many directions'
of business, and many lessons of prudence. De Foe
was not One of those writers, who consider private
vices as public benefits: God forbid, he exclaims,
that I should be understood to prompt the vices of the
age, in order to promote any practice of traffic:
trade need not be destroyed though vice were mortally
wounded. With this salutary spirit he published, in
1728, A. Plan of the Englis}) Commerce. This seems
to be the conclusion of what he had begun in
1713.. In 1728, Gee printed his Trade and Navi-
gation considered. De Foe insisted, that our industry,
our commerce, our opulence, and our people, had
increased and were increasing. Gee represented that
our manusactures had received mortal stabs; that
our poor were destitute, and our country miserable.
De Foe maintained the truth, which experience has
taught to unwilling auditors. Gee asserted the salse-
hood, without knowing the sact: yet Gee is quoted,
while De Foe, with all his knowledge of the sub-
ject, as a commercial writer, is almost forgotten.
The reason may be found perhaps in the characte-
ristic remark with which he opens his plan: Trade,
like religion, is what every body talks of, but few
understand.
"When curiosity has contemplated such copious-
ness, such variety, and such excellence, it naturally
inquires, which was the last of De Foe's performances?
Were we to determine from the date of the title-
page, the Plan of Commerce must be admitted to be
his last. But if we must judge from his presatory
declaration, in The Abuse of the Marriagc-Bcd,
where he talks of closing his days nith this satire,
which he was so sar from seeing cause of being
ashamed
ashamed of, that he hoped he should not be ashamed
of it .where he was going to account for it, we
must finally decide, that our Author closed his ca-
reer " with this upright intention for the good of man-
kind."
De Foe, after those innumerable labours, which
I have thus endeavoured to recal to the public recol-
lection, died in April, 1731, within the parish of
St. Giles's, Cripplegate, London, at an age, if he
were born in 1663, when it was time to prepare for
his last voyage. He left a widow, Susannah, who
did not long survive him, and six sons and daugh-
ters, whom he boasts of having educated as well as
his circumstances would admit. His son Daniel is
said to have emigrated to Carolina; of Benjamin,
his second son, no account can be given. His
youngest daughter Sophia, married Mr. Henry Ba-
ker, a person more respectable as a philosopher than
a poet, who died in 1774, at the age of seventy.
His daughter Maria married one Langley; but
Hannah and Henrietta probably remained unmar-
ried, since they were heiresses only of a name, which -
did not recommend them. With regard to

Life. De Foe probably died insolvent; for letters of
administration on his goods and chattels were
granted to Mary Brooke, widow, a creditrix, in Sep-
tember 1733, after summoning in official form the next
of kin to appear *. John Dunton f, who personally
knew our Author, describes him, in 1705, as a man
of good parts and clear fense; of a conversation, in-
genious and brisk; of a spirit, enterprising and
bold, but of little prudence; with good nature and
real honesty. Of his petty habits little now can he
told, more than he has thus confessed himself J:
<{ God, I thank thee, I am not a drunkard, or a
swearer, or a whoremaster, or a busy-body, or idle,
or revengeful; and though this be true, and I chal-
lenge all the world to prove the contrary, yet, I
must own, I see small satissaction in all the negatives
of common virtues; for though I have not been
guilty of any of these vices, nor of many more, I
have nothing to infer from thence, but Te Deum lau.
damns." He says himself—
Confession will anticipate reproach,
He that reviles us then, reviles too much;
All satire ceases when the men repent,
'Tis cruelty to lash the penitent.
When De Foe had arrived at sixty-five, while he
was encumbered with a samily, and, I fear, pinched
with penury, Pope endeavoured, by repeated strokes,
to bring his gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.
This he did without propriety, and, as sar as appears,

without

435
without provocation; for our Author is not in the
black list of scribblers, who by attempting to lessen
the poet's same, incited the satirist's indignation.
The offence and the sate of Bentley and De Foe were
nearly alike. Bently would not allow the translation
to be Homer: De Foe had endeavoured to bring
Milton into vogue seven years ere the Paradise Lost
and Chevy Chase had been criticised in the Spectators
by Addison. Our Author had said in More Refor-
mation,
Let this describe the nation's character,
One man reads Milton, forty .
The case is plain, the temper of the time,
One wrote the lewd, the other the sublime.
An enraged poet alone could have thrust into the
Dunciad, Bentley, a profound scholar, Cibber, a
brilliant wit, and De Foe, a happy genius. This was
the consequence of exalting satire as the test of
truth; while truth ought to have been enthroned the
test of satire. Yet, it ought not to be forgotten, that
De Foe has some sarcasm, in his System of Magic, on
the sylphs and gnomes, which Pope may have deemed
a daring invasion of his Roficrutian territories.
De Foe has not yet outlived his century, though
he have outlived most of his contemporaries. Yet the
time is come, when he must be acknowledged as one
of the ablest, as he is one of the most captivating,
writers, of which this island can boast. Before he
canbe admitted to this pre-eminence, he must be con-
sidered distinctly, as a poet, as a novelist, as a pole-
mick, as a commercial writer, and as a grave historian.
As a poet, we must look to the end of his effusions
rather than to his execution, ere we can allow him
F f 2 considerable
considerable praise. To mollify national animosities,
or to vindicate national rights, is certainly noble ob-
jects, which merit the vigour and imagination of
Milton, or the flow and precision of Pope -r but our
Author's energy runs into harshness, and his sweet-
ness is to be tasted in his prose more than in his
poesy. If we regard the adventures of Crusoe, like
the adventures of Telemachus, as a poem, his moral,
his incidents, and his language, must lift him high
on the poet's scale. His professed poems, whether
we contemplate the propriety of sentiment, or the
suavity of numbers, may indeed, without much
loss of pleasure or instruction, be resigned to those,
who, in imitation of Pope, poach in the fields of
obsolete poetry for brilliant thoughts, felicities of
phrase, or for happy rhymes.
As a novelist, every one will place him in the fore-
most rank, who considers his originality, his per-
formance, and his purpose. The Ship of Fools had
indeed been launched in early times; but, who like
De Foe, had ever carried his reader to sea, in order
to mend the heart, and regulate the practice of life,
by mewing his readers the effects of adversity, or how
they might equally be called to sustain his hero's
trials, as they sailed round the world. But, without
attractions, neither the originality, nor the end, can
have any salutary consequence. This he had fore-
seen; and for this he has provided, by giving his ad-
ventures in a style so pleasing, because it is simple, and
so interesting, because it is particular, that every one
sancies he could write asimilar language. It was, then,
idle in Boyer formerly, or in Smollet lately, to speak
of De Foe as a party writer, in little estimation. The
writings of no Author since have run through more
numerous
437
numerous editions. And he whose works have plea-
sed generally and pleased long, must be deemed a
writer of no small estimation; the people's verdict
being the proper test of what they are the proper
judges.
As a polemick, I fear we must regard our Author
with lese kindness, though it must be recollected,
that he lived during a contentious period, when two
parties distracted the nation, and writers indulged
in great asperities. But, in opposition to reproach,
let it ever be remembered, that he defended freedom,
without anarchy j that he supported toleration,
without libertinism; that he pleaded for moderation
even amidst violence. With acuteness of intellect,
with keenness of wit, with archness of diction, and
pertinacity of design; it must be allowed that nature
had qualified, in a high degree, De Foe for a dispu-
tant- His polemical treatises, whatevermight havebeen
their attractions once, may now be delivered with-
out reserve to those who delight in polemical reading.
De Foe, it must be allowed, was a party-writer: But,
were not Swift and Prior, Steel and Addison, ,
Halisax and Bolingbroke, party-writers? De Foe,
being a party-writer upon settled principles, did
not change with the change of parties: Addison
and Steel, Prior and Swift, connected as they were
with persons, changed their note as persons were
elevated or depressed.
As a commercial writer, De Foe is sairly intitled
to stand in the foremost rank among his contem-
poraries, whatever may be their performances or
their same. Little would be his praise, to say of
him, that he wrote on commercial legislation like
F f 3 Addison,
Addison, who when he touches on Trade, sinks
into imbecility, without knowledge of sact, oiNrjower
of argument *. The distinguishing characteristics
of De Foe, as a commercial difquisitor, are origina-
lity and depth. He has many sentiments with re-
gard to traffic, which are scattered through his
Reviews, and which I never read in any other book.
His Giving Jims no Charity is a capital performance,
with the exception of one or two thoughts about
the abridgment of labour by machinery, which are
either half formed or half expressed. Were we to
compare De Foe with D'Avenant, it would be found,
that D'Avenant has more detail from official docu-
ments; that De Foe has more sact from wider
inquiry. D'Avenant is more apt to consider laws
in their particular application; De Foe more fre-
quently investigates commercial legislation in its
general effects. From the publications of D'Avenant
it is sufficiently clear, that he was not very regard-
ful of means or very attentive to consequences;
De Foe is more correct in his motives, and more
salutary in his ends. But, as a commercial prophet,
De Foe must yield the palm to Child; who fore-
seeing from experience that men's conduct must
finally be directed by their principles, foretold the
colonial revolt: De Foe, allowing his prejudices to
obscure his sagacity, reprobated that suggestion,
because he deemed interest a more strenuous prompter
than enthusiasm. Were we however to form an
opinion, not from special passages, but from whole

augmentation. And See his Commercial Papers in the Freeholder.

performances, we must incline to De Foe, 'when
compared with the ablest contemporary: we must
allow him the preference, on recollection, that when he
writes on commerce he seldom sails to insinuate some
axiom of morals, or to inculcate some precept of
religion.
As an historian, it will be found, that our Author
had few equals in the English language, when he
wrote. His Memoirs of a Cavalier shew how well
he could execute the lighter narratives. His History
of the Union evinces that he was equal to the higher
department of historic composition. This is an ac-
count of a single event, difficult indeed in its exe-
cution, but beneficial certainly in its consequences.
With extraordinary Ikill and information, our Author
relates, not only the event, but the transactions which
preceded, and the effects which followed. He is at
once learned and intelligent. Considering the sac-
tiousness of the age, his candour is admirable. His
moderation is exemplary. And if he spoke of James I.
as a tyrant, he only exercised the prerogative, which
our historians formerly enjoyed, of casting obloquy on
an unfortunate race, in order to supply deficience of
knowledge, of elegance, and of stile. In this in-
stance De Foe allowed his prejudice to overpower his
philosophy. If the language of his narrative want
the dignity of the great historians of the current
times, it has greater sacility; if it be not always
grammatical, it is generally precise; and if it be
thought defective in strength, it must be allowed to
excel in sweetness.
Such then are the pretensions of De Foe to be ac-
knowledged as one of the ablest and most useful
F f 4 writers
writers of our island. He who still doubts may
perhaps satisfy his greatest doubts, by perusing
the chronological catalogue of our Author's works,
which I have compiled, in order to gratify the public
curiosity; and which, for the greater distinctness, I
have divided into two heads: ist, Those writings
that I think are certainly De Foe's: 2dly, those writ-
ings that are said to be his. As I do not pretend to
perfect accuracy, it would be a savour to the world
and to me, if any one, of more knowledge and leisure
than I possess, would point out mistakes for the
purpose of amendment. The zealous interposition of
Mr. Lockyer Davis, and the liberal spirit of the Sta-
tioners Company, procured me the perusal of the
Register of books, which have been entered at Sta-
tioners-Hall. I was surprised and disappointed to
find so few of De Foe's writings entered as property,
and his name never mentioned as an author or a
man.

it continued to be published every Tuesday, Thursday, and
Saturday, till May 1713, when it was discontinued. The
whole Collection forms nine thick volumes in Quarto: but,
from the inquiries which I have made, I doubt whether a

among the Booksellers is, That when Drelincourt's Consola-

Published about the same time by Peniberton and
Brown. And by the Author of this Journev was written,
A Journey through the Austrian Netherlands, which wa"s pub-

l who
\vho mistake the Journey of the one Author for the Tour of
the other.

Edition, 1739; and Sixth Edition, 1770.—When this was
a second time printed, it was entitled simply The Hijiory of
the Devil. "This Second Edition, fays De Foe, notwith-
standing a large Impression of the first, is a Certificate from
the Wor!d of its general Acceptation. The wife World has
been pleased with it, the merry World has been diverted
with it, and the ignor.mt World has been taught by it;
and none but the malicious part of the World has been of-
fended at it: Who can wonder, that when the Devil is
not pleased, his Friends should be angry!" Preface. Yet, in
subsequent Editions the original Title is restored.

C3* The Union between England and Scotland,
being an extremely interesting Event, has led the
Publisher to imagine, that a new Edition of this
Work of De Foe, which is grown very scarce,
would be acceptable to the Public, especially at
the present Time, when the Situation of Affairs
in Ireland induces many Persons to wifli that a
similar Unicn between Great Britain and that
Kingdom may take Place; as it may cause such
an .Union, . if not to be effected, at least to be pro-
posed, and to become, for a Time, the Subject
of Debate in both Countries.

PREFACE.
f"Tp HE success the former part of this Work
has met with in the world, has yet been
no other than is acknowledged to be due to
the surprising variety of the subject, and to
the agreeable manner of the performance.
All the endeavours of envious people to re-
proach it with being a romance, to search it
for errors in geography, inconsistency in the
relation, and contradictions in the fact, have
proved abortive, and as impotent as mali-
cious.
The just application of every Incident, th<*
religious and useful inferences drawn from
every part, are so many testimonies to the
good design of making it public, and must
legitimate all the part that may be called in-
vention or parable in the story.
Vol. II. A The
The Second Part, if the Editor's opinion
may pass, is (contrary to the usage of Second
Parts) every way as entertaining as the First;
contains as strange and surprising incidents,
and as great a variety of them; nor is the
application less serious or suitable; and doubt-
less will, to the sober, as well as the ingenious
Reader, be every way as profitable and di-
verting; and this makes the abridging this
Work as scandalous, as it is knavish and ridi-
culous. Seeing, to shorten the Book, that they
may seem to reduce the value, they strip it of
all those reflections, as well religious as moral,
which are not only the greatest beauties of the
Work, but are calculated for the infinite ad-
vantage of the Reader.
By this, they leave the Work naked of its
brightest ornaments; and yet they would (at
the same time they pretend that the Author
has supplied his story out of his invention)
take from it the improvement, which alone
recommends that invention to wife and good
men.
The injury these men do to the Propri-
etors of Works, is a practice all honest
4 men
men abhor; and they believe they may chal-
lenge them' to shew the disference between that
and robbing on the highway, or breaking open
a house.
If they cannot shew any difference in the
crime, they will find it hard to shew why
there should be any difference in the punish-
ment.

ROBINSON CRUSOE,
HAT homely proverb used on so many occa-
-T sions in England, viz,. That what is bred in the
hone will not go out of the Jlesh, was never more verisied
than in the story of my LIFE. Any one would think,
that after thirty-five years asfliction, and a variety of
unhappy circumstances, which few men, if any, ever
went through before, and after near seven years of
peace and enjoyment in the fulness of all things;
grown old, and when, if ever, it might be allowed
me to have had experience of every state of middle
life, and to know which was most adapted to make
a man compleatly happy; I say, after all this, any
one would have thought that the native propensity to
rambling, which I gave an account of in my first
setting out into the world to have been so predomi-

nate in my thoughts, should be worn out, the volatifc
part be fully evacuated, or at least condensed, and I
might at 61 years of age have been a little inclined to
stay at home, and have done venturing life and for-
4 LIFE AND ADVENTURES
Nay sarther, the common motive of foreign ad-
ventures was taken away in me; for I had no fortune
to make, I had nothing to seek: If I had gained ten
thousand pounds, I had been no richer; for I had
already sufficient for me, and for those I had to leave
it to; and that I had was visibly increasing; for
having no great samily, I could not spend the income
of what I had, unless I would set up for an expensive
way of living, such as a'great samily, servants,
equipage, gaiety, and the like, which were things I
had no notion of, or inclination to; so that I had
nothing indeed to do but to sit still, and fully enjoy
what I had get, and see it increase daily upon my
hands.
Yet all these things had no effect upon me, or at
least not enough to resist the strong inclination I
had to go abroad again, which hung about me like a
chronical distemper; particularly the defire of seeing
my new plantation in the island, and the colony I left
there, run in my head continually. I dreamed of it
all night, and my imagination run upon it all day;
it was uppermost in all my thoughts, and my sancy
worked so steadily and strongly upon it, that I talked
of it in my fleep; in short, nothing could remove it
out of my mind; it even broke so violently into all
my discourses, that it made my conversation tiresome;
for I could talk of nothing else, all my discourse run
into it, even to impertinence, and I saw it myself.
I kavg
T have often heard persons of good judgment say,
that all the stir people make in the world about
ghosts and apparitions, is owing to the strength of
imagination, and the powerful operation of sancy
in their minds; that there is no such thing as a spirit
appearing, or a ghost walking, and the like; that
people's poring affectionately upon the past conversa-
tion of their deceased friends so realises it to them,
that they are capable of sancying upon some extra-
ordinary circumstances that they fee them, talk, to
them, and are answered by them, when, in truth,
there is nothing but shadow and vapour in the thing;
and they really know nothing of the matter.
For my part, I know not to this hour whether
there are any such things as real apparitions, spectres,
or walking of people after they are dead, or whether
there is any thing in the stories they tell us of that
kind, more than the product of vapours, sick minds,
and wandering sancies: But this I know, that my
imagination worked up to such a height, and brought
me into such excess of vapours, or what else I may
call it, that I actually supposed myself often-times
upon the spot, at my old castle behind the trees, saw
my old Spaniard, Friday's sather, and the reprobate
sailors whom I left upon theisland; nay, I sancied I talk-
ed with them, and looked at them so steadily, though
I was broad awake, as at persons just before me; and
this I did till I often frightened myself with the images
my sancy represented to me: one time in my fleep I
had the villainy of the three pirate sailors so lively relat-
ed to me by the first Spaniard and Fry day's sather, that
it was surprizing; they told me how they barbarously
attempted to murder all the Spaniards, and that they
B 2 set
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
set fire to the provisions they had laid up, on pur-
pose to distress and starve them, things that I had
never heard of, and that were yet all of them
true in sact: but it was so warm in my imagina-
tion, and so realized to me, that to the hour I saw
them, I could not be persuaded but that it was or
would be true; also, how I resented it when the
Spaniard complained to me, and how I brought them
to justice, tried them before me, and ordered them
1 all three to be hanged: what there was really in this,
shall be seen in its place: for however I came to form
such things in my dream, and what secret converse
of spirits injected it, yet there was, I say, very much
of it true. I own, that this dream had nothing
literally and specifically true: but the general part
was so true, the base and villainous behaviour of these
three hardened rogues was such, and had been so
much worse than all I can describe, that the dream
had too much similitude of the fact, and as I would
afterwards have punished them severely; so if I had
hanged them all, I had been much in the right, and
should have been justifiable both by the laws of God
and man.
But to return to my story. In this kind of temper
I had lived some years; I had no enjoyment of my
life, no pleasant hours, no agreeable diversion but
what had something or other of this in it, so that
my wife, who saw my mind so wholly bent upon it,
told me very scriously one night, that she believed
there was some secret powerful impulse of Providence
upon me, which had determined me to go thither
again; and that she found nothing hindred my going
but my being engaged to.a wife and children. She
told
5
told me, that it was true she could not think of part-
ing with me; but as she was assured, that if she was
dead it would be the first thing I would do; so, as
it seemed to her that the thing was determined above,
she would not be the only obstruction: for if I
thought sit, and resolved to go here she found
me very intent upon her words, and that I looked
very earnestly at her; so that it a little disordered her,
and she stopped. I asked her why she did not go on,
and say out what she was going to say? But I per-
ceived her heart was too full, and some tears stood in
her eyes: Speak out my dear, said I, are you willing
I should go? No, says she, very affectionately, I am sar
from willing: but if you are resolved to go, says she,
and rather than I will be the only hindrance, I will
go with you; for though I think it a preposte-
rous thing for one of your years, and in your condi-
tion, yet if it must be, said she again, weeping, I
won't leave you; for if it be of heaven, you must
do it; there is no resisting it; and if heaven makes
it your duty to go, he will also make it mine to go
with you, or otherwise dispose of me, that I may
not obstruct it.
This affectionate behaviour of my wife brought
me a little out of the vapours, and I began to consider
what I was doing; I corrected my wandering sancy,
and began to argue with myself sedately, what busi-
ness I had, after threescore years, and after such a
life of tedious sufferings and disasters, and closed in
so happy and easy a manner, I say, what business
had I to rush into new hazards, and put myself upon
adventures, fit only for youth and poverty to run.
into?
B 3 With
"With those thoughts, I considered my new engage-
ment; that I had a wife, one child born, and my
Wife then great with child of another; that I had
all the world could give me, and had no need to seek
hazards for gain; that I was declining in years, and
ought to think rather of leaving what I had gained,
than of seeking to increase it; that as to what my
wife had said, of its being an impulse from heaven,
and that it should be my duty to go, I had no notion
of that; so after many of these cogitations, I strug-
gled with the power of my imagination, reasoned my-
self out of it, as I believe people may always do in like
eases, if they will; and, in a word, I conquered it;
composed myself with such arguments as occurred to
my thoughts, and which my present condition fur-
nished me plentifully with; and particularly, as the
most effectual method, I resolved to divert myself
with other things, and to engage in some business
that might effectually tie me up from any more
excursions of this kind; for I found the thing return
upon me chiefly when I was idle, had nothing to do,
or any thing of moment immediately before me.
To this purpose I bought a little sarm in the coun-
ty of Bedford, and resolved to remove myself thither.
I had a little convenient house upon it, and the land
about it I found was capable of great improvement,
and that it was many ways suited to my inclination,
which delighted in cultivating, managing, planting
and improving of land; and particularly, being an
inland country, I was removed from conversing
among ships, sailors, and things relating to the re-
mote part of the world.
In
In a word, I went down to my sarm, settled my
family, bought me ploughs, harrows, a cart, waggon,
horses, cows, sheep; and setting seriously to work,
became in one half year a meer country gentleman;
my thoughts were entirely taken up in managing my
servants, cultivating the ground, enclosing, planting,
&c. and I lived, as I thought, the most agreeable
life that nature was capable of directing, or that a
man always bred to misfortunes was capable of being
retreated to.
I sarmed upon my own land, I had no rent to
pay, was limited by no articles; I could pull up or
cut down as I pleased: what I planted was for my-
self, and what I improved, was for my samily; and
having thus left osf the thoughts of wandering, I had
not the least discomfort in any part of my life, as to this
world. Now I thought indeed, that I enjoyed the
middle state of life which my sather so earnestly re-
commended to me, a kind of heavenly life, some-
thing like what is described by the poet upon the
subject of a country life,
Free from vices, free from care,
Age has no pains, and youth no snare.
But in the middle of all this felicity, one blow
from unforeseen Providence unhinged me at once;
and not only made a breach upon me, inevitable and
incurable, but drove me, by its consequence, upon
a deep relapse into the wandering disposition; which,
as I may say, being born in my very blood, soon re-
covered its hold of me, and, like the returns of a
violent distemper, came on with an irresistible force
upon me; so that nothing could make any more
B 4 impression.
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
impression upon me. This blow was the loss of
my wife.
It is not my business here to write an elegy upon
my wife, to give a character of her particular virtues,
and make my court to the sex by the flattery of a
funeral sermon. She was, in a few words, the stay
of all my affairs, the center of all my enterprizes,
the engine that by her prudence reduced me to that
happy compass I was in, from the most extravagant
and ruinous project that fluttered in my head as
above; and did more to guide my rambling genius,
than a mother's tears, a sather's instructions, a friend's
counsel, or all my own reasoning powers could do.
I was happy in listening to her tears, and in being
moved by her entreaties, and to the last degree deso-
late and dislocated in the world by the loss of her.
When she was gone, the world looked aukwardly
round me; I was as much a stranger in it, in my
thoughts, as I was in the Brasils when I went first
on shore there; and as much alone, except as to the
assistance of servants, as I was in my island. I knew
neither what to do, or what not to do. I saw the
world busy round me, one part labouring for bread,
and the other part squandring in vile excesses or
empty pleasures, equally miserable, because the end
they proposed still fled from them; for the men of
pleasure every day surfeited of their vice, and heaped
up work for sorrow and repentance; and the men
of labour spent their strength in daily strugglings for
breath to maintain the vital strength they laboured
with, so living in a daily circulation of sorrow, living
but to work, and working but to live, as if daily
bread
9
bread were the only end of a wearisome life, and a
wearisome life the only occasion of daily bread.
This put me in mind of the life I lived in my
kingdom, the island; where I suffered no more corn
to grow, because I did not want it; and bred no
more goats, because I had no more use for them:
where the money lay in the drawer till it grew
mildewed, and had scarce the savour to be looked
upon in 20 years.
All these things, had I improved them as I ought
to have done, and as reason and religion had dictated
to me, would have taught me to search sarther than
human enjoyments for a full felicity, and that there
was something which certainly was the reason and
end of life, superior to all these things, and which
was either to be possessed, or at least hoped for, on
this fide the grave.
But my sage counsellor was gone; I was like a ship
without a pilot, that could only run before the wind:
my thoughts run all away again into the old affair, my
head was quite turned with the whimsies of foreign
adventures; and all the pleasing innocent amusements
of my sarm, and my garden, my cattle, and my
samily, which before entirely poffest me, were no-
thing to me, had no relish, and were like music to
one that has no ear, or food to one that has no taste:
In a word, I resolved to leave off house-keeping, lett
my sarm, and return to London; and in a few
months after I did so.
When I came to London, I was still as uneasy as
before i I had no relish to the place, no employ-
ment in it, nothing to do but to saunter about like
an idle person, of whom it may be said, he is per-
fectly useless in God's creation and it is not one
farthing
sarthing matter to the rest of his kind, whether he
be dead or alive. This also was the thing which of all
circumstances of life was the most my aversion, who
had been all my days used to an active life; and
I would often fay to myself, A slate of idleness is the
.very dregs of life; and indeed I thought I was much
more suitably employed, when I was 26 days
making me a deal board.
It was now the beginning of the year 1693, wnen
my nephew, whom as I have observed before I had
brought up to the sea, and had made him commander
of a ship, was come home from a short voyage to
Bilboa, being the first he had made; he came
to me, and told me, that some merchants of his
acquaintance had been proposing to him to go a
voyage for them to the East Indies and to China, as
private traders: and now uncle, says he, if you will
go to sea with me, I'll engage to land you upon your
old habitation in the island, for we arc to touch at
the Brasils.
Nothing can be a greater demonstration of a future
state, and of the existence of an invisible world, than
the concurrence of second causes with the ideas of
things which we form in our minds, perfectly re-
served, and not communicated to any in the world.
My nephew knew nothing how sar my distemper
of wandering was returned upon me, and I knew
nothing of what he had in his thoughts to say, when
that very morning before he came to me I had, in
a great deal of confusion of thought, and revolving
every part of my circumstances in my mind, come
to this resolution, viz. That I would go to Lisbon,
and consult with my old sea-captain; and so, if it was
rational
rational and practicable, I would go and see the
island again, and see what was become of my people
there. I had pleased myself also with the thoughts of
peopling the place, and carrying inhabitants from
hence, getting a patent for the possession, and I know
not what; when, in the middle of all this, in comes
my nephew, as 1 have said, with his project of carry-
ing me thither, in his way to the Eqsl Indies.
I paused a while at his words, and looking steadily
at him, What Devil, said I, sent you of this unlucky
errand? My nephew startled, as if he had been
frighted at first; but perceiving I was not much dis-
pleased with the proposal, he recovered himself. I
hope it may not be an unlucky proposal, Sir, says he;
I dare say you would be pleased to see your new co-
lony there, where you once reigned with more felicity
than most of your brother monarchs in the world.
In a word, the scheme hit so exactly with my tem-
per, that is to say, with the prepossession I was under,
and of which I have said so much, that I told him,
in few words, if he agreed with the merchants, I
would go with him: but I told him, I would not
promise to go any sarther than my own island. Why
Sir, says he, you don't want to be left there again,
I hope? Why, said I, can you not take me up again
in your return? he told me, it could not be possible
that the merchants would allow him to come that way
with a loaden ship of such value, it being a month's
sail out of his way, and might be three or four:
Besides, Sir, if I should miscarry, said he, and not
return at all, then you would be just reduced to
the condition you were in before.
This
This was very rational; but we both found out a
remedy for it, which was to carry a framed sloop on
board the ship, which, being taken in pieces and
shipped on board the ship, might, by the help of
some carpenters, who we agreed to carry with us,
be set up again in the island, and finished, fit to go
to sea in a few days.
I was not long resolving; for indeed the importu-
nities of my nephew joined in so effectually with my
inclination, that nothing could oppose me: on the
other hand, my wife being dead, I had nobody con-
cerned themselves so much for me, as to persuade
me one way or other, except my ancient good friend
the widow, who earnestly struggled with me to con-
sider my years, my easy circumstances, and the
needless hazard of a long voyage; and, above all,
my young children: but it was all to no purpose; I
had an irresistible defire to the voyage; and I told her
I thought there was something so uncommon in the
impressions I had upon my mind for the voyage, that
it would be a kind of resisting Providence, if I should
attempt to stay at home; after which me ceased her
expostulations, and joined with me, not only in
making provision for my voyage, but also in settling
my samily affairs in my absence, and providing for
the education of my children.'
In order to this, I made my will, and settled the
estate I had in such a manner for my children, and
placed in such hands, that I was perfectly easy and
satisfied they would have justice done them, what-
ever might besal me; and for their education, I left
it wholly to my widow, with a fuflicient maintenence
to herself for her care: all which she richly deserved;
for
for no mother could have taken more care in their
education, or understood it better; and as stie lived
till I came home, I also lived to thank her for it.
My nephew was ready to sail about the beginning
of "January 1694-5, and I with my man Friday went
on board in the Downs the 8th, having besides that
sloop which I mentioned above, a very considerable
cargo of all kinds of necessary things for my colony,
which, if I did not find in good condition, I resolved
to leave so.
First, I carried with me some servants, whom I pur-
posed to place there, as inhabitants, or at least to set
on work there upon my own account, while I stayed,
tind either to leave them there, or carry them for-
ward, as they should appear willing; particularly, I
carried two carpenters, a smith, and a very handy
ingenious fellow who was a cooper by trade, but
was also a general mechanick; for he was dextrous
at making wheels, and hand-mills to grind corn, was
a good turner, and a good pot maker; he also made
any thing that was proper to make of earth, or of
wood; in a word, we called him our Jack of all
trades.
With these I carried a taylor, who had offered
himself to go passenger to the East Indies with my
nephew, but afterwards consented to stay on our new
plantation, and proved a most necessary handy fellow
as could be defired, in many other businesses besides
that of this trade; for, as I observed formerly, neces-
sity arms us for all employments.
My cargo, as near as I can recollect, for I have
not kept an account of the particulars, consisted of a
sufficient quantity of linen, and some thin Englisb
stuffs
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
stusfs for cloathing the Spaniards that I expected to
find there, and enough of them as by my calculation
might comfortably supply them for seven years; if I
remember right, the materials which I carriedforcloath-
ing them, with gloves, hats, shoes, stockings, and all
such things as they could want for wearing, amount-
ed to above 200 pounds, including some beds, bed-
ding, and houshold-stusf, particularly kitchen uten-
sils, with pots, kettles, pewter, brass, Szc. besides near
a hundred pounds more in iron-work, nails, tools of
every kind, staples, hooks, hinges, and every neces-
sary thing I could think of.
I carried also a hundred spare arms, muskets, and
fuzees, besides some pistols, a considerable quantity
of shot of all sizes, three or four tons of lead, and
two pieces of brass cannon; and because I knew not
what time, and what extremities I was providing for,
I carried an hundred barrels of powder, besides
swords, cutlasses, and the iron part of some pikes,
and halberts; so that in short we had a large maga-
zine of all sorts of stores; and I made my nephew
carry two small quarter-deck guns more than he
wanted for his ship, to leave behind, if there was
occasion; that when they came there, we might build
a fort, and man it against all sorts of enemies: and
indeed, I at first thought there would be need enough
of it all, and much more, if we hoped to maintain
our possession of the island, as shall be seen in the
course of the story.
I had not such bad luck in this voyage as I had
been used to meet with; and therefore shall have the
less occasion to interrupt the reader, who perhaps
may be impatient to hear how matters went with
my . colony; yet some odd accidents, cross winds,
and bad Weather happened, on this first setting out,
which made the voyage longer than I expected it at
first; and I, who had never made but one voyage,
(viz.) my first voyage to Guinea, in which I might be
said to come back again as the voyage was at first
designed, began to think the same ill sate still attended
me; and that I was born to be never contented with
being on shore, and yet to be always unfortunate
at sea.
Contrary winds first put us to the northward, and
we were obliged to put in at Galway in Ireland, where
we lay. wind-bound two and thirty days; but we
had this satissaction.with the disaster, that provisions
were here exceeding cheap, and in the utmost plen-
ty; so that while we lay here we never touched
the ship's stores, but rather added to them; here also
I took several hogs, and two cows, with their calves,
which I resolved, if I had a good passage, to put on
shore in my island; but we found occasion to dispose
otherwise of them.
We set out the 5th of February from Ireland, and
had a very sair gale of wind for some days; as I re-
member, it might be about the 20th of February in
the evening late, when the mate having the watch,
came into the round-house, and told us he saw a
flash of fire, and heard a gun fired; and while he was
telling us of it, a boy came in, and told us the boat-
swain heard another. This made us all run out upon
the quarter-deck, where for a while we heard nothing,
but in a few minutes we saw a very great light, and
found that therewas some very terrible fire at a distance;
immediately we had recourse to our reckonings, in
which we all agreed that there could be no land
that
that way, in which the fire shewed itself, no not for
500 leagues, for it appeard at W. N. W. upon this
we concluded it must be some ship on fire at sea; and
as by our hearing the noise of guns just before, we
concluded it could not be sar oft", we stood directly
towards it, and were presently satisfied we should
discover it, because the sarther we sailed the greater
the light appeared, tho' the weather being hazy we
could not perceive any thing but the light for a
while; in about half an hour's sailing, the wind being
sair for us, though not much of it, and the weather
clearing up a little, we could plainly discern that it
was a great ship on fire in the middle of the sea.
I was most sensibly touched with this disaster,
though not at all acquainted with the persons engaged
in it; I presently recollected my former circumstances,
in what condition I was in when taken up by
the Portugal Captain ; and how much more deplorable
the circumstances of the poor creatures belonging to
this ship must be if they had no other ship in company
with them: upon this I immediately ordered, that
five guns should be fired, one soon after another,
that, if possible, we might give notice to them
that there was help for them at hand, and that they
might endeavour to save themselves in their boat;
for though we could fee the flame in the ship, yet
they, it being night, could see nothing of us.
We lay by some time upon this, only driving as
the burning ship drove, waiting for day light; when
on a sudden, to our great terror, though we had
reason to expect it, the ship blew up in the air, and
immediately sunk: this was terrible, and indeed an
asflicting sight, for the sake of the poor men, who, I
concluded,
17
toncluded must be either all destroyed in the ship,
or be in the utmost distress in their boats in the mid-
dle of the ocean, which, at present, by reason it was
dark, I could not see: however to direct them as well
as I could, I caused lights to be hung out in all the
parts of the ship where we could, and which we had
lanthorns for, and kept firing guns all the night
long 5 letting them know by this, that there was a
ship not sar off.
About eight o'clock in the morning, we discovered
the ship's boats, by the help of our perspective-glasses;
and found there were two of them, both thronged
with people, and deep in the water: we perceived
they rowed, the wind being against them; that they
saw our ship, and did the utmost to make us fee
them.
We immediately spread our ancient, to let them
know we saw them; and hung a waft out, as a sig-
nal for them to come on board; and then made more
fail, standing directly to them. In a little more than
half an hour, we came up with them, and, in a
word, took them all in, being no less than sixty-
four men, women, and children; for there were a
great many passengers.
Upon the whole, we found it was a French mer-
chant-ship of 300 tons, homeward-bound from
Quebeck, in the river of Canada. The master gave
us a long account of the distress of his ship, how the
fire began in the steerage by the negligence of the
steersman; but, on his crying out for help, was, as
every body thought, entirely put out: but they soon
found that some sparks of the first fire had gotten
into some part of the ship, so disficult to come at,
Vol. II. C that
that they could not effectually quench it; and after-
wards getting in between the timbers, and within
the cieling of the ship, it proceeded into the hold,
and mastered all the skill and all the application
they were able to exert.
They had no more to do then but to get into their
boats, which, to their great comfort, were pretty
large;- being their long boat, and a great shallop,
besides a small skiff, which was of no great service to
them, other than to get some fresh water and provi-
sions into her, after they had secured themselves from
the fire. They had indeed small hope of their lives
by getting into these boats at that distance from any
land; only, a6 they said well, that they were escaped
from the fire, and had a possibility, that some ship
might happen to be at sea, and might take them in.
They had sails, oars, and a compass; and were pre-
paring to make the best of their way to Newfound-
land, the wind blowing pretty sair; for it blew an
easy gale at S. E. by E. They had as much provi-
sions and water, as, with sparing it so as to be next
door to starving, might support them about 12 days;
in which, if they had no bad weather, and no con-
trary winds, the captain said, he hoped he might get
to the banks of Newfoundland, and might perhaps
take some sifli to sustain them till they might go on
shore. But there were so many chances against them
in all these cases; such as storms to overset and foun-
der them; rains and cold to benumb and perish their
limbs; contrary winds to keep them out and starve
them; that it must have been next to miraculous if
they had escaped.
In the midst os their consultations, every one being
hopeless, and ready to despair, the captain with tears
in
in his eyes told me, they were on a sudden surprised
with the joy of hearing a gun fire, and after that
four more; these were the five guns which I caused
to be fired at first seeing the light: this revived their
hearts, and gave them the notice, which, as above,
I designed it should, viz. that there was a ship at
hand for their help.
It was upon the hearing these guns, that they took
down their masts and fails; and the found coming
from the windward, they resolved to lie by till
morning. Some time after this, hearing no more
guns, they fired three musquets, one a considerable
while after another; but these, the wind being con-
trary, we never heard.
Some time after that again, they were still more
agreeably surprised with seeing our lights, and hear-
ing the guns, which, as I have said, I caused to be
fired all the rest of the night; this set them to work
with their oars to keep their boats a-head, at least
that we might the sooner come up with them; and
at last, to their inexpressible joy, they found we saw
them 4
It is impossible for me to express the several gestures,
the strange ecstasies, the variety of postures, which
these poor delivered people run into, to express the
joy of their fouls at so unexpected a deliverance;
grief and fear are easily described; sighs, tears,
groans, and a very few motions of head and hands,
make up the sum of its variety: but an excess of joy,
a surprise of joy, has a thousand extravagancies in it;
there were some in tears, some raging and tearing
themselves, as if they had been in the greatest agonies
of sorrow; some stark raving and down-right luna-
C 2 tic;
tic; some ran about the ship stamping with their
feet, others wringing their hands; some were
dancing, several singing, some laughing, more cry-
ing; many quite dumb, not able to speak a word;
others side and vomiting, several swooning, and
ready to saint; and a few were crossing themselves
and giving God thanks.
I would not wrong them neither; there might be
many that were thankful afterward; but the passion
was too strong for them at sirst, and they were not
able to master it; they were thrown into ecstasies and
a kind of frenzy, and so there were but a very few
who were composed and serious in their joy.
Perhaps also the case may have some addition to it,
from the particular circumstance of the nation they
belonged to; I mean the French, whose temper is
allowed to be more volatile, more passionate, and
more sprightly, and their spirits more fluid, than of
other nations. I am not philosopher to determine
the cause, but nothing I had ever seen before came
up to it: the ecstasies poor Friday, my trusty savage,
was in, when he found his sather in the boat, came
the nearest to it; and the surprise of the master, and
his two companions, whom I delivered from the two
villains that set them on more in the island, came a
little way towards it; but nothing was to compare
to this, either that I saw in Friday, or any where else
in my life.
It is sarther observable, that these extravagancies
d'd not show themselves in that different manner I
have mentioned, in disferent persons only: but all
the variety would appear in a short succession of mo-
ments, in one and the fame person. A man that we
saw
21
sow this minute dumb, and, as it were, stupid and
confounded, mould the next minute be dancing and
hallooing like an antick; and the next moment a
tearing his hair, or pulling his clothes to pieces, and
stamping them under his sect like a madman; a few
minutes after that, we should have him all in tears,
then sick, then swooning; and had not immediate
help been had, would in a few moments more have
been dead; and thus it was, not with one or two,
or ten or twenty, but with the greatest part of them;
and, if I remember right, our surgeon was obliged to
let above thirty of them blood.
There were two priests among them, one an old
man, and the other a young man; and that which
was strangest was, that the oldest man was the
worst.
As soon as he set his foot on board our ship, and
saw himself safe, he dropped down stone-dead, to all
appearance; not the least sign of life could be per-
ceived in him; our surgeon immediately applied pro-
per remedies to recover him; and was the only man
in the ship that believed he was not dead: and at
length he opened a vein in his arm, having first cha-
fed and rubbed the part, so as to warm it as much
as possible: upon this the blood, which only dropped
at first, flowed something freely; in three minutes
after the man opened his eyes; and about a quarter .
of an hour after that he spoke, grew better, and,
in a little time, quite well; after the blood was stop-
ped, he walked about, told us he was perfectly well,
took a dram of cordial which the surgeon gave him,
and was, what we called, come to himself; about a
quarter of an hour after this, they came running
C 3 into
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
into the cabbin to the surgeon, who was bleeding a
French woman that had sainted; and told him, the
priest was gone Hark mad. It seems" he had began
to revolve the change of his circumstances in his
mind, and this put him into an ecstacy of joy; his
spirits whirled about saster than the vessels could con-
vey them; the blood grew hot and feverish; and the
man was as fit for Bedlam as any creature that ever
was in it; the surgeon would not bleed him again in
that condition, but gave him something to doze and
put him to sleep, which, after some time, operated
upon him, and he waked next morning perfectly
composed, and well.
The younger priest behaved himself with great com-
mand of his passion, and was really an example of a
serious well-governed mind; at his first coming on
board the ship, he threw himself flat on his sace,
prostrating himself in thankfulness for his deliverance;
in which I unhappily and unseasonably disturbed him,
really thinking he had been in a swoon; but he spoke
calmly; thanked me; told me, he was giving God
thanks for his deliverance; begged me to leave him
a few moments, and that, next to his Maker, he
would give me thanks also.
I was heartily sorry that I disturbed him; and not
only left him, but kept others from interrupting him
also; he continued in that posture about three
minutes, or a little more, after I left him; then came
to me, as he had said he would, and, with a great
deal of seriousness and affection, but with tears in
his eyes, thanked me, that had, under God, given
him and so many miserable creatures their lives:
I told him, I had no room to move him to thank
God
God for it, rather than me; for I had seen, that he
had done that already: but I added, that it was
nothing but what reason and humanity dictated to
all men, and that we had as much reason as he to
give thanks to God, who had blessed us so sar as to
make us the instruments of his mercy to so many of
his creatures.
After this the young priest applied himself to his
country folks; laboured to compose them; persuaded
intreated, argued, reasoned with them, and did his
utmost tokcep them within the exercise of their rea-
son; and with some he had success, though others
were, for a time, out of all government of
themselves.
I cannot help committing this to writing, as per-
haps it may be useful to those into whose hands it
may sall, in the guiding themselves in all the extrava-
gancies of their paflions; for if an excess of joy can
carry men out to such a length beyond the reach of
their reason, what will not the extravagancies of
anger, rage, and a provoked mind, carry us to?
And indeed, here I saw reason for keeping an ex-
ceeding watch over our passions of every kind, as
well those of joy and satissaction, as those of sorrow
and anger.
We were something disordered by these extrava-
gancies among our new guests for the first day; but
when they had been retired, lodgings provided for
them as well as our ship would allow, and they had
slept heartily, as most of them did, being satigued
and frightened, they were quite another sort of peo-
ple the next day.
C 4 Nothing
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
Nothing of good manners, or civil acknow-
ledgments for the kindness shewn them was wanting;
the French, it is known, are naturally apt enough
to exceed that way. The captain, and one of the
priests, came to me the next day; and, desiring to
speak with me and my nephew, the commander,
began to consult with us what should be done with
them; and first they told us, that, as we had saved
their lives, so all they had was little enough for a
return to us for the kindness received. The captain
said, they had saved some money, and some things
of value in their boats, catched hastily out of the
flames; and if we would accept it, they were ordered
to make an osfer of it all to us; they only defired to
be set on shore somewhere in our way, where, if
possible, they might get a passage to France.
My nephew was for accepting their money at first
word, and to consider what to do with them after-
wards; but I over-ruled him in that part; for I knew
what it was to be set on ftore in a strange country;
and if the Portugal captain that took me up at sea
had served me so, and took all I had for my delive-
rance, I must have starved, or have been as much a
slave at the Brasilf, as I had been at Barbary, the
being fold to a Mahometan only excepted; and per-
haps a Portuguese is not a much better master than a
Turk, if not, in some cases, a much worse.
I therefore told the French captain, that we had
taken them up in their distress, it was true; but that
it was out duty to do so, as we we;e sellow-creatures,
and as we would defire to be so delivered, if we were
in the like or any other extremity; that we had done
nothing for them, but what we believed they would
have
*5
have done for us if we had been in their case, and
they in our's; but that we took them up to serve them,
not to plunder them; and that it would be a most bar-
barous thing, to take that little from them which they
had saved out of the fire, and then set them on shore,
and leave them; that this would be first to save
them from death, and then kill them ourselves; save
ihem from drowning, and then abandon them to
starving; and therefore I would not let the least
thing be taken from them: as to setting them on
shore, I told them indeed, that was an exceeding
difficulty to us, for that the ship was bound to the
East-Indics; and though w e were driven out of our
course to the westward a very great way, which per-
haps was directed by heaven on purpose for their de-
liverance, yet it was impossible for us wilfully to
change our voyage on this particular account; nor
could my nephew, the captain, answer it to the
freighters, with whom he was under charter-party to
pursue his voyage by the way of Brastl; and all I
knew he could do for them was, to put ourselves in
the way of meeting with other snips homeward-
bound from the West-Indies, and get them passage,
if possible, to England or France.
The first part of the proposal was so generous and
kind, they could not but be very thankful for it; but
they were in a great consternation, especially the pas-
sengers, at the notion of being carried away to the
East-Indies: they then intreated me, that seeing I
was driven so sar to the westward before I met with
them, I would at least keep on the same course to the
banks of 'Newfoundland, where it was possible I might
meet with some ship or sloop that they might hire to
carry them back to Canada, from whence they came.
I thought
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
I thought this was but a reasonable request on their
part; and therefore I inclined to agree to it; for in-
deed I considered, that to carry this whole company
to the East-Indies, would not only be an intolerable
severity to the poor people, but would be ruining our
whole voyage by devouring all our provisions; so I
thought it no breach of charter-party, but what an
unforeseen accident made absolutely necessary to us;
and in which no one could fay we were to blame;
for the laws of God and nature would have forbid,
that we should refuse to take up two boats full of
people in such a distressed condition; and the nature
of the thing as well respecting ourselves, as the poor
people, obliged us to fee them on shore somewhere
or other, for their deliverance; so I consented that
we would carry them to Newfoundland, if wind and
weather would permit; and, if nor, that I would
carry them to Mariinico in the IVcst-Indies.
The wind continued fresh easterly, but the wea-
ther pretty good; and as it had blov. ed continually
in the points between N. E. and S. E. a long time,
we miffed several opportunities of fending them to
France; for we met several ships bound to Europe,
whereof two were French, from St. Christopher's;
but they had been so long beating up against the
wind, that they durst take in no passengers for fear
of wanting provisions for the voyage, as well for
themselves as for those they should take in; so we
were obliged to go on. It was about a week after this,
that we made the Banks of Newfoundland, where, to
shorten my story, we put all our French people on
board a bark, which they hired at sea there, to put
them on more, and afterwards to carry them to
France,
27
France, if they could get provisions to victual them-
selves with: when, I say, all the French went on
shore, I mould remember, that the young priest I
spoke of, hearing we were bound to the Eqsl Indies,
desired to go the voyage with us, and to be set on
shore on the coast of Coromandel: I readily agreed to
that; for I wonderfully liked the man, and had very
good reason, as will appear afterwards; also four of
the seamen entered themselves in our ship, and pro-
ved very useful fellows.
From hence we directed our course for the West-
Indies, steering away S. and S. by E, for about 20
days together, sometimes little or no wind at all,
when we met with another subject for our humanity
to work upon, almost as deplorable as that before.
It was in the latitude of 27 degrees 5 minutes N.
and the 19th day of March, 1684-5, when we espied
a sail, our course S. E. and by S. We soon perceived
it was a large vessel, and that she bore up to us; but
could not at first know what to make of her, till, after
coming a little nearer, we found she had lost her
main-top-mast, sore-mast, and bowsprit; and pre-
sently she fires a gun as a signal of distress; the wea-
ther was pretty good, wind at N. N. W. a fresh gale,
and we soon came to speak with her.
We found her a ship of Bristol bound home from
Barbadocs, but had been blown out of the road at
Barbadoes, a few days before she was ready to sail, by
a terrible hurricane, while the captain and chief mate
were both gone on shore; so that beside the terror of
the storm, they were but in an indifferent case for
good artists to bring the ship home; they had been
already nine weeks at sea, and had met with another
terrible
terrible storm after the hurricane was over, which
had blown them quite out of their knowledge to the
westward, and in which they had lost their masts, as
above; they told us, they expected to have seen the
Bahama islands, but were then driven away again to
the south-east by a strong gale of wind at N. N. W.
the same that blew now, and having no sails to work
the ship with, but a main-course, and a kind of
square sail upon a jury fore-mast, which they had set
np, they could not lie near the wind, but were en-
deavouring to stand away for the Canaries.
But that which was worst of all, was, that they
were almost starved for want of provisions, besides
the fatigues they had undergone; their bread and
flesh was quite gone, they had not an ounce left in
the ship, and had had none for eleven days; the
only relief they had, was, their water was not all
spent, and they had about half a barrel of Hour left;
they had sugar enough; some succades or sweet-meats
they had at first, but they were devoured, and they
had seven casks of rum.
There was a youth and his mother, and a maid-ser-
vant, on board, who were going passengers, and
thinking the ship was ready to sail, unhappily came
on board the evening before the hurricane began;
and, having no provisions of their own left, they
were in a more deplorable condition than the rest;
for the seamen, being reduced to such an extreme
necessity themselves, had no compassion, we may be
sure, for the poor passengers; and they were indeed
in a condition that their misery is very hard to
describe
I had
I had perhaps not known this part, if my curiosity-
had not led me, the weather being sair, and the wind
abated, to go on board the ship: the second mate,
who upon this occasion commanded the ship, had
been on board our flup; and he told me indeed,
that they had three passengers in the great cabbin, that
they were in a deplorable condition; nay, says he, I
believe they are dead, for I have heard nothing of
them for above two days; and I was afraid to en-
quire after them, said he, for I had nothing to relieve
them with.
We immediately applied ourselves to give them what
relief we could spare; and indeed I had so sar over-
ruled things with my nephew, that I would have
victualled them, though we had gone away to Ver-
gir.ia, or any part of the coast of America, to have
supplied ourselves; but there was no necessity for
that.
But now they were in a new danger; for they were
afraid of eating two much, even of that little we
gave them; the mate or commander brought six men
with him in his boat; but these poor wretches looked
like skeletons, and were so weak, they could hardly
sit to their oars: the mate himself was very ill, and
half-starved; for he declared he had reserved nothing
from the men, and went share and share alike with
them in every bit they eaL
I cautioned him to eat sparingly, but set meat be-
fore him immediately, and he had not eaten three
mouthfuls before he began to be sick, and out of
order; so he stopt awhile, and our surgeon mixed
him up something with some broth, which he said
would be to him both food and physick; and after
he
he had taken It, he grew better: in the mean time
I forgot not the men; I ordered victuals to be given
them, and the poor creatures rather devoured than
eat it; they were so exceeding hungry, that they
were in a manner ravenous, and had no command
of themselves; and two of them eat with so much
greediness, that they were in danger of their lives
the next morning.
The sight of these people's distress was very moving
to me, and brought to mind what I had a terrible
prospect of at my first coming on shore in my island,
where I had not the least mouthful of food, or any
hopes of procuring it; besides the hourly apprehen-
sion I had of being made the food of other creatures.
But all the while the mate was thus relating to me
the miserable condition of the ship's company, I
could not put out of my thought the story he had
told me of the three poor creatures in the great cabbin;
(viz.) the mother, her son, and the maid servant,
whom he had heard nothing of for two or three days;
and whom he seemed to confess they had wholly neg-
lected, their own extremities being so great; by
which I understood, that they had really given them
no food at all; and that therefore they must be
perished, and be all lying dead perhaps on the floor
or deck of the cabbin.
As I therefore kept the mate, whom we then cal-
led captain, on board with his men to refresh them,
so I also forgot not the starving crew that were left on
board, but ordered my own boat to go on board the
ship, and with my mate and twelve men to carry
them a sack of bread, and four or five pieces of beef
to boil. Our surgeon charged the men to cause the
meat
meat to be boiled while they stayed, and to keep
guard in the cook-room, to prevent the men's taking
it to eat raw, or taking it out of the pot before it
was well boiled, and then to give every man but a
little at a time; and by this caution he preserved the
men, who would otherwise have killed themselves
with that very food that was given them on purpose
to save their lives.
At the fame time, I ordered the mate to go into
the great cabbin, and see in what condition the poor
passengers were in, and, if they were alive, to com-
fort them and give them what refreshment was pro-
per; and the surgeon gave him a large pitcher with
some of the prepared broth which he had given the
mate that was on board, and which he did not ques-
tion would restore them gradually.
I was not satisfied with this; but, as I said above,
having a great mind to see the scene of misery, which
I knew the snip itself would present me with, in a
more lively manner than I could have it by report, I
took the captain of the ship, as we now called him,
with me, and went myself a little after in their
boat.
I found the poor men on board almost in a tumult
to get the victuals out of the boiler before it was
ready: but my mate observed his order, and kept a
good guard at the cock-room door; and the man he
placed there, after using all possible persuasion to
have patience, kept them off by force: however, he
caused some biscuit cakes.to be dipped in the pot,
and softened them with the liquor of the meat, which
they call brewis, and gave them every one one, to
stay their stomachs, and told them it was for their
own
own safety, that he was obliged to give them but
little at a time. But it was all in vain, and had I
not come on board, and their own commander and
officers with me, and with good words, and some
threats also of giving them no more, I believe they
would have broke into the cook-room by force, and
tore the meat out of the furnace; for words indeed
are of a very small force to an hungry belly: however
we pacified them, and fed them gradually and
cautiously for the first time, and the next time gave
them more, and at last silled their bellies, and the
men did well enough.
But the misery of the poor passengers in the cabbin
was of another nature, and sar beyond the rest; for
as, first, the ship's company had so little for them-
selves, it was but too true, that they had at first kept
them very low, and at last totally neglected them;
so that for six or seven days, it might be said, they
had really had no food at all, and for several days
before, very little.
The poor mother, who, as the first mate reported,
was a woman of good fense, and good breeding, had
spared all she could get so affectionately for her son,
that at last she entirely sunk under it: and when the
mate of our ship went in, she set upon the floor or
deck, with her back up against the sides, between
two chairs, which were lashed sast, and her head
sunk in between her shoulders, like a corpse, though
not quite dead. My mate said all he could to revive
and encourage her, and with a spoon put some broth
into her mouth; she opened her lips, and lifted up
one hand, but could not speak: yet she understood
what he said, and made signs to him, intimating,
that
t
that it was too late for her; but pointed to her child,
as if she would have said, they should take care of
him.
However the mate, who was exceedingly moved
with the sight, endeavoured to get some of the broth
into her mouth; and, as he said, got two or three
spoonfuls down, though I question whether he could
be sure of it or not: but it was too late, and she
died the same night.
The youth, who was preserved at the price of his
most affectionate mother's life, was not so sar gone;
yet he lay in a cabin-bed as one stretched out, with
hardly any life left in him; he had a piece of an old
glove in his mouth, having eaten up the rest of it;
however, being young, and having more strength
than his mother, the mate got something down his
throat, and he began sensibly to revive, though, by
giving him some time after but two or three spoon-
fuls extraordinary, he was very sick, and brought
it up again*
But the next care was the poor maid; she lay all
along upon the deck hard by her mistress, and just
like one that had sallen down with an apoplexy, and
struggled for life: hei limbs were distorted, one of her
hands was clasped round the frame of one chair, and
Ihe griped it so hard, that we could not easily make
her let it go; her other arm lay over her head, and
her feet lay both together, set sast against the frame
of the cabin-table; in short, she lay just like one in
the last agonies of death; and yet she was alive too.
The poor creature was not only starved with
hunger, and terrified with the thoughts of death,
but, as the men told us afterwards, was broken-
Vol. II. D hearted
hearted for her mistress, whom she saw dying two
or three days before, and whom she loved most
tenderly.
We knew not what to do with this poor girl; for
when our surgeon, who was a man of very great
knowledge and experience, and with great applica-
tion recovered her as to life, he had her upon his
hand as to her fenses, for Ike was little less than
distracted for a considerable time after; as snall ap-
pear presently.
Whoever shall read these memorandums, must be
desired to consider, that visits at sea are not like a
journey into the country, where sometimes people
stay a week or a fortnight at a place. Our business
was to relieve this distressed ship's crew, but not lie
by for them; and though they were willing to steer
the same course with us for some days, yet we could
carry no sail to keep pace with a ship that had no
masts: however, as their captain begged of us to
help him to set up a main top-mast, and a kind of
top-mast to his jury fore-mast, we did, as it were,
lie by him for three or four days, and then having
given him five barrels of beef and pork, two hogsheads
of biscuit, and a proportion of peas, flour, and what
other things we could spare; and taking three casks
of sugar and some rum, and some pieces of eight of
them for satisfaction, we left them, taking on board
with us, at their own earnest request, the youth, and
the maid, and all their goods.
The young lad was about seventeen years of ager
a pretty, well-bred, modest, and sensible youth;
greatly dejected with the loss of his mother, and, as
it seems, had lost his sather but a few months before
at
at Barbadoes. He begged of the surgeon to speak to
me, to take him out of the ship; for he said, the
cruel fellows had murdered his mother; and indeed
so they had, that is to say, passively; for they might
have spared a small sustenance to the poor helpless
widow, that might have preserved her life, though
it had been just to keep her alive. But hunger knows
no friend, no relation, no justice, no right; and
therefore is remorseless, and capable of no com-
passion.
The surgeon told him how far we were going, and
how it would carry him away from all his friends,
and put him perhaps in as bad circumstances, almost,
as we found them in; that is to say, starving in the
world. He said he mattered not whither he went,
if he was but delivered from the terrible crew that
he was among: that the captain (by which he meant
me, for he could know nothing of my nephew) had
saved his life, and he was sure would not hurt him;
and as for the maid, he was sure, if she came to
herself, she would be very thankful for it, let us
carry them whither we would. The surgeon repre-
sented the case so affectionately to me, that I yielded,
and we took them both on board with all their goods,
except eleven hogsheads of sugar, which could not
be removed, or come at; and as the youth had a
bill of lading for them, I made his commander sign
a writing, obliging him to go, as soon as he came to
Bristol, to one Mr. Rogers, a merchant there, to
whom the youth said he was related, and to deli-
ver a letter which I wrote to him, and all the goods
he had belonging to the deceased widow; which I
suppose was not done; for I could never learn that
D 2 the
the ship came to Bristol; but was, as is most probj*
ble, lost at sea, being in so disabled a condition, and
so sar from any land, that I am of opinion, the first
storm she met with afterwards she might founder in
the sea; for she was leaky, and had damage in her
hold when I met with her.
I was now in the latitude of 19 deg. 32 min. and
had hitherto had a tolerable voyage as to weather,
tho' at sirst the winds had been contrary. I shall
trouble nobody with the little incidents of wind,
weather, currents, &c. on the rest of our voyage;
but, shortening my story for the sake of what is to
follow, shall observe, that I came to my old habitation,
the island, on the 10th of April, 1695. It was with
no small difficulty that I found the place; for as I
came to it, and went from it before, on the south
and east side of the island, as coming from the Brasils,
so now coming in between the main and the island,
and having no chart for the coast, nor any land-
mark, I did not know it when I saw it, or know
whether 1 saw it or no.
We beat about a great while, and went on shore
on several islands in the mouth of the great river
Orootwque, but none for my purpose; only this I
learned by my coasting the shore, that I was under
one great mistake before, viz. that the continent
which I thought I saw from the island I lived in,
was really no continent, but a long island, or rather
a ridge of islands reaching from one to the other side
of the extended mouth of that great river; and that
the savages who came to my island, were not pro-
perfy those which we call Caribee*, but islanders, and
other Barbarians of the same kind, who inhabited
something nearer to our side than the rest.
In
In short, I visited several of the islands to no pur-
pose; some I found were inhabited, and seme were
not. On one of them I found some Spaniards, and
thought they had lived there; but speaking with
them, found they had a sloop lay in a small creek
hard by, and that they came thither to make salt,
and catch some pearl-muscles, if they could; but
they belonged to the IJJe de Trinidad, which lay sar-
ther north, in the latitude of loand n degrees.
Thus coasting from one island to another, some-
times with the ship, sometimes with the Frenchman's
shallop (which we had found a convenient boat, and
therefore kept her with their very good will), at
length I came sair on the south-side of my island, and
I presently knew the very countenance of the place;
so I brought the ship safe to an anchor, broadside
with the little creek where was my old habitation.
As soon as I saw the place, I called for Friday,
and asked him, if he knew where he was? He looked
about a little, and presently clapping his hands, cri-
ed, O yes, O there, O yes, O there! pointing to
our old habitation, and fell a dancing and capering
like a mad fellow; and I had much ado to keep him
from jumping into the sea, to swim ashore to the
place.
Well, Friday, said I, do you think we shall sind
any body here, or no? and what do you think, shall
we see your sather? The fellow stood mute as a stock
a good while; but when I named his sather, the
poor affectionate creature looked dejected; and I
could fee the tears run down his sace very plentifully.
"What is the matter Friday, said I? are you troubled
because you may see your sather f No, no, says he,
D 3 shaking
shaking his head, no fee him more, no ever more
fee again. Why so, said I, Friday? how do you
know that? O no, O no, says Friday., he long ago
die; long ago, he much old man. Well, well, said
I, Friday, you don't know: but mall we fee any
one else then: the fellow, it seems, had better eyes
than I, and he points just to the hill above my old
house; and tho' we lay half a league off, he cries out,
Me see! me fee! yes, yes, me see much man there,
and there, and there. I looked, but I could fee no-
body, no, not with a perspective glass; which was,
I suppose, because I could not hit the place; for the
fellow was right, as I found upon enquiry the next
clay, and there were five or six men altogether stood
to look at the ship, not knowing what to think
of us.
As soon as Friday had told me he saw people, I
caused the English ancient to be spread, and fired three
guns, to give them notice we were friends; and
about half a quarter of an hour after, we perceived a
smoke rife from the side of the creek; so I imme-
diately ordered a boat out, taking Friday with me;
and, hanging out a white slag, or a flag of truce, I
went directly on snore, taking with me the young
friar I mentioned, to whom I had told the whole
story of my living there, and the manner of it, and
every particular, both of myself, and those that I
left there; and who was on that account extremely
defirous to go with me. We had besides about six-
teen men very well armed, if we had found any new
guest there which we did not know of; but we had
no need of weapons.
As we went on shore upon the tide of flood, near
high water, we rowed directly into the creek; and
the
39
The sirst man I fixed my eye upon, was the Spaniard
'whose life I had saved, and whom I knew by his face
perfectly well; as to his habit, I sha'.l describe it
afterwards. I ordered nobody to go on shore at first
but myself; but there was no keeping Friday in the
boat: for the affectionate creature had spied his
father at a distance, a good way off of the Spaniards,
where indeed I saw nothing of him; and if they had
not let him go on more, he would have jumped into
the sea. He was no sooner on shore, but he flew
awav to his sather like an arrow out of a bow. It
would have made any man shed tears, in spite of the
firmest resolution, to have seen the first transports of
this poor fellow's joy, when he came to his sather;
how he embraced him, kissed him, streaked his sace,
took him up in his arms, set him down upon a tree,
and lay down by him; then stood and looked at him
as any one would look at a strange picture, for a
quarter of an hour together; then lay down upon
the ground, and streaked his legs, and kissed them,
and then got up again, and stared at him; one would
have thought the fellow bewitched: but it would
have made a dog laugh to fee how the next day his
passion run out another way: in the morning he
walked along the shore, to and-again, with his sather,
several hours, always leading him by the hand, as if
he had been a lady; and every now-and-then would
come to fetch something or other for him from the
boat, either a lump of sugar, or a dram, a biscuit, or
something or other that was good. In the afternoon his
frolics ran another way, for then he would set the old
man down upon the ground, and dance about him,
and made a thousand antic postures and gestures; and
D 4 ' all
all the while he did this, he would be talking to him,
and telling him one story or another of his travels,
and of what had happened to him abroad, to divert
him. In short, if the same filial affection was to be
found in christians to their parents, in our parts of
the world, one would be tempted to say, there hard-
ly would have been any need of the fifth command-
ment.
But this is a digression; I return to my landing.
It would be endless to take notice of all the ceremo-
nies and civilities that the Spaniards received me with*
The first Spaniard, whom, as I said, I knew very well
was he whose life I saved, he came towards the boat,
attended by one more, carrying a flag of truce also;
and he did not only not know me at first, but he had
no thoughts, no notion, of its being me that was
come, till I spoke to him: Seignor, said I, in Portu-
guese, do you not know me? at which he spoke not
a word; but giving his musquet to the man that was
with him, threw his arms abroad, and saying some-
thing in Spanish, that I did not perfectly hear, came
forward, and embraced me, telling me, he was inex-
cusable not to know that sace again that he had
once seen, as of an angel from Heaven sent to save
his life: hesaid abundance of very handsome things,
as a well-bied Spaniard always knows how; and
then beckoning to the person that attended him, bade
him go and call out his comrades. He then asked
me, if I would walk to my old habitation, where
he would give me possession of my own house
again, and where I should see there had been but
mean improvements; so I walked along with him j
but, alas! I could no more find the place again, than
Is I had never been there; for they had planted so
many trees, and placed them in such a posture, so
thick and close to one another, in ten years time
they were grown so big, that, in short, the place was
inaccessible, except by such windings and blind ways,
as they themselves only who made them could sind.
I asked them, what put them upon all these forti-
sications? Me told me, I would say there was need
enough of it, when they had given an account how
they had pasted their time since their arriving in the
island, especially aster they had the misfortune to find
that I was gone: he told me he could not but have
some satissaction in my good fortune, when he heard
that I was gone in a good ship, and to my satissaction;
and that he had oftentimes a strong persuasion, that
one time or other he should see me again: but no-
thing that ever befel him in his life, he said, was so
surprising and afflicting to him at first, as the disap-
pointment he was under when he came back to the
island, and found I was not there.
As to the three Barbarians (so he called them) that
were left behind, and of whom he said he had a long
story to tell me; the Spaniards all thought themselves
much better among the savages, only that their
number was so small. And, says he, had they been
strong enough, we had been all long ago in purga-
tory; and with that he crossed himself upon the
breast. But Sir, says he, I hope you will not be
displeased, when I shall tell you how, forced by
necessity, we were obliged, for our own preservation,
to disarm them, and making them our subjects, who
would not be content with being moderately our
masters, but would be our murderers. I answered, I
was
was heartily afraid of it when I left them there;' and!
nothing troubled me at my parting from the island,
but that they were not come back, that,I might have
put them in possession of every thing first, and left the
other in a state of subjection, as they deserved: but
if they had reduced them to it, I was very glad, and
should be very sar from finding any sault with it;
for I knew they were a parcel of refractory ungo-
vernable villains, and were fit for any manner of
mischief.
While I was saying this, came the man whom he
had sent back, and with him eleven men more: in
the dress they were in, it was impossible to guess what
nation they were of; but he made all clear both to
them and to me. First he turned to me, and pointing
to them, said, These, Sir, are some of the gentlemen
who owe their lives to you; and then turning to
them, and pointing to me, he let them know who I
wasupon which they all came up one by one, not
as if they had been sailors, and ordinary fellows, and
I the like, but really, as if they had been ambassa-
dors or noblemen, and I a monarch, or a great con-
queror: their behaviour was to the last degree
obli'nnc: and courteous, and vet mixed with a manly
majestic gravity, which very well became them; and
in short, they had so much more manners than I,
that I scarce knew how to receive their civilities,
much less how to return them in kind.
The history of their coming to, and conduct in
the island, after my going away, is so remarkable,
and has so many incidents, which the former part of
mv relation will help to understand, and which will,
in most of the particulars, refer to that account I have
already
already given, that I cannot but commit them with
great delight to the reading of those that come after
me.
I mall no longer trouble the story with a relation
in the first person, which will put me to the expence
of ten thousand said I's, and laid he's, and he told
me's, and I told him's, and the like; .but I mall
collect the sacts historically, as near as I can gather
them out of my memory from what they related to
me, and from what I met with in my conversing with
them, and with the place.
In order to do this succinctly, and as intelligibly as
I can, I must go back to the circumstance in which
I left the island, and which the persons were in, of
whom I am to speak. At first, it is necessary to re-
peat, that I had sent away Friday's sather and / the
Spaniard, the two whose lives I had rescued from the
savages; I say, I had sent them away in a large canoe
to the main, as I then thought it, to fetch over
the Spaniard's companions whom he had left behind
him, in order to save them from the like calamity
that he had been in; and in order to succour
them for the present, and that, if possible, we might
together find "some way fer our deliverance after-
ward.
When I sent them away, I had no visible appear-
ance of, cr the least room to hope for, my own de-
liverance, any more than I had twenty years before;
much less had I any foreknowledge of what after hap-
pened, I mean of an English ship coming on shore
there to fetch them off; and it could not but be a
very great surprise to them, when they came back,
pot only to find that I was gone, but to find three
strangers
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
strangers left on the spot, possessed of all that I had1
left behind me, which would otherwise have been
their own.
The first thing, however, which I enquired into,
that I might begin where I left off, was of their own
part: and I defired he would give me a particular
account of his voyage back to his countrymen with
the boat, when I sent him to fetch them over. He
told me there was little variety in that part; for no-
thing remarkable happened to them on the way, they
having very calm weather, and a smooth sea; for his
countrymen, it could not be doubted, he said, but
that they were overjoyed to see him (it seems he
was the principal man among them, the captain of
the vessel they had been shipwrecked in, having been
dead some time): they were, he said, the more sur-
prised to see him, because they knew that he was sal-
len into the hands of savages, who, they were satisfied,
would devour him, as they did all the rest of their
prisoners; that when he told them the story of the
deliverance, and in what manner he was furnished
for carrying them away, it was like a dream to them:
and t'.icir astonishment, they said, was something like
that of Joseph's brethren, when he told them who he
was, and told them the story of his exaltation in
Pharaoh's court: but when he shewed them the arms,
the powder, the ball, and the provisions that he
brought them for their journey or voyage, they were
restored to themselves, took a just mare of the joy of
their deliverance, and immediately prepared to come
away with him.
Their first business was to get canoes; and in this
they were obliged not to stick so much upon the
honest
honest part of it, but to trespass upon their friendly.
savages, and to borrow two large canoes or periagua's,
on pretence of going out a.fishing, or for pleasure.
In these they came away the next morning; it
seems they wanted no time to get themselves ready,
for they had no baggage, neither clothes, or provi-
sions, or any thing in the world, but what they had
on them, and a few roots to eat, of which they used
to make their bread.
They were in all three weeks absent, and in that
time, unluckily for them, I had the occasion offered
for my escape, as I mentioned in my other part, and
to get off from the island; leaving three of the most
impudent, hardened, ungoverned, disagreeable villains
behind me, that any man could defire to meet with,.
to the poor Spaniards great grief and disappointment,
you may be sure.
The only just thing the rogues did, was, that when
the Spaniards came on shore, they gave my letter to
them, and gave them provisions, and other relief, as
I had ordered them to do; also they gave them the
long paper of directions, which I had left with them,
containing the particular methods which I took for
managing every part of my life there; the way how I
baked my bread, bred up my tame goats, and plant-
ed my corn; how I cured my grapes, made my pots,
and, in a word, every thing I did; all this being
written down, they gave to the Spaniards, two of
whom understood Englislj well enough; nor did they
refuse to accommodate the Spaniards with any thing
else, for they agreed very well for some time; they
gave them an equal admission into the house, or cave,
and they began to live very sociably; and the head
Spaniard,
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
Spaniard, who had seen pretty much of my methods
and Friday's sather together, managed all their affairs,
for, as for the Englishmen, they did nothing but ram-
ble about the island, shoot parrots, and catch tortoises,
and when they came home at night, the Spaniards
provided their suppers for them.
The Spaniards would have been satisfied with this,
would the other but have left them alone; which,
however, they could not find in their hearts to do
long; but, like the dog in the manger, they would
not eat themselves, and would not let others eat
neither: the differences, nevertheless, were at first
but trivial, and such as are not worth relating; but
at last it broke out into open war, and it began with
all the rudeness and infolsnce that can be imagined,
without reason, without provocation, contrary to
nature, and indeed to common fense; and though,
it is true, the first relation or it came from the
Spaniards themselves, whom I may call the accusers,
yet when I came to examine the fellows, they could
not deny a word of it.
But before I come to the particulars of this part,
I must supply a defect in my former relation; and
this was, that I forgot to set down among the rest,
that, just as we were weighing the anchor to set sail,
there happened a little quarrel on board our ship,
which I was afraid once would turn to a second mu-
tiny; nor was it appeased till the captain, rousing
up his courage, and taking us all to his assistance,
parted them by force, and making two of the most
refractory fellows prisoners, he laid them in irons;
and as they had been active in the former disorders,
and let fall some up'y dangerous words the second
time,
47
time, he threatened to carry them in irons to Eng-
land, and have them hanged there for mutiny, and
running away with the ship.
This, it seems, though the captain did net intend
to do, it frighted some other men in the ship; and
some of them had put it in the heads of the rest, that
the captain only gave them good words for the pre-
sent, till they should come to some English port; and
that then they mould be all put into a gaol, and tried
for their lives.
The mate got intelligence of this, and acquainted
us with it; upon which it was defired, that I, who
still passed for a great man among them, mould go
down with the mate, and satisfy the men, and tell
them, that they might be assured, if they behaved
well the rest of the voyage, all they had done for the
time past should be pardoned. So I went, and after
passing my honour's word to them, they appeared
easy, and the more so, when I caused the two men,
who were in irons, to be released and forgiven.
But this mutiny had brought us to an anchor for
that night, the wind also salling calm; next morning
we found, that our two men who had been laid in
irons, had stole each of them a musket, and some
other weapons; what powder or shot they had, we
knew not; and had taken the ship's pinnace, which
was not yet haled up, and run away with her to their
companions in roguery on more.
As soon as we found this, I ordered the long-boat
on more, with twelve men and the mate, and away
they went to feck the rogues; but they could neither
find them, nor any of the rest; for they all fled into
the woods, when they saw the boat coming on shore.
The
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
The mate was once resolved, in justice to their
roguery, to have destroyed their plantations, burnt
all their household-stuff and furniture, and left them
to shift without it; but having no order, he let all
alone, lest every thing as they found it, and bringing
the pinnace away, came on board without them.
These two men made their number five; but the
other three villains were so much wickeder than
these, that after they had been two or three days
together, they turned their two new-comers out of
doors to shift for themselves, and would have nothing
to do with them; nor could they, for a good while,
be persuaded to give them any food; as for the Spa-
niards, they were not yet come.
When the Spaniards came first on shore, the busi-
ness began to go forward; the Spaniards would have
persuaded the three English brutes to have taken in
their two countrymen again, that, as they said, they
might be all one samily; but they would not hear of
it: so the two poor fellows lived by themselves, and
finding nothing but industry and application would
make them live comfortable, they pitched their tents
on the north shore of the'island, but a little more to
the west, to be out of the danger of the savages, who
always landed on the east parts of the island.
Here they built two huts, one to lodge in, and
the other to lay up their magazines and stores in;
and the Spaniards having given them some corn for
feed, and especially some of the peas w hich I had left
them, they dug and planted, and inclosed, after the
pattern I had set for them all, and began to live pretty
well; their first crop of corn was on the ground,
.and though it was but a little bit of land which
they
they had dug up at sirst, having had but a little time,
yet it was enough to relieve them, and find them
with bread or other eatables; and one of the fellows,
being the cook's mate of the ship, was very ready at
making soup, puddings, and such other preparations,
as the rice and the milk, and such little slesh as they
got, furnished him to do.
They were going on in a little thriving posture,
when the three unnatural rogues, their own country-
men too, in mere humour, and to insult them, came
and bullied them, and told them the island was
theirs; that the governor, meaning me, had given
them possession of it, and nobody else had any right
to it; and, damn them, they should build no houses
upon their ground, unless they would pay them rent
for them.
The two men thought they had jested at first; and
asked them to come and sit down, and fee what sine
houses they were that they had built, and tell them
what rent they demanded: and one of them merrily
told them, if they were ground-landlords, he hoped
if they built tenements upon the land, and made im-
provements, they would, according to the custom of
all landlords, grant them a long lease; and bid them
go fetch a scrivener to draw the writings. One of
the three, damning and raging, told them, they
should fee they were not in jest; and going to a little
place at a distance, where the honest men had made
a fire to dress their victuals, he takes a fire-brand,
and claps it to the outside of their hut, and very
sairly set it on fire; and it would have been all burnt
down in a few minutes, if one of the two had not
run to the fellow, thrust him away, and trod the fire
OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 49
out w ith his feet, and that not without some difficult
ty too.
The fellow was in such a rage at the honest man's
thrusting him away, that he turned upon him with
a pole he had in his hand; and had not the man
avoided the blow very nimbly, and run into the hut,
he had ended his days at once. His comrade, see-
ing the danger they were both in, ran in after him,
and immediately they came both out with their mus-
kets; and the man that was first struck at with the
pole, knocked the fellow down, who began the
quarrel, with the stock of his musquet, and that
before the other two could come to lvJp him; and
then seeing the rest come at them, they stood toge-
ther, and presenting the other ends of their pieces to
them, bade them stand off.
The others had fire-arms with them too; but one
of the two honest men, bolder than his comrade, and
made desperate by his danger, told them, if they
offered to move hand or foot, they were all dead men;
and boldly commanded them to lay down their arms.
They did not indeed lay down their arms; but, see-
ing him resolute, it brought them to a parley, and
they consented to take their wounded man with them,
and be gone; and indeed, it seems the fellow was
wounded sufficiently with the blow; however, they
were much in the wrong, since they had the advan-
tage, that they did not disarm them effectually, as
they might have done, and have gone immediately
to the Spaniards, and given them an account how
the rogues had treated them; for the three villains
studied nothing but revenge, and every day gave
them some intimation that they did so.
But
51
But not to crowd this part with an account of the
lesser part of their rogueries, such as treading down
their corn, shooting three young kids, and a she-
goat, which the poor men had got to breed up tame
for their store; and, in a word, plaguing them night
and day in this manner, it forced the two men to
such a desperation, that they resolved to fight them
all three the sirst time they had a sair opportunity.
In order to this they resolved to go to the castle, as
they called it, that was my old dwelling, where the
three rogues and the Spaniards all lived together at
that time, intending to have a sair battle, and the
Spaniards should stand by to see sair play. So they
got up in the morning before day, and came to the
place, and called the Englifimcn by their names, tel-
ling a Spaniard that answered, that they wanted to
speak with them.
It happened that the day before two of the Spa-
niards, having been in the woods, had seen one of
the two Englishmen, whom, for distinction, I call the
honest men; and he had made a sad complaint to
the Spatiiards, of the barbarous usage they had met
with from their three countrymen, and how they had
ruined their plantation, and destroyed their corn,
that they had laboured so hard to bring forward, and
killed the milch-goat, and their .three kids, which
was all they had provided for their sustenance; and
that if he and his friends, meaning the Spaniards,
did not assist them again, they should be starved.
When the Spaniards came home at night, and they
were all at supper, he took the freedom to reprove
the three Englishmen, though in gentle and mannerly
terms, and asked them, how they could be so cruel,
E 2 they
they being harmless inoffensive fellows, and that they
were putting themselves in a way to subsist by their
labour, and that it had cost them a great deal of pains
to bring things to such perfection as they had?
One of the Englishmen returned very briskly, What
had they to do there? That they came on shore with-
out leave, and that they should not plant or build
upon the island; it was none of their ground. Why,
says the Spaniard, very calmly, Seignior Ingle/e, they
must not starve. The Englishman replied, like a true
rough-hewn tarpaulin, they might starve and be damn-
ed, they should not plant nor build in that place.
But what must they do then, Seignior? says the Spa-
niard. Another of the brutes returned, Do! d—n
them, they should be servants, and work for them.
But how can you expect that of them? they are
not bought with your money; you have no right to
make them servants. The Englishman answered, The
island was theirs, the governor had given it to them,
and no man had any thing to do there but themselves;
and with that swore by his Maker, that he would go
and burn all their new huts; they should build none
upon their land.
Why Seignior, says the Spaniard, by the same
rule, we must be your servants too. Ay, says the
bold" dog, and so you shall too, before we have done
with you, mixing two or three G—d d—mme's in
the proper intervals of his speech. The Spaniard
only smiled at that, and made him no answer. How-
ever, this little discourse had heated them; and
starting up, one says to the other, I think it was he
they called Will Atkins, Come Jack, let us go and
have the other brush with them; we will demolish
their
53
their castle, I will warrant you; they shall plant no
colony in our dominions.
Upon this they were all trooping away, with
every man a gun, a pistol, and a sword, and mut-
tered some insolent things among themselves, of
what they would do to the Spaniards too, when op-
portunity offered; but the Spaniards, it seems, did
not so perfectly understand them as to know all the
particulars; only that, in general, they threatened
them hard for taking the two Englishmen's part.
Whither they went, or how they bestowed their
time that evening, the Spaniards said they did not
know; but it seems they wandered about the country
part of the night; and then lying down in the place
which I used to call my bower, they were weary, and
overslept themselves. The case was this: they had
resolved to stay till midnight, and so to take the
poor men when they were afleep; and they acknow-
ledged it afterwards, intending to set fire to their
huts while they were in them, and either burn them
in them, or murder them as they came out: and,
as malice seldom sleeps very sound, it was very strange
they should not have been kept waking.
However, as the two men had also a design upon
them, as I have said, tho' a much sairer one than
that of burning and murdering, it happened, and
very luckily for them all, that they were up and
gone abroad, before the bloody-minded rogues came
to their huts.
When they came thither and found the men gone,
Atkins, who it seems was the forwardest man, called
out to his comrades, Ha! Jack, here's the nest; but
d—n them, the birds are flown: they mused a while
E 3 to
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
to think what should be the occasion of their being
gone abroad so soon, and suggested presently, that
the Spaniards had given them notice of it; and with
that they shook hands, arid swore to one another,
that they would be revenged of the Spaniards. As
soon as they had made this bloody bargain, they fell
to work with the poor men's habitation; they did
not set fire indeed to any thing, but they pulled down
both their houses, and pulled them so limb from limb
that they left not the least stick standing, or scarce
any sign on the ground where they stood; they tore
all their little collected household-stuff in pieces, and
threw every thing about in such a manner, that the
poor men found, afterwards, some of their things
a mile off" from their habitation.
When they had done this, they pulled up all the
young trees which the poor men had planted; pulled
up the inclosure they had made to secure their cattle
and their corn; and, in a word, sacked and plun-
dered every thing, as completely as a herd of Tartars
would have done.
The two men were at this juncture gone to find
them out, and had resolved to sight them wherever
they had been, tho' they were but two to three: so
that, had they met, there certainly would have been
bloodshed among them; for they were all very stout,
resolute fellows, to give them their due.
But Providence took more care to keep them
asunder, than they themselves could do to meet: for,
as they had dogged one another, when the three were
gone thither, the two were here; and afterwards,
when the two went back to find them, the three were
come to the old habitation again; we shall see their
differing
55
differing conduct presently. When the three came
back, like furious creatures, flushed with the rage
which the work they had been about put them into,
they came up to the Spaniards, and told them what
they had done, by way of scoff and bravado; and
one of them stepping up to one of the Spaniards, as
if they had been a couple of boys at play, takes hold
of his hat, as it was upon his head, and giving it a
twirl about, fleering in his sace, says he to him, And
you, Seignior Jack Spaniard, shall have the same
sauce, if you do not mend your manners. The Spa-
niard who, though quite a civil man, was as brave
as a man could desire to be, and withal a strong
well-made man, looked steadily at him for a good
while; and then, having no weapon in his hand,
slept gravely up to him, and with one blow of his
fist, knocked him down, as an ox is felled with a
pole-axe, at which one of the rogues, insolent as the
first, fired his pistol at the Spaniard immediately:
he miffed his body indeed, for the bullets went
through his hair, but one of them touched the tip
of his ear, and he bled pretty much. The blood
made the Spaniard believe he was more hurt than he
really was, and that put him into some heat, for be-
fore he acted all in a perfect calm; but now re-
solving to go through with his work, he stooped and
took the fellow's musquet whom he had knocked
down, and was just going to shoot the man who had
fired at him; when the rest of the Spaniards, being
in the cave, came out, and calling to him not to
shoot, they stept in, secured the other two, and took
their arms from them.
E 4 When
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
When they were thus disarmed, and found they
had made all the Spaniards their enemies, as well as
their own countrymen, they began to cool; and
giving the Spaniards better words, would have had
their arms again; but the Spaniards, considering the
feud that was between them and the other two English-
men, and that it would be the best method they could
take to keep them from one another, told them they
would do them no harm; and if they would live
peaceably they would be very willing to assist and
associate with them, as they did before; but that
they could not think of giving them their arms
again, while they appeared so resolved to do mis-
chief with them to their own countrymen, and had
even threatened them all to make them their
servants.
The rogues were now more capable to hear rea-
son than to act reason; but being refused their arms,
they went raving away, and raging like madmen,
threatening what they would do, though they had
no fire-arms: but the Spaniards despising their threat-
ening, told them they shouid take care how they
offered any injury to their plantation or cattle; for
if they did, they would shoot them, as they would
do ravenous beasts, wherever they found them; and
if they fell into their hands alive, they would cer-
tainly be hanged. However, this was sar from cool-
ing them; but away they went, swearing and raging
like furies of hell. As soon as they were gone, came
back the two men in passion and rage enough also,
though of another kind; for, having been at their
plantation, and finding it all demolished and destroy-
ed, as above, it will easily be supposed they had pro-
vocation
57
vocation enough; they could scarce have room to
tell their tale, the Spaniards were so eager to tell
them theirs; and it was strange enough to find, that
three men should thus bully nineteen, and receive no
punishment at all.
The Spaniards indeed despised them, and especially
having thus disarmed them, made light of their
threatenings; but the two Englishmen resolved to have
their remedy against them, what pains soever it cost
to find them out.
But the Spaniards interposed here too, and told
them, that they were already disarmed: they could
not consent that they (the two) should pursue them
with fire-arms, and perhaps kill them: but, said the
grave Spaniard, who was their governor, we will
endeavour to make them do you justice, if you will
leave it to us, for, as there is no doubt but they will
come to us again when their passion is over, being not
able to subsist without our assistance, we promise you
to make no peace with them, without having a full
satissaction for you ; and upon this condition we hope
you will promise to use no violence with them, other
than in your defence.
The two Englishmen yielded to this very awkwardly,
and with great reluctance; but the Spaniards pro-
tested, they did it only to keep them from bloodshed,
and to make all easy at last; for, said they, we are
not so many of us; here is room enough for us all,
and it is great pity we should not be all good friends.
At length they did consent, and waited for the issue
of the thing, living for some days with the Spaniards;
for their own habitation was destroyed.
In
In about five days time the three vagrants, tired
with wandering, and almost starved with hunger,
having chiefly lived on turtles eggs all that while,
came back to the grove; and finding my Spaniard,
who, as I have said, was the governor, and two
more with him, walking by the side of the creek;
they came up in a very submissive humble manner,
and begged to be received again into the family. The
Spaniards used them civilly, but told them, they had
acted so unnaturally by their countrymen, and so
very grossly by them (the Spaniards ), that they could
not come to any conclusion without consulting the
two Englishmen, and the rest; but however they
would go to them, and discourse about it, and they
should know in half an hour. It may be guessed
that they were very hard put to it; for it seems, as
they were to wait this half-hour for an answer, they
begged he would send them out some bread in the
mean time; which he did, and sent them at the same
time a large piece of goat's flesh, and a broiled par-
rot; which they eat very heartily, for they were
hungry enough.
After half an hour's consultation they were called
in, and a long debate had about them, their two
countrymen charging them with the ruin of all their
labour, and a design to murder them; all which they
owned before, and therefore could not deny now;
upon the whole, the Spaniards acted the moderators
between them; and as they had obliged the two
Englishmen not to hurt the three, while they were
naked and unarmed, so they now obliged the three
to go and rebuild their fellows two huts, one to be
of
of the same dimensions, and the other larger than
they were before ., also to fence their ground again,
where they had pulled up the fences, plant trees in
the room of those pulled up, dig up the land again
for planting corn, where they had spoiled it; and,
in a word, to restore every thing in the same state as
they found it, as near as they could; for entirely it
could not be, the season for the corn, and the growth
of the trees and hedges, not being possible to be
recovered.
Well, they all submitted to this; and as they
had plenty of provisions given them all the while,
they grew very orderly, and the whole society began
to live pleasantly and agreeably together again; only
that these three fellows could never be persuaded to
work; I mean, not for themselves, except now and
then a little, just as they pleased; however, the Spa-
niards told them plainly, that if they would but live
sociably and friendly together, and study in the whole
the good of the plantation, they would be content to
work for them, and let them walk about and be as
idle as they pleased; and thus having lived pretty
well together for a month or two, the Spaniards gave
them their arms again, and gave them liberty to go
abroad with them as before.
It was not above a week after they had these arms,
and went abroad, but the ungrateful creatures be-
gan to be as insolent and troublesome as before; but
however, an accident happened presently upon this,
which endangered the safety of them all; they were
obliged to lay by all private resentments, and look
to the preservation of their lives.
It
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
It happened one night, that the Spaniard governor,
as I call him, that is to say, the Spaniard whose
life I had saved, who was now the captain, or leader,
or governor of the rest, found himself very uneasy
in the night, and could by no means get any sleep:
he was perfectly well in body, as he told me the story,
only found his thoughts tumultuous; his mind ran
upon men fighting, and killing one another, but
was broad awake, and could not by any means get
any sleep; in short, he lay a great while; but grow-
ing more and more uneasy, he resolved to rise: as
they lay, being so many of them, upon goat-skins,
laid thick upon such couches and pads as they made
for themselves, and not in hammocks and ship-beds,
as I did, who was but one, so they had little to do,
when they were willing to rise, but to get up upon
their feet, and perhaps put on a coat, such as it was,
and their pumps, and they were ready for going any
way that their thoughts guided them.
Being thus gotten up, he looked out; but, being
dark, he could fee little or nothing; and besides,
the trees which I had planted, as in my former ac-
count is described, and which were now grevn tall,
intercepted his sight, so that he could only look up,
and see that it was a clear star-light night; and, hear-,
ing no noise, he returned and laid him down again;
but it was all one, he could not sleep, nor could he
compose himself to any thing like rest, but his
thoughts were to the last degree uneasy, and yet he
knew not for what.
Having made some noise with rising and walking
about, going out and coming in, another of them
waked,
waked, and, calling, asked who it was that was up?
The governor told him, how it had been with him.
Say you so? says the other Spaniard; such things are
not to be slighted, I assure you; there is certainly
some mischief working, says he, near us; and pre-
sently he asked him, Where are the Englishmen? They
are all in their huts, says he, safe enough. It seems,
the Spaniards had kept possession of the main apart-
ment, and had made a place, where the three Eng-
lisfjmen, since their last mutiny, always quartered by
themselves, and could not come at the rest. Well,
says the Spaniard, there is something in it, I am per-
suaded from my own experience; I am satisfied our
spirits embodied have converse with, and receive in-
telligence from, the spirits unembodied, and inhabit-
ing the invisible world; and this friendly notice is
given for our advantage, if we know how to make
use of it. Come, says he, let us go out and look
abroad; and if we find nothing at all in it to justify
our trouble, I'll tell you a story to the purpose,
that shall convince you of the justice of my pro-
posing it.
In a word, they went out to go to the top of
the hill, where I used to go; but they, being strong,
and in good company, nor alone, as I was, used
none of my cautions to go up by the ladder, and
then pulling it up after them, to go up a second stage
to the top, but were going round through the grove
unconcerned and unwary, when they were surprised
with seeing a light as of fire, a very little way off
from them, and hearing the voices of men, not of
one, or two, but of a great number.
In
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
In all the discoveries I had made of the savages
landing on the island, it was my constant care to
prevent them making the least discovery of there be-
ing any inhabitant upon the place; and when by
any necessity they came to know it, they felt it so
effectually, that they that got away, were scarce able
to give any account of it, for we disappeared as soon
as possible, nor did ever any that had seen me,
escape to tell any one else, except it were the three
savages in our last encounter, who jumped into the
boat, of whom I mentioned that I was afraid they
should go home, and bring more help.
Whether it was the consequence of the escape of
those men, that so great a number came now to-
gether; or whether they came ignorantly, and by.
accident, on their usual bloody errand, the Spaniards
could not it seems understand: but whatever it was,
it had been their business, either to have concealed
themselves, and not have seen them at all; much
less to have let the savages have seen, that there were
any inhabitants in the place; but to have sallen upon
them so effectually, as that not a man of them should
have escaped, which could only have been by getting
in between them and their boats; but this presence
of mind was wanting to them, w hich was the ruin of
their tranquillity, for a great while.
We need not doubt but that the governor, and
the man with him, surprised with this light, ran back
immediately, and raised their fellows, giving them
an account of the imminent danger they were all in;
and they again as readily took the alarm, but it was
impoffible to persuade them to stay close withirr* where
they
they were, but that they must all run out to see how
things stood.
While it was dark indeed, they were well enough,
and they had opportunity enough, for some hours, to
view them by the light of three fires they had made
at some distance from one another; what they were
doing they knew not, and what to do themselves they
knew not; for, first, the enemy were too many;
and, secondly, they did not keep together, but were
divided into several parties, and were on shore in
several places.
The Spaniards were in no small consternation at
this sight; and as they found that the fellows ran
straggling all over the shore, they made no doubt,
but, first or last, some of them would chop in upon
their habitation, or upon some other place, where
they would see the tokens of inhabitants; and they
were in great perplexity also for fear of their flock of
goats, which would have been little less than starving
them, if they should have been destroyed; so the
first thing they resolved upon, was to dispatch three
men away before it was light, viz. two Spaniards and
one Englishman, to drive all the goats away to the
great valley where the cave was, and, if need were,
to drive them into the very cave itself.
Could they have seen the savages altogether in
one body, and at a distance from their canoes, they
resolved, if there had been an hundred of them, to
have attacked them; but that could not be obtained,
for there were some of them two miles off from the
other, and, as it appeared afterwards, were of two
different nations.
After
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
After having mused a great while on the course
they should take, and beaten their brains in consi-
dering their present circumstances, they resolved at
last, while it was dark, to fend the old savage (Fri-
day's sather) out, as a spy, to learn, if possible, some-
thing concerning them, as what they came for, and
what they intended to do, and the like; the old
man readily undertook it, and, stripping himself
quite naked, as most of the savages were, away he
went: after he had been gone an hour or two, he
brings word, that he had been among them undisco-
vered, that he found they were two parties, and of
two several nations, who had war with one another
and had had a great battle in their own country, and
that both sides having had several prisoners taken in
the fight, they were by mere chance landed in the
same island, for the devouring their prisoners, and
making merry; but their coming so by chance to
the same place, had spoiled all their mirth; that they
were in a great rage at one another, and were so near,
that he believed they would sight again as soon as
day-light began to appear; but he did not perceive
that they had any notion of any body's being on the
ifland but themselves. He had hardly made an end
of telling the story, when they could perceive, by
the unusual noise they made, that the two little
armies were engaged in a bloody fight.
Friday's sather used all the arguments he could to
persuade our people to lie close, and not be seen; he
told them, their safety consisted in it, and that they
had nothing to do but to lie still, and the savages
would kill one another to their hands, and the rest
would
would go away; and it was so to a tittle. But it
was impossible to prevail, especially upon the Eng-
lishmen; their curiosity was so importunate upon
their prudentials, that they must run out and fee the
battle: however, they used some caution, viz. they
did not go openly just by their own dwelling, but
went sarther into the woods, and placed themselves
to advantage, where they might securely see them
manage the fight, and, as they thought, not to be
seen by them; but it seems the savages did fee
them, as we shall find hereafter.
The battle was very fierce, and if I might believe
the Englishmen, one of them said, he could perceive,
that some of them were men of great bravery, of
invincible spirits, and of great policy in guiding the
fight. The battle, they said, held two hours, before
they could guess which party would be beaten; but
then that party which was nearest our people's habita-
tion began to appear weakest, and after some time
more, some of them began to fly; and this put our
men again into a great consternation, lest any of
those' that fled should run into the grove, before their
dwelling, for shelter, and thereby involuntarily dis-
cover the place; and that by consequence the pur-
suers should do the like in search for them. Upon
this they resolved, that they would stand armed with-
in the wall, and whoever came into the grove, they
should sally out over the wall, and kill them; so
that, if possible, not one ssiould return to give an
account of it; they ordered also, that it should be
done with their swords, or by knocking them down
Vol. n. F with
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
with the stock of the musquet, not by shooting therri,
for fear of raising an alarm by the noise.
As they expected, it fell out; three of the routed
army fled for life, and crossing the creek, ran directly
into the place, not in the least knowing whither
they went, but running as into a thick wood for
shelter; the scout they kept to look abroad gave
notice of this within, with this addition, to our
men's great satissaction, viz. That the conquerors
had not pursued them, or seen which way they were
gone. Upon this the Spaniard governor, a man of
humanity, would not suffer them to kill the three
fugitives; but, sending three men out by the top of
the hill, ordered them to go found, and come in
behind them, surprise and take them prisoners, -which
was done; the residue of the conquered people fled
to their canoes, and got off to sea; the victors re-
tired, and made no pursuit, or very little; but, drawJ-
ing themselves into a body together, gave two great
screaming shouts, which they supposed were by way
of triumph, and so the fight ended: and the same
day, about three o'clock in the afternoon, they also
marched to their canoes. And thus the Spaniards
had their island again free to themselves, their fright
was over, and they saw no savages in several years
after.
After they were all gone, the Spaniards came out
of their den; and, viewing the field of battle, they
found about two-and-thirty dead men upon the spot;
some were killed with great long arrows, several of
which were found sticking in their bodies; but most
of them were killed with their great wooden swords,
sixteen
I
sixteen or seventeen of which they found in the sield
of battle, and' as many bows, with a great many
arrows: these swords were great unwieldly things,
and they must be very strong men that used them:
most of those men that were killed with them Ind
their heads mashed to pieces, as we may say, or, as
we call it in English, their brains knocked out, and
several of their arms and legs broken; so that it is
evident they fight with inexpressible rage and fury;
they found not one wounded man that was not stone
dead; for either they stay by their enemy till
they have quite killed them, or they carry all the
wounded men, that are not quite dead, away with
them.
This deliverance tamed our Englishmen for a great
while: the sight had filled them with horror, and
the consequence appeared terrible to the last degree,
especially upon supposing that some time or other
they should sall into the hands of those creatures,
who would not only kill them as enemies, but
kill them for food, as we kill our cattle. And
they professed to me, that the thoughts of being
eaten up like beef or mutton, though it was sup-
posed it was not to be till they were dead, had some-
thing in it so horrible, that it nauseated their very
stomachs, made them sick when they thought of it,
and fiHed their minds with unusual terror, that
thev were not themselves for some weeks after.
J
This, as I said, tamed even the three English
brutes I have been speaking of; and, for a great
while after, they were very tractable, and went about
the common business of the whole society well
F 2 enough;
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
enough; planted, sowed, reaped, and began to be
all naturalized to the country; but some time after
this, they fell all into such simple measures again as
brought them into a great deal of trouble.
They had taken three prisoners, as I had observed}
and these three being lusty stout young fellows, they
made them servants, and taught them to work
for them; and, as slaves, they did well enough;
but they did not take their measures with them
as I did by my man Friday, viz. to begin with them
upon the principle of having saved their lives, and
then instructed them in the rational principles of'
life, much less of religion, civilizing and reducing
them by kind usage, and asfectionate arguings;
but, as they gave them their food every day, so
they gave them their work too, and kept them fully
employed in drudgery enough; but they sailed in
this by it, that they never had them to assist them
and fight for them, as I had my man Friday, who
was as true to me as the very flesh upon my bones.
But to come to the samily part: Being all now
good friends (for common danger, as I said above,
had effectually reconciled them), they began to con-
sider their general circumstances; and the first thing
that came under their consideration was, whether,
seeing the savages particularly haunted that side of the
island, and that there were more remote and retired
parts of it equally adapted to their way of living, and
manifestly to their advantage, they should not rather
remove their habitation, and plant in some more
proper place for their safety, and especially for the
security of their cattle and corn..
Upon
Upon this, after long debate, it was conceived,
that they should not remove their habitation; be-
cause that some time or other they thought they
might hear from their governor again, meaning
me: and if I mould send any one to seek them, I
would be sure to direct them on that side, where, if
they mould find the place demolished, they would
conclude the savages had killed us all, and we were
gone, and so our supply would go away too.
But as to their corn and cattle, they agreed to
remove them into the valley where my cave was,
where the land was as proper to both, and where
indeed there was land enough: however, upon se-
cond thoughts, they altered one part of that resolu-
tion too, and resolved only to remove part of their
cattle thither, and plant part of their corn there;
and so, if one part was destroyed, the other might
be saved: and one piece of prudence they used,
which it was very well they did; viz. That they
never trusted these three savages, which they had
taken prisoners, with knowing any thing of the
plantation they had made in that valley, or of any
cattle they had there; much less of the cave there,
which they kept in case of necessity, as a safe retreat;
and thither they carried also the two barrels of pow-
der which I had left them at my coming away.
But, however, they resolved not to change their
habitation; yet they agreed, that as I had carefully
covered it first with a wall and fortification, and
then with a grove of trees; so, seeing their safety
consisted entirely in their being concealed, of which
they were now fully convinced, they set to work to
cover and conceal the place yet more effectually than
F 3 before:
before: to this purpose, as I had planted trees (of
rather thrust in stakes, which in time all grew to be
trees) for some good distance before the entrance
into my apartment, they went on in the same man-
ner, and filled up the rest of that whole space of
ground, from the trees I had set, quite down to the
side of the creek, where, as I said, I landed my
floats, and even into the very ouze where the tide
flowed, not so much as leaving any place to land, or
any sign that there had been any landing thereabout:
these stakes also, being of a wood very forward to
grow, as I had noted formerly, they took care to
have generally very much larger and taller than those
which I had planted, and placed them so very thick
and close, that when they had been three or four
years grown, there was no piercing with the eye any
considerable way into the plantation: as for that part
which I had planted, the trees were grown as thick
as a man's thigh; and among them they placed so
many other short ones, and so thick, that, in a word,
it stood like a palisado a quarter of a mile thick, and
it was next to impossible to penetrate it, but with a
little army, to cut it all down; for a little dog could
hardly get between the trees, they stood so close.
But this was not all; for they did the same by
all the ground to the right hand, and to the left,
and round even to the top of the hill; leaving no
way, not so much as for themselves to come out,
but by the ladder placed up to the side of the hill,
and then, lifted up, and placed again from the first
stage up to the top; which ladder, when it was taken
down, nothing but what had wings or witchcraft to
assist it, could come at them.
This
This was excellently well contrived: nor was it
less than what they afterwards found occasion for;
which served to convince me, that as human pru-
dence has authority of Providence to justify it, so
it has, doubtless, the direction of Providence to set
it to work; and, would we listen carefully to the
voice of it, I am fully persuaded we might prevent
many of the disasters which our lives are now, by
our own negligence, subjected to. But this by the
way.
I return to the story: they lived two years after
this in perfect retirement, and had no more visits
from the savages; they had indeed an alarm given
them one morning, which put them in a great con-
sternation; for, some of the Spaniards being out
early one morning on the west side, or rather end of
the island, which, by the way, was that end where
J never went, for fear of being discovered, they were
surprised with seeing above twenty canoes of Indians
just coming on shore,
They made the best of their way home, in hurry
enough; and giving the alarm to their comrades,
they kept close all that day and the next, going
out only at night, to make observation: but they
had the good luck to be mistaken; for wherever
the savages went, they did not land at that time
on the island, but pursued some other design.
And now they had another broil with the three
Englishmen; one of which, a most turbulent fellow,
being in a rage at one of the three slaves, which I
mentioned they had taken, because the fellow had
not done something right which he bid him do, and
F 4 seemed
seemed a little untractable in his shewing him, drew
a hatchet out of a frog-belt, in which he bore it by
his side, and fell upon him, the poor savage, not to
correct him, but to kill him. One of the Spaniards,
who was by, seeing him give the fellow a barbarous
cut with the hatchet, which he aimed at his head,
but struck into his shoulder, so that he thought he
had cut the poor creature's arm off, ran to him, and
intreating him not to murder the poor man, clapt
in between him and the savage, to prevent the
mischief. . N
The fellow, being enraged the more at this, struck
at the Spaniard with his hatchet, and swore he would
serve him as he intended to serve the savage; which
the Spaniard perceiving, avoided the blow, and
with a shovel, which he had in his hand (for they
were working in the field about the corn-land,)
knocked the brute down: another of the Englishmen,
running at the same time to help his comrade,
knocked the Spaniard down; and then two Spaniards
more came to help their man, and a third Englishman
sell upon them. They had none of them any fire-
arms, or any other weapons but hatchets and other
tools, except the third Englisloman; he had one of
my old rusty cutlasses, with which he made at the
last Spaniards, and wounded them both: this fray
set the whole samily in an uproar, and more help
coming in, they took the three Englishmen prisoners.
The next question was, What should be done with
them? They had been so often mutinous, and were
so furious, so desperate, and so idle withal, that they
knew not what course to take with them, for they
were
were mischievous to the highest degree, and valued
not what hurt they did any man; so that, in short,
it was'not safe to live with them.
The Spaniard who was governor, told them in so
many words, that if they had been his own country-
men, he would have hanged them all; for all laws,
and all governors, were to preserve society; and
those who were dangerous to the society ought to be
expelled out of it; but as they were Englishmen,
and that it was to the generous kindness of an Eng-
lishman that they all owed their preservation and de-
liverance, he would use them with all possible lenity,
and would leave them to the judgment of the other
two Englislmen, who were their countrymen.
One of the two honest Englishmen stood up, and
said, they defired it might not be left to them: for,
says he, I am sure we ought to sentence them to the
gallows; and with that gives an account how Will
Atkins, one of the three, had proposed to have all
the five Englishmen join together, and murder all the
Spaniards, when they were in their deep.
When the Spanish governor heard this, he calls to
Will Atkins: How, Seignior Atkins, says lie, Will
you murder us all? What have you to say to that?
That hardened villain was so sar from denying it,
that he said it was true, and G—d d—mn him they
would do it still before they had done with them.
Well, but Seignior Atkins, said the Spaniard, What
have we done to you that you will kill us? And
what would you get by killing us? And what must
we do to prevent your killing us? Must we kill you,
er will you kill us? Why will you put us to the ne-
cessity
celfity of this, Seignior Atkins? says the Spaniard
very calmly, and smiling.
Seignior Atkins was in such a rage at the Spaniard's.
making a jest of it, that, had he not been held by
three men, and withal had no weapons with him, it
was thought he would have attempted to have killed
the Spaniard in the middle of all the company.
This hare-brained carriage obliged them to consi-
der seriously what was to be done. The two English-
men and the Spaniard, who saved the poor savage,
were of the opinion, That they mould hang one of
the three for an example to the rest; and that par-
ticularly it should be he that had twice attempted to
commit murder with his hatchet; and indeed there
was some reason to believe he had done it, for the
poor savage was in such a miserable condition with
the wound he had received, that it was thought he
could not live.
But the governor Spaniard still said; No, it was
an Englishman that had saved all their lives, and he
would never consent to put an Englishman to death,
though he had murdered half of them; nay, he said,
if he had been killed himself by an Englishmau, and
had time left to speak, it should be, that they should
pardon him.
This was so positively insisted on by the governor
Spaniard, that there was no gainsaying it; and, as
merciful counsels are most apt to prevail, where they
are so earnestly pressed, so they all came into it; but
then it was to be considered, what mould be done
to keep them from the mischief they designed; for
all agreed, governor and all, that means were to ba
used
Used for preserving the society from danger: After a
long debate it was agreed, first, That they should be
disarmed, and not permitted to have either gun, or
powder, or shot, or sword, or any weapon, and
should be turned out of the society, and left to live
where they would, and how they could, by them-
selves; but that none of the rest, either Spaniards or
English, should converse with them, speak with them,
or have any thing to do with them; that they should
be forbid to come within a certain distance of the
place where the rest dwelt; and that if they offered
to commit any disorder, so as to spoil, burn, kill, or
destroy any of the corn, plantings, buildings, fences,
or cattle belonging to the society, that they should
die without mercy, and would shoot them wherever
they could find them.
The governor, a man of great humanity, musing
upon the sentence, considered a little upon it; and,
turning to the two honest Englishmen, said, Hold; you
must reflect, that it will be long ere they can raise
corn and cattle of their own, and they must not starve;
we muse therefore allow them provisions. So he cau-
sed to be added, That they should have a proportion
of corn given them to last them eight months, and for
feed to sow, by which time they might be supposed
to raise some of their own; that they should have
six milch-goats, four he-goats, and six kids given
them, as well for present subsistence, as for a store;
and that they should have tools given them for their
work in the field; such as, six hatchets, an axe, a
saw, and the like: But they should have none of
these tools or provisions, unless they would swear
solemnly
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
solemnly, that they would not hurt or injure any of the
Spaniards with them, or of their fellow Englishmen.
Thus they dismissed them the society, and turned
them out to shift for themselves. They went away
sullen and refractory, as neither contented to go
away, or to stay; but, as there was no remedy, they
went, pretending to go and choose a place where they
should settle themselves, to plant and live by them-
selves; and some provisions were given, but no wea-
pons.
About four or five days after, they came again for
some victuals, and gave the governor an account
where they had pitched their tents, and marked them-
selves out an habitation or plantation; it was a very
convenient place indeed, on the remotest part of the
island, N. E. much about the place where I provi-
dentially landed in my first voyage, when I was dri-
ven out to sea, the Lord alone knows whither, in
my foolish attempt to surround the island.
Here they built themselves two handsome huts,
and contrived them in a manner like my first habita-
tion, being close under the side of a hill, having
some trees growing already to the three fides of it;
so that by planting others, it would be very easily
covered from the sight, unless narrowly searched
for; they defired some dry goat skins for beds and
covering, which were given them; and upon their
giving their words that they would not disturb the
rest, or injure any of their plantations, they gave
them hatchets, and what other tools they could
spare; some pease, barley, and rice, for sowing,
and, in a word, any thing they wanted but arms and
ammunition.
They
17
They lived in this separate condition about six
months, and had got in their first harvest, though
the quantity was but small, the parcel of land they
had planted being but little; for indeed, having all
their plantation to form, they had a great deal of
work upon their hands; and when they came to
make boards, and pots, and such things, they were
quite out of their clement, and could make nothing
of it; and when the rainy season came on, for want
of a cave in the earth, they could not keep their
grain dry, and it was in great danger of spoiling:
and this humbled them much; so they came and beg-
ged the Spaniards to help them, which they very
readily did; and in four days worked a great hole
in the side of the hill for them, big enough to secure
their corn, and other things from the rain; but it
was but a poor place at best, compared to mine ; and
especially as mine was then; for the Spaniards had
greatly enlarged it, and made several new apartments
in it.
About three quarters of a year after this separation,
a new frolick took these rogues, which, together
with the former villainy they had committed, brought
mischief enough upon them, and had very near been
the ruin of the whole colony: the three new associates
began, it seems, to be weary of the laborious life
they led, and that without hope of bettering their
circumstances; and a whim took them, that they
would make a voyage to the continent from whence
the savages came, and would try if they could not
seize upon some prisoners among the natives there
and bring them home, so as to make them do the
laborious part of the work for them.
The
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
The project was not so prepostero us, if they had go*n4
no sarther; but they did nothing, and proposed no*
thing, but had either mischief in the design, or mis-
chief in the event: and, if I may give my opinion,
they seemed to be under a blast from Heaven; for if
we will not allow a visible curse to pursue visible
crimes, how mall we reconcile the events of thing9
with divine justice? It was certainly an apparent ven-
geance on their crime of mutiny and piracy, that
brought them to the state they were in; and, as they
shewed not the least remorse for the crime, but added
new villainies to it, such as, particularly, that piece
of monstrous cruelty of wounding a poor flave, be-
cause he did not, or perhaps could not, understand to
do what he was directed; and to wound him in such
a manner, as, no question, made him a cripple all his
life, and in a place where no surgeon or medicine
"could be had for his cure: and, what was still worse,
the murderous intent; or, to do justice to the crime,
the intentional murder, for such to be sure it was,
as was afterwards the formed design they all laid, to
murder the Spaniards in cold blood, and in their
sleep.
But I leave observing, and return to the story:
The three fellows came down to the Spaniards one
morning, and, in very humble terms, defired to be
admitted to speak with them: the Spaniards very
readily heard what they had to say, which was this:
that they were tired of living in the manner they did;
that they were not handy enough to make the neces-
saries they wanted; and that, having no help, they
found they mould be starved; but if the Spaniards
would give them leave to take one of the canoes which
they
70
they came over in, and give them arms and ammuni-
tion, proportioned for their defence, they would go
over to the main, and seek their fortune, and so deli*
ver them from the trouble of supplying them with
any other provisions.
The Spaniards were glad enough to be rid of them;
but yet very honestly represented to them the certain
destruction they were running into; told them,
they had suffered such hardships upon that very spot,
that they could, without any spirit of prophecy, tell
them, that they would be starved or murdered; and
bade them consider of it.
The men replied audaciously, they should be star-
ved if they stayed here, for they could not work, and
would not work; and they could but be starved
abroad; 'and if they were murdered, there was an
end of them, they had no wives or children to cry
after them; and, in short, insisted importunately upon
their demand, declaring that they would go, whether
they would give them any arms or no.
The Spaniards told them, with great kindness>
that if they were resolved to go, they should not go
like naked men, and be in no condition to defend
themselves; and that though they could ill spare
their fire-arms, having not enough for themselves,
yet they would let them have two musquets, a pistol,
and a cutlass, and each man a hatchet, which they
thought susiieient for them.
In a word, they accepted the offer; and having
baked them bread enough to serve them a month,
and given them as much goat's flesh as they could
eat while it was sweet, and a great basket full of dried
grapes, a pot full of fresh water, and a young kid
alive
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
alive to kill, they boldly set out in a canoe for a
voyage over the sea, where it was at least forty miles
broad.
The boat was indeed a large one, and would have
very well carried 15 or 20 men; and therefore was
rather too big for them to manage; but as they had
a sair breeze and the flood-tide w ith them, they did
well enough: they had made a mast of a long pole,
and a sail of four large goat-skins dried, which they
had sowed or laced together; and away they went
merrily enough: the Spaniards called after them,
Bon Veajo; and no man ever thought of seeing them
any more.
The Spaniards would often say to one another, and
the two hone'I Englishmen who remained behind, how
quietly and comfortably they lived, now those three
turbulent fellows were gone; as for their ever coming
again, that was the remotest thing from their thoughts
could be imagined; when, behold, after twenty
two days absence, one of the Englishmen being
abroad upon his planting-work, fees three strange
men coming towards him at a distance, two of them
with guns upon their shoulders.
Away runs the Englislunan, as if he was bewitched,
and became frighted and amazed, to the governor
Spaniard, and tells him they were all undone, for
there were strangers landed upon the island, he could
not tell who: the Spaniard pausing a while, says to
him, How do you mean, you cannot tell who? They
are savages to be sure. No, no, says the Englishman,
they are men in clothes, with arms: Nay then, says
the Spaniard, why are you concerned? If they are
not savages, they must be friends; for there is no
Christian
Si
Christian nation upon earth, but will do us good ra-
ther than harm.
While they were debating thus, came the three
Englis}men, and, standing without the wood which
was new planted, hallooed to them; they presently
knew their voices, and so all the wonder of that
kind ceased. But now the admiration was turned
upon another question, 'viz. What could be the mat-
ter, and what made them come back again?
It was not long before they brought the men in;
and enquiring where they had been, and what they
had been doing? They gave them a full account
of their voyage in a few words, viz. That they
reached the land in two days, or something less; but
finding the people alarmed at their coming, and pre-
paring with bows and arrows to fight them, they
durst not go on more, but sailed on to the northward
six or seven hours, till they came to a great opening,
by which they perceived that the land they saw from
our island was not the main, but an island: that
entering that opening of the sea, they saw another
island on the right hand north, and several more
west; and being resolved to land somewhere, they
put over to one os the islands which lay west, and
went boldly on more; that they found the people
were courteous and friendly to them, and they gave
them several roots, and some dried fish, and ap-
peared very sociable; and the women, as well as
the men, were very forward to supply them with
any thing they could get for them to eat, and
brought it to them a great way upon their heads.
They continued here four days, and enquired, as
well as they could of them by signs, what nations
Vol. II. G were
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
were this way, and that way; and were told of se-
veral fierce and terrible people, that lived almost
every way; who, as they made known by signs to
them, used to eat men; but as for themselves, they
said, that they never eat men or women, except
only such as they took in the wars; and then they
owned, that they made a great feast, and eat their
prisoners.
The Englishmen enquired, when they had a feast
of that kind; and they told them two moons ago,
pointing to the moon, and then to two fingers; and
that their great king had two hundred prisoners now,
which he had taken in his war; and they were
feeding them to make them fat for the next feast.
The Englishmen seemed mighty desirous to fee those
prisoners; but the others mistaking them, thought
they were desirous to have some of them to carry
away for their own eating. So they beckoned to
them, pointing to the setting of the sun, and then
to the rising; which was to signify, that the next
morning, at fun-rising, they would bring some for
them; and accordingly, the next morning, they
brought down five women, and eleven men; and
gave them to the Englishmen, to carry with them
on their voyage, just as we would bring so many
cows and oxen down to a sea-port town, to victual
a ship.
As brutish and barbarous as these fellows were
at home, their stomachs turned at this sight, and
they did not know what to do; to refuse the pri-
soners would have been the highest affront to the
savage gentry that offered them; and what to do
with them they knew hot: however, upon some de-
bate,
bate, they resolved to accept of them; and, in re-
turn, they gave the savages that brought them one
of their hatchets, an old key, a knife, and six or
seven of their bullets, which, though they did not
understand, they seemed extremely pleased with:
and then, tying the poor creatures hands behind
them, they (the people) dragged the prisoners into
the boat for our men.
The Englishmen were obliged to come away as
soon as they had them, or else they that gave them
this noble present, would certainly have expected
that they should have gone to work with them, have
killed two or three of them the next morning, and
perhaps have invited the donors to dinner.
But, having taken their leave with all the respect
and thanks that could well pass between people, where,
on either side, they understood not one word they
could say, they put off with their boat, and came
back towards the first island, where, when they ar-
rived, they set eight of their prisoners at liberty,
there being too many of them for their occasion.
In their voyage they endeavoured to have some
communication with their prisoners, but it was im-
possible to make them understand any thing; no-
thing they could say to them, or give them, or do
for them, but was looked upon as going about to
murder them: they first of all unbound them; but
the poor creatures screamed at that, especially the
women, as if they had just felt the knife at their
throats; for they immediately concluded they were
unbound on purpose to be killed.
G2 If
If they gave them any thing to eat, it was the
same thing; then they concluded it was for fear they
should sink in flesh, and so not be sat enough to kill:
if they looked at one of them more particularly,
the party presently concluded, it was to fee whether
he or she was sattest and fittest to kill first; nay,
after they had brought them quite over, and began
to use them kindly, and treat them well, still they
expected every day to make a dinner or supper for
their new masters.
When the three wanderers had given this unac-
countable history or journal of their voyage, the
Spaniard asked them, where their new samily was?
And being told that they had brought them on shore,
and put them into one of their huts, and were come
to beg some victuals for them; they (the Spaniards)
and the other two Englishmen, that is to say, the
whole colony, resolved to go all down to the place,
and see them, and did so, and Friday's sather with
them.
When they came into the hut, there they sat ail
bound: for when they had brought them on shore,
they bound their hands, that they might not take
the boat and make their escape; there, I say, they
sat, all of them stark-naked: first, there were three
men, lusty, comely fellows, well shaped, strait and
sair limbs, about 30 or 35 years of age, and five
women, whereof two might be from 30 to 40, two
more not above 24 or 25, and the fifth, a tall, comely
maiden, about 16 or 17: the women were well sa-
voured agreeable persons, both in shape and features,
only tawny; and two of them, had they been per-
fect
sect white, would have passed for handsome women,
even in London itself, having very pleasant agreeable
countenances, and of a very modest behaviour, espe-
cially when they came afterwards to be clothed, and
dressed, as they called it, though" that dress was very
indifferent, it must be confessed; of which here-
after.
The sight, you may be sure, was something un-
couth to our Spaniards, who were (to give them a
just character) men of the best behaviour, of the most
calm, sedate tempers, and perfect good-humour that
ever I met with; and, in particular, of the most
modesty, as will presently appear: I say the sight
was very uncouth, to fee three naked men, and five
naked women, all together bound, and in the most
miserable circumstances that human nature could be
supposed to be, viz. to be expecting every moment •
to be dragged out, and have their brains knocked
out, and then to be eaten up like a calf that is killed
for a dainty.
The first thing they did was to cause the old Indian,
Friday's sather, to go in, and see first if he knew
any of them; and then, if he understood any of
their speech: as soon as the old man came in, he
looked seriously at them, but knew none of them;
neither could any of them understand a word he
said, or a sign he could make, except one of the
women.
However, this was enough to answer the end,
which was to satisfy them, that the men into whose
hands they were sallen, were Christians; that they
abhorred eating of men or women, and that they
might be sure they would not be killed: as soon as
G3 they
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
they were assured of this, they discovered such
a joy, and by such awkward and several ways, as is
hard to describe; for it seems they were of several
nations.
The woman, who was their interpreter, was bid,
in the next place, to ask them if they were willing
to be servants, and to work for the men who had
brought them away, to save their lives? At which
they all fell a dancing; and presently one fell to
taking up this, and another that, any thing that lay
next, to can y on their shoulders, to intimate, that
they were willing to work.
The governor, who found that the having women
among them, would presently be attended with some
inconveniency, and might occasion some strife, and
perhaps blood, asked the three men, what they in-
tended to do with these women, and how they in-
tended to use them, whether as servants, or as wo-
men? One of the Englishmen answered very boldly
and readily, that they would use them as both. To
which the governor said, I am not going to restrain
you from it; you are your own masters'as to that:
but this I think is but just, for avoiding disorders and
quarrels among you, and I defire it of you for that
reason only, viz. that you will all engage, that if
any of you take any of these women, as a woman,
or wife, he shall take but one; and that, having
taken one, none else should touch her; for though
we cannot marry any of you, yet it is but reasonable,
that while you stay here, the woman any of you
takes should be maintained by the man that takes
her, and should be his wife; I mean says he, while
he continues here; and that none else should have
any
87
any thing to do with her. All this appeared so just,
that every one agreed to it without any difficulty.
Then the Englishmen asked the Spaniards, if they
designed to take any of them? But every one an-
swered, No: some of them said they had wives
in Spain; and the others did not like women
that were not Christians; and altogether declared,
that they would not touch one of them; which was
an instance of such virtue, as I have not met with
in all my travels; on the other hand, to be short,
the five Englishmen took them every one a wife;
that is to say, a temporary wife; and so they set
up a new form of living; for the Spaniards and
Fridays sather lived in my old habitation, which
they had enlarged exceedingly within; the three
servants, which they had taken in the late battle of
the savages, lived with them; and these carried on
the main part of the colony, supplying all the reft
with food, and assisting them in any thing as they
could, or as they found necessity required.
But the wonder of this story was, how five such
refractory, ill-matched fellows should agree about
these women, and that two of them should not
pitch upon the same woman, especially seeing two
or three of them were, without comparison, more
agreeable than the others: but they took a good
way enough to prevent quarrelling among them-
selves: for they set the five women by themselves
in one of their huts, and they went all into the
other hut, and drew lots among them who mould
choose first.
He that drew to choose first, went away by him-
self to the hut, where the poor naked creatures were,
G 4 and
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
and fetched out her he chose; and it was worth ob-
serving, that he that chose first, took her that was
reckoned the homeliest, and the oldest of the five,
which made mirth enough among the rest; and even
the Spaniards laughed at it; but the fellow consi-
dered better than any of them, that it was appli-
cation and business that they were to expect assist-
ance in, as much as any thing else; and she proved
the best wife in the parcel.
When the poor women saw themselves in a row-
thus, and fetched out one by one, the terrors of
their condition returned upon them again, and they
firmly believed, that they were now going to be de-
voured: accordingly, when the English sailor came
in and fetched out one of them, the rest set up a
most lamentable cry, and hung about her, and took
their leave of her with such agonies and such affec-
tion, as would have grieved the hardest heart in the
world; nor was it possible for the Englishmen to
satisfy them that they were not to be immediately
murdered, till they fetched the old man, Friday's
sather, who instantly let them know, that the five
men who had fetched them out one by one, had
chosen them for their wives.
When they had done this, and the fright the wo-
men were in was a little over, the men went to
work, and the Spaniards came and helped them;
and, in a few hours, they had built them every one
, a new hut or tent for their lodging apart; for those
they had already were crowded with their tools,
household stuff, and provisions: The three wicked
ones had pitched sarthest off, and the two honest
ones nearer, but both on the north shore of the
island,
89
isiand, so that they continued separate as before:
and thus my island was peopled in three places,
and, as I might say, three towns were begun to be
planted.
And here it is very well worth observing, that as
it often happens in the world (what the wife ends
of God's providences are in such a disposition of
things, I cannot say) the two honest fellows had the
two worst wives; and the three reprobates, that
were scarce worth hanging, that were fit for nothing,
and neither seemed born to do themselves good, or
any one else, had three clever, diligent, careful, and
ingenious wives; hot that the two first were ill
wives as to their temper or humour; for all the five
were most willing, quiet, passive, and subjected
creatures, rather like slaves than wives ; but my
meaning is, they were not alike capable, ingenious,
or industrious, or alike cleanly and neat.
Another observation I must make, to the honour
of a diligent application on the one hand, and to
the disgrace of a slothful, negligent, idle temper on
the other, .that when I came to the place, and viewed
the several improvements, planting, and manage-
ment of the several little colonies; the two men had
so sar outgone the three, that there was no compa-
rison; they had indeed both of them as much
ground laid out for corn as they wanted; and the
reason was, because, according to my rule, nature
dictated, that it was to no purpose to sow more corn
than they wanted; but the difference of the culti-
vation, of the planting, of the fences, and indeed
eyery thing else, was easy to be seen at first view.
The
The two men had innumerable young trees planted
about their huts, that when you came to the place
nothing was to be seen but a wood; and though
they had their plantation twice demolished, once by
their own countrymen, and once by the enemy, as
shall be shewn in its place; yet they had restored all
again, and ev.ery thing was flourishing and thriving
about them: they had grapes planted in order, and
managed like a vineyard, though they had them-
selves never seen any thing of that kind: and by
their good ordering their vines, their grapes were
as good again as any of the others. They had also
formed themselves a retreat in the thickest part of
the woods, where, though there was not a natural
cave, as I had found, yet they made one with in-
cessant labour of their hands, and where, when the
mischief which followed happened, they secured
their wives and children, so as they could never be
found; they having, by sticking innumerable stakes
and poles of the wood, which, as I said, grew so
easily, made a grove impassable, except in one place,
where they climbed up to get over the outside part,
and then went in by ways of their own leaving.
As to the three reprobates, as I justly call them,
though they were much civilized by their new set-
tlement, compared to what they were before, and
were not so quarrelsome, having not the same oppor-
tunity, yet one of the certain companions of a pro-
fligate mind never left them, and that was their idle-
ness: It is true, they planted corn, and made fences;
but Solomon's words were never better verified than
in them: "I went by the vineyard of the slothful,
"and it was overgrown with thorns;" for when
the
the Spaniards came to view their crop, they could
not see it in some places for weeds; the hedge had
several gaps in it, where the wild goats had gotten
in, and eaten up the corn; perhaps here and there
a dead bush was crammed in, to stop them out for
the present, but it was only shutting the stable door
after the steed was stolen; whereas, when they
looked on the colony of the other two, there was
the very face of industry and success upon all they
did; there was not a weed to be seen in all their
corn, or a gap in any of their hedges; and they, on
the other hand, verified Solomon's words in another
place: " The diligent hand maketh richfor
every thing grew and thrived, and they had plenty
within and without; they had more tame cattle than
the others, more utensils and necessaries within doors,
and yet more pleasure and diversion too.
It is true, the wives of the three were very handy
and cleanly within doors; and having learned the
English ways of dressing and cooking from one of
the other Englishmen, who, as I said, was a cook's
mate on board the ship, they dressed their husbands
victuals very nicely; whereas the other could not be
brought to understand it; but then the husband,
who, as I said, had been cook's mate, did it him-
self; but, as for the husbands of the three wives,
they loitered about, fetched turtles eggs, and caught
fish and birds: in a word, any thing but labour;
and they sared accordingly. The diligent lived well
and comfortably; and the slothful lived hard and
beggarly; and so I believe, generally speaking, it is
all over the world.
But
But now I come to a scene different from all that
had happened before, either to them or me; and the
origin of the story was this:
Early one morning there came on shore five or
six canoes of Indians, or savages, call them which
you please; and there is no room to doubt that they
came upon the old errand of feeding upon their
slaves; but that part was now so samiliar to the
Spaniards, and to our men too, that they did not
concern themselves about it, as I did; but, having
been made sensible by their experience, that their
only business was to lie concealed, and that, if
they were not seen by any of the savages, they would
go off again quietly, when their business was done,
having as yet not the lead notion of there being
any inhabitants in the ifland; I say, having been
made sensible of this, they had nothing to do but to
give notice to all the three plantations to keep with-
in doors, and not to shew themselves; only placing a
scout in a proper place, to give notice when the boats
went off to sea again.
This wasi without doubt, very right; but a dis-
aster spoiled all these measures, and made it known
among the savages, that there were inhabitants
there; which was, in the end, the desolation of
almost the. whole colony. After the canoes with
the savages were gone off, the Spaniards peeped
abroad again, and some of them had the curiosity
to go to the place where they had been, to fee what
they had been doing. Here, to their great surprise,
they found three savages left behind, and lying sast
asleep upon the ground; it was supposed they had
either been so gorged with their inhuman feast, that,
like
like beasts, they were asleep, and would not stir when
the others went, or they Were wandered into the
woods, and did not come back in time to be taken
in.
The Spaniards were greatly surprised at this fight,
and perfectly at a loss what do; the Spaniard go-
vernor, as it happened, was with them, and his ad-
vice was asked; but he professed he knew not what
to do; as for slaves, they had enough already; and
as to killing them, they were none of them inclined
to that; the Spaniard governor told me they could
not think of shedding innocent blood; for as to
them, the poor creatures had done no wrong, in-
vaded none of their property; and they thought
they had no just quarrel against them to take away
their lives.
And here I must, in justice to these Spaniards,
observe, that let all the accounts of Spanish cruelty
in Mexico and Peru be what they will, I never met
with seventeen men, of any nation whatsoever, in any
foreign country, who were so universally modest, tem-
perate, virtuous, so very good-humoured, and so
courteous, as these Spaniards; and, as to cruelty,
they had nothing of it in their very nature; no in-
humanity, no barbarity, no outrageous passions, and
yet all of them men of great courage and spirit.
Their temper and calmness had appeared in their
bearing the insufferable, usage of the three EngliJ}j-
men; and their justice and humanity appeared now
in the case of the savages, as above: after some con-
sultation, they resolved upon this, that they would
lie still awhile longer, till, if possible, these three
men might be gone; but then the governor Spa-
niard
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
nlard recollected, that the three savages had no boat;
and that, if they ivere left to rove about the island,
they would certainly discover that there were inha-
bitants in it, and so they should be undone that
way.
Upon this they went back again, and there lay
the fellows sast asleep still; so they resolved to
awaken them, and take them prisoners ; and they did
so: the poor fellows were strangely frighted when
they were seized upon and bound, and afraid, like
the women, that they mould be murdered and eaten;
for, it seems, those people think all the world do
as they do, eating men's flesh; but they were soon
made easy as to that; and away they carried them.
It was very happy for them, that they did not
carry them home to their castle; I mean to my pa-
lace under the hill; but they carried them first to
the bower, where was the chief of their country
work; such as the keeping the goats, the planting
the corn, &c. and afterwards they carried them to
the habitation of the two English?nen.
Here they were set to work, though it was not
much they had for them to do: and whether it was
by negligence in guarding them, or that they thought
the fellows could not mend themselves, I know not,
but one of them ran away; and, taking into the
woods, they could never hear of him more.
They had good reason to believe he got home
again soon after in some other boats or canoes of
savages, who came on shore three or four weeks af-
terwards, and who, carrying on their revels as usual,
went off again in two days time: this thought ter-
rified them exceedingly; for they concluded, and
that
that not without good cause indeed, that if this fel-
low got safe home among his comrades, he would
certainly give them an account that there were peo-
ple in the island, as also how weak and few they were;
for this savage, as I observed before, had never been
told, as it was very happy he had not, how many
they were, or where they lived, nor had he ever seen
or heard the fire of any of their guns, much less
had they shewn him any other of their retired
places, such as the cave in the valley, or the new
retreat which the two Englishmen had made, and
the like.
The first testimony they had, that this fellow had
given intelligence of them was, that about two
months after this, six canoes of savages, with about
seven or eight, or ten men in a canoe, came rowing
along the north-side of the island, where they never
used to come before, and landed about an hour after
sun-rise, at a convenient place, about a mile from
the habitation of the two Englishmen, where this
escaped man had been kept: as the Spaniard go-
vernor said, had they been all there, the damage
would not have been so much, for not a man of
them would have escaped: but the case differed now.
very much; for two men to fifty were too much
odds: the two men had the happiness to discover
them about a league off, so that it was above an hour
before they landed; and as they landed about a mile
from their huts, it was some time before they could
come at them. Now having great reason to believe
that they were betrayed, the first thing they did was
to bind the slaves which were left, and cause two of
the three men, whom they brought with the women,
who,
who, it seems, proved very saithful to them, to lead
them with their two wives, and whatever they could
carry away with them, to their retired place in the
woods, which I have spoken of above, and there to
bind the two fellows hand and foot till they heard
sarther.
In the next place, feeing the savages were alt
come on shore, and that they bent their course di-
rectly that way, they opened the fences where their
milch-goats were kept, and drove them all out, leav-
ing their goats to straggle into the wood, whither
they pleased, that the. savages might think they were
all bred wild; but the rogue who came with them
was too cunning for that, and gave them an ac-
count of it all; for they went directly to the place.
When the poor frighted men had secured their
wives and goods, they sent the other slave they had
of the three, who came with the women, and who
was at their place by accident, away to the Spa-
niards with all speed, to give them the alarm, and
desire speedy help; and in the mean time they took
their arms, and what ammunition they had, and
retreated towards the place in the wood where their
wives were sent, keeping at a distance; yet so that
they might see, if possible, which way the savages
took.
They had not gone sar, but that, from a rising
ground, they could see the little army of their ene-
mies come on directly to their habitation, and in a
moment more could fee all their huts and household-
stuff slaming up together, to their great grief and
mortisication; for they had a very great loss, and
to them irretrievable, at least for some time. They
kept
97
kept their station for awhile, till they found the sa-
vages, like wild beasts, spread themselves all over the
place, rummaging every way, and every place they
could think of, in search for prey; and, in particu-
lar, for the people, of whom it plainly appeared they
had intelligence.
The two Englishmen seeing this, thinking them-
selves not secure where they stood, as it was likely
some of the wild people might come that way, so
they might come too many together, thought it pro-
per to make another retreat about half a mile sar-
ther, believing, as it afterwards happened, that the
sarther they strolled, the fewer would be together.
The next halt was at the entrance into a very
thick grown part of the woods, and where an old
trunk of a tree stood, which was hollow, and vastly
large; and in this tree they both took their standing,
resolving to see what might offer.
They had not stood there long, but two of the
savages appeared running directly that way, as if
they had already notice where they stood, and were
coming up to attack them; and a little way sarther
they espied three more coming after them, and five
more beyond them, all coming the same way; be-
sides which, they saw seven or eight more at a dis-
tance, running another way; for, in a word, they
ran every way, like sportsmen beating for their
game.
The poor men were now in great perplexity, whe-
ther they should stand, and keep their posture, or
fly; but after a very short debate with themselves,
they considered, that if the savages ranged the coun-
try thus, before help came, they might, perhaps,
Vol. II. 'H " find
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
find out their retreat in the woods, and then all
would be lost; so they resolved to stand them there;
and if there were too many- to deal with, then they
would get to the top of the tree, from whence they
doubted not to defend themselves, fire excepted, as
long as their ammunition lasted, though all the sa-
vages that were landed, which were near fifty, were
to attack them.
Having resolved upon this, they next considered
whether they should fire at the two first, or wait for
the three, and so take the middle party; by which
the two and the five that followed would be sepa-
rated; at length they resolved to let the two first
pass by, unless they should spy them in the tree, and
come to attack them. The two first savages also
confirmed them in this resolution, by turning a little
from them towards another part of the wood; but
the three, and the five after them, came forwards
directly to the tree, as if they had known the Eng-
lishmen were there.
Seeing them come so straight towards them, they
resolved to take them in a line as they came; and
as they resolved to fire but one at a time, perhaps
the first shot might hit them all three; to which
purpose, the man who was to fire, put three or
four bullets into his piece, and having a sair loop-
hole, as it were, from a broken hole in the tree, he
took a sure aim, without being seen, waiting till they
were within about thirty yards of the tree, so that
he could not miss.
While they were thus waiting, and the savages
came on, they plainly saw, that one of the three
was the run-away savage that had escaped from
them,
99
them, and they both knew him distinctly, and re-
solved, that, if possible, he should not escape, though
they should both fire; so the other stood ready with
his piece, that if he did not drop at the first shot, he
should be sure to have a second.
But the first was too good a marksman to miss his
aim; for, as the savages kept near one another, a
little behind in a line, in a word, he fired, and hit
two of them directly: the foremost was killed out-
right, being shot in the head; the second, which
was the run-away Indian, was shot through the
body, and fell, but was not quite dead; and the
third had a little scratch in the shoulder, perhaps by
the same ball that went through the body of the se-
cond; and being dreadfully frighted, though not
much hurt, sat down upon the ground, screaming
and yelling in a hideous manner.
The five that were behind, more frighted with the
noise than sensible of their danger, stood still at
first; for the woods made the found a thousand times
bigger than it really was; the echoes rattling from
one side to another, and the fowls rising from all
parts, screaming and making, every sort, a several
kind of noise, according to their kind, just as it was
when I fired the first gun that, perhaps, was ever
shot off in that place since it was an island.
However, all being silent again, and they not
knowing what the matter was, came on unconcerned,
till they came to that place where their companions
lay, in a condition miserable enough; and here the
poor ignorant creatures, not sensible that they were
within reach of the same mischief, stood all of a
huddle over the wounded man, talking, and, as may
Ha be
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
be supposed, enquiring of him how he came to be
hurt; aud who, 'tis very rational to believe, told
them that a flash of fire first, and immediately after
that, thunder from their gods, had killed those two,
and wounded him: This, I say, is rational; for no-
thing is more certain than that, as they saw no man
near them, so they had never heard a gun in all their
lives, or so much as heard of a gun; neither knew
they any thing of killing or wounding at a distance,
with fire and bullets; if they had, one might rea-
sonably believe, that they would not have stood
fo unconcerned, in viewing the sate of their fel-
lows, without some apprehension of their own.
Our two men, though, as they confessed to me,
it grieved them to be obliged to kill so many poor
creatures, who at the same time had no notion of
their danger; yet, having them all thus in their
power, and the first having loaded his piece again,
resolved to let fly both together among them; and
singling out by agreement which to aim at, they shot
together, and killed, or very much wounded, four
of them; the fifth, frighted even to death, though
not hurt, fell with the rest; so that our men, seeing
them all sall together, thought they had killed them
all.
The belief that the savages were all killed, made
our two men come boldly out from the tree before
they had charged their guns again, which was a
wrong step; and they were under some surprise,
when they came to the place, and found no less than
four of the men alive, and of them, two very little
hurt, and one not at all: this obliged them to sall
upon them with the stocks of their musquets; and,
firtt,
IOI
first, they made sure of the run-away savage, that
had been the cause of all the mischief; and of ano-
ther that was hurt in his knee, and put them out of
their pain; then the man that was not hurt at all
came and kneeled down to them, with his two hands
held up, and made piteous moan to them by ges-
tures and signs, for his life; but could not say one
word to them that they could understand.
However, they signified to him to sit down at the
foot of a tree thereby; and one of the Engli/otiten,
with a piece of rope-twine, which he had by great
chance in his pocket, tied his feet sast together, and
his hands behind him, and there they left him; and,
with what speed they could, made after the other
two which were gone before, fearing they, or any
more of them, should find the way to their covered
place in the woods, where their wives, and the few
goods they had left lay: they came once in sight of
the two men, but it was at a great distance; how-
ever, they had the satissaction to fee them cross over
a valley, towards the sea, the quite contrary way
from that which led to their retreat, which they were
afraid of; and, being satisfied with that, they went
back to the tree where they left their prisoner, who
as they supposed, was delivered by his comrades; for
he was gone, and the two pieces of rope-yarn, with
which they had bound him, lay just at the foot of
the tree.
They were now in as great a concern as before,
not knowing what course to take, or how near the
enemy might be, or in what numbers,; so they re-
solved to go away to the place where their wives
were, to fee if all was well there, and to make them
H 3 easy,
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
easy, who were in fright enough to be sure; for
though the savages were their own country folks, yet
they were most terribly afraid of them, and perhaps
the more, for the knowledge they had of them.
When they came thither, they found the savages
had been in the wood, and very near the place, but
had not found it; for indeed, it was inaccessible, by
the trees standing so thick, as before, unless the per-
sons seeking it had been directed by those that knew
it, which these were not; they found, therefore,
every thing very safe, only the women in a terrible
. fright ; while they were here, they had the comfort
of seven of the Spaniards coming to their assistance;
the other ten, with their servants, and old Friday,
I mean Friday's sather, were gone in a body to de-
fend their bower, and the corn and cattle that were
kept there, in case the savages should have roved
over to that side of the country; but they did not
spread so sar. With the seven Spaniards came one of
the savages, who, as I said, were their prisoners for-
merly, and with them also came the savage whom
the Englishmen had left bound hand and foot at the
tree; for it seems they came that way, saw the
slaughter of the seven men, and unbound the eighth,
and brought him along with them, where, however,
they were obliged to bind him again, as they had
done the two others, who were left when the third
ran away.
The prisoners began now to be a burden to them;
and they were so afraid of their escaping, that they
thought they were under an absolute necessity to
kill them for their own preservation: however, the
Spaniard governor would not consent to it; but or-
dered,
dered, that they should be sent out of the way to
my old cave in the valley, and be kept there, with
two Spaniards to guard them, and give them food:
which was done; and they were bound there hand
and foot for that night.
When the Spaniards came, the two Englishmen
were so encouraged, that they could not satisfy
themselves to stay any longer there; but taking five
of the Spaniards, and themselves, with four mus-
quets and a pistol among them, and two stout quar-
ter staves, away they went in quest of the savages;
and first, they came to the tree where the men lay
that had been killed; but it was easy to see, that
some more of the savages had been there; for they
attempted to carry their dead men away, and had
dragged two of them a good way, but had given it
over; from thence they advanced to the first rising
ground, where they had stood and seen their camp
destroyed, and where they had the mortification still
to see some of the smoke; but neither could they
here see any of the savages: they then resolved,
though with all, possible caution, to go forward to-
wards their ruined plantation: but a little before
they came thither, coming in sight of the sea shore,
they saw plainly the savages all embarking again in
their canoes, in order to be gone.
They seemed sorry at first that there was no way
to come at them, to give them a parting blow; but
upon the whole, were very well satisfied to be rid of
them.
The poor Englishmen being now twice ruined, and
all their improvements destroyed, the rest all agreed
H 4 to
to come and help them to rebuild, and to assist them
with needful supplies. Their three countrymen,
who were not yet noted for having the least inclina-
tion to do any thing good, yet, as soon as they heard
of it (for they, living remote, knew nothing till all
was over) came and offered their help and assistance,
and did very friendly work for several days, to restore
their habitations, and make necessaries for them; and
thus, in a little time, they were set upon their legs
again.
About two days after this, they had the sarther sa-
tissaction of seeing three of the savages canoes come
driving on shore, and, at some distance from them,
with two drowned men; by which they had reason
to believe, that they had met with a storm at sea, and
had over-set some of them; for it blew very hard
the night after they went oss.
However, as some might miscarry, so on the
other hand, enough of them escaped to inform the
rest, as well of what they had done, as of what hap-
pened to them; and to whet them on to another en-
terprise of the same nature, which they, it seems,
resolved to attempt, with susficient force to carry all
before them; for, except what the first man had told
them of inhabitants, they could say little to it of
their own knowledge; for they never saw one man,
and the fellow being killed that had affirmed it, they
had no other witness to confirm it to them.
It was five or six months after this, before they
heard any more of the savages, in which time our
men were in hopes they had not forgot their former
bad luck, or had given over the hopes of better;
when, on a sudden, they were invaded with a most
formi-
formidable fleet, of no less than twenty-eight canoes,
full of savages, armed with bows and arrows, great
clubs, wooden swords, and such like engines of
war; and they brought such numbers with them,
that, in short, it put all our people into the utmost
consternation.
As they came on shore in the evening, and at the
eastermost side of the island, our men had that night
to consult and consider what to do; and, in the first
place, knowing that their being entirely concealed
was their only safety before, and would much more
be so now, while the number of their enemies was
so great, they therefore resolved, first of all, to take
down the huts which were built for the two English'
men, and drive away their goats to the old cave;
because they supposed the savages would go directly
thither, as soon as it was day, to play the old game
over again, though they did not now land within
two leagues of it.
In the next place, they drove away all the flock of
goats they had at the old bower, as I called it, which
belonged to the Spaniards; and, in short, left as
little appearance of inhabitants any where as possible;
and the next morning early they posted themselves
with all their force, at the plantation of the two men,
waiting for their coming. As they guessed, so it
happened; these new invaders, leaving their canoes
at the east end of the island, came ranging along the
shore, directly towards the place, to the number of
two hundred and fifty, as near as our men could
judge. Our army was but small indeed; but, that
which was worse, they had not arms for all their
number
number neither: The whole account, it seems, stood
thus: First, as to men:
17 Spaniards.
5 Englishmen.
1 Old Friday, or Friday's sather.
3 Slaves, taken with the women, who proved
very saithful.
3 Other slaves who lived with the Spaniards*
29
To arm these they had:
11 Musquets.
5 Pistols.
3 Fowling pieces.
5 Musquets, or fowling pieces, which were
taken by me from the mutinous sea-
men whom I reduced.
2 Swords.
3 Old halberts.
29
To their slaves they did not give either musquet
or fusil, but they had every one an halbert, or a long
stasf, like a quarter stasf, with a great spike of iron
fastened into each end of it, and by his side a hatchet;
also every one of our men had hatchets. Two of
the women could not be prevailed upon, but they
would come into the fight; and they had bows and
arrows, which the Spaniards had taken from the sa-
vages, when the first action happened, which I have
spoken
spoken of, where the Indians fought with one ano-
ther, and the women had hatchets too.
The Spaniard governor, whom I have described
so often, commanded the whole; and William Atkins,
who, though a dreadful fellow for wickedness, was a
most daring bold fellow, commanded under him.
The savages came forward like lions, and our men,
which was the worst of their sate, had no advan-
tage in their situation; only that Will Atkins, who
now proved a most useful fellow, with six men, was
planted just behind a small thicket of bustles, as an
advanced guard, with orders to let the first of them
pass by, and then fire into the middle of them; and,
as soon as he had fired, to make his retreat, as nim-
bly as he could, round a part of the wood, and so
come in behind the Spaniards where they stood,
having a thicket of trees all before them.
When the savages came on, they ran straggling
about every way in heaps, out of all manner of or-
der; and Will Atkins let about fifty of them pass by
him; then, seeing the rest come in a very thick
throng, he orders three of his men to fire, having
loaded their mufquets with six or seven bullets a-
piece, about as big as large pistol bullets. How
many they killed or wounded, they knew not; but
the consternation and surprise was inexpressible among
the savages, who were frighted to the last degree, to
hear such a dreadful noise, and see their men killed,
and others hurt, but fee nobody that did it; when
in the middle of their fright, William Atkins, and
his other three, let fly again among the thickest of
them; and in less than a minute, the first three,
being loaded again, gave them a third volley.
Had
Had William Atkins and his men retired immedi-
ately, as soon as they had fired, as they were or-
dered to do; or had the rest of the body been at
hand, to have poured in their shot continually, the
savages had been effectually routed; for the terror
that was among them came principally from this;
viz. That they were killed by the Gods with thun-
der and lightning, and could fee nobody that hurt
them; but William Atkins, staying to load again,
discovered the cheat; some of the savages, who were
at a distance, spying them, came upon them behind;
and though Atkins and his men fired at them also,
two or three times, and killed above twenty, retir-
ing as sast as they could, yet they wounded Atkins
himself, and killed one of his fellow Englishmen with
their arrows, as they did afterwards one Spaniard,
and one of the Indian slaves who came with the wo-
men; this flave was a most gallant fellow, and fought
most desperately, killing five of them with his own
hand, having no weapon but one of the armed
staves, and an hatchet.
Our men being thus hard laid at, Atkins wound-
ed, and two other men killed, retreated to a rising
ground in the wood; and the Spaniards, after firing
three vollies upon them, retreated also; for their
number was so great, and they were so desperate,
that though above fifty of them were killed, and
more than so many wounded, yet they came on in
the teeth of our men, fearless of danger, and shot
their arrows like a cloud; and it was observed, that
their wounded men, who were not quite disabled,
were made outrageous by their wounds, and fought
like madmen.
When
When our men retreated, they left the Spaniard
and the Englishman, that were killed, behind them;
and the savages, when they came up to them, killed,
them over again in a wretched manner, breaking
their arms, legs, and heads, with their clubs, and
wooden swords, like true savages: But, finding our
men were gone, they did not seem inclined to pursue
them, but drew themselves up in a kind of a ring,
which is, it seems, their custom; and shouted twice,
in token of their victory; after which, they had the
mortification to fee several of their wounded men
fall, dying with the mere loss of blood.
The Spaniard governor having drawn his little
body up together, upon a rising ground, Atkins,
though he was wounded, would have had him march-
ed, and charged them again all together at once; but
the Spaniard replied, Seignior Atkins, you fee how
their wounded men fight; let them alone till morn-
ing; all these wounded men will be stiff and sore
with their wounds, and saint with the loss of blood;
and so we shall have the fewer to engage.
The advice was good; but Will Atkins replied
merrily, That's true, Seignior, and so shall I too;
and that's the reason I would go on, while I am
warm. Well, Seignior Atkins, says the Spaniard,
you have behaved gallantly, and done your part; we
will fight for you, if you cannot come on; but I
think it best to stay till morning: so they waited.
But as it was a clear moon-light night, and they
found the savages in great disorder about their dead
and wounded men, and a great hurry and noise
among them where they lay, they afterwards resolved
to sall upon them in the night, especially if they
could
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
could come to give them but one volley before they
were discovered. This they had a sair opportunity
to do; for one of the two Englishmen, in whole
quarter it was where the fight began, led them round
between the woods and the sea-side, westward, and
turning short south, they came so near where the
thickest of them lay, that before they were seen or
heard, eight of them fired in among them, and did
dreadful execution upon them; in half a minute
more eight others fired after them, pouring in their
small {hot in such a quantity, that abundance were
killed and wounded; and all this while they were
not able to fee who hurt them, or which way to
fly.
The Spaniards charged again, with the utmost ex-
pedition, and then divided themselves into three
bodies, and resolved to sall in among them all toge-
ther: they had in each body eight persons; that is
to say, twenty-four, whereof were twenty-two men,
and the two women, who, by the way, fought des-
perately.
They divided the fire-arms equally in each party*
and so of the halberts and staves. They would have
had the women keep back; but they said, they were
resolved to die with their husbands. Having thus
formed their little army, they marched out from
among, the trees, and came up to the teeth of the
enemy, shouting and hallooing as loud as they could;
the savages stood all together, but were in the utmost
confusion, hearing the noise of our men shouting
from three quarters together; they would have
fought if they had seen us; and, as soon as we
came near enough to be seen, some arrows were
foot,
Ill
shot, and poor old Friday was wounded, though not
dangerously. But our men gave them no time;
but, running up to them, fired among them three
ways, and then fell in with the but-ends of their
mufquets, their swords, armed staves, and hatchets;
and laid about them so well, that, in a word, they
set up a dismal screaming and howling, flying to save
their lives which way soever they could.
Our men were tired with the execution; and
killed, or mortally wounded, in the two fights, about
180 of them; the rest, being frighted out of their
wits, scoured through the woods, and over the
hills, with all the speed that fear and nimble feet
could help them to do; and as we did not trouble
ourselves much to pursue them, they got all together
to the sea-side, where they landed, and where their
canoes lay. But their disaster was not at an end
yet; for it blew a terrible storm of wind that even-
ing from the sea-ward; so that it was impossible for
them to put off; nay, the storm continuing all night,
when the tide came up, their canoes were most of
them driven by the surge of the sea so high upon the
shore, that it required infinite toil to get them off;
and some of them were even dashed to pieces against
the beach, or against one another.
Our men, though glad of their victory, yet got
little rest that night; but having refreshed themselves
as well as they could, they resolved to march to that
part of the island where the savages were fled, and
fee what posture they were in. This necessarily led
them over the place where the fight had been, and
where they found several of the poor creatures not
quite dead, and yet past recovering life; a fight dis-
agreeable
agreeable enough to generous minds; for a truly
great man, though obliged by the law of battle to
destroy his enemy, takes no delight in his misery.
However, there was no need to give any order in
this case; for their own savages, who were their ser-
vants, dispatched those poor creatures with their
hatchets.
At length they came in view of the place where
the more miserable remains of the savages' army lay,
where there appeared about 100 still; their posture
was generally fitting upon the ground, with their
knees up towards their mouth, and the head put be-
tween the hands, leaning down upon the knees.
"When our men came within two musquet shot of
them, the Spaniard governor ordered two musquets
to be fired without ball, to alarm them; this he did,
that by their countenance he might know what to ex-
pect, viz. Whether they were still in heart to fight,
or were so heartily beaten, as to be dispirited and dis-
couraged, and so he might manage accordingly.
This stratagem took; for, as soon as the savages
heard the first gun, and saw the flash of the second,
they started up upon their feet in the greatest con-
sternation imaginable; and, as our men advanced
swistly towards them, they all ran screaming and
yawling away, with a kind of an howling noise,
which our men did not understand, and had never
heard before; and thus they ran up the hills into the
country.
At first, our men had much rather the weather had
been calm, and they had all gone away to sea; but
they did not then consider, that this might probably
have been the occasion of their coming again in such
multi-
multitudes as not to be resisted; or, at least, to
come so many and so often, as would quite desolate
the island, and starve them: Will Atkins therefore,
who, notwithstanding his wound, kept always with
them, proved the best counsellor in this case: his
advice was, to take the advantage that offered, and
clap in between them and their boats, and so deprive
them of the capacity of ever returning any more to
plague the island.
They consulted long about this, and some were
against it, for fear of making the wretches fly into
the woods, and live there desperate; and so they
should have them to hunt like wild beasts, be afraid
to stir about their business, and have their plantation
continually risled, all their tame goats destroyed,
and, in short, be reduced to a life of continual
distress.
Will Atkins told them, they had better have to do
with 100 men, than with 100 nations; that as they
must destroy their boats, so they must destroy the
men, or be all of them destroyed themselves. In a
word, he shewed them the necessity of it so plainly,
that they all came into it; so they went to work im-
mediately with the boats, and, getting some dry
wood together from a dead tree, they tried to set
some of them on fire; but they were so wet, that
they would scarce burn. However, the fire so burned
the upper part, that it soon made them unfit for
swimming in the sea as boats. When the Indians saw
what they were about, some of them came running
out of the woods; and coming as near as they could
to our men, kneeled down and cried, Oa, Oa, Wa-
Vol. II. I ramokoa,
LllrE AND ADVENTURES
ramokoa, and some other words of their language,
which none of the others understood any thing of;
but as they made pitiful gestures, and strange noises,
it was easy to understand they begged to have their
boats spared, and that they would be gone, and ne-
ver return thither again.
But our men were now satisfied, that they had no
way to preserve themselves, or to save their colony,
but effectually to prevent any of these people from
ever going home again; depending upon this, that
if ever so much as one of them got back into their
country to tell the story, the colony was undone; so
that, letting them know that they should not have
any mercy, they sell to work with their canoes, and
destroyed them every one that the storm had not de-
stroyed before; at the sight of which, the savages
raised a hideous cry in the woods, which our people
heard plain enough; aster which they ran about the
ifland like distracted men; so that, in a word, our
men did not really know at first what to do with
them.
Nor did the Spaniards, with all their prudence,
consider that while they made those people thus des-
perate, they ought to have kept good guard at the
same time upon their plantations; for though it is
true they had driven away their cattle, and the In-
dians did not find their main retreat, I mean my old
castle at the hill, nor the cave in the valley; yet
they found out my plantation at the bower, and
pulled it all to pieces, and all the fences and plant-
ing about it; trod all the corn under scot; tore up
the vines and grapes, being just then almost ripe;
and did oui men an inestimable damage, though,
to
"5
to themselves, not one sarthing's worth of ser-
vice.
Though our men were able to fight them upon all
occasions, yet they were in no condition to pursue
them, or hunt them up and down; for as they were
-k*, two nimble of foot for our men when they found
them single, so our men durst not go about single,
for fear of being surrounded with their numbers;
the best was, they had no weapons; for though they
had bows, they had no arrows left, nor any mate-
rials to make any, nor had they any edged tool or
weapon among them.
The extremity and distress they were reduced to
was great, and indeed deplorable, but at the same
time our men were also brought to very hard cir-
cumstances by them; for though their retreats were
preserved, yet their provision was destroyed, and
their harvest spoiled; and what to do, or which way
to turn themselves, they knew not; the only refuge
they had now was, the stock of cattle they had in the
valley by the cave, and some little corn which grew
there. The three Englifimen, William Atkins and
his comrades, were now reduced to two, one of
them being killed by an arrow, which struck him
on the side of his head, just under the temples, so
that he never spoke more; and it was very remark-
able, that this was the same barbarous fellow who
cut the poor savage slave with his hatchet, and who
afterwards intended to have murdered the Spa-
niards.
I looked upon their case to have been worse at this
time than mine was at any time after I first disco- UJ,,^x
vered the grains of barley and rice, and got into the
I 2 method
method of planting and raising my corn, and my
tame cattle; for now' they had, as I may say, an
hundred wolves upon the island, which would de-
vour every thing they could come at, yet could be
very hardly come at themselves.
The first thing they concluded, when they saw
what their circumstances were, was, that they would,
if possible, drive them up to the sarther part of the
island, south-east, that if any more savages came on
shore, they might not sind one another; then, that
they would daily hunt and harrass them, and kill as
many of them as they could come at, till they had
reduced their number; and if they could at last tame
them, and bring them to any thing, they would
give them corn, and teach them how to plant, and
live upon their daily labour.
In order to this, they followed them, and so ter-
rified them with their guns, that in a few days, if
any of them fired a gun at an Indian, if he did not-
hit him, yet he would sall down for fear; and so
dreadfully frighted they were, that they kept out of
sight sarther and sarther, till at last our men follow-
ing them, and every day almost killing and wound-
ing some of them, they kept up in the woods and
hollow places so much, that it reduced them to the
utmost misery for want of food; and many were
afterwards found dead in the woods, without any
hurt, but merely starved to death.
When our men found this, it made their hearts
relent, and pity moved them; especially the Spaniard
governor, who was the most gentleman-like, gene-
rous minded man that ever I met with in my life;
and he proposed, if possible, to take one of them
alive,
II7
alive, and bring him to understand what they meant,
so sar as to be able to act as interpreter, and to go
among them, and fee if they might be brought to
some conditions, that might be depended upon, to
save their lives, and do us no spoil.
It was some time before anv of them could be
taken; but being weak, and half-starved, one of
them was at last surprised, and made a prisoner; he
was sullen at first, and would neither eat nor drink;
but sinding himsels kindly used, and victuals given
him, and no violence offered him, he at last grew
tractable, and came to himself.
They brought old Friday to him, who talked of-
ten with him, and told him how kind the others
would be to them all; that they would not only save
their lives, but would give them a part of the island
to live in, provided they would give satissaction;
that they should keep in their own bounds, and not 1
come beyond them, to injure or prejudice others;
and that they should have corn given them, to plant
and make it grow for their bread, and some bread
given them for their present subsistence ., and old
Friday bade the fellow go and talk with the rest of
his countiymen, and hear what they said to it; as-
suring them, that if they did not agree immediately
they should all be destroyed.
The poor wretches, thoroughly humbled, and re-
duced in number to about thirty-seven, closed with
the proposal at the first offer, and begged to have
some food given them; upon which twelve Spaniards
and two Englishmen, well armed, and three Indian
slaves, and old Friday, marched to the place where
they were; the three Indian slaves carried them a
I 3 large
large quantity of bread, and some rice boiled up to
cakes, and dried in the fun, and three live goats;
and they were ordered to go to the side of an hill,
where they sat down, eat the provisions very thank-
fully, and were the most saithful fellows to their
words that could be thought of; for, except when
they came to beg victuals and directions, they never
came out of their bounds; and there they lived when
I came to the island, and I went to fee them.
They had taught them both to plant corn, make
bread, breed tame goats, and milk them; they want-
ed nothing but wives, and they soon would have
been a nation: they were confined to a neck of land,
surrounded with high rocks behind them, and lying
plain towards the sea before them, on the south east
corner of the island; they had land enough, and it
was very good and fruitful ; for they had a piece of
land about a mile and a half broad, and three or
four miles in length.
Our men taught them to make wooden spades,
such as I made for myself; and gave among them
twelve hatchets, and three or four knives; and there
they lived the most subjected innocent creatures that
were ever heard of.
After this the colony enjoyed a perfect tranquillity,
with respect to the savages, till I came to re-visit them,
which was in about two years; not but that now
and then some canoes of savages came on more for
their triumphal, unnatural feasts; but as they were
of several nations, and, perhaps, had never heard
of those that came before, or the reason of it, they
did not make any search or enquiry after their country-
men j
men; and if they had, it would have been very hard
for them to have found them out.
Thus, I think, I have given a full account of all
that happened to them, to my return, at least, that
was worth notice. The Indians, or savages, were
wonderfully civilized by them, and they frequently
went among them; but forbid, on pain of death,
any of the Indians coming to them, because they
would not have their settlement betrayed again.
One thing was very remarkable, viz. that they
taught the savages to make wicker-work, or baskets;
but they soon out-did their masters; for they made
abundance of most ingenious things in wicker-work;
'particularly, all forts of baskets, sieves, bird cages,
cup-boards, Sec. as also chairs to sit on, stools, beds,
couches, and abundance of other things, being very
ingenious at such work, when they were once put in
the way of it.
My coming was a particular relief to these people,
because we furnished them with knives, scissars, spades,
shovels, pick-axes, and all things of that kind which
they could want.
With the help of these tools they were so very
handy, that they came, at last, to build up their huts,
or houses, very handsomely; raddling, or working
it up like basket-work all the way round, which was
a very extraordinary piece of ingenuity, and looked
very odd; but was an exceeding good fence, as well
against heat, as against all sorts of vermin; and our
men were so taken with it, that they got the wild sa-
vages to come and do the like for them; so that when
I came to fee the two Englishmen's colonies, they
looked, at a distance, as if they lived all like bees in
I 4 a hive j
a hive; and as for Will Atkins, who was now be-
come a very industrious, necessary, and sober fellow,
he had made himself such a tent of basket-work, as
I believe was never seen. It was 120 paces round on
the outside, as I measured by my steps; the walls
were as close worked as a basket, in pannels or
squares, thirty-two in number, and very strong, stand-
ing about seven feet high: in the middle was ano-
ther not above 22 paces round, but built stronger,
being eight square in its form, and in the eight cor-
ners stood eight very strong posts, roy ad the top of
which he laid strong pieces, joined together with
wooden pins, from which he raised a pyramid before
the roof of eight rafters, very handsome, I assure
you, and joined together very well, though he had
no nails, and only a few iron spikes, which he had
made himself too, out of the old iron that I had left
there; and, indeed, this fellow shewed abundance
of ingenuity in several things which he had no know-
ledge of; he made himself a forge, with a pair of
wooden bellows to blow the fire; he made himself
charcoal for his work, and he formed out of one of
the iron crows a middling good anvil to hammer up-
on; in this manner he made many things, but espe-
cially hooks, staples and spikes, bolts and hinges.
But to return to the house; after he pitched the roof
of his innermost tent, he. worked it up between the
rafters with basket-work, so firm, and thatched that
over again so ingeniously with rice straw, and over
that a large leaf of a tree, which covered the top,
that his house was as dry as if it had been tiled or
slated. Indeed he owned that the savages made the
basket-work for him.
, The
121
The outer circuit was covered, as a learl-to, all
round this inner apartment, and long rafters lay
from the 32 angles to the top posts of the inner
house, being about twenty feet distant; so that there
was a space like a walk within the outer wicker-wall,
and without the inner, near twenty feet wide.
The inner place he partitioned off with the same
wicker-work, but much sairer, and divided into six
apartments, for that he had six rooms on a floor,
and out of every one of these there was a door; first,
into the entry, or coming into the main tent; and
another door into the space or walk that was round
it; so that this walk was also divided into six equal
parts, which served not only for a retreat, but to
store up any necessaries which the samily had occasion
for. These six spaces not taking up the whole cir-
cumference, what other apartments the outer circle
had, were thus ordered: as soon as you were in at
the door of the outer circle, you had a short passage
straight before you to the door of the inner house; but
on either side was a wicker partition, and a door in
it, by which you went, first, into a large room or
store-house, 20 feet wide, and about 30 feet long,
raid through that into another not quite so long: so
that in the outer circle were ten handsome rooms,
six of which were only to be come at through the
apartments of the inner tent, and served as closets or
retired rooms to the respective chambers of the inner
circle; and four large warehouses or barns, or what
you please to call them, which went in through one
another, two on either hand of the passage that led
through the outer door to the inner tent.
Such
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
Such a piece of basket-work, I believe, was never
seen in the world; nor an house or tent so neatly.
contrived, much less so built: in this great bee-hive
lived the three samilies; that is to say, Will Atkins,
and his companions; the third was killed, but his
wife remained with three children; for she was, it
seems, big with child when he died; and the other
two were not at all backward to give the widow her
full share of every thing, I mean, as to their corn,
milk, grapes, &c. and when they killed a kid, or
found a turtle on the shore; so that they all lived well
enough, though it was true, they were not so indus-
trious aa the other two, as has been observed already.
One thing, however, cannot be omitted, viz. that,
as for religion, 1 don't know that there was any
thing of that kind among them; they4pretty often,
indeed, put one another in mind, that there was a
God, by the very common method of seamen, viz.
swearing by his name; nor were their poor, igno-
rant savage wives much the better for having been
married to Christians, as we must call them; for as
they knew very little of God themselves, so they
were utterly incapable of entering into any discourse
with their wives about a God, or to talk any thing
to them concerning religion.
The utmost of all the improvement which I can say
the wives had made from them, was, that they had
taught them to speak English pretty well; and all the
children they had, which were near twenty in all,
were taught to speak Englislj too, from their first
learning to speak, though they at first spoke it
in a very broken manner, like their mothers. There
wsre none of those children above six years old
when I came thither; for it was not much above
seven
seven years that they had fetched these five savage
ladies over, but they had all been pretty fruitful, for
they had all children, more or less: I think the cook's
mate's wife was big of her sixth child; and the mo-
thers were all a good fort of well governed, quiet, labo-
rious women, modest and decent, helpful to one an-
other, mighty observant and subject to their masters,
I cannot call them husbands; and wanted nothing
but to be well instructed in the Christian religion,
and to be legally married; both which were happily
brought about afterwards by my means, or, at least,
by the consequence of my coming among them.
Having thus given an account of the colony in
general, and pretty much of my five runagade Eng-
lishmen, I must say something of the Spaniards, who
were the main body of the samily; and in whose
story there are some incidents also remarkable
enough.
I had a great many discourses with them about
their circumstances, when they were among the sa-
vages: they told me readily, that they had no in-
stances to give of their application or ingenuity in
that country; that they were a poor, miserable, de-
jected handful of people; that if means had been put
into their hands, they had yet so abandoned them-
selves to despair, and so sunk under the weight of
their misfortunes, that they thought of nothing but
starving. One of them, a grave and very sensible
man, told me, he was convinced they were in the
wrong; that it was not the part of wife men to give
up themselves to their misery, but always to take hold
of the helps which reason offered, as well sor present
support, as for future deliverance; he told me, that
grief
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
grief was the most senseless, insignificant passion in
the world; for that it regarded only things past,
which were generally impossible to be recalled or to
be remedied, but had no view to things to come,
and had no share in any thing that looked like deli-
verance, but rather added to the affliction than pro-
posed a remedy; and upon this, he repeated a Spa-
nisli proverb; which, though I cannot repeat in just
the same words that he spoke it, yet I remember I
made it into an English proverb of my own, thus:
In trouble to be troubled.
Is to have your trouble doubled.
He then ran on in remarks upon all the little im-
provements I had made in my solitude; my unwea-
ried application, as he called it, and how I had made
a condition, which, in its circumstances, was at first
much worse than their's, a thousand times more
happy than their's was, even now, when they were
altogether: he told me, it was remarkable, that
Englislmen had a greater presence of mind, in their
distress, than any people that ever he met with; that
their unhappy nation, and the Portuguese, were the
worst men in the world to struggle with misfortunes;
for that their first step in dangers, after common
efforts are over, was always to despair, lie down un-
der it and die, without rousing their thoughts up to
proper remedies for escape.
I told him, their case and mine differed exceed-
ingly; that they were cast upon the shore without
necessaries, without supply of food, or of present
sustenance, till they could provide it: that it is true, I
had this disadvantage and discomfort, that I was
alone; but then the supplies I had providentially
thrown
thrown into my hands, by the unexpected driving ot
the ship on shore, was such a help as would have en-
couraged any creature in the world to have applied
himself as I had done: Seignior, says the Spaniard,
had we poor Spaniards been in your case, we should
never have gotten half those things out of the ship
as you did: nay, says he, we should never have found
means to have gotten a raft to carry them, or to
have gotten a raft on shore without boat or sail; and
how much less should we have done, said he, if any
of us had been alone! Well, I defired him to abate
his compliment, and go on with the history of
their coming on shore, where they landed: he told
me, they unhappily landed at a place where there
were people without provisions; whereas, had they had
the common fense to have put off to sea again, and
gone to another island a little sarther, they had found
provisions, though without people; there being an
island that way, as they had been told, where there
were provisions, though no people; that is to say,
that the Spaniards of Trinidad had frequently been
there, and filled the island with goats and hogs at
several times; where they have bred in such multi-
tudes, and where turtle and sea fowls were in such
plenty, that they could have been in no want of
flesh, though they had found no bread; whereas
here they were only sustained with a few roots and
herbs, which they understood not, and which had
no substance in them, and which the inhabitants gave
them sparingly enough, and who could treat them
no better, unless they would turn canibals, and eat
men's flesh, which was the great dainty of the
country.
They
They gave me an account how many ways they
strove to civilize the savages they were with, and to
teach them rational customs in the ordinary way of
living; but in vain: and how they retorted it upon
them, as unjust, that they, who came thither for
assistance and support, should attempt to set up for
instructors of those that gave them bread; intimat-
ing, it seems, that none mould set up for the in-
structors of others, but those who could live without
them.
They gave me dismal accounts of the extremities
they were driven to; how sometimes they were ma-
ny days without any food at all; the island they were
upon being inhabited by a sort of savages that lived
more indolent, and, for that reason, were less sup-
plied with the necessaries of life, than they had rea-
son to believe others were in the same part of the
world; and yet they found that these savages were
less ravenous and voracious, than those who had
better supplies of food.
Also they added, that they could not but fee with
what demonstrations of wisdom and goodness, the
governing Providence of God directs the event of
things in the world; which, they said, appeared in
their circumstances; for if, pressed by the hardships
they were under, and the barrenness of the country
where they were, they had searched after a better
place to live in, they had then been out of the way
of the relief that happened to them by my means.
Then they gave me an account, how the savages,
whom they lived among, expected them to go out
with them into their wars; and it was true, that, as
they had fire-arms with them, had they not had the
disaster
disaster to lose their ammunition, they should not
have been serviceable only to their friends, but have
made themselves terrible both to friends and enemies;
but being without powder and shot, and in a con-
dition, that they could not in reason deny to go out
with their landlords to their wars: when thev came
in the field of battle, they were in a worse condition
than the savages themselves; for they neither had
bows nor arrows, nor could they use those the sa-
vages gave them; so that they could do nothing but
stand still, and be wounded with arrows, till they
came up to the teeth of their enemy; and then, in-
deed, the three halberts they had were of use to
them; and they would often drive a whole little
army before them, with those halberts and sharpened
sticks put into the muzzles of their muskets: but
that for all this, they were sometimes surrounded
with multitudes, and in great danger from their ar-
rows; till at last they found the way to make them-
selves large targets of wood, which they covered
with skins of wild beasts, whose names they knew
not; and these covered them from the arrows of the
savages; that, notwithstanding these, they were
sometimes in great danger, and were once five of
them knocked down together, with the clubs of the
savages, which was the time when one of them was
taken prisoner, that is to say, the Spaniard whom I
had relieved: That at first they thought he had been
killed, but when afterwards they heard he was taken
prisoner, they were under the greatest grief imagi-
nable, and would willingly have all ventured their
lives to have rescued him.
They
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
They told me, that when they were so knocked
down, the rest of their company rescued them, and
stood over them fighting,, till they were come to them-
selves, all but he who they thought had been dead;
and then they made their way with their halberts and
pieces, standing close together in a line, through a
body of above a thousand savages, beating down all
that came in their way, got the victory over their
enemies, but to their great sorrow, because it was
with the loss of their friend; whom the other party,
finding him alive, carried off with some others, as
I gave an account in my former.
They described most affectionately, how they were
surprised with joy at the return of their friend and
companion in misery, who they thought had been de-
voured by wild beasts of the worst of kind, viz. by
wild men; and, yet how more and more they were
surprised with the account he gave them of his er-
rand, and that there was a Christian in a place near,
much more one that was able, and had humanity
enough to contribute to their deliverance.
They described how they were astonished at the
fight of the relief I sent them, and at the. appear-
ance of loaves of bread, things they had not seen
since their coming to that miserable place; how often
they crossed it, and blessed it as bread sent from
Heaven; and what a reviving cordial it was to their
spirits to taste it; as also, of the other things I had
sent for their supply. And, after all, they would
have told me something of the joy they were in at
the sight of a boat and pilots to carry them away to
the person and place, from whence all these new
comforts came; but they told me, it was impossible
to
to express it by words; for their excessive joy driv-
ing them to unbecoming extravagancies, they had
no way to describe them, but by telling me, that
they bordered upon lunacy, having no way to give
vent to their passion, suitable to the sense that was
upon them; that in some it worked one way, and
in some another; and that some of them, through a
surprise of joy, would burst out into tears; others be
half mad, and others immediately saint. This dis-
course extremely affected me, and called to my mind
Friday's extacy, when he met his sather, and the
poor people's extacy, when I took them up at sea,
after their ship was on fire; the mate of the ship's
joy, when he found himself delivered in the place
where he expected to perish; and my own joy, when
after twenty-eight years captivity, I found a good
ship ready to carry me to my own country: All
these things made me more sensible of the relation
of these poor men, and more affected with it.
Having thus given a view of the state of things,
as I found them, I must relate the heads of what I
did for these people, and the condition in which I
left them. It was their opinion, and mine too, that
they would be troubled no more with the savages; or
that, if they were, they would be able to cut them
off, if they were twice as many as before; so that
they had no concern about that. Then I entered
into a serious discourse with the Spaniard, whom I
called governor, about their stay in the island; for
as I was not come to carry any of them off, so it
would not be just to carry off some, and leave others,
who perhaps would be unwilling to stay if their
strength was diministied.
Vol. II K On
On the other hand, I told them, I came to esta*
blissi them there, not to remove them; and .then
I let them know, that I had brought with me re-
lief of sundry kinds for them: That I had been
at a great charge to supply them with all things ne-
cessary, as well for their convenience, as their de-
fence; and that I had such particular persons with
me, as well to increase and recruit their number, as
by the particular necessary employments which they
were bred to, being artificers, to assist them in those
things, in which, at present, they were to seek.
They were all together when I talked thus to them;
and before I delivered to them the stores I had
brought, I asked them, one by one, if they had en-
tirely forgot and buried the first animosities that had
been among them, and could shake hands with one
another, and engage in a strict friendship, and union
of interest, so that there might be no more misun-
derstandings or jealousies.
William Atkins, with abundance of frankness and
good-humour, said, They had met with asflictions
enough to make them all sober, and enemies enough
to make them all friends: That, for his part, he
would live and die with them; and was so sar from
designing any thing against the Spaniards, that, he
owned, they had done nothing to him but what his
own bad humour made necessary, and what he would
have done, and, perhaps, much worse, in their case;
and that he would ask them pardon, if I defired it,
for the foolish and brutish things he had done to
them; and was very willing and defirous of living
on terms of entire friendship and union with them;
and would do any thing that lay in his power to con-
vince
vmce them of it: and as for going to England,
he'cared not if he did not go thither these twenty
years.
The Spaniards said, they had, indeed, at sirst,
disarmed and excluded William Atkins, and his two
countrymen, for their ill conduct, as they had let
me know: And they appealed to me, for the ne.
ceflity they were under to do so; but that William
A'tkins had behaved himself so bravely in the great
fight they had with the savages, ,and on several occa-
sions since, and had shewed himself so saithful to,
and concerned for the general interest of them all,
that they had forgotten all that was past, and thought
he merited as much to be trusted with arms, and
supplied with necessaries, as any of them; and that
they had testified their satissaction in him, by com-
mitting the command to him, next to the governor
himself; and as they had an entire considence in
him, and all his countrymen, so they acknowledged,
they had merited that considence, by all the methods
that honest men could merit to be valued and trusted:
and they most heartily embraced the occasion of
giving me this assurance, that they would never have
any interest separate from one another.
Upon these frank and open declarations of friend-
ship, we appointed the next day to dine all together;
and indeed, we made a splendid feast: I caused the
ship's cook and his mate to come on shore, and dress
our dinner; and the old cook's mate we had on
shore, assisted. We brought on shore six pieces of
good beef, and four pieces of pork, out of the
ship's provision, with our punch bowl, and mate-
K 2 rials
rials to fill it; and, in particular, I gave them ten
bottles of French claret, and ten bottles of English
beer; things that neither the Spaniards, or the
Englishmen, had tasted for many years; and which,
it may be supposed, they were exceeding glad
of.
The Spaniards added to our feast five whole kids,
which the cooks roasted; and three of them were
sent, covered up close, on board our ship to the sea-
men, that they might feast on fresh meat from on
shore, as we did with their salt meat from on
board.
After this feast, at which we were very innocently
merry, I brought out my cargo of goods, wherein,
that there might be no dispute about dividing, I
shewed them that there was sufficient for them all;
and defired, that they might all take an equal quan-
tity of the goods that were for wearing; that is to
say, equal when made up. As first, I distributed
linen sufficient to make every one of them four
shirts; and, at the Spaniard's request, afterwards
made them up six; these were exceeding comforta-
ble to them, having been what, as I may say, they
had long since forgot the use of, or what it was to
wear them.
I allotted the thin English stuffs, which I mentioned
before, to make every one a light coat, like a frock,
which I judged fittest for the heat of the season, cool
and loose; and ordered, that whenever they de-
cayed, they should make more, as they thought
fit: The like for pumps, shoes, stockings, and
hats, &c.
I cannot
I cannot express what pleasure, what satissaction,
sat upon the countenances of all these poor men,
when they saw the care I had taken of them, and
how well I had furnished them: they told me, I was
a sather to them; and that, having such a corres-
pondent as I was, in so remote a part of the world,
it would make them forget that they were lest in a
desolate place; and they all voluntarily engaged
to me, not to leave the place without my con-
sent.
Then I presented to them the people I had brought
with me; particularly the taylor, the smith, and the
two carpenters, all of them most; necessary people;
but above all, my general artificer, than whom they
could not name any thing that was more needful to
them; and the taylor, to shew his concern for them,
went to work immediately, and with my leave, made
them every one a shirt the first thing he did; and,
which was still more, he taught the women not only
how to sow and stitch, and use the needle, but made
them assist to make the shirts for their husoands, and
for all the rest-
As for the carpenters, I scarce need mention how
useful they were, for they took in pieces all my clum-
sy, unhandy things, and made them clever, conve-
nient tables, stools, bedsteads, cupboards, lockers,
shelves, and every thing they wanted of that kind.
But, to let them fee how nature made artificers at
first, I carried the carpenters to fee William Atkins's
basket-house, as I called it; and they both owned,
they never saw an instance of such natural ingenuity
before; nor any thing so regular, and so handily
K 3 built,
built, at least; of its kind: and one of them, when
he saw it, after musing a good while, turning about
to me, I am sure, says he, that man has no need of
us; you need do nothing but give him tools.
Then I brought them out all my store of tools,
and gave every man a digging spade, a shovel, and
a rake, for we had no harrows or ploughs; and, to
every separate place, a pick-axe, a crow, a broad-axe,
and a saw; always appointing, that as often as any
were broken, or worn out, they should be supplied,
without grudging, out of the general stores that I left
behind.
Nails, staples, hinges, hammers, chissels, knives,
scissars, and all forts of tools and iron-work, they
had without tale, as they required; for no man
would care to take more than they wanted; and he
must be a fool that would waste or spoil them, on any
account whatever: And for the use of the smith, I
left two tons of unwrought iron for a supply.
My magazine of powder and arms, which I brought
them, was such even to profusion, that they could
not but rejoice at them; for now they could march
as I used to do, with a musket upon each shoulder,
if there was occasion; and were able to fight iooo
savages, if they had but some little advantages of
situation; which also they could not miss of, if they
had occasion.
I carried on shore with me the young man whose
mother was starved to death, and the maid also; she
was a sober, well-educated, religious young woman,
and behaved so inoffensively, that every one gave her a
good word: She had, indeed, an unhappy life with
us, there being no woman in the ship but herself;
but
but she bore It with patience. After a while, seeing
things so well ordered, and in so sine a way of thriv-
ing upon my island, and considering that they had
neither business or acquaintance in the Eqsl Indies,
or reason for taking so long a voyage; I say, con-
sidering all this, both of them came to me, and de-
sired I would give them leave to remain on the
island, and be entered among my samily, as they
called it.
I agreed to it readily; and they had a little plot
of ground allotted to them, where they had three
tents or houses set up, surrounded with a basket-
work, palisaded like Atkins's, and adjoining to his
plantation; their tents were contrived so, that they
had each of them a room, a part to lodge in, and a
middle tent, like a great store-house, to lay all their
goods in, and to eat and drink in: And now the
other two Englishmen moved their habitation to the
same place; and so the island was divided into three
colonies, and no more; viz. The Spaniards, with
old Friday, and the first servants, at my old habita-
tion under the hill, which was, in a word, the ca-
pital city, and where they had so enlarged and ex-
tended their works, as well under as on the out-side
of the hill, that they lived, though perfectly conceal-
ed, yet full at large. Never was there such a little
city in a wood, and so hid, I believe, in any part of
the world: For, I verily believe, 1000 men might
have ranged the island a month, and, if they had
not known there was such a thing, and looked on
purpose for it, they would not have found it; for
the trees stood so thick, and so close, and grew so
sast matted into one another, that nothing but cutting
K 4 them
them down first, could discover the place, except
the two narrow entrances where' they went in and
out, could be found; which was not very easy:
One of them was just down at the water's-edge, on
the side of the creek; and it was afterwards above
200 yards to the place; and the other was up the
ladder at twice, as I have already formerly described
it; and they had a large wood, thick planted, also
on the top of the hill, which contained above an
acre, which grew apace, and covered the place from
all discovery there, with only one narrow place be-
tween two trees, not easy to be discovered, to enter
on that side.
The other colony was that of Will Atkins's, where
there were four samilies of Englishmen, I mean those
I had left there, with their wives and children; three
savages, that were slaves; the widow and children
of the Englishman that was killed; the young man
and the maid; and, by the way, we made a wife of
her also, before we went away: There were also the
two carpenters and the taylor, who I brought with
me for them; also the smith, who was a very ne-
cessary man to them, especially as the gunsmith, to
take care of their arms ; and my other man, whom
I called Jack of all trades; who was himself as good
almost as twenty men, for he was not only a very
ingenious fellow, but a very merry fellow; and,
before I went away, we married him to the honest
maid that came with the youth in the ship, whom \
mentioned before.
And now I speak of marrying, it brings me na-
turally to say something of the French ecclesiastic
that I had brought with me out of the stiip's crew,
whom.
*37
whom I took at sea. It is true, this man was a Ro.
wan, and perhaps, it may give offence to some here-
after, if I leave any thing extraordinary upon record,
of a man, whom, before I begin, I must (to set him
out in just colours) represent in terms very much to
his disadvantage, in the account of Protestants; as
first, that he was a Papist; secondly, a Popish priest;
and thirdly, a French Popish priest.
But justice demands of me to give him a due cha-
racter; and I must say, he was a grave, sober, pious,
and most religious person; exact in his life, extensive
in his charity, and exemplary in almost every thing
he did: What, then, can any one say against my
being very sensible of the value of such a man, not-
withstanding his profession? Though it may be my
opinion, perhaps, as well as the opinion of others,
who shall read this, that he was mistaken.
The first hour that I began to converse with him,
after he had agreed to go with me to the East In-
dies, I found reason to delight exceedingly in his
conversation: And he first began with me about re-
ligion, in the most obliging manner imaginable.
Sir, says he, you have not only, under God (and
at that he crossed his breast) saved my life, but you
have admitted'me to go this voyage in your ship,
and by your obliging civility, have taken me into
your samily, giving me an opportunity of free con-
versation: Now, Sir, says he, you fee by my habit,
what my profession is; and I guess by your nation,
what your's is: I may think it is my duty, and
doubtless it is so, to use my utmost endeavours, on
all occasions, to bring all the souls that I can to the
knowledge of the truth, and to embrace the Catholic
doctrine;
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
doctrine; but, as I am here under your permission,
and in your samily, I am bound in justice to your
kindness, as well as in decency and good manners,
to be under your government; and therefore I
shall not, without your leave, enter into any debates
on the points of religion, in which we may not
agree, sarther than you shall give me leave.
I told him, his carriage was so modest, that I could
not but acknowledge it; that it was true, we were
such people as they call heretics; but that he was
not the first Catholic that I had conversed with, with-
out salling into any inconveniencies, or carrying the
questions to any height in debate; that he should not
find himself the worse used for being of a different
opinion from us; and if we did not converse with-
out any dislike on either side, upon that score, it
would be his sault, not ours.
He replied, That he thought our conversation
might be easily separated from disputes; that it was.
not his business to cap principles with every man he
discoursed with; and that he rather defired me to
converse with him as a gentleman, than as a religieux;
that if I would give him leave, at any time, to dis-
course upon religious subjects, he would readily
comply with it; and that then he did not doubt but
I would allow him also to defend his own opinions,
as well as he could: but that, without my leave, he
would not break in upon me with any such thing.
He told me sarther, that he would not cease to do
all that became him in his office, as a priest, as well
as a private Christian, to procure the goods of the
ship, and the safety of all that was in her; and
though, perhaps, we would not join with him, and
he
he could not pray with us, he hoped he might pray
for us, which he would do upon all occasions. In
this manner we conversed; and, as he was of a most
obliging genileman-like behaviour, so he was, if I
may be allowed to say so, a man of good fense,
and, as I believe, of great learning.
He gave me a most diverting account of his life,
and of the many extraordinary events of it; of
many adventures which had besallen him in the few
years that he had been abroad in the world, and par-
ticularly this was very remarkable; viz. That during
the voyage he was now engaged in, he had the mis-
fortune to be five times stiipped and unshipped, and
never to go to the place whither any of the ships he
was in were at first designed: That his first intent
was, to have gone to Martinico; and that he went
on board a ship bound thither at St. Maloes; but
being forced into Lisbon in bad weather, the ship
received some damage, by running aground in the
mouth of the river Tagus, and was obliged. to un-
load her cargo there: That finding a Portuguese ship
there, bound to the Madeiras, and ready to sail, and
supposing he mould easily meet with a vessel there
bound to Martinico, he went on board, in order to
sail to the Madeiras; but the master of the Portu-
guese ship, being but an indifferent mariner, had
been out in his reckoning, and they drove to Fial;
where, however, he happened to find a very good
market for his cargo, which was corn; and there-
fore resolved not to go to the Madeiras, but to load
salt at the IJle of May, to go away to Newfoundland:
He had no remedy in the exigence, but to go with
the ship} and had a pretty good voyage as sar as the
Banks,
Banks, (so they call the place where they catch the
fish) where meeting with a French ship bound from
France to Quebec, in the river of Canada, and from
thence to Mariinico, to carry provisions, he thought
he should have an opportunity to complete his first
design: But when he came to .Quebec, the master of
the ship died, and the ship proceeded no sarther: So
the next voyage he shipped himself for France, in the
ship that was burnt, when we took them up at sea,
and then shipped them with us for the East Indies,
as I have already said. Thus he had been disap-
pointed in five voyages, all, as I may call it, in one
voyage, besides what I shall have occasion to men-
tion sarther of the same person.
But I shall not make digressions into other men's
stories, which have no relation to my own. I return
to what concerns our affair in the island: He came
to me one morning, for he lodged among us all the
while we were upon the island; and it happened to
be just when I was going to visit the Englishmen's co-
lony, at the sarthest part of the island; I say, he
came to me, and told me, with a very grave coun-
tenance, that he had, for two or three days, defired
an opportunity of some discourse with me, which,
he hoped, would not be displeasing to me, because
he thought it might, in some measure, correspond
with my general design, which was the prosperity
of my new colony; and, perhaps, might put it, at
least, more than he yet thought it was, in the way
of God's blessing.
I looked a little surprized at the last part of his
discourse; and turning a little short, How, Sir, said
I, can it be said, that we are not in the way of God's
blessing,
blessing, after such visible assistances, and wonderful
deliverances, as we have seen here, and of which I
have given you a large account?
If you had pleased, Sir, said he, (with a world
of modesty, and yet with great readiness) to have
heard me, you would have found no room to have
been displeased, much less to think so hard of me
that I should suggest, that you have not had won-
derful assistances and deliverances: And, I hope, on
your behalf, that you are in the way of God's
blessing, and your design is exceeding good, and will
prosper. But, Sir, said he, though it were more so,
than is even possible to you, yet there may be some
among you that are not equally right in their actions:
And you know, that in the story of Israels one
Achan, in the camp, removed God's blessing from
them, and turned his hand so against them, that
thirty-six of them, though not concerned in the
crime, were the objects of divine vengeance, and
bore the weight of that punishment.
I was sensibly touched with this discourse; and
told him his inference was so just, and the whole
design seemed so sincere, and was really so religious
in its own nature, that I was very sorry I had inter-
rupted him; and begged him to go on: And, in the
mean time, because it seemed, that what we had both
to say, might take up some time, I told him I was
going to the Englishman % plantation, and aflced him
to go with me, and we might discourse of it by the
way: He told me, he would more willingly wait on
me thither, because there, partly, the thing was
acted, which he defired to speak to me about: So
we
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
we walked on, and I pressed him to be free and
plain with me, in what he had to say.
Why then, Sir, says he, be pleased to give me
leave to lay down a few propositions, as the founda-
tion of what I have to say, that we may not differ in
the general principles, though we may be of some
differing opinions in the practice of particulars. First,
Sir, though we differ in some of the doctrinal articles
of religion, and it is very unhappy that it is so, es-
pecially in the case before us, as I shall shew after-
wards; yet, there are some general principles in
which we both agree; viz. First, that there is a
God; and that this God, having given us some stated
general rules for our service and obedience, we ought
not willingly and knowingly to offend him, either
by neglecting to do what he has commanded, or by
doing what he has expressly forbidden; and let our
different religions be what they will, this general
principle is readily owned by us all: That the bles-
sing of God does not ordinarily follow a presumptu-
ous sinning against his command; and every good
Christan will be affectionately concerned to prevent
any that are under his care, living in a total neglect
of God and his commands. It is not your men be-
ing Protestants, whatever my opinion may be of
such, that discharges me from being concerned for
their souls, and from endeavouring, if it lies before
me, that they should live in as little distance from,
and enmity with their Maker as possible; especially
if you give me leave to meddle so sar in your cir-
, cuit.
I could
I could not yet imagine what he aimed at, and told
him I granted all he had said; and thanked him,
that he would so sar concern himself for us; and
begged he would explain the particulars of what he
had observed, that, like Joshua, (to take his own
parable) I might put away the accursed thing from
us.
Why then, Sir, says he, I will take the liberty
you give me; and there are three things, which, if
I am right, must stand in the way of God's blessing
upon your endeavours here, and which I should re-
joice, for your sake, and their own, to fee removed.
And, Sir, says he, I promise myself that you will
fully agree with me in them all, as soon as I name
them; especially, because I shall convince you, that
every one of them may, with great ease, and very-
much to your satissaction, be remedied.
He gave me no leave to put in any more civilities,
but went on. First, Sir, says he, you have here four
Engliflmen, who have fetched women from among
the savages, and have taken them as their wives, and
have had many children by them all, and yet are not
married to them after any stated legal manner, as
the laws of God and man require; and therefore
are yet, in the fense of both, no less than adulterers,
and living in adultery. To this, Sir, says he, I
know you will object, that there was no clergyman,
or priest of any kind, or of any profession, to per-
form the ceremony; nor any pen and ink, or paper,
to write down a contract of marriage, and have it
signed between them. And I know also, Sir, what
the Spaniard governor has told you; I mean, of the
agreement
tIFE AMD ADVENTURES
agreement that he obliged them to make when they
took these women, viz. That they should chuse them
out by consent, and keep separately to them;
which, by the way, is nothing of a marriage, no
agreement with the women as wives, but only an
agreement among themselves, to keep them from
quarrelling.
But, Sir, the essence of the sacrament of matri-
mony (so he called it, being a Roman) consists not
only in the mutual consent of the parties to take one
another as man and wife, but in the formal and legal
obligation that there is in the contract, to compel the1
man and woman, at all times, to own and acknow-
ledge each other; obliging the man to abstain from
all other women, to engage in no other contract
while these subsist; and on all occasions, as ability
allows, to provide honestly for them, and their chil-
dren; and to oblige the women to the same, or like
conditions, mutatis mutandis, on their side.
Now, Sir, says he, these men may, when they
please, or when occasion presents, abandon these
women, disown their children, leave them to perish,
and take other women, and marry them whilst these
are living. And here he added, with some warmth,
How, Sir, is God honoured in this unlawful liberty?
And how shall a blessing succeed your endeavours in
this place, however good in themselves, and however
sincere in your design, while these men, who at pre-
sent are your subjects, under your absolute govern-
ment and dominion, are allowed by you to live in
open adultery?
I confess, I was struck at the thing itself, but
much more with the convincing arguments he sup-
ported
ported it with: for it was certainly true, that though
they had no clergyman on the spot, yet a formal con-
tract on both sides, made before witnesses, and con-
firmed by any token, which they had all agreed to
be bound by, though it had been but the breaking a
stick between them, engaging the men to own these
Women for their wives upon all occasions, and never
to abandon them or their children, and the women
to the same with their husbands, had been an effec-
tual lawful marriage in the fight of God; and it
was a great negtect that jf was not done.
But I thought to have gotten off With my young
priest, by telling him, that all that part was done
when I was not here; and they had lived so many
years with them now, that if it was adultery, it was
past remedy; they could do nothing in it now.
Sir, says he, asking your pardon for such freedom,
you are right in this; that it being done in your ab-
sence, you could not be charged with that part of the
crime. But I beseech you, flatter not yourself, that
you are not therefore under an obligation to do your
uttermost now to put an end to it: How can you
think, but that, let the time Dast lie on whom it will,
all the guilt, for the future, will lie entirely upon
you? Because it is certainly in your power now to
put an end to it; and in nobody's power but your's.
I was so dull still, that I did not take him right;
but I imagined, that, by putting an end to it, he
meant, that I should part them, and not suffer them
to live together any longer; and I said to him, I
could not do that by any means, for that it would
put the whole island in confusion. He seemed sur-
Vol. II. L prised
prised that I should so sar mistake him. No, Sir,
says he, I do not mean that you mould separate them,
but legally and effectually marry them now: And,
Sir, as my way of marrying may not be so easy to
reconcile them to, though it will be as effectual, even
by your own laws; so your way may be as well be-
fore God, and as valid among men 5 I mean, by a
written contract, signed by both man and woman,
and by all the witnesses present; which all the laws
of Europe would decree to be valid.
I was amazed to fee so^much true piety, and so
much sincerity of zeal, besides the unusual impar-
tiality in his discourse, as to his own party or church,
and such a true warmth for the preserving people
that he had no knowledge of, or relation to; I say,
for preserving them from transgressing the laws of
God; the like of which, I had, indeed, not met
with any where. But recollecting what he had said
of marrying them by a written contract, which I
knew would stand too, I returned it back upon him,
and told him, I granted all that he had said to be
just, and, on his part, very kind; that I would dis-
course with the men upon the point now, when I
came to them. And I knew no reason why they
should scruple to let him marry them all; which I
knew well enough would be granted to be as authentic
and valid in England, as if they were married by one
of our own clergymen. What was afterwards done
in this matter, I shall speak of by itself.
I then pressed him to tell me, what was the second
complaint which he had to make; acknowledging,
that I was very much his debtor for the first; and
.1 thanked
thanked him heartily for it. He told me he would
use the same freedom and plainness in the second;
and hoped I would take it as well: and this was,
that notwithstanding these English subjects of mine,
as he called them, had lived with these women for
almost seven years, and had taught them to speak
English, and even to read it; and that they were,
as he perceived, women of tolerable understanding,
and capable of instruction; yet they had not to this
hour taught them any thing of the Christian religion;
no, not so much as to know that there was a God,
or a worship, or in what manner God was to be
served; or that their own idolatry, and worshipping
they knew not who, was salse and absurd.
This, he said, was an unaccountable neglect, and
what God would certainly call them to an account
for; and, perhaps, at last take the work out of their
hands. He spoke this very affectionately and warm-
ly. I am persuaded, says he, had those men lived
in the savage country, whence their wives came, tha
savages would have taken more pains to have brought
them to be idolators, and to worship the devil, than
any of these men, so sar as I can fee, has taken with
them, to teach them the knowledge of the true God.
Now, Sir, said he, though I do not acknowledge
your religion, or you mine, yet we should be all glad
to see the devil's servants, and the subjects of his
kingdom, taught to know the general principles of
the Christian religion; that they might at least: hear
of God, and of a Redeemer, and of the resurrec-
tion, and of a future state, things which we all be-
lieve , they hud at least been so much nearer coming
. L 3 into
into the bosom of the true church, than they are
now, in the public profession of idolatry, and devil-
worship.
I could hold no longer; I took him in my arms,
and embraced him with an excess of passion: How
far, said I to him, have I been from understanding
the most essential part of a Christian, viz. to love
the interest of the Christian church, and the good of
other men's fouls! I scarce have known what belongs
to being a Christian. O, Sir, do not say so, replied
he; this thing is not your sault. No, said I, but
why did I never lay it to heart as well as you? It is
not too late yet, said he; be not too forward to con-
demn yourself. But what can be done now? said I;
you see I am going away. Will you give me leave,
said he, to talk with these poor men about it? Yes,
with all my heart, said I; and I will oblige them to
give heed to what you say too. As to that, said he, we
must leave them to the mercy of Christ; but it is
our business to assist them, encourage them, and in-
struct them; and, if you will give me leave, and
God his blessing, I do not doubt but the poor ig-
norant souls shall be brought home into the great
circle of Christianity, if not into the particular faith
that we all embrace; and that even while you stay
here. Upon this I said, I shall not only give you
leave, but give you a thousand thanks for it. What
followed on this account I shall mention also again
in its place.
I now pressed him for the third article in which we
were to blame: Why really, says he, it is of the
same nature, and I will proceed (asking your leave)
4 with
149
•with the same plainness as before: It is about your poor
savages yonder, who are (as I may say) your conquered
subjects. It is a maxim, Sir, that is, or ought to be re-
ceived among all Christians, of what church, or pre-
tended church soever, viz. that Christian knowledge
ought to be propagated by all possible means, and on
all possible occasions. It is on this principle that our
church fends missionaries into Persia, India, and China;
and that our clergy, even of the superior sort, wil-
lingly engage in the most hazardous voyages, and
the most dangerous residence, among murderers and
barbarians, to teach them the knowledge of the true
God, and to bring them over to embrace the Chris-
tian saith. Now, Sir, you have an opportunity here,
to have six or seven-and-thirty poor savages brought
over from idolatry to the knowledge of God, their
Maker and Redeemer, that I wonder how you
can pass by such an occasion of doing good; which
is really worth the expence of a man's whole life.
I was now struck dumb indeed, and had not one
word to say: I had here a spirit of true Christian
zeal for God and religion before me, let his parti- ,
cular principles be of what kind soever: As for me,
I had not so much as entertained a thought of this in
my heart before; and, I believe, should not have
thought of it; for I looked upon these savages as
slaves, and people, whom, 'had we any work for
them to do, we would have used as such, or would
have been glad to have transported them to any other
part of the world; for our business was to get rid
of them; and we would all have been satisfied, if
they had been sent to any country, so they had ne-
ver seen their own. But, to the case: I say, I was
L 3 confounded
confounded at his discourse, and knew not what an
swer to make him. He looked earnestly at me, seeing
me in some disorder: Sir, said he, I shall be very
sorry, if what I have said gives you any osfence.
No, no, said I, I am osfended with nobody but my-
self; but I am perfectly confounded, not only to
think that I should never take any notice of this be-,
fore, but with reflecting what notice I am able to
take of it now. You know, Sir, said I, what cir-
cumstances I am in; I am bound to the East Indies,
in a ship freighted by merchants, and to whom it
would be an insufferable piece of injustice to detain
their ship here, the men lying all this while at vic-
tuals and wages upon the owner's account: it is
true, I agreed to be allowed twelve days here; and
if I stay more, I must pay 3I. sterling per diem de-
murrage; nor can I stay upon demurrage above
eight days more; and I have been here thirteen
days already: So that I am perfectly unable to engage
in this work, unless I would suffer myself to be left
behind here again; in which case, if this single ship
should miscarry in any part of her voyage, I should
be just in the same condition that I was left in here
at sirst; and from which I have been so wonderfully
delivered.
He owned the case was very hard upon me as to
my voyage •, but laid it home upon my conscience,
whether the blessing of saving seven-and-thirty souls,
was not worth my venturing all I had in the world
for? I was not so sensible of that as he was: and I
returned upon him thus: Why, Sir, it is a valuable
thing indeed, to be an instrument in God's hand, to
"convert
convert seven-and-thirty heathens to the knowledge of
Christ; but as you are an ecclesiastic, and are given
over to that work, so that it seems naturally to sall
into the way of your profession, how is it then, that
you do not rather osfer yourself to undertake it, than
press me to it?
Upon this he saced about, just before me, as he
walked along, and, putting me to a full stop, made
me a very low bow: I most heartily thank God, and
you, Sir, says he, for giving me so evident a call to
so blessed a work; and if you think yourself dis-
charged from it, and defire me to undertake it, I
will most readily do it, and think it a happy reward
for all the hazards and difficulties of such a
broken, disappointed voyage as I have met with,
that I have dropped at last into so glorious a
work.
I discovered a kind of rapture in his sace, while
he spoke this to me; his eyes sparkled like fire, his
sace glowed, and his colour came and went, as if he
had been salling into fits: in a word, he was fired
with the joy of being embarked in such a work. I
paused a considerable while before I could tell what
to. say to him; for I was really surprised to find a
man of such sincerity and zeal, and carried out in
his zeal beyond the ordinary rate of men, not of his
profession only, but even of any profession whatso-
ever: but, after I had considered it a while, I asked
him seriously, if he was in earnest, and that he would
venture on the single consideration of an attempt on
those poor people, to be locked up in an unplanted island
for, perhaps, his life; and at last, might not know
X. 4 whether
whether he should be able to do them any good or
.not?
He turned short upon me, and asked me, what I
called a venture? Pray, Sir, said he, what do you
think I consented to go in your ship to the East In-
dies for? Nay, said I, that I know not, unless it was
to preach to the Indians. Doubtless it was, said he;
and do you think, if I can convert these seven-and-
thirty men to the saith of Christ, it is not worth
my time, though I should never be fetched off the
island again? Nay, is it not infinitely of more worth
to save so many souls, than my life is, or the life of
twenty more of the same profession? Yes, Sir, says
he, I would give Christ and the Blessed Virgin thanks
all my days, if I could be made the least happy in-
strument of saving the souls of these poor men,
though I was never to set my foot off this island, or
see my native country any more: But since you will
honour me, says he, with putting me into this work,
(for which I will pray for you all the days of my life)
I have one humble petition to you, said he, besides-
"What is that? said I. "Why, says he, it is, that
you will leave your man Friday with me, to be my
interpreter to them, and to assist me; for, without
, some help, I cannot speak to them, or they to me.
I was sensibly troubled at his requesting Friday,
because I could not think of parting with him, and
that for many reasons: He had been the companion
of my travels; he was not only saithful to me, but
sincerely affectionate to the last degree; and I had
resolved to do something considerable for him, if he
out-lived me, as- it was probable he would: then I
knew, that as I had bred Friday up to be a Protestant,
v
it
it would quite confound him, to bring him to em-
brace another profefiion; and he would never, while
his eyes were open, believe that his old master was
an heretic, and would be damned; and this might
in the end ruin the poor fellow's principles, and so
turn him back again to his first idolatry.
However, a sudden thought relieved me in this
strait, and it was this: I told him, I could not say
that I was willing to part with Friday on any account
whatever; though a work, that to him was of more
value than his life, ought to me to be of much more
value than the keeping or parting with a servant.
But, on the other hand, I was persuaded, that
Friday would by no means consent to part with me;
and then to force him to it, without his consent,
would be manifest injustice; because I had promised
I would never put him away; and he had promised
and engaged to me that he would never leave me,
unless I put him away.
He seemed very much concerned at it; for he had
no rational access to these poor people, seeing he did
not understand one word of their language, nor
they one word of his. To remove this difficulty, I
told him, Friday's sather had learned Spanish, which
I found he also understood; and he should serve him
for an interpreter: so he was much better satisfied,
and nothing could persuade him but he would stay
to endeavour to convert them; but Providence gave
another and very happy turn to all this.
I come back now to the first part of his objections.
When we came to the Englishmen, I sent for them
all together; and after some accounts given them of
what
what I had done for them, 'viz. what necessary thing*
I had provided for them, and how they were distri-
buted, which they were sensible of, and very thank-
ful for; I began to talk to them of the scandalous life
they led, and gave them a full account of the notice
the clergyman had already taken of it; and, ar-
guing how unchristian and irreligious a life it was, I
first asked them, if they were married men or bache-
lors? They soon explained their condition to me,
and shewed me that two of them were widowers, and
the other three were single men or bachelors: I asked
them, with what conscience they could take these
women, and lie with them, as they had done, call
them their wives, and have so many children by them,
and not be married lawfully to them?
They all gave me the answer that I expected, viz.
that there was nobody to marry them; that they
agreed before the governor to keep them as their
wives; and to keep them, and own them, as their
wives; and they thought, as things stood with them,
they were as legally married as if they had been
married by a parson, and with all the formalities in
the world.
I told them, that no doubt they were married in
the sight of God, and were bound in conscience to
keep them as their wives; but that the laws of men
being otherwise, they might pretend they were not
married, and so desert the poor women and children
hereafter; and that their wives, being poor desolate
women, friendless and moneyless, would have no way
to help themselves: I therefore told them, that unless
I was assured of their honest intent, I could do no-
thing
thing for them; but would take care, that what I
did should be for the women and children, without
them; and that unless they would give some assur-
ances that they would marry the women, I could
not think it was convenient they should continue to-
gether as man and wife; for that it was both scan-
dalous to men, and offensive to God, who they could
not think would bless them, if they wenc on thus.
All this passed as I expected; and they told me,
especially Will Atkins, who seemed now to speak for
the rest, that they loved their wives as well as if they
had been born in their own native country, and
would not leave them upon any account whatever;
and they did verily believe their wives were as vir-
tuous and as modest, and did, to the utmost of their
skill, as much for them, and for their children, as
any women could possibly do; and they would not
part with them on any account: And Will Atkinsx
for his own particular, added, if any man would
take him away, and offer to carry him home to
England, and to make him captain of the best man
of war in the navy, he would not go with him, if
he might not carry his wife and children with him;
and if there was a clergyman in the ship, he would
be married to her now, with all his heart.
This wras just as I would have it; the priest was
not with me at that moment, but was not sar off:
So, to try him sarther, I told him I had a clergyman
with me, and, if he was sincere, I would have him
married the next morning; and bade him consider
of it, and talk with the rest: He said, as for him-
self,
self, he need not consider of it at all; for he was very
ready to do it, and was glad I had a minister with
me; and he believed they would be all willing also.
I then told him, that my friend, the minister, was
a Frenchman, and could not speak English; but that
I would act the clerk between them. He never so
much as asked me whether he was a Papist or Pro-
testant; which was indeed what I was afraid of.
But, I say, they never enquired about it. So we
parted: I went back to my clergyman; and Will
Atkins went in to talk with his companions. I de-
sired the French gentleman not to say any thing to
them, till the business was thorough ripe; and I
told him what answer the men had given me.
Before I went from their quarter, they all came
to me, and told me, they had been considering what
I had said; that they were very glad to hear I had
a clergyman in my company; and they were very
willing to give me the satissaction I desired, and to
be formally married as soon as I pleased; for they
were sar from defiring to part from their wives; and
that they meant nothing but what was very honest,
when they chose them: so I appointed them to meet
me the next morning; and that, in the mean time,
they mould let their wives know the meaning of the
marriage law; and that it was not only to prevent
any scandal, but also to oblige them, that they
should not forsake them, whatever might happen.
The women were easily made sensible of the mean-
ing of the thing, and were very well satisfied with
it, as, indeed, they had reason to be; so they sailed
not to attend all together, at my apartment, the
next
*57
next morning, where I brought out my clergyman:
and though he had not on a minister's gown, after
the manner of England, or the habit of a priest,
after the manner of France; yet having a black
vest, something like a cassock, with a sash round it,
he did not look very unlike a minister; and as for
his language, I was interpreter.
But the seriousness of his behaviour to them, and
the scruples he made of marrying the women, be-
cause they were not baptized, and professed Chris-
tians, gave them an exceeding reverence for his
person; and there was no need after that to enquire
whether he was a clergyman or no.
Indeed I was afraid his scruple would have been
carried so sar, as that he would not have married
them at all: nay, notwithstanding all I was able to
say to him, he resisted me, though modestly, yet
very steadily; and at last, refused absolutely to
marry them, unless he had first talked with the men,
and the women too; and though at first I was a little
backward to it, yet at last I agreed to it with a
good will, perceiving the sincerity of his design.
When he came to them, he let them know that
I had acquainted him with their circumstances, and
with the present design; that he was very willing to
perform that part of his function, and marry them,
as I had defired; but that, before he could do it, he
must take the liberty to talk with them; he told
them, that in the sight of all different men, and in
the fense of the laws of society, they had lived all
this while in an open adultery; and that it was true,
that nothing but the consenting to marry, or effec-
tually
tually separating them from one another now, could
put an end to it; but there was a difficulty in it too,
with respect to the laws of Christian matrimony,
which he was, not fully satisfied about, viz. That of
marrying one that is a professed Christian, to a sa-
vage, an idolater and an heathen, one that is not
baptized; and yet that he did not fee, that there
was time left for it, to endeavour to persuade the
women to be baptized, or to profess the name of
Christ, whom they had, he doubted, heard no-
thing of, and without which they could not be
baptized.
He told me, he doubted they were but indifferent
Christians themselves; that they had but little know-
ledge of God, or his ways; and therefore he could
not expect, that they had said much to their wives on
that head yet; but that unless they would pro-
mise him to use their endeavours with their wives,
to persuade them to become Christians, and would
as well as they could instruct them in the knowledge
and belief of God that made them, and to worship
Jesus Christ that redeemed them, he could not marry
them; for he would have no hand in joining Chris-
tians with savages; nor was it consistent with the
principles of the Christian religion; and was, indeed,
expressly forbidden in God's law.
They heard all this very attentively, and I deli-
vered it very saithfully to them, from his mouth, as
near his own words as I could, only sometimes adding
something of my own, to convince them how just it
was, and how I was of his mind: And I always very
saithfully distinguished between what I said from
myself,
myself, and what were the clergyman's words. They
told me, it was very true what the gentleman had
said, that they were but very indisferent Christians
themselves, and that they had never talked to their
wives about religion: Lord, Sir, says Will Atkins,
how should we teach them religion? Why, we know
nothing ourselves; and besides, Sir, said he, should
we go to talk to them of God, and Jesus Christ, and
heaven and hell, it would be to make them laugh at
us, and ask us, what we believe ourselves? And if
we should tell them, we believe all the things that
we speak of to them, such as of good people going
to heaven, and wicked people to the devil, they
would ask us, where we intended to go ourselves,
who believe all this, and yet are such wicked fel-
lows, as we indeed are: Why, Sir, said Will, 'tis
enough to give them a surfeit of religion, at first
hearing: folks must have some religion themselves,
before they pretend to teach other people.—Will
Atkins, said I to him, though I am afraid what you
say has too much truth in it, yet can you not tell
your wife, that she is in the wrong? that there is a
God, and a religion better than her own; that her
gods are idols; that they can neither hear nor speak;
that there is a great Being that made all things, and
that can destroy all that he has made; that he re-
wards the good, and punishes the bad; that we are
to be judged by him, at last, for all we do here: you
are not so ignorant, but even nature itself will teach
you, that all this is true; and I am satisfied you know
it all to be true, and believe it yourself.
That's
That's true, Sir, said Atkins; but with what face
can I say any thing to my wife of all this, when she
will tell me immediately, it cannot be true?
Not true! said I,—what do you mean by that?
Why, Sir, said he, she will tell me it cannot be true,
that this God (I shall tell her of) can be just, or can
punish or reward, since I am not punished, and sent
to the devil, that have been such a wicked crea-
ture as she knows I have been, even to her, and to
every body else; and that I should be suffered to
live, that have been always acting so contrary to what
I must tell her is good, and to what I ought to
have done.
Why truly, Atkins, said I, I am afraid thou speakest
too much truth: and with that I let the clergyman
know what Atkins had said; for he was impatient to
know: O! said the priest, tell him there is one
thing will make him the best minister in the world
to his wife, and that is repentance; for none teach
repentance like true penitents: He wants nothing
but to repent, and then he will be so much the bet-
ter qualified to instruct his wife; he will then be
able to tell her, that there is not only a God, and
that he is the just rewarder of good and evil; but
that he is a merciful Being, and, with infinite good-
ness and long suffering, forbears to punish those that
offend; waiting to be gracious, and willing not the
death of a sinner, but rather that he should return
and live; that he often suffers wicked men to go on
a long time, and even reserves damnation to the ge-
neral day of retribution: that it is a clear evidence
of God, and of a future state, that righteous men
receive
receive not their reward, or wicked men their pu-
nishment, till they come into another world; and
this will lead him to teach his wife the doctrine of
the resurrection, and of the last judgment: let him
but repent for himself, he will be an excellent preacher
of repentance to his wife.
I repeated all this to Atkins, who looked very se-
rious all the while, and who, we could easily per-
ceive, was more than ordinarily affected with it:
* when being eager, and hardly suffering me to make
an end—I knew, all this, master, says he, and a
great deal more; but I han't the impudence to talk
thus to my wife: when God, and my own con-
science knows, and my wife will be an undeniable
evidence against me, that I have lived as if I had
never heard of God, or a future state, or any thing
about it; and to talk of my repenting, alas! (and
with that he fetched a deep sigh; and I could see
that tears stood in his eyes) 'tis past all that with me.
Past it! Atkins, said I: What dost thou mean by
that? I knQw well enough what I mean, Sir, says
he; I mean 'tis too late; and that is too true.
I told my clergyman word for word what he said:
the poor zealous priest (I must call him so; for be
his opinion what it will, he had certainly a most
singular affection for the good of other men's fouls;
and it would be hard to think he had not the like for
his own; I say, this zealous, affectionate man) could
not refrain tears also: But recovering himself, he
said to me, Aik him but one question: Is he easy
that it is too late, or is he troubled, and wishes it
were not so? I put the question sairly to Atkins;
Vol. II. M and.
and he answered with a great deal of passion, How
could any man be easy in a condition that certainly
must end in eternal destruction? That he was sar
from being easy; but that, on the contrary, he be-
lieved it would one time or the other ruin him.
What do you mean by that? said I. Why, he
said, he believed he should, one time or another,
cut his own throat, to put an end to the terror
of it.
The clergyman shook his head, with a great con-
cern in his sace, when I told him all this; but,
turning quick to me upon it, said, If that be his
case, you may assure him it is not too late; Christ
will give him repentance: But pray, says he, ex-
plain this to him, That as no man is saved but by
Christ, and the merit of his passion, procuring di-
vine mercy for him, how can it be too late for any
man to receive mercy? Does he think he is able to
sin beyond the power or reach of divine mercy? Pray
tell him, There may be a time when provoked mercy
will no longer strive, and when God may refuse to
hear; but that 'tis never too late for men to ask
mercy; and we that are Christ's servants are com-
manded to preach mercy at all times, in the name of
Jesus Christ, to all those that sincerely repent: so
that 'tis never too late to repent.
I told Atkins all this, and he heard me with great
earnestness; but it seemed as if he turned off the
discourse to the rest; for he said to me, he would
go and have some talk with his wife: so he went out
awhile, and we talked to the rest. I perceived they
were all stupidly ignorant, as to matters of religion;
much
much as I was when I went rambling away from
my sather: and yet that there were none of them
backward to hear what had been said; and all of
them seriously promised, that they would talk with
their wives about it, and do their endeavour to
persuade them to turn Christians.
The clergyman smiled upon me, when I reported
what answer they gave, but said nothing a good while;
but, at last, making his head, We that are Christ's
servants, says he, can go no sarther than to exhort
and instruct:; and when men comply, submit to the
reproof, and promise what we ask, 'tis all we can do;
we are bound to accept their good words; but, be-
lieve me, Sir, said he, whatever you may have known
of the life of that man you call William Atkins, I
believe he is the only sincere convert among them; I
take that man to be a true penitent; I won't despair
of the rest; but that man is perfectly struck with
the fense of his past life; and I doubt not, but when
he comes to talk of religion to his wife, he will
talk himself effectually into it; for attempting to
teach others is sometimes the' best way of teaching
ourselves. I knew a man, added he, who, having
nothing but a summary notion of religion himself,
and being wicked and profligate, to the last degree,
in his life, made a thorough reformation in himself,
by labouring to convert a Jew: And if that poor At-
kins begins but once to talk seriously of Jesus Christ
to his wife, my life for it, he talks himself into a
thorough convert, makes himself a penitent: and
who knows what may follow?
Upon this discourse, however, and their promising,
as above, to endeavour to persuade their wives to
M 2 embrace
embrace Christianity, he married the other thretf
couple; but Will Atkins and his wife were not yet
come in. After this, my clergyman, waiting a while,
was curious to know where Atkins was gone; and,
turning to me, says he, I intreat you, Sir, let us
walk out of your labyrinth here, and look; I dare
say we shall find this poor man somewhere or other,
talking seriously with his wife, and teaching her al-
ready something of religion. I began to be of the
same mind; so we went out together; and I carried
him a way which none knew but myself, and where
the trees were so thick set, as that it was not easy to
see through the thicket of leaves, and sar harder to
fee in, than to fee out; when coming to the edge of
the wood, I saw Atkins, and his tawny savage wise,
sitting under the shade of a bush, very eager in dis-
course: I stoppped short, till my clergyman came up
to me; and then, having shewed him where they
were, we stood and looked very steadily at them a
good while.
We observed him very earnest with her, pointing
up to the sun, and to every quarter of the heavens;
then down to the earth, then out to the sea, then to
himself, then to her, to the woods, to the trees.
Now, says my clergyman, you fee my words are
made good; the man preaches to her; mark him;
now he is telling her that our God has made him,
and her, and the heavens, the earth, the sea, the
woods, the trees, &c. I believe he is, said I. Im-
mediately we perceived Will Atkins start up upon his
feet, sall down upon his knees,and liftupbothhishands;
we supposed he said something, but we could not
hear him: it was too far osf for that: he did not
continue
»<>5
continue kneeling half a minute, but comes and sits
down again by his wife, and talks to her again. We
perceived then the woman very attentive; but whe-
ther she said any thing or no, we could not tell.
While the poor fellow was upon his knees, I could
fee the tears run plentifully down my clergyman's
cheeks; and I could hardly forbear myself; but it
was a great affliction to us both, that we were not
near enough to hear any thing that passed between
them.
Well, however, we could come no nearer, for
fear of disturbing them: so we resolved to see an end
of this piece of still conversation; and it spoke loud
enough to us, without the help of voice. He sat
down again, as I have said, close by her, and talked
again earnestly to her; and two or three times we
could fee him embrace her passionately; another time
we saw him take out his handkerchief, and wipe her
eyes, and then kiss her again, with a kind of trans-
port very unusual; and after several of these things,
we saw him on a sudden jump up again, and lend
her his hand to help her up; when immediately lead-
ing her by the hand a step or two, they both kneeled
down together, and continued so about two mi-
nutes.
My friend could bear it no longer, but cries out
aloud, St. Paul, St. Paul! behold he prayeth !—
I was afraid Atkins would hear him; therefore I in-
treated him to withhold himself awhile, that we
might see an end of the scene, which to me, I must
confess, was the most affecting, and yet the most
agreeable, that ever 1 saw in my life. Well, he
strove with himself, and contained himself for a
. M 3 - while,
while, but was in such raptures of joy to think that
the poor heathen woman was become a Christian,
that he was not able to contain himself; he wept
several times: then throwing up his hands, and
crossing his breast, said over several things ejacula-
tory, and by way of giving God thanks for so mi-
raculous a testimony of the success of our endea-
vours: some he spoke softly, and I could not well
hear; others audibly; some in Latin, some in French;
then two or three times the tears of joy would inter-
rupt him, that he could not speak at all. But I
begged that he would compose himself, and let us
more narrowly and fully observe what was before us,
which he did for a time, and the scene was not end-
ed there yet; for, after the poor man and his wife
were risen again from their knees, we observed he
stood talking still eagerly to her; and we observed
by her motion that she was greatly affected with what
he said, by her frequent lifting up her hands, laying
her hand to her breast, and such other postures, as
usually express the greatest seriousness and attention:
This continued about half a quarter of an hour, and
then they walked away too; so that we could fee
no more of them in that situation.
I took this interval to talk with my clergyman:
and first, I told him, I was glad to fee the particu-
lars we had both been witnesses to; that though I
was hard enough of belief in such cases, yet that I
began to think it was all very sincere here, both in
the man and his wife, however ignorant they both
might be; and I hoped such a beginning would have
yet a more happy end: and who knows, said I,
but these two may in time, by instruction and ex-
2 ample,
167
ample, work upon some of the others? Some of
them! said he, turning quick upon me, ay, upon
all of them: depend upon it, if those two savages
(for he has been but little better, as you relate it)
should embrace Jesus Christ, they wijl never leave
till they work upon all the rest; for true religion is
naturally communicative; and he that is once made
a Christian will never leave a pagan behind him, if
he can help it. I owned it was a most Christian
principle to think so, and a testimony of a true zeal,
as well as a generous heart in him. But, my friend,
said I, will you give me liberty to start one difficulty
here? I cannot tell how to object the least thing
against that affectionate concern which you shew for
the turning the poor people from their paganism to
the Christian religion; but how does this comfort
you, while these people are, in your account, out
of the pale of the Catholic church, without which,
you believe, there is no salvation; so that you esteem
these but heretics still; and, for other reasons, as ef-
fectually lost as the pagans themselves?
To this he answered with abundance of candour
and Christian charity, thus: Sir, I am a Catholic of
the Roman church, and a priest of the order of St.
Benedift, and I embrace all the principles of the Ro-
man saith: But yet, if you will believe me, and this
I do not speak in compliment to you, or in respect
to my circumstances, and your civilities; I say, ne-
vertheless, I do not look upon you, who call yourselves
reformed, without some charity: I dare not say,
tho' I know it is our opinion in genei al; yet I dare
not say, that you cannot be saved ; I will by no means
limit the mercy of Christ, so sar as to think that he
M 4 cannot
cannot receive you into the bosom of his church, in
a manner, to us, imperceivable, and which, it is
impossible tor us to know; and I hope you have the
same charity for us: I pray daily for your being all
restored to Christ's church, by whatsoever methods
he, who is all wife, is pleased to direct. In the
mean time, sure, you will allow it to consist with
me, as a Roman, to distinguish sar between a Pro.
testant and a Pagan: between him that calls on Jesus
Christ, though in a way which I do not think is ac-
cording to the true saith; and a savage, a barbarian,
that knows no God, no Christ, no Redeemer at all:
And if you are not within the pale of the Catholic
church, we hope you are nearer being restored to
it, than those that know nothing at all of God, or
his church. I rejoice, therefore, when I fee this poor
man, who, you say, has been a profligate, and al-
most a murderer, kneel down and pray to Jesus
Christ, as we suppose he did, though not fully en-
lightened; believing that God, from whom every
such work proceeds, will sensibly touch his heart,
and bring him to the further knowledge of the truth
in his own time: and if God shall influence this
poor man to convert and instruct the ignorant sa-
vage his wife, I can never believe that he shall be
cast away himself: and have I not reason then to
rejoice, the nearer any are brought to the knowledge
of Christ, though they may not be brought quite
home into the bosom of the Catholic church, just at
the time when I may defire it; leaving it to the
goodness of Christ to perfect his work in his own
time, and his own way? Certainly I would rejoice,
if all the savages in America were brought, like this
poor
poor woman, to pray to God, though they were to
be all Protestants at first, rather than they should con-
tinue pagans and heathens; firmly believing, that
he who had bestowed that first light upon them,
would sarther illuminate them with a beam of his
heavenly grace, and bring them into the pale of his
church, when he should fee good.
I was astonished at the sincerity and temper of this
truly pious Papist, as much as I was oppressed by the
power of his reasoning: and it presently occurred to
my thoughts, that if such a temper was universal,
we might be all Catholic Christians, whatever
church or particular profession we joined to, or
joined in; that a spirit of charity would soon work
us all up into right principles; and, in a word, as
he thought that the like charity would make us all
Catholics, so I told him, I believed, had all the
members of his church the like moderation, they
would soon be all Protestants: And there we left
that part, for we never disputed at all.
However, I talked to him another way; and,
taking him by the hand, My friend, said I, I wish
all the clergy of the Roman church were bleffed with
such moderation, and an equal share of your cha-
rity: I am entirely of your opinion; but I must
tell you, that if you should preach such doctrine
in Spain or Italy, they would put you into the in-
quisition.
It may be so, said he; I know not what they might
do in Spain and Italy; but I will not say they would
be the better Christians for that severity; for I
am sure there is no heresy in too much charity.
Well,
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
Well, as Will Atkins and his wife were gone,
our business there was over: so we went back our
own way; and when we came back, we found them
waiting to be called in. Observing this, I asked
my clergyman if we should discover to him that
we had seen him under the bush, or no; and it was
his opinion we should not; but that we should talk
to him first, and hear what he would say to us: so
we called him in alone, nobody being in the place
but ourselves; and I began with him thus:
Will Atkins, said I, prithee what education had
you? What was your sather?
W. A. A better man than ever I shall be. Sir,
my sather was a clergyman.
R. C. What education did he give you?
W. A. He would have taught me well, Sir; but
I despised all education, instruction, or correction,
iike a beast as I was.
R. C. It is true, Solomon says " he that despiseth
"reproof is brutish."
W. A. Ay, Sir, I was brutish indeed; I mur-
dered my sather: for God's sake, Sir, talk no more
about that, Sir; I murdered my poor sather.
Priest. Ha? a murderer!
[Here the priest started (fer I interpreted every word
as he spoke it) and looked pale: It seems he believed
that Will had really killed his own father.]
R. C. No, no, Sir, I do not understand him so.
Will Atkins, explain yourself: you did not kill your
father, did you, with your own hands?
W. A. No, Sir; I did not cut his throat; but I
cut the thread of all his comforts, and shortened
his
his days; I broke his heart by the most ungrate-
ful, unnatural return, for the most tender, asfection-
ate treatment that ever sather gave, or child could
receive.
R. C. Well, I did not ask you about your sather, to
extort this confession; I pray God give you repent-
ance for it, and forgive you that, and all your other
sins: but I asked you, because I see that though you
have not much learning, yet you are not so ignorant
as some are, in things that are good; that you have
known more of religion a great deal than you have
practised.
W. A. Though you, Sir, did not extort the con-
fession that I make about my sather, conscience does;
and whenever we come to look back upon our lives,
the fins against our indulgent parents are certainly .
the first that touch us; the wounds they make lie
deepest; and the weight they leave will lie heaviest
upon the mind of all the sins we can commit.
R. C. You talk too feelingly and sensible for me,
Atkins; I cannot bear it.
W. A. Tou bear it, master! I dare say you know
nothing of it.
R. C. Yes, Atkins; every shore, every hill, nay,
I may say, every tree in this island, is witness to the
anguish of my soul, for my ingratitude, and base
usage of a good tender sather; a sather much like
your's, by your description; and I murdered my
father as well as you, Will Atkins; but think, for
all that, my repentance is short of your's too, by a
great deal.
[I would have said more, is I could have restrained my
passions; but I thought this poor man's repentance
was
was so much fincerer than mine; that I was going to
leave off the discourse, and retire, for I was sur-
prised with what he said; and thought that instead
of my going about to teach and instruct him, the
man was made a teacher and instructor to me, in a
most surprising and unexpected manner.]
I laid all this before the young clergyman, who
was greatly affected with it, and said to me, Did I
not say, Sir, that when this man was converted, he
would preach to us all? I tell you, Sir, if this one
man be made a true penitent, here will be no need
of me; he will make Christians of all in the island.
But having a little composed myself, I renewed my
discourse with Will Atkins.
But, Will, said I, how comes the fense of this
matter to touch you just now?
W. A. Sir, you have set me about a work that
has struck a dart through my very foul; I have been
talking about God and religion to my wife, in order,
as you directed me, to make a Christian of her; and
she has preached such a fern jn to me as I mall never
forget while I live.
R. C. No, no; it is not your wife has preached
to you: but when you were moving religious argu-
ments to her, conscience has flung them back upon
you.
W. A. Ay, Sir, with such a force as is not to
be resisted.
R. C. Pray, Will, let us know what passed be-
tween you and your wife; for I know something of
it already.
W. A. Sir, it is impossible to give you a full ac-
count of it: I am too full to hold it, and yet have
no
Ho tongue to express it: but let her have said what
she will, and though I cannot give you an account
of it, this I can tell you of it, that I resolve to
amend and reform my life.
R. C. But tell us some of it. How did you be-
gin, Will? For this has been an extraordinary case,
that is certain; she has preached a sermon, indeed,
if she has wrought this upon you.
W. A. Why, I first told her the nature of our
laws about marriage, and what the reasons were that
men and women were obliged to enter into such
compacts, as it was neither in the power of one or
other to break; that otherwise, order and justice
could not be maintained, and men would run from
their wives, and abandon their children, mix con-
fusedly with one another, and neither samilies be
kept entire, or inheritances be settled by a legal de-
scent.
R. C. You talk like a civilian, Will. Could you
make her understand what you meant by inheri-
tance and samilies? They know no such thing
among the savages, but marry any how, without
any regard to relation, consanguinity, or samily;
brother and sister, nay, as I have been told, even
the sather and daughter, and the son and the mo-
ther.
W. A. I believe, Sir, you are misinformed;—
my wife assures me of the contrary, and that they
abhor it. Perhaps, for any further relations, they
may not be so exact as we are; but she tells me they
never touch one another in the near relations you
speak of.
R.C. Well,
R. C. Well, what did she say to what you told
her?
'W. A. She said she liked it very well; and it was
much better than in her country.
R. C. But did you tell her what marriage was?
W. A. Ay, ay, there began all our dialogue. I
asked her, If she would be married to me our way?
She asked me, What way that was? I told her mar-
riage was appointed of God; and here we had a
strange talk together indeed, as ever man and wife
had, I believe.
[N. B. This dialogue between W. Atkins and his wise,
as I took it down in writing, just aster he told it me,
was as follows:
Wife. Appointed by your God! Why, have you
a God in your country?
W. A. Yes, my dear, God is in every country?
Wife. No your God in my country; my country
have the great old Benamuckee God.
W. A. Child, I am very unsit to shew you who
God is; God is in heaven, and made the heaven
and the earth, the sea, and all that in them is.
Wife. No makee de earth; no you God makee
de earth; no make my country.
{W. A. laughed a little at her expression of God not
making her country.]
Wife. No laugh: Why laugh me? This no ting
to laugh.
[He was justly reproved by his wise; for she was more
serious than he at first. J
W. A. That's
W. A. That's true indeed; I will not laugh any
more, my dear.
Wife. Why you say, you God make all?
W. A. Yes, child, our God made the whole
world, and you, and me, and all things; for he is
the only true God; there is no God but he; he lives
for ever in heaven.
Wife. Why you no tell me long ago?
W. A. That's true indeed; but I have been a
wicked wretch, and have not only forgotten to ac-
quaint thee with any thing before, but have lived
without God in the world myself.
Wife. What have you de great God in your coun-
try, you no know him? No say O to him? No do
good ting for him? That no imposlible!
W. A. It is too true though, for all that: we live
as if there was no God in heaven, or that he had no
power on earth.
Wise. But why God let you do so? Why he no
makee you good live?
W. A. It is all our own fault.
Wife. But you say me, he is great, much great,
have much great power; can make kill when he
will: why he no makee kill when you no serve him?
No say O to him? No be good mans?
W. A. That is true; he might strike me dead,
and I ought to expect it; for I have been a wicked
wretch, that is true: but God is merciful, and does
not deal with us as we deserve.
Wife. But then, do not you tell God tankee for
that too?
W. A. No, indeed; I have not thanked God for
his mercy, any more than I have feared God for his
power.
Wife.
Wife. Then you God no God; me no think, be*
lieve he be such one, great much power, strong;
no makee kill you, though you makee him much
angry?
W. A. What! will my wicked life hinder you
from believing in God! What a dreadful creature
am I! And what a sad truth is it, that the horrid
lives of Christians hinder the conversion of heathens!
Wife. How me tink you have great much God up
there, (she points up to heaven,) and yet no do well,
no do good ting? Can he tell? Sure he no tell what
you do.
W. A. Yes, yes, he knows and fees all things; he
hears us speak, sees what we do, knows what we
think, though we do not speak.
Wife. What! he no hear you swear, curse, speak
the great damn?
W. A. Yes, yes, he hears it all.
Wife. Where be then the muchee great power
strong?
W. A. He is merciful; that is all we can say for
it; and this proves him to be the true God: He is
God, and not man; and therefore we are not con-
sumed.
[Here Will Atkins told us, he was struck with horror
to think how he could tell his wife so clearly, that
God fees, and hears, and knows the secret thoughts
of the heart, and all that we do; and yet that he
had dared to do all the vile things he had done.]
Wife. Merciful! what you call dat?
W. A. He is our sather and maker; and he pities
and spares us.
I Wife.
Wise. So then he never makee kill, never angry
when you do wicked; then he no good himself, or
no great able.
W. A. Yes, yes, my dear; he is insinitely good,
and infinitely great, and able to punish too; and
sometimes to shew his justice and vengeance, he lets
fly his anger to destroy sinners, and make examples;
many are cut osf in their sins.
Wise. But no makee kill you yet; then he tell
you, may be, that he no makee you kill, so you
make de bargain with him, you do bad ting, he
no be angry at you, when he be angry at other
mans?
W. A. No, indeed, my sins are all presumptions
upon his goodness; and he would be infinitely just,
is he destroyed me, as he has done other men.
Wise. Well, and yet no kill, no makee you dead I
What you say to him for that? You no tell him
tankee for all that too!
W. A. I am an unthankful, ungrateful dog, that
is true.
Wife. Why he no makee you much good better?
You say he makee you.
W. A. He made me as he made all the world;
*tis I have deformed myself, and abused his goodness,
and have made myself an abominable wretch.
Wise. I wish you makee God know me; I no
makee him angry; I no do bad wicked ting.
[Here Will Atkins said his heart funk within him, to
hear a poor, untaught creature, desire to be taught
to know God; and he such a wicked wretch, that
he could not say one word to her about God, but
what the reproach of his own carriage would make
Vol. II. N most:
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
most Irrational to her to believe; nay, that already
she could not believe in God, because he that was so
wicked was not destroyed.]
W. A. My dear, you mean you wish I could teach
you to know God, not God to know you; for he
knows you already, and every thought in your
heart.
Wise. Why then he know what I saw to you now;
he know me wish to know him; how shall me know
who makee me?
W. A. Poor creature, he must teach thee, I can-
not teach thee; I'll pray to him to teach thee to know
him; and to forgive me, that I am unworthy to
teach thee.
[The poor fellow was in such an agony at her desiring
him to make her know God, and her wishing to
know him, that, he said, he sell down on his knees
before her, and prayed to God to enlighten her
mind with the saving knowledge of Jesus Christ,
and to pardon his sins, and accept of his being the
unworthy instrument of instructing her in the prin-
ciples of religion; after which he fat down by her
again, and their dialogue went on.]
N. B. This was the time when we saw him kneel down
and lift up his hands.
Wife. What you put down the knee for? What
you hold up the hand for? What you say? Who
you speak to? What is that?
W. A. My dear, I bow my knees in token of my
submission to him that made me: I said O to him,
as you call it, and as you say your old men do to
their idol Benamuckee; that is, I prayed to him.
Wife.
Wise. What you say O to him for?
W. A. I prayed to him to open your eyes and
your understanding, that you may know him, and
be accepted by him.
Wise. Can he do that too?
W. A. Yes, he can; he can do all things.
Wise. But he no hear what you say?
W. A. Yes, he has bid us pray to him; and pro-
mised to hear us.
Wise. Bid you pray? When he bid you? How he
bid you? What you hear him speak?
W. A. No, we do not hear him speak; but he
has revealed himself many ways to us.
[Here he was at a great loss to make her understand
that God had revealed himself to us by his word;
and what his word was ; but at last he told it her thus:
W. A. God has spoken to some good men in for-
mer days, even from heaven, by plain words; and
God has inspired good men, by his Spirit; and they
have written all his laws down in a book.
Wise. Me no understand that: where is book?
W. A. Alas! my poor creature, I have not this
book; but I hope I shall, one time or other, get it
for you to read it.
[Here he embraced her with great affection; but with
inexpressible grief, that he had not a bible.]
Wise. But how you makee me know, that God
teachee them to write that book?
W. A. By the same rule that we know him to be
God.
Wise. What rule; what way you know?
N 2 W. A. Be-
W. A. Because he teaches and commands nothing
but what is good, righteous, and holy; and tends
to make us perfectly good,, as well as perfectly happy;
and because he forbids, and commands us to avoid
all that is wicked, that is evil in itself, or evil in its
consequences.
Wife. That me would understand, that me sain
fee; if he reward all good thing, punish all wicked
thing, he teachee all good thing, forbid all wicked
thing, he makee all thing, he give all thing; he
hear me when I say O to him, as you go to do just
now; he makee me good, if I wish be good; he
spare me, no makee kill me, when I no be good; all
this you say he do; yes, he be great God; me take,
think, believe, him be great God; me say O to him
too, with you, my dear.
Here the poor man said he could forbear no
longer; but raising her up, made her kneel by him;
and he prayed to God aloud, to instruct her in the
knowledge of himself,"by his Spirit; and that by
some good providence, if possible, she might some
time or other come to have a bible, that she might
read the word of God, and be taught by him to
know him*
[This was the time that we saw him list her up by the
hand, and saw him kneel down by her, as above.]
f .
They had several other discourses, it seems, after
this, too long to set down here; and particularly
she made him promise, that since he confessed his
own life had been a wicked, abominable course of
provocation against God, that he would reform it,
and not make God angry any more, lest he should
"2 make
make him dead, as me called it, and then she should
be left alone, and never be taught to know this God
better 4 and lest he should be miserable, as he had
told her wicked men should be after death.
This was a strange account, and very affecting to
us both, but particularly the young clergyman: he
was indeed wonderfully surprised with it .; but under
the greatest affliction imaginable, that he could not
talk to her; that he could not speak English to make
her understand him; and as she spoke but very
broken English, he could not understand her. How-
ever, he turned himself to me, and told me, that
he believed there must be more to do with this wo-
man than to marry her; I did not understand him
at first; but at length he explained himself; viz-
That she ought to be baptized.
I agreed with him in that part readily, and was for
going about it presently: No, no; hold, Sir, said
he, though I would have her baptized by all means,
yet I must observe, that Will Atkins., her husband, has
indeed brought her, in a wonderful manner, to be
willing to embrace a religious life; and has given
her just ideas of the being of a God, of his power,
justice, and mercy; yet I defire to know of him, if
he has said any thing to her of Jesus Christ, and of
the salvation of sinners; of the nature of saith in
him4 and the redemption by him.; of the holy Spi-
rit, the resurrection, the last judgment, and a fu-
ture state.
I called Will Atkins again, and asked him; bat the
poor fellow fell immediately into tears, and told us;
he had laid something to her of all those things, but
that he was himself so wicked a creature, and his
N 3 own
own conscience so reproached him with his horrid,
ungodly life, that he trembled at the apprehensions,
that her knowledge of him should lessen the attention
she should give to those things, and make her rather
contemn religion, than receive it: but he was as-
sured, he said, that her mind was so disposed to re-
ceive due impressions of all those things, that if I
would but discourse with her, she would make it
appear to my satissaction, that my labour would not
be lost upon her.
Accordingly I called her in, and placing myself
as interpreter, between my religious priest and the
woman, I entreated him to begin with her: but sure
such a sermon was never preached by a popish priest
in these latter ages of the world; and, as I told him,
I thought he had all the zeal, all the knowledge, all
the sincerity of a Christian, without the errors of a
Roman Catholic; and that s took him to be such a
clergyman as the Roman bishops were, before the
church of Rome assumed spiritual sovereignty over
the consciences of men.
In a word, he brought the poor woman to em-
brace the knowledge of Christ, and of redemption
by him, not with wonder and astonishment only, as
slie did the first notions of a God, but with joy and
saith, with an affection, and a surprising degree of
understanding, scarce to be imagined, much less to
be expressed; and at her own request she was bap-
tized.
When he was preparing to baptize her, I en-
treated him, that he would perform that office with
some caution, that the man might not perceive he
was of the Roman church, if possible; because of
other
other ill consequences which might attend a difference
among us in that very religion which we were in-
structing the other in. He told me, that as he had
no consecrated chapel, nor proper things for the
office, I should see he would do it in a manner, that
I should not know by it that he was a Roman Ca-
tholic myself, if I had not known it before: and
so he did; for saying only some words over to him-
self in Latin, which I could not understand, he poured
a whole dish full of water upon the woman's head,
pronouncing in French very loud, Mary; which was
the name her husband defired me to give her, for I
was her god-sather, / baptize thee in the name of
the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost;
so that none could know any thing by it, what reli-
gion he was of: he gave the benediction afterwards
in Latin; but either Will Atkins did not know but it
was in French, or else did not take notice of it at
that time.
As soon as this was over, he married them; and
after the marriage was over, he turned himself to
Will Atkins, and in a very affectionate manner ex-
horted him not only to persevere in that good dispo-
sition he was in, but to support the convictions that
were upon him, by a resolution to reform his life:
told him, it was in vain to say he repented, if he
did not forsake his crimes; represented to him, how
God had honoured him with being the instrument
of bringing his wife to the knowledge of the Chris-
tian religion; and that he should be careful he did
not dishonour the grace of God; and that, if he
did, he would see the heathen a better Christian than
N 4 himself;
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
himself; the savage converted, and the instrument
cast away!
He said a great many good things to them both,
and then recommended them, in a few words, to
God's goodness; gave them the benediction again,
I repeating every thing to them in English: And thus
ended the ceremony. I think it was the most plea-
sant, agreeable day to me, that ever I passed in my
whole life.
But my clergyman had not done yet; his thoughts
hung continually upon the conversion of the 37 sa-
vages? and sain he would have staid upon the island
to have undertaken it: but I convinced him, First,
that his undertaking was impracticable in itself; and
secondly, that, perhaps, I could put it into a way of
being done, in his absence, to his satissaction; of
which by and by.
Having thus brought the affair of the island to a
narrow compass, I was preparing to go on board the
ship, when the young man, whom I had taken out
of the samished ship's company, came to me, and
told me, he understood I had a clergyman with me,
and that I had caused the Englishmen to be married to
the savages, whom they called wives; that he had a
match too, which he defired might be finished before
I went, between two Christians; which he hoped
would not be disagreeable to me.
I knew this must be the young woman who was
his mother's servant, for there was no other Christian
woman on the island; so I began to persuade him
not to do any thing of that kind rashly, or because
he found himself in this solitary circumstance: I re-
presented, that he had some considerable substance in
the
the world, and good friends, as I understood by him-
self, and by his maid also; that the maid was not only
poor, and a servant, but was unequal to him, she
being twenty-six or twenty-seven years old, and he
not above seventeen or eighteen; that he might very
probably, with my assistance, make a remove from
this wilderness, and come into his own country again;
and that then it would be a thousand to one but he
would repent his choice; and the dislike of that cir-
cumstance might be disadvantageous to both. I was
going to say more, but he interrupted me, smiling;
and told me, with a great deal of modesty, that I
mistook in my guesses; that he had nothing of
that kind in his thoughts, his present circum-
stances being melancholy and disconsolate enough;
and he was very glad to hear, that I had some
thoughts of putting them in a way to fee their
own country again; and that nothing should have
set him upon staying there, but that the voyage I
was going was so exceeding long and hazardous, and
would carry him quite out of the reach of all his
friends; that he had nothing to defire of me, but
that I would settle him in some little property in the
island where he was; give him a servant or two, and
some few necessaries, and he would fettle himself
here like a planter, waiting the good time when, if
ever I returned to England, I would redeem him,
and hoped I would not be unmindful of him when I
came to England; that he would give me some letters
to his friends in London, to let them know how good
I had been to him, and what part of the world, and
what circumstances I had left him in; and he pro-
mised me, that whenever I redeemed him, the plan-
tation,
tation, and all the improvements he had made upon
it, let the value be what it would, should be wholly
mine.
His discourse was very prettily delivered, consi-
dering his youth; and was the more agreeable to
me, because he told me. positively the match was not
for himself. I gave him all possible assurances, that
if I lived to come safe to England, I would deliver
his letters, and do his business effectually; and that
he might depend I would never forget the circum-
stances I left him in; but still I was impatient to
know who was the person to be married: Upon
which he told me it was my Jack of all Trades, and
his maid Susan.
I was most agreeably surprised when he named
the match; for indeed I had thought it very suita-
ble. The character of that man I have given al-
ready; and as for the maid, she was a very honest,
modest, sober, and religious young woman; had a
very good share of fense; was agreeable enough in
her person; spoke very handsomely, and to the pur-
pose; always with decency and good manners, and
not backward to speak when any thing required it,
or impertinently forward to speak when it Was not
her business; very handy and housewifely in any
thing that was before her; an excellent manager,
and fit indeed to have been governess to the whole
island; she knew very well how to behave herself to
all kind of folks she had about her, and to better, if
she had found any there.
The match being proposed in this manner, we
married them the same day; and, as I was sather
at the; altar, as I may say, and gave her away, so I
gave
gave her a portion; for I appointed her and her hus-
band a handsome large space of ground for their
plantation; and, indeed, this match, and the pro-
posal the young gentleman made to me, to give him
a small property in the island, put me upon parcel-
ling it out among them, that they might not quarrel
afterwards about their situation.
This sharing out the land to them I left to Will
Atkins, who, indeed, was now grown a most sober,
grave, managing fellow; perfectly reformed, exceed-
ing pious and religious; and, as sar as I may be al-
lowed to speak positively in such a case, I verily be-
lieve, was a true sincere penitent.
He divided things so justly, and so much to every
one's satissaction, that they only defired one general
writing under my hand for the whole; which I caused
to be drawn up, and signed and sealed to them, set-
ting out the bounds and situation of every man's
plantation, and testifying, that I gave them thereby,
severally, a right to the whole possession and inhe-
ritance of the respective plantations or sarms, with
their improvements, to them and their heirs; re-
serving all the rest of the island as my own property,
and a certain rent for every particular plantation,
after eleven years, if I, or any one from me, or in
my name, came to demand it, producing an attested
copy of the same writing.
As to the government and laws among them, I
told them, I was not capable of giving them better
rules than they were able to give themselves; only
made them promise me, to live in love and good
neighbourhood with one another: And so I prepared
to leave them.
One
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
One thing I must not omit; and that is, that being
now settled in a kind of commonwealth among them-
selves, and having much business in hand, it was
but odd to have seven-and-thirty Indians live in a
nook of the island, independent, and, indeed, un-
employed; for, excepting the providing themselves
food, which they had disficulty enough in doing some-
times, they had no manner of business or property
to manage: I proposed therefore to the governor
Spaniard, that he should go to them with Friday's
father, and propose to them to remove, and either
plant for themselves, or take them into their several
families as servants, to be maintained for their la-
bour, but without being absolute slaves; for I would
not admic them to make them slaves by force, by
any means, because they had their liberty given by
capitulation, and, as it were, articles of surrender,
which they ought not to break.
They most willingly embraced the proposal, and
came all very chearfully along with him; so we al-
lotted them land and plantations, which three or
four accepted of, but all the rest chose to be em-
ployed as servants in the several samilies we had set-
tled; and thus my colony was in a manner settled,
as follows: The Spaniards possessed my original ha-
bitation, which was the capital city, and extended
their plantation all along the side of the brook,
which made the creek that I have so often described,
as far as my bower; and as they increased their cul-
ture, it went always eastward; the Englft lived in
the north-east part, where Will Atkins and his com-
rades began, and came on southward and south-
west, towards the back part of the Spaniards; and
every
189
every plantation had a great addition of land to take
in, if they found occasion; so that they need not
jostle one another for want of room.
All the west end of the isiand was left uninhabited,
that if any of the savages should come on more there,
only for their usual customary barbarities, they might
come and go; if they disturbed nobody, nobody
would disturb them ; and no doubt but they were
often ashore, and went away again; for I never heard
that the planters were ever attacked and disturbed any
more.
It now came into my thoughts, that I had hinted
to my friend the clergyman, that the work of con-
verting the savages might, perhaps, be set on foot in
his absence, to his satissaction; and I told him, that
now I thought it was put in a sair way; for the sa-
vages being thus divided among the Christians, if
they would but every one of them do their part with
those which came under their hands, I hoped it might
have a very good effect.
He agreed presently in that: If, said he, they will
do their part; but how, says he, shall we obtain that
of them? I told him, we would call them all together,
and leave it in charge with them, or go to them one
by one, which he thought best; so we divided it;
he to speak to the Spaniards, who were all Papists;
and I to the English, who were all Protestants; and
we recommended it earnestly to them, and made
them promise, that they would never make any dis-
tinction of Papist or Protestant, in their exhorting
the savages to turn Christians; but teach them the
general knowledge of the true God, and of their Sa-
viour
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
viour Jesus Christ; and they likewise promised us,
that they would never have any differences or dis-
putes, one with another, about religion.
When I came to Will Atkins's house (I may call it
so; for such a house, or such a piece of basket-work,
I believe was not standing in the world again !) I fay,
when I came thither, I found the young woman I
have mentioned above, and William Atkins's wife,
were become intimates; and this prudent, religious
young woman, had perfected the work Will Atkins
had begun; and though it was not above four days
after what I have related, yet the new-baptized sa-
vage woman was made such a Christian, as I have
seldom heard of any like her, in all my observation
or conversation in the world.
It came next into my mind, in the morning, be-
fore I went to them, that among all the needful
things I had to leave with them, I had not left a
bible; in which I shewed myself less considering for
them, than my good friend the widow was for me,
when she sent me the cargo of iool. from Lisbon,
where she packed up three bibles and a prayer-book.
However, the good woman's charity had a greater
extent than ever she imagined; for they were re-
served for the comfort and instruction of those that
made much better use of them than I had done.
I took one of the bibles in my pocket, and when
I came to William Atkins's tent, or house, I found the
young woman, and Atkins's baptized wife, had been
discoursing of religion together; ("for William Atkins
told it me, with a greal deal of joy.) I asked, if they
were together now? And he said yes ; so I went
into the house, and he with me, and we found them
together,
4
together, very earneO: in discourse: O, Sir, says Wil-
liam Atkins, when God has sinners to reconcile
to himself, and aliens to bring home, he ne-
ver wants a messenger: My wife has got a new
instructor; I knew I was unworthy, as I was incapa-
ble of that work; that young woman has been sent
hither from Heaven; she is enough to convert a
whole island of savages. The young woman blushed,
and rose up to go away, but I defired her to sit still;
I told her she had a good work upon her hands, and
I hoped God would bless her in it.
We talked a little, and I did not perceive they
had any book among them, though I did not ask;
but I put my hand in my pocket, and pulled out my
bible; Here, said 1 to Atkins, I have brought you
an assistant, that, perhaps, you had not before. The
man was so confounded, that he was not able to
speak for some time; but recovering himself, he
takes it with both hands, and, turning to his wife,
Here, my dear, says he, did not I tell you, our
God, though he lives above, could hear what we
said? Here is the book I prayed for, when you and
I kneeled down under the bush; now God has heard
us and sent it. When he had said thus, the man
fell into such transport of a passionate joy, that be-
tween the joy of having it, and giving God thanks
for it, the tears ran down his sace like a child that
was crying.
The woman was surprized, and was like to have
run into a mistake, that none of us were aware of;
for she firmly believed God had sent the book upon
her husband's petition: It is true, that providentially
it was so, and might be taken so in a consequent
sense;
sense; but I believed it would have been no difficult
matter, at that time, to have persuaded the poof
woman to have believed, that an express messenger
came from heaven, on purpose to bring that indivi-
dual book; but it was too serious a matter to suffer
any delusion to take.place: So I turned to the
young woman, and told her, we did not desire to
impose upon the new convert, in her first and more
ignorant understanding of things; and begged her
to explain to her, that God may be very properly
said to answer our petitions, when in the course of
his Providence, such things are, in a particular
manner, brought to pass, as we petitioned for; but
we do not expect returns from Heaven, in a miracu-
lous and particular manner; and that it is our mercy
it is not so.
This the young woman did afterwards effectually;
so that there was, I assure you, no priestcraft used
here; and I mould have thought it one of the most
unjustifiable frauds in the world, to have had it so:
but the surprize of joy upon Will Atkins, is really
not to be expressed; and there, we may be sure, was
no delusion. Sure no man was ever more thankful
in the world for any thing of its kind, than he was
for this bible; and I believe, never any man was
glad of a bible from a better principle; and though
he had been a most profligate creature, desperate,
headstrong, outrageous, furious, and wicked to a
great degree; yet this man is a standing rule to us
all, for the well instructing children; viz. That pa-
rents mould never give over to teach and instruct, or
ever despair of the success of their endeavours,. let
the children be ever so obstinate, refractory, or, to
appear-
appearance, insensible of instruction; for if ever
God in his Providence touches the consciences of
such, the force of their education returns upon them,
and the early instruction of parents is not lost,
though it may have been many years laid afleep;
but, some time or other, they may find the benefit
of it.
Thus it was with this poor man. However igno-
rant he was, or divested of religion and Christian
knowledge, he found he had some to do with now more
ignorant than himself; and that the least part of the
instruction of his good father, that could now come
to his mind, was of use to him.
Among the rest it occurred to him, he said, how
his sather used to insist much upon the inexpressible
value of the bible; the privilege and blessing of it
to nations, samilie:, and persons; but he never en-
tertained the least notion of the worth of it till now;
when, being to talk to heathens, savages, and bar-
barians, he wanted the help of the written oracle for
his assistance.
The young woman was very glad of it also, for
the present occasion, though she had one; and so
had the youth on board our ship, among the goods
which were not yet brought on shore. And now,
having said so many things of this young woman, I
cannot omit telling one story more of her and my-
self, which has something in it very informing and
remarkable.
I have related to what extremity the poor young
woman was reduced; how her mistress was
starved to death, and did die, on board that un-
happy ship we met at sea; and how the whole ship's
Vol. II. O company

company being reduced to the last extremity, ths
gentlewoman, and her son, and this maid, were first
hardly used, as to provisions; and, at last, totally
neglected and starved -r that is to fay, brought to
the last extremity of hunger.
One day, being discoursing with her upon the ex-
tremities they suffered, I asked her, if she could de-
scribe, by what she felt, what it was to starve, and
how it appeared? She told me, she believed she
could; and she told her tale very distinctly thus:
First, Sir, said she, we had for some days fared
exceeding hard, and suffered very great hunger; but
now, at last, we were wholly without food of any
kind, except sugar, and a little wine, and a little
water. The first day after I had received no food
at all, I found myself, towards evening, first empty
and sickish at my stomach; and nearer night, migh-
tily inclined to yawning, and sleepy; I laid down
on a couch in the great cabin, to sleep; and slept
about three hours, and awaked a little refreshed,
having taken a glass of wine when I lay down: after
being about three hours awake, it being about five
o'clock in the morning, I found myself empty, and
my stomach sickish again, and laid down again; but
could not sleep at all, being very saint and ill: and
thus I continued all the second day, with a strange
variety \ first hungry, then sick again, with Teachings,
to vomit: the second night, being obliged to go to
bed again, without any food more than a draught of
fair water, and being asleep, I dreamed I was at
Barbadocs, and that the market was mightily stocked
with provisions; that I bought some for my mistress,
and went and dined very heartily.
2 I thought
I thought my stomach was full after this, as it
'would have been after, or at, a good dinner; but
when I waked, I was exceedingly funk in my spirits
to find myself in the extremity of samine: the last
glass of wine we had, I drank, and put sugar into
it, because of its having some spirit to supply nou-
rishment; but there being no substance in the sto-
mach for the digesting office to work upon, I found
the only effect of the wine was, to raise disagreeable
fumes from the stomach into the head; and I lay,
as they told me, stupid and senseless, as one drunk,
for some time.
The third day in the morning, after a night of
strange and confused inconsistent dreams, and rather
dozing than sleeping, I awaked, ravenous and fu-
rious with hunger; and I question, had not my un-
derstanding returned, and conquered it; I say, I
question whether, if I had been a mother, and had
had a little child with me, its life would have been
safe or no.
This lasted about three hours; during which time
I was twice raging mad, as any creature in Bedlam,
as my young master told me, and as he can now in-
form you.
In one of these fits of lunacy, or distraction, whe-
ther by the motion of the ship, or some slip of my
foot, I know not; I fell down, and struck my sace
against the corner of a pallet-bed, in which my mis-
tress lay; and with the blow the blood gushed out
of my nose; and the cabin-boy bringing me a little
bason, I sat down and bled into it a great deal; and
as the blood ran from me, I came to myself; and the
O 2 violence
violence of the dame, or the fever I was in, abated,
and so did the ravenous part of the hunger.
Then I grew sick, and reached to vomit, but could
not; for I had nothing in my stomach to bring up;
after I had bled some time, I swooned, and they all
believed I was dead; but I came to myself soon af-
ter, and then had a most dreadful pain in my sto-
mach, not to be described; not like the cholic, but a
gnawing eager pain for food; and, towards night,
it went off with a kind of earnest wishing or longing
for food; something like, as I suppose, the long-
ing of a woman with child. I took another draught
of water, with sugar in it, but my stomach loathed
the sugar, and brought it all up again: Then I took
a draught of water, without sugar, and that stayed
with me; and I laid me down upon the bed, pray-
ing most heartily, that it would please God to take
me away; and composing my mind in hopes of it, I
slumbered awhile; and then waking, thought my-
self dying, being light with vapours from an empty
stomach: I recommended my foul to God, and ear-
nestly wished that somebody would throw me into
the sea.
All this while my mistress lay by me, just, as I
thought, expiring; but bore it with much more pa-
tience than I, and gave the last bit of bread she had
to her child, my young master, who would not have
taken it, but she obliged him to eat it; and, I believe,
it saved his life.
Towards the morning, I slept again; and first,
when I awaked, I fell into a violent passion of cry-
ing; and after that, had a second fit of violent hun-
ger, so that I got up ravenous, and in a most dread-
1 ful
ful condition: Had my mistress been dead, as much
as I loved her, I am certain I mould have eaten a
piece of her flesh with as much relish, and as uncon-
cerned, as ever I did the flesti of any creature ap-
pointed for food; and once or twice I was going to
bite my own arm. At last, I saw the bason, in
which was the blood I had bled at my nose the day
before; I ran to it, and swallowed it with such haste,
and such a greedy appetite, as if I had wondered
nobody had taken it before, and afraid it should be
taken from me now.
Though after it was down the thoughts of it silled
me with horror, yet it checked the fit of hunger;
and I drank a draught of sair water, and was composed
and refreshed for some hours after it. This was the
fourth day; and thus I held it till towards night,
when, within the compass of three hours, I had all
these several circumstances over again, one after ano-
ther; viz. sick, sleepy, eagerly hungry, pain in the
stomach, then ravenous again, then sick again, then
lunatic, then crying, then ravenous again, and so
every quarter of an hour; and my strength wasted
exceedingly. At night I laid me down, having no
comfort, but in the hope that I should die before
morning.
All this night I had no sleep, but the hunger was
now turned into a disease; and I had a terrible cho-
lic and griping; wind, instead of food, having found
its way into the bowels; and in this condition I lay
till morning, when I was surprized a little with
the cries and lamentations of my young master, who
called out to me, that his mother was dead. I lifted
O 3 myself
myself up a little, for I had not strength to rise, but
found she was not dead, though she was able to give
very little signs of life.
1 had then such convulsions in my stomach, for
want of some sustenance, that I cannot describe them;
with such frequent throes and pangs of appetite, that
nothing but the tortures of death can imitate; and
this condition I was in, when I heard the seamen
above cry put, A sail! a sail! and halloo and jump
about as if they were distracted.
I was not able to get off from the bed, and my
mistress much less; and my master was so sick, that
J thought he had been expiring; so we could not
open the cabin door, or get any account what it
was that occasioned such a combustion; nor had we
any conversation with the ship's company for two
days, they having told us they had not a mouthful
of any thing to eat in the ship; and they told us
afterwards, they thought we had been dead.
It was this dreadful condition we were in when
you were sent to save our lives; and how you found
us, Sir, you know as well as I, and better too.
This was her own relation, and is such a distinct
account of starving to death, as, I confess, I never
met with, and was exceeding entertaining to me:
I am the rather apt to believe it to be a true account,
because the youth gave me an account of a good part
of it; though I must own, not so distinct, and so
feelingly as his maid; and the rather, because, it
seems, his mother fed him at the price of her own
life: but the poor maid, though her constitution
being stronger than that of her mistress, who was in
years.,
199
years, and a weakly woman too, me might struggle
harder with it; I say, the poor maid might be sup-
posed to feel the extremity something sooner than
her mistress, who might be allowed to keep the last
bits something longer than she parted with any to
relieve the maid. No question, as the case is here
related, if our ship, or some other, had not so provi-
dentially met them, a few days more would have
ended all their lives, unless they had prevented it by
eating one another; and even that, as their case
stood, would have served them but a little while,
they being 500 leagues from any land, or any possi-
bility of relief, other than in the miraculous manner
it happened.—But this is by the way; I return to my
disposition of things among the people.
And first, it is to be observed here, that for many
reasons, I did not think fit to let them know any
thing of the sloop I had framed, and which I thought of
setting up among them; for I found, at least at my
first coming, such seeds of division among them)
that I saw it plainly, had I set up the sloop, and lest
it among them, they would, upon very light disgust,
have separated, and gone away from one another;
or perhaps have turned pirates, and so made the
island a den of thieves, instead of a plantation of so-
ber and religious people, as I intended it to be; nor
did I leave the two pieces of brass cannon that I had
on board, or the two quarter deck guns, that my
nephew took extraordinary, for the same reason: I
thought they had enough to qualify them for a de-
fensive war, against any that should invade them; but
J. was not to set them up for an offensive war, or to
O $ encourage
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
encourage them to go abroad to attack others, which,
in the end, would only bring ruin and destruction
upon themselves and all their undertakings: I re-
served the sloop, therefore, and the guns, for their
service another way, as I shall observe in its place.
I have now done with the island: I left them all
in good circumstances, and in a flourishing condi-
tion, and went on board my ship again the fifth day
of May, having been five-and-twenty days among
them; and, as they were all resolved to stay upon
the island till I came to remove them, I promised to
send some further relief from the Brasils, if I could
possibly find an opportunity; and particularly I pro-
mised to send them some cattle; such as sheep, hogs,
and cows; for as to the two cows and calves which
I brought from England, we had been obliged, by
the length of our voyage, to kill them at sea, for
want of hay to feed them.
The next day, giving them a salute of five guns
at parting, we set sail, and arrived at the bay of All
Saints, in the Brafils, in about twenty-two days;
meeting nothing remarkable in our passage but this,
That about three days after we sailed, being becalmed,
and the current setting strong to the N. N. E. run-
ning, as it were, into a bay or gulph, on the land-
side, we were driven something out of our course;
and once or twice our men cried Land, to the west-
ward; but whether it was the continent, or islands,
we could not tell by any means.
But the third day, towards evening, the sea smooth
and the weather calm, we saw the sea, as it were,
covered, towards the land, with something very
black,
black, not being able to discover what it was; but,
after some time, our chief mate going up the main
lhrouds a little way, and looking at them with a per-
spective, cried out, it was an army. I could not
imagine what he meant by an army, and spoke a little
hastily, calling the fellow a fool, or some such word;
Nay, Sir, says he, don't be angry, for it is an army,
and a fleet too; for I believe there are a thousand
canoes, and you may fee them paddle along, and
they are coming towards us too apace, and full of
men.
1 was a little surprised then, indeed, and so was
my nephew the captain; for he had heard such ter-
rible stories of them in the island, and having never
been in those seas before, that he could not tell what
to think of it, but said two or three times, we should
all be devoured. I must confess, considering we
were becalmed, and the current set strong towards the
shore, I liked it the worse; however, I bade him not
be afraid, but bring the ship to an anchor, as soon
as we came so near as to know that we must engage
them.
The weather continued calm, and they came on
apace towards us; sol gave orders to come to an an-
chor, and furl all our sails. As for the savages,
I told them they had nothing to fear from them but
fire; and therefore they should get their boats out,
and sasten them, one close by the head, and the other
by the stern, and man them both well, and wait the
issue in that posture: this I did, that the men in the
boats might be ready, with sheet arid buckets, to put
out
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
out any fire these savages might endeavour to six upon
the outside of the ship.
In this posture we lay by for them, and in a little
while they came up with us, but never was such a
horrid sight seen by Christians: My mate was much
mistaken in his calculation of their number, I mean
of a thousand canoes; the most we could make of
them when they came up, being about 126; and a
great many of them too; for some of them had six-
teen or seventeen men in them, some more, and the
least six or seven.
When they came nearer to us, they seemed to be
struck with wonder and astonishment, as at a sight
which they had, doubtless, never seen before; nor
could they, at first, as we afterwards understood,
know what to make of us. They came boldly up
however, very near to us, and seemed to go about
to row round us; but we called to our men in the
boats, not to let them come too near them.
This very order brought us to an engagement with
them, without our designing it; for five or six of
their large canoes came so near our long-boat, that
our men beckoned with their hands to them to keep
back; which they understood very well, and went
back; but at their retreat about 500 arrows came on
board us from those boats; and one of our men in
the long-boat was very much wounded.
However, I called to them not to fire by any means;
but we handed down some deal boards into the boat,
and the carpenter presently set up a kind of a fence,
like waste boards, to cover them from the arrows of
the savages, if they mould shoot again.
About
About half an hour afterwards they came all up in a
body astern of us, and pretty near, so near that we
could easily discern what they were, though we could
not tell their design, I easily found they were some
of my old friends, the same sort of savages that I
had been used to engage with; and in a little time
more they rowed somewhat sarther out to sea, till
they came directly broadside with us, and then rowed
down straight upon us, till they came so near,
that they could hear us speak: Upon this, I ordered
all my men to keep close, lest they should shoot any
more arrows, and make all our guns ready; but
being so near as to be within hearing, I made Friday
go out upon the deck, and call out aloud to them
in his language, to know what they meant; which
accordingly he did: whether they understood him
or not, that I know not; but, as soon as he had
called to them, six of them, who were in the fore-
most, or nighest boat to us, turned their canoes from
us; and, stooping down, shewed us their naked
backsides ; just as if, in English, (saving your pre-
sence) they had bid us kiss . Whether
this was a defiance or challenge, we know not; or
whether it was done in mere contempt, or a signal
to the rest; but immediately Friday cried out, They
were going to shoot; and unhappily for him (poor
fellow) they let fly about 300 of their arrows; and,
to my inexpressible grief, killed poor Friday, no other
man being in their sight. The poor fellow was shot
with no less than three arrows, and about three more
fell very nigh him; such unlucky marksmen they
were!
I was
I was so enraged with the loss of my old servant,
the companion of all my sorrows and solitudes, that
I immediately ordered five guns to be loaded with
small mot, and four with great; and gave them such
a broadside as they had never had in their lives be-
fore, to be sure.
They were not above half a cable's length off
when we fired; and our gunners took their aim so
well, that three or four of their canoes were over-
set, as we had reason to believe, by one mot only.
The ill manners of turning up their bare backsides
to us, gave us no great offence; neither did I know
for certain whether that, which would pass for the
greatest contempt among us, might be understood so
by them or not; therefore in return, I had only re-
solved to have fired four or five guns with powder
only, which I knew would fright them susficiently:
but when they mot at us directly with all the fury they
were capable of, and especially as they had killed my
poor Friday, whom I so entirely loved and valued,
and who, indeed, so well deserved it; I not only had
been justified before God and man, but would have
been very glad, if I could, to have overset every
canoe there, and drowned every one of them.
I can neither tell how many we killed, or how
many we wounded, at this broadside; but sure such
a fright and hurry never was seen among such a
multitude: there were thirteen or fourteen of their
canoes split, and overset, in all; and the men all set
a swimming; the rest, frighted out of their wits,
scoured away as sast as they could, taking but little
care to save those whose boats were split or spoiled
with our shot: so I suppose that they were many of
them
them loll; and our men took up one poor fellow
swimming for his life, above an hour after they were
all gone.
Our small shot from our cannon must needs kill
and wound a great many; but, in short, we never
knew any thing how it went with them; for they
tied so sast, that, in three hours, or thereabouts, we
could not fee above three or four straggling canoes;
nor did we ever see the rest any more; for a breeze
of wind springing up the same evening, we weighed
and set sail for the Brasih.
We had a prisoner indeed, but the creature was
so sullen, that he would neither eat or speak; and
we all sancied he would starve himself to death; but
I took a way to cure him; for I made them take
him, and turn him into the long-boat, and make him
believe they would toss him into the sea again, and
so leave him where they found him, if he would not
speak: nor would that do, but they really did throw
him into the sea, and came away from him; and then
he followed them, for he swam like a cork, and
called to them in his tongue, though they knew not
one word of what he said. However, at last, they
took him in again, and then he began to be more
tractable; nor did I ever design they should drown
him.
We were now under sail again; but I was the most
disconsolate creature alive, for want of my man
Friday, and would have been very glad to have gone
back to the island, to have taken one of the rest
from thence for my occasion, but it could not be;
so we went on. We had one prisoner, as 1 have said;
and it was a long while before we could make him
understand
understand any thing; but, in time, our men taught
him some English, and he began to be a little tracta-
ble: Afterwards we enquired what country he came
from, but could make nothing of what he said; for
his speech was so odd, all gutturals, and spoken in
the throat , in such an hollow and odd manner, that
we could never form a word from him; and we were
all of opinion that they might speak that language
as well, if they were gagged, as otherwise; nor
could we perceive that they had any occasion either
for teeth, tongue, lips, or palate; but formed their
words just as a hunting-horn forms a tune, with an
open throat: He told us, however, some time after *
when we had taught him to speak a little English,
that they were going, with their kings, to fight a
great battle. When he said kings, we asked him,
how many kings? He said, there were five nation,'
(we could not make him understand the plural s.)
and that they all joined to go against two nation.
We asked him, What made them come up to us?
He said, To makee te great wonder look—Where it
is to be observed, that all those natives, as also those
of Africa, when they learn English, they always add
two e's at the end of the words where we use one,
and place the accent upon the last of them; as
makce, takee, and the like; and we could not break
them of it; nay, I could hardly make Friday leave
it off, thought at last he did.
And now I name the poor fellow once more, I
must take my last leave of him; poor honest Fridays
We buried him with all decency and solemnity possi-
ble, by putting him into a coffin, and throwing him
into the sea; and I caused them to fire eleven guns
for
for him: and so ended the life of the most grateful,
saithful, honest, and most affectionate servant that
ever man had.
We now went away with a sair wind for Brasil,
and, in about twelve days time, we made land in the
latitude of five degrees south of the line, being the
north-eastermost land of all that part of America.
We kept on S. by E. in sight of the shore four days,
when we made the Cape St. Augustine, and in three
days came to an anchor off the bay of All Saints,
the old place of my deliverance, from whence came
both my good and evil sate.
Never did a ship come to this part that had less
business than I had; and yet it was with great diffi-
culty that we were admitted to hold the least corres-
pondence on shore. Not my partner himself, who
was alive, and made a great figure among them,
not my two merchant trustees, nor the same of my
wonderful preservation in the island, could obtain
me that savour: but my partner, remembering that
I had given five hundred moidores to the prior of
the monastery of the Attgustines, and three hundred
and seventy-two to the poor, went to the monastery,
and obliged the prior that then was, to go to the go-
vernor, and beg leave for me presently, with the
captain, and one more, besides eight seamen, to come
on shore, and no more; and this upon condition
absolutely capitulated for, that we should not offer
to land any goods out of the ship, or to carry any
person away without licence.
They were so strict with us, as to landing any
goods, that it was with extreme difficulty that I got
on shore three bales of English goods, such as sine
broad
t^TE AND ADVENTURES
broad cloths, stuffs, and some linen, which I had
brought for a present to my partner.
He was a very generous, broad-hearted man,
though (like me) he came from little at first; and
though he knew not that I had the least design of
giving him any thing, he sent me on board a pre-
sent of fresh provisions, wine, and sweetmeats, worth
above thirty moidores, including some tobacco, and
three or four sine medals in gold. But I was even
with him in my present, which, as I have said, con-
sisted of sine broad cloth, English stuffs, lace, and fine
Hollands. Also, I delivered him about the value of
lool. sterling, in the same goods, for other uses;
and I obliged him to set up the sloop which I had
brought with me from England, as I have said, for
the use of my colony, in order to send the refresh-
ments I intended to my plantation.
Accordingly he got hands, and finished the sloop
in a very few days, for shc was already framed; and
I gave the master of her such instructions as he could
not miss the place; nor did he miss it, as I had an
account from my partner afterwards. I got him
soon loaded with the small cargo I had sent them;
and one of our seamen, that had been on shore with
me there, offered to go with the sloop, and settle
there, upon my letter to the governor Spaniard, to
allot him a sufficient quantity of land for a planta-
tion; and giving him some clothes, and tools for his
planting work, which he said he understood, having
been an old planter in Maryland, and a buccaneer
into the bargain.
I encouraged the fellow by granting all he de-
fired; and, as an addition, I gave him the savage
which
which we had taken prisoner of war, to be his slave,
and ordered the governor Spaniard to give him his
share of every thing he wanted, with the rest.
When we came to fit this man out, my old part-
ner told me, there was a certain very honest fellow,
a Brasil planter of his acquaintance, who had fallen
into the displeasure of the church: I know not what
the matter is with him, says he, but, on my con-
science, I think he is an heretic in his heart; and he
has been obliged to conceal himself for fear of the
inquisition; that he would be very glad of such an
opportunity to make his escape, with his wife and
two daughters; and if I would let them go to the
island, and allot them a plantation, he would give
them a small stock to begin with; for the osficers
of the inquisition had seized all his esfects and estate,
and he had nothing left but a little houshold stuff,
and two slaves; and, adds he, though I hate his
principles, yet I would not have him sall into their
hands, for he will assuredly be burnt alive if he
does.
I granted this presently, and joined my English-
man with them; and we concealed the man, and his
wife and daughters, on board our ship, till the sloop
put out to go to sea; and then (having put all their
goods on board the sloop some time before) we put
them onboard the sloop,after she was got out of thebay.
Our seaman was mightily pleased with this new
partner; and their stock, indeed, was much alike
rich in tools, and in preparations, for a sarm; but
nothing to begin with, but as above. However, they
carried over with them (which was worth all the rest)
some materials for planting sugar canes, with some
Vol. II. P plants
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
plants of canes; which he (I mean the Portugal
man) understood very well.
Among the rest of the supplies sent my tenants
in the illand, I sent them, by this sloop, three milch
cows and five calves, about twenty-two hogs among
them, three sows big with pig, two mares, and a
stone-horse.
For my Spaniards, according to my promise, I
engaged three Portugal women to go; and recom-
mended it to them to marry them, and use' them
kindly. I could have procured more women, but I
remembered that the poor persecuted man had two
daughters, and there were but five of the Spaniards
that wanted; the rest had wives of their own, tho'
in another country.
All this cargo arrived safe, and as you may easily
suppose, very welcome to my old inhabitants, who
were now (with this addition) between sixty and se-
venty people, besides little children; of which there
were a great many: I found letters at London from
them all, by way of Lisbon, when I came back to Eng-
land, being sent back to the Brasils by this sloop; of
which I shall take some notice in its place.
I have now done with my island, and all manner
of discourse about it; and whoever reads the rest
of my memorandums, would do well to turn his
thoughts entirely from it, and expect to read only of
the follies of an old man, not warned by his own harms,
much less by those of other men, to beware of the like;
not cooled by almost forty years misery and disap-
pointments; not satisfied with prosperity beyond
expectation; not made cautious by affliction and dis-
tress beyond imitation.
I had
211
I had no more business to go to thcEa/l Indies, than
a man at full liberty, and having committed no
crime, has to go to the turn-key at Newgate, and
desire him to lock him up among the prisoners there,
and starve him. Had I taken a small vessel from
England, and went directly to the island; had I
loaded her, as I did the other vessel, with all the ne-
cessaries for the plantation, and for my people ; took
a patent from the government here, to have secured
my property, in subjection only to that of England,
which, to be sure, I might have obtained; had I
carried over cannon and ammunition, servants, and
people to plant, and, taking possession of the place,
fortified and strengthened it in the name of England,
and increased it with people,asImight easily have done;
had I then settled myself there, and sent the ship back,
loaded with good rice, as I might also have done in
six months time, and ordered my friends to have
fitted her out again for our supply; had I done this,
and stayed there myself, I had, at least, acted like a
man of common sense; but I was possessed with
a wandering spirit, scorned all advantages, pleased
myself with being the patron of these people I had
placed there, and doing for them in a kind of haughty
majestic way, like an old patriarchal monarch; pro-
viding for them, as if I had been sather of the whole
samily, as well as of the plantation: but I never so
much as pretended to plant iii the name of any go-
vernment or nation, or to acknowledge any prince,
or to call my people subjects to any one nation more
than another; nay, I never so much as gave the
place a name; but left it as I found it, belonging to
no man; and the people under no discipline or go-
P 2 vernment
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
vernment but my own; who, though I had an in*
fluence over them as sather and benesactor, had no
authority or power to act or command one way or
other, sarther than voluntary consent moved them to
comply: yet even this, had I staid there, would have
done well enough; but as I rambled from them, and
came thither no more, the last letters I had from any
of them, were by my partner's means, who after-
wards sent another sloop to the place; and who sent
me word, though I had not the letter till five years
after it was written, that they went on but poorly, were
malecontent with their long stay there; that Will
Aikins was dead; that five of the Spaniards were
come away; and that though they had not been
much molested by the savages, yet they had had some
skirmishes with them; that they begged of him to-
write to me, to think of the promise I had made to-
fetch them away, that they might see their own*
country again before they died.
But I was gone a wild-goose chase indeed; and
they who will have any more of me, must be content to
follow me through a new variety of follies, hard-
ships, and wild adventures; wherein the justice of
Providence may be duly observed, and we may see
how easily Heaven can gorge us with our own de-
sires, make the strongest of our wishes to be our af-
fliction, and punish us most severely with those very
things which we think it would be our utmost happi-
ness to be allowed in.
Let no wise man flatter himself with the strength
of his own judgment, as if he was able to chuse any
particular station of life for himself. Man is a short-
sighted creature, fees but a very little.way before
him;
Mm; and as his passions are none of his best friends,
so his particular affections are generally his Worst
counsellors.
I say this with respect to the impetuous defire I
had from a youth, to wander into the world; and
how evident it now was, that this principle was pre-
served in me for my punishment. How it came on,
the manner, the circumstance, and the conclusion
of it, it is easy to give you historically, and with its
utmost variety of particulars. But the secret ends
of Divine Providence, in thus permitting us to be
hurried down the stream of our own defires, are only to
be understood of those who can listen to the voice of
Providence, and draw religious consequences from
God's justice, and their own mistakes.
Be it, had I business, or no business, away I went;
it is no time now to enlarge any sarther upon the
reason or absurdity of my own conduct; but to
come to the history; I was embarked for the voy-
age, and the voyage I went.
I shall only add here, that my honest and truly
pious clergyman left me here; a ship being ready to
go to Lisbon, he asked me leave to go thither; being
still, as he observed, bound never to finish any voyage
he began. How happy had it been for me, if I had
gone with him!
But it was too late now; all things Heaven ap-
points are best: had I gone with him, I had never
had so many things to be thankful for, and you had
never heard of the second part of the Travels and Ad-
ventures of Robinson Crusoe; so I must leave here the
fruitless exclairaingat mysclf,andgoon withmy voyage.
P 3 From
From the Brasih we made directly away over the
Atlantic sea, to the Cape de Bonne Esperance, or, as
we call it, the Cape of Good Hope; and had a tole-
rable good voyage, our course generally south-east;
now and then a storm, and some contrary winds.
But my disasters at sea were at an end; my future
rubs and cross events were to besal me on more; that
it might appear, the land was as well prepared to be
our scourge as the sea, when Heaven, who directs
the circumstances of things, pleases to appoint it to
be so.
Our ship was on a trading voyage, and had a su-
per-cargo on board,, who was to direct all her mo-
tions, after she arrived at the Cape; only being li-
mitted to a certain number of days for stay, by char-
ter-party, at the several ports she was to go to: this
was none of my business, neither did I meddle with
it at all; my nephew, the captain, and the super-
cargo, adjusting all those things between them as
they thought fit.
We made no stay at the Cape, longer than was
needful to take in fresh water, but made the best of
our way for the coast. of Coromandc; we were
indeed informed that a French man of war of
fifty guns, and two large merchant ships, were gone
for the Indies; and, as I knew we were at war with
France, I had some apprehensions of them; but they
went their own way, and we heard no more of
them.
I shall not pester my account, or the reader, with
descriptions of places, journals of our voyages, va-
riations of the compass, latitudes, meridian distances,
trade winds, situation of ports, and the like; such
as
as almost all the histories of long navigation are full
of, and which make the reading tiresome enough;
and are perfectly unprofitable to all that read, ex-
cept only to those who are to go to those places
themselves.
It is enough to name the ports and places which
we touched at; and what occurred to us upon our
pasting from one to another. We touched first at
the island of Madagascar, where, though the peo-
ple are fierce and treacherous, and, in particular,
very well armed with lances and bows, which they
use with inconceivable dexterity, yet we sared very
well with them awhile; they treated us very civilly;
and for some trisles which we gave them, such as
knives, scistars, &c. they brought us eleven good sat
bullocks, middling in size, but very good in flesh;
which we took in, partly for fresh provisions for our
present spending, and the rest to salt for the ship's
use.
We were obliged to stay here for some time, after
we had furnished ourselves with provisions; and I,
that was always too curious to look into every nook
of the world wherever I came, was for going on shore
as often as I could. It was on the east side of the
island that we went on shore one evening; and the
people, who, by the way, are very numerous, came
thronging about us, and stood gazing at us at a dis-
tance; as we had traded freely with them, and had
been kindly used, we thought ourselves in no dan-
ger; but when we saw the people, we cut three
boughs out of a tree, and stuck them up at a distance
from us, which, it seems, is a mark in the country,
not only of truce and friendfliip, but when it is ac*
P 4 cepted,
cepted, the other side set up three poles, or boughs,
also; which is a signal that they accept the truce too;
but then this is a known condition of the truce, that
you are not to pass beyond their three poles towards
them, nor they come past your three poles or boughs
towards you; so that you are perfectly secure within
the three poles; and all the space between your poles
and their's, is allowed like a market, for free con-
verse, traffick, and commerce. When you go thi-
ther, you must not carry your weapons with you;
and if they come into that space, they stick up their
javelins and launces, all at the first poles, and come
on unarmed; but if any violence is offered them,
and the truce thereby broken, away they run to the
poles, and lay hold of their weapons, and then the
truce is at an end.
It happened one evening, when we went on fliore,
that a greater number of their people came down
than usual, but was all very friendly and civil. They
brought with them several kinds of provisions, for
which we satisfied them with such toys as we had;
their women also brought us milk and roots, and
several things very acceptable to us, and all was
quiet; and we made us a little tent, or hut, of some
boughs of trees, and lay on shore all that night.
I know not what was the occasion, but I was not
so well satisfied to lie on shore as the rest; and the
boat lying at an anchor about a stone's cast from the
land, with two men in her to take care of her, I
made one of them come on shore; and getting some
bpughs of trees to cover us also in the boat, I spread
the sail on the bottom of the boat, and lay on board,
2 under
under the covct of the branches of the trees, all
night.
About two o'clock in the morning we heard one of
our men make a terrible noise on the more, calling
out for God's sake to bring the boat in, and come and
help them, for they were all like to be murdered;
at the same time I heard the firing of five musquets,
which was the number of the guns they had, and
that three times over; for, it seems, the natives here
were not so easily frighted with guns as the savages
were in America, where I had to do with them.
All this while I knew not what was the matter;
but rousing immediately from sleep with the noise, I
caused the boat to be thrust in, and resolved, with
three fusils we had on board, to land and assist our
men.
We got the boat soon to the more; but our men
were in too much haste; for, being come to the
shore, they plunged into the water, to get to the
boat with all the expedition they could, being pur-
sued by between three and four hundred men. Our
men were but nine in all, and only five of them had
fusils with them; the rest, indeed, had pistols and
swords, but they were of small use to them.
We took up seven of our men, and with difficulty
enough too, three of them being very ill wounded;
and that which was still worse, was, that while we
stood in the boat to take our men in, we were in as
much danger as they were in on shore; for they
poured their arrows in upon us so thick, that we
were sain to barricade the side of the boat up with
the benches, and two or three soose boards, which,
to
to our great satissaction, we had, by mere accident,
or providence rather, in the boat.
And yet, had it been day-light, they are, it seems,
such exact marksmen, that if they could have seen
but the least part of any of us, they would have
been sure of us: we had, by the light of the moon,
a little sight of them, as they stood pelting us from
the shore with darts and arrows; and, having got
ready our fire-arms, we gave them a volley; and
we could hear by the cries of some of them, that we
had wounded several; however they stood thus in
battle array on the shore till break of day, which
we suppose was, that they might fee the better to
take their aim at us.
In this condition we lay, and could not tell how
to weigh our anchor, or set up our sail, because we
must needs stand up in the boat, and they were as
sure to hit us, as we were to hit a bird in a tree with
small shot: we made signals of distress to the ship,
which though she rode a league off, yet my nephew,
the captain, hearing our firing, and by glasses per-
ceiving the posture we lay in, and that we fired to-
wards the shore, pretty well understood us; and,
weighing anchor with all speed, he stood as near the
shore as he durst with the ship, and then sent another
boat, with ten hands in her, to assist us; but we
called to them not to come too near, telling them
what condition we were in: however, they stood in
nearer to us; and one of the men, taking the end
of a tow-line in his hand, and keeping our boat be-
tween him and the enemy, so that they could not
perfectly fee him, swam on board us, and made the line
sast to the boat; upon which we slipt our little cable,
i and
and leaving our anchor behind, they towed us out
of the reach of the arrows; we all the while lying
close behind the barricade we had made.
As soon as we were got from between the ship and
the shore, that she could lay her side to the shore, we
ran along just by them, and we poured in a broad-
side among them, loaded with pieces of iron and
lead, small bullets, and such stusf, besides the great
fliot, which made a terrible havock among them.
When we were got on board, and out of danger,
we had time to examine into the occasion of this
fray; and, indeed, our supercargo, who had been
often in those parts, put me upon it; for he said he
was sure the inhabitants would not have touched us
after we had made a truce, if we had not done some-
thing to provoke them to it: At length it came out,
'viz. That an old woman, who had come to sell us
some milk, had brought it within our poles, with a
young woman with her, who also brought some
roots or herbs; and while the old woman (whether
she was mother to the young woman or no, they
could not tell) was selling us the milk, one of our
men offered some rudeness to the wench that was
with her; at which the old woman made a great
noise. However, the seaman would not quit his
prize, but carried her out of the old woman's sight,
among the trees, it being almost dark; the old wo-
man went away without her; and, as we suppose,
made an outcry among the people she came from;
who, upon notice, raised this great army upon us in
three or spur hours; and it was great odds but we
had been all destroyed.
One
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
One of our men was killed with a lance that was
thrown at him, just at the beginning of the attack,
as he sallied out of the tent we had made; the rest
came off free, all but the fellow who was the occasion
of all the mischief, who paid dear enough for his
black mistress, for we could not hear what became
of him a great while. We lay upon the more two
days after, though the wind presented, and made sig-
nals for him; made our boat sail up more, and down
more, several leagues, but in vain; so we were
obliged to give him over; and if he alone had suf-
fered for it, the loss had been the less.
I could not satisfy myself, however, without ven-
turing on shore once more, to try if I could learn any
thing of him or them; it was the third night after the
action, that I had a great mind to learn, if I could
by any means, what mischief we had done, and how
the game stood on the Indian side: I was careful to
do it in the dark, lest we should be attacked again;
but I ought indeed to have been sure, that the men
I went with had been under my command, before I
engaged in a thing so hazardous and mischievouS,
as I was brought into it without my knowledge or
defire.
We took twenty stout fellows with us as any in
the ship, besides the supercargo and myself; and we
landed two hours before midnight, at the same place
where the Indians stood drawn up the evening before:
I landed here, because my design, as I have said, was
chiefly to fee if they had quitted the field, and if they
had left any marks behind them, or of the mischief
we had done them; and I thought, if we could sur-
prise
221
prise one or two of them, perhaps we might get our
man again, by way of exchange.
We landed without any noise, and divided our
men into two companies, whereof the boatswain com-
manded one, and I the other: We neither could hear
nor see any body stir when we landed; so we marched
up, one body at a distance from the other, to the
field of battle: At first we could see nothing, it be-
ing very dark; but by and by, our boatswain, that
led the first party, stumbled and fell over a dead bo-
dy: This made them halt there awhile; for knowing
by the circumstances, that they were at the place
where the Indians had stood, they waited for my
coming up: Here we concluded to halt till the moon
began to rife, which we knew would be in less than
an hour; and then we could easily discern the havock
we had made among them: We told two-and-thirty
bodies upon the ground, whereof two were not quite
dead. Some had an arm, and some a leg, shot off;
and one his head: Those that were wounded, we
supposed they had carried away.
When we had made, as I thought, a full discovery
of all we could come at the knowledge of, I was for
going on board again; but the boatswain and his
party often sent me word, that they were resolved to
make a visit to the Indian town, where these dogs,
as they called them, dwelt; and defired me to go
along with them; and if they could find them, as
they still sancied they should, they did not doubt,
they said, getting a good booty; and it might be,
they might find Thomas Jefflrys there: that was the
man's name we had lost.
Had
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
Had they sent to ask my leave to go, I knew well
enough what answer to have given them; for I would
have commanded them instantly on board, knowing
it was not a hazard fit for us to run, who had a
ship, and a ship's loading in our charge, and a voyage
to make, which depended very much upon the lives
of the men; but as they sent me word they were
resolved to go, and only asked me and my com-
pany to go along with them, I positively refused it,
and rose up (for I was sitting on the ground) in or-
der to go to the boat. One or two of the men began
to importune me to go; and, when I still refused
positively, began to grumble, and say they were not
under my command, and they would go. Come,
Jack, says one of the men, will you go with me?
I will go for one. Jack said he would; and ano-
ther followed, and then another; and, in a word,
they all left me but one, whom, with much difficulty
too, I persuaded to stay: so the supercargo and I,
with one man, went back to the boat, where, I told
them, we would stay for them, and take care to take
in as many of them as should be left; for I told
them, it was a mad thing they were going about,
and supposed most of them would run the sate of
Tliomas Jcffrys.
They told me, like seamen, they'd warrant it they
would come off again; and they would take care,
&c. So away they went. I intreated them to con-
sider the ship, and the voyage; that their lives were
not their own; and that they were intrusted with
the voyage, in some measure; that if they miscar-
ried, the ship might be lost for want of their help;
and
and that they could not answer it to God and man.
I said a great deal more to them on that head, but I
might as well have talked to the main-mast of the
ship; they were mad upon their journey; only they
gave me good words, and begged I would not be
angry; said they would be very cautious, and they
did not doubt but they would be back again in
about an hour, at sarthest; for the Indian town, they
said, was not above half a mile off; though they
found it above two miles before they got to it.
Well, they all went away, as above; and though
the attempt was desperate, and such as none but mad-
men would have gone about, yet, to give them their
due, they went about it warily, as well as boldly.
They were gallantly armed, that is true; for they
had every man a fufil or musquet, a bayonet, and
every man a pistol; some of them had broad cut-
lasses, some of them hangers; and the boatswain,
and two more, had pole-axes: besides all which, they
had among them thirteen hand-grenadoes. Bolder
fellows, and better provided, never went about any
wicked work in the world.
When they went out, their chief design was
plunder; and they were in mighty hopes of finding
gold there; but a circumstance, which none of them
were aware of, set them on fire with revenge, and
made devils of them all: When they came to the
few Indian houses, which they thought had been the
town, which were not above half a mile off, they
were under a great disappointment; for there were
not above twelve or thirteen houses; and where the
town was, or how big, they knew not: They con-
sulted
suited therefore what to do, and were some time be-
fore they could resolve: for if they fell upon these,
they must cut all their throats; and it was ten to
one but some of them might escape, it being in the
night, though the moon was up; and if one escaped,
he would run away, and raise all the town, so they
should have a whole army upon them. Again, on
the other hand, if they went away, and left those
untouched (for the people were all afleep) they could
not tell which way to look for the town.
However, the last was the best advice; so they re-
solved to leave those houses, and look for the town as
well as they could : They went on a little way, and
found a cow tied to a tree: this they presently con-
cluded would be a good guide to them; for they
said the cow certainly belonged to the town before
them, or the town behind them; and if they untied
her, they should see which way she went: if she went
back, they had nothing to say to her; but if she
went forward, they had nothing to do but to fol-
low her; so they cut the cord, which was made of
twisted flags, and the cow went on before them: In
a word, the cow led them directly to the town, which,
as they reported, consisted of above 200 houses, or
huts; and in some of these they found several sa-
milies living together.
Here they found all silent ; as profoundly secure,
as sleep and a country that had never seen an enemy
of that kind, could make them. Upon this they
called another council, to consider what they had to
do; and, in a word, they resolved to divide them-
selves into three bodies, and to set three houses on
fire
fire In three parts of the town; and as the men came
out, to seize them, and bind them; if any resisted,
they need not be asked what to do then; and so to
search the rest of the houses for plunder; but re-
solved to march silently first through the town, and
see what dimensions it was of, and consider if they
might venture upon it, or no.
They did so, and desperately resolved that they
would venture upon them; but while they were ani-
mating one another to the work, three of them, that
were a little before the rest, called out aloud, and
told them they had found Thomas Jeff'rys; they all
ran up to the place, and so it was indeed, for there
they found the poor fellow, hanged up naked by one
arm, and his throat cut: There was an bidian house
just by the tree, where they found sixteen or seven-
teen of the principal Indians, who had been con-
cerned in the fray with us before, and two or three
of them wounded with our shot; and our men found
they were awake, and talking one to another in that
house, but knew not their number.
The sight of their poor mangled comrade so en-
raged them, as before, that they swore to one ano-
ther they would be revenged, and that not an Indian
who came into their hands mould have quarter; and
to work they went immediately; and yet not so madly
as by the rage and fury they were in might be expected.
Their first care was to get something that would soon
take fire; but after a little search, they found that
would be to no purpose, for most of the houses were
low, and thatched with flags or rushes, of which the
country is full; so they presently made some wild
Vol. II. Q„ fire,
sire, as we call it, by wetting a little powder in thai
palms of their hands; and, in a quarter of an hour,
they set the town on fire in four or five places; and
particularly that house where the Indians were not
gone to bed. As soon as the fire began to blaze,
the poor frighted creatures began to rush out to save
their lives; but met with their sate in the attempt,
and especially at the door, where they drove them
back, the boatswain himself killing one or two with
his pole-axe; the house being large, and many in it,
he did not care to go in, but called for an hand gre-
nado, and threw it among them, which, at first,
frighted them; but when it burst, made such havock
among them, that they cried out in a hideous
manner.
In short, most of the Indians who were in the open
part of the house, were killed or hurt with the gre-
nado, except two or three more, who pressed to the
door, which the boatswain and two more kept with
the bayonets in the muzzles of their pieces, and dis-
patched all who came that way. But there was ano-
ther apartment in the house, where the prince, or
king, or whatsoever he was, and several others, were;.
and they kept in, till the house, which was by this.
time all of a light slame, fell in upon them, and they
were smothered, or burnt together.
All this while they fired not a gun, because they
would not waken the people saster than they could
master them; but the fire began to waken them
sast enough, and our fellows were glad to keep a
little together in bodies; for the fire grew so raging,
all the houses being made of light combustible stuff,
that they could hardly bear the street between them;
and
227
and their business was to follow the fire for the surer
execution: As sast as the fire either forced the peo-
ple out of those houses which were burning, or
frighted them out of others, our people were ready
at their doors to knock them on the head, still calling
and hallooing to one another to remember Thomas
Jeffrys.
While this was doing, I must confess I was very
uneasy, and especially, when I saw the flames of the
town, which, it being night, seemed to be just by
me.
My nephew, the captain, who was roused by his
men too, seeing such a fire, was very uneasy, not
knowing what the matter was, or what danger I
was in; especially hearing the guns too; for by this
time they began to use their fire-arms: A thousand
OF ROBINSON CRUSOE.
supercargo, what should become of us: and at last,
though he could ill spare any more men, yet, not
knowing what exigence we might be in, he takes
another boat, and with thirteen men and himself
comes on shore to me.
He was surprised to see me and the supercargo in
the boat, with no more than two men, for one had
been left to keep the boat; and though he was glad
that we were well; yet he was in the same impa-
tience with us to know what was doing; for the noise
continued, and the flame increased: I confess it was
next to an impossibility for any men in the world to
restrain their curiosity of knowing what had happen-
ed, or their concern for the safety of the men. In a
word, the captain told me, he would go and help his
men,
men, let what would come. I argued with him, as
I did before with the men, the safety of the ship, and
the danger of the voyage, the interest of the owners
and merchants, &c. and told him I would go, and the
two men, and only fee if we could, at a distance,
learn what was like to be the event, and come back
and tell him.
It was all one to talk to my nephew, as it was to
talk to the rest before; he would go, he said, and
he only*wished he had left but ten men in the ship;
for he could not think of having his men lost for
want of help: he had rather, he said, lose the ship,
the voyage, and his life, and all: And so away
went he.
Nor was I any more able to stay behind now, than
I was to persuade them not to go before; so, in
short, the captain ordered two men to row back the
pinnace, and fetch twelve men more from the ship,
leaving the long-boat at an anchor; and that when
they came back, six men should keep the two boats,
and six more come after us; so that he left only six-
teen men in the ship; for the whole ship's company
consisted of 65 men, whereof two were lost in the first
quarrel which brought this mischief on.
Being now on the march, you may be sure we
felt little of the ground we trod on; and being
guided by the fire, we kept no path, but went di-
rectly to the place of the flame. If the noise of the
guns were surprising to us before, the cries of the poor
people were now quite of another nature, and fill .d us
with horror. I must confess I never was at the sacking
of a city, or at the taking of a town by storm; I have
heard
heard of Oliver Cromwell taking Drogheda, in Ireland,
and killing man, woman, and child; and I had read of
Count Tilly sacking the city of Magdcbourg, and
cutting the throats of 22000 of both sexes; but I
never had an idea of the thing itself before; nor is
it possible to describe it, or the horror which was up-
on our minds at hearing it.
However we went on, and, at length, came to the
town, though there was no entering the streets of it
for the fire. The first object we met with was the
ruins of a hut or house, or rather the ashes of it,
for the house was consumed; and just before it,
plain now to be seen by the light of the fire, lay four
men and three women killed; and, as we thought,
one or two more lay in the heap among the fire. In
short, these were such instances of a rage altogether
barbarous, and of a fury something beyond what
was human, that we thought it impossible our men
could be guilty of it; or, if they were the authors
of it, we thought that every one of them ought to
be put to the worst of deaths: But this was not all;
we saw the fire increased forward, and the cry went
on just as the fire went on, so that we were in the
utmost confusion. We advanced a little way sar-
ther; and beheld, to our astonishment, three women
naked, crying in a most dreadful manner, and flying
as if they had, indeed, had wings, and after them
sixteen or seventeen men, natives, in the same terror
and consternation, with three of our English butchers
(for I can call them no better) in the rear; who,
when they could not overtake them, fired in among
them, and one that was killed by their shot, fell
down in our sight; when the rest saw us, believing
us to be their enemies, and that we would murder
them, as well as those that pursued them, they set
up a most dreadful shriek, especially the women;
and two of them fell down as if already dead with
the fright.
My very soul shrunk within me, and my blood
ran chill in my veins when I saw this; and I believe,
had the three English sailors that pursued them come
on, I had made our men kill them all. However,
we took some ways to let the poor flying creatures
know that'-we would not hurt them; and immedi-
ately they came up to us, and kneeling down, with
their hands lifted up, made piteous lamentations to
us to save them, which we let them know we would
do; whereupon they kept all together in a huddle,
close behind us, for protection. u I left my men drawn
up together, and charged them to hurt nobody, but,
if poflible, to get at some of our people, and fee.
what devil it was possessed them, and what they in-
tended to do; and, in a word, to command them
off; assuring them, that if they staid till day-light,
they would have a hundred thousand men about their,
ears; I say, I left them, and went among those fly-
ing people, taking only two of our men with me:
and there was, indeed, a piteous spectacle among
them: Some of them had their feet terribly burnt
with trampling and running through the fire; others
their hands burnt; one of the women had sallen
down in the fire, and was almost burnt to death be-
fore she could get out again; two or three of the
men had cuts in their backs and thighs, from our
men pursuing; and another was shot through the
body, arid died while I was there.
I would.
I would fain have learned what the occasion of all
this was, but I could not understand one word they
said, though by signs I perceived that some of them
knew not what was the occasion themselves. I was
so terrified in my thoughts at this outrageous attempt,
that I could not stay there, but went back to my
own men: I told them my resolution, and command-
ed them to follow me, when in the very moment
came four of our men, with the boatswain at their
head, running over the heaps of bodies they had
killed, all covered with blood and dust, as if they
wanted more people to massacre; when our men
hallooed to them as loud as they could halloo; and,
with much ado, one of them made them hear;
so that they knew who we were, and came up to
,us.
As soon as the boatswain saw us, he set up a hal-
loo, like a shout of triumph, for having, as he
thought, more help come; and without bearing to
hear me, Captain, says he, noble captain, I am glad
you are come; we have not half done yet: Vil-
lains! hell-hound dogs! I will kill as many of them
as poor Tom has hairs upon his head. We have
sworn to spare none of them; we will root out the
very name of them from the earth: and thus he ran
on, out of breath too with action, and would not
give us leave to speak a word.
At last, raising my voice that I might silence him
a little: Barbarous dog! said I, what are you doing?
I won't have one creature touched more, upon pain
of death. I charge you, upon your life, to stop
your hands, and stand still here, or you are a dead
wan this minute.
(^4 Why,
Why, Sir, says he, do you know what you do,
or what they have done? If you want a reason for
what we have done, come hither; and with that he
shewed me the poor fellow hanging upon a tree, with
his throat cut.
I confess I was urged then myself, and at ano-
ther time should have been forward enough; but I
thought they had carried their rage too sar, and
thought of Jacob's words to his sons Simeon and Lew",
"Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce ; and their
"wrath, for it was cruel." But I had now a new
task upon my hands; for when the men I carried
with me saw the sight, as I had done, I had as much
to do to restrain them, as I should have had with the
others; nay, my nephew himself fell in with them,
and told me, in their hearing, that he was only con-
cerned for fear of the men being overpowered; for,
as to the people, he thought not one of them ought
to live; for they had all glutted themselves with the
murder of the poor man, and that they ought to be
used like murderers: upon these words, away ran
eight of my men with the boatswain and his crew,
to complete their bloody work: and I, seeing it quite
out of my power to restrain them, came away pen-
sive and sad; for I could not bear the sight, much
less the horrible noise and cries of the poor wretches
that fell into their hands. 1
I got nobody to come back with me but the super-
cargo and two men, and with these I walked back to
the boats. It was a very great piece of folly in me,
I confess, to venture back as it were alone; for as
it began now to be almost day, and the alarm had
run over the country, there stood about forty men,
4 armed
armed with lances and bows, at the little place where
the twelve or thirteen houses stood, mentioned be-
fore; but by accident I missed the place, and came
directly to the sea-side; and by that time I got to
the sea-side, it was broad day: immediately I took
the pinnace, and went aboard, and sent her back to
assist the men in what might happen.
I observed, that about the time I came to the boat-
side, the fire was pretty well out, and the noise abated;
but in about half an hour after I got on board, I
heard a volley of our men's fire arms, and saw a
great smoke; this, as I understood afterwards, was
our men salling upon the forty men, who, as I said,
stood at the few houses on the way; of whom they
killed sixteen or seventeen, and set all those houses
on fire, but did not meddle with the women or
children.
By that time the men got to the sttore again with
the pinnace, our men began to appear; they came
dropping in, some and some; not in two bodies, and
in form, as they went out, but all in heaps, straggling
here and there in such manner, that a small force
of resolute men might have cut them all off.
But the dread of them was upon the whole coun-
try: The people were amazed and surprised, and so
frighted, that, I believe, an hundred of them would
have fled at the sight of but five of our men. Nor
in all this terrible action* was there a man who made
any considerable defence; they were so surprized be-
tween the terror of the fire, and the sudden attack
of our men in the dark, that they knew not which
way to turn themselves; for if they fled one way,
they were met by one party; if back again, by ano-
ther;
ther; so that they were every where knocked down*
Nor did any of our men receive the least hurt, ex-
cept one who strained his foot, and another had one
of his hands very much burnt.
I was very angry with my nephew, the captain,
and, indeed, with all the men, in my mind, but with
him in particular; as well for his acting so out of
his duty, as commander of the ship, and having the
charge of the voyage upon him, as in his prompting,
rather than cooling, the rage of his men, in so bloody
and cruel an enterprise: My nephew answered me
very respectfully; but told me that when he saw the
body of the poor seaman, whom they had murdered in
such a cruel and barbarous manner, he was not master
of himself, neither could he govern his passion; he
owned, he should not have done so, as he was comman-
der of the ship; but, as he was a man, and nature moved
him, he could not bear it. As for the rest of the
men, they were not subject to me at all; and they
knew it well enough, so they took no notice of my
dislike.
The next day we set sail; so we never heard any
more of it. Our men differed in the account of the
number they killed; some said one thing, some
another: But, according to the best of their ac-
counts put all together, they killed, or destroyed,
about 150 people, men, women, and children, and
left not a house standing in the town.
As for the poor fellow Thomas "Jeffrys, as he was
quite dead, for his throat was so cut that his head
was half off, it would do him no service to bring
him away; so they left him where they found him^
only
only took him down from the tree where he was
hanged by one hand.
However just our men thought this action to be, I
was against them in it; and I always, after that time,
told them God would blast the voyage; for I looked
upon the blood they shed that night to be murder in
them: for though it is true that they killed Thomas
jeffrys, yet it was as true that Jeffrys was the aggressor,
had broken the truce, and had violated or debauched
a young woman of their's, who came to our camp
innocently, and on the saith of their capitulation.
The boatswain defended this quarrel when we were
afterwards on board. He said, it was true that we
seemed to break the truce, but really had not; and
that the war was begun the night before by the na-
tives themselves, who had mot at us, and killed one
of our men without any just provocation -r so that,
as we were in a capacity to fight them, we might also .
be in a capacity to do ourselves justice upon them in
an extraordinary manner; that though the poor
man had taken liberty with a wench, he ought not to
have been murdered, and that in such a villainous
manner; and that they did nothing but what was
just, and that the laws of God allowed to be done to
murderers.
One would think this should have been enough
to have warned us against going on more among
heathens and barbarians; but it is impossible to
make mankind wife, but at their own experience;
and their experience seems to be always of most use
to them, when it is dearest bought.
We were now bound to the gulph of Persia, and
from thence to the coast of Coromandcl, only to touch
at
at Swat; but the chief of the supercargo's design
lay at the bay of Bengal, where, if he missed of the
business outward-bound, he was to go up to China,
and return to the coast as he came home.
The first disaster that befel us was in the gulph of
Persia, where five of our men, venturing on shore on
the Arabian side of the gulph, were surrounded by
the Arabs, and either all killed, or carried away into
slavery; the rest of the boat's crew were not able to
rescue them, and had but just time to get off their
boat: I began to upbraid them with the just retribu-
tion of Heaven in this case; but the boatswain very
warmly told me, he thought I went sarther in my
censures than I could shew any warrant for in scrip-
ture, and referred to the thirteenth of St. Luke, ver. 4.
where our Saviour intimates, that those men, on
whom the Tower of Siloam fell, were not sinners
above all the Galileans; but that which, indeed, put
me to silence in this case, was, that none of these
five men, who were now lost, were of the number of
those who went on shore to the massacre of Madagas-
car (so I always called it, though our men could not
bear the word massacre with any patience): and, in-
deed, this last circumstance, as I have said, put me
to silence for the present.
But my frequent preaching to them on this subject:
had worse consequences than I expected; and the
boatswain, who had been the head of the attempt,
came up boldly to me one time, and told me, he
found that I continually brought that affair upon the
stage} that I made unjust reflections upon it, and had
used
237
used the men very ill on that account, and himself in
particular; that as I was but a passenger, and had no
command in the ship, or concern in the voyage, they
were not obliged to bear it; that they did not know
but I might have some ill design in my head, and,
perhaps, call them to an account for it, when they
came to England; and that therefore, unless I would
resolve to have done with it, and also not to concern
myself farther with him, or any of his affairs, he
would leave the ship; for he did not think it was safe
to sail with me among them.
I heard him patiently enough till he had done, and
then told him, that I did confess I had all along op-
posed the massacre of Madagascar, for such I would
always call it; and that I had on all occasions spoken
my mind freely about it, though not more upon him
than any of the rest; that as to my having no com-
mand in the ship, that was true, nor did I exercise
any authority, only took the liberty of speaking my
mind in things which publickly concerned us all; as
to what concern I had in the voyage, that was none
of his business; I was a considerable owner of the
sliip, and in that claim I conceived I had a right to
speak, even sarther than I had yet done, and would
not be accountable to him, or any one else; and be-
gan to be a little warm with him: he made but little
reply to me at that time, and I thought that affair had
been over. We were at this time in the road to Ben-
gal; and, being willing to fee the place, I went on
shore with the supercargo, in the ship's boat, to di-
vert myself; and towards evening was preparing to
go on board, when one of the men came to me, and
told
told me, he would not have me trouble myself to
come down to the boat, for they had orders not to
carry me on board. Any one may guess what a sur-
prise I was in at so insolent a message; and I asked the
man, who bade him deliver that errand to me? Ho
told me the cockswain. I said no more to the fel-
low, but bid him let them know he had delivered
his message, and that I had given him no answer
to it.
I immediately went, and found out the supercargo,
and told him the story, adding, what I presently fore-
saw, viz. that there would certainly be a mutiny in
the ship; and intreated him to go immediately on
board the ship in an Indian boat, and acquaint the
captain of it: but I might have spared this intelli-
gence, for, before I had spoken to him on shore, the
matter was effected on board: the boatswain, the
gunner, the carpenter, and in a word, all the inferior
officers, as soon as I was gone off in the boat, came
up to the quarter-deck, and defired to speak with the
captain; and there the boatswain, making a long
harangue (for the fellow talked very well), and re-
peating all he had said to me, told the captain in a
few words, that as I was now gone peaceably on
shore, they were loth to use any violence with me;
which, if I had not gone on shore, they would other-
wise have done, to oblige me to have gone. They
therefore thought fit to tell him, that as they shipped
themselves to serve in the ship under his command,
they would perform it saithfully: but if I would not
quit the ship, or the captain oblige me to quit .it, they
would all leave the ship, and sail no sarther with him:
and at that word ALL, he turned his sace about
towards
towards the main-mast, which was, it seems, the sig-
nal agreed on between them; at which all the sea-
men being got together, they cried out, One and
ALL, One and ALL!
My nephew* the captain, was a man of spirit, and
of great presence of mind, and though he was sur-
prised, you may be sure, at the thing, yet he told
them calmly he would consider of the matter; but
that he could do nothing in it till he had spoken to
me about it: he used some arguments with them, to
shew them the unreasonableness and injustice of the
thing; but it was all in vain; they swore, and shook
hands round, before his face, that they would go all
on shore, unless he would engage to them not to suffer
me to come on board the ship.
This was an hard article upon him, who knew his
obligation to me, and did not know how I might
take it; so he began to talk cavalierly to them;
told them that I was a very considerable owner of the
strip, and that in justice he could not put me out of
my own house; that this was next door to serving
me as the samous pirate Kid had done, who made
the mutiny in the ship, set the captain on shore in an
uninhabited island, and ran away with the ship ; that
let them go into what ship they would, if ever they
came to Englandagain, it would cost them dear; that
the ship was mine, and that he would not put me out
of it; and that he would rather lose the ship, and
the voyage too, than disoblige me so much; so they
might do as they pleased. However, he would go on
fliore, and talk with me there; and invited the boat-
swain to go with him, and perhaps they might ac-
commodate the matter with me.
2 But
But they all rejected the proposal; and said, they
would have nothing to do with me any more, neither
onboard, or on shore; and if I came on board, they
would go on shore. Well, said the captain, if you
are all of this mind, let me go on more, and talk with
him : so away he came to me with this account, a
little after the message had been brought to me from
the cockswain.
I was very glad to fee my nephew, I must confess;
for I was not without apprehensions that they would
confine him by violence, set sail, and run away with
the ship; and then I had been stript naked, in a remote
country, and nothing to help myself: in short, I had
been in a worse case than when I was all alone in the
island.
But they had not come to that length, it seems, to
my great satissaction; and when my nephew told me
what they had said to him, and how they had sworn,
and shook hands, that they would one and all leave
the ship, if I was suffered to come on board, I told
him, he mould not be concerned at it at all, for I
would ltay on more: I only desired he would take
care and send me all my necessary things on shore,
and leave me a sufficient sum of money, and I would
find my way to England as well as I could.
This was a heavy piece of news to my nephew; but
there was no way to help it, but to comply with it.
So in short, he went on board the ship again, and sa-
tisfied the men, that his uncle had yielded to their
importunity, and had sent for his goods from on
board the ship. So the matter was over in a very few
hours : the men returned to their duty, and I begun,
to consider what course I mould steer.
I was
I was now alone in the remotest part of the world,
as I think I may call it; for I was near three thou-
sand leagues, by sea, sarther off from England than
I was at my island; only, it is true, I might travel
here by land, over the Great Mogul's country to
Surat, might go from thence to Bassora by sea, up
the gulph of Persia, and from thence might take the
way of the caravans, over the deserts of Arabia to
Aleppo and Scanderoon ; and from thence by sea again
to Italy, and so over land into France; and this, put
together, might be, at least, a full diameter of the
globe ; but, if it were to be measured, I suppose it
would appear to be a great deal more.
I had another way before me, which was to wait
for some English ships, which were coming to Bengal,
from Achin, on the island of Sumatra, and get pas-
sage on board them for England: but as I came
hither without any concern with the English East-
India Company, so it would be difficult to go from
hence without their licence, unless with great savour
of the captains of the ships, or of the company's sac-
tors; and to both I was an utter stranger.
Here I had the particular pleasure, speaking by
contrarieties, to fee the ship set sail without me; a
treatment, I think, a man in my circumstances scarce
ever met with, except from pirates running away with
a ship, and setting those that would not agree with
their villainy on shore: indeed, this was the next
door to it, both ways. However, my nephew left
me two servants, or rather, one companion, and one
servant: the first was clerk to the purser, whom he
engaged to go with me; and the other was his own
servant. I took me also a good lodging in the house
Vol. II. R of
of an Englis}j woman, where several merchants lodged,
some French, two Italians, or rather Jews, and one
Englishman. Here I was handsomely enough enter-
tained; and, that I might not be said to run rashly
upon any thing, I stayed here above nine months,
considering what course to take, and how to manage
myself. I had some Englis}j goods with me of value,
and a considerable sum of money; my nephew fur-
nishing me with a thousand pieces of eight, and a
letter of credit for more, if I had occasion, that I
might not be straitened, whatever might happen.
I quickly disposed of my goods, and to advan-
tage too; and, as I originally intended, I bought
here some very good diamonds, which, of all other
things, was the most proper for me, in my circum-
stances, because I might always carry my whole estate
about me.
After a long stay here, and many proposals made
for my return to England, but none salling to my
mind, the Engli/h merchant, who lodged with me,
and with whom 1 had contracted an intimate ac-
quaintance, came to me one morning: Country,
man, says he, I have a project to communicate to you,
which, as it suits with my thoughts, may, for aught
I know, suit with your's also, when you mail have
thoroughly considered it.
Here we are posted, says he, you by accident, and
I by my own choice, in a part of the world very re.
mote from our own country ; but it is in a country
where, by us who understand trade and business, a
great deal of money is to be got: if you will put a
thousand pounds to my thousand pounds, we will
hire a ship here, the first we can get to our minds,
you
you shall be captain, I'll be merchant, and we
will go a trading voyage to China : for what should
we stand still for? The whole world is in motion,
rolling round and round; all the creatures of God,
heavenly bodies and earthly, are busy and dili.
gent: why should we be idle? There are no drones,
says he, living in the world but men: why ihould
we be of that number?
I liked this proposal very well; and the more, be-
cause it seemed to be expressed with so much good
will, and in so friendly a manner. I will not say,
but that I might, by my loose and unhinged cir-
cumstances, be the sitter to embrace a proposal for
trade, and, indeed, for any thing else; or other-
wise, trade was none of my element: however, I
might, perhaps, say, with some truth, that if trade
was not my element, rambling was; and no propo-
sal for seeing any part of the world, which I had
never seen before, could possibly come amiss to
me.
It was, however, some time before we could get a
ship to our mind; and when we got a vessel, it was
not easy to get English sailors; that is to say, so many
as were necessary to govern the voyage, and manage
the sailors which we should pick up there. After
some time we got a mate, a boatswain, and a gunner,
English; a Dutch carpenter, and three Portuguese^
foremast men; with these, we found we could do
well enough, having Indian seamen, such as they are,
to make up.
There are so many travellers who have written the
history of their voyages and travels this way, that it
would be but very little diversion to any body, to
R 2 give
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
give a long account of the places we went to, and the
people who inhabit there: those things I leave to
others, and refer the reader to those journals and
travels of Englishmen, many of which, I find, are
published, and more promised every day. It is
enough for me to tell you, that we made the voyage
to Acbin, in the island of Sumatra, first; and from
thence to Siam, where we exchanged some of our
wares for opium, and for some arrack; the first, a
commodity which bears a great price among the
Chinese, and which, at that time, was very much
wanted there : in a word, we went up to Susham;
made a very great voyage ; were eight months out;
and returned to Bengal: and I was very well satisfied
with my adventure. I observe, that our people in
England, often admire how the osficers, which the
Company fend into India, and the merchants which
generally stay there, get such very good estates as
they do, and sometimes come home worth sixty,
seventy, and an hundred thousand pounds at a
time.
But it is no wonder, or, at least, we shall fee so
much sarther into it, when we consider the innume-
rable ports and places where they have a free com-
merce, that it will then be no wonder; and much less
will it be so, when we consider, that all those places and
ports where the English ships come, there is so much,
and such constant demand for the growth of all other
countries, that there is a certain vent for the re-
turn, as well as a market abroad for the goods car-
ried out.
In short, we made a very good voyage, and I got
so much money by the first adventure, and such an
insight
245
insight into the method of getting more, that, had I
been twenty years younger, I should have been
tempted to have stayed here, and sought no sarther
for making my fortune: but what was all this to a
man on the wrong side of threescore, that was rich
enough, and came abroad more in obedience to a
restless defire of seeing the world, than a covetous
defire of getting in it? And, indeed, I think, it is
with great justice that I now call it a restless defire;
for it was so: when I was at home, I was restless to
go abroad; and now I was abroad, I was restless to
be at home. I say, what was this gain to me? I
was rich enough already; nor had I any uneasy de-
fires about getting more money; and therefore, the
profits of the voyage to me, were things of no great
force to me, for the prompting me forward to sar-
ther undertakings: hence I thought, that by this
voyage I had made no progress at all ; because I was
come back, as I might call it, to the place from
whence I came, as to an home; whereas my eye,
which, like that which Solomon speaks of, was
never satisfied with seeing, was still more defirous of
wandering and seeing. I was come into a part of the
world which I never was in before; and that part in
particular, which I had heard much of; and was
resolved to see as much of it as I could; and then I
thought, I might say, I had seen all the world that
was worth seeing.
But my fellow-traveller and I had different notions:
I do not name this to insist upon my own, for I ac-
knowledge his was most just, and the most suited to
the end of a merchant's life; who, when he is
R 3 abroad
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
abroad upon adventures, it is his wisdom to stick to
that, as the best thing for him, which he is like to
get the most money by. My new friend kept himself
to the nature of the thing, and would have been con-
tent to have gone, like a carrier's horse, always to
the same inn, backward and forward, provided he
could, as he called it, find his account in it : on the
other hand, mine, as old as I was, was the notion of
a mad rambling boy, that never cares to fee a thing
twice over.
But this was not all : I had a kind of impatience
upon me to be nearer home, and yet the most un-
settled resolution imaginable, which way to go. In
the interval of these consultations, my friend, who
was always upon the search for business, proposed
another voyage to me, viz. among the Spice-Iflands;
and to bring home a load of cloves from the Manillas,
or thereabouts ; places where, indeed, the Dutch do
trade, but the islands belong partly to the Spaniards .
though we went not so sar, but to some other, where
they have not the whole power as they have at Bata-
.via, Ceylon, &c. We were not long in preparing for
this voyage; the chief disficulty was in bringing me
to come into it; however, at last, nothing else offering,
and finding that really stirring about and trading, the
profit being so great, and, as I may say, certain,
had more pleasure in it, and more satissaction to the •
mind, than sitting still; which, to me especially,
was the unhappiest part of life, I resolved on this
voyage too: which we made very successfully, touch-
ing at Borneo, and several iflands, whose names I do
not remember, and came home in about five months.
We fold our spice, which was chiefly cloves, and
4 some
247
some nutmegs, to the Persian merchants, who car-
ried them away for the Gulph; and, making near five
of one, we really got a great deal of money.
My friend, when we made up this account, smiled
at me: Well now, said he, with a sort of an agreeable
insult upon my indolent temper, is not this better
than walking about here, like a man of nothing to
do, and spending our time in staring at the nonsense
and ignorance of the Pagans? "Why truly, said I,
my friend, I think it is; and I begin to be a convert
to rhe principles of merchandizing. But I must tell
you, said I, by the way, you do not know what I
am doing; for if once I conquer my backwardness,
and embark heartily, as old as I am, I shall harrass
you up and down the world till I tire you; for
I shall pursue it so eagerly, I shall never let you
lie still.
But to be short with my speculations: a little while
after this, there came in a Dutch ship from Batavia;
she was a coaster, not an European trader, and of
about two hundred tons burden: the men, as they
pretended, having been so sickly, that the captain
had not men enough to go to sea with, he lay by at
Bengal; and, as if having got money enough, or
being willing, for other reasons, to go for Europe^
he gave public notice, that he would fell his ship:
this came to my ears before my new partner heard of
it; and I had a great mind to buy it. So I went
home to him, and told him of it: he considered
awhile, for he was no rash man neither; but musing
some time, he replied, She is a little too big; but,
however, we will have her. Accordingly we bought
the ship y and, agreeing with the master, we paid
R 4 for
for her, and took possession; when we had done so,
we resolved to entertain the men, if we could, to
join them with those we had, for the pursuing our
business; but on a sudden, they not having received
their wages, but their share of the money, as we af-
terwards learnt, not one of them was to be found.
We enquired much about them, and at length were
told, that they were all gone together, by land, to
Agra, the great city of the Mogul's residence; and
from thence were to travel to Surat, and so by sea to
the gulph of Persia.
Nothing had so heartily troubled me a good while,
as that I missed the opportunity of going with them;
for such a ramble, I thought, and in such company
as would both have guarded me, and diverted me,
would have suited mightily with my great design;
and I should both have seen the world, and gone
homewards too; but I was much better satisfied a
few days after, when I came to know what fort of
fellows they were; for, in short, their history was,
that this man they called captain was the gunner only,
not the commander; that they had been a trading
voyage, in which they were attacked on shore by
some of the Malaccans, who had killed the captain
and three of his men; and that after the captain
was killed, these men, eleven in number, had re-
solved to run away with the {hip, which they did;
and had brought her in at the hay of Bengal, leav-
ing the mate and five men more on fliore; of whom
we mall hear sarther.
Well; let them come by the ship how they would,
we came honestly by her, as we thought; though
we did not, I confess, examine into things so ex-
actly
249
actly as we ought; for we never enquired any
thing of the seamen, who, if we had examined,
would certainly have saultered in their accounts,
contradicted one another, and perhaps have contra-
dicted themselves; or, one how or other, we
should have seen reason to have suspected them: but
the man shewed us a bill of sale for the ship, to one
Emanuel Clostershoven, or some such name (for I sup-
pose it was all a forgery) and called himself by that
name; and we could not contradict him; and being
withal a little too unwary, or at least, having no
suspicion of the thing, we went through with our
bargain.
However we picked up some Engliflj seamen here
after this, and some Dutch; and we now resolved
fora second voyage to the south-east, for cloves, &c»
that is to say, among the Philippine and Malacca
ifles; and, in short, not to fill this part of my story
with trifles, when what is yet to come is so remark-
able, I spent, from first to last, six years in this coun-
try, trading from port to port, backward and for-
ward, and with very good success; and was
now the last year with my partner, going in the
ship above-mentioned, on a voyage to China; but
designing first to go to Siam, to buy rice.
In this voyage, being by contrary winds obliged
to beat up and down a great while in the straits of
Malacca, and among the islands, we were no sooner
got clear of those disficult seas, but we found our
ship had sprung a leak,'and we were not able, by all
our industry, to find out where it was. This forced
us to make for some port; and my partner, who
knew the country better than I did, directed the
captain to put into the river of Cambodia; for I
had
had made the English mate, one Mr. Thompson, cap-
tain, not being willing to take the charge of the
ihip upon myself: This river lies on the north fide
of the great bay or gulph, which goes up to Siam.
While we were here, and going often on shore
for refreshment, there comes to me one day an Eng-
lislman, and he was, it seems, a gunner's mate on
board an English Eqsl India ship, which rode in the
same river, up at, or near the city of Cambodia:
what brought him hither we knew not; but he comes
up to me, and, speaking Etiglistj, Sir, says he, you
are a stranger to me, and I to you; but I have
something to tell you, that very nearly concerns
you.
I looked stedsastly at him a good while, and he
thought at first I had known him, but I did not: If
it very nearly concerns me, said I, and not your-
self, what moves you to tell it me? I am moved,
says he, by the imminent danger you are in; and for
aught I fee, you have no knowledge of it. I know
no danger I am in, said I, but that my ship is leaky,
and I cannot find it out; but I propose to lay her
aground to-morrow, to see if I can find it. But, Sir,
says he, leaky or not leaky, find it or not find it,
you will be wiser than to lay your ship on shore
to-morrow, when you hear what I have to say to you:
Do you know, Sir, said he, the town of Cambodia
lies about fifteen leagues up this river? And there
are two large English ships about five leagues on this
fide, and three Dutch. Well said I, and what is
that to me? Why, Sir, says he, is it for a man that
is upon such adventures as you are, to come into a
port,' and not examine first what ships there are there,
and whether he is able to deal with them? I suppose
you do not think you are a match for them? I was
amused very much at his discourse, but not amazed
at it; for I could not conceive what he meant; and
I turned short upon him, and said, Sir, I wish you
would explain yourself; I cannot imagine what rea-
son I have to be afraid of any of the Company's
ships, or Dutch ships; I am no interloper; what can
they have to say to me?
He looked like a man half angry, half pleased;
and, pausing awhile, but smiling, Well, Sir, says
he, if you think yourself secure, you must take your
chance; I am sorry your sate should blind you against
good advice; but assure yourself, if you do not put
to sea immediately, you will the very next tide be
attacked by five long-boats full of men; and, per-
haps if you are taken, you will be hanged for a pi-
rate, and the particulars be examined into after-
wards: I thought, Sir, added he, I mould have
met with a better reception than this, for doing you
a piece of service of such importance. I can never
be ungrateful, said I, for any service, or to any man
that offers me any kindness; but it is past my com-
prehension, said I, what they mould have such a de-
sign upon me for: However, since you say there is
no time to be lost, and that there is some villainous
design in hand against me, I will go on board this
minute, and put to sea immediately,' if my men can
stop the leak, or if we can swim without stopping it:
But, Sir, said I, shall I go away ignorant of the rea-
son of all this? Can you give me no sarther light
into it?
I can
I can tell you but part of the story, Sir, says he ; but
I have a Dutch seaman here with me, and, I believe,
I could persuade him to tell you the rest; but there
is scarce time for it: But the short of the story is
this, the sirst part of which, I suppose, you know
well enough, viz. That you were with this ship at Su-
matra; that there your captain was murdered by
the Malaccans, with three of his men; and that
you, or some of those that were on board with you, ran
away with the snip, and are since turned PIRATES.
This is the sum of the story, and you will all be seized
as pirates, I can assure you, and executed with very
little ceremony; for you know merchant ships shew
but little law to pirates, if they get them in their
power.
Now you speak plain English, said I, and I thank
you; and though I know nothing that we have done,
like what you talk of, but I am sure we came honest-
ly and sairly by the ship; yet seeing such work is a
doing, as you say, and that you seem to mean ho-
nestly, I will be upon my guard. Nay, Sir, says
he, do not talk of being upon your guard; the best
defence is to be out of the danger: if you have any
regard to your life, and the lives of all your men,
put out to sea without sail at high-water; and as
you have a whole tide before you, you will be gone
too sar out before they can come down; for they will
come away at high water; and as they have twenty
miles to come, you'll get near two hours of them
by the difference of the tide, not reckoning the length
of the way: Besides, as they are only boats, and
not ships, they will not venture to follow you sar out
to sea, especially if it blows.
Well,
253
Well, said I, you have been very kind in this:
"What shall I do for you to make you amends? Sir,
says he, you may not be so willing to make me
amends, because you may not be convinced of the
truth of it: I will make an osfer to you; I have
nineteen months pay due to me on board the ship
OF ROBINSON CRUSOE.
Dutchman, that is with me, has seven months pay
due to him; if you will make good our pay to us,
we will go along with you: If you find nothing
more in it, we will defire no more; but if we do
convince you, that we have saved your life, and the
ship, and the lives of all the men in her, we will leave
the rest to you.
I consented to this readily; and went immediately
on board, and the two men with me. As soon as I
came to the ship's side, my partner, who was on
board, came on the quarter-deck, and called to me
with a great deal of joy, O ho! O ho! we have
stopped the leak! Say you so, said I, thank God;
but weigh the anchor then immediately: Weigh!
says he, what do you mean by that? What is the
matter? says he. AIk no questions, said I, but all
hands to work, and weigh without losing a minute.
He was surprised: But, however, he called the cap-
tain, and he immediately ordered the anchor to be
got up; and though the tide was not quite done, yet
a little land-breeze blowing, we stood out to sea;
then I called him into the cabin, and told him the
story at large; and we called in the men, and they
told us the rest of it: but as it took us up a great
deal of time, so before we had done, a seaman
comes to the cabin-door, and calls out to us, that
the
1
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
the captain bade him tell us, we were chased:
Chased, said I, by whom, and by what? By five
sloops, or boats, said the fellow, full of men. Very
well, said I; then it is apparent there is something
in it. In the next place, I ordered all our men to
be called up: and told them, that there was a de-
sign to seize the ship, and to take us for pirates;
and asked them, if they would stand by us, and by
one another? The men answered, chearfully, one
and all, that they would live and die with us. Then
I asked the captain, what way he thought best for
us to manage a fight with them: For resist them I
resolved we would, and that to the last drop. He
said, readily, that the way was to keep them off
with our great {hot, as long as we could, and then
to fire at them with our small arms, to keep them
from boarding us; but when neither of these would
do any longer, we mould retire to our close quar-
ters; perhaps they had not materials to break open
our bulk-heads, or get in upon us.
The gunner had, in the mean time, orders to bring
two guns to bear fore and aft, out of the steerage, to
clear the deck, and load them with musquet-bullets,
and small pieces of old iron, and what next came to
hand; and thus we made ready for fight; but all
this while kept out to sea, with wind enough, and
could fee the boats at a distance, being five large
long-boats following us, with all the sail they could
make.
Two of these boats, which, by out glasses, we
could fee were English, had out-sailed the rest, were
near two leagues a-head of them, and gained upon
us considerably; lo that we found they would come
up with us: upon which we fired a gun without a
(hot, to intimate that they should bring to; and we
put out a" flag of truce, as a signal for parley; but
they kept crowding after us, till they came within
shot: upon this we took in our white flag, they
having made no answer to it, hung out the red flag,
and fired at them with shot: Notwithstanding this,
they came on till they were near enough to call to
them with a speaking trumpet, which we had on
board; so we called to them, and bade them keep
off at their peril.
It was all one, they crowded after us, and en-
deavoured to come under our stern, so to board us
on our quarter: Upon which, seeing they were re-
solute for mischief, and depended upon the strength
that followed them, I ordered to bring the ship to,
so that they lay upon our broadside, when immedi-
ately we fired five guns at them; one of them had
been levelled so true, as to carry away the stern of
the hindermost boat, and bring them to the necessity
of taking down their sail, and running all to the
head of the boat to keep her from sinking; so me
lay by, and had enough of it; but seeing the fore-
most boat still crowd on after us, we made ready to
fire at her in particular.
While this was doing, one of the three boats that
was behind, being forwarder than the other two,
made up to the boat which we had disabled, to re-
lieve her, and we could afterwards fee her take out
the men: we called again to the foremost boat, and
offered a truce to parley again, and to know what
was her business with us; but had no answer: only
she crowded close under our stern. Upon this our
gunner
gunner, who was a very dexterous fellow, run out
his two chace guns, and fired at her; but the shot
missing, the men in the boat shouted, waved their
caps, and came on; but the gunner, getting quickly-
ready again, fired among them a second time; one
shot of which, though it missed the boat itself, yet
fell in among the men, and we could easily see had
done a great deal of mischief among them; but we,
taking no notice of that, weared the ship again, and
brought our quarter to bear upon them; and, firing
three guns more, we found the boat was split almost
to pieces; in particular, her rudder, and a piece of
her stern, were shot quite away; so they handed
their sail immediately, and were in great disorder:
but, to compleat their misfortune, our gunner let
fly two guns at them again; where he hit them we
could not tell, but we found the boat was sinking,
and some of the men already in the water:—
Upon this I immediately manned out our pinnace,
which we had kept close by our side, with orders to
pick up some of the men, if they could, and save
them from drowning, and imediately to come on
board with them; because we saw the rest of the
boats began to come up. Our men in the pinnace
followed their orders, and took up three men; one
of which was just drowning, and it was a good while
before we could recover him. As soon as they were
on board, we crowded all the sail we could make,
and stood sarther out to sea; and we found, that
when the other three boats came up to the first two,
they gave over their chace.
Being
Being thus delivered from a danger, which tho'
I knew not the reason of it, yet seemed to be much
greater than I apprehended, I took care that we should
change our course, and not let any one imagine whi-
ther we were going; so we stood out to sea eastward,
quite out of the course of all European ships, whe-
ther they were bound to China, or any where else,
within the commerce of the European nations.
When we were now at sea, we began to consult
with the two seamen, and enquire first, what the
meaning of all this should be? The Dutchman let us
into the secret of it at once; telling us, that the fel-
low that fold us the ship, as we said, was no more
than a thief that had run away with her. Then he
told us how the captain, whose name too he men-
tioned, though I do not remember it now, was
treacherously murdered by the natives on the coast of
Malacca, with three of his men; and that he, this
Dutchman, and four more, got into the woods, where
they wandered about a great while; till at length, he,
in particular, in a miraculous manner, made his
escape, and swam off to a Dutch ship, which sailing
near the more, in its way from China, had sent their
boat on shore for fresh water; that he durst not
come'to that part of the shore where the boat was,
but made shift in the night to take in the water
sarther off, and swimming a great while, at last the
ship's boat took him up.
He then told us, that he went to Batavia, where
two of the seamen belonging to the ship had arrived,
having deserted the rest in their travels; and gave
an account, that the fellow who had run away with
the ship, sold her at Bengal to a set of pirates, which
Voin II. S were
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
were gone a cruising in her; and that they had al-
ready taken an E/iglish ship, and two Dutch ships,
very richly laden.
This latter part we found to concern us directly;
and though we knew it to be salse, yet, as my part-
ner said very well, if we had sallen into their hands,
and they had such a prepossession against us before-
hand, it had been in vain for us to have defended
ourselves, or to hope for any good quarters at their
hands; especially considering that -our accusers had
been our judges, and that we could have expected
nothing from them but what rage would have dic-
tated, and ungoverned passion have executed; and
there/ore it was his opinion, we should go directly
back to Bengal, from whence we came, without put-
ting in at any port whatever; because there we could
give an account of ourselves, and could prove where
we were when the ship put in, whom we bought her
of, and the like; and, which was more than all the
rest, if we were put to the necessity of bringing it
before the proper judges, we should be sure to have
some justice; and not be hanged first, and judged
afterwards.
I was some time of my partner's opinion; but
after a little more serious thinking, I told him, I
thought it was a very great hazard for us to attempt
returning to Bengal, for that we were on the wrong
side of the straits of Malacca; and that if the
alarm was given, we should be sure to be way-laid on
every side, as well by the Dutch of Batavia, as the
Engtislj elsewhere; that if we should be taken, as it
were, running away, we should even condemn our-
selves, and there would want no more evidence to
destroy
destroy us. I also asked the English sailor's opinion,
who said, he was of my mind, and that we should
certainly be taken.
This danger a little startled my partner, and all
the ship's company; and we immediately resolved to
go away to the coast of Tonquin, and so on to China;
and from thence pursuing the first design, as to trade,
find some way or other to dispose of the ship, and
come back in some of the vessels of the country,
such as we could get. This was approved of as the
best method for our security; and accordingly we
steered away N. N. £. keeping above fifty leagues off
from the usual course to the eastward.
This, however, put us to some inconveniencies;
for first the winds, when we came to that distance
from the shore, seemed to be more steadily against
us, blowing almost trade, as we call it, from the east
and E. N. E. so that we were a long while upon our
voyage; and we were but ill provided with victuals
for so long a run; and, which was still worse, there
was some danger, that those English and Dutch ships,
whose boats pursued us, whereof some were bound
that way, might be got in before us; and if not,
some other ship, bound to China, might have infor-
mation of us from them, and pursue us with the
same vigour.
I must confess, I was now very uneasy, and thought
myself, including the late escape from the long-boats,
to have been in the most dangerous condition that
ever I was in through all my past life; for, whatever
ill circumstances I had been in, I was never pursued
for a thief before; nor had I ever done any thing
S 2 that
that merited the name of dishonest or fraudulent,
much less thievish. I had chiefly been mine own
enemy; or, as I may rightly say, I had been no-
body's enemy but my own. But now I was embar-
rassed in the worst condition imaginable; for though
I was perfectly innocent, I was in no condition to
make that innocence appear. And if I had been
taken, it had been under a supposed guilt of the
worst kind; at least, a crime esteemed so among the
people I had to do with.
This made me very anxious to make an escape,
though which way to do it, I knew not; or what
port or place we should go to. My partner, seeing
me thus dejected, though he was the most con-
cerned at first, began to encourage me; and de-
scribing to me the several ports of that coast, told
me, he would put in on the coast of Cochinchina, or
the bay of Tonquin; intending to go afterwards to
Macao, a town once in the possession of the Portu-
guese, and where still a great many European samilies
resided, and particularly the missionary priest usually
went thither, in order to their going forward to
China.
Hither we then resolved to go; and accordingly,
though after a tedious and irregular course, and very
much straitened for provisions, we came within sight
of the coast very early in the morning; and, upon
reflection upon the past circumstances we were in,
and the danger, if we had not escaped, we resolved
to put into a small river, which, however, had depth
enough of water for us, and to fee if we could, ei-
ther over land or by the ship's pinnace, come to
i know
know what (hips were in any port thereabouts. This
happy step was, indeed, our deliverance; for tho'
we did not immediately fee any European ships in the
bay of Tonquin, yet, the next morning, there came
into the bay two Dutch ships, and a third without
any colours spread out, but which we believed to be
a Dutchman, passed by at about two leagues distance,
steering for the coast of China/ and in the after-
noon went by two English ships, steering the same
course; and thus, we thought, we saw ourselves
beset with enemies, both one way and the other.
The place we were in was wild and barbarous, the
people thieves, even by occupation or profession;
and though, it is true, we had not much to seek of
them, and except getting a few provisions, cared not
how little we had to do with them; yet it was" with
much difficulty that we kept ourselves from being in-
sulted by them several ways.
We were in a small river of this country, within
a few leagues of its utmost limits northward; and by
our boat we coasted north-east to the point of land
which opens to the great bay of Tonquin; and it
was in this beating up along the shore, that we dis-
covered as above, that in a word, we were surrounded #
with enemies. The people we were among were
the most barbarous of all the inhabitants of the
coast; having no correspondence with any other na-
tion, and dealing only in fish and oil, and such gross
commodities; and it may be particularly seen, that
they are, as I said, the most barbarous of any of
the inhabitants, viz. that among other customs they
have this one, that if any vessel had the misfortune
S3 to
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
to be shipwrecked upon their coast, they presently
make the men all prisoners; that is to say, slaves;
and it was not long before we found a spice of their
kindness this way, on the occasion following:
I have observed above, that our ship sprung a
leak at sea, and that we could not find it out; and
however it happened, that, as I have said, it was
stopped unexpectedly, in the happy minute of our
being to be seized by the Dutch and English shipS,
near the bay of Siam; yet, as we did not find the
ship so perfectly tight and found as we defired, we
resolved, while we were in this place, to lay her
on shore, take out what heavy things we had on
board, which were not many, and to wash and clean
her bottom; and if possible, to find out where the
leaks were.
Accordingly, having lightened the ship, and brought
all our guns, and other moveable things, to one
side, we tried to bring her down, that we might
come at her bottom; for, on second thoughts, we
did not care to lay her dry a-ground, neither could
we find out a proper place for it.
The inhabitants, who had never been acquainted
with such a sight, came wondering down to the
shore to look at us; and seeing the ship lie down on
one side in such a manner, and heeling towards the
shore, and not seeing our men, who were at work
on her bottom, with stages, and with their boats on
the off side, they presently concluded that the ship
was cast away, and lay so very sast on the ground.
On this supposition they came all about us in two
or three hours time, with ten or twelve large boats,
4 having
having some of them eight, some ten men in a boat,
intending, no doubt, to have come on board" and
plundered the ship; and if they had found us there,
to have carried us away for slaves to their king, or
whatever they call him, for we knew not who was
their governor.
When they came up to the ship, and began to row
round her, they discovered us all hard at word, on
the outside of the ship's bottom and side, washing
and graving, and stopping, as every seasaring man
knows how.
They stood for a while gazing at us, and we, who
were a little surprized, could not imagine what their
design was; but, being willing to be sure, we took
this opportunity to get some of us into the ship, and
others to hand down arms and ammunition, to those
that were at work to defend themselves with, if there
should be occasion; and it was no more than need;
for, in less than a quarter of an hour's consultation,
they agreed, it seems, that the ship was really a
wreck; that we were all at work, endeavouring to
save her, or to save our lives by the help of our
boats; and when we handed our arms into the boats,
they concluded, by that motion, that we were endea-
vouring to save some of our goods. Upon this they
took it for granted they all belonged to them;
and away they came directly upon our men, as if it
had been in a line of battle.
Our men, seeing so many of them, began to be
frighted; for we lay but in an ill posture to fight, and
cried out to us to know what they should do? I im-
mediately called to the men who worked upon the
S 4 stages,
stages, to flip them down, and get up the side into
the ship; and bade those in the boat to row round
and come on board: and those few of us who were
on board, worked with all the strength and hands
we had, to bring the ship to rights; but however,
neither the men upon the stage, nor those in the
boats, could do as they were ordered, before the
Cochinchinese were upon them; and, with two of
their boats boarded our long-boat, and began to lay
hold of the men as their prisoners.
The first man they laid hold of was an English
seaman, a stout strong fellow, who having a mus-
quet in his hand, never offered to fire it, but laid it
down in the boat, like a fool, as I thought. But he
understood his business better than I could teach him;
for he grappled the pagan, and dragged him by main
force' out of their own boat into ours; where, tak-
ing him by the two ears, he beat his head so against
the boat's gunnel, that the fellow died instantly in
his hands; and in the mean time, a Dutchman, who
stood next, took up the musquet, and with the butt-
end of it, so laid about him, that he knocked down
five of them, who attempted to enter the boat: but
this was little towards resisting thirty or forty men,
who fearless, because ignorant of their danger, be-
gan to throw themselves into the long-boat, where
we had but five men to defend it: but one accident
gave our men a complete victory, which deserved
our laughter rather than any thing else; and that
was this:—
Our carpenter being prepared to grave the out-
side of the ship, as well as to pay the seams where
he
he had caulked her, to stop the leaks, had got two
kettles just let down into the boat; one filled with
boiling pitch, and the other with rosin, tallow, and
oil, and such stuff as the shipwrights used for that
work; and the man that tended the carpenter had
a great iron ladle in his hand, with which he sup-
plied the men that were at work with that hot stuff:
two of the enemy's men entered the boat just where
this fellow stood, being in the fore-sheets; he imme-
diately saluted them with a ladleful of the stuff, boiL
ing hot, which so burnt and scalded them, being
half naked, that they roared out like two bulls, and
enraged with the fire, leaped both into the sea. The
carpenter saw it, and cried out, Well done, Jack,
give them some more of it; when stepping forward
himself, he takes one of their mops, and dipping it
in the pitch pot, he and his man threw it among
them so plentifully, that, in short, of all the men
in three boats, there was not one that was not
scalded and burnt with it in a most frightful pi-
tiful manner, and made such an howling and crying,
that I never heard a worse noise, and, indeed, no-
thing like it: for it was worth observing, that tho'
pain naturally makes all people cry out, yet every
nation have a particular way of exclamation, and
make noises as different from one another as then-
speech. I cannot give the noise these creatures made
a better name than howling, nor a name more pro-
per to the tone of it; for I never heard any thing
more like the noise of the wolves, which, as I have
said, I heard howl in the forest on the frontiers of
Languedoc.
I was
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
I was never pleased with a victory better in my life;
not only as it was a perfect surprise to me, and that
our danger was imminent before; but as we got this
victory without any bloodshed, except of that man
the fellow killed with his naked hands, and which I
was very much concerned at; for I was sick of killing
such poor savage wretches, even though it was in my
own defence, knowing they came on errands which
they thought just, and knew no better: and that
though it may be a just thing, because necessary, for
there is no necessary wickedness in nature; yet I
thought it was a sad life, when we must be always
obliged to be killing our fellow-creatures to preserve
ourselves; and, indeed, I think so still; and I would,
even now, suffer a great deal, rather than I would
take away the life even of the worst person injuring
me. I believe also, all considering people, who know
the value of life, would be of my opinion, if they en-
tered seriously into the consideration of it.
But to return to my story: All the while this was do-
ing, my partner and I, who managed the rest of the
men on board, had, with great dexterity, brought
the ship almost to rights; and, having gotten the guns
into their places again, the gunner called to me, to
bid our boat get out of the way, for he would let fly
among them. I called back again to him, and bid
him not offer to fire, for the carpenter would do the
work without him; but bade him heat another pitch
kettle; which our cook, who was on board, took
care of. But the enemy was so terrified with what
they met with in their first attack, that they would
not come on again; and some of them, that were
sarthest off, seeing the ship swim, as it were, upright,
began
began, as we supposed, to see their mistake, and
gave over the enterprise, finding it was not as they
expected. Thus we got clear of this merry fight;
and, having gotten some rice, and some roots and
bread, with about sixteen good big hogs, on board,
two days before, we resolved to stay here no longer,
but go forward, whatever came of it; for we made
no doubt but we should be surrounded the next day
with rogues enough, perhaps more than our pitch-
kettle would dispose of for us.
We, therefore, got all our things on board the
fame evening, and the next morning were ready to
sail. In the mean time, lying at an anchor some
distance from the shore, we were not so much con-
cerned, being now in a fighting posture, as well as
in a sailing posture, if any enemy had presented. The
next day, having finished our work within board,
and finding our ship was perfectly healed of all her
leaks, we set sail: we would have gone into the bay
of Tonquin, for we wanted to inform ourselves of what
was to be known concerning the Dutch ships that
had been there; but we durst not stand in there, be-
cause we had seen several ships go in, as we supposed,
but a little before; so we kept on N. E. towards the
isle of Formosa, as much afraid of being seen by a
Dutch or English merchant stiip, as a Dutch or Englislj
merchant ship in the Mediterranean is of an Algerine
man of war.
When we were thus got to sea, we kept on N. E.
as if we would go to the Manillas or the Philippine
islands, and this we did, that we might not sall into
the way of any of the European ships; and then we
steered north again, till we came to the latitude
of
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
of 22 deg. 20 min. by which means we made the
ifland of Formosa directly, where we came to an an-
chor, in order to get water and fresli provisions,
which the people there, who are very courteous and
civil in their manners, supplied us with willingly,
and dealt very sairly and punctually with us in all
their agreements and bargains; which is what we
did not find among other people; and may be owing
to the remains of Christianity, which was once
planted here by a Dutch missionary of protestants,
and is a testimony of what I have often observed, viz.
That the Christian religion always civilizes the peo-
ple, and reforms their manners, where it is received,
whether it works saving effects upon them or not.
From hence we sailed still north, keeping the coast
of China at an equal distance, till we knew we were
beyond all the ports of China, where our European
ships usually come; but being resolved, if possible,
not to sall into any of their hands, especially in this
country, where, as our circumstances were, we could
not sail of being entirely ruined; nay, so great was
my fear in particular, as to my being taken by them,
that I believe firmly I would much rather have chosen
to sall into the hands of the Spanish inquisition,
Being now come to the latitude of 30 degrees, we
resolved to put info the first trading port we mould
come at; and standing in for the shore, a boat came
off two leagues to us, with an old Portuguese pilot on
board, who, knowing us to be an European ship,
came to offer his service, which, indeed, we were
very glad of, and took him on board; upon which,
without asking us whither we would go, he dismisled
the boat he came in, and sent it back.
I thought
269
I thought it was now so much in our choice to make
the old man carry us whither we would, that I began
to talk with him about carrying us to the Gulpb of
Nanquin, which is the most northern part of the
coast of China. The old man said he knew the
Gulpb of Nanquin very well; but smiling, asked us
what we would do there?
I told him we would fell our cargo, and purchase
China wares, callicoes, raw silks, tea, wrought silks,
&c. and so would return by the same course we came.
He told us our best port had been to have put in at
Macao, where we could not sail of a market for our
opium, to our satissaction, and might, for our money,
have purchased all sorts of China goods, as cheap as
we could at Nanquin.
Not being able to put the old man out of his talk,
of which he was very opiniated, or conceited, I told
him, we were gentlemen as well as merchants; and
that we had a mind to go and fee the great city of
Pckin, and the samous court of the monarch of
China. Why then, says the old man, you should
go to Ningpo, where, by the river that runs into the
sea there, you may go up within five leagues of the
great canal. This canal is a navigable made stream,
which goes through the heart of all that vast empire
of China, crosses all the rivers, passes some conside-
rable hills by the help of sluices and gates, and goes
up to the city of Pekin, being in length near 270
leagues.
Well, said I, Seignior Portuguese, but that is not
our business now: the great question is, If you can
carry us up to the city of Nanquin, from whence we
C|a travel to Pekin afterwards? Yes, he said, he
could
could do so very well, and there was a great Dutch
ship gone up that way just before. This gave me a
little shock ; a Dutch ship was now our terror, and
we had much rather have met the devil, at least if he
had not come in too frightful a figure: we depended
upon it, that a Dutch ship would be our destruction,
for we were in no condition to fight them; all the
ships they trade with in those parts being of great
burden, and of much greater force than we were.
The old man found me a little confused, and under
some concern, when he named a Dutch ship; and
said to me, Sir, you need be under no apprehension
of the Dutch, I suppose they are not now at war with
your nation. No, said I, that's true; but I know
not what liberties men may take, when they are
out of the reach of the laws of their country. Why,
said he, you are no pirates, what need you fear?
They will not meddle with peaceable merchants,
sure.
If I had any blood in my body that did not fly up
into my sace at that word, it was hindered by some
stop in the vessels appointed by nature to circulate it;
for it put me into the greatest disorder and confu-
sion imaginable; nor was it possible for me to con-
ceal it so, but that the old man easily perceived it.
Sir, said he, I find you are in some disorder in
your thoughts at my talk: pray be pleased to go
which way you think fit; and depend upon it, I'll
do you all the service I can. Why, Seignior, said
I, it is true, I am a little unsettled in my resolution
at this time, whither to go in particular; and I am
something more so, for what you said about pirates;
I hope there are no pirates in these seas; we are but
in
m an ill condition to meet with them; for you fee we
have but a small force, and but very weakly manned.
O, Sir, said he, do not be concerned; I do not
know that there have been any pirates in these seas
these fifteen, years, except one, which was seen, as I
hear, in the bay of Siam, about a month since; but
you may be assured she is gone to the southward;
nor was she a ship of any great force, or fit for the
work: she was not built for a privateer, but was run
away with by a reprobate crew that were on board,
after the captain and some of his men had been
murdered by the Malaccans, at or near the island of
Sumatra.
What! said I, seeming to know nothing of the
matter, did they murder the captain? No, said he,
I do not understand that they murdered him; but, as
they afterwards ran away with the ship, it is gene-
rally believed they betrayed him into the hands of
the Malaccans, who did murder him; and, perhaps,
they procured them to do it. Why then, said I,
they deserved death, as much as if they had done it
themselves. Nay, said the old man, they do deserve
it; and they will certainly have it if they light upon
any English or Dutch ship; for they have all agreed
together, that if they meet that rogue, they will
give him no quarter.
But, said I to him, you say the pirate is gone out
of these seas; how can they meet with him then?
Why, that is true, said he, they do say so; but he was,
as I tell you, in the bay of Siam, in the river Cambodia,
and was discovered there by some Dutchmen, who
belonged to the ship, and who were left on shore
when
when they run away with her; and some Englijh
and Dutch traders being in the river, they were with-
in a little of taking him. Nay, said he, if the fore-
most boats had been well seconded by the rest, they
had certainly taken him; but he, finding only two
boats within reach of him, tacked about, and fired at
these two, and disabled them before the others came
up; and then standing off to sea, the others were
not able to follow him, and so he got away. But
they have all so exact: a description of the ship, that
they will be sure to know him; and wherever they
find him, they have vowed to give no quarter to
either the captain or the seamen, but to hang them
all up at the yard-arm.
What! said I, will they execute them right or
wrong; hang them first, and judge them afterwards?
O, Sir! said the old pilot, there is no need to make
a formal business of it with such rogues as those;
let them tie them back to back, and set them a div-
ing; it is no more than they rightly deserve.
I knew I had my old man sast aboard, and that
he could do me no harm; so I turned short upon
him: Well, Seignior, said I, and this is the very
reason why I would have you carry us lo Nanquin,
and not to put back to Macao, or to any other part
of the country, where the English or Dutch ships
. came; for, be it known to you, Seignior, those cap-
tains of the English and Dutch ships, are a parcel of
rash, proud, insolent fellows, that neither know
what belongs to justice, or how to behave them-
selves, as the laws of God and nature direct; but
being proud of their offices, and not understanding
their power, they would act the murderers to punish
robbers j
robbers; would take upon them to insult men salse-
ly accused, and determine them guilty without due
Enquiry; and perhaps I may live to call some of them
to an account for it, where they may be taught how.
justice is to be executed; and that no man ought to
be treated as a criminal till some evidence may be
had of the crime, and that he is the man.
With this I told him, that this was the very ship
they had attacked; and gave him a full account of
the skirmim we had with their boats, and how fool-
ishly and coward-like they had behaved. I told
him all the story of our buying the ship, and how
the Dutchmen served us. I told him the reasons I
had to believe that this story of killing the master
by the Malaccans was not true; as also the running
away with the ship; but that it was all a fiction of
their own, to suggest that the men were turned pi-
rates; and they ought to have been sure it was so,
before they had ventured to attack us by surprise,
and oblige us to resist them; adding, that they
Would have the blood of those men, who were killed
there, in our just defence, to answer for.
The old mast was amazed at this relation; and told
us, we were very much in the right to go away to the
north; and that if he might advise us, it should be to
fell the ship in China, which we might very well do,
and buy or build another in the country: and, said
he, though you will not get so good a ship, yet you
may get one able enough to carry you and all your
goods back again to Bengal, or any where else.
I told him I would take his advice, when I came to
any port where I could find a ship for my turn, or get
any customer to buy this. He replied, I should
Vol. II. T meet
meet with customers enough for the ship at,Nanqu'm,
and that a Cbinese]unk would serve me very well to go
back again; and that he would procure me people
both to buy one, and sell the other.
Well, but, Seignior, says I, as you say they know
the ship so well, I may, perhaps, if I follow your
measures, be instrumental to bring some honest inno-
cent men into a terrible broil, and, perhaps, be mur-
dered in cold blood; for wherever they find the
ship they will prove the guilt upon the men, by prov-
ing this was the ship; and so innocent men may pro-
bably be overpowered and murdered. Why, said
the old man, I'll find out a way to prevent that also;
for as I know all those commanders you speak of very
well, and shall see them all as they pass by, 1 will be
sure to set them to rights in the thing, and let them
know that they had been so much in the wrong; that
though the people who were on board at first might
run away with the ship, yet it was not true that they
had turned pirates; and that in particular those were
not the men that first went off with the ship, but inno-
cently bought her for their trade: and I am per-
suaded they will so sar believe me, as, at least, to act
more cautiously for the time to come. Well, said I,
and will you deliver one message to them from me?
Yes, I will, says he, if you will give it under your
hand, in writing, that I may be able to prove it came
from you, and not out of my own head. I answered,
that I would readily give it him under my hand. So
I took a pen and ink, and paper, and wrote at large
the story of assaulting me with the long-boats, &c.
the pretended reason of it, and the unjust cruel deiign
of it; and concluded to the commanders, that they
had
had done what they not only should have been
ashamed of, but also, that if ever they came to
England, and I lived to see them there, they should
all pay dearly for it, if the laws of my country were
not grown out of use before I arrived there.
My old pilot read this over and over again, and
asked me several times, if I would stand to it. I
answered, I would stand to it as long as I had anv
thing left in the world; being sensible that I should,
one time or other, find an opportunity to put it home
to them. But we had no occasion ever to let the
pilot carry this letter; for he never went back again.
While those things were passing between us, by way
of discourse, we went forward directly for Nanquin,
and, in about thirteen days sail, came to anchor at
the south-west point of the great gulph of Nanquin;
where, by the way, I came by accident to under-
stand, that the two Dutch ships were gone that length
before me, and that I should certainly sall into their
hands. I consulted my partner again in this exi-
gency, and he was as much at a loss as I was, and
would very gladly have been safe on shore al-
most any where. However, I was not in such per-
plexity neither, but I asked the old pilot if there was
no creek, or harbour, which I might pui into, and
pursue my business with the Chinese privately, and be
in no danger of the enemy? He told me, if I would
sail to the southward about two and forty leagues,
there was a little port called Shtinchang, where the
sathers of the mission usually landed from Macao, on
their progress to teach the Christian religion to the
Chinese, and where no European ships ever put in;
and, if I thought proper to put in there, I might con-
T 2 slder
sider what sarther course to take when I was on shoret-
He confessed, he said, it was not a place for mer-
chants, except that at some certain times they had a
kind of a sair there, when the merchants from
Japan came over thither to buy the Chinese mer-
chandizes.
We all agreed to go back to this place: the name
of the port, as he called it, I may, perhaps spell
wrong , for I do not particularly remember it, having
lost this, together with the names of many other
places set down in a little pocket-book, which was
spoiled by the water, on an accident which I shall
relate in its order; but this I remember, that the
Chinese or Japanese merchants we correspond with
call it by a different name from that which our Por-
tuguese pilot gave it,, and pronounced it as above,:
S$uincbang.
As we were unanimous in our resolutions to go to'
this place, we weighed the next day, having only
gone twice on more, where we were to get fresh water;
on both which occasions the people of the country
wrere very civil to us, and brought us abundance of
things to fell to us; I mean of provisions, plants,
roots, tea, rice, and some fowls; but nothing, with-
out money-
We came to the other port (the wind being con-
trary) not till five days; but it was very much to our-
satissaction; and I was joyful, and, I may say^
thankful, when I set my foot safe on more; resolving^
and my partner too, that if it was possible to dispose,
of ourselves and effects any other way, though not
every way to our satissaction, we would never set one
foot on board that unhappy vessel again: and indeed,
I must
5 must acknowledge, that of all the circumstances of
life that ever I had any experience of, nothing makes
mankind so completely miserable as that of being in
constant fear. Well does the scripture say, 'The
fear of man brings a snareit is a life of death; and
the mind is so entirely suppressed by it, that it is ca-
pable of no relief; the animal spirits sink, and all
the vigour of nature, which usually supports men
under other afflictions, and is present to them in the
greatest exigencies, sails them here.
Nor did it sail of its usual operations upon the sancy,
iby heightening every danger; representing the En-
glis}j and Dutch captains to be men incapable of hear-
ing reason, or distinguishing between honest men and
rogues; or between a story calculated for our own
turn, made out of nothing, on purpose to deceive, and
a true genuine account of our whole voyage, progress,
and design; for we might many ways have convinced
any reasonable creature that we were not pirates; the
goods we had on board, the course we steered, our
frankly shewing ourselves, and entering into such and
such ports; even our very manner, the force we had,
ihe number of men, the few arms, little ammunition,
and short provisions; all these would have served to
convince any man that we were no pirates. The
•opium, and other goods we had on board, would
make it appear the ship had been at Bengal; the
Dutchmen, who, it was said, had the names of all the
men that were in the ship, might easily fee that we
were a mixture of English, Portuguese, and Indians,
and but two Dutchmen on board. These, and many
other particular circumstances, might have made it
'evident to the understanding of any commander*
T 3 whose
whose hands we might sall into, that we were no
pirates.
But fear, that blind useless passion, worked another
way, and threw us into the vapours; it bewildered
our understandings, and set the imagination at work,
to form* a thousand terrible things, that, perhaps-,
might never happen. We first supposed, as indeed
every body had related to us, that the seamen on board
the Englisl) and Dutch ships, but especially the Dutch,
were so enraged at the name of a pirate, and especially
at our beating off their boats, and escaping, that they
would not give themselves leave to enquire whether we
were pirates or no; but would execute us off-hand,
as we call it, without giving us any room for a de-
fence. We reflected that there was really so much
apparent evidence before them, that they would scarce
enquire after any more: as, first, that the ship was
certainly the same, and that some of the seamen
among them knew ,her, and had been on board her;
and, secondly, that when we had intelligence at the
river Cambodia, that they were coming down to ex-
amine us, we fought their boats, and fled: So that we
made no doubt but they were as fully satisfied of our
being pirates, as we were satisfied of the contrary;
and I often said, I knew not but I should have been
apt tQ have taken the little circumstances for evidence,
if the tables were turned, and my case was theirs;
and have made no scruple of cutting all the crew
to pieces, without believing, or perhaps consider-
ing, what they might have to offer in their de-
fence.
But let that be how it will, those were our appre-
hensions; and both my partner and I too, scarce slept
a night
279
a night without dreaming of halters and yard-arms;
that is to say, gibbets; of fighting, and being taken;
of killing, and being killed; and one night I was in
such a fury in my dream, sancying the Dutchmen had
boarded us, and I was knocking one of their seamen
down, that I struck my double fist against the side of
the cabin I lay in, with such a force as wounded my
hand most grievously, broke my knuckles, and cut
and bruised the flesh, so that it not only waked me out
of my sleep, but I was once afraid I should have lost
two of my fingers.
Another apprehension I had, was, of the cruel
usage we should meet with from them, if we fell into
their hands: then the story of Amboyna came into my
head^ and how the Dutch might, perhaps, torture us,
as they did our countrymen there; and make some
of our men, by extremity of torture, confess those
crimes they never were guilty of; own themselves,
and all of us, to be pirates; and so they would put us
to death, with a formal appearance of justice.; and ~"
that they might be tempted to do this, for the gain of
our ship and cargo, which was worth four or five
thousand pounds, put all together.
These things tormented me, and my partner too,
night and day; nor did we consider that the captains
of ships have no authority to act thus; and if we had
surrendered prisoners to them, they could not answer
the destroying us, or torturing us, but would be ac-
countable for it when they came into their own coun-
try. This, I say, gave me no satissaction; for, if
they will act thus with us, what advantage would it
be to us that they would be called to an account for
it; or, if we were first to be murdered, what satis-
T 4 saction
saction would it be to us to have them punished when
they came home?
I cannot refrain taking notice here what reflections
I now had upon the past variety of my particular cir-
cumstances; how hard I thought it was, that I, who
had spent forty years in a life of continued disficulties,
and was, at last, come, as it were, at the port or
haven which all men drive at, viz. to have rest and
plenty, should be a volunteer in new sorrows, by my
own unhappy choice; and that I, who had escaped so
many dangers in my youth, should now come to be
hanged in my old age, and in so remote a place, for
a crime I was not in the least inclined to, much less
guilty of; and in a place and circumstance, where
innocence was not like to be any protection at all to
me.
After these thoughts, something of religion would
come in; and I would be considering that this seemed
to me to be a disposition of immediate Providence; and
I ought to look upon it, and submit to it, as such:
that although I was innocent as to men, I was sar from
being innocent as to my Maker; and I ought to look
in, and examine what other crimes in my life were
most obvious to me, and for which Providence might
justly inflict this punishment as a retribution; and
that I ought to submit to this, just as I would to a ship-
wreck, if it had pleased God to have brought such a,
disaster upon me.
In its turn, natural courage would sometimes take
its place; and then I would be talking myself up to
vigorous resolution, that I would not be taken to be
barbarously used by a parcel of merciless wretches in
cold blood; that it was much better to have sallen
2 into
{nto the hands of the savages, who were men-eaters,
and who, I was sure, would feast upon me, when they
had taken me, than by those, who would, perhaps,
glut their rage upon me by inhuman tortures and
barbarities: that, in the case of the savages, I always
resolved to die fighting, to the last gasp; and whT
should I not do so now, seeing it was much mor:
dreadful, to me at least, to think of salling into thct
men's hands, than ever it was to think of being eatei
by men: for the savages, give them their due, woull
not eat a man till he was dead; and killed him first
as we do a bullock; but that these men had mam
arts beyond the cruelty of death. Whenever thei
thoughts prevailed, I was sure to put myself into i
kind of fever, with the agitations of a supposed fight;
my blood would boil, and my eyes sparkle, as if [
was engaged; and I always resolved that I would tale
no quarter at their hands; but even at last, if [
could resist no longer, I would blow up the ship, anl
all that was in her, and leave them but little booty t)
boast of.
Butbyhow much the greater weightthe anxieties anl
perplexities of those things were to our thoughts whie
we were at sea, by so much the greater was our satis-
saction, when we saw ourselves on shore; and rry
partner told me, he dreamed, that he had a very hea^y
load upon his back, which he was to carry up an hi 1,
and found that he was not able to stand long under i:;
but the Portuguese pilot came, and took it off his
back, and the hill disappeared, the ground before h;m
shewing all smooth and plain: And truly it was so;
we were all like men who had a load taken off their
backs.
For
For my part, I had a weight taken off from my
ieart, that I was not able any longer to bear; and, as
I said above, we resolved to go no more to sea in that
ship. When we came on shore, the old pilot, who
was now our friend, got us a lodging, and a ware-
house for our goods, which, by the way, was much
:he same: it was a little house or hut, with a large
louse joining to it, all built with canes, and palisadoed
.ound with large canes, to keep out pilfering thieves,
Df which it seems there were not a few in the country.
However, the magistrates allowed us all a little guard,
md we had a soldier with a kind of halbert, or half
jike, who stood sentinel at our door; to whom we
illovved a pint of rice, and a little piece of money,
ibout the value of three-pence per day: so that our
joods were kept very safe.
The sair or mart, usually kept in this place, had
.>een over some time; however, we found that there
.vere three or four junks in the river, and two Japan^
ten, I mean, ships from Japan, with goods which
hey had bought in China, and were not gone away,
laving Japanese merchants on shore.
The first thing our old Portuguese pilot did for us>
vas, to bring us acquainted with three missionary
Romifi priests, who were in the town, and who had
teen there some time, converting the people to
Christianity; but we thought they made but poor
work of it; and made them but sorry Christians
vfien thev had done. However, that was not our
business. One of these was a Frenchman, whom they
called father Simon; he was a jolly well-conditioned
man, very free in his conversation, not seeming so
seikius and grave as the other two did, one of whom
was
283
was a Portuguese, and the other a Genoese; but sather
Simon was courteous, easy in his manner, and very
agreeable company; the other two were more re-
served, seemed rigid and austere, and applied seriously
to the work they came about, viz. to talk with, and
insinuate themselves among the inhabitants, where-
ever they had opportunity: we often eat and drank
with those men: and though I must confess, the con-
version, as they call it, of the Chinese to Christianity,
is so sar from the true conversion required to bring
heathen people to the saith of Christ, that it seems
to amount to little more than letting them know the
name of Christ, say some prayers tothe Virgin Mary,
and her Son, in a tongue which they understand
not, and to cross themselves, and the like; yet it must
be confessed, that these religious, whom we call Mis-
sionaries, have a firm belief that these people mould
be saved, and that they are the instrument of it; and,
on this account, they undergo not only the satigue of
the voyage, and hazards of living in such places, but
oftentimes death itself, with the most violent tortures,
for the sake of this work : and it would be a great
want of charity in us, whatever opinion we have of
the work itself, and the manner of their doing it, if
we mould not have a good opinion of their zeal, who
undertake it with so many hazards, and who have
no prospect of the least temporal advantage to them-
selves.
But, to return to my story: This French priest,
sather Simon, was appointed, it seems, by order of
the chief of the mission, to go up to Pekin, the royal
seat of the Chinese emperor; and waited only for ano-
ther priest, who was ordered to come to him from
Macao^
Macao, to go along with him; and Ave scarce ever
met together, but he was inviting me to go that jour-
ney with him, telling me, how he would shew me all
the glorious things of that mighty empire; and among
the rest, the greatest city in the world; a city, said he,
that your London, and our Paris, put together, can-
not be equal to. This was the city of Pekin, which,
I confess, is very great, and infinitely full of people;
but, as I looked on those things with different eyes
from other men, so I shall give my opinion of them in
few words, when I come, in the course of my travels,
to speak more particularly of them.
But first, I come to my friar or mislionary: Dining
with him one day, and being very merry together,
I shewed some little inclination to go with him; and
he pressed me and my partner very hard, and with a
great many persuasions to consent. Why, sather
Simon, says my partner, why should you desire our
company so much? You know we are heretics, and
.you do not love us, nor can keep us company with
any pleasure. O! says he, you may, perhaps, be
good catholics in time; my business here is to con-
vert heathens; and who knows but I may convert you
*oo? Very well, sather, said I, so you will preach to
us all the way. I won't be troublesome to you, said
he'; our religion does not divest us of good manners;
besides, said he, we are all here like countrymen;
and so we are, compared to the place we are in; and
if you are hugonots, and I a catholic, we may be all
Christians at last; at least, said he, we are all gentle-
men, and we may converse so, without being uneasy
to one another. I liked that part of his discourse
very well, and it began to put me in mind of my
priest
priest that I had left in the Brasils; but this sather
Simon did not come up to his character by a great
deal; for though sather Simort had no appearance of
a criminal levity in him neither, yet he had not that
fund of Christian zeal, strict piety, and sincere af-
fection to religion, that my other good ecclesiastic
had, of whom I have said so much.
But to leave him a little, though he never left us,
nor soliciting us to go with him, but we had some-
thing else before us at that time; for we had, all this
.while, our ship and our merchandize to dispose of j
and we began to be very doubtful what we mould do,
for we were now in a place of very little business;
and once I was about to venture to sail for the river
of Kilam, and the city of Nanquin: But Providence
seemed now more visibly, as I thought, than ever, to
concern itself in our affairs; and I was encouraged
from this very time to think I should, one way or
other, get out of this entangled circumstance, and be
brought home to my own country again; though I
had not the least view of the manner; and when I
began sometimes to think of it, could not imagine by
what method it was to be done. Providence, I fay,
began here to clear up our way a little; and the first
thing that offered was, that our old Portuguese pilot
brought a Japan merchant to us, who began to en-
quire what goods we had; and, in the first place, he
bought all our opium, and gave us a very good price
for it, paying us in gold by weight, some in small
pieces of their own coin, and some in small wedges,
of about ten or eleven ounces each. While we were
dealing with him for our opium, it came into my head
that he might, perhaps, deal with us for the ship
too;
too; and I ordered the interpreter to propose it to
him. He shrunk up his shoulders at it, when it was
first proposed to him; but, in a few days after, he
came to me, with one of the missionary priests for his
interpreter, and told me, he had a proposal to make
to me, and that was this: He had bought a great
quantity of goods of us when he had no thoughts (or
proposals made to him) of buying the ship; and that,
therefore, he had not money enough to pay for the
ship; but if I Would let the same men who were in the
ship navigate her, he would hire the ship to go to
Japan, and would fend them from thence to the
Philippine islands with another loading, which he
would pay the freight of, before they went from
Japan; and that, at their return, he would buy the
ship. I began to listen to this proposal; and so eager
did my head still run upon rambling, that I could not
but begin to entertain a notion myself of going with
him, and so to sail from the Philippine islands away
to the South Seas; and accordingly I asked the
Japanese merchant, if he would not hire us to the
Philippine islands, and discharge us there. He said,
no, he could not do that; for then he could not have
the return of his cargo; but he would discharge us in
Japan, he said, at the ship's return. Well, still I
was for taking him at that proposal, and going my.
self; but my partner, wiser than myself, persuaded
me from it, representing the dangers., as well of the
leas, as of the Japanese, w ho are a salse, cruel, and
treacherous people; and then of the Spaniards at the
Philippines; more salse, more cruel, more treacherous
than they.
287
But, to biing this long turn of our asfairs to a con-
clusion: the first thing we had to do, was to consult
with the captain of the ship, and with the men, and
know if they were willing to go to "Japan; and, while
I was doing this, the young man, whom, as I said,
my nephew had left with me as my companion for my
travels, came to me and told me, that he thought that
voyage promised very fair, and that there was a great
prospect of advantage, and he would be very glad if I
undertook it; but that if I would not, and would give
him leave, he would go as a merchant, or how I
pleased to order him; that if ever he came to England,
and I was there, and alive, he would render me a
faithful account of his success, and it should be as
much mine as I pleased.
I was really loth to part with him; but, considering
the prospect of advantage, which was really consider-
able, and that he was a young fellow as likely to do
well in it as any I knew, I inclined to let him go;
but first I told him I would consuls my partner, and
give him an answer the next day. My partner and I
discoursed about it; and my partner made a most
generous ofFer: he told me, you know it has been an
unlucky ship, and we both resolve not to go to sea in
it again; if your steward (so he called my man) will
venture the voyage, I'll leave my share of the vessel
to him, and let him make the best of it; and if we
live to meet in England, and he meets with success
abroad, he shall account for one half of the pro-
fits of the ship's freight to us, the other shall be
his own. 1
If my partner, who was no way concerned vvith my
young man, made him such an offer, I could do no
3 less
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
less than offer him the same; and all the ship's com-
pany being willing to go with him, we made over half
the ship to him in property, and took a writing from
him, obliging him to account for the other; and away
he went to Japan* The Japan merchant proved a
very punctual honest man to him, protected him a*
Japan, and got him a licence to come on shore, which
the Europeans in general have not lately obtained;
paid him his freight very punctually, sent him to the
Philippines, loaded him with Japan and China wares,
and a supercargo of their own, who trafficking with
the Spaniards, brought back European goods again,
and a great quantity of cloves, and other spice; and
there he was not only paid his freight very well, and
at a very good price, but being not willing to fell the
ship then, the merchant furnished him with goods on
his own account; that, for some money, and some
spices of his own, which he brought with him, he
went back to the Manillas, to the Spaniards, where
he sold his cargo very well. Here, having gotten a
good acquaintance at Manilla, he got his ship made a
free ship; and the governor of Manilla hired him to
go to Acapulco in America, on the coast of Mexico;
and gave him a licence to land there, and travel to
Mexico; and to pass in any Spanish ship to Europe ^
with all his men.
He made the voyage to Acapulco very happily, and
there he sold his ship; and having there also obtained
allowance to travel by land to Porto Bella, he found
means, some how or other, to goto Jamaica with all
his treasure; and about eight years after came to Eng-
land, exceeding rich; of which I shall take notice irt
its
its place; in the mean time, I return to our particular
affairs. .,
Being now to part with the ship, and ship's com-
pany, it came before us, of course, to consider what
recompence we should give to the two men, that
gave us such timely notice of the design against us in
the river of Cambodia. The truth was, they had done
us a considerable service, and deserved well at our
hands; though, by the way, they were a couple of
rogues too: for, as they believed the story of our
being pirates, and that we had really run away with
the ship, they came down to us, not only to betray the
design that was formed against us, but to go to sea
with us as pirates; and one of them confessed after-
wards, that nothing else but the hopes of going a
roguing brought him to do it. However, the ser-
vice they did us was not the less; and therefore, as J
had promised to be grateful to them, I first ordered
the money to be paid to them, which they said was
due to them on board their respective ships; that is
to fay, the Engliflman nineteen months pay, and to
the Dutchman seven; and, over and above that, I
gave each of them a small sum of money in gold,
which contented them very well: then I made the
Englishman gunner of the ship, the gunner being now
made second mate and purser; the Dutchman I made
boatswain: so they were both very well pleased, and
proved very serviceable, being both able seamen, and
very stout fellows.
We were now on shore in China. If I thought
myself banished, and remote from my own country
at Bengal, where I had many ways to get home for
my money, what could I think of myself now, when
Vol. II. U I was
I was gotten about a thousand leagues sarther off
from home, and perfectly destitute of all manner of
prospect of return!
All we had for it was this; that in about four
months time there was to be another sair at that
place where we were, and then we might be able
to purchase all sorts of the manusactures of the coun-
try, and withal might possibly find some Chinese
junks or vessels from Nanquin, that would be to be
fold, and would carry us and our goods whither we
pleased. This I liked very well, and resolved to
wait; besides, as our particular persons were not
obnoxious, so if any English or Dutch ships came
thither, perhaps we might have an opportunity to
load our goods, and get passage to some other place
in India nearer home.
Upon these hopes we resolved to continue here;
but, to divert ourselves, we took two or three jour-
nies into the country; first, we went ten days jour-
ney to see the city of Nanquin, a city well worth
, seeing indeed: they say it has a million of people in
it;. which, however, I do not believe: It is regularly
built, the streets all exactly strait, and cross one
another in direct lines, which gives the figure of it
great advantage. ,
But when I came to compare the miserable people
of these countries with our's; their fabrics, their
manner of living, their government, their religion,
their wealth, and their glory (as some call it), I must
confess, I do not so much as think it worth naming,
or worth my while to write of, or any that shall come
after me to read.
It
It is very observable, that we wonder at the gran-
deur, the riches, the pomp, the ceremonies, the go-
vernment, the manusactures, the commerce, and the
conduct of these people; not that they are to be won-
dered at, or, indeed, in the least to be regarded;
but because, having first a notion of the barbarity of
those countries, the rudeness, and the ignorance that
prevail there, we do not expect to find any such
things so sar off.
Otherwise, what are their builings to the palaces
and royal buildings of Europe? What their trade to
the universal commerce of England, Holland, France,
and Spain? What their cities to our's, for wealth,
strength, gaiety of apparel, rich furniture, and an
infinite variety? What are their ports, supplied with a
few junks and barks, to our navigation, our mer-
chants fleets, our large and powerful navies? Our
city of London has more trade than all their mighty
empire. One Englis}j, or Dutch, or French man of
war of 80 guns, would fight with and destroy all
the shipping of China. But the greatness of their
wealth, their trade, the power of their government,
and strength of their armies are surprizing to us,
because, as I have said, considering them as a bar-
barous nation of pagans, little better than savages,
we did not expect such things among them; and
this, indeed, is the advantage with which all their
greatness and power is represented to us: otherwise,
it is in itself nothing at all; for, as I have said of
their ships, so it may be said of their armies and
troops; all the forces of their empire, though they
were to bring two millions of men into the field to-
ll 2 gether,
gether, would be able to do nothing but ruin the
country, and starve themselves. If they were to
besiege a strong town in Flanders, or to fight a dis-
ciplined army, one line of German cuirassiers, or of
French cavalry, would overthrow all the horse of
China; a million of their foot could not stand be-
fore one embattled body of our insantry, posted so
as not to be surrounded, though they were not to be
one to twenty in number: nay, I do not boast if I say,
that 30,000 German or English foot, and 10,000
French horse, would fairly beat all the forces of
China. And so of our fortified towns, and of the
art of our engineers, in assiiulting and defending
towns; there is not a fortified town in China could
hold out one month against the batteries and attacks
of an European army; and at the same time, all the
armies of China could never take such a town as
Dunkirk, provided it was not starved; no, not in ten
years siege. They have fire-arms, it is true, but
they are awkward, clumsy, and uncertain in going
off; they have powder, but it is of no strength;
they have neither discipline in the field, exercise in
their arms, skill to attack, or temper to retreat:
and therefore I must confess it seemed strange to me
when I came home, and heard our people say such
sine things of the power, riches, glory, magnifi-
cence, and trade of the Chinese, because I saw and
knew that they were a contemptible herd or croud of
ignorant, sordid flaves, subjected to a government
qualified only to rule such a people; and, in a word,
for I am now launched quite beside my design, I say,
in a word, were not its distance inconceivably great
from Muscovy, and were not the Muscovite empire
almost
293
almost as rude, impotent, and ill-governed a croud
of Haves as they, the czar of Muscovy might, with
much ease, drive them all out of their country, and
conquer them in one campaign; and had the czar,
who I since hear is a growing prince, and begins to
appear formidable in the world, sallen this way, in-
stead of attacking the warlike Swedes, in which at-
tempt none of the powers of Europe would have
envied or interrupted him; he might, by this time,
have been emperor of China, instead of being beaten
by the king of Sweden at Narva, when the latter
was not one to six in number. As their strength and
their grandeur, so their navigation, commerce, and
husbandry, is imperfect and impotent, compared to
the same things in Europe. Also, in their knowledge,
their learning, their skill in the sciences; they have
globes and spheres, and a fmatch of the knowledge
of the mathematics; but when you come to enquire
into their kno * ledge, how short-sighted are the wisest
of their students! They know nothing of the mo-
tion of the heavenly bodies; and so grossly, absurd-
ly ignorant, that when the sun is eclipsed, they
think it is a great dragon has assaulted and run away
with it; and they fall a clattering with all the drums
and kettles in the country, to fright the monster
away, just as we do to hive a swarm of bees.
As this is the only excursion of this kind which I
have made in all the account I have given of my
travels, so I shall make no more descriptions of
countries and people: it is none of my business, or
any part of my design; but giving an account of my
own adventures, through a life of infinite wander-
ings, and a long variety of changes, which, perhaps,
U 3 few
few have heard the like of, I shall say nothing of the
mighty places, desart countries, and numerous peo-
ple, I have yet to pass through, more than relates
to my own story, and which my concern among
them will make necessary. I was now, as near as I
can compute., in the heart of China, about the lati-
tude of thirty degrees north of the line, for we
were returned from Nanquin; I had indeed a mind
to fee the city of Pekin, which I had heard so much
of, and sather Simon importuned me daily to do it:
at length his time of going away being set, and the
other missionary, who was to go with him, being ar-
rived from Macao, it was necessary that we fnould re-
solve either to go, or not to go; so I referred him to
my partner, and left it wholly to his choice; who,
at length, resolved it in the affirmative; and we pre-
pared for our journey. We set out with veiy good
advantage, as to finding the way; for we got leave
to travel in the retinue of one of their mandarins,
a kind of viceroy, or principal magistrate, in the
province where they reside, and who take great state
upon them, travelling with great attendance, and
with great homage from the people, who are some-
times greatly impoverished by them, because all the
countries they pass through are obliged to furnish
provisions for them, and all their attendants. That
which I particularly observed, as to our travelling
with his baggage, was this; that though we received
sufficient provisions, both for ourselves and our horses,
from the country, as belonging to the mandarin, yet we
were obliged to pay for every thing we had after the
market-price of the country, and the mandarin's
steward, or commissary of the provisions, collected
it
295
it duly from us; so that our travelling in the retinue
of the mandarin, though it was a very great kind-
ness to us, was not such a mighty savour in him, but
was, indeed, a great advantage to him, considering
there were about thirty other people travelling in the
same manner besides us, under the protection of bis
retinue, or, as we may call it, under his convoy.
This, I say, was a great advantage to him; foi the
country furnished all the provisions for nothing, and
he took all our money for them.
We were five-and-twenty days travelling to Pekin,
through a country infinitely populous, but miserably
cultivated; the husbandry, ceconomy, and the way
Gf living, all very miserable, though they boast so
much of the industry of the people: I say misera-
ble; and so it is; if we, who understand how to
live, were to endure it, or to compare it with our
own; but not so to these poor wretches, who know
no other. The pride of these people is infinitely
great, and exceeded by nothing but their poverty,
which adds to that which I call their misery. I must
needs think the naked savages of America live much
more happy, because, as they have nothing, so they
defire nothing $ whereas these are proud and inso-
lent, and, in the main, are mere beggars and drudges;
their ostentation is inexpressible, and is chiefly shewed
in their clothes and buildings, and in the keeping
multitudes of servants or slaves, and, which is to
the last degree ridiculous, their contempt of all the
world but themselves.
I must confess, I travelled more pleasantly after-
wards, in the desarts and vast wildernesses of Grand
Tartary, than here; and yet the roads here are well
U 4 paved,
paved, and well kept, and very convenient for tra-
vellers: but nothing was more awkward to me, than
to fee such an haughty, imperious, insolent people,
in the midst of the grossest simplicity and ignorance;
for all their samed ingenuity is no more. My friend,
father Simon, and I, used to be very merry upon these
occasions, to fee the beggarly pride of those people:
for example, coming by the house of a country gen-
tleman, as sather Simon called him, about ten leagues
off from the city of Nanquin, we had, first of all,
the honour to ride with the master of the house about
two miles; the state he rode in was a perfect Don
Quixotism, being a mixture of pomp and poverty.
The habit of this greasy Don was very proper for
a scaramouch, or merry-andrew; being a dirty ca-
lico, with all the tawdry trappings of a fool's coat,
such as hanging sleeves, taffety, and cuts and flashes
almost on every side.: it covered a rich taffety vest,
as greasy as a butcher, and which testified, that his
honour must needs be a most exquisite sloven.
His horse was a poor, lean, starved, hobbling crea-
ture, such .as in England might fell for about
thirty or forty shillings; and he had two slaves
followed him on foot, to drive the poor creature
along: he had a whip in his hand, and he bela-
boured the beast as sast about the head as his slaves
did about the tail; and thus he rode by us with
about ten or twelve servants; and we were told he
was going from thz city to his country feat, about
half a league before us. We travelled on gently,
but this figure of a gentleman rode away before us;
and as we stopped at a village about an hour to re-
fresh us, when we came by the country feat of this
great
297
great man, we saw him in a little place before his
door, eating his repast; it was a kind of a garden*
but he was easy to be seen; and we were given to
understand, that the more we looked on him, the
better he would be pleased.
He sat under a tree, something like the palmetto-
tree, which effectually shaded him over the head,
and on the south side; but under the tree also was
placed a large umbrella, which made that part look
well enough: he sat lolling back in a great elbow-
chair, being a heavy corpulent man, and his meat
being brought him by two women slaves, he had two
more, whose office, I think, few gentlemen in Eu-
rope would accept of their service in, viz. one fed
the 'squire with a spoon, and the other held the dish
with one hand, and scraped off what he let sall upon
his worship's beard and taffety vest, with the other;
while the great sat brute thought it below him to em-
ploy his own hands in any of those samiliar offices,
which kings and monarchs would rather do than be
troubled with the clumsy fingers of their servants.
I took this time to think what pain men's pride
puts them to, and how troublesome a haughty tem-
per, thus ill-managed, must be to a man of common
fense; and, leaving the poor wretch to please him-
self with our looking at him, as if we admired his
pomp, whereas we really pitied and contemned him,
we pursued our journey; only sather Simon had the
curiosity to stay to inform himself what dainties the
country justice had to feed on, in all his state; which
he said he had the honour to taste of, and which was,
I think, a dose that an English hound would scarce
have eaten, if it had been offered him, viz. a mess
of
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
of boiled rice, with a great piece of garlick in it,
and a little bag filled with green pepper, and ano-
ther plant which they have there, something like
our ginger, but smelling like musk, and tasting like
mustard; all this was put together, and a small lump
or piece of lean mutton boiled in it; and this was
his worship's repast, four or five servants more at-
tending at a distance. If he fed them meaner than
he was fed himself, the spice excepted, they must sare
very coarsely indeed.
As for our mandarin with whom we travelled, he
was respected like a king; surrounded always with
his gentlemen, and attended in all his appearances
with such pomp, that I saw little of him but at a dis-
tance; but this I observed, that there was not a
horse in his retinue, but that our carriers pack-horses
in England seem to me to look much better; but they
were so covered with equipage, mantles, trappings,
and such like trumpery, that you cannot see whether
they are sat or lean. In a word, we could scarce sec
any thing but their feet and their heads.
I was now light-hearted, and all my trouble and
perplexity that I had given an account of being over,
I had no anxious thoughts about me; which made
this journey much the pleasanter to me; nor had I
any ill accident attended me, only in the passing or
fording a small river, my horse fell, and made me
free of the country, as they call it; that is to say,
threw me in; the place was not deep, but it wetted
me all over: I mention it, because it spoiled my
pocket-book, wherein I had set down the names of
several people and places which I had occasion to re*
2 member,
member, and which not taking due care of, the
leaves rotted, and the words were never after to be
read, to my great loss, as to the names of some
places which I touched at in this voyage.
At length we arrived at Pekin: I had nobody
with me but the youth, whom my nephew the cap-
tain had given me to attend me as a servant, and
who proved very trusty and diligent; and my part-
ner had nobody with him but one servant, who was
a kinsman. As for the Portuguese pilot, he being;
defirous to fee the court, we gave him his passage,
that is to say, bore his charges for his company; and
to use him as an interpreter, for he understood the
language of the country, and spoke good French
and a little English; and, indeed, this old man was a
most useful implement to us every where; for we had
not been above a week at Pckin, when he came laugh-
ing: Ah, Seignior Inglese, said he, I have something
to tell you, will make your heart glad. My heart
glad! said I: What can that be? I don't know any
thing in this country can either give me joy or grief,
to any great degree. Yes, yes, said the old man, in
broken English, make you glad, me sorrow ; sorry he
would have said. This made me more inquisitive.
Why, said I, will it make you sorry? Because, said
he, you have brought me here twenty-five days
Journey, and will leave me to go back alone; and
which way shall I get to my port afterwards, without
a ship, without a horse, without pecune? So he called
money; being his broken Latin, of which he had
abundance to make us merry with.
In short, he told us there was a great caravan of
Muscovy and PolisI) merchants in the city, and that they
were
were preparing to set out on their journey, by land,
to Muscovy, within four or five weeks, and he was
sure we would take the opportunity to go with them,
and leave him behind to go back alone. I confess I
was surprised with this news: a secret joy spread it-
self over my whole soul, which I cannot describe,
and never felt before, or since; and I had no power,
for a good while, to speak a word to the old man;
but at last I turned to him: How do you know this?
said I: are you sure it is true? Yes, he said, I met
this morning, in the street, an old acquaintance of
mine, an Armenian, or one you call a Grecian, who
is among them; he came last from Astracan, and
was designing to go to Tonquin, where I formerly
knew him, but has altered his mind, and is now re-
solved to go back with the caravan to Moscow, and
so down the river of Wolga to Aslracan. Well, Seig-
nior, said I, do not be uneasy about being left to go
back alone; if this be a method for my return to
England, it shall be your fault if you go back to
Macao at all. We then went to consult together
what was to be done, and asked my partner what he
thought of the pilot's news, and whether it would
suit with his affairs: he told me he would do just as
I would; for he had settled all his affairs so well at
Bengal, and left his effects in such good hands, that
as we made a good voyage here, if he could vest it
in China silks, wrought and raw, such as might be
worth the carriage, he would be content to go to
England, and then make his voyage back to Bengals
by the company's ships.
Having resolved upon this, we agreed, that if our
Portuguese pilot would go with us, we would bear his
3 charges
charges to Moscow, or to England, if he pleased;
nor, indeed, were we to be esteemed over generous
in that part neither, if we had not rewarded him
sarther; for the service he had done us was really worth
nll that, and more; for he had not only been a pilot
to us at sea, but he had been also like a broker for us
on shore; and his procuring for us the Japan mer-
chant, was some hundreds of pounds in our pockets.
So we consulted together about it; and, being
willing to gratify him, which was, indeed, but doing
him justice, and very willing also to have him with us
besides, for he was a most necessary man on all oc-
casions, we agreed to give him a quantity of coined
gold, which, as I compute it, came to about 175
pounds sterling between us, and to bear his chargeSj
both for himself and horse, except only a horse to
carry his goods.
Having settled this among ourselves, we called
him to let him know what we had resolved: I told
him, he had complained of our being like to let him
go back alone, and I was now to tell him we were
resolved he should not go back at all: that as we had
resolved to go to Europe with the caravan, we re-
solved also he should go with us, and that we called
him to know his mind. He shook his head, and
said it was a long journey, and he had no pecune to
carry him thither, nor to subsist himself when he
came thither. ' We told him, we believed it was so,
and therefore we had resolved to do something for
him, that should let him see how sensible we were of
the service he had done us; and also how agreeable
he was to us: and then I told him what we had
resolved to give him here, which he might lay out as
we
LIFJt AND ADVENTURES
we would do our own; and that as for his charges* if*
he would go with us, we would set him safe ashore,
(life and casualties excepted) either in Muscovy or in
England, which he would, at our own charge, except
only the carriage of his goods.
He received the proposal like a man transported,
and told us, he would go with us over the whole
world; and so, in short, we all prepared ourselves
for the journey. However, as it was with us, so it
was with the other merchants, they had many things
to do; and instead of being ready in five weeks, it
was four months and some odd days before all things
were got together.
It was the beginning of February, our style, when
we set out from Pekin. My partner and the old pilot
had gone express back to the port where we had first
put in, to dispose of some goods which we had left
there; and I, with a Chinese merchant, whom I had
some knowledge of at Nanquin, and who came to
Pekin on his own asfairs, went to Nanquin, where I
bought ninety pieces of fine damasks, with about two
hundred pieces of other very fine silks, of several
sorts, some mixed with gold, and had all these brought
to Pekin against my partner's return: besides this, we
bought a very large quantity of raw silk, and some
other goods; our cargo amounting, in these goods
only, to about three thousand five hundred pounds
sterling, which, together with tea, and some fine
callicoes, andthreecamel-loads of nutmegs and cloves,
loaded in all eighteen camels for our share, besides
those we rode upon; which, with two or three spare
horses, and two horses loaded with provisions, made
us,
us, in short, twenty-six camels and horses in our
retinue.
The company was very great, and, as near as I can
remember, made between three and four hundred
horses and camels, and upward of an hundred and
twenty men, very well armed, and provided for all
events. For, as the eastern caravans are subject to
be attacked by the Arabs, so are these by the Tar.
tars; but they are not altogether so dangerous as the
Arabs, nor so barbarous when they prevail.
The company consisted of people of several nations,
such as Muscovites chiefly; for there were about sixty
of them who were merchants or inhabitants of Muf-
cow, though of them some were Livonians; and to
our particular satissaction, five of them were Scots,
who appeared also to be men of great experience in
business, and very good substance.
When we had travelled one day's journey, the
guides, who were five in number, called all the gen-
tlemen and merchants; that is to fay, all the passen-
gers, except the servants, to a great council, as they
termed it. At this great council every one deposited
a certain quantity of money to a common stock, for
the necessary expence of buying forage on the way,
where it was not otherwise to be had, and for satis-
fying the guides, getting horses, and the like. And
here they constituted the journey, as they called it,
viz. They named captains and osficers to draw us all
up, and give the command in case of an attack, and
gave every one their turn of command. Nor was
this forming us into order any more than what we
found needful upon the way, as shall be observed in
its place.
The
The road all on this fide of the country is very po-
pulous, and is full of potters and earth-makers; that
is to say, people that tempered the earth for the China
ware; and, as I was going along, our Portuguese
pilot, who had always something or other to say to
make us merry, came sneering to me, and told me,
he would shew the greatest rarity in all the country;
and that I should have this to say of China, after all
the ill-humoured things I had said of it, that I had
seen one thing which was not to be seen in all the
world beside. I was very importunate to know what
it was; at last he told me, it was a gentleman's house,
built all with China ware. Well, said I, are not the
materials of their building the product of their own
country; and so it is all China ware, is it not? No,
no, says he, I mean, it is a house all made of China
ware, such as you call so in England; or, as it is
called in our country, porcelain. Well, said I, such
a thing may be: How big is it; Can we carry it in
a box upon a camel? If we can, we will buy it.
Upon a camel! said the old pilot, holding up both
his hands, why there is a samily of thirty people
lives in it.
I was then curious, indeed, to see it; and when I
came to it, it was nothing but this: it was a timber
house, or a house built, as we call it in England, with
lath and plaister, but all the plaistering was really
China ware, that is to say, it was plaistered with the
earth that makes China ware.
The outside, which the fun shone hot upon, was.
glazed, and looked very well, perfectly white, and
painted with blue figures, as the large China ware
in England is painted, and hard, as if it had been
burnt.
burnt. As to the inside, all the walls, instead of
wainscot, were lined with hardened and painted tiles,
like the little square tiles we call gally tiles in England,
all made of the finest China, and the figures exceed-
ing sine indeed, with extraordinary variety of co-
lours, mixed with gold, many tiles making but one
figure, but joined so artificially with mortar, being
made of the same earth, that it was very hard to fee
where the tiles met. The floors of the rooms were
of the same composition, and as hard as the earthen
floors we have in use in several parts of England,
especially Lincolnshire, Nottinghamshire, Leicestershire,
Sec. as hard as stone, and smooth, but not burnt
and painted, except some smaller rooms, like closets,
which were all, as it were, paved with the same tile;
the cielings, and in a word, all the plaistering-work
in the whole house, were of the same earth; and,
after all, the roof was covered with tiles of the
same, but of a deep shining black.
This was a China warehouse indeed, truly and li-
terally to be called so; and, had I not been upon the
journey, I could have staid some days to fee and ex-
amine the particulars of it. They told me there
were fountains and fish-ponds in the garden, all
paved at the bottom and sides with the fame, and
fine statues set up in rows on the walks, entirely
formed of the porcelain earth, and burnt whole.
As this is one of the singularities of China, so
they may be allowed to excel in it; but I am very
sure, they excel in their accounts of it; for they
told me such incredible things of their perform-
ance in crockery-ware, for such it is, that I care
not to relate, as knowing it could not be true:—
One told me, in particular, of a workman that made
Vol. II. X a ship,
a ship, with all its tackle, and masts, and sails, in
earthen-ware, big enough to carry fifty men. If he
had told me he launched it, and made a voyage to
Japan in it, I might have said something to it indeed;
but as it was, I knew the whole story, which was,
in short, asking pardon for the word, that the fellow
lied; so I smiled, and said nothing to it.
This odd sight kept me two hours behind the ca-
ravan, for which the leader of it for the day fined
me about the value of three millings; and told me,
if it had been three days journey without the wall,
as it was three days within, he must have fined me
four times as much, and made me ask pardon th«
next council day: so I promised to be more orderly;
'for, indeed, I found afterwards the orders made for
306 LIFE AND ADVENTURES
common safety.
In two days more we passed the great China wall,
made for a fortification against the Tartars; and a
very great work it is, going over hills and moun-
tains in an endless track, where the rocks are impassa-
ble, and the precipices such as no enemy could pos-
sibly enter, or, indeed, climb up, or where, if they
did, no wall could hinder them. They tell us, its
length is near a thousand English miles, but that the
country is five hundred, in a straight measured line,
which the wall bounds, without measuring the
windings and turnings it takes: 'tis about four sa-
thom high, and as many thick in some places.
I stood still an hour, or thereabouts, without
trespassing on our orders, for so long the caravan
was in passing the gate; I say, I stood still an hour
to look at it, on every side, near, and sar off, I
mean,
mean, what was within my view; and the guide of
our caravan, who had been extolling it for the win-
der of the world, was mighty eager to hear my opi-
nion of it. I told him it was a most excellent thing
to keep off the Tartars, which he happened not to
understand as I meant it, and so took it for a com-
pliment: but the old pilot laughed i O Seignior Inglese,
said he, you speak in colours. In colours! said I,
what do you mean by that? Why you speak what
looks white this way, and black that way; gay one
way, and dull another way: you tell him it is a
good wall to keep out Tartars; you tell me, by that,
it is good for nothing but to keep out Tartars; or,
will keep out none but Tartars: I understand you,
Seignior Inglese, I understand you, said he, joking;
but Seignior Chinese understand you his own way.
Well said I, Seignior, do you think it would stand
out an army of our country people, with a good
train of artillery; or our engineers, with two com-
panies of miners? Would they not batter it down
in ten days, that an army might enter in battalia, or
blow it up into the air, foundation and all, that there
should be no sign of it left? Ay, ay, said he, I know
that. The Chinese wanted mightily to know what I
said, and I gave him leave to tell him a few days after,
for we were then almost out of their country, and
he was to leave us in a little time afterwards; but
when he knew what I had said, he was dumb all
the rest of the way, and we heard no more of his
fine story of the Chinese power and greatness while
he staid.
. After we had passed this mighty Nothing, called
a wall, something like the Picls wall, so samous in
Northumberland, and built by the Romans, we began
X 2 to
to find the country thinly inhabited, and the people
rather confined to live in fortified towns and cities,
as being subject to the inroads and depredations of
the Tartars, who rob in great armies, and there-
fore are not to be resisted by the naked inhabitants
of an open country.
And here I began to find the necessity of keeping
together in a caravan, as we travelled; for we saw
several troops of Tartars roving about; but when I
came to see them distinctly, I wondered how that the
Chinese empire could be conquered by such contempti-
ble fellows; for they are a mere herd or crowd of
wild fellows, keeping no order, and understanding
no discipline, or manner of sight.
Their horses are poor, lean, starved creatures,
. taught nothing, and are sit for nothing; and this
we found the first day we saw them, which was after
we entered the wilder part of the country. Our
leader for the day gave leave for about sixteen of us
to go a hunting, as they call it; and what was this
but hunting of sheep! However, it may be called
hunting too; for the creatures arc the wildest, and
swiftest of foot, that ever I saw of their kind; only
they will not run a great way, and you are sure of
sport when you begin the chace; for they appear ge-
nerally by thirty or forty in a flock, and, like true
sheep, always keep together when they fly.
In pursuit of this odd fort of game, it was our
hap to meet with about forty Tartars: Whether they
were hunting mutton as we wore, or whether they
looked for another kind of prey, I know not; but
as soon as they sow us, one of them blew a kind of
horn very loud, but with a barbarous found that I
had
had never heard before; and, by the way, never
care to hear again. We all supposed this was to call
their friends about them; and so it was; for in less
than half a quarter of an hour, a troop of forty or
fifty more appeared at about a mile distance; but
our work was over first, as it happened.
One of the Scots merchants of Moscow happened
to be amongst us; and as soon as he heard the horn,
he told us, in short, that we had nothing to do but
to charge them immediately, without loss of time;
and, drawing us up in a line, he asked, If we were
resolved? We told him, We were ready to follow
him: So he rode directly up to them. They stood
gazing at us, like a mere crowd, drawn up in no
order, nor shewing the sace of any order at all; but
as soon as they saw us advance, they let fly their ar-
rows; which, however, missed us very happily: It
seems they mistook not their aim, but their distance;
for their arrows all fell a little short of us, but with
so true an aim, that had we been about twenty yards
nearer, we must have had several men wounded, if
not killed.
Immediately we halted; and though it was at a
great distance, we fired, and sent them leaden bullets
for wooden arrows, following our shot full gallop,
resolving to sall in among them sword in hand; for
so our bold Scot that led us, directed. He was, in-
deed, but a merchant, but he behaved with that vi-
gour and bravery on this occasion, and yet with such
i cool courage too, that I never saw any man in action
sitter for command. As soon as we came up to them,
we fired our pistols in their saces, and then drew; but
they fled in the greatest confusion imaginable; the
X 3 only
only stand any of them made was on our right, where
three of them stood, and, by signs, called the rest
to come back to them, having a kind of scymitar in
their hands, and their bows hanging at their backs.
Our brave commander, without asking any body to
follow him, galloped up close to them, and with his
fusil knocked one of them off his horse, killed the
second with his pistol, and the third ran away; and
thus ended our fight; but we had this misfortune
attending it, viz. That all our mutton that we had
in chace got away. We had not a man killed or
hurt; but, as for the Tartars, there were about five
of them killed; how many were wounded, we knew
not; but this we knew, that the other party was so
frighted with the noise of our guns, that they fled,
and never made any attempt upon us.
We were all this while in the Chinese dominions,
and therefore the Tartars were not so bold as after-
wards; but in about five days we entered a vast
great wild desart, which held us three days and
nights march; and we were obliged to carry our
water with us in great leather bottles, and to encamp
all night, just as I have heard they do in the desarts
of Arabia.
I asked our guides, whose dominion this was in?
and they told me this was a kind of border that
might be called No Man's Land ; 'being, part of the
Great Karakathy, or Grand Tartary; but that, how-
ever, it was reckoned to China; that there was no
care taken here to preserve it from the inroads of
thieves; and therefore it was reckoned the worst desart
in the whole march, though we were to go over some
much larger.
i In
3"
In passing this wilderness, which, I confess, was
at the first view very frightful to me, we saw two
or three times little parties of the Tartars, but they
seemed to be upon their own asfairs, and to have no
design upon us; and so, like the man who met the
devil, if they had nothing to say to us, we had no-
thing to say to them; we let them go.
Once, however, a party of them came so near as
to stand and gaze at us; whether it was to consider
what they mould do, viz. to attack us, or not at-
tack us, we knew not.; but when we were passed at
some distance by them, we made a rear guard of forty
men, and stood ready for them, letting the caravan
pass half a mile, or thereabouts, before us: After a
while they marched off, only we found they assaulted
us with five arrows at their parting; one of which
wounded a horse, so that it disabled him; and we
left him the next day, poor creature, in great need
of a good sarrier. We suppose they might shoot more
arrows, which might fall short of us; but we saw no
more arrows, or Tartars, at that time.
We travelled near a month after this, the ways
being not so g6od as at first, though still in the do-
minions of the Emperor of China; but lay, for the
most part, in villages, some of which were fortified,
because of the incursions of the Tartars. When
we came to one of these towns (it was about two
days and a half's journey before we were to come to
the city of Naurii,J I wanted to buy a camel, of
which there are plenty to be sold all the way upon
that road, and of horses also, such as they are, be-
cause so many caravans coming that way, they are
X 4 . very
very often wanted. The person that I spoke to
to get me a camel, would have gone and fetched it
for me; but I, like a fool, must be officious, and
go myself along with him. The place was about
two miles out of the village, where, it seems, they
kept the camels and horses feeding under a guard.
I walked it on foot, with my old pilot in company,
and a Chinese, being desirous, forsooth, of a little va-
riety. When we came to this place, it was a low
marshy ground, walled round with a stone wall, piled
up dry, without mortar or earth among it, like a
park, with a little guard of Chinese soldiers at the
doors: Having bought a camel, and agreed for the
price, I came away; and the Chinese man, that went
with me, led the camel, when on a sudden came up
five Tartars on horseback; two of them seized the
fellow, and took the camel from him, while the
other three stepped up to me and my old pilot; seeing
us, as it were, unarmed, for I had no weapon about
me but my sword, which could but ill defend me
against three horsemen. The first that came up
stopped short upon my drawing my sword (for they
are arrant cowards;) but a second coming upon
my left, gave me a blow on the head, which I never
felt till afterwards, and wondered, when I came to
myself, what was the matter with me, and where I
was, for he laid me flat on the ground; but my ne-
ver-sailing old pilot, the Portuguese (so providence,
unlooked for, directs deliverances from dangers, which
to us are unforeseen,) had a pistol in his pocket,
which I knew nothing of, nor the Tartars neither;
if they had, I suppose they would not have attacked
us;
us ; but cowards are always boldest when there is no
danger.
The old man, seeing me down, with a bold heart
stepped up to the fellow that had struck me, and lay-
ing hold of his arm with one hand, and pulling him
down by main force a little towards him with the
other, he shot him into the head, and laid him dead
on the spot; he then immediately stepped up to him
who had stopped us, as I said, and before he could
come forward again (for it was all done as it were in
a moment) made a blow at him with a scymitar,
which he always wore, but, miffing the man, cut
his horse into the side of his head, cut one of his
ears off by the root, and a great slice down the side
of his sace. The poor beast, enraged with the
wounds, was no more to be governed by his rider,
though the fellow sat well enough too; but away he
flew, and carried him quite out of the pilot's reach;
and, at some distance, rising upon his hind legs, threw
down the Tartar, and fell upon him.
In this interval the poor Chinese came in, who had
lost the camel, but he had no weapon; however, see-
ing the Tarter down, and his horse sallen upon him,
he runs to hnn, and seizing upon an ugly ill-savoured
weapon he had by his side, something like a pole-
axe, but not a pole-axe either, he wrenched it from
him, and made shift to knock his Tartarian brains
out with it. But my old man had the third Tartar
to deal with still; and, seeing he did not fly as he
expected, nor come on to fight him, as he appre-
hended, but stood stock still, the old man stood still
too, and salls to work with his tackle to charge his
pistol again: but as soon as the Tartar saw the
4 pistol,
pistol, whether he supposed it to be the same or ano-
ther, I know not; but away he scoured, and left
my pilot, my champion I called him afterwards, a
complete victory.
By this time I was a little awake; for I thought,
when I first began to awake, that I had been in a
sweet sleep; but, as I said above, I wondered where
I was, how I came upon the ground, and what was
the matter: in a word, a few minutes after, as fense
returned, I felt pain, though I did not know where;
I clapped my hand to my head, and took it away
bloody; then I felt my head ache; and then, in
another moment, memory returned, and every thing
was present to me again.
I jumped up upon my feet instantly, and got hold
of my sword, but no enemies in view. I found a
Tartar lie dead, and his horse standing very quietly
by him; and looking sarther, I saw my champion
and deliverer, who had been to see what the Chinese
had done, coining back with his hanger in his hand.
The old man, seeing me on my feet, came running to
me, and embraced me with a great deal of joy, being
afraid before that I had been killed; and seeing me
bloody, would see how I was hurt; but it was not
much, only what we call a broken head; neither
did I afterwards find any great inconvenience from
the blow, other than the place which was hurt, and
which was well again in two or three days.
We made no great gain, however, by this victory;
for we lost a camel, and gained a horse: but that
which was remarkable, when we came back to the
village, the man demanded to be paid for the ca-
mel;
mel; I disputed it, and it was brought to a hearing
before the Chinese judge of the place; that is to say,
in English, we went before a justice of the peace.
Give him his due, he acted with a great deal of pru-
dence and impartiality; and having heard both sides,
he gravely asked the Chinese man that went with me
to buy the camel, whose servant he was? 1 am no
servant said he, but went with the stranger. At
whose request? said the justice. At the stranger's
request, said he. Why then, said the justice, you
were the stranger's servant for the time ; and the
camel being delivered to his servant, it was delivered
to him, and he must pay for it.
I confess the thing was so clear, that I had
not a word to say; but admiring to fee such just
reasoning upon the consequence, and so accurate
stating the case, I paid willingly for the camel, and
sent for another; but you may observe, /sent for it;
I did not go to fetch it myself any more; I had
enough of that.
The city of Naum is a frontier of the Chinese em-
pire: they call it fortified, and so it is, as fortifica-
tions go there; for this I will venture to asfirm, that
all the Tartars in Karakathay, which, I believe, are
some millions, could not batter down the walls with
their bows and arrows; but to call it strong, if it
were attacked with cannon, would be to make those
who understand it laugh at you.
We wanted, as I have said, above two days jour-
ney of this city, when messengers were sent express
to every part of the road, to tell all travellers and
caravans to halt, till they had a guard sent to them;
for
for that an unusual body of Tartars, making ten
thousand in all, had appeared in the way, about
thirty miles beyond the city.
This was very bad news to travellers; however,
it was carefully done of the governor, and we were
very glad to hear we mould have a guard. Accord-
ingly, two days after, we had 200 soldiers sent us
from a garrison of the Chinese on our left, and three
hundred more from the city of Naum, and with those
we advanced boldly: the three hundred soldiers from
Naum marched in our front, the two hundred in our
rear, and our men on each fide of our camels with
our baggage, and the whole caravan in the centre:
in this order, and well prepared for battle, we thought
ourselves a match for the whole ten thousand Mogul
Tartars, if they had appeared; but the next day,
when they did appear, it was quite another thing.
It was early in the morning, when marching from
a little well-situated town, called Cbangu, w e had a
river to pass, where we were obliged to ferry; and
had the Tartars had any intelligence, then had been
the time to have attacked us, when, the caravan
being over, the rear guard was behind: but they
did not appear there.
About three hours after, when we were entered upon
a desart of about fifteen or sixteen miles over, be-
hold, by a cloud of dust they raised, we saw an
enemy was at hand; and they were at hand indeed,
for they came on upon the spur.
The Chinese, our guard on the front, who had
tasked so big the day before, began to stagger, and
the soldiers frequently looked behind them; which is
a certain sign in a soldier, that he is just ready to run
away.
away. My old pilot was of my mind; and being
near me, he called out: Seignior Inglese, said he,
those fellows must be encouraged, or they will ruin
us all; for if the Tartars come on, they will never
stand it. I am of your mind, said I: But what
course must be done? Done, said he; let fifty of our
men advance, and flank them on each wing, and
encourage them, and they will sight like brave fel-
lows in brave company; but without it, they will
every man turn his back. Immediately I rode up to
our leader, and told him, who was exactly of our
mind; and accordingly fifty of us marched to the
right wing, and fifty to the left, and the rest made a
line of reserve; for so we marched, leaving the last
two hundred men to make another body to them-
selves, and to guard the camels; only that, if need
were, they should fend an hundred men to assist the
last fifty.
In a word, the Tartars came on, and an innume-
rable company they were; how many, we could not
tell, but ten thousand we thought was the least. A
party of them came on first, and viewed our posture,
traversing the ground in the front of our line; and as
we found them within gun-shot, our leader ordered
the two wings to advance swiftly, and give them a
salvo on each wing with their snot, which was done;
but they went off, and I suppose went back to give
an account of the reception they were like to meet
with; anJ, indeed, that salute clogged their sto-
machs; for they immediately halted, stood awhile
to consider of it, and, wheeling off to the left, they
gave over the design, and said no more to us for
that time; which was very agreeable to our circum-
stances,
stances, which were but very indifferent for a battle
with such a number.
Two days after this we came to the city of Naum,
or Naunm: We thanked the governor for his care for
us, and collected to the value of 100 crowns, or
thereabouts, which we gave to the soldiers sent to
guard us; and here we rested one day. This is a
garrison indeed, and there were nine hundred sol-
diers kept here; but the reason of it was, that for-
merly the Muscovite frontiers lay nearer to them than
they do now, the Muscovites having abandoned that
part of the country (which lies from the city west,
for about two hundred miles) as desolate and unfit
for use; and more especially, being so very remote*
and so difficult to send troops hither for its defence;
for we had yet above two thousand miles to Muscovy,
properly so called.
After this we passed several great rivers, and two
dreadful desarts, one of which we were sixteen days
passing over, and which, as I said, was to be called
No Man's Land; and on the 13th of April, we came
to the frontiers of the Muscovite dominions. I think
the first city, or town, or fortress, whatever it might be
called, that belonged to the Czar of Muscovy, was
called Argun, being on the west side of the river
Argun.
I could not but discover an infinite satissaction,
that I was now arrived in, as I called it, a Christian
country; or, at least, in a country governed by
Christians: for though the Muscovites do, in my opi-
nion, but just deserve the name of Christians; (yet
such they pretend to be, and are very devout in their
way);
3*9
way); it would certainly occur to any man who
travels the world as I have done, and who had any
power of reflection; I say, it would occur to him,
to reflect, what a blessing it is to be brought into the
world where the name of God, and of a Redeemer,
is known, worshipped, and adored—and not where
the people, given up by Heaven to strong delusions,
worfcip the devil, and prostrate themselves to stocks
and stones; worship monsters, elements, horrible
shaped animals, and statues, or images of monsters.
Not a town or city we passed through but had their
pagods, their idols, and their temples; and ignorant
people worshipping even the works of their own hands!
Now we came where, at least, a sace of the
Christian worship appeared, where the knee was
bowed to Jesus; and whether ignorantly or not,
yet the Christian religion was owned, and the name
of the true God was called upon and adored; and
it made the very recesses of my foul rejoice to fee it.
I saluted the brave Scotch merchant I mentioned
above, with my first acknowledgment of this; and,
taking him by the hand, I said to him, Blessed be
God, we are once again come among Christians!
He smiled, and answered, Do not rejoice too soon,
countryman; these Muscovites are but an odd sort of
Christians; and but for the name of it, you may fee
very little of the substance for some months far-
ther of our journey.
Well, said I, but still it is better than paganism,
and worshipping of devils. Why, I'll tell you, said
he; Except the Ruffian soldiers in garrisons, and a
few of the inhabitants of the cities upon the road,
all
all the rest of this country, for above a thousand
miles sarther, is inhabited by the worst .and most
ignorant of pagans: and so indeed we found it.
We were now launched into the greatest piece of
solid earth, if I understand any thing of the sursace
of the globe, that is to be found in any part of the
world: we had at least twelve hundred miles to the
sea, eastward; we had at least two thousand to the
bottom of the Balk sea, westward; and almost three
thousand miles, if we left that sea, and went on west
to the British and French channels; we had full five
thousand miles to the Indian or Persian sea, south; and
about eight hundred miles to the frozen sea, north:
nay, if some people may be believed, there might be
no sea north-east till we came round the pole, and
consequently into the north-west, and so had a con-
tinent of land into America, no mortal knows where;
though I could give some reasons why I believe that
to be a mistake too.
As we entered into the Muscovite dominions, a
good while before we came to any considerable town,
we had nothing to observe there but this: first, that
all the rivers run to the east. As I understood by the
charts which some of our caravans had with them,
it was plain that all those rivers ran into the great
river Tamour, or Gammour. This river, by the
natural course of it, must run into the east sea, ot
Chinese ocean. The story they tell us, that the
mouth of this river is choaked up with bulrushes of a
monstrous growth, viz. three feet about, and twenty
or thirty feet high, I must be allowed to say, I be-
lieve nothing of; but as its navigation is of no use,
because
because there is no trade that, way, the Tartars, to
whom alone it belongs, dealing in nothing but cattle;
so nobody that ever I heard of, has been curious
enough either to go down to the mouth of it in boats,
or to come up from the mouth of it in ships; but
this is certain, that this river running due east, in
the latitude of 60 degrees, carries a vast concourse
of rivers along with it, and finds an ocean to empty
itself in that latitude; so we are sure of sea there.
Some leagues to the north of this river there are
several considerable rivers, whose streams run as due
north as the Yamour runs east; and these are all found
to join their waters with the great river Tartarus,
named so from the northermost nations of the Mogul
Tartars, who, the Chinese say, were the first Tartars
in the world; and who, as our geographers alledge,
are the Gog and Magog mentioned in sacred story.
These rivers running all northward, as well as all
the other rivers I am yet to speak of, made it evident
that the northern ocean bounds the land also on that
side; so that it does not seem rational in the least to
think that the land can extend itself to join with
America on that side, or that there is not a commu-
nication between the northern and the eastern ocean;
but of this I shall say no more; it was my observation
at that time, and therefore I take notice of it in this
place. We now advanced from the river Arguna by
easy and moderate journeys, and were very visibly
obliged to the care the czar of Muscovy has taken
to have cities and towns built in as many places as are
possible to place them, where his soldiers keep garri-
son, something like the stationary soldiers placed
Vol. Is. Y by
by the Romans in the remotest countries of their
empire, some of which 1 had read were particularly
placed in Britain for the security of commerce, and
for the lodging of travellers; and thus it was here;
for wherever we came, though at these towns and
stations, the garrisons and governor were Ruffians
and professed mere pagans, sacrisicing to idols, and
worshipping the sun, moon, and stars, or all the
host of heaven; and not only so, but were, of all
the heathens and pagans that ever I met with, the
most barbarous, except only that they did not eat
man's flesh, as our savages of America did.
Some instances of this we met with in the
country between Arguna, where we enter the Mus-
covite dominions, and a city of Tartars and Ruffians
together, called Nertzinftay; in which space is a
continued desart or forest, which cost us twenty
days to travel over it. In a village, near the last
of those places, I had the curiosity to go and see
their way of living; which is most brutish and un-
sufferable: they had, I suppose, a great sacrifice that
day; for there stood out upon an old stump of a
tree, ;m idol made of wood, frightful as the devil;
at least as any thing we can think of to represent the
devil that can be made: It had an head certainly not
so much as resembling any creature that the world
ever saw; ears as big as goats horns, and as high;
eyes as big as a crown piece; and a nose like a
crooked ram's horn, and a mouth extended four-
cornered, like that of a lion, with horrible teeth,
hooked like a parrot's under bill. It was dressed up
in the filthiest manner that you can suppose; its up-
2 per
per garment was of sheep-skins, with the wool out-
ward; a great Tartar bonnet on the head, with two
horns growing through it: it was about eight feet
high, yet had no feet or legs, or any other propor-
tion of parts.
This scarecrowwas set upatthe outsideof thevillage;
and when I came near to it, there were sixteen or
seventeen creatures, whether men or women I could
not tell, for they make no distinction by their habits,
either of body or head; these lay all flat on the
ground, round this formidable block of shapeless
wood. I saw no motion among them any more than
if they had been logs of woods like their idol; at
first I really thought they had been so; but when I
came a little nearer, they started up upon their feet;
and raised an howling cry, as if it had been so
many deep-mouthed hounds, and walked away as
if they were displeased at our disturbing them. A
little way osf from this monster, and at the door of
a tent or hut, made all of sheep-skins and cow-skins,
dried, stood three butchers: I thought they were
such; for when I came nearer to them, I found they
had long knives in their hands, and in the middle
of the tent appeared three sheep killed, and one
young bullock, or steer. These, it seems, were sa-
crifices to that senseless log of an idol; and these
three men priests belonging to it; and the seventeen
prostrated wretches were the people who brought
the offering, and were making their prayers to that
stock.
I confess I was more moved at their stupidity, and
this brutiih worship of an hobgoblin, than ever I
Y 2 was
was at any thing in my life: to fee God's most; glo-
rious and best creature, to whom he had granted so
many advantages, even by creation, above the rest
of the works of his hands, vested with a reasonable
soul, and that soul adorned with saculties and capa-
cities adapted both to honour his Maker and be ho-
noured by him; I say, to fee it funk and degenerated
to a degree so more than stupid, as to prostrate itself
to a frightful nothing, a mere imaginary object dressed
up by themselves, and made terrible to themselves
by their own contrivance, adorned only with clouts
and rags; and that this mould be the effect of mere
ignorance, wrought up into hellish devotion by the
devil himself; who, envying his Maker the homage and
adoration of his creatures, had deluded them into
such gross, surfeiting, sordid, and bruitish things, as
one would think mould shock nature itself.
But what signified all the astonishment and reflec-
tion of thoughts? Thus it was, and I saw it before
my eyes; and there was no room to wonder at it,
or think it impossible. All my admiration turned to
rage; and I rode up to the image or monster, call
it what you will, and with my sword cut the bonnet
that was on its head in two in the middle, so that it
hung down by one of the horns; and one of our
men that was with me, took hold of the sheep-stun
that covered it, and pulled at it, when, behold, a most
hideous outcry and howling ran through the village,
and two or three hundred people came about my
ears, so that I was glad to scour for it; for we saw
some had bows and arrows; but I resolved from
that moment to visit them again.
Our
Our caravan rested three nights at the town,
which was about four miles off, in order to provide
some horses, which they wanted, several of the
horses having been lamed and jaded with the badness
of the way, and our long march over the last de-
sart; so we had some leisure here to put my design
in execution. I communicated my project to the
Scuts merchant, of Moscow, of whose courage I had
a susficient testimony, as above. I told him what I
had seen, and with what indignation I had since
thought, that human nature could be so degenerate.
I told him, I was resolved, if I could get but four
or five men well armed to go with me, to go and
destroy that vile, abominable idol; to let them see,
that it had no power to help itself, and consequently
could not be an object of worship, or to be prayed
to, much less help them that offered sacrifices to it.
He laughed at me: said he, Your zeal may be
good; but what do you propose to yourself by it?
Propose! said I; to vindicate the honour of God,
which is insulted by this devil-worship. But how
will it vindicate the honour of God? said he, while
the people will not be able to know what you mean
by it, unless you could speak to them too, and
tell them so; and then they will fight you too, I will
assure you; for they are desperate fellows, and that
especially in defence of their idolatry. Can we not,
said I, do it in the night, and then leave them the
reasons in writing, in their own language? Writing!
said he, why there is not in five nations of them,
one man that knows any thing of a letter, or how
to read a word in any language, or in their own.
Y 3 Wretched
Wretched ignorance! said I to him; however, I
have a great mind to do it; perhaps nature may
draw inferences from it to them, to let them fee how
brutish they are to worship such horrid things. Look
you, Sir, said he, if your zeal prompts you to it so
warmly, you must do it; but, in the next place, I
would have you consider these wild nations of people
are subjected by force to the czar of Muscovy's do-
minions; and if you do this, it is ten to one but
they will come by thousands to the governor of
Nertzinftay, and complain, and demand satissaction;
and if he cannot give them satissaction, it is ten to
one but they revolt; and it will occasion a new
war with all the Tartars in the country.
This, I confess, put new thoughts into my head
for a while; but I harped upon the same string still;
and all that day I was uneasy to put my project in
execution. Towards the evening, the Scots merchant
met me by accident in our walk about the town,
and defired to speak with me: I believe, said he,
I have put you osf your good design; I have been
a little concerned about it since; for I abhor the
idol and idolatry as much as you can do. Truly,
said I, you have put it oft' a little as to the execution
of it, but you have not put it all out of my thoughts;
and, I believe, I shall do it still before I quit this
place, though I were to be delivered up to them for
satissaction. No, no, said he; God forbid they
should deliver you up to such a crew of monsters!
they shall not do that neither; that would be mur-
dering you indeed. Why, said I, how would they
use me? Use you! said he; I'll tell you how they
served a poor Ruffian, who affronted them in their
worship
•worship just as you did, and whom they took pri-
soner, after they had lamed him with an arrow, that
he could not run away; they took him and stripped
him stark naked, and set him upon the top of the
idol monster, and stood all round him, and shot as
many arrows into him as would stick over his whole
body; and then they burnt him and all the arrows
sticking in him, as a sacrifice to the idol. And was
this the same idol? said I. Yes, said he, the very
same. Well, said I, I will tell you a story: So I
related the story of our men at Madagascar, and how
they burnt and sacked the village there, and killed
man, woman, and child, for their murdering one of
our men, just as it is related before; and when I
had done, I added, that I thought we ought to do
so to this village.
He listened very attentively to the story; but when
I talked of doing so to that village, said he, you mis-
take very much; it was not this village, it was al-
most an hundred miles from this place; but it was
the same idol, for they carry him about in procession
all over the country. Well, said I, then that idol
ought to be punished for it; and it shall, said I, if I
live this night out.
In a word, finding me resolute, he liked the de-
sign, and told me, I should not go alone, but he
would go with me; but he would go first, and bring
a stout fellow, one of his countrymen, to go also
with us; and one, said he, as samous for his zeal
as you can defire any one to be against such devilish
things as these. In a word, he brought me his com-
rade, a Scotsman, whom he called Captain Richard-
son; and I gave him a full account of what I had
Y 4 seen,
seen, and also of what I intended; and he told me
readily, he would go with me, if it cost him his life.
So we agreed to go, only we three. I had, indeed}
proposed it to my partner; but he declined it. He
said, he was ready to assist me to the utmost, and
upon all occasions, for my defence; but that this
was an adventure quite out of his way : so, I say,
we resolved upon our work, only we three, and my
man-servant, and to put it in execution that night
about midnight, with all the secrecy imaginable.
However, upon second thoughts, we were willing
to delay it till the next night, because the caravan
being to set forward in the morning, we supposed the
governor could not pretend to give them any satis-
faction upon us when we were out of his power.—
The Scots merchant, as steady in his resolution to en-
terprize it as bold in executing, brought me a Tar-
tar's robe or gown of sheep-skins, and a bonnet,
with a bow and arrows, and had provided the same
for himself and his countryman, that the people, if
they saw us, should not be able to determine who we
were.
All the first night we spent in mixing up some
combustible matter with aqua-vitæ, gunpowder, and
such other materials as we could get; and, having
a good quantity of tar in a little pot, about an hour
after night we set out upon our expedition.
We came to the place about eleven o'clock at
night, and found that the people had not the least
jealousy of danger attending their idol; the night
was cloudy; yet the moon gave us light enough to
fee that the idol stood just in the same posture and
place that it did before. The people seemed to be
1 all
all at their rest; only, that in the great hut, or tent
as we called it, where we saw the three priests, whom
we mistook for butchers, we sa* a light, and, go-
ing up close to the door, we heard people talking,
as if there were five or fix of them; we concluded
therefore, that if we set wild-fire to the idol, these
men would come out immediately, and run up to the
place to rescue it from the destruction that we intended
for it; and what to do with them we knew not. Once
we thought of carrying it away, and setting fire to it
at a distance; but when we came to handle it, we
found it too bulky for our carriage; so we were at
a loss again. The second Scotsman was for setting
fire to the tent or hut, and knocking the creatures
that were there on the head, when they came out;
but I could not join with that; I was against killing
them, if it was possible to be avoided. Well then,
said the Scots merchant, I will tell you what we will
do; we will try to make them prisoners, tie their
hands, and make them stand and fee their idol
destroyed.
As it happened, we had twine or packthread
enough about us, which we used to tie our fire-
works together with; so we resolved to attack these
people first, and with as little noise as we could.
The first thing we did, we knocked at the door,
when one ol the priests coming to it, we immediate-
ly seized upon him, stopped his mouth, and tied his
hands behind him and led him to the idol, where we
gagged him that he might not make a noise; tied
his feet also together, and left him on the ground.
Two of us then waited at the door, expecting that
another would come out to fee what the matter
was;
was; but we waited so long till the third man came
back to us; ' and then, nobody coming out, we
knocked again gently, and immediately out came
two more, and we served them just in the same man-
ner, but were obliged to go all with them, and lay
them down by the idol some distance from one
another; when, going back, we found two more
were come out to the door, and a third stood
behind them within the door. We seized the two,
and immediately tied them: when the third stepping
back, and crying out, my Scots merchant went in
after him, and taking out a composition we had
made, that would only smoke and stink, he set
sire to it, and threw it in among them: by that time
the other Scotsman and my man taking charge of the
two men already bound, and tied together also by
the arm, led them away to the idol, and left them
there, to see if their idol would relieve them, making
haste back to us.
When the furze we had thrown in had silled the
hut with so much smoke that they were almost susfo-
cated, we then threw in a small leather bag of
another kind, which flamed like a candle, and, fol-
lowing it in, we found there were but four people
left, who, it seems, were two men and two women,
and, as we supposed, had been about some of their
diabolic sacrifices. They appeared, in short, fright-
ed to death, at least so as to sit trembling and stupid,
and not able to speak neither, for the smoke.
In a word, we took them, bound them as we had
the other, and all without any noise. I should have
said, we brought them out of the house, or hut, first;
for, indeed, we were not able to bear the smoke any
more
331
more than they were. When we had done this, we
carried them altogether to the idol: when we came
there we fell to work with him; and first we daubed
him all over, and his robes also, with tar, and such
other stuff as we had, which was tallow mixed with
brimstone; then we stopped his eyes, and ears, and
mouth full of gunpowder; then we wrapped up a
great piece of wildfire in his bonnet; and then stick-
ing all the combustibles we had brought with us upon
him, we looked about to fee if we could find any
thing else to help to burn him; when my Scotsman
remembered, that by the tent, or hut, where the
men were, there lay a heap of dry forage, whether
straw or rushes I do not remember: away he and
the other Scotsman ran, and fetched their arms full of
that. When we had done this, we took all our pri-
soners, and brought them, having untied their feet,
and ungagged their mouths, and made them stand
up, and set them just before their monstrous idol,
and then set fire to the whole.
We stayed by it a quarter of an hour," or there-
abouts, till the powder in the eyes, and mouth, and
ears of the idol blew up, and, as we could perceive,
had split and deformed the shape of it; and, in a
word, till we saw it burnt into a mere block or log
of wood; and then setting the dry forage io it, we
found it would be soon quite consumed; so we began
to think of going away; but the Scotsman said: No,
we must not go; for these poor deluded wretches
will all throw themselves into the fire, and burn
themselves with the idol; so we resolved to stay till
the forage was burnt down too, and then we came
away and left them.
-
In the morning we appeared among our fellow
travellers, exceeding busy in getting ready for our
journey; nor could any man suggest that we had been
anywhere but in our beds, as travellers might be
supposed to be, to fit themselves for the satigues of
that day's journey.
But it did not end so; for the next day came a
great multitude of the country people, not only of
this village, but of an hundred more, for aught I
know, to the town gates; and, in a most outrageous
manner, demanded satissaction of the Ruffian gover-
nor, for the insulting their priests, and burning their
great Cham-Chi-Thaungu; such an hard name they
gave the monstrous creature they worshipped: the
people of Nertzinffay were at first in a great conster-
nation; for, they said, the Tartars were no less than
thirty thousand, arid that in a few days more, they
would be one hundred thousand stronger.
The Ruffian governor sent out messengers to ap-
pease them, and gave them all the good words ima-
ginable. He assured them he knew nothing of it,
and that there had not a foul of his garrison been
abroad; that it could not be from any body there;
and if they would let him know who it was, they
should be exemplaiily punished. They returned
haughtily, That all the country reverenced the
great Cham-Chi-Thaungu, who dwelt in the sun, and
no mortal would have dared to offer violence to his
image, but some Christian miscreant; so they called
them, it seems, and they therefore denounced war
against him, and all the Riiffians, who, they said,
were miscreants and Christians.
The
The governor, still patient, and unwilling to
make a breach, or to have any cause of war alledged
to be given by him, the czar having straightly charged
him to treat the conquered country with gentleness
and civility, gave them still all the good words he
could; at last he told them, there was a caravan
gone towards Russia that morning, and perhaps it
was some of them who had done them this injury;
and that, if they would be satisfied with that, he
would fend after them, to enquire into it. This
seemed to appease them a little; and accordingly
the governor sent after us, and gave us a particular
account how the thing was; intimating, withal, that
if any in our caravan had done it, they should make
their escape; but that, whether they had done it or
no, we should make all the haste forward that
was possible; and that in the mean time, he would
keep them in play as long as he could.
This was very friendly in the governor. How-
ever, when it came to the caravan, there was no-
body knew any thing of the matter; and, as for us
that were guilty, we were the least of all suspected;
none so much as asked us the question; ho wever, the
captain of the caravan, for the time, took the hint
that the governor gave us, and we marched or tra-
velled two days and two nights without any conside-
rable stop, and then we lay at a village called
Platbus; nor did we make any long stop here, but
hastened on towards Jarawena, another of the czar
of Muscovy's colonies, and where we expected we
mould be safe; but it is to be observed, that here
we began, for two or three days march, to enter
upon a vast nameless desart, of which I shall say more
in
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
in its place; and which if we had now been upon
is more than probable, we had been all destroyed.
It was the second day's march from-Plotbus, that by
the clouds of dust behind us at a great distance, some
of our people began to be sensible we were pursued;
we had entered the desart, and had passed by a great
lake, called Schanks OJier, when we perceived a very
great body of horse appear on the other side of the
lake to the north, we travelling west. We ob-
served they went away west, as we did; but had sup-
posed we mould have taken that side of the lake,
whereas we very happily took the south side; and in
two days more we saw them not, for they, believing
we were still before them, pushed on, till they came
to the river Udda: This is a very great river when it
passes sarther north; but when we came to it, we
found it narrow and fordable.
The third day they either found their mistake, of
had intelligence of us, and came pouring in upon
us, towards the dusk of the evening. 'We had, to
our great satissaction, just pitched upon a place for
our camp, which was very convenient for the night;
for as we were upon a desart, though but at the be-
ginning of it, that was above five hundred miles over,
we had no towns to lodge at, and, indeed, expected
none but the city 'Jarawcna, which we had yet two
days march to; the desart, however, had some few
woods in it on this side, and little rivers, which ran
all into the great river Udda. It was in a narrow
strait between two small, but very thick woods,
that we pitched our little camp for that night, ex-
pecting to be attacked in the night.
N Nobody
335
Nobody knew but ourselves what we were pursued
for; but as it was usual for the Mogul Tartars to go
about in troops in that desart, so the caravans al-
ways fortify themselves every night against them, as
against armies of robbers: and it was therefore no
new thing to be pursued.
But we had this night, of all the nights of our tra-
vels, a most advantageous camp; for we lay between
two woods, with a little rivulet running just before
our front; so that we could not be surrounded or
attacked any way, but in our front or rear: we took
care also to make our front as strong as we could, by
placing our packs, with our camels and horses, all
in a line on the side of the river, and we felled some
trees in our rear.
In this posture we encamped for the night; but
the enemy was upon us before we had finished our
situation: they did not come on us like thieves, as
we expected, but sent three messengers to us, to
demand the men to be delivered to them, that had
abused their priests, and burnt their god Cbam-Cbi-
Tbaungu, that they might burn them with fire; and,
upon this, they said, they would go away, and do
us no sarther harm, otherwise they would burn us
all with fire. Our men looked very blank at this
message, and began to stare at one another, to fee
who looked with most guilt in their saces, but, no-
body was the word, nobody did it. The leader of
the caravan sent word, he was well assured it was not
done by any of our camp; that we were peaceable
merchants, travelling on our business; that we had
done no harm to them, or to any one else; and
therefore they must look sarther for their enemies,
who
who had injured them, for we were not the people;
so defired them not to disturb us; for if they did,
we mould defend ourselves.
They were sar from being satisfied with this for an
answer, and a great crowd of them came down in
the morning, by break of day, to our camp; but,
seeing us in such an advantageous situation, they
durst come no sarther than the brook in our front,
where they stood, and shewed us such a number, as,
indeed, terrified us very much; for those that spoke
least of them, spoke of ten thousand. Here they
stood, and looked at us a while, and then setting up
a great howl, they let fly a cloud of arrows among
us; but we were well enough fortified for that, for
we were sheltered under our baggage; and I do not
remember that one man of us was hurt.
Some time after this, we saw them move a little
to our right, and expected them on the rear, when
a cunning fellow, a Co/sack, as they call them, of
"Jara'wena, in the pay of the Muscovites, calling to
the leader of the caravan, said to him, I will send
all these people away to Sibeilka: This was a city four
or five days journey, at least to the south, and rather
behind us. So he takes his bow and arrows, and,
getting on horseback, he rides away from our rear
directly, as it were, back to Ncrtzinskay; after this,
he takes a great circuit about, and comes to the army
of the Tartars, as if he had been sent express to
tell them a long story, that the people who had
burnt their Cham-Chi-Tbaungu were gone to Sibeilka,
with a caravan of miscreants, as he called them;
that is to say, Christians; and that they were re-
solved
solved to burn the god Seal Isarg, belonging to the
Tongujcs.
As this fellow was a mere Tartar, and perfectly
spoke their language, he counterfeited so well, that
they all took it from him, and away they drove, in
a most violent hurry, to Sibeilka, which, it seems,
was five days journey to the south; and in less than
three hours they were entirely out of our sight,
and we never heard any more of them, nor ever
knew whether they went to that other place called
Sibeilka, or no.
So we passed safely on to the city of Jaraivena^
where there was a garrison of Muscovites; and there
we rested five days, the caravan being exceedingly
satigued with the last day's march, and with want
of rest in the night.
From this city we had a frightful desart, which
held us three-and-twenty days march. We furnished
ourselves with some tents here, for the better ac-
commodating ourselves in the night; and the leader
of the caravan procured sixteen carriages, or wag-
gons, of the country, for carrying o.ur water and *
provisions; and these carriages were our defence
every night round our little camp; so that had the
Tartars appeared, unless they had been very nume-
rous indeed, they would not have been able to hurt
us.
We may well be supposed to want rest again after
this long journey; for in this desart we saw nei-
ther house or tree, or scarce a bush; we saw, indeed,
abundance of the sable-hunters, as they called them:
These are all Tartars of the Mogul Tartary, of which
this country is a part; and they frequently attack
Vol. II. ' Z small
small caravans; but we saw no numbers of them to-
gether. I was curious to fee the sable-skins they
catched; but I could never speak with any of them;
for they durst not come near us; neither durst we
straggle from our company to go near them.
After we had passed this desart, we came into a
country pretty well inhabited; that is to say, we
found towns and castles settled by the czar of Mus-
covy , with garrisons of stationary soldiers to protect
the caravans, and defend the country against the
Tartars, who would otherwise make it very dan-
gerous travelling; and his czarish majesty has given
such strict orders for the well guarding the caravans
and merchants, that if there are any Tartars heard
of in the country, detachments of the garrison are
always sent to see travellers safe from station to sta-
tion.
And thus the governor of Adinskoy, whom I had
an opportunity to make a visit to, by means of the
Scots merchant, who was acquainted with him, of-
fered us a guard of fifty men, if we thought there
was any danger, to the next station.
I thought long before this, that as we came nearer
to Europe, we should find the country better peopled,
and the people more civilized; but I found myself
mistaken in both, for we had yet the nation of the
Tongucses to pass through; where we saw the same
tokens of paganism and barbarity, or v, orse, than
before; only as they were conquered by the Mus-
covites, and entirely reduced, they were not so dan-
gerous; but for the rudeness of manners, idolatry,
and polytheism, no people in the world ever went
beyond them. They are clothed all in skins of
beasts,
beasts, and their houses are built of the fame.
You know not a man from a woman, neither by
the ruggednefs of their countenances, or their
clothes; and in the winter, when the ground is co-
vered with snow, they live under ground, in houses
like vaults, which have cavities of caves going from
one to another.
If the Tartars had their Cham-Cbi-Thaungu for a
whole village, or country, these had idols in every
hut, and every cave; besides, they worship the
stars, the fun, the water, the snow; and, in a word,
every thing that they do not understand, and they
understand but very little; so that almost every ele-
ment, every uncommon thing, sets them a sacri-
ficing.
But I am no more to describe people than coun-
tries, any sarther than my own story comes to be
concerned in them. I met with nothing peculiar
to myself in all this country, which, I reckon was,
from the desart which I spoke of last, at least four
hundred miles, half of it being another desart,
which took us up twelve days severe travelling,
without house, tree or bush; but were obliged again
to carry our o,wn provisions, as well water as bread.
After we were out of this desart, and had tra-
velled two days, we came to yanezay, a Musco-
vite city or station, on the great river jfanczay.
This river, they told us, parted Europe from Asia,
though our map-makers, as I am told, do not agree
to it; however, it is certainly the eastern boundary
of the antient Siberia, which now makes a province
only of the vast Muscovite empire, but is itself equal
in bigness to the whole empire of Germany.
Z 2 And
f And ret here I observed ignorance and paganism
'still prevailed, except in the Muscovite garrisons:
All Lhe country between the river Oby, and the river
jsa..iezay, is as entirely pagan, and the people as bar-
barous, as the remotest of the Tartars; nay, as
any nation, for aught I know, in Asia or America.
I also found, which I observed to the Muscovite go-
vernors, whom I had opportunity to converse with,
that the pagans are not much the wiser, or the nearer
Christianity, for being under the Muscovite go-
vernment; which they acknowledged was true
enough, but, they said, it was none of their bu-
siness ; that if the czar expected to convert his Si-
berian, or Tongurse, or Tartar subjects, it should be
done by sending clergymen among them, not so!-
diers; and they added, with more sincerity than I
expected, that they found it was not so much the con-
cern of their monarch to make the people Christians,
as it was to make them subjects.
From this river to the great river Oby, we crossed
a wild uncultivated country; I cannot say 'tis a bar-
barous soil; 'tis only barren of people, and wants good
management; otherwise it is in itself a most
pleasant, fruitful, and agreeable country. What
inhabitants we found in it are all pagans, except
such as are sent among them from Russia; for this
is the country, I mean on both sides the river Oby,
whither the Muscovite criminals, that are not put
to death, arc banished, and from whence it is next
to impossible they should ever come away.
I have nothing material to say of my particular
affairs, till I came to Tobolsk'^ the capital of Si-
berij,
beria, where I continued some time on the following
occasion :—
We had been now almost seven months on our
journey, and winter began to come on apace;
whereupon my partner and I called a council about
our particular asfairs, in which we found it proper,
considering that we were bound for England, aud
not for Moscow, to consider how to dispose of our-
selves. They told us of sledges and rein deer to
carry us over the snow in the winter-time; and, in-
deed, they have such things, as it would be incredi-
ble to relate the particulars of, by which means the
Russians travel more in the winter than they can in
summer; because in these sledges they are able to
run night and day: the snow being frozen, is one
universal covering to nature, by which the the hills,
the vales, the rivers, the lakes, are all smooth, and
hard as a stone; and they run upon the sursace,
without any regard to what is underneath.
But I had no occasion to push at a winter journey
of this kind; I was bound to England, not to Mos-
cow, and my route lay two ways: either 1 must go
on as the caravan went, till I came to jarijlaw, and
then go off west for Narva, and the gulph of Fin-
land, and so either by sea or land to Dantzick, where
I might possibly sell my China cargo to good advan-
tage, or I must leave the caravan at a little town on
the Dwina, from whence I had but six davs bv wa-
ter to Arch-Angel, and from thence might be sure
of stripping, either to Er.gland, Holland, or Ham-
burgh.
Z 3 Now
Now to go any of these journies in the winter
would have been preposterous; for as to Dantzic, the
Baltic would be frozen up, and I could not get passage;
and to go by land in those countries, was sar less
safe than among the Mogul Tartars; likewise to
Arch-Angel, in October all the ships would be gone
srom thence, and even the merchants, who dwell
there in summer, retire south to Moscow in the win-
ter, when the ships are gone; so that I should have
nothing but extremity of cold to encounter, with a
scarcity of provisions, and must lie there in an
empty town all the winter: so that, upon the whole,
I thought it much my better way to let the caravan
go, and to make provision to winter where I was,
viz. at Toboljki, in Siberia, in the latitude of sixty
degrees, where I was sure of three things to wear
out a cold winter with, viz. plenty of provisions,
such as the country afforded, a warm house, with
fuel enough, and excellent company; of all which
I shall give a full account in its place.
I was now in a quite different climate from my
beloved island, where I never felt cold, except when
I had my ague; on the contrary, I had much to do
to bear my clothes on my back, and never made any
fire but without doors, and my necessity, in dressing
my food, &c. Now I made me three good vests,
with large robes or gowns over them, to hang down
to the feet, and button close to the wrists, and all
these lined with furs, to make them sufficiently
warm.
As to a warm house, I must confess, I greatly dis-
like our way in England, of making fires in every
room
room in the house, in open chimnies, which, when
the fire was out, always kept the air in the room
cold as the climate. But taking an apartment in a
good house in the town, I ordered a chimney to be
built like a furnace, in the centre of fix several rooms,
like a stove; the funnel to carry the smoke went up
one way, the door to come at the fire went in
another, and all the rooms were kept equally warm,
but no fire seen; like as they heat the bagnios in
England.
By this means we had always the same climate in
all the rooms, and an equal heat was preserved; and
how cold soever it was without, it was always warm
within; and yet we saw no fire, nor were ever in-
commoded with any smoke.
The most wonderful thing of all was, that it should
be possible to meet with good company here, in a
country so barbarous as that of the most, northerly
parts of Europe, near the frozen ocean, and within
but a very few degrees of Nova Zembla.
But this being the country where the state crimi-
nals of Muscovy, as I observed before, are all banished;
this city was full of noblemen, princes, gentlemen,
colonels, and, in short, all degrees of the nobility,
gentry, soldiery, and courtiers of Muscovy. Here
were the samous Prince Galilfkcn, or Galoffken, and
his son; the old general Robostisky, and several other
persons of note, and some ladies.
By means of my Scots merchant, whom, never,
thelefs, I parted with here, I made an acquaintance
with several of these gentlemen, and some of them
of the first rank; and from these, in the long winter
nights, in which I staid here, I received several agree-
Z 4 able
able visits. It was talking one night with a certain
prince, one of the banished ministers of state be-
longing to the czar of Muscovy, that my talk of my
particular case began, He had been telling me abun-
dance of fine things, of the greatness, the magni-
ficence, and dominions, and the absolute power of
the emperor of the Ruffians. I interrupted him, and
told him, I was a greater and more powerful prince
than ever the zcar of Muscovy was, though my do-
minions were not so large, or my people so many.
The Russian grandee looked a little surprized, and
fixing his eyes steadily upon me, began to wonder
what I meant.
I told him his wonder would cease when I had
explained myself. First, I told him, I had the ab-
solute disposal of the lives and fortunes of all my
subjects; That notwithstanding my absolute power,
I had not one person disaffected to my government
or to my person, in all my dominions. He shook
his head at that, and said, There, indeed, I out-did
the czar of Muscovy. I told him, that all the lands
in my kingdom were my. own, and all my subjects
were not only my tenants, but tenants at will; that
they would all fight for me to the last drop; and
that never tyrant, for such I acknowledged myself to
be, was ever so universally beloved, and yet so hor-
ribly feared, by his subjects.
After amusing them with these riddles in go-
vernment for a while, I opened the case, and told
them the story at large of my living in the island,
and how I managed both myself and the people there
that were under me, just as I have since minuted it
down. They were exceedingly taken with the story,
and

and especially the prince, who told me with a sigh,
that the true greatness of life was to be master of
ourselves; that he would not have changed such a
state of life as mine, to have been czar of Muscovy;
and that he found more felicity in the retirement he
seemed to be banished to there, than ever he found
in the highest authority he enjoyed in the court of
his master the czar: that the heighth of human wis-
dom was to bring our tempers down to our circum-
stances, and to make a calm within, under the
weight of the greatest storm without. When he
came first hither, he said, he used to tear the hair
from hisNhead, and the clothes from his back, as
others had done before him; but a little time and
consideration had made him look into himself, as
well as round himself, to things without: that he
found the mind of man, if it was but once brought
to reflect upon the state of universal lise, and how
little this world was concerned in its true felicity,
was perfectly capable of making a selicity for itself,
fully satisfying to itself, and suitable to its own best
ends and defires, with but very little assistance from
the world; that air to breathe in, food to sustain life,
clothes for warmth, and liberty for exercise, in order
to health, compleated, in his opinion, all that the
world could do for us: and though the greatness,
the authority, the riches, and the pleasures, which
some enjoyed in the world, and which he had en-
joyed his mare of, had much in them that was agree-
able to us, yet he observed, that all those things
chiefly gratified the coarsest of our asfections; such
as our ambition, our particular pride, our avarice,
j*ur vanity, and our sensuality; all which were,
indeed,
indeed, the mere product of the worst part of man,
were in themselves crimes, and had in them the feeds
of all manner of crimes; but neither were related to
or concerned with, any of those virtues that consti-
tuted us wife men, or of those graces which distin-
guished us as Chri/lians: that being now deprived of
all the sancied felicity, which he enjoyed in the full
exercise of all those vices, he said, he was at leisure
to look upon the dark side of them, where he found
all manner of deformity; and was now convinced,
that virtue only makes a man truly wife, rich, and
great, and preserves him in the way to a superior
happiness in a future state; and in this, he said,
they were more happy in their banishment, than all
their enemies were, who had the full possession of all
the wealth and power that they (the banished) had
left behind them.
Nor, Sir, said he, do I bring my mind to this
politically, by the necessity of my circumstances,
which some call miserable; but, if I know any thing
of myself, I would not go back, no not though
my mailer, the czar, mould call me, and offer to
reinstate me in all my former grandeur; I say, I
would no more go back to it, than I believe my soul
when it shall be delivered from this prison of the body
and has had a taste of the glorious state beyond life,
would come back to the goal of flesh and blood it is
now inclosed in, and leave heaven to deal in the dirt
and grime of human affairs.
He spake this with so much warmth in his temper,
so much earnestness and motion of his spirits, which
were apparent in his countenance, that it was evident
it was the true sense of his soul; and, indeed, there
was no room to doubt his sincerity.
I told
I told him, I once thought myself a kind of a
monarch in my old station, of which I had given
him an account, but that I thought he was not a
monarch only, but a great conqueror; for that he
that has got a victory over his own exorbitant de-
sires, and has the absolute dominion over himself,
and whose reason entirely governs his will, is cer-
tainly greater than he that conquers a city. But,
my lord, said I, shall I take the liberty to ask you a
question? With all my heart, said he. If the door
of your liberty was opened, said I, would not you
take hold of it to deliver yourself from this exile?
rlold, said he, your question is subtle, and re-
quires some serious just distinctions to give it a sincere
answer; and I'll give it you from the bottom of my
heart. Nothing that I know of in this world would
move me to deliver myself from the state of banish-
ment, except these two: First, the enjoyment of my
relations; and, secondly, a little warmer climate:
but I protest to you, that to go back to the pomp of
the court, the glory, the power, the hurry of a mi-
nister of state; the wealth, the gaiety, and the plea-
sures, that is to say, foliies of a courtier; if my mas-
ter should send me word this moment, that he restores
me to all he banished me from; I protest, if I know
myself at all, I would not leave this wilderness, these
desarts, and these frozen lakes, for the palace of
Moscow.
But, my lord, said I, perhaps you not only are .
banished from the pleasures of the court, and from the
power, and authority, and wealth, you enjoyed be-
fore, but you may be absent too from some of the con-
veniencies of life; your estate, perhaps, confiscated,
and
and your esfects plundered; and the supplies left
you here may not be suitable to the ordinary demands
of life.
Ay, said he, that k as you suppose me to be, a lord,
or a prince, &c. So, indeed, I am; but you are
now to consider me only as a man, an human crea-
ture, not at all distinguished from another; and so I
can suffer no want, unless I should be visited with
sickness and distempers. However, to put the ques-
tion out of dispute; you see our manner; we are in
this place five persons of rank; we live perfectly re-
tired, as suited to a state of banishment; we have
something rescued from the shipwreck of our fortunes,
which keeps us from the mere necessity of hunting
for our food; but the poor soldiers who are here,
without that help, live in as much plenty as we.
They go into the woods, and catch sables and foxes;
the labour of a month will maintain them a year;
and as the way of living is not expensive, so it is not
hard to get sufficient to ourselves: So that objection
is out of doors.
I have no room to give a full account of the most
agreeable conversation I had with this truly great
man; in all which he shewed, that his mind was so
inspired with a superior knowledge of things, so sup-
ported by religion, as well as by a vast share of wis-
dom, that his contempt of the world was really as
much as he had expressed, and that he was always
• the same to the last, as will appear in the story I am
going to tell.
I had been here eight months, and a dark dreadful
winter I thought it to be; the cold was so intense,
tha
349
that I couki not so much as look abroad without
being wrapt in furs, and a mask of fur before my
face, or rather a hood, with only an hole for breath,
and two for fight. The little day-light we had, vyas,
as we reckoned, for three months, not above five
hours a day, and six at most; only that the snow
lying on the ground continually, and the weather
being clear, it was never quite dark. Our horses were
kept (or rather starved) under-ground; and, as, for
our servants (for we hired servants here to look after
our horses and ourselves), we had every now and then
their fingers and toes to thaw, and take care of, lest
they mould mortify and sall off.
It is true, within doors we were warm, the houses
being close, the walls thick, the lights small, and the
glass all double. Our food was chiefly the flesh of
deer, dried and cured in the season; good bread
enough, but baked as biscuits; dried fish of several
sorts, and some flesh of mutton, and of buffaloes,
which is pretty good beef. AH the store of pro-
vision for the winter are laid up in the summer, and
well cured; our drink was water mixed with aqua
vitæ instead of brandy; and, for a treat, mead instead
of wine; which, however, they have excellent good.
The hunters, who ventured abroad all weathers, fre-
quently brought us in fresh venison, very sat and
good; and sometimes bears flesh, but we did not
much care for the last. We had a good stock of tea,
with which we treated our friends as above; and, in
a word, we lived very chearfully and well, all things
considered.
It was now March, and the days grown consider-
ably longer, and the weather at least tolerable; so
other
other travellers began to prepare fledges to carry them
over the snow, and to get things ready to be going .
but my measures being fixed, as I have said, for
Arch-Angel, and not for Muscovy or the Baltick, I
made no motion, knowing very well, that the ships
from the south do not set out for that part of the
world till May or June; and that if I was there at
the beginning of August, it would be as soon as any
ships would be ready to go away; and therefore, I
say, I made no haste to be gone, as others did; in a
word, I saw a great many people, nay, all the tra-
vellers, go away before me. It seems, every year
they go from thence to Moscow for trade; viz. tp
carry furs, and buy necessaries with them, which
they bring back to furnish their shops; also others
went on the same errand to Arch-Angel; but then
they also, being to come back again above eight
hundred miles, went all out before me.
In short, about the latter end of May, I began to
make all ready to pack up; and as I was doing this,
it occurred to me, that seeing all these people were
banished by the czar of Muscovy to Siberia, and yet,
when they came there, were at liberty to go whither
they would; why did they not then go away to any
part of the world wherever they thought fit? and I
began to examine what should hinder them from
making such an attempt.
But my wonder was over, when I entered upon
that subject with the person I have mentioned, who
answered me thus: Consider, first, said he, the
place where we are; and, secondly, the condition we
are in; especially, said he, the generality of the
people
people who are banished hither. We are surrounded,
said he, with stronger things than bars and bolts:
on the north fide is an unnavigable ocean, where ship
never sailed, and boat never swam; neither, if we
had both, could we know whither to go with them.
Every other way, said he, we have above a thousand
miles to pass through the czar's own dominions, and
by ways utterly impassable, except by the roads made
by the government, and through the towns garrisoned
by his troops; so that we could neither pass undis-
covered by the read, or subsist any other way: so
that it is in vain to attempt it.
I was silenced, indeed, at once, and found that
they were in a prison, every jot as secure, as if they
had been locked up in the castle of Moscow; how-
ever, it came into my thoughts, that I might
certainly be made an instrument to procure the escape
of this excellent person, and that it was very easy
for me to carry him away, there being no guard over
him in the country; and as I was not going to Mos-
cow, but to Arch-Angel, and that I went in the na-
ture of a caravan, by which I was not obliged to lie
in the stationary towns in the desart, but could en-
camp every night were I would, we might easily
pass uninterrupted to Arch-Angel, where I could im-
mediately secure him on board an English or Dutch
ship, and carry him off safe along with me; and
as to his subsistence, and other particulars, that
mould be my care, till he mould better supply him-
self.
He heard me very attentively, and looked earnestly
on me all the while I spoke; nay, I could see in his
very sace, that what I said put his spirits into an ex-
3 ceeding
ceeding ferment; his colour frequently changes
his eyes looked red, and his heart fluttered, that it
might be even perceived in his countenance; nos
could he immediately answer me when I had
done, and, as it were, expected what he would say to
it; and after he had paused a little, he embraced
me, and said, How unhappy are we! unguided crea-
tures as we are, that even our greatest acts of friend-
ship are made snares to us, and we are made tempters
of one another! My dear friend, said he, your osfer is
so sincere, has such kindness in it, is so disinterested
in itself, and is so calculated for my advantage, that
I must have very little knowledge of the world, if I
did not both wonder at it, and acknowledge the
obligation I have upon me to you for it: But did
you believe I was sincere in what I have so often said
to you of my contempt of the world? Did you be-
lieve I spoke my very soul to you, and that I had
really maintained that degree of felicity here, that
had placed me above all that the world could give
me, or do for me? Did you believe I was sincere,
when I told you I would not go back, if I was re-
called even to be all that once I was in the court, and
with the savour of the czar my master? Did you
believe me, my friend, to be an honest man, or did
you think me to be a boasting hypocrite ?—Here he
stopped, as if he would hear what I would say; but,
indeed, I soon after perceived, that he stopped be-
cause his spirits were in motion; his heart was full
of struggles, and he could not go on. I was, I con-
fess, astonished at the thing, as well as at the man,
and I used some arguments with him to urge him to
set himself free; that he ought to look upon this as a
2 door
door opened by Heaven for his deliverance, and a
summons by Providence, who has the care and
good disposition of all events, to do himself good,
and to render himself useful in the world.
He had by this time recovered himself. How do
you know, Sir, said he, warmly, but that instead of
a summons from Heaven, it may be a feint of another
instrument, representing, in all the alluring colours,
to me, the shew of felicity as a deliverance, which
may in itself be my snare, and tend directly to my
ruin? Here I am free from the temptation of return,
ing to my former miserable greatness; there I am
not sure, but that all the seeds of pride, ambition,
avarice, and luxury, which I know remain in my
nature, may revive and take root, and, in a word,
again overwhelm me; and then the happy prisoner,
whom you see now master of his soul's liberty, shall
be the miserable slave of his own fenses, in the full
possession of all personal liberty. Dear Sir, let me
remain in this blessed confinement, banished from the
crimes of life, rather than purchase a show of free*
dom at the expence of the liberty of my reason,
and at the expence of the suture happiness which
now I have in my view, but shall then, I fear, quick-
ly lose sight of; for I am but flesh, a man, a mere
man, have passions and affections as likely to possess
and overthrow me as any man: O be not my friend
and my tempter both together!
If I was surprised before, I was quite dumb now,
and stood silent, looking at him; and, indeed, ad-
mired what I saw; the struggle in his foul was so
Vol. II. A a great,
great, that though the weather was extremely cold,
it put him into a most violent sweat, and I found he
wanted to give vent to his mind; so I said a word or
two, that I would leave him to consider of it, and
wait on him again; and then I withdrew to my own
apartment.
About two hours after, I heard somebody at or
near the door of the room, and I was going to open
the door; but he had Opened it, and come in: My
dear friend, said he, you had almost overset me, but
I am recovered: do not take it ill that I do not close
with your offer; I assure you, it is not for want of
a fense of the kindness of it in you; and I come to
make the most sincere acknowledgement of it to you;
but, I hope, I have got the victory over myself.
My lord, said I, I hope you are fully satisfied, that
you did not resist the call of Heaven. Sir, said he,
if it had been from Heaven, the same power would
have influenced me to accept it; but I hope, and am
fully satisfied, that it is from Heaven that I decline
it; and I have an infinite satissaction in the parting,
that you shall leave me an honest man still, though
not a free man.
I had nothing to do but to acquiesce, and make
pro,r lion to him of my having no end in it, but a
sincere defire to serve him. He embraced me very
passionately, and assured me, he was sensible of that,
and should always acknowledge it; and with that
he offered me a very fine present of sables, too much
indeed for me to accept from a man in his circum-
stances; and I would have avoided them, but he
would not be refused.
The
The next morning I sent my servant to his lord-
ship, with a small present of tea, two pieces of China
damask, and four little wedges of japan gold, which
did not all weigh above six ounces, or thereabouts;
but were sar short of the value of his sables, which
indeed, when I came to England, I found worth near
two hundred pounds. He accepted the tea, and
one piece of the damask, and one of the pieces of
gold, which had a fine stamp upon it, of the Japan
coinage, which I found he took for the rarity of it,
but would not take anv more; and sent word by my
servant, that he defired to speak with me.
When I came to him, he told me, I knew what
had passed between us, and hoped I would not move
him any more in that affair; but that, since I made
such a generous offer to him, he aslied me, if I had
kindness enough to offer the same to another person
that he would name to me, in whom he had a great
share of concern. I told him, that I could not say I
inclined to do so much for any one but himself, for
whom I had a particular value, and should have been
glad to have been the instrument of his deliverance:
however, if he would please to name the person to me,
I would give him my answer, and hoped he would
not be displeased with me, if he was with my answer.
He told me, it was only his son, who, though I had
not seen, yet was in the same condition with himself,
and above two hundred miles from him, on the other
side the Oby; but that, if I consented, he would
send for him.
I made no hesitation, but told him I would do it:
I made some ceremony in letting him understand
that it was wholly on his account; and that seeing I
A a 2 could
could not prevail on him, I would shew my respect
to him by my concern for his son: but these things
are too tedious to repeat here. He sent away the
next day for his son, and in about twenty days he
came back with the messenger, bringing six or seven
horses loaded with very rich furs, and which, in the
whole, amounted to a very great value.
His servants brought the horses into the town,
but left the young lord at a distance till night, when
he came incognito into our apartment, and his
sather presented him to me; and, in short, we con-
certed there the manner of our travelling, and every
thing proper for the journey.
I had bought a considerable quantity of sables,
black fox-skins, fine ermins, and such other furs
that are very rich; I say, I had bought them in
that city for exchange for some of the goods brought
from China; in particular, for the cloves and nut-
megs, of which I sold the greatest part here; and
the rest afterwards at Arch-Angel, for a much better
price than I could have done it London; and my
partner, who was sensible of the profit, and whose
business, more particularly than mine, was merchan-
dize, was mightily pleased with our stay, on account
of the traffic we made here.
It was in the beginning of "June when I left this
remote place, a city, I believe, little heard of in the
world; and, indeed, it is so sar out of the road of
commerce, that I know not how it should be much
talked of. We were now come to a very small cara-
van, being only thirty-two horses and camels in all,
and all of them passed for mine, though my new
guest was proprietor of eleven of them. It was most
natural
natural also, that I should take more servants with
me than I had before, and the young lord passed for
my steward; what great man I passed for mysels I
know not, neither did it concern me to enquire.
We had here the worst and the largest desart to pass
over that we met with in all the journey; indeed I
call it the worst, because the way was very deep in
some places, and very uneven in others; the best we
had to say for it, was, that we thought we had no
troops of Tartars and robbers to fear, and that they
never came on this side the river Oby, or at least but
very seldom; but we found it otherwise.
My young lord had with him a saithful Muscovite
servant, or rather a Siberian servant, who was per-
fectly acquainted with the country; and who led us
by private roads, that we avoided coming into the
principal towns and cities upon the great road, such
as Tumen, Soloy Kamaskoy, and several others; be-
cause the Muscovite garrisons,which are kept there,are
very curious and strict in their observation upon tra-
vellers, and searching lest any of the banished persons
of note should make their escape that way into Mus-
covy.; but by this means, as we were kept out of the
cities, so our whole journey was a desart, and we
were obliged to encamp and lie in our tents, when
we might have had good accommodation in the cities
on the way: this the young lord was so sensible of,
that he would not allow us to lie abroad, when we
came to several cities on the way; but lay abroad
himself, with his servant, in the woods, and met us
always at the appointed places.
We were just entered Europe, having passed the
river Kama, which, in these parts, is the boundary
A a 3 between
between Europe and Asia; and the first city on the
European side was called Soloy Kamofkoy, which is as
much as to say, the great city on the river Kama;
and here we thought to have seen some evident alte-
ration in the people, their manners, their habit,
their religion, and their business; but we were mis-
taken; for as we had a vast desart to pass, which,
by relation, is near seven hundred miles long in some
places, but not above two hundred miles over where
we passed it; so, till we came past that horrible
place, we found very little difference between that
country, and the Mogul Tartary; the people mostly
Pagans, and little better than the savages of America;
their houses and towns full of idols, and their way
of living wholly barbarous, except in the cities as
above, and the villages near them; where they
are Christians, as they call themselves, of the Greek
church; but even these have their religion mingled
with so many reliques of superstition, that it is scarce
to be known in some places from mere sorcery and
witchcraft.
In passing this forest, I thought, indeed, we must,
after all our dangers were, in our imagination, esca-
ped, as before, have been plundered and robbed,
and perhaps murdered by a troop of thieves; of what
country they were, whether the roving bands of the
Ojiiachi, a kind of Tartars, or wild people on the
banks of the Oby, had ranged thus far; or whether
they were the sable-hunters of Siberia, I am yet at a
loss to know; but they were all on horseback,
carried bows and arrows, and were at first about
five-and-forty in number; they came so near to
2 us
us as within about two musquet shot; and, asking
no questions, they surrounded us with their horse,
and looked very earnestly upon us twice; at length
they placed themselves just in our way; upon which
we drew up in a little line before our camels, being
not above sixteen men in all; and being drawn up
thus, we halted, and sent out the Siberian servant
who attended his lord, to fee who they were; his
master was the more willing to let him go, because
he was not a little apprehensive that they were a
Siberian troop sent out after him. The man came
up near them with a flag of truce, and called to
them; but though he spoke several of their languages,
or dialects of languages rather, he could not under-
stand a word they said: however, after some signs
to him not to come nearer to them at his peril, so
he said he understood them to mean, osfering to
shoot at him if he advanced, the fellow came back
no wiser than he went, only that by their dress,
he said, he. believed them to be some Tartars os
Kalmuck, or of the Circajstan hords; and that there
must be more of them on the great desart, though
he never heard that ever any of them were seen so
sar north before.
This was small comfort to us; however, we
had no remedy: there was on our left hand, at
about a quarter of a mile's distance, a little grove
or clump of trees, which stood close together, and
very near the road; I immediately resolved we
would advance to those trees, and fortify ourselves
as well as we could there; for, first, I considered
that the trees would in a great measure cover us from
their "arrows; and in the next place, they could not
A a 4 come
come to charge us in a body: it was, indeed, my
old Portuguese pilot who proposed it; and who had
this excellency attending him, namely, that he was
always readiest and most apt to direct and encourage
us in cases of the most danger. We advanced im-
mediately with what speed we could, and gained
that little wood, the Tartars, or thieves, for we
knew not what to call them, keeping their stand,
and not attempting to hinder us. When we came
thither, we found, to our great satissaction, that it
was a swampy, springy piece of ground, and, on
the other side, a great spring of water, which,
running out in a little rill or brook, was a little sar-
ther joined by another of the like bigness; and was,
in short, the head, or source of a considerable river,
called afterwards the Wirtska. The trees which grew
about this spring, were not in all above two hundred,
but were very large, and stood pretty thick; so that
as soon as we got in, we saw ourselves perfectly safe
from the enemy, unless they alighted-and attacked
us on foot.
But to make this more difficult, our Portuguese^
with indesatigable application, cut dowslgreat arms
of the trees, and laid them hanging, not cut quite
off, srom one tree to another; so that he made a con-
tinued fence almost round us.
We staid here, waiting the motion of the enemy
some hours, without perceiving they made any offer
to stir; when about two hours before night, they
came down directly upon us; and, though we had
not perceived it, we found they had been joined by
some more of the same, so that they were near four*
score
361
fcore horse, whereof, however, we sancied some were
women. They came in till they were within half a
shot of our little wood, when we fired one musquet
without ball, and called to them in the Ruffian tongue,
to know what they wanted, and bid them keep osf;
but, as if they knew nothing of what we said, they
came on with a double fury directly up to the wood-
side, not imagining we were so barricaded, that they
could not break in: our old pilot was our captain,
as well as he had been our engineer; and defired
of us, not to fire upon them till they came within
pistol shot, that we might be sure to kill; and that
when we did fire, we mould be sure to take good
aim. We bade him give the word of command;
which he delayed so long, that they were, some of
them, within two pikes length of us when we fired.
We aimed so true (or Providence directed our
shot so sure) that we killed fourteen of them at the
first volley, and wounded several others, as also
several of their horses; for we had all of us loaded our
pieces with two or three bullets a piece, at least.
They were terribly surprised with our fire, and
retreated immediately about one hundred rods from
us; in which time we loaded our pieces again, and,
seeing them keep that distance, we sallied out, and
caught four or five of their horses, whose riders,
we supposed, were killed; and coming up to the
dead, we could easily perceive they were Tartars,
but knew not from what country, or how they came
to make an excursion such an unusual length.
About an hour after, they made a motion to at-
tack us again, and rode round our little wood, to
see where else they might break in; but finding us
always
always ready to sace them, they went off again,
and we resolved not to stir from the place for that
night.
We flept a little, you may be sure; but spent the
most part of the night in strengthening our situation,
and barricading the entrances into the wood; and,
keeping a strict: watch, we waited for day-light, and,
when it came, it gave us a very unwelcome disco-
very indeed: for the enemy, who we thought were
discouraged with the reception they had met with,
were now increased to no less than three hundred,
and had set up eleven or twelve huts and tents, as
if they were resolved to besiege us; and this little
camp they had pitched, was upon the open plain, at
about three quarters of a mile from us. We were in-
deed surprized at this discovery; and now, I confess, I
gave myself over for lost, and all that I had. The
loss of my effects did not lie so near me (though
they were very considerable) as the thoughts of
falling into the hands of such barbarians, at the
latter end of my journey, after so many difficulties
and hazards as I had gone through; and even in
sight of our port, where we expected safety and de-
liverance. As for my partner, he was raging: he
declared, that to lose his goods would be his ruin;
and he would rather die than be starved; and he
was for fighting to the last drop.
The young lord, as gallant as ever flesh shewed
itself, was for fighting to the 'aft also; and my old
pilot was of the opinion we were able to resist them
all, in the situation we then were in: and thus we
spent the day in debates of what we should do;
but towards evening, we found that the number of
our
our enemies still increased: perhaps, as they were
abroad in several parties for prey, the first had sent
out scouts to call for help, and to acquaint them of
their booty; and we did not know but by the morn-
ing they might still be a greater number; so I
began to enquire of those people we had brought
from Tobol/ki, if there was no other, or more pri-
vate ways, by which we might avoid them in the
night, and perhaps, either retreat to some town, or
get help to guard us over the desart.
The Siberian, who was servant to the young lord,
old us, if we designed to avoid them, and not fight,
he would engage to carry us off in the night to a
way that went north towards the river Petraz, by
which he made no doubt but we might get away,
and the Tartars never the wiser; but he said, his lord
had told him he would not return, but would rather
chuse to fight. I told him, he mistook his lord;
for that he was too wife a man to love sighting for
the sake of it that I knew his lord was brave enough
by what he had shewed already; but that his lord
knew better than to defire to have seventeen or
eighteen men fight five hundred, unless an unavoida-
ble necessity forced them to it; and that if he thought
it possible for us to escape in the night, we had no-
thing else to do but to attempt it. He answered, if
his lord gave him such order, he would lose his life
if he did not perform it. We soon brought his lord
to give that order, though privately, and we imme-
diately prepared for the putting it in practice.
And first, as soon as it began to be dark, we
kindled a fire in our little camp, which we kept
burning,
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
burning, and prepared so as to make it burn all
night, that the Tartars might conclude we were still
there; but, as soon as it was dark, that is to say,
so as we could fee the stars, (for our guide would
not stir before) having all our horses and camels
ready loaded, we followed our new guide, who, I
soon found, steered himself by the pole, or north
star, all the country being level for a long way.
After we had travelled two hours very hard, it
began to be lighter still; not that it was quite dark
all night, but the moon began to rile, so that, iai
short, it was rather lighter than we wished it to be;
but by six o'clock next morning, we were gotten
near forty miles, though the truth is, we almost
spoiled our horses. Here we found a Rujfian village,
named Kirmazinskoy, where we rested, and heard
nothing of the Calmuck Tartars that day. About
two hours before night we set out again, and tra-
velled till eight the next morning, though not quite
so hastily as before; and about seven o'clock we
passed.a little river, called Kir/za, and came to a good
large town inhabited by Rufftans, and very popu-
lous, called Ozomys: There we heard, that several
troops, or herds of Calmucks had been abroad upon
the delart, but that we were now completely out of
danger of them, which was to our great satisfaction^
you may be sure. Here we were obliged to get some
fresh horses, and having need enough of rest, we
staid five days; and my partner and I agreed to give
the honest Siberian, who brought us hither, the va-
lue of ten pistoles for his conducting us.
In five days more we came to Vcujfima, upon the
river Witzogda, which running into the river Dwina,
we

we were there very happily near the end of our tra-
vels by land, that river being navigable in seven
days passage to Arch-Angel: from hence we came to
Lawrenstov, where the river joins, the third of July;
and provided ourselves with two luggage-boats, and
a barge, for our convenience. We embarked the se-
venth, and arrived all safe at Arch-Angel the eigh-
teenth, having been a year, five months, and three
•days on the journey, including our stay of eight
months and odd days at Tobolski.
We were obliged to stay at this place six weeks for
the arrival of the ships, and must have tarried longer,
had not a Hamburther come in above a month sooner
than any of the English ships; when, after some con-
sideration, that the city of Hamburgh might happen
to be as good a market for our goods as London, we
all took freight with him; and having put our goods
on board, it was most natural for me to put my
steward on board to take care of them; by which
means my young lord had a sufficient opportunity to
conceal himself, never coming on shore again in
all the time we staid there; and this he did, that he
might not be seen in the city, where some of the
Moscow merchants would certainly have seen and
discovered him.
We sailed from Arch-Angel the twentieth of Au-
gust the same year; and, after no extraordinary bad
voyage, arrived in the Elbe the thirteenth of Sep-
tember: here my partner and I found a very good
sale for our goods, as well those of China, as the
sables, &c. of Siberia; and dividing the produce of
our effects, my share amounted to 3475I. 17s. 3d.
notwithstanding so many losses w^e had sustained, and
3 charges
charges we had been at; only remembering that 1
had included, in this, about 6ool. worth of diamonds,
which I had purchased at Bengal.
Here the young lord took his leave of us, and
went up the Elbe, in order to go to the court of
Vienna, where he resolved to seek protection, and
where he could correspond with those of his sather's
friends who were left alive. He did not part with-
out all the testimonies he could give, of grati-
tude for the service I had done him, and his fense
of my kindness to the prince his sather.
To conclude: having staid near four months in
Hamburgh, I came from thence over land to the
Hague, where I embarked in the packet, and arrived
in London the 10th of January, 1705, having been
gone from England ten years and nine months.
And here, resolving to harrass myself no more, I
am preparing for a longer journey than all these, hav-
ing lived seventy-two years a life of infinite variety,
and learned sufficiently to know the value of re-
tirement, and the blessing of ending our days in.
peace.

for such amusement, during such a period, he
made no strong objections to Stockxkle's soli-

LIFE of DE FOE.'
IT is lamented by those who labour the fields of
British biography, that after being entangled in
briars they are often rewarded with the scanty pro-
ducts of barrenness. The lives of literary men are
generally passed in the obscurities of the closet,
which conceal even from friendly inquiries the arti-
fices of study, whereby each may have risen to emi-
nence. And during the same moment that the dili-
gent biographer sets out to ask for information, with
regard to the origin, the modes of life, or the vari-
ous fortunes of writers who have amused or in-
structed their country, the house-keeper, the daugh-
ter, or grand-child, that knew connexions and tra-
ditions, drop into the grave.
These reflexions naturally arose from my inquiries
about the life of the Author of The History of
the Union of Great Britain; and of The
Adventures of Robinson Crusoe. Whether
he were born on the neighbouring continent, or in
this island; in London, or in the country; was
equally uncertain- And whether his name were
Foe, or De Foe, was somewhat doubtful. Like
B b 2 Swift,
Swift, he had perhaps reasons for concealing what
would have added little to his consequence. It is
at length known, with sufficient certainty, that our
author was the son of James Foe, of the parish of
St. Giles's, Cripplegate, London, Citizen and But-,
cher. The concluding sentiment of The True-born
Englishman, we now see, was then as natural as it
will ever be just:
Then, let us boast of ancestors no more,
For, same of samilies is all a cheat;
'Tis personal virtue only makes us great.
If we may credit the Gazette, Daniel Foe, or De
Foe, as he is said by his enemies to have called
himself, that he might not be thought an EnglisiV
man, was born in London *, about the year 1663.
His samily were probably Dissenters f, among whom
he
* It is at last discovered, by searching The Chamberlain's books,
which have since been burnt, that our author was the son of James
Foe, of the parish of Cripplegate, London, Citizen and Butcher;
who was himself the son of Daniel Foe, of Elton, in the county
of Northampton, Yeoman ; and who obtained his Freedom by
serving his apprenticeship with John Levit, Citizen and Butcher.
Daniel Foe, the son of James, was admitted to hit Freedom by birth,
on the 26th of January, 1687-8. I was led to these discoveries
by observing that De Foe had voted at an election for a Repre-
sentative of London; whence I inferred, that he must have been
a citizen either by birth or service. But in the parish books I
could find no notice of his baptism; as his parents were Dis-
senters.
f In his Preface to " More Reformation," De Foe complains,
That some D'Aenters had reproached him, as if he had said,
"that the gallows and the gallies ought to be the penalty of go-
ing to the conventicle; forgetting, that I must design to have my
father, my wife, fix innocent children, and myself, put into the same
condition. To such Dissenters I can only regret," fays he, " That
when
he received no unlettered educationj at least it is
plain, from his various writings, that he was a
zealous defender of their principles, and a strenuous
supporter of their politics, before the liberality of
our rulers in church and state had freed this conduct
from danger* He merits the praise which is due
to sincerity in manner of thinking, and to unifor-
mity in habits of acting, whatever obloquy may have
been cast on his name, by attributing writings to
him, which, as they belonged to others, he was
studious to disavow.
Our Author was educated at a dissenting academy,
which was kept at Ne^ington-Green by Charles
Morton. He delights to praise " that learned gen-
tleman*," whose instructive lessons he probably en-
joyed from 1675 to 1680, as a master, who taught
nothing either in politics, or science, ahich was
dangerous to monarchial government, or which
was improper for a diligent scholar to know.
Being in 1705 accused by Tutchin of illiterature,
De Foe archly acknowledged, " I owe this justice
to my ancient sather, who is yet living, and in
whose behalf I freely testify, that if I am a blockhead,
it was nobody's sault but my own; he having
spared nothing that might qualify me to match
the accurate Dr. B or the most learned
Tutchinf."
when I had drawn the picture, I did not, like the Dutchman
with his man and bear, write under them—"This is the man; and
this it the hear." De Foe expressly admits, that he was a dis-
senter, though no independent, fifth-monarchy man, or leveller.

B b3 De
De Foe was born a writer, as other men are born
generals and statesmen: and when he was not twenty-
one, he published, in 1683, a pamphlet against a
very prevailing sentiment in savour of the Turks, as
opposed to the Austrians; very justly thinking, as
he avows in his riper age, that it was better the
Popish House of Austria should ruin the Protestants
in Hungary, than the insidel House of Ottoman
should ruin both Protestants and Papists, by over-
running Germany *. De Foe was a man who would
fight as well as write for his principles: and before
he was three-and-twenty he appeared in arms for
the Duke of'Monmouth, in June 1685. Of this
exploit he boasts .j. in his latter years, when it
was no longer dangerous to avow his participation
in that imprudent enterprise, with greater men of
similar principles.
Having escaped from the dangers of battle, and
from the sangs of Jefferys, De Foe found complete
security in the more gainful pursuits of peace. Yet,
he was prompted by his zeal to mingle in the con-
troversies of the reign of James 2d, whom he effi-
caciously opposed, by warning the Dissenters of the
secret danger of the insidious tolerance, which was
osfered by the monarch's bigotry, or by the minis-
ter's artifice. When our Author collected his writ-
ings, he did not think proper to republifii either his
tract against the Turks, or his pamphlet against the
Kin?.
O
De Foe was admitted a Liveryman of London
on the 26th of January, 1687—8; when, being al-
lowed his freedom by birth, he was received a mem-
* Appeal, p. j 1. t AppeaL
ber
ber of that eminent corporation. As he had en-
deavoured to promote the revolution by his pen and
his sword, he had the satissaction of partaking,
ere long, in the pleasures and advantages of that great
event. During the hilarity of that moment, the Lord
Mayor of London asked King William to partake of
the city feast on the 29th of October, 1689. Every
honour was paid the Sovereign of the people's choice.
A regiment of volunteers, composed of the chief
citizens, and commanded by the celebrated Earl of
Peterborough, attended the King and Queen from
Whitehall to the Mansion House. Among these
troopers, gallantly mounted, and richly accoutred,
was Daniel De Foe, if we may believe Oldmixon *.
While our author thus displayed his zeal, and
courted notice, he is laid to have acted as a hosier
in Freeman's Yard, Cornhill: but the hosier f, and
the poet are very irreconcileable characters. With
the usual imprudence of superior genius, he was
carried by his vivacity into companies who were
gratified by his wit. He spent those hours with a
small society for the cultivation of polite learning,
which he ought to have employed in the calculations
of the counting-house: and being obliged to abscond
from his creditors in 1692, he naturally attri-
* Hist. vol. ii. p. 37.
t Being reproached by Tutchin in his Observator with having
been bred an apprentice to a hosier, De Foe asserts, in May 1705,
that he never ivas a hosier, or an apprentice, but admits that he
had been a Trader. [Review, vol. ii. p. 149.] Oldmixon, who
never speaks favourably of De Foe, allows that he had never been
a merchant otherwise than peddling a little to Portugal. Hist,

buted those misfortunes to the war, which were pro-
bably owing to his own misconduct. An angry
creditor took out a commission of bankruptcy,
which was soon superseded on the petition of those
to whom he was most indebted, who accepted a
composition on his single bond. This he punctu-
ally paid by the efforts of unwearied diligence.
But some of those creditors, who had been thus
satisfied, salling afterwards into distress themselves,
De Foe voluntarily paid them their whole claims;
being then in riling circumstances from King Wil-
liam's savour *. This is such an example of ho-
nesty, as it would be unjust to De Foe and to the
world to conceal. Being reproached in 1705 by
Lord Haverfiiam with mercenariness, our" author
feelingly mentions; " How, with a numerous sa-
mily, and no helps but his own industry, he had
forced his way with undiscouraged diligence, through
a sea of misfortunes, and reduced his debts, ex-
clusive of composition, from seventeen thousand to
less than five thousand pounds f." He continued
to carry on the pan-tile works near Tilbury-fort;
though probably with no great success. It was af-
terwards sarcastically said, that he did not, like the
Egyptians, require bricks without Jlraw, but, like the
yen's, required bricks without paying his labourers.
He was born for other enterprises, which, if they
did not gain him opulence, have conferred a renown,
that will descend the stream of time with the lan-
guage wherein his works are written.
While he was yet under thirty, and had mortified
no great man by his satire, or offended any party

Vindication.
by
by his pamphlets, he had acquired friends by his
powers of pleasing, who did not, with the usual in-
stability of friendships, desert him amidst his distres-
ses. They offered to settle him as a sactor at Cadiz,
where, as a trader, he had some previous correspond-
ence. In this situation he might have procured bu-
siness by his care, and accumulated wealth without
a risque: but, as he assures us in his old age, Pro-
vidence, which had other work for him to do, placed
a secret aversion in his mind to quitting England. He
had confidence enough in his own talents to think,
that on this field he could gather laurels, or at least
gain a livelihood.
In a projecling age, as our Author denominates
King William's reign, he was himself a projector.
While he was yet young, De Foe was prompted by
a vigorous mind to think of many schemes, and to
offer, what was most pleasing to the ruling powers,
ways and means for carrying on the war. He wrote,
as he says, many shects about the coin; he proposed
a register for seamen, long before the acl of Parlia-
ment ivas thought of; he projected county banks and
faflorics for goods; he mentioned a proposal for a
commission of inquiries into bankrupt's estates; he con-
trived a pension-office for the relief of the poor. At
length, in January 1696—7, he published his Essay
upon Projecls; which he dedicated to Dalby Tho-
mas, not as a Commissioner of glass duties, under
whom he then served, or as a friend, to whom he
acknowledges obligations; but as to the most pro-
per judge on the subject. It is always curious to
trace a thought, in order to fee where it first origi-
nated, or how it was afterwards expanded. Among
other projects, which shew a wide range of know-

ledge, he suggests to King William the imitation of
Lewis 14th, in the establishment of a society " for
encouraging polite learning, for refining the Eng-
lish language, and for preventing barbarisms of
manners." Prior offered in 1700 the same project
to King William^ in his Carmen Seculare; Swift
mentioned in 1710 to Lord Oxford a proposal for
improving the English tongue; and Tickell flatters
himself in his Prospccl of Peace, that our daring lan-
guage—-shall sport no more in arbitrary found. How-
ever his projects were taken, certain it is, 'that when
De Foe ceased to be a trader, he was, by the inter-
position of Dalby Thomas probably, appointed in
1695, accomptant to the Commissioners for manag-
ing the duties on glass; who, with our Author
ceased to act, on the first of August, 1699, when
the tax was suppressed by act of Parliament *.
From projects of ways and-uieans, De Foe's ar-
dour soon carried him into the thorny paths of sa-
tiric poetry; and his muse produced, in January
1700—1, The True-born Englishman. Of the origin
of this satire, which was the cause of much good for-
tune, but of some disasters, he gives himself the fol-
lowing account:-—" During this time came out
an abhorred pamphlet, in very ill verse, written
by one Mr. Tutchin, and called The Foreigners: in
which the Author, who he was I then knew not,
fell personally upon the King, then upon the Dutch
nation, and, after having reproached his Majesty
with crimes that his worst enemies could not think
of without horror, he sums up all in the odious
name of Foreigner. This filled me with a kind
of rage against the book, and gave birth to a trifle,
* io-ii Wm.III. ch. 18.
which
379
which I never could hope should have met with so
general an acceptation." The sale was prodigious,
and probably unexampled; as Sacheverel's trial had
not then appeared. The True-born Engliflman was
answered, paragraph by paragraph, in February
1700—1, by a writer, who brings hade to apo-
logize for dulness. For this Defence of King
William and the Dutch, which was doubtless circu-
lated by detraction and by power, De Foe was
amply rewarded. "How this poem was the occa-
sion," says he, " of my being known to his Ma-
jesty; how I was afterwards received by him; how
employed abroad; and how, above my capacity of
deserving, rewarded, is no part of the present case."
Of the particulars, which the Author thus declined
to tell, nothing now can be told. It is only certain,
that he was admitted to personal interviews with the
King, who was no reader of poetry; and that for
the Royal savours De Foe was always grateful.
When " the pen and ink war was raised against
a standing army," subsequent to the peace of Rys-
wick, our Author published An Argument, to
prove that a standing army, with consent of Parlia-
ment, is not inconsistent with a free government.
"Liberty and property," says he, " are the glo-
rious attributes of the English nation; and the
dearer they are to us, the less danger we are in of
losing them: but I could never yet see it proved,
that the danger of losing them by a small army was
such, as we should expose ourselves to all the world
for it. It is not the King of England alone, but
the sword of England in the hand of the King, that
gives laws of peace and war now to Europe: and
those who would thus wrest the sword out of
his hand in time of peace, bid the sairest of all men
in
1
in the world to renew the war." He, who is de-
sirous of reading this treatise on an interesting topic,
will meet with strength of argument, conveyed in
elegant language.
When the nation flamed with saction, the Grand
Jury of Kent presented to the Commons, on the 8th
of May 1701, a petition, which desired them—
a to mind the public business more, and their pri-
vate heats lessand which contained a sentiment,
that there was a design, as Burnet tells, other coun-
ties and the city of London should equally adopt.
Messrs. Culpeppers, Polhill, Hamilton, and Champ-
neys, who avowed this intrepid paper, were com-
mitted to the Gatehouse, amid the applauses of their
countrymen. It was on this occasion that De
Foe's genius dictated a Remonstrance, which was
signed Legion, and which has been recorded in his-
tory for its bold truths and seditious petulance. De
Foe's zeal induced him to assume a woman's dress,
while he delivered this sactious paper to Harley,
the Speaker, as he entered the House of Commons*.
It was then also that our Author, who was transported
by an equal attachment to the country and the
• Mr. Polhill, of Cheapstcad-place, in Kent, whose father,
Mr. David Polhill, was committed to the Gatehouse, and thereby
gained great popularity, was so good as communicate to me
the curious anecdote of De Foe's dressing himself in women's
clothes, and presenting the Legion Paper to the Speaker. De
Foe says himself in his Original Power os the People, p. 24:
"This is evident from the tenor and yet undiscovered original
of the Legion Paper; the contents of which had so nrtch plain
truth of sect; and which I could give a belter hislory of, if it were
needful" When De Foe republimed his works in 1703, he
thought it prudent to expunge this passage, that too plainly
pointed out the real history of the Legion Paper, which is not men-
tioned by the Commons Journals. \
court,
court, published The Original Power of the eolleclive
Body of the People of England, examined and asserted.
This timeful treatise he dedicated to King William,
in a dignified strain of nervous eloquence. *' It is
not the least of the extraordinaries of your Majesty's
character," says he, " that, as you are King of
your people, so you are the people's King; a title,
which, as it is the most glorious, so it is the most
indisputable." To the Lords and Commons he ad-
dresses himself in a similar tone: The vindication of
the original right of all men to the government of
themselves, he tells them, is so sar from being a de-
rogation from, that it is a confirmation of their legal
authority. Every lover of liberty must be pleased
with the perusal of a treatise, which vies with Mr.
Locke's samous tract in powers of reasoning, and is
superior to it in the graces of style.
At a time when *. union and charity, the one
relating to our civil, and the other to our religious
concerns, were strangers in the land," De Foe pub-
lished The Freeholder's Plea against Stockjobbing Elec
tions of Parliament Men. "It is very rational to
suppose," says our Author, "that they who will buy
will fell; or, what seems more rational, they who
have bought must fell" This is certainly a persuasive
performance, though we may suppose, that many
voters were influenced then by arguments still
more persuasive. And he concludes with a sentiment,
which has not been too often repeated, That nothing
can make us formidable to our neighbours, and
maintain the reputation of our nation, but union
.among ourselves.
How much soever King William may have been
pleased with The True-born Englishman, or with
other
other services, he was little gratified probably by our
Author's Reasons again/I a War with France. This
argument, shewing that the French King's owning the
Prince of Wales as King of England, is no sufficient
ground of a War, is one of the finest, because it is
one of the most useful, tracts in the English lan-
guage. After remarking the universal cry of the peo-
ple for war, our Author declares he is not against
war with France, provided it be on justifiable
grounds; but, he hopes, England will never be so
inconsiderable a nation, as to make use of dishonest
pretences to bring to pass any of her designs: and
he wishes that he who defires we should end the
war honourably, ought to defire also, that we begin it
fairly. "But if we must have a war," our Author
hoped, " it might be wholly on the defensive in
Flanders, in order to carry on hostilities in remote
places, where the damage may be greater, by wound-
ing the Spaniard in some weaker part; so as upon a
peace he shall be glad to quit Flanders for an equi-
valent." Who,at present does not wish that De
Foe's argument had been more studiously read, and
more efficaciously admitted?
A scene of sorrow soon after opened, which pro-
bably embittered our Author's future life. The
death of King William deprived him of a protector,
who, he says, trusted, esteemed, and much more
valued him than he deserved; and who, as he flattered
himself amidst his later distresses, would never have
suffered him to be treated as he had been in the
world. Of that monarch's memory, he says, that
he never patiently heard it abused, nor ever could
do so: and in this gratitude to a Royal benesactor
there is surely much to praise, but nothing to blame.
In
In the midst of that furious contest of party, civil
and religious, which ensued on the accession of
Queen Anne, our Author was no unconcerned
spectator. He reprinted his Enquiry into the Occa-
sional Conformity of Dissenters, which had been pub-
lished in 1697, with a dedication to Sir Humphrey
Edwin, a Lord Mayor, who having carried the
regalia to a conventicle, gave rife to some wit in
The Tale of a Tub, and occasioned some clauses in
an act of Parliament. De Foe now dedicated his
Enquiry to John How, a dissenting minister, of whom
Anthony Wood speaks well. Mr. How did not
much care, says Calamy *, to enter upon an argu-
ment of that nature with one of so warm a temper as
the author of that Enquiry, and contented himself
with publishing some Considerations on the Preface of
an Enquiry concerning the occasional Conformity of
Dissenters. De Foe's pertinacity soon produced a
reply. He out-laughs and out-talks Mr. How, who
had provoked his antagonist's wrath by.personal sar-
casms, and who now thought it hard that the old
should be shoved off the stage by the young. De
Foe reprobates, with the unforbearance of the
times, " this sast and loose game of religion ;" for
which he had never met with any considerable ex-
cuse but this, " that this is no conformity in point
of religion, but done as a civil action." He soon
after published another Enquiry, in order to shew,
that the Dissenters arc no ways concerned in occasional
conformity. The controversy, which in those days
occasioned such vehement contests between the two
Houses of Parliament, is probably silenced for ever.

"During
THE LIFE OF DE FOE.
"During the sirst; fury of high-flying," says he,
"I fell a sacrifice for writing against the madness
of that high party, and in the service of the Dissen-
ters." He alludes here to The Shortest Way; which
he published towards the end of the year 1702; and
which is a piece of exquisite irony, though there
are certainly passages in it that might have shewn
considerate men how much the Author had been
in jest. He complains how hard it was, that this
Jkould not have been perceived by all the town, and that
not one man can see it, either churchman or dijenter.
This is one of the strongest proofs, how much the
minds of men were inflamed against each other,
and how little the virtues of mutual forbearance
and personal kindness existed amid the clamour of
contradiction, which then shook the kingdom, and
gave rise to some of the most remarkable events in
our annals. The Commons shewed their zeal, how.
ever they may have studied their dignity, by prose-
cuting * several libelists.
During the previous twenty years of his life, De
Foe had busied himself unconsciously in charging a
mine, which now blew himself and his samily into
air. He had fought for Monmouth; he had op-
posed King James; he had vindicated The Revolu-
tion; he had panegyrized King William; he had
defended the rights of the collective body of the

diculed all the high-flyers in the kindom: and he
was at length obliged to seek for shelter from the
indignation of persons and parties, thus overpower-
ing and resistless.
A proclamation was issued in January, 1702—3 *,
offering a reward of fifty pounds for discovering
his retreat. De Foe was described by the Gazette—
"as a middle-sized spare man, about forty years old,
pf a brown complexion, and dark-brown hair,
though he wears a wig, having a hook nose, a
sharp chin, grey eyes, and a large mole near his

most men to a censure of the book, and some peo-
ple are like to come under the displeasure of the Go-
vernment for it; in justice to those who are in dan-
ger to suffer by it; in submission to the Parliament
and Council who may be offended at it; and cour-
tesy to all mistaken people, who, it seems, have not
penetrated into the real design; the Author presents
the world with the genuine meaning of the paper,
which he hopes may allay the anger of Government,
or at least satisfy the minds of such as imagine a
design to inflame and divide us." Neither his fub-
missiveness to the ruling powers, nor his generosity
to his printers, was a susficient shield from the re-
sentment of his enemies. He was found guilty of a
libel, sentenced to the pillory, and adjudged to be
fined and imprisoned. Thus, as he acknowledges,
was he a second time ruined; and by this affair, as
he asserts, he lost above £3,500 sterling, which
consisted probably in his brick works and in the more
abundant product of his pen.
When, by these means, immured in Newgate, our
Author consoled himself with the animating reflec-
tion, that having meant well he unjustly susfered.
He had a mind too active to be idle in the solitude
of a prison which is seldom invaded by visitors.
.And he wrote a hymn to the pillory, that—
Hieroglyphick state machin,
Contrived to punish sancy in.
In this ode the reader will find satire, pointed by
his sufferings; generous sentiments, arising from his
situation; and an unexpected flow of easy verse.
For example:
The
The first intent of laws
Was to correct the effect, and check the cause.
And all the ends of punishment
"Were only future mischiefs to prevent:
But justice is inverted, when
Those engines of the law,
Instead of pinching vicious men,
Keep honest ones in awe.
He employed this involuntary leisure in correcting
for the press a collection of his writings, which,
with several things he had no hand in, had been al-
ready published by a piratical printer. He thought
it a most unaccountable boldness in him to print
that particular book called The Shortest Way with the
Dijfcnters, while he lay under the public resentment
for the same sact. In this collection of 1703, there
are one-and-twenty treatises in poetry and prose,
beginning with The True-born Englishman, and end-
ing with The Shortest Way to Peace and Union. To
this volume there was prefixed the first print of De
Foe; to which was afterwards added, the apt in-
scription: Laudatur et alget.
In the solitariness of a goal, the energy of De Foe
projected The Review. This is a periodical paper
in quarto, which was first published on the 19th of
February, 1703—4; and which was intended to
treat of news, foreign and domestic; of politics,
British and European; of trade, particular and uni-
versal. But our Author foresaw, from the natural
aver/ion of the age to any tedious affair, that however
profitable, the world would never read, if it were
not diverting. With this design, both instructive
and amusing, he skilfully institutes a Scandal Club,
C c 2 which

which discusses questions in divinity, morals, war,
trade, language, poetry, love, marriage, drunken-
ness, and gaming. Thus, it is easy to see, that
The Review pointed the way to the Tatlers, Spec-
tators, and Guardians, which may be allowed how-
ever to have treated those interesting topics with
more delicacy of humour, more terseness of style^
and greater depth of learning: yet, has De Foe
• many passages, both of prose and poetry, which, for
refinement of wit, neatness of expression, and effi-
cacy of moral, would do honour to Steele or to
Addifon. Of all this was Johnson unconscious, when
he speaks of the Tatlers and Spectators as the first
English writers who had undertaken to reform either
the savageness of neglect, or the impertinence of
civility; to shew when to speak, or to be silent; how
to refuse, or how to comply.
In the midst of these labours our Author publish-
ed, in July 1704, The Storm; or, a collection of
the most remarkable casualties, which happened in
the tempest, on the 23d of November, 1703. In
explaining the natural causes of winds De Foe shews
more science, and in delivering the opinions of the an-
cients that this island was moresubjccl to forms than
other parts of the worlds he displays more literature,
than he has been generally supposed to possess.
Our Author is moreover entitled to yet higher
praise. He seized that awful occasion to inculcate
the fundamental truths of religion; the being of a
God, the superintendency of Providence, the cer-
tainty of heaven and hell, the one to reward, the
other to punish.
While, *as he tells himself, he lay friendless
in the prison of Newgate, his samily ruined, and
himself
3^9
himself without hopes of deliverance, a message was
brought him from a person of honour, whom till
that time be had not the least knowledge of. This
was no less a person than Sir Robert Harley, the
Speaker of the House of Commons. Harley ap-
proved probably of the principles and conduct of
De Foe, and doubtless foresaw, that, during a sac-
tious age, such a genius could be converted to many
uses. And he sent a verbal message to the prisoner,
desiring to ktiozv what he could do for him. Our Au-
thor readily wrote the story of the blind man in the
Gospel; concluding—Lord, that I may receive my
sight.
When the high-flyers were driven from the station
which enabled them to inflame rather than conciliate,
Harley became Secretary of State, in April 1704.
He had now frequent opportunities of representing
the unmerited sufferings of De Foe to the £>ueen and
to the Treasurer; yet, our Author continued four
months longer in goal. The Queen, however, in.
quired into his circumstances; and Lord Godol-
phin sent, as he thankfully acknowledges, a consi-
derable sum to his wife, and to him money to pay
his fine and the expence of his discharge. Here is
the foundation, says he, on which he built his first
sense of duty to the Queen, and the indelible bond of
gratitude to his first benefaclor. "Let any one say,
then," he asks, " what I could have done, less or
more than I have done for such a Queen and such a
benesactor?" All this he manfully avowed to the
world *, when Queen Anne lay lifeless and cold as
King William, his first patron; and when Oxford,
* By his Appeal ia 171 j. ,
C.c3' in
in the vicissitude of party, had been persecuted by
saction, and overpowered, though not conquered,
by violence.
Such was the high interposition by which De Foe
was relieved from Newgate, in August 1704. In
order to avoid the town-talk, he retired immediately
to St. Edmund's Bury: but his retreat did not pre-
vent persecution. Dyer, the news-writer, propa-
gated that De Foe had fled from justice. Fox, the
bookseller, published that he had deserted his
security. Stephen, a state-messenger, every where
said, that he had a warrant for seizing him.
This I suppose was wit, during the witty age of
Anne. In our duller days of law, such out-
rages would be referred to the judgment of a Jury.
De Foe informed the Secretary of State where he
was, and w hen he v\ ould appear; but he was told
not to fear, as he had not transgressed. Notwithstand-
ing this vexation, our Author's muse produced, on
the 29th of August 1704, A Hymn to Viclory, when
the successful skill of Marlborough furnished our
poets with many occasions to publish Gazettes in
Rhyme.
De Foe opened the year 1704—5 with his Double
.welcome to the Duke of Marlborough; disclaiming any
expectation of place or pension. 11 is encomiastic
strains, I fear, were not heard while he wrote,
like an honest Englishman, against the continuance
of the war—a war indeed of personal glory, of na-
tional celebration, but of fruitless expence. De
Foe's activity, or his needs, produced in March
1705, The Confolidator; or, Memoirs of Sundry
Transactions, from the world in the moon. It was
one of De Foe's felicities to catch the living manners
2 aj
as they rose, or one of his resources, to Jhootfolly as it
fiew. In the lunar language he applies his satiric
file to the prominences of every character: of the
poets, from Dryden to Durfy; of the wits, from Ad-
dison to Prior; of the metaphysicians, from Mal-
branche to Hobbs; of the free-thinkers, from Asgyl
to the Tale of a Tub. Our author continually com-
plains of the ill usage of the world; but with all his
acuteness he did not advert, thdt he who attacks the
world, will be by the world attacked. He makes the
lunar politicians debate the policy of Charles XII. in
pursuing the Saxons and Poles, while the Musco-
vites ravaged his own people. I doubt whether it
were on this occasion that the Swedish Ambassador
was so ill-advised as to complain against De Foe, for
merited ridicule of a futile warsare. They had not
then discovered, that the best defence against the;
shafts of satire is to let them fly. Our Author's sen-
timent was expanded by Johnson, in those energetic
lines, which thus conclude the character of the
Swedish Charles;
"Who left the name, at which the world grew pale,
"To point a moral, or adorn a tale."
De Foe was so little disturbed by the appearance
of The Moon Calf, or accurate reflections on the
Consolidator, that he plunged into a controversy with
Sir Humphrey Mackworth about his bill for employ-
ing the poor. This had been passed by the Com-
mons, with great applause, but received by the
Peers with suitable caution. De Foe, considering
this plausible project as an indigested chaos, represented
it, through several reviews, as a plan which would
C c 4 ruin
THE LIFE OF DE FOE.
ruin the industrious, and thereby augment the poor.
Sir Humphrey endeavoured to support his work-
houses, in every parish, with a parochial capital
for carrying on parochial manusacture. This drew
from De Foe his admirable treatise, which he en-
titled Giving alms no charity. As an English Free-
holder he claimed it as a right to address his per-
formance to the House of Commons, having a par-
ticular interest in the common good; but, consider-
ing the persons before whom he appeared, he laid
down his" archness, and assumed his dignity. He
maintained, with wonderful knowledge of sact and
power of argument, the following positions: ist, That
there is inEnglandmore labour than hands to perform
it; and consequently a want of people, not of em-
ployment : — 2dly, No man in England, of sound
limbs and senses, can be poor merely for want of
work:—3dly, All workhouses for employing the
poor, as now they are employed, serve to the ruin
of samilies and the increase of the poor :— 4thly,
It is a regulation of the poor that is wanted, not a
setting them to work. Longer experience shews
this to be a difficult subject, which increases in dif-
ficulty with the esiluxion of time.
De Foe had scarcely dismissed Sir Humphrey,
when he introduced Lord Haversham, a peer, who
is samous in our story, as a maker and publisher of
speeches. His Lordfnip published his speech on the
state of^the nation in 1705, which was cried about
the town with unusual earnestness. Our Author's
prudence induced him to give no answer to the
speech; but a pamphlet, which was hawked about
the streets and fold for a penny, our Author's
shrewdness considered as a challenge to every reader*
He
393
He laughed and talked so much, through several Re-
views, about this sactious esfusion, as to provoke a
defence of topics, which his Lordship ought neither
to have printed nor spoken. Be Foe now published
a Reply to Lord Haversham's vindication of bis Speech.
During such battles the town never saite to cheer the
smaller combatant. Our Author, with an allusion
to the biography of both, says sarcastically: "But,
sate that makes footballs of men, kicks some up
stairs, and some down; some are advanced without
honour, others suppressed without infamy; some are
raised without merit, some are crushed without a crime;
and no man knows by the beginning of things, whe-
ther his course shall issue in a peerage or a pillory."
In the midst of these disputes, either grave or lu-
dicrous, De Foe published Advice to all Parties. He
strenuously recommends that moderation and for-
bearance, which his opponents often remarked he
was not so prone to practice as to preach. While
he thus gave advice to all parties, he conveyed many
salutary lessons to the Dissenters, whom he was
zealous to defend. In the Review, dated the 25th
of December 1705, he conjures them for God's
sake, if not for their own sake, to be content. "Are
there a few things more you could wish were done
for you? resolve these wishes into two conclusions:
1st, Wait till Providence, if it shall be for your
good, shall bring them to pass; 2dly, Compare the
present with the past circumstances, and you can-
not repine without the highest ingratitude both to
God and man."
De Foe found leisure, notwithstanding all those
labours, perhaps a necessity, to publish in 1705, A
Second Volume of the Writings of the Author of the True.

born Englishman. The same reasons which formerly-
induced him to collec l some loose pieces, held good,
says he, for proceeding to a second volume, " that
if I do not, somebody else will do it for me." He
laments the scandalous liberty of the press; whereby.
piratic printers deprive an author of the native pro-
duct of his own thought, and the purity of his own
style. It is said, though perhaps without authority,
that the vigorous remonstrances of De Foe procured
The* Aclfor the encouragement of learning, by vesting
the copies of printed books in the authors or their assigns.
The vanity of an administration, which affected
to patronize the learned, concurring with the mu.
tual interest of bookmakers and booksellers, pro-
duced this salutary law, that our Author alone had
called for without success. De Foe's writings, thus
collected into volumes, were soon a third time
printed, with the addition of a key. The satire be-
ing now pointed by the specification of characters,
and obscurities being illuminated by the annexation
of circumstances, a numerous class of readers were
induced, by their zeal of party, or defire of scan-
dal, to look for gratification from our Author's
treatises. He is studious to complain, That his writ-
ings had been most neglccled of them, who at the same
time have owned them useful. The second volume of
1705, containing eighteen treatises in prose and
rhyme, begins with A new Discovery of an old In-
trigue, and ends with Royal Religion.
The year 1705 was a year of disquiet to De Foe,
not so much from the oppressions of state as from
the persecutions of party. When his business, of
* 9 Anne, c. 19,
whatever
whatever nature, led him to Exeter, and other west-
ern .towns, in August, September, and October,
1705, a project was formed to fend him as a soldier
to the army, at a time w hen footmen were taken
from the coaches as recruits: but conscious of his
being a Freeholder of England, and a Liveryman of
London, he knew that such characters could not be
violated, in this nation, with impunity. When some
of the Western Justices, of more zeal of party than
fense of duty, heard from his opponents of De Foe's
journey, they determined to apprehend him as a
vagabond: but our Author, who, among other qua-
lities, had pers>nal courage in a high degree, reflected,
that to sace danger is most effectually to prevent it.
In his absence, real suits were commenced against
him for sictitious debts: but De Foe advertised, that
genuine claims he would sairly satisfy. If all these
uncommon circumstances had not been published
in The Review, we should not have seen this striking

we at present, that the Editor of a newspaper, how-
ever obnoxious to any party, may travel peaceably
about his affairs over England, without fear of in-
terruption. Were a Justice of Peace, from what-

magistrate would be overwhelmed by the public in-
dignation, and punished by the higher guardians of
our quiet and our laws.

A few weeks after he gave the world a second essay,
to soften rancour and defeat perversity. But the
time was now come, when he was to perform what
he had often promised: and his fruitfulness produced
in July 1706, Jure Divino, a satire against tyranny
"and passive obedience, which had been delayed, for
fear, as he declares, of parliamentary censure. Of
this poem, it cannot be said, as of Thomson's Li-
berty, that // was written to prove what no man ever
denied. This satire, says the presace, had never
been published, though some of it has been a long
time in being, had not the world seemed to be go-
ing mad a second time with the error of passive obedi-
ence, and non-rejislance. And because some men
require, says he, more explicit answers, I declare
my belief, that a monarchy, according to the pre-
sent constitution, limited by Parliament, and depend-
ent upon law, is not only the best government in thœ
world, but also the best for this nation in par-
ticular, most suitable to the genius of the people,
and the circumstances of the whole body. Drvden
had given an example, a few years before, of ar-
gumentative poetry in his Hind and Panther;
by which he endeavoured to defend the tenets of the
Church of Rome. Our author now reasoned in
rhyme, through twelve books, in defence of every
man's birth-right by nature, when all sorts of liberty
were run down and opposed. His purpose is doubt-
less honester than Dryden's; and his argument, be-
ing in support of the better cause, is perhaps superior
in strength: but in the Jure Divine we look in
vain for
The varying verse, the full-resounding line,
The Jong majestic march, and energy divine.

Our author was soon after engaged in more im-
portant, because much more useful, business. Lord
Godolphin, who knew how to discriminate charac-
ters, determined to employ him on an errand,
which, as he says, was sar from being unfit for a
Sovereign to direct, or an honest man to perform.
By his Lordship he was carried to the Queen, who
said to him, while he kissed her hand*, that she had
such satisfaction in his former services, that she had
again appointed him for another affair, which was
something nice, but the treasurer would tell him the
reft. In three days he was sent to Scotland. His
knowledge of commerce and revenue, his powers of
insinuation, and above all his readiness of pen, were
deemed of no small utility in promoting the Union.
He arrived at Edinburgh, in October 1706. And
we shall find him no inconsiderable actor in the
performance of that greatest of all good works. He
attended the committees of Parliament, for whose
use he made several of the calculations f on the sub-
ject of trade and taxes. He complains \, however,
that when afterwards some clamour was raised upon
the inequality of the proportions, and the contrivers
began to be blamed, and a little threatened a-la-mob,
then it was D. V. § made it all, and he was to be
stoned for it. He endeavoured to confute || all that

was published by Webster, and Hodges, and the other
writers in Scotland against the Union: and he had
his share of danger, since, as he says, he was
watched by the mob; had his chamber windows
insulted; but, by the prudence of his friends, and
God's providence, he escaped *. In the midst of
this great scene of business and tumult, he collected
the documents, which he afterwards published for
the instruction of posterity, with regard to one of
the most difficult, and, at the same time, the most
fortunate, transactions, in our annals.
During all those labours and risques, De Foe pub-
lished, in December 1706, Caledonia, a Poem, in
honour of the Scots nation. This poetic essay,
which was intended to rescue Scotland from Jlander
in opinion, Caledonia herself bade him dedicate to
the Duke of Queensberry. Beside other benesac-
tions, the Commissioner gave the author, whom he
calls Daniel De Foe, Esquire, an exclusive privilege
to fell his encomiastic strains for seven years, with-
in the country of his celebration. Amidst our
Author's busy occupations at Edinburgh, he was
anxious to assure the world, that wherever the wri-
ter may be, the Reviews are written with his own
hand; no person having, or ever had, any concern
in writing them, but the known author, D. F. On
the 16th of January, the act of Union was passed
by the Scots Parliament; and De Foe returned
to London, in February 1706-7. While he thus
acted importantly at Edinburgh, he formed con-

of his future correspondence, and profited from bis

Howour Author was rewarded by the ministers who
derived a benefit from those services, and from that
danger, as he does not tell, cannot now be known.
Before his departure for Scotland, indeed, Lord
Godolphin, as he acknowledges f, obtained for
him the continuance of an appointment, which her
Majesty, by the interposition of his first benesactor,
had been pleased to make him, in consideration of a
former service, in a foreign country, wherein he run
as much risque as a grenadier on the counter-scarp.
As he was too prudent to disclose his secret services.,
they must at present remain undiscovered. Yet is
there reason to think that he had a pension rather
than an office, since his name is not in the red book of
the Queen; and he solemnly avers, in bis Appeals
that he had not interest enough with Lord Oxford
• Lord Buchan was so obliging as to communicate the subjoined
extract of a letter to his Lordship's grandfather, the Earl of
Buchan, from De Foe, dated the 29th of May, 1711 :—" The

Jhip'i friend, has been strangely taken up, since I had that occa-
sion; was. first, in suffering the operation of the surgeons to heal
the wound of the assassin; and since, in accumulating honours
from Parliament, the Queen, and the people. On Thursday
evening her Majelty created him Earl Mortimer, Earl of Oxford,
and Lord Hailcy of Wigmore: and we expect that to-morrow in
council he will have the white staff given him by the Queen, and
be declared Lord High Treasurer. I wrote this yesterday; and
this day, May the 29th, he is made Lord High Treasurer cf
Great Britain, and carried the white staff before the Queen this

to
to procure him the arrears due to him in the time of the
former Ministry. This appointment, whatever it were,
he is studious to tell, he originally owed to
Harley:. he, however, thankfully acknowledges,
that Lord Godolphin continued his savour to him
after the unhappy breach that separated his first be-
nesactor from the Minister, who continued in power
till August 1710.
The nation, which was filled with combustible
matter, burst into flame the moment of that memo-
rable separation, in 1707. In the midst of this
conflagration our Author was not inactive. He
waited on Harley after he had been driven from
power, who generously advised him to continue his
services to the J(>ueen, which he supposed would have n»
relation to personal differences among statesmen. Go-
dolphin received him with equal kindness, by say-
ing—/ always think a man honest till I find to the
contrary. And if we may credit De Foe's assevera-
tions, in the presence of those who could have con-
victed him of salsehood, he for three years held m
correspondence with his principal benefaclor, which the.
great man never took ill cf him.
As early as February 1706—7, De Foe avowed
his purpose to publish the History of the Union, which
he had ably assisted to accomplish. This design he
executed in 1709, though he was engaged in other
lucubrations, and gave the world a Review three
times a week. His history seems to have been
little noticed when it first appeared; for^ as the
presace states, it had many difficulties in the way;
many sactions to encounter, and parties to please.
Yet it was republished in 1712; and a third time in
1786, when a similar union had become the topic
of public debate and private conversation. The
subject of this work is the completion of a measure,
which was carried into esfect, notwithstanding ob-
structions apparently insurmountable, and tumults
approaching to rebellion, and which has produced the
ends designed,beyond expectation, whether we consider
its influence ontheGovernment,or its operationonthe
governed. The minuteness with which he describes
what he saw andheard on the turbulent stage, where he
acted a conspicuous part, is extremely interesting to
us, who wish to know what actually pasted, however
this circumstantiality may have disgusted contempo-
raneous readers. History is chiefly valuable as it
transmits a saithful copy of the manners and sentiments
of every age. This narrative of De Foe is a drama,
in which he introduces the highest peers and the
lowest peasants, speaking and acting, according as
they were each actuated by their characteristicpassions;
and while the man of taste is amused by his manner,
the man of business may draw instruction from the
documents, which are appended to the end, and in-
terspersed in every page. This publication had alone
preserved his name, had his Crusoe pleased us less.
De Foe published in 1709, what indeed required
less esfort of the intellect or the hand, The History of
Addresses; with no design, he says, and as we may
believe, to disturb the public peace, but to com-
pare the present tempers of men with the past, in
order to discover who had altered for the better, and
who for the worse. He gave a second volume of Ad-
dresses in 1711, with remarks serious and comical.
His purpose plainly was to abate, by ridicule, the
public fervour with regard to Sachevcrel, who, by
Vol. II. D d I know
I know not what satality, or folly, gave rise to
eventful changes. De Foe evinces, by these timeful
publications, that amidst all that enthusiasm and
tumult, he preserved his fenses, and adhered to his
principles.
When, by such imprudence as the world had never
seen before, Godolphin was in his turn expelled, in
August 171 o, our Author waited on the ex-minister;
who obligingly said to him, That be had the same
good-will, but not the same power to assist him: and
Godolphin told him, what was of more real use—
1o receive the Satteen's commands from her confidential
servants, when he saw thingsfettled. It naturally oc-
curred to De Foe, that it was his duty to go along
with the^Ministers, while, as he says, they did not
break in on the constitution. And who can blame
a very subordinate officer, (if indeed he held an
office), who had a wife and six children to maintain
with very precarious means? He was thus, says he,
cast back providentially on his first benesactor, who
laid his case before her Majesty, whereby he preserved
his interest, without any engagement. On that me-
morable change De Foe however somewhat changed
his tone. The method I shall take, says he*, in talking
of the public affairs, shall for the future be, though
with the same design to support truth, yet with more
caution of embroiling myself with a party, who have
no mercy, and who have no sense of service.
De Foe now lived at Newington, in comfortable
circumstances, publishing The Reviews, and send-
ing out such tracts, as either gratified his prejudices,
or supplied his needs. During that contentious pe-

tiod he naturally gave and received many wounds;
and he prudently entered into a truce with Mr. J.
Dyer, who was engaged in similar occupations, that,
however they might clash in party, they may write
without personal reflections, and thus disfer still, and
yet preserve the Christian and the gentleman *.

Mr. Dyer,
I have your letter. I am rather glad to find you
put it upon the trial who was aggressor, than justify a thing
which I am sure you cannot approve; and in this I assure you I
am far from injuring you, and refer you to the time when long
since you had wrote / wasfledfrom juJlice: one Sammon being taken
up for printing a libel, and / being then on a journey, nor the least
charge against me for being concerned in it by any body but your
letter: — also many unkind personal reflections on me in your
letter, when I was in Scotland, on the affair of the Union, and I assure
you, when my paper had not in the least mentioned you, and
those I reser to time and date for the proof of.
I mention this only in desence of my last letter, in which I said
no more of it than to let you see I did not merit such treatment,
and could nevertheless be content to render any service to you,
though I thought myself hardly used.
But to state the matter fairly between you and I, [me] a writ-
ing for different interests, and so possibly coming und :r an una-
voidable necessity of jarring in several cases: I am ready to make a
fair truce of honour with you, viz. that if what either party are
doing, or saying, that may clash with the party we are for, and
urge us to speak, it shall be done without naming either's name,
and without personal reflections; and thus we may differ still, and
yet preserve both the Christian and the gentleman.

But between professed controvertists such a treaty
could only be persevered in with Punic saith.
While thus occupied, De Foe was not forgotten
by the City of Edinburgh with the usual ingratitude
of public bodies. On the first of February 1710-n,
that Corporation, remembering his Caledonia, em-
powered him to publish the Edinburgh Courant, in
the room of Adam Booge *, though I suspect that he
did not continue long to edify the Edinburgh citi-
This 1 think is an offer may satisfy you. I have not been de-
sirous of giving just offence to you, neither would I to any man,
however I may differ from him; and I see no reason why I should
affront a man's person, because I do not join with him in prin-
ciple. I please myself with being the first proposer of so fair a
treaty with you, because I believe, as you cannot deny its being
very honourable, so it is not less so in coming first from me, who
I believe could convince you of my having been the first and most
ill-treated—for further proof of which I refer you to your letters,
at the time I was threatened by the Envoy of the King of Sweden.
However, Mr. Dyer, this is a method which may end what i»
past, and prevent what is future; and if refused, the future part
I am sure cannot lye at my door.
As to your letter, your proposal is so agreeable to me, that
truly without it I could not have taken the thing at all: for it
would have been a trouble intolerable, both to you as well as me,
to take your letter every post, first from you, and then send it
to the post-house.
Your method of sending to the black box, is just what I de-
signed to propose, and Mr. Shaw will doubtless take it of you: if
you think it needful for me to speak to him it shall be done—
What I want to know is only the charge, and that you will order
it constantly to be sent, upon hinting whereof I shall send you
the names. Wishing you success in all things (Tour opinions of
Government excepted) I am,
Your humble servant,

zens by his weekly lucubrations. He had then
much to think of, and much to do at a distance:
and he soon after gave some support to Lord Ox-
ford's South-sea project, by publishing An E/say on
the South-sea Trade, with an inquiry into the reasons
of the present complaint against the settlement of the
South-sea Company. In the same year he published

The Ministers, by the course of events, were en-

can be assigned to British statesmen—the re-establish*
ment of tranquillity after a glorious war. The
treaty at Utrecht furnishes a memorable example of
this. The furious debates which ensued within the

assisted by Doctor D'Avenant; but the latter solemnly
denied it: and it soon after appeared to be the
production of Daniel De Foe, an ambidextrous
hireling, who for this dirty work received a large
weekly allowance from the Treasury. T hat he wrote
in the Mercator, De Foe admits; but he expressly
denies " that he either was the Author of it, had
the property of it, the printing of it, the profit of it,
or had the power to put any thing into it, if he
would." And, by his Appeal, he affirms before
God and the world, " that he never had any pay-
ment, or reward, for writing any part of it." Yet,
that he was ready to defend those papers of the
Mercator which were really his, if men would an-
swer with arguments, rather than abuse; though
not those things which he had never written, but
for which he had received such usage. He adds,
with the noble spirit of a true-born Englishman,
"The press was open to me as well as to others;
and how, or when I lost my English liberty of
speaking my mind, I know not: neither how my
speaking my opinions, without fee or reward, could
authorise any one to call me villain, rascal, traitor,
and such opprobrious names."
Of the imputed connexion with his jirsl benefactor,
Harley, during that memorable period, our Author
speaks with equal firmness, at a moment when sirm-
plainly mentioned in the fourth. Mr. Daniel Foe may change
his name from Review to Mercator, from Mercator to any other
title, yet still his singular genius mall be distinguished by his ini-
mitable way of writing. Thus personal sarcasm was introduced
to supply desicience of facts, or weakness of reasoning. When
Charles King republifhed The British Merchant in volumes, among.
various changes, he expunged, with other personalities, the name
of De Foe.
ness was necessary. "I solemnly protest," says he,
by his Appeals " in the presence of Him who mall
judge us all, that I have received no instructions,
orders, or directions for writing any thing, or ma-
terials from Lord Oxford, since Lord Godolphin
was Treasurer, or that I have ever shewn to Lord
Oxford any thing I had written or printed."
He challenges the world to prove the contrary;
and he affirms, that he always capitulated for
liberty to speak, according to his own judgment of
things. As to consideration, pension, or reward, he
declares most solemnly that he had none, except
his old appointment made him long before by Lord
Godolphin. What is extremely probable we may
easily credit, without such strong asseverations.
However Lord Oxford may have been gratified by
the voluntary writings of De Foe, he had doubtless
other persons who shared his confidence, and wrote
his Examiners *.
But De Foe published that, which by no means pro-
moted Lord Oxford's views, and which, therefore,
gained little of his savour. Our Author wrote
* It is now sufficiently known, That Lord Oxford had relin-
quished the Treaty of Commerce to its fate, before it was finally de-
bated in Parliament. See much curious matter on this subject in
Macpherson's State Papers, vol. ii. p. 421-23. It is there said,
that he gave up the commercial treaty, in compliment to Sir
Thomas Hanmer, as he would by no means be an occasion of a
breach among friends. The Treasurer had other reasons: The
treaty had been made by Bolingbroke, whom he did not love;
the Lords Anglesea and Abingdon had made extravagant de-
mands for their support; and, like a wise man, he thought it
idle to drive a nail that would not go. Yet Lord Halifax boasted
to the Hanoverian minister, That he alone had been the occasion of the
treaty being rejecled. Same papers, p. 509-47.
D d 4 against

against the peace of Utrecht, because he approved
of it as little as he had done the treaty at Gertruy-
denburgh, under very different influences, a few
years before. The peace he was for, as he himself
says, was such as should neither have given the
Spanish monarchy to the House of Bourbon, nor to
the House of Austria; but that this bone of conten-
tion should have been so broken to pieces, as that it
should not have been dangerous to Europe; and
that England and Holland should have so strength-
ened themselves, by sharing its commerce, as should
have made them no more afraid of France, or the
Emperor; and that all that we should conquer in the
Spanish West Indies should be our own. But it is
equally true, he asfirms, that when the peace was
established, " I thought our business was to make
the best of it; and rather to inquire what improve-
ments could be made of it, than to be continually
exclaiming against«those who procured it."
He manfully avowed his opinion in 1715, when
it was both disgraceful and dangerous, that the 9th
article of the Treaty of Commerce was calculated
for the advantage of our trade; " Let who will make
it, that," says he, "is nothing to me. My reasons
are, because it tied up the French to open the door
to our manusactures, at a certain duty of importation
there, and left the Parliament of Britain at liberty to
shut their's out, by as high duties as they pleased
here, there being no limitation upon us, as to duties
on French goods, but that other nations should pay
the same. While the French were thus bound, and
the British free, I always thought we must be in a
condition to trade to advantage, or it must be our
own sault: this was my opinion, and is sostill; and
I would
I would engage to maintain it against any man, on a
public stage, before a jury of fifty merchants, and
venture my life upon the cause, if I were.assured of
fair play in the dispute. But, that it was my opi-
nion, we might carry on a trade with France to our
great advantage, and that we ought for that reason
to trade with them, appears in the third, fourth,
fifth, and sixth volumes of The Reviews, above nine
years before The Mercator was thought of." Expe-
rience has decided in savour of De Foe against his
opponents, with regard both to the theory and the
practice of commerce.
In May 1713, our Author relinquished the Re-
view, after nine years continuance: in Newgate it
began, and in Newgate it ended. Whether we
consider the frequency of the publication, or the
power of his disquisitions, the pertinacity of his op-
ponents, or the address of his defences, amid other
studies, without assistants, this must be allowed to
be such a work, as few of our writers have equal-
led. Yet, of this great performance, said Gay;
"The poor Review is quite exhausted, and grown
so very contemptible, that though he has provoked
all his brothers of the quill, none will enter into a
controversy with him. The fellow, who had excel-
lent natural parts, but wanted a small foundation
of learning, is a lively instance of those wits, who,
as an ingenious author says, will' endure but one*

Scriblerus Club, who thought themselves the wisest,
the wittiest, and virtuousest men, that ever were, or

ever would be. But of all their works, which
of them have been so often flammed, or yielded such
cream, as Robinson Crusoe, the Family Instructor, or
Religious Courtslrip? Some of their writings may
indeed be allowed to have uncommon merit; yet,
let them not arrogate exclusive excellence, or claim
appropriate praise.
When De Foe relinquished the Review, he began
to write A General History of Trade, which he pro-
posed to publish in monthly numbers. The first
number appeared on the first of August 1713. His
great design was to shew the reader, " What the whole
world is at this time employed in as to Trade" But
his more immediate end was, to reclify the mistake we
are fallen into as to Commerce, and to inform those
who are willing to inquire into the truth. In the
execution of this arduous undertaking, he avows his
intention of speaking what reason dictates and fact:
justifies, however he may clash with the popular
opinions of some people in trade. He could not
however wholly abstract himself from the pasting
scene. When his second number appeared, on the
15th of August i7I3, he gave a discourse on the har-
bour of Dunkirk; wherein he insists, that the port
ought to be destroyed, if it must remain with France;
but, if it were added to England, or made a free-
port, it would be for the good of mankind to have a
safe harbour in such dangerous seas. This History
of Trade, which exhibits the ingenuity, the strength,
and the piety of De Foe, extended only to two num-
bers. The agitations of the times carried him to
other literary pursuits; and the sactiousness of the
times constrained him to attend to personal security.
"While

- <{ While I spoke of things thus," says our Author,
"I bore infinite reproaches, as the defender of the
peace, by pamphlets, which I had no hand in." He
appears to have been silenced by noise, obloquy, and
insult; and finding himself in this manner treated,
he declined writing at all, as he assures us; and for
great part of a year never set pen to paper, except
inThc Reviews. "After this" continues he, " /
-joas a long time absent in the north of England"
though we may easily infer, for a very different rea-
son than that of the samous retirement of Swift,
upon the final breach between Oxford and Boling-
broke.
The place of his retreat is now known to have been
Halisax, or the borders of Lancashire*. And observ-
ing here, as he himself relates, the insolence of the
Jacobite party, and how they insinuated the Preten-
der's rights into the common people, " I set pen to
paper again, by writing A seasonable Caution; and,
to open the eyes of the poor ignorant country peo-
ple, I gave away this all over the kingdom, as gain
was not intended." With the same laudable pur-
pose he wrote three other pamphlets; the first,

• The late History of Halifax relates, That Daniel De Foe,
being forced to abscond, on account of his political writings, re-
iided at Halifax, in the Back-lane, at the sign of the Rose and
Crown, being known to Doctor Nettlcton, the physician, and
the Rev. Mr. Priestley, minister of a dissenting congregation there.
Mr. Watson is mistaken when he supposes that De Foe wrote his
Jure Divino here, which had been published previously in 1706;
and he is equally mistaken, when he fays, that De Foe had made
an improper use of the papers of Selkirk, whose story had been
often published.

third, What if the ^ueen should die?" Nothing
could be more plain," says he, " than that the titles
of these were amusements *, in order to put the books
into the hands of those people, who had been de-
luded by the Jacobites." These petty volumes were
so much approved by the zealous friends of the Pro-
testant succession, that they were diligent to disperse
them through the most distant counties. And De
Foe protests, that had the Elector of Hanover given
him a thousand pounds, he could not have served him
more effectually, than by writing these three trea-
tises.
The reader will learn, with surprise and indigna-
tion, that for these writings De Foe was arrested,
obliged to give eight hundred pounds bail, contrary
to the Bill of Rights, and prosecuted by informa-
tion, during Trinity term 1713. This groundless
prosecution was instituted by the absurd zeal of
"William Benson, who afterwards became ridicu-
lously famous for literary exploits, which justly
raised him to the honours of the Dunciad. Our
Author attributes this prosecution to the malice of
his enemies, who were numerous and powerful.

knew the books were against the Pretender, but that
De Foe had disobliged them in other things, and
they resolved to take this advantage to punish him.

ed on making a proper submission. But it was happy
for De Foe that his first benefactor was still in power,
whoprocured him the Queen's pardon, inNovember*
1713. This act of liberal justice was produced by
the party-writersf °^ those black and bitter days, as an
additional proof of Lord Oxford's attachment to the
abdicated samily, while De Foe was laid to be con-
victed of absolute Jacobitism, contrary to the tenor
of his life, and the purpose of his writings. He him-
self said sarcastically, that they might as well have
made him a Mahometan. On his tomb-stone it
might have been engraved, that he was the only
Englishman who had been obliged to ask a royal par-
don, for writing in savour of the Hanover succession.
"By this time, says Boyer, in October 1714, the
treasonable design to bring in the Pretender was
manifested to the world by the agent of one of the
late managers, De Foe, in his History of the White
Staff. The Detection of the Secret History of the White
Staff, which was soon published, considently tells,
that it was written by De Foe; as is to be seen by
his abundance of words, his salse thoughts, and
his false English \." We now know that there was

THE LIFE OF DE FOE,
at that epoch, no plot in savour of the Pretender-
except in the assertions of those who wished to pro,
mote their interest by exhibiting their zeal. And
I have shewn, that De Foe had done more to keep
out the Pretender, than the political tribe, who pro-
fited from his zeal, yet detracted from his same.
"No sooner was the Queen dead," says he,
£t and the King, as right required, proclaimed, but
the rage of men increased upon me to that degree,
that their threats were such as I am unable to ex-
press. Though I have written nothing since the
Queen's death; yet, a great many things are called
by my name, and I bear the answerers insults. I have
not seen or spoken with the Earl of Oxford," con-
tinues he, "since the King's landing, but once; yet,
he bears the reproach of my writing for him, and I
the rage of men for doing it." De Foe appears in-
deed to have been, at that noisy period, stunned by
factious clamour, and overborne, though not silenced,
by unmerited obloquy. He probably lost his original
appointment, when his first benesactor was finally ex-
pelled. Instead of meeting with reward for his
zealous services in support of the Protestant succession,
he was on the accession of George I. discountenanced
by those who had derived a benefit from his active
exertions. And of Addison, who was now exalted
into office, and enjoyed literary patronage, our
os the White Staff. His Grace, indeed, is not in the Catalogue oj
Royal and Noble Authors. Whether the Duke wrote this petty
pamphlet may be doubted ; but there can be no doubt that De Foe
was not the Author: For, he solemnly asserts by his Appeal int
1715, That he had written nothingjince the Queen's death. The inter-
nal evidence is stronger than this positive assertion.
Author
Author had said in his Double Welcome to the Duke of
Marlborougb, with less poetry than truth—
Mæcenas has his modern sancy strung,
And fixed his pension first, or he had never fung.
While thus insulted by enemies, and discounte-
nanced by power, De Foe published his Appeal
to Honour and fustice, in 1715; being a true Ac-
count of bis Conducl in public Affairs. As a motive
for this intrepid measure, he affectingly says, That,
"by the hints of mortality and the infirmities of a
life of sorrow and satigue, I have reason to think,
that I am very near to the great oceanof eternity, and
the time may not be long ere I embark on the last
voyage : wherefore, I think I should even accounts with
this world before I go, that no slanders may lyc
against my heirs, to disturb them in the peaceable
possession of their sather's inheritance, his character."
It is a circumstance perhaps unexampled in the life
of any othes writer, that before he could finissi his
Appeal, he was struck with an apoplexy. After
languishing more than six weeks, neither able to go
on, nor .likely to recover, his friends thought sit to
delay the publication no longer. "It is the opinion
of most who know him," says Baker, the publisher,
"that the treatment which he here complains of,
and others of which he would have spoken, have been
the cause of this disaster." When the ardent mind
of De Foe reflected on what he had done, and what
he had suffered, how he had been rewarded and per-
secuted, his heart melted in despair. His spirit, like
a candle struggling in the socket, blazed and sunk,
and blazed and sunk, till it disappeared in dark-
ness.
While
While his strength remained, he expostulated with
his adversaries in the following terms of great man-
liness, and instructive intelligence :—" It has been
the disaster of all parties in this nation, to be very-
hot in their turn, and as often as they have been so,
I have differed with them all, and shall do so.
I will repeat some of the occasions on the Whig side,
because from that quarter the accusation of my turn-
ing about comes.
"Thefirst time I had the misfortune to differ with
my friends, was about the year 1683, when the
Turks were besieging Vienna, and the Whigs in
England, generally speaking, were for the Turks
taking it; which I, having read the history of the
cruelty and perfidious dealings of the Turks in their
wars, and how they had rooted out the name of the
Christian religion in above three score and ten king.
doms, could by no means agree with: and though
then but a young man, and a younger author, I op-
posed it, and wrote. against it, which was taken
very unkindly indeed.
"The next time I differed with my friends, was
when King James was wheedling the Dissenters to
take off the penal laws and test, which I could by
no means come into. 1 told the Dissenters, I had
rather the Church of England should pull our clothes
off by fines and forfeitures, than the Papiils should
1'all both upon the Church and the Dissenters, and
pull our skins off by fire and saggot.
"The next differencel had with good men,was about
the scandalous practice of occasional conformity, in
which I had the misfortune to make many honest men
angry, rather because I had the better of the argu-
ment, than because they disliked what I said.
And,
"And now I have lived to see the Dissenters them-
selves very quiet; if not very well pleased with an act
of Parliament to prevent it. Their friends indeed laid
it on; they would be friends indeed, if they would
talk of taking it off again.
"Again, I had a breach with honest men for their
male-trenting King William, of which I say nothing;
because I think they are now opening their eyes, and
making what amends they can to his memory.
"The fifth difference I had with them, was about
the treaty of partition, in which many honest men
were mistaken, and in which I told them plainly
then, that they would at last end the war upon
worse terms; and so it is my opinion they would
have done, though the treaty of Gertruydenburgh
had taken place.
"The sixth time I differed with them, was when
the old Whigs sellout with the modern Whigs; and
when the Duke of Marlborough and my Lord Go-
dolphin were used by the Observator in a manner
worse, I confess, for the time it lasted, than ever
they were used since; nay, though it were by Abel
and the Examiner. But the success sailed. In this
dispute my Lord Godolphin did me the honour to
tell me, I had served him and his Grace also, both
faithfully and successfully. But his Lordship is dead,
and I have now no testimony of it, but what is to
be found in the Observator, where I am plentifully
abused for being an enemy to my country, by acting'
in the interest of my Lord Godolphin and the Duke
of Marlborough. What weathercock can turn with
such tempers as these?
"/ am now in the seventh breach with them, and
my crime now is, that I will not believe and say the

it of either of them; and which, if I had believed,
yet I ought not to have been the man that should
have said it, for the reasons aforesaid.
"In such turns of tempers and times a man must
have been ten-fold a Vicar of Bray, or it is impossi-
ble but he must one time or other be out with every
body. This is my present condition; and for this I
am reviled with having abandoned my principles,
turned Jacobite, and what not: God judge between
me and these men! Would they come to any par-
ticulars with me, what real guilt I may have, I
would freely acknowledge; and if they would pro-
duce any evidence of the bribes, the pensions, and
the rewards I have taken, I would declare honestly
whether they were true or no. If they would give
a list of the books which they charge me with, and
the reasons why they lay them at my door, I would
acknowledge any mistake, own what I have done,
and let them know what I have not done. But these
men neither shew mercy, nor leave room for re-
pentance; in which they act not only unlike their
Maker, but contrary to'his express commands *."
With
• The most solemn afleverations, and the most unanswerable
arguments of our Author, were not, after all, believed. When
Charles King re-published The British Merchant, in 1721, he with-
out a scruple attributed The Mercator to a hireling writer of a
weekly paper called The Review. And Anderson, at a still later
period, goes further in his Chronology of Commerce, and names
De Foe, as the hireling writer of The Mercator, and other papers
in favour of the French treaty of trade. We can now judge
with
With the same independence of spirit, but with
greater modesty of manner, our Author openly dis-
approved of the imtemperance, which was adopted
by Government in 1714, contrary to the original pur-
pose of George I. "It is and ever was my opi-
nion," says De Foe in bis Appeal, " that modera-
tion is the only virtue by which the tranquillity of
this nation can be preserved; and even the King
himself, (I believe his Majesty will allow me that
freedom,) can only be happy in the enjoyment of
the crown, by a moderate administration: if he
mould be obliged, contrary to his known disposition,
to join with intemperate councils, if it does not
lessen his security, I am persuaded it will lessen his
satissaction. To attain at the happy calm, which is
the consideration that mould move us all, (and
he would merit to be called the nation's phy-
sician, who could prescribe the specific for it,) I
think I may be allowed to say, a conque/i of parties
.will never do it, a balance of parties may." Such was
the political testament of De Foe; which it had been
happy for Britain, had it been as saithfully executed
as it was wisely made!
The year 1715 may be regarded as the period of
our Author's political life. Faction henceforth
found other advocates, and parties procured other
writers to propagate their salsehoods. Yet, when a
with the impartiality of arbitrators: on the one hand, there are
the living challenge, and the death-bed declaration of De Foe;
on the other, the mere surmise and unauthorised assertion of
King, Anderson, and others, who detract from their own vera-
city by their own factiousness, or foolery. It is surely time .to
free ourselves from prejudices of every kind, and to disregard the
sound of names as much as the falsehoods of party.
£ e 2
cry
cry was raised against foreigners, on the accession of*
George I. The True-born Englishman was revived,
rather by Roberts the bookseller, than by De Foe
the Author *. But the persecutions of party did
not cease when De Foe ceased to be a party-writer.
He was insulted by Boy er, in April 1716, as the
author of The Triennial Acl impartially stated: "but,
whatever was offered," says Boyer, " against the
Septennial Bill, was fully confuted by the ingenious
and judicious Joseph Addison, Esquire." Whether
De Foe wrote in defence of the people's rights, or
in support of the law's authority, he is to be cen-
sured: whether Addison defended the Septennial
Bill, or the Peerage Bill, he is to be praised. Wit3i
the same misconception of the sact, and malignancy
of spirit, Tolland reviled f De Foe for writing an
answer to The State Anatomy, in 1717. The time
however will at last come, when the world will
judge of men from their actions rather than pre-
tensions.
The death of Anne, and the accession of George I.
seem to have convinced De Foe of the vanity of
party-writing. And from this eventful epoch, he ap-
pears to have studied how to meliorate rather than to
harden the heart; how to regulate, more than to
vitiate, the practice of life.
Early in 1715 he published The Family Instructor,
in three parts: 1st, relating to sathers and children;
2<3, to masters and servants; 3d, to husbands and
wives. He carefully concealed his authorship, lest
the good effects of his labour should be obstructed by
the great imperfections of the writer. The world

was then too busy to look immediately into the work.
The bookseller soon procured a recommendatory let-
ter from the Reverend Samuel Wright, a well-
known preacher in the Black-Friars. It was praised
from the pulpit and the press: and the utility of the
end, with the attractiveness of the execution, gave
it, at length, a general reception *. The Author's
first design was to write a Dramatic Poem; but the
subject was too solemn, and the text too copious, to
admit of restraint, or to allow excursions. His
purpose was to divert and instrucl, at the same mo-
ment; and by giving it a dramatic form, it has been
called by some A religious play. De Foe at last says
with his usual archness: As to its being called a play,
be it called so, if they please: it must be confessed,
some parts of it are too much acted in many sami-
lies among us. The Author wishes, that either all
our Plays were as useful for the improvement and
entertainment of the world, or that they were less
encouraged. There is, I think, some mysticism in
the presace, which, it were to be defired, a judicious
hand would expunge, when The Family Instructor
shall be again reprinted; for, reprinted it will be,
while our language endures; at least, while wife men
shall continue to consider the influences of religion
and the practice of morals as of the greatest use to
society.
• The family of George I. had been instructed by the copy of
this book, which is in The Museum. It would seem from the
title page and Mr. Wright's letter being printed on a different
paper from the work itself, that both were added after the first,
publication. The Family Instructor and Mr. Wright's letter
ivere entered at Stationers Hall, for Emanuel Mathews, on the
31st of March, 1715.
E e 3 De
THE LIFE OF DE FOE.
De Foe afterwards added a second volume, in two
parts; ist, relating to Family Breaches; 2dly, to the
great Mi/lake, of mixing the Passions in the managing of
Children. He considered it, indeed, as a bold adven-
ture to write a second volume of any thing; there
being a general opinion among modern readers, that
second parts never come up to the spirit of the sirst.
He quotes Mr. Milton, for disfering from the world
upon the question, and for affirming with regard to
his own great performances, That the people had a
general fense of the loss of Paradise, but not ah equal
gust for regaining it. Of De Foe's second volume,
it will be easily allowed, that it is as instructive and
pleasing as the first. His Religions Courtship, which
he published in 1722, may properly be considered as
a third volume: For the design is equally moral, the
manner is equally attractive, and it may in the same
manner be called a Religious Play.
But the time at length came, when De Foe was
to deliver to the world the most popular of all his
performances. In April 1719, he published the
well-known Life and surprising Adventures of Robin-
son Crusoe. The reception was immediate and univer-
sal; and Taylor, who purchased the manuscript
after every bookseller had refused it, is said to have
gained a thousand pounds. If it be inquired by
what charm it is that these surprising Adventures
should have instantly pleased, and always pleased, it
will be found, that few books have ever so natu-
rally mingled amusement with instruction. The at-
tention is fixed, either by the simplicity of the nar-
ration, or by the variety of the incidents; the heart
is amended by a vindication of the ways of God to
jiictn; and the understanding is informed, by various
examples,
examples, how much utility ought to be preferred to
ornament: the young are instructed, while the old
are amused.
Robinson Crusoe had scarcely drawn his canoe
ashore, when he was attacked by his old enemies,
the savages. He was assailed first by The Life and
strange Adventures of Mr. D De F—, of London,
Hosier, who has lived above Fifty Tears by himself in
the Kingdoms of North and South Britain. In a dull
dialogue between De Foe, Crusoe, and his man Fri-
day, our Author's life is lampooned, and his mis-
fortunes ridiculed. But he who had been struck by
apoplexy, and who was now discountenanced by
power, was no fit object of an Englishman's satire.
Our Author declares, when he was himself a writer
of satiric poetry, " that he never reproached any
man for his private infirmities, for having his house
burnt, his ships cast away, or his samily ruined; nor
had he ever lampooned any one, because he could
not pay his debts, or differed in judgment from
him." Pope has been justly censured for pursuing
a vein of satire extremely dissimilar. And Pope
placed De Foe with Tutchen, in The Dunciad, when
our Author's infirmities were greater and his com-
fort less. He was again assaulted in 1719, by An
Epistle to D De F—, the reputed Author of Ro-
binson Crusoe. "Mr. Foe," says the letter-writer,
"I have perused your pleasant story of Robinson
Crusoe; and if the saults of it had extended no fur-
ther than the frequent solecisms and incorrectness of
style, improbabilities, and sometimes impossibilities,
I had not given you the trouble of this Epistle."
"Yet," said Johnson to Piozzi, " was there ever
any thing written by mere man, that was wished

longer by its readers, except Don Quixote, Robinson
Crusoe, and the Pilgrim's Progress?" This episto-
lary- critic, who renewed his angry attack when the
second volume appeared, has all the dulness, with-
out the acumen, of Dennis, and all his malignity,
without his purpose of reformation. The Life of
Crusoe has passed through innumerable editions, and
has been translated into foreign languages, while the
criticism sunk into oblivion.
De Foe set the critics at defiance while he had
the people on his side. As a commercial legislator he
knew, that it is rapid sale which is the great incen-
tive: and, in August 1719, he published a second
volume of Surprising Adventures, with similar suc-
cess. In hope of prosit and of praise, he produced
in August 1720, Serious Reflections during the Life
of Robinson Crusoe, with bis Vision of the Angelic World.
He acknowledges,' that the present work is not
merely the product of the two first volumes, but the
two first may rather be called the product of this:
the sable is always made for the moral, not the moral
for the sable. He however did not advert, that in-
struction must be insinuated rather than enforced.
That this third volume has more morality than sable,
is the cause, I fear, that it has never been read with
the same avidity as the former two, or spoken of with
the same approbation. We all prefer amusement to
instruction; and he who would inculcate useful
truths, must study to amuse, or he will offer his
lessons to an auditory, neither numerous, nor atten-
tive.
The tongue of detraction is seldom at rest. It has
often been repeated, that De Foe had surreptitiously
appropriated the papers of Alexander Selkirk, sc
Scotch
4^5
Scotch mariner, who having lived solitarily on the
ifle of Juan Fernandez, four years and four months,
was relieved on the 2d of February, 1708-9, by Cap-
tain Woodes Rogers, in his cruizing voyage round the
world. But let no one draw inferences till the sact;
be first ascertained. The adventures of Selkirk had
been thrown into the air, in 1712, for literary
hawks to devour *; and De Foe may have catched a
* The whole story of Selkirk is told in Woodes Rogers's voyage,
which he published in 1712, from p. 12510131, inclusive : whence
it appears, that Selkirk had preserved no pen, ink, or paper, and
had lost his language; so that he had no journal or papers, which he
could communicate, or by others could be stolen. There is an
account of Selkirk in The Englishman, No. 26. The particular
manner how Alexander Selkirk lived four years and four months,
in the ifle of Juan Fernandez, is related in Captain Cook's
voyage into the South Sea, which was published in 1712. And
Selkirk's tale was told in the Memoirs of Literature, 5. voL
p. vi 8: so that the world was fully possessed of Selkirk's story in
1712, seven years prior to the publication of Crusoe's adventures.
Nor were his adventures singular; for, Ringrose mentions, in his
account of Captain Sharp's voyage, a person who had escaped
singly from a ship that had been wrecked on Juan Fernandez, and
who lived alone five years before he was relieved: And Dam-
pier mentions a Mosquito Indian, who having been accidentally
left on this island, subsisted three years solitarily, till that voyager
carried him oss. From which of these De Foe borrowed his great
incident, it is not easy to discover. In the preface to The Se-
rious ReJIedions, he indeed saye, " That there is a man alive and
well known, the actions of whose lise are the just subject of these
volumes, and to whom the most part of the story directly alludes."
This turns the scale in favour of Selkirk. Nor, was the name of
Crusoe wholly fictitious; for, among De Foe's contemporaries,
JohnDunton fpeaksof Timothy Crusoe, who was called the Golden
Preacher, and was so great a textuary, that he could pray two
hours together in scripture language; but, he was not arrived at

common
common prey, which he converted to the uses of his
intellect, and distributed for the purposes of his in-
terest. Thus he may have sairly acquired the fun-
damental incident of Crusoe's life; but, he did not
borrow the various events, the useful moralities,
or the engaging style. Few men could write such a
poem; and few Selkirks could imitate so pathetic an
original. It was the happiness of De Foe, that as
many writers have succeeded in relating enterprises
by land, he excelled in narrating adventures by sea,
with such felicities of language, such attractive vari-
eties, such infinuative instruction, as have seldom
been equalled, but never surpassed.
While De Foe in this manner busied himself in
writing adventures, which have charmed every
reader, a rhyming fit returned on him. He pub-
lished in 1720, The complete Art of Painting, which
he did into Englis}j from the French of Du Fresnoy.
Dryden had given, in 1695, a translation of DuFres-
noy's poem, which has been esteemed for its know-
ledge of the sister arts. What could tempt De Foe
to this undertaking it is not easy to discover, unless
we may suppose, that he hoped to gain a few guineas,
without much labour of the head or hand. Dryden
has been justly praised for relinquishing vicious ha-
bits of composition, and adopting better models
for his muse. De Foe, after he had seen the cor-
rectness, and heard the music of Pope, remained
unambitious of accurate rhymes, and regardless of
sweeter numbers. His politics and his poetry, for
which he was long samous among biographers,
would not have preserved his name beyond the fleet-
'ing day; yet I suspect that, in imitation of Milton, he
would have preferred his Jure Divino to his Robin-
son Crusoe.
De
De Foe lived not then, however, in pecuniary
distress; for his genius and his industry were to him
the mines of Potosi: and in 1722, he obtained from
the Corporation of Colchester, though my inquiries
have not discovered by what interposition, a ninety-
nine years lease of Kingswood-heath, at a yearly rent
of a hundred and twenty pounds, with a fine of
five hundred pounds *. This transaction seems to
evince a degree of wealth much above want, though
the assignment of his lease not long aster to Walter
Bernard equally proves, that he could not easily hold
what he had thus obtained. Kingswood-heath is now
worth three hundred pounds a year, and is advertised
for sale by Bennet, the present possessor-
Whatever may have been his opulence, our Au-
thor did not waste his subsequent life in unprofitable
idleness. No one can be idly employed who endea-
vours to make his fellow subjects better citizens and
wiser men. This will sufficiently appear if we con-
sider his future labours, under the distinct heads of
voyages; fictitious biography; moralities, either
grave or ludicrous; domestic travels; and tracts on
trade.
The success of Crusoe induced De Foe to publish,
in 1720, The Life and Piracies of Captain Singleton,
though not with similar success: The plan is narrower,
and the performance is less amusive. In 1725, he
gave A New Voyage round the World, by a Course
never failed before. Most voyagers have had this
misfortune, that whatever success they had in the ad-
venture, they had very little in the narration: they are
indeed full of the incidents of sailing, but they have
Jvlorant's Colchester, p. 134.
nothing
%
nothing of story for the use of readers who never in-
tend to brave the dangers of the sea. These faults
De Foe is studious to avoid in his new voyage. He
spreads before his readers such adventures as no
writer of a real voyage can hope to imitate, if we ex-
cept the teller of Anson's tale. In the life of Crusoe
we are gratified by continually imagining that the
fiction is a sact: in the voyage round the world we
are pleased by constantly perceiving that the fact
is a fiction, which, by uncommon skill, is made
more interesting than a genuine voyage.
Of fictitious biography it is equally true, that by
matchless art it may be made more instructive
than a real life. Few of our writers have excelled
De Foe in this kind of biographical narration, the
great qualities of which are, to attract by the diver-
sity of circumstances, and to instruct by the useful-
ness of examples.
He published, in 1720, the History of Duncan
Campbell. Of a person who was born deaf and
dumb, but who himself taught the deaf and dumb
to understand, it is easy to see that the life would be
extraordinary. It will be found, that the Author
has intermixed some disquisitions of learning, and
has contrived that the merriest passages shall end
with some edifying moral. The fortunes and mis-
fortunes of Moll Flanders were made to gratify the
world in 1721. De Foe was aware, that in relating
a vicious life, it was necessary to make the best use
of a bad story; and he artfully endeavours, that
the reader shall be more pleased with the moral than
the sable; with the application than the relation;
with the end of the writer than the adventures of
the person. There was published in 1721, a work
2 of
of a similar tendency, the Life of Colonel Jack, who
was born a gentleman but was bred a pickpocket.—
Our Author is studious to convert his various adven-
tures into a delightful field, where the reader might
gather herbs, wholesome and medicinal, without
the incommodation of plants, poisonous, or noxious.
In 1724, appeared the Life of Roxana. Scenes of
crimes can scarcely be represented in such a manner,
says De Foe, but some make a criminal use of them;
but when vice is painted in its low-prized colours, it
is not to make people love what from the frightful-
ness of the figures they ought necessarily to hate.
Yet, I am not convinced, that the world has been
made much wiser, or better, by the perusal of these
lives: they may have diverted the lower orders, but
I doubt if they have much improved them; if how-
ever they have not made them better, they have not
left them worse. But they do not exhibit many
scenes which are welcome to cultivated minds. Of a
very different quality are the Memoirs of a Cu-
valicr, during the Civil Wars in England, which
seem to have been published without a date. This
is a romance the likest to truth that ever was writ-
ten. It is a narrative of great events, which is
drawn with such simplicity, and enlivened with such
reflections, as to inform the ignorant and entertain
the wife.
The moralities of De Foe, whether published in
single volumes, or interspersed through many pas-
sages, must at last give him a superiority over the
crowd of his contemporaries. The approbation
which has been long given to his Family Instructor and
his Religious Courtship, seem to contain the savour-
able decision of his countrymen. But there are still
other
THE LIFE OF DE FOE.
other performances of this nature, which arc now
to be mentioned, of not inferior merit.
De Foe published, in 1722, A Journal os the
Plague in 1665. The Author's artifice consists in
fixing the reader's attention by the deep distress of
fellow-men; and, by recalling the reader's recollec-
tion to striking examples of mortality, he endeavours
to inculcate the uncertainty of life, and the useful-
ness of reformation. In 1724, De Foe published
The great Law of Subordination. This is an admi-
rable commentary on the Unsufferablc Behaviour of
Servants. Yet, though he interest by his mode, in-
form by his sacts, and convince by his argument,
he sails at last, by expecting from law what must
proceed from manners. Our Author gave the
Political Hi/lory of the Devil, in 1726. The matter
and the mode conjoin to make this a charming per-
formance. He engages poetry and prose, reasoning
and wit, persuasion and ridicule, on the side of reli-
gion and morals, with wonderful esficacy. De Foe
wrote a system of magic in 1726. This may be pro-
perly regarded as a supplement to the History of the
Devil. His end and his execution are exactly the
same. He could fee no great harm in the present
pretenders to magic, if the poor people would but
keep their money in their pockets; and that they
should have their pockets picked by such an unper-
forming, unmeaning, ignorant crew as these are,
is the only magic De Foe could fee in the whole
science. But the reader will discover in our Au-
thor's system extensive erudition, salutary remark,
and useful satire. De Foe published in 1727, his
31realise on the Use and Abuse of the Marriage-Bed.
The Author had begun this performance thirty years
before:
before: he delayed the publication, though it had
been long finished, in hopes of reformation. But
being now grown old, and out of the reach of scandal,
and despairing of amendment from a vicious age,
he thought proper to close his days with this satire.
He appealed to that Judge, before whom he expect-
ed soon to appear, that as he had done it with an
upright intention, so he had used his utmost endeavour
to perform it in a manner, which was the least liable
to reflection, and the most answerable to the end
of it—the reformation of the guilty. After such an
appeal, and such asseverations, I will only remark,
that this is an excellent book with an improper title-
page.
We are now to consider our Author's Tours.
He published his Travels through England, in
1724 and 1725; and through Scotland, in
1727. De Foe was not one of those travellers
who seldom quit the banks of the Thames.
He had made wide excursions over all those coun-
tries, with observant eyes and a vigorous intellect.
The great artifice of these volumes consists in the fre-
quent mention of such men and things, as are always
welcome to the reader's mind.
De Foe's Commercial Tracts are to be reviewed
lastly. Whether his sancy gradually sailed, as age
hastily advanced, I am unable to tell. He certainly
began, in 1726, to employ his pen more frequently
on the real business of common life. He published,
in 1727, The Complete English Tradesman; directing
him in the several parts of trade. A second volume
soon after followed, which was addressed chiefly to
the more experienced and more opulent traders. In
1 these
these treatises the tradesman found many directions'
of business, and many lessons of prudence. De Foe
was not One of those writers, who consider private
vices as public benefits: God forbid, he exclaims,
that I should be understood to prompt the vices of the
age, in order to promote any practice of traffic:
trade need not be destroyed though vice were mortally
wounded. With this salutary spirit he published, in
1728, A. Plan of the Englis}) Commerce. This seems
to be the conclusion of what he had begun in
1713.. In 1728, Gee printed his Trade and Navi-
gation considered. De Foe insisted, that our industry,
our commerce, our opulence, and our people, had
increased and were increasing. Gee represented that
our manusactures had received mortal stabs; that
our poor were destitute, and our country miserable.
De Foe maintained the truth, which experience has
taught to unwilling auditors. Gee asserted the salse-
hood, without knowing the sact: yet Gee is quoted,
while De Foe, with all his knowledge of the sub-
ject, as a commercial writer, is almost forgotten.
The reason may be found perhaps in the characte-
ristic remark with which he opens his plan: Trade,
like religion, is what every body talks of, but few
understand.
"When curiosity has contemplated such copious-
ness, such variety, and such excellence, it naturally
inquires, which was the last of De Foe's performances?
Were we to determine from the date of the title-
page, the Plan of Commerce must be admitted to be
his last. But if we must judge from his presatory
declaration, in The Abuse of the Marriagc-Bcd,
where he talks of closing his days nith this satire,
which he was so sar from seeing cause of being
ashamed
ashamed of, that he hoped he should not be ashamed
of it .where he was going to account for it, we
must finally decide, that our Author closed his ca-
reer " with this upright intention for the good of man-
kind."
De Foe, after those innumerable labours, which
I have thus endeavoured to recal to the public recol-
lection, died in April, 1731, within the parish of
St. Giles's, Cripplegate, London, at an age, if he
were born in 1663, when it was time to prepare for
his last voyage. He left a widow, Susannah, who
did not long survive him, and six sons and daugh-
ters, whom he boasts of having educated as well as
his circumstances would admit. His son Daniel is
said to have emigrated to Carolina; of Benjamin,
his second son, no account can be given. His
youngest daughter Sophia, married Mr. Henry Ba-
ker, a person more respectable as a philosopher than
a poet, who died in 1774, at the age of seventy.
His daughter Maria married one Langley; but
Hannah and Henrietta probably remained unmar-
ried, since they were heiresses only of a name, which -
did not recommend them. With regard to
Norton, from Daniel and Ostræa sprung *,
Bless'd with his sather's front, and mother's tongue,
It is only said, that he was a wretched writer in the
Flying Post, and the author of Alderman Barber's
• Pope had collected this scandal from Savage, who says in his
preface to his Author to be Let, " Had it not been an honester
livelihood for Mr. Norton, (Daniel Dc Foe's son of love by a
lady who vended oysters) to have dealt in a fish-market, than to
be dealing out the dialects of Billingsgate in the Flying Poit I"

THE LIFE OF DE FOE.
Life. De Foe probably died insolvent; for letters of
administration on his goods and chattels were
granted to Mary Brooke, widow, a creditrix, in Sep-
tember 1733, after summoning in official form the next
of kin to appear *. John Dunton f, who personally
knew our Author, describes him, in 1705, as a man
of good parts and clear fense; of a conversation, in-
genious and brisk; of a spirit, enterprising and
bold, but of little prudence; with good nature and
real honesty. Of his petty habits little now can he
told, more than he has thus confessed himself J:
<{ God, I thank thee, I am not a drunkard, or a
swearer, or a whoremaster, or a busy-body, or idle,
or revengeful; and though this be true, and I chal-
lenge all the world to prove the contrary, yet, I
must own, I see small satissaction in all the negatives
of common virtues; for though I have not been
guilty of any of these vices, nor of many more, I
have nothing to infer from thence, but Te Deum lau.
damns." He says himself—
Confession will anticipate reproach,
He that reviles us then, reviles too much;
All satire ceases when the men repent,
'Tis cruelty to lash the penitent.
When De Foe had arrived at sixty-five, while he
was encumbered with a samily, and, I fear, pinched
with penury, Pope endeavoured, by repeated strokes,
to bring his gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.
This he did without propriety, and, as sar as appears,

ing the books at Doctors Commons.—\ Life and Errors, 239-^

without

435
without provocation; for our Author is not in the
black list of scribblers, who by attempting to lessen
the poet's same, incited the satirist's indignation.
The offence and the sate of Bentley and De Foe were
nearly alike. Bently would not allow the translation
to be Homer: De Foe had endeavoured to bring
Milton into vogue seven years ere the Paradise Lost
and Chevy Chase had been criticised in the Spectators
by Addison. Our Author had said in More Refor-
mation,
Let this describe the nation's character,
One man reads Milton, forty .
The case is plain, the temper of the time,
One wrote the lewd, the other the sublime.
An enraged poet alone could have thrust into the
Dunciad, Bentley, a profound scholar, Cibber, a
brilliant wit, and De Foe, a happy genius. This was
the consequence of exalting satire as the test of
truth; while truth ought to have been enthroned the
test of satire. Yet, it ought not to be forgotten, that
De Foe has some sarcasm, in his System of Magic, on
the sylphs and gnomes, which Pope may have deemed
a daring invasion of his Roficrutian territories.
De Foe has not yet outlived his century, though
he have outlived most of his contemporaries. Yet the
time is come, when he must be acknowledged as one
of the ablest, as he is one of the most captivating,
writers, of which this island can boast. Before he
canbe admitted to this pre-eminence, he must be con-
sidered distinctly, as a poet, as a novelist, as a pole-
mick, as a commercial writer, and as a grave historian.
As a poet, we must look to the end of his effusions
rather than to his execution, ere we can allow him
F f 2 considerable
considerable praise. To mollify national animosities,
or to vindicate national rights, is certainly noble ob-
jects, which merit the vigour and imagination of
Milton, or the flow and precision of Pope -r but our
Author's energy runs into harshness, and his sweet-
ness is to be tasted in his prose more than in his
poesy. If we regard the adventures of Crusoe, like
the adventures of Telemachus, as a poem, his moral,
his incidents, and his language, must lift him high
on the poet's scale. His professed poems, whether
we contemplate the propriety of sentiment, or the
suavity of numbers, may indeed, without much
loss of pleasure or instruction, be resigned to those,
who, in imitation of Pope, poach in the fields of
obsolete poetry for brilliant thoughts, felicities of
phrase, or for happy rhymes.
As a novelist, every one will place him in the fore-
most rank, who considers his originality, his per-
formance, and his purpose. The Ship of Fools had
indeed been launched in early times; but, who like
De Foe, had ever carried his reader to sea, in order
to mend the heart, and regulate the practice of life,
by mewing his readers the effects of adversity, or how
they might equally be called to sustain his hero's
trials, as they sailed round the world. But, without
attractions, neither the originality, nor the end, can
have any salutary consequence. This he had fore-
seen; and for this he has provided, by giving his ad-
ventures in a style so pleasing, because it is simple, and
so interesting, because it is particular, that every one
sancies he could write asimilar language. It was, then,
idle in Boyer formerly, or in Smollet lately, to speak
of De Foe as a party writer, in little estimation. The
writings of no Author since have run through more
numerous
437
numerous editions. And he whose works have plea-
sed generally and pleased long, must be deemed a
writer of no small estimation; the people's verdict
being the proper test of what they are the proper
judges.
As a polemick, I fear we must regard our Author
with lese kindness, though it must be recollected,
that he lived during a contentious period, when two
parties distracted the nation, and writers indulged
in great asperities. But, in opposition to reproach,
let it ever be remembered, that he defended freedom,
without anarchy j that he supported toleration,
without libertinism; that he pleaded for moderation
even amidst violence. With acuteness of intellect,
with keenness of wit, with archness of diction, and
pertinacity of design; it must be allowed that nature
had qualified, in a high degree, De Foe for a dispu-
tant- His polemical treatises, whatevermight havebeen
their attractions once, may now be delivered with-
out reserve to those who delight in polemical reading.
De Foe, it must be allowed, was a party-writer: But,
were not Swift and Prior, Steel and Addison, ,
Halisax and Bolingbroke, party-writers? De Foe,
being a party-writer upon settled principles, did
not change with the change of parties: Addison
and Steel, Prior and Swift, connected as they were
with persons, changed their note as persons were
elevated or depressed.
As a commercial writer, De Foe is sairly intitled
to stand in the foremost rank among his contem-
poraries, whatever may be their performances or
their same. Little would be his praise, to say of
him, that he wrote on commercial legislation like
F f 3 Addison,
Addison, who when he touches on Trade, sinks
into imbecility, without knowledge of sact, oiNrjower
of argument *. The distinguishing characteristics
of De Foe, as a commercial difquisitor, are origina-
lity and depth. He has many sentiments with re-
gard to traffic, which are scattered through his
Reviews, and which I never read in any other book.
His Giving Jims no Charity is a capital performance,
with the exception of one or two thoughts about
the abridgment of labour by machinery, which are
either half formed or half expressed. Were we to
compare De Foe with D'Avenant, it would be found,
that D'Avenant has more detail from official docu-
ments; that De Foe has more sact from wider
inquiry. D'Avenant is more apt to consider laws
in their particular application; De Foe more fre-
quently investigates commercial legislation in its
general effects. From the publications of D'Avenant
it is sufficiently clear, that he was not very regard-
ful of means or very attentive to consequences;
De Foe is more correct in his motives, and more
salutary in his ends. But, as a commercial prophet,
De Foe must yield the palm to Child; who fore-
seeing from experience that men's conduct must
finally be directed by their principles, foretold the
colonial revolt: De Foe, allowing his prejudices to
obscure his sagacity, reprobated that suggestion,
because he deemed interest a more strenuous prompter
than enthusiasm. Were we however to form an
opinion, not from special passages, but from whole

3 performances,

performances, we must incline to De Foe, 'when
compared with the ablest contemporary: we must
allow him the preference, on recollection, that when he
writes on commerce he seldom sails to insinuate some
axiom of morals, or to inculcate some precept of
religion.
As an historian, it will be found, that our Author
had few equals in the English language, when he
wrote. His Memoirs of a Cavalier shew how well
he could execute the lighter narratives. His History
of the Union evinces that he was equal to the higher
department of historic composition. This is an ac-
count of a single event, difficult indeed in its exe-
cution, but beneficial certainly in its consequences.
With extraordinary Ikill and information, our Author
relates, not only the event, but the transactions which
preceded, and the effects which followed. He is at
once learned and intelligent. Considering the sac-
tiousness of the age, his candour is admirable. His
moderation is exemplary. And if he spoke of James I.
as a tyrant, he only exercised the prerogative, which
our historians formerly enjoyed, of casting obloquy on
an unfortunate race, in order to supply deficience of
knowledge, of elegance, and of stile. In this in-
stance De Foe allowed his prejudice to overpower his
philosophy. If the language of his narrative want
the dignity of the great historians of the current
times, it has greater sacility; if it be not always
grammatical, it is generally precise; and if it be
thought defective in strength, it must be allowed to
excel in sweetness.
Such then are the pretensions of De Foe to be ac-
knowledged as one of the ablest and most useful
F f 4 writers
writers of our island. He who still doubts may
perhaps satisfy his greatest doubts, by perusing
the chronological catalogue of our Author's works,
which I have compiled, in order to gratify the public
curiosity; and which, for the greater distinctness, I
have divided into two heads: ist, Those writings
that I think are certainly De Foe's: 2dly, those writ-
ings that are said to be his. As I do not pretend to
perfect accuracy, it would be a savour to the world
and to me, if any one, of more knowledge and leisure
than I possess, would point out mistakes for the
purpose of amendment. The zealous interposition of
Mr. Lockyer Davis, and the liberal spirit of the Sta-
tioners Company, procured me the perusal of the
Register of books, which have been entered at Sta-
tioners-Hall. I was surprised and disappointed to
find so few of De Foe's writings entered as property,
and his name never mentioned as an author or a
man.

a second time printed, it was entitled simply The Hijiory of

standing a large Impression of the first, is a Certificate from
the Wor!d of its general Acceptation. The wife World has
been pleased with it, the merry World has been diverted
with it, and the ignor.mt World has been taught by it;
and none but the malicious part of the World has been of-
fended at it: Who can wonder, that when the Devil is

C3* The Union between England and Scotland,
being an extremely interesting Event, has led the
Publisher to imagine, that a new Edition of this
Work of De Foe, which is grown very scarce,
would be acceptable to the Public, especially at
the present Time, when the Situation of Affairs
in Ireland induces many Persons to wifli that a
similar Unicn between Great Britain and that
Kingdom may take Place; as it may cause such
an .Union, . if not to be effected, at least to be pro-
posed, and to become, for a Time, the Subject
of Debate in both Countries.
