PREFACE.
This primary work is designed for small children,
and as an easy introduction to the "Progressive Intel-
lectual Arithmetic," for advanced classes.
Its object is to lead the young pupil, by brief and
simple processes, applied to practical examples of easy
gradation, to acquire habits of thought and of reasoning,
in their simplest forms, and to draw out and strengthen
the mind by a progressive and almost imperceptible gra-
dation of thought and expression.
The operations of Adding and Subtracting, of Multi-
plying and Dividing, are first shown by pictorial objects;
portions of the elementary tables are introduced at the
commencement of each lesson, and applied to short ex-
amples concerning familiar objects; promiscuous reviews
of the elementary tables, and the more simple and easy
Denominate tables have been introduced. Fractions
have been treated as far as was thought practicable
in a work of this kind.
It is confidently believed that tho progressive and
systematic arrangement, the simplicity and adaptation
to the juvenile mind, the typography and general attrac-
tiveness of this little book, will insure for it abundant
success.
THE AUTHOR.
SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS.
1. A teacher should have a particular time allotted
to every exercise, and regular lessons should be assigned,
to be recited each day at a specified hour.
2. Sufficient time being given the pupils to learn
their lessons, they should not be allowed the use of the
book at the time of recitation.
3. The teacher should first ascertain that the table is
thoroughly learned by every pupil in the class.
4. Each question should be slowly and distinctly read,
and the pupils be called upon promiscuously; the pupil
called upon should stand erect, repeat the question, and
then give the solution. This will require close attention.
5. A correct and uniform analysis of each question
should be required from every pupil.
6. The class should be encouraged to detect and cor-
rect errors in the statement and solution of questions, to
be signified by raising the hand.
7. The teacher can extend the questions in each les-
son at pleasure, either by repeating those given, or
making additional ones.

LESSON III.
Remark. — This lesson presents the printed and
written figures, and the Roman letters, by which num-
bers are commonly expressed. It should be carefully
studied by children, until they can read the figures with
facility when written on the black-board, or when they
meet with them in books.

picked 3 plums from one tree, and 5 from another, he
picked 8 plums from both.
2. A grocer sold 3 pounds of sugar to one

Henry had 4 cenis in one hand, and 3 cents in the other,
ke had 7 cents in both.

1. Henry paid 6 cents for an inkstand, 4
cents for some pens, and 5 cents for a. writing
book; how much did he pay for all 1

cents.

1. How many tons of hay, at 6 dollars a
ton, will pay for 8 yards of broadcloth, at 3
dollars a yard?
Analysis. — As many tons of hay at 6 dollars a ton,
at 6 dollars, the price of a ton, is contained times in
8 times 3 dollars, or 24 dollars, the cost of the broad-
cloth, which are 4 times. Therefore 4 tons of hay, at

will cost as maiig cents as 7 is contained times in 28,
which is 4 times; 3 oranges, which are 3 times 1 orange,
will cost 3 times 4 cents, or 12 cents. Therefore, if 7
