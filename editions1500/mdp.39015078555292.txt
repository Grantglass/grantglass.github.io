ROBINSON CRUSOE.

T was born of a respectable family in the
city of York, where ray father, who was a native
of Bremen, settled, after having gained a hand-
some estate by merchandise. My heart was
very early filled with rambling thoughts, and on
the 1st of September, 1651, I went on board a
ship for Africa, and set sail without letting my
father and mother know the route I had taken.
But no sooner was the ship out of the Humber,
than the wind began to blow and the sea to rise
in a most terrible manner. I was extremely
sick, and I firmly resolved, if it pleased God to
set me on dry land, that I would return to my
parents, implore their forgiveness, and bid a
final adieu to my wandering inclinations. This
was one of the most unhappy voyages evei
made; for we were surprised one morning by a
rover of Sallee, which gave chase to us. A very

smart engagement ensued, but we were obliged
to submit, and were all carried prisoners into
Sallee, a port belonging to the Moors.
My master having the long-boat of our Eng-
lish ship, had a little cabin built in the middle
of it like a barge; and as I was dexterous at
fishing, he frequently sent me out with a Moor
whom he called Muley. One day we sailed out
of the port to fish, when, giving the boy the
helm, I stepped forward, and stooping behind
the Moor, took him by surprise, and tossed him
overboard. He rose immediately, and called
to me to take him in; but fetching one of the
fowling-pieces, I presented it at him, and told
him that I would shoot him if he came near,
for I was resolved to have my liberty. * So he
turned about, and,.* as the sea was calm, he
no doubt reached the shore in safety.





I turned to the boy, whom they called Xury,
and said to him," Xury, if you will be faithful
to me, I will make you a great man; but, if you
will not, I must throw you into the sea too."
The boy smiled, and spoke so innocently, that I
could not mistrust him. It no sooner got dark,
than I steered to the south, and made such sail,
that by the end of the next day, we got beyond
the emperor of Morocco's dominions. The next
morning we saw two wild beasts come running
with great swiftness from the mountains. The
people, who were black and quite naked, were
terribly afraid, and fled. The beasts, without
attempting to fall upon the negroes, plunged into
the se§. One of them came nearer to our boat
than we expected. 1 fired and shot him through
the head, when he made towards the shore, but.
died before he could reach it. It 13 impossible

to describe the astonishment of the negroes at the
firing of the gun. But when they saw the ani-
mal dead, they dragged it to land, and found
that it was a fine leopard, most beautifully spot-
ted. We made signs to the negroes for the skin,
and allowed them to eat the flesh. About ten
days afterwards, we discovered a Portuguese
Tessel, and on our coming near I offered all that
I possessed to the captain of the ship, but he
told me that he would take nothing from me.
We had very good weather for twelve days;
but after we had crossed the Line, a violent
hurricane drove us quite out of our course. In
this distress one of our men called out, "Land!"
and the ship struck against a sand-bank. We
took to the boat, and after we had rowed a
league and a half, a wave came rolling a-stern
of us, and overset the boat at once, so that oat

of sixteen, none escaped but myself. I got
upon my feet, and making towards the shore I
clambered up the cliffs, and got to land. Being
much fatigued, I climbed up a tree, and slept
comfortably till the morning. When I awoke,
it was broad day, and the storm had abated.
I swimmed to the ship, and to my great joy
saw that all the provisions were dry; and being
well disposed to eat, I filled my pockets, and ate
as I went about other things. I found several
spare yards and planks with which I madea raft.
I emptied three of the seam ens' chests, and also let
down the carpenter's chest, all of which I pla-
ced on my raft, and after much labour got it safe-
ly landed. I then went in search of a place where
to fix my dwelling, and before I set up my tent/
I drew a half circle before a hollow place, which,
extended about twenty yards, and drove laxgf

piles into the ground sharpened at the end; and
the entrance I made by a short ladder to go over
the top, and when I was in I lifted it over after
me, so that I was quite secure. — One morning
I was exceedingly terrified with the print of a
man's naked foot on the sand. I hurried home
to my cave, fancying every tree and bush to be
a savage; and I had no sleep that night. Soon
after this, while I was cutting fire-wood to bate
some earthenware pots I had contrived to make,
I beheld at the end of a dark cavity behind a
think branch of underwood, two rolling shining
eyes. The sight struck me with a cold sweat;
but trusting in Providence, I proceeded forward
with a flaming fire-brand, and perceived it to be
a monstrous he-goat dying with old age.
Fears of the savages again disturbed my
peace, and whilst I was looking out one morning

very early I saw five canoes on shore, and no
fewer than thirty savages dancing round a fire.
I soon after saw two miserable wretches dragged
out of the canoes, one of them was immediately
knocked down, but the other starting from them,
ran with incredible swiftness along the sands
towards me. Of the three that followed but
two entered the water, the other returning back.
I hastily fetched my guns from the foot of the
ladder, and taking a short cut down the hill, I
clapped myself in the way between the pursued
and the pursuers; then rushing at once on the
foremost, knocked him down with the stock of
my piece; the other was fitting his bow to shoot
me, upon which I shot him dead directly. The
poor savage who had fled was so terrified at the
noise of my piece, though he saw his enemies
fallen, that'he stood stock still, but seemed rather
inclined to fly than come forward. However,
when I gave him signs of encouragement, he
| %ame near, and I took him away, to my cave at
Jrhe farther part of the island. Here I gave him
bread, a bunch of raisins to eat, and a draught of
jwater, which he wanted much ; and having re*
freshed him I began to speak to him, and to teach
him to speak to me; and first made him know
that his name should be Friday, which was the
day whereon I saved his life. I taught him to
say Master, and let him know that was to be
my name. The next day I gave him clothes, at
which he seemed pleased.
I was now entered into the 27th year of my
captivity, when, one morning, Friday came run-
ning, and before I had time to speak, cried,
"O Massa! Massa! O sorrow! yonder there
be one, two, three canoe!"
Having hung my great sword naked by my
side, and made Friday assist in loading what
fire-arms we had, which consisted of four guns
and two pistols, I took my glass, and went up to
the side of the hill, when I saw twenty-one sa-
vages, three prisoners., and three canoes. I saw a
white man bound upon the sand, whom Friday
said they intended to murder next. Having
thus learnt their force I entered the wood, with
Friday beside me, till we came near them. They
were about the fire, eating the flesh of one of
their prisoners. This filled me with horror; and
going behind a tree we both fired, and killed
four and wounded three at the first volley, while
the Indians were panic-struck at receiving so
unexpected a salute. Improving on their fright,

we poured in a second volley with such effect,
that we killed two more, and wounded several,
while the air re-echoed with the yells of these
affrighted savages, who fled in great terror.
The white man proved to be a Spaniard,
and whilst Friday untied the flags which bound
his legs, he thanked me for his deliverance.
We pursued them to the beach, and did such
execution among them, that out of twenty-one
only four escaped; even those I should have de-
stroyed, but on jumping into one of their canoes,
which I made Friday also do, in order to pursue
them, our attention was arrested by discovering
a man lying bound in the canoe. He was an
Indian, and I ordered Friday to speak to him;
but when the poor fellow looked him in the face,
and heard him speak, he uttered a wild and dis-
cordant scream; he embraced him, then cried,
and put his head into his bosom, then danced,
sung, and cried again. It was some time before
I could learn the cause of his emotion; but at
length becoming more calm, he informed m#
that it was his own dear father! Some days ai-
ter Friday came running into the hut, almost

breathless, exclaiming, " O Massa! Massa ! a
ship! a ship!" Overjoyed at this news, I took
up my glass, and ascended the hill, when to
my no small surprise, I beheld an English ship
lying at anchor some distance from the shore.
The joy that I felt on this occasion can be
more easiiy felt than described. Soon after, they
sent one of their boats on shore, and eleven men
landed, three of whom seemed to be prisoners.
Resolving to preserve the ill-fated captives, I
and my man concealed ourselves among some
bushes, so that we could secretly observe all that
passed. At length the sailors left their captives,
and strolled into an adjacent wood. Embold-
ened by their absence, I ventured to the cap-
tives, and asked who they were. One of them
informed me that he was captain of the ship we
saw lying at anchor; that his men b&d mutined,
11

and condemned him and his two companions to
death, or if their lives were spared, they were
to be left on this desolate island. I told them
not to fear, and I would undertake their deliver-
ance. We followed the mutineers into the
wood, and forced them to surrender. At mid
night we towed to the ship, and, having got
quietly on board, we killed the rebel captain
and the mate, and the rest surrendered.
Next day I went on board, taking with me
my man Friday, my dog, and my parrot. Thus
I left this solitary island, after living upon it for
twenty-eight years. We had not left the island
three days, when we saw a great number of
canoes filled with negroes, who came very near
us, on which we made signs for them to put
back, which they did. I ordered Friday to
speak to them, when instantly they discharged

a great flight of airows, and killed poor Friday,
no other man being in their sight. I gave them
a broadside, which overset many of their canoes,
and the rest fled quickly out of sight.
After a prosperous voyage, we landed in Old
England, after I had been absent from my
native country thirty-seven years. On my arri-
val at York, I was very much grieved to hear
that both my parents were dead; but I was
somewhat consoled when I fouud that they had
forgiven me, and left me all their property, if
ever I should return to enjoy it. Having for so
many years had a life of hardship and misfor-
tune, I learnt to know the blessing of ending
my days in peace, and the necessity of being
prepared to depart from this to another and a
better world.
