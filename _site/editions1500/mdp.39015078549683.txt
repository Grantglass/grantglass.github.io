•J PREFACE.
IN this new abridgement of the .wonderful life and
most surprising adventures ofRobin/on Crusoe, I think
mtjelf, obliged to acquaint the reader, "That all possible-
tare has been taken to frejer oe the history entire, to car-
reel jome mistakes in former imprefstons, and to add a con-
siderable number offaBs and material observations that'
have ef lait occured, and were never subsisted b tt in
this edition.
The general success and the just applause the work
<tt large etas met with, render it needles for me to fay
tiny thing in its commendation; no£ do 1 think the 'weak ex-
ceptions that have been made against the possibility of
'hestory, deserve any observation. What if the .whole-
was (as is suggested) a meer fiction? Tet the design it
Co justly carried on, and jo interspersed vjith curious ob-
servations and moral refieclions, that all persons ,whobave
any taste for the metaphorical way of writing, must

w« favour than any body can pretend to do, I stall

T ^ my father, who having heard of the ship's mis

f i~' I was lost. But my ill sate still pushed me on 5i
spight of all the strong convictions of reason
^ conscience, and experience.
* . $ After three days stay at Yarmouth, I met tbi
young man that invited me to go on board wirt
his father, i. found his sace and his bsbaviow
very much altered; and I found likewise he hac
told his sather who I was, and that I had taker
this voyage only for a trial,, in order to proceed
farther abroad hereafter.
When the old mao saw me, says he, " Youn§
man, you ought never to attempt to go to sea
vj any more; for, depend upon it, you never w:li
,^ be prosperous, in a seasaring condition. You !e<
what ill success Heaven has set before your eye?.)
and perhaps our misfortune miy in some mea-
sure be owing to you. Pray (added he) tell me
truly upon what motive you first undertook thu
voyage." Upun this I told hiai the whole; al
vf- the end of which he broke out into the following

perate, abandoned wretch into my ship, that has
brought all these miseries and misfortunes upon
me!" After his p,Æ :-n was a little abated, he
proceeds—" Young man, depend upon it, if you
do not return, and submit to your parents,
wherever you go, the anger of God will certain- 4
ly pursue you, and you will meet with nothing!
but ruin and disaster, until your sather's word#
are fulfilled upon you." And so he left me.
And now again I had some notion of return-
ing home: but that was qukkfy overruled by a
foolish opinion, that if I did, my neighbours and
acquaintance would laugh at ***, So strange I*
the nature of youths that though they often do
foolish things without either shame or remorse,
yet at the same time they are ashamed to own \
their folly, and repent.
In short, I made the best of my way to Lon-
don, being at all hazards resolved upon a voyage;
and being acquainted with the captain of* a
Liip, a voyage I soon heard of to the coast of
Guinea. Having some money, and appearing
like a gentleman, I did not-go on board like a
common sailor, but soon got so sar into the cap-
tain's savour, that he told me I should be bit
messmate, and should have full liberty to carry
with me what merchandise I should think fit, and
JtJ&Sseofe of it to my own advantage.
: t was wonderfully pleased with this kind offer,
and concluded that now I had an oppoi tunny of
making my fortune ; and in order to my voyage
I sent to my friends for some money to fit me
out; who accordingly remitted me forty pounds,
which I laid out in goods according to his direc-
tions. He taught me to keep journal, and sev-
eral of the most uieful parts W navigation,-*
CRUSOE.
And indeed, by hit assistance and my own in-
dustry, in this voyage I became both a sailor
and a merchant. Fart of this voyage I was ex-
cessively sick of a) calenture, occasioned by the
heat of the climate, being in the latitude of al-
most 15 degrees north of the line. However, I
recovered, and managed my little stork so. well,
that I brought over with me five pounds and
nine ounces of gold dust, which produced at
London near three hundred pounds sterling.
Soon after my return, my good friend the
captain died. Although this was a very great
grief to me, jet I resolved to go another voyage
with his mate, who had got the command of the
Slip. This voyage proved a very unsuccessful
one. I carried with me about one hundred
pounds, and left the rest with the captain's wi-
dow, and lo to sea we went. But as we were
sailing towards the Canary islands, we found w*
were chafed by a Salee rover, who in spit? of alt
the sail we could make, in a short time cane up
with us; and now there was no remedy but to
fight or be taken.
They had 18 guns, and our ship but 12 i
however, about three in the afternoon, we camt.
to an engagement. Many were killed on both
sides ; but at length being overpowered by their
numbers, we were foiced to submit, and all car-
ried into Salee. Our men were sent to the Em-
perour's court to be fold ; but the captain of the
pirate, taking a particular Ukii,g to me, kept me
for h:s owa slave.
It wr.s in this miserable condition that my fa-
ther's words came afresh into my remembrance,
*ti mj thoughts were continually at work to
make my escape. My patron entrusted me witk
0 B INi\ 0 N
the management of his garden and houses anti
indeed J was not without hopes but at seme time"
or other an opportunity might cifer. The worst
of it was, I had no mortal to communicate my/<
thoughts to; and so for two yean, I could find
nothing practicable.
In length of time, I found my patron was
grown so poor, that he could not fit out his ship
w usual; and then be used constantly once or
twice a week to go out a fishing, taking me and
• Morisco boy to row the boat; and lo much
pleased was he with my dexterity in fishing, that
he would often fend me with a Moor, his kins-
man, and the boy, to catch fifli for him.
One morning as we Were at the sport, there
arose so thick a fog that we lost our way, and
rowing all night, when it was light we found
ourselves at left two leagues in the ocean ; how-
ever we made a shift to get on shore. But, to
prevent the like misfortune for the future, my
patron ordered a carpenter to build a little state-
room in the middle of the long boat, with a
place behind to steer, and other conveniences
to keep out the weather. i
In this he would often take us out a fishing;
and one time particularly, he invited three or
four persons of distinction to go along with him,
and made extraordinary preparations for their
entertainment: providing also three fuzett, wirh
a sussicient quantity of powder and shot, that
they might have some sport at fowling, as they
passed along the shore. The next morning the
boat being in readiness, on a sodden their minds
altered. However, my patron ordered us to go
a: d catch a di(h of fish; for that he was icsolv-
I his guests should sop with him*
€ R U S 0 E. 13
And sow it was that I began to think of my
deliverance i and in order to it, I persuaded the
Moor to get some provisions on board, and also
some powder and shot to flioot curlews, which
were very plenty in those parts. I took care to
provide privately whatever else I could think was
the most necessary for the present expedition,
resolving to make my escape, or perish in the
attempt.
When we were past the castle, we fell to fish-
ing, and 1 stood sarther into the sea ; and when
we were got at lest a league, I gave the boy the
helm, and seized Muley by surprize, and threw
him overboard : " Muley {said 1)1 never design-
ed you harm, and seek nothing but my redemp-
tion; I know you are able to swim to shore a
hot if yon offer to follow me, that very moment,
I will flioot you through the head :" tipon which
he instantly turned about, and I make ao doubt
but he got safe to shore.
This action frighted the poor boy exceeding-
ly 5 however, I soon eased him of his fear, by
telling him "if he would be a good boy, and
swear by Mahomet, and the beard of his sather*
to serve me saithfully, I would be very kind to
him." The poor child seemed wonderfully
pleased with my promise, and readily consented;
and from that time I began to love him entirely.
We pursued our voyage, keeping still on the
Barbary coast ; but in the dusk of the evening,
I changed my course, steering directly S. and by
£. that we might always be near the Chore -, and
having a pleasant gale, I found the next day, by
three iu the afternoon, we were 150 miles be-
yond the dominions of the emperour of Moroc-
-14 R 0 B i A' S V N
co •, yet still I was under dreadful apprehensions
of being retaken.
I continued sailing for five days together, un-
til I concluded that if any vessel was in pursuit
of me, I was got (o far to the southward that
they would not thick proper to follow me any
farther.
After all this satigue, I anchored in the mouth
of a little liver; but where I knew not, neither
.could I fee any people to make the discovery.
What I chiefly wanted was fresh water, which!
resolved to go on sliore to find out as soon as it
grew duikifh : but no sooner did it begin to grow
dark", but we heard such howlings and yellings
of wild beasts and monsters, that I must needs
own I was exceedingly terrified.
Poor Xury passionately begged me not to go
- on shore that night. The boy had a great deal
of wit ; for which, and some broken English
which he had learnt among the captives of cur
nation, I was mightily pleased with him. Ne-
vertheless, the bowlings and bellowing* were so
dreadful, that we had but little rest that night;
and to add to our confusion, we discovered one
of the monsters making towards us; upon which
I took up one of my guns and shot at him;
whether I hit him or nor, I cannot say—but he
made towards the shore, and the noise of my
gun increased the stupendous noise of other
monsters.
The next morning I resolved to go on shore,
and at all hazards get some fresh water. The
poor boy would have take n one of the jars and
fetched some •, but I refused, telling him we
'would both go together, and take the fame sate;
and accordingly we took our arms, and two jars
c water, and away we went.
I did not go out of the fight of the boat for
fear the savages should come down the river in
their canoes, and take it away; but the boy see-
ing x vale a little farther, ventured to it, and re-
turning with precipitation, I thought that he
was either pu, sued by the savage* or lome wild
beast; upon which I ran towards him, resplving
to perish, or preserve him ; but as be came near~
er to me, I saw a creature hanging at his back,
like one of our hares, but something larger,
which proved to be good and wholesome meaty
and what added most to our joy, the boy assured
me that there was plenty of fresh water in the
very creek where the boat lay.
In this place 1 began to consider that the Ca-
nary islands and Cape dcVerd could not be sar
off; but having no instrument, I knew not in
what latitude we were, or whensto stand off to
sea for them. My hopes were to meet some of
the English trading vessels, that would conse-
quently take us in, and relieve us.
The place I was in was doubttess that wild un-
inhabited country that lies between the emper-
our of Morocco's dominions and the negroes i
it abounds with wild beasts of all forts, aad the
Moors use it for hunting. From this I tho't I
saw mount Tenenffe in the Canaries, and tried
twice to steer my course that way, but was as
often driven back, and compelled to seek my for-
tune along the shore.
One morning very early we came to an anchor
at a small point, and the tide beginning to flaw,
we were preparing to go sarther in; but Xury,
whose youthful and penetrating eyes saw farther
than I, desired me to keep out to sea, or we
should be devoured. "For look yonder, mey
ter (said he) and see dat huge monster sast asleep
on de side-of de hill he pointed to the place,
and I discovered a lion of prodigious size basking
himself under the shade of a hill. "Xury (said
I) you shall go on shore and kill him ;" the boy
looked amazed ; " Me kill him (laid he) he eat
me at one mouth," meaning mouthful. Upon
which I took my biggest gun, and charging it
well, shot at him, and broke one of his legs v
and then with a shot from my other gun, I,kill-
ed him.
But the flesli of this creature not being good
for food, I thought this was spending our am-
munition in vain ; indeed I thought the &in
when it was dry, might be of some use, and so
determined to tiea it off, which took up a whole
day to effect.
From thence we went to the southward, re-
solving to live sparingly on our provisions, and
go on shore as seldom as possible, my design be-
ing to reach Gambia or any other place about
the Cape de Verd, in hopes to meet some Eu-
ropean ship ; and if Providence did not favour
me in this, my next resolution was to seek for
the islands, and venture myself among the Ne-
groes; for without one of these, I could have
bo other prospct but starving.
As we were sailing pretty near the shore, we
could nilcover several people upon it, looking
after us. We could perceive they were blacks,
caked and unarmed, all except one, who had
something in his hand like a stick, which Xury
told me was a lance, with which they could kill
at a great distance. I was inclinable to have
gone on shore, but Xury cried no, no." How*
ever, I drew at war to the shore as 1 could, and
€ H V S 9 t. 'iy
talked to them by signs, till I made them sensi-
ble I wanted something ; they made signs to me
to stop my boat, whilst two ot them ran up into
the country, and in less than half an hour
brought me two pieces of dry flesh, and some
corn, which we kindly accepted ; and to pre-
vent any fears, they laid it down, and went and
stood at a distance till we had fetched it on.
board, and then came close up to us again.
But while we were returning thanks to them*
being all we could afford, two mighty creatures
came from the mountains in pursuit of each oth-
er; they passed the negroes with great swiftness,
and jumped directly into the sea, wantonly swim-
ming about, at if the water had put a stop to
their fury. At last one of them coming nearer
to the boat than I desired, I took due of my
guns and let fly at him and killed him.
I cannot express the consternation of the poor
Negroes, upon hearing the report of the gun;
nor their surprize at feeing the creature (lain by
it. I made signs to them to draw it out of the
water by a rope, which they accordingly did (
and then I perceived it to be a beautiful leopard,
which made me desirous of the skin $ and tbe
Negroes being no less desirous of the flesh, I
freely gave it them. As for the other (which
was likewise a leopard) it made back to the
mountains with prodigious swiftness.
The Negroes having furnished us with the best
provisions that the nature of the country and
circumstances would allow, I took my leave of
them; and in eleven days sail I came in sight of
Cape de Verd, or those islands that go by that
name; but could not by any means reach either
«f them. Upon which I grew extremely deject-
B 2
ed ; when Xury (with a sort of terror) cried
.out, " Mastro, Mastro, a great (hip with a sail!"
1 soon perceived she was a Portuguese, and, as
I conjectured, bound to Guinea for Negroes?
upon which I strove all I could to come up with
them; but all my striving had been in vnin, if
they had not happened to espy* and shortened
their sail to stop for me.
Encouraged by this, I set up my antient, and
jired a gUB, both as signals of distress; upon
which they kindly lay to, till I came up with
them. It happened there was a Scotch sailor on
board, to whom I made my case known; and
then they took me into their ship.
You may well imagine my joy was exceeding-
ly great for this unexpected deliverance ; espe-
cially when I found the captain of the ship was
*ery kind and compaffionate to me ; to whom,
in return for his friendship, I offered all I had,
which he generouSy refused, telling me, his
christian charity taught him better. These
effects you have (says he) will be a means to sup-
port you when you come to the Brazils, and
provide for your passage home to your native
country." And indeed hCacted with strict jus-
tice to me in all respects.
He bought my boat of me, and gave me his
note to pay me eight pieces of eight for it when
we came to the Brazils. He also gave me sixty
for my boy Xury, from whom I parted with
great reluctance; however, the boy being will-
ing, I agreed he (hould be set at liberty after ten
years service.
We arrived at the bay of All Saints, after 22
days sail. The good man would not take any
hiDgforlmy passage. He gave me 20 ducats
tT ft U S 0 E, to
for she leopard's skic, and 40 for the lion's.
Every thing he caused to be delivered \ and what
I would sell he bought. In short, I made 220
pieces of my small cargo; and with this little
stock, I began as it were to cater anew ioto the
world.
He recommended me to an honest planter,
with whom I lived till I had informed myself in
the manner of planting and making sugar; and
observing the great advantages of that Dullness,
I resolved to get the money I had left behind me
in England remitted, and to buy a plantation.
In short, I purchased a plantation adjoining
Co an honest Portugueze, born of Englilh par-
ants, whom upon all occasions I found a very
kind and useful neighbour. Our stocks at first
were both very low ; nevertheless, by our indus-
try and care, ht a short time we mad« considera-
ble improvements, and began to grow rich. And
now it was I repented the loss of my dear boy
Xury; having no mortal to assist me, nor any
body to converse with but my neighbour.
I was in some measure fettled, before the cap-
tain that took me up, left the Brazils. One day
I went to him and told him what stock I had
left in London, and desired his assistance in get-
ting a remittance : to which the good gentle-
man readily consented, but would have me only
fend (or half, least it should miscarry, and if it
did the rest would support me. So taking let-
ters of procuration from me, he assured me he
would serve to the utmost of his power; and in
truth he kept his word, and was extremely kind
to me on all occasions.
And now my vrtalth began to increase apace;
Aad in this state I might have lived very h*p-
if my ambition and roving inclination had not
had too great power over me. I had now lived
lome years in the Brazils; and I not only learnt
the language, but contracted an acquaintance
with several of the most eminent merchants at
St. Salvadore, to whom relating the manner of
my two voyages to Guinea, and the great advan-
tages of trading in those parts, they gave such
earnest attention to what I said, that three came
one morning, and told me that they had a mind
to fit out a sliip to go to Guinea, and if I would
go their supercargo, and manage the trade, I
should have an equal share, without putting in
any stock.
This I took to be so sair a proposal, that upon
condition they would look after my plantation
in my absence, I consented to it; and accord-
ingly, a ship being fitted out, and all things in
readiness, we set sail first of September 1695,
steering northward upon the coast of Africa.
But many days we had not sailed, before we
were overtaken by a violent storm, which lasted
1 2 days successively: when the weather cleared,
we found ourselves 11 degrees in the northern
latitude, upon the coast of Guinea; upon which,
the captain gave reasons for returning, which I
opposed, counselling him rather to stand away
for Barbadoes, where I judged we might arrive
in fifteen days. So altering our course we steer-
ed westward, in order to reach the Leeward
Islands 5 and here it was we were overtaken by
a terrible tempest.
In this great distress, one ot our men cried
out, "land! land!" When, looking out that
very moment, we found our ship was struck
- ion the sand, and expected we should sink, and
that we should be all immediately lost. We
knew not where we were driven, and what was
worse, were certain the ship could not hold out
many moments longer.
Whilst we were looking upon one another,
expecting death every moment, the mate, assist-
ed by the crew, hauled out the long boat, and
it of us committed ourselves to the fury of she
sea, and God's mercy. We soon found that thi$>
last effort was to no purpose; for the tempest
was so violent, and the sen ran. so very high that
it was impossible for the boat to live. When we
had been driven about a league, comes a prodi-
gious wave astern, and overset ut in an instant,
so that we had hardly lime to call upon God to
receive our souls. ,
When men are struggling with the pangs of
death, they are commonly insensible : but the
ease was quite different with me; for while I was
overwhelmed with the water, I had the most
dreadful apprehensions, and the joys of Heaven
and the torments of hell were alternately in my
thoughts., and yet stili I kept striving on, while
all my companions were lost, tiil the wave had
spent itself, and, retiring, had thrown me upon
the shore, half dead with the great quantity of
water I had taken in during my struggling i
however, I got upon my feet as sast as I couid,
least another wave should carry me back : but
notwithstanding I made all the speed I could,
yet another wave came, which dashed me against
a piece of a rock in such a furious manner that
it made me senseless i however (recovering a
little before the return of the next wave, which
would doubtless have carried me off) I held sast
hold of the rock till the succeeding wave abated,
and then I made shift to reach the main land %
where, tired and almost spent, I far down con-
templating the manner of my present preserv-
ation.
After I had returnsd my thanks to almighty
God for this wonderful preservation, I btgan to*
look about me, to consider what place I was in,
and what was next to be done in order to my
future subsistence. I could neither fee house
nor people ; wet and hungry, and nothing to
help me, not so much as a weapon to defend me
against the wild beasts. In short, I had nothing
in the world but a knife, a short tobacco pipe,
and a box half full of tobacco; and what was
worse, night coming on, I was under very great
apprehensions of being devoured by wild beasts
that I heard howling and roaring round about
trie •, so that I had no prospect but to expect an-
other kind of death more terrible than that I
had so la'ely escaped. In this distress, I walked
about a furlong into the country to feck fresh
water, which 1 luckily happened upon ; so, tak-
ing to a tree, I seated myself so that I could not
fall, and there I flept till morning.
It was day light before I left my apartment in
the tree \ when, coming down, and looking
round, I perceived that the tempest was ceased,
and that the ship was driven to the rock where
1 escaped; and looking further, I saw the ship's
boat lying about a mile to the right, where the
waves had cast her up.
I hoped to have got to the boat; but the wat-
er between that and the shore rendered that im-
practicable. So I turned again towards the ship,
io hopes to get something from thence for snj
orcsent subsistence.
€ n u s o s. i3
At all hazards I resolved to get to the ship;
and so, stripping, leaped into the water, and
swimming round her, I had the good fortune to
espy a rope hanging so low down that I could
reach it : by the help of which, with some dissi-
culty, I got into the forecast'*. Here I found
that the ship was bulged, her head lifted up
against a bank, and ter stern almost in the wat-
er; all her quarter, and what was there, were
free and dry ; and I found the provisions in
good order, and wanted nothing but a boat to
carry what I had occasion for.
Nectssi y which is the mother of invention,
put a pioltct into my head. There were on
board several spare yards, a spare topmast or
two, and three large lpars of wood. With these
I fell to work, flinging as many of them over-
board as I could manage, and tied them toge-
ther that they might not drive away. Wben
this was done, I tied them together in form of a
raft, aud laid three or four short pieces of plank
on them crossways. I found it would bear me,
bnt very little weight besides -, and so, to strength-
en my raft, I cut a topmast into three or four
lengths, and added them to it; and then I con-
sidered what was most proper to load it with, it
being incapable of canyiog a tolerable weight.
At first, I laid upon it all the boards I could
get, and then I lowered down three of the sea-
men's chests, and silled them with provisions of
all forts. 1 found cloatbs -enough, but then
I took no more than my present occasions re-
quired. 1
My concern was chnfly upon tools to work
with, and fire arms and ammunition; and ac-
cordingly I found in my search, the c%r-pentei's
chest, and in the great cabin some fire arms and
ammunition, all which I put on board my raft;
and so, with two broken oars, &c. I put to sea.
Though every thing at first seemed to savour
my design, yet, after I had sailed about a mile, I
found on a sudden the fore parts of my raft run
aground, so that it was with the greatest difficul-
ty imaginable I kept my cargo tight together;
and indeed if I had not been extremely diligent
and careful, all had been lost and funk into th«
sea: but after some time, Providence so ordered
it, that at the rising of the water my raft float*
ed again, and so I happily landed my effects.
Not sar from the place where I landed, which
was at the mouth of a little cave, I discovered a
very high hill, -surrounded with a great many
little ones ; and thither resolved to go and
view the country, and see what place was prop-
er for me to fix my habitation in ; and accord-
ingly, arming myself with a fowling piece, a pis*
tol and some ammunition, I ascended the moun-
tains—and there sound I was in an island, be-
ing surrounded by the sea. It seemed to be a
barren uncultivated country, and only iahabited
by wild beasts.
Returning afterwards to my raft, I got my
goods on shore; and being very much afraid of
the wild beasts, I made a sort of fence or barri-
cade about it, which I thought might in some
measure secure me against the dangers I was
apprehensive of l and so that night I slept very
comfortably, and the next morning when I
awaked, I resolved to go again to the ship to get
such other neciffaries in as I had most occa-
sion for, before another storm came, when I
knew fh» must be dashed to pieces.
ln order to this second expedition, I mended
my raft where I found it defective, and brought
away from the ship a great many other tools,
cloaths, ammunition, and whatever else I tho't
most necessary for my future preservation and
subsistence. Then I made haste to shore, fear-
ing the wild beasts might come and devour what
I had already landed.
When I had landed all the second cargo, I fell
immediately to work to make me a little tent,
and fortified it in the best manner I could, to
secure myself as much as possible against any sud-
den attempt either from man or beast. After
this, I charged my fire arms, blocked up the
doors, and laid the bed I had brough' from the
ship upon the ground, and slept as comfortAj
as though I had been in my native country.
Bui still the thoughts of my future subsistence
and preservation were uppermost in my mind f
and therefore I went to the ship as often as pos-
fib/e, and brought away every thing I thought
could be of any use ; and indeed had so stored
myself, that I judged I was tolerably provided for
* considerable time.
I had now been eleven days in the island, and
as many times on board the ship; as I was going
the twelfth time, the wind began to rise; how-
ever, I ventured at low water, and with some
difficulty reached the ship, and rummaging the
cabins I found several other necessaries, and
among other things above 36I. sterl. in pieces of
eight : which, considering my present circum-
stances, I concluded was of small value to me;
however, I wrapped it up in a canvas rag; and
perceiving the storm began to increase, with all
that I was able to carry with me I made the best A
of my way to the shore. c
That night I slept very contentedly in my lit-
tle fortification; but when t looked out in the
morning, I found that the ship was lost. I was
very much concerned at this upon my thoughts;
but when I reflected I had done every thing in
my power to recover what was useful to me, I
comforted myself in the best manner I could,
and submitted myself entirely to the will of Pro-
vidence.
And now my thoughts were wholly taken up
how to defend and preserve myself from the sav-
ages and wild beasts, which I was extremely ap-
prehensive might be in some part or other of this
island; and at one time I thought to dig me a
caveat .another to build me a tent; at length I
|30blved,.6D, do both, and accordingly contrived
no the following macner.
'] 1 considered the ground where I was, was
ifh, and that t had no conveniences for
water ; and therefore I determined to find
a place more healthful and convenient; end, to
roy great comfort and satissaction, I soon found
one that answered my expectation.
The place was a little plain near a rising hill;
the front being as steep as the side of a house.
On the side of this rock was a little hollow piece, i
resembling the entrance of a cave ; just before
this place I resolved my tent should stand. This
{ilain was a hundred yards broad, and twice as
ong, with a pleasant descent every way to the
seaside. After this I drew a semicircle, contain-
ing about ten yards in the diameter and when
that was done I drove a row ot stakes not above
six inches from each other; and by the help of
my cables which I had brought from the ship,
and such other materials *s I made use of, I made

a lort of regular fortification—which I conclu-
ded was in a great measure impregnable against
any sudden attempts either of lav ages or wild
beasts; and, for my better security, I would have
no doors, but came iu by the help of a ladder,
which I made for that purpose.
Into this little garrison I carried all my store and
ammunition, and afterwards continued to work.
I not only made me a little cellar, but likewise
made my fortification stronger by the earth and
stones I dug out of the rock. One day a show-
er of rain sal ing, attended with thunder and
lightning, I was under terrible apprehensions
least my powder should take sire, and not only
hinder me from killing fowls, which were necef-
lary for my subsistence, but likewise blow me
up and my garrison at once ; the quantity I had
by me consisted of 1501b. weight at lest. Hav-
ing thus established myself as a king of the island,,
I went every day with my gun to fee what I
could kill that was fit to eat, and loon perceived
there were great numbers ot goats, but they were
shy ; however watching them very narrowly, I
happened to shoot a she goat as she was suckling;
her young one—which, not thinking her dam
killed, followed me home to my enclosure. I
lifted the kid over the pales, aud would willingly
have kept it alive—but the poor creature refu-
sing to eat, I was forced to kill it for my subsist-
ence.
Thus, entering into as odd a state of life as
ever befel an unfortunate man, I was continu-
ally reflecting upon the misery of my condition;
till at length considering there was no remedy*
and that I was obliged to make the best of a bad
market, and withal reflecting upon the maejr
turns of Providence in my particular preservar
tion, I grew more sedate and temperate.
It was, by the account I kept, the 30th of
September when I first landed on this island. —
about twelve days after, fearing I should lose
my reckoning of time, nay even forget the Sab-
bath, for want of pen, ink and paper, I carved it
with a knife rfpon a large post, in large letters,
setting it up in the similitude of a cross on the
shore where I landed, viz. "I came to shore,
Sept. 30, 1650." Every day I cut a notch on the
fides of this square post, and that for the Sab-
bath was as long again as the rest, and every first
day of Æ« month I kept my calendar, in weekly,
monthly and yearly reckoning of time. But had
I made more strict search (as I afterwards did)
I need not have set up this mark; for I found
among the parcels belonging to the gunner,,
carpenter, and captain's mate, those very thing*
I wanted, where I got not only pens and ink*
but likewise sea compasses, and other mathema-
tical instruments \ and, above all the rest, three
English Bibles, with several other good English,
books* which I carefully laid up, in order to
make use of them at proper intervals. But here
I cannot but call to mind our having a dog and
two. cats on board, whom I made inhabitants
with me in my castle. But, notwithstanding I
was thus plentifully supplied, I still wanted seve-
ral other necessaries, as needles and thread, and
more particularly a pickaxe and shovel for re-
moving the earth, &c.
It was a full year before I had finished my lit-
tle fortification : and after I had done that in the
best manner the nature of the place and my cir-
;umstances would allow, I began to grow a littler
more samiliar with my solitude, and to consider
of the best methods possible to render my deso-
late state at easy as I could. And here it was I
began the following journal.
JOURNAL.
SEPTEMBER 30, 1650, I was forced by
shipwreck upon this desolate island, which
1 called the Island of Despair. The next day I
spent in reflecting on the miserableneis of my
condition, which presented to me nothing but
death, and the worst of deaths too, viz. either to
be starved for want of victuals, or to be devoured
by wild beasts.
October 1. To my great comfort I discovered
the ship driven to the shore, from whence I had
lome hopes that when the storm was abated I
might recover something towards my present
subsistence; especially considering I observed the
ship to lie in a great measure upright, aod one
side of her perfectly dry; upon which I fell im-
mediately to wading over the sands, and with
great difficulty and danger I got on board. To
the 14th of this month, I spent in making voyages
backwards and forwards to and from the (hip,
the weather being all the while very wet and
uncertain.
Oct.20. My raft with my goods was overset;
most of which however I recovered at low water.
Oct. 25. It blew a fort of a storm, and rained
hard, (o that the ship dashed to pieces, and hotn-
ingof her was to be seen but the, very hull at
low water; and this day I thought it proper to
secure the effects I had preserved, from the
weather.
C- 3
Oct. 26. I wandered about to try if I could
find a place proper to fix my abode; and ac-
cordingly towards the evening, I found out a
rock, where I judged I might erect a wall and
fortify myself.
November 1. I placed my tent by the side of
a rock, and took up my lodging in a hammock,
very contentedly, for that night.
Nov. 2. I made a fence about my tent with
timber, chests, and boards.
Nov. 3. I shot two wild fowls, which proved
very good meat; and in the afternoon I made
me a sort of a table.
Nov. 4. I began to live regularly. In the
morning I walked out for an hour or two, and
afterwards worksd till about two, then ate my
dinner of such provisions as I had. After din-
ner I commonly slept an hour or two; and the
weather being extremely hot, I could not go to
work till towards the evening.
Nov. 5. I went out with my gun and the
dog I had brought out of the ship. I shot a
wild cat—but her flesh was good for nothing—
only I preserved her lkin. I saw a great flock of -
wild birds ; and was wonderfully terrified at the
fight of some monstrous seals which I saw on the
sand, but as they saw me they made off to sea.
Nov. 9. I finished my table. From the 7th
to the t2tb, the weather being sair, 1 worked
very hard: only I rested upon the 1 ith—which
according to nay computation, I took to be Sun-
day.
Nov. 13. The weather was very wet and
stormy, with thunder and lightning. On the
14th, I made provision to secure my powder-.—
which J perfected on the 14th and 15th. The
17th, I began to dig upon the rock, bat was pre-
vented for want of proper implements: and on
the i8ih I found a tree, the wood of which was
very hard—and out of that with the greatest dif-
ficulty I made me a sort of spade—in doing it,
I almost spoiled my axe, which might have been
of ill consequence.
Nov. 23. When I had got my tools into the
best order I could, I spent all my time to the
leth of December in finishing my cave : and lay
in my tent every night, unless the weather was so
<wet that I could not lie dry—and withal I had
so well thatched it over with flags and the leaves
of trees, &c. that I thought myself tolerably se-
cure.
Dec. 10. I had no sooner finished my habita-
tion, but a great part of the roof fell in upon
me, and it was a great mercy I had not perished
in the ruins : and indeed it gave me a great deal
of trouble before I repaired it effectually—and
after I had done what I could, I spent several
days in putting my things in order—and had va-
riety of weather to the 27th.
Dec. 27. In my rounds I chanced to meet
some goats. I shot one of them, and lamed an-
other, which I led home, and bound up its leg—
in a little time it grew well, and was so tame and
familiar that it followed me every where like a
dog, which put the notion into my head to bring
up these wild creatures as often as I could take
them alive, that I might have stock to subsist up-
on in case I should live after my powder was
exhausted. -
Dec. 28, 29, 30. The weather was so veey
- hot, that I was forced to keep within my shelter.
January 1. Though the weather continued
o
vet j sultry, yet necessity compelled me to go
abroad with my gun. In the valleys I found
great numbers ot goats; but they were se very
shy, I could by no means come at one of them.
From Jan. 3, to the 13th, my business was to
search the island, and to finish my wall.* In my
search I found great numbers of fowls, much
like our English pigeons. I (hot some of them,
which proved excellent food. And now it was
a providential thing happened—which was thns:
Whilst I was rummaging my moveables, what
should sall into my hands but a bag, which I
suppose might be made use of to hold corn for
the fowls in the ship. I purposed to make use
of it to hold some of the powder, and so shook
out the dust and loose corn upon one side of the
rock, not in the lest snlpecting the consequence.
The rain had sallen in great quantities a few
days before: and the month after, to my great
surprise, I discovered something spring up very
green and flourishing; and as I came daily to
view it, I saw several ears of green barley of the
very fame size and shape of those in England.
My thoughts were very much confused at this
unexpected sight: and I must own I had the van-
ity to imagine that Providence had ordered this
on purpose for my subsistence. Great were my
acknowledgements and thankfulness to almighty
God, for his mercies to me m this desolate
place ; which were infinitely heightened, when,
at the same time, I observed some rice stalks,
wonderfully green and flourishing; which made
me conclude here must consequently be more
corn in the island; and accordingly I spent sev-
eral days in searching the rock ; when at length
it came into my mind that I had shaken the bag
on the very spot where those blades of corn were
growing.
It was about the latter end of June before
these ears of corn grew ripe; and tben I laid
them up exceeding carefully, expecting I should
one day reap the advantage of this little crop—
which I used all my industry to improve ) and
yet it was four years before I could eat any bar-
ley bread, and much longer before I bad any
benefit from my rice. After this, with indesati-
gable care and industry, I finished my wall, or-
dering it so that I had no way to go into my
fortress but by a ladder.
April 16. I finished my ladder, and went up*
it, and pulled it after me, as I always did; and,
in truth, bad so well fortified myself, that I was
as I thought, indifferently well secured against
any surprise ; nevertheless as I was one day fit-
ting in my cave, there happened such a sodden
earthquake, that the roof of my little fortress,,
that I had finished with so much labour, came
tumbling down upon my head ; upon which*
with the greatest amazement, I ran to my ladder,
and got out of my cave, and saw the top of a
vast rock sall into the sea, and expected every
moment the whole island would be swallowed up.
In this affMght I remained for some moments,
till I perceived the fury of the motion bagan to
abate; but it was not long before I was under
new apprehensions, on account of a violent tem-
pest that attended it. This dreadful storm con-
tinued for about three hours, and then followed
such a heavy rain, that my tent was quite otter-
flowed ; upon which I concluded my habitation
was ill situated, and determined, is soon as pos-
sible, to build me one in a more convenient place-
34 B I N & 0 N .
April 29,- 30, wr.re spent in contriving how,
and in what maaner, I should fix my new abode,
and here I was under the greatest concern, ha-
ving no tools sitting for iuch an undertaking;
however, I spent several days in whetting and
grinding my tools.
May 1. As I was walking along the seaside, I
found a barrel of gun powder and divers other,
pieces of the ship, which the violence of the late
storm had thrown on the sand. I law likewise the
remaining part of the stiip, th own by the tem-
pest, very near the shore, and resolved to get to
her as scon as I could; but at that time I found
it impracticable.
I continued to work upon the wreck till the
24th, and every day recovered something that
would be of use to me, and got together to ma-
ny p'acks, and so much iron, lead, and other
accessaries, that, if I had had tools and {kill, I
might have built me a boat; which was a thing
I very much wanted.
June 16. As I was stroliog towards the sea,
I found a large turtle: The 17th I spent in
cookiog it : I found in her 70 eggs, and the
fl. sli the most delicous meat that ever I tasted.
The 18th, I staid within the whole day, there
being a continual rain, with storms of wind and
lightning.
From the 19th to the 27th of June, I was ve-
ry sick, and had got a terrible ague, which often
held me for nine or ten hours with extreme vi-
olence. On the 18th, I began to recover a little,
but was very restless in the night, and was worle j
as often as I laid my eyes together, I was tor-
merited with hideous dreams and dreadful ap-
paritions. It is impossible for me to express the-
C H..U.S 0 E.

agonies I was under by these repeated admoni-
tions, as I took them to be. My sather's advice
and reproof came into my mind, whether I
> would or not, and shocked me exceedingly, and
would often make me reflect that the justice of
God followed me, and that severe punishment
was justly owing to my disobedience and wicked
life.
June 28. I slept pretty well most part of rhe
night, which refreshed me very much; in the
morning I ate a biscuit and drank some water
mixed with rum; I boiled a piece of goat's flesh
for my dinner, but ate very little, and at night I
supped upon three of my turtle's eggs; after
supper I attempted to walk out with my gun,
but found myself too weak, and so returned to
my habitation, < -.
Here conscience flew in my sace, reprehend-
ing me as a blasphemer and a reprobate; for
saying in my agonies, " What have I done, to
be distinguished in all this scene of misery."—
Methought I heard a voice answering me,
"Ungrateful wretch ! dare you ask what you
have done i Look upon your past life, and
then ask thyself, why thou wast not drowned, in
Yarmouth road, or killed by the Sallee Rovers i
Why not devoured by wild beasts in the desarts
of Africa, or drowned here with the rest of
thy companions I"
Struck dumb by these severe reflections, and,
fearing the return of my ague, I began at length
to consider what was most proper to be done,
to free myself from this distemper ; and, having
heard that the Brasilians use tabacco for most
of their diseases, I relolved to try this experiraeDr.
I tried several ways with the tobacco: first I
took a leaf and chewed ir, which made roe very
sick, and almost stupified me ; then I steep'd it
in rum, resolving to take a good dose of it when
I went to bed, and then I put some into a pan
and burnt it, holding my nose over the smoak
at long as I could endure it without sossocating.
After these several operation* I fell into a sweat
and slept quietly and well for thirteen or four*
teen hour* ; and when I got up in the morning
1 found my spirit* revived, my stomach much
better, and I grew exceedingly hungry, which I
had not been for some time past : In short, I
missed my fit the next day, and found that I eve-
37 day grew stronger and better.
killed e fowl not much unlike a brandgoose, but
did not oat of the flesh, chusing rather to dine
upon two or three more of my turtle's eggs. Ia
the evening I renewed my medicine : notwith-
standing which, I had a little spice of my fit the
next day 1 and, therefore, on the ad of July, I
took my medicine a* I did at first; and on tbc
14th, which wa* the day I expected the return
of my fit, the ague lest me, which was no small
joy to me; and indeed the goodness of God on
this occasion, affected me lo sensibly that I fell
on my knees and returned thanks in a most de-
vout and solemn manner.
July 4. I walked out with my gun : but my
distemper having reduced me very low, I could
go but a little way at a time; for, the experiment
having weakened me exceedingly, I was able to
walk bat a very fibort way at once. I had now
been on the island about ten months—and all the
while bad not seen either man or woman. And
so, growing better, I began to think myself sole

I ventured out with my gun, and

monarch of the isle; and, growing indiffer-
ently well, Lcdolved to take a tour about the
isle, in order to view the extent of my do-
( minions, and to make what discoveries I
could.
On the !5th I began my Journey ; and, a-
mong other things, I sound a little brook of
running water; on the banks of which were
many meadows covered with grafs: I saw
several stalks of tobacco, and other plants I
knew nothing of; among the rest I found
feme sugar canes, several plants of aloe wands
&c. With these discoveries I returned well
satisfied to my little castle, & slept that night
very comfortably.
The next day, going the fame way, and far-
ther than before, I found the country full of
wood, and exceedingly pleasant and delight-
ful. The melons lay upon the ground in
great quantities, and clusters of grapes hung
upon the trees. Yon may imagine I was
glad of this discovery, yet ate very sparingly,
lest I should throw myself into a flux or
fever.
The ntght coming on, I climbed up into a
tret, and having fixed myself as securely as
possible, slept -very comfortably, though it
was the first time I had ever lain out of my
habitation. When the morning came, 1 pro-
ceeded with the greatest pleasure about tour
mile 1 sarther; and at the end of a valley, I
found a spring of excellent water; and now
I resolved to lay in as much of the fruit as
possible.
July t8. Having prepared two bags, I
returned thither again, in order to bring
D
3«
ROB 1 N S 0 N
home to my castle as much of the several
forts of fruits as I could, that I night have a
stock by me agaiost I should want it. And
now I began to reflect that this part of the
island was infinitely the best to inhabit in;
but then I thought at the same time, that if
I removed from my present place of abode I
should loose the prospect of the sea ; and so,
if providence should order a ship on that
coast, 1 should Io(e all possibility of deliver-
ance. However the place was so delightful*
I resolved to build me a kind of bower, which
took me up the remainder of July.
Here it was that I dried my grapes, which
I afterwards carried to my old habitation, for
a wioter supply. On the 14th of August
the rain began to fall with great violence,
which made me judge it was proper to re-
lire to my castle for shelter.. The rain con-
tinued to fall, more or less, till the middle of
October, and sometimes with that violence,
that for several days I could not stir out of
my cave, till I was constrained to it by the
pure want of food. I went out twice ; the
first time I shot a goat, and the second time I
found another turtle, as large as the former.
September 30. Casting up the notches
on the post which amounted to 365, I con-
cluded this to be the anniversary of my land-
ing. And, after I had returned thanks for
my wonderful preservation in this desolate
is!md I went to bed and sl:pt very comfor-
tably.

Before I proceed further in roy Journal, I
must take the liberty to put the reader in
mind of the barley and rice: I had saved a-
bout thirty stalks of the former and twenty
of the latter ; and concluding the season to
be proper, I dug up some ground with my
wooden spade, and lowed it; which at the
proper time grew up, and answered my ex-
pectations.
The wet weather was no sooner gone, but
try inclination led me again to the bower. I
had built on the other side of the isUnd,
which I found whole and entire a* I had left
it, and the stakes all growing much after the
na'ure cf our willows, which in time made
roe a noble fence, as I shall have occasion to
observe more particularly hereafter.
And now I conceived that the seasons of
the year might be divided into wet and dry,
and not into Summer and Winter, as in Eu-
rope; as thus:

And, as the wind continued to blow, the
wet seasons would continue e ther longer
or shorter. After I had made these and the
like observation^, I always took care to pro-
vide necessaries, that I might stay within dur-
ing the wetness of the weather, and in that
time I took care to make me such tools as I
most wasted.
The first thing I attempted was to make
me a basket, which after much labour and
dissiculty, I effected but the two things I
most wanted were utterly out of my power,
viz- some casks to hold my liquors, and small
pots to boil and stew my meat, and also a
tobacco pipe, for which I at last found out a
remedy.
After the weather grew sair my farther
resolution of viewing the whole island took
place; accordingly, taking 017 dog and my
gun, and other necessaries proper, I set for-
ward •, and having passed the vale where my
bower stood, I came within fight of the sea
lying to the W. and when it was clear day,
I could discover land, but could not tell
whether it was an island or a continent; nei-
ther could 1 tell what place this might be,
*- only I thought it was in America, and con-
sequently that part of the country that lie*
between the Spanish territories and the Bra-
fits, which abound with cannibals, who de-
vour human kind. In viewing this part of
the island, I found it was much more pleasant
and fruitful than where I had pitched my
tent. Here were great numbers of parrots,
and with great dissiculty I got one of them
which I carried home with me, but it was a
great while before 1 could tame it and bring
it to speak, even so much as to call me by-

grapes and other excellent fruits: in this ex-
pedition I did not travel above two miles a,
day, being desirous to make what discoveries
I could. Whep I came to the sea shore, I
was amazed to lee it exceedingly beautiful,
and so full of excellent fish. But though
this journey was lo delightful to me, yet my
secret inclination led me to my old habita-
tion; so, after, I had set up a sort of land
mark for my guide for the future, I conclud-
ed to return back by a different way than I
came ; and as I was making the best of my
way, my dog happened to surprise a kid,
which I rescued from him, and led it to roy
bower, in order to try if I could raise a breed
which would be of great ule to me.
After I had been about a month upon this
expedition I returned to my little castle, and
reposed myself with great pleasure ia my
hammock, and continued a week within to
rest and refresh myself.' .
And new I began to think of the kid I
had left in the bower, and resolved immedi-
ately to fetch it home. When 1 arrived there
I found it almost starved; when feeding it
with branches of such shrubs as I could find,
the poor creature io gratitude for its deliver-
ance, followed roe as naturally as roy dog,
quite home to my castle, which I afterward!
kept as one of my domesticks.
The wet season being come, 1 kept myself
within ; and on the 30th of September, being
the third year of my abode in this island, 1
paid my solemn acknowledgments to Almigh-
ty God for my preservation, and entertained
-myself with a world of reflections upoa my.
43
present and former conditions; and as I wa«
one morning sadly pondering upon my pres-
ent state, I happened to open my bible, when
I fixed my eyes op these words, / will ntvtr
leave thee, nor forsake thee; which I present-
ly took as directed to myself ; and I must
own, the expression gave me a great deal of
secret satisfaction.
The beginning of this year I fixed my dai'y
employments as follow: The moroi.g I spent
in my devotions, and paying my du:y to God;
after I had done that, I went out with my
gun, to seek provision ; which, after I had
got it, took me up some time in dressing and
cooking ; in the middle of the day I was for-
ced to lie by, by reason of the excessive heat;
and the rest of the time I spent making and
Coot living such necessaries as I stood most in
seed of.
But now the time for my little harvest
coming on, I had the desirable prospect of a.
good crop, but my. hopes were sadiy disap-
pointed, by the goats and hares ; who having
lasted the sweetness of my corn, had cropped
it so Close, that it had not strength to shoat
Up into a stalk : To prevent this, I was forc-
ed to make a hedge round it; but I had no
sooner done this, than I was infested with
-vermin of another fort; my back was no
sooner turned but whole stocks ot bh Js came
and destroyed what the others had left; 11st
fl-y at ihi e, and killed three of them, which
I bung upon flak ft as a terror to the rest.•,
wiiich pi oj:ct had so good an tff;ft, that they
not only forsook the corpj but .that part of
the island £or ev«r after..
My corn growing ripe and harvest coming
on, I cut it down and carried home the ears:
and, after I had rubbed them, and threshed
them in the best manner I could, as near as
I could conjecture, the produce of the bar-
ley wat about two bushels and a half, and
that of the rice about the same qnantity ; Sc
now I plainly saw, by the providence of God,
I should be supplied with corn, though at the
same time I wanted all manner ot necessa-
ries for making it into bread, which with the
greatest labor and difficulty I afterwards sup-
plied.
My seed being thus increased, my next
care was to prepare more land to sow it in;
and accordingly I fixed upon two Urge plats
on the back fide of my ostle, in which I sow-
ed my seed, and fenced it with a good hedge,
to defend it from the vermin.
In short, my corn increased to that degree,
that I thought I might now venture to( eat
Ibme ol it; but how to make into bread was
still the dissiculty; and yet even this I found
the means to surmount at last; aa l so, as in
all other emergencies, I found a remedy be-
yond my expectation.
After I had procured every thing needful
for making my bread, which you may ima-
gine w s no small satissaction, the prospect
of land which I had seen from the othei fide
of the island, ran still in my mind ; but how
I should come at it I was utterly at a loss to
know ; I tried to recover the ship'* boat, and
then to make me a canoe but all in via ; &
here I could not forbear rtflectiog u?on he
folly of those who undert-ke matters thai
they are not able to go thiough vhh.
45
I was in the midst of my project*, when my
fourth year expired since I had been cast on
w this island ; nor did I forget to keep my an-
^ -niversary with that solemnity and devotion
that I had done the year before; I began to
| think myself separated from the world, and
from all opportunities of friendly conversa-
tion. I had nothing to covet, being, at it
were, an emperor or king of a whole coun-
try, where I had nobody to controul me, nor
any body to govern but myself.
These thoughts made me look upon the
things of this world with a sort of religious
contempt, and rendered me easy in my deso-
late and melancholy condkion; for, having
made God's mercies to me matters of the
highest consolation, I relinquished all pensive
thoughts and dismal apprehensions, and re-
signed myself up entirely to God's providence.
My ink was quite gone, and my Biscuit al-
most exhausted i my linen was worn out,
only some of the sailors checked shirts re-
mained, which were of mighty use to me in
hot weather. My cloaths and hat were quite
worn, but those I supplied by the help of my
goat skins, of which I first made me a sort
of a cap, and then a waistcoat, and open
kneed breeches with the hair on the outside i
and thus being perfectly at eale in my mind,
I spent my time in contemplating the bless-
ings of heaven, and was ravished to think
that one time or other I should be delivered
from, my present misfortunes, and placed out
-of the reach of them forever.
For five years after this nothing worth
oacqtioniog happened, only at spare times I
46
ROBINSON
had finished a small canoe, with which, at alt
hazards, I resolved to try to discover the cir-
cumference of my dominions ; and in order
to it, I put provisions on board, with ammu-
nition, and all other necessaries sit for the ex-
pedition.
It was the 16th of November, in the 9th
year of my reigo, that I began this voyage,
which was much longer than I expected, by
reason I had many dissiculties to encounter I
did not suspect ; and indeed the rocks were
so high, and ran so far into the sea, that I
often resolved to turn back, rather than run
the risque of being driven so sar out to the sea
as by no means to be able to get back again.
Iu this confusion I came to an anchor as
46
ed, and climbing up to the top of a high
hill, I viewed the extent of my dominions,
and, at all hazards, resolved to pursue my
voyage. It is endless to relate what danger
my rasheefs exposed me to ; I waj driven by
the current so far into the lea, that I had
hardlyany prospect of getting back'again;
not by all I could do with my paddles, which
I had made to supply the place of scul'.s to
help me; and now had no prospect but p;-
rislYmg a: ica when my provisions were spent,
or, it a storm should arise, before. How-
ever, by the lucky chance of the wind, or
rather by the particular providence of God,
I was driven back again to the HI <nd, and to
rr.y unlpeak b c joy, I came on shore ; where,
beiaq exceedingly fatigued wt h watching and
hard labor, I laid me down and took a little
repose. Afur I awoke, and had dressed œy-
self as usual, I laid up my boat in a small
convenient creek fit for my purpose, & tak-
ing my gun &c. I made the best of my way
to my bower, where I again laid me down to
rest ; but it was not long before I was sur-
prised wiih a voice, which called, Robin Cru-
soe, poor RoHn Crusoe! where have you been
poor Robin Crusoe?

Upon which I started up in gseatcootusion,
and casting ray eyes round, I saw my parrot
fitting upon the hedge; and then I knew it
was she that called me, but was strangely sur-
prized how the creature came there, and vrhy
it should fix upon that place above the rest.
The bird came to me as seen as I called it,
and perched upon my finger, as usual, and
seemed to signify a great deal of j y for my
return.
This voyage had cured me of a great deal
of my rambliog inclination ; insomuch that
I tngan to lay aside a'l hopes of deliverance;
so I led a retired life, and in ave y confer ted
manner passed away near tweive months,
spending my time in making instruments, &
«!omg such things as we;e most absolutely ne-
cessary, both for u?y present and future sub-
sistence.

My next consideration was, my powder
growing short, what I shoHld do to kill the
goats and fowls to live upon : I had abun-
dance of contrivances in my head to try to
catch the goats alive, particularly the she
goats with yt ut g and at length I had my de-
sire"; for making pit salls, and baiting them
with some of my corn.one morning I found in
one of them an old he goat, and in the other
three young ones, one male and two females.
The eld one was too strong for me, and I
could not tell how to master him: but the
kids I made shift to get to my habitation. It
was some time before I could make them feed,
hut after they had for some time beeo with-
out food, and I threw them some fresh corn,
and gave them some water, their stomachs
came to them. And now my next care was
to find them pasture, and secure them so that
they might not run away, all which I at last
effected ; and withal, by my well using these
pocr creatures, I had made them so tame
and samiliar, that they would follow me and
eat corn out of my hand. Thus having an-
swered my ends, I think, in about eighteen
months time, I got a flock of about twelve;
and in less than two years forty three; and
nofc I was not only provided with goat's
flesh, but with milk also, which was another
Wcsling I had little reason to expect.
Being thus happy, and having almost for-
got all hopes of liberty, I lived as well as the
nature of my condition could possibly allows
and indeed, it was a very diverting sight to
fee me sit in state at my dinner, all alone by
myself, like a king; and it would have been
a very pleasant object to have seen me in mj
goat slsin dress, and other suitable habili-
ments.
My shies concern now was about my boat,
which 1 was extremely unwilling to lose, it
having cost me so much hard labour : I went
by land to the place where I left it, but found
there was no way to bring it off, without
runniog the fame risque I was so lately ex-
posed to, which I thought too dangerous for
a second experiment, and therefore I resolv-
ed upon another expedient, which was to
snake another canoe, and leave it on the
other fide of the island.
- And here 1 think it may not be improper
to inform the reader that I had two planta-
tions in the island: the first was my little
"fort, or castle, where I had made several im-
provements; and the second was my bower,
ar country feat, where were my grapes and
the enclosures for my goats, and several
other conveniences, that made it a very plea-
sant and agreeable retirement.
To this place it was that I used to go of-
ten to view my goats. And now I shall re-
late a thing that gave me the most disquiet of
any thing that I bad met with since my first
coming into the island.
It may well be supposed that, after I bad
been so long in this desolate part of the world,
nothing could have been more amazing than
to have seen any human creature ; but one
day, as I was going to my boat, as ulual, £
perceived, on the (and, the print of a man's
naked foot and had I seen an apparition, 1
could not have been more terrified. I look-
ed round on all sides, but could not hear or
see any thing; I observed the trampling!,
and wat convinced, from all signs, that some
foot had been there : and in the deepest con.-
fusion, I returned back to my habitation.
That night I never closed my eyes, and
wat full of the most dismal apprehensions that
I ever had in all my life. Sometimes I had
the folly to think it must be the devil •, at
other times I thought it rather some savage,
that the current had driven in, and not lik-
ing the place, was secretly gone off to sea a-
gain. Happy was I, io my thoughts that
Done of the savages had seen me ; and yet,
at the same time, I was exceedingly terrified
lest they should have leen my boat, and so
come in great numbers, and find me out,
and devour me, and all my little stock, that
I had been so long gathering. These tho'rt
afflicted me extremely; and yet, after ma-
ture consideration, I concluded it was my best
way to throw myself upon the Sovereign Go-
vernor pf the World, and to lubmit entirely
to his mercy and providence.
After a world of fears and apprehensions,
for three nights and days, I ventured out of
my fortress j I milked my goats, and after
I had put every thing in order, not without
the greatest consternation, I went again to
the shore to make my farther observations 5
and upon the whole, concluded, that ei;her
the island was inhabited, or that some person
had been on shore, and that I might be sur-
prized before I was aware.
This put several frightful notions into roy
head, insomuch that sleep was an entire
stranger lo me ; my whole thoughts being
taken up on nothing but my preservation, I
put my castle into the best posture of defence I
was able, and placed all my guns so that they
might be serviceable if I should have occasion
to make use of them.
I divided toy goats into several parcels;
ten she goats and two he ones I put into one
part of the island, and the other ten, with
two he ones, in another; and whilst I was
in search of the latter, which was on the
Western part of. the island, I thought I dis-
covered a boat, but at too great a distance to
make out what ihe was. Being come to the
ihore, upon the 5. W. part of the island, I
was convinced that they were savages, feeing
the piece covered over with the skulls and
mangled limbs of human bodies. I observed
likewise a sort of a circle, in the mi a ft ot
which I perceived there had been a fire;
about this I conjectured these wretches far,
and unnaturally sacriSced and devoured their
fellow creatures,
j she horror and loathfulnese of this dread-
ful spectacle confounded me so, that, though
I was satisfied these savages never came into
the part of (he island where I was, yet such
an abhorrence of them had seized me, th&i
for two yiars I confined myfeif in my castle,
my c&untry sear, and my enclosures; aud
-Jhus my circumstances remained for seme
time undisturbed. But still my grand io-
tentioa resiamsd, which was to try If I could
destroy some of those savages, and save a vic-
tim that I might afterwards make my servant.
Many were my projects and contrivances
to bring this about; at length I eame to this
fettled resolution, to lie privately in ambush,
in some convenient place, & let fly upon them
with my guns first, and theo with my pistols,
and sword in hand ; and so much did this
proposal please my sancy, that I fully resolv-
ed to put it in practice the first opportunity}
and accordingly, I soon found a place conve-
nient for my purpose; but at the same time.,
I had several checks of conscience, and rea-
soning with myself, concerning the lawfulness
and justice of the attempt; and, after a long
debate, I concluded to lay aside the design.
Whilst I was cutting down some wood one
day,,to make charcoal to drels my meet and
do the samily necessaries, 1 perceived a very
large cavity; and going towards it, I could
perceive two large eyes staring upon me ; up-
on which I made haste out, extremely terri-
fied, not imagining what it could be that
looked so frightfully: However, after I had
recovered from my surprize, I went again in*
to the cavity, resolving, at all hazards, to see
what it was; and when I came near enough
to discern it perfectly, what should it be, after
all, but a monstrous he goat lying on the
ground, and gasping for life, through mexe
old age.
The ceature was not able to stand, and
so I let him lie undisturbed, and employed
myself in viewing the place and making obser-
vations. At the further, side of ii I observed
C R U $ V S.
S3
a sort of an entrance, but so low, as to oblige
me to creep on my hands and knees to it :—
I had no candle, and the place was viark, and
so I suspended my enterprize till the next
day, when I returned with six large ones of
my own making.
After I had passed the strait passage, I
found- the roof ruse higher up; and sure,
When I got sarther in, no mortal ever saw a
more beautiful sight! The walls aud the
roof reflected a thousand lights from my two
candles ; and indeed, it seemed to me the
most delightful grotto I had ever heard of.
In short, I could find no sault but in the en-
trance, and which I thought would be very
, necessary for my defence & security ; there-
fore I determined to make the place my prin-
cipal magazine ; and accordingly, I carried
thither, with the utmost expedition, some
arms&amunition judging it impossible for me
to be surprized by the savages in that sastness.
I think I was now in the 23d year of my
reign, and tolerably easy in my condition -
By this time my parrot had learnt to talk,
English very well, and many diverting hours
we uled to have together. My dog died of
old age ; and my cats increased so sast, thaj
I was often forced to destroy some of them,
lest I should be over run with their numbers;
I always kept two or three domestic Goats
'about me, and had several fowls that built
and bred about my castle, so as to make me
happy as I could with : But alas ! whit ua-
'foreseen events destroy the uncertain enjqy»
meats of. human happiness.!
Æ, z
It was now December, the time of 017 bar-
vest, when, going out one morning early,
there appeared to me from the shore, about
two miles distance from me, a flaming light
from that pa"rt of the island where I bad be -
fore observed sbme savages had been on my
fide of the water.
Terrified with this unusual spectacle, and
being under dismal apprehensions that these,
savages would find me out, and destroy me,
I went directly home to my castle, and shut
myself up as sast as I could, and put myself
into a posture of defence ; and afterwards I
* got up to the top ot the rock, and viewing
with my prospective glass, I could discern no
less then nine naked savages fitting round a
fire, and eating (at I supposed) Jiuman flesh,
with,their two canoes "hauled on shore, wait-
ing for the tide to carry them back again.
Nothing can express my detestation of so
horrid a sight; especially when I found they
were gone, and I had been at the place of
sacrifice and saw the limbs and flesh of hu-
man creatures lie torn and mangled upon
the ground; In short, my indignation against
them rose so high, that let the consequence
be what it would, I determined to be reveng-
ed upon the first that should come thither,
though I lost my life in the attempt.
I found afterwards that they did not come
over to this island very often ; and as near I
can remember it was a year or more before
I saw any more of them. But before I pro-
ceed sather, I have another account that will
deserve the reader's attention.
, .^T^.C- R U S 0 E. 55
Ii was the i6 h of May, according to roy
wooden calender, afier a very terrible storm
when I was alarm-d with the noise of a gun
as fired from a ship in distress; upon which
I immediately took my glass and went up to
the top of the rock where I had nut been a
moment but a flame of fire gave notice of
another gun; and then I was confirmed in
* my. opinion, that it could be nothiog less thaa
a (hip in distress; which, with my glass I soon
discovered to be true ; and that the wreck
was .upon thole hidden rocks, where I was in
great danger of being lost in my boat.

I made a fire upon the hilt by way of sig-
nal aod they saw it, and answered it with
several guns. The weather was very hazy,
and so I could not, at that time, discover
cither at what distance the (hip lay, or what
she was ; but the weather clearing up, I saw
a ship cast away some distance at sea.
I had several notions concerning them, at
is natural in such cases ; but considering se-
riously the place where they were, and all
other circumstances, I could.not conceive any
possibility but that they must be all lost ; and
indeed, to the last year of my being in this
island, 1 never knew of any that were saved
out of this ship t I only saw the body of a
a boy which was driven on shore, but I could
cot discover by him of what nation they were.
The sea was now very calm, which tempt-
ed me io venture to the wreck, not only in
hopes to get something I wanted, but like- i
wise, if there was any body left alive in the
ship, to endeavour to save their lives. This
resolution sa sar prevailed, that I went home
immediately and got every thing ready for
the voyage; and accordingly after a great
deal of labour, hazard, and difficulty, I at
length got to the wreck which I beheld with
the greatest pity and concern. By her built
I found she was a Spaniard, and had endue*,
ed a terrible conflict before she was lost.
When I was come near to bfcr, I saw a
dog on board, who no sooner saw me but he
fell to yelping and howling, and I no sooner
called to hjm, but the poor creature jumped
into the sea and swam to me and I took him
into the boat almost familhtd. When I
came into the ship, the first fight that I be-
held was two drowned men in the arms of
each other; I found she was a rich ship, and
as I had reason to believe, bound home ft oat .
the Spanish Westindies. What became of
the rest of the Sailor* I could not ted, there
being none of their bodies on board, besides
the two before mentioned.
As I was rummaging about her, I found
several things I wanted, viz a fire shovel and
long*] two brass kettles, a pot to m<ke cho-
colate, some horns of fine gif zed powder, a
gridiron, and several other necessaries. These
I put on board my boar, together with two
chests and a cask of rum; and after a great
deal of toil and dissiculty, I got safe back to
the island.
I reposed myself that night in the boat,
and the next day landed my cargo, which I
carried to my grotto ; and baviog examined
my effects, I. found in the two chests several
things I wanted, particularly some shirts and
handkerchiefs; I found also three bags of
pieces of eight; all which I would willingly
have given for five or sis pair* of English
shoes and stockings.
After I bad stowed all this new cargoe
into my c*ve, I made the best of my way to
my castle and found every thing as I left it,
so that I had nothing to do but to repose
myself, and to take care of my domestics.
And now wanting nothing that was requi-
site for the support of life, I might have liv-
ed very quiet, had not rae apprehension of
the savages disturbed me ; upon which ac-
count I seldom went sar abroad, if I did, k
was to the eastern part of the .iflwd, where
I well knew they never came: And for two
years I lived in this anxious condition, my
58
ROBINSON
head being always full of projects how I.
might get away from this desolate place.
As I observed before, though I was tolera-
bly secure aganistthe reach of want and had
all the diveilion the nature of the island
would allow, yet the thoughts of my deliver-
ance were still uppermost, as the reader will
easily perceive by the following relatio-n in
which I shall give a ihort account of the
schemes and pi ejects I made for my escape.
As I lay in my bed one night in JWarchi
the 24th year of my solitude, I ran through
all the accounts of my life, from my veiy
first remembrance to the present time, and
found all along that the providence of God
had been exceedingly kind and merciful to
me, and when I considered, more particular-
ly how many dangers I bad passed, it could
not but make me devoiftly thankful to my
great deliverer, without whose assistance I
must inevitably have perished.
After shad thus briefly debated with my-
self on my present and former condition.
I began next to consider the nature of these
savages, and the country that they inhabited,
how far it was to the place from whence they
same, and what boats they had to bring then
over hither, and at the fame time had seme
nctions to go over to their side, :o fee what
disc a? eiies I could cuke.
I bad notions, that, if by any method I
could get upon the continent, I might in
time meefw'nh a ship to carry me to Europey
for here I locked upon myself to be the
mest miserable a:an livisvj, and prefered evea
death itself to my stay in this desolate island.
Vfhiist my thoughts were thus confused,
I had no notion of any thing else bnt my
voyage to the continent; and indeed so
much was I inflamed with thef; notions, that
I in a great measure forgot my duty to God
and was reduced almost to a state of despara-
tion ; and after many thoughts and strug-
gling* in ir.y mind, I came at length to this
conclusion, viz. That the only probable way
I had to escape, was to get one of these la-
vages; which I could find no other way to
bring about, than by venturing my lire to
save him from the jaws of hts devourers,
which I thought must inspire him with grati-
tude tq his preserver. ;,
These were my fixed Resolutions, but I
think |t was at least a year and an half be-
fore I could find an opportunity of putting
them in execution. To the best of my re-
membrance it was the 23d day ot April, ear-
ly in the morning, when I was surprized with
the sight of five canoes, all on shore toge-
ther, on my side of the island, and the crea-
tures that belonged to them all landed and
out of sight.
At first I thought all these boats must
bring too many to be attacked by one pet*- »
son* and was in a mighty 'confusion at to
what was best to be done ; however, being
impatient to fee something of their manage-,
ment, I took my guru, and went secretly to
the top of the hill, where, by the help of my
prospective glass, I observed no less than thir-
ty> sitting round a fire and feasting upon
6o
R 0 B T NS0N
what meat they had dressed; what it was I
could not distinguish : Afterwards they alt
danced around the flames, using many fright-
ful and barbarous Gestures.
Whilst I was locking earnestly on these
wretches, I could discern them dragging two
miserable ceatures out of one of their boats.
It was not long before I saw one of them
knocked down, and three or four of them
fell to cutting aad mangling his body, in or-
der to devour him as they had done the for-
mer. Whilst the other miserable creature
stood expecting every moment (he sate of hir
companion, inspired with the hopes of life
he gave a f-idden start from them, and ran
with great swiftness towards my castle.

I was under great apprehensions that he
would fly to soy grove for protection. I vat
glad to fee he had the heels of them,and from
his swiftness,concluded he would presently lose
fight of them, and save hit life. . There was
a little creek just before him, where I was a-
fraid the poor victim would be taken U be
could not swim; but it happened he swam
very well and soou got over, and ran again
with his former strength aod swiftness. Two
of the three that followed him,(warn over after
him, but the other, that could not swim, re-
turned back to his companions. And now,
or never, I thought it was my time to pro-
cure a savage for my companion. Accord-
ingly, with all the speed I could, I came
down from the rock, took up my two guns,
resolving to save the victim if possible ; and
in order to it, came a nearer way, and put
myself between the Pursuers and the pursu-
ed, beckoning to the latter to stand still, who,
you must imagine, was not a little surprized
at me. The first pursuer I knocked down
with the stock of my piece, and the other,
who I perceived was preparing his bow and
arrow to shoot me, I let fly at, and hilled
him dead on the spot.
The poor frighted Indian was amazed to
fee the fire and bear the noise of the gun;
bos. ever, I made signs to him to come to me,
which at length he did, but net without a
great deal of fear and trembling, being afraid,
I believe, I should kill him too. 1 did all I
could to convince him of his mistake, and at
length so far convinced him, by the signs I
n

*2
RfrB 1 N S 0 N
made him, that he came to me, and threw
himself at my feet, and took one of my feet
and put it upon his head ; which wat a tok-
en, ir seems, of his resolution to be my slave
for ever ; upon which I took him up, made
much of him, and encouraged him in the
heft manner I could.
By this time I law the savage I had knock-
ed down, brgan to recover, and was fitting
upright, which made my new fiUve as much
afraid its before, but I soon prevented bis
fright by presenting my piece at him ; but my
sav*ge opposed my shooting him, making a
-figo to me to tend him my sword, -which
hung by my side, and no sooner had I grant-
ed hit-request, but away he ran to his enemy,
and very dexterously, at one blow, cut eff
his head; and as a token of triumph, bto't
it to me, together with my sword, and laid
it at my feet.
The greatest astonishment my new servant
was in, was, how I killed the savage at that
dhtance, without a bow and arrow ; and to
satisfy himself in that matter, he made signs
to me to let him go and view him. And
having viewed the wound the bullet had made
in his breast, he took up bis bow and ar-
rows, and came back to me again, making
signs to me to give him leave to buiy him,
which, with my consent, he peformed with
wonderful dexteri'y.
When I perce'ved he had done, I called
him away, and carried him direct'y to'stiy
cave, where I gave him victuals, and &MSn
feinted to him to lie down upon some straw,
and take a-little rest. He was a very hand-
some well-proportioned fellow, and in all
relpect* the most beautiful Indian I «ve*iaw.
I think he had not slept above an hour,
before he came out of the cave - to mt, at I
was milking my goats, and again threw him-
self at my sect, and. put roy other foot upon
his head, as a sarther token that he intended
to be. my stave forever.
That night we flayed in the cave; but
early the next morning, I made signs to him
to' rile and go with me; and, withal, made
him to understand that his name was to be
Friday, it being on that diy I laved his life,*
and that,I intended to give him semecloaths
to hide his nakedness. As we passed by the
place where the savages were buried, he
pointed directly to the graves, and let me
know by his gestures that he intended.to
dig them up and devour them, upon which
1 let him fee I was extremely displeased at it,
and made him come away, which he did with
the greatest reverence.
In our way to*he castle, we wjnt to the
top of a bill to view if the savages were gone,
and finding they were, we refreshed our^
selves for that night, and the next morning
I resolved.to arm myftl-f, aad take my man
with me, and go to view the p'ace where
they committed their barbarities. When
we carae upon the spoti it is irnprssibic to
express the horribieness of the sight! Ke:c
lay the flesh and entrails, and there the
mangled limbs of humm creatures ; in short,
it filled me with the greateft horror and do-
Robinson
reflation. Friday gave me to understand
that there we*e three there sacrificed,'and
it I had not rescued him, be had been the
fourth. I made him gather up the frag-
thent* and lay them in a heap, and made a
fitr upon them, and burnt them to ashes :—
and flitt I foUnd my man had a hankering
after some of the flesh, which I resented with
the utmost abhorrence, a-cid made him un-
derstand, that if ever I found him guilty of
any such inhumanity, I Would certainly shoot
him.
After this we went to my castle, where I
cloathed my man at well as the nature of the
place and my circumstances would admit.
He seemed at first a little uneasy and awk-
ward in his new dress; but after he had worn
them four or sire days, he grew familiar with
them, and seemed extremely well satisfied.
Now my next concern was, how I might
lodge him well, and yet be easy myself; and
in order to this, I erected him a little tent
between my two fortifications, secured my
arms every night, and made every thing so
safe, that it was impossible for me to be sur-
prised ; though I must at the same time own
there was no need of these cautions; for
never man was blessed with i. servant that lov-
ed aod obeyed him with greater tenderness,
fidelity and affection ; which endeared bim
to me extremely, and induced me to think
how I might best acquit myself to bim.
I had not been above two or three days in
my castle, when I first proposed to bring him
off from his barbarous inclination to human

neither his nor any other nation ever ate their
fellow creatures, bat such as the lav of arms
allowed to be devoured, and they were only
those-Whose misfortune it Was to be made
prisoners of war.
Some time after this, upon a very clear day,
my man and I went up to the top of a very
high hill, On the east fide of the island, from
whence I had since before seen the Continent
in America; t could not directy tell what
was the matter, for Friday fell to jumping
and dancing as if he Were mad; I ?fked him
the reason df his joy. Ojoy! said he; ghd!
there fee my country, there iny nation, there
lives "white mans all gether. Upon whicb I
could not help thinking, hut thatjif he could
by any meant get home, he would forget all
I had done for him, and perhaps bring his
countrymen into my island to destroy me:
But, to my shame I lpeak it, my j:aIoufy was
very ill grounded, for the poor fellow was of
a quite different disposition, and at I -found
afterwards, would freely have lost his life,
rather than have left me, or done me the least
injury.
Soon after this, I asked him if he had not
a desire to go into hit own country ? Yes, said*
fae, me much 0 glad to be at my own nation;
me gt if you go, me no go if you flay. I go,
Friday, said I, what /hall I do there? He
answered, 0 master, you do great deal much
good, you teachee all the wild mans to bs good

to knew God, and pray Cod. Alas! poor Fri-
day, said I, that's out of my power, neither
will I venture among them.: No, you shall,
go and leave me alone, at 1 was before I savr
ed your life ,
Never was, any creature, more thunder
struck than Friday was at these words, esocial-.
ly when I told him he. would be at liberty to
go as soon as the boat was ready to carry
him; he put one of his hatchets into my
hand, faying, only kill Friday ; Friday.cart not
livelong : But what most I kill you for.?
(said I } /ih! dear mailer, what, made you Fri-
day/aw* from eat a me up,so keep.long Friday
make Friday love God, and not love Bcnamuc-
kee, and now Friday send away, never .see
Friday more! When he spcke this, the tears
ran down so plentifully, that I had much ado.
to refrain from weeping myself; I comfort-
ed him in the best manner I could; telling
him, if he was willing to stay with me, I would
never part with him as long at I lived.
In short, the fellow's honesty and sincere
behaviour soon convinced me of the unrea^
sonabieness of my jealousy, and he become
more dear to me than ever. Indeed, I
thought .hat if ever I could get to the Con-
tinent, and join those white men Friday had
mentioned, it might be the means to further
my escape ; in order to this, Friday and, I
went into the woods to look cut a large tree,
to build a canoe, which we effected in about
fix weeks, and with much trouble and pains
get her into the water. I was very well pleas-
ed at the launching this little man cf war q'c
mice, which Friday managed with great D;x-
terity, and assured me it was ia a'l paints
large enough to carry ut over, &if I thought
proper, he was ready to venture with me.
I liked the fellow's hon. it proposal, but,
at the same time, I thought if I could procure
a mast and sail, it would be better -, which
with the greatest dissiculty imaginable, in a-
bout three months time, I made a shift to
patch together; and after that, I had my
man Fridiy to instruct in the art of naviga-
tion, which before he knew nothing of.
I was now entered in the twenty seventh
year of my reign, or rather of my captivity,
and kept the anniversary of my landing with
greater lolemnity than ever, having received
luch repeated signals of the divine savour, in
"my deliverance, preservation and prosperity.
I now wanted for nothing, and yet my
mind was still intent upon my deliverance;
'and in truth, I had a strong impression upon
. me that I should not be another year in this
island ; hut I still continued my husbmdry,
and made the necessary preparations for my
future subsistence. The rain season coming
on, we were forced to continue for the most
part within doois, having first made all
necessary preparation for the security at d
safety of my new boat, till the months
November and December, at which time I
fully determined ni fail over to the Con iaent.
And no sooner did it begin to draw tirar, but
I began to make preparations for my intend-
ed expedition, and in a fortnight's t'me, I
proposed to oper^my little deck, and let out
the boat for that purpose.

One morning, at I was bo fy in making pre-
parations for my voyage, Friday whom I had
sent to the seaside to look for a turtle, came
running ip a terrible fright : lays he, I have
bad news: Tondtr art tbrtt or four canots up-
on the coast, and they corns to look for poor Fri-
day ana vi'll tat you as well as mt; and there-
ft SOB I N SON
Says Friday, trembling, mt will fight as well
as lean t but 1 am afraid they art too many
fir us; but 1 visit obey your orders, and loft
the loft drop as my blood for you.
Without father disputes, we fell to loading
our arms, and making every thing ready for
the onset: When we had double loaded
them, and put every thing in the best posture
that could be, I took my prospective glass*
and vent up to the top of a hill, to try what
I could discover ; and I soon perceived there
were nineteen lavages and three prisoners,
which I concluded, by their manner of act-
ing, were to be devoured.
This dii'mal and inhuman spectacle silled
me with the utmost horror and detestation,
and the more so, as I saw a white man, who
by their actions and preparations, I found
was to be the next sacrifice. This made me
snake all the speed I could, having fully de-
termined to deliver him or perish in the at-
tempt ; so I gave Friday orders to follow
me, and to do every thing he saw me do.
When we came to a proper distance undis-
covered, I gave the word to Friday to tue,
as I did the very fame moment. We took
our aim so well, that between us, we' killed
four, and wounded three or four more.—
No man can imagine the consternation and
confusion these savages were in upon this
unexpected accident: However, not to give
them any respite we look up some other
arms, and let fly a second time, killed two
more, and wounded several others, which
added so to their confusion, that they ran
yelling and howling about like mad creatures.
Friday (said I) take a charged mujkst and fol-
low me ; So, shewing ourselves to them, and
at the same time giving a great shout, we
went directly to the victim, and immediately
cut the bands from his hands and legs, and
. lifting him up, I asked him, in theiPortuguese
language, what he was : He told me, in Lat'
in, he was a Spaniard and a Christian; and
after returning the best acknowledgments he
could for his deliverance, he was about to
give an account of bis misfortunes, but t
prevented him, telling him, That -would be bet-
ttr at another time t and further said,
Signior, tut will talk afterwards, but now
tur business is fighting. I gave him a dram
and a piece of bread to refresh him, and then
gave him a sword and pistol, and bade him
do what he could; and to give the man his
due, no one could behave himself with great-
er courage. In short, we so managed the
matter, that of twenty two savages, not above
three or four got into one of their canoes, &
those I resolved to destroy too if possible;
accordingly, I leaped into one of their ca-
noes, and ordered Friday to follow me; but
1 was no sooner got in, than I saw another
. poor creature bound hand and foot (or the
slaughter. I presently helped him up, but
he was so faint and weak, that he could nei-
ther stand nor speak, but groaned sadly,
thinking he wa> now to be sacrificed. I bade
Friday speak to him, and assure him of de-
liverance. , When he was a little recovered,
and sat up in the boat, and had looked up-
on him more fully, you cannot imagine the
poor fellow's transport •- at length, when he
had a little recovered himself,he told me it was
his sather; and in truth, he gave such un-
common testimonies of his duty and affection,
that I must needs own I was very much af-
fected, with it.
In short, with a . great deal of dissiculty,
we got both my new guests home to my cat-
tle, whence I made them a handsome tent,
and treated them in the best manner! mj cir-
cumstances would allow.
And thus, like an absolute King, I govern-
ed my little dominions; and, finding that my
new subjects were very weak, I ordered :Fri>
Jay to kill one of my kids, and stewed and
boiled the flelh. and made them some very
good broth, and dined with them myself,.—
v,After dinner, I ordered Friday to go to the
field pf battle, and fetch home the arms;
and then I bade Friday asle his sather whether
he thought it possible for the savages to out-
side the storm, or if they got home, whether
he thought they would not return in great
numbers, and endeavour to destroy us. His
answer was, that it they did reach their own
country, which he hardly thought possible,
yet the strati gene ss of their being attacked
would certainly make them tell the people
that tbey were destroyed by thunder and
lightning! and that whoever went into the
island would certainly be destroyed by the
bands of the God?, and not of men ; and that
the island was enchanted ; andthat the Godt
sent fire from above to destroy all those that
should presume to land in it.
This account having freed me from my
apprehensions, and no canoes appearing, I
resolved to pursue my intended voyage, Fri-
day'i. father having assured me that 1 might
depend upon good usage from the people of
- his country. As to the Spaniard, Iisked
him his opinion; he to'd me they were four-
teen that were cast away upon the island,
aad that they had a good understanding with
the Indians, but were in want of necessaries
for the support of human life; and that if
I thought proper, he and the old savage
would go over first, and settle matters, in
order for our reception ; and at the same
time he told me, thty would all'swear fidelity
to me, and own me as their leader.
Upon these assurances, I resolved to fend
them over; but; wli-:n every thing was rea-
dy, the Spaniard started this material objec-
tion : You know, Sir, said he, 1 know the length
of your flock, and though you miy hive enough
for vs that are now with you, yet, when you
enlarge your family, 1 am ferftble it cannot be
sufficient lo support us iorig, and thsre/oremy
advice it, to wait another harvest, and in tht
mean time prepare as much ground as possible,
j6 ROBINS 0 .19
vihtrtby tut may have provisions sufficient tt
tarry on our design. This advice I liked ex-
tremely, and from that moment I always es-
teemed the Spaniard and made him my privy
counsellor on all occasions.
We all four went to work*, and prepared
as much ground as would sow twenty two
bushels of barley and sixteen of rice, which
was all the feed we had to spare: And at the
same time I took all the care imaginable to
increase and preserve my goats by shooting
the wild dams, and taking the young kids,
{tutting them into the enclosures, and took
uch measures, that, by the blessing of God,
and our industry, after harvest, we bad pro-
visions to victual a ship for any part of Ame-
rica.
The principle occasion being thus answer-
ed, I gave my two ambassadors a musket each*
s with charges of powder and ball; with pro-
visions fit for the expedition, and away I
sent them \ they had not been gone a fort-
night, but I began to be impatient for their
return. Whilst my thoughts were perpetu-
ally taken up with the expectation of them,
a very strange accident happened, which was
first discovered by my man Friday who one
morning came running unto me, crying out,
they are come, they are erne. Upon which I
jumped from my bed, and looked towards
the sea. I perceived a boat about a league
and a half distance, standing directly in for
the shore. I soon found that these were
none of the company, that I cxpe&ed; for
by the help of my glass, I found .that this
had been so honestly managed in my absence,
-that beyond my expectation, I found myself
worth 4000 1. sterling; with which, as soon
as possible, I resolved to make the best of my
way to England 4 and by the advice of the
Captain, I was persuaded to go by land,
which had Jike to have proved fatal to me
and aH that were in my company; for the
snow's being sallen, the wolves and bears
were driven out of the woods, and though
there were more than 20 of us together, they
set upon us many times, and indeed, it was
not without the greatest hazard and dissiculty
we preserved ourselves from being devoured,
the partiular relation of which would be too
long to trouble the reader with.
In cur sarther passage, through France,
we met with nothing uncommon or remark*
able ; we got safe to Paris, and after a short
stay there, went to Calais and landed at Dover
the 14'h of January in a very cold season.
When I came to London, I found my bills
of exchange all arrived, and the money ready
to be paid at light, which when I had receiv-
ed, it tame into my mind to return to Lisbon,
and from theoce to the Brasils, to look after
my plantation; but upon second thoughts,
1 concluded it best to fell it, and on this ac-
count I thought it proper to write to my cor-,
fpondent at Lisbon, and desire his advice and
assistance, who readily gave me his promise
to do all he could for me; and in truth as I
afterwards found he acquitted himself to me
in every particular with the greatest justice
and integrity.
In short, he sold my estate for me to the
best advantage, aod remitted to the for it
bilis for three hundred and twenty pieces of
eight, a sum much greater than I expected.
And now I began to think it high time to
settle myself, providence having made such a
plentiful provision for. me that I wanted no-
thing to make myself at happy as I could
wish.
Having cast my anchor, and for the pre-
sent bid adieu to all foreign adventures, I
had no other care or concern upon me but
the education of my brother's two sons. One
of them I bred a Gentleman, and the other
I bred an able sailor; and soon afterwards I
married a virtuous young gentlewoman, of
a good family, by whom I bad two sons and
a daughter; but^ she dying, I grew discon-
solate and melancholy, and at the instiga-
tion of rrjr nephew, resolved I would once
more make a voyage to the Eastindiet, which
I did in the year 1689, and in my passage
visited my Island. A. full and particular ac-
count of which I intend shall be tbc subject
of the subsequent parts of my narrative.
FURTHER ADVENTURES
O F
ROBINSON CRU30E.
Containing a full account as his travels and
remarkable transactions, both by sea and land.
MY new kingdom ran continually in my
mind and took up my thoughts day
and' night, insomuch that my wife took no-
tice of it, and would often ask me the reason
of my extraordinary thought fulness, suppos-
ing my marriage with her might be the cause.
Her tender and endearing expressions, to-
gether with the concern I had for the preser-
vation of my samily at length brought me to
a resolution to settle myself in some fixed way
of living; accordingly, I bought a little sarm
in Bedfordshire, and soon provided me a
.stock with all other implements fit to manage
it to the best advantage. In this rural retire-
ment I began to think myself as happy as I
could wish, when on a sudden, all my hap-
piness was destroyed by the unexpected death
of my wife.
Her death gave me a sort of contempt of
the world, and filled me full of different
thoughts and inclinations. My country life
grew burtbensome to me: and in short, I
left my sarm, left off•house keeping, and in
a few months after, returned to London;
9'
but there I conld find nothing to entertain
me and divert my melancholy. It was. the
begining of the year 1693, when my nephew,
whom I had bred up to the sea, was returned
from his voyage, Captain of the ship he went
out in; who earning to me one , morning,
told me, it was proposed to him by some
merchants to make a voyage to the Eastindies
and if I would go, he would undertake to
iand me upon my island, that I might have
an opportunity to enquire into the state of
my new kingdom.
Just before he came to me, it came into my .
thoughts to get a patent, and fill my Island
with inhabitants; What devil, said I, sent you
hither -with this meffage? And though I
liked the motion, yet I would not let him
know k at first -, however, after a little pause,
I told him if he would set me down and call
for me at his return, I would certainly go
with him. As to -calling for me as he came
back he told me it was impracticable. But
said he, / will tell you what we can do 1 tut
may have a /loop ready framed on board, which
we may easily put together at any time, and
you may return at your pleasure.
I was not long*in forming my resolutions,
but contrary to the advice of all my friends,
I fully determined to undertake the voyage;
and, in order to it, I made my Will, and put
all my affairs in the best posture I could
possibly, and so with my trusty servant Friday
in the beginning oi January, 1694,1 went on
board, and took with me several artificers,
with a good cargoe, for the better stocking
of my island.
We bad Dot been long out at sea, but we
were overtaken by a storm, which drov: us
upon the coast of Ireland, as sar as Gal way,
where we were obliged to stay twenty days
for a wind. On the 5th of February, the
wind presented, aed we bad a very good
gale for several days. On the 20th in the
evening, the mate called out, that he (aw a
flash of fire, and heard a gun ; upon which
we all ran to the quarter deck, from whence,
at a distance we law a tenible fire, which,
from our reckoning, we concluded cou'd be
no other than a ship that had taken fire at
sea, and that it could not be sar effby there-
port of the gun, which we heard several
timrs. We made to it with all our sail, and
1 >od perceived it was a great ship burnieg in.
the middle of the sea; I immediately order-
ed five guns to be fired, that the poor peo-
ple might perceive that there was deliverenee
at haed, who consequently might risk their
lives in their boats; nor was it long before
the ship blew up.
We hung out our lanthorns, and about
eight in the morning, when it began to be
light, we saw two boats making towards us,
and we made a signal for them to come on
board and took them all Up, being men, wo-
men and children, in all sixty four. It was
a French ship of 300 tons, bound from Ca-
nada, and by the negligecce of the steersman
it was set on fire in the steerage; so that
in all probability; if providence had not sent
ut to their assistance, they bad every soul pe-
rished.
Never were people, certainly (o overjoyed
as these poor creatures were. Among the
passengers there were two priests, au old one
and a young one \ the old one was a stupid
fellow, but the young one was a very modest
fine gentleman. After their surprize was
pretty well over,and they had been refreshed
in the best manner our ship would allow, the
captain and one of the priests desired to speak
with me, and offered us the money and jew-
els they had saved, which I refused, telling
them, our business was to save them, and not
so plunder them. They told us, what they
had to desire of us was, to set them on shore
some where in our passage. As to landing,
- we told ihem, that being bound to the East-
indies, we could not do that without chang-
ing our com fe, and that we could not justi-
fy ; but we would carry them till we met
w<th a ship bound either to England or
France, that would take tbem on board;
however, our provisiors beginning to tall
short, we resolved to land them at Newfound-
land, which was not much out ot our way:
and accordingly, as we proposed, in about a
week's time we came to the banks of New-
foundland, where they hired a bark to carry
them to France, all but the young priest and
two or three of the sailors, who chose to go
with us.
Now directing our course to the S. S. E.
about twenty days after we met with another
adventure, that gave us a fresh opportunity
to exercise our humanity. lo latitude of 27,
we saw a sail bearing towards us that had lost
all her masts, & firing a gun in token of distress*
the wind being N we sooo came up to speak
to her, and found her to he a (hip or Bustol,
bound home from Barbadoes, that had been
driven out of the road by a furious hurri-
cane. They had been tested about for seve-
ral days, and were almost starved for want of
provisions, having eaten nothing for eleven
days.
In this ship were three passengers, a gen-
tlewoman, her ion and a maid servant; these
we found in a most miserable condition that
can be imagined. The woman died, and it
was with the greatest difficulty that ve pre-
served the young .man and maid, whom, at
their intreaty, after we had supplied the ship
with what we could spare, we took on board
our own ship. We were now in latitude
its; but pasting by some little incidents, I
ihall relate what is most remarkable relating
to roy little kingdom, to which I was now
drawing nigh. It was with no smalt trouble
that we got to the south side of my island;
however, at last we came to an anchor at the
mouth of the little creek, and then I soon
saw my old castle, and knew perfectly where
I was.
When I was certain of the place, I called
to Friday, and aiked him if he koew where
be was? But when be looked a little, he
clapped his hands, crying, 0 joy 1.0 thtrt!
0 yes ! 0 there! Me set! Me fee! There much
Men ! and there.' and fell to jumping and
dancing ss if he were mad.
Whs n the English antient was spread, and
we had fired three guns, to let them know
.we were friends, I hung cur the white Sag,
and so wiih the young priest, and my man
Fiiday, I went on shore. And who should
be the fiist man I saw, hut the Spaniard,
whose lire I had saved ; and Friday, who saw
bit father at a distance, rao to him wiih all
the joy imaginable, and embraced him with
extreme tenderness.
I< was the loth of April that I set my soot
on share the second time, when my faithful
Spaniard, accompanied by one more, came
Up to me ; he did not know me at first; hot
when I had hinted to him wbo I was, no man
could express or behave himself wi ll greater
grati ude. He took me by the hand, and
afk:d me if I would not go and take posses-
sion of my old habitation, where I found
they had made considerable improvements. I
ask.d him several questions, and he a: readily
answered me, telling me withal what strange
confusion they had with the Englishmen, who
designed to have murdered them : While we
were talking, the mao whom he had sent re-
turned with eleven more. These, said he, are
some of those that owe their lives to your
goodness. And after he had made them sen-
sible who I was, they all saluted me in a very
grateful and handsome manner.
Before I relate what happened in the isl-
and, as it was related by the Spaniard, my
G vernor, 1 must not omit a stoiy which I
omitted in my former narrative. Just before-
we weighed anchor, there happened a quar-
rel on board, which by the care of the cap-
taiu, was timely prevented, though not with-
out some dissiculty ; and indeed, so sar it
proceeded, that two fellows, that had been
the ring leaders, found means in the night,
to get some arms, and the sliip's boat, and
got away to the island, and joined their bro-
ther rogues; so that now there were five En-
glish in (he island, which, as the Spaniard re-
po ts id the following narration, was the
cause of great disorder and confusion amongst
them.
The Spaniard's relation of what happened in
the I/land, from my departure till my second
landing.
YOU may remember, Sir, you sent me on
a voyage ; and indeed, I was not a lit-
surprized to fidd, at my return, that you had
left u*. We had a veiy good piflagr ; and
indeed, my couotrymen were overjoyed to
fiod I had so miraculously escaped; and
when I had shewed the arms and ammunition
which 1 had brought, they were transported
to the highest degree. After a little stay, we
got what we could from the iavag-j, made
bold wiih two of their canoes, and lo came
all of us over to the island ; where we had no
sooner landed, but we found the Englishmen
. had quarrelled with one another, and had
attempted to murder and destroy tbeir fel-
lows, and were oftenveiy near putting their
wicked practices in execution.
One day It happened, that as two of my
: Spaniards were in the woods, one of the lo-
H a

ROBINSON
bereft of the Englishmen came up to them,
and made heavy complaints how cruelly they
were used by their countrymen, and that if
we did not take them under our protection
and give them assistance, they must inevita-
bly be starved and undone. When they came
to supper, one of the Spaniard*, in a gentle
the mutinous Englishmen :that it was a great
pity their countrymen should perish, and
therefore intreated them to suffer their
countrymen to procure their subsistence with-
out farther disturbance; to which they re-
plied, let them starve and It damn'd for the ist-
land is ours, and if they -will not work for us,
they Jball have no share in it. Come Jack (said
Atkins) who shall dare to build in our domini-
ens without our consent? And as we after-
wards found out, they had certainly murder-
ed them, if they had not been prevented
However, they pulled down their huts, and
did them all the damage thty possibly could.
When they had done this villany, they came
hack to the castle, boasting of what they had
done; when one taking hold of a Spaniard's
hat, twirled it round, faying, and you, Signi-
or Jack Spaniard, shall have the fame fauct, if
you do not mend your manners. This quarrel
in a short time grew so high, that if we had
not timely interposed and taken away their
arms, in all probability there had been mur-
der.
These wicked fellows, perceiving that they
had made all of us their enemies, brgan to
relent, and to beg for their arms, but this

manner, began to reprimand
we positively refused, which made them so
mad and desperate, that they left us in the
greatest passion imagioable. They were
hardly gone but their two countrymen came
to us with their complain's, telling us they
were ruined { and truly sir, we could not
help thinking it very hard, that nineteen of
us should, from time to time, be bullied and
insulted by three such notorious villains.
It was with some dissiculty we persuaded
their two countrymen from pursuing and
killing them with their fire arms,-but upon
our promising that they should have justice
done them, they desisted. About five days
after, being almost starved, they came to us
in a very submissive manner, and begged
heartily to have their arms restored, which
upon certain conditions we at last granted.
But so great was their villainy, that there
had not p st above three days, hut they be-
gan their otd trade again.
And cow it was that an accident happen-
ed, that not only obliged us to lay aside all
private animosities, but likewile to provide
for our mutual security.
One night, as I lay in my bed, I was dis-
turbed with unusual fears and apprehensions,
i got up, and related the matter to one
of my Spanish friends, who answered, such
hints were not to be flighted ,- and advised me
to look out carefully ; adding thxt certainly
there was some mijchief upon the stocks. Ac-
cordingly, we w^Qt up to the top of the
mountain,.where we discovered a light, and
heard the voices of several men, which terri-
Red us exceedingly. We could net tell what
to conjecture, and therefore sent out old Fri-
day as a spy, to try if be could learn who,
aod from whence they were; he returned
in a very short time, and brought us word, -
that they were two different parties, of differ-
ent nation!; and that after a bloody battle, they
bad landed there by mere chance, in order to dc
vour their prisoners; and that he believed as
scon as it was light, a blociy battle would en-
sue. Oid Friday had hardly ended his rela-
tion, but an unusual noise gave us to under-
stand that the engagement was begun ; and
nothing could be more bloody and obstinate,
nor men of more invincible spirits, nor more
active and ready in (heir way of fighting.
We were undoubtedly, fir, in a great con-
sternation, lest they should run into our
grove, and destroy what we had, and so re-
solved to put ou selves upon our defence,
and shoot the fi st that should approach;
and as we appreheuded, so it happened; for
three of the army that was vanquished, came
directly *o the place for sh her ; But these I
wou'd not suffer to be slain, but had them
furpriz:d and taken alive : and in truth,
they all proved veiy excellent servants, and
were of great use to ut afterwards. The two
.parties being gone - fif, and the coast clear,
we went to the.p'ace of battle, where we
found two and thirty dead upon the spot,
with several bows and arrows, and other sons
ot weapons, which, I.ordered to be carefully
picked up and carried into our armou y.
-This-dismal .spectacle had that effect upon
the three troublesome Englishmen, that much
of their tuibulent temper begin to abate,
and they brgan to be good friends, and to
think unanimously what was best to be done
for our mutual Itcurity and preservation.—
And, accordingly, all hands were at work to
strengthen the fortifications of our Castle,
add provide a proper security for all our pro-
visi jm; and indeed,' we did both with all
thec<ution that the-natu'e of our circum-
stances would allow. And (bus for two yean
we lived in a very comfortable retirement,
having neit her seen or heard a^y thing of the
Savages for all thartimr.
But now there happened another quarrel,
which might have proved of very bad conse-
quence, if ft had not been prevented in time.
The three wicked Eng'ishmen being the ag-
gressors, I ordered them to be disarmed, and
left the case to be determined by the other
two Eng'ish.nen, who sentenced them to be
haoged, alledging, among other things, that
they had a design to murder us, and only
deferred it till a proper opportunity i upon
which I asked Atkins, who was the ling lea-
der, what we had done to them to desei v; to
be murdered, or what he had to say fo, him-
self, why ws should not immediately kill him,
who had formed such a villainous d-sigo to
murder ut ? In truth, the Englishmen press-
ed ve,y hard to bang one of them for an ex-
ample to the others ; but this I would by no
means c< nsent to, upon the consideration
that ! owed my life to an Englishman, to
you sir, my only preserver; however, to put
it out of their power to do us any farther
mischief, we determined, that for the future,
they should have oo arms of any fort ; and
that if they did again attempt to give the So-
ciety any manner of disturbance, then we
would immediately shoot them like wild beasts.
After this I ordered them some provision for
their present subsistence, and appointed them
a place in a remote part of the island, where
they might plant and make what improve-
ments they thought proper.
They had lived six months in this separate
station, and had got. in their first harvest;
which, (hat season, was but very small, as
they were naturally net only very idle, but
had every thing to begin anew, and what was
worse, were but very indifferent workmen at
the best. These fellows growing desperate
***and weary of working, took a new whim into
their heads, which might have been of satal
^.consequence. Nothing would serve them,
but they must needs make a voyage to the
continent, to try if they could seize some of
those Savages, and make them slaves to do
their drudgery; and indeed the project was
not so preposterous, if they had not been ac-
tuated by wicked notions and designs-
One morning they came to their limits, de-
siring to speak with us; which being granted
they told us they were tired of that state of
life, and if we would give them one of bur
canoes, they would go and seek their fortunes
abruad, and never trouble us more. You
may be sure, sir, we were not a little glad to
-be freed from such troublesome companions l
however, we represented the danger of it;
but finding nothing would change their Re-
solution, we consented th:y should have one
ot our canoes, and at the same time gave
them some fire arm*, ammunition and pro-
vision; and as soon as they had fined out
their boat, they merrily sailed away, the Span-
iards at the lame time catling after them and
wishing them a good voyage. And in truth,
nothing could be farther from our thoughts,
than the possibility of seeing them any more;
yet scarcely a month had passed, but one of
our Englishmen, being abroad at work, saw
three men well armed coming towards him;
upon which, away he flies to bring-us intelli-
gence, telling ut, w were all undone, for then
wre men upon the iflmd that -were not Sav
ages! While we were considering the event,
up came the three Englishmen, whonT- we
presently knew by their voices; and, then our
wonder ceased. Our next enquiry wafc+oto
the nature and manner of their voyage, and
the reason of their so speedy return ; of al!
which one of them gave the following relation:
After two dayj sail, we reached land; but
finding the inhabitants savages, and coming
with their bows aad arrows to give us an un-
welcome reception, we thought it proper to
make the best of our way steering northward.
In our passage we discovered several little
islands which seemed to be inhabited; at one
of which we resolved to go on shore at all haz-
ards; which accordingly we did, at one that lay
most to the weft ; here we found the natives
very courteous to us, giving us what they
could procure. ArmDg these hospitable in- .
diaus we staid several days, enquiring by sign*
what nations lay near them, and were inform-
ed (hat there were several Nations that lay
nigh to them, that were accustomed to eat
mankind, but for their parts, tjjey were not
accustomed to eat such sort of diet, except
such as they took in battle. We enquired
how lorg it was since they had had a battle,
and whether they had any prisoners ; to
which they made answer, by their signs that
that it was about two months, and their King
had now .two hundred prisoners, which he
reserved for the slaughter. Mighty desirous
we were to fee those piisooers ; which they
mistook, and thought we wanted some for
cur own use, and made signs, that at the next,
rising of the Sun, we should have some ; and
accordingly, at the veiy time, they brought
us eleven men and five women, just as cows
and oxen are brought to a sea port town ; a
sight that gave ut all a great deal of horror,
and what to do we ccu!d not tell ; to refuse
them we knew would be an unpardonable
aff.ont, and to dispose of th:m we knew not
how. However, we resolved to accept of
them, and gave them io return a few fishes,
that we had in the canoe; so taking our
leave, we sailed to the next island, where we
set eight of the men at liberty ; with the rest
we made the best of our way to our island;
and though we treated them all as well as we
could, we could by no means convince them,
but that they were to be killed and devoured.
Thus, Sir, ended she nairative of these
97
three desperadoes; whereupon I asked him
where their new family was, chusing to fee
them; they told me, they were at their bub;
so we all went to fee them.
When we came to the huts, we found three
well proportioned men, and stye women, all
naked & bound, four of them might be from -
twenty four to forty, bnt the other wm a
comely Maiden .of about seventeen; they
were all very agreeable, and their behaviour
seemed to be very modest. Their naked ap-
pearance, with the misery of their Condition,
was no Very agreeable sight. .
But now, Sir. having Women among ot,
which I thought might sometimes occasion
Quarrel*, I asked the three Englishmen how.
they proposed to dispose of their samilies;
adding, that 1 was toot going to lay any r«-
ffraint on them ; only I would desire, that
would each take one; and, after they
chosen which they had a mind to, no
other man should presume to ;ouch her.—
Well to this they all agreed ; and so they
concluded to draw lots for the choice.
And now, Sir, I jay before you a scene
quite different from any thing that hat been
related. One morning, Tery early, there'
came five canoes of Indians on shore, on
their old account of devouring their prison- -
ert ; all that we could do was to lie conceal-
ed till their bloody ceremony was over, and
to take proper measures to defend ourselves
in caieot need. But, notwithstanding all
our cautions, there happened an unhappy
disaster, that had like to have occasioned the

^8 R OrB 1 N.S 0 M.
utter desolation of the island; for, after the
savages^were gone off, my Spaniards and 1
lookicgout to nuke observations, we found
three savages that had gorged themselves
lying fast asleep upon the gr'ouod.
What to do with them we could nut tell;
to murder them ^we 'thought would not be
justifiable according to the Jaw of Christiani-
ty!, haviog no,previpusr quarrel ,w"^h them;
at last we thought it advileable to secure
them alive, and set them about some work
or other, till we could dispose of them ; and
according'y we took them prisoners, and car-
red them first to cur castle, and then to
the two English, who soon found them em-
ployment; but for waut of keeping a strict
guard over them, one of them got awaj into
the woods, and was hot heard of for some
time.
This unlucky accident gave,us great ap-
preheBstpns thati.bylf^raejw'ay or other, fbjp: ,

weak we were, and consequently that thc^
would come over ati:i destroy ui all ) nor in-
deed were our notions 111 grounded ; for, in
eight months .after, there came .fix canoes,-,
with ten men in each, and landed within less
than a mile of the Englishman's habitation,
who, with the greatest terror imaginable, let
their tnilch goats loose iato the woods; and
ran to their secret cave, resolving to defend
th;m(:lve» till we could come to th,eir*sfist-
ance. i
It was not long before *hej could lee the*

habitations in flames, and the savages In pur-
suit of them in several small parties ; upon
which they took their' stand at a convenient
place, aud determined to defend themselves
to the vers last cxti emity.
While they were thus expecting them, the
savages came on $ one of them was the run-
away, who had been the cause,of this mis-
chief-, and he. they resolved should be the
first that suffered, let What would be the con-
sequence ; and accordingly, as was contus-
ed, the first let fly, and indeed he took his
aim to well that he killed the foremost out-
right, shot the run-away through the body,
and wounded the third.
-Sad and dreadful was the out cry the
wounded Indians made, beirg qui'e insensible
from whence their sudden destruction came,
and as we were informed, believed that they
were destroyed by thunder and lightning,
having never before heard or seen any thing
like a gun. Whilst they Were in this con-
. »n, kic m mis con-
sternation, the Englishman had time to new
load their guns, and, filing both together up-
on another party of five, who were standing
by the two they bad wounded, they fell to
the ground as if they had been killed; upon
which the two Englishmen went to them,
without charging their guns, which was a
very wrong step; for, when they were coane
upj they found tour of them alive, two slight-
ly wounded,-" and one hot at all. Upon
which they were forced to take the bu't ends
of their «"-» *-
ot thesr -mufe-is, and knock them on
Midf*»4 took him that w„l cot aoui
cd
and bound him it the foot of i tree hard by,
and th. n made all the haste they could to-
wards the cave to ice if all was well there |
and, finding every thing (afe, they came back
to the tree where they left the Indian bound,
•nd found, to their great fui prise, he wat
gone. Now they were in greater fear and
confusion than before.; but while they were
eocGderir g what was proper to do, seven.'
Spaniards came up to them, bringing with
them that very Indian the Englishmen had
left bound under the tree, whom' the Span-
iards had released in their way.
This great reinforcement so much encou-
raged the two Englishmen, and so g eat wa*
their indignation tor the loss ot their huts,
that they could stay no longer ; but taking
the Spaniards with them, all well armed,
away they went in pursuit of the rest of the
savages ;but, from a rising ground they per-
ceived that they were got on board of their
canoes, and were gone out to sea, too sar to
be come at, which gave them a new matter
for fear and apprehension, left they should
go horn* directly, and inform their brethrea
ot all that had happened, and incite them to
come over with greater power, and destroy
the whole island. And as we Judged, so it
"happened ; for in less than seven months,
they came over with twenty five canoes, and
landed upon us with two hundred and fifty
men, all well armed with bows and arrows,
and other formidable weapons.
You may imagine, Sir, we were in no
small consternation, upon the approach of
these unwelcome guests; nor were we want-
ing to make the best preparation We could
to defend ourselves; we armed our saithful
slaves in the best manner we could, nor
would our women be persuaded from fight-
ing along with us, as they reiotied to con-
quer or die with their husbands, whom they
now loved with the greatest tenderness and
passion.
Of this little army I was commander in
chief; and Will. Atkins, whom I knew to be
a fellow of invincible courage, I appointed
for my Lieut. General, & gave him six choice
men, well armed, to command as a sepa-
rate body. In a short time the fight began
on Atkim' quarter, who ordered his Men to
fire into the thickest of them. Never were
creatures in greater terror and consternation,
as imagining their destruction to come from
the Gods; and if Atkins had obeyed my or-
ders, and retreated unperceived, they had fled
to their canoes, without any farther attempt;
but feeing him and bis small party, they
came on again with the greatest fury.
Id short, we were forced to interpose with
our whole body, to save Atkins aod bis par-
ty, who was pressed very hard, and had one
of the Englishmen killed by his side, and was
himself wounded. We gave three volleys,
but they were grown lo desperate that not-
withstanding our "fire, they came up in the
very teeth of us, -insomuch that we were
forced to retire, and in truth, I must own,
that, if night hid not given ut a little respite,
we must h5"- been in a great deal of 4»Dgct,
As soon u possible I drew my little army
upon a rising ground, where, 'by the light of
the ftloop, We could observe the savages in a
great deal of disorder; upon which we con-
cluded it would be best to sall upon them
now', and, \( possible, to give them a volley
undiscovered ; which we did, by the guidance
of she two Englishmen, who knew the ground
perfectly \ after'this we gave them three vol-
lies more, and then rushed in upon them, with
our swords with such irresistible fury, that
they gave way, and, making a dismal scream-
ing and howling, they betook themselves to
their heels. Many of them were killed in
the flight but indeed we were so exceedingly
tired with fighting these two battles, that we
did not then pursue them to their canoes, in
which we concluded that they would imme-
diately get to sea; but there happening a
dreadful storm, they were prevented in that,
and many of their canoes were lost into the
bargain.
After we had taken some refreshment,
and a little repose, we resolved, as loon as it
was light, to go to the place of battle, in or-
der to make what observations we could;
and coming at length to a full view of the
remainder of their army, we found them ly-
ing in a miserable posture ; and when we
came within musket shot, I ordered two gunt
to bv fired, in order to try if they had any
notion- of coming to another engagement;
and the project answered so fstectually, that
they;no sooner heard the report of the first


astonishiog manner, rap away inU> the moun-
tains. Tnough I confess I had much rather
.the weather would have suffered them to have
gone off, without giving us farther trouble;
for now the cafe was, what must be done
with this great number of savage creatures,,
Great were our debates on this point, howe-
ver, after mature copsideratioq, if was deter-
mined to destroy their canoes ;. which when
the Indians saw, they made the most hideous
out cries; but to no pu.rp.qfe, for we either
burnt or disabled them all, after, which (hey
rap about a long time, apd, as they had no
arms, nor materials to mace any, so, notwith-
standing 'heir numbers, we were the less ap-
prehensive of being surprised hy them.
Indeed our stock pf provisions was so very
small, that we came to a resolution to dtive
them up into some remote coiner of the isl-
and, and to kill as many of them as we cculd
catch, in order to lessen their number, and
then give them some corn to plant. Pursu-
ant to this resolution, we pursued them with
our gurs, killing every day one or more, till
at lengh their number was so reduced; that
we concluded, if possible, to take one ot them
alive, which at last, with some dissiculty we
effected; and using him kindly, we brought
him to old Fiiday, who told him if they
would submit and do what they were com-
manded, they fhiuld be used well, otherwise
they fh mid all be shin, & bid him go and as-
sure his companions so, who were in a most
miserable starving condition.
The poor creatures, who were now reduced
i»4 t-. ROBINS O N 'ssa*
to thirty {even, received this offer with sfll
the joy imaginable, lo we sent them some
fooJ, which they ate with great thanktal-
Dcs», and made all the promises we could de-
fire, and to give them their due, they have
never broke any of them to this day. / ',
And thus, Sir, according to the best of my*
ability, I have given you an account of what
is material, that has happened in the isliod
since your departure, to this day; by which
you may perceive the wonderful works of
providence.'
When you infpect into the island, you will
find it something improved in general, your
eorn and flocks increased, and the number
of your subjects so sar augmented, that from a
desolate isliod, as it was before y >ur deliver-
ance, here is a prospect, with a little industry
and good management, that it may at length
'become a populous and plentiful little king-
dom.

O u/oe.
THERE i* oo doubt to be made but that
the Spaniard gave me a faithful ac-
count, which wat exceedingly agreeable to
me, and do left surprising to the young priest
and 10 all the rest who heard it : nor were
these people less pleased with be necessaries
I. bfougbt thtm, which were a great help to
them in perfecting their habitation. Will.
Atkins wat grown a very sober man, and
had built his hut with great ingenuity. The
Englishmen's wives were ail fruitful enough,
ana bore each a child once a year.
When I enquired of the Spaniard con-
corning their manner of living among the
savages, they gave me a very deplorable rela-
tion ot it, adding that they bad hardly any
hopes of support or deliverance.
. Many were the methods they took to in-
struct the savages, but to no purpose 5 for
they, ignorant as, they were, would give no
ear to the instructions of those to whom they
owed their lives. At the return of their
friend, who they thought had been devour-
ed, their joy was great, especially when they
saw the loaves of bread which I sent them;
bat when they heard the errand, and per-
ceived the boat, their transports were inex-
pressible* This was the account I had from
them, and now it follows that I should in.

As to the sharing out the land, I left it to
Will. Atkins, who discharged his trust with;
great fidelity. As »o their lawt and govern-
ment, I advised them earnestly te love one
another, and to make what sarther By laws
they should think proper for their general
good and benefit.
Thus having disposed every thing in the
island in the best manner possible and given
the people assurance that I would always have
them to my thoughts, and would be sure to
fend them sufficient supplies, at often as I
bad an opportunity. On the first of May,
1695, I set sail for the Brasib, but the next
day was becalmed; and looking towards the
H. N. £. of the island, we could perceive
something out at sea looking very black, up-
on which the mate going up the shrouds, and
taking a view with a prospective glass, he cri-
ed out, It was an army i An army, you fool,
(aid I, what do you mean? Nay Sir, said he,
do not be aogry; for I assure you. it is not
only an army, but a fleet too; for I believe
there are a thousand canoes making towards
us with all speed. As they came nearer to-
wards ut, they seemed to be very much sur-
prised at the fight of our ship, not knowing
what to make of us: aad we being unwilling
they should come too near, made signs to
them to keep off, which they did ; but as
they retired, (bey let fly several

lo a tittle* time th«y had the courage to
come so near us, that they could hear us
speak; upon which 1 ordered Friday ro call
to them, to know what they would have l
whereupon they poured a whole cloud of
arrows upon him, several of which went
quite through his bddy 5 and so I loft my
faithful servant and most affectionate com-
panion in all my afHictons and solitude. I
was so enraged at the death of poor Friday,
that I ordered the gnnner to load with small
K

shot, and immediately give them a broad side.;
which he did so effectually, that thirteen or
fourteen of their canoes were overset, and
the rest lo flighted, that away they flew with
all the speed they could.
Soon after, we took up one poor wretch,
as he was swimming for his life; who let us
know that they were going with their kings
to fight a great battle; and when we asked
him what made them come to us and shoot
at us ? He answered, to makt dt gnat Wonder
look.
Poor Friday was buried with a\l the pomp
and decency our circumstances would allow:
And now, having a fair wind, we made the
best of pur way to the BrasiJs.—We stopped
at AU Saints, and having fitted out a vessel
with Provisions for my island, set sail for the
Eastindies. We made directly for the Cape
of Good Hope, and thence for the coast of
CoromandeU The first place we touched at
was the island of Madagascar; where though
the people are firce and treacherous, yet for
some time they treated us well, and gave us
commodities; and indeed they traded with
us with so much civility, that some ef the
men rosolved one night to stay on shore to a
tent, which they had made for that purpose.
About two o'clock in the morning, we
were alarmed with the firing of guns, and
our men's crying for help, or they should be
murdered.
The occasion of this fray, as we afterwards
understood from them that escaped, was this.
An old woman, that fold milk, brought with
her a young woman that sold hcrbr, whom
when the sailors saw, they laid hold on her,
and carried her in among the trees; upon
which the old woman made such a prodigfout
out cry. that both men and women came to
their assistance. At the beginning, the fel-
low that began the fray, war killed with a
lance, though at first we did not know what
was become of him.
A night or two after we resolved to go
en shore, and try if we could find out the
man that was missing. An hour before
midnight we landed at the place where the
action began ; but it was so dark, we ceuld
discover nothing, till the boatswain fell over
one of the dead bodies, We concluded to
stay there till the morning, when we disco-
vered two and thirty dead bodies lying on the
ground, whereof two were not quite dead.
Having madt this discovery, I thought I had
seen enough, and so was preparing to return
onboard. But the Boatswain and the rest,
which were about twenty, resolved to go to
the Indian town, to try if they could find
what was become of Tom Jeffreys, their
companion.
It was not without difficulty that they
found the town, which consisted of about
two hundred houses, where the people being
all in a profound steep, the hilois concluded
to divid? themselves into three bodies, and to
set the town on fire io three places ai once,
to kill all that should attempt to escape, and
to plunder the rest.
Having made this refolutioa, to work they
went; they had not gone sar, before the
first company found their companion Tom
Jeffrey*, stripped stark naked, with hit throat
cut from car to ear, hanging by one arm up-
on a tree. In a house adjoining to this tree,
they found fifteen or sixteen Indian*.

They immediately set fire to the house,
and at the lame time to several others in the
town ;'so that, in a very little time, the
whole place was all in flames; and no soon-
er did the affrighted creatures run out to
save themselves from the fury of the flames,
but the sailors either drove them back again
into fire, or killed them without mercy.
By this time the town was all in flames,
snd the light of the conflagration made me
very uneasy, and likewise surprised the cap-
tain and the men that were with him on
board, who knew nothing of the matter -
But when he saw the smoak, and beard the
gun* go ess, he concluded hit men must be
in great danger; upon which he took the
other boat, and with thirteen men resolved
to go to the assistance of them, let the con-
sequence be what it would ; and, though I
ww sensible of the danger we ran, yet I had
no power to stay behind.
We went directiy as the flames guided us,
but I must own, when I came to the place, I
never beheld greater horror, nor heard more
dreadful out cries: In short, the whole spec-
tacle «« too dreadful to be described, and
the miseries and astonishment of the people
not to be uttered. I got into the center, in
order to put a stop to their farther Barbarity,
and ordered some of the men to follow me j
but I had hardly spoke the word, before the
Boatlwain, with four of the men after him,
came up to us, all covered with blood and
dust. When (hey saw us, they gave a great
halloo, in token that more help was come.
Noble Captain, said he, these hell hounds have
barbarously murdered Tom Jeffrey&, and in re\»
venge tve iiil them all; and according '',,i
to ail their" accounts, they destroyed one
hundred and fifty men, women and children,
and burnt the whole town to aflvs into the
bargain •, while not one ot them received any
particular hurt, the pour Indians being -un-
prepared, ama-zed and confounded -*-Howe-
'ver our men might value tbemfe ves upon
-''ibii botd exploit, yet Laiwiys looked upon
h with detestati on, and gave it the title of the
-maffic- e of Madagascar. , '-, :-V
"- 'W&eii we were urvder fail, the Boatlwain
t%0u4d be rifttfsl, magni yingf and defending
''this bloody action^ which i>a« often disprukd
and condemned ; bidding them depend up*
on it, God would never bless their voyage
after such unparalleled barbarity. And as I
foretold, so it happened $ for when we came
upon the Persian shore, we lost five of our
men, who venturing too sar on the shore,
were either killed, or taken and made slaves
by the Arabians. Upon this misfortune I
again reprehended them, advising them to
repent. Upon this the boatswain said, you
are always disturbing us ; and as you are but
a passenger, we are net obliged to bear it;
and therefore if you do not forbear for the
future, I shall leave the ship, and not sail with
such dangerous and ungrateful company.
All this I heard very patiently, being sen-
sible, as cafes then stood, I had no remedy;
and indeed, I thought all had been over and
forgotten: But, so it happened, we were
sow in the road of Bengal, where, going
; one day on shore with the Supercargoe, one
of the men came and told me, *' I need not
trouble myself to come on board any more,
for that he had orders from the boatswain,
and the rest of the ossicers, not to bring me
on board any more?*"
This insolent message much surprised me_i
however, I made the fellow no answer, but
went to the supercargo, and desired him to
go on board immediately, and acquaint the
Captain, that he might prevent the mutiny
which I had reason to apprehend: Bui, be-
fore this could b« done, the matter was ef-
fected ; for 1 was hardly gone out of the
boat, but the boatswain, gunner, carpenter,
with all the inferior ossicers, ran to the
quarter deck, desiring to speak with the Cap-
tain; and then the Boatswain began to rail
against me exceedingly, telling him, That if
J had not gone on /bore myself, they had resolv-
td to have compelled me to it. And sarther, .
he had the insolence to add, "That if I ha'd
not quitted the ship, though they had all the
respect imaginable for their Captain, and
would serve him with their lives ; yet they
would all have left the ship immediately."—
Upon which the rest cried out, One and all,
one and ail-
Though my nephew was a man that want-
ed neither courage nor resolution, yet this
unexpected behaviour (hocked him exceed'
ingly; he expostulated with them, telling
them the danger and injustice of such pro-
ceedings, but all would not do ; they had
fully resolved, that if I came on board, they
would all leave the ship ; upon which said he,
"If this be your resolution, I will go and ac-
i quaint him with it." And so he came up to
me, and told me all that had passed. I am
- very glad to see you. Nephew, said I, and
am glad it is no worse; for in tru h I ex-
I only desire you to send my necessity things
on shore, and I will find my way to Eng-
land as well as I can. though this vexed
my nephew to the heart, yet, finding there
was no remedy, he took his leavj ot me and
went on board, and sent me my necessaries $
- and so this matter was over in a very few
hour*. And uow I think I was at least a

thousand leagues sarther distant from Eng-
land, than I was at my little kingdom. My
nephew left me two servants to attend me,1
who engaged to be with me till my return.
I took lodging in the house of an English
woman, where were several merchants ; aud
indeed i liked the company and entertain-
ment so well', that I continued here ieverat
months, considering what Courle I had best
take. I had some valuable English goods, a
thousand dollars in cash, and a letter of cre-
dit for mare, if I should have occasion.—
The goods I soon disposed of to advantage,.
and bought here several good diamonds,
which I could easily carry about with me.
One morning, a merchant, with whom I
was very intimate, came to me, and said,
countryman, I have a proposal to make to
you, which I do not question will be to both
our advantages. To be short Sir, we are
both io a remote part of the world, and far
removed from our native country, and yet
we are in a place where men that understand
business, may get money. Now if you wHl
pur a thousand pounds to my thousand
pounds, we will boy a good ship, you (hall
Be the Captain and I (he merchant, and we
will go upon a trading voyage.
This proposal soon gained upon me, suit-
ing exactly with my rambling inclination I
but it required some time before we could
set a veflel to our mind, or sailors fit to man
er out. In'a little tlmcwe procured both,
and so we sailed away for {Jairia, and.had a
very prosperous Voyage, having not only
gained a large, sum of money, but withal got
- a good insight into the traffic of those coun-
tries. - ," . : .
Our next voyage was to the Spice islands,
which proved likewise very successful ; and
pot loqg after, the merchant and I made up
pur , accounts to our mutual satisfaction.
We found ourselves vety rich; and now our
pnly concern, was how to dispose of our mo-
ney. Whilst, we were considering what was
best to be done, it happened that a Dutch
: ship of abput 200 tons came into port. Tht
men pretended they were, so ill, that there
were not, hands sufficient to maoage the ves-
sel, and the Captain being desirous of going
to Europe, public notice was given that the
ship was to be sold ; which no sooner came
to our ears but we bought her, and would
have entertained some of her men,' but they
were not to be found, for as soon as they
had received their dividend, they all went
privately to the Mogul's country; as in truth
they had reason enough; for this pritended
Captain was only the. gunner (the real Cap.
tain and three of his men being killed by the
Malagans) who ran away with the ship to
the bay of Bengal, leaving the mate and five
men more on shore, of which you will bear
more in the sequel of the story.
After we had bought the ship, and fitted
ber with all necessaries for her voyage, with
some dissiculty and cxpence we picked up
some sailors of different countries, and man-
ned her tolerably well, resolving upon anoth-
er voyage to the Spice islands. In this man-
ner we traded backward and forward for
five or six years, with very good success, and
were now in the seventh year going to Chi-
na : but in this voyagewe met with contrary
winds, wbich beat us up and down; and no
sooner had we got dear of these rugged seat,
but we found our ship had sprung a leak,
which obliged us to put into the river Cam-
bodia, wbich goes to Siam.
One day as I was on shore.'refreshing my-
self, tbere came to me an Englishman, that
was mate to an Eastindiaman, that rode in
the lame river; Sir, said he, you may very
well wonder at my business, who am a perfect
stranger to you, but notwithstanding that, I
have tornetbing to impart to you, that con-
cerns you veiy nearly, and it ii the imminent
danger you are io that has brought me to
you. Danger! said I, I know of no danger,
unless that our ship is a little leaky, and that
I intend shall be rectified as soon as possible.
I believe, said he, you will find other em-
ployment. The town of Cambodia is about
io leagues higher, and three leagues on this
fide lies three Dutch and two English ships,
and will you venture up farther into the riv-
er, without considering whether you have
force enough to sight tbem all?
I knew not what he meant by this dis-
course, and turning short upon him, Sir,
said I, I know no reason I have to be afraid
cither of the Dutch or English: I am no in-
terloper, and what business then can they have
with me ? Well, fays the man, if my advice
is ot do weight with you, you msy take your
own way; however, I am very furry you .
should be so much an enemy to yourself : I
Will be plain with you unless you put to sea
immediately,you will be attacked by five long
boats full of armed men, and yourself banged
fora pirate if you are taken; and, Sir, I
thought such a piece of intelligence deserved
better treatment, Sir, (aid I, you shall not
fiod me ungrateful; let me beg you there-
fore to explain yourself, and I will put to sea
immediately. Why then, in (hart, the mat-
ter is this: You know very well that your
Captain, with three of his men, were killed
by the Malagaos, and that you, or some oth-
ers that were on board, ran away with the
(hip, and are turned pirates. Now Sir, this
is the substance of what I hive to say, I can
only farther assure you, that if they can lay
their hands on you, they will execute you
without ceremony.
Sir, said I, though 00 man came more
honestly by the ship than I did, yet as you
represent the matter, I think I ought to be
upon my guard, and I heartily thank you
for your information. Come said he, it it
no matter for ceremonies ; if you value
your own life and the lives of your men, get
out to sea as fast as you can. I am very well
satisfied said I, in your sincerity and the ser-
vice you have done me, pray therefore tell
me what recompepce I shall make you? On-
ly take me with you, said he, and if you find
what I have told you to be true, I refer my-
self for a recompeoce to your generosity.
So reasonable did this appear in every par-
ticular, that we went immediately on board
together, where we were no sooner entered,
but my partner welcomed me with the joy-
ful news that they had stopped the leak.. I
am glad of thaf said I; but come let u» make
all the haste we can to weigh anchor; hot'
whilst we were busy in thati a sailor called*
to the Captain, and told^,Htm there were sloops
coming after us; upon which the Captain'"
taking his prospective-glass, and looking-oil t»<
saw five sloops full ot armed men, in full
chafe after us•, upon which he immediately'
sent one of the sailors to giv'e us: ri6tice.'
Vtry well, said I', l am folly convinced therct
is something in it; and so I went upon the"
deck, and told the men they were in danger1
of having the ship fvz'ed. and being executed'
as pirates ; and asked them if. they would
saithful y stand by us, and by one another?
T6 which they unanimously replied, they
would stand by us, and Bghtfor us to the last'
drop of their blood) Thea I asked the Q8p'«
tain, which way he thought'was the best to1
defend ourselves; who replied, he belieVed
it was the safest to keep them off' with out:
great guos; and accordingly the gunner was
ordered to load the guns with small shot, rind
to bring them to bear before and aft: arid
thus the deck being1 cleared, We wefe in all
points prepared for ari' tfsVg^emetjr; , v-.'
We- stood cut to sea, but still the boat!
followed us very tlose\ We could perceive-
the two foremost were English, which were
a-head of the Dutch by two leagues : here?
upon we sired a gun, aad bung out a flag
of truce, in order for a parley ; but finding
they bore down upon us with all the fail
they could, we Sred upon them with balls,
and then bade them .keep off at their peril.
But all this signified nothing; for, depend-
ing upon their numbers, they were Absolutely
bent upon mischief. We msde several shots
, at them as they earn: forward, killed several
of their men, and funk one of their boats,
and manning out our pinnace, we saved three
of their men from drowning, who were
brought onboard. After a very hot action,
we got out so sar to sea that they could not
pursue ut without danger; and so, changing
our course to the eastward, we got quite out
of the course of European ships.
When we were got out to sea, enquiring
more particularly into the meaning of all this,
the Datchmcn let us into the whole secret,
telling us, that the fellow, we bought the
ship of, was an errant thief, and that he ran
away with the ship; that the Captain, was
treacherously murdered, and that he and
four more were forced to the woods, for
safety; and that, at length, by means of. a
Butch vessel in its way to China, .that came
in accidentally to take in fresh water, they
were preserved. He sarther told us, that
they were informed that the fellow fold the
ship at Bengal,' and she was turned pirate and
had taken several prizes, f
After mature consideration, we concluded
it best for us to return to Bengal, where,
being known, we might best prove how we
came by the flyp, and where we were sure to

meet with some Justice, and not be,hanged
first and judged afterwards: But, upon fe-
cond and more deliberate thoughts, we all
agreed that, by passing by Batavia, we ran
too great ahaz trd, and therefore we deter-
mined to change our course, aod sail towards
the coast of China, and there dispose of the
ship, and then get another, and make the
best of our way to Europe. This being
generally agreed to, we steered away N. N E.
but, meeti-g with contrary winds, which
b'ew hard against ut, our voyage grew very
trnubksome, aod tedious, and our previ-
£ ,ns were almost exhausted ; and what was
still work, we were apprehensive, that the
ships, whose boats we had handled so rudely,
might' beta' the rode before ut, which in
consequence must be fatal to us. Upon these
melancholy considerations we again resolved
to change our course, and try if possibly we
Could not make some harbour belonging to
the Portuguele. With this resolution we let
forward for the bay of Tonquin, in order to
fail from thei ce to Macoa, a town once pos-
sess d by the Portuguese, and where there are
still many European families.
We came in sight of this place early next
morning; but considering cur former cir-
cumstances, we put into a small river; till we
had enquired what ships were in the road,
| and how matters stood; and indeed this pru-
dent step was the occasion of Our happy de-
liverance i for next morning there came in
two Dutch ships, aod a third without any
colours; and in the evening two English
ones.
