received her firft breath in that county : and ak her 
maiden- name was Robinfon, I. was' called Robinfin

EngliOi tongue, we are commcffily known by the naoic

I was the youngeft of three brothfrs. The eldeft 
Was a tieutenant*colonel in Lock hart's regiment, but 
flain by the Spaniards: what became of the other^ I 
could never learn. 

No "Charge nor pains <were wanting in my educa*

refolved, if it pleafed God to fct me on dry- land once 
more, I would returxi to my parents, implore their*

lept my cabin, tiff the ttniverfal and terribly dread/bl 
appreheniiohs of odr fpeedy £ue made me get upon 
deck : and there I was affrigbtcd indeed. The fca 
went mountains high : I could fee nothing but dlArefs 
around us ^ tw<» (liips had cut therr mails by the board, 
and another was foundered >; two more that had loflt 
their anchors, were forced out to the mercy of the 
ocean; and, to fave our lives» we were forced to cut 
cur forc-maft and mam-maft quite away. 

Who IS there fo ignorant as hot to judge of mf 
dreadful condition I I was but afreih-water (atlor, and 

' therefore it feemed more terrible. Our fhip was very 
good, but ov^r-loaded ; which made the failors often 
cry out, She ^^vould founder : ytotds I then was' igno- 

« rant of* All this while the Aorm continuing, and r»- i 
ther increafing, ihe mailer and the more fo6er part of 
his men went to prayers, expeftipg death every mo- j 
mcnt. In the middle of the night one cried out, We^ ; 
hadfprtmg a leak : another, Ihat there was four foot w^- ^ ' 
igr in the hold* I was juft ready to expire with fear, -j 
when immediately ail hands were called to the piimps

the mafter, eifying fome ligbt^colliers, fired afgui^as a 
fignal of diArefs ; and I not underftandiiTg what it

Ibme dreadful thing happened, fell into a fwoon*. 
Even in that common condition of woe nobody mind*

was meant by Foundering at fea. And now the men '^ 
inceflantly laboured to r^<jover their owq (hip ; buir 
the Tea ran fo high, sind the wind blew fo hard, that 
they thought it convenient to haul within fhore; 
which, with great difficulty and danger, at lalV we 
happily efFefted, landing at a place called Cromer^ not ^ 
far from Wintcrton light-houfe ; from whence we all 
walked to Yarmouthf where, as objcdts of pity, many 
good people furniihed us with neceffaries to carry u^^ 
either t6 Hull Or London*' ' 

Strange, that after all this^, like the prod)];al fon^ - 
I did not return to- my father; who, hearing of the 
ftiip*s calamity, for a long time thought me intombed - 
In the deep. No doubt but I {hbuld hkve jhared in -

ill fate dill jpuihed me on, in fpite of the powerful 
conviiStiond of reafon and corifcieuce. 

When w€ had been at Yarmouth' three days, I met 
my old companion, who had given me the inviiation 
to go on board along with his rather. His bthavif ur 
and fpeech wa» altered, and in a melancholy, manner 
aiked me how I did, telling his father who I was/and 
hoif i had made this voyage for a trial only to pro-

tipon it^ where- ever you go, you, ivtll meet with dlfafiers 
and ilf appointments^ till yottt father* s- words are fulfilled 
upon you. And fo we partcdr 

I tfiought at firft to return horoev but fhame op»- 
pofed that good motion, as thinking I (hould be 
toughed at by my neighbours and acquaintance. Sa 
firange i&the nature of youthi who are not afhamed 
to fin, but yet afhamed to repent ; and fo far from 
being a(hamed of thofe aftions for !(vhich tt/ey may 
be accounted fools, they think it folly to return ta 
^beir duty, which is the principal mark of wifdom*^ 
In fhort, I travelled up to London, rcfolving upon 
a voyage ; and a voyage I foon heard of, by my ac« 
quaintance with a captain, who took a fancy to me^ 
to go to the ^coaft of Guinea* Having fome money, 
and appearing like a gentleman, 1 went on board, not 
as a common (ailor or £ore-ma{^-man ; nay^ the com- 
mander agreed I ftiould go that voyage with him 
witfiout any expence ; that I ihould be his mefs^ 
mate -and companion, and I was very welcome ta 
carry any thing with me^ and make the beft mer<» 
chandife r could. 

I blefled my happy fortune, and humbly thanked 
my captain for this offers and acquainting my frieiids 
in Yorkfhire, forty pounds were feiit me, the greateft 
part of which my dear father and mother contrt- 
bufed to, with which I bdught toys and trifles, as the 
captain dire^ed me. My captain alfo taught me aavi- 

. gation, how to keep an account of the Oiip's cohrfe, 
take an obfervation, and led me into the knowledge 
of feveral ufeful branches of the matheoiatics* And 
indeed this voyage qoade nie both a failor and a mer- 
thant *, for I brought home five pounds nine ounces 
ofgold-duft for my adventure, which prcfduced, at 
my return to i^^J!?/7, almoft three hundred pounds. 
But in this voyage I was extremely fick, being thrown 
into a violent calenture through cxceffiye heat, trade- 
ing upon the coaft from the latitude of fifteen de- 

jgr^es north even id the liac itftlf. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE, 7 . 

But alas ! my dear fciend the captain foon departed 
this life after liis arrival. This was a fetififble grief 
to me ; yet I refolved to go another voyage with his 
mate, who had now got comoiand of ;he (hip. Phis- 
proved a very anfuccefsful one v for though I did not 
carry quite a htfndred pounds of my late acq«ired^ 
wealth, (fo that I had two hundred pounds leftj which^ 
I repoicd with the captain's widow, who was an ho« 
»efb genttewomani) yet my misfortunes- in ahis un- 
happy -voyage werc^very great. For oar (h>p><ailing . 
towards the Coft^i^ iflands, we were ohafed by a« 
Sa//ee rovtr; and in fpite oi all the hafte we could 
make^ by crouding as much, canvas as our yards coilld) 
fpread, ch* our maUt carry, the pirate gained upon us» 
fo- that we prepared^ ourfelves to fight. They had 
eighteen- g«ns, and we had but twelve. At^out three 
in the afternoouH there wat a defperate engagementt. 
waerein many w^re leiUed and wounded on both (1:1 es: 
but finding:ourfeIves overpowered with number^, our 
fhip difabled, and ourfelves too impotent to have th& 
lea(V hppes^f fticcefs, we were forced to furrender ; 
and accordingly were aH' carried prtfoners into the 
port of Sallee* Our men were fcnt to the £aiperor'< 
xourt to be fold there y but the pirate captaia tailing 
notice of mci kept me to be his own (lave* 

In this condition, I thought myfelf the moft mrfer^ 
able creature on «arth, and the prophecy of my father 
came afreih into my thoughts However, my condi- 
tion was better than I thought it to bs, as will foon 
appear. Some hopes indeed I had that my oew pa* 
tron would go tp Tea again^ where he might be; taken 
by a Spanifh or Portuguefe man-of-war, and then I 
iboold be fet atliberty. But in this I was midakeni, 
for he never took mS witl^ him, but lelt.me to look 
after his little garden, and do the drudgery of his 
houfe, and when he returned from fea, Would make 
me lie in the cabin, and look after the (hip. I had 
no one that I could i:ommunicate my thoughts to, 
wjiich were continually meditatm^ ra^ «fc.^\$.^\ tv<^

^df; and for two years I could, fee nothing pra6K- 
cAble, bat only pkafed myfclf.,wit'h the imagination* . 

After fome length of time, my patron^ as I found, . 
grew fo poor,, that he could nfot fit out his (hip as 
ufual : and then he ufcd conftantly^ once or twice^a-* 
wecky if the weather was fair ^ to go our a-fifhing, , 
taking me and a young Morefco boy to row the boat; ' 
and fo much pleafed was he with me for my dexte-- 
rityin catching the fife, that he" would often fend 
me with a RJoor, who^is one of his kinfmen, and- 
the Morefco youth, to catch adifliof fifli for him. 

One morning a^we were at the fport, ther^ arofe 
foch a thick fog, rhat^we loft fight of the fhtore : and. 
rowing we knew not which way, we laboured ;all the- 
night, and in' the morning, found ourfelves in the* 
ocean, two leagues -from- land. However J we attain* 
cd thci'e at length, and made the greater hafte^ be-- 
caufe our ftomach9 were exceeding fharp and hun- 
gry. In order to prevent fuch difafters for the fut^qre, . 
my patron- ordered a carpenter to build a little ftate- 
reom or trabin in the toiddlc of the longtboat, with 
a place behind it to fteer and haul home the main- 
Aeet, with others conveniences tp keep him from 
the \»featter, as alfo lockers to put in all manner of ^ 
provifions, with a hand fome fhouic|j|r*of-mutton faik 
gibing over the cabim 

In thiis he> frequently toob u$ out a-fifbing i and 
one time inviting two or three perfons of diftindron 
to go with him, made prot^ificns extraordinary, pro- 
viding $lfo three fufees with powder and. (hot j that , 
they might have fome fpert at fowling alongthe fea- 
codft* The next morning, the boatx was made clean, 
ber andent and pendants out, and every thing readyv 
but their minds altering, my patron ordered us to goJ^ 
a^fiihing, for that his guefts would certainly fup with 
him that nightV . 

And now I: began to think of -nry deliven^ce in- 
deed. In order to this I perfuaded the Mot^r to get 
fome :ppdvifions on bo^rd, ^s not daring to meddl^

oorfelves with rufk bifcuit, and three jars of w^^er. 
Beftdes, I privately conveyed into the boat a bottle of 

^ brandy» feme twidey thread, a hammer, hatchet, and 
a faiv; and in pardcular fome bees-^wax, which was a 
great comfort to me, and ferved to make candles. I 
then perfuaded Muley (for fo was the Moor called) to 
procure ibme powder and fhot, pretending to kill fea- 
curUeus, which he innocentlj^ aad readily agreed to. 

; In {hort^ being provided with ail things neceli'ary, we 

I failed out, refolving for my own part to make my e*

■■' When wt had pafled the caflle, we fell to fiQiing ( 
but though I knew there was a bite, I diflembled the 
matter, in order to put further out to fea* Accord^ 
Ingiy we ran a league further; when giving the boy 
the helm, and pretending to ftoop for fomething, {~ 
feized Muley by furprife, and threw him overboard. 
As h« was^an excellent fwimmer, he foon arofe> and

youflsall gron shore and kill-him* But the boy looked 
amazed v M^ kHlbfm^ fays he, he eat me at otte mouthy ^ 
meaning one mouthful. U;)on which- I xbid him 
lie ftill, and charging my biggeft gun with two flugs, 
and a good charge of powder, I took the heft aim 
I could to ifaoot him through the head^ but his leg 
lying over his nofe, the Aug broke his knee-bone. . 
The lion awaking with the pain, got up, but foon 
fell down, giving the moft b id eous groan K ever heard; 
but taking my fecond piece, I ftot him through the ^

this Xury took heart, and defired my leave to go on

gun in one hand, he fwam^to (hore with the otheri 
and coming clofeto the lion, put a period to his life, 
by (hooting him again through the head. 

But this was fpending our ammunition in vain, 
the flefh not being good to eat. Xury was like a 
champion, and comes on board for a hatchet^ to cljt 
offtheheadof bis enemy ; but not having ftrcngth - 
to perform it, he cut off and brought me a foot. 
I bethought me however that his fltin would be rf

they could kill at a great dlAance. I talked to them

Having none to afBft me, my father's words came

xiQt as well be obtained in England as here ? When 
1 pondered on this with regret, the thoughts of my

the raft with a great deal of labour and painsw 1 then 
confidercd what I fliould load it with, it being not 
able to bear a ponderous burden. . And this I. .foon 
thought of, firit laying upon it all the planks and

opening of the land, with a ftrong current of the tidfi ' 

Tanning Into it 5 npon which I kept in the middle of 
the ftrcam. But great was my concern, when on a 
fudden the fore^part of my raft ran aground; fo that 
had I not, with great difficulty, for near half an hour, 
kept my back firaining againft the chcfts to keep my 
effects in their places, all I had would have gone into 
the fea. But after fome lime, the rifing of the water 
caafed the raft to float again, and coming up a little 
river, with land on both fides, I landed in a little 
cave, as near the mouth as poffible, the better to dif* 
cover a fail, if any fuch providentially paflcd that 
way. 

Not far off, I efpied a hill of a ftupendous height, 
Airrounded with lefler hills about it, and thither I was 
refolved to go and view the country, that I might fea 
what part was beft to fix my habitation in. Accord- 
ingly, arming myfelf with a piflot, a fowling-piece, 
powder and ballf I afcended the mountain. There I 
perceived, I was in an ifland, ciKompafled by the Cps^i 
no diflant lands to be feen, but fcattering rocks that 
lay to the weft : that it feemed to be a barren place, 
and, as I thought, inhabited only by wild beafts. I 
perceived abundance of fowli, but ignorant of what 
kind, or whether good for i^ouriilimfnt I (hot one 
of them at my return, whici^ occafioned a confufed 
fcrcaming amcftig the other birds j and 1 found it, by 
its colours and beak> to be a kind of a hawk, but \i$ 
flefh was perfjrft carrion. 

When I came to my raft, 1 brought tny effeifls oa 
Owrc, which work fpent that day entirely 5 and fear- 
ing that fome cruel beafts might devour me in the 
night time while I flepr, I made a kind of hut or bap* 
ticrJe with the chelh and boards I had brought oa 
fhore. That night I flept very comfortable; and the 
next morning my thoughts were employed to make a 
further attempt on the fhip, and bring away what 
neceflaries I could find, before another ftorm fhoula 
break her to pieccis* ^Accordingly I got on board as Z'

before, and prepared a ff^cond raft, far mere nice tnan 
- the firft 5 upon which J brought away the carpenter's 
Acres, two or three bags full of ijails, a great jack- 
ftrew, a dozen or two of hatchets,' and a grindftone. 
I alfo took away fevcral things that belonged to the 
gunner, p^ticularly two or three iron crows* two 
barrels of nnufket- bullets, another fowling-pjcce, a 
fnTall quantity of powder, and a large bagful of fmall 
fhot. Befides thefe, I took all the men's clothes I 
could find, a fpare fore^topfail, a ha(naiock,.and fom^ 
bedding; and thus, completing '^my fecond^cargo, I 
made all the hafte to .fliorc I could, fearingTooi^; wHd 
beati might deftroy what I had there already,^. But I 
only found a little wild-cat fitting on one ofthc^ckefts, 
who not feeming to fear me, or the gun that Ipr,e- 
fented at her, I threw her a piece bfbifeuit, which 
ihe inftbntly ale and departed. 

What I had gotten thefe efFccls on fhorc, I went 
to work, in order to make me a little tent with the 
fail and fome poles^ which I had cut for that purpofc ; 
and having finifiiedjt, what things might be damaged - 
by the W{!a*her I brought in, piling all the empty 
cbcfis and cafks in a circle, the better to fortify it 
'%ii^;iinfl: any fuduen attempt of'nmn or beaft^ After 
thii, I blocked up the doors with fome ^boards, and 
an empty chtft turned the long^ 'way out. I then 
charged my gun and p*w<>l, and i-jying my bed on the 
ground, flept as comfortably, till nex^ iiiornJng, as 
thou^ i had been in a Chriftiati country, 

I^ow, though I had enough to fubfift me a long 
time, yet dtfpairrng of a fuddtn dehverance, or that 
both ammunition and provlllon might be ipent before 
fuch a thing happened, I coveted as much as 1 cculd; 
and fo long as the fhip remained in that condition, I 
dally brought ^way one neceffary or other, particu- 
larly the riggings fails, an J cordage, and fome twiqe^ 
a barrel of wet powder, fome lugar, a barrel of meal» 
tliree calks of nun, an^l what indeed was mpft wol^ 
come to incj a whole ho^ead of bread* 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 2; 

The next time I went, I cut the cables :n pieces 
carried oft* a b^ulfer whokj with a great deal of iron- 
tirork, and made another raft with the mizen and fprit- 
fail yards; but this being fo unwieldy, by the cob 
heavy burcien I had apon it, and not being able fv> 
■dexteroufly to guide it as the former, both my cargo 
and T were overturned. . For my part, all the damage 
I Aii^ained was a wet fkin : and at low water, after 
fiii3ch labour in diving, 1 got moil of the cables, and 
fome pieces of iron. 

Thirteen days had I now been in the ifland, and 

eleven times on board, bringing away all that was 

poffible ; and, I believe, had the weattyer been calm, 

I fhould have brought away the wh6le ihip piece by 

piece. As I was going the tweli^h' time, the wind 

brgan to rife ; hojurever, I ventured at low water, and 

atid rummaging the cj^ih^ rn a loclcer I found feveral 

'razors, fciffars, and fome dozens of knives and folks*, 

. and in another thrrty-fix pounds in pieces of eighty 

filver and gold. Ah! ftmph vanity ^ faid 1, ivhom this 

** loorid fo much dotes on^ where is now thy virtue^ thy ex^ 

ceVency to me f you cannot procure me one thing needful^ 

nor reuiove me from this defolate ifland\tp a place of plenty. 

Uitt of thefe knives^ fo meanly efteemed^ is to me more 

preferable than all this heap. K^n therefore remain where 

thou artf to fink In the deep as unreganled^ even as a crea* 

iure whofe life is not worth preferving* Y^t, after ail 

this exclamation, 1 wrapt it up in a piece of canvafs, 

and began to think of making another raft ; but I 

foon pcrccivca the wind begin to arife,* a freih gale 

blowing from the (horc, and the fky overcaft with 

clouds and clarkne&. So thinking a raft to be in vain» 

I let myfelf into the water with what tffings i had 

abaut me $ and It was with much difficulty I got a*i 

fliore, when foon after it blew a fearful ftorm. 

That night I ik^i very contentedly *n my little 
tent, furrounded wtth aU my effcfts i but when I 
looked oat in the Inorning, no* ioorc Ihip-was to be

pains, and had g^t every thing ufeful out of her, I 
comforted ipyfcjf in the befl: manner, and entirely 
Submitted to the will of Providence. 

My next tho^nghts were, how I (hould defend and 
fccure myfclf from (avages and wild beads, if any 
fwcl^ were in the ifland. At one time I thought of 
digging a cave, at another I was for ercfling a tent, 
and, at length, I refolved to do both : The manner 
er form of which will not, I hope, be unpleadng to 
jJcrcribe. * '^ 

When 1 confidered the ground where I was, that It 
was moorifh, and l^ad no frelh water near it, my re- 
iblutions were to (earch for a foil healthy and well 
watered, where I might not only be fheUcred from 
the fun's fcorching beat, but be more conveniently 
iituated, as well to be fecured from wild men, and 
beafts of prey, as inore eafily to difcover any diftant 
fail, rh^uld it everfo happen. 

And indeed it was not long before I had my defire. 
I found a little plain near a nfing hill, the front to- 
wards which being as O^cp^as a boufe-fide, nothing 
could defccnd on me from the top. On the fide of 
this rock was a little hoHcw place, referpbfing the cn-^ 
trance or door of a cave. Juft before this pla^ on 
the circle.of the green, 1 refolved my tent ihould 
fland. TLis plain did not much exceed a hundred 
yards broad,^and about twice as long, like a deligbtiui 
green before my door, with a pleaiing, though irre- 
gular defcent csycry way to the low grounds by the 
fea-ii.de, lying on the N- N. W. fide of the hill, fo 
that it was fheltcrcd from the exceffive heat of the 
fun. After this I drew a femicircle, containing ten 
yards in 4ts femidiameter, and twenty yards in the' 
IV hole, driving down two rows of ftron^g ftakes not 
lix inches from each other. Theii with the pieces of 
cable which Ihad cut on board, I regularly laid rneai 
in the circle between the piles up to their tops, which 
were m^rc than five feet out of the earth, and after 
drove another row of piles Iw^king within fide agaioll 
ti$em, between .two or three feet high, whkh made

me conclude it a little impregtiable cadle for men and 
beaAs. And for my better fecariry I would haive n9 
doory but entered in and came out by the help of a 
a ladder, which I alfo made. 

Here was my fence and fortrefs,into which I car-^ 
ried ail my riches, ammunition, and (\ores. After 
which, working On the rocli^,^ what with the dirt and 
ftones [ dug out, I not only raifed my ground two 
feet, but made a little cellar to my mantion-houfe ^ 
and this CO fl me man^ days labour and. pains* One 
day in particular. a Ihower of ravp falling, thunder and 
lightning enfued, which put me in- terror kit my 
powder (hould take fire, and not only hinder thy nc^'* 
ceflary fubfiOcnce, by killing me food, but even blow^ 
up me and my habitation. To prevent which, I fell 
to making boxes and bags, in order t<> ieparate ir^, 

> having by me near 150 weight. Aiid thus b<iing 
eAabliihed as king of th^iiland, every day 1 went out 
with my dog and my gun, to fee what 1 could kill that' 
was fit to eat* I loon perceived number^ of goats^ 
but very £hy; yet having watched them narrowly^, 
and feeing 1 c<i'd better ihoot q£F the rocks than 
whed in the low groups, I happened to (hoot a ihe- 
goat (uckling^ young kid ; wbich not thinking its 
dam flaio, iioqd by hei uncorxerned ; and when I^ 

I took the dead creature upj the young one foHowed m«

and would willingly have k-ept it alive; but finding it 
could not be brought to eat, I was forced to H^y it 
alfo for my owii (ubiirience* 

Thus, entered into as ftrange a fcene of life as ever 

Wtiy man was in, i bad moft melancholy apprehen-

or twelve cars of green buley appeared in the very 

fame fhape and make as that in England. ^ | 

I can fcarce txprefs the agitations of ^y mind at j 
this fight. Hitherto I bad looked upon the actions ai ! 
this lifei no otherwife than oniy as the evsnts of blind { 
chance anci fortune. But now, the appearance of this 
barley, floiirifhing in a barren foil, and my ignorance 
in not conceiving how it (hould come there, made me 
conclude, that miracles were not yet ceafed : nay, I even 
thought that God had appointed it lo growi there 
without any feed, purely for my fulienarjce in this 
miferable and defblate ifland. And indeed Ibch grei< 
eiFeft this had upon me, that it often made me meU 
into tears, through a grattful f^^nfe of Qod*s ^zit\t%\ 
and the greater ftill was my thankfiHnels, when 1 per^ 
, ceived about thrs little field of burky^ fome rice Ilaiks, 
alfo wonderfully flourifhing. 

While thuis pleafed in ihind, I concluded there 
mufl be more corn in the ifland ; and therefore made 
a diligent fcarch narrowly among the rocks , but not 
being able to find any, on a fudden it came into my 
mind, how 1 had fhaken the huiks of com out of the 
bag ; and then my admiration ceafed, with my grati* 
tude to the Divine Being, ai tJUnking it was but itaturai^ 
and not to be conceived a mh-acie;. tho' even the man« 
ner of its prefervation might have loade me own it a^ 
a wonderful event of God's kind providence* 

It was about the latter end of June When the ears 
of this corn ripened, which i laid up. very cirefuUy, 
together with 20 or 3C.ftalks of rice^ expefting one ' 
day I fhould reap the fruit of my labour j yet fouo 
years were expired before I could allow myfelf to eat

duf\ry for three or four months^^t lad i finilhed my^'

attack me, without fcaling the walls* 

But what does all human pains and induftry avails 

if the biefling of God does not crown our labours ? 

Or, who can (land Before the Almighty, when he 

ftrctcKeth forth his arm i^ For one timie, as I was at 

the entrance of my cave, there happened fuch a 

dreadftiT earthquake, that not only the roof or the 

cave came tumbling about my ears, but the poft$ 

fcem^d to crat-k ternWf at the fame time- This put 

me in great amazement ; and running to the ladder^ 

and getting over the wall, I then plainly knew it was 

an earthquake, the place I ftood on fu^arntng three 

terrible (hocks in lefs than three minutes Biit judge 

of my terror when I faw the top of a great rock roll 

Into the fea;'I then cxpefted the ifland would be 

fwallowed up every moment : And what made the 

fcene (lill more dreadFuJ, was to fee the fea thrown 

into themoO: violent agitations and diforders by this 

tremendous accident. 

For my part, I ftood like a criminal at the place 
of executfon, ready to expire. At the moving of 
the earth: I was, as it were, fea-fick 5 and very much^ 
afraid left the rock, under which was my fence and 
habitatioui fhould overwhelm me and it in a lading

When the third dreadful faock had ^pent itfelf, 
my fpirits bcgaii to revive; yet ftill I would not 
venture to afcend the ladder, but continued fitting 
not knowing what I Ihould do. So little grace had

^' no foooer was'^^the earthquake over, but that pathetic 
prayer left me*

over, I went to my tent ; but the rain coming on in 
a furious manner, I was obliged to take ihelrcr in 
the cave, where I was forced to cut a channel through 
my forrification ro let the water out. It continued 
raining all that night, and. fome time t-he next day. 
Thefe accidents made me refblve, as foon as the 
weather cleared up, to build me a little hlit in fomc 
open place, walled round to defend me from wild 
creatures and favages •, not doubting, but at the next 
earthquake, the mountain would fall upon my ha- 
bitation and xk^, and fwallow up all in its bowels.

i'cveral rcfolutions whether I (hould move of not :

that grew on the ifland. It took me up a full week

pronouncing this drezrifui Sentence, I thought Ik went

when 1 awaked, this very dream made a deirp im*

that was worn out by an uoimeri^ptcd feries of fea-

When the PDrtugal captain-took me up, and honour-

Such refleAions as thefe oppreff^ me even in the

lipting that I did not take fo large a quantity, nei- 
ther did I chew the leaf, or hold my head over the 
fimoke : but next drfy, which was the id of July, *

July 4. This morning I began-ferioufly to ponder;

I came^athiaconclufion, that a deliverance from fia.v 
was a much greater bleffing than a deliverance from 
affl ^tion. But agam I proceed tom^ joureal : 

To the 14th of July, I walked about with my gum. 
little and little at a time, having been» reduced to thsi 
greateil extremity of wcaknefs* The applications and*^ 
experiments I ufed were p«ffei):iy new j neither could^ 
1 recommend them to any one*s pra^ice-r for thoughf 
it carried off the fit, it very much weakened me v and 
1 had frequently convullians in my nerves and limbs, 
for fome tiiiie. From hence I Uarned, that going a*:, 
broad in rainy weather, elpccicwiy when attended with, 
ftorms and hurricanes of wind, was moft pernicious to- 
heahh. 1 had now fc^n above 10 momhs in the illmdv

therefore accounted myfelf as fole monarch'^, and as " 
I grew better, having .fccured my habkation to my, 
mind, I relolved to make a tour 'touad .my kingdom^^ 
in orderto make new difcoveries. 

July 45. I begaii my journey, and went to the creek. 
where I had bi ought my.rafts^ on Ihore, a ad travt?irmg 
farther, found the tide went no higher than two miles 
up, vs' here there was a little brook of running waters, 
on each iide of- which were m^ny plealant ^ueadows, 
plain, tmooth,^and covered with grafs. On the riilng 
parts, where I fuppofed the water Jid-not reach, I 
perceived a great deal of tobacco growing to a very 
ftrong ftalk', Several other plan is I Uk&wiie found, 
trhofe vjrtues I did not unxleritand. I learched a ioa^

There were fevcral plants oi ;)loes9 though ac that

ral Tugar canes, but imperfe~£t for want of cultivation* 
^Vitb thcfc^few difeoverics I came back 4hat night, 
suad ficpt contentedly in my iittle caftle. 

The next day, being the i6th, going tlie. fame 
way, but farther than the day -before, I found^ «he 
country morel adorneil with woods and trees. Here 
1 perceived different fruits in great abun-Jance i me- 
lons in plenty lay upon the ground , and c) oilers of 
grapes, ripe, and very rich, fpread over the (reef*- 
You may imagine I was glad of this difcovery, yet ate 
very fparingly, left I fhould throw myfcif into a flux 
or fever. The grapes' I found of excellent ule, for 
when I had dried them in the fun, which preierved 
them as dried raifins arc kept, they proved very 
wholefome and nouriihing, and (erved me in thofe 
feafons when no grapes were to be had. 

Thenigbt drawing on apacei I afcpndcd^up a tree, 
VRd flept very comfortably, though it. was the iirft 
time I had lain out of my habitation v s^od when the 
naming came, I proceeded with great pleafure on my 
way, travelling about four miles, as I imagined by the* 
length of the valley^ dire<5ting ray courfe northward, 
there being a ridgie of htils on the fouth and north 
fide of me* At the end of this valley, I came to an 
opening, Where the country feemed to defcend to.tli© 
wefl. : there I found a little fpriog of fKcfh- water ii- . 
iuing from a h^l-fide, with its cryftal ftrcams running 
directly eaft. Ai^d indeed here my i'. nTes were charm- " 
J cd wfth the moft beautiful landicape natuj^e could af- 
ford; for the country appeared foil our i thing, grwen, 
and delightful, (Arat to me it feemed Jike a planted 
garden. I then defcended on the fide of that dcli- 
- ckius vale, where I found plenty of cocoa, orange, k* 
mon, and citron tree*, but vtry wild and bar<rdn at 
that time. As for the limes, they were delightful. and

And now I was refolded to carry home and lay up a 
ftorc of grape>, limes, and lemons, ag^ainfi the ap- 
proaching wer feafon. So laying them up in f^paratc 
parcels, and taking a few of each with me, I returned 
to my little cafHe, after having fpent three clays in this 
journey. Before I got home, the grapes were fo bruifed 
that they utterly fpoiled ; the lime* indeed were good, ^ 
bu^ of thefe I could bring only a few. 

July rp. Having prepared two bags, I returned | 
thither again; but to my great furprife found all the 
grapes fpread about, trod to preces, and abundance 
eaten, which made me conclude there were wild hearts 
thereabouts. To pre\rent this happening again, I 
gathered a large tjuantity of the graphs, and hung 
them upon the out-branches of the trees, both to 
keep them unhurt, and that they might cure and-dry^ 
in the fun : and having well loaded myfelf witb* 
limes and iemom, I returned once more to my old^ 
place of refidence. ^ 

And now contemplating on the fruitfuinefs of this^ 
valley, the pleafantneft of its fituation, its fecuritf- 
from ftorms, and the dclightiulnelis of^the adjacent » 
woods, I concluded I was lettled irr the worft part of« 
the country, and therefore was thir^king to remove 
my habitation. But when 1 confidercd again, thiif- 
though it was plealant, it was off from the fea-fide 
whei-e there was a poffibiJity, fome time or other, a^ 
ftiip might either be driven or fail by •, and that tain-^ 
dole myfelf among hills and woods muft certainly put 
an end to my hopes of deliverance; I refolved 10 lef^ 
my caftle remain where Providence had firft adigned*. 
it. Yet fo raviflbed was i w^itb this place, that I made^ 
-me a. little kind of bower, furrounding it with • 
double hedge, as high as 1 couki_reach, well ftaked,^ 
and filled with bulrufhes; arid having fpeat a gfeat . 
part of the month of July, I think.it was-the fiti\ of^- 
Auguft before I began to enjoy my labour.

cave; and happy for cue I did fo, by which I faved 
the bcft part of my winter food,

)iad made o^e a tent like the other, yet having uq iheU 
ter of a hill to k^ep me from ftorms, nor a cave be- 
hind me to retreat to, I was obliged to return to my 
old caftle. The rain xominued more or iefs every 
day, till the middle of O^lober; and fometimes Co 
violently that I could not (lir out of my cave for fe ve- 
stal days* ^ 
j This feafon I found my family f o increafe ; for one 
of my cats that ran away from me, and who £ 
f thought had been dead, returned about Au0u(i,' witti 
i three kittens at her heeis, like herielf, which I thought 
^ 'ftrange, becaufe both my cats were females, and th^ 
I «ild cats of the ifland Teemed to be of a different kind 
I from our European cats; but from thcfe cats pro- 
ceeded fuch numbers, tl^at I was forced to kill and 
deAroy them as I would do wild befits or vermin. 

To the 26th of this month I could not (\ir out, it 
raining ince£antly ; when beginning to want food, I 
was compelled to venture twice, the firil time £ 
fhot a goat, and afterwards found a very large tortoiie* 
The manner of my reguUtiiig my food was thu^: A. 
bunch of raiiins fefved me for breakfail ; a piece of

or three turtle- eggs for my fupper. While the raii4 
lafled, I daily wot ked two or three hours at enlarging 
my cai^e, and by degrees irorked it on towards one 
fi(k, till I came to the outdde of the hill, and made 
a (\ocv or way out, which came beyond my fence or.

Icdging God's righteous judgments lippn me, and 
praying to Jefus Chrift to have nnercy on aie, I fafted 
tor t^'elve hours till the going Clowp of the Ain ; and 
then eating a bifcuir and a bunch of grapes, hid me on 
the bed, and with great comfort took my nightV 
Tc^ofe. Till this time I never bad diftinguifbed the 
Sabbath-day ; but now I made a longer nptch than^ 
Ordinary for the days of reft, and divided the weeks 
as well as I could, though I vfrund I had \uh a day or 
two in my account/ My ink failing foon after, l^ 
omitted in my daily memorandum things of an iadil^ 
ferent nature,' and contented myfelf to wrne down 
only the moft' remarkable events of my liff^ The 
rainy and dry leafons appeared now regular tp me, 
and experience taught "me how to provide for them;* 
yet, in one thing I am going to relate, my experience 
very much failed me. You may call to mind what I 
have mentioned offome barleyand rice which I bad 
faved; about thirty ftalks of.thlc former, and twenty 
of the latter; knd at that time the fun beicg in its 
fouth'ern pofition, going from me, together whh the 
'rain^, nuadc me conclude it a vpry proper feafon to 
ibw it. Accordingly I dug tJp a piece of ground 
with my wooden fpade, and dividing it into two part% 
fowed about two thirds of my feed, ppcferving by me 
about a handful of each. And happ^ it was 1 did f6; 
for no rams falling, it was choked up, and never ap- 
peared above the earth till the wet feafon came again, 
and then part of it grew, as if it bad been newly 
fown. 

I was refoWed ftill to make another trial ; and 
feeking for a aioifter piece of ground near n>y bower, 
I there fowed tb^ reft of my feed in February, a litHe 
before the vernal equinoi^ which having the rainy 
months of March and April to water it, yielded a 
noble crop, and fprung up very plcafantly. . I had 
ftill leaved part of the feed, no; daring to venture all ; 
and by the time I found out the proper feafons to 
fovrm, aod liiat 1 might caipe^ every year two feed- 
times

that, when a boy^ 1 took great delig^it in (landing at

Uved,. to view them at work: and, like other boys, 
curious to fee the manner of their working thcfe

the method of it, and wanted nothing but the tools. 
And it coming into my mind, that the twigs of that 
tree of .which I ipade my {takes, might Be as tough as 
fallow, willowy or oilers, growing in England, 1 re- 
folved to make an experiment, and went the next day ^ 
to my country^feat, and found fome fit for my turn; 
and after cutting down a quantity with my hatchet, I 
dried them in my pale, abd, when fit to work with, 
carried t^hem to my cave, where I employed myfelf in 
making feveral forts of bafkets, infomuch that I could 
put in whatfoever I pieafed* It is true, they vrere not 
cleverly made, yet they ferved my turn upon all oc- 
cafions. 

But ftill r wanted two neccflary things. I h^d no 
cafk to hold my liquor, except two rundlets'almoft 
full of rum, a few bottles of an ordinary fiz9, and 
fome fquare ca(e bottles ^ neither had I a pot to boil 
any thing in, onlv a large kettle, unfit to make broth, 
or dew a bit of meat : I wanted likewiil^at the begin- 
ning of this* dry feaion a tobacco-pipe ^ but for this I 
afterwards found an expedient. ^ 

I kept myfelf employed in planting my fecond row

ftant view of the country, I thought 1 could not mifs

I defccnded into a very large valley, fo forrounded

The harvcft months* November,, and December, 
w^e DOW at hand, in which 1 had ihe pleaGng pro- 
fpeA cf a very good crop. Bur here I met with a 
new misfortune; for the goats and hares^ having 
rafted of the fweetnefs of the blade, kept it fo ihort, 
that it had no ftrength to fhoot up into a <^alk. i o 
prevent this, J tnclofed it with a ii^dge, and by day 
ihot feme of its devourers ^ add my dog, which i had 
tied to the fieid-gate, keeping barking all nighf, To 
frfghtened thefe creatutcs, that I got entirely rid of 
them. 

Bttirno fooner did I get rid of thefe, than other e- 
n em its appeared, to wit, whole flocks of feveral forts 
of birds, who only waited till my back was turned to 
ruin me. So much did this provoke me, that 1 let 
fly, and kill-^d three ef the malefactor's ; and after- 
wards- fervd tl>em astkey do notorious thieves in 
England, hung them up in chains as a- terror to others. 
And indeed fo good an cffift had this, that they not 
only forfook the corn, but all that part of the ifland,, 
fo long as thefe criminals hung there. 

My corn having ripened apace, the latter end of 
December, which was my fecond harveft, I reaped it 
with a fcythe, made of one of roy broad fwords. I 
had no fattgut in cutting down my BrU ^rop, it was 
(o flaider. The ears 1 carried hom^ in a baiket, 
rubbing it out with my haiidsinftead of threihing it ; 
atrd when my harveft w^s over, found my half peck of 
feed produced near two bufliels of rice, and two bufli*. 
els and a half of barley. And now I plainly forefaw 
tbat, by God's goodnefs,.! (hould be furnilhed with 
bread : but yet I was concerned, becaufc I knew; not 
how to grind or make meal of my corn, nor bread, 
Beit her knew how to bake it* 1 would not however 
tafte any of.the crop, but refolved to preferve it againft 
nmt feafon, at^d in. the mean whilt ufe my belt en- *

of a harrow, I fupplicd rayfelf with dragging over the 
corn a great bough of a tree. When it was growing, 
J was forced to fence it 5 when ripe tomow it, c^^Try 
it home, threCh it, part it from the chaff, and fave it. 
And after all, I wanted a mill to grind it, fieve to 
drefs it, yeaft and fait ta make it into bread, and an- 

. oven to bake it. This fet my brain$ on work to find 
ibme expedient for CTcry one of thefe nectiTirie* 
againft the next harveft. 

And now having more feed, my firft care was tty 
prepare me more land. I pitched upon two large fi^t 
pifces of ground near my caflle for that purpofe, in 
which I fowed my feed, and fenced it with a good- 
hedge. This took me up three months; by which 
time the wet feafon coming on, and- the rain keeping. 
me within doors, I found feveral occaiiOns to employ 
royfelf; and while at work, ufed todiverf myfelf with 
talking to my parrot, learning him ro know and fpeab 
bis ^pwni name i /'<?//, the fipft welcome word I eveF 
heard Nfpoke in the ifland. I had been « longtime, 
contriving ^how to make earthen veflels, which I ' 
wanted extremely-, and when I confidered the heat 
of the climate, I did not doubt but if I tould find any 
fuch clay, I might boich up a pot, ftrong enough 
whtn dried in the fun to bear handling, «ud to hold 
aay thing^that was dry, as corn, meal, and oth'tr 
things. 

To be Qiort, the clay I fqund; but it would occa-. 
fion the mpft ferious per fori to fmile to fe© what auk-> 
ward ways I took, and what ugly milhapen things I 
made; how many either fell out or cracked by the 
violent ^eat of the fun, and fell in pieces when they 
were removed; fo that i think it was two months 
time before I could perftil any thing ; and even then 
but too clumfy things in imitation of earthen jars, 

• Theie however I^cry gently placed in Wickerb^lk- 
cts, made on pur pofe for them, and be-wccn chr pot

tb^ fmaJler things, I made them wirk better fucccfs ; 
fiich as little round pots, flit difhes, pitchers, and 
pi^plcins, the fuo baking them very hard. 

Yet ftill I wanted one thing abfolutely necefldrjr, , 
and that was an earthen pot, not only to hold my 
liquid, but alfo to bear the fire, which none of thei'e 
could do. It once happened, that as I was putting 
out my fire, I found therein a broken piece of one of 
my veflels burnt hard as a rock, and red as a tilew 
Tfeis made me think of bilroing fome pots;, and 
. having no notion of kilns, or of glazing them with - 
. lead. Infixed three large pipkins, and two or three pots 
in a pile one upon another. The fire I piled round 
the outfide, and dry wood on the top, till I faw the 
iofidered hot, and found that they did not crack s^ 
all; and when I perceived them perfectly red, I let 
ene of them (land in the fire about fi^c or fix hours, 
* till the clay melted by the extremity of the heat, and 
would have run to glafs, had 1 iufFered it; upon 
which I flacked my fire by degrees till the rcdncft 'a- 
bated; and watching them till the roorniD^g, 1 found 
I bud three very good pipkins, and two earthen pots, 
as well burnt, and fit for my turn as [ could defire. 

No joy xrould be greater than mine at this difcover 
ry. Foraftcr this, I may fay, I wanted for no fort 
oi earthen wa^c. I filled one of my pipkins with wa- 
ter. ?ta boil me fome meat, which it did admirably 
well^ and with a piece of kid made me fome good 
brotb, as well as my circumftances would afiord me at 
l«faat>ime. - 

The next concern I had was to get me a ftone mor« 
tar to beat fom^ corn in, inftead of a mill to grind it. 
Here indeed I was at a great lofs, as not being fit for 
a fionC'Cutter; and many days I fpent to find but a 
great ftone big enough to cut bollow and make fit for 
a mortar, and ftrong enough to bear the weight of a - 
pe file, that wotild break the corn without fiUiog it 
with land. But all the ftones of the ifland being of a 
mouide/ing dature, rendered my learch fruiilefs ;

wood; which having foon found, I formed it with my 
axe and hammer, and then with infinite labour made 
z^ hollow in it, jufl as the Indians of Brafil make their 
canoes. Wh^n I had finiilied this, I made a great 
peftle of iron- wood, and then laid them up againS^ snj 
iucceeding harveft. ^ 

My next buiinefs was to make me a Ceve, to fift 
my meal, and part it from the bran and hufk. 
Having no fine thin canv?^ to fcarch the meal through, 
I could not tell .what to do. What linen I had was 
reduced \o rags: I had goatVhair enough^ but nci-\ 
ther tools to work, it, nor cjid I know how to fpin it: 
At length I remembered I had fome neckcloths of 
callico or isuilln ot the hWors^ which I had brought 
out of the (hip, and with thefe 1 made three fmall 
Ceves, proper ciiough for the work. 

I come now to confider the baking part. The 
want of an oven I fuppHed by making foroe earthen 
pans very broad, but not deep. When 1 had a mind 
to bake, I made a great fire upon the hearth, -the tiles 
^ of which I made triyfelf ; and when the wood was 
burnt into live coal$> Ifpread them over it, till itt)e. 
came very hot; then fwecping them away, I fct down 
my loaves, and whelming down theearthen pots upon 
them, drew the aflies and coals all around the ou^lidc 
(/( the pots to continue th& heat ; and in this manner 
I^ked' ray barley-loaves, as well as if I had been a 
complete paltry- cook, and alfo made of the rice feverat 
cakes and puddings. 

It is no wonder, that all thefe things took me up the 
beA part of a yi;ar, lince what int;^rmediate time I had 
was bcftowcd in managing my new harveft and huf* 
b^ndry; for in the proptr feaion I reaped my corn, 
carried it home, and laid it up in the ear in my large 
baiket^, till I had time to rub, inftead of threfhing, it. 
And npw indeed my corn incrcafed fo much, that st 
. produced me about twenty bulhels of barley, and as 
much oi rice, that I not only began to ufe it freely, 
but was thinking bow to enlarge my barns, and re- 

folved.

for roe for a whole year. 

All this while, the^rofpeft of land, which I had 
feen from the other fide of the i{land| ran in my 
mind- I f^iil meditated a deliverance from this place^ 
though the fear of greater misftrtunes might have de- 
terred me fro.n it. Fof allowing that I had attained 
that place, I run the hazard of being killed and eat« 
en by the devouring cannibals i and if they were not 
fO| yet I might be flain, as other Europeans had 
been, who fell into their hands. Notwithflanding 
all this, my thoughts ran continually uppn that ihore* 
I now wiQied for my boy Xury, and the long boar, 
with the ihoulder-of- mutton fail: I went to the 
fbip's boat, that had been ca^ a great way on the 
fhbre in the late ftorm. She was removed but a lit- 
tle ; but her bottom being turned up by the tmpetu- 
oiity and fury of the wa^es and^ wind,.! fell to work 
with all the ftrength I had, and with levers and rolU 
crs^I had cut from the wood* to turn her, and re- 
pair the damages (he ha^ fullained. This work took 
me up three or four weeks, when finding my little 
ftrength all in vain, I fell to undermining it by dig- 
ging away the fand, and fo making it fall down, fet- 
ting pieces of wood to thrui^ and guide it in the 
fall. But ^fttr this was done, I was it ill unable t<y, 
ftir it up, or to get under it, much* lefs to move it for- 
wards, towards the water, and fo i was forced to give 
it over. 

This (Tifappointment however did not frighten me. 
J began to think whether it was not pofiible-for me 
^o make a canoe or Perigua, fuch a^ the Indians 
make of the trqnl^ of a tree, But here I lay imder 
particular inconvenicncies, want of tools to make it, * 
and want of hands to move it in the water when it 
was made* However, to worl^ 1 wei^t upon it, ilop^ 
ping ail the inquiries I could make, with this very 
iim^e anfwer I made to myfelf. Let** firii niake it,

ten inches diameter at the lower part next the ftump^ 
and four feet eleven inches diameter at th« end of 
twenty-two feet, afttr^ which it Itflened for U ipace, 
and tlien parted into branches. Twenty days was I 
hacking and hewing the tree at the battona, fourteen 
rnore in cutting off the branches and limbs, and a 
whole month ihaping ic like the-'bottoni of a boat* 
As for the infide, 1 was three weeks with a mallet and 
chiflel, clearing it in fuch a manner, as that tt was big'

fhore 1 fo ardently defired. 

Nothing remained now, but indeed the great eft dif- 
ficulty, to get into' the water, it lying about 100 
yards from it. To remedy the fifft inconvenrenec^ 
which was a rifing hill between this boat and the 
creek, witli wonderful pains and labour I dug into the 
furface of the earth, and made a declivity; But w h«a 
this was done, all the ftrength I had was as infuf^ 
ficient to move it, as it was wHen .1 attempted to 
move" the .boat. I then proceeded to meafure the dii^ 
tance of ground, .reiblving to make a canal^ in order 
to bring the water to the cunoe, finct; I couUI not" 
bring the canoe to the water, but as this Teemed tb

eleven or twelve yt.rs, it brought nie into luoie fort

impoflible, and the attempt altogether vain* I now* 
faw, and not before-, what ftupidity it is to^ begin

As long as my ink conrrinued, wEith with water! 
made laft as long as I could, I ufed to minute dowa 
the days of the months on which any Temarkable thing' 
'happened. And, 

Firft, I obferved, that the Tanie day I forfook my 
parents andrfriends^ and ran away to Hull, in order to 
go to fea, the fame day afterwards in the next year L 
was taken and made'ii il^vc by the Sallee rovers: 

That the very day I efcapcd out of the wreck of c!hc 
fiiip in Yarmouth-roads, a year after on the fame 
day> I made my efcape from Sallee in my patron's fifh« 
-ing-boat. 

And that on the^cth 6f Sepitember, being the day 
of the year I was born on, on that day twenty-fix 
years after, was I miraculoujQy faved, and caft aflbore 
on this ifland* 

The next thing that wafied, after my ink, was tbc 

bifcuit jvhich I had brought out of the (hip: and 

though I allowed myfelf but one cake a«day for above 

•a twelvemonth, yet I was<|aite out of bread for neaft 

z year, before I got any corn of my own. 

la the next place, my clothes began todeieay, zn4r 
my linen had been gone long before. However, I had 
^referved about three dozen of the failors chequered 
Ihllir, which proved a great refrcfliment to me, when 
the violent beams of the fun would not fuffer me to 
bear any of the feamcn's heavy watch-coats j whicIT' 
made me turn tailor, and, after a miferable botching 
manner, convert them to jackets* To preferve my 
head, I cpade me a cap of goat-fkins, with the hair . 
outwards to keep out the rain ^ which indeed ferved 
me fo well, that afterwards I made me a wai(tcoat and 
open-kneed breeches of the fame : And then^ I coq« 
trived a fort of ah umbrella, covering it with fkmt^ 
which not only kept out tlie heat of the fun, but the 
ratp alfo. Thus being eafy and fettled in my mind, 
my chiefeft happmefs was to converfc with God, ia 
nioft heavenly and comfortable ejaculations. 

For five ye^rs after this'I cannot fay any extraordi- 
nary thing occurred to me. My chief employment 

was

aolwer my detign of failing to the other ftiore, my ^ 
thoughts were confined to take a tour rourid the 
ifland, to fee what further difcoveri^s I could make.- 
To this intent, after having moved her to the tvatcr^ 
and tried how fhe would fail, I fitted up a little mall 
to my boat, and made a fail of the fhip's fail that lay

it f to put in necefTaries, provifioas, and animunitipn, 
which would prcfcrve them dry either from rain^ or' 
t'he.fpray of the fea-, and in the infideof the boat, I 
0ttf me a long hollow place to lay my gun, and to 
keep it dry made a flag to hang over it* My um« 
breHa I £xed in a ftep in the (lern, like a ma(h to 
hiBcp the heat of the fun ofiTmel And now refolving 
to fe^ the circumference of my little kingdom, I vic-r 
Mdled my fliip for the voyage, p^itting in two dozea 
df my barley-bread loaves, an earthen pot full ot * 
parched rice, a little bottle of rum, half a goat, pow- 
der and fhot, aod two watch- coats. It was the 6th

my, that I iet out on this voyage, which was mucjik

finefs was to work out of the firft current, and con* 
vcniently get into the eddy. Two days I flayed here, 
the wind blowing very briikly JL. S. £. which being 
contrary to the current, leaves a great breach of the 
fea upon the point; fo that it was neither fit for mc 
to keep too near the fliore, on account of the breach» 
nor Itand at too great ai diftance, for fear of the

ftrong, the water was fdul: and where it was cle^r, 
the current abated. To the eaft I foon (aw, i5i|3ut

humble proftration, thanking God for my deliver- 
ance, with a refolutioii to lay all thoughts of efcaping 
aCde, I brought my boat fafc to a little cove, and laid 
me down to take a welcome repofe. When I awokcj 
.1 was considering how I might get my boat homer

vrhich ran up to a rivulet or brook, where finding a 
life Harbour, I ftowed her as fafc as if (he had bcea

I now perceived myfelf not far from the place 
wherrbefore I had travelled on foot ; fo takirrg no»

my journey, and in the evening came to my bower,,

and no fponer were my eyes fully open, but I beheld 
my pretty Poll fitting on the top of the hedge, and

I was now pretty well cgred of my rambling to fea:. 
>■ yet I could wifh my boat, which had coft me fo much 
A trouble and pains, on this (idc the ifl^nd once more^ 
■ but which indeed was impradicJible. I therefore be- 
gan to lead a very retired life, living near a twelv^e- 
n^nth in a very contented manner, wanting for ho- 
thtng except converfation. As to mechanic labours, 
," which my neceffities obliged ipe to, "J fancied I could 
I ^. upon occaCoti make a tolerable carpemer, were the- 
^ I .poor tools I had to work withatbut good. Befldesay _

I >1ritdc and ugly. But I think I was never fo elevated

Sfhcr'threc Wds, one male the other two females. 

So boifterous was the old one, that I could not bring , 
him away; B^t I forgot the old proverb, STA^/ huti^tr 
will tame a lion: for had I kept him three or four days 
without viiStuals, and then given him fome water with 
a little corn, be would have been as tame as a young 
kid. Tiie other creatures I bound with firings to- • 
igetjier; but I had great difficulty before I could bring 
them to roy habitation. -It was fome time before they 
would feed ; bitt throwing them fome fweet corn, it 
io much tempted ihcm that they began to b« tamer ; 
from hence I concluded, that if I defigned to furnifh;. 
myfeit with goats flefh, when roy amrhunition was 
^ fpenr, t^e tamely breeding them up, like a flock of : 
iheep, about my fettlement, was the only method 1/ 
could take. I concluded . alfo I muft feparate the 
wild from the tame, or clfe they would always run 
wild as^jhey grew up; and the be(\ way for this, was 
to have fome inelofed piece of ground well fenced, 
cither with hedge or pale, to keep them fo elFe^tuallyj 
that thofe within might not break out, or thote with* 
out break in* Such an undertaking was very great 
for .'ne pair of hands; but as there was an abfolijite . 
necciSity for doing it, my firft care was to 6nd a con* 
veiiienr piece of ground where tjberc was likcfy to be 
herbage for them to cat,.waterto drink/ and cover to 
keep th^m from the fun. 

Here again I gave another inftance of my ignorance 
and inexperience, pitching upon a piece of meadow 
land fo large, that ha^ 1 indofed it, the hedge or pale 
muii have been at leaft two nwles about* Indeed had 
it been te^ miles, I had time enough to d<> it in ; but 
then i did not confide that my goats would be as 
wild in fo much cdmpafs, as if they had the whole 
iflaiid, and confequently as d fficult for me to tatcli 
them rhisnhought cajne into my head, after I had 
carried it on, I believe, about fifty y^rds : 1 therefore 
ahereJ my I'cheme, and relblved to iociofe A piece of 
ground about 150 yards io length, and icoin breadth^

ufficient enough for as fnahy as wdtild maintain me 
till fuch time as my flock increafed, and then I couBT 
add more ground, I now vigoroufly profecate.d my 
work, and it took rac about three months in hedging 
the firft piece; in which time I tethered the three 
kids in the heft part of it, feeding them as near me as 
poflible, to make them familiar: and indeed I very of- 
ten would carry fome ears of barley, or a handful of 
rice, and feed them out of my hand 5 by which they 
grew {o tame, that wh^n nay inclofurewas EniQied, and 
1 had let them loofe, they would run after me for a 
handhi] of corn. This indeed arifwered my end*, and 
in a year and a half's time I had a flock of about 
twelve goats, kids and all 5 and in two years after, they 
amounted to forty-three, befides wba^t I had taken 
and killed for my fuftenance. After which I inclofed 
five fcveral pieces of grotind to feed them in, with 
pens to drive tliem into, that I might take them as L 
had pccafion. 

In this projeft I Ukewife found additional bleffingSj 
for 1*^01 only had plenty of goats fl (h, but milk 
too, which in my b-^ginning 1 did not (o inuch ar 
think of. And indeed, thoughl never had milked a 
cbW, much left a goat, or feen butter or cheefe made,i 
yet, after fome eflays and mifcarriages, I made me* 
both, and never afterwards wanted. 

How meicifuUy can the Omnipotent Power com-:

who had found no fpccics to multiply his kin4 upon, 
continually fat on my right hand; while my two cats 
fat on each fide pi the tabic, cxpefting a bit from my

were not the cats I bad brought from the fliip; they- 
bad been dead long beforehand interred near my ha«

fappofe, generating with a wild cat, a couple of theit' 
young Lhad made t^tne; ' the reft run wild into the

and plunder me of my i^ores, till fuch time as I (hot 
a greatmany, and the reft left me without troubling, 
me any more* In this plentiful naanner did I live^ 
wanting for nothing but converfation. One thing., 
indeed concerned me, the want of my boat ; 1 knew 
not which way to get her round the ifland. One 
time I refolved to go along the (hore by land to her ; 
but had any one in England met fuch a ii^/e, i^>. 
would either have affrighted them, or make tiiem 
burfi into laughter ; nay, I could not but fmde my- 
felf at my Jbabit, which I think iti this place will be 
very proper to dcfcri be : 

My cap was great, high, and iKapelefs, made oi^ 
goat's &iQ, wkh a flap or pent-houfe hanging down 
behind, not only to keep the iun from me, bi;t to (hoot 
the rain off from running into my neck, nothing being 
more pernicious thai) the rain falling upon the fl^lh 
fa thefe climates. I had a (hort jacket of goat's ikui, 
whofe hair hung Jown fuch a length on each fide, . 
that it reached down to the calves oP my legs* At

femblance of fomcthing, I knew, not what 10 call 
them ; tbey were made like buikins, and^laced oa 
the fides like fpatterdaihes, barbaroufiy (haped like 
the re(t of my habit. I had. a broad belt ofgpatV

in the fame manner, which hung over my (houlder, 
and at the end of it, under my left arm hung two 
pouchesi made alfo of^goat's {kin, to hold my povder 
I and (hot. My baiket I carried on my back, and my 
gun on my (houlder ; and^ver my head a great clum- 
fy ugly goat -fkin umbrella, which, however, next to 
nay gun, was the mod neccffary thing about me. Ag 
for my face, the colour .was not fo fwarthy as the 
Mulattoes, or as might have been ^xpedlcd from one 
who took fo little care of it, in a climate within nini; 
or ren degrees of the Equinox* At one time my 
, beard grew fo long that it hung down above a quarter 
6^ a yard ; but as T had both razors and fciflars la 
ftore, I cut it all off, and fuffered none to grow, ex* 
ccpt a large pair of Mahometan, whilkers, the like of 
which I had fecn worn by fomc £\>Hzs at Sallee, 
not long enough indeed to hang a hat Upon, but of 
fuch a moni^rous fize, as woald liave amazed any in 
England to have ken. 

But all this was of ho confeqoence here,, there being 
none to obferve my behaviour or habit. And fo, with- 
out fear, and without; control, I proceeded on my 
journey, the profecution of which took me up five or 
fix days. I firft travelled along the fea-(hore, direftly 
to the place where I firft brought my boat to an an- 
chor, to get upon the rocks; but having now no 
boat to take care of, I went over land a nearer way 
to the fame height; that I was belFore upon*, when 
looking forward to the point of the rock, which lay 
out, and which I was forced to double with my boat, 
I was amazed to fee the fea fo fmootii-and quiet, there 
being no ripling motioOj nor current aliy more than 
in other places. This made me pomder Ibme tim? to

I .waited there till evening, when the time of ebb%Be»

farther off, nea-r half a league from the fhore ; where- 
as, in my expedition^ it fet clofe^upon ir, furioufl/ 
hurrying me and my canoe a!ong witJi it, which at 
another time it would not have doner And now I 
was convinced, that, by obfcrving the ebbing and 
flowing of the tide, I might ca(i!y bring my boat 
round the ifland again. But when I began to think 
©f putting it in pradlice, the remembrance of the late 
danger ftruck me with fuch horror, that t changed 
Hiy refolurion, and formed another, which was mare , 
"fafe, though more laborious*, and this was to make j 
smother canoe, and fo have one for one iide of the ] 
ifland, and bn^ for the other, . I 

^I had now two plantations in the iflind ; the firft j 
my little fortification, fcrr, or cafilej'with many large \ 
and rpacious improvements : for by this tinie^l had , 
enlarged the cave behind me with feveral little caves, a 
one within another, to hold my baflc^sts, corn, and ji 
ftraw. The piles with which I piade my wall were 
grown fo lofty and great as obfddrcd rny habitation,. 
And near this commodious and pleafaot (tttlement, 
lay my well cultivated and improved corn-fields, which 
kindly yielded me its fruit in the proper feafon. My ) 
fecond'plantation was tlxat near my country leaf, or 
little bower, where my grapes flourilhed, and where 
having planted many Itakes, i^made^inclofurcs for my 
goat?, fo ftrongjy fortified by labour and time, that 
it was much ilronger than a wall, and conlcquently 
impiflible for them to break through. As for my 
bower itfelf, I kept it conftantly in repair, and cut the 
trees in fuch a manner as made tliem grow thick aqd 
wild, and form a delightful Ihade. Th the centre cf

'fliip, And covering myfelf with a great watch-coati I 
took up thi? place for my country retreat. 

Very frequently from this letdfement did I ufe to

fometimes I would venture in her a caft or two from

a ritrw, but moft furprifing fcene of Hfe which here be- 

Yod bay eafily fuppofe, that, after ha^nng been 
here fo long, nothing could be more amazing than td 
fee a human creature. One day it happened; that go- 
ing to my boat, I faw the print of a mail's naked foot 
on the nbare, very evident on the fand, as the toes, 
heels, and every parit of it. Had I feen an apparition 
10 the moft frightful (hapc, I could nor have beeri 
more confounded. My willing cars gave the ttri^teft 
s^ttention, 1 caft my eyes around, but could iatisfy nei- 
ther the one or the other. I proceeded alrernately ta 
every part of the (hore, but with equal effi-ft ; neither 
could 1 iee any other mark, tho* the fand about it was 
as fufcepiiblc to take imprcffion, as that which;was fo 
plainly ftamped Thus ftruck with confufion attft 
horror, I returned to my habitation, frightened at eve- 
ry bufh and tree, taking every thing for men 5 and 
j)offeffed with the wildrft ideas ! That nig tit my e\es 
never clofed/ I formed nothing but the moft ditmal

ways to have terrified me? Why (hould he leave his

thefand where the furging waves of the ocean might 
foon have erafed the impreffion* Surely this a£lion U 
not confiftent with the fubtilty of Satan, faid I to my* 
/ felf, but rather muft be fome dangerous creature, 
fome wild favage of the main-land over-againft me, 
that venturing too far in the ocean, has been driven 
-here^ either by the violent currents or contrary winds \ 
and not caring to ftay on this dcfolate ifland, has gonfi 
back to fea again. 

Happyi indeed, thought I to myfelf, that, none <>f 
the favages had feen me in that place V yet I was not 
altogether without fear, leaft having found my boat, 
they fhould return in numbers and devour me, or at 
leaft carry away all my corn, ahd deftroy my flock of 
taoie goats: in a word, all my religious hopes va« 
niihed, as though I thought God could not now pro- 
tect me by his power, who had fo wonderfully pre- 
ferved me fo long* 

What various chains of providence are there in the 
iifjB of man ? How changeable are our affcftions, ac- 
cording to different xircumftances? We love to-day 
what we hate to-morrow j we iliun one hour what we 
feek the next. This was evident in me in the moft 
confpicuous manner: for I,' who before had fo much 
lamented my condition, in being banifhed from aliha:« 
«nan-kind, was now even ready to expire, when I con- 
fidered that a man had fet his foot on this defoiate 
ifland* But when I confidercd niy ftation of life, de- 
creed by the i»iinitely wife and good providence of 
God ; that I ought not to difpute my Creator's fove- 
reignty, who had an undoubted right to govern and 
difpofe of his creatures as he thinks convenient ; and 
that his judice and mercy could cither punifli or de-^ 
liver me: I fay, when I confidered all this, I comfort- 
ably found it ray duty to truft fincercly in him, pray 
ardently- to him, and hua>bly rcflgn myfelf to his di-

One morning, lying on my bedi tbefe words of the 
facred writings ^ame again into my mind. Call upon me' 
in the ^ay of trouble^ and I nvill deliver thee^ and thou 
Jbalt glorify me* Upon this fentcnce, rifing. more 
cbearfully from my bed, I offered up my prayers in 
the moft heavenly manner : and when I had done» 
taking up the Bible to read, thefe words appeared 
firft in my fight :; Wait on the Lord, and be of good 
cheer^ and he fhall ftrengthen thy heart : Wait 1 Jay^ on 
the Lord* Such divine comfort did this give me, as 
to remove all caufe of fadnefs upon tliat occaflon. 

Thus, after a world of apprehenHon^ and fears for 
three day^Mui- nights, I at iaft ventured out of my 
caflle, ancHnilked my goats, one of which was al-^ 
moA fpoiled for want of it« I next (though in great 
fear) villtcd ,ray bcrwer, and milktd my flocks there 
alfo i when growing bolder, I went down* to the iliore 
again, and meafuring the print of (he foot to mine^ 
to fee perhaps whether I mylelf had not occaflqped 
that mark, I found it much fupertor m largenefs y 
and fo returned home, now abfolotely convinced, that 
either fonie men had been afhore, or that the ifland 
mud be inhabited; and therefbre that I mrght be 
furprifccf before 1 w» aware. 

i now began to think of providing for my fc- 
curity, and revolved in my mind many different 
fcbemes for that purpofe : I firft propofed to cut down 
my inclofures, and ttwn my tame cattle wild into the 
woods, that the enemy might not find them,> and 
frequent .(he ifland in hopes of killing the lame. 
Secondly^ I was for digging up my corn-fields for the 
very fame reafbo'* And Laftly^ 1 concluded to de- 
molilh my bower, lefl feeii^g a place of human coii* 
irivance, th^y might come farther, and find out, ani 
attack me in my little caille. 

Such notions did the fear of danger fuggcft to me ; 
an^i I looked I thought, like the unfortunate king

Sleep was an utter ftranger to, my eyef that night;: 
yet nature fpent and tired,' fubmitted to a filent re- 
pofc the next morning. And then, joining reafon 
with my fe^, I confidered, that this delightful and 
pleafant iiland might not be for entirely-forfafcen as 
1 might think i but that the inhabitants from the 
other flior-e rtiight fail, either with defign, * or froni 
neccfliry, by crofs winds; and if'th^ latter circum-i, 
fiance, 1 had rcalon to believe they would depart the 
firil opportunity*" However, my fear :ii|||pi made me 
think of a place for retreat upon an attack. I now 
repented that I had made my door to come out be- 
yond my fort jficatioi^ 5 $a remedy which, 1 refolved 
to make me a fecond one : 1 fell t® work, therefpre^ 
and' drove betwixt the double row of trees, which I 
j^anted about twelve years before, fevcral ^ftrong

cables, and lirengthening the foot of it with earth, 
which I dag out of my cave ; I alio made me fevea- 
holes, wherein I planted mj mulkets like cannon, 
fitring them into frames tei&bling carriages." This 
being finilhed with indefatigable induilry, for a great 
way every where, I planted flicks of ofier like a 
wood*, about twenty thoufand of them, leaving 5^ 
large fp^ce between them and my wall, that I might 
have room to fee an enemy 1 and chat they might not. 
be ihtltered" arfrong the young trees, if they offered 
to approach the outer wall. And indeecjf icarce two 
years had pailid over my head when there appeared 
a lovely Ihidy grove, and in iix years it becHme a 
t'hick wood perfectly, impailible. For. my fatety, F 
left no avenue to go in or out 5 inftead of which I 
iet two ladders^ one to a part of the rock wiiich was

^c at the pmfide of my outer wall. But while Itbok 
^11 thefc tneafurcs of hamao prudence for my own 
prcfervation, I was r^ot altogether unmindful of other 
5ifeairs. To preferve my ftock x>( tame goats, that , 
the enemy fhpuld not take all It once, I looked out 
for the irioft retired part of the ifland, which was the 
place where I had loft myfelf before- mentioned, and 
there finding a clear' piece of land, containing three 
acres, furrounded with thick woods, I wrought fd 
hard, that, in lefs than a month's time, I fenced 
It fo well round, that my flocks were very well fe- 
cured in ir, and I put therein two he goat^ and ten 
fhe ones. ^ ' / 

All this Tafeour was occafioncd purely by fearful 
apprehenfions, on account of feeing the print of a 
man's foot. And not contented yet with what I bad 
done, I fearched for another pl^ce towards the ^eft 
point of the ifland, where I might alfo retain in- 
other flock. Then wandering on this errand more to 
the weft of the ifland than ever I had yet done, and 
cafting my eyes towards the fca, methought I per- 
ceived a boat at a great diftance ; but could not pof- 
^bly tell what it was f9r w^nt of my perfpeftive glafs. 
I confidered that it was no ftrange thing to fee the 
- print ol a man's foot*, and, concluding them canni- ' 
bjnUi blefled .God for my being ca ft on the other 
fide of tl^e ffland^ where none of the favages, as I 
tbougtu, ever came* ' But when I came down th:e 
ijiU to the thofe, whick^^ii the S. W. point of the

ean any one defcribe flg; ^<»*tor and amazemhif ^ 
when I faw the groun^preald with fculls, hands, 
feet, and bones of humiiKbodies ; and particularly I 
perceived a fpace like a Wcle, in the midft of which 
,had been a fire, about which I conjefture'd thefc 
wretches fat^ and unnaturally facrificed and devour- 
cd their ftllow^creatures. 

The horro? and loathfomenefs of this dreadful 
fpeClacle, both confounded my fenfcs, and made me 
difchsrgc from toy 'ftomach in an exceffive manner.

I then returned towards my habitation ; and in nl^ 
way thither, Qiedding floods of tears, and failing 
down on cny bended knees, gave God' thanks for 
making my nature contrary- to thefc wretchesi and 
delivering me fo long out of their hands. 

Though reafbn and nvy long refidence here had aft 
fb red me, that thefe favages never came up to the 
thick woody parts of t.hc country, and that I had no 
leafon to be apprehenfive oii dificoveryj yet fuck an 
abhorrence did. I ftill retain, that for two years after I 
confined myfelf only to nay three pliantations; Imeaa 
my caftle, country-feat, and inclofure in the woods. 
And though in procefs of time, my dfeadful appre- 
benfions began to wear away, yet my eyes were more 
vigilant for fear of being furprifed, ^nd I was very 
cautious of firing my gun, left being heard by thofc 
creatures, they (hould proceed to attack me. I re- 
folvcd, however, manfully to lofe my life if they did^ 
and went armed with three piftols ftuck^in my girdle;, 
which, added to the defcription I have given' of my^- 
felf before, made me look with a very formidable ap- 
pearance. 

Thus my circumftances for fome time remained very 
calm, and undifturbcd; and whea I compared my 
condition to others, I found it was far from being 
miferable. And indeed would all perfons comparfc 
their circuinftances,. not with thpfe above them, but 
with thoie innumerable unhappy objefts benieath 
them, I am furc we Qiould not hear thofe daily mur- 
m»irings and complainings that are in the world. 
For my part, I wanted but few things. Indeed the 
terror which tke favages had put me in, fpoiled fome 
inventions for my own conveniencies. One of my 
projedls was tp brew me fome beerj a very whimfical 
one indeed, When it is confidered, that I had neither 
calks fufficient, nor could I make any to preferve it 
in ; neither had I hops to make it keep, yeaft to makjb 
it work, nor a copper or kettle to make it boil. Pec- 
haps, indeed, alter fome years, I might bring this to 
Ixear^ as J had done other things. But now my in-

fj icBftions were placed another way j and day and night 
I caald think of nothing but how I might deftroy 
t^me of thefe cannibals, when proceeding to their 
tloody entertainments 5 and fo faving a viftim from 
being facrificed,'that he might after become my fer* 
irant. Many were my contrivances fcur this purpofe, 
and as many more objections occuirred, after I had 
batched them. I once contrived to dig a hole under 
the place where they made their fire, and put therein 
five or fix, pounds of gun-powder, whijch would con- 
fequently blow up all thofe that were near it j but 
then 1 was loath to fpend io much upon them, left it 
fliould not do that certain execution I could de (ire V 
and but only affright, and not kill them. Having 
taid this deGgn aiide, I again propoted to myfelf to 
lie privately in ambulh, in fome convenient place, 
with my^hrec guns double loaded', and let fly at therli 
in the midft of their dreadful ceremony ; amd having 
killed two or three of them at every ihot, fall upon 
the reft fuddenly with my three piftols, and not let 
one mother's fon efcape.- This imagination pleafcd 
iny fancy fo much, that I ufed to dream of it in the 
night-time* To put my deQ^n in execution, 1 was 
not long feeking for a place very convenient for my 
i purpofe, where unfepn I might behold every aftioa 
cif the favages. Here I placed my two mulkets, each 
of which was loadii§ vi^h a br^ce of flugs, and four 
or five fmaller bullets about the fee of pi It ol bullets j 
the fowling-piece was charged with hear a handftilof 
th$ largeft fwan-ftiot ; and in ev#ry piftol were about 
four bullets. And thu^ all things being prepared, no 
fooner would the welco ne light fpi^ead over the ele- 
ment, but /Ike a giant refrejhed with wine^ as the fcrip* 
ture has it, would I iSue forth fromxny ea(tle, and 
from a lofty hill, three miles diftant, view if I could 
fee aay invaders approach unlawfully to my kingdom*

I then to concern tn^felf in their fjedding one another"* s

more to kill and devour a captive taken in war^ thaa 
we do to kill an ox, or eat mutton. I then conclu led, 
it neceflarily followed, thaP thefe people ^werc no- 
more murderers than Chriftians, who many times put 
whole troops to the fword, after throwinjg down their 
arms, again I conHdered, that if I fell upon them^ 
1 (hould be as much in the ^rong as the Spaniards, 
who had committed the greateft Ij^rbarities upon thefe 
people who never had offended them in their whole 
lives; as if the kmgdom of Spaii;i was eminent for a 
race of. inen without common a)mpafliop to the mi- 
fcrable, a principal (ign of the moft generous temper. 
Thefe .confiderations made m^^i^^TkiAd brought me' 
10 think I had taken wrong meafnres in my refo* 
Ijitioo; I now argued with myfelf, that it Wus better 
for me never to attack, but to remain undifcoveredas 
long as poiBbly I could \ that an oppcilte condu^ 
would certainly prove deftruftive; for as it was fcarce- 
Ij to befuppofcd I could kill tl^em all^ I might eithef 
be overpowered by the remaining, or that fomc 
.cfcaping, might bring thoufands to my certain de- 
liru^ion. And indeed religion took their part fo 
much as to convince me how contrary it was to my 
duty to be guilty of fliedding human blood, innocent 
as to my particular, whatever they are to one an* 
other*, that 1 had nothing to do with it, but leave it to

to do therein what ftemed convenient to his heavenly 
irifdom. And therefore on my knees I thanked the 
AHnighty for delivering me from blood guiltinefsjand 
begged his proteftion that I might never fall inta 
their hands* 

Thus giving over an attempt which I had raflilf 
begun, I never afcended the hill on that occafi )n af- 
terwards; I only removed my boat, which lay on the 
olher fide of the ifland; and every thing that belong- 
cd to her, towards the eaft, into a little cove, that 

V Acre might not be the le*ft (hadow of difcovery of 
tny boat near, or habitation upon the ifland. My 
caftlethen became my cell,' keeping always retired in 
it, except when I went oik to milk my ihe-goats, and 
order my little flock in the wood ; which was quite 
out of danger; ior fUre I was, that thefe lavages nc« 
ver came here with expedtaiiorts to find any thing,

not pafled through the gloomy vale of death. 

Thefe anxieties of mind, and the care of niy prefer- 
yation, put a period to all future inventions and con- 
"trivances, either for accommodation or convenience J 
I now cared not to drive a nail, chop a ftick, fire a 
gun, or make a fire, left either the noife fliould be

count 1 ufed to burn my earthen ware privately in » 
cave which I found in the wood, and which I made 
convenient for that purpofe ; the principal caufe that 
brought mc here was vto make charcoal, fo that I 
inight bake and drefs my bread and meat without any 
danger. At that time a curious acci(!(ent happened 
me, which 1 fliall now relate; m 

While I was cutting down fomc wood for making 
,my charcoal, I perceived a cavity behind a very thick 
branch of underwood. Curious to look into it, I at- 
tained its mouth, and pfrceived it fufficient for me to 
(hind upright in it. But when I had enter)^d, and 
took a further vi^ew, two rolling flirning eyes, like 
flaming ftars, feemed to dart themfelv^s at me^ fo 
that 1 made all th^ hafte out that I could, as not 
knowing whether it was the devil or a monfter that 
bad taken his reftdence in that place. When I re- 
covered a Uttlc from my furprife, I called tttyfelf a 
ihoufand fools, for being airaid to fee the devih one

i^an end to their (brrow ? '\nd indeed, in fuch a great 

amaz^etncntj was I, that it jftruck me into a cold 

fweat ; ahd had my. hat been on my head, I believe 

, liiy hair would have moved it off. But again encou- 

i*^giog myfelf with the hopes of God's protec- ' 

tion, I proceeded forward, and, by the light of my 

I fire-brand, perceived it to be a moriftrous he-goat, 

f lying on the ground, gafping for life, and dying of 

f mere old age. At firft I ftirred him, thinking to 

: drive him but, and the poor ancient creature ftrJvc, 

(to get upon his feet, but was iSot able ; fo I e'en let 
him He ftill, to aflfright the favages (hould they ven- 
. ture into this cave. I now looked round me, and 
found the place but fmall and (hip^lefs* At tho far- 
ttier fideof it I perceived a fort of aa entrance, jret 

: ' fo low, as muft oblige me to creep on my hands and 
knees to it;, fo^ having no candle, I fufpended my 
^terprife till the next day, and then I came pro- 
vided with two lar^e ones of my own making. 

Having crept upon my, hands and feet through 
thi^ ftrait, I found the roof rofe higher up, I think 
about twenty ieet. But, fui^ely never mortal faw fuch

And indeed it was the mofV delightful cavity or grot, 
to oflts kind that could be defired, though entirely

fowling-pieces and thrcjC mulkets, leaving only five 
pieces at my caftic, planted in the nature of canncwi. 
In a barrel of gun powder,' which I took up out of the 
fea, I brought away about fixty pounds of good pow- 
der,' which were not damaged v and, thefe with a 
great quantity of lead for gullets, I removed from 
my caftle to this retreat, now foFiified both by art 
and natures 

I fancied myfelf now like one cF.the giants of old, 
who were faid to live in caves and holes among the 
rocks, inacceffible to any but themftlves, or, atleaft^ 
moft dangerous to attempt. And now I delpifed both 
the cunning and ftrength of the favages, either to find 
me out, or to hurt me. 

But I muft not forget the old goat, who caufed my 
late dreadful amazement. The poor creature gave 
up theghoft the day after my difcovery; and it being 
very difficult to drag him out, I dug his grave, and. 
honourably intombed him in the fame place where he 
departed, with as much ceremony as any Welch-goat 
that has been interr(?d about the high oiountain P^/;-

of my h:)rvelt| which required my attendance in the

Struck with a terrible forprife, and my ufual ap« 
ftrehen(ions,.£bat the favages would perceive my im- 
provements, I returned dirtflly to my caftle, pulled 
up the ladder after me, making all things look as wild 
and natural as pciTibly I could. In the next place, I 
put myfelf in a pofture of defence, loading my muf- 
ketsand piflols, and committing myfelf to God's pro- 
te£^ion, 1 rcfolvcd to defend myfelf till my laft breath* 
Two hours after, impatient for imdligcnce, I fet my

flat place, and then pulling the hdd^r afrer me, a- 
fcended to the top, where laying myfelf on my belly, 
with my perfpeftive-glals 1 perceived no Icfs than 
nine naked favages fitting round a fmall fire, eating, 
as I fuppofed, human fieQi, with their two caooes 
hauled on &ore, waiting for the flood to carry them

lancholy fight. It^eemed to be a Spanifli vefftl by 
Irs building, ftuck faft between two rocks ; her ftern^ 
and quarter beaten to pieces by the fea ; her main^ 
maff atid foreipafV w€re brought off by the board V 
that is J ^btokjen fhort off. As I approached nearer 
1 perceived a dog 9n board, who feeing me coming*, 
yelped and cried ; and no fooner did I call him, but " 
the pooif creature jumped into the fea, out of which I 
took him up, cilmoA famifhed with hunger and third; 
to that when I gave him a cake of bread, no ravenous 
wolf could devour rt more greedily : and he drank to 
that degree of frelh water, that he would. have bard 
himfelf, had I fuffered him. 

The firft fight I met with in the fliip, were two 
men drowned in the cook room or forecaftle»inclofed 
In one another's arms : hence I very probably fup- 
pofed, that when the vcflel ftruck in the fiorm, fo . 
high and inceflantly did the waters break in and over 
fcer, that the men not being able to bear it, were 
firangled by (he conftant rufhing in of the waves. 
There were fcvcral cafks of liquor, whether wine or 
brandy T could not be pofitive, which lay in the lower 
b61d, as were plainly perceptible by the ebbing out of 
the water, yet were too large for me to pretend' to 
meddle with: likewife I perceived fevcral chtfti, 
which I fuppofed to belong to the feaioien, two of 
vhich I got into my boat, without examining what 
was. in them. Had the fiern of the (hip been fixv-d, 
^nd the fore part broken off, I fhould have m^acle a 
very pcofperous voyage j fince, by what I after f^tind

Searching farther^ I found a caiK, containing about 
twenty gallons, foU oMiquor, which, with fome la- 
bour, I got into my boat 5 in- a cabin were feir era! 
muikctSi which L let remain there ; but took away 
with me a great powder-horn, with about four poundsv 
of powder in it. I took alfo a fire fliovel and tongs, 
two brafs kettles, a copper-pot to make chocoJare, and 
a grid-iron ; all which were extremely neceffiiry to 
me, cfpecially the firc-(hovcl and tongs. And fo 
with thi^ cargo, accompanied with mydogv I came 
away, the tide ferving for that purpoft 5 and the fame,

That night I repofcd my wearied limbs in the boat, 
rcfolving the next morning to harbour what 1 had

not to carry 'my cargo home to my ancient caftle. 
Having refreihed myfelf, ^nd? got ail my tfft£ts on

kind of rum, but not lik-s what we had at the fi» a-

iBAance, I found in one a very fide cife* of bottles,

each bottle held about three pinti, cufrioufly trpt with

exceeding welcome to me, and about one dozen and 
a half of white linen handkerchiefs and coloured 
neckcloths, the former of which were abfolutely ne- 
ceflary for wiping my face in a hot day'; and in the

bring Friday off from hii? horria wayof feeding ; and 
to t^ke from him that inhuman relifti he by nature

let him tafte other flcfh, which might . the father 
tempt him to the fame abhorrence I fo offtsn exprcfl- 
cd againfl their accurfed way of living. Upon which 
one morning I took him out with me, with an inten- 
tion to kill a kid but of the flock, and brittg it home^ 
and drefs it. As I was going, I perceived a (lie-goat 
Tying uown in the ftiade, and two young kids fitting

prefenred my piece, and (hot one of the kids» My

Indeed I was much concerned to fee him in that' 
condition, where nature is upon the fcvereft trial, 
when the immediate. hstnd of tieath is ready to put fbr^ 
ever a period to this mortal life i and indeed fo much 
compaffion hadf I to this creature, that it was^ith 
difficulty I refrained from tears. But however, as 
another fort of countenance was neceflary, aod to 
convince him that I would do him no harm, I took 
him, fmiling, by the hand, then laughed at him, and 
pointing to the kid which I had (lain, made figns to 
him to fetch it, which accordingly he did. No lefs 
curious was. he in viewing how the creature was killed, 
than he had been before in beholding the Indian ; 
which, while he was admiring at, 4 charged my gun 
again, and prefeotly perceived a great fowl like a 
hawk, perching upon a tree within (hot ; and, there- 
fece, to let Friday underftand what I was going to do, 
I called him to me again, pointing at the fowl, which 
I found to be a parrot* I made him underfland that 
I would Qioot and kill that bird ; accordingly I gred, 
and bid him look« when immediately he iaw the par^ 
rot fall down. Again he ftood like one amazed, not- 
withflandlng all I n%d faid to him ; and the more coo-* ^

I afterwards came to vnderftand. 

I nerer ftrove to prevent ,his admiration, nor bin*

occaCoBS} bat when his aftonifhrnent was a littls 
over, I made tokens to him to run and fttch the 
parrot* that I had (hot ; which he accordingly did, 
fiayiog fome time longer than ufval, by.reafon the 
bird, not being quite dead, had fluttered fome way 
farther from the place where Ihe fclL In the roeaa 
time, asi he was looking for her, I rook the advantage 
of charging roy gun agaip, that To I might be ready 
for aey other mark that offered j but nothing more oc- 
curred at that time* So I brought home the kid, and 
the fame evening took off the (kin, and divided 
the carcafe as well as I could. Fart of this flclh I - 
Aewed aad boiled, in a pot I had for this purpofe. ^ 
And then fpreading my table, I fat down, giving my 
man fome of it to eat, who was wonderfully pleafed, 
and feemed to like it very well ; but what was moO: 
furprifiog to him was to fee :.it eat fait with it : upoa 
which he made me to underf^and, the fait was very 
bad for me ; when putting a httle into his mouth ne 
^feemed to naufeateit in fuch a manner, as to fplt 
and'fpntter at it, and then waihedhis moutu with 
freih water: but taihew him how contrary his opi- 
nion was to mine, I pmt fome meat into my mouth 
without fair, and feigned to fpit and fputter as much 
for the want of it, as he. had done at it: yet all this 
proved of no iignification to Friday ; and it was a 
long while before he could endure fait in his meat or 
broth, and even then but a very fmall quantity* 

Thus, having fed him fuflicientiy with boiled 
meat and brpth.at that tiitie, the next day I was re* 
folved to feaft him with a roafted piece of the kidi 
And having no fpit to fallen it, nor jack to turn it,

>came to tafte the fweetnef^ and tendcrnefs of the

fully pleafcd, efpecially when he made it alfo very 
plain to me, that he would never^ while he lived| 
cat man's flefli more. / 

It is now high time I fliould fet diy fervant to 
work ; fo next day I put him to beat out'Tome corn, 
and iift it in the fame manner as I had done before. 
And really the fellow was very quick dnd handy 
in the execution of any thing I ordered him to go 
about. I mskde htm underftand It was to make br^ad - 
for us to eat, and afterwards let him fee me bake it* 
In fhort, he did every thing as I ordered him in a 
linle time as well as I couiJ perform it myfelf. - v 

But now^tonfldering I had two mouths to feed in- 
ftead of one,*it was ncceffary that I muft provide 
more grqjind for my harveft^ and plant a larger quan- 
tity of corn than T commonly ufed to doi upon 
wiiich I marked out a larger piece of land^ fencing it 
in^ in the fame manner as I had done before -, iti

word» that no man could work more hardy, or with

he then very. paiBonately made me underftand, that 
he thought I had much more labour on his account, 
than I Lad for myfelf; and that no p^in^ or diligence *

I believe there i^ no ftate of life but what mzf b<5', 
happyi if people would but cnaeavour for their p«MP| 
to make it fo. He is not the happiefl man that h^t 
the moft: riches,. but he th^t is moft content with 
what he hath. Before I had my fcrvant, I thought 
4nayfelf miferable till I had him ; and now that I en* 
joyed the happy benefits of him, I ftill complained^ 
and begged a deliverance from a place of retirem^ntj 
eafc, and plenty, where Providence had fuflSciently 
blefled me. In a word, frqm this time I entertained 
fdtne hx)pes, that one time or other I might find an 
opportunity to make my efcape from this ifl^md, and 
that this poor favage might be a great furtherance 
thereto^- 

All the time fince my man became fo intelligent 
as to underi'land and fpeak to me, I fpared no pains 
nor diligence to inftruft him, according to my poor 
fhare of knowledge^ in the principle$ of. religion, and 
the adoration that h« ought to pay to the True God* 
One time, as I very well rememberi I a(ked him who 
made him ? At firft the innocent cristature did not un- 
derftand what I meant, but rather thought I a&ed 
him who was his father v upon which I took anomer 
way to make him fenfible, by demanding from him * 
an anfwer to this queftiont Friday, faid I, who is 
^ it that made the Tea, this ground whereon we walkt 
and all thefe hills and woods whiciia we behold ? And 
here indeed I did not mifs of my intention ; for he ' 
told me, ic was old Benamuckee (the god whom I 
fuppofed thefe lavages adored) who lived a great 
way beyond all. But as for his attributes, poor Fri« 
day was an utter ftranger. He could defcribe no* 
thing of this great perfon $ and all that be could fay 
was, that he was very old, much older than the: 
fea and land, the moon, or the ftars. Friday, (faid 
l> again) if this great and old perfon has made all 
things in the world, how comes it to pafs, that all , 
ih-ingSi as you in particolar, do not adore and worfliip 
him ? Upon this, looking^ very grave, with a. perfe^ft - 
fw^et lootol inaocence be replied, Mafur^all things -

fuj O to hlm^ by which it may reafonably be fuppofed 
he meant adoration. And where, faid l, do the • 
people of your 'Country go when they die ? He an-" 
fwered, t^ey all go to Bgnvnuckee. What, and thofe 
people that are eaten up, do they go there^ Bemt'^ 
mackeet faid ho, iove *em dearly ; me pray to Hina- 
mufkee in de canoe ^ and Benamwkee wou*d love me 
^oheh dey eat a me all up* 

Such dtfcourfes a's thefe had I with my m!kn, an(d 
fuch made me fenfible, that the true Q:>ii is worship* 
ped, though under imperfect fimilitude ; and that the 
fatfe adoration which the Heathens gave to their 
imaginary deity, is as great a(n argument of the divine 
eifence, as the mod learned Atheift (falfely fo called ) 
can briiig againf^ it : for God will be glorified in his 
works, let the denomination be what it will ; and I 
cannot be of that opinion which feme conceive, t!iac 
God ihould decree men to be damned for want of a 
right notion of faith, in a (ilace where the wiiUom of : 
the Almighty has not permitted k to be preached ^ 
and therefore cannot biit conclude, that fince obedi* 
. eRce is the belt facrifice, thefe poor creatures, a^ing 
by that light and knowledge which th^ are poflefled 
wiih, may undoubtedly obtain a happy falvation, tho' 
not that enjoyment with Chrift, as his faints, confef* ' 
fors, and martyrs muft enjoy. 

But laying thefe determinations afide, more fit for 
divines than me to difcufs, I began to InilruA my 
fervant in the faving knowledge otthe true Deity, in 
which the dire^lfons of God's Holy Spirit affiled me« 
I lifted up my hands to heaven, and pointing thereto, 
told him, that the great Maker of heaven and earth 
lived there: that as his infinite power £afhioned this 
world out of a confufed chaos, and made it in that - 
beautiful frame which we bnehold, fo he governs and 
preferves it by his unbounded knowledge, fovereiga. 
greatne(sj and peculiar providence ; that he was 
omnipotent, could do every thing for us, give every ; 
tbicrg to us, and take every thing away from us : that 
be was a rewarder and puniflier of good and evil ac-

none but old men, called Ooivaiahit tneaning the

S^fummi^f was an impofiiirey and that their bringing

ibsft proceed from an iufemal fpirit. And here I 
tboij^hc it neceCary to enter into. a long difcourfe with 

rhitn> which I did after this manner: 

Fridavi (iaid I ) you ronft know that before this 
world was^made, there was an Almighty Power cxifting, 
by whole power all things were made, and whofe ma* 
jeily ihall have^o end* To be glorified and adored 
by beings of a^n heavenly nature^ he created angels and 
archangels, that is, glorious fpirits refembling him- 
fclf, to encompafs his throne, eternally iinging forth 
bis praife in themoft heavenly4bunds and divine har« 
mony. And, among this heavenly choir, Lucifer 
bore a great frray, as being then one of the peculiar 
favourites of thefe celedial abodes; but he, contrary to 
that doty he owed his heavenly bovereign^ with, un- 
bounded ingratitude to his divine Creator, not only 
envied him that adoration which was his due, but 
thought to ufurp that throne which he had neither 
power to keep, nor title to pretend to. He raifed a 
diflenfion tod civil vrar in heaven, and had a number 
of angels to take his part. Unbounded folly ! ftu- 
pendous pride ! thus to hope for victory, and afpire 
above his powerful Creator ? The Deity, not fes^rful of 
fuch an enemy, yet juftly provoked at this rebellion, 
commillions his. arch-angel Michael t) lead forth the 
Jaeavenly hoft| and give him battle | the advantage of 

- which was quickly perceived, by Satan's being over- 
thrpwdi and the prince of the air(icr fp tlie devil was 
called) with all his fallen angels, driven headlong into 
a difmai place, which is called HtiL ^ 

The recital of this truth made m^ man give the 
graateft iattention, and he expre^e^vi^afjsat fatisfaftion 
by Jhiii geftures, that God had J^j^ir^^ devil into the

creatures might be tried j in revenge for the difgracc' 
he had received, he tempts Adam's wife live tcrtalle 
cf the tree of knowledge of good and evilj which God 
had forbidden. He appears to her in the (hape of a 
fcrpent, then. a moft beautiful creature, and teljs her, 
th^t it was no better than an impofitlon which God 
had'^ut upon her and her hi:£band, not to eat of that

confequently as great and powerful as he. Upon

Here Friday exprefled a great concern ; Ah^ peer

Friday^ faid I, God ftili loved mankind': and thongh

ihnuld apply ourfclvcs to him by fervent prayer for 
fpeedy rcdrefs. He is jaot like Benamuckee, to let 
none cowe near him but Oeiimkehe^ but fufFers the . 
people as well as priefts to offer themfrlves at his feet, 
thereby to be delivered from the poiver and telupta- 
tioD.of the devil. 

But tboiu^h at firft my man Friday exprefled fomc V 
concern at ibe wickednefsof Zi/r//fr, 1 found it net fo 
eafy to imrrint the right notions of hifii in his mind,* * , 
as it was about the divine eiTcnce of God: for their 
nature^ affiftcd me in all my arguments, to (hew to hitn 
plainly the neceffity of a great firft.Caufe, aa over- 
ruling governing PQwe;r, of a fecret direding Pi'oyi- 
dence, and of the equity and reafonablenefs^ of paying 
adoration to our Creator ; whereas there appeared no- 
thing of all this ID the notion ol an evil fpirit, of his 
£r(\ beginning, his nature^ and above all, of his 
inclination to evil p^ions^ and his power to tempt us 
to the like. And indeed this unlearned /Ww/i, by the 
mere force of nature, puz«led me with one particular ., 
'queflion, more than ever I could have expe£ted« 

1 had, it feemsy one day been talking to him of the 
omnipotent powet of God, and hi^ infinite abhorrence 
of fin, in(omU(:h that the Scriptures fiyled him a con^ 
fuming jire to all the worker? of iniquity 5 and that it 
was in his power, whenever he plealVd, to deftroy all 
the world in a moment, the greatcd part of whtcb are 
continually offending him* 

When, with . a fcrious attention, he had lidened 
a great while to what I faid, after I had been telling 
biro how the devil wa« God's enemy in the hearts of 
men, and ufed all hi» malice and ikilL to defeat the 
good defigns of Providence, and 'dellroy the kingdom 
of Chrift in the world, and To forth, Very well, ma{^

ion may be certain I «ras ftr^mgely furprifed at 
this qiiefiion of my man's ; and th6' an old man, t 
^as but a young dodlor, and confequently very iU 
qualified for a caftiiftt or a refolver of intricate doubts 
in religion. And as it required fome time for mc 
to ftudy for an anfwer, I pretended not to hear 
him, nor to a^ him what he faid : but fo caraeft 
was he for an anfwer^ as not to forget his queftion^ 
which he repeated in the very fame broken words 2i 
itbove. When i had recovered myielf a little, Friday 
faid I| God will at lafi punijh him fevef-ely^ beifig referved 
f^r judgment^ and is to he caft into tlie hottomUJs pit i9 
fefnain ^njire everlafting. But all this did not fatisfy 
Friday; for returning upon me, he repeated my 
words, RESERVE IT LAST, me w undefftand\ but 
why no kill devil nonu^ not kill devil^ greats great ivhili 
ago ? Friday^ faid I, you may as well i&, me why 
God does kill you and me, when by our wicked 
adions we fo much ofFc:nd his Divine Majefty ^ He 
|;tves us time to repent of our fins, ai9d thereby wc

Friday miifed a great while ; and at lafl looking me 
Aedfaftly in the face ; Well^ tudll^ faid he, thafs very

Indeed here I was run down to the laft extremity,

' knowledge of a Deity, and to the homage due to the 
fupreme being of a God ; but however, nothing but

aught I knowr, the Toul of this pcor favage, by 
bringing him to the^fcnowVdgcf of Jefus Chrifl-, it 
caufed a fecret joy to fpread throifgh every part of 
my foul i and 1 frequently rejoiced, tha? ever I was 
brought into this place, which I once thought tbe 
inoft mifer^hle part of the world 

In this thankful frame of mind did I afterwards 
continue, while I aboi'e on the ifland, and for thred* 
years did my man and I live in the greateft erijay- 
ment of happinefs. Indeed I believe the lavage wa^ - 
as good a Chridian as I -, and I hoptf we were equal- 
ly penitent ; and fuca penitents as were comforted 
and rtfVored ^, God's Holy Spirit ; for now we had 
the word of the Lord to inilrodt us in the right way, 
as much as if we had been on the Engliih (horc. 

By the conftant application I nnadc of the Scrips 
tures, as I read them to my man Friday, I earneftly 
endeavoured to make him uhderftand every part of 
it> as much as lay in my power. He alfo, on the 
other hand, by his very ftrious qiieftions and en- 
quiries, made roe a much better proficient in fcrip- 
turc-knowledge than I (hoald have been by my own 
private reading and ft'udy. I muft npt omit another 
thing, proceeding from the experience I had in my 
retirement: it was that indnitc and inexpreffiblc^ 
bleffing, the knowledge of God through Jefus Chriff/T 
which was fo plain and eafy to be unc>crft6od» as im * 
mediately to dired^ me to carry on the great work of 
i? be ere repentance for my (Lns, and laving hold of a 
Saviour for eternal life, to a practical ftated reforma* 
t<on, and obcdienci? to all God's in (truftions, without 
the afliftance of a reverend and orthodox divine; and 
efpecially by this fame inftru^lion {o to enlighten this 
favage ci-eature, as to make him fo good' a Chriiiian 
as very few could exceed hira. And there was only 
this great thing wanting, that I had no authority to 
adminifler the boly facrament, that heavenly partici-

could, the place where the fhip lay, which had been

obferved my man Friday to view this boat with an 
uncommon curiofity ; which when hc^ had done, he 
flood pondering a great while, and faid nothing. At

He replied, 0, Mdfter^ me fee like boat come to pUce at

my man meant ; but examining ftri£lly into'' it, t

th^tls to fay, by his farther explanation, that the 
boat was driven there through violent ftorms and 
flrefs of weather. It then came into my mind, that 
fome European fhip having been caft away, the poor 
diftreffcd creatures were forced to have recourfe to ' 
the boat to fave their lives; and being all, as I thought, 
drowned, I never concerned myfelf to aik any thing 
concerning them, but my only inquiry was about the 
boat, and what defcription my man could give of tt. 
Indeed Friday anfwered my demands very wetl,

130* ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

without any affilUncc, Some days after, Friday aucf I 
being at work, as uAial, at tbe lame time diverting 
ourfelves with various difcourfes* I told him I had a. 
boat which I would bctlow upon him, whenever he 
ple^ifed to return to his own nation : and to convince 
bim of the truth of what Ifaid, I took him with inc 
|o the other fide of the illand, where my frigate lay, 
and then taking it from under the water, (for I al- 
ways kept it funk for fear of a difcovery) we both 
went into i{ to fee bow it would manage fuch an ex« 
pedition* 

And really never could avy be nore dexterous to 
rowing than my faithful fervant, making the boat ga 
as faft again as I could. Wei), now, Friday, faid I, 
lliall we now go to your fo much defired nation? Buf 
inftead of meeting with that chearfulnefs 1 cxprfted, 
he looked very dull and and meUncboly at Ay fayinjg 
fo$ which indeed at fir(i furprifed me, till he made 
me fenfible, that his concern was about the boat's be- 
ing too fmail to go fo far a voyage. Upon which ( 
kt him ui.Jerftand.I bad a much bigger; and accord- 
ingly the next day went to the place where the fir(t 
boat lay, which I had mude, when alt the ftrength t 
bad» or at t I could uTe, failed me in my attempt to- 
get it into the water; but now it bavmg laiiiia tbf: 
fpn two and twenty years, and no care being taken of 
it all that while, it became in a maniser rotten. My 
p»aQ told me, that fuch a boat would do very well to 
the purp'?fo, fufficient tp carry, enough vittle, dring^ 
tread» for that wa^ his manner of talking. In (hortf 
iny mind being tlrongly fixed upon my defign of go- 
ing over with him to the continent, I very plainly 
told him, that we would both go and make a boat full 
as big, and more proportionable than that, wherein be 
inight iafely rerurn to his own nation. 

Xhcfe words made Friday look fa very penfiye that 

I thought he would have fallen at my feet It was fome 

time before he could fpeak a word, which made me 

mjS^ him what was the matter with him ? He replied

quickly, mafter you do great deal much good^ you teach 
ail de wild mam to be gcod ta^ne mans; you learn dem to be

Iftiide than venture among fuch inhuman favages* 
Go your way, fince you defire it, and kave.me alone 
by myfelf, as I was before I faved your life* 

Never was any creature more thunder^ftruck thaa

ties of friendfhip which many tiories furpals ihofe dl

tyeen my, fervant and me :* inftead of which there 

^ was tlhe greateA gratitude, and the moft fricere love ; 
he found me not only his deliverer, but his preferver ,- 
and coqaforter; not a fevere and cruel tyrant, but a 
kind, loving, and affable friend He wanted *or ho 
inann^r of fuftenance; and when he was ill, or out of 
order, I was his phyfician, not only for his body, but 
his foulVand therefore no wonder wa& it, that fucb 
an innocent creature, lonjg flnce diverted of his former 
natural cruelty, ihould have an uncommon concern at 
fo cruel a fep^ration from me, which pierced him to 
the very foul, and made him defire even 10 die, rather 
than live without me. 

After I had told Friday^ in a very carclefs mariner, 
that he (hould be at his liberty as foon f^s the boat 
was mude, the language of his eyes exprcffed all ima-

I was forced to comfort him in the beft manner I

me not car£ to be in my nation ^ leave. you here ; tne d^ire

was for the converfion of that barbarous people* 
But as I had no apofiolic miffion, nor any coneern a- 
bout their falvatioui fo I had not the leaft intemioa 
Or defire of undertaking it: and the ftrengtli of my 
inclination) in order to efcape^ proceeded chiefly from \ 

my late difcourfe with Friday about theie feventeea 
white*bearded men that had been driven upon the 
barbarian coaft, whom I defigned^to joiq^ as the only 
tneans to further our efcape. To which intent my 
man and I went to fearch for a prober tree to fell» 
whereof we might make a large periagua or canoe, to 
undertake the voyage : and indeed we were not long 
in finding one fit for our purpofe, there being enough 
of wood in riie ifland to have built a fleet of large veP

-one fo near the water, that we might launch it after 
it was £ni{bed, and not commie 1*0 horrid*a miftake

Well, after a.great Jfearchfor what wasbefl:and

But though my man exceeded me in the knowled^ 

* .^f the moft proper tr^e, yet I (hewed him a much better 
ind chaner way to, make a canoe than ever he kneifr 
before : for he was for burning the hollow or cavity 
of the tfee^ in order to make this boat; but 1 th^n 
told him bow we might doit with tools, learning hr^ 
at the fame time how to ufe them, which indieed he 
did very dexteroufly ; fo that in a month's labour wt 
finiflied it, making it very handfome, by cutting tfic 
outiideinto the tr^ie fhape of a boat. After tl\is, it 
took us a full fortnight before we could get her in(o 
the water, wHich we did, as it were, inch by incK| 
upon great rollers : but when fhe was in, ihe coul4 
k have carried twenty men^ with all the eafe imagiaa-

As I was very well pteafed, you maybe fure, at 
the launching of this man of war offline, I «v^s no 
Icfs amazed to behold with what dexterity my man 
would manage her, turn her, and paddle her along. 
Well, Friday, faid I, what do you think of it now ? 
i;Do you think thlswiil carry us over? Ties^ MafUr^

But mydeiign was yet farther, which he was infctifi-

that was no difficult thing at all to procure *, fo I^x«

near the place, great plenty 9^ it abounding in the

forwaat of needles, at length I finilhedathree corner- 
ed ugly tiiingi like what we call in England a (houlder- 
of»matton fail^to go with a boom at bottom, and a 
little fmall fprit at the top, like tTiofe which 6ur long 
boats ufe, and which I very well knew how 10 managei, 
efpecially fince it wa9 Uke that which I had in my pa* 
Iron's fi(hing boat, when with my boy Xury I made 
my efcape fronT the Barbarian fhore. 

It was sear two mojaths^ I think, before I com^ 
pleated tbis work, that is, the riggjqg, aod fitted my 
maft and fails-; indeed they were nicely done, having 
fnade a fmali ftay, and a fail, or foreiail to it, to aiu(i, 
if we ihould turn to the wefiward ; and, which ^was 
ftill m*ore, I fixed a rudder to the ftcrn of her, to 
lleer with ; and though I was but a very indifil'rcjnt 
fliipwright, yet, as L was fenfible of the great ufeful* 
nefs and abfolute necefiity of a thing like this, I applied 
myOdi to it with fuch a conAant application, that at 
laft I accomplifhed my defign ; bur what wkh the 
many dull contrivances I had about it, and the failcrre - 
of many things, it coft me as much pains in orderiog 
as In making the boat. Befidts, when all this was 
doae, I had my man to teach what belonged to its na- 
vigation : for thongh he very well underflood how to 
paddle a canoe along, he was an utter Aranger to a fail 
and rudder, and was amazed when be faw me work 
the boat to and again in the fea, by them, and bow^ 
the fail gibbed and filled this way or that way, as the 
courfe we failed changed* After fome time, and a 
little ufe, I made ail thefe things very familiar to him, 
fo that he becamje an expert failor, except in relatioa 
to the cpmpafs, and that I could make him understand 
but little of. But as it happened, there was feldom 
occafion for it, there being but little cloudy "weattxer^ 
and fcarce ever any fog in thole parts $ theft&rs were 
always vifibie in the night, and the (hore perfpicudtos 
by day, except in the rainy feafon, which confined 
every ope to his habitation* 

Thus entered -^ip the fcTcn and twentie.h year of 
my reign,, or captivj|i;y> which yoE pjealie, (the laft

three of whicb, bleiTed with the company of ttif 
msn Friday, ought not to be reckoned) I kept th^ 
anniversary of my landing here, with the fame thank-* 
fubefs to God, for his tender mercies, as I did be* 
fore ; and certainly, as I had great catrfe for a thank* 
ful acknowledgment for my deliverance at firft, I 
had much greater now, for fuch lingular and addi« 
tional tedimonies of the care of Providence over me, 
in ill my diRrcSes^ both of body atni mind, and the 
great hopes I had of being effectually and fpeedily de« 
livered ; for I had a (Irong imprefSon upon my mind, 
that I fhould not be another year in this ifland. But, 
however, I ftill continued on with my hufbandry, dig- 
ging, planting, and fencing as ufuai y gathering and 
curing my grapes, and doing all other things that 
wore neccffary. 

And now the rainy feafon beginning to come on^ ^ 
-obliged me to keep the longer within doors/ but be- 
fore this, I brought, my new vcffel into the creek| 
where I ^had landed my rafts from the fhip, And hauU " 
^ ing her up to the ihore, I ordered my man Friday 
to dig a dock iuiiicient to hold her in, and deep e*^ 
nongh to give hep water, wherein (he might firoat ; 
and then, when the tide was outj we madea Arong 
dam croCs the end of it, to keep out the water 5 by 
which means ilie lay dry, as to the tide from thefea ; 
and to keep the rain from hei*, we thatched her ovcrj 
as it were, with boughs of tr^es, like a houfe ; and 
f) we waited for the months of November nnd De-

No fconer i5id the feafcnr.ble w*2th<T begin to draw 
near, but lb n;iuch was 1 elevated with tiiis new de- 
figned adventure, that I daily prepared for th^ voy-.

Thus prepared, I thought as well of myfelf as any

took my pi^rfpcfttve glafs, and went up to the fide of

and twenty favages, three priibners, and three canoes^ 
and that their chief concern feemed to be the tri- 
' umphaot banquet upon the t^ree'poor human bodies; 
a thing which by this time I had cbferved was very 
common with them. I alfo reqiarked that they did 
not land at that place from whence Friday made his 
efcape, but nearer to the creek, where the Ihore was 
low, and where a thick wood came vtry clofe to the 
fea« My foul was then filled with indignation and al^- 
horrenceat foch inhuman wVctchcs, which put a pc* 
riod to all my former thoughts in their vindication: 
tieither would T give myfelf time to confider their 
right of conqueft, as I had donebefore ; but defcend- 
Ing from the mountain, I came down to Friday, and 
told him) I was refoUed to go fpeedily to themAalid

pomdcrous load of armour, like two invincible cham« 
pions, with a^uantity of powder and bullets to ftand' 
our battle, and load again, when the pieces were dif- - 
chared* And now my orders being to be obeyed, I 
charged Friday to keep clofc behind me, and not to 
flip, ojp fhdot, or attempt any thing till I commanded " 
him; and, in the interim, not to fpeak fo much ?f 
one word. It was in this order I fetched a compafs 
' ta the right hand, of near a mile, as well to ^gef or r 
the crefrk, as to attain the wood; by this I thought 
to come within (hot of them before I could be di/«

who were a parcel of naked unarmed wretches, but 
rhiefe reflexions occurred to my thoughts ; What 
power was I commtilloned with, or what occafion or< 
neceffity bad I to go and imbrue my hands in human 
fa^ood, and murder people that had neither done nor* 
intended to do me any wrong ? They were innocent' 
in particular as to- me ; and their barbarous cUftotiF 
was not onjy their misfortune, but a fign that God' 
bad left them in the moft immenfe (lupidity ; but yet 
did tiot warrant me to he a judge of their actions,

that, on the contrary^ whenever he thought fit, he 
W9tud take vengeance on them fatmfelfi and puni(h

tree) anS then I afcended to a little rifing groand, not 
above eighteen yards diftance, and there i had a full 
▼lew of thefe creatures, and 1 could perceive all their 
«ftions4 

Such a JGght did then appear, as obliged me not to . 
lofe a moment's time. No lefs than nineteen of the(e 
dreadful wretches fat upon the grouhd, clofe huddled 
together, expreffing all the delight imaginable at fa 
barbarous an entertainment ; and they had juft fent 
other two ^o murder this poor unhappy Chrifttan^ and 
bring him limb by limb to their fire \ for they were 
juft then going to untio the bands from his feet, in 
order for death, as fetters are knocked off the feet of 
malefaAors before they go to the place of execution* 
Hereupon, immediately turning to my man,^ Now^ 
Friday, fatd I, mind w^t I fay, fail in nothing, but 
do exa^ly asyou fee me do* All which he promiilag 
he would perform, I fe( down one of my muikets and 
the fowling-piece upon the ground, and Friday did 
the fame by his $ and with the other mofket I took 
roy $im at thefavagesj bidding him do the like : Are 
you ready? faid T. Tes tnafier^ faid he. Why then 
fire at them, faid I \ and thax very moment I gave fire 
likewife. 

I only killed one, and wounded two ; but my man 
Friday^ taking his aim much better than I, killed two, 
and wounded three. You may be fure they were in a 
dreadful conAernation, at fuch an unexpe^d difailer ; . 
and thofe who yet hadefcaped our penetrating fhor, 
immediately jumped upon their feet, but were in iucU t. 
confufion, that they knew not which way to run jor 
look, not knowing from whence their de(^ru£lion 
came. We then threw down our pieces, and took up 
others, giving a fecond diVa^ful volley \ but as they* 
were loaded only with fwan-ihot, or fmall piftol- bul- 
lets, we perceivcd.only two of them fall •, though ma- 
ny were wounded^ who run yelling and fcreaming a« 
bout like mad creatures. Now Friday, faid 1, lay

thought he had killed them all, by reafon of their 
hlling to the bottom of the boat *, however, he killed 
two, and mortally wounded a third. In the mean 
time, I cut the flags that tied the hands and feet of 
the poor creature, and llfring him up, alked him in 
the Portugtiefe tongue. What he was? He anfwercd 
me in Latin^ Chriftianus s bulfo very weak ai>d faint,

courage and intrepidity, that be cut two of them to

pieces we had left 'at the tree, which he brought me

fierce encounter benveen the Spaniard and one of the 
iavages, who had made at him with one of their

as could be expected, having twice woui)ded his enemy

had thrown him upon the ground, and \^as wrefting 
my fword out of his hand, which the Spaniard very 
wifely quitting, drew out his pittol, and ihot him

took his arms and ancles, which were fiiff and nuiubed

inake a kind of a hand-barrow j and when I came to 
my caftle, not betog willing to make an entrance into

r ordered Friday to lie ftill^ till fuch time as I came

now afcended, in order to difcover ihore fully what' 
they were: ajid now with the help of my perfpeftive-

concluded it to be, by the fa(hionof4ts long boat! 
and which filled me with fuch uncommon franfports^ 
oT joy, that I cannot tell how to defcribe; and yet 
fome fecret doubts hung about me, proceeding from I

Which very often are given, when he may imagine' 
there is no poffibHity of its being real: liad not I been 
warned by this (ilent admonitton, I had been in i 
vorfe iituattoD than before, and perhaps inevitably 
ruined* 

Not long it was, before I/perreived the boat to aj^ 
proach the fhorc, as though ti^ey looked for a place 
where they might conveniently land ; and at laft they 
ran their boat on ftiore upon^the beach, above half a 
mile's diftadce; which proved fo nwich the ha jipier 
fdr inc, fince, had- they come into tbe creek, they 
had landed jaft at my door laod might hot only have 
forced me out of my eaHle, but pluhde'red me of all 
Thad in the world. Now I was fully convinced they 
were all Englifhmen, three of whom Ivere unarmed

Thus elided our bloodj battle with the b^fls, having

as we went, our ears were fainted with their moft un-

we placed burfelves, and the horfcsin the centre, they 
exceedingly reprehended us, and told us, it was an,^ 
hundred to one, but we had all been deltroyed ; for 
that it was the very fight of the horfes, their fo much 
difired prey, that made the wolves more fagingly fu* 
rious than they would have been, which was evident, 
by their being at other times really afraid of a gun : 
but then being exceeding hungry and furious, up;>n 
that account, their eagernefs to come itt the horfts 
made them infenfiMe oF their danger ; and that if we 
had not by a continual fire, and at lall by the cunning 
ilratagcra of the jtrain of powder," got the better of 
them, it had been great odds if their number had nc^

alighted from our horfes, and fought them with thaf 
courage and condudl, which, had we failed to do, c- 
▼cry man of us, with our bealh, had bccu devoured : 
and indeed this was nothu^g but truth; for never 
in my life was I fo fenilole of danger, as when 
three hundred devils came roaring upon us, to'Qiun 
whofe unwelcome company, if 1 was fure to meet a 
fiorm every week, I would rather go a thfufand leagues

I think I have nothing uncommon in my pailage

fet forth. From Thouloufe I travelled to Paris, 
from thence tb Calais, where I took (hipping, and 
landed at Dover the 14th of January, in a very cold 
feafon. « 

Thus, conie to the end of my travels, I foon di& 
covered my new found eftate^ and all the bilk of ex« 
change I bad brought were currehtly paid. The 
good ancient widow, my only pcivy couni'ellor, thought 
no pains nor care great enpugh to procure my advan^

which drew from me. an ample re ward« I was for

Upon thi$ account I refolved to fell my plantation ; 
and for that intent I wrote to my old friend at Liibon, 
who returned me an anfwer to my great fattsfadfion \ . 
which was,^ that he could fell it to good account: how*

account, that they not only williogly accepted the of- 
fer, but that they had alfo remitted 33,000 pieces of 
eight to a correfpondent of their own at Lifbon, in 
order to pay for the purchafc. 

Hereupon in return I figned the inftf ument of falc 
according to form, which they had fent from Lifbon^ 
and returned it again to my old friend, he having^ent 
tnc for my'cftate, bills of three hundred twenty eight 
thoufand pieces of eight, relerving the payment of 
one hundred moidores per annum, which Uiad allow-

in a]y thoughts a ftranger to the world: my privy

I locked around me in this bufy world, one part la-

their eflates, this put me in mind how I lived in my 
little kit gdom, where both reafon and religion diftated 
to me, that there w?s fometbing that certainly was 
the re'afon and end of life, which was far fupcrjor to 
what could be hoptd for ocl this fide the grave. My 
country delights were now as iniipid and dull, as rou- 
Cc or fcience to thofc wlio have neither taftc nor in- 
genuity. Jn fliort, refolving to leave cfF boufe-keep- 
i"g» I left my farm^ and in a few months returned to 
London. 

tut neither ccuM that great city, fp frfmoos for it« 
Tariety of entertain raenr, afford me any agreeable de- 
Hght : a ftate of idlenefs I fi iind to be the very dregs 
of life, and moft hurtful to body a«d foul. It was 
now the beginirg of tnc year 16^4^ at which time my 
nephew (whO| as I before obferved, had been brought 
• tip to the fea, and advanced to be captain of a (hip) 
was returned from a fliort voyage to Bilboa, the firlt

and fetrled my eAate m fuch a manner, that I was per*

take more care, or underftood that office better: 
for which I lived to reward, and return her my hearty

we heard the welcame report of your guflti when», 
with ui^rpeakable joy, talcing down our oiaAs and 
fails, we were refolved to lie by till momiog; but 
perceiving your lights, wefet our oars at work to keep* 
our boat a-head, tbe fooner to attain your (hip, the 
bappy inftrutnent of our deliverance* 

Indeed no one can expr^ft the joy of thefe poor 
creatures on thi« occafionj fear and grief are eafilf 
ftr forth f fighs and tears^ with a {€W motuHis of the 
hands and head, are all demonftrations of thefe paP 
fi:>ns; but an excefs of joy carries in it a tboufand 
extratragancies; efpecially, I rhink, mrnoogft the 
French, whofe temper is allowed to be more volatile, 
paffionate, fprightly, and gay, than that of other na* 
ttons. Some were weeping, tearing themfelves in the 
greateifl agonies of forrow, and running ftark mad a* 
bout the (hip ; while^ the reft were jhimping withr 
their feet, wringing their hands, finging, laughing, 
fwooning away, vomiting, fainting, with a few return- 
ing hearty thanks to the Almighty, and croffing them* 
. felves* I thinky if I am not mifts^eo, our furgeoa 
was obliged to let thirty of them blood. But among: 
the paflengers, there were two priefts» the one an old» 
and the other a young man; but what amazed me 
snore, was, that the oldeft was ia the worfl plight \ 
for no (ooner did be perceive himfelf freed from dan* 
ger, but hedropi down, as it were without life, and» 
to every one's appearance« quite dead \ but the fwgeon^ 
chaffing and rubbing hit arm, opened a vein, which 
at firft dtopped^ and tbeo dewing more freely, the 
old man began to open his eyet^ aad m a qoarter of 
an hour was well again. Bat bon remembring his 
happy change, the joy of which whirled his blood »- 
bout fafter than the vefieb covld convey it, he became 
lo feveri(h, as made him more |k for bedlam then any

and fo ran to help him up; but he oiodef^ly toM me^ 
he was returning fii« thanks to the Almighty, defire- 
ing me to leave him a few moments, and that, next 
to his Creator, he would return me thanks alfo. And 
indeed he did To, about three minutes after, with 
great ferloufnefs and affeftion, while the tears ftood 
in his eyes, which convinced me of the gratitude of 
his foul. NW did he Itfs fticw his piety and wifdom^ 
in applying himielf to his country people, and labour- 
• '^ in^ to compofe them, by the moft powerful reafons, 
arguments, and perfuafions. And when, indeed^ 
ihofe people had taken their night'$ rtpofe, in fuch 
lodging as our ihip would allow, we found nothing but 
the bed of manners, and the moft civil acknowledge* 
ments, for which the French are eminently remark- 
able. The jxc%t day the captain, and one of the 
priefts, defired to fpeak with m^ and my nephew, 
the commander. They told us, rnat they hadfaved 
fome money, and valuable thing$ out of the ruined 
xe&lf which was at pur fervice ; only that they de* 
(ired to be fet on (bore fome where in our way. At 
the firft my nephew was for accepting the money ; 
but I (who kmew.how hard my cafe lyould have been, 
had tbe Portuguefe cafTain ferved me fo) pcr/naded 
him to the contrary $ ^nd therefore told them, that 
as we had done oothing but ^hat we were obliged to 
do, by nature and humanity, and what we ourfelves 
might expert from others in fuch calamity ; fo we 
took them up to fave jthem, not to plunder them, or 
le^ve them naked upon theiand, to perilh for want of 
fubfiftance, and therefore would not accept their mo* 
ney : but as tolandingthcm,that was a great difficulty i, 
^ for, being bound to the £a(l Indies, it was impoifible 
wilfully to change (pr voyage upon their particular 
.accoun|, nor could my nephew (who was under char- 
ter-party to purfu<^ it by way of Jirafil) anfwer it to the 
freighters. AU that we could do, was to nut ourfelves I

great concern, efpecially the paff&ngers, at their beings 
'^ qirried to the Eaft Indies. Tbey begged therefore £

we fbould carry them to Marltoicoiii the Weft Indies.. 
But as it happened^ in a week's fimei we made the .

Certainly it would melt a man of the firmed refolu- j

a quarter of an hour together. After this, he would 
lie upon the grodnd, ftroke his legs, and kifs them, 
fhen g^t up and ftare at him, as though he was be- 
witched: but the next day one could not forbear | 
laughter to fee his behaviour, for he would walk feve- I 
ral hours with his father along thf ihore, leading him f 
by the hand, as though he was a lady; while, every 
now and then he would run to the boat, to get fomc- 
thing for him, a luH>p of fugar, dram, bifcuit, orYbmc- 
ihing or other that was good. His froffcs ran in an-

terpofe as a mediator, by obliging the two Lnglifhmeii 

Hot to hurt themi being naked and tinarmed ; and 

that the (Jthcf three fhould make" them reditutionji 

by building their two huts, and fencing their ground 

in the Tame manner as it was betore. Well, being 

in a miicrable condicion, they fubaiitted to this at 

prefenr, and lived fome time regularly enough, 

except as to the wor Icing part, which they did not care 

for, but the Spaniards would have djlpenfed with 

' that, had they continued eafy and quiet. Their 

arms being given them again, they fcarcc had them 

a week, when they became as tr^ublcfome as ever-, 

but 8a accident happening foon after, obliged us to 

lay afide private rcKntments, and to iook xmr cvuj.-wIL 

prefervation. 

One night, Sir, I went to bed, perfeftly well, in 
I health, and yet by no means could I compofe myfelf 
, to fleep: upon which being very uneafy, I got up,, 
and looked out ; but it being dark, i could perceive; 
nothing But the trees around our caftle ; I went to 
bed again, but it was all one, I could not fleep | whetk 
one of my Spaniards hearing me walk about, aiked 
' who it was up? I anfwered, it is I.'^When I told 
him the occafiou i Sir, faid he, fucli things are not to

of my Spaniards went up the mountain, not by the 
ladder, but through (^e grove \ and then we were 
[ ftruck with a panic fear on feeing a light, as though 
^ it were a fire, at a v^ry little distance, and bearing th^

Indeed the darknefs of the night gave them opportu- 
nity enough to view them (by the light of their fire) 
undifcovered. As they were indifferent pjifrtie^, and 
Rraggling over the fliore, we were much afraid that 
they (hoiild find cut our habitations, ^nd deftroy our 
flocks of goats; to prevent whichi we fent an Englini* 
man and two Spaniard^ to drive the goats into the 
valley where the cave lay; or, if there w;\s oGcalioo, 
into .the cave iifelf. As toourfelves, reiuming our 
native courage, and prudent conduft, had we not

It lafted near two hourSi till that party which was 
neareft to our caflle bf gan to decUnei and at laft to 
Hy from their conquerors. We were undoubtedly put 
int^ a great confternation on this account: left they 
ibould run into our^grbve, andxonfeqaently bring us 
into the, like danger. Hereupon we rcTolved to kill 
the firft that came, to prevent difcovery; and that too - 
with our fwordsy and the butt end of our muflcets, 
for fear the report of our guns ihould be heard. 

And (b indeed, as we thought, it happened: for 
three of the vanquiflied army croffing the creek, ran 
direAly to the pUce, as to a thick wood for (helter; ' 
nor was it long before our fcout gave ut notice of it ; 
as alfo, that the viftors did not think fit to purfue 
them. Upon this I would «ot fuffer them to be flain^ 
but had them forprifed and taken by our party; and 
afterwards they proved very good fervants to 11s, be* 
ing ftoxn young creatures^ and able to do a great deal 
of work. The remainder of the conquered favages 
fled to their canoes, and put out into th-e ocean, while 
the conquerors joining togetner, (houted by way of 
,trtutnph» and about three in the afterooon they alfo 
embarked for their own nation. Thus we were freed 
at once from the favages and our f?ars; not perceiving 
any of rhefe creatures for fomeconfilerabletioie after. 
We found two and thirty men dead in the field of 
battle; fome were (lain with long arrows, which we. 
■ found (licking in their b)dies ; and the rtd were kill- 
ed with great unwieldy wooden fwords, which denoted 
their vjrit ftreogth, and of which we found feventeen, 
befides bows and arrows: but we could not find one 
wouiided creature among them alive ; for they either 
. kl4I their enemies quite, or carry thofe wounded away 
with ihero. « , . 

This terrible light tamed th? Englifhmcn for &i|ie 
time, confi;if ring how unfortunate they might have 
been, had taey fallen into their hands, who would 
not only kill them as eneo^ies, but alio for food, as

but more tra^ble to the coaamon neceflary buGnefs 
of the whole focietVi planting, fowingy and reapiog, 
with the greateft figns of amity and friendflbip^ fo 
that being now all good friends, we began to confider 
of ctrcumftances in general ; and the firft thing we 
thought of, was, whether, as we perceived tlie la- 
vages haunted that fide of the iiland; and there being 
more retired parts of it, and ye| as well Tutted to our 
manner of living, and equally to our advantage, we 
ought not rather to move our place of refidence, and 
and plant it in a i^uch fafer place, both for the fecuri* 
ty of our corn and cattle. 

After a long debate on this head, it was refolved, 
or rather vof ed, mmrne contradicente^ not to remove our 
ancient caftle, and that for this very good realon, 
that /ome time or other weexpeftcd to hear from our 
fupreme governor, (meaning you Sir) W.iofc meflengers 
not finding us there, might think the plarce deoioliOi- 
cd, and all his fubjefts deftroycd by the favagps ' 

As to the next concern relating to our corn and cat- 
tle, we confented to have them removed to the valley 
where the cave was, that being mol^ proper and fuffi* 
cient for both. But yet, when we conildered further, 
we altered one part of our refolution; which was, to 
remove part of our cattle hither, and plant only part^ ' 
of our corn there; fo chat in cafe one part was deitroy- 
cd the othet; might be prefcrved* Another refolution 
we took, which really had a great deal of prudence in 
it;, and that waS| in not ^rulHng the three lavages 
whom we had taken prtfoners, with any -knowledge ♦ 
of the plantations which we had made in tbe valUy, 
of what number of cattle we bad there, mu^h lels of 
the cave, wherein we kept feveral arms, and two bar- 
rels of po»vder you left for us, at your departure from

1 to the top of the bill, without fo much as leaving a 
> paflage for ourfelves except by the ladder ; which be- 
ing taken down, nothing but what had wings or witch^ 
; craft could pretend to come near us. And indeed 
this was exceedingly, well contrived, ^fpeciaily to ferve 
that occafioni for which we afterwards found it ne-* 
ccflaVy. 

Thus we lived two years in a happy retirement, 
having all this time not one vifit from the favages* 
Indeec one morning we had an alarm, which put us 
in fome amazement ; for a few oi my. Spaniards being 
out very early, perceived no lefs than twenty canoes^ 
[ as it were ccming on fhorci upon which, returning 
^ home, with great precipitation, they gave us the alarm, 
ip^hicb obliged us to keep at home all that day and ^he 
next, going out only in the night- time to make our 
oh'>vation: but as good luck would have it, they", 
were upon another defign, and did not. land at that 
time upon the iflaod. 

But now there happened aoother quarrel between 
the three' wicked Englifhmen, and fome of my Spa>* 
niards. The occafion was this : One of them being 
enraged at one of t^e favages, whom he had taken 
prifoner, for not1>eing able to comprehend fomething

a great' fury, not to corred):, but to kill himj yet

f hem in pciTrliioo, I obliged them Iblemnly ro fwcar, 
never to attempt any thing againfl us or their country-

in^ no remedy, they took what proviilon was giv^pn

About Svetlays after, they came to thofe limits ap-

Six months did they live in this feparate condition, 
in which chey got their firft harveft in, the qiiaiuiry 
of which was but fmall, becaurethey had planted but 
little land: for indeed, all their plantations being to

But a new whim poiTcfled theie rogae? aboot three 
' quarters of a year after^ which had like to have roin* 
ed us and themfelves too:. for^Jt feems bctag tired^ 
and weary of this fort of living, which made them

condition, nothing wouidTerve them, but th^y would' 
make a voyage to the continent, and try if they could 
feiz« upott^ (otr.e of the favages, and bring them over 
as flaves, to do^their drudgery, while they lived at cafe- 
and pieirfure. 

Indeed'the projeft was not fo prepofteroos, if tfary 
had not gone nirther; but they neither did, nor pro- 
fKrfcd any thmg, but what had fhifchief in the defign,

If tfcey were mtirdered, that was nothing to us» there

ebfldreo to cry after them } naj» fo intent were they 
tupon their voyage, that if the Spaniards had nor given 
tltem armf , fo they bad but the cimoe, they would have 

-gene without them. 

Though we could not well fpare our fire-arms, ra- 
ther then thev £h.oiild go like naked men, we let theiti 
have two mulkerf « a piAol« a cotlaf?, and three hat- 
chets, which^ere thought very fu^ctent: we gave them 
atfo goats flefb, a great Jbafket full of dried grapes, a pot 
of frefh buttef, a young live kidji and a large canoe 
fufficient to carry twenty men. And thus, with a 
maft made of a long pole, and a fail of fix large gont 
fkins dried, haying a fair breeze, and a flood tide wiih

them another fort of reception than what they ex- 
pefted br dcfired: for as the favages were armed with , 
bows. and arrows, they dard not venture on ihore« but 
fieered northward, fix or feven hours, till they gained 
an openingi by which they plainly perceived, that the 
land that appeared from this place was not the main 
landy but the iiland. At their entrance into the 
opening of the fea, they difcovered another iflaod, on 
the right hand northwardi and feveral more lying to 
the weftward; but being rcfolved to go oq fhore focne 
where or other, they put over to one of the weftern 
iflands. Here chey found the natives very cottrteous^ 
' to them^ giving them feveral roots and dried fiA^ 
nay, even their women too were as willing to fopply 
them whh what they conld procure them" to eat, 
bringing it a great wny to them upon their beads. 
Among thefe hofpitable Indians they continued fome 
days, inquiring by figns and tokens, what nations lay

But when the poor creatures perceived themielvcs 
placed in a row, and feparated one by one, they were

Bat anotbei' obfervation I made was» in favour of 
.the tw6 honeft men^ to (hew what difparitj there is 
between a diligent application to bufinefs oH the one 
hand, and a flothful, negligent, and idle tempert on 
the other. Both of .them had the fame parcel of 
ground bid out, arid corn to (bw, fufHcietit for them ; 
but both did not make the fame improvements, either 
in their cultivation, or in their planting. The. two 
honed m^n had a multitude of young trees planted 
abou" their habitations, fo that when^you approach* 
ed near them, nothing appeared but a wood, very 
pleafing and delightful. Everything they did prof* 
pered and flourilhed ; their grapes planted in order, 
feemed as tho* managed in a vineyard, atyd were in- 
finitely preferable to any of the others. Nor were 
they wanting to find out a place of retreat^ but dug a 
^ave in the moft retired part of a thick wood, to ie« 
cure their wives and children, with their prOvifion and 
cbiefeft goods, furrounded with innumerable flakes, 
and hating a mod fubtle entrarqe, in cafe any mif- 
chief ihould happen either from their fellow country- 
men, or the devouring favages. 

As to the reprobates, (though I muft own they 
were much more civilized than before,} inftead of a de- 
lightful wood furrounding their dwelling we^ found 
the words of King Solomon too truly verified; I iveni 
by ih, vitkyard of thejlothful^ and it was all overgrtivn iviih

weeds; the hedges having feveral gaps ia them, the 
wild goaits bad got in, and eaten up the corn, and here 
and there was a dead bufh, to flop in thofe gaps for 
the present, which was no more than fliutting tHe 
flable* door after the fleed was ftolen away. But as to 
tlieir wives, they (as I obferved before) were mor^ di-

Engliihmen's habitation, to h>lp them in their bufi-

tbcr they did not guard then ftriAly, or that they 
thou^t they ^ould not better themfelvcs, I cannot 
tell; but certainly one of them ran away Into the 
ipvoods, and they could not hear of him for a long 
time after. . 

Undoubtedly there was reafoh enough to fuppofe 
he go^ home in forae of the canoes, the favages re- 
turning in about four weeks time, and going ofF in the 
fpace of two days. You may be certain. Sir, this 
thought could not but terrify us exceedingly, :ind make

^untrymen of our abode in the ifland, bow few and

cxpeftcd it would not be long before the Englifhmeu 
would be attacked in their habitations; buMhe fa- 
vages had not (ecn thefr places of fafety In the wood^, 
fior our caftle, which it was a great happinefs they 
did not know. 

Nor were we miftaken in our thoughts upon thii

with about ten tnen in each canoe, came failiag by the^

they next eonfidered, whether they fhauld fire at the

came direftly towards the yee. H^eupon they rc- 
ibUed to take them in a direft line, as they approach-

In our psl^ge we tduched at the Htand of MadA«.

tliefc treaties, however, there is one principal thing, 
to be re'garded, that neither party come beyond an- 
other's three p^les.or boughs^ fo that the aiiddle

gone fifty yards before we came up with the boatfwairi>' 
with four of our meo at his heels, all of them cover- 
ed with blood and dull* and in fearch of more people 
to fatiatc their vengeancs. As foon as we faw them 
we called out, aqd made them untferftand who we^ 
were ; upon which they cadie up to us, fetting up a 
halloo of triumph, in token that more help was come. 
Noble captain, faid he.to my nephew, I'm glad youVc

Indeed here was enough to fill their breafts with 
rage, which however I thought had gone too fir^a- 
greeable to thefe words of Jacob to his fons Simeon

their nvrathjhr it tms cruel. But this light made my 
nephew and the red a& l>ad as they : nay, my n*phew 
declared, his concern was only for his men; as for 
the people not a/oul of them ought to live. Upon 
this the boatfwain and eight more dircftly turned a- 
1)out, and weni to finiili the intended tragedy; which 
being out of my power .to prevent, I returned back « 
both from the difmal fight, and the piteous^ cries of

and To return to Bengal in the company's' Ihipsi 

Thus refotved/ we agreed, that if our pilot wottid go

or England ; ihd to give him in a prefent the fucM of 

170 pounds Sterlings Hereuponi' we called him iitf

we foon put him out of that concern, by making him

would fet him fafe on ihore, God wiUing, either to 

Mufcovy, or England, as he plejtfed, at our own

When we came to th« city of JtraweQa, we refted 

five daf Sf and then entered Into a frrghrful defarr^ 

which held us twenty-three days march, iafeded vVh 

feveral fraall companies of robbers, or Mogul Tartar^, » 

who never had the courage to attack us. After we 

had puffed over this defart, wc found Teveral gafrifons 

to dcT*nd the cacavans (r6m the vialence of the Tar« 

tars. In particular the governor of Adinikoy offered 

us a ^uiird of fifty men to the next Aation» if we ap» 

prehendeJ any^ danger.' The people here retained the 

th« famepaganirm and barbarity, only they were not 

fo dangerous, being conquered* by the Mufcov ires. 

The clothing, both of men and women, is of the Ikins 

c^beafts; lining under the ground in vaults and caves, 

which have a communication with one another. They 

have Uots almofl in every family ; beflies, they aJore 

t he fun and ilar^, water and fnow) and the lead un« 

common thing that happens in the elements, alarms 

them as mhch as thunder and lightning does the un- 

Wfie^ing Jews 

Nothing remarkable occured ifi oar march through 
this couoftry. When wc had got througi the delart, 
after two days further travel, we came to Jrnezo, ^ 
Mufco^te city J On the great rivet fo called, xvhi<ih, 
we were told, parted ^rope from Afn. Th>, irfha-

I inlorm my reader of what was obferved' to me, that* 
the Czar rather con verts the Tartars with folJiers th^a 
clergymen, and Is more proud to m^ke them faithfwd

From thi« city to^ the river Oby, we travcHed'ovcr a

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 2$6 

-Chap. V* Of the prefent fiate of religim in iht world. 

I doubt, indecd» thcFC is much more deirotion tha^ 
religton in tb€ world, more adoration than fupplicatior, 
and more bypocriiy th^ finceritft and it is. very roe. 

~ lamrholy nr confider, what Dumbers of people there 
are fiirniihed with the powers of reafon and gifts of 
^nature, and yet abandoned to the groif;:]) ignoraqce 
and depravity. But it would be uncharitable for us 
to icatfgrne (as fonie Paptfts abounding i^ith too much 
ilUnature, tbeonly icandal to religion, do) that they 
Will certaiQly be in the ftate ok daainatton after this. 
li^e 5 for how can we think it confident with, the mer- 
cy and good nefs of an infinite Being, to damn thofe 
creatures, whtn he has not furniihed them with the 
Ught of his^ofpel J or how can fuch prbucl» conceited, 
and cruel bigots^ ptcfcribe rules to the jatuce and mer*» 
cyof God? 

We are told by fame people, that the great loisge

criminals were carried in proceflion to the great church, * 
where eight of tbem were habited in gowns and capi

And indeed, upon this account, we have perceived 
in all Chriftian countries what mortal feudS have b<cn 
about religion -: ^hat wars and blood (hed have tnolell- 
-ed Europe, till the general bacification of the Gsrnjan « 
troubles at tLe treaty of Weftphalia; and/ince'thofc 
tVmts, what perfecution in the lame country among . 
tjie churches of the Lutherans! and ftiQuid I take ft

bytery, the church of England men and the diflenteri?; 
oppofing one anothcrlikeSt. Paul and St. Peter, even 
to the faccj that isj they carry on the diljpute to the 
litmoft extremity, ' - 

It might be a qaeftion, why tjiere are fuch diffMV 
<:nces in religious points, and why thefe breaches fliDuld' 
be more hot and irrecf ncileable ? All the anfwer I can 

-give to this, is, that we inquire more concerning the 

^ truth of religion", than any other nation in the world; 
iCnd the anxious concern we have about it, m^kes us 

cj-alousof every opinion, and tenacious of our own : 

-. and this is not becaufc we are more furious and raih 
than other people; but the truth is, we are mor^f con- 
cerned about them, and being Tenfible that the fcri'V 
tilfe is the, great rule of faith, the ftandard for life and 
ffo(^rine^ we have recourfe to it burfelves, without 

; fubmitting to any pretended infallible judge upon 
earffa. * ' ' .

Before 1 conclude this chapter, I (hall b::g1ea¥^*

like the Pnarifce, with, God, I thank thee ; it is a pid 
of rcli jioas pageantry, the hypocrite's hops ; and, 4l

wayman : no! I livv; a fpbcir, regular retired life: Im 
a good man, I go tochurch, God, I tbmk thee. Na*i 
though a man boafts of his virtue in coptradiition tj

ately words flowed from his pen, like ftreams frooi

from the impreffion made on his mind by the former^ 
he went to fleep again and dreamed the fame dreanv 
a third time alfo. So troubled was he at thisi that he 
aroffi and knocked at his mother's chamber, told his 
concern, and his apprehendons that all were not right

I very much wopder, that you> being a perfon in holy

this he went to bed again, fell afleep, and dreamed a 
fourth time as before. And then indeed he put on his 
night. gown, and went to Smithfield^ the place wherd 
his relation dwelt^ Here it was, alas ! he perceivec \ 
his dream too fadly fulfilled, by feeing his relation, tho 
ycong lady, big with child, who was a Proteftant, . 
Aabbed in feven places, by her barbarous hpibuid Mr* 
Euftace, a violent Papift, only fp^ fome difcourfes of

wretch had ftabbcd her innhree places, he went to 
make his efcape out at a window; but Ihe cried out^ 
Afy dear^ donU leave me^ come back^ and I Jh all he well, 
again* "At which he returned in a helUQi rage, and 
gave her four wounds more 5 when, even in this con- 
dition, rifing frottv her bed, (he wrapped herfelf ia 
her night- gown, and went to the lord bifhop of

leveral friends, who advifed 'him to take the advice. 
But; after all, it was not an apparition,, bat a grate 
and pious gentleman, who met him by mere a^cidenr^ 
and bad been fenfible ot his wickednefs ; and who never 
undeceiv<ed' him, Ie(^ it (hould hinder his reformation- 
Were we always wHlitig to make good ufe of Satan> |

way to banifti him from the vilible world ;. for i aoi} '

his coming would do us any good : but fo abfoliitcly ir 
he at the command of Heaven^, that he muft go, evea 
to do the work he abhors.
