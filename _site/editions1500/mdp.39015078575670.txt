THESE are the adventures,
very strange and queer,
That happened to Miss Crusoe
only just last year;
How she went a'sailing, how
she stayed awhile,
Along with little Thursday, upon
a desert isle.
Nobody has ever seen such won-
drous sights before;
I don't suppose that anyone will
see them any more.
They all are most amazing, and
curious as can be,—
Oh, how I wish such funny things
would happen you and me!
This is how, in

are

I said, "Though at home it's
extremely jolly,
I'm not a stay-at-home sort
of dolly;
I must see the world, and I'm
going to do so,
As sure as my name is Dorothy
Crusoe!"
How, in
Chapter Two,
I became a Captain
and Crew.

So I took a ship, the best I
could find,
A craft of the sixpenny-half*
penny kind,
And I tell you I felt extremely
brave,
As I sailed away o'er the
foaming wave.
Chapter Three,
I am chased by a fish
at sea.

. s
But a fish of most enormous
size,
Suddenly jumped before my
eyes,—
I shrieked aloud as the ship
he followed,
I was perfectly sure I was
going to be swallowed.
Chapter Four,
A storm begins to roar.

Now, a fearful storm began
to blow,
And the monster suddenly
dived below.
I grasped the tiller and reefed
the sail,
But to tell the truth, I felt
rather pale.
Chapter Five,
I am wrecked—but
still alive.

Then something happened I
didn't expect,
The storm got worse and the
ship got wrecked,—
And there, on a desert island's
sands,
I sat and cried with my face
in my hands.
And there, on a desert island's
Chapter Six,
I am in a terrible fix.

But I was attacked—and nearly
knocked down—
By horrible creatures pink
and brown.
One I faced—but when there
were two,
I ran like anything—so would

In Chapter Seven, how
I began to be rather hungry
soon,
For I always have my dinner
at noon,
When I suddenly spied, on the
shingle stuck,
A tin of milk—Oh, wasn't it
luck!
Chapter Eight,
I got dry, at any rate.

I was soaking wet from top
to toe,
I said " I shall catch a cold, I
know!"
So I took my clothes off one
by one,
And hung them up to dry in
the sun.

There happens
something fine!

I just ivas feeling lonely and
gloomy,
When I saw a figure ap-
proaching to me.
I just ivas feeling lonely and
I waved and shouted—What
do you think?—
'Twas a dear little girl as
black as ink.
Chapter Ten,
I am able to talk again.

Side by side on the shore we
sat;
We talked of this and we
talked of that,—

She was telling me, Thursday
was her name,
When three most hideous
savages came.
I show my courage now!

I fired one shot, and they took
to flight,
But it put poor Thursday all
in a fright:
She trembled and shook at
my pop-gun's roar—
She never had heard such a
noise before.

I made short work, you see,
of the fighting!
But the next adventure was
still more exciting:
A fierce wild Bunny, with all
its brood
Attacked us—just as I thought
it would.

Thursday was rather a
coward, you know,
She looked at the Bunny, and
yowled "Oh! Oh!"
Do you think I minded?—no,
not a bit,
I flung a lasso and captured
it!
Chapter Fourteen,
A wondrous change
is seen.

And then it became so meek
and mild,
It might have been stroked by
the smallest child.

Why, even Thursday — quite
brave for her,—
Crept behind it and patted its

I said " I wish I were back at
home,
For just one reason— I haven't
a comb."
But Thursday brought me a
curious shell,
And said "Me fancy this do
as well!"
Will show you what I
mean.

"Missie," said Thursday,"Me
comb your hair,
It am berry long, it am berry
fair."
The comb was scratchy—but
she was so good,
I tried to bear it as well as
I could.

How hard I worked that

After this, she brought me a

And then we made a ladder—
or anyhow, she did.
It took a long time, but at
last we succeeded;
High in a tree we found a
seat,
And talked to each other of
things to eat.
Chapter Twenty,
Adventures come in
plenty.

But just as we thought of
having our tea,
We saw a ship as close as
can be;
We waved a flag, and we
hailed like mad,

Chapter Twenty-one,
I meet with a friend—
what fun!

They sent a boat, very spick
and span,
With an officer and a sailor«
man.
When I saw his face, I was
ready to drop—
I had met him last at my
native shop!
Chapter Twenty-two,
They rescue us—yes,
they do!

His name was Lieutenant Toby
Trim,
What fun it was being rescued
by him!
And the odd thing was, that
I didn't mind
Having to leave the island
behind.

I become Mrs. Toby T.

The Lieutenant said, "When
you have been carried
Safely home, suppose we get
married!*'
And so we were! as you might
have guessed:
I was dressed in blue—it suits
me the best.
And so we were! as you might
Chapter Twenty-four,
I talk of the isle once
more.

And now the island is left
behind,
And I've my children and
house to mind.
But I think of my old adven-
tures yet,
And I've written them down,
so I shan't forget.
And if you should run away
to sea,
Try to be almost as brave as
me:
But of course I hope you will
never do so!
Yours ever, DOROTHY
