FARTHER ADVENTURES' 

OF 

ROBINSON CRUSOE, &c. 


H aving thus given an Account of the Colony in 
general, and pretty much of my five Runagate Eng- 
Itsbmen^ I mujft say something of the Spaniards^ who were 
the main Body of the luimily; and in whose Story there 
are some Incidents also remarkable enough. 

I had a great many Discourses with them about their 
Circum^f ances when they were among the Savages :They^ 
told me readily, that they had no Inj^tances to give of their 
Aj)plication or Ingenuity in that Country ; that they were 
a poor miserable dejeited Handful of People; that if 
Means had been put into their Hands, they had yet so 
abandon’d themselves to Despair, and so sunk under the 
Weight of their Misfortunes, that they thought of no- 
thing but Starving : One of them, a grave and very sensi- 
ble M?in, told me, he was convinc’d they were in the 
'ong; that it was not the Part of wise Men to give up 
.emselves to their Misery, but always to take Hold of 
le Helps which Reason offer’d, as well for present Sup- 
port, as for future Deliverance. He told me that Grief 
vasthe mo^l senseless insignificantPassion in theWorld ; 
for that it regarded only Things pajft, which were generally 
mpossible to be recall’d, to or be remedy’d, but had no 
/iew to Things to come, and had no Share in any Thing 
.hat look’d like Deliverance, but rather added to the Af- 
Tftion, than propos’d a Remedy: And upon tjiis, he re- 

VOL. Ill b 



2 Farmer Adventures <^Robi^nson Crusoe 

peated a Spanish Proverb ; whicli' tho’ I cannot repeat in 
juft the same Words that he spoke in, yet I remember I; 
made it into an English Proverb of my own, thus : 

In Trouble to be troubl'd^ 

. Is to have your Trouble doubl'd. 


He ran on then in Remarks upon all the little Improve _ 
ments I had made In my Solitude ; my unweary’d Appli _ 
cation, as he call’d it, and how I had made a Condition 
which, in its Circumftances, was at firft much worse thai ^ 
theirs a thousand Times, more happy than theirs was 
even now, when they wereall together. He told me, it wa. 5 
remarkable, that Englishmen had a greater Presence o f 
M ind in their Diftress than any People that ever he me t 
with ; that their unhappy Nation, and the Portuguese, -vrcTi ; 
the worft Men in the World to ftruggle with Misfor . 
tunes; for that their firft Step in Dangers, after the com _ 
mon Efforts are over, was always to despair, lie dowi x 
under it, and die, without rousing their Thoughts upt< j 
proper Remedies for Escape. 

' I told him, their Case and mine differ’d exceedinglyj^ 
that they were caft upon the Shore without Necessaries} ^ 
without Supply of Food, or of present Suftenance, ’til 1 
they could provide: That it is true, I had this Disadvan;. 
tage and Discomfort, that I was alone ; but then the Suji_ 
plies I had providentially thrown into my Hands, by thL 
unexpefted driving of the Ship on Shore, was such a HelA> 
as would have encourag’d any Creature in the World Wj 


have apply ’d himself as I had done. Seignior, says thje 
Spaniard, had we poor Spaniards been in your Case, Wje 
should never have gotten half those Things out of th^^ 
Ship, asjroudid : Nay, says he, we should never have foun(|i 



farther Adventures o/RobinsonCrusoe 3 

Means to have gotten sf Jlaft to carry them, ®r toliave got- 
ten *he Raft on Shore without Boat or Sail ; and hot(r much 
less should we have done, said he, if any of us had been 
alone? Well, I desir’d him to abate his Compliment, and 
go on with the History of their coming on Shore, where 
they landed, he told me, they unhappily landed at a Place 
’where there were People without Provisions; whereas 
had they had the common Sense to have put off to Sea 
again, ahd gone to another Island a little farther, they 
had found Provisions, tho’ without People; there being 
an Island that Way, as they had been told, where there 
was Provisions, tho’ no People ; that is to say. That the 
Spaniards of ^rinidadYrsA frequently been there, and had 
fill’d the Island with Goats and Hogs at several Times; 
where they have bred in such Multitudes, and where T ur- 
tle and Sea-Fowls were in such Plenty, that they could 
ha’ been in no Want of Flesh, tho’ they had found no 
Br^d ; whereas here, they were only sustain’d with a few 
Roots and, Herbs, which they understood not, and which 
had no SubSlance in them, and which the Inhabitants 
gave them sparingly enough, and who could treat them 
no better, unless they would turn Canibals, and eat Mens 
Flesh, which wa»the great Dainty of their Country. 

■ They gave mean Account how many W ays they Strove 
to civilize the Savages they were with, and to teach them 
rational CuStoms in the ordinary Way of Living, but in 
vain ; and hoW they retorted it upon them, as unjuSt, that 
they who came there for Assistance and Support, should 
attempt to set up for Instructors of those that gave them 
'Bread; intimating, it seems, that none should set up for 
the In^ruCtors of others, but those who could live with- 
out them. 

They gave me dismal Accounts of the Extremities they 



4 Farther Adventures o/RobinsonCrus(!Ie 

were driven to; how sometime? ‘they were many Days 
withotTt any Food at all ; the Island they were upon being 
inhabited by a Sort of Savages that lived more indolent, 
and for that Reason were less supplied with the Neces- 
saries of Life, than they had Reason to believe others 
were in the same Part of the World ; and yet they found,, 
that these Savages were less ravenous and voracious, than 
those who had better Supplies of Food. 

Also they added, That they could not but see with 
what Demonstrations of Wisdom and Goodness the go- 
verning Providence of God diredls the Events of Things 
in the World ; which, they said, appear’d in their Circum- 
stances ; for if press’d by the Hardships they were under, 
and the Barrenness of the Country where they were, they 
had search’d after a better Place to live in ; they had then 
been out of the Way of the Relief that happen’d to them 
by mylMeans. 

Then they gave me an Account, how the Savages, 
who they liv’d among, expefted them to go. out with 
them into their Wars; And it was true, that, as they had 
Fire-Arms with them, had they not had the DisaSIer to 
lose their Ammunition, they should not have been ser- 
viceable only to their Friends, but have^made themselves 
terrible both to Friends and Enemies ; but being without 
Powder and Shot, and yet in a Condition, that they could 
not in Reason deny to go out with their Landlords to 
their Wars ; when they came into the Field of Battle, they 
were in a worse Condition than the Savages themselves ; 
for they neither had Bows or Arrows, nor could they use 
those the Savages gave them ; so that they could do no- 
thing but ^and ^ill, and be wounded with Arrows, till 
they came up to the Teeth of their Enemy ; and then in- 
deed the three Halberds they had, were of Use to them ; 



Farther Adventures o/RobinsonCrus/>e 5 

and they would'often dtive a whole little 5^rmy before 
theift with those Halberds and sharpen’d Sticks put into 
the Muzzles of their Muskets ; But that for all this they 
were sometimes surrounded with Multitudes, and in 
great Danger from their Arrows, till at laft they found 
•the Way to make themselves large Targets; of Wood, 
whicK they cover’d with Skins of wild Bea^fs, whose 
Names they knew not; and these cover’d them from the 
Arrows of the Savages; that notwithstanding these, they 
were sometimes in great Danger, and were once five of 
them knock’d down together with the Clubs of the Sa- 
• vages, which was the Time when one of them was taken 
Prisoner ; that is to say, the Spaniard, whom I had reliev- 
’d, that at firSl they thought had been kill’d: But when 
afterwards they heard he was taken Prisoner, they were 
under the greateSf Grief imaginable, and would willingly 
have all ventur’d their Lives to have rescu’d him. 

They told me, That when they were so knock’d down, 
the reSl of-their Company rescu’d them, and Stood over 
them, fighting till they were come to themselves, all but 
him who they thought had been dead ; and then they made 
their Way with their Halberds andPieces, Standing close 
together ;n a LinS, thro’ a Body of above a thousand Sa- 
vages, beating down all that came in their Way, got the 
Viftory over their Enemies, but to their great Sorrow, be- 
cause it was with the Loss of their Friend; who, the 
other Party, finding him alive, carry’d off with some 
others, as I gave an Account in my former. 

. They descr ib ’d moSt affectionately, how they were sur- 
priz’d with Joy at the Return of their Friend and Com- 
panion in Misery, who they thought had been devour’d 
by wild BeaSts of the worSt Kind, {viz.) by wild Men ; and 
yet how more and more they were surpriz’d with the Ac- 



6 Farfher Adventures <?/ Robinson Crusoe 

count he gave them of his Erraiid, and that there was a 
Christian in ahy Place near, much moreone that was fble, 
and had Humanity enough to contribute to their De- 
liverance. 

They describ’d how they were astonish’d at the Sight 
of theRelie/I sentthem, and at the Appearance of Loaves, 
of Bread, Things they had not seen since their coming to 
, that miserable Place; how often they cross’d it, and 
bless’d it, as Bread sent from Heaven ; and what a reviv- 
ing Cordial it was to their Spirits to taSte it ; as also of the 
other Things I had sent for their Supply. And aRer all, 
theywouldhavetoldmesomethingofthe Joy they werein, 
at the SightofaBoat and Pilots to carry them away to the 
Person and Place from whence all these new Comforts 
came ; but they told me it was impossible to express it by 
Words, for their excessive Joy, naturally driving them to 
unbecoming Extravagancies, they had nowaytodescribe 
them, but by telling me that they border’d upon Lunacy, 
having no way to give Vent to their Passion, suitable to 
the Sense that was upon them ; that in some it work’d one 
Way, and in some another ; and that some of them, thro’ a 
Surprize of Joy, would burft out into Tears; others be 
^tark mad, and others immediately faint. This Discourse 
extreamly affedled me, and call’d to my Mind Friday's 
Extasy, when he met his Father, and the poor People’s 
Extasy, when I took them up at Sea, after their Ship was 
on Fire; the Mate of the Ship’s Joy, when he found him- 
self deliver’d in the Place where he expected to perish ; 
and my own Joy, when after 2 8 Years Captivity, I found , 
a good Ship ready to carry me to my own Country. All 
these Things made me more sensible of the Relation of 
those poor Men, and more affefted with it. 

Having thus given a View of the State of Things, as I 



Farther Adventures o/koBiNSONCRUSOE 7 

found them, I mu^l rSUte the Heads of what*I did for 
these People, and the Condition in which J left them. It 
was their Opinion and mine too, that they would hfe trou- 
bled no more with the Savages ; or that if they were, they 
would be able to cut them off, if they were twice as many 
^ as before ; so they had no Concern about that. Then I en- 
tred into a serious Discourse with the Spanidrd, whom I 
call Governor, about their Stay in the Island; for as I was 
not come to carry any of them off, so it would not be juft 
to carry off some, and leave others, who perhaps would be 
unwilling to ftay, if their Strength was diminished. 

On the other hand, I told them, I came to eftablish 
them there, not to remove them; and then I let them 
know, that I had brought with me Relief of sundry Kinds 
for them ; That I had been at a great Charge to supply 
them with all Things necessary, as well for their Con- 
venience, as their Defence ; and that I had such and such 
particular Persons with me, as well to encrease and recruit 
their Nujjiber, as by the particular necessary Employ- 
ments which they were bred to, being Artificers, to assift 
them in those things, in which, at present, they were to 
seek. 

They were all together when I talk’d thus to them ; and 
'before F delivered to them the Stores I had brought, I 
ask’d them one by one. If they had entirely forgot, and 
bury’d the firft Animosities that had been among them, 
and would shake Hands with one another, and engage in 
a ftrift Friendship and Union of Intereft, that so there 
might be no more Misunderftandings or Jealousies. 

tVill. Atkins^ with Abundance of Frankness and good 
Humour, said. They had met with Affliftions enough to 
make them all sober, and Enemies enough to make them 
all Friends ; that for his Part, he would live and die with 



8 . Farther Adventures ^Robinson Crusoe 

them; and was so far from desigij?ng any. Thing against 
the Spaniards, ^hz.t he own’d they had done nothing to 
him, but what his own mad Humour made necessary, 
and what he would have done, and perhaps much worse 
in their Case ; and that he would ask them Pardon, if I de- 
sir’d it, for the foolish and brutish Things he had done to 
them; and Was very willing and desirous of living in 
Terms of entire Friendship and Union with them; and 
would do any thing that lay in his Power to convince them 
of it; and as for going to England, he car’d not if he did 
not go thither these twenty Years. , 

The Spaniards said. They had indeed at fir^f disarm’d 
and excluded IVilL Atkins and his two Countrymen for 
their ill Conduft, as they had let me know; and they ap- 
peal’d to me, for the Necessity they were under to do so : 
But that Will. Atkins had behav’d himself so bravely in 
the great Fight they had with the Savages, and on several 
Occasions since; and had shew’d himself so faithful to, 
and concern’d for, the general Intere^ of thenj all, that 
they had forgotten all that was pa^t, and thought he me- 
rited as much to be trufled with Arms, and supply ’d with 
Necessaries as any of them; and that they had te^ify’d 
their Satisfaction in him, by committing the Command 
to him, next to the Governour himself. And as they had an 
entire Confidence in him and all his Countrymen, so they 
acknowledg’d they had merited that Confidence by all 
the Methods that hone^ Men could merit to be valued, 
and trusted; and they mo^l heartily embrac’d the Occa- 
sion of giving me this Assurance, that they would never 
have any Interest separate from one another. 

Upon these frank and open Declarations of Friend- 
ship, we appointed the next Day to dine all together ; and 
indeed we made a splendid Feaft; I caused the Ship’s 



Farther Adventures o/R obinsonCrusoe 9 

Cook and his Mate to cfc^ne on Shore, and dress our Din- 
ner ;»and the old Cook’s Mate we had on Shore, assisted. 
We brought on Shore six Pieces of good Beef, and four 
Pieces of Pork out of the Ship’s Provision, with our 
Punch-Bowl, and Materials to fill it; and in particular, 

^ I gave them ten Bottles of French Claret,and ten Bottles of 
English Beer; Things that neither the Spaniards^ or the 
English Men had tasted for many Years; and which, it 
may be supposed, they were exceeding glad of. 

The Spaniards added to our Feaft five whole Kids, 
which, the Cooks roasted; and three of chem were sent 
cover’d up close on Board the Ship, to the Seamen, that 
they might fea^t on fresh Meat from on Shore, as we did 
with their Salt Meat from on Board. 

After this Fea^t, at which we were very innocently 
merry, I brought out my Cargo of Goods, wherein, that 
there might be no Dispute about dividing, I shew’d them 
that there was sufficient for them all ; and desir’d that they 
might all jtake an equal Quantity of the Goods that were 
for wearing ; that is to say, equal when made up ; as firft, I 
distributed Linnen sufficient to make every one of them 
four Shirts ;andatthe 6'/>^?«wrii^Reque^tafterwards,made 
them up six; these were exceeding comfortable to them, 
having Been what, as I may say, they had long since for- 
got the Use of or what it was to wear them. 

I allotted the thin English Stuffs, which I mention’d 
before, to make every one a light Coat, like a Frock, which 
I judged fitte^l: for the Heat of the Season ; cool and loose, 
and order’d, that whenever they decay’d, they should 
make more, as they thought fit: The like for Pumps, 
Shoes, Stockings and Hats, ^c. 

I cannot express what Pleasure, what Satisfaftion, sat 
upon the Countenances of all these poor Men, when they 



I o Farther Adventures 0/ Robinson Crusoe 
saw the CTare I had taken of them,5nd how well I had fur- 
nish’d them; they told me, I was a Father to them, «nd 
that having such a Correspondent as I was, in so remote 
a Part of the World, it would make them forget that they 
were left in a desolate Place; and they all voluntarily en- 
gag’d to me not to leave the Place without my Consent. 

Then I {Presented to them the People I had brought 
with me, particularly the Taylor, the Smith, and the two 
Carpenters, all of them mo^l necessary People ; but above 
all, my general Artificer, than whom they could not name 
any thing that was more useful to them. And the Taylor, 
to shew his Concern for them, went to work immediately, 
and, with my Leave, made them everyone a Shirt the fir^ 
Thing he did; and which was ftill more, he taught the 
Women, not only how to sew and ^itch, and use the 
Needle, but made them assi^ to make the Shirts for 
their Husbands, and for all the reft. 

As to the Carpenters, I scarce need mention, how use- 
ful they were, for they took in pieces all my clymsy un- 
handy Things, and made them clever convenient Tables, 
Stools, Bed-fteads, Cup-boards, Lockers, Shelves, and 
every thing they wanted of that kind. 

But to let them see how Nature made Artificers at firfl, 
I carried the Carpenters to see IVi//. Atkins' % 'Basket- 
house, as I call’d it, and they both own’d they never saw 
an In^ance of such natural Ingenuity before; nor any 
thing so regular, and so handily built, at leaftof its Kind : 
And one of them, when he saw it, after musing a good 
while, turning about to me, I am sure, says he, that Man 
has no need of us,you need do nothing but give himTools. 

Then I brought them out all my Store of Tools, and 
gave every Man a Digging-Spade, a Shovel, and a Rake, 
for we had no Harrows or Plows; and to every separate 



Farther Adventures c/RobinsonCrusoe ir 

Place, a Pick-axe, a Crow, a broad Axe, an d a Saw ; always 
appointing, that as often as any were broke*, or worn out, 
they should be supply ’d without grudging, out of the 
general Stores that I left behind. 

Nails, Staples, Hinges, Hammers, Chissels, Knives, 
. Scissars, and all sorts of Tools, and Iron-work, they had 
without Tale, as they requir’d, for no Man would care 
to take more than they wanted, and he muft be a Fool that 
would wa^i: or spoil them, on any Account whatever; 
andfor the Use of the Smith, I left twoTonofunwrought 
Iron for a Supply. 

My Magazine of Powder and Arms, which I brought 
them, was such, even to Profusion, that they could not 
but rejoice at them ; for now’they could march as I us’d to 
do, with a Musket upon each Shoulder, if there was Oc- 
casion, and were able to fight a thousand Savages, if they 
had but some little Advantages of Situation, which also 
they could not miss of if they had Occasion. 

I carry’d on Shore with me the young Man, whose 
Mother was starv’d to Death, and the Maid also ; she was 
a sober well educated religious young Woman, and be- 
hav’d so inoffensively, that every one gave her a good 
Word ; she had indeed an unhappy Life with us, there be- 
ing no Woman in the Ship but herself; but she bore it 
with Patience. After a while seeing Things so well or- 
der’d, and in so fine a way of thriving upon my Island, 
and considering that they had neither Business or Ac- 
quaintance in the EaU-Indies^ or Reason for taking so 
long a Voyage: I say, considering all this, both of them 
came to me, and desir’d I would give them leave to remain 
on the Island, and be enter’d among my Family, as they 
call’d it. 

I agreed to it readily, and they had a little Plat of 



1 2 Farther Adventures o/Robinson Crusoe 

Ground allotted to them, where tfiey had three Tents or 
Houses set up, surrounded with a Basket-work, Pallisa- 
do’d like adjoiningtohisPlantation:TheirTents 

were contriv’d, so that they had each of them a Room 
apart to lodge in, and a middle Tent like a great Store- 
house to lay all their Goods in, and to eat and drink in ; 
and now the other two English Men remov’d their' Ha- 
bitation to the same Place, and so the Island was divided 
into three Colonies, and no more, viz. the Spaniards with 
old Friday, and the fir^ Servants, at my old Habitation 
under the Hill; which was, in a Word, the capital*City ; 
and where they had soenlarg’dand extended theirWorks, 
as well under as on the outside of the Hill, that they 
liv’d, tho’ perfedUy conceal’d, yet full at large. Never was 
there such a little City in a Wood, and so hid, I believe, in 
in any Part of the World ; for I verily believe, a thousand 
Men might have rang’d the Island a Month, and if they 
had not known there was such a Thing, and look’d on 
purposefor it, they would not have found it ; for the Trees 
^lood so thick and so close, and grew so fa^l matted into 
one another, that nothing but cutting them down firft 
could discover the Place ; except the only two narrow En- 
trances, where they went in and out, Could be^ found, 
which was not very easy ; one of them was juft down at the 
Water-edge of the Creek, and it was a||erwards above 
two hundred Yards to the Place ; and the otl^wasup the 
Ladder at twice, as I have already form m|^ liescrH>’d 
it ; and they had a large Wood thick plantea^^Hsci^ftl^ 
Top ofthe Hill, which contain’d above an Acre^,'^^|§h 
grew apace, and cover’d the Place from all Discovery 
there, with only one narrow Place between two Trees, 
not easy to be discover’d to enter on that Side. 

The other Colony was that of W. Atkins ' where there 



w w 

Farther Adventures o/RqbinsonCrusoe 13 

were four Families of F/tglish Men, I mean those I had 
left there, with their Wives and Children ; fhree Savages 
that were Slaves ; the Widow and Children of the En^ish 
Man that was kill’d ; the young Man and the Maid ; and 
by the way, we made a Wife of her also, before we went 
,away: There were also the two Carpenters and the Tay- 
lor, who I brought with me for them ; also the Smith, who 
was a very necessary Man to them, especially as a Gun- 
smith, to take care of their Arms; and my other Man, 
who I call’d. Jack of all Trades ;who was in himself as good, 
almoS, as 20 Men, for he was not only a very ingenious 
Fellow, but a very merry Fellow, and before I went away, 
we married him to the honeft Maid that came with the 
Youth in the Ship, I mention’d before. 

And now I speak of Marrying, it brings me naturally 
to say something of the French Ecclesia^ic that I had 
brought with me out of the Ship’s Crew, who I took up 
at Sea. It is true, this Man was a Roman, and perhaps it 
may give Offence to some hereafter, if I leave any Thing 
extraordinary upon Record, of a Man, who, before I be- 
gin, I muft, (to set him out in ju^l Colours) represent in 
T erms very much to his Disadvantage, in the Account of 
Protestants ; as JirSl, that he was a PapiSt ; secondly, a 
popish Prie^ ; and thirdly, a French Popish PrieSl. 

But Justice demands of me to give him a due Charac- 
ter ; and I naui^ay, he was a grave, sober, pious, and moSt 
religious ; exaft in his Life, extensive in his Chari- 

ty, ah 4 f«xB|)lar in almoSt every Thing he did ; what 
thctt^caii any one say, againSl my being very sensible of 
the Value of such a Man, notwithstanding his Profession? 
Thb’ it may be my Opinion, perhaps, as well as the Opin- 
ion of others, who shall read this, that he was mistaken. 

The firSt Hour that I began to converse with him, after 



« « 

1 4 Farther Adventures 0/ Robinson Crusoe 
he had a*greed to go with me to,l3nLe Ea§i-Indies, I found 
Reason to dejight exceedingly in his Conversation; and 
he fir^ began with me about Religion in the moft oblig- 
ing Manner imaginable. 

Sir, says he, you have not only, under God, (and at that 
he cross’d his Breaft) sav’d my Life, but you have admit-, 
ted me to gb this Voyage in your Ship, and by your oblig- 
ing Civility have taken me into your Family, giving me 
an Opportunity of free Conversation. Now Sir, says he, 
you see by my Habit what my Profession is, and I guess 
by your Nation what yours is : I may think it is my«Duty, 
and doubtless it is so, to use my utmost Endeavours, on 
all Occasions, to bring all the Souls I can to the Know- 
ledge of the Truth, and to embrace the Catholick Doc- 
trine; but as I am here under your Permission, and in 
your Family, I am bound in Juftice to your Kindness, as 
well as in Decency and good Manners, to be under your 
Government; and therefore I shall not, without your 
Leave, enter into any Debates on the Point of Religion, in 
which we may not agree, farther than you shall give me 
Leave. 

I told him, his Carriage was somode^l, that I could not 
but acknowledge it ; that it was true, we were such People 
as they call’d Hereticks ; but that he was not the'firft Ca- 
tholick that I had convers’d with, without falling intoany 
Inconveniences, or carrying the Questions to any height 
in Debate : Thathe shouldnot find himself the worse us’d 
for being of a different Opinion from us, and ir we did not 
converse without any Dislike on either Side upon that 
Score, it should be his Fault, not ours. 

He reply’d, that he thought all our Conversation 
might be easily separated from Disputes : That it was not 
his Business to cap Principles with every Man he dis- 



Farther Adventures o/RobinsonCrusoe 15 

cours’d with •, and that R* rather desir’d me to converse 
with him as a Gentleman, than as a Religicaase,- that if I 
would give him Leave at any time to discourse upon relig- 
ious Subjedts, he would readily comply with it; and that 
then, he did not doubt but I would allow him also to de- 
fend his own Opinions, as well as he could ; but that 
withofit my Leave he would not break in up<5n me with 
any such thing. 

He told me farther, that he would not cease to do all 
that became him in his Office, as a Pricft, as well as a pri- 
vate Chridfian, to procure the Good of the Ship, and the 
, Safety of all that was in her ; and tho’ perhaps we wouldnot 
join with him, and he could not pray w//i>us,hehop’dhe 
might pray /or us, which he would do upon all Occasions. 
In this Manner we convers’d, and as he was of a mo^l ob- 
liging Gentleman-like Behaviour; so he was, if I may be 
allow’d to say so, a Man of good Sense, and as I believe, 
of great Learning. 

He gave me a mo^ diverting Account of his Life, and 
of the many extraordinary Events of it; of many Adven- 
tures which had befallen him in the few Years that he 
had been abroad in the world, and particularly this was 
very remarkable, That in the Voyage he was now 
engag’d,* he had had the Misfortune to be five times 
ship’d and unship’d, and never to go to the Place whi- 
ther any of the Ships hewasin,wereat fir^ design’d ; That 
his firft Intent was to have gone to Martinico, and that he 
went on board a Ship bound thither, at St. Malo ; but be- 
ing forc’d into Lisbon by bad Weather, the Ship receiv’d 
some Damage, by running a-ground in the Mouth of the 
River ’TaguSy and was oblig’d to unload her Cargo there; 
that finding a Portuguese Ship there bound to the Made- 
raSy and ready to sail, and supposing he should easily meet 



1 6 Farther Adventures o/Robinson Crusoe 

with a Vessel there bound to MFrtinico ; he went on board> 
in Order to s^il to the Maderas ;but the Mailer of the Por- 
tuguese Ship being but an indifferent Mariner, had been 
out in his Reckoning, and they drove toFial\ where, how- 
ever, he happen’d to find a very good Market for his Car- 
go, which was Corn, and therefore resolv’d not to go to 
the Madef-as, but to load Salt at the Isle of May, and go 
away to Newfoundland: He had no Remedy in this Exi- 
gence, but to go with the Ship, and had a pretty good Voy- 
age as far as the Banks, so they call the Place where they 
catch the Fish, where meeting with a French Ship, bound 
from France to Quebeck in the River of Canada, and from 
thence to Martinico, to carry Provisions, he thought he 
should have an Opportunity to compleat his fir^t Design : 
But when he came to Quebeck, the Master of the Ship 
dy’d, and the Ship proceeded no farther ; so the next Voy- 
age he shipp’d himself for France, in the Ship that was 
burnt, when we took them up at Sea, and then shipp’d 
with us for the EaSl-Indies, as I have already said : Thus he 
had been disappointed in five Voyages, all, as I maftall 
it, in one Voyage, besides what I shall have Occasion to 
mention farther of the same Person. 

But, I shall not make Digressions -into other Men’s 
Stories, which have no Relation to my own. I return to 
what concerns our Affair in the Island: He came to me 
one Morning, for he lodg’d among us all the while we 
were upon the Island; and it happen’d to be ju^f; when I 
was going to visit the English Men’s Colony, at the far- 
thest Part of the Island, I say, he came to me, and told me. 
with a very grave Countenance, that he had for two or 
three Days desir’d an Opportunity of some Discourse 
with me, which he hop’d should not be displeasing to me, 
because he thought it might in someMeasure correspond 



j Farther Adventures so %Ckvs(\^ 17 

with my general Design, T^hich was the Prosperity of my 
new Colony, and perhaps might put it, at lea^ more than 
he yet thought it was, in the Way of God’s Blessing. 

I look’d a little surpriz’d at the la^ Part of his Dis- 
course, and turning a little short. How Sir, said I, can it 
h&said, that we are not in the Way of God’s Blqgsing, af- 
ter sucR visible Assistances and wonderful Deliverances as 
we have seen here, and of which I have given you a large 
Account? 

If you had pleas’d Sir, said he, with a world of ModeSly, 
and yet with great Readiness, to have heard me, you would 
feave found no room to have been displeas’d, much less 
to think so hard of me, that I should suggeft, that you 
•have not had wonderful Assistances and Deliverances; 
;and I hope, on your Behalf, that you are in the Way of 
)God’s Blessing, and your Design is exceeding good, and 
will prosper : But, Sir, tho’ it were more so, than is even 
/possible to you, yet there may be some among you that 
are not equally right in their Actions : And you know, 
that in the Story of the Children of Israel, one Achan in 
:he Camp remov’d God’s Blessing from them, and turn ’d 
lis Hand so againSl them, that six and thirty of them, 
:ho’ not cqncern’din the Crime, were the Objeft of Di- 
vine Vengeance, and bore the Weight of that Puia^sh- 
tnent. 

1 I was sensibly touch’d with his Discourse, and told 
him, his Inference was so juft, and the whole Design 
^em’d so sincere, and was really so religious in its own 
Mature, that I was very sorry I had interrupted him, and 
pegg’d him to go on; and in the mean Time, because it 
teem’d, that what we had both to say might take up some 
rime, I told him, I was going to the English Mens Plan- 
ptions, and ask’d him to go with me, and we might dis-

course of it by the W ay : He tolQ me, he would more wil- 
lingly' wait oft me thither, because there partly the Thing 
was afted, which he desir’d to speak to me about, so we 
walk’d on ; and I press’d him to be free and plain with me, 
in what he had to say. 

Why th,en. Sir, says he, be pleased to give me Leave to 
lay down a few Propositions, as the Foundation of what I 
have to say, that we may not differ in the general Princi- 
ples, tho’ we may be of some differing Opinions in the 
Praftice of Particulars. Firft, Sir, tho’ we differ in some 
of the doftrinal Articles of Religion ; and it is veryninhap- 
py that it is so, especially in the Case before us, as I shalh 
shew afterwards: Yet there are some general Principles 
in which we both agree, (viz.) firft. That there is a God; 
and that this God having given us some ftated general 
Rules for our Service and Obedience, we ought not wil- 
lingly and knowingly to offend him ; either by neglecting 
to do what he has commanded, or by doing what he has 
expressly forbidden ; And let our different Religious be 
what they will, this general Principle is readily own’d by 
us all, That the Blessing of God does not ordinarily fol- 
low a presumptuous sinning against his Command; and 
every good Christian will be affeftioriately coijcern’d to 
prevent any that are under his Care, living in a total Neg- 
leCl of God and his Commands. It is not your Men being 
ProteClants, whatever my Opinion may be of such, that 
discharges me from being concern’d for their Souls, and 
from endeavouring, if it lies before me, that they should 
live in as little Di^ance from and Enmity with their. 
Maker, as possible, especially if you give me Leave to 
meddle so far in your Circuit. 

I could not yet imagine what he aim’d at, and told him, 
I granted all he had said, and thank’d him, that he would 



Farther Adventures^ of ^ obinsonCrus«e 19 

so. far coiicern himself for us; and begg’d he woujd ex- 
plain the Particulars of what he had observ'd, that, like 
Joshua, to take his own Parable, I might put away the ac- 
cursed Thing from us. 

Why then. Sir, says he, I will take the Liberty you give 
me ; ai\d there are three Things,which, if I am right,muft 
^tand in the Way of God’s Blessing upon your Endea- 
vours here, and which I should rejoice for your sake, and 
their own, to see remov’d. And, Sir, says he, I promise 
myself, that you will fully agree with me in them all, as 
soon asl name them ; especially because I shall convince 
you, that every one of them may, with great Ease, and 
very much to your Satisfaction, be remedy’d. 

He gave me no Leave to put in any more Civilities, but 
went on. FiriJ, Sir, says he, you have here four English 
Men, who have fetch’d Women from among the Savages 
and have taken them as their Wives, and have had many 
Children by them all, and yet are not marry’d to them al- 
ter any dated legal Manner, as the Laws of God and Man 
require; and therefore are yet, in the Sense of both, no 
less than Adulterers, and living in Adultery. To this. Sir, 
says be, I know you will objeCl, That there was no Clergy- 
man or Pried of any Kind, or of any Profession, to per- 
form the Ceremony; nor any Pen and Ink, or Paper, to 
write down a ContraCl of Marriage, and have it sign’d 
between them. And I know also, S^ir, what the Spaniard 
Governour has told you ; I mean of the Agreement that he 
oblig’d them to make, when they took these Women(w’z.) 
That they should chuse them out by Consent, and keep 
separately to them; which, by the way, is nothing of a 
Marriage, no Agreement with the Women, as Wives, 
but only an Agreement among themselves, to keep them 
from quarrelling. 



20 Farther Adventures o/Rob^inson Crusoe 
Buf, Sir, the Essence of the Sacrament of Matrimony 
(so he call’ (fit, being a Roman) consifts not only in the 
mutual Consent of the Parties to take one another, as Man 
and PFife, but in the formal and legal Obligation, that 
there is in the Contradl, to compel the Man and Woman 
at all Times, to own and acknowledge each other, obligi- 
ing the Men to ab^ain from all other Women, to engage 
in no other Contraft while these subsist ; and on all Occa- 
sions, as Ability allows, to provide hone^ly for them and 
their Children, and to oblige the Women to the same, or 
like Conditions, mutaiis mutandis^ on their Side." 

Now, Sir, says he, these Men may, when theyp]ease,or 
when Occasion presents, abandon these Women, disown 
their Children, leave them to perish, and take other Wo- 
men, and marry them whilst these are living. And here he 
added, with some Warmth, How, Sir, is God honour’d 
in this unlawful Liberty? And how shall a Blessing suc- 
ceedyourEndeavoursin this Place? However good in them- 
selves, 2ind.howeversincereinyourDesign,'wh.i\e theseMen, 
who at present are your Subjec^ts, under your absolute 
Government and Dominion, are allow’d by you to live in 
open Adultery? 

I confess, I was struck at the Thing itself, but much 
more with the convincing Arguments he supported it 
with ; for it was certainly true, that tho’ they had no Cler- 
gyman upon the Spot, yet a formal Contrafton both Sides, 
made before Witnesses, and confirm’d by any Token, 
which they had all agreed to be bound by, tho’ it had been 
but breaking a Stick between them, engaging the Men to. 
own these Women for their Wives, upon all Occasions, 
and never to abandon them or their Children, and the 
Women to the same with their Husbands, had been an 



Farther Adventures ^RobinsonCruso^ 2r 

efFeftual lawful Marriagft in the Sight of God; and it was 
a great Negleft that it was not done. * 

But I thought to have gotten off with my young Prieif, 
by telling him, that'^ll that Part was done when I was not 
here, and they had liv’d so many Years with them now, 
that if it was an Adultery, it was paft Remedy, fhey could 
do nofhing in it now. 

Sir, says he, asking your Pardon for such Freedom, you are 
right in this, that it being done in your Absence, you 
could not be charg’d with that Part of the Crime: But I 
beseech you, flatter not yourself, that you are not there- 
fore under an Obligation to do your utmo^ now to put an 
End to it. How can you think, but that, let the Time pa^ 
lie on who it will, all the Guilt, for the future, will lie en- 
tirely upon you.^ Because it is certainly in your Power now 
to put an End to it, and in no Body’s Power but yours. 

I was so dull ^lill, that 1 did not take him right; but I 
imagin’d, that by putting an End to it, he meant that I 
should part them, and notsuffer them to live together any 
longer; And I said to him, I could not do that by any 
Means, for that it would put the whole Island into Con- 
fusion : He seem’d surpriz’d, that I should so far mis- 
take him.^No, ‘Fir* says he, I do not mean, thatyou should 
now separate them, but legally and effeftuallymarry them 
now; and as, Sir, my Way of marrying them may not be 
so easy to reconcile them to, tho’ it will be as effeftual, 
even by your own Laws, so your Way may be as well be- 
fore God, and as valid among Men ; I mean, by a written 
Contrail, sign’d by both Man and Woman, and by all the 
Witnesses present, which all the Laws of Europe would 
decree to be valid. 

I was amaz’d to see so much true Piety, and so much 



a 2 Farther Adventures 0/ Robinson Crusoe 

Sincerity of Zeal, besides the uuusual Impartiality in his 
Discourse, ^ to his own Party or Church, and such true 
Warmth for the preserving People that he had no Know- 
ledge of, or Relation to; I say, for preserving them from 
transgressing the Laws of God ; the like of which I had 
indeed not met with any where : But recollefting what Ive 
had said, of marrying them by a written Contraft,’ which 
I knew would ^and too ; I return’d it back upon him, and 
told him, I granted all that he had said to be ju^, and on 
his Part very kind, that I would discourse with the Men 
upon the Point now, when I came to them : And I knew 
no Reason whythey shou’d scruple to let him marry their^ 
all, which I knew well enough would be granted to be as 
authentick and valid in England^ as if they were marry’d 
by one of our own Clergymen. What was afterwards done 
in this Matter, I shall speak of by itself. 

I then press’d him to tell me what was the second Com- 
plaintviYiich he had to make, acknowledging, that I was 
very much his Debtor for the firSl, and thank’d him hear- 
tily for it. He told me, he would use the same Freedom 
and Plainness in the second, and hop’d I would take it as 
well: And this was, that notwith^anding these English 
Subjefts of mine, as he call'd them, had lived with those 
Women for almoil seven Years, had taught them to speak 
English, and even to read it; and that they were, as he per- 
ceiv’d, Women of tolerable Under^anding, and capable 
of Inftruftion ; yet they had not to this Hour taught them 
any thing of the Christian Religion, no, not so much as to 
know that there was a God, or a Worship, or in what Man- 
ner God was to be served, or that their own Idolatry, and 
worshipping they knew not who, was false and absurd. 

This, he 8aid,was an unaccountable Negleft, and what 
God would certainly call them to Account for, and per- 



Farther Adventures o/RobinsonCrusoe 23 

haps at la^l take the Wotik out of their Hands. He spoke 
this very aifeftionately and warmly. I am pei»swad€^, says 
he^ had those Men lived in the Savage Country, whence 
their Wives came, the Savages would have taken more 
Pains to have brought them to be Idolaters, and to wor- 
ship the Devil, than any of these Men, so Jar as he could 
see^ had taken with them to teach them the Knowledge of 
the true God. Now,Sir,jW heyXho’ I do not acknowledge 
your Religion, or you mine, yet we should be glad to see 
the Devil’s Servants, and the Subjedls of his Kingdom, 
taught,to know the general Principles of the Christian 
Religion ; that they might, at leail, hear of God, and of a 
*Redeemer, and of the Resurrection, and of a future State, 
Things which we all believe; they had at lea^ been so 
much nearer coming into the Bosom of the true Church, 
than they are now in the publick Profession of Idolatry 
and Devil-Worship. 

I could hold no longer; I took him in my Arms, and 
embrac’d him with an Excess of Passion : Howfar, said I 
to him, have I been from under^anding the mo^l essen- 
tial Part of a Chri^ian ! (viz.) to love the Interest of the 
Chriftian Church, and the good of other Mens Souls. I 
scarce have known what belongs to being a Christian. O, 
Sir, do ndt say so, refly' d he., this Thing is not your Fault. 
No, says /, but why did I never lay it to Heart as well as 
you.? ’Tis not too late yet, said he, be not too forward to 
condemn yourself : but what can be done now, said /, you 
see I am going away.? Will you give me Leave, said he, to 
talk with those poor Men about it.? Yes, with all my Hear 
said I, and will oblige them to give heed to what you 
say too ; As to that, said he, we muft leave them to the 
Mercy of Chrift ; but ’tis our Business to assiCl them, en- 
courage them, and in^lruCI them; and if you will give me 



24 Farther Adventures (^Robinson Crusoe 

Leave, and God his Blessing, { do not doubt but the poor 
igndrant Souls shall be brought Home into the great Cir- 
cle of Christianity, if not into the particular Faith that we 
all embrace, and that even while you Slay here : Upon this, 

I said, I shall not only give you Leave, but give you a 
thousand Thanks for it. What follow’d on this Accoupt, 

I shall mention also again in its Place. " 

I now press’d him for the Third Article, in which we 
were to blame. Why really, says he, it is of the same Na- 
ture, and I will proceed, asking your Leave, with the same 
Plainness as before ; it is about your poor Savages, who 
are, as I may say, your conquer’d Subjefts. It is a Maxima 
Sir, that is or ought to be receiv’d among all ChriSlians 
of what Church or pretended Church soever, (wz.) The 
Christian Knowledge ought to be -propagated by all possible 
Means, and on allpossible Occasions: ’Tis on this Principle 
that our Church sends Missionaries into Persia, India, 
and China, and that our Clergy, even of the superior Sort, 
willingly engage in the mo^l hazardous Voyages, and the 
mo^ dangerous Residence among Murderers and Bar- 
barians, to teach them the Knowledge of the true God, 
and to bring them over to embrace the Christian Faith. 
Now, Sir, you have such an Opportunity here^to have six 
or seven and thirty poor Savages brought over from Ido- 
latry to the Knowledge of God their Maker and Redeem- 
er, that I wonder how you can pass such an Occasion of 
doing Good, which is really worth the Expence of a Man’s 
whole life. 

I was now ^ruck dumb indeed, and had not one Word 
to say. I had here a Spirit of true Christian Zeal for God « 
and Religion before me, let his particular Principles be 
of what Kind soever; as for me, I had not so much as en- 
tertain’d a Thought of this in my Heart before, and I be- 



Farther Adventures o/Robin son Crusoe 25 

lieve should not have thoughtof it ; for I look’d upon these 
Savages as Slaves, and People, who, had •we had any 
Work for them to do, we would ha’used as such, or would 
ha’ been glad to have transported them to any other Part 
of the World ; for our Business was to get ridof them, and 
we would all have been satisfy’d, if they had been sent to 
any Country, so they had never seen their own : But to the 
Case^ I say, I was confounded at his Discourse, and knew 
not what Answer to make him. He look’d earneftly at 
me, seeing me in some Disorder ; Sir, says he, I shall be 
very sorry, if whatihavesaidgivesyou any Offence: No, 
No, says /, I am offended with no Body but my self; but I 
am perfeftly confounded, not only to think that I should 
never take any Notice of this before, but with refleding 
what Notice I am able to take of it now. You know. Sir, 
said /, what Circum^ances 1 am in, I am bound to the 
EaU-Indies, in a Ship freighted by Merchants, and to 
whom it would be an unsufferable Piece of Injustice to 
detain their Ship here, the Men lying all this while at Vic- 
tuals and Wages upon the Owners Account. It is true, I 
agreed to be allow’d twelve Days here, and if I ^ay more, 
I mu^l pay 3 /. SterlingperDiem Demorage, nor can I ^ay 
upon Demorageabove eight Days more, and I have been 
here thirteen Days already, so that I am perfedly unable 
to engage in this Work, unless I would suffer my self to 
be left behind here again, in which Case, if this single 
Ship should miscarry in any Part of her Voyage, I should 
be ju^ in the same Condition that I wasleft inhere at fir^, 
and from which I have been so wonderfully delivered. 

He own’d the Case was very hard upon me, as to my 
Voyage, but laid it home upon my Conscience, whether 
the Blessing of saving seven and thirty Souls, was not 
worth my venturing all I had in the World for? I was not 



26 Farther Adventures o/RobinsonCrusoe 

so sensible of that as he was. I feturn’.d upon him thus, 
why,' Sir, it is a valuable Thing indeed, to be an Instru- 
ment in God’s Hand to convert seven and thirty Heathen 
to the Knowledge of ChriSt, but as you are an Ecclesias- 
tic, and are given over to the Work, so that it seems so 
naturally to fall into the Way of your Profession; how is 
it, that ydu do not rather offer your self to undertake it, 
than press me to it? 

Upon this he fac’d about, juSl before me, as we walk’d 
along, and putting me to a full Stop, made me a very low 
Bow; I moll heartily thank God and you. Sir, sajis he, for 
giving me so evident a Call to so blessed a Work; and if 
you think your self discharg’d from it, and desire me to 
undertake it, I will moft readily do it, and think it a hap- 
py Reward for all the Hazards and Difficulties of such a 
broken disappointed Voyage as I have met with, that I 
may be dropt at laH into so glorious a Work. 

I discover’d a kind of Rapture in his Face while he 
spoke this to me; his Eyes sparkl’d like Fire, his Face 
glow’d, and his Colour came and went, as if he had been 
falling into Fits; in a Word, he was fir’d with the Joy of 
being embark’d in such a Work. I paus’d a considerable 
while before I could tell what to say to him, for I was real- 
ly surpriz’d to find a Man of such Sincerity and' Zeal, and 
carry’d out in his Zeal beyond the ordinary Rate of Men, 
not of his Profession only, but even of any Profession 
whatsoever. But after I had consider’d it awhile, I ask’d 
him seriously if he was in earned, and that he would ven- 
ture on the single Consideration of an Attempt on those 
poor People, to be lock’d up in an unplanted Island for, 
perhaps, his Life, and at lall might not know whether he 
should be able to do them any Good, or not? 

He turn’d short upon me, and ask’d me what I call’d a 



Farther Adventures o/Robinson Crusoe 27 

Venture? Pray, Sir, said het^ what do you think I consented 
to go in your Ship to the EaSl-Indies for? Naj*, said f, that 
I know not, unless it was to preach to the Indians: Doubt- 
less it was, said he; and do you think, if I can convert 
these seven and thirty Men to the Faith of Chrift, it is 
not worth my time, tho' I should never be fetch’d off the 
Islands again; nay, is it not infinitely of more* worth to 
save so many Souls, than my life is, or the Life of twenty 
more of the same Profession? Yes, Sir, says be, I would 
give Chti^ and the blessed Virgin Thanks all my Days, if 
I could be made the lea^ happy In^rument of saving the 
Souls of these poor Men, tho’ I was never to set my Foot 
off this Island, or see my native Country any more. But 
since you will honour me, says he, with putting me into 
this Work, /or which I will pray for you all the Days of my 
Life\ I have one humble Petition to you, said he, besides. 
What is that, said I? Why, says he, it is, that you will leave 
your Man Friday with me, to be my Interpreter to them, 
and to assist me; for without some Help I cannot speak 
to them, or they to me. 

I was sensibly troubled at his requeuing Friday, be- 
cause I could not think of parting with him, and that for 
many Reasons; h» had been the Companion of my Tra- 
vels; he \^as not only faithful to me, but sincerely affec- 
tionate to the laft Degree, and I had resolv’d to do some- 
thing considerable for him, if he out-liv’d me, as it was 
probable he would. Then I knew that, as I had bred Fri- 
day u|» to be a Proteftant, it would quite confound him to 
bring him to embrace another Promssion ; and he would 
never, while his Eyes were open,believe that his old Mas- 
ter was a Heretick and would be damn’d ; and this might 
in the End ruin the poor Fellow’s Principles, and so turn 
him to his fir^l Idolatry. 



2 8 Farther Adventures oj ^o'&i nson Crusoe 

However, a sudden Thougiit relieved me in this Strait, 
andit was this ; I told him, I could not say that I was wil- 
ling to part with Friday on any Account whatever, tho’ a 
Work that to him was of more Value than his Life, ought 
to be to me of much less Value than the keeping or part- 
ing with a Servant : But on the other hand, I was persuad- 
ed that Friday would by no Means consent to pSft with 
me, and I could not force him to it without his Consent, 
without manife^ Inju^ice, because I had promised I 
would never put him away, and he had promis’d and 
engag’d to me, that he would never leave me, unless I put 
him away, y , 

He seem’d very much concern’d at it, for he had no 
rational Access to these poor People, seeing he did not 
understand one Word of their Language, nor they one 
Word of his: To remove this Difficulty, I told him, Fri- 
day'& Father had learn’d Spanish, which I found he also 
understood, and he should serve him for an Interpreter; 
so he was much better satisfied, and nothing could per- 
suade him but he would Stay to endeavour to convert 
them; but Providence gave another, and very happy 
Turn to all this. 

I come back now to the firSt Part of his Objections. 
When we came to the English Men, I sent for tfiem all to- 
gether, and after some Account given them of what I had 
done for them, viz. what necessary Things I had provid- 
ed for them, and how they were distributed, which they 
were very sensible of, and very thankful for; I began to 
talk to them of the scandalous Life they led, and gave 
them a full Account of the Notice the Clergyman had al- , 
ready taken of it, and arguing how unchristian and irre- 
ligiousaLifeitwas. 1 firSt ask’d them if they were married 
Men or Batchelors? They soon explain’d their Cotvditioxv 



Farther Adventures 0/ Robinson Crus 29, 

to me, and shew’d-me thatftwo of them were Widowers, 
and the other three were single Men or Batchelbrs . I ask’d 
them' with what Consciences they could take these Wo- 
men and lie with them, as they had done, call them their 
Wives, and have so many Children by them, and not be 
marry’d lawfully to them. 

They all gave me the Answer that I expedted, viz. that 
there was no Body to marry them ; that they agreed before 
the Governor to keep them as their Wives ; and to keep 
them and own them as their Wives ; and they thought as 
Things ftood with them, they were as legally married as 
if they had been married by a Parson, and with all the 
Formalities in the World. 

I told them, that no doubt they were married in the 
Sightof God, and werebound in Conscience to keep them 
as their Wives, but that the Laws of Men being other- 
wise, they might pretend they were not^narried, and so 
desert the poor Women and Children hereafter; and that 
their Wives being poor desolate Women, friendless and 
moneyless, would have no way to help themselves. I 
therefore told them, that unless I was assur’d of their hon- 
eft Intent, I could do nothing for them ; but would take 
Care that jvhat I dfd should be for the Women and their 
Children without them, and that unless they would give 
some Assurances that they would marry the Women, I 
could not think it was convenient they should continue 
togetheras Man and Wife, for that it was both scandalous 
to Men, and offensive to God, who they could not think 
would bless them, if they went on thus. 

Allthiswenton as I expelled, and they told me, especi- 
ally Will. Atkins., who seem’d now to speak for the reft, 
that they lov’d their Wives as well, as if they had been 
born, in their own Native Country, and would not leave 



30 F^artber Adventures ^Robinson Crusoe 

them upon any Account whatever; and they did verilji, 
believe theit Wives were as virtuous and as modest, and 
did, to the utmo^ of their Skill, as much for them, and for 
their Children, as any Women could possibly do, and they 
would not part with them on any Account : And Will, At- 
kins for his own Particular added, if any Man would take 
him away, and offer to carry him home to England,, and 
make him Captain of the be^ Man of War in the Navy, 
he would not go with him, if he might not carry his Wife 
and Children with him; and iftherewasaClergymaninthe 
Ship, he would be married to her now with all his Heart. 

This was ju^l as I would have it; the Priest was hot 
with me at that Moment, but was not far off : So to try him 
farther, I told him I had a Clergyman with me, and if he 
was sincere, I would have him married the next Morning 
and bid him consider of it, and talk with the re^l ; he said, 
as for himself, he need not consider of it at all, for he was 
very ready to do it, and was glad I had a Minister with 
me, and he believ’d they would be all willing also. I then 
told him that my Friend the Minister was a French Man,, 
and could not speak English, but that I would aft the 
Clerk between them : He never so much as ask’d me whe- 
ther he was Papift or Proteftant, which was indeed what 
I was afraid of: But, I say, they never enquir’d about it. 
So we parted, I went back to my Clergyman, and Will. 
Atkins -went in to talk with his Companions. I desir’d the 
French Gentleman not to say anything to them, till the 
Business was thorough ripe, and I told him what Answer 
the Men had given me. 

Before I went from their Quarter, they all came to me, 
and told me, they had been considering what I had said, 
that they were very glad to hear I had a Clergyman in my 
Company, and they were very willing to giveme the Satis- 



Farther Adverftures o/RobinsonCrusoj^ 31 

faftion I desir’d, and to be*formally Married as soon as I 
pleas’d, for they were far from desiring to part with ?heir 
Wives, and that they meant nothing but what was very 
honest when they chose them; so I appointed them to 
meet me the next Morning, and that in the mean time 
they should let their Wives know the meaning of the 
Marriage-Law; and that it was not only to prevent any 
Scandal, but also to oblige them, that they should not for- 
sake them, whatever might happen. 

The Women were easily made sensible of the Mean- 
ing of the Thing, and were very well satisfied with it, as, 
indeed, they had Reason to be ; so they fail’d not to attend 
all together at my Apartment the next Morning,where I 
brought out my Clergyman; and tho’ he had not on a 
Minister’s Gown, after the Manner of England^ or the 
Habit of a PrieSt, after the Manner of France ; yet havinga 
black VeSl something like a Cassock, with a Sash round 
it, he did not look very unlike a Minister; and as for his 
Language, I was his Interpreter. 

But the Seriousness of his Behaviour to them, and the 
Scruples he made of marrying the Women, because they 
were not baptiz’d, and profess’d Christians^ gave thepi an 
exceeding ^Revererfce for his Person; and there was no 
need after that, to enquire whether he was a Clergyman 
or no. 

Indeed, I was afraid his Scruple would have been car- 
ry ’d so far, as that he would not have marry ’d them at all ; 
nay, notwithstanding all I was able to say to him, he re- 
sisted me, though modeStly, yet very Steadily, and at laSt 
refusedabsolutelyto marry them,unlesshehad firSt talk’d 
with the Men, and the Women too ; and though at firSt I 
was a little backward to it, yet at laSt I agreed to it with a 
good Will, perceiving the Sincerity of his Design. 



32 ’ Farther Adventures <?/ Robinson Crusoe 
v/whcn he came to them, he kt them know, that I had 
acquainted 4iim with their Circumftances, and with the 
present Design : That he was very willing to perform that 
Part of his Funftion, and marry them as I had desir’d; 
but that before he could do it, he mu^l take the Liberty to 
talk with them. He told them, That in the Sight of all in- 
different **Men, and in the Sense of the Laws of Society, 
they had liv’d all this while in an open Adultery ; and that 
it was true, that nothing but the consenting to marry, or 
effeftually separating them from one another now, could 
put an End to it; but there was a Difficulty in it too, with 
respedl to the Laws of Christian Matrimony, which hf; 
was not fully satisfy’d about, viz. That of marrying one 
that is a profess’d Christian., to a Savage, an Idolator, and 
a Heathen, one that is not baptiz’ d ; and yet that he did 
not see that there was Time left for it toendeavourto per- 
suade the Women to be baptiz’d, or to profess the Name 
of Christ, whom they had, he doubted, heard nothing of, 
and without which they could not be baptiz’d. 

• He told them. He doubted they were but indifferent 
Chriftians themselves; that they had but little Know- 
ledge of God, or of his Ways ; and therefore he could not 
expeft that they had said much to their Wives on that 
Head yet ; but that unless they would promise fciim to use 
their Endeavour with their Wives, to persuade them to 
become Chriftians, and would as well as they could in- 
ilruft them in the Knowledge and Belief of God that 
made them, and to worship Jesus Christ that redeem’d 
them, he could not marry them; for he would have no 
Hand in joining Christians with Savages ; nor was it con- 
silient with the Principles of the Chri^an Religion ; and 
was indeed expressly forbidden in God’s Law. 

They heard all this very attentively, and I deliver’d it

very faithfully to them, frcftn his Mouth, as near his pwn 
* Words as I could, only sometimes adding something of 
my own to convince them how ju^l it was, and how I was 
of his Mind; and I always very faithfully di^inguish’d 
between what I said from myself, and what were the Cler- 
gyjnan’s Words. They told me, it was very true, ^hat the 
Gentl^an had said, that they were but very indifferent 
ChriUians themselves, and that they had never talk’d to 
their Wives about Religion. Lord, Sir.' says IVi/J. Atkins, 
How should we teach them Religion? Why we know no- 
thing our selves ; and besides. Sir, said he, should we goto 
t^k to them of God, and Jesus Cbriil, and Heaven and Hell, 
’twould be to make them laugh at us, and ask us. What 
we believe our selves? And if we should tell them we be- 
lieve all the Things that we speak of to them, such as of 
good People going to Heaven, and wicked People to the 
Devil, they would ask us. Where we intend to go our sel- 
ves, that believe all this, and are such wicked Fellows, as 
we indeed are? Why, Sir, ’tis enough to give them a Sur- 
feit of Religion at firit Hearing: Folks mu^l have some 
Religion themselves, before they pretend to teach other 
People : fFill Atkins, said I to him ; though I am afraid wha^ 1 
you say has too much Truth in it, yet can you not tell youi 
Wife that she’s in the wrong? that there is a God, and j 
Religion better than her own ; that her Gods are Idols, 
that they can neither hear nor speak ; that there is a great 
Being that made all Things, and that can destroy all that 
he had made ; that he rewards the Good, and punishes the 
Bad; and that we are to be judg’d by him at la^ for all 
we do here : You are not so ignorant, but even Nature it- 
self will teach you that all this is true, and I am satisfy’d 
you know it all to be true, and believe it yourself. ^ 

That’s true, Sir, said Atkins-, but with what Face can 

VOL. in d • 



34 farther Adventures o/RobinsonCrusoe 

I say any Thing to my Wife of all this, when she will tell 
me immediately it cannot be true? 

Not true, said /, What do you mean by that ? Why, Sir, 
said hey She will tell me it cannot be true, that this God I 
shall tell her of can be ju^l, or can punish, or reward, since 
I am ncHt punish’d, and sent to the Devil, that have been 
such a wicked Creature as she knows I have been,'^even to 
her, and to every Body else ; and that I should be suffer’d 
to live, that have been always adting so contrary to what I 
muil tell her is Good, and to what I ought to have done. 

Why, truly, Atkins, said /, I am afraid thou speakeif 
too much Truth ; and with that I let the Clergyman know 
what Atkins had said, for he was impatient to know: O! 
said the PrieSl', ttW him there is one Thing will make him 
the bedl Minister in the World to his Wife, and that is. 
Repentance', for none teach Repentance like true Peni- 
tents: He wants nothing but to repent, and then he will 
be so much the better qualify’d to inftrudl his Wife : He 
will be then able to tell her, that there is not only a God, 
and that he is the ju^l Rewarder of Good and Evil, but 
that he is a merciful Being, and with infinite Goodness 
and Long-suffering forbears to punish those that offend, 
waiting to be gracious, and willing ndt the Dejth of a Sin- 
ner, but rather that he should return and live ; that often- 
times suffers wicked Men to go on a long Time, and even 
reserves Damnation to the general Day of Retribution ; 
that it is a clear Evidence of God, and of a future State, 
that righteous Men receive not their Reward, or wicked 
Men their Punishment, ’till they come into another 
World ; and this will lead him to teach his Wife the Doc-* 
trine of the Resurreftion, and of the laft Judgment; let 
him but repent for himself, he will be an excellent Prea- 
cher of Repentance to his Wife. 



Farther Adventures o/jRoBiNsoNCRUsoE 2S 

I repeated all this to Atkins, who look’d very serioVis all 
the while, and who, we could easily perceive, was more 
than ordinarily afFefted with it: When being eager, and 
hardly suffering me to make an End, I know all this. Mas- 
ter, says he, and a great deal more-, but I han’t the Impu- 
dSnc* to talk thus to my Wife, when God, and my own 
Conscience knows, and my Wife will be an undeniable 
Evidence against me, that I have liv’d, as if I had never 
heard of a God, or future State, or any Thing about it; 
and to talk of my repenting, ALAS! And with that he 
fetch'd a deep Sigh ; and I could see, that Tears ^food in his 
Eyes; ’Tispa^t all that with me. Paft it! ATKINS, said 
I, what do’^ thou mean by that.^ I know well enough 
what I mean, says he, / mean 'tis too late, and that is too 
true. 

I told my Clergyman Word for Word what he said; 
the poor zealous Prieft (I mu^ call him so ; for, be his 
Opinion what it will, he had certainly a mo^ singular Af- 
feftion fpr the Good of other Mens Souls ; and it would 
be hard fo think he had not the like for his own) I say, this 
zealous affectionate Man, could not refrain Tears also: 
But, recovering hipiself, he said to me, ask him but one 
Que^ion,*Is he easy that it is too late, or is he troubled, 
and wishes it were not so.? I put the Que^ion fairly to At- 
kins, and he answered with a great deal of Passion, How 
could any Man be easy in a Condition that certainly mu^ 
end in eternal De^ruClion? that he was far from being 
easy, but that, on the contrary, he believ’d it would one 
Time or other ruin him. 

What do you mean by that.? said I. Why, he said he be- 
liev’d he should, one Time or other, cut his Throat to put 
an End to the Terror of it. 

The Clergyman shook his Head with a great Concern 



36 'farther Adventures o/R<^binsonCrusoe 

in hife Face^when I told him all this ; But turning quick to 
me upon it, says he, If that be his Case, you may assure 
him it is not too late ; Chrift will give him Repentance : 
But pray, says he, explain this to him, That as no Man is 
sav’d but by Chriif and the Merit of his Passion, procur- 
ing divihe Mercy for him, how can it be too late ^r any 
Man to receive Mercy? Does he think he is able to sin 
beyond the Power or Reach of divine Mercy? Pray tell 
him, there may be a Time when provok’d Mercy will no 
longer ^rive, and when God may refuse to hear, but that 
’tis never too late for Men to ask Mercy ; and we that are 
Chris’s Servants are commanded to preach Mercy at aril 
Times, in the Name of Jesus ChriSl, to all those that sincerely 
repent\ so that ’tis never too late to repent. 

I told Atkins all this, and he heard me with great Ear- 
newness ; but it seem’d as if he turn’d off the Discourse to 
the reW; for he said to me he would go and have some 
Talk with his Wife ; so he went out a while, and we talk’d 
to the reW. I perceiv’d they were all Wupidly ignorant as 
to Mattersof Religion ; muchasiwas when I went rambl- 
ing away from my Father ; and yet that there were none 
of them backward to hear what had been said; and all of 
them seriously promis’d that they would talk with their 
Wives about it, and do their Endeavourto persuadethem 
to turn ChriWians. 

The Clergyman smil’d upon me, when I reported what 
Answer they gave, but said nothing a good while ; but, at 
laSl, shaking his Head, We that areChriW’s Servants, says 
he, can go no further than to exhort and inWruW, and 
when Men comply, submit to the Reproof, and promise* 
what we ask ’tis all we can do; we are bound to accept 
their good Words : But believe me. Sir, said he, whatever 
you, may have known of the Life of that Man you call 



Farther Adventures o/'RobinsonCruso^ 37 

JVill.Atkins, I believe he is theonly sincere Convert among 
them ; I take that Man to be a true Penitent;* I wont de- 
spair of the re^l; but that Man is apparently struck with 
the Sense of his paft Life ; and I doubt not, but when he 
comes to talk Religion to his Wife, he will talk himself 
effeftually into it ; for attempting to teach others^ is some- 
timeJYhe be^f way of teaching our selves. I knew a Man, 
who having nothing but a summary Notion of Religion 
himself, and being wicked and profligate to the la^ De- 
gree in his Life, made a thorough Reformation in himself, 
by labouring to convert a Jew. If that poor Atkins begins 
but once to talk seriously of Jesus Chri^ to his Wife, my 
Lifeforit,hetalkshimself intoathorough Convert, makes 
himself a Penitent : And who knows what may follow.? 

Upon this Discourse however, and their promising, as 
above, to endeavour to persuade their Wives to embrace 
Chriftianity,hemarry’dthe other three Couple ; \>\xtWill. 
Atkins and his Wife were not yet come in. After this, my 
Clergyman, waiting a while, was curious to know where 
Atkins Y as gone ; and, turning to me, says he, I entreatyou, 
Sir, let us walk out of your Labyrinth here, and look; I 
dare say, we shall find this poor Man somewhere or other 
talking seriously t« his Wife, and teaching her already 
something of Religion. I began to be of the same Mind; 
so we went out together, and I carry’d him a Way which 
none knew but myself, and where the Trees were so 
thick set, as that itwas not easy to see thro’ the Thicket of 
Leaves, andfarharderto^^tf in, than to see out', when, com- 
ing to the Edge of the Wood, I saw Atkins and his tawny 
Savage Wife sitting under the ShadeofaBush, very eager 
in Discourse ; I flopp’d short till my Clergyman came up 
to me; and then having show’d him where they were, we 
^ood and look’d very Readily at them a good while.

We observ’d him very earnest with her, pointing up to 
the Stin, and to every Quarter of the Heavens, then down 
to the Earth, then out to the Sea, then to himself, then to 
her, to the Woods, to the Trees. Now, says my Clergy- 
man, you see my Words are made good, the Man preaches 
to her; mark him now, he is telling her, that our God has 
made hinS, and her, and the Heavens, the Earth, the Sea, 
the Woods, the Trees, ^c. I believe he is, said /; immedi- 


ately we perceiv’d Will. Atkins ^fart up upon his Feet, fall 
down on his Knees, and lift up both his Hands : We sup- 
pose he said something, but we could not hear him, it was 
too far for that ; he did not continue kneeling half a Min- 
ute, but comes and sits down again by his Wife, and talkl 
to her again. We perceiv’d then the Woman very atten- 
tive, but whether she said any thing or no we could not 
tell; while the poor Fellow was upon his Knees, I could 
see the Tears run plentifully down my Clergyman’s 
Cheeks, and I could hardly forbear my self ; but it was a 
great Affliftion to us both that we were not near enough 
to hear any Thing that pass’d between them. 

Well, however, we could come no nearer for fear of 


disturbing them, so we resolv’d to see an End of this 
Piece of Slill Conversation^ and it spoke;loud enough to us 
without the Help of Voice. He sat down again, as I 
have said, close by her, and talk’d again earneftly to her, 
and two or three times we could seehim embrace her moSl 


passionately ; another time wesawhimtake out his Hand- 
kerchief and wipe her Eyes, and then kiss her again with 
a kind of Transport very unusual; and after several of 
these Things we see him, on a sudden, jump up again 
and lend her his Hand to help her up, when immediately, 
leading her by the Hand a Step or two, they both kneel’d 
down together, and continu’d so about two Minutes.

My Friendcouldbearit fio longer, but cries out aloud, 
St. PAUL! St. PAUL I behold he pr ay etb\ Was a/raid 
Atkins-wovi\d hear him, therefore I entreated him to with- 
hold himself awhile, that we might see an End of the 
Scene, which to me, I mu^ confess, was the mo^l affeft- 
ing, and yet the mo^ agreeable that ever I saw in my Life : 
"VV^lt^he ftrove with himself and contain’d him’selffora 
while, but was in such Raptures of Joy, to think that the 
poor Heathen Woman was become a Christian, that he 
was not able to contain himself; he wept several times, 
then throwing up his Hands and crossinghis Breast, said 
over several Things Ejaculatory and by way of giving 
(jod Thanks for so miraculous a Testimony of the Suc- 
cess of our Endeavours ; some he spoke softly, and I could 
not well hear, others audibly, some in Latin^ some in 
French ; then twoorthree times the Tears of Joy would in- 
terrupt him, that he could not speak at all : But I begg’d 
that he would compose himself, and let us more narrowly 
and fully observe what was before us, which he did for a 
Time, and the Scene was not ended there yet; for after 
the poor Man and his Wife were risen again from their 
Knees, we observ’d he ^lood talking ^ill eagerly to her; 
and we observ’d by her Motion, that she was greatly af- 
feded with what he said, by her frequent lifting up her 
Hands, laying her Hand to her Bread, and such other 
Podures, as usually express the greated Seriousness and 
Attention. This continu’d about half a Quarter of an 
Hour, and then they walk’d away too ; so that we could 
see no more of them in that Situation. 

I took this Interval to talk with my Clergyman : And 
fird, I told him, I was glad to see the Particulars we had 
both been Witnesses to; that tho’ I was hard enough of 
Belief in such Cases, yet that I began to think it was all

ver]{ sincere here, both in the Man and his Wife, however 
ignorant they might both be; and I hop’d such a Begin- 
ning would have a yet more happy End ; and who knows, 
said /, but these two may in Time, by In^ruftion and 
Example, work upon some of the others? Some of them ! 
said be^ mrning quick upon we, ay, upon all oj them ; depend 
upon it, if those two Savages, for he has been bvft little 
better, as you relate it, should embrace Jesus Chrift, they 
will never leave ’till they work upon all the re^t ; for true 
Religion is naturally communicative, and he that is ooce 
made a Christian, will never leave a Pagan behind him, if 
he can help it. I own’d it was a moft Christian Principje 
to think so, and a Testimony of a true Zeal, as well as a 
generous Heart in him : But, my Friend, said I, will you 
give me Leave to ^lart one Difficulty here? I cannot tell 
how to obje<51: the lea^ Thing again^l that affeftionate 
Concern, which you shew for the turning the poor Peo- 
ple from their Paganism to the Chriftian Religion : But 
how does this comfort you, while these People are in your 
Account out of the Pale of the Catholick Church, without 
which you believe there is no Salvation ; so that youefteem 
these but Hereticks, and for other Reasons as effeftually 
lo^l as the Pagans themselves. 

To this he answer’d with abundance of Candor and 
Christian Charity thus ; Sir, I am a Catholick of the Ro- 
man Church, and a Prie^ of the Order of St. BenediU, and 
I embrace all the Principles of the Roman Faith : But yet 
if you will believe me, and that I do not speak in Compli- - 
menttoyou^ or in resped to my Circumdances and your Civili- 
ties \ I say, nevertheless, I do not look upon you, who call 
yourselves reform’d, without some Charity: I dare not 
say, tbal I know it is our Opinion in general ; I say, I dare not 
say, that you cannot be sav’d : I will by no means limit the 



Farther Adventures o/RobinsonCrusoe 41 

Mercy of Christ so far, as to think that he cannot receive 
you into the Bosom of his Church in a Manner to u^un- 
perceivable, and which it is impossible for us to know, 
and I hope you have the same Charity for us ; I pray daily 
for your being all restor’d to Christ’s Church, by whatso- 
ever Methods he, who is All-wise^ is pleas’d to direft : In 
the iBcan time, sure you will allow it toconsift with me, as 
a Roman^ to distinguish far between a ProteSlant and a 
Pagan; between one that calls on Jesus ChriSl, tho’ in a 
Way which I do not think is according to the true Faith, 
and a Savage, a Barbarian, that knows no God, no ChriSl, 
no Redeemer; and if you are not within the Pale of the 
Catholick Church, we hope you are nearer being reStor’d 
to it than those that know nothing of God or his Church : 
And I rejoice therefore when I see this poor Man, who 
you say has been a Profligate, and almoSt a Murderer, 
kneel down and pray to Jesus ChriSI, as we suppose he 
did, tho’ not fully enlighten’d; believing that God, from 
whom every such Work proceeds, will sensibly touch his 
Heart, and bring him to the further Knowledge of that 
Truth in his own Time ; and if God shall influence this 
poor Man to convert and in^ruft the ignorant Savage his 
Wife, I can never believe that he shall be caft away him- 
self; and have I not Reason then to rejoyce, the nearer 
any are brought to the Knowledge of Chri^, tho’ they 
may not be brought quite home into the Bosom of the 
Catholick Church, ju^ at the time when I may desire it? 
leaving it to the Goodness of Christ to perfeft his Work 
in his own Time, and his own Way. Certainly I would 
rejoyce if all the Savages in America were brought like 
this poor Woman to pray to God, tho’ they were to be all 
Prote^lants at fir^f , rather than they should continue Pa- 
gansandHeathens; firmly believing, that he that had be- 



' « 

42 Farther Adventures o/RobinsonCrusoe 

flow’d the fir^ Light to them, would further illuminate 
therti with^ Beam of his heavenly Grace, and bring them 
into the Pale of his Church when he should see good. 

I was astonish’d at the Sincerity and Temper of this 
truly pious RapiSt, as much as I was oppress’d by the 
Power of his Reasoning ; and it presently occurr’d to my 
Thoughts, that if such a Temper was universal, we«>*i'ght 
be all Catholick Christians, whatever Church or particu- 
lar Profession we join’d to, or join’d in; that a Spirit of 
Charity would soon work us all up into right Principles; 
and in a Word, as he thought that the like Charity would 
make us all Catholicks, so I told him I believ’d, had all 
the Members of his Church the like Moderation, th6y 
would soon be all ProteStants. And there we left that Part, 
for we never disputed at all. 

However, I talk’d to him another way, and taking him 
by the Hand, my Friend, says I, I wish all the Clergy of the 
Roman Church were bleft with such Moderation, and 
had an equal Share of your Charity. I am entirely of your 
Opinion ; but I muSl tell you, that if you should preach 
such Do6lrine in Spain or Italy, they would put you into 
the Inquisition. 

It may be so, said he, I know not xyhat they might do 
in Spain or Italy, but I will not say they would be the bet- 
ter ChriSlians for that Severity, for I am sure there is no 
Heresy in too much Charity. 

Well,as Will. Atkins and his Wife were gone, our Busi- 
ness there was over ; so we went back our own Way ; and 
when we came back, we found them waiting to be call’d 
in ; observing this, I ask’d my Clergyman if we should 
discover to him that we had seen him under the Bush, or 
no; and it was his Opinion we should not; but that we 
should talk to him firft, and hear what he would say to us ; 



Farther Adventures (^Robinson Crusoe 43 

so we call’d him in alone, nodBody being in the Place but 
our selves; and I began with him thus : 

Will. Atkins^ said I, prithee what Education had you? 
What was your Father? 

W . A. A better Man than ever I shall be. Sir^ my Father ^ 
was a Clergyman. 

What Education did he give you? 

W. A. He would have taught me well, Sir; but I de- 
spis’d all Education, Inftruftion, or Correftion, like a 
Bea^l as I was. 

R. C. It’s true, Solomon says. He that despises Reproof is 
brutish. 

*W . A. Ay, Sir, I was brutish indeed, I murder’d my 
Father : For God’s sake. Sir, talk no more about that. Sir, 
I murder’d my poor Father. 

Pr. Ha! a Murderer!* 

*Here the PrieSl Started (for I interpreted every Word 
as he spoke it) and look'd pale. It seems he believ'd 
that Will, had really kill’d his own Father. 

R. C. No, no. Sir, I do not understand him so. Will. 
explain yourself, you did not kill your Father, did 
you, with your own Hands? 

W . A. No, Sir, I did not cut his Throat, but I cut the 
Thread of all his Comforts, and shorten’d his Days; I 
broke his Heart by the moft ungrateful unnatural Re- 
turn, for the moSl tender affectionate Treatment that ever 
Father gave, or Child could receive. 

i?. C. Well, I did not ask you about your Father, to ex- 
tort this Confession ; I pray God give you Repentance for 
it, and forgive you that, and all your other Sins ; but I ask’d 
you, because I see, that tho’ you have not much Learn- 



44 Farther Adveittures o/’RobinsonCrusoe 

ing, yet you are not so ignora/>t as some are in Things that 
are’Good^ that you have known more of Religion a great 
deal than you have practised. 

JV. A. Tho’ you, Sir, did not extort the Confession that 
1 makeabout my Father, Conscience does ; and whenever 
we come to look back upon our Lives, the Sins again 
our indulgentParentsare certainly the fir^t that tovR2h'us ; 
the Wounds they make lie deepell, and the Weight they 
leave will lie heavier upon the Mind, of all the Sins we 
can commit. 

R. C. You talk too feelingly and sensibly for me Atkins ; 
I cannot bear it. 

IV. A. You bear it. Master! I dare say you know n‘b- 
thing of it. 

R. C. Yes, Atkins^ every Shore, every Hill, nay, I may 
say, every Tree in this Island is witness to the Anguish 
of my Soul, for my Ingratitude and base Usage of a good 
tender Father; a Father much like yours, by your De- 
scription ; and I murder’d my Father as well as you. Will, 
Atkins^ but I think for all that, my Repentance is short of 
yours too* by a great deal. 

*I would have said more, if I could have retrain'd my 
Passions ; hut I thought this -poor Man' s'Repentance 
was so much sincerer than mine, that I was going to 
leave of the Discourse and retire,forIwas surpriz'd 
with what he said\ and thought, that inSlead of my 
going about to teach and inllruH him, the Man was 
made a Teacher and InSlrudor to me, in a moSl sur- 
prizing and unexpeSed manner. 

I laid all this before the young Clergyman, who was 
greatly affected with it, and said to me ; Did I not say, Sir, 



Farther Adventures o/Robins©nCrusoe 4^ 

that when this Man was converted, he would preach tQ us 
all? I tell you, Sir, if this one Man be made a l5me Peni- 
tent, here will be no need of me, he will make Christians 
of all in the Island. But having a little compos’d my self, 

I renew’d my Discourse with Will. Atkins. 

, WILL., said /, How comes the Sense.of this 
Matter to touch you juSt now? 

W. A. Sir, you have set me about a Work that has 
Struck a Dart thro’ my very Soul ; I have been talking 
about God and Religion to my Wife, in Order, as you di- 
rected me, to make a Christian of her, and she has preach- 
ed such a Sermon to me, as I shall never forget while I 
live. 

R. C. No, no, it is not your Wife has preach’d to you;, 
but when you were moving religious Arguments to her, 
Conscience has flung them back upon you. 

W. A. Ay, Sir, withsuch a Force as is not to be resisted. 

R. C. Pray Will, let us know what pass’d between you 
and your Wife, for I know something of it already. 

W. A. Sir, it is impossible to give you a full Account of 
it ; I am too full to hold it, and yet have no Tongue to ex- 
press ; but let her have said what she will, and tho’ I can- 
not give you an Acctount of it, this I can tell you of it, that 
I resolve to amend and reform my Life. 

R. C. But tell us some of it. How did you begin Will? 
For this has been an extraordinary Case, that’s certain. 
She has preach’d a Sermon, indeed, if she has wrought 
this upon^o«, 

W. A. Why, I fir^ told her the Nature of our Laws 
about Marriage, and what the Reasons were, that Men 
andWomenwereoblig’d to enter into such CompaCls, as 
it was neither in the Power of one or other to break; that 
otherwise, Order and Ju^ice could not be maintain’d,..

and Mei^ would run from their Wives, and abandon their 
Children, mix confusedly with one another, and neither 
Families be kept entire, or Inheritances be settled by legal 
Descent. 

R. C. You talk like a Civilian, Will\ could you make 
her understand what you meant by Inheritance a«d Fa- 
milies? they know no such Thing among the Savages, but 
marry any how, without regard to Relation, Consan- 
guinity, or Family; Brother and SiSter, nay, as I have 
been told, even the Father and Daughter, and Son and 
the Mother. 

W. A. I believe. Sir, you are misinform’d, and my Wife 
assures me of the contrary, and that they abhor it; per- 
haps, for any farther Relations they may not be so exadl 
as we are; but she tells me they never touch one another 
in the near Relations you speak of. 

R. C. Well, what did she say, to what you told her. 

PF. A. She said, she lik’d it very well, and it was much 
better than in her Country. 

R. C. But did you tell her what Marriage was? 

PF. A. Ay, ay, there began all our Dialogue. I ask’dher 
if she would be marry’d to me our Way? She ask’d me 
what Way that was? I told her Marriage was appointed 
by God ; and here we had a ^Irange Talk together, indeed, 
as ever Man and Wife had I believe. 

N.B. 'This Dialogue between W. Atkins and his PFifey 
as I took it down in PF Htingy juSl after be told it mey 
was as follows. ^ 

fTtfc, Godl Wbs[ 

in your Country? 

PF . A. Yes, my Dear, God is in every Country. 



Farther Adventures o/^obinsonCrus6e 47 

Wife, No you God in my Country; my Country have 
the great old Benamuckee God. 

fF. A. Child, I am very unfit to shew you who God is ; 
God is in Heaven, and made the Heaven and the Earth, 
the Sea, and all that in them is. 

Vdije. No makee de Earth ; no, you God make all Earth, 
no make my Country.* 

*W. A. laugh'd a little at her Expression of God not 
making her Country. 

mWiJe. No Laugh, why Laugh me? This no Thing to 
Laugh.* 

*He wasjuSlly reprov'd by his fVifeyfor she was more 
serious than he atfirU. 

fV. A. That’s true indeed, I will not Laugh any more 
my Dear. 

Wije. Why you say, you God make all? 

W. A. Yes, Child, our God made the whole World, and 
you, and I, and all Things; for he is the only true God, 
there is no God but him, he lives for ever in Heaven. 

Wije. Why you no tell me long ago? 

W. A. That’s true indeed, but I have been a wicked 
Wretch, andhave not only forgotten to acquaintthee with 
any Thing before, but have lived without God in the 
World my self. 

Wije. What have you de great God in you Country, 
you no kno’ him? No say O to him? No do good Thing 
for him? That no possible! 

W. A. It is too true ; tho’ for all that, we live as if there 
was no God in Heaven, or that he had no Power onEarth. 

Wije . ^ut why, God\et you do soil ^hy he no mahee 
you good live. 



48 Farther Adventures o/RobinsonCrusoe 

W. A. It is all our own Fault. 

Wife. But you say me, he is Great, much Great, have 
much great Power; can makee kill, when he will ; why he 
no makee kill when you no serve him? No say O to him? 
No be good Mans. 

W. A. That is true; he might ^rike me Dead,jitid I 
ought to expeft it, for I have been a wicked Wretch, that 
is true ; but God is merciful, and does not deal with us as 
we deserve. 

Wife. But then, do not you tell God Tankee for that 
too. 

/F. A. No, indeed, I have not thank’d God for his M^r- 
cy, any more than I have fear’d God for his Power. 

IVtJe. Than you God no God ; me no think, believe, he 
be such one, great much Power, Strong; no makee kill 
you tho’ you makee him much Angry. 

fV. A, What I Will my wicked Lire hinder you from be- 
lieving in God? what a dreadful Creature am I ; and what 
a sad Truth is it, that the horrid Lives of Chri^ians hin- 
ders the Conversion of Heathens? 

JViJe. How me tink you have great much God* up 
there, and yet no do well, no do good Thing? can he tell? 
Sure he no tell what you do. 

*She -points up to Heaven. 

W. A. Yes, yes, he knows and sees all Things ; he hears 
us speak, sees what we do, knows what we think, tho’ we 
do not speak. 

fVife. Whatl he no hear you swear, curse, speak the 
great Damn. * 

fV, A. Yes, yes, he hears it all. 

Wife. Where be then the muchee great Power strong. 

W. A. He is merciful, that’s all we can say for it; and 



Farther Adventures o/RobinsonCrusoe 49 

this proves him to be the ?rue God; he is God and not 
Man ; and therefore we are not consum’d.* * 

*Here Will. Atkins told us he was Struck with Horror, 
to think how he could tell his Wife so clearly that God 
sees, and hears, and knows the secret Thoughts of the 
Heart, and all that we do-, and yet that he had dar'd 
to do all the vile Things he had done. 

Wife. Merciful ! what you call that.? 

W. A. He is our Father and Maker, and he pities and 
spares us. 

Wife. So then he never makee kill, never angry when 
you do wicked ; then he no good himself, or no great able. 

W. A. Yes, yes, my Dear, he is infinitely good, and in- 
finitely great, and able to punish too, and sometimes to 
shew his Ju^ice and Vengeance, he lets fly his Anger to 
destroy Sinners, and make Examples ; many are cut off in 
their Sins. 

Wife. But no make kill you yet, then he tellyou may be 
that he no make you kill, so you make de Bargain with 
him, you do bad Thing, he no be angry at you, when he 
be angry ^t other Mans. 

W. A. No indeed, my Sins are all Presumptions upon 
his Goodness; and he would be infinitely juft if he de- 
ftroy’d me, as he has done other Men. 

Wife. Well, and yet no kill, no makee you dead, what 
you say to him for that, you no tell him Tankee for all that 
too? 

W. A. I am an unthankful, ungrateful Dog, that’strue. 

Wife. Why? He no makee you much good better, you 
say he makee you. 

W. A. He made me as he made all the World; ’tis I 

VOL. HI e. 



50 Farther Adventures o^Robinson Crusoe 
have deform’d my self, ancf abus’d his Goodness, and 
made my'self an abominable Wretch. 

Wife. I wish you makee God know me, I no makee 
him angry, I no do bad wicked Thing. 

Here Will. Atkins said his Heart sunk within him, to 
' hear a poor untaught Creature desire to be tau'ght to 
know God, and he such a wicked Wretch, that he 
could not say one Word to her about God, but what 
the Reproach of his own Carriage would make moU 
irrational to her to believe ; nay, that already she had 
toldhim,thatshe could not believe in God, because he 
that was so wicked was not destroy'd. 

W. A. My Dear, you mean, you wish I could teach you 
to know God, not God to know you ; for he knows you al- 
ready, and every Thought in your Heart. 

Wife. Why then he know what I say to you now? He 
know me wish to know him; how shall me know who 
makee me? 

W. A. Poor Creature, he mu^l teach thee, I cannot 
teach thee ; I’ll pray to him to teach thee to know him, and 
to forgive me that I am unworthy to teach thee. 

^he poor Fellow was in such an Agony at her desiring 
him to make her know God, and her wishing to know 
him, that, he said, he fell down on his Knees before 
her, and pray'd to God to enlighten her Mind with 
the savingKnowledge of Jesus Christ, and to pardon 
his Sins, and accept of his being the unworthy InStru~ 
ment of inStruSling her in the Principles of Relimt&, 
after which, he sat down by her again, and their Dia- 
logue went on. N.B. This was the Time when we 
saw him kneel down, and lift up his Hands. 



Farther Adventures o/I^obinsonCrusoe 51 

Wife. What you put down the Knee for? "yVhat you 
hold up the Hand for? What you say? Who you speak to? 
What is all that? 

W. A. My Dear, I bow my Knees in Token of my Sub- 
mission to him that made me ; I said O to him, as you call 
it, and as you say, your old Men do to their Idol Bena- 
mukee ; that is, I pray’d to him. 

Wije. What you say O to him for? 

W. A. I pray’d to him to open your Eyes, and your 
Understanding, that you may know him,andbe accepted 
by him. 

•Wife. Can he do that too? 

W. A. Yes, he can, he can do all Things. 

Wife. But now he hear what you say? 

W. A. Yes, he has bid us pray to him, and promis’d to 
hear us. 

Wife. Bid you pray? When he bid you? How he bid 
you? What! you hear him speak? 

W. A. No, we do not hear him speak, but he has re- 
veal’d himself many Ways to us. 

Here he was at a great Loss to make her understand^ 
that God hasreveaV d himself to us by his Word, and 
what his Word was: But at laSl he told it her thus. 


W. A. God has spoken to some good Men in former 
Days, even from Heaven, by plain Words; and God has 
inspir’d good Men by his Spirit; and they have written 
all his Laws down in a Book. 

Wife. Me no understand that, where is Book? 

W. A. Alas, my poor Creature, I have not this Book; 
but I hope I shall one Time or other get it for you, and 



52 Farther Adventures o/RpsiNsoNCRusoE 

Herejbe embrac'd her with great Affeilion ; but with in- 
expressible Grief y that he had not a Bible. 

Wife. But how you makee me know, that GJod teachee 
them to write that Book? 

W. A. By the same Rule that we know him to be God^ 

Wife. What Rule, what Way you know him? 

W. A. Because he teaches and commands nothing but 
what is good, righteous, and holy; and tends to make us 
perfeftly good, as well as perfectly happy ; and because 
he forbids and commands us to avoid all that is wicked, 
that is evil in it self, or evil in its Consequences. , 

Wife. That me would underhand, that me fain see ; if 
he teachee all good Thing, forbid all wicked Thing, he 
reward all good Thing, punish all wicked Thing, he make 
all Thing, he give all Thing, he hear me when I say O to 
him, as you go do juft now ; he makee me good, if I wish 
be good, he spare me, no makee kill me, when I no be 
good ; all this you say he do, yet he be great God ; me take, 
think, believe him be great God ; me say O to him too 
with you my Dear. 

Here the poor Man could forbear no longer; but rais- 
ing her up, made her kneel by him, ahd he pray’d to God 
aloud to inflruft her in the Knowledge of himself by his 
Spirit, and that by some good Providence, if possible, she 
might sometime or other come to have a Bible, that she 
might read the Word of God, and be taught by it to know 
him. 

This was the Time that we saw him lift her up by th® 
Hand, and saw him kneel down by her, as above-...* 

They had several other Discourses it seems after urn, 
too long to set down here ; and particularly she made hihi 
promise, that since he confeft his own Life had'i%eett a 



Farther Adventures o/]^obinsonCrusoe 53 

wicked abominable Course of Provocation again^ God, 
that he would reform it, and not make God angry any 
more, lea^ he should him dead, as she call’d it, and 

then she should be left alone, and never be taught to know 
this God better; and lea^t he should be miserable, as he 
had told her wicked Men should be after Death. 

This was a Grange Account, and very alFedling to us 
both, but particularly to the young Clergyman ; he was 
indeed wonderfully surpriz’d with it, but under the great- 
est Affliftion imaginable, that he could not talk to her, 
that he could not speak English to make her understand 
him ; and as she spoke but very broken English, he could 
not understand her; However he turn’d himself to me, 
and told me, that he believed there muSt be more to do 
with this Woman than to marry her : I did not understand 
him at firSt, but at lengtk^he explain’d himself, {vizl) that 
she ought to bo^aptiz’d.- 

I agreed witndrim in that Part readily, and was for go- 
ing about it presently: No, no, hold Sir, said he, tho’ I 
would have her be Baptiz’d by all Means, yet I muSt ob- 
serve, that Will, her Husband, has indeed brought 

her in a wonderful Manner to be willing to embrace a re- 
ligious Life, and has given her juSt Ideas of the Being of a 
God, of his Power, JuStice, Mercy; yet I desire to know 
of him, ifhe has said any Thing to her of Jesus ChriSt, and 
of the Salvation of Sinners, of the Nature of Faith in him, 
and Redemption by him, of the Holy Spirit, the Resurrec- 
tion, the la^ Judgment, and a future State. 

I call’d Will. Atkins again, and ask’d him ; but the poor 
Fellow fell immediately into Tears, and told us he had 
said something to her of all those things, but that he was 
himself so wicked a Creature, and his own Conscience so 
reproach’d him with his horrid ungodly Life, that he 



^4 Farther Adventures of R o binsonCrusoe 

trembled at the Apprehensions, that her Knowledge of 
him, shou'id lessen the Attention she should give to those 
Things, and make her rather contemn Religion than re- 
ceive it : But he was assur’d, he said, that her Mind waS so 
dispos’d to receive due Impressions of all those Things, 
that if i would but discourse with her, she would make it 
appear to my Satisfaction, that my Labour would not be 
lo^ upon her. 

Accordingly I call’d her in, and placing my self as In- 
terpreter between my religious Prie^ and the Woman, I 
entreated him to begin with her; but sure such a Sermon 
was never preach’d by a popish Priest in these latter Agf s 
of the World; and, as I told biniy I thought he had all the 
Zeal, all the Knowledge, all the Sincerity of a Chriftian, 
without the Error of a Roman Catbolick\ and that I took 
him to be such a Clergy-man, as the Roman Bishops were 
before the Church of Rome assum’d spiritual Sovereignty 
over the Consciences of Men. 

In a Word, he brought the poor Woman to embrace 
the Knowledge of Chrill, and of Redemption by him, not 
with Wonder and Astonishment only, as she did the firSt 
Notions of a God, but with Joy and Faith, with an Affec- 
tion and a surprizing Degree of Understanding, scarce 
to be imagin’d, much less to be express’d ; and at her own 
Request she was Baptiz’d. 

When he was preparing to Baptize her, I entreated 
him that he would perform that Office with some Cau- 
tion, that the Man might not perceive he was of the Ro- 
man Church, if possible, because of other ill Consequen- 
ces which might attend a Difference among us in that* 
very Religion, which we were inStrudting the other in. He 
told me, that as he had no consecrated Chapel, no proper 
Things for the Office, I should see he would do it in a 



Farther Adventures of'^ohi^sovsQv.issoE SS 

Manner that I should not know by it, that he was a Ro~ 
man Catholickmy self, if I had not known it before : And 
SO’ he did ; for saying only some Words over to himself in 
Latin^ which I could not underhand, he pour’d a whole 
Dish-ful of Water upon the Woman’s Head, pronounc- 
ing in French^ very loud, MARY, which was thfi Name 
her Husband desir'd me to give her \ for I was her Godfather^ 
I Baptize thee in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, 
and of the Holy Ghoft; so that none could know any 
Thing by it, what Religion he was of: He gave the Bene- 
diftion afterwards in Latin \ but either JVill. Atkins did 
npt know but it was in French, or else did not take Notice 
of it at that time. 

As soon as this was over we married them; and after 
the Marriage was over he turn’d himself to Will. Atkins, 
and in a very affedfionate Manner exhorted him, not only 
to persevere in that good Disposition he was in, but to 
support the Convidlions that were upon him by a Resolu- 
tion to reform his Life; told him it was in vain to say he 
repented, if he did not forsake his Crimes: Represented 
to him, how God had honoured him with being the In- 
ftrument of bringing his Wife to the Knowledge of the 
Chriftian JReligioir, and that he should be careful he did 
not dishonour the Grace of God, and that if he did, he 
would see the Heathen a better Chriftian than himself, 
the Savage converted, and the Inftrument caft away. 

He said a great many good Things to them both, and 
then recommending themina few Words to God’s Good- 
ness, gave them the Benediction again, I repeating every 
Thing to them in English, and thus ended the Ceremony : 
I think it was the moft pleasant, agreeable Day to me 
that ever I passed in my whole Life. 

But my Clergy-man had not done yet; his Thoughts 



56 Farther Adventures of R o binson Crusoe 

hung continually upon the Conversion of the seven and 
thirty Savhges, and fain he would have flay’d upon the 
Island to have undertaken it; but I convinc’d him, fir^l, 
that his Undertaking was impradlicable in it self; and 
secondly, that perhaps I would put it into a Way of being 
done in, his Absence to his Satisfaction ; of which, by and 

Having thus brought the Affair of the Island to a nar- 
row Compass, I was preparing to go on board the Ship, 
when the young Man who I had taken out of the fam- 
ish’d Ship’s Company, came to me, and told me, he un- 
derwood I had a Clergyman with me, and that I had caused 
the English Men to be married to the Savages, whom they 
called Wives ; that he had a Match too, which he desir’d 
might be finish’d before I went, between two ChriWians, 
which he hop’d would not be disagreeable to me. 

I knew this muW be the young Woman who was his 
Mother’s Servant, for there was no other ChriWian Wo- 
man on the Island; so I began to persuade him not to do 
any Thing of that Kind rashly, or because he found him- 
self in this solitary CircumWance : I represented to him, 
that he had some considerable SubWance in the World, 
and good Friends, as I underWood by himself, ^nd by his 
Maid also; that the Maid was not only poor and a Ser- 
vant, but was unequal to him, she being six or seven and 
twenty Years old, and he not above seventeen or eigh- 
teen ; that he might very probably, with my AssiWance, 
make a remove from this Wilderness, and come into his 
own Country again, and that then it would be a thousand 
to one but he would repent his Choice ; and the Dislike of* 
that CircumWance might be disadvantagious to both : I 
was going to say more, but he interrupted me, smiling, 
and told me, with a great deal of Mode^, that I miClook 



Farther Adventures o/RobinsonCrusoe 57 

in my Guesses, that he had nothing of that Kind in his 
Thoughts, his present Circumstance being mdancholly 
and disconsolate enough ; and he was very glad to hear 
that I had Thoughts of putting them in a Way to see their 
Country again, and nothing should have put him upon 
Slaying there, but that the Voyage I was going was so ex- 
ceeding long and hazardous, and would carry him quite 
out of the Reach of all his Friends ; that he had nothing to 
desire of me, but that I would settle him in some little 
Property in the Island where he was, give him a Servant 
or two and some few Necessaries, and he would settle 
himself here like a Planter, waiting the good Time, when 
if ever I return’d to England^ I would redeem him, and 
hop’d I would not be unmindful of him when I came into 
England; that he would give me some Letters to his 
Friends in London^ to let them know how good I had been 
to him, and in what Part of the World, and what Circum- 
stance I had left him in ; that he promised me, that when- 
ever I redeemed him, the Plantation, and all the Improve- 
ments he had made upon it, let the Value be what it would, 
should be wholly mine. 

His Discourse was very prettily deliver’d, considering 
his Youth, and was the more agreeable to me, because he 
told me positively the Match was not for himself: I gave 
him all possible Assurances, that if I liv’d to come safe to 
England^ I would deliver his Letters and do his Business 
effeftually, and that he might depend I would never for- 
get the Circumstance I had left him in ; but Slill I was im- 
patient to know who was the Person to be married, upon 
which he told me it was my 'Jack of all TradeSy and his 
Maid Susan. 

I was moSl agreeably surpriz’d, when he nam’d the 
Match, for indeed I thought it very suitable ; the Charac- 



58 Farther Adventures of a SON Crusoe 
ter of that Man I have given already ; and as for the Maid, 
she was a Very honest, modest, sober and religious young 
Woman, had a very good Share of Sense, was agreeable 
enough in her Person, spoke very handsomely and to the 
Purpose, always with Decency and good Manners, and 
not backward to speak when any Thing required it, or 
impertinently forward to speak when it was not her Busi- 
ness; very handy and housewifely in any Thing that was 
before her ; an excellent Manager, and fit indeed to have 
been Governess to the whole Island ; she knew very well 
how to behave to all kind of Folks she had about her, and 
to better, if she had found any there. , 

The Match being proposed in this Manner, we mar- 
ried them the same Day, and as I was Father at the Altar, 
as I may say, and gave her away, so I gave her a Portion ; 
for I appointed her and her Husband a handsome large 
Space of Ground for their Plantation; and indeed this 
Match and the Proposal the young Gentleman made to 
give him a small Property in the Island, put me upon par- 
celling it out amongst them, that they might not quarrel 
afterwards about their Situation. 

This sharing out the Land to them, I left to Will. At- 
kins, who indeed was now grown a moft sotjer, grave, 
managing Fellow, perfeftly reform’d, exceeding Pious 
and Religious, and as far as I may be allow’d to speak posi- 
tively in such a Case, I verily believe, was a true sincere 
Penitent. 

He divided Things so juftly, and so much to every 
one’s Satisfadlion, that they only desired one general 
Writing under my Hand for the whole, which I caused 
to be drawn up and sign’d and seal’d to them, setting out 
the Bounds and Situation of every Man’s Plantation, and 
teftifying that I gave them thereby severally a Right to 



Farther Adventures <?/RobinsonCru'soe co 

the whole Possession and Inheritance of the respecflive 
Plantations or Farms, with their Improvemenfs to them 
and their Heirs, reserving all the re^ of the Island as my 
own Property, and a certain Rent for every particular 
Plantation after eleven Years, if I, or any one from me, or 
in my Name came to demand it, producing an ^ttefted 
Copy of the same Writing. 

As to the Government and Laws among them, I told 
them I was not capable of giving them better Rules, than 
they were able to give themselves, only made them pro- 
mise me to live in Love and good Neighbourhood with 
o|ie another; and so I prepared to leave them. 

One Thing I mu^l not omit, and this is, that being now 
settled in a Kind of Common-Wealth among themselves, 
and having much Business in Hand, it was but odd to 
have seven and thirty Indians live in a Nook of the Island 
independent, and indeed un-employ’d ; for excepting the 
providing themselves Food, which they had Difficulty 
enough in too, sometimes, they had no manner of Busi- 
ness or Property to manage : I propos’d therefore to the 
Governour Spaniard, that he should go to them with Fri- 
day'& Father, and propose to them to remove, and either 
plant for 1;Jiemselves, or take them into their several Fa- 
milies as Servants to be maintain’d for their Labour, but 
without being absolute Slaves, for I would not admit 
them to make them Slaves by Force by any Means, be- 
cause they had their Liberty given them by Capitulation, 
and as it were Articles of Surrender, which they ought 
not to break. 

They mo^l willingly embrac’d the Proposal, and came 
all very chearfully along with him; so we allotted them 
Land, and Plantations, which three oi four accepted of, 
but all the reil chose to be employ’d as Servants in the 



6o Farther Adventures o/^obinsonCrusoe 

several Families we had settled ; and thus my Colony was 
in a Manner settled, as follows: The Spaniards possess’d 
my original Habitation, which was the Capital City, and 
extended their Plantations all along the Side of the Brook, 
which made the Creek that I have so often describ’d, as 
far as piy Bower; and as they increas’d their Culture, it 
went always Eastward; the English liv’d in the North- 
Ea^t Part, where W. Atkins^ and his Comrades began, 
and came on Southward, and South-Weft, towards the 
back Part of the Spaniards, and every Plantation had a 
great Addition of Land to take in, if they found Occasion, 
so that they need not joftle one another for want of Roo^n. 

All the Eaft End of the Island was left uninhabited, 
that if any of the Savages should come on Shore there, 
only for their usual cuftomary Barbarities, they might 
come and go, if they difturb’d no Body, no Body would 
difturb them ; and no doubt but they were often ashore, 
and went away again ; for I never heard that the Planters 
were ever attack’d or difturb’d any more. 

It now came into my Thoughts, that I had hinted to 
my Friend the Clergy-man, that the Work of Converting 
the Savages, might perhaps be set on Foot in his Absence, 
to his Satisfaftion ; and I told him, that now ^thought it 
was put in a fair Way ; for the Savages being thus divided 
among the Chriftians, if they would but everyone of them 
do their Part with those which came under their Hands, 
I hop’d it might have a very good Effeft. 

He agreed presently in that, if, said he, they will do 
their Part ; but how, says he, shall we obtain that of them? 
I told him, we would call them together, and leave it in* 
Charge with them, or go to them one by one, which he 
thought beft, so we divided it; he to speak to the Spani- 
ards, who were all Papifts, and I to the English, who were 



Farther Adventures of Rp binsonCruSoe 6r 
allProte^lants ; and we recommended it earnestly to them, 
and made them promise, that they never would make any 
Di^inftion of Papi^ or Protestant, in their exhorting the 
Savages to turn Christians ; but teach them the general 
Knowledge of the true God, and of their Saviour Jesus 
Christ; and they likewise promis’d us, that they .would 
never have any Differences or Disputes one with another 
about Religion. 

When I came to JV. Atkins's House, I may call it so, for 
such a House, or such a Piece of Basket-Work, I believe, 
was not Standing in the World again ; I say, when I came 
there, I found the young Woman I have mention’d above, 
and iV. Atkins's Wife, were become Intimates; and this 
prudent religious young Woman, had perfected the 
Work Will. Atkins had begun; and tho’ it was not 
above four Days after what I have related, yet the new 
baptiz’d Savage Woman was made such a Christian, as I 
have seldom heard of any like her in all my Observation, 
or Conversation, in the World. 

It came next into my Mind in the Morning before I 
went to them, that amongSt all the needful Things I had 
to leave with them, I had not left them a Bible, in which, I 
shew’d my self less* considering for them, than my good 
Friend the Widow was for me, when she sent me the Car- 
go of an hundred Pounds from Lisbon, where she pack’d 
up 3 Bibles, and a Prayer-book : However, the good Wo- 
man ’sCharity had agreater Extent than ever she imagin ’d ; 
for they were reserv’d for the Comfort and InSlruftion of 
those, that made much better Use of them than I had 
done. 

I took one of the Bibles in my Pocket, and when I came 
to Will. Atkins's Tent or House, and found the young 
Woman, and Atkins's baptiz’d Wife, had been discours- 



6? Farther Adventures of binsonCrusoe 

ing of Religion together; for W. Atkins, told it me, with a 
great deat of Joy: I ask’d if they were together now, and he 
said, yes ; so I went into the House, and he with me, and 
we found them together very earned in Discourse ; O Sir, 
says IVill. Atkins, when God has Sinners to reconcile to 
himself, and Aliens to bring Home, he never wants a 
Messenger; my Wife has got a new Inftruftor ; I knew I 
was unworthy, as I was uncapable of that Work; that 
young Woman has been sent hither from Heaven ; she is 
enough to convert a whole Island of Savages; the young 
Woman blush’d, and rose up to go away, but I desir’d her 
to sit ^ill ; I told her, she had a good Work upon her 
Hands, and I hop’d God would bless her in it. 

We talk’d a little, and I did not perceive they had any 
Book among them, tho’ I did not ask; but I put my 
Hand in my Pocket, and pull’d out my Bible ; here, says I, 
to Atkins, I have brought you an Assistant that perhaps 
you had not before ; the Man was so confounded, that he 
was not able to speakfor some Time ; but recovering him- 
self, he takes it with both his Hands, and turning to his 
Wife, here, my Dear, says he ; did not I tell you, our God, 
tho’ he lives above, could hear what we said? Here’s the 
Book I pray’d for, when you and I kheel’d down under 
the Bush ; now God has heard us, and sent it ; when he had 
said so, the Man fell into such Transports of a passionate 
Joy, that between the Joy of having it, and giving God 
Thanks for it, the Tears run down his Face like a Child 
that was crying. 

The Woman was surprised, and was like to have run 
into a Miyake, that none of us were aware of; for she ' 
firmly believ’d God had sent the Book upon her Hus- 
band’s Petition; It is true, that providentially it was so, 
-and mightbe taken so in a consequent Sense ; but I believe 



Farther Adventures of R c) binsonCrusoe 63 
it would have been no difficult Matter at that Time, to 
have persuaded the poor Woman to have belidv’d, that 
an express Messenger came from Heaven, on purpose to 
bring that individual Book ; but it was too serious a Mat- 
ter, to suffer any Delusion to take Place ; so I turn’d to the 
young Woman and told her we did not desire to impose 
upon the new Convert, in her firft, and more ignorant 
understanding of Things; and begg’d her to explain to 
her, that Giod may be very properly said to answer our 
Petitions, when in the Course of his Providence, such 
Things are in a particular Manner brought to pass, as we 
petition’d for; but we do not expeft Returns from Hea- 
ven, in a miraculous and particular Manner, and that it is 
our Mercy, that it is not so. 

This the young Woman did afterwards effedtually ; so 
that there was, I assure you, no Prie^l-craft used here ; and 
I should have thought it one of the mo^l unjuftifiable 
Frauds in the World, to have had it so ; but the Surprise 
of Joy upon Will. Atkins^ is really not to be expressed ; and 
there we may be sure, there was no Delusion : Sure, no 
Man was ever more thankful in the World for any Thing 
of its Kind, than he was for this Bible ; nor I believe, never 
any Man w,as glad of a Bible from a better Principle ; and 
tho’ he had been a mo^f profligate Creature, desperate, 
headlong, outragious, furious, and wicked to a great 
Degree ; yet this Man is a landing Rule to us all, for the 
well in^ufting Children, {vizi) that Parents should 
never give over to teach and inftruft, or ever despair of 
the Success of their Endeavours, let the Children be ever 
so obftinate, refraftory, or to Appearance, insensible of 
In^ruftion ; for if ever God in his Providence, touches the 
Consciences of such, the Force of their Education re- 
turns upon them, and the early Inftrudion of Parents 



64 Farther Adventures o/^obinsonCrusoe 

is not loft ; tho’ it may have been many Years laid asleep ; 
but sonie Time or other, they may find the Benefit 
of it. 

Thus it was with this poor Man ; however ignorant he 
was, or divefted of Religion and Chriftian Knowledge : 
He found he had some to do with now, more ignorant 
than himself ; and that the leaft Part of the Inftruftion of 
his good Father that could now come to his Mind, was of 
Use to him. 

Among the reft it occurr’d to him, he said, how his 
Father us’d to insift much upon the inexpressible Value 
of the Bible; the Privilege and Blessing of it to Nations, 
Families, and Persons ; but he never entertain’d the leaft 
Notion of the Worth of it, till now; when being to talk to 
Heathens, Savages, and Barbarians, he wanted the Help 
of the written Oracle for his Assiftance. 

The young Woman was very glad of it also for the pre- 
sent Occasion, tho’ she had one, and so had the Youth on 
board our Ship among their Goods, which were not yet 
brought on Shore ; and now having said so many Things 
of this young Woman, I cannot omit telling one Story 
more of her, and my self, which has something in it very 
informing and remarkable. ‘ , 

I have related, to what Extremity the poor young Wo- 
man was reduced ; how her Miftress was ftarv’ d to Death, 
and did die on board that unhappy Ship we met at Sea; 
and how the whole Ship’s Company being reduc'd to the 
laft Extremity ; the Gentlewoman, and her Son, and this 
Maid, were firft hardly used as to Provisions, and at laft 
totally neglefted and 
‘^£ve\a§l Extremity of Hunger. 

One Day being discoursing with her upon the Ex- 
tremities they suflFer’d, I ask’d her if she could describe 



Farther Adventures of'^ obinsonCrusoe 65 

by what she had felt, what it was to ^arve, and how it ap- 
pear’d; she told me, she believ’d she could; anS she told 
her Tale very di^linftly thus. 

“Firft, Sir, said she, we had for some Days far’d ex- 
ceeding hard, and suffer’d very great Hunger; but now 
at lait, we were wholly without Food of any Kind„except 
Sugar, and a little Wine, and a little Water. The firft Day 
after I had receiv’d no Food at all, I found my self towards 
Evening, firft empty and sickish at my Stomach, and 
nearer Night mightily enclin’d to yawning and sleepy; I 
laid down on a Couch in the great Cabin to sleep, and 
slept about three Hours, and awak’d a little refresh’d; 
having taken a Glass of Wine when I lay down ; after be- 
ing about three Hours awake, it being about five a-Clock 
in the Morning, I found my self empty, and my Stomach 
sickish, and lay ’d down again, but could notsleep atall, be- 
ing very faint, and ill ; and thus I continu’d all the second 
Day, with a ftrangeV ariety, firft Hungry, then sick again, 
with reachings to vomit; the second Night being oblig’d 
to go to Bed again, withoutanyFood,morethanaDraught 
of fair Water; and being asleep, I dream’d I was at Bar- 
badoes, and that the Market was mightily ftock’d with 
Provisions^ that I bought some for my Miftress, and went 
and din’d very heartily. 

“I thought my Stomach was as full after this as any 
would have been after, or at a good Dinner; but when I 
wak’d, I was exceedingly sunk in my Spirits, to find my 
self in the extremity of Famine : The laft Glass of Wine 
we had, I drank, and put Sugar in it, because, of its having 

Subftance in the Stomach for the digesting Office to work 
upon, I found the only Effedl of the Wine was, to raise 
disagreeable Fumes from the Stomach, into the Head; 

VOL. Ill f 



66 Farther Adventures (?/!iyLoBiNsoN Crusoe 

and I lay, as they told me, ftupid, and senseless, as one 
drunk for some Time. 

“The third Day in the Morning, after a Night of strange 
and confus’d inconsistent Dreams; and rather dozing 
than sleeping, I wak’d, ravenous and furious, with Hun- 
ger; apd I question, had not my Understanding return’d 
and conquer’d it? I say, I queStion whether if I had been 
a Mother, and had had a little Child with me, its Life 
would have been safe or not? 

“This lasted about three Hours ; during which Time 
I was twice raging mad as any Creature in Eedlam^ as my 
young Master told me, and as he can now inform you. 

“In one of these Fits of Lunacy or DiStraftion, whe- 
ther by the Motion of the Ship, or some Slip of my Foot, 
I know not; I fell down, and Struck my Face againSt the 
Corner of a Palat Bed in which my MiStress lay; and 
with the Blow the Blood gush’d out of my Nose ; and the 
Cabin Boy bringing me a little Bason, I sat down and bled 
into it a great deal ; and as the Blood run from me, I came 
to my self; and the Violence of the Flame or the Fever, I 
was in, abated, and so did the ravenous Part of the Hun- 
ger. 

“Then I grew sick, and reach’d to Vomi|:, but could 
not; for I had nothing in my Stomach to bring up : After 
I had bled some Time, I swoon’d, and they all believ’d I 
was dead ; but I came to my self soon after, and then had a 
moSl dreadful Pain in my Stomach, not to be described; 
not like the Cholick, but a gnawing eager Pain for Food ; 
and towards Night it went off with a kind of earneSfWish- 
ing or Longing for Food; something like, as I suppose, 
the Longing of a Woman with Child. I took another 
Draught of Water with Sugar in it, but my Stomach 
loathed the Sugar, and brought it all up again; then I 



Farther Adventures oft oBiNsoN Crusoe 67 

took a Draught of Water without Sugar, and that ^ay’d 
with me ; and I laid me down upon the Bed, praying mo^l 
heartily, that it would please God to take me away; and 
composing my Mind in Hopes of it, I slumber’d a while, 
and then waking, thought my self dying, being light 
with Vapours from an empty Stomach, I recommended 
my Soul then to God, and earne^ly wish’d that some 
Body would throw me into the Sea. 

“All this while my Mi^ress lay by me juft as I thought 
expiring, but bore it with much more Patience than I, and 
gave the laft bit of Bread she had left to her Child, my 
yo^ng Mafter, who would not have taken it, but she ob- 
lig’d him to eat it ; and I believe it sav’d his Life, 

“Towards the Morning I slept again, and firft when I 
awak’d, I fell into a violent Passion of Crying, and after 
that had a second Fit of violent Hunger; I got up raven- 
ous, and in a moft dreadful Condition ; had my Miftress 
been dead, as much as I lov’d her, I am certain, I should 
have eaten a Piece of her Flesh, with as much Relish, and 
as unconcern’d, as ever I did the Flesh of any Creature 
appointed for Food ; and once or twice I was going to bite 
my own Arm : At laft, I saw the Bason in which was the 
Blood I had. bled at fny Nose the Day before; I ran to it, 
and swallow’d it with such Hafte, and such a greedy Ap- 
petite, as if I had wonder’d no Body had taken it before, 
and afraid it should be taken from me now. 

“Tho’ after it was down, the Thoughts of it fill’d me 
with Horror, yet it check’d the Fit of Hunger, and I drank 
a Draught of fair Water, and was compos’d and refresh’d 
for some Hours after it : This was the 4th Day, and thus I 
held it, ’till towards Night, when within the Compass of 
three Hours, I had all these several Circumftances over 
again, one after another, {viz.) sick, sleepy, eagerly hun- 



68 Farther Adventures ^[^.obinson Crusoe 

gry, Pai^ in the Stomach, then ravenous again, then sick 
again, then lunatick, then crying, then ravenous again ; 
and so every quarter of an Hour, and my Strength waft- 
ed exceedingly: At Night I laid me down, having no 
Comfort, but in the Hope that I should die before 
Morning. 

“All this Night I had no Sleep; but the Hunger was 
now turn’d into a Disease; and I had a terrible Cholick 
and Griping, by Wind inftead of Food, having found its 
Way into the Bowels; and in this Condition I lay ’till 
Morning, when I was surpriz’d a little with the Cries and 
Lamentations of my young Mafter, who call’d out to me 
that his Mother was dead : I lifted my self up a little ; for I 
had not Strength to rise, but found she was not dead, 
tho’ she was able to give very little Signs of Life. 

“I had then such Convulsions in my Stomach, for want 
of some suftenance, that I cannot describe ; with such fre- 
quent Throws and Pangs of Appetite, that nothing but 
theTortures of Death can imitate ; an din this Condition I 
was when I heard the Seamen above cry out, A Sail, a 
Sail, and hallowand j ump about, as if they were diftrafted . 

‘ ‘ I was not able to get off from the Bed, and my M iftress 
much less; and my young Mafter was sq, sick, that I 
thought he had been expiring; so we could not open the 
Cabin Door, or get any Account what it was that occa- 
sion’d such a Combuftion, nor had we had any Conversa- 
tion with the Ship’s Company for two Days ; they having 
told us, that they had not a Mouthful of any Thing to eat 
in the Ship ; and they told us afterwards, they thought we 
had been dead. • 

“It was this dreadful Condition we were in when you 
were sent to save our Lives; and how you found us, Sir, 
you know as well as I, and better too.’’ 



Farther Adventures o/HobinsonCrusoe 69 

This was her own Relation, and is such a di^iinft Ac- 
count of starving to Death, as I confess, I never met with, 
and was exceeding entertaining to me; I am the rather 
apt to believe it to be a true Account, because the Youth 
gave me an Account of a good Part of it ; tho’ I mu^l own, 
not so di^tinft and so feelingly as his Maid; and the ra- 
ther, because it seems his Mother fed him at the Price of 
her own Life: But the poor Maid, tho’ her Con^itution 
being stronger than that of her Miftress, who was in 
Years, and a weakly Woman too, she might druggie har- 
der with it; I say, the poor Maid might be supposed to 
fegl the Extremity something sooner than her Mistress, 
who might be allowed to keep the la^l Bit somethinglonger 
thanshepartedwithany to relievethe Maid. No Question, 
as the Case is here related, if our Ship, or some other, had 
not so providentially met them, a few Days more would 
have ended all their Lives, unless they had prevented it 
by eating one another ; and even, that as their Case ftood, 
would have served them but a little while, they being 500 
Leagues fromany Land, orany Possibility of Relief,other 
than in the miraculous Manner it happen’d: But this is 
by the Way ; I return to my Disposition of Things among 
the People.* 

And, Firil, It is to be observ’d here, Thatfor many Rea- 
sons I did not think fit to let them know any Thing of the 
Sloop I had fram’d, and which I thought of setting up 
among them ; for I found, at leaU at my firSl comings such 
Seeds of Divisions among them, that I saw it plainly had 
I set up the Sloop, and left it among them, they would up- 
on every light Disguft have separated, and gone away 
from one another, or perhaps have turned Pirates, and so 
made the Island a Den of Thieves, instead of a Plantation 
of sober and religious People, so as I intended it ; nor did 



70 Farther Adventures o/UobinsonCrusoe 

I leave ttie two Pieces of Brass Cannon that I had on 
Board, or the two Quarter-Deck Guns, that my Nephew 
took extraordinarily for the same Reason : I thought it 
was enough to qualify them for a defensive War againft 
any that should invade them ; but not to set them up for 
an offensive War, or to encourage them to go Abroad to 
attack others, which in the End would only bring Ruin 
and Deftruftion upon themselvesandall their Undertak- 
ing: I reserv’d the Sloop therefore, and the Guns, for their 
Service another Way, as I shall observe in its Place. 

I have now done with the Island :I left them all in good 
Circumstances, and in a flourishing Condition, and we^it 
on board my Ship again the [fifth] day of \May^ having 
been five and twenty Days among them ; and as they were 
all resolv’d to Slay upon the Island ’till I came to remove 
them, I promis’d to send some further Relief from the 
BrasilSf if I could possibly find an Opportunity ; and par- 
ticularly I promis’d to send them some Cattel, such as 
Sheep, Hogs, and Cows : For as to the two Cows and 
Calves which I brought from England^ we had been 
oblig’d by the Length of our Voyage to kill them at Sea, 
for want of Hay to feed them. 

The next Day, giving them a Salute of five Guns at 
Parting, we set sail, and arriv’d at the Bay of All-Saints in 
the Brasils in about 2 2 Days ; meeting nothing remark- 
able in our Passage, but this. That about three Days after 
we sail’d, being becalm’d, and the Current setting strong 
to the E.N.E. running, as it were, into a Bay or Gulph on 
the Land Side, we were driven something out of our 
Course, and once or twice our Men cry’d Land to the* 
Ea^ard; but whether it was the Continent or Islands, 
we could not tell by any Means. 

But the third Day towards Evening, the Sea smooth, 



Farther Adventures of ^oia I vs Crusoe 71 

and the Weather calm, we saw the Sea, as it were, cover’d 
towards the Land with something very black, not being 
able to discover what it was, ’till after some Time, our 
chief Mate going up the main Shrowds a little Way, and 
looking at them with a Perspeftive, cry’d out it was an 
Army. I could not imagine what he meant by an Army, 
and spoke a little haftily, calling the Fellow a Fool, or 
some such Word: Nay, Sir, says he, don’t be angry, for 
’tis an Army and a Fleet too; for I believe there are a 
thousand Canoes, and you may see them paddle along, 
and they are coming towards us too, apace. 

J was a little surpriz’d then indeed, and so was my Ne- 
phew, the Captain ; for he had heard such terrible Stories 
of them in the Island, and having never been in those 
Seas before, that he could not tell what to think of it, but 
said two or three Times, we should all be devour’d. I muft 
confess, considering we were becalm’d, and the Current 
set ^rong towards the Shore, I lik’d it the worse : How- 
ever, I bad him not be afraid, but bring the Ship to an An- 
chor, as soon as we came so near to know that we muft en- 
gage them. 

The Weather continu’d calm, and they came on apace 
towards us j so I gave Order to come to an Anchor, and 
furle all our Sails : As for the Savages, I told them they had 
nothing to fear but Fire; and therefore they should get 
their Boats out, and faften them, one close by the Head, 
and the other by the Stern, and man them both well, and 
wait the Issue in that Pofture ; This I did, that the Men in 
the Boats might be ready with Skeets and Buckets to put 
out any Fire these Savages might endeavour to fix to the 
Out-side of the Ship. 

In this Pofture we lay by for them, and in a little while 
they came up with us ; but never was such a horrid Sight 



72 Farther Adventures of I?o binson Crusoe 
seen by Christians: My Mate was much mistaken in his 
Calculation of their Number, I mean of a thousand Ca- 
noes; the moSt we could make of them when they came 
up, being about a hundred and six and twenty; and a 
great many of them too ; for some of them had sixteen or 
seventeen Men in them, and some more; and the leaSt 
six or seven. 

When they came nearer to us, they seem’d to be Struck 
with Wonder and Astonishment, as at a Sight which they 
had doubtless never seen before ; nor could they at firSt, 
as we afterwards understood, know what to make of us : 
They came boldly up however very near to us, apd 
seem’d to go about to row round us ; but we call’d to our 
Men in the Boats, not to let them come too near them. 

This very Order brought us to an Engagement with 
them, without our designing it ; for five or six of their 
large Canoes came so near our Long-Boat, that our Men 
beckon’d with their Hands to them to keep back, which 
they understood very well, and went back; but at their 
Retreat, about 50 Arrows came on board us from those 
Boats; and one of our Men in the Long-Boat was very 
much wounded. 

However, I call’d to them not to'fire by any Means; 
but we handed down some Deal-Boards into the Boat, 
and the Carpenter presently setup a kind of a Fence, like 
waSte Boards, to cover them from the Arrows of the Sa- 
vages, if they should shoot again. 

About half an Hour afterwards they came all up in a 
Body a-Sfern of us, and pretty near us, so near that we* 
could easily discern what they were, tho’ we could not 
tell their Design : And I easily found they were some of 
my old Friends, the same Sort of Savages that I had been 



Farther Adventures (^XobinsonCrusoe 73 

used to engage with ; and in a little Time more they row’d 
a little farther out to Sea, ’till they came direftly Broad- 
side with us, and then row’d down ^Irait upon us, ’till they 
came so near, that they could hear us speak : Upon this I 
order’d all my Men to keep close, lea^ they should shoot 
any more Arrows, and made all our Guns ready ; i»ut be- 
ing so near as to be within hearing, I made Friday go out 
upon the Deck, and call out aloud to them in his Lan- 
guage to know what they meant, which accordingly he 
did; whether they understood him or not, that I knew 
not : But as soon as he had call’d to them, sixof them, who 
■\4ere in the foremoSt or nigheSl Boat to us, turns their 
Canoes from us; and Stooping down, skew’d us theirna- 
ked Backsides, juSt as if in English, saving your Presence, 

they had bid us kiss ; whether this was a Defianceor 

Challenge, we know not; or whether it was done in meer 
Contempt, or as a Signal to the reSt ; but immediately Fri- 
day cry’d out they were going to shoot, and unhappily 
for him poor Fellow ; they let fly about 300 of their Ar- 
rows, and, to my inexpressible Grief, kill’d poor Friday, 
no other Man being in their Sight. 

The poor Fellow was shot with no less than three Ar- 
rows, and«about tHree more fell very near him ; such un- 
lucky Marksmen they were. 

I was so enrag’d with the Loss of my old Servant, the 
Companion of all my Sorrows and Solitudes, that I im- 
mediately order’d five Guns to be loaded with small Shot, 
and four with great, and gave them such a Broad-side, as 
they had never heard in their Lives before, to be sure. 

They were not above half a Cable Length off when we 
fir’d; and our Gunners took their Aim so well, that three 
or four of their Canoes were overset, as we had reason to 
believe, by one Shot only. 



74 Farther Adventures ^I^-obinson Crusoe 

The ill Manners of turning up their bare Backsides to 
us, gave us no great Offence ; neither did I know for cer- 
tain, whether that which would pass for the greater Con- 
tempt among us, might be understood so by them, or not ; 
therefore in Return, I had only resolv’d to have fir’d four 
or five puns at them with Powder only, which I knew 
would fright them sufficiently : But when they shot at us 
diredtly with all the Fury they were capable of, and espe- 
cially as they had kill’d my ^^oov Friday, who I so entirely 
lov’d and valu’d, andwhoindeedso well deserv’d it; I not 
only had been juStify’d before Grod and Man, but would 
have been very glad, if I could, to have overset every C^7 
noe there, and drown’d every one of them. 

I can neither tell, how many we kill’d, or how many we 
wounded at this Broad-side ; but sure such a Fright and 
Hurry never was seen among such a Multitude; there 
were 1 3 or 1 4 of their Canoes split and overset in all, and 
the Men all set a swimming ; the reSl frighted out of their 
Wits, scour’d away as faft as they could, taking but little 
Care to save those whose Boats were split or spoil’d with 
our Shot : So I suppose, that they were many of them lo^l : 
And our Men took one poor Fellow swimming for his 
Life, above an Hour after they were all gone. • 

Our small Shot from our Cannon mu^ needs kill and 
wound a great many; but, in short, we never knew any 
Thing how it went with them ; for they fled so fa^t, that in 
three Hours or thereabouts, we could not see above three 
or four draggling Canoes ; nor did we ever see the re^l 
any more ; for a Breeze of Wind springing up the same 
Evening, we weighed and set Sail for the Brasils. 

We had a Prisoner indeed; but the Creature was so 
sullen, that he would neither eat or speak ; and we all fan- 
cy’d he would ftarve himself to Death : But I took a way 



Farther Adventures o/I 1 obinsonCrosoe 75" 

to cure him ; for I made them take him and turn him into 
the Longboat, and make him believe they would toss him 
into the Sea again, and so leavehim where theyfound him, 
if he would not speak ; Nor would that do ; but they really 
did throw him into the Sea, and came away from him; 
and then he follow’d them ; for he swam like a Coifk, and 
call’d to them in his Tongue, tho’ they knew not one 
Word of what he said : However, at laft they took him in 
again, and then he began to be more tradlable ; nor did I 
ever design they should drown him. 

We were now under Sail again ; but I was the mo^ dis- 
consolate Creature alive, for want of my Man Friday^ and 
would have been very glad to have gone back to the Is- 
land, to have taken one of the re^l from thence for my Oc- 
casion, but it could not be; so we went on. We had one 
Prisoner, as I have said ; and ’twas a long while before we 
could make him underhand any thing ; But, in time, our 
Men taught him some English^ and he began to be a little 
tradlable ; afterwards we enquir’d what Country he came 
from, but could make nothing of what he said; for his 
Speech was so odd, all Gutterals, and spoke in the Throat 
in such an hollow odd Manner, that we could never form 
a Word fr©m him ;'and we were all of Opinion, that they 
might speak that Language as well, if they were gagg’d, 
as otherwise : Nor could we perceive that they had any 
Occasion, either for Teeth, Tongue, Lips, or Palat; but 
form’d their Words, ju^l asa hunting Horn forms a Tune 
with an open Throat ; he told us however, some time after, 
when we had taught him to speak a little English, that they 
were going with their Kings to fight a great Battle. When 
he said Kings, we ask’d him how many Kings.? He said, 
they were FIVE NATION, we could not make him 
understand the Plural S. and tW they all join’d to go

again^ ^wo Nation. Weask’dhim, whatmadethem come 
up to us? !He said, to makee te great Wonder look: Where it 
is to be observ’d, That all those Natives, as also those of 
Africa^ when th'ey learn English., they always add two E’s 
at the End of the Words where we use one, and make the 
Accentupon them, as makle takee, and the like ; and we 
could not break them of it ; nay, I could hardly make Fri- 
day leave it off, tho’ at la^t he did. 

And now I name the poor Fellow once more, I mu^f 
take my laft Leave of him ; poor honeftFn<:/<5[y.' We buried 
him with all the Decency and Solemnity possible, by put- 
ting him into a Coffin, and throwing him into the Se? : 
And I caus’d ’em to fire eleven Guns for him ; and so end- 
ed the Life of the mo^ grateful, faithful, hone^, and mo^ 
affectionate Servant that ever Man had. 

We went now away with a fair Wind for Brasil, and in 
about twelve Days Time we made Land in the Latitude 
of five Degrees South ofthe Line, beingtheNorth Ea^er- 
mo^l Land of all that Part of America. Wekepton S. by E. 
in Sight of the Shore four Days, when we made Cape St. 
AuguHine, and in three Days came to an Anchor off of the 
Bay of All Saints, the old Place of my Deliverance, from 
whence came both my good and evil Tate. 

Never Ship came to this Part that had less Business 
than I had; and yet it was with great Difficulty that we 
were admitted to holdthelea^ Correspondence on Shore, 
not my Partner himself, who was alive, and made a great 
Figure among them; not my two Merchants Trustees, 
not the Fame of my wonderful Preservation in that Is- 
land, could obtain me that Favour : But my Partner re- 
membring, that I had given 500 Moidores to the Prior 
of the Monastery of the AuguSiines, and 272 to the Poor, 
went to the MonaCleiy, and oblig’d the Prior that then 



Farther Adventures o/"iloBiNsoNCRtJSOE 77 

was, to go to the Governor, and get Leave for me person- 
ally, with the Captain and one more besides Eight Sea- 
men, to come on Shore, and no more ; and this upon Con- 
dition absolutely capitulated for, that we should not offer 
to land any Goods out of the Ship, or to carry any Person 
away without Licence. . 

They were so ftrift with us, as to landing any Goods, 
that it was with extream Difficulty that I got on Shore 
three Bales of English Goods, such as fine Broad Cloaths, 
Stuffs, and some Linnen, which I had brought for a Pre- 
sent to my Partner. 

^ He was a very generous broad hearted Man, tho’ like 
me, he came from little at fir^t ; and tho’ he knew not that 
I had the lea^t Design of giving him any Thing, he sent 
me on Board a Present of fresh Provisions, Wine, and 
Sweet-meats, worth above 30 Moidores, including some 
Tobacco, and three or four fine Medals in Gold: But I 
was even with him in my Present, which, as I have said, 
consisted of fine broad Cloath, English Stuffs, Lace, and 
fine Hollands : Also I deliver’d him about the Value of 
100 lib. Sterl. in the same Goods for other Uses; and I 
oblig’d him to set up the Sloop which I had brought with 
me from England^ ks I havesaid,.fortheUseof myColony, 
in order to send the Refreshments I intended to my Plan- 
tation. 

Accordingly, he got Hands, and finish’d the Sloop in 
averyfew Days, forshewasalreadyfram’d, and I gavethe 
Ma^er of her such In^ruftions, as he could not miss the 
Place, nor did he miss them, as I had an Account from my 
Partner afterwards. I got him soon loaded with the small 
Cargo I sent them ; and one of our Seamen that had been 
on Shore with me there, offer’d to go with the Sloop, and 
settle there upon my Letter tpthe Governor Spaniard, to- 



7 8 Farther Adventures 0/ Robinson Crusoe 

allot hin^ a sufficient Quantity of Land for a Plantation ; 
and giving him some Cloaths, and Tools for hisPlanting- 
Work, which he said he underwood, having been an old 
Planter at Maryland^ and a Buckaneer into the Bargain. 

I encouraged the Fellow, by granting all he desired; 
and as an Addition, I gave him the Savage, which we had 
taken Prisoner of War, to be his Slave, and order’d the 
Governour Spaniard to give him his Share of every thing 
he wanted, with the reil. 

When we came to fit this Man out, my old Partner told 
me, there was a certain very honest Fellow, a BrasWPXTin- 
ter of his Acquaintance, who had fallen into the Displea- 
sure of the Church ; I know not what the Matter is with 
him, says he\ but on my Conscience, I think he is a Here- 
tick in his Heart, and he has been obliged to conceal him- 
self for fear of the Inquisition ; that he would be very glad 
of such an Opportunity to make his Escape with his Wife 
and two Daughters ; and if I would let them go to my Is- 
land, and allot them a Plantation, he would give them a 
small Stock to begin with ; for the Officers of the Inquisi- 
tion had seiz’d all his Effefts and Eftate, and he had no- 
thing left but a little Houshold-Stuff and two Slaves. 
And, adds be, Tho’ I hate his Principles, yet I would not 
have him fall into their Hands ; for he would assuredly be 
burnt alive, if he does. 

I granted this presently, and join’d my English Man 
with them, and we conceal’d the Man, and his Wife and 
Daughters on Board our Ship, till the Sloop put out to go 
to Sea; and then (having put all their Goods on board the 
Sloop, some time before) we put them on board the Sloop, 
after he was got out of the Bay. 

Our Seaman was mightily pleas’d with this new Part- 
ner ; and their Stock indeed was much alike rich in Tools, 



Farther Adventures o/RobinsonCrusoe 79 

in Preparations, and a Farm, but nothing to begin with, 
but as above : However, they carried over with them, 
which was worth all the re^l, some Materials for planting 
Sugar Canes, with some Plants of Canes ; which he, I 
mean, the Portugal Man, understood very well. 

Among the reSl of the Supplies sent my Tenants in the 
Island, I sent them by their Sloop, three Milch Cows, and 
five Calves, about 22 Hogs among ’em, three Sows big 
with Pig, two Mares, and a Stone-Horse. 

For my Spaniards, according to my Promise, I engag’d 
three Portugal Women to go, and recommended it to 
them to marry them, and use them kindly. I could have 
procured more Women, but I remember’d, that the poor 
persecuted Man had two Daughters, and there was but 
five of the Spaniards that wanted ; the reSl had Wives of 
their own, tho’ in another Country. 

All this Cargo arriv’d safe, and as you may easily sup- 
pose, very welcome to my old Inhabitants, who were now 
with this Addition between sixty and seventy People, be- 
sides little Children ; of which, there was a great many : I 
found Letters at London from them all by the Way of Lis- 
bon, when I came back to England which I shall also 
take someJSfotice immediately. 

I have now done with my Island, and all Manner of 
Discourse about it; and whoever reads the re^l of my 
Memorandums, would do well to turn his Thoughts en- 
tirely from it, and expeft to read of the Follies of an old 
Man, not warn’d by his own Harms, much less by those 
of other Men, to beware of the like ; not cool’d by almo^ 
forty Years Misery and Disappointments, not satisfy ’d 
with Prosperity beyond Expectation, not made cautious 
by Affliction and Distress beyond Imitation. 

I had no more Business to go to the Ea§l Indies, than a 



8o Farther Adventures o/RobinsonCrusoe 
Man at full Liberty, and having committed no Crime, 
has to go to the Turn-key at Newgate, and desire him to 
lock him up among the Prisoners there, and starve him. 
Had I taken a small Vessel from England, and went direft- 
ly to the Island ; had I loaded her, as I did the other Ves- 
sel, with all the Necessaries for the Plantation, and for my 
People, took a Patent from the Government here, to have 
secur’d my Property, in Subjeftion only to that of Eng- 
land-, had I carried over Cannon and Ammunition, Ser- 
vants and People, to plant, and taking Possession of the 
Place, fortified and ^rengthen’d it in the Name of Eng- 
land, and increas’d it with People, as I might easily have 
done; had I then settl’d my self there, and sent the Sfiip 
back, loaden with good Rice, as I might also have done in 
six Months time, and order’d my Friends to have fitted 
her out again for our Supply; had I done this, and ^laid 
there my self, I had, at lealt, afted like a Man of common 
sense; but I was posse^l with a wandring Spirit, scorn’d 
all Advantages, I pleased my self with being the Patron 
of those People I placed there, and doing for them in a 
kind of haughty maje^ick Way, like an old Patriarchal 
Monarch ; providing for them, as if I had been Father of 
the whole Family, as well as of the Plantationr^ut I never 
so much as pretended to plant in the Name of any Go- 
vernment or Nation, or to acknowledge any Prince, or to 
call my People Subjefts to any one Nation more than an- 
other ; nay, I never so much as gave the Place a Name ; but 
left it as I found it, belonging to no Man; and the People 
under no Discipline or Government but my own ; who, 
tho’ I had Influence over them as Father and Benefac- 
tor, had no Authority or Power, to Aft or Command one 
way or other, farther than voluntary Consent mov’d them 
to comply. Yet even this, had I ftay’d there, would have 



Farther Adventures o/RobinsonCrusoe 8i 
done well enough ; but as I rambl’d from them, »nd came 
there no more, the la^ Letters I had from any of them, 
was by my Partners means ; who afterwards sent another 
Sloop to the Place, and who sent me Word, tho’ I had not 
the Letter till five Years after it was written ; that they 
went on but poorly, were Male-content with their long 
Stay there; That Will. Atkins was dead; That five of the 
Spaniards -were come away, and that tho’ they had not 
been much mole^ed by the Savages, yet they had had 
some Skirmishes with them ; and that they begg’d of him 
to write to me, to think of the Promise I had made, to 
fetch them away, that they might see their own Country 
again before they dy’d. 

But I was gone a Wild Goose Chase indeed; and they 
that will have any more of me, mu^l be content to follow 
me thro’ a new Variety of Follies, Hardships, and Wild 
Adventures; wherein the Ju^ice of Providence may be 
duly observed, and we may see how easily Heaven can 
gorge us with our own Desires ; make the ftrongeftof our 
Wishes be our Affliftion, and punish us moft severely 
with those very Things, which we think, it would be our 
utmoft Happiness to be allow’d in. 

Let no wise Man flatter himself, with the Strength of 
his own Judgment, as if he was able to chuse any particu- 
lar Station of Life for himself; Man, is a short-sighted 
Creature, sees but a very little Way before him; and as 
his Passions, are none of his beft Friends, so his particular 
Affeftions, are generally his wor^l Counsellors. 

’ I say this, with Respedl to the impetuous Desire I had 
from a Youth, to wander into the World ;andhow evident 
it now was, that this Principle was preserv’d in me for my 
Punishment; How it came on, the Manner, the Circum- 
stance, and the Conclusion of it, it is easie to give you

Hiftoricjilly, and with its utmo^ Variety of Particulars : 
But the secret Ends of Divine Power, in thus permitting 
us, to be hurry’d down the.Stream of our own Desires, is 
only to be understood of those who can liSten to the Voice 
of Providence, and draw religious Consequences from 
God’sJuSlice, and their own Mistakes. 

Be it, I had Business, or no Business, away I went ; ’tis 
no Time now to enlarge any farther upon the Reason, or 
Absurdity of my own Conduct ; butto come tothe HiStory, 
I was embark’d for the Voyage, and the Voyage I went. 

I should only add here, that my honeSt and truly pious 
Clergyman left me here ; a Ship being ready to go to Lis- 
bon^ he ask’d me leave to go thither, being Still, as he ob- 
serv’d, bound never to finish any Voyage he began : How 
happy had it been for me, if I had gone with him ! 

But it was too late now; all things Heaven appoints 
are beSt ; had I gone with him, I had never had so many 
things to be thankful for, and you had never heard of the 
second Part of the Travels and Adventures of Robin. Cru- 
soe'., so I muSt leave here the fruitless exclaiming at my 
self, and go on with my Voyage. 

From the Brasils., we made directly away over the At- 
lantitk Sea^ to the Cape de bon EsperUnce^ or as we call it, 
the Cape of Good Hope ; and had a tolerable good Voyage, 
our Course generally South-EaSl; now and then a Storm, 
and some contrary Winds, but my DisaSlers at Sea were 
at an end ; my future Rubs and cross Events were to befal 
me on Shore; that it might appear the Land was as well 
prepar’d to be our scourge, as the Sea; when Heaven, 
who direfts the Circumftances of Things, pleases to ap^ 
point it to be so. 

Our Ship was on a Trading Voyage, and had a Supra- 
Cargo on board, who was to direft all her Motions after 



Farther Adventures o/RobinsonCrusoe 83 

she arrived at the Cape\ only being limited tp certain 
Numbers of Days, for Stay, by Charter-party, at the seve- 
ral Ports she was to go to : This was none of my Business, 
neither did I meddle with it at all ; my Nephew, the Cap- 
tain, and the Sufra-Cargo^ adjusting all those things be- 
tween them, as they thought fit. * 

We made no Stay at the Cape longer than was needful, 
to take in fresh Water, but made the beft of our Way for 
the Coaft of Coremandel ; we were indeed inform’d, that a 
French Man of War of fifty Guns, and two large Mer- 
chant Ships, were gone for the Indies^ and as I knew we 
were at War with France^ I had some Apprehensions of 
tKem; but they went their own Way, and we heard no 
more of them. 

I shall not pester my Account, or the Reader, with De- 
scriptions of Places, Journals of our Voyages, Variations 
of Compass, Latitudes, Meridian-Diilances, Trade- 
Winds, Situation of Ports, and the like ; such as almo^ all 
the Hi^ories of long Navigation are full of, and makes 
the reading tiresome enough, and are perfedlly unprofit- 
able to all that read it, except only to those, who are to go 
to those Places themselves. 

It is enough to name the Ports and Places, which we 
touch’d at, and what occurr’d to us upon our passing 
from one to another. We touch’d fir^t at the Island of 
Madagascar^ where, tho’ the People are fierce and trea- 
cherous, and in particular, very well arm’d with Launces, 
and Bows, which they use with inconceivable Dexterity; 
yet we fared very well with them a while, they treated us 
very civilly; and for some Trifles which we gave them, 
such as Knives, Scissars, ^c. they brought us eleven good 
fat Bullocks, middling in Size, but very good in Flesh; 
which we took in, partly for fresh Provisions for our 



84 Farther Adventures 0/ Robinson Crusoe 
present spending, and the reft, to Salt for the Ship’s 
Use. 

We were obliged to ftay here some Time after we had 
furnish’d our selves with Provisions ; and I, that was al- 
ways too curious, to look into every Nook of the World 
where ever I came, was for going on Shore as often as I 
could; it was on the Eaft Side of the Island that we went 
on Shore, one Evening ; and the People, who by the Way 
are very numerous, came thronging about us, and ftood 
gazing at us at a Diftance ; but as we had traded freely 
with them, and had been kindly used, we thought our 
selves in no Danger ; but when we saw the People, we cut 
three Boughs out of a Tree, and ftuck them up at a Dis- 
tance from us, which it seems, is a Mark in the Country, 
not only of Truce and Friendship, butwhen it isaccepted, 
the other Side set up three Poles or Boughs, which is a 
Signal, that they accept the Truce too; but then, this is a 
known Condition of the Truce, that you are not to pass 
beyond their three Poles towards them, nor they to come 
paft your three Poles or Boughs, towards you ; so that you 
are perfeftly secure within the three Poles, and all the 
Space between your Poles and theirs, is allow’d like a 
Market, for free Converse, Traffick, and Commerce: 
When you go there, you muft not carry your Weapons 
with you ; and if they come into that Space they ftick up 
their JavelinesandLaunces,all atthefirft Poles, andcome 
on unarm’d; but if any Violence is offer’d them, and the 
Truce thereby broken ; away they run to the Poles, and 
layholdof their Weapons, and then the Truceisatan End. 

It happen’d one Evening when we went on Shore, that * 
a greater Number of their People came down than usual, 
but all was very friendly and civil, and they brought in 
several Kinds of Provisions, for which we satisfied them. 



Farther Adventures 0/ Robinson Crusoe 85 

•with such Toys as we had ; their Women also bfought us 
Milk, and Roots, and several Things very acceptable to 
us, and all was quiet ; and we made us a little Tent or Hut, 
of some Boughs of Trees, and lay on Shore all Night. 

I know not what was the Occasion, but I was not so 
well satisfied to lye on Shore as the reil, and the Boat ly- 
ing at an Anchor, about a Stone-ca^t from the Land, with 
two Men in her to take Care of her ; I made one of them 
come on Shore, and getting some Boughs of Trees to co- 
ver us also in the Boat, I spread the Sail on the Bottom of 
the Boat, andlayunder the Cover of the Branchesof Trees 
ail Night in the Boat. 

About two a-clock in the Morning, we heard one of 
our Men make a terrible Noise on the Shore, calling out 
for God’s Sake, to bring the Boat in, and come and help 
them, for they were all like to be murther’d ; at the same 
Time I heard the firing of 5 Muskets, which was the 
Number of the Guns they had, and that, three Times 
over; for it seems, the Natives here were not so easily 
frighted with Guns, as the Savages were in where 

I had to do with them. 

All this while, Lknew not what was the Matter; but 
rouzing inimediately from Sleep with the Noise, I caus’d 
the Boat to be thrull in, and resolv’d, with three Fusils 
we had on board, to land, and assift our Men. 

We got the Boat soon to the Shore, but our Men were 
in too much Ha^e : For being come to the Shore, they 
plunged into the Water to get to the Boat with all the Ex- 
pedition they could, being pursued by between three and 
tour hundred Men : Our Men were but nine in all, and 
only five of them had Fusils with them ; the re^ had indeed 
Piftols and Swords, but they were of small use to them. 

We took up seven of our Men, and with Difficulty 



8 6 Farther Adventures e/ R obinson Crusoe 

enough too, three of them being very ill wounded; and 
that which was ft ill worse, was, that while we ftood in the 
Boat to take our Men in, we were in as much Danger as 
they were in on Shore; for they pour’d their Arrows in 
upon us so thick, that we were fain to barricade the Side 
of the Boat up with the Benches, and two or three loose 
Boards, which to our great Satisfaftion we had by mere 
Accident or Providence in the Boat. 

And yet, had it been Day-light, they are it seems such 
exaft Marks-men, that if they could have seen but the 
leaft Part of any of us, they would have been sure of us ; 
we had by the Light of the Moon a little Sight of them,«r.s 
they ftood pelting us from the Shore with Darts and Ar- 
rows ; and having got ready our Fire-Arms, we gave them 
a Volley, that we could hear by the Cries of some of them, 
that we had wounded several ; however, they ftood thus 
in Battle Array on the Shore till break of Day, which we 
suppose was, that they might see the better to take their 
Aim at us. 

In this Condition we lay, and could not tell how to 
weigh our Anchor, or set up our Sail, because we muft 
needs ftand up in the Boat, and they tyere as sure to hit us, 
as we wert to hit a Bird in a Tree with small Shot; we 
made Signals of Diftress to the Ship, which, tho’ we rode 
a League off, yet my Nephew the Captain hearing our 
firing, and by Glasses, perceiving the Pofture we lay in, 
and that we fir’d towards the Shore, pretty well underftood 
us ; and weighing Anchor, with all Speed, he ftood as near 
the Shore as he durft with the Ship, and then sent another^ 
Boat with ten Hands in her to assift us ; but we call’d to 
them not to come too near, telling them what Condition 
we were in : However, they ftood in nearer to us ; and one 
of the Men taking the End of a Tow-Line in his Hand^ 



Farther Adventures c/RobinsonCrusoe 87 

and keeping our Boat between him and the Enemy, so 
that they could not perfeftly see him, swam on board us, 
and made faft the Line to the Boat ; upon which weslipp’d 
our little Cable, and leaving our Anchor behind, they 
tow’d us out of Reach of the Arrows, we all the while ly- 
ing close behind the Barricado we had made. • 

As soon as we were got from between the Ship and the 
Shore, that she could lay her Side to the Shore, she run 
along ju^l by them, and we pour’d in a Broad-side among 
them loaden with Pieces of Iron and Lead, small Bullets, 
and such ^tufF, besides the great Shot, which made a terri- 
ble Havock amongst them. 

When we were got on board and out of Danger, we 
had Time to examine into the Occasion of this Fray; and 
indeed our Supra-Cargo who had been often in those Parts, 
put me upon it; for he said, he was sure the Inhabitants 
would not have touch’d us after we had made a Truce, if 
we had not done something to provoke them to it. At 
length it came out, {viz.) that an old Woman who had 
come to sell us some Milk, had brought it within our 
Poles with a young Woman, with her, who also brought 
some Roots or Hpbs; and while the old Woman, whe- 
ther she was Mother to the young Woman or no, they 
could not tell, was selling us the Milk, one of our Men 
offer’d some Rudeness to the Wench that was with her, 
at which the old Woman made a great Noise : However, 
the Seaman would not quit his Prize, but carried her out 
of the old Woman’s Sight among the Trees, it being al- 
moft dark; the old Woman went away without her, and 
as we suppose, made an Out-cry among the People she 
came from ; who upon Notice, rais’d this great Army up- 
on us in three or four Hours ; and it was great odds, but 
we had been all deftroy’d. 



88 Farther Adventures ^Robinson Crusoe 

One o^our Men was killed with a Launce thrown at 
him juft at the beginning of the Attack, as he sally ’d out 
of the Tent they had made; the reft came oiF free, all but

paid dear enough for his black Miftress ; for we could not 
hear what became of him, a great while; we lay upon the 
Shore two Days after, tho’ the Wind presented, and made 
Signals for him; made our Boat sail up Shore and down 
Shore, several Leagues, but in vain ; so we were oblig’d to 
give him over, and if he alone had suffer’d for it, the Loss 
had been the less. 

I could not satisfie my self, however, without ventuiii^, 
ing on Shore once more, to try if I could learn any Thing 
of him or them ; it was the third Night after the Aftion, 
that I had a great Mind to learn if I could by any Means 
what Mischief we had done, and how the Game ftood on 
the Indians Side : I was careful to do it in the Dark, left we 
should be attack’d again ; but I ought indeed to have been 
sure, that the Men I went with had been under my Com- 
mand, before I engag’d in a Thing so hazardous and mis- 
chievous as I was brought into by it, without my Know- 
ledge or Design. 

We took twenty ftout Fellows with us as any in the 
Ship, besides the Supra-Cargo and my self, and we landed 
two Hours before Midnight, at the same Place where the 
Indians ftood drawn up the Evening before ; I landedhere, 
because my Design as I have said, was chiefly to see if 
they had quitted the Field, and if they had left any Marks 
behind them of the Mischief we had done them; and I 
thought, if we could surprize one or two of them, perhaps 
we might get our Man again by Way of Exchange. 

We landed without any Noise, and divided our Men 
intotwo Bodies, whereof, the Boatswain commanded one, 



Farther Adventures o/RobinsonCrusoe 89 
and I the other; we neither saw or heard any ^ody ^lir 
when we landed, and we march’d up one Body at a Dis- 
tance from the other, to the Place, but at fir^ could see 
nothing it being very dark; till by and by, our Boatswain 
that led the firll Party, tumbled and fell over a dead 
Boy; this made them halt a while, for knowing by the 
Circumftances that they were at the Place, where the In- 
dians had ^lood, they waited for my coming up here; we 
concluded to halt till the Moon began to rise, which we 
knew would be in less than an Hour, when we could easily 
discern the Havock we had made among them ; we told 
tyo and thirty Bodies upon the Ground, whereof two 
were not quite dead : Some had an Arm, and some a Leg 
shot off, and one his Head ; those that were wounded we 
suppos’d, they had carried away. 

When we had made, as I thought, a full Discovery of 
all we could come at the Knowledge of, I was resolv’d for 
going on board ; but the Boatswain and his Party sent me 
Word, that they were resolv’d to make a Visit to the In- 
dian Town, where these Dogs, as they call’d them, dwelt, 
and ask’d me to go along with them; and if they could 
find them, as ftill they fansied they should, they did not 
doubt getting a good Booty, and it might be, they might 
find Tho. Jeffry there, that was the Man's Name we had 
loU. 

Had they sent to ask my Leave to go, I knew well 
enough what Answer to have given them; for I would 
have commanded them inftantly on Board, knowing it 
was not a Hazard fit for us to run, who had a Ship, and 
Ship-loading in our Charge, and a Voyage to make, which 
depended very much upon the Lives of the Men ; but as 
they sent me Word they were resolved to go, and onlj^"* 
ask’d me and my Company to go along with them ; I posi- 



90 Farther Adventures 0/ Robinson Crusoe 

tively refus’d it, and rose \x^,for I was sittingon the Ground 
in Order to go to the Boat ; one or two of the Men began 
to importune me to go, and when I refus’d positively, be- 
gan to grumble, and say they were not under my Com- 
mand, and they would go : Come Jack, says one of the 
Men,^will go with me? I’ll go for one, Jack said he 
would, and another followed, and then another; and in a 
Word, they all left me but one, who I persuaded to ^ay, 
and a Boy left in the Boat ; so the Supra-Cargo and I, with 
the third Man, went backto the Boat, where we told them 
we would ftay for them, and take Care to take in as many 
of them as should be left; for I told them it was a mqd 
Thingthey weregoing about, and supposed mo^l of them 
would run the Fate of Ahom. Jeffry. 

They told me, like Seamen, they’d warrant it they 
would come off again, and they would take care, iAc. So 
away they went ; I entreated ’em to consider the Ship and 
Voyage; that their Lives were not their own, and that 
they were entrusted with the Voyage in some Measure, 
that if they miscarry’d, the Ship might be lo^ for want of 
their Help, and that they could not answer it to God or 
Man. I said a great deal more to ’em on that Head, but I 
might as well have talk’d to the Maih-Ma^I of the Ship,% 
they were mad upon their Journey, only they gave me 
good Words, and begg’d I would not be angry; That 
they would be very cautious, and they did not doubt but 
they would be back again in about an Hour at farther ; 
for the Indian Town, they said, was not above half a Mile 
off, tho’ they found it above two Miles before they got 
to it. * 

Well, they all went away, as above; and tho’ the At- 
tempt was desperate, and such, as none but mad Men 
would have gone about, yet to give ’em their due, they 



Farther Adventures of ^ OBiNsoNCRttsoE 91 

went about it warily as boldly : They were gallantly arm- 
ed, that’s true ; for they had every Man a Fuzee or Mus- 
ket, a Bayonet, every Man a Piilol ; some of them had 
broad Cutlasses, some of them Hangers, and the Boat- 
swain and Two more, had Pole-Axes : Besides all which, 
they had among them thirteen Hand-Grenadoes. bolder 
Fellows, and better provided, never went about any wick- 
ed Work in the World. 

When they went out, their chief Design was Plunder, 
and they were in mighty hopes of finding Gold there; but 
a Circum^ance which none of them were aware of, set 
them on fire with Revenge, and made Devils of them all. 
When they came to the few Indian Houses which they 
thought had been the Town, which was not above half a 
Mile off; they were under a great Disappointment; for 
there were not above 1 2 or 13 Houses ; and where the 
Town was, or how big, they knew not : They consulted 
therefore what to do, and were some time before they 
could resolve : for if they fell upon these, they mu^l cut all 
their Throats, and it was ten to one but some of them 
might escape, it being in the Night, tho’ the Moon was 
up ; and if one escilped, he would run away, and raise all 
the Town, so they should have a whole Army upon them : 
Again, on the other hand, if they went away, and left 
those untouch’d (for thePeoplcwereallasleep)they could 
not tell which Way to look for the Town. 

However, the la^lwasthe be^t Advice ; so they resolv’d 
to leave them,and look for the Town as well as they could. 
They went on a little Way, and found a Cow tied to a 
Tree; this they presently concluded, would be a good 
Guide to them ; for they said, the Cow certainly belonged 
to the Town before them, or the Town behind them ; and 
if they untied her, they should see which way she went ; if 



92 Farther Adventures of V<o hi 'US, o Mi Crusoe 

she went back, they had nothing to say to her ; but if she 
went forward, they had nothing to do but to follow her: 
So they cut the Cord, which was made of twilled Flags, 
and the Cow went on before them ; in a Word, the Cow 
led them diredlly to the Town, which as they report, con- 
siftedof above 200 Houses, or Huts ; and in some of these, 
they found several Families living together. 

Here they found all in Silence, as profoundly secure, as 
Sleep, and a Country that had never seen an Enemy of 
that Kind could make them ; and fir^, they call’d another 
Council, to consider what they had to do ; and in a Word, 
they resolv’d to divide themselves into three Bodies, and 
to set three Houses on Fire in three Parts of the Town; 
and as the Men came out, to seize them and bind them ; if 
any resisted, they need not be ask’d what to do then, and 
so to search the re^ of the Houses for Plunder ; but they 
resolv’d to march silently fir^t, thro’ the Town, and see 
what Dimensions it was of, and if they might venture up- 
on it or no. 

They did so, and desperately resolv’d that they would 
venture upon them ; but while they were animating one 
another to the Work, three of them tljat were a little be- 
fore the re^l, call’d out aloud to them, and told them they 
had found ‘Thom. Jeffry \ they all run up to the Place, and 
so it was indeed ; for there they found the poor Fellow 
hang’d up naked by one Arm, and his Throat cut; there 
was an Indian House ju^ by the Tree, where they found 
sixteen or seventeenof theprincipal IndiansvfhohsiA. been 
concern’d in the Fray with us before ; and two or three of 
them wounded with our Shot ; and our Men found they 
were awake, and talking one to another in that House, 
but knew not their Number. 

The Sight of their poor mangled Comrade so enrag’d 



Farther Adventuresof^ohia^o'n Crusoe 9j 

’em, as before, that they swore to one another they would 
be reveng’d, and that not an Indian who came ifito their 
Hands should have Quarter, and to Work they went im- 
mediately ; and yet not so madly as by the Rage and Fury 
they were in might be expefted. Their fir^ Care was to 
get something that would soon take Fire ; but after a little 
search, they found that would be to no purpose ; but mo^ 
of the Houses were low, and thatch ’d with Flags or Rushes, 
of which the Country is full ; so they presently made some 
wild Fire, as we call it, by wetting a little Powder in the 
Palms of their hands, and in a quarter of an Hour they 
set the Town on Fire in four or five Places ; and particu- 
l^tly that House where the Indians were not gone to Bed. 
As soon as the Fire beganto blaze, the poor frighted Crea- 
tures began to rush out to save their Lives ; but met with 
their Fate in the Attempt, and especially at the Door, 
where they drove ’em back, the Boatswain himself killing 
one or two with his Pole-Ax ; The House being large, and 
many in it, he did not care to go in, but call’d for a Hand- 
Grenado, and threw it among ’em, which at firft frighted 
’em ; but when it bur^l, made such Havock among ’em, 
that they cried out in a hideous manner. 

In short, mo^ «f the Indians who were in the open 
Part of the House, were killed or hurt with the Grenado, 
except two or three more who press’d to the Door, which 
the Boatswain and two more kept with their Bayonets in 
the Muzzles of their Pieces, and dispatch’d all who came 
that W ay. But there was another Apartment in theHouse 
where the Prince or King, or whatever he was, and several 
others were, and these they kept in till the House, which 
was by this time all of a light Flame, fell in upon them, 
and they were smother’d or burnt together. 

All this while they fir’d not a Gun, because they would 



•94 Farther Adventures e/ R obinson Crusoe 

not waken the People fafter than they could mailer them ; 
but the Fire began to waken them fail enough, and our 
Fellows were glad to keep a little together in Bodies ; for 
the Fire grew so raging, all the Houses being made of 
light conbuilible Stuff, that they could hardly bear the 
Street between them, and their Business was to follow the 
Fire for the surer Execution : As fail as the Fire either 
forc’d the People out of those Houses which were burn- , 
ing, or frighted them out of others, our People were ready 
at their Doors to knock them on the Head, ilill calling 
and hallowing to one another to remember ‘Thom, Jejffrys, 

While this was doing, I muil confess I was very un- 
easie, and especially when I saw the Flames of the Towif, 
which, it being Night, seem’d to be juit by me. 

My Nephew, the Captain, who was rouz’d by his Men 
too, seeing such a Fire, was very uneasie, not knowing 
what the Matter was, or what Danger I was in ; especially 
hearing the Guns too; for by this time they began to use 
their Fire-Arms ; a thousand Thoughts oppre^l his Mind 
concerning me and the Supra-Cargo, what should become 
of us : And at la^l, tho’ he could ill spare any more Men, 
yet not knowing what Exigence we might be in, he takes 
another Boat, and with 1 3 Men and Eimself, comes on 
Shore to me. 

He was surpriz’d to see me and the Supra-Cargo in the 
Boat with no more than two Men ; and tho’ he was glad 
that we were well, yet he was in the same Impatience with 
us to know what was doing ; for the Noise continu’d, and 
the Flame encreas’d : In short, it was next to an Impossi- 
bility for any Men in the World, to re^lrain their Curiosi- 1 
ty, to know what had happen’d, or the Concern for the 
Safety of the Men : In a word, the Captain told me, he 
would go and help his Men, let what would come. I ar- 



Farther Adventures 0/ R o B i n s o n C R U s o e 95 

gu’d with him as I did before with the Men, the Safety of 
the Ship, the Danger of the Voyage, the Interell of the 
Owners and Merchants, ^c. and told him, I would go 
and the two Men, and only see if we could at a Di^ance 
learn what was like to be the Event, and come back and 
tell him. 

It was all one, to talk to my Nephew, as it was to talk to 
the re^l before; he would go he said, and he only wish’d 
he had left but Ten Men in the Ship ; for i[e could not 
think of having his Men lo^ for want of Help, he had ra- 
ther lose the Ship, the Voyage, and his Life and all; and 
away he went. 

* In a Word, I was no more able to ftay behind now, than 
I was to persuade them not to go ; so in short, the Captain 
order’d two Men to row back the Pinnace, and fetch 
twelve Men more, leaving the Long Boat at an Anchor, 
and that when they came back, six Men should keep the 
two Boats, and six more come after us ; so that he left only 
1 6 Men in the Ship ; for the whole Ship’s Company con- 
sisted of 65 Men, whereof two were loSl in the laSl Quar- 
rel, which brought this Mischief on. 

Being now on the March, you may be sure we felt little 
of the Ground we trode on ; and being guided by the Fire, 
we kept no Path, but went direftly to the Place of the 
Flame : If the Noise of the Guns was surprizing to us be- 
fore, the Cries of the poor People were now of quite an- 
other nature, and fill’d us with Horror. I muSI confess, I 
never was at the sacking a City, or at the taking a Town 
by Storm. I had heard of Oliver Cromwell t'sl&i.ngDrogheda 
in Ireland^ and killing Man, Woman and Child : And I 
had read of Count ’Tilly, sacking of the City of Magde- 
burgh, and cutting the Throats of 22000 of all Sexes: 
But I never had an Idea of the Thing itself before, nor is 



96 Farther Adventures 0/ Robinson Crusoe 
it possible to describe it, or the Horror which was upon 
our Minds at hearing it. 

However, we went on, and at length cametotheTown, 
tho’ there was no entring the Streets of it for the Fire.The 
fir^l Objeft we metwith, wasthe Ruinsof a Hut or House, 
or rather the Ashes of it, for the House was consum’d; 
and ju^f before it, plain now to be seen by the Light of the 
Fire, lay four Men and three Women kill’d; and as we 
thought, ont or two more lay in the Heap among the Fire. 
In short there were such Instances of a Rage altogether 
barbarous, and of a Fury, something beyond what was 
human, that we thought it impossible our Men could be 
guilty of it, or if they were the Authors of it, we thought 
they ought to be every one of ’em put to the wor^l of 
Deaths. But this was not all, we saw the Fire encreas’d 
forward, and the Cry went on ju^t as the Fire went on ; so 
that we were in the utmo^ Confusion. We advanc’d a lit- 
tle Way farther, and behold, to our Aftonishment, three 
Women naked, and crying a mo^t dreadful Manner, 
come flying, as if they had indeed had Wings, and after 
them sixteen or seventeen Men, Natives, in the same 
Terror and Con^ernation, with three of our English But- 
chers, for I can call them no better, hi their Real , who, 
when they could not overtake them, fir’d in among them, 
and one that was kill’d by their Shot fell down in our 
Sight ; when the re^t saw us, believing us to be their Ene- 
mies, and that we would murther them as well as those 
that persued them, they set up a mo^l dreadful Shriek, 
especially the Women ; and two of them fell down as if 
already dead with the Fright. ♦ 

My very Soul shrunk within me, and my Blood run 
chill in my Veins, when I saw this ; and I believe, had the 
three English Sailors that pursu’d them come on, I had 



^ Farther Adventures ^Robinson Crusoe 97 
made our Men kill them all: However we topk some 
Ways to let the poor flying Creatures know, that we 
would not hurt them, and immediately they came up to 
us, and kneeling down, with their Hands lifted up, made 
piteous Lamentation to us to save them, which we let 
them know we would; whereupon they crept altogether 
in a Huddle close behind us, as for Proteftion, I left my 
Men drawn up together, and charg’d them to hurt no 
Body, but if possible to get at some of our People, and see 
what Devil it was possess’d them,andwhat they intended 
to do; and in a word, to command them off; assuring 
them, that if they ^ay’d till Day-light, they would have 
an hundred thousand Men about their Ears : I say, I left 
them, and went among those flying People, taking only 
two of our Men with me ; and there was indeed a piteous 
Speftacle among them; Some of them had their Feet 
terribly burnt with trampling and running thro’ the Fire, 
others their Hands burnt; one of the Women had fallen 
down in the Fire, and was very much burnt before she 
could get out again, and two or three of the Men had 
Cuts in their Backs and Thighs from our Men pursuing ; 
and another was shot thro’ the Body, and died while I 
was there, 

I would fain have learned what the Occasion of all this 
was, but I could not understand one Word they said ; tho’ 
by Signs I perceived that some of them knew not what 
was the Occasion themselves. I was so terrified in my 
Thoughts at this outragious Attempt, that I could not 
Stay there; but went back to my own Men, and resolved 
to go into the Middle of theTown thro’ the Fire, or what- 
ever might be in the W ay, and put an End to it, coSl what 
it would : Accordingly, as soon as I came back to my Men, 
I told them my Resolution, and commanded them to fol-

low me, when in the very Moment came four of our Men, 
with the Boatswain at their Head, roving over the Heaps 
of Bodies they had killed, all cover’d with Blood and 
Duft, as if they wanted more People to massacre, when 
our Men hallow’d to them as loud as they could hallow, 
and with much ado one of them made them hear ; so that 
they knew who we were, and came up to us. 

As soon as the Boatswain saw us, he set up a Hallow 
like a Shout of Triumph, for having, as he thought, more 
Help come, and without bearing to hear me. Captain, 
says he, noble Captain, I am glad you are come; we have 
not half done yet, villainous Hell-hound Dogs, I’ll kill as 
many of them as poor 'Fom. has Hairs upon his Head, ^^^e 
have sworn to spare none of them, we’ll root out the very 
Nation of ’em from the Earth, and thus he run on, out of 
Breath too with Action, and would not give us leave to 
speak a Word. 

At la^l, raising my Voice, that I might silence him a 
little. Barbarous Dog, said I, what are you doing.? I won’t 
have one Creature touch’d more, upon pain of Death. I 
charge you upon your Life, to ^lop your Hands, and 
^and ^lill here, or you are a dead Man this Minute. 

Why, Sir, says he. Do you know what you do, or what 
they have done? If you want a Reason for what we have 
done, come hither ; and with that he shew’d me the poor 
Fellow hanging with his Throat cut. 

I confess, I was urged then myself, and at another 
Time should have been forward enough; but I thought 
they had carried their Rage too far, and thought of Jacob’s 
Words to his Sons Simeon and Levi ; Cursed be their AnfeVy 
for it was fierce ; and their Wrathyforitwas cruel: But I had 
now a new Task upon my hands ; for when the Men I car- 



Farther Adventures o/Robinson Crusoe 99 
ried with me saw the Sight as I had done, I had»as much 
to do to retrain them, as I should have had with the other ; 
nay, my Nephew himself fell in with them, and told me in 
their hearing, that he was only concerned for fear of the 
Men being overpower’d ; for as to the People, he thought 
not one of ’em ought to 1 ive ; for they had all glutted them- 
selves with the Murther of the poor Man, and that they 
ought to be used like Murtherers. Upon these Words, 
away run eight of my Men with the Boatswain and his 
Crew, to compleat their bloody Work; and I seeing it 
quite out of my Power to restrain them, came away pen- 
^ve and sad ; for I could not bear the Sight, much less the 
horrible Noise and Cries of the poor Wretches that fell 
into their Hands. 

I got no Body to come back with me but the Supra- 
Cargo and two Men ; and with these I walk’d back to the 
Boats. It was a very great Piece of Folly in me, I confess, 
to venture back, as it were alone ; for as it began now to be 
almost Day, and the Alarm had run over the Country, 
there ^ood about 40 Men arm’d with Launces and Bows 
at the little Place where the 1 2 or 1 3 Houses ^ood men- 
tion’d before; but^by Accident I miss’d the Place, and 
came direftly to the Sea-side, and by the Time I got to 
the Sea-side it was broad Day; immediately I took the 
Pinnace, and went aboard, and sent her back to assi^ the 
Men in what might happen. 

I observ’d about the Xini® that I came to the Boat-side, 
that the Fire was pretty well out, and the Noise abated; 
but in about half an Hour after I got on Board, I heard a 
Volley of our Mens Fire-Arms, and saw a great Smoak; 
this, as I underwood afterwards, was our Men falling up- 
on the Men, who as I said ftood at the few Houses on the 



I oo Farther Adventures 0/ Robinson Crusoe 
Way, ofwhom they kill’d sixteen or seventeen, and set all 
those Houses on Fire, but did not meddle wiA the Wo- 
men or Children. 

By that Time the Men got to the Shore again with the 
Pinnace, our Men began to appear; they came dropping 
in, sortie and some, not in two Bodies, and in Form as they 
went, but all in Heaps, draggling hereandthere, in sucha 
Manner, tha^t a small Force of resolute Men might have 
cut them all off. 

But the Dread of them was upon the whole Country; 
and the Men were amaz’d, andsurpriz’d, and so frighted, 
that I believe a hundred of ’em would have fled at the 
Sight of but five of our Men. Nor in all this terrible Ac- 
tion was there a Man who made any considerable De- 
fence, they were so surpriz’d between the Terror of the 
Fire, and the sudden Attack of our Men in the Dark, that 
they knew not which Way to turn themselves ; for if they 
fled one Way, they were met by one Party ; if back again, 
by another : So that they were everywhere knock’d down : 
Nor did any of our Men receive the lea^ Hurt; except 
one who strain’d his Foot, and another had one of his 
Hands very much burnt. ''?i 

I was very angry with my Nephew the Captain, and iii^ 
deed with all the Men in my Mind, but with him in par- 
ticular; as well for his adling so out of his Duty as Com- 
mander of the Ship, and having the Charge of the Voyage 
upon him, as in his prompting rather than cooling the 
Rage of his Men in so bloody and cruel an Enterprize. 
My Nephew answer’d me very respedtfully ; but told me, 
that when he saw the Body of the poor Seaman whom <hey 
had murther’d in such a cruel and barbarous manner, he 
was not Mailer of himself, neither could he govern his 
Passion. He own’d, he should not have done so, as he was 



Farther Adventures o/RobinsonCrusoe ioi 
Commander of the Ship; but as he was a Man,<and Na- 
ture mov’d him, he could not bear it. As for the re^l of the 
Men, they were not subjeft to me at all, and they knew it 
well enough ; so they took no notice of my Dislike. 

The next Day we set sail, so we never heard any more 
of it: Our Men differ’d in the Account of the Number 
they kill’d : Some said one Thing, some another; but ac- 
cording to the beft of their Accounts put altogether, they 
kill’d or destroy’d about 1 50 People, Men, Women, and 
Children, and left not a House ^landing in the Town. 

As for the poor Fellow Fho. Jeffrys^ as he was quite 
4 (sad, for his Throat was so cut, that his Head was half 
off, it would do him no Service to bring him away, so they 
left him where they found him, only took him down from 
the Tree where he was bang’d by one Hand. 

However juif our Men thought this Adfion, I was 
again^ them in it ; and I always, after that Time, told 
them, God would bla^l the Voyage ; for I look’d upon all 
the Blood they shed that Night to be Murther in them: 
Fortho’ it is true, that they had kill’d Fho. Jeffrys, yet it 
, was as true, that Jeffrys was the Aggressor, had broken 
'‘^he Truce, and had violated or debauch’d a young Wo- 
ihan of theirs who came down to them innocently, and on 
the Faith of their publick Capitulation. 

The Boatswain defended this Quarrel when we were 
afterwards on board : He said, It is true that we seem’d 
to break the Truce, but feally had not, and that the War 
was begun the Night before by the Natives themselves, 
who had shot at us, and kill’d one of our Men without any 
•ju^l Provocation ; so that as we were in a Capacity to fight 
them now, we might also be in a Capacity to do our selves 
Juifice upon them in an extraordinary Manner, that tho’ 
the poor Man had taken a little Liberty with a Wench, he 



1 02 Farther Adventures o/RobinsonCrusoe 

ought not to have been murther’d, and that in such a vil- 
lanous Manner : and that they did nothing but what was 
ju^l, and what the Laws of God allow’d to be done to 
Murtherers. 

One would think this should have been enough to have 
warn’d us againft going on Shore among Heathens and 
Barbarians : But it is impossible to make Mankind wise, 
but at their own Expence and their Experience seems 
to be always 'of mo^ Use to them, when it is dearest 
bought. 

We were now bound to the Gulph of Persia, and from 
thence to the Coa^ of Coremandel, only to touch at Sur- 
rat: But the chief of the Supra-Cargo’s Design lay at the 
Bay of Bengale, where if he miss’d of his Business out- 
ward bound, he was to go up to China, and return to the 
Coa^t as he came Home. 

The fir^t Disaster that befel us, was in the Gulph of 
Persia, where five of our Men venturing on Shore on the 
Arabian Side of the Gulph, were surrounded by the Ara- 
bians, and either all kill’d or carry’d away into Slavery; 
the re^ of the Boat’s Crew were not able to rescue them, 
and had but ju^ Time to get oflF their Boat. I began to up- 
braid them with the ju^t Retribution*of Heaven in this 
Case : But the Boatswain very warmly told me, he thought 
I went farther in my Censures than I could shew any War- 
rant for in Scripture, and referr’d to the 1 3 St Luke, Verse 
4th. where our Saviour intimates, that those Men, on 
whom the Tower of Siloam fell, were not Sinners above 
all the Galileans: But that which indeed put me to Silence 
in the Case, was. That not one of these five Men, whd 
were now loif, were of the Number of those who went on 
Shore to the Massacre of Madagascar-, {so I always calPd 
it, tho' our Men could not bear the fV ord Massacre with any 



Farther Adventures o/RobinsonCrusoe 103 

Patience:) And indeed, this la^ Circum^ance, I have 
said, put me to Silence for the present. 

But my frequent preaching to them on this Subjeft 
had worse Consequences than I expefted; and the Boat- 
swain, who had been the Head of the Attempt, came up 
boldly to me one Time, and told me, he found, that I con- 
tinually brought that Affair upon the Stage, that I made 
unjust Reflexions upon it, and had used the Men very ill 
on that Account, and himself in particular^, that as I was 
but a Passenger, and had no Command in the Ship, or 
Concern in the Voyage, they were not oblig’d to bear it; 
that they did not know, but I might have some ill Design 
m my Head, and perhaps to call them to Account for it, 
when they came to England ; and that therefore, unless I 
would resolve to have done with it ; and also, not to con- 
cern my self any farther with him, or any of his Affairs, he 
would leave the Ship ; for he did not think it was safe to 
sail with me among them. 

I heard him patiently enough ’till he had done, and 
then told him, that I did confess I had all along oppos’d 
the Massacre of Madagascar^ for such I would always call 
it ; and that I had on all Occasions spoken my Mind free- 
ly about it, tho’ n<Jt more upon him than any of the reX : 
That as to my having no Command in the Ship, that was 
true ; nor did I exercise any Authority, only took my Li- 
berty of speaking my Mind in Things which publickly 
concern’d us all; and what Concern I had in the Voyage 
was none of his Business ;that I was a considerable Owner 
of the Ship ; and in that Claim I conceived I had a Right 
to speak even farther than I had yet done, and would not 
be accountable to him or any one else, and begun to be a 
little warm with him : He made but little Reply to me at 
that Time, and I thought that Affair had been over. We 



104 Farther Adventures of 'Ko hi V so ifi Crusoe 

were at this Time in the Roadat Bengale, and beingwilling 
to see the Place, I went on Shore with the Supra-Cargo in 
the Ship’s Boat, to divert myself, and towards Evening 
was preparing to go on Board, when one of the Men came 
to me, and told me, he would not have me trouble my self 
to come down to the Boat, for they had Orders not to car- 
ry me on Board any more. Any one may guess what a Sur- 
prize I was in at so insolent a Message ; and I ask’d the 
Man, who bad him deliver that Errand to me? He told 
me, the Cockswain. I said no more to the Fellow, but bad 
him let them know he had deliver’d his Message, and 
that I had given him no Answer to it. ^ 

I immediately went and found out the Supra-Cargo, 
and told him the Story, adding what I presently foresaw, 
(viz.) That there would certainly be a Mutiny in the Ship, 
and entreated him to go immediately on Board the Ship 
in an Indian Boat, and acquaint the Captain of it: But I 
might ha’ spar’d this Intelligence ; for before I had spoken 
to him on Shore, the Matter was effefted on Board. The 
Boatswain, the Gunner, the Carpenter; and in a Word, 
all the Inferiour Officers, as soon as I was gone off in the 
Boat, came up to the Quarter-Deck, and desir’d to speak 
with the Captain, and there the Boatswain making a long 
Harangue for the Fellow talk’d very well, and repeating 
all he had said to me, told the Captain in few Words, That 
as I was now gone peaceably on Shore, they were loth to 
use any Violence with me ; which, if I had not gone on 
Shore, they would otherwise have done, to oblige me to 
have gone : They therefore thought fit to tell him, That as 
they shipp’d themselves to serve in the Ship under his* 
Command, they would perform it well and faithfully: 
But if I would not quit the Ship, or the Captain oblige 
me to quit it, they would all leave the Ship, and sail no 



Farther Adventures 0/ Robinson Crusoe 105 

farther with him ; and at that Word, A L L , he tyrn’d his 
Face about towards the Main-maft, which was it seems 
the Signal agreed on between them ; at which, all the Sea- 
men being got together, they cry’d out, One and ALL, 
One and ALL. 

My Nephew, the Captain, was a Man of Spirit,.and of 
great Presence of Mind ; and tho’ he was surpriz’d, you 
may be sure, at the Thing, yet he told them calmly, that 
he would consider of the Thing, but that hfe could do no- 
thing in it ’till he had spoken tome about it. He us’d some 
Arguments "^ith them, to shew them the Unreasonable- 
gess and Injuftice of the Thing : But it was all in vain, they 
swore and shook Hands round before his Face, that they 
would go all on Shore, unless he would engage to them, 
not to suffer me to come any more on Board the Ship. 

This was a hard Article upon him, who knew his Obli- 
gation to me, and did not know how I might take it ; so he 
began to talk cavalierly to them, told them that I was a 
very considerable Owner of the Ship, and that in Ju^lice 
he could not put me out of my own House ; that this was 
next Door to serving me, as the famous Pirate Kid had 
done, who made the Mutiny in a Ship, set the Captain on 
Shore in an uninhabited Island, and run away with the 
Ship ; that let them go into what Ship they would, if ever 
they came to England again, it would coft them dear ; that 
the Ship was mine, and that he could not put me out of it ; 
and that he would rather lose the Shipandthe Voyage too, 
than disoblige me so much ; so they might do as they 
pleas’d: However, he would go on Shore, and talk with 
me on Shore, and invited the Boatswain to go with me 
[him] and perhaps they might accommodate the Matter 
with me. 

But they all rejefted the Proposal, and said, they would 



io6 Farther Adventure^-of^ obinsonCrusoe 

have nothing to do with me any more, neither on Board, 
or on Shore ; and if I came on Board, they would all go on 
Shore. Well, said the Captain, if you are all of this Mind, 
let me go on Shore and talk with him ; so away he came to 
me with this Account, a little after the Message had been 
brought to me from the Cockswain. 

I was very glad to see my Nephew, I mu^l confess ; for 
I was not without Apprehensions, that they would con- 
fine him by Violence, set sail, and run away with the Ship, 
and then I had been Gripp’d naked in a remote Country, 
andnothingto help myself : In short, I had been in a worse 
Case, than when I was all alone in the Island. 

But they had not come that length, it seems, to my 
great satisfaftion ; and when my Nephew told me what 
they had said to him, and how they had sworn, and shook 
Hands, that they would one and all\c2.vc the Ship, if I was 
suffer’d to come on Board, I told him, he should not be 
concern’d at it at all, for I would ^lay on Shore. I only de- 
sir’d he would take Care and send me all my necessary 
Thingson Shore, andleavemeasufficientSumof Money, 
and I would find my Way to England^ as well as I could. 

This was a heavy Piece of News to my Nephew; but 
there was no Way to help it, but to comply with it : So, in 
short, he went on Board the Ship again, and satisfy’d the 
Men, that his Uncle had yielded to their Importunity, 
and had sent for his Goods from on Board the Ship ; so 
that Matter was over in a very few Hours, the Men re- 
turn’d to their Duty, and I begantoconsiderwhat Course 
I should fteer. 

I was now alone in the remote^ Part of the World, as I* 
think I may call it\ for I was near three thousand Leagues 
by Sea farther off from England^ than I was at my Island ; 
only it is true, I might travel here by Land over the Great 



Farther Adventures o/RobinsonCrusoe 107 
Mogul’s Country to Surratte., might go from thence to 
Basora by Sea, up the Gulph of Persia, and from thence 
might take the Way of the Caravans over the Desert of 
Arabia to Aleppo and Scanderoon\ from thence by Sea 
again to Italy, and so over Land into France, and this put 
together might be, at leaft, a full Diameter of the Globe; 
but if it were to be measur’d, I suppose it would appear to 
be a great deal more. 

I had another Way before me, which was to wait for 
some English Ships, which were coming to Bengale from 
Achin on the Island of Sumatra, and get Passage onBoard 
them for England: But as I came hither without any Con- 
cern with the English Ea§l-India Company, so it would be 
difficult to go from hence without their Licence, unless 
with great Favour of the Captains of the Ships, or of the 
Company’s Faftors, and to both, I was an utter Stranger. 

Here I had the particular Pleasure, speaking by Con- 
traries, to see the Ship set sail without me, a Treatment I 
think a Man in my Circum^ances scarce ever met with, 
except fromPirates running away witha Ship, and setting 
those that would not agree with their Villany, on Shore : 
indeed this was next Door to it, both Ways ; however, my 
Nephew left me two Servants, or rather one Companion, 
and one Servant, the fir^ was Clerk to the Purser, who he 
engag’d to go with me, and the other was his own Ser- 
vant; I took me also a good Lodging in the House of an 
English Woman, where several Merchants lodg’d; some 
French, two Italians, orT^th.e.rJews,2indiOncEnglish Man : 
Here I was handsomely enough entertain’d; and that I 
might not be said to run rashly upon any Thing, I ftay’d 
here above nine Months, consideringwhat Courseto take, 
and how to manage myself ; I had some English Goods 
with me of Value, and a considerable Sum of Money, my 



I o8 Farther Adventures <?/ Robinson Crusoe 

Nephew furnishing me with a thousand Pieces of Eight, 
and a Letter of Credit for more, if I had Occasion, that I 
might not be straiten’d whatever might happen. 

A quickly dispos’d of my Goods, and to Advantage too ; 
md, as I originally intended, I bought here some very 
'good Diamonds, which, of all other Things, was the mo^ 
proper for me in my present CircumSlances, because I 
might always carry my whole ESlate about me. 

After a long Stay here, and many Proposals made for 
my Return to England, but none falling out to my Mind, 
the English Merchant who lodged with me, and with 
whom I had contradled an intimate Acquaintance, cam^ 
to me one Morning : Country-man, says he, I have a Pro- 
ject to communicate to you, which, as it suits with my 
Thoughts, may for ought I know, suit with your’s also, 
when you shall have throughly consider’d it. 

Here we are poSled, says he, you by Accident, and I by 
my own Choice, in a Part of the World very remote from 
our own Country; but it is in a Country, where, by us 
who underhand Trade and Business, a great deal of Mo- 
ney is to be got : If you will put a thousand Pound to my 
thousand Pound, we will hire a Ship here, the firil we can 
get to our Minds ; you shall be Captain, I ’ll be Merchant, 
andwewill go a trading Voyage to for what should 

we ftand ^ill for.? The whole World is in Motion, rouling 
round and round; all the Creatures of God, heavenly 
Bodies and earthly are busy and diligent. Why should 
we be idle? There are no Drones in the World but IVfen, 
Why should we be of that Number? 

I lik’d his Proposal very well, and the more, because it 
seem’d to be express’d with so much good Will, and in so 
friendly a Manner : I will not say, but that I might by my 
loose and unhing’d Circumftances be the fitter to em- 



Farther Advetftures 0/ Robinson Crusoe io^ 

brace a Proposal for Trade, or indeed for any Thing else ; 
whereas, otherwise. Trade was none of my Element: 
However, I might perhaps say with some Truth, that if 
Trade was not my Element, Rambling was, and no Pro- 
posal for seeing any Part of the World which I had never 
seen before, could possibly come amiss to me. 

It was however, some Time before we could get a Ship 
to our Minds ; and when we had got a Vessel, it was not 
easy to get English Sailors ; that is to say, so many as were 
necessary to govern the Voyage, and manage the Sailors 
which we should pick up there : After some Time we got 
^ Mate, a Boatswain, and a Gunner English ; a Dutch Car- 
penter, and three Portugueze Fore-ma^l Men ; with these 
we found, we could do well enough, having Indian Sea- 
men, such as they are, to make up. 

There are so manyTravellers,whohavewrotetheHift- 
ory of their Voyages and Travels this W ay, that it would be 
very little Diversion to any Body, to give a long Account 
ofthePlaceswewentto,and the People who inhabitthere ; 
those Things I leave to others, and refer the Reader to 
those Journals and Travels of English Men, of which, 
many I find are publish’d, and more promis’d every Day ; 
’tis enough to me to tell you, That I made this Voyage to 
Achin, in the Island of Sumatra, and from thence to Siamy 
where we exchang’d some of our Wares for Opium, and 
some Arrack, the firft, a Commodity which bears a great 
Price among theC^6^»e^e,andwhichatthatTime,wasvery 
much wanted there; in a Word, we went up to Suskan, 
made a very great Voyage ; was eight Months out, and re- 
turn’d to Bengale, and I was very well satisfy ’d with my 
Adventure : I o bserve that our People in England, often ad- 
mire how the Officers which the Company send into India, 
and the Merchants which generally ilay there, get such 



1 1 o Farther Adventures 0/ Robinson Crusoe 

very great Estates as they do, and sometimes come Home 
worth 60, to 70 [and] 100 thousand Pound at a Time. 

But it is no Wonder, or at lea^l we shall see so much 
farther into it, when we consider the innumerable Ports 
and Places where they have a free Commerce ; that it will 
then be no Wonder ; and much less will it be so, when we 
consider, that at all those Places and Ports where the Fng- 
lish Ships come, there is so much, and such constant De- 
mand for the Growth of all other Countries, that there is a 
certain Vent for the Returns, as well as a Market abroad, 
for the Goods carried out. 

In short, we made a very good Voyage, and I got ^ 
much Money by the firft Adventure, and such an Insight 
into the Method of getting more, that had I been twenty 
Year younger, I should have been tempted to have ftaid 
here and sought no farther, for making my Fortune; but 
what was all this, to a Man on the wrong Side of three- 
score, that was rich enough, and came abroad, more in 
Obedience to a re^less Desire of seeing the World, than 
a covetous Desire of getting in it ; and indeed I think, ’tis 
with great Juftice, that I now call it a restless Desire for it 
was so ; when I was at Home, I was re^less to go abroad ; 
and now I was abroad, I was restless to be at Home : I say, 
what was this Gain to me? I was rich enough, nor had I 
any uneasie Desires about getting more Money and there- 
fore, the Profit of the Voyage to me, were Things of no 
great Force, for the promptingmeforward to farther Un- 
dertakings; and I thought that by this Voyage, 1 had 
made no Progress at all, because I was come back as I 
might call it, to the Place from whence I came as to a* 
Home ; whereas, my Eye, which like that, which Solomon 
speaks of, was never satisfied with Seeing^ was ^ill more 
•desirous of Wand’ring and Seeing ; Iwas come into a Part 



Farther Adventures 0/ Robinson Crusoe hi 
of the World, which I was never in before ; and that Part 
in particular, which I had heard much of; and was re- 
solv’d to see as much of as I could, and then I thought, I 
might say, I had seen all theWorld, that was worth seeing. 

But my Fellow Traveller and I, had different Notions ; 
I do not name this, to insi^ upon my own, for I acknow- 
ledge his were the mo^ ju^t and the moft suited to the 
end of a Merchant’s Life ; who, when he is abroad upon 
Adventures, ’tis his Wisdom to ftick to that as the be^ 
Thing for him, whichhe isliketo get the moft Money by : 
My new Friend kept himself to the Nature of the Thing, 
and would have been content to have gone like a Carrier’s 
florse, always to the same Inn, backward and forward, 
provided he could, as he call’d his Account in it\ on 

the other Hand, mine was the Notion of a mad rambling 
Boy, that never cares to see a Thing twice over. 

But this was not all ; I had a Kind of Impatience upon 
me to be nearer Home, and yet, the mo^l unsettled Re- 
solution imaginable which Way to go ; in the Interval of 
these Consultations, my Friend, who was always upon 
the Search for Business, propos’d another Voyage to me 
among the Spice Islands, and to bring Home a Loading 
of Cloves from t)x&Manillas, or thereabouts ;Places where 
indeed the Dutch do trade, but Islands, belonging partly 
to the Spaniards ; tho’we wentnotsofar,butto someother, 
where they have not the whole Power as they have at Ba- 
tavia, Ceylon, &c. we were not long in preparing for this 
Voyage ; the chief Difficulty was in bringing me to come 
into it ; however, at laft nothing else offering, and finding 
that really stirring about and trading, the Profit being so 
great, and as I may say certain, had more Pleasure in it, 
and more Satisfaftion to the Mind than sitting ftill, which 
to me especially, was the unhappiell Part of Life : I re- 



II2 Farther Adventures of Kohl'S Q Vi xs sot 

solv’d on this Voyage too, which we made very success- 
fully, touching at Borneo, and several Islands, whose 
Names I do not remember, and came Home in about five 
Months ; we sold our Spice, which was chiefly Cloves, and 
some Nutmegs, to the Persian Merchants, who carried 
them,awayfor the Gulph; and making near five of one, 
we really got a great deal of Money. 

My Friend, when we made up this Account smil’d at 
me; well now., said he, with a Sort of agreeable insulting 
my indolent Temper; is not this better than walking 
about here, like a Man of nothing to do, and spending our 
Time in Glaring at the Nonsense and Ignorance of the Pa- 
gans.^ Why truly, says I, my Friend, I think it is; and 1 
begin to be a Convert to the Principles of Merchandiz- 
ing; but I mu^I tell you, said I, by the Way, you do not 
know what I am a doing; for if once I conquer, my back- 
wardness, and embark heartily; as old as I am, I shall 
harrass you up and down the World, till I tire you; for I 
shall pursue it so eagerly, I shall never let you lye ^lill. 

But to be shortwith my Speculations,a littlewhile after 
this, there came in a Dutch Ship from Batavia ; she was a 
Coaler, not an European Trader, and of about two hun- 
dred Ton Burthen : The Men, as they pretended having 
been so sickly, that the Captain had not Men enough to 
go to Sea with ; he lay by at Bengal, and having it seems 
got Money enough, or being willing for other Reasons, 
to go for Europe, he gave publick Notice, that he would 
sell his Ship : This came to my Ears before my new Part- 
ner heard of it ; and I had a great Mind to buy it, so I goes 
Home to him, and told him of it; he considered a whflc,# 
for he was no rash lylan neither; but musing some Time, 
he reply’d, she is a little too big; but however, we will 
have her; accordingly we bought the Ship, and agreeing 



Farther Adventures of 'Robins ovf Crusoe 113 

with the Mailer, we paid for her, and took Possession ; 
when we had done so, we resolved to entertain the Men if 
we could, to join them with those we had, for the pursu- 
ing our Business; but on a sudden, they having receiv’d 
not their Wages, but their Share of the Money, not one 
of them was to be found; we enquir’d much abouwhem, 
and at length were told, that they were all gone together 
by Land to Agra^ the great City of the Mogul's Residence ; 
and from thence were to travel to Suratte, and so by Sea, 
to the Gulph of Persia. 

Nothing had so heartily troubled me a good while; as 
that I miss’d the Opportunity of going with them ; for 
’such a Ramble I thought, and in such Company, as would 
both have guarded me and diverted me, would have suit- 
ed mightily with my great Design ; and I should both have 
seenthe World, andgonchomewards too ; but I wasmuch 
better satisfied a few Days after, when I came to know 
what sortof Fellows they were ; for in short, their Hiftory 
was, that this Man they call’d Captain was the Gunner 
only, not the Commander ; that they had been a trading 
Voyage,in which, they wereattack’don Shore, by some of 
the Mallayans, who had kill’d the Captain, and three of 
his Men ; and that after the Captain was kill’d, these Men 
Eleven in Number, had resolv’d to run away with the 
Ship, which they did; and brought her in at the Bay of 
Bengale, leaving the Mate and five Men more on Shore, 
of whom, we shall hear farther. 

Well, let them come b*y the Ship how they would, we 
came hone^ly by her, as zve thought, tho’ we did not I con- 
fess, examine into Things so exactly as we ought, for we 
never enquir’d any Thing of the Seamen ; who, if we had 
examin’d, would certainly have falter’d in their Account, 
contradiftedoneanother,andperhapscontradiftedthem-

selves, or one how or other, we should have seen Reason 
to have suspefted them ; but the Man shew’d us a Bill of 
Sale for the Ship, to one Emanuel CloSlershoven, or some 
such Name ; for I suppose it was all a Forgery, and call’d 
himself by that Name, and we could not contradift him ; 
and being withal, a little too unwary, or at lea^, having 
no Suspicion of the Thing, we went thro’ with our 
Bargain. 

We pick’d' up some more English Seamen here after 
this, and some Dutch \ and now we resolved for a second 
Voyage, to the South Ea^ for Cloves, that is to say, 
among the Philippine iin 6 .Mollucco Isles ; and in short, nqt 
to fill this Part of my Story with Trifles, when what is yet 
to come, is so remarkable ; I spent from fir^l to la^l six 
Years in this Country, trading from Port to Port, back- 
ward and forward, and with very good Success; and was 
now the la^l Year with my new Partner, going in the Ship 
above-mention ’d, on a Voyage to China-, but designing 
firft to Siam, to buy Rice. 

In this Voyage, being by contrary Winds oblig’d to 
beat up and down a great while in the Straits of Mallacca, 
and among the Islands; we were no sooner got clear of 
those difficult Seas, but we found our Ship had sprung a 
Leak, and we were not able by all our Industry to find it 
out where it was : This forc’d us to make for some Port, 
and my Partner who knew the Country better than I did, 
directed the Captain to put info the River of Cambodia, 
for I had made the English Mate, one Mr. Thomson, Cap- 
tain, not being willing to take the Charge of the Ship upon 
my self; This River lies on the North Side of the greatBay 
or Gulph, which goes up to Siam. 

While we were here, and going often on Shore for Re- 
freshment, there comes to me one Day an English Man, 



Farther Adventures of '9^0 hi ^ soli Crusoe 115 
and he was it seems a Gunner’s Mate, on board an Eng- 
lish Eall-India Ship, which rode in the same River, up at, 
or near the City of Cambodia ; what brought him hither we 
know not; but he comes up to me, and speaking English'. 
Sir, says he, you are a Stranger to me, and I to you ; but I 
have something to tell you, that very nearly concerns you. 

I look’d steadily at him a good while, and thought at 
firil I had known him, but I did not ; if it very nearly con- 
cerns me, said I, and not your self, what moves you to tell 
it me? I am moved says he, by the eminent Danger you 
are in, and for ought I see, you have no Knowledge of it ; I 
Jcnow no Danger I am in,saidl,butthatmy Ship is leaky, 
and I cannot find it out; but I purpose to lay her a- 
Ground to Morrow, to see if I can find it ; but Sir, says he, 
leaky, or not leaky, find it, or not find it, you will be wiser 
than to lay your Ship on Shore to Morrow, when you hear 
what I have to say to you ; do you know Sir, said he, the 
Town of Cambodia., lyes about fifteen Leagues up this Ri- 
ver? and there are two large English Ships about five Lea- 
gues on this Side, and three Dutch \ well said /, and what 
is that to me? Why Sir, said he., is it for a Man that is up- 
on such Adventures as you are upon, to come into a Port, 
and not examine fir^lwhat Ships there are there, and whe- 
ther he is able to deal with them? I suppose you don’t 
think you are a Match for them : I was amused very much 
at his Discourse, but not amaz’d at it, for I could not con- 
ceive what he meant; and I turn’d short upon him and 
said. Sir, I wish you would explain your self; I cannot 
imagine what Reason I have to be afraid of any Company 
Ships, or Dutch Ships ; I am no Interloper, what can they 
have to say to me? 

He look’d like a Man half angry, half pleas’d, andpaus- 
ing a while, but smiling; well Sir, says he, if you think 



1 1 6 Farther Adventures 0/ Robinson Crusoe 

your self secure, you muft take your Chance; I am sorry 
your Fate should blind you againft good Advice ; but as- 
sure your self, if you do not put to Sea immediately, you 
will the very next Tide be attack’dby fiveLong-Boats full 
of Men, and perhaps if you are taken, you’ll be hang’d for 
a Pirate, and the Particulars be examin’d afterwards: I 
thought Sir, added he, I should have met with a better 
Reception than this, for doing you a Piece of Service of 
such Importance : I can never be ungrateful, said /, for 
any Service, or to any Man that offers me any Kindness, 
but it is pa^ my Comprehension said I, what they should 
have such a Design upon me for, however, since you say, 
there is no Time to be loft, and that there is some villain- 
ous Design in Hand againft me ; I’ll goon board this Min- 
ute, and put to Sea immediately. If my Men can ftop the 
leak, or if we can swim without ftopping it? But, Sir, said 
I, shall I go away ignorant of the Reason of all this? Can 
you give me no farther Light into it? 

lean tell you but Part of the Story, Sir, says he, but I have 
a Dutch Seaman here with me, and I believe I could per- 
suade him to tell you the reft ; but there is scarce time for 
it. But the short of the Story is this, the firft Partofwhich, 
I suppose, you know well enough, (wz.)thatyouwas with 
this Ship at Sumatra, that there your Captain was mur- 
ther’d by the Mallayans, with three of his Men, and that 
you or some of those who were on board with you, ran 
away with the Ship, and are since turn’d PIR ATES 
this is the Sum of the Story, and you will be all seiz’d as 
Pirates I can assure you, and executed, with very little 
Ceremony; for you know. Merchants Ships shew but lit- 
tle Law to Pirates, if they get them into their Power. 

Now you speak plain English, said I, and I thank you ; 
andtho’ Iknow nothing, that we have done, like what you 



Farther Adventures of ^o'Ri'sso's Crusoe 117 

talk of, but am sure we came hone^ly and fairly by the 
Ship, yet seeing such Work is a doing as you say, and that 
you seem to mean honeftly, I’ll be upon my guard; nay. 
Sir, says he, do not talk of being upon your guard; the 
be^ Defence, is to be out of the Danger, if you have any 
Regard to your Life, and the Life of all your Men ; put 
out to Sea without fail at High Water, and as you have a 
whole Tide before you, you will be gone too far out be- 
fore they can come down, for they came away at High 
Water; and as they have twenty Miles to come, you get 
near two Hours of them, by the Difference of the Tide, 
•not reckoning the Length of the Way; besides, as they 
are only Boats, and not Ships, they will not venture to fol- 
low you far out to Sea, especially if it blows. 

Well, says /, you have been very kind in this, what shall 
I do for you, to make you amends? Sir, says he, you may 
not be so willing to make me any amends, because you 
may not be convinc’d of the Truth of it : I’ll make an of- 
fer to you; I have nineteen Months Pay due to me, on 
board the Ship which I came out of Eng- 

land in, and the Dutch Man that is with me, has seven 
Months Pay due to him ; if you will make good our Pay to 
us, we will go along with you; if you find nothing more 
in it, we will desire no more ;butifwedo convince you, that 
we have sav’d your Lives, and the Ship, and the Lives of 
all the Men in her, we will leave the reft to you. 

I consented to this readily, and went immediately on 
board, and the two Men with me ; as soon as I came to the 
Ship Side, my Partner who was on board, came out on the 
Quarter-Deck, and call’d to me with a great deal of Joy, 
0 ho! O oh! we have §lopp'd the leak! we have Slopped the 
leak! Say you so, said /, thank God; but weigh the An- 
chor then immediately ; weigh ! Says he : W hat do you mean 



1 1 8 Farther Adventures o/RobinsonCrusoe 

by that? What is the Matter, says he? Ask no Questions, 
says /, but all Hands to work, and weigh, without losing a 
Minute; he was surpriz'd, but however, he call’dtheCap- 
tain, and he immediately order’d the Anchor to be got up ; 
and tho’ the Tide was not quite done, yet a little Land 
Breeze blowing, we ^tood out to Sea ; then I call’d him in- 
to the Cabin and told him the Story at large, and we call’d 
in the Men, and they told us the re^l of it ; but as it took 
us up a great deal of Time, so before we had done, a Sea- 
man comes to the Cabin Door, and calls out to us, that the 
Captain bad him tell us, we were chas’d; chas’d, says /, by 
who, and by what? By five Sloops or Boats, says the Fela,, 
low, full of Men ; very well, w/W/,thenit is apparent there 
is something in it ; in the next Place I order’d all our Men 
to be call’d up, and told them, that there was a Design to 
seize the Ship, and to take us for Pirates, and ask’d them, 
if they would ^and by us, and by one another; the Men 
answer’d chearfully, that one and all, they would live and 
die with us: Then I asked the Captain, what Way he 
thought beft for us to manage a Fight with them ; for re- 
sist them I was resolved we would, and that, to the la^l 
Drop ; he said readily, That the W ay was to keep them off 
with our great Shot, as longas we could, and then to fire at 
them with our small Arms as long as we coujd ; but when 
neither of these would do any longer, we should retire to 
our close Quarters ; perhaps they had not Materials to 
break open our Bulk-heads, or get in upon us. 

The Gunner had in the mean Time, Order to bring 
two Guns to bear fore and aft out of the Steerage, to clear 
the Deck, and load them with Musquet-Bullets and small 
Pieces of old Iron, and what next came to Hand, and thus 
we made ready for Fight ; but all this while we kept out to 
Sea, with Wind enough ; and could see the Boats at a Dis- 



Farther Adventures o/RobinsonCrusoe 119 
tance, being five large Long-Boats, following us with all 
the sail they could make. 

Two of those Boats, which by our Glasses we could see 
were English, out sailed the reft, were near two Leagues a 
Head of them, and gain’d upon us considerably; so that 
we found they would come up with us ; upon which, we 
fired Gun without Ball, to intimate, thatthey should bring 
too, and we put out a Flag of Truce ; as a Signal for Par- 
ley, but they kept crowding after us, till tlvsy came within 
Shot: When we took in our White Flag, they having 
made no Answer to it, hung out a red Flag, and fired at 
them with a Shot: Notwithftanding this, they came on, 
till they were near enough to call to them with a speaking 
Trumpet, which we had on Board ; so we call’d to them, 
and bid them keep off at their Peril. 

It was all one, they crowded after us, and endeavoured 
to come under our Stern, so to board us on our Quarter; 
upon which, seeing they were resolute for Mischief, and 
depended upon the ftrength that followed them, I order- 
ed to bring the Ship too, so that they lay upon our Broad- 
side, when immediately we fir’d five Guns at them ; one of 
which, had been levelled so true, as to carry away the 
Stern of the hindermoft Boat, and bring them to the Ne- 
cessity of taking down their Sail, and running all to the 
Head of the' Boat to keep her from sinking ; so she lay by, 
and had enough of it ; but seeing the foremoft Boat crowd 
on after us, we made ready to fire at her in particular. 

While this was doing, one of the three Boats that was 
behind, being forwarder than the other two, made up to 
the Boat which we had disabled, to relieve her, and we 
could afterwards see hertakeoutthe Men ; we call’d again 
to the foremoft Boat, and offer’d a Truce to parley again, 
and to know what was her Business with us ; but had no 



120 Farther Adventures o/Robinson Crusoe 

Answer, only she crowded close under our Stern ; upon 
thisourGunner,whowasavery dexterousFellow, run out 
his two Chase-Guns, and fired again at her; but the Shot 
missing, the Men in the Boat shouted, wav’d their Caps, 
and came on ; but the Gunner gettingquicklyreadyagain, 
fir’d among them the second Time; one Shot of which, 
tho’ it miss’d the Boat it self, yet fell in among the Men, 
and we could easily see, had done a great deal of Mischief 
among them; but we taking no Notice of that, war’d the 
Ship again, and brought our Quarter to bear upon them ; 
and firing three Guns more, we found the Boat was split 
almost to Pieces ; in particular, her Rudder, and a Piece^ 
of her Stern was shot quite away, so they handed their 
Sail immediately, and were in great Disorder ; but tocom- 
pleat their Misfortune, our Gunner let fly two Guns at 
them again ; where he hit them we could not tell, but we 
found the Boat was sinking, and some of the Men already 
in the Water; upon this, I immediately man’d out our 
Pinnace, which we had kept close by our Side, with Or- 
ders to pick up some of the Men if they could, and save 
them from drowning, and immediately to come on board 
with them ; because we saw the reft of the Boats began to 
come up ; Our Men in the Pinnace followed their Orders, 
and took up three Men ; one of which was juft drowning, 
and it was a good while before we could recover him; 
as soon as they were on Board, we crouded all the Sail we 
could make, and ftood farther out to Sea, and we found 
that when the other three Boats came up to the firft two, 
they gave over their Chace. 

Being thus deliver’d from a Danger, which tho’ I knew 
not the Reason of it, yet seem’d to be much greater than I 
apprehended; I took Care that we would change our 
Course, and not let any one imagine whither we were go- 



Farther Adventures 0/ Robinson Crusoe lai 
ing; so we ilood out to Sea Eaftward, quite out of the 
Course of all Europian Ships, whether they were bound to 
China, or any where else, within the Commerce of the 
Europian Nations, 

When we were now at Sea, we began to consult with 
the two Seamen, and enquire firft what the meaning of all 
this should be, and the Dutch Man let us into the secret of 
it at once ; telling us that the Fellow that sold us the Ship, 
as we said, was no more than a Thief, that had run away 
with her : Then he told us, how the Captain, whose Name 
too he told us, tho’ I do not remember, was treacherously 
murthered by the Natives on the Coaft of Mallaca, with 
three of his Men, and that he, this Dutch Man, and four 
more, got into the Woods, where they wandered about a 
great while ; till at length, hein particular, in a miraculous 
manner made his Escape, and swam off to a Dutch Ship, 
which sailing near the Shore, in its Way from China, had 
sent their Boat on Shore for fresh Water; that he dur^f 
not come to that Part of the Shore where the Boat was,but 
[made] shiftin the Night, to take the Waterfarther oflF, and 
the Ship’s Boat took him up. 

He then told us, that he went to Battavia, where two 
of the Sea-men belonging to the Ship arriv’d, having de- 
serted the reil in their Travels, and gave an Account that 
the Fellow who had run away with the Ship, sold her at 
Bengale, to a Set of Pirates, which were gone a Cruising 
in her; and that they had already taken an English Ship 
and two Dutch Ships very richly laden. 

This later Part we found to concern us direftly, and 
tho’ we knew it to be false ; yet as my Partner said very 
well, if we had fallen into their Hands, and they had had 
such a Prepossession again^ us beforehand, it had been 
in vain for us to have defended our selves, or to hope for 



122 Farther Adventures ^Robinson Crusoe 

any good Quarter attheir Hands, and especially consider- 
ing that our Accusers had been our Judges, and that we 
could have expefted nothing from them, but what Rage 
would have dictated, and an ungoverned Passion have 
executed; and therefore it was his Opinion, we should go 
diredUy back to Bengale^ from whence we came, without 
putting in at any Port whatever ; because there, we could 
give a good Account of our selves, could prove where we 
were when the^hip put in, who we bought her of, and the 
like ; and which was more than all the re^l, if we were put 
to the Necessity of bringing it before the proper Judges, 
we should be sure to have some Justice, and not be hang'd 
fir^, and judg’d afterward. 

I was sometime of my Partner’s Opinion; but after a 
little more serious thinking, I told him, I thought it was a 
very great Hazard for us to attempt returning to Bengaky 
for that we were on the wrong side of the Straits of Malac- 
ca ; and that if the Alarm was given, we should be sure to 
be Way-laid on every side, as well by the Dutch of Batta- 
via, as the English else-where ; that if we should be taken, 
as it were, running away, we should even condemn our 
selves, and there would want no more Evidence to de- 
stroy us; I also asked the English Sailor’s Opinion, who 
said, he was of my Mind, and that we should certainly 
be taken. 

This Danger, a little Partied my Partner and all the 
Ship’s Company; and we immediately resolved to go 
away to the Coa^l of 'Tonquin, and so on to the Coa^t of 
China, and pursuing the firft Design as to Trade, find 
some Way or other to dispose of the Ship, and come bacl» 
in some of the Vessels of the Country, such as we could 
get: This was approved of as the beft Method for our Se- 
curity; and accordingly we fleered away N.N.E. keep- 



Farther Adventuresof^o^ivisovf Crusoe 123 
ing above fifty Leagues off from the usual Course to the 
Eaftward. 

This however put us to some Inconveniencies ; for firil 
the Winds, when we came to the Distance from the Shore, 
seem’d to be more steadily againft us, blowing almoft 
Trade, as we call it, from the Eaft, and E.N.E. so that we 
were a long while upon our Voyage, and we were but ill 
provided with Victuals for so long a Voyage; and which 
was ifill worse, there was some Danger that those English 
and Dutch Ships, whose Boats pursued us, whereof some 
were bound that Way, might be got in before us, and if 
not, some other Ship, bound to China, might have Infor- 
mation of us from them, and pursue us with the same 
Vigour. 

I mu^ confess, I was now very uneasy, and thought 
myself, including the late Escape from the Long-Boats, 
to have been in the mo^f dangerous Condition that ever I 
was in thro’ all my pa^ Life ; for whatever ill Circum- 
stances I had been in, I was never pursu’d for a Thief be- 
fore; nor had I ever done any Thing that merited the 
Name of DishoneSt or Fraudulent, much less Thievish. I 
had chiefly been my own Enemy, or as- 1 may rightly say, 
I had been no Body’s Enemy but my own : But now I was 
embarrass’d in the worSt Condition imaginable ; for tho’ 
I was perfectly innocent, I was in no Condition to make 
that Innocence appear: And if I had been taken, it had 
been under a supposed Guilt of the worSl Kind ; at leaSl, a 
Crime eSleem’d so among the People I had to do with. 

This made me very anxious to make an Escape, tho’, 
which Way to do it, I knew not, or what Port or Place we 
should go to: My Partner seeing me thus dejefted, tho’ 
he was the moSl concern’d at firSl, began to encourage 
me ; and discribing to me the several Ports of that Coa^, 



1 24. Farther Adventures o/RobinsonCrusoe 

told me he would put in on the Coa^l of Chochinchina, or 
the Bay of ‘Tonquin, intending to go afterwards to Macao, 
a Town once in the Possession of the Portuguese, and 
where ifill a great many European Families resided, and 
particularly the Missionary Priests usually went thither, 
in order to their going forward to China, 

Hither then we resolv’d to go; and accordingly, tho’ 
after a tedious and irregular Course, and very much ^rai- 
tned for Provisions, we came within Sight of the Coaft 
very early in the Morning ; and upon Refleftion upon the 
pail Circum^ances we were in, and the Danger if we had 
not escaped, we resolv’d to put into a small River, which# 
however had a Depth enough of Water for us, and to see 
if we could, either over Land, or by the Ship’s Pinnace, 
come to know what Ships were in any Port thereabouts. 
This happy Step, was indeed our Deliverance ; for tho’ we 
did not immediately see any Europian Ships in the Bay of 
Tonquin, yet the next Morning there came into the Bay 
two Dutch Ships, and a third without any Colours spread 
out, but which we believ’d to be a Dutch Man, pass’d by 
at about two Leagues Distance, Peering for the Coa^ of 
China ; and in the Afternoon went by two English Ships 
Peering the same Course ; and thus, we thought, we saw 
our selves beset with Enemies, both one Way or other. 
The Place we were in was wild and barbarous, the People 
Thieves, even by Occupation or Profession ; and tho’ it is 
true we had not much to seek of ^hem, and except getting 
a few Provisions, car’d not how little we had to do with 
them, yet it was with much Difficulty that we kept our 
selves from being insulted by them several Ways. * 
We were in a sihall River of this Country, within a few 
Leagues of its utmost Limits Northward; and by our 
Boat we coasted North-Ea^f to the Point of Land, which 



Farther Adventures o/R obinsonCrusok 125“ 

opens the great Bay of ‘Tonquin\ and it was in this beating 
up along the Shore, that we discover’d, as above, that in a 
Word, we were surrounded with Enemies. The People 
we were among, were the mo^ barbarous of all the In- 
habitants of the Coaft; having no Correspondence with 
any other Nation, and dealing only in Fish, and OiJ, and 
such gross Commodities ; and it may be particularly seen, 
that they are, as 1 said, the mo^ barbarous of any ot the 
Inhabitants, {viz.) that among other Cu^tpms they have 
this as oj^e, (viz.) That if any Vessel have the Misfortune 
to be shipwreck’d upon their Coaft, they presently make 
^ their Men all Prisoners or Slaves ; and it was not long be- 
fore we found a Spice of their Kindness this Way, on the 
Occasion following. 

I have observed above, that our Ship sprung a Leak at 
Sea, and that we could not find it out; and however, it 
happen’d, that as I have said it was flopp’d unexpeftedly 
in the happy Minute of our being to be seiz’d by t\\tDutch 
and English Ships in the Bay of Siam ; yet as we did not 
find the Ship so perfectly fit and sound as we desir’d, we 
resolv’d, while we were in this Place, to lay her on Shore, 
take out what heavy Things we had on Board, which were 
not many, and to wash and clean her Bottom, and, if possi- 
ble, to find out where the Leaks were. 

Accordingly, having lighten’d the Ship, and brought 
all our Guns and other moveable Things to one side, we 
try’d to bring her down, that we might come at her Bot- 
tom ; but on second Thoughts we did not care to lay her 
dry on Ground, neither could we find out a proper Place 
for it. 

The Inhabitants, who had never been acquainted with 
such a sight, came wondering down to the Shore, to look 
at us ; and seeing the Ship lie down on one Side in such a 



126 Farther Adventures o/RobinsonCrusoe 

manner, and heeling in towards the Shore ; and not seeing 
our Men, who were at Work on her Bottom, with Stages 
and with their Boats on the ofF-side, they presently con- 
cluded, that the Ship was ca^l away, and lay so fa^ on the 
Ground. 

Or this Supposition they came all about us in two or 
three Hours time, with ten or twelve large Boats, having 
some of them eight, some ten Men in a Boat, intending, 
no doubt, to have come on Board, and plunder’dtheShip; 
and if they had found us there, to have carry ’d us away for 
Slaves to their King, or whatever they call him ; for we 
knew nothing who was their Governour. ^ 

When they came up to the Ship, and began to row 
round her, they discover’d us all hard at Work on the Out- 
side of the Ship’s bottom and side, washing, and graving, 
and flopping, as every seafaring Man knows how. 

They ^ood for a while gazing at us, and we, who were 
a little surpriz’d, could not imagine what their Design 
was; but, being wi7//«§'/o^^5»r^,wetookthis Opportunity 
to get some of us into the Ship, and others to hand down 
Arms and Ammunition to those that were at Work, to 
defend themselves with, if there should be Occasion ; and 
it was no more than Need ; for in less than a quarter of an 
Hour’s Consultation, they agreed, it seems, that the Ship 
was really a Wreck, that we were all at Work endeavour- 
ing to save her, or to save our Lives by the Help of our 
Boats, and when we handed our Arms into the Boats, they 
concluded, by that Motion, that we were endeavouring 
to save some of our Goods; upon this they took it for 
granted we all belong’d to them; and away they caime 
down upon our Men, as if it had been in a Line of 
.Battle. 

Our Men, seeing so many of them, began to be fright- 



Farther Adventures c/Robikson Crusoe 127 

ed ; for we lay but in an ill Posture to fight, and cry’d out 
to us to know what they should do: I immediately call’d 
to the Men who work’d upon the Stages, to slip them 
down, and get up the side into the Ship ; and bad those in 
the Boat to row round and come on Board; and those few 
of us, who were on board, work’d with all the ^rength 
and hands we had, to bring the Ship to Rights ; but how- 
ever, neither the Men upon the Stages or those in the 
Boats, could do as they were order’d, before the Coebin- 
chinesses were upon them ; and two of their Boats boarded 
our Long-Boat, and began to lay hold of the Men as their 
Prisoners. 

The firft Man they laid hold of was an English Sea- 
man, a ftout ^rong Fellow, who having a Musket in his 
Hand, never offer’d to fire it, but laid it down in the Boat, 
like a Fool, as I thought: But he underwood his Business 
better than I could teach him ; for he grappled the Pagan, 
and dragg’d him by main Force, out of their own Boat in- 
to ours ; where, taking him by the two Ears, he beat his 
Head, so against the Boat’s Gunnel, that the Fellow dy’d 
instantly in his Hands; and in the mean time, a Dutch 
Man, who ftood next, took up the Musket, and with the 
But-end of it, so laid about him, that he knock’d down 
five of them, who attempted to enter the Boat; But this 
was doing little towards residing thirty or fourty Men, 
who fearless, because ignorant of their Danger, began to 
throw themselves into the Long-Boat, where we had but 
five Men in all to defend it : But one Accident gave our 
Men a compleat Viftory, which deserv’d our Laughter 
rather than any Thing else, and that was this: 

Our Carpenter being preparing to grave the Out-side 
of the Ship, as well as to pay the Seams, where he had 
caulk’d her to ^op the Leakes, had got two Kettles juft 



128 Farther Adventures o/ R obinson Crusoe 
let down into the Boat; one fill’d with boiling Pitch, and 
the other with Rosin, Tallow, and Oil, and such Stuff, as 
the Ship-Wrights use for that Work; and the Man that 
tended the Carpenter, had a great Iron Ladle in his Hand, 
with which he supply’d the Men that were at Work 
with fhat hot Stuff; two of the Enemies Men entred the 
Boat juft where this Fellow ftood, being in the Fore- 
sheets ; he immediately saluted them with a Ladle full of 
the Stuff, boiling hot, which so burnt and scalded them, 
being half naked, that they roar’d out like two Bulls, and, 
enrag’d with the Fire, leap’d both into the Sea : The Car- 
penter saw it, and cry’d out, Well done, Jack, give them 
some more of it ; and ftepping forward himself, takes one’ 
of their Mops, and dipping it in the Pitch-Pot, he and his 
Man threw it among them so plentifully that, in short, of 
all the Men in three Boats, there was not one that was 
not scalded, and burnt with it in a moft frightful pitiful 
Manner, and made such a Howling and Crying, that I 
never heard a worse Noise, and indeed nothing like it;for 
it is worth observing. That tho’ Pain naturally makes all 
People cry out, yet every Nation has a particular Way of 
Exclamation, and make Noises as different from one an- 
other, as their Speech; I cannot give the Noise, these 
Creatures made, a better Name than Howling, nor a 
Name more proper to the Tone of it; for I never heard 
any Thing more like the Noise of the Wolves, which as I 
have said, I heard howl in the Foreft on the Frontiers of 
Languedoc. 

I was never pleas’d with a Viftory better in my Life; 
not only as it was a perfeft Surprize to me, and that aur 
Danger was imminent before : but as we got this Viftory 
^without any Blood shed, except of that Man the Fellow 
"kiU’d with his naked Hands, and which I was very much 



Farther AdvenmresofKo^ivisovi Crusoe 129 

concern’d at; for I was sick of killing such poor Savage 
Wretches, even tho’ it was in my own Defence, knowing 
they came on Errands which they thought ju^l, and knew 
no better; and that tho’ it may be a juft Thing, because 
necessary, for there is no necessary Wickedness in Na- 
ture, yet I thought it was a sad Life, which we muft be 
always oblig’d to be killing our Fellow-Creatures to pre- 
serve, and indeed I think so ftill ; and I would even now 
suffer a great deal, rather than I would jtake away the 
Life, even of that Person injuring me : And I believe, all 
considering People, who knowthe Value ofLife, wouldbe 
ofmy opinion, at leaft, they would, if theyentred serious- 
ly into the Consideration of it. 

But to return to my Story, all the while this was doing, 
my Partner and I, who manag’d the reft of the Men on 
Board, had with great Dexterity brought the Ship almoft 
to Rights ; and having gotten the Guns into their Places 
again, the Gunner call’d to me, to bid our Boat get out of 
the Way, for he would let fly among them. I call’d back 
again to him, and bid him not offer to fire, for the Car- 
penter would do the Work without him, but bad him heat 
another Pitch- Kettle, which our Cook, who was onBoard, 
took Care of : But the Enemy were so terrify’d with what 
they had met with in their firft Attack, that they would 
not come on again ; and some of them that were fartheft 
off, seeing the Ship swim, as it were upright, begun, as we 
supposed, to see their Miftake, and give over the Enter- 
prize, finding it was not as they expefted: Thus we got 
clear of this merry Fight; and having gotten some Rice, 
and some Roots, and Bread, with about sixteen good big 
Hogs on Board, two Days before, we resolv’d to ftay here 
no longer, but go forward whatever came of it; for we 
made no Doubt but we should be surrounded the next 

VOL. HI k 



1 30 Farther Adventures o/ R obinson Crusoe 
Day with Rogues enough, perhaps more than our Pitch- 
Kettle would dispose of for us. V 

We therefore got all our Things on Board the same 
Evening, and the next Morning was ready to sail ; in the 
mean time, lying at an Anchor at some Diftance, we were 
not so much concern’d, being now in a fighting Po^ure, 
as well as in a sailing Posture, if any Enemy had present- 
ed : The next Dayhavingfinish’dour Workwithin Board, 
and findingoyr Ship was perfeftly heal’d of all her Leaks, 
we set sail ; we would have gone into the Bay of 'Fonqmn\ 
forwewantedtoinformourselvesofwhatwas to be known 
concerning the I>utch Ships that had been there ; but we 
duril not ^land in there, because we had seen several 
Ships go in, as we suppos’d, but a little before ; so we kept 
on N. E. towards the Isle of Formosa^ as much afraid of 
being seen by a Dutch or English Merchant Ship, as a 
Dutch or English Merchant Ship in the Mediterranean is 
of an Algerine Man of War. 

When we were thus got to Sea, we kept out N. E. as if 
we would go to the Munillas or the Phillippine Islands; 
and this we did, that we might not fall into the Way of any 
of our European Ships ; and then we Peer’d North ’till we 
came to the Latitude of 22 Degrees, 30 Min. ; by which 
Means we made the Island Formosa direftly, where we 
came to an Anchor, in order to get Water and fresh Pro- 
visions, which the People there, who are very courteous 
and civil in their Manners, supply’d us with willingly, 
and dealt very fairly and pun'clually with us in all their 
Agreements and Bargains ; which is what we did not find 
among other People; and may be owing to the Remains 
of Chri^ianity, which was once planted here by a Dutch 
Missionary of Prote^ants, and is a Testimony of what I 
have often observ’d, w'z. That the Chriftian Religion al- 



Farther Adventures 0/ Robinson Crusoe 131 

ways civilizes the People, and reforms their Manners, 
where it is receiv’d, whether it works saving Effects upon 
them or no. 

From hence we sail’d ^lill North, keeping the Coa^ of 
China at an equal Di^lance, till we knew we were beyond 
all the Ports of China, where our European Ships usually 
come; being resolv’d, if possible, not to fall into any of 
their Hands, especially in this Country, where, as our 
Circumftances were, we could not fail of being entirely 
ruin’d; nay, so great was my Fear in particular, as to my 
being taken by them, that I believe firmly, I would much 
rather have chosen to fall into the Hands of the Spanish 
* Inquisition. 

Being now come to the Latitude of 30 Degrees, we re- 
solv’d to put into the fir^l trading Port we should come 
at; and ^landing in for the Shore, a Boat came off two 
Leagues to us, with an old Portuguese Pilot on Board, who 
knowing us to be an European Ship, came to offer his Ser- 
vice, which indeed we were very glad of, and took him on 
Board ; upon which, without asking us whetherwe would 
go, he dismiss’d the Boat he came in, and sent them back. 

I thought it was now so much in our Choice, to make 
the old Man carry us whither we would; that I began to 
■ talk with him about carrying us to the Gulph of Nanquin, 
which is the mo^l Northern Part of the Coa^t of China: 
The old Man said he knew the Gulph of Nanquin very 
well; but smiling, ask’d us what we would do there.? 

I told him, we would ’sell our Cargo, and purchase 
CAiwa-Wares, Callicoes, Raw-Silks, Tea, Wrought-Silks, 
^c. and so would return by the same Course we came: 
He told us our be^l Port had been to have put inat Macao, 
where wecould not have fail’d of a Market for our Opium, 
to our Satisfaftion, and might for our Money have pur- 



1 32 Farther Adventures o/RobinsonCrusoe 
chas’d all Sorts of China-Goo 6 &, as cheap as we could at 
Nanquin. 

Not being able to put the old Man out of his Talk, of 
which he was very opinionated or conceited, I told him, 
we were Gentlemen, as well as Merchants, and that we 
had ‘a Mind to go and see the great City of Pecking, and 
the famous Court of the Monarch of China. Why then, 
says the old Man, you should go to Ningpo, where, by the 
River which runs into the Sea there, you may go up with- 
in five Leagues of the Great Canal. This Canal is a navi- 
gable River, which goes thorow the Heart of that va^l: 
Empire of China, crosses all the Rivers, passes some con-, 
siderable Hills by the Help of Sluices and Gates, and 
goes up to the City of Pecking, being in Length near 270 
Leagues. 

Well, said I, Seignior Portuguese, but that is not our 
Business now : The great Question is. If you can carry us 
up to the City of Nanquin, from whence we can travel to 
Pecking afterwards } Y es, he said, he could do so very well, 
and that there was a great Dutch Ship gone up that Way 
ju^ before. This gave me a little Shock ; and a Dutch Ship 
was now our Terror, and we had much rather have met 
the Devil, at leaft, if he had not come in too frightful a 
Figure ; and we depended upon it, that zDutch Ship would 
be our Deftrudlion, for we were in no Condition to fight 
them ; all the Ships they trade with into those Parts being 
of great Burthen, and of mu,ch greater Force than we 
were. 

The old Man found me a little confus’d, and under 
some Concern, when he nam’d a Dutch Ship, and said *0 
me. Sir you needbe under no Apprehensionsof the Dutch, 

I suppose they are not now at War with your Nation : No, 
says I, that’s true; but I know not what Liberties Men 



Farther Adventures of'R. obinson Crusoe 133 

may take when they are out of the Reach of the Law :Why, 
says ht^you are no Pirates, what need you fear? They will 
not meddle with peaceable Merchants sure. 

If I had any Blood in my Body that did not fly up intov 
my Face at that Word, it was hinder’d by some Stop in 
the Vessels, appointed by Nature to prevent it; for it put 
me into the greater Disorder and Confusion imaginable : 
Nor was it possible for me to conceal it so, but that the old 
Man easily perceiv’d it. 

Sir, says he, I find you are in some Disorder in your 
Thoughts at my Talk, pray be pleas’d to go which Way 
.you think fit, and depend upon it. I’ll do you all the Ser- 
vice I can. Why, Seignior, said I, it is true I am a little un- 
settled in my Resolution at this Time whither to go in 
particular; and I am something more so, for what you 
said about Pirates, I hope there are no Pirates in these 
Seas ; we are but in an ill Condition to meet with them, for 
you see we have but a small Force, and but very weakly 
mann’d. 

O Sir, says he, do not be concern’d, I do not know that 
there has been anyPirates in these Seas these fifteen Years, 
except one which was seen, as I hear, in the Bay of Siam, 
about a Month since ; but you may be assured she is gone 
to the Southward; nor was she a Ship of any great Force, 
or fit for the Work ; she was not built for a Privateer, but 
was run away with by a reprobate Crew that were on 
Board, after the Captain and some of his Men had been 
Tmxti)\tr'd.hyt)itMalayans, at or near the Island of Su- 
matra. 

What ! S A I D I , seeming to know nothing of the Matter, 
didtheymurtherthe Captain? No, said he, I do notunder- 
ftand that they murther’d him; but as they afterwards 
run away with the Ship, it is generally believ’d they be- 



134 Farther Adventures o/RobinsonCrusoe. 

tray’d him into the Hands of the Malayans.^ who did mur- 
ther him, and perhaps they procur’d them to do it: Why 
then, said /, they deserve Death as much as if they had 
done it themselves : Nay, says the old Man^ they do deserve 
it, and they will certainly have it, if they light upon any 
English or Dutch Ship ; for they have all agreed together, 
that if they meet that Rogue, they will give him noQuarter. 

But, said I to hinif you say the Pirate is gone out of 
those Seas, how can they meet with him? Why, that is 
true, says he, they do say so; but he was, as I tell you, in 
the Bay of Siam^ in the River Cambodia^ and was discover- 
ed there by some Dutch Men who belonged to the Ship, 
and who were left on Shore when they run away with her ; 
and some English and Dutch Traders being in the River, 
they were within a little of taking him ; Nay, said he, if the 
foremost Boats had been well seconded by the re^f, they 
had certainly taken him; but he finding only two Boats 
within Reach of him, tack’d about, and fir’d at these two, 
and disabled them before the other came up, and then 
landing off to Sea, the other were not able to follow him, 
and so he got away : But they have all so exaft a Descrip- 
tion of the Ship, that they will be sure to know him; and 
where-ever they find him, they have vow’d to give no 
Quarter to either the Captain, or the Seamen, but to hang 
them all up at the Yard-Arm. 

What! says I, will they execute them right or wrong, 
hang them fir^, and judge them afterwards? O Sir! says 
the old Pilot, there’s no Need to make a formal Business 
of it with such Rogues as those, let them tye them Back 
to Back, and set them a diving; ’tis no more than tliey 
richly deserve. 

I knew I had my old Man fail aboard, and that he 
could do me no Harm, so that I turn’d short upon him; 



Farther Adventures 0/ Robinson Crusoe 135 

Well now, Seignior, said I, and this is the very Reason, 
why I would have you carry us up to Nanquin, and not to 
put back to Macao ^ or to any other part of the Country, 
where the English or Dutch Ships come; for be it known 
to you. Seignior, those Captains of the English and Dutch 
Ships, are a Parcel of rash, proud, insolent Fellows, that 
neither knows what belongs to Juftice, nor how to behave 
themselves, as the Laws of God and Nature direft; but 
being proud of their Offices, and not undet^landing their 
Power, they would aft the Murtherers to punish Rob- 
bers ; would take upon them to insult Men falsely accus- 
ed, and determine them guilty without due Enquiry ; and 
perhaps I may live to call some of them to an Account for 
it, where they may be taught how Juftice is to be exe- 
cuted, and that no Man ought to be treated as a Criminal, 
’till some Evidence may be had of the Crime, and that he 
is the Man. 

With this I told him, that this was the very Ship they 
attack’d, and gave him a full Account of the Skirmish we 
had with their Boats, and how foolishly and coward-like 
they behav’d. I told him all the Story of our buying the 
Ship, and how the Dutch Men served us. I told him the 
Reasons I had to believe that this Story of killing the 
Mafter by the Malayans was true; as also the running 
away with the Ship; but that it was all a Fiftion of their 
own, to suggeft that the Men were turn’d Pirates\ and 
they ought to have been.sure it was so, before they had 
ventur’d to attack us by Surprize, and oblige us to resift 
them; adding that they would have the Blood of those 
Men, who we kill’d there in our juft Defence, to an- 
swer for. 

The old Man was amaz’d at this Relation, and told us, 
we were very much in the Right to go away to the North, 



136 Farther Adventures o/RobinsonCrusoe 
and that if he might advise us, it should be to sell the Ship 
in China, which we might very well do, and buy or build 
another in the Country ; and, said he, though you will not 
get so good a Ship, yet you may get one able enough to 
carry you and all your Goods back again to Bengale, or 
any where else. 

I told him, 1 would take his Advice, when I came to 
any Port where I could find a Ship for my Turn, or get 
any Cu^omer tp buy this : He reply’d, I should meet with 
Customers enough for the Ship at Nanquin, and that a 
Chinese Jonk would serve me very well to go back again ; 
and that he would procure me People, both to buy one- 
and sell the other. 

Well, but Seignior, says I, as you say they know the 
Ship so well, I may perhaps, if I follow your Measures, be 
instrumental to bring some honeSl innocent Men into a 
terrible Broil, and perhaps to be murther’d in cold Blood; 
for wherever they find the Ship, they will prove the Guilt 
upon the Men, by proving this was the Ship, and so inno- 
cent Men may probably be overpower’d and murther’d : 
Why, says the old Man, I’ll findoutaWaytopreventthat 
also; for as I know all those Commanders you speak of 
very well, and shall see them all as they pass by, I will be 
sure to set them to Rights in the Thing, and let them 
know that they had been so much in the Wrong ; that tho’ 
the People, who were on board at firSl, might run awa^ 
with the Ship, yet it was not true,that they had turned Pi- 
rates; and that in particular, these were not the Men that 
firSl went off with the Sh ip, but innocently bought her for 
their Trade ; and I am persuaded they will so far believe 
me, as at leail to aft morecautiouslyfortheTimetocome. 
Well, says I, And will you deliver one Message to them 
from me? Y es, I will, says he, if you will give it under your 



Farther Adventures 0/ Robinson Crusoe 137 
Hand in Writing, that I may be able to prove, that it 
came from you, and not out of my own Head. I answered, 
That I would readily give it him under my Hand; so I 
took a Pen, and Ink, and Paper, and wrote at large the 
Story of assaulting me with the Long-Boats, f5?c. the pre- 
tended Reason of it, and the unjuft cruel Design of it;and 
concluded to the Commanders, that they had done what 
they not only should ha’ been asham’d of, but also, that if 
ever they came to England^ and I liv’d to spe them there, 
they should all pay dearly for it, if the Laws of my Coun- 
try were not grown out of Use before I arrived there. 

My old Pilot read this over and over again, and ask’d 
me several Times if I would stand to it } I answer’d, 
I would stand to it as long as I had any Thing left in the 
World, being sensible that I should one Time or other 
find an Opportunity to put it home to them: But we had 
no Occasion ever to let the Pilot carry this Letter ; for he 
never went back again : While those Things were passing 
between us, by Way of Discourse, we went forward, di- 
reftly for Nanquin, and in about thirteen Days Sail came 
to an Anchor at the South-Weft Point of the great Gulph 
of Nanquin, where, by the Way, I came by Accident to 
underftand, that two Dutch Ships were gone the length 
before me, andthat I should certainlyfall intotheirHands ; 
I consulted my Partner again in this Exigency, and he 
was as much at a Loss as I was, and wouldverygladly have 
been safe on Shore almoft any where ; however, I was not 
in such Perplexity neither, but I ask’d the old Pilot, if 
there was no Creek or Harbour, which I might put into, 
and pursue my Business with the Chinese privately, and 
be in no Danger of the Enemy : he told me, if I would sail 
to the Southward about two and forty Leagues, there was^ 
a little Port call’d Quinchang, where the Fathers of the 



138 Farther Adventures of so Vi Crusoe 

Mission usually landed from Macao, on their Progress to 
teach the Chrillian Religion to the Chineses, and where 
no European Ships ever put in ; and if I thought to put in 
there, I might consider what farther Course to take when 
I was on Shore : He confess’d, he said, it was not a Place 
for Merchants, except that at some certain Times, they 
had a Kind of a Fair there, when the Merchants from Ja- 
pan came over to buy the Chinese Merchandizes. 

We all agreed to go back to this Place ; the Name of the 
Port, as he call’d it, I may perhaps spell wrong; for I do 
not particularly remember it, having lo^l this, together 
with the Names of many other Places, set down in a little 
Pocket-Book, which was spoil’d by the Water, on an Ac- 
cident, which I shall relate in its Order ; but this I remem- 
ber, that the Chinese, or Japanese Merchants we corre- 
sponded with, call’d it by a differing Name from that 
which our Portuguese Pilot gave it, and pronounc’d it as 
above, Quinchang. 

As we were unanimous in our Resolutions to go to 
this Place, we weigh’d the next Day, having only gone 
twice on Shore, where we were to get fresh Water; on 
both which Occasions, the People of the Country were 
very civil to us, and brought us abundance of Things to 
sell to us\ I mean, of Provisions, Plants, Roots, Tea, Rice, 
and some Fowls; but nothing without Money. 

We came to the other Port, (the Wind being contrary) 
not till five Days, but it was v^ry much to our Satisfac- 
tion ; and I was joyful, and I may say, thankful, when I set 
my Foot safe on Shore; resolving, and my Partner too, 
that if it was possible to dispose of our selves and Effefts, • 
any other Way, tho’ not every Way to our Satisfaftion, 
we would never set one Foot on board that unhappy Ves- 
sel more ; and indeed I mu^f acknowledge, that of all the 



Farther Adventures <?/ Robinson Crusoe 139 

Circumftances of Life, that ever I had any Experience of, 
nothing makes Mankinds© cdmpleatlymiserable, as that, 
of being in con^ant Fear: Well does the Scripture say, 
the Fear of Man brings a Snare \ it is a Life of Death, and 
the Mind is so entirely suppress’d by it, that it is capable 
of no Relief; the animal Spirits sink, and all the Vigour 
of nature, which usually supports Men under other Af- 
flidl:ions,andispresenttothem in the greater Exigencies, 
fails them here. , 

Nor did it fail of its usual Operations upon the Fancy, 
by heightening every Danger, representing the English 
andDa/ci)Captains,to be Men uncapable of hearing Rea- 
son, or of di^inguishing between hone^ Men and Ro- 
gues; or between a Story calculated for our own Turn, 
made out of nothing, on Purpose to deceive; and a true 
genuine Account of our whole Voyage, Progress, and 
Design; for we might many Ways have convinc’d any 
reasonable Creature, that we were not Pirates ; the Goods 
we had on board, the Course we steer’d, our frankly shew- 
ing our selves, and entring into such and such Ports ; and 
even our very Manner, the Force we had, the Number of 
Men, thefew Arms, little Ammunition, short Provisions ; 
all these would have serv’d to convince any Men, that we 
were no Pirates ; the Opium, and other Goods we had on 
board, would make it appear, the Ship had been at Ben- 
galee the Dutch Men, who it was said, had the Names of 
all the Men that was in tjie Ship, might easily see that we 
were a Mixture of English, Portuguese, and Indians, and 
but two Dutch Men on board: These, and many other 
particular Circumstances, might have made it evident to 
the Understanding of any Commander, whose Hands we 
might fall into, that we were no Pirates. , 

But Fear, that blind useless Passion, work’d another 



1 40 Farther Adventures 0/ Robinson Crusoe 

Way, and threw us into the Vapours; it bewildred our 
Understandings, and set the Imagination at Work, to 
form a thousand terrible Things, that perhaps might 
never happen ; we firSt suppos’d, as indeed every Body had 
related to us, that the Seamen on board the English and 
Z)arfi>6hips, but especially the Dutch, were so enraged at 
the Name of a Pirate, andespecially at our beating of their 
Boats, and escaping, that they would not give themselves 
leave to enquir^e, whether we were Pirates or no; but 
would execute us off Hand, as we call it, without giving 
us any Room for a Defence; we reflefted that there was 
really so much apparent Evidence before them, that they 
would scarce enquire after any more; as firSl, That the 
Ship was certainly the same, and that some of the Seamen 
among them knew her, and had been on board her ; and 
secondly. That when we had Intelligence at the River of 
Cambodia, that they were coming down to examine us, we 
fought their Boat and fled ; so that we made no doubt but 
they were fully satisfy’d of our being Pirates, as we were 
satisfy’d of the contrary; and as I often said, I know not 
but I should have been apt to have taken those Circum- 
ilances for Evidence, if the Tables were turn’d, and my 
Case was theirs, and have made no Scruple of cutting all 
the Crew to Pieces, without believing, or perhaps con- 
sidering, what they might have to offer in their Defence. 

Bui let that be how it will, those were our Apprehen- 
sions ; and both my Partner and I.too, scarcesleptaNight, 
without dreaming of Halters, and Yard-Arms; that is to 
say, Gibbets, of fighting, and being taken ; of killing and 
being kill’d; and one Night I was in such a Fury in my 
Dream, fancying the Dutch Men had boarded us, and I 
was knocking one of their Seamen down, that I^ruckmy 
double Fift against the Side of the Cabin I lay in, with 



FartherAdventuresof^oh\'K 5 0if Crusoe 141 

such a Force,’ as wounded my Hand mo^l grievously, 
broke my Knuckles, and cu< and bruised the Flesh; so 
that it not only wak’d me out of my Sleep, but I was once 
afraid I should have lo^l two of my Fingers. 

Another Apprehension I had, was of the cruel Usage 
we might meet with from them, ifwefell into their Hands ; 
then the Story of Amhoyna came into my Head, and how 
the Dutch, might perhaps torture us, as they did our 
Countrymen there ; and make some of our Men, by Ex- 
tremity of Torture, confess those Crimes they never were 
guilty of; own themselves, and all of us to be Pirates, and 
so they would put us to Death, with a formal Appearance 
of Ju^ice ; and that they might be tempted to do this, for 
the Gain of our Ship and Cargo, which was worth four or 
five thousand Pound, put altogether. 

These Things tormented me and my Partner too. 
Night and Day; nor did we consider that the Captains of 
Ships have no Authority to aft thus ; and if we had sur- 
render’d Prisoners to them, they could not answerthede- 
ftroying us, or torturing us, but wouldbe accountablefor 
it, when they came into their own Country : This I say, 
gave me no Satisfaftion ; for if they will aft thus with us, 
what Advantagewoulditbe to us, thatthey wouldbecall’d 
to an Account for it ; or if we were firft to be murthered, 
what Satisfaftion would it be to us to have them punish’d 
when they came Home? 

I cannot refrain taking Notice here, what Refleftions I 
now had upon the paft Variety of my particular Circum- 
ftances ; how hard I thought it was, that I who had spent 
forty Years in a Life of continu’d Difficulties, and was at 
laft come as it were to the Port or Haven, which all Men 
drive at, (viz.) to have Reft andPlenty, shouldbea Volun- 
tier in new Sorrows, by my own unhappy Choice; and 



142 Farther Adventures oj 'Rozi Vi son Crusoe 

that I, whoescaped so many Dangers inm^ Youth, should 
now come to be hang’d in ipy old Age, and in so remote a 
Place, for a Crime I was not in the lea^ inclin’d to, much 
less really guilty of; and in a Place and Circumftance, 
where Innocence was not like to be any Protection at all 
to me. 

After these Thoughts, something of Religion would 
come in ; and I should be considering, that this seem’d to 
me to be a Disposition of immediate Providence, and I 
ought to look upon it, and submit to it as such ; that al- 
though I was innocent as to Men, I was far from being 
innocent as to my Maker; and I ought to look in and ex- 
amine, what other Crimes in my Life, were moft obvious 
to me; and for which, Providence might ju^ly inflift 
this Punishment, as a Retribution ; and that I ought to 
submit to thisjju^ asl would to a Ship-wreck, if it had 
pleased God to have brought such a Disa^er upon 
me. 

In its Turn, Natural Courage would sometimes take 
its Place ; and then I would betalking my self up to vigor- 
ous Resolutions, that I would not be taken, to be bar- 
barously used by a Parcel of mercyless Wretches, in cold 
Blood; that it were much better to have fallen into the 
Hands of the Savages, who were Man-Eaters, and who,I 
was sure, would feaft upon me, when they had taken me ; 
than by those, who would perhaps glut their Rage upon 
me, by inhuman Tortures and Barbarities; that in the 
Case of the Savages, I always rCsolv’d to die fighting, to 
the laCl Gasp; and why should I not do so, seeing it was 
much more dreadful to me at lea§I, to think of falling into , 
these Mens Hands, than ever it was to think of being 
eaten by Men; for the Savages, give them their due, 
would not eat a Man till he was dead, and kill’d them firCI, 



Farther Adventures o/RobinsonCrusoe 143 

as we do a Bullock; but that these Men had many Arts 
beyond the Cruelty of Death : JVhen ever these Thoughts 
prevail’d, I was sure to putmy self in a kind of Fever, with 
the Agitations of a supposedFight ; my Blood would boil, 
and my Eyes sparkle, as if I was engag’d; and I always 
resolv’d that I would take no Quarter at their Hands ; but 
even at laft, if I could resi^ no longer, I would blow up 
the Ship and all that was in her, and leave them but little 
Booty to boa^l of. 

By how much the greater Weight, the'Anxieties and 
Perplexities of these Things were to our Thoughts while 
we were at Sea, by so much the greater was our Satisfac- 
tion, when we saw our selves on Shore ; and my Partner 
told me he dream’d, that he had a very heavy Load upon 
his Back, which he was to carry up a Hill, and found that 
he was not able to iland long under it ; but that the Portu- 
guese Pilot came and took it oflFhis Back, and the Hill dis- 
appear’d, the Ground before him shewing all smooth and 
plain, and truly it was so, we were all like Men, who had 
a Load taken off their Backs. 

For my Part, I had a Weight taken off from my Heart, 
that I was not able any longer to bear ; and as I said above, 
we resolv’d to go no more to Sea in that Ship : When we 
came on Shore, the old Pilot, who was now our Friend, 
gotusaLodging and a Ware-House for our Goods, which 
by the Way, was much the same ; it was a little House or 
Hut, with alarge House joyning to it, all built with Canes, 
and pallisadoed round with large Canes, to keep out pil- 
fering Thieves, of which, it seems there were not a few in 
that Country ; however, the Magistrates allowed us also a 
little Guard, and we had a Sentinel with a kind of Hal- 
berd, or Half-pike, who Stood Sentinel at our Door; to 
whom we allow’d a Pint of Rice, and a little Piece of Mo^ 



144 Farther Adventures obinsonCrusoe 

ney, about the Value of three 'Pence per Day, so that oUr 
Goods were kept very safjp. 

The Fair or Mart, usually kept in this Place, had been 
over some Time ; however, we found that there werethree 
or four Jonks in the River, and two Japanners^ I mean, 
Ships from Jappan^ with Goods which they had bought 
in China, and were not gone away, having Japponese Mer- 
chants on Shore. 

The firft Thing our old Portuguese Pilot did for us, was 
to bring us a'Cquainted with three Missionary Romish 
Prices, who were in the Town, and who had been there 
some Time, converting the People to Chri^ianity; but 
we thought they made but poor Work of it, and made ' 
them but sorry Chriftians when they had done ; however, 
that was none of our Business : One of these was a French 
Man, who they call’d Father Simon-, he was a jolly well 
condition’d Man, veryfreeinhis Conversation, not seem- 
ingsoserious and grave, as the other two did ; one of whom 
was a Portuguese, and the other a Genoese-, but Father 
Simon was courteous, easy in his Manner, and very agree- 
able Company ; the other two were more reserv’d, seem’d 
rigid and au^ere, and apply ’d seriously to the Work they 
came about, (wz.) to talk with, and insinuate themselves 
among the Inhabitants, where-ever they had Opportuni- 
ty; we often eat and drank with those Men, and tho’ I 
rnu^I confess, the Conversion as they call it, of the Chineses 
to Chriftianity, is so far from the true Conversion re- 
quir’d, to bring Heathen PeojSle to the Faith of Christ, 
that it seems to amount to little more, than letting them 
know the Name of Chrift, and say some Prayers to the 
Virgin Mary, and her Son, in a Tongue which they un- 
derlland not, and to cross themselves and the like ; yet it 
mu^ be confess’d; that these Religious, who we call Mis- 



Farther Adventures o/Robinson Crusoe 145 

sionaries, have a firm Belief that these People shall be 
sav’d, and that theyaretheinftrumentsof it;andonthis 
Account, they undergo not only the Fatigue of the Voy- 
age, and Hazards of living in such Places, but oftentimes 
Death it self, with the molt violent Tortures, for the Sake 
of this Work ; and it would be a great Want of Charity in 
us, whatever Opinion we have of the Work it self, and the 
Manner of their doing it, if we should not have a good 
Opinion of their Zeal, who undertook it with so many 
Hazards, and who have no Prospedl of tAe leadf Tem- 
poral Advantage to themselves. 

But to return to my Story; this French Prie^, Father 
Simon, was appointed it seems, by Order of the Chief of 
the Mission, to go up to Peking, the Royal Seat of the 
Chinese Emperor, and waited only for another Priest, 
who was order’d to come to him from Macao, to go along 
with him ; and we scarce ever met together, but he was 
inviting me to go that Journey, telling me, how he would 
shew me all the glorious Things of that mighty Empire ;

said he, that your London and our Paris put together,can- 
not be equal to : This was the City of Peking, which I con- 
fess is very great, and infinitely full of People ; but as I 
look’d on those Things with different Eyes from other 
Men, so I shall give my Opinion of them in few Words, 
when I come in the Course of my Travels, to speak more 
particularly of them. 

But fir^l, I come to my Fryar or Missionary; dining 
with him one Day, and being very merry together, I 
shew’d some little Inclination to go with him, and he 
press’d me and my Partner very hard, and with a great 
many Perswasions to consent; why Father Simon, says, 
my Partner, why should you desire our Company so

much : You know we are Hereticks, and you do not love 
us, nor cannot keep us Crmpany with any Pleasure? O! 
says he, You may perhaps be good Catholicks in Time; 
my Business here is to convert Heathens, and who knows 
but I may convert you too. Very well. Father, said I, so 
you^will preach to us all the Way ; I won’t be troublesome 
to you, says he ; our Religion does not divert us of good 
Manners ; besides, says he, we are here like Countrymen, 
and so we are, compared to the Place we are in ; and if you 
are Hugonots, and I a Catholick, we maybe all Chriilians 
at la^ ; at lea^, said he, we are all Gentlemen, and we may 
converse so, without being uneasy to one another. I lik’d , 
that Part of his Discourse very well, and it began to put 
me in Mind of my Prie^, that I had left in the Brasils ; but 
this Father Simon did not come up to his Charadler, by a 
great deal ; for tho’ Father Simon had no Appearance of a 
Criminal Levity in him neither, yet he had not that Fund 
of Chriftian Zeal, ^rift Piety, and sincere AfFedtion to 
Religion, that my other good Ecclesiailick had, of whom 
I have said so much. 

But to leave him a little, tho’ he never left us, nor soli- 
citing us to go with him ; but we had somethingelsebefore 
us at firft ; for we had all this while our Ship,and our Mer- 
chandize to dispose of, and we began to be very doubtful 
what we should do, for we were now in a Place of very lit- 
tle Business; and once I was about to venture to sail for 
the River of Kilam, and the City of Nanquin: But Provi- 
dence seem’d now more visibly as I thought, than ever, to 
concern itself in our Affair; and I was encouraged from 
this very Time, to think, I should one Way or other get 
out of this tangled Circum^ance, and be brought Home 
. to my own Country again, tho’ I had not the leaft View of 
the Manner: and when I began sometimes to think of it, 



Farther Adventures 0/ Robinson Crusoe 147 

could not imagine by what Method it was to be done: 
Providence, I say ^ began here to clear up our Way a little ; 
and the firft Thing that offered was, that our old Portu- 
guese Pilot brought a Japan Merchant to us, who began 
to enquire what Goods we had ; and in the fir^ Place, he 
bought all our Opium, and gave us a very good Pride for 
it, paying us in Gold by Weight, some in small Pieces of 
their own Coin, and some in small Wedges, of about ten 
or eleven Ounces each. While we were dealing with him 
for our Opium, it came into my Head, that he might per- 
haps deal with us for the Ship too, and I ordered the In- 
terpreter to propose ittohim ; he shrunk up his Shoulders 
at it, when it was fir^t propos’d to him ; but in a few Days 
after, he came to me with one of the missionary Prie^s 
for his Interpreter,andtoldme, he had a Proposal to make 
to me, and that was this ; he had bought a great Quantity 
of Goods of us, when he had no Thoughts (or Proposals 
made to him) of buying the Ship ; and that therefore, he 
had not Money enough to payfor the Ship ; but if I would 
let the same Men who were in the Ship navigate her, he 
would hire the Ship to go to Japan^ and would send them 
from thence to the Philippine Islands with another Load- 
ing, which he would pay the Freight of, before they went 
from Japan ; and that at their Return, he would buy the 
Ship : I began to liilen to his Proposal, and so eager did 
my Head llill run upon Rambling, that I could not but 
begin to entertain a Notion of going my self with him, 
andsotosailfromtheP/6i/</)p/«eIslands,awayto the South 
Seas ; and accordingly I ask’d the Japanese Merchant, if 
he would not hire us to the Philippine Islands, and dis- 
charge us there ; he said, no he could not do that, for then 
he could not have the return of his Cargo ; but he would • 
discharge us in Japan., he said, atthe Ship’s Return. Well, 



148 Farther Adventures <j/RobinsonCrusoe 

^lill I was for taking him at that Proposal, and going my 
self; but my Partner, wis&: than my self, persuaded me 
from it, representing the Dangers as well of the Seas, as 
of the Japaneses^vtho are a false, cruel, and treacherous 
People; and then of the Spaniards, at the Philippines, 
more false, more cruel, and more treacherous than 
they. 

But to bring this long Turn of our Affairs to a Conclu- 
sion ; the firft Thing we had to do, was to consult with the 
Captain of the Ship, and with his Men, and know if they 
were willing to go to Japan\ and while I was doing this, 
the young Man, who, as I said, my Nephew had left with 
me as my Companion for my Travels, came to me, and 
told me, that he thought that Voyage promised very fair, 
and that there was a great Prospedl of Advantage, and he 
would be very glad if I undertook it ; but that if I would 
not, and would give him leave, he would go as a Mer- 
chant, or how I pleas’d to order him ; that if ever he came 
to England, and I was there and alive, he would render me 
afaithful Accountofhis Success, anditshouldbeasmuch 
mine as I pleas’d. 

I was really loth to part with him, but considering the 
Prospedl: of Advantage which was really considerable, 
and that he was a young Fellow, as likely to do well in it, 
as any I knew, I inclin’d to let him go ; but fir^l I told him, 
I would consult my Partner, and give him an Answer the 
next Day ; my Partner and I discours’d about it, and my 
Partner made a mo^l generous Offer; he told me, you 
know it has been an unlucky Ship, and we both resolve 
not to go to Sea in it again ; if your Steward, so he call’d mp 
Man, will ventxure the Voyage, I’ll leave my Share of the 
* Vessel to him, and let him make his be^f of it; and if we 
live to meet in England, and hemee(;s with Successabroad, 



Farther Adventures 0/ Robinson Crusoe 149 

he shall account for one Half of the Profits of the Ship’s 
Freight to us, the other shall, be his own. 

If my Partner, who was no Way concerned with my 
young Man, made him such an Offer, I could do no less 
than offer him the same ; and all the Ship’s Company be- 
ing willing to go with him, we made over Half the Ship to 
him in Property, and.took a Writing from him, obliging 
him to account for the other, and away he went to Japan: 
The Japan Merchant prov’d a very punftual hone^Man 
to him, protefted him at Japan, and got Mm a License to 
come on Shore, which the Europeans in general have not 
lately obtained ; pay’d him his Freight very pundually, 
sent him to the Philippines, loaded with Japan, and China 
Wares, and a Supra-Cargo of their own, who trafficking 
with the Spaniards, brought back European Goods again, 
and a great Quantity of Cloves, and other Spice ; and there 
he was not only pay’d his Freight very well, and at a very 
good Price, but being not willing to sell the Ship then, the 
Merchantfurnish’dhim with Goods,onhisown Account; 
that for some Money, and some Spices of his own, which 
he brought with him, he went back to the Manillas to the 
Spaniards, where he sold his Cargo very well : Here hav- 
ing gotten a good Acquaintance at Manilla, he got his 
Ship made a free Ship ; and the Governor of Manilla hired 
him, to go to Accapulco, in America,on theCoa^tofMmVo, 
and gave him a License to Land there, and travel to Mexi- 
co, and to pass in any Spanish Ship to Europe, with all his 
Men. 

He made the Voyage to Accapulco very happily, and 
there he sold his Ship ; and having there also obtained Al- 
lowance to travel by Land, to Porto Bello, he found Means 
some how or other, to get to Jamaica, with all his Trea^ 
sure; and about eight Years after, came to England ex-

ceeding Rich; of thf which, I shall take Notice in its 
Place; in the mean Time, i return to our particular Af- 
fairs. 

Being now to part with the Ship, and Ship’s Company ; 
itcame beforeus of Course, to consider what Recom pence 
we should give to the two Men, that gave us such timely 
Notice of the Design against us in the River of Cambodia: 
The Truth was, they had done us a considerable Service, 
and deserv’d well at our Hands ; tho’ by the Way^ they 
wereaCoupleof Rogues too ;for as they believ’d the Story 
of our being Pirates, and that we had really run away 
with the Ship, they came down to us, not only to betray 
the Design that was form’d againft us, but to go to Sea 
with us as Pirates ; and one of them confess’d afterwards, 
that nothing else but the Hopes of going a Roguing 
brought him to do it; however, the Service they did us 
was not the less; and therefore, as I had promis’d to be 
grateful to them, I fir^ order’d the Money to be pay’d to 
them, which they said was due to them on board their re- 
spective Ships ; that is to say, the English Man nineteen 
Months Pay, and to the Dutch Man seven ; and over and 
above that, I gave them, each of them, a small Sum of 
Money in Gold, and which contented them very well ; 
then I made the English Man Gunner in the Ship, the 
Gunner being now made Second Mate, and Purser ; the 
Dutch Man I made Boatswain ; so they were both very 
well pleas’d, and prov’d very serviceable, being both able 
Seamen, and very Clout Fellows. 

We were now on Shore in China \ if I thought myself 
banish’d, and remote from my own Country at Bengaky ^ 
where I had many Ways to get home for my Money; 
what could I think of my self now.^ When I was gotten 
about a thousand Leagues farther off from home, and 



■Farther Adventures o/RobinsonCrusoe 151 
perfeftly de^itute of all manner of Prospeft of Re- 
turn. « 

All we had for it was this, that in about four Months 
Time, there was to be another Fair at the Place where we 
were; and then we might be able to purchase all sorts of 
the Manufaftures of the Country, and withal, might>pos- 
sibly find some Chinee Jonks or Vessels from Aonquin, 
that would be to be sold, and would carry us and our 
Goods, whither we pleas’d; this I lik’d very well, and re- 
solv’d to wait ; besides, as our particular Persons were not 
obnoxious, so if any English or Dutch Ships came thither, 
perhaps we might have anOpportunity to load our Goods, 
and get Passage to some other Place in India, nearer 
Home. 

Upon these Hopes we resolv’d to continue here; but 
to divert our selves, we took two or three Journeys into 
the Country; fir^t we went ten Days Journey to see the 
City of Nanquin, and a City well worth seeing indeed; 
they say it has a Million of People in it ; which however, I 
do not believe. It is regularly built, the Streets all exaftly 
ftrait, and cross one another, in direft Lines, which gives 
the Figure of it great Advantage. 

But when I come to compare the miserable People of 
these Countries with ours, their Fabricks, their manner 
ofLiving, their Government,theirReligion,their Wealth, 
and their Glory, (as some call it) I muft confess, I do not 
so much as think it is worth naming, or worth my whileto 
write of, or any that shall come after me to read. 

It is very observable that we wonder at the Grandeur, 
the Riches, the Pomp, the Ceremonies, the Government, 
the Manufactures, the Commerce, and the ConduCl of 
these People; not that it is to be wonder’d at, or indeed 
in the lead to be regarded ; but because, having fird a 



1 52 Farther Adventures ofR obinson Crusoe 

true Notion of the Barbarity ofthose Countries, the Rude- 
ness and the Ignorance th^t prevails there, we do not ex- 
peft to find any such Things so far off. 

Otherwise, what are their Buildings to the Palaces and 
Royal Buildings of Europe ? What their Trade, to the 
universal Commerce of England^ Holland^ France and 
What are their Citiestoours5for Wealth, Strength, 
Gaiety of Apparel, rich Furniture, and an infinite V ariety ? 
What are their Ports, supply’d with a few Jonks and 
Barks, to our Navigation, our Merchant Fleets, our large 
and powerful Navys? Our City of London has moreTrade 
than all their mighty Empire: One English^ or Dutcby or 
French Man of War of 80 Guns, would fight and destroy 
all the Shipping of China: But the Greatness of their 
Wealth, their Trade, the Power of their Government, and 
Strength of their Armies, is surprising to us, because, as I 
have said, considering them as a barbarous Nation of Pa- 
gans, little better than Savages, we did not expeft such 
Things among them ; and this indeed is the Advantage 
with which all their Greatness and Power is represented 
to us ; otherwise it is in it self nothing at all •, for as I have 
said of their Ships, so may be said of their Armies and 
Troops ; all the Forces of their Empire, tho’ they were to 
bring two Millions of Men into theFieldtogether, would 
, be able to do nothing but ruin the Country, and ^arve 
themselves: If they were to besiege a strong Town in 
Flanders, or to fight a disciplin’d Army, one Line of Ger- 
. man Curiassiers, or of French Cavalry, would overthrow 
all the Horse of China ; A Million of their Foot could not 
^and before one embattled Body of our Infantry, polled 
so as not to be surrounded, tho’ they were to be not One 
to Twenty in Number; nay, I do not boaft, if I say that 
30000 German or English Foot, and 1 0000 Frencbl^orsc, 



Farther Adventures <?/RobinsonCrusoe 153 

would fairly beat all the Forces of China: And so of our 
fortified Towns, and of the ^rt of our Engineers in as- 
saulting and defending Towns; there’s not a fortified 
Town in China^ could hold out one Month against the 
Batteries and Attacks of an European Army; and at the 
same time, all the Armies of China could never takp such 
a Town as Dunkirk, provided it was not Carv’d ; no, not in 
a ten Years Siege. They have Fire-Arms, ’tis true, but 
they are awkward, clumsy, and uncertain in going off: 
They have Powder, but it is of no Strer/gth : They have 
neither Discipline in the Field, Exercise to their Arms, 
Skill to attack, or Temper to Retreat; and therefore, I 
muft confess, it seem’d strange to me, when I came home, 
and heard our People say such fine Things of the Power, 
Riches, Glory, Magnificence, and Trade of the Chinese', 
because I saw, and knew, that they were a contemptible 
Herd or Crowd of ignorant sordid Slaves, subjefted to a 
Government qualified only to rule such a People ; and in a 
word, for I am now launch’d quite beside my Design, I 
say, in a word, were not its Distance inconceivably great 
from Muscovy, and was not the Muscovite Empire almo^ 
as rude, impotent, and ill govern’d a Crowd of Slaves as 
they, the Czar of Muscovy might with much Ease drive 
them all out of their Country, and conquer them in one 
Campaign ; and had the Czar, who I since hear is a grow- 
ing Prince, and begins toappearformidablein the World, 
fallen this Way, initead of attacking the Warlike Swedes, 
in which Attempt none* of the Powers of Europe would 
have envy’d or interrupted him; he might by this time 
have been Emperor of China, instead of being beaten by 
the King of Sweden at Narva, when the latter was not 
One to Six in Number. As their Strength and their Gran- 
deur, so their Navigation, Commerce, and Husbandry * is 



1 54 Farther Adventures o/Robinson Crusoe 
imperfeft and impotent, compar’d to the same Things in 
Europe \ also in their Knowledge, their Learning, their 
Skill in the Sciences ; they have Globes and Spheres, and 
a Smatch of the Knowledge of the Mathematicks; but 
when you come to enquire into their Knowledge, how 
short-sighted are the wiseft of their Students ! they know 
nothing of the Motion of the Heavenly Bodies ; and so 
grossly absurdly ignorant, that when the Sun is eclips’d, 
they think ’tis a great Dragon has assaulted, and run away 
with it, and they fall a clattering with all the Drums and 
Kettles in the Country, to fright the Monger away, juft 
as we do to hive a Swarm of Bees. 

As this is the only Excursion of this kind which I have 
made in all the Account I have given of my Travels, so I 
shall make no more Descriptions of Countrys and Peo- 
ple, ’tis none of my Business, or any part of my Design ; 
but giving an Account of my own Adventures, through a 
Life of inimitable Wandrings, and a long Variety of 
Changes, which perhaps few that come after me will have 
heard the like of ; I shall therefore say very little of all the 
mighty Places, desart Countrys, and numerous People, I 
have yet to pass thro’ more than relates to my own Story, 
and which my Concern among them will make necessary. 
I was now, as near as I can compute, in the heart of China^ 
about the Latitude of thirty Degrees North of the Line, 
for we were return’d from Nanquin ; I had indeed a Mind 
to see the City of Peking^ which I had heard so much of, 
and Father Simon importun’d m*e daily to do it ; at length 
his Time of going away being set, and the other Mission- 
ary, who was to go with him, being arriv’d from Macao, it 
was necessary that we should resolve, either to go, or not 
to go ; so I referr’d him to my Partner, and left it wholly 
to his Choice, who at length resolv’d it in the Affirmative, 



Farther Adven^ures 0/ Robinson Crusoe 155 

and we prepar’d for our Journey. We set out with very 
good Advantage, as to findings the Way, for we got leave 
to travel in the Retinue of one of their Is'^'andarins, a kind 
of Viceroy, or principal Magistrate in theProvincewhere 
they reside, and who take great State upon them, travel- 
ling with great Attendance, and with great Homage, from 
the People, who are sometimes greatly impoverish’d by 
them, because all the Countries they passthro’areoblig’d 
to furnish Provisions for them and all their Attendance: 
That which I particularly observed, as t6 our travelling 
with his Baggage, was this, that tho’ we receiv’dsufficient 
Provisions, both for our selves and our Horses, from the 
Country, as belonging to the Mandarin, yet we were ob- 
lig’d to pay for every thing we had, after the MarketPrice 
of the Country, and the Mandarin’s Steward, or Com- 
missary of the Provisions, collefted it duly from us ; so 
that our travelling in the Retinue of the Mandarin, tho’ it 
was a very great Kindness to us, was not such a mighty 
Favour in him, but was indeed a great Advantage to him, 
considering there were above thirtyotherPeopletravell’d 
in the same Manner besides us, under the Protedlion of 
his Retinue, or as we may call it, under his Convoy : This, 
I say, was a great Advantage to him, for the Country fur- 
nish’d all the Provisions for nothing, and he took all our 
Money for them. 

We were five and twenty Days travelling to Peking, 
through a Country infinitely populous, butmiserably cul- 
tivated ; the Husbandry, the Oeconomy, and the Way of 
living miserable, tho’ they boaft so much of the Indus- 
try of the People ; I say, miserable ; and so it is, if we who 
underhand how to live were to endure it, or to compare it 
with our own, but not so to these poor Wretches w^o 
know no other: The Pride of these People is infinitely 



1 56 Farther Adventures ^Robinson Crusoe 

great, and exceeded by nothing, but their Poverty, which 
adds to that which I call their Misery ; and I mu^ needs 
think the naked Savages America live much more hap- 
py, because, as they have nothing, so they desire nothing ; 
whereas these are proud and insolent, and in the main are 
meer, Beggars and Drudges; their O^entation is inex- 
pressible, and is chiefly shew’d in th^ir Cloaths andBuild- 
ing, and in the keeping Multitudes of Servants or Slaves, 
and, which is to the laS Degree ridiculous, their Con- 
tempt of all the World but themselves. 

I muft confess, I travell’d more pleasantly afterwards 
in the Desarts and vaft Wildernesses of Grand 'F artary ^ 
than here ; and yet the Roads here are well pav’d, and well 
kept, and very convenient for Travellers; but nothing 
was more aukward to me, than to see such a haughty, im- 
perious, insolent People, in the mid^ of the grossest Sim- 
plicity and Ignorance, for all their fam’d Ingenuity is no 
more : And my Friend Father Simon and I, us’d to be very 
merry upon these Occasions, to see the beggarly Pride 
of those People ; for Example : Coming by the House of a 
Country Gentleman, as Father Simon call’d him, about 
ten Leagues oflF of the City of Namjuin, we had firft of all 
the Honour to ride with the Master of the House about 
two Miles : The State he rode in, wasaperfeftDon Quixot- 
ism, being a Mixture of Pomp and Poverty. 

The Habit of this greasy Don was very proper for a 
Scaramouch or Merry-Andrew, being a dirty Callicoe, 
with all the Tawdry and Trapping of a Fool’s-Coat, such 
as Hanging-sleeves, Tossels, and CutsandSlashesalmoif 
on every Side; it cover’d a TaflFety Veft, as greasy as a 
Butcher, and which teftify’d that his Honour mu^t needs 
be a mo^l exquisite Sloven. 

‘ His Horse was a poor, lean, Carv’d, hobbling Crea-

ture, such as in England might sell for about 30 or40 Shil- 
lings, and he had two Slavey follow’d him on Foot, to 
drive the poor Creaturealong ;hehad a Whipinhis Hand, 
and he belabour’d the Beaft as fa^t about the Head, as his 
Slaves did about the Tail, and thus he rode by us with 
about ten or twelve Servants, and we were told he was go- 
ing from the City to his Country Seat, about half a 
Leaguebeforeus: Wetravell’don gently, but this Figure 
of a Gentleman rode away before us, and as we topp’d at a 
Village about an Hour to refresh us, wheii we cameby the 
Country Seat of this^eat Man, we saw him in a little 
Place, before his Door, eating his Repail. It was a kind of 
a Garden, but he was easy to be seen, and we were given 
to underiiand that the more we look’d on him, the better 
he would be pleas’d. 

He sat under a Tree, something like the Palmetto 
Tree, which effeftually shaded him over the Head, and 
on the South Side, but under the Tree also, was plac’d a 
large Umbrello, which made that Part look well enough ; 
he sat lolling back in a great Elbow Chair, being a heavy 
corpulent Man, and his Meat being brought him by two 
Women Slaves; he had two more, whose Office, I think, 
few Gentlemen in Europe would accept of their Service 
in, {viz.) One fed the Squire with a Spoon, and the other 
held the Dish with one Hand, and scrap’d off what he let 
fall upon his Worship’s Beard and Taffaty Ve^, whilethe 

f reat fat Brute thought jt below him to employ his own 
lands in any of those familiar Offices, which Kings and 
Monarchs would rather do, than be troubled with the 
clumsy Fingers of their Servants. 

I took this Time to think what Pain Mens Pride puts 
them to; and how troublesome a haughty Temper, thps 
ill-manag’d, mudl be to a Man of common Sense; and 



158 Farther Adventures o/ R obinson Crusoe 

leaving the poor Wretch to please himself with our look- 
ing at him, as if we admir'cj his Pomp, whereas we really 
pity’d and contemn’d him, we persu’d our Journey ; only 
Father Simon had the Curiosity to ftay to inform himself 
what Dainties the Country Juftice had to feed on, in all 
his State, which he said he had the Honour to ta^e of,and 
which was, I think, a Dose that an EnglishYlonndL would 
scarce have eaten, if it had been offer’d him, (viz.) a Mess 
of boil’d Rice, with a great Piece of Garlick in it, and a lit- 
tle Bag fill’d with Green Pepper, and another Plantwhich 
they have there, something like our Ginger, but smelling 
like Musk, and taking like Mustard ; all this was put to- 
gether, and a small Lump or Piece of lean Mutton boil’d 
in it ; and this was his Worship’s Repast, four or five Ser- 
vants more attendingata Di^ance. If he fedthemmeaner 
than he was fed himself, the Spice excepted, they mu^ 
fare very coarsely indeed. 

As for our Mandarin, with whom we travell’d, he was 
respefted like a King; surrounded always with his Gen- 
tlemen, and attended in all his Appearances with such 
Pomp, that I saw little of him but at a Diftance ; but th is I 
observ’d, that there was not a Horse in his Retinue, but 
that our Carriers Pack-Horses in England seem to me to 
look much better, but they were so cover’d with Equi- 
page, Mantles, Trappings and such like Trumpery, that 
you cannot see whether they are fat or lean ; in a Word, we 
could see scarce any thing but their Feet and their Heads. 

I was now light-hearted, and all my Trouble and Per- 
plexity that I have given an Account of being over, Lhad 
no anxious Thoughts about me, which made this Journey 
the pleasanter to me, nor had I any ill Accident attended 
me, only in the passing or fording a small River, my 
rtorse fell, and made me free of the Country, as they call 



Farther Adventures 0/ Robinson Crusoe 159 

it, that is to say, threw me in ; the Place was not deep, but 
it wetted me all over; I mention it because it spoil’d my 
Pocket-Book, wherein I had set down the Names of seve- 
ral People and Places which I had Occasion toremember, 
and which, not taking due Care of, the Leaves rotted, and 
the Words were never after to be read, to my greatXoss, 
as to the Names of some Places I touch’datin this Voyage. 

At length we arriv’d at Peking\ I had no Body with me 
but the Youth, who my Nephew, the Captain, had given 
me to attend me as a Servant, and who proved very tru^y 
and diligent ; and my Partner had no Body with him but 
one Servant, who was a Kinsman : as for the Portuguese 
Pilot, he being desirous to see the Court, we gave him his 
Passage, that is to say, bore his Charges for his Company ; 
and to use him as an Interpreter, for he understood the 
Language of the Country, and spoke good French^ and a 
little English ; and indeed, this old Man was a moSl useful 
Impliment to us every where ; for we had not been above 
a Week at Peking, when he came laughing. Ah, Seignior 
Inglese, says he, I have something to tell you will make your 
Heart glad. My Heart glad,%‘xy% I, What can that be? I don't 
know any thing in this Country can either give me Joy or Grief 
to any great degree, Tes, yes, said the old Man in broken 
English, make you glad, me sorrow, sorry he would have 
said. This made me more inquisitive. Why, said I, will it 
make you sorry? Because, said he,yo« have brought me here 
25 days Journey, and will leave me to go back alone, and 
which way shall I get to my Port afterwards without a Ship, 
without a Horse, without Peccune.^ So he called Money, 
being his broken Latin, of which he had abundance to 
make us merry with. 

In short, he told us there was a great Caravan of Mus- 
covite and Polish Merchants in the City, and they were

preparing to set out on their Journey by Land to Muscovy 
within four or five Weeks, and he was sure we would take 
the Opportunity to go with them, and leave him behind 
to go back all alone. I confess, I was surpris’d with his 
News, a secret Joy spread it self over my whole Soul, 
which I cannot describe, and never felt before or since, 
and I had no power for a good while to speak a Word to 
the old Man ; but at la^l I turn’d to him ; How do you 
know this, said I, are you sure it is true.? Yes, says he, I 
met this Morning in the Street an old Acquaintance of 
mine, an Armenian^ or one you call a Grecian, who is 
among them ; he came la^ from A§lracan, and was design- 
ing to go to T onquin, where I formerly knew him, but has 
alter’d his Mind, and is now resolv’d to go with the Cara- 
van to Muscow, and so down the River Wolga to ASlracan. 
Well, Segnior, says I, do not be uneasy about being left 
to go back alone, if this be a Method for my return to 
England, it shall be your Fault if you go back to Macao at 
all. We then went to consulting together what was to be 
done, and I ask’d my Partner what he thought of the Pi- 
lot’s News, and whether it would suit with his Affairs? 
He told me he would do ju^ as I would, for he had settled 
all hisAffairsso well at Bengale,zr\6. left his Effeftsinsuch 
good Hands, that as we had made a good Voyage here, if 
he could ve^ it in China Silks, wrought and raw, such as 
might be worth the Carriage, he would be content to go 
to England, and then make his^ Voyage back to Bengale, 
by the Company’s Ships. 

Having resolv’d upon this, we agreed, that if our Por- 
tugal Pilot would go with us, we would bear his Chargfes 
to Muscoiv, or to England if he pleas’d ; nor indeed werewe 
tp be efteem’d over generous in that Part neither, if we 
had not rewarded him farther, for the Service he had done

us was really worth all that, and more ; for he had not on ly 
been a Pilot to us at Sea, but h^had been like a Broker for 
us on Shore; and his procuring for us the Japan Mer- 
chant, was some hundreds of Pounds in our Pocket : So 
we consulted together about it, and being willing to grati- 
fy him, which was indeed but doing him Justice, and Very 
willing also to have him with us besides, for he was a mo^ 
necessary Man on all Occasions, we agreed to give him a 
Quantity of coin’d Gold, which, as I compute it, came to 
about 175 Pounds Sterling between us, and to bear all his 
Charges, bothfor himself and Horse, except only a Horse 
to carry his Goods. 

Having settled this among our selves, we call’d him to 
let him know what we had resolv’d; I told him, he had 
complain’d of our being to let him go back alone, and I 
was now to tell him we was resolv’d he should not go 
back at all : that as we had resolv’d to go to Europe with 
the Caravan, we resolv’d also he should go with us, and 
thatwe call’d him, to know his Mind. HeshookhisHead, 
and said, it was a long Journey, and he had no Pecune to 
carry him thither, or to subsift himself when he came 
there. We told him, we believ’d it was so, and therefore 
we had resolv’d to do something for him, that should let 
him see how sensible we were of the Service he had done 
us, and also how agreeable he was to us; and then I told 
him what we had resolv’d to give him here, which he 
might lay out as we would (jo our own ; and that as for his 
Charges, if he would go with us, we would set him safe 
a-shore, (Life and Casualties excepted) either in Muscovy 
or England, which he would, at our own Charge, except 
only the Carriage of his Goods. 

He receiv’d the Proposal like a Man transported, and- 
told us he would go with us over the whole World; and

so, in short, we all prepar’d our selves for the Journey: 
However, as it was with u,s, so it was with the other Mer- 
chants, they had many things to do, and in^ead of being 
ready in five Weeks, it was four Months and some odd 
Days, before all Things were got together. 

It was the Beginning of February^ our Stile, when we 
set out from Peking\ my Partner and the old Pilot had 
gone express back to the Port where we had firft put in, to 
dispose of some Goods which we had left there ; and I 
with a Chinesi Merchant, who I had some Knowledge of 
at Nanquin, and who came to Peking on his own Affairs, 
went to Nanquin^ where I bought ninety Pieces of fine 
Damasks, with about two hundred Pieces of other very 
fine Silks, of several Sorts, some mix’d with Gold, and 
had all these brought to against my Partner’s Re- 
turn; besides this, we bought a very large Quantity of 
Raw Silk, and some other Goods, our Cargo amounting 
in these Goods only to about three thousand five hundred 
Pounds Sterling, which, together with Tea and some 
fine Callicoes, and three Camels Loads of Nutmegs and 
Cloves, loaded in all eighteen Camels for our Share, be- 
sides those we rode upon ; which with two or three spare 
Horses, and two Horses loaded with Provisions, made us 
in short 26 Camels and Horses in our Retinue. 

The Company was very great, and, as near as I can re- 
member, made between three and four hundred Horse, 
and upwards of a hundred ^nd twenty Men, very well 
armed and provided for all Events: for as the Eastern 
Caravans are subjeft to be attacked by the Arabs, so are 
these by the Tartars', but they are not altogether so dan- 
gerous as the Arabs, nor so barbarous when they prevail, 
r The Company consifted of People of several Nations, 
such as Muscovites chiefly, for there were above Sixty of 



Farther Adventures ^Robinson Crusoe 163 

them who were Merchants or Inhabitants of MoscoWy 
tho’ of them, some were Li%omanSy and to our particu- 
lar Satisfaftion, Five of them were Scots, who appeared 
also to be Men of great Experience in Business, and Men 
of very good Subftance. 

When we had travelled one Days Journey, the Gdides, 
who were Five in Number, called all the Gentlemen and 
Merchants, that is to say, all the Passengers, except the 
Servants, to a great Council, as they called it : Atthis great 
Council every one deposited a certain Quantity of Money 
to a common Stock, for the necessary Expence of buying 
Forage on the Way, where it was not otherwise to be had, 
and for satisfying the Guides, getting Horses, and the 
like: And here they constituted the Journey, as they call 
it, (viz.) They named Captains and Officers, to draw us 
all up, and give the Command in case of an Attack, and 
gave every onetheir turnof Command : nor was this form- 
ing us into Order any more than what we found needful 
upon the Way, as shall be observed in its Place. 

The Road all on this Side of the Country is very popu- 
lous, and is full of Potters and Earth-makers, that is to 
say. People that tamper’d the Earth for the China Ware ; 
and as I was coming along, our Portugal Pilot, who had 
always something or other to say to make us merry, came 
sneering to me, and told me he would show me the great- 
est Rarity in all the Country, and that I should have this 
to say of China, after all the ill-humour’d things I had 
said of it, that I had seen one thing which was not to be 
seen in all the World beside. I was very importunate to 
know what it was : At laSl he told me it was a Gentleman’s 
House built all with China Ware. Well, says I, are not the 
Materials of their Building the Produdl of their owir 
Country; and so it is all ChinaV^ztt, isitnot.? No no, says 



1 64 Farther Adventures o/RobinsonCrusoe 
he, 1 mean it is a House all made of China Ware, such as 
you call it in England \ or ^s it is call’d in our Country, 
Porcellain. Well, says I, such a thing may be; how big is 
it? Can we carry it in a Box upon a Camel ? If we can, we will 
buy it. Upon a Camel! says the old Pilot, holding up both 
his Hands, why there is a Family ojT hirty People lives in it. 

I was then curious indeed to see it, and when I came to 
it, it was nothing but this ; it was a Timber-House, or a 
House built, as we call it in England^ with Lath and 
Plainer, but al'i the Plaiftering was really China Ware, 
that is to say, it was plainer ’d with the Earth that makes 
China Ware. 

The Outside, which the Sun shone hot upon, was glaz- 
ed, and look’d very well, perfeft white, and painted with 
blue Figures, as the large China Ware in England's^ paint- 
ed, and hard,, as if it had been burnt : As to the Inside, all 
the Walls, instead of Wainscot, were lined up with har- 
den’d and painted Tiles, like the little square Tiles we 
call Galley-Tiles in England., all made of the finest China^ 
and the Figures exceeding fine indeed, with extraordin- 
ary Variety of Colours mix’d with Gold, many Tiles mak- 
ing but one Figure, but join’d so artificially, the Mortar 
being made of the same Earth, that it was very hard to see 
where the Tiles met : The Floors of the Rooms were of 
the same Composition, and as hard as the earthen Floors 
we have in use in several Parts of England, especially Lin- 
colnshire, Nottinghamshire, LeiceUer shire, &c. as hard as 
Stone, and smooth, but not burnt and painted, except 
some smaller Rooms, like Closets, which were all as it 
were paved with the same Tile; the Cielings, and in^ 
word, all the plaiilering Work in the whole House were 
of the same Earth ; and after all, the Roof was Covered 
with Tiles of the same, but of a deep shining black. 



Farther Adventures ^RobinsonCrusoe 165 

This was a C;W«<*-Warehouse indeed, truly and literal- 
ly to be call’d so ; and had I nj)t been upon the Journey, I 
could have ^aid some Days to see and examine the Par- 
ticulars of it : they told me there were Fountains and Fish- 
ponds in the Garden, all paved at the Bottom and Sides 
with the same, and fine Statues set up in Rows dh the 
Walks, entirely form*d of the Porcellain Earth, and burnt 
whole. 

As this is one of the Singularities of Cbina^ so they may 
be allow’d to excel in it; but I am very sdre they excel in 
their Accounts of it; for they told me such incredible 
things of their Performance in Crockery Warey for such it 
is, that I care not to relate, as knowing it could not be 
true; they told me in particular, of one Workman that 
made a Ship with all its Tackle, and Mafts, and Sails, in 
Earthen Ware, big enough to carry fifty Men : If he had 
told me he launched it, and made a Voyage to Japan in it, 
I might have said something to it indeed ; but as it was, I 
knew the whole of the Story, which was in short, asking 
Pardon for the Word, that the Fellow lyed; so I smiled, 
and said nothing to it. 

This odd Sight kept me two Hours behind the Cara- 
van, for which, the Leader of it for the Day, fined me 
about the Value of three Shillings, and told me, if it had 
been three Days Journey without the Wall, as it was three 
Days within, he mu^l have fined me four times as much, 
and made me ask Pardon the next Council Day ; so I pro- 
mised to be more orderly; for indeed I found afterward 
the Orders made for keeping all together, were absolutely 
necessary for our common Safe^. 

In two Days more, we pass’d the great China Wall, 
made for a Fortification againft the Tartars \ and a very 
great Work it is, going over Hills and Mountains in a 



1 66 Farther Adventures of RobinsonCrusoe 

needless Track, where the Rocks are impassible, and the 
Precipices such as no Enenjy could possibly enter, or in- 
deed climb up, or where if they did, no Wall could hinder 
them : They tell us, its Length is near a thousand English 
Miles, but that the Country is five hundred in a ftrait 
measured Line, which the W all bounds, without measm- 
ing the Windings and Turnings it takes ; ’tis about four 
Fathom high, and as many thick in some Places. 

I ^ood ftill an Hour or thereabout, without trespass- 
ing our Orders,^ for so long the Caravan was in -passing the 
Gate\ I say, I ftood ^ill an Hour to look at it on every 
Side, near, and far off, I mean, that was within my View; 
and the Guide of our Caravan, who had been extolling it 
for the Wonder of the World, was mighty eager to hear 
my Opinion of it ; I told him it was a moSt excellent thing 
to keep off the Tartars'^ which he happen’d not to under- 
hand as I meant it, and so took it for a Compliment ; but 
the old Pilot laugh’d: O Seignior Inglese, says he, you 
speak in Colours : I n Colours, said /, what do you mean by 
that.^ Why, you speak what looks white this way^ and 
black that way ; gay one way^ and dull another way ; you tell 
him it is a good Wall to keep out ’Tartars-, You tell me 
hy that, it is good for nothing but to keep out Tartars, or it 
will keep out none but Tartars ; I underhand you. Seignior 
Inglese, I underhand you, says he, but Seignior Chinese 
underhood you his own way. 

Well, says I, Seignior, do yoji think it would hand out 
an Army of our Country People, with a good Train of Ar- 
tillery ; or our Engineers, with two Companies of Miners ; 
would not they batter it down in ten Days, that an Army 
might enter in Battalia, or blow it up in the Air, Founda- 
tion and all, that there should be no Sign of it left? Ay, ay. 



Farther Adventures o/RobinsonCru.soe 167 

says he, I know that. The Chinese wanted mightily to 
know what I said, and I gave him Leave to tell him a few 
Days after, for we was then almoft out of their Country, 
and he was to leave us in a little time afterward ; but when 
he knew what I had said, he was dumb all the re^l of the 
way, and we heard no more of his fine Story of the Chinese 
Power and Greatness, while he flay’d. 

After we had pass’d this mighty Nothing call’d a Wall, 
something like the Pids Wall, and so famous in Northum- 
berland, and built by the Romans, we b(^an to find the 
Country thinly inhabited, and the People rather confined 
to live in fortified Towns and Cities, as being subjeft to 
the Inroads and Depredations of the 'Tartars, who rob in 
great Armies, and therefore are not to be resided by the 
naked Inhabitants of an open Country. 

And here I began to find the Necessity of keeping to- 
gether in a Caravan as we travelled; for we saw several 
Troops of Tartars roving about; but when I came to see 
them di^linftly, I wonder’d more that the Chinese Empire 
could be conquer’d by such contemptible Fellows; for 
they are a meer Hoord or Crowd of wild Fellows, keep- 
ing no Order, and under^anding no Discipline, or man- 
ner of Fight. 

Their Horses are poor lean ftarved Creatures, taught 
nothing, and fit for nothing ; and this we said, the fir^l 
Day we saw them, which was after we entered the wilder 
Part of the Country ; our Leader for the Day, gave Leave 
for about sixteen of us to go a hunting, as they call it ; and 
what was this, but hunting of Sheep ; however, it may be 
call’d hunting too; for the Creatures are the wilde^ and 
swifted of Foot that ever I saw of their Kind ; only they 
will not run a great way, and you are sure of Sport whop 



i68 Farther Adventures ofSLo mu & on Crusoe 

you begin the Chace; for they appear generally thirty or 
forty in a Flock, and like true Sheep, always keep tog^er 
when they fly. *' 

In pursuit of this odd sort of Game, it was our hap to 
meet with about forty Tartars \ whether they were hunt- 
ingMuttonaswewere,orwhether theylook’dfor another 
Kind of Prey, I know not ; but as soon as they saw us, one 
of them blew a kind of a Horn very loud, but with a bar- 
barous Sound, that I had never heard before, and by the 
way, never care to hear again : we all suppos’d this was to 
call their Friends about them, and so it was ; for in less 
than Half a Quarter of an Hour, a Troop of forty or fifty 
more appear’d, at about a Mile distance, but our Work 
was over fir^t, as it happen’d. 

One of the Scots Merchants of Muscow, happen’d to be 
among^ us, and as soon as he heard the Horn, he told us 
in short, that we had nothing to do, but to charge them 
immediately without loss of Time ; and drawing us up in 
a Line, he ask’d if we were resolv’d.? we told him we were 
ready to follow him ; so he rode direftly up to them : they 
^lood gazing at us like a meer Crowd, drawn up in no 
Order, nor shewing the Face of any Order at all; but as 
soon as they saw us advance, they let fly their Arrows, 
which however miss’d us very happily ; it seems they mis- 
took not their Aim, but their Dillance; for their Arrows 
all fell a little short of us, but with so true an Aim, that had 
we been about twenty Yards nearer, we mu^l have had 
several Men wounded, if notlcill’d. 

Immediately we halted, and tho’ it was at a great Dis- 
tance, we fir’d, and sent them Leaden Bullets, forWoodep 
Arrows, following our Shot full Gallop, to fall in among 
them Sword in Hand, for so our bold Scotthzt led us di- 
redled: He was indeed but a Merchant, but he behav’d 



Farther Adventures o/R obinsonCritsoe 169 

with that Vigour and Bravery on this occasion, and yet, 
with such a cool Courage too, that I never saw any Man 
in Aftion fitter for Commaifd. As soon as we canae up to 
them, we fir’d our Pistols in their Faces, and then drew, 
but they fled in the greatest Confusion imaginable; the 
only Stand any of them made, was on our Right, .where 
three of them ilood,,and by Signs call’d the reft to come 
back to them, having a kind of Scymiter in their Hands, 
and their Bows hanging at their Backs. Out brave Com- 
mander, without asking any body to foUow him, gallops 
up close to them, and with his Fuzee knocks one of them 
off his Horse, kill’d the second with his Piftol, and the 
third ran away, and thus ended our Fight; but we had 
this Misfortune attending it, (wz.) that all our Mutton 
that we had in chace, got away: We had not a Man kill’d 
or hurt ; but as for the Tartars ^ there was about five of them 
kill’d; who were wounded, we knew not; but this we 
knew, that the other Party was so frighted with the Noise 
of our Guns, that they made off, and never made any 
attempt upon us. 

We were all this while in the Chinese Dominion, and 
therefore the Tartars were not so bold as afterwards ; but 
in about five Days we entr’d a vaft great wild Desart, 
which held us three Days and Nights March ; and we 
were oblig’d to carry our Water with us in great Leather 
Bottles, and to encamp all Night, juft as I have heard they 
do in the Desart of Arabia, 

I ask’d whose Dominion this was in, and they told me, 
this was a kind of Border, that might be called no Man's 
hand\ being a Part of the Great Karakatbie, or Grand 
’T artary ^ but that however it was all reckon’d to China ; but 
that there was no Care taken here, to preserve it from the 
Inroads of Thieves, and therefore it was reckon’d the 



1 70 Farther Adventures 0/ Robinson Crusoe 

wor^l Desart in the whole World ; tho’ we were to go over 
some much larger. 

In passing this Wilderness, which I confess was at the 
fir^ very frightful to me, we saw two or three times little 
Parties of the Tartars^ but they seem’d to be upon their 
own Affairs, and to have no Design upon us; and so like 
the Man who met the Devil, if they had nothing to say to 
us, we had nothing to say to them; we let them go. 

Once however, a Party of them came so near, as to 
^land and gaze at us ; whether it was to consider what they 
should do, whether attack us, or not attack us, that we 
knew not; but when we were pass’d at some diilance by 
them, we made a Rear-Guard of forty men, and ^lood 
ready for them, letting the Caravan pass half a Mile, or 
thereabouts, before us ; but after a while they march’d off, 
only we found they saluted us with five Arrows at their 
parting; one of which wounded a Horse, so that it dis- 
abled him ; and we left him the next Day, poor Creature, 
in great need of a good Farrier; we suppose they might 
shoot more Arrows, which might fall short of us, but we 
saw no more Arrows or 'Tartars^ that time. 

We travell’d near a Month after this, the Ways being 
not so good as at firft, tho’ ftill in the Dominions of the 
Emperor of China, but lay for the mo^l part in Villages, 
some of which were fortified, because of the Incursions of 
the Tartars. When we came to one of these Towns, (it 
was about two Days and a Half Journey before we were 
to come to the City Naum) I winted to buy a Camel, of 
which there are plenty to be sold all the way upon that 
Road, and of Horses also, such as they are, because so, 
many Caravans coming that way, they are often wanted : 
The Person that I spoke to to get me a Camel,. would have 
gone and fetch’d it for me, but I like a Fool muft be olfi- 



Farther Adventures <?/ Robinson Crusoe 171 

cious, andgo myself along with him ; The Place was about 
two Miles out of the Village, where, it seems, they kept 
the Camels and Horses feeding under a Guard. 

I walk’d it on Foot with my old Pilot, being very de- 
sirous, forsooth, of a little Variety : When we came to the 
Place, it was a low marshy Ground, wall’d round with a 
^one Wall, piled up dfy, without Mortar or Earth among 
it, like a Park, with a little Guard of Chinese Soldiers at the 
Door. Having bought a Camel, and agreed for the Price, 
I came away, and the Chinese Man that went with me, led 
the Camel ; when on a sudden came up five Tartars on 
Horseback; two of them seized the Fellow, and took the 
Camel from him, while other three ^ep’d up to me; 
and my old Pilot, seeing us as it were unarm’d, for I had 
no Weapon about me but my Sword, which could but ill 
defend me against three Horse-men ; the firft that came 
up, ^op’d short upon my drawing my Sword; (for they 
are errant Cowards) but a Second coming upon my Left, 
gave me a Blow on the Head, which I never felt till after- 
ward, and wondered when I came to my self, what was 
the matter with me, and where I was, for he laid me flat 
on the Ground ; but my never failing old Pilot, the Portu- 
guese (so Providence unlooked for direfts Deliverances 
from Dangers, which to us are unforeseen) had a Piftol in 
his Pocket, which I knew nothing of, nor the Tartars 
neither; if they had, I suppose they would not have at- 
tack’d us: But Cowards^are always boldest when there 
is no Danger. 

The old Man seeing me down, with a bold Heart 
ftep’d up to the Fellow that had struck me, and laying 
hold of his Arm with one Hand, and pulling him down 
by main Force a little towards him with the other, sljpt 
him into the Head, and laid him dead upon the Spot ; he 



172 Farther Adventures <?/ Robinson Crusoe 

then immediately ilep’d up to him who had ftop’d us, as 
I said, and before he could come forward again, (for it 
was all done as it were in a hioment) made a Blow at him 
with a Scymeter which he always wore, but missing the 
Man, cut his Horse into the Side of his Head, cut one of 
his Ears off by the Root, and a great Slice down the Side 
of his Face ; the poor Bea^t enraged with the Wound, was 
no more to be governed by his Rider, tho’ the Fellow sat 
well enough too ; but away he flew, and carried him quite 
out of the Pilotlfi Reach, and at some Di^ance rising up 
upon his hind Legs, threw down the Tartar^ and fell up- 
on him. 

In this Interval the poor Chinese came in, who had lo^l 
the Camel, but he had no Weapon ; however, seeing the 
'Tartar down, and his Horse fallen upon him, away he 
runs to him, and seizing upon an ugly ill-favour’d Wea- 
pon he had by his Side, something like a Pole-ax, but not 
a Pole-ax neither, he wrench’d it from him, and made 
shift to knock his Tartarian Brains out with it. But my old 
Man had the third Tartar to deal with ftill, and seeing he 
did not fly, as he expefted, nor come on to fight him, as he 
apprehended, but ftand ftock ftill, the old Man ^food 
ftill too, and falls to work with his Tackle to charge his 
Pistol again; but as soon as the Tartar saw the Pistol, 
whether he supposed it to be the same, or another, I know 
not, but away he scowered, and left my Pilot, my Cham- 
pion I call’d him afterward, a compleat Viftory. 

By this time I was a little awake, for I thought when 
fir^l I began to wake, that I had been in a sweet Sleep ; but 
as I said above, I wondered where I was, how I came up» 
on the Ground, and what was the matter ; In a word, a 
fejv moments after, as Sense returned, I felt Pain, tho’ I 
did not know where ; I clap’d my Hand to my Head, and 



Farther Adventures of Crusoe 173, 

took it away bloody ; then I felt my Head ach, and then in 
another Moment, Memory returned, and every thing 
was present to me again. * 

I jump’d up upon my Feet inftantly, and got hold of 
my Sword, but no Enemies in View: I found a Tartar \it 
dead and his Horse ^landing very quietly by him*; and 
looking farther, I saw my Champion and Deliverer, who 
had been to see what the Chinese had done, coming back 
with his Hanger in his Hand; the old Man seeing me on 
my Feet, came running to me and embraced me with a 
great deal of Joy, being afraid before that I had been kill- 
ed, and seeing me bloody, would see how I was hurt, but 
it was not much, only what we call a broken Head; nei- 
ther did I afterwards find any great Inconvenience from 
the Blow, other than the Place which was hurt ; and which 
was well again in two or three Days. 

We made no great Gain however by this Viftory, for 
we lo^l a Camel, and gained a Horse ; but that which was 
remarkable, when we came back to the Village, the Man 
demanded to be paid for the Camel ; I disputed it, and it 
was brought to a hearing before the Chinese Judge of the 
Place ; that is to say, in English, we went before a Justice 
of the Peace : Give him his due, he afted with a great deal 
of Prudence and Impartiality; and having heard both 
Sides, he gravely ask’d the Chinese Man, that went with 
me to buy the Camel, whose Servant he was.^ I am no Ser- 
vant, says he, but went wjth the Stranger. At whose Re- 
que^, says the Justice At the Stranger’s Request, says 
he. Why then, says the Justice, you were the Stranger’s 
Servant for the Time, and the Camel being deliver’d to 
his Servant, it was delivered to him, and he mu 4 I pay 
for it. . 

I confess the Thing was so clear, that I had not a Word 



1 74 Farther Adventures o/Robinson Crusoe 

to say ; but admiring to see such ju^ Reasoning upon the 
Consequence, and so accurate bating the cause, I pay’d 
willingly for the Camel, ahd sent for another; but you 
may observe, I sent for it, I did not go to fetch it my self 
any more; I had enough of that. 

The City of Naum is a Frontier of the Chinese Empire ; 
they call it fortified, and so it is, as Fortifications go there ; 
for this I will venture to affirm, that all the Tartars in Kar- 
akathaie, which I believe, are some Millions, could not 
batter down the Walls with their Bows and Arrows; but 
to call it ^rong, if it were attacked with Cannon, would 
be to make those who underhand it, laugh at you. 

We wanted, as I have said, above two Days Journey of 
this City, when Messengers were sent Express to every 
Part of the Road, to tell all Travellers and Caravans, to 
halt till they had a Guard sent for them ; for that an un- 
usual Body of Tartars, making ten thousand in all, had 
appeared in the Way, about thirty Miles beyond the City. 

This was very bad News to Travellers; however, it 
was carefully done of the Governour, and we were very 
glad to hear we should have a Guard ; accordingly, two 
Days after, we had two hundred Soldiers sent us from a 
Garrison of the Chineses, on our left, and three hundred 
more from the City oiNaum, and with those we advanced 
boldly; the three hundred Soldiers from Naum, march’d* 
in our Front, the two hundred in our Rear, and our Men 
on each Side of our Camels with our Baggage, and the 
whole Caravan in the Center ; in this Order, and well pre- 
pared for Battle, we thought our selves a Match for the 
whole ten thousand Mongol T artars, if they had appeared; 
but the next day when they did appear, it was quite an- 
other thing. 

It was early in the Morning, when marching from a 



Farther Adventures 0/ Robinson Crusoe 175 

little well situated Town call’d Changu, we had a River to 
pass, where we were obliged to ferry ; and had the T artars 
had any Intelligence, then had been the Time to have at- 
tack’d us, when the Caravan being over, the Rear-Guard 
was behind; but they did not appear. 

About three Hours after, when we were enter’d upon 
a Desartof about fifteen or sixteen Miles over, behold, by 
a Cloud of Du^l they rais’d, we saw an Enemy was at 
Hand, and they were at Hand indeed, for they came on 
upon the Spur. • 

The Chineses^ our Guard on the Front, who had talk’d 
so big the Day before, began to dagger, and the Soldiers 
frequently look’d behind them, which is a certain Sign in 
a Soldier, that he is ju^ ready to run away; my old Pilot 
was of my mind, and being near me, he call ’d out. Seignior 
Inglese, says he, those Fellows mu^ be encourag’d, or 
they will ruin us all ; for if the Tartars come on, they will 
never ^land it : I am of your Mind, said I, but what Course 
mu^ be done.^ Done ! says he^ let fifty of our Men advance, 
and flank them on each Wing, and encourage them, and 
they will fight like brave Fellows in brave Company ; but 
without, they will every man turn his back ; immediately I 
rode up to our Leader, and told him, who was exaftly of 
our mind ; and accordingly, fifty of us march’d to the right 
Wing, and fifty to the left, and the reil made a Line of 
Rescue ; and so we march’d, leaving the la^l two hundred 
Men to make another Bo,dy by themselves, and to guard 
the Camels; only that if need were, they should send a 
hundred Men, to assift the laft fifty. 

In a Word, the Tartars came on, and an innumerable 
Company they were ; how many, we could not tell, but 
ten thousand we thought was the lea^l : A Party of th«m 
came on fir^, and view’d our Po^ure, traversing the 



176 Farther Adventuresof^omnsoa Crusoe 

Ground in the Front of our Line; and as we found them 
within Gun-shot, our Leader ordered the two Wings to 
advance swiftly, and give thfem a Salvo on each Wing with 
their Shot, which was done ; but they went off, and I sup- 
pose back to give an Account of the Reception they were 
like to meet with : and indeed that Salute clogg'd their 
Stomach, for they immediately halted, ^ood a while to 
consider of it, and wheeling off to the left, they gave over 
the Design, ^nd said no more to us for that time ; which 
was very agreeable to our Circumftances, which were but 
very indifferent for a Battle with such a Number. 

Two Days after this, we came to the City Naun, or 
Naum ; we thank’d the Governour for his Care for us, and 
collected to the Value of 'a hundred Crowns, or there- 
abouts, which we gave to the Soldiers sent to guard us ; 
and here we reeled one Day. This is a Garrison indeed, 
and there were nine hundred Soldiers kept here ; but the 
Reason of it was, that formerly the Muscovite Frontiers 
lay nearer to them than they do now, the Muscovites hav- 
ing abandon’d that Part of the Country (which lies from 
this City We^, for about two hundred Miles) as desolate 
and unfit for Use ; and more especially, being so very re- 
mote, and so difficult to send Troops thither for its De- 
fence; for we had yet above two thousand Miles to Mus- 
covy^ properly so call’d. 

After this, we pass’d several great Rivers, and two 
dreadful Desarts, one of which we were sixteen Days pass- 
ing over, and which, as I said, was to be call’d no Man's 
Land ; and on the 1 3 th of April we came to the Frontiers 
of the Muscovite Dominions: I think the fir^f City, or 
Town, or Fortress, whatever it might be call’d, that be- 
long’d to the Czar oi Muscovy., was call’d Argun, being on 
the We^l Side of the River Argun. 



Farther Adventures 0/ Robinson Crusoe 177 

I could not but discover an infinite Satisfaftion, that I 
was so soon arrived in, as I call’d it, a Chriftian Country, or 
at lea^ in a Country governed by Chriftians ; for tho’ the 
Muscovites doyinmy OpinioHy but ju^l deserve the Name of 
Chriflians, yet such they pretend to be, and are very de- 
vout in their Way : It would certainly occur to any Man 
who travels the World as I have done, and who had any 
Power of Refleftion; I say, it would occur to him, to re- 
fleft what a Blessing it is to be brought into the World, 
where the Name of God, and of a Redeemer is known, 
worship’d and ador’d ; and not where the People given up 
by Heaven to strong Delusions, worship the Devil, and 
prostrate themselves to Stocks and Stones, worship Mon- 
sters, Elements, horrible shaped Animals, and Statues, 
or Images of MonSlers: not a Town or City we pass’d 
thro’, buthad their Pagods, their Idols,andtheirTemples, 
and ignorant People worshipping, even the Works of 
their own Hands. 

Now we came where at leaSl a Face of the Christian 
Worship appear’d, where the Knee was bow’d to Jesus; 
and whether ignorantly or not, yet the ChriSlian Religion 
was own’d, and the Name of the true God was call’d upon, 
and adored ; and it made the very Recesses of my Soul re- 
joice to see it : I saluted the brave Scots Merchant I men- 
tioned above, with my firSl acknowledgement of this ; and 
taking him by the Hand, I said to him. Blessed be God, 
we are once again come ^ong ChriSlians : He smiled, 
and answered, do not rejoice too soon Countryman, these 
Muscovites are but an odd sort of ChriSlians ; and but for 
the Name of it, you may see very little of the SubSlance, 
for some Months farther of our Journey. 

Well, says I, but ^till ’tis better than Paganism, and 
worshipping of Devils. Why, I’ll teULjsu^ Bays be, except

178 Farther Adventures o/RobinsonCrusoe 
the Russian Soldiers in Garrisons, and a few of the Inhabi- 
tants of the Cities upon the Road, all the re^f of this Coun- 
try, for above a thousand \VIiles farther, is inhabited by 
the woril, and moft ignorant of Pagans; and so indeed 
we found it. 

We were now launch’d into the greater Piece of solid 
Earth, if I understand any thing, of the Surface of the 
Globe, that is to be found in any Part of the Earth ; we had 
at leaSl twelve hundred Miles to the Sea, Eastward ; we 
had at leaSl two thousand to the Bottom of the Baltick 
Sea, Westward; and above three thousand Miles, if we 
left that Sea, and went on WeSt to the British and French 
Channels ; We had full five thousand Miles to the Indian^ 
or Persian Sea, South ; and about eight hundred Miles to 
the Frozen Sea, North; nay, if some People may be be- 
lieved, there might be no Sea North-Eaft, till we came 
round the Pole, and consequently into the North-WeSt, 
and so had a Continent of Land into America^ the Lord 
knows where, tho’ I could give some Reasons, why I be- 
lieve that to be a MiSlake. 

As we enter’d into the Muscovite Dominions, a good 
while before we come to any considerable Towns, we had 
nothing to observe there but this ; firSf, that all the Rivers 
that run to the EaSl, as I understood by the Charts, which 
some in our Caravan had with them ; it was plain, all those 
Rivers ran into the Great River T amour, or Gammour: 
This River, by the natural Cojurse of it muSl run into the 
EaSl Sea, or Chinese Ocean. The Story they tell us, that 
the Mouth of this River, is choak’d up with Bullrushes, 
of a monSlruous Growth, (wz.) three Foot about, and 
twenty or thirty Foot high, I muSl be allow’d to say, I be- 
lieve nothing of; but as its Navigation is of no Use, be- 
oasue there is no Trade that way, the 'Tartars, to whom 



Farther Adventures o/R obinsonCrUsoe 179 

alone it belongs, dealing in nothing but Cattle, so no Body 
that ever I heard of, has beenpurious enough, either to go 
down to the Mouth of it in Boats, or come up from the 
Mouth of it in Ships ; but this is certain, that this River 
running due Ea^, in the Latitude of [60 degrees,] carries 
a va^t Concourse of Rivers along with it, and finds an 
Ocean to empty it self in that Latitude ; so we are sure of 
Sea there. 

Some Leagues to the North of this River, there are 
several considerable Rivers, whose Streams run as due 
North as the Tamourmns Ea^t, and these are all found to 
join their Waters with the Great River Tartarus^ nam’d 
so, from the northernmoft Nations of the Mongul Tartars^ 
who the Chinese say, were the firit Tartars in the World; 
and who, as our Geographers alledge, are the Gog and 
Magog, mention’d in sacred Story. 

These Rivers running all Northward, as well as all the 
other Rivers, I am yet to speak of, make it evident, that 
the Northern Ocean bounds the Land also on that side ; 
so that it does not seem rational in the lea^t to think, that 
the Land can extend it self to join with America on that 
side, or that there is not a Communication between the 
Northern and the Ea^ern Ocean ; but of this I shall say 
no more, it was my Observation at that time, and there- 
fore I take Notice of it in this Place. We now advanc’d 
from the River Arguna by easy and moderate Journeys, 
and were very visibly oblig’d to the Care the Czar oi Mus- 
covy has taken to have Cities and Towns built in as many 
Places as are possible to place them, where his Soldiers 
keep Garrison something like the Stationary Soldiers 
plac’d by the Romans in the remotest Countries of their 
Empire, some of which I had read particularly wdtc 
plac’d in Britain for the Security of Commerce, and for the 



1 8o Farther Adventures 0/ Robinson Crusoe 
lodging Travellers; and thus it was here ; for where-ever 
we came, tho’ at these Towps and Stations, the Garrisons 
and Governor were Russians^ and profess’d Christians, 
yet the Inhabitants of the Country were meer Pagans, 
sacrificing to Idols, and worshipping the Sun, Moon, and 
Stars, or all the HoSt of Heaven, and not only so, but were 
of all the Heathens and Pagans that ever I met with, the 
moSl barbarous, except only that they did not eat Man’s 
Flesh, as our Savages of America did. 

Some InSlanfces of this we met with in the Country be- 
tween Arguna, where we enter the Muscovite Dominions, 
and a City of Tartars and Russians together, call’d Nort- 
ziuskoy, in which is a continu’d Desart or ForeSI, which 
coSl us twenty Days to travel over it : in a Village near the 
laSl of those Places I had the Curiosity to go and see their 
Way of Living, which is moSl brutish and unsufFerable ; 
they had I suppose a great Sacrifice that Day, for there 
^lood out upon an old Stump of a Tree, an Idol made of 
Wood, frightful as the Devil, at leaft as any Thing we can 
think of to represent the Devil, can be made; it had a 
Head certainly not so much as resembling any Creature 
that the World ever saw ; Ears as big as Goats Horns, and 
ashigh ; Eyes as big as a Crown-Piece ; a Nose like a crook- 
ed Ram’s Horn, and a Mouth extended four corner’d, 
like that of a Lion, with horrible Teeth, hooked like a 
Parrot’s under Bill ; it was dressed up in the filthiest man- 
ner that you could suppose; its upper Garment was of 
Sheep-Skins, with the Wool outward, a great Tar/ar Bon- 
net on the Head, with two Horns growing through it; it 
was about eight Foot high, yet had no Feet or Legs,\)r 
any other Proportion of Parts. 

' This Scare-crow was set up at the outer Side of the Vil- 
lage, and when I came near to it, there was sixteen or 



Farther Adventures o/RobinsonCrvsoS 

seventeen Creatures, whether Men or Women, I could 
not tell, for they make no Di^inftion by their Habits, 
either of Body or Head : ThtSe lay all flat on the Ground, 
round this formidable Block of shapeless Wood : I saw 
no Motion among them any more, than if they had been 
all Logs of Wood like the Idol, and at fir^, really thought 
they had been so; byt when I came a little nearer, they 
started up upon their Feet, and rais’d a howlingCry, as if it 
hadbeen somanydeep-mouth’dHounds, andwalk’daway 
as if they were displeas’d at our di^lurbiog tliem : A little 
way off from this Monster, and at the Door of that Tent 
or Hutt, made all of Sheep-Skins and Cow-Skins, dry’d, 
^lood three Butchers, I thought they were such ; when I 
came nearer to them, I found they had long Knives in their 
Hands, and in the middle of the Tent appear’d three 
Sheep kill’d, and one young Bullock or Steer: These it 
seems, were Sacrifices to that sensless Log of an Idol, and 
these three Men, Priests belonging to it; and the seven- 
teen pro-rated Wretches, were the People who brought 
the Offering, and were making their Prayers to that 
Stock. 

I confess I was more mov’d at their Stupidity and bru- 
tish Worship of a Hobgoblin, than ever I was at any Thing 
in my Life ; to see God’s mo^l glorious and be^I Creature, 
to whom he had granted so many Advantages, even by 
Creation^ above the reft of the Works of his Hands, vefted 
with a reasonable Soul, and that Soul adorn’d with Facul- 
ties and Capacities, adapted both to honour his Maker, 
and be honoured by him, sunk and degenerated to a De- 
gree so more than ftupid, as to proftrate it self to a fright- 
ful Nothing, a meer imaginary Objeft dress’d up by 
themselves, and made terrible to themselves by their cgvn 
Contrivance; adorn’d only with Clouts and Rags; and 



V( 1 8 2 Farther Adventures ofR obinsonCrusoe 

that this should be the Effedlof meer Ignorance, wrought 
up into hellish Devotion by the Devil himself ; who envy- 
ing (to his Maker) the Hdmage and Adoration of his 
Creatures, had deluded them into such gross, surfeiting, 
sordid and brutish things, as one would think should 
shock Nature it self. '' 

But what signify ’d all the Astonishment andRefleftion 
of Thoughts ; thus it was, and I saw it before my Eyes, 
and there wa^ no room to wonder at it, or think it impos- 
sible; all my Admiration turn’d to Rage, and I rid up to 
the Image, or MonSter, call it what you will, and with my 
Sword cut the Bonnet that was on its Head in two in the 
middle, so that it hung down by one of the Horns ; and 
one of our Men that was with me took hold of the Sheep- 
Skin that cover’d it, and pull’d at it, when behold a moSf 
hideous Outcry and Howling run thro’ the Village, and 
two or three hundred People came about my Ears, so that 
I was glad to scour for it; for we saw some had Bows and 
Arrows ; but I resolved from that moment to visit them 
again. 

Our Caravan rented three Nights at the Town, which 
was about four Miles off, in order to provide some Horses 
which they wanted, several of the Horses having been 
lam’d, and jaded with the badness of the Way and long 
March over the la^f Desart ; so we had some Leisure here 
to put my Design in Execution : I communicated my 
Projeft to the Scots Merchant of Muscow, of whose Cou- 
rage I had had sufficient Testimony, as above : I told him 
what I had seen, and with what Indignation I had since 
thought that human Nature could be so degenerate: J 
told him, I was resolv’d if I could get but four or five Men 
wejl arm’d to go with me, I was resolv’d to go and destroy 
that vile, abominable Idol, and let them see that it had no 



Farther Adventures o/R obinsonCrusoe 183 

Power to help it self, and consequently could not be an 
Objeft of Worship, or to be pray’d to, much less help 
them that offer’d Sacrifices tb it. 

He laugh’d at me ; says he, Your Zeal may be good, but 
what do you propose to yourself by it.? Propose, said /, to 
vindicate the Honour of God, which is insulted by this 
Devil Worship. But how will it vindicate the Honour of 
God, said he? While the People will not be able to know 
what you mean by it, unless you could speak to them and 
tell them so, and then they will fight you, and beat you 
too, I’ll assure you, for they are desperate Fellows, and 
that especially in Defence of their Idolatry. Can we not, 
said I, do it in the Night, and then leave them the Reasons 
and Causes in Writing in their own Language.? Writing 1 
said he, why there is not a Man in five Nations of them 
that know any thing of a Letter, or how to read a Word in 
any Language, or in their own. Wretched Ignorance! 
said I to him ; however I have a great mind to do it ; per- 
haps Nature may draw Inferences from it to them, to let 
them see how brutish they are, to worship such horrid 
Things. Look you, Sir, said he, if your Zeal prompts you 
to it so warmly, you muil: do it; but in the next place I 
would have you consider, these wild Nations of People 
are subjefted by Force to the Czar of Muscovy's Domin- 
ions, and if you do this, ’tis ten to one but they will come 
by Thousands to the Governour of Nertsinskay, and com- 
plain, and demand Satisfaction; and if he cannot give 
them Satisfaction, ’tis ten to one but they revolt, and it 
will occasion a new War with all the Tartars in the Coun- 
try. 

This, I confess, put new Thoughts into my Head for a 
while ; but I harp’d upon the same String ftill, and all that 
Day I was uneasy to put my ProjeCt in Execution : To- 



1 84 Farther Adventures o/RobinsonCrusoe 

•wards the Evening the Scots Merchant met me by Acci- 
dent in our Walk about the Town, and desir’d to speak 
with me ; I believe, said he, Fhave put you off of your good 
Design ; I have been a little concern’d about it since, for I 
abhor the Idol and the Idolatry as much as you can do: 
Truly, says /, you have put it off a little as to the Execu- 
tion of it, but you have not put it all-out of my Thoughts, 
and I believe I shall do it Sill before I quit this Place, tho’ 
I were to be deliver’d up to them for Satisfaftion. No, no, 
says he^ God i'orbid they should deliver you up to such a 
Crew of Mongers; they shall not do that neither; that 
would be murdering you indeed. Why, says I, how would 
they use me. ^ Use you ! says he ; I’ll tell you how they serv’d 
a poor Russian, who affronted them in their Worship 
ju^ as you did, and who they took Prisoner; after they 
had lam’d him with an Arrow that he could not run away, 
they took him and Gripp’d him ^lark naked, and set him 
up on the top of the Idol Monger, and ^tood all round 
him, and shot as many Arrows into him as would ftick 
over his whole Body, and then they burnt him and all the 
Arrows Clicking in him as a Sacrifice to the Idol. And was 
this the same Idol.? Yes, says he, the very same. Well, says 
/, I’ll tell you a Story ; so I related the Story of our Men at 
Madagascar, and how they burnt and sack’d the Village 
there, and kill’d Man, Woman and Child, for their mur- 
dering one of our Men, juft as it is related before; and 
when I had done, ! added, that I thought we ought to do 
so to this Village. 

He liften’d very attentively to the Story ; but when I 
talk’d of doing so to that Village, says,be. You miftake 
very much, it was not this Village, it was almoft a hun- 
dred Mile from this place, but it was the same Idol, for 
they carry him about in Procession all over the Country : 



Farther Adventures o/RobinsonCrusoe 185 

Well, then, says I, then that Idol ought to be punish’d for 
it, and it shall, says I, if I live this Night out. 

In a word, finding me resolute, he lik’d the Design, 
and told me I should not go alone, but he would go with 
me, and bring a ^out Fellow, one of his Countrymen, to 
go also with us ; and one, says he, as famous for his Zeal as 
you can desire any o^e to be, against such Devilish things 
as these. In a word, he brought me his Comrade, a Scots 
Man, who he call’d Captain Richardson, and I gave him 
a full account of what I had seen ; and in,a word, of what I 
intended ; and he told me readily, he would go with me if 
it coit him his Life; so we agreed to go only us three. I 
had indeed propos’d it to my Partner, but he declin’d it; 
he said, he was ready to assi^ me to the utmo^, and upon 
all occasions for my defence ; but that this was an Adven- 
ture quite out of his way ; so, I say, we resolv’d upon our 
Work only us three and my Man-Servant, and to put it 
in Execution that Night about Midnight, with all the 
Secrecy imaginable. 

However, upon second Thoughts, we were willing to 
delay it till the next Night, because the Caravan being to 
set forward in the Morning, we suppos’d the Governour 
could not pretend to give them any Satisfadfion upon us 
when we were out of his Power. The Scots Merchant, as 
steady in his Resolution for the Enterprize, as bold in 
executing, brought me a Tartar’s Robe or Gown of the 
Sheep-SHns, and a Bonnet, with a Bow and Arrows, and 
had provided the same for himself and his Countryman, 
that the People, if they saw us, should not be able to de- 
termine who w^were. 

All the firdl: Night we spent in mixing up some com- 
bu^ible Matter with Aqua-vitae, Gun-powder, and such 
other Materials as we could get ; and having a good Quan- 



i86 Farther Adventures of hi a son Crusoe 

tity of Tar in a little Pot, about an Hour after Night we 
set out upon our Expedition. 

We came to the Place abaut eleven a Clock at Night, 
and found that the People had not the lea^ Jealousy of 
Danger attending their Idol; the Night was cloudy, yet 
the Moon gave us Light enough to see that the Idol ftood 
juft in the same Pofture and Place th^at it did before : The 
People seemed to be all at their Reft, only, that in the 
great Hutt, or Tent, as we called it, where we saw the 
three Priefts,'wl\o we miftook for Butchers, we saw a 
Light, and going up close to the Door, we heard People 
talking, as if there were five or six of them ; we concluded 
therefore, that if we set the Wild-fire to the Idol, these 
Men would come out immediately, and run up to the 
Place to rescue it from the Deftruftion that we intended 
for it, and what to do with them we knew not; once we 
thought of carrying it away, and setting Fire to it at a Dis- 
tance ; but when we came to handle it, we found it too 
bulky for our Carriage, so we were at a Loss again : The 
second Scots Man was for setting Fire to the Tent or Hutt, 
and knocking the Creatures that were there on the Head 
when they came out; but I could not joy n with that; I. 
was againft killing them, if it was possible to be avoided : 
Well, then said the Scots Merchant, I’ll tell you what we 
will do, we will try to take them Prisoners, tye their Hands 
behind them, and make them ftand ftill, and see their 
Idol deftroy’d. 

As it happen’d, we had Twine or Packthread enough 
about us, which was used to tye our Fire-Works together 
with ; so we resolv’d to attack these People firft, and with* 
as little Noise as we could : The firft Thing we did, we 
knocked at the Door, which issued juft as we desired it; 
for one of their Idol Pr lefts came to the Door : we imme- 



Farther Adventures of^ioBinso^ Crusoe 187 

diately seized upon him, Slop’d his Mouth, and ty’d his 
Hands behind him, and led him to the Idol, where we 
gagg’d him, that he might not make a Noise; ty’d his 
Feet also together, and left him on the Ground. 

Two of us then waited at the Door, expefting that an- 
other would com e out to see what the Matter was ; but we 
waited so long ’till the third Man came back to us ; and 
then no Body coming out, we knock’d again gently, and 
immediately out came two more, and we served them ju^ 
in the same Manner, but was oblig’d to go ftll with them, 
and lay them down by the Idol some Di^ance from one 
another ; when going back, we found two more were come 
out to the Door, and a third ^ood behind them within 
the Door : We seiz’d the two, and immediately ty’d them, 
when the third Pepping back, and crying out, my Scots 
Merchant went in after him, and taking out a Composi- 
tion we had made, that would only smoke and ftink, he 
set Fire to it, and threw it in among them; by that Time 
the other Scots Man and my Man taking Charge of the 
two Men who were already bound, and ty’d together also 
by the Arm, led them away to the Idol, and left them 
there, to see if their Idol would relieve them, making 
tda^le back to us. 

When the Fuze we had thrown in had fill’d the Hutt 
with so much Smoak, that they were almo^ suffocated, 
we then threw in a small Leather Bag of another kind, 
which flam’d like a Candle, and following it in, we found 
there was but four Peopfe left, who, it seems, were two 
Men and two Women, and, as we supposed, had been 
about some of their Diabolick Sacrifices : They appear’d, 
in short, frighted to Death, at lea^f so as to sit trembling 
and stupid, and not able to speak neither, for the Smoak. 

In a word, we took them, bound them as we ha(fthe 



1 88 Farther Adventures ^Robinson Crusoe 

other, and all without any Noise: I should have said, we 
brought them out of the House or Hutt fir^l; for indeed 
we were not able to bear the Smoak any more than they 
were. When we had done this, we carry’d them all toge- 
ther to the Idol : when we came there, we fell to work with 
him ; and fir^l we daub’d him all over, and his Robes also, 
with Tar and such other Stuff as we had, which was Tal- 
low mix’d with Brim^one; then we topp’d his Eyes, 
and Ears, and Mouth full of Gun-Powder, and then we 
wrapp’d up a'great Piece of Wild-fire in his Bonnet, and 
then Clicking alfthe Combu^libles we had brought*with 
us upon him, we look’d about to see if we could find any 
thing else to help to burn him, when my Man remem- 
bred, that by the Tent or Hutt where the Men were, there 
lay a heap of dry Forage, whether Straw or Rushes I do 
not remember ; away he and one of the Scots Men run, and 
fetch’d their Arms full of that : When we had done this, 
we took all our Prisoners, and brought them, having un- 
ty’d their Feet, and ungagg’d their Mouths, and made 
them iland up, and set them ju^l before their monstrous 
Idol, and there set fire to the whole. 

We flay’d by it a quarter of an Hour, or thereabouts^ 
’till the Powder in the Eyes, and Mouth, and Ears of the 
Idol blew up, and we could perceive had split and deform- 
ed the Shape; and in a word, ’till we saw it burn into a 
meer Block or Log of Wood, and then setting the dry 
Forage to it, we found it would be quite consum’d, when 
we began to think of going awdy ; but the Scots Man said 
no, we mu^l not go, for these poor deluded Wretches will 
all throw themselves into the Fire, and burn themselves 
with the Idol ; so we resolved to ^lay ’till the Forage was 
burnt down too, and then we came away and left them. 

In the Morning we appear’d among our Fellow Tra- 



Farther Adventures u/RobinsonCrusoe 189' 

vellers exceeding busy, in getting ready for our Journey ; 
nor could any Man suggell: that we had been any where 
but in our Beds, as Travellers might be suppos’d to be, to 
fit themselves for the Fatigues of that Day’s Journey. 

But it did not end so ; the next Day came a great Multi- 
tude of the Country People, not only of this Village, but 
of a hundred more, for ought I know, to the Town-Gates, 
and ina moft outragious Manner, demanded Satisfaftion 
of the Russian Governour, for the insulting their Priests, 
and burning their great Cbam-Chi-Thaungu, such a hard 
Name they gave the monstrous Creature they worship ’d ; 
the People of Nertsinskay^ were at firft in a great Conger- 
nation, for they said, the Tartars were no less than thirty 
thousand, and that in a few Days more, would be one 
hundred thousand strong. 

The Russian Governour sentoutMessengers to appease 
them, and gave them all the good words imaginable : He 
assured them, he knew nothing of it, and that there had 
not a Soul of his Garrison been abroad : that it could not 
be from any body there ; and if they would let him know 
who it was, they should be examplarily punished. They 
return’d haughtily, that all the Country reverenced the 
Great Cham-^bi-Thaungu, who dwelt in the Sun, and no 
Mortal would have decreed to offer Violence to his Im- 
age, but some Chri^ian Miscreant, so they call’d them it 
seems ; and they therefore denounc’d War against him, 
and all the Russians, who* they said, were Miscreants and 
Christians. 

The Governour Still patient, and unwilling to make a 
Breach, or to have any Cause of War alledged to be given 
by him, the Czar having Straitly charged them to treat the 
conquer’d Country with Gentleness and Civility, gave 
them Still all the good Words he could; at laSt he told 



1 90 Farther Adventures ^RobinsonCrusoe 

them, there was a Caravan gone towards Russia that 
Morning, and perhaps it was some of them, who had done 
them this Injury ; and that if they would be satisfied with 
that, he would send after them, to enquire into it : This 
seem’d to appease them a little ; and accordingly the Go- 
vernour sent after us, and gave us a particular Account 
how the Thing was; intimating withal, that if any in our 
Caravan had done it, they should make their Escape ; but 
that whether cthey had done it or no, we should make all 
the Ha^e forward that was possible ; and that in the mean 
time- he would keep them in Play as long as he could. 

This was very friendly in the Governour; however, 
when it came to the Caravan, there was no Body knew 
any Thing of the Matter ; and as for us that were guilty, 
we were the lea^ of all suspefted ; none so much as ask’d 
us the Question ; however, the Captain of the Caravan for 
the Time, took the Hint that the Governour gave us, and 
we marched or travelled two Days and two Nights, with- 
out any considerable Stop ; and then we lay at a Village 
called Plothus ; nor did make any long Stop here, but has- 
ten’d on towards Jarawena, another of the Czar of Mus- 
covy's Colonies, and where we expefted we should be safe ; 
but it is to be observ’d, that here we began for two or three 
Days March, to enter upon the va^l nameless Desart, of 
which I shall say more in its Place ; and which, if we had 
now been upon it, ’tis more than probable, we had been 
all destroy’d : It was the second Day’s March from Plot- 
bus^ that by the Clouds of Du^l behind us at a great Dis- 
tance, some of our People began to be sensible we were 
pursued ; we had enter’d the Desart, and had pass’d by 
great Lake call’d Schaks-Oser when we perceiv’d a very 
great Body of Horse appear on the other Side of the Lake 
to the North, we travelling We^f ; We observ’d they went 



• Farther Adventures of Vi Ckv son 191 

away We^l as we did, but had supposed we would have 
taken that* Side of the Lake, whereas, we very happily 
took the South Side ; and in ^wo Days more, we saw them 
not, for they believing we were ftill before them, push'd 
on till they came to the river Udda \ this is a very great Ri- 
ver when it passes farther North ; but where we came to it, 
we found it narrow, and fordable. 

The third Day they either found their Miyake, or had 
Intelligence of us, and came pouring in up9n us, towards 
the Dusk of the Evening : We had, to our great Satisfac- 
tion,* juft pitch’d upon a Place for our Camp, whic|} was 
very convenient for the Night ; for as we were upon a.De- 
sart, tho’ but at the beginning of it, that was above five 
hundred Miles over, we had no Towns to lodge at, and 
indeed expefted none but the City Jarawena, which we 
had yet two Days march to ; the Desart however, had some 
few Woods in it on this Side, and little Rivers, which ran 
all into the great river Udda: It was in a narrow Strait be- 
tween two little, but very thick Woods, that we pitch’d 
our little Camp for that Night, expefting to be attack’d 
in the Night. 

. No body knew but ourselves, what we were pursued 
for ; but as it was usual for the Mongul Tartars to go about 
in Troops in that Desart, so the Caravans always fortify 
themselves every Night againft them, as againft Armies 
of Robbers ; and it was therefore no new thing to be pur- 
sued. , 

But we had this Night, of all the Nights of our Travels, 
a moft advantageous Camp; for we lay between two 
Woods, with adittle Rivulet running juft before our 
Front; so that we could not be surrounded, or attack’d 
any way, but in our Front or Rear; we took Care also to 
Juake our Front as ftrong as we could, by placing our 



192 Farther Adventures c/RobinsonCrusoe 

Packs, with our Camels and Horses, all in a Line on the 
Inside of the River, and felling some Trees in our Rear. 

In this Po^ure we encamp’d for the Night, but the 
Enemy was upon us before we had finish’d our Situation : 
They did not come on us like Thieves as we expefted, but 
sent three Messengers to us, to demand the Men to be 
delivered to them, that had abus’cd their Priests, and 
burn’d their God, Cham-Chi- 'Fhaunguvfith. Fire, that they 
might burn tljem with Fire ; and upon this, they said they 
would go away,»and do us no farther harm, otherwise, 
they.would burn us all with Fire. Our Men look’d very 
blank at this Message, and began to ftare at one another, 
to see who look’d with mo^l Guilt in their Faces ; but no 
Body was the Word, no Body did it. The Leader of the 
Caravan sent Word, he was well assur’d, it was not done 
by any of our Camp ; that we were peaceable Merchants, 
travelling on our Business ; that we had done no harm to 
them, or to any one else ; and that therefore, they mu^ 
look farther for their Enemies who had injur’d them, for 
we were not the People ; so desir’d them not to difturb us, 
for if they did, we should defend our selves. 

They were far from being satisfy’d with this for an Anr 
swer, but a great Crowd of them came down in the Morn- 
ing by break of Day to our Camp ; but seeing us in such 
an unaccountable Situation, they durft come no farther 
than the Brook in our Front, where they ftood and shew’d 
us such a Number, that indeed terrify’d us very much; 
for those that spoke leaft of them, spoke of ten thousand : 
here they ^ood and look’d at us a while, and then setting 
up a great Howl, they let fly a Cloud of Arrows am<»ng 
us ; but we were well enough fortified for that ; for we shel- 
ter’d under our Baggage, and I do not remember that one 
Man of us was hurt. 



Farther Adventures 0/ Robin so^ Crusoe 193 

Some Time after this, we see them move a little to our 
Right, and expefted them on the Rear, when a cunning 
Fellow, a Cossack, as they calf them, of Jarawena, in the 
Pay of the Muscovites, calling to the Leader of the Cara- 
van, said to him. I’ll go send all these People away to Si- 
heilka', this was a City, four or five Days Journey at leaft 
to the South, and rather behind us : so he takes his Bow 
and Arrows, and getting on Horse-back, he rides away 
from our Rear direftly, as it were back to J^ertssinskay, 
after this, he takes a great Circuit about, and comes to the 
Armf of the Tartars, as if he had been sent Express tft tell 
them a long Story; that the People who had burnt ^he 
Cham-Chi-Thaungu, were gone to Siheilka, with a Caravan 
of Miscreants, as he call’d them, that is to say, Chri^ians ; 
and that they had resolv’d to burn the God Schal-Isar, be- 
longing to the Tongueses. 

As this Fellow was himself a meer Tartar, and perfeft- 
ly spoke their I^anguage, he counterfeited so well, that 
they all took it from him, and away they drove in a moft 
violent Hurry to Siheilka, which it seems was five Days 
Journey to the North, and in less than three Hours, they 
were entirely out of our Sight, and we never heard any 
more of them ; and we never knew whether they went to 
that other Place called Siheilka, or no. 

So we pass’d safely on to the City of Jarawena, where 
there was a Garrison of Muscovites, and there we re^ed 
five Days, the Caravan beipg exceedingly fatigued with 
the laft Day’s hard march, and with want of Re^ in the 

Night. 

From this City#ve had a frightful Desart, which held 
us three and twenty Days march : We furnish ’d our selves 
with some Tents here, for the better accommodating our 
selves in the Night ; and the Leader of the Caravan, pro- 
VOL. Ill o 



1 94 Farther Adventures o/ R obinson Crusoe 
cured sixteen Carriages or Waggons of the Country, for 
carrying our Water and Provisions, and theSe Carriages 
were our Defence every Night round our little Camp ; so 
that had the Tartars appeared, unless they had been very 
numerous indeed, they would not have been able to hurt 
us. 

We may well be supposed to wai\t Reft again after this 
long Journey ; for in this Desart we saw neither House or 
Tree, or scarce a Bush ; we saw abundance of the Sable- 
Hunters, as they call’d them : These are all Tartars of the 
Mong^ul Tartary, of which this Country is a part, and they 
frequently attack small Caravans, but we saw no Num- 
bers of them together : I was curious to see the Sable Skins 
they catched, but could never speak with any of them, for 
they durft not come near us, neither durft we ftraggle 
from our Company, to go near them. 

After we had pass’d this Desart, we came into a Coun- 
try pretty well inhabited ; that is to say, we found Towns 
and Caftles, settled by the Czar of Muscovy, with Garri- 
sons of Stationary Soldiers to proteft the Caravans, and 
defend the Country againft the Tartars, who would other- 
wise make it very dangerous travelling; and his Czarisp 
Majefty has given such ftrift Orders for the well guard- 
ing the Caravans and Merchants, that if there are any 
Tartars heard of in the Country, Detachments of the Gar- 
risons are always sent to see the Travellers safe from Sta- 
tion to Station. 

And thus the Governour oiAdinskoy, who I had Op- 
portunity to make a Visit to, by means of the Scots Nlii^ 
chant who was acquainted with him, <jiFer’d us a Gwrd 
of fifty Men, if we thought there was any Danger to the 
next Station. 

I thought long before this, that as we came nearer to 



Farther Adventures 0/ Robinson Crusoe 195 

Europe we should find the Country better peopled, and 
the People more civliz’d, but I found my self mi^aken in 
both, for we had yet the Nafion of the 'Tongueses to pass 
through; where we saw the same Tokens of Paganism 
and Barbarity, or worse, than before, only as they were 
conquer’d by the Muscovites^ and entirely reduc’d, they 
were not so dangerous ; but for Rudeness of Manners, 
Idolatry, and Multitheism no People in the World ever 
went beyond them: They are cloath’d alj in Skins of 
Bealls, and their Houses are built of the same : You know 
not aMan from a Woman, neither by the Ruggedness of 
their Countenances or their Cloaths ; and in the Winder, 
when the Ground is cover’d with Snow, they live under 
Ground in Houses like Vaults, which have Cavities go- 
ing from one to another. 

If the Tartars had their Cham-Chi-Tongu for a whole 
Village or Country, these had Idols in every Hutt and in 
every Cave ; besides, they worship the Stars, the Sun, the 
Water, the Snow, and in a word, every thing that they do 
not under^nd, and they underhand but very little; so 
that almost every Element, every uncommon thing, sets 
them a sacrificing. 

But I am no more to describePeople thanCountries, any 
farther than my own Story comes to be concerned in them : 

I met with nothing peculiar to my self in this all Coun- 
try, which I reckon was from the Desart which I spoke of 
la^t, at leaft 400 Miles, h%lf of it being another Desart, 
which took us up twelve Days severe travelling, without 
House, or Tree, or Bush, but were oblig’d again to carry 
our own Provisions, as well Water as Bread. After we 
were out of this Desart, and had travell’d two Days, we 
came to Janezay^ a Muscovite City or Station, on the great 
River Janezay: this River they told us parted Europe 



196 Farther Adventures of ^ obinson Crusoe 

from Asia, tho’ our Map-makers, as I am told, do not 
agree to it; however, it is certainly the Eastern Boundary 
of the ancient Siberia, which now makes up a Province 
only of the va^f Muscovite Empire, but is it self equal in 
Bigness to the whole Empire of Germany. 

And yet here I observ’d Ignorance and Paganism ilill 
prevail’d, except in the Muscovite Garrisons ; all the Coun- 
try between the River Oby and the River Janezay is as en- 
tirely Pagan, and the People as barbarous, as the remotest 
of the Tartars, nay, as any Nation for ought I know in 
Asia, or America: I also found, which I observ’d to the 
Muscovite Governours who I had Opportunity to con- 
verse with, that the poor Pagans are not much the wiser 
or the nearer Chriftianity for being under the Muscovite 
Government ; which they acknowledg’d wastrueenough, 
but, as they said, was none of their Business : That if the 
Czar expefted to convert his Siberian, or Tonguese, or 
Subjefts, it should be done by sending Clergymen 
among them, not Soldiers ; and they added, with more 
Sincerity than I expefted, that they found it was not so 
much the Concern of their Monarch to make the People 
Christians, as it was to make them Subjefts. 

From this River to the great River Oby, we cross’d a 
wild uncultivated Country : I cannot say ’tis a barren Soil ; 
’tis only barren of People, and good Management, other- 
wise it is in itself a moSl pleasant, fruitful and agreeable 
Country : What Inhabitants we found in it are all Pagans, 
except such as are sent among them from Russia ; for this 
is the Country I mean on both Sides the River Oby, whi- 
ther the Muscovite Criminals, that are*iiot put to Death, 
are banish’d, and from whence it is next to impossible 
they should ever come away. 

I have nothing material to say of my particular Affairs,. 



Farther Adventures o/RobinsonCrusoe 197 

till I came to Tobolski, the Capital City of Siberia, where I 
continued iome time on the following Occasion. 

We had been now almo^ Seven Months on our Jour- 
ney, and Winter began to come on apace ; whereupon my 
Partner and I call’d a Council about our particular Af- 
fairs, in which we found it proper, considering that we 
were bound for Eng^nd, and not for Muscow, to consider 
how to dispose of our selves : They told us of Sledges and 
Rane Deer to carry us over the Snow in the Winter time ; 
and indeed they have such things, that it would be incre- 
dible* to relate the Particulars of, by which means the 
Russians travel more in the Winter than they can in Sum- 
mer, because in these Sleds they are able to run Night and 
Day ; the Snow being frozen, is one universal Covering 
to Nature, by which the Hills, the Vales, the Rivers, the 
Lakes, all are smooth, and hard as a Stone, and they run 
upon the Surface, without any regard to what is under- 
neath. 

But I had no occasion to push at a Winter Journey of 
this kind: I was bound to England, not to Muscow, and 
my Rout lay two ways, either I mu^f go on as the Caravan 
"VYcnt till I came to Jeroslaw, and then go off Weft for 
Narva, and the Gulph of Finland ; and so either by Sea or 
Land to Dantzick, where I might possibly sell my China 
Cargo to good Advantage, or I muft leave the Caravan at 
a little Town on the Dwina, from whence I had but six 
Days by Water to Arch-Amel, and from thence might be 
%\xrto{^\i\Y^vci^,Q\^&[\.oEngland,Holland,oxHafnburgb. 

Now to go any of these Journeys in the Winter, would 
ha’ been prepoft«:rous; for as to Dantzick, the Baltick 
would be frozen up, and I could not get Passage, and to 
go by Land in those Countries, was far less safe than 
among the Mongul Tartars-, likewise to go to Arch- Angel 



198 Farther Adventures ^RobinsonCrusoe 

in O£lober, all the Ships would be gone from thence, and 
even the Merchants who dwell there in Summer, retire 
South to Muscow in the Winter when the Ships are gone ; 
so that I should have nothing but Extremity of Cold to 
encounter, with a Scarcity of Provisions, and mu^ lie 
there in an empty Town all the Winter : so that upon the 
whole I thought it much my better way to let the Caravan 
go, and to make Provision to Winter where I was, (wz.) at 
Tobolski in Siberia, in the Latitude of[sixty]Degrees, where 
I was sure of tliroe Things to wear out a cold Winter with, 
(w2.)J^lenty of Provision such as the Country afforded; 
a wg.rm House, with Fuel enough, and excellent Com- 
pany ; of all which I shall give a full Account in its Place. 

I was now in a quite different Climate from my belov’d 
Island, where I never felt Cold except when I had my 
Ague; on the contrary, I had much to do to bear any 
Cloaths on my Back, and never made any Fire but with- 
out Doors, and for my necessity in dressing my Food, 
Now I made me three good Vefts, with large Robes 
or Gowns over them to hang down to the Feet,and button 
close to the Wri^s, and all these lin’d with Furs to make 
them sufficiently warm. 

As to a warm House, I mu^ confess I greatly dislik’d 
our way in England of making Fires in every Room in the 
House, in open Chimneys, which when the Fire was out, 
always kept the Air in the Room cold as the Climate : But 
taking an Appartment in a good House in the Town, I 
order’d a Chimney to be built like a Furnace, in the Cen- 
ter of six several Rooms, like a Stove, the Funnel to carry 
the Smoak went up one Way, the Dosr to come at the 
Fire, went in another, and all the Rooms were kept equal- 
ly warm, but no Fire seen ; ju^ as they heat the Bagnios 
in England. 



Farther Adventures o/RobinsonCrusoe 199 

By this means we had always the same Climate in all 
the RoomS, and an equal Heat was preserv’d; and how 
cold soever it was without •it was always warm within, 
and yet we saw no Fire, nor was ever incommoded with 
any Smoke. 

The mo^t wonderful thing of all was, that it should be 
possible to meet with good Company here, in a Country 
so barbarous as that of the mo^l Northerly Parts of Eur- 
ope, near the frozen Ocean, and within but a very few De- 
grees of Nova Zetnbla. 

But this being the Country where the State Criminals 
of Muscovy, as I observ’d before, are all banish’d, this City 
was full of Noblemen, Princes, Gentlemen, Colonels, and 
in short, all Degrees of the Nobility, Gentry, Soldiery and 
Courtiers of Muscovy: Here was the famous Prince Gal- 
liozen, the old General RoboUiski, and several other Per- 
sons of note, and some Ladies. 

By means of my Scots Merchant, who nevertheless I 
parted with here, I made an Acquaintance here with 
several of these Gentlemen, and some of them of the firil 
Rank, and from these in the long Winter Nights in which 
.1 flay’d here, I receiv’d several very agreeable Visits : It 
was talking oneNight with Prince one of the ban- 

ish’d Mini^tersof State, belonging to the Czar of Muscovy, 
that my Talk of my particular Case began : He had been 
telling me abundance of fi ne Things of the Greatness, the 
Magnificence, the Dominions, and the absolute Power of 
the Emperor of the Russians. I interrupted him, and told 
him I was a greater and more powerful Prince than ever 
the Czar of Muscovy 'vrzs, tho’ my Dominions were not so 
large, or my People so many. The Russian Grandee look’d 
a little surpriz’d, and fixing his Eyes ^leddily upon me, 
began to wonder what I meant. 



200 Farther Adventures 0/ Robinson Crusoe 

/ told him., his Wonder would cease when I had ex- 
plain’d myself: Firft, 1 told him, I had the absolute Dis- 
posal of the Lives and Fortuities of all my Subjects : That 
notwithftanding my absolute Power, I had not one Per- 
son disaffefted to my Government, or to my Person, in all 
my Dominions. He shook his Head at that, and said, there 
indeed I outdid the Czar of Muscovy. I told him, That all 
the Lands in my Kingdom were my own, and all my Sub- 
jeds were not only my Tenants, but Tenants at Will: 
That they would ^11 fight for me to the laft Drop ; and that 
ntv&cTyrint, for such I acknowledged myself to be, was ever 
so universally beloved, and yet so horribly feared by his 
Subjefts. 

After amusing them with these Riddles in Government 
for a while, I open’d the Case, and told them the Story at 
large of my living in the Island, and how I managed both 
myself and the People there that were under me, ju^ as I 
have since minuted it down. They were exceedingly taken 
with the Story, and especially the Prince, who told me 
with a Sigh, that the true Greatness of Life was to be Mas ■ 
ter of our selves : That he would not have exchanged such 
a State of Life as mine, to have been Czar of Muscovy ; and, 
that he found more Felicity in the Retirement he seem’d 
to be banish’d to there, than ever he found in the highest 
Authority he enjoy’d in the Court of his Ma^er the Czar : 
That the Heighth of human Wisdom was to bring our 
Tempers down toour Circumstances ; andtomakeaCalm 
within, under the Weight of the greatest Scorns without. 
When he came firSt hither, he said he used to tear the 
Hair from his Head, and the Cloaths fijjm his Back, as* 
others had done before him; but a little Time and Con- 
sideration had made him look into himself, as well as 
round him to things without : That he found the Mind of 



Farther Adventures 0/ R o b i n s o n Crusoe 20i 

Man, if it was but once brought to reflect upon the State 
of universal Life, and how little this World was concern’d 
in its true Felicity, was perfoftly capable of making a Fe- 
licity for itself, fully satisfying to itself, and suitable to its 
own beft Ends and Desires, with but very little Assistance 
from the World : That Air to breath in. Food to suStain 
Life, Clcfaths for Warmth, and Liberty for Exercise in 
order to Health, compleated, in his Opinion, all that the 
World could do for us ; and tho’ the Greatness, the Au- 
thority, the Riches, and the Pleasures which some enjoy’d 
in the World, and which he had enjoy’d his Share of, had 
much in them that was agreeable to us; yet he observ’d 
that all those things chiefly gratify’d the coarseSt df our 
AfFedtions, such as our Ambition, our particular Pride, 
our Avarice, our Vanity, and our Sensuality; all which 
were indeed the meer Produdl of the worSl part of Man, 
were in themselves Crimes, and had in them the Seeds of 
all manner of Crimes, but neither were related to, or con- 
cern’d with any of those Virtues that constituted us wise 
Men, or of those Graces which distinguish’d us as Chris- 
tians : That being now deprived of all the fancy’d Felicity 
which he enjoy’d in the full Exercise of all those Vices, he 
said he was at leisure to look upon the dark Side of them, 
where he found all manner or Deformity, and was now 
convinced, that Virtue only makes a Man truly wise, rich 
and great, and preserves him in the way to a superior 
Happiness in a future State. And in this he said) they 
were more happy in thei^ Banishment than all their Ene- 
mies were, who had the full Possession of all the Wealth 
and Power that ^ey (the Banish’d) had left behind them. 

Nor, Sir, says he, do I bring my Mind to this politi- 
cally, by the Necessity of my Circum^ances, which.some 
call miserable ; but if I know any thing of my self, I would 



201 Farther Adventures 0/ Robinson Crusoe 

not now go back, tho’ the Czar, my Mailer, should call 
me, and re-in^ate me in all my former Granddur ; I say, I 
would no more go back to it,%han I believe my Soul, when 
it shall be deliver’d from this Prison of the Body, and has 
had aTa^e of the glorious State beyond Life, would come 
back to the Jayl of Flesh and Blood it is now enclos’d in, 
and leave Heaven to deal in the Dirt ?ind Crime of human 
Affairs. 

He spoke this with so much Warmth in his Temper,so 
much Earne^he^s and Motion of his Spirits, which were 
apparent in his Countenance, that it was evident ifwas 
the true Sense of his Soul : There, was no room to doubt 
his Sincerity. 

I told him, I once thought my self a kind of a Monarch 
in my old Station, of which I had given him an Account, 
but that I thought he was not a Monarch only, but a great 
Conqueror ; for that he that has got a Victory over his own 
exorbitant Desires, and has the absolute Dominion over 
himself, whose Reason entirely governs his Will, is cer- 
tainly greater than he that conquers a City. But, my Lord, 
said /, shall I take the Liberty to ask youaQueftionPWith 
all my Heart, says he. If the Door of your Liberty was. 
open’d, said /, would you not take hold of it to deliver 
your self from this Exile. 

Hold, said he, your Question is subtle, and requires 
some serious juftDi^linftions, to giveitasincere Answer ; 
and I ’ll give it you from the Bottom of my Heart. Nothing 
that I know of in this World would move me to deliver 
my self from this State of Banishment, except these two, 
Fir^l, the Enjoyment of my Relations, ^nd Secondly, ar 
little warmer Climate; but I proteft to you, that to go 
back Jto the Pomp of the Court, the Glory, the Power, the 
Hurry of a Minister of State, the Wealth, the Gaiety, and

the Pleasures, that is to say, Follies of a Courtier; if my 
Maftershhuldsendme Word this Moment, that he re- 
veres me to all he banish’d tne from; I protect. If I know 
my self at alf I would not leave this Wilderness, these De- 
sarts, and these frozen Lakes, for the Palace at Muscow. 

But, my Lord, said I, perhaps you notonly are banish’d 
from the Pleasures q f the Court, and from the Power, and 
Authority, and Wealth you enjoy’d before, but you may 
be absent too from some of the Conveniences of Life, 
your E^ate perhaps confiscated and ypuV Effefts plun- 
der'd, and the Supplies left you here may not be suitable 
to the ordinary Demands of Life. 

Ay, says he, that is as you suppose me to be a Lord, or a 
Prince, (dc. So indeed I am ; but you are now to consider 
me only as a Man, a human Creature, not at all distin- 
guish’d from another, and so I can suffer no Want, unless 
I should be visited with Sickness and DiSlempers. How- 
ever, to put the Question out of Dispute ; you see our 
Manner; we are in this Place five Persons of Rank, we 
live perfeftly retir’d, as suited to a State of Banishment; 
we have something rescu’d from the Shipwreck of our 
.Fortunes, which keeps us from the meer Necessity of 
hunting for our Food ; but the poor Soldiers who are here, 
without that Help, live in as much Plenty as we, who go 
into the Woods and catch Sables and Foxes ; the Labour 
of a Month will maintain them a Year ; and as the Way of 
living is not expensive, so it is not hard to get sufficient to 
our selves. So that Obje&ion is out of Doors. 

I have not room to give a full Account of the mo^l agree- 
able Conversatjpn I had with this truly great Man ; in all 
which he shew’d, that his Mind was so inspir’d with a 
superior Knowledge of Things, so supported by Religion, 
as well as by a vaft Share of Wisdom ; that his Contempt 



i 04 Farther Adventures 0/ Robinson Crusoe 

of the World was really as much as he had express’d, and 
that he was always the same to the laft, as wilf appear in 
the Story I am going to tell. * 

I had been here 8 Months, and a dark dreadful Winter 
I thought it to be, the Cold so intense, that I could not so 
much as look abroad without being wrapt in Furs, and a 
Mask of Fur before my Face, or rather a Hood with only 
a Hole for Breath, and two for Sight : The little Day-light 
we had, was, as we reckon’d, for three Months, not above 
five Hours a day, and six at mo^t ; only that the Snow ly- 
ing on the Ground continually, and the Weather clear, it 
was ne'^^er quite dark : Our Horses were kept (or rather 
^arvM) under Ground, and as for our Servants, for we 
hir’d three Servants here to look after our Horses and 
selves, we had every now and then their Fingers and Toes 
to thaw and take care of, le^ they should mortify and fall 
off. 

It is true, within Doors we were warm, the Houses be- 
ing close, the Walls thick, the Lights small, and the Glass 
all double ; our Food was chiefly the Flesh of Deer dry’d 
and cur’d in the Season ; good Bread enough, but bak’d 
as Biskets ; dry’d Fish of several Sorts, and some Flesh of . 
Mutton, and of the Buffeloes, which is pretty good Beef : 
All the Stores of Provision for the Winter are laid up in 
the Summer, and well cur’d ; our Drink was Water mix’d 
with Aqua-vitae instead of Brandy, and for a Treat, Mead 
instead of Wine,* which, however, they have excellent 
good: The Hunters, who venture abroad all Weathers, 
frequently brought us in fresh Venison, very fat and good, 
and sometimes Bears Flesh, but we did npt much care for* 
the laft: We had a good Stock of Tea, with which we 
treated our Friends, as above; and in a word, we liv’d 
very chearfully and well, all things consider’d. 



Farther Adventures 0/ Robinson Crusoe 20^ 
* It was now March, and the Days grown considerably 
longer, and the Weather, at lea^l, tolerable, so the other 
Travellers began to prepare Sleds to carry them over the 
Snow, and to get things ready to be going ; but my Mea- 
sures being fix’d, as I have said, for Arch-Angel, and not 
for Muscovy or the Baltick, I made no Motion ; knowing 
very well that the Ships from the South do not set out for 
that Part of the World till May or June, and that if I was 
there by the beginning of Augu§l, it would be as soon as 
any Ships would be ready to go away,; and therefore, I 
say* I made no haile to be gone, as others did ; in a word, 
I saw a great many People, nay, all the Travellers go away 
before me: It seems every Year they go from thence to 
Muscow for Trade, (viz.) to carry Furs, and buy Neces- 
saries with them, which they bring back to furnish their 
Shops ; also others went of the same Errand to Arch- Angel, 
but then they also being to come back again above 800 
Miles, went all out before me. 

In short, about the latter End of May I began to make 
all ready to pack up ; and as I was doing this, it occur’d to 
me, that seeing all these People were banish’d by the Czar 
• of Muscovy to Siberia, and yet when they came there, were 
left at Liberty to go whither they would ; why did they not 
then go away to any Part of the World where ever they 
thought fit, and I began to examine what should hinder 
them from making such an Attempt. 

But my Wonder washover, when I ifenter’d upon that 
Subjeft with the Person I have mention’d, who answer’d 
me thus : Consider, Fir^, Sir, said he, the jPlace where we 
are; and Secondly, the Condition we are in; especially, 
said he, the Generality of the People who are banish’d 
hither ; we are surrounded, said he, with Wronger Things 
than Bars and Bolts; on the North Side an unnavigable 



2o 6 Farther Adventures of '^ 0^1 os Crusoe 

Ocean, where Ship never sail’d, and Boat never swan?; 
neither, if we had both, could we know whertf to go with 
them : Every other Way, said he, we have above a Thou- 
sand Miles to pass through the Czar’s own Dominions, 
and By-Ways utterly unpassable, except by the Roads 
made by the Governour, and by the Towns garrison’d by 
his Troops ; so that we could neither pass undiscover’d by 
the Road, or subsist any other Way, so that it is in vain to 
attempt it. 

I was silenc’d ipdeed at once, and found that they were 
in a Prison, every Jot as secure as if they had been lock’d 
up in the Caille at Muscow\ however, it came into my 
Thought, that I might certainly be made an In^rument 
to procure the Escape of this excellent Person, and that 
whatever Hazard I run, I would certainly try if I could 
carry him off. Upon this I took an Occasion one Evening 
to tell him my Thoughts : I represented to him, that it 
was very easy for me to carry him away, there being no 
Guard over him in the Country, and as I was not going to 
Muscow, but to Arch-Angel^ and that I went in the nature 
of a Caravan, by which I was not oblig’d to lye in the 
stationary Towns intheDesart, but could encamp every . 
Night where I would, we might easily pass uninterrupted 
to Arch- Angela where I would immediately secure him on 
Board an English or Dutch Ship, and carry him off safe 
along with me ; and as to his Subsistence, and other Par- 
ticulars, it should be my Care till he could better supply 
himself. 

He heard me very attentively, and look’d earnestly on 
me all the while I spoke ; nay, I could see pi his very Face,* 
that what I said put his Spirits into an exceeding Ferment ; 
his Cqjour frequently chang’d, his Eyes look’d red, and 
his Heart flutter’d, that it might be even perceiv’d in his 



Farther Adventures o/'Robinson Crusoe 207 
Countenance; nor could he immediately answer me, 
when I had done, and as it were expeded what he would 
say to it ; but after he had pau»’ d alittle he embrac’d me, and 
said, how unhappy are we unguarded Creatures as we are, 
that even our greated Ads of Friendship are made Snares 
to us, and we are made Tempters of one another! My 
dear Friend, said he, your Offer is so sincere, has such 
Kindness in.it, is so disintereded in it self, and is so calcu- 
lated for my Advantage, that I mud have very little Know- 
ledge of the World, if I did not both wonder at it, and ac- 
knowledge the Obligation I have upon me to you for it. 
But did you believe I was sincere in what I have so often 
said to you of my Contempt of the World? Did ydti be- 
lieve I spoke my very Soul to you, and that I had really ob- 
tain’d that Degree of Felicity here, that had plac’d me 
above all that the World could give me, or do for me? Did 
you believe I was sincere, when I told you I would not go 
back, if I was re-call’d even to be all, that once I was in ^e 
Court with the Favour of the Czar my Mader? Did you 
believe me, my Friend, to be an honed Man, or did you 
think me to be a boading Hypocrite? Here he dopp’d, as 
.if he would hear what I would say, but indeed, I soon after 
perceiv’d, that he dopp’d because his Spirits were in Mo- 
tion, his great Heart was full of Struggles, and he could 
not go on. I was, I confess, adonish’d at the thing as well 
as at the Man, and I us’d some Arguments with him to 
urge him to set himself free : That he ought to look upon 
this as a Door open’d by Heaven for his Deliverance, and 
a Summons by Providence, who has the Care and Dispo- 
sition of all Evgnts, to do himself good, and to render 
himself useful in the World. 

He had by this time recover’d himself : How dg you 
know Sir, says he warmly, that indead of a Summons 



2o8 Farther Adventures 0/ Robinson Crusoe 

from Heaven, it may not be a Feint of another In^iS- 
ment? R^resenting in all the alluring Colour's to me the 
Shew of Felicity as a Delivefance, which may in itself bc 
my Snare, and tends direftly to my Ruin ; Here I am fre^, 
from the Temptation of returning to my former miserable*] 
Greatness ; there I am not sure but that all the Seeds c^i 
Pride, Ambition, Avarice and Luxury, which I know re- 1 
main in Nature, may revive and take Root, and in a Word^tl 
again overwhelm me, and then the happy Prisoner,. wW 
you see now Ma.'fter of his Soul’s Liberty, shal l b e. the 
miserable Slave of his own Senses, in the Full of all Jjer- 
soiiai Lliberty : Dear Sir, let me remain in this blessed Con- 
fineifient, banish’d from the Crimes of Life, rather than 

P urchase a Shew of Freedom, at the Expence of the Li- 
erty of my Reason, and at the Expence of the future 
Happiness which now I have in my View, but shall then, 

I fear, quickly lose Sight of ; for I am but Flesh, a Man, a 
meer Man, have Passions and AfFeftions as likely to po'S- 
sess and overthrow me as any Man : O be not my Friend 
and my Tempter both togeAer! 

If I was surpriz’d before, I was quite dumb now, and 
^lood silent, looking at him, and indeed admir’d at what 
I saw; the Struggle in his Soul was so great, that tho’ the 
Weather was extreamly cold, it put him into a mo^l vio- 
lent Sweat, and I found he wanted to give Vent to his 
Mind ; so I said a Word or two, that I would leave him to 
consider of it, and wait on him a^ain, and then I withdrew 
to my own Apartment, 

About two Hours after I heard some Body at, or near, 
the Door of my Room, and I was going tQOpen the Dobr, 
but he had open’d it, and came in : My dear Friend, says 
he, you had almost overset me, but I am recover’d ; do not 
take it ill that I do not close with your Offer, I assure you. 



Farther Adventures o/'Robinson Crusoe 209 

;Kis not for want of a Sense of the Kindness of it in you, 
^and I canffe to make the moil sincere Acknowledgment 
jof it to you; but I hope I h&ve got the Vidlory over my 
' self. 

My Lord, said /, I hope you are fully satisfy’d that you 
do not resiil the Call of Heaven. Sir, said he, if it had been 
from Heaven, the sjime Power would have influenc’d me 
to accept it; but I hope, and am fully satisfy’d, that it is 
v from Heaven that I decline it, and I have an infinite Satis- 
ifaflion in the Parting, that you shall l€;^vfe me an honeil 
Mscn ilill, tho’ not a free Man. 

I had nothing to do but to acquiesce, and make Pro- 
fessions to him of my having no End in it, but a sihcere 
Desire to serve him : He embrac’d me very passionately, 
and assur’d me, he was sensible of that, and should always 
acknowledge it, and with that he offer’d me a very fine 
Present of Sables, too much indeed for me to accept from 
a Man in his Circumstances, and I would have avoided 
them, but he would not be refus’d. 

The next Morning I sent my Servant to his Lordship, 
with a small Present of Tea, and two Pieces of China Da- 
.mask, and four little Wedges of Japan Gfold, which did 
not all weigh above six Ounces, or thereabout, but were 
far short of the Value of his Sables, which, indeed, when I 
came to England^ I found worth near 200/. He accepted 
the Tea, and one Piece of the Damask, and one of the 
Pieces of Gold, which had a fine Stamp upon it, of the 
Japan Coinage, which I fbund he took for the Rarity of it, 
but would not take any more, and he sent word by my 
Servant that he^desir’d to speak with me. 

When I came to him, he told me, I knew what had pass ’d 
between us, and hop’d I would not move him anymore 
in that Affair ; but that since I had made such a generous 
VOL. in p 



2 lo Farther Adventures 0/ Robinson Crusoe 

Offer to him, he ask’d me, if I had Kindness enough fo 
offer the same to another Person that he would name to 
me, in whom he had a great ^are of Concern ; I tol d him, 
that I could not say I enclin’d to do so much for any one 
but himself, for whom I had a particular Value, and should 
have been glad to have been the Inurnment of his De- 
liverance; however, if he would please to name the Per- 
son to me, I would give him my Answer, and hop’d he 
would not be displeased with me, if he was with my An- 
swer ; he told me, it was only his Son, who, tho’ I had not 
seen, yet was in the same Condition with himself, *and 
above two hundred Miles from him, on the other side the 
fbut that if I consented, he would send for him. 

I made no Hesitation, but told him I would do it: I 
made some Ceremony in letting him understand that it 
was wholly on his Account, and that seeing I could not 
prevail on him, I would shew my Respeft to him, by my 
Concern for his Son ; but these Things are too tedious to 
repeat here : He sent away the next Day for his Son, and 
in about twenty Days he came back with the Messenger, 
bringing six or seven Horses, loaded with very rich Furs, 
and which in the whole, amounted to a very great Value.. 

His Servants brought the Horses into ^e Town, but 
left the young Lord at a Distance, till Night, when he 
came incognito into our Apartment, and his Father pre- 
sented him to me; and in short, we concerted there the 
manner of our trkvelling, and every Thing proper for the 
Journey. 

I had bought a considerable Quantity of Sables, black 
Fox Skins, fiim Ermines, and such othei;,Furs as are veiy 
rich; I say, I had bought them in that City in Exchange 
for ‘some of the Goods I brought from China ; in particu- 
lar for the Cloves and Nutmegs, of which, I sold the 



Farther Adventures of I m son Crusoe an 
ftreate^ Part here, and the reil afterwards at Arch-Angel.^ 
IramudibetterPrice than I could have done at London \ 
bd my Partner who was serfsible of the Profit, and whose 
Business more particularly than mine was Merchandize, 
was mightily pleas’d with our Stay, on Account of the 
Traffick we made here. 

It was the beginning of fune., when I left this remote 
Place, a City; I believe, little heard of in the World; and 
Indeed it is so far out of the Road of Commerce, that I 
know not how it should be much talk’d of. We were now 
come to a very small Caravan, being only thirty tiyo Hor- 
ses and Camels in all, and all of them pass’d for mine, tho’ 
my new Gue^l was Proprietor of eleven of them;*t was 
moft natural also that I should take more Servants with 
me than I had before, and the young Lord pass’d for my 
Steward; what great Man I pass’d for my self, I know 
not, neither did it concern me to enquire; we had here, 
the worft and the larged Desart to pass over that we met 
with in all the Journey ; indeed I call it the worft, because 
the Way was very deep in some Places, and very uneven 
in others ; the be^ we had to say for it, was, that we thought 
we had no Troops of "Tartars and Robbers to fear, and 
that they never came on this Side the River Oby, or at 
lea^l, but very seldom, but we found it otherwise. 

My young Lord had with him, a faithful Muscovite 
Servant, or rather a Siberian Servant, who was perfeftly 
acquainted with the Country, and led us by private Roads, 
that we avoided coming in to the principal Towns and 
Cities, upon the great Road, such as Tumen^ Soly-Kcfmskoi, 
and several others ; because the Muscovite Garrisons wh ich 
are kept there, are very curious and ilrift in their Obser- 
vation upon Travellers; and searching lea^ any ®f the 
banish’d Persons of Note should make their Escape that 



212 Farther Adventures of hi Vi sot! Crusoe 
Way into Muscovy\ but by this Means, as we were ke^t 
out of the Cities, so our whole Journey was a Desart, and 
we were oblig’d to encamp aild lye in our Tents, when we 
might have had very good Accommodation in the Cities 
on the Way : This the young Lord was so sensible of, that 
he would not allow us to lye abroad, when we came to 
several Cities, on the Way, but lay abroad himself with 
his Servant in the Woods, and met us always at the 
appointed Places. 

We were ju^t enter’d Europe^ having pass’d the River 
Kama ^ , which in these Parts, is the Boundary betv^een 
Europe and Asia, and the fir^i City on th& European Side 
was call’d Soloy-Kamaskoy, which is as much as to say, the 
great City, on the River Kama-, and here we thought to 
have seen some evident Alteration in the People, their 
Manner, their Habit, their Religion, and their Business; 
but we were mi^aken, for as we had a vail Desart to pass, 
which by Relation, is near seven hundred Miles long in 
some Places, but not above two hundred M iles over where 
we pass’d it ; so ’till we came pa^ that horrible Place, we 
found very little Difference between that Country and 
the Mogul T artary the People, mo^ly Pagans, and little, 
better than the Savages of America, their Houses and 
Towns full of Idols, and their Way of Living, wholly bar- 
barous, except in the Cities as above, and the Villages 
near them; where they are Christians as they call them- 
selves, of the Griek Church, but have their Religion min- 
gled with so many Reliques of Superstition, that it is 
scarce to be known in some Places from meer Sorcery and 
Witchcraft. , * 

In passing this ForreSt, I thought indeed we muSt, af- 
ter all our Dangers were in our Imagination escap’d, as 
before, have been plunder’d and robb’d, and perhaps 



Farther Adventures of'^o^i}ison Crusoe 213 
ftiurther’d by a Troop of Thieves ; of what Country they 
were, whether the roving Bands of the Oiliachi, a Kind of 
T artars or wild People on the Bank of the Obi^ had rang’d 
thus far, or whether they were the Sable-Hunters of Si- 
beria^ I am yet at a Loss to know; but they were all on 
Horseback, carry’d Bows and Arrows, and were at fir^l 
about five and forty in Number ; they came so near to us, 
as within about two Musquet-Shot, and asking no Ques- 
tions, they surrounded us with their Horse, and look’d 
very earnestly upon us twice; at length they plac’d them- 
selves ju^ in our Way, upon which, we drew up in a little 
Line before ouh Camels, being not above sixteen Men in 
all ; and being drawn up thus, we halted and sent Cut the 
Siberian Servant, who attended his Lord, to see who they 
were ; his Mailer was the more willing to'let him go, be- 
cause he was not a little apprehensive, that they were a 
Syberian Troop sent out after him: The Man came up 
' near them with a Flag of Truce, and call ’d them, but tho’ 
he spoke several of their Languages or Dialefts of Lan- 
guages rather, he could not underlfanda Word they said; 
however, after some Signs to him, not to come nearer to 
. them at his Peril ; so he said, he underwood them to mean 
offering to shoot at him if he advanc’d ; the Fellow came 
back no wiser than he went, only that by their Dress, he 
said, he believ’d them to be some Tartars of Kalmuck^ or 
of the Circassian Hoords ; and that there muft be more of 
them upon the great Desart, tho’ he ne^er heard that any 
of them ever were seen so far North before. 

This was small Comfort to us ; however, we had no 
Remedy; therq was on our left Hand at about a Quarter 
of a Mile’s Distance, a little Grove or Clump of Trees 
which ifood close together, and very near the Road ; I 
immediately resolv’d we would advance to those Trees, 



214 Farther Adventures <?/ Robinson Crusoe 
and fortify our selves as well as we could there; for fir^ 
I considered, that the Trees would in a great Measure 
cover us from their Arrows, and in the next Place, they 
could not come to charge us in a Body ; it was indeed my 
old Portuguese Pilot who proposed it, and who had this 
Excellency attending him, namely, that he was always 
readied, and mo^ apt to direft and entourage us in Cases 
of the moft Danger ; we advanc’d immediately with what 
Speed we could, and gain’d that little Wood, the ‘Tartars 
or Thieves, for know not what to call them, keeping 
their Stand, and not attempting to hinder us; when Ve 
came thither, we found to our great Satisfaftion, that it 
was a swampy springy Piece of Ground, and on the one 
Side, a very great Spring of Water, which running oultin 
a little Rill or Brook, was a little farther, joyn’d by another 
of the like Bigness, and was in short, the Head or Source 
of a considerable River, call’d afterwards tht fVirtska ; the 
Trees which grew about this Spring, were not all above 
two hundred, but were very large, and ^ood pretty thick ; 
so that as soon as we got in, we saw our selves perfeftly 
safe from the Enemy, unless they alighted and attack’d 
us on Foot. 

But to make this more difficult, our Portugueze, with 
indefatigable Application, cut down great Arms of the 
Trees, and laid them hanging not quite cut off from one 
Tree to another, so that he made a continued Fence al- 
most round us. « 

We ilay’d here waiting the Mdtionofthe Enemy some 
Hours, without perceiving they made any Motion ; when 
about two Hours before Night, they cam^ down direftly 
upon us, and tho’ we had not perceiv’d it, we found they 
had been join’d by some more of the same, so that they 
were near fourscore Horse, whereof however, we farfcy’d 



Farther Adventures of hi ^ SC'S Crusoe 215 

'stome were Women : They came on till they were within 
half Shot < 5 f our little Wood, when we fir’d one Musquet 
without Ball, and call’d to them in the Russian Tongue, to 
know what they wanted, and bid them keep off ; but as if 
they knew nothing of what we said, they came on with a 
double Fury direftly up to the Wood-side, not imagining 
we were so barricado’d that they could not break in ; our 
old Pilot w£is our Captain, as well as he had been our En- 
gineer, and desir’d of us not to fire upon them till they 
came within Pi^lol-Shot, and that we^ntight be sure to 
kill; and that when we did fire, we should be sure to take 
good Aim; we* bad him give the Word of Command, 
which he delay’d so long, that they were some o^them 
within two Pikes length of us when we fir’d. 

We aim’d so true, (or Providence direfted our Shot so 
sure) that we kill’d fourteen of them, and wounded seve- 
ral others, as also several of their Horses ; for we had all of 
•us loaded our Pieces with two or three Bullets at leaft. 

They were terribly surpriz’d with our Fire, and retreat- 
ed immediately about one Hundred Rods from us; in 
which Time, we loaded our Pieces again, and seeing them 
,keep that Diftance, we sally’d out and catch ’d four or five 
of their Horses, whose Riders we suppose were kill’d, 
and coming up to the dead, we could easily perceive they 
were Tartars, but knew not from what Country, or how 
they came to make an Excursion such an unusual Length. 

About an Hour after they made a Motion to attack us 
again, and rode round odr little Wood, to see where else 
they might break in ; but finding us always ready to face 
them, they wen^off again, and we resolv’d not to ^ir from 
the Place for that Night. 

We slept little you may be sure, but spent thg moft 
Part < 3 f the Night in ^Irengthning bur Situation, and bar- 



2i6 Farther Adventures of so V Crusoe 

ricadoing the Entrances into the Wood, and keeping^^ 
Watch, we waited for Day-Light, and wh%n it came, 
it gave us a very unwelcome Discovery indeed; for the 
Enemy, who we thought were discourag’d with the Re- 
ception they had met with, were now encreased to no less 
than three hundred, and had set uf» eleven or twelve Huts 
and Tents, as if they were resolv’d to besiege us ; and this 
little Camp they had pitch’d upon the open Plain, at about 
three Quarters of a Mile from us. We were indeed sur- 
priz’d at this Dis^povery; and now I confess, I gave my 
self over for lo^l, and all that I had : The Loss of my*Ef- 
fefts did not lye so near me, (tho' they wire very consider- 
able) Ss the Thoughts of falling into the Hands of such 
Barbarians, at th e latter End of my J ourney, after so many 
Difficulties and Hazards as I had gone thro’; and even 
in Sight of our Port, where we expefted Safety and De- 
liverance ; as for my Partner, he was raging ; he declar’d, 
that to lose his Goods would be his Ruin ; and he would* 
rather die than be starv’d ; and he was for fighting to the 
la^l Drop. 

Theyoung Lord, as gallant as ever Flesh shew’d it self, 
was for fighting to the la^l; also; and my old Pilot was of. 
the Opinion we were able to resist them all, in the Situa- 
tion we were then in; and thus we spent the Day in De- 
bates of what we should do; but towards Evening, we 
found that the Number of our Enemies ^ill encreas’d, 
perhaps as they f/ere abroad in several Parties for Prey; 
the firft had sent out Scouts to* call for Help, and to ac- 
quaint them of the Booty, and we did not know, but by 
the Morning they might ^till be a greater Number; so F 
began to enquire of those People We had brought from 
^oholski, if there was no other, or more private WaJ^s by 
which we might avoid them in the Night, and perhaps 



Farther Adventures o/RobinsonCrusoe 217 
either retreat to some Town, or get Help to guard us over 
the DesarP. 

The who was*Servant to the young Lord, 

told us, if we design’d to avoid them and not fight, he 
would engage to carry us off in the Night, to a '\^uy that 
went North towards the Petrou^ by which he made no 
Que^ion, but we might get away, and the Tartars never 
the wiser; but he said, his Lord had told him, he would 
not retreat, but would rather chuse to fight, I told him, he 
mi^ook his Lord, for that he was too wi^e a Man to love 
Fig*hting for the sake of it ; that I knew his Lord was brave 
enough by what he had shew’d already ; but that his Lord 
knew better, than to desire to have seventeen or eighteen 
Men fight five hundred, unless an unavoidable Necessity 
forc’d them to it ; and that if he thought it possible for us 
to escape in the Night, we had nothing else to do but to 
attempt it. He answer’d, if his Lord gave him such Or- 
*ders, he would lose his Life if he did not perform it; we 
soon brought his Lord to give that Order, tho’ privately, 
and we immediately prepar ’dfor the putting it in Praftice. 

And fir^t, as soon as it began to be dark, we kindled a 
, Fire in our little Camp, which we kept burning, and pre- 
par’d so as to make it burn all Night, that the Tartars 
might conclude we were ^ill there ; but as soon as it was 
dark, (that is to say) so as we could see the Stars (for our 
Guide would not ftir before) having all our Horses and 
Camels ready loaden, we followed our flew Guide, who I 
soon found Peer’d hims^f by the Pole, or North Star, all 
the Country being level for a long Way. . 

After we hadtravell’d two Hours very hard, it began 
to be lighter ftill, not that it was quite dark all Night, but 
the Moon began to rise, so that in short, it was.rather 
lighter than we wish’d it to be ; but by six a Clock the next 



2i8 Farther Adventures ^ 

Morning we were gotten near forty Miles, tho’ t^e 
Truth is, we almost spoil’d our Horses. Here we found a 
Russian Village named Ker^azinskoy, where we refted, 
and heard nothing of the Calmuck Tartars that Day ; about 
two Hours before Night we set out again, and travell’d 
till eight the next Morning, tho’ not quite so quick a*s be- 
fore, and about seven a Clock we pass’d a little River call’d 
Kirtza^ and came to a good large Town inhabited by Rus- 
sians, and very populous, call’d Ozomoys\ there we heard 
that several Troops or Hoords of Calmucks had been 
abroad upon the Desart, but that we were now compfeat- 
ly out of Danger of them, which was to our great Satisfac- 
tion you may be sure. Here we were oblig’d to get some 
fresh Horses, and having Need enough of Re^, we ftay’c. 
five Days ; and my Partner and I agreed to give the honest 
Syberian, who brought us thither, the Value of ten Pis- 
toles, for his conducting us. 

In five Days more we came to V euslima, upon the River* 
JVitzogda, and running into the Dwina, we were there 
very happily near thje end of our Travels by Land, that 
River being navigable in seven Days Passage to Arch- 
Angel: Fromhence we came to Lawrenskoy the 3d of July, • 
and providing our selves with two Luggage Boats, and a 
Barge for our own Convenience, we embark’d the 7th, 
and arriv’d all safe at Arch-Angel the 1 8th, having been a 
Year and five Months and three Days on the Journey, 
including our Sfay of eight Months and odd Days at 
Tobolski. 

We were oblig’d to ^lay at this Place six Weeks for the 
Arrival of the Ships, and mu^ have tarry’d longer, ha(f 
not a Hamburgher come in above a Month sooner than 
any of "the English Ships; when after some Consideration,

fBat the City of Hamburgh might happen to be as good a 
"Market fof our Goods as London, we all took Freight with 
him, and having put my Goftds on board, it was moft na- 
tural for me to put my Steward on board to take care of 
them, by which Aeans my young Lord had a sufficient 
Opportunity to conceal himself, never coming on Shore 
jn all the time we^^lay’d there; and this he did, that he 
/might not be seen in the City, where some of the Mus- 
cow Merchants would certainly have seen and discover’d 
him. 

We sailed from Arch-Angelxhs. 20th of August the same 
Year, and after’no extraordinary bad Voyage, arriv’d in 
the Elbe the r 3 th of September. Here my Partner*and I 
jbund a very good Sale for our Goods, as well those of 
China, as the Sables, iAc. of Syberia ; and dividing the Pro- 
duceofourEffedts, my Share amounted to 3475--1 
notwith^anding so many Losses we had sustain’d, and 
^Charges we had been at ; only remembring that I had in- 
cluded in this, about six hundred Pounds worth of Dia- 
monds which I had purchas’d at Bengal. 

Here the young Lord took his leave of us, and went up 
»the Elbe in order to go to the Court of Vienna, where he 
resolv’d to seek Protedlion, and where he could corre- 
spond with those of his Father’s Friends who were left 
‘ alive: He did not part without all the Te^limonies he 
could give me of Gratitude for the Service I had done him, 
and his Sense of my Kindness to the Pfince his Father. 

To conclude, having ^ay’d near four Months in Ham- 
burgh, I came from thence over Land to the Hague, where 
I embark’d in tlje Pacquet, and arriv’d in London the i oth 
of January, 1 705, having been gone from England ten 
Years and nine Months.
