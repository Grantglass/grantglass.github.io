IT was on a bright and glorious morning in '1'}
July that the great chieftain, Robert of the Red

thereafter 'to hold high revel in the halls of

This Robert of the Red Hand (more familiarly
known as Rob MacNicol, or even as plain Rob)
was an active, stout-sinewed, black-eyed lad of
seventeen, whose only mark of chieftainsnip, ap-
parently, was that, unlike his brothers, he wore
shoes and stockings; these three relatives con-
stituted his allies and kinsmen; the so-called
Spanish Main was in reality an arm of the sea,
better known in the Hebrides as Loch Scrone;
and the war-galley was an old, ramshackle, bat-
tered, and betarred boat, belonging generally to
the fishing-village of Erisaig, for, indeed, the boat
was so old and so battered that nobody now
seemed to claim any special ownership of it.

These four MacNicols--Robert, Neil, Nicol,
and Duncan--were, it must be admitted, an idle
and graceless set, living for the most part a
hand-to-mouth, amphibious, curlew-like kind of
life, and far more given to aimless voyages in
boats not belonging to them than inclined to
' turn their hand to any honest labor.

But this must be said in their excuse, that no
boy or lad born in the village of Erisaig could
by any means whatsoever be brought to think
of becoming anything else than a fisherman. It
was impossible to induce them to apprentice
themselves to any ordinary trade.

They would wait until they were old enough
to go after the herring, like the others: that was
man's work; that was something like; that was
different from staying ashore and twiddling one's
fingers over a pair of somebody else's shoes, or

laboriously shaping a block of sandstone for
somebody else's house.

This Rob MacNicol, for example: it was only
for want of a greater career that he had c'onsti-
tuted, himself a dreaded searover, a stern chief-
tain, etc., etc.

His secret ambition--his great and constant
and secret ambition--went far farther than that.
It was to be of man's estate, broad-shouldered

have a peaked cap (not forgetting a brass button
on each side by way of smartness); and then to
comealong in the afternoon, with a yellow oil-
skin tied up in a bundle, to the wharf where the
herring-fleet lay, the admiration and the envy
of all the miserable creatures condemned to stay
ashore.

In the mean time--in these days of joyous
idleness, while as yet the cares and troubles
which this history will have to chronicle were
far away from him and his, simply because they
were unknown--Rob MacNicol, if he could not
be a fisherman, could at least be an imaginary
chieftain, and in that capacity he gave his orders '
as one who knew how to make himself obeyed.

As soon as they had shoved the boat clear of
the smacks, the jib was promptly set; the big
lumps of stone that served for ballast were duly
shifted; the lug-sail, as black as pitch and full
of holes, was hoisted, and the halyards made
up to his thighs, and a blue flannel jersey; to

He earned a sort of living that way, and sel-

to beg for a herring or two for bait, when the
boats came in. He got the bait, but in an igno-
minious way; for the boys, stripping the nets,
generally saved up the "broken" herring, in or-
der to pelt Daft Sandy with the fragments when
he came near. That is to say, they indulged in
this amiable sport except when Rob MacNicol
happened to be about.

That youth had been heard to remark that the
first he caught at this game would pay a sudden
visit to the dead dog-fish lying beneath the clear
waters of the harbor; and it was very well

taking the law into his'own hands. '

rules and punishments, to which, it must be said,
he cheerfully submitted himself.

At the same time, he was aware that even the
most moral and high-principled government has
occasionally to assert itself with rude physical
force; and although his hand was not particular-
ly red, as might have been expected, it was un-
commonly hard, and a cuflE' from it was under-

effects in the region of the eye.

the old man said as they passed. "Tak' heed.
It's squally. outside."

There was no answer; for at this moment
the quick eye of the Chieftain detected one
of his kinsmen in the commission of a heinous
crime.

Tempted by the light and steady breeze, Nicol,
had given way to idleness, and had made faSt the
main-sheet, instead of holding it in his hand,
ready for all emergencies.

This, and not unnaturally, on such a squally
coast, Rob MacNicol had constituted an altogeth-
er unforgivable offence; and his first impulse was
to jump down to the stern of' the boat and give
the helmsman, caught in flagrante delicto, a sound-
ing whack on the side of the head. But a gravel-
sense of justice prevailed. He summoned a
court-martial.

Nicol, catching the eye of his brother, hastily
tried to undo the sheet from the pin; but it was
too late. The crime had been committed; there
the old man said as they passed. "Tak' heed.

also the jury.

The judge and jury forthwith pronounced sen-
tence: Nicol MacNicol to forfeit one penny to
the fund being secretly stored up for the pur-
chase of a set of bagpipes, or to be lowered by the

_ shoulders until his feet should touch the ground

in the dungeon of Eilean-na-Rona Castle.

He was left to decide which alternative he
"would accept; and it must be said that the cul-
prit, after a minute or two's sulking, perceived
the justice of the sentence, and calmly said he
would take the dungeon.

"Ye think I'm feared ?" he said, contemptuous-

' 1y, to Neil and Duncan, who were grinning at

him. "Wha Was it that gruppit the Whut-
teruck?* And is there anything worse than
Whutterucks in that hole in the castle?"

"I'll save the penny anyway," said Nicol, to

MacNicol's stringent sailing rules were a matter

smooth and blue around them, they were sailing
along as pleasantly as might be. But they had
scarcely got through the narrow channel leading
from the harbor, and were just emerging into
Loch Scrone, when a squall of wind came tearing
along and hit the boat so that the lug-sail was
almost flattened on to the water.

Rob to the frightened steersman.

Matters grew worse. It was no use trying
merely to keep her head to the wind, for she was
drifting rapidly, and the first shock on the rocks
would send her and her stone ballast to the bot-
tom.

On the other hand, there was no open sea-room
to let her run away before the wind with a
straining jib. At all hazards it was necessary to
fight her clear of that long ledge of rock, even
if the wind threatened to tear the mast out of
the boat. So Rob himself sprung down to the
stern and took the tiller.

with the half of Loch Scrone inside her ?"

Thus admonished, the younger brothers were
soon among the stone ballast baling out the
surging water with such rude utensils as they
could find. But the squall was of no great

The wind moderated in force; then it woke
up again, and brought a smart shower of rain
across; then, as if by magic, the heavens sudden-

them, the sea grew intensely blue, the far hills
on the other side of Loch Scrone began to shine

The danger being thus over, Rob once more

About the only hit of the imaginative voyage

in fact was the existence of an old castle--or,
rather, the ruins of what had once been a castle
--on the island called Eilean-na-Rona; and now
that they were racing down Loch Scrone, that
small island was drawing nearer, and already
they could make out the dark tower and ivied
walls of the ancient keep.

Far darker than the tower itself were the le-
gends connected with this stronghold of former
times; but for these the brothers MacNicol, who
had seized on the place as their own, cared little.

It is true they had some dread of the dungeon,
and none of them would have liked to visit Ei-
lean-naRona at night; but in the daytime the
old ruins formed an excellent retreat, where they
could play such high jinks or hold such courtly
tournaments as they chose.

of compassion--for indeed he knew that the dun-

could do, in the bringing up of the boys, to pay
a certain sum for their lodging and schooling,
leaving them pretty much to cadge for themselves
as regarded food and clothes.

Their food, mostly porridge, potatoes, and fish
of their own catching, cost little; and they did
not spend much money on clothes, especially in
summer-time, when no Erisaig boy--except Rob
MacNicol, who was a distinguished person----
would submit to the encumbrance of shoes and
stockings.

Nevertheless, for various purposes, money was
necessary to them; and this they obtained by
going down in the morning, when the herring
boats came in, and helping the men to strip the
nets. The men were generally tired out and
sleepy with their long night's work; and, if they
had had anything like a good haul, they were
glad to give these lads twopence or threepence
apiece to undertake the labor of lifting the nets,

silvery fish and dexterously extricating those that
had got more firmly enmeshed.

'Moreover, it was a work the boys delighted in.
If it was not the rose, it was near the rose. If it
was not for them as yet to sail away in the after-
noon, watched by all the village, at least they
could take this small part in the great herring
trade. And when they had shaken out the last
of the nets and received their wages, they stepped
ashore with a certain pride; and generally they
put both hands in their pockets, as a real fisher-
man would do; and perhaps they would walk
along the quays with a slight lurch, as if they,
also, had been cramped up all the long night
through, and felt somewhat unused to walking
on first getting back to land.

Now, these MacNicol boys, again imitating the
Well-to-do among the fishermen, had each an ac-
count at the savings-bank; and the pence they
got were carefully boarded up. For if they
wanted a new Glengarry cap, or if they wanted

to buy a book telling them of all kinds of tre-

grocer's shop, it was their own small store of
wealth they had to look to; and so it came about
that a penny was something to be seriously con-
sidered.

When Rob MacNicol had to impose a fine of
one penny, he knew it was a dire punishment;
and if there was any alternative, the fine was
rarely paid. The fund, therefore, which he had
started for the purchase of an old and disused set
of bagpipes, and which was to be made up of
those fines, did not grow apace. Of' course, being
a. Chieftain, he must needs have a piper. The
revels in the halls of Eilean-na-Rona lacked half
their impressiveness through the want of the
pipes. It is true, Rob had a sort of suspicion
that, if ever they should grow rich enough to buy
the old set of bagpipes, he would have to play
them himself; but even the most ignorant person

And now the captive Nicol MacNicol was led
to the edge of this black pit in the floor of the
lower hall of the castle. On several occasions
one or other of the boys had been lowered, for
slighter' offences, into this dungeon; but no one
had ever been condemned to go to the bottom--
if bottom there were. But Nicol did not flinch.
He was satisfied of the justice of his sentence.
He was aware he deserved the punishment.
Above all, he was determined to save that penny.

At the same time, when the other three had
poised themselves so as to lower the rope gradu-
ally, and when he found himself descending into
that black hole, he looked rather nervously be-
low him.

Of course, he could see nothing. But there
was a vague tradition that this dungeon was
haunted by ghosts, vampires, warlocks, and other
unholy things; and there was a chill, strange,
can perceive that to be one's own piper must at
least be better than to have no piper at all.

was a vague tradition that this dungeon was
haunted by ghosts, vampires, warlocks, and other
unholy things; and there was a chill, strange,
earthy odor arising from it; and the walls that
he scraped against were slimy and damp.

He uttered no word, however; and those above
kept slowly paying out the coil of rope. Rob
became somewhat concerned.

"It'll be no easy job to pull him back," he
said, in a whisper.

"It's as deep as the dungeon they put Donald
Gorm Mor into," said his cousin Neil.

"Maybe there's no bottom at all," said Duncan,
rather awe-stricken.

Suddenly a fearful thing happened. There
was a cry from below--a quick cry of alarm;
and at the same moment they were startled by
a wild whizzing and whirring around them, as if
a legion of fiends had rushed out of the pit.

With a shriek of fright Duncan sprung back
from the edge of the dungeon; and that with
such force that he knocked over his two compan-
ions. Moreover, in falling, they let go the rope.

Rob was the first to regain his senses. He

His heart jumped within him when he heard'

"Yes, I am; and the rope too. How am I to

Rob turned quickly.

"Duncan, down to the boat with ye! Loosen

Duncan was off like a young roe. He slid
down the crags; he dashed through the larch-
wood; he jumped into the boat on the beach.
Presently he was making his way as quickly

" Grope all around till ye come to them."

was hauled up, and thereafter--to the great re-

appeared alive and well, though somewhat anx-

dungeon. He went immediately out into the
warm summer air, followed by the others.

having recovered his speech.

nothing but a lot of bats; and Duncan yelled as

Over, so that we lost the rope. Come, boys, begin
your games now; the steamer will be in early

"We11,it seemed easier to dismiss superstitious

was no speech-making after it. But there was
some interesting conversation.

Duncan said.

he had encountered.

it flew up and hit me; and in a meenit the whole

stretching almost to the other side of Loch

the entrance to the harbor, just weathering the
rocks that had nearly destroyed them on their
setting out.

But here another difficulty waited them. Un-
der the shelter of the low-lying bills the harbor
was in a dead calm. No sooner had they passed
the rocks than they found themselves on water
as smooth as glass, and there were no oars in the
boat.

For this oversight Rob 'MacNicol was not
responsible, the fact being that oars were valu-

As a last resource, he threw the tiller into the

sort of paddle. But this was scarcely of any
avail; and they could hear, though they could
not see, that the steamer was almost at the point.

The next moment she appeared, and it seemed
to them in their fright that she was almost upon
them--towering away over them with her gigan-

whistle, and the sharp "ping! ping!" of the indi~
cator, as the captain tried to have the engines
reversed.

It was too late. The way on the steamer
carried her on, even when her paddles were

CHAPTER III.

ALTERED CIRCUMSTANCES.

EVEN with this big steamer coming right
down on them, Rob MacNicol did not lose his

head. He knew that his two brothers and his

cousin Neil could swim like water-rats; and as
for himself, though he would have given a good
deal to get rid of his boots, he did not fear being
able to get ashore. '

But there was no time to think. "Jump clear
of the boat!" he shouted to his companions.

The next second came the dreadful crash. The
frail old boat seemed to be pressed onward and
downward, as if the steamer had run right over
her. Then Rob found himself in the water, and
very deep in the water too.

The next thing he perceived was a great,
greenish-white thing over his head; and as he
knew that that was the hull of the steamer, he
struck away from it with all the strength at his
disposal. He remembered afterward experienc-
ing a sort of hatred of that shining green thing,
and thinking it looked hideous and dangerous,
like a shark.

However, the next moment he rose to the sur-
face, blew the water out of his mouth, and looked
around.

There was a life-buoy within a yard of him,
and the people on the steamer were calling to
him to lay hold of it; but he had never touched
one of these things, and he preferred to trust to
himself, heavy as he felt his boots to be.

Satisfied that every one was safe, Rob him-

The strange thing was that his father was no-

forward and asked the mate if they had got the

steamer backed.

At this news there was some little consterna-
tion. The mate called aloud for John MacNicol;
there was no answer. He ran to the other side
of the steamer; nothing was visible on the
smooth water. They searched everywhere, and
the boat that had been lowered was pulled
about, but the search was in vain.

The woman's story was the only explanation '
of this strange disappearance; but the sailors
Suspected more than they dared to suggest to
the bewildered lads. They suspected that old
MacNicol had dropped into the water just before
the paddles had made their first backward revo-
lution, and that in coming to the surface he had
been struck by one of the floats. They said noth-

be quite useless, the Glenara steamed slowly on-

It was not until the next afternoon that they
recovered the body of old Mac-Nicol; and from
certain appearances on the corpse it was clear
that he had been struck down by the paddles in
his effort to reach and help his sons.

That was a sad evening for Rob MacNicol. It
was his first introduction to the cruel facts of
life. And amid his sorrow for the loss of one
who, in a. sort of rough and reticent way, had
been very kind and even affectionate to him, Rob
was vaguely aware that on himself now rested
the responsibility for the upbringing of his two
brothers and his cousin.

He sat up late that night, long after the oth-
ers were asleep, thinking of what he should do.
In the midst of this silence the door was quiet-
ly opened, and Daft Sandy came into the small
room.

recovered the body of old Mac-Nicol; and from
certain appearances on the corpse it was clear
that he had been struck down by the paddles in
his effort to reach and help his sons.

That was a sad evening for Rob MacNicol. It
was his first introduction to the cruel facts of
life. And amid his sorrow for the loss of one
who, in a. sort of rough and reticent way, had
been very kind and even affectionate to him, Rob
was vaguely aware that on himself now rested
the responsibility for the upbringing of his two
brothers and his cousin.

He sat up late that night, long after the oth-
ers were asleep, thinking of what he should do.
In the midst of this silence the door was quiet-
ly opened, and Daft Sandy came into the small
room.

" What do ye want at this time 0' night?" said
Rob, angrily, for he had been startled.

The old, bent, half-witted man looked cautious-
ly at the bed in which Neil lay fast asleep.
" Whisht, Rob, my man," he said, in a whisper;
"I waited till every one in Erisaig was asleep.
Ay, ay! it's a. bad day this day for ye. And
what are ye going to do now, Rob? Ye'll be
taking to the fishing g"

"Oh, ay; I'll be taking to the fishing!" said
Rob, bitterly, for he had been having his dreams
also, and had turned from them with a sigh.
"Of course I'll be taking to the fishing! And
maybe ye'll tell me where I am to get forty
pounds to buy a boat, and where I am to get
thirty pounds to buy nets? Maybe ye'll tell me
that, Sandy?"

"The bank--"

"What does the bank ken about me? They
would as soon think of throwing the money into
Loch Scrone." \

"But ye ken, Rob, Coll Macdougall would give
ye a share in his boat for twelve pounds." .

"Twelve pounds! Man, ye'v-e just daft, Sandy.
Where am I to get twelve pounds?"

"Well, well, Rob," said the old man, coming
nearer, and speaking still more mysteriously,
"listen to What I tell ye. Some day or other
ye'll be taking to the fishing; and when that
day comes I will put something in your way.
Ay, ay, the fishermen about Erisaig dinna know
everything; come to me, Rob, my man, and I'll
tell ye something about the herring. Ye are
a good lad, Rob. Many's the herring I've got
from ye when I wouldna go near the shore for
they mischievous bairns; and when once ye have
a boat and nets 0' your own I will tell ye some-
thing. Daft Sandy is no so daft, maybe. Have
ye ony tobacco, Rob?"

Rob said he had no tobacco; and, making sure
that Daft Sandy had come to him with a pack
of nonsense merely as an excuse to borrow
money for tobacco, he bundled him out of the
house and went to bed.

, Rob was anxious that his brothers and cousin
and himself should present a respectable appear-
ance at the funeral; and in these humble prepa-
rations nearly all their small savings were swal-
lowed up. The funeral expenses were paid by
the steamboat company. Then after the funeral
the few people who were present departed to
their own homes, no doubt imagining that the
MacNicol boys would be able to live as hitherto
they had lived--that is, anyhow.

But there was a kindly man, called J amieson,
who kept the grocery-shop, and he called Rob in
as the boys passed home.

"Rob," said he, "ye maun be doing something
now. There's a cousin of mine has a whiskey-
shop in'the Salt-market,in Glasgow, and I could
get ye a place there."

Rob's very gorge rose at the notion of his
having to serve in a whiskey-shop in Glasgow.
That would be to abandon all the proud am-
bitions of his life. Nevertheless, he had been
thinking seriouslyabout the duty he owed to
these lads, his companions, who were now de-
ance at the funeral; and in these humble prepa-

and said,

"How much would he give me?"

"I think I could get him to give ye four shil-
lings a week. That would keep ye very well."

"Keep me 2" said Rob. "Ay, but what's to
become 0' Duncan and Neil and Nicol g"

"They must shift for themselves," the grocer
answered.

"That winna do," said Rob, and he left the
shop.

He overtook his companions, and asked them
to go along to some rocks overlooking the har- '
bor. They sat down there--the harbor below
them, with all its picturesque boats, and masses
of drying nets and what not.

"Neil," said Rob to his cousin, "we'll have to
think about things now. There will be no more
Eilean-na--Rona for us. We have just about as
much left as will pay the lodgings this week, and
Nicol must go three nights a week to the night-

who had been frightened by the thought of Rob
going away to Glasgow. The youngest of all,
Nicol, boldly declared that he could mend nets
as well as any man in Erisaig.

No sooner was the scheme thoroughly discuss-

kept the lodgings and cooked their food had in-
timated to them that they need be in no hurry
to pay her for a week or two until they should
find some employment; but they had need of
money, or the equivalent of money, in other di-
rections. '

Might not old Peter, who was a grumbling
and ill-tempered person, insist on being paid in
advance? Then, before they could begin to make
a net out of the torn and rejected pieces lying
about the shed, they must needs have a ball of
twine. .

the afternoon. -

Meanwhile, he himself went along to the shed
which was used as a sort of storage-house by
some of the fishermen; and here he found lying
about plenty of pieces of net that had been cast
aside in the process of mending.

This business of mending the nets is the last
straw on the back of the tired-out fisherman.
When he has met with an accident to his nets
during the night--when he has fouled on some
rocks in dragging them in, for example--it is a
desperately fatiguing affair to set to work to
mend them when he gets ashore, dead beat with
the labors of the morning.

The fishermen--for what reason I do not know
--will not intrust this work to their wives; they
will rather, after having been out all night, keep
at it themselves, though they drop off to sleep
every few minutes. It is not to be wondered at,

then, that often, instead of trying to laboriously
mend holes here or there, they should cut out a
large piece of torn net bodily and tack on a fresh
piece?

The consequence is, that in a place like Erisaig
there is generally plenty of netting to be got for
the asking; which is a good thing for gardeners
who want to protect currant-bushes from the
blackbirds, and who will take the trouble to
patch the pieces together.

Rob was allowed to pick out a large number of
pieces that he thought might serve his purpose;
and these he carried off home. But then came
the question of floats and sinkers. Sufficient
pieces of cork to form the floats might in time be
got about the beach; but the sinkers had all
been removed from the cast-away netting.

In this extremity, Rob bethought of rigging up
a couple of guy-poles, as the salmon-fishers call
them, one for each end of the small seine he had
in View; so that these guy-poles, with a lump of

lead, at the lower end, would keep the net vertical
while it was being dragged through the water.

All this took up the best part of the afternoon;
for he had to cadge about before he could get a
couple of stout poles; and he had to bargain
with the blacksmith for a lump of lead. Then
he walked along to the point where the other
MacNicols were busy fishing.

They had been lucky with their lines and bait.
On the rocks beside them lay two or three small
codling, a large flounder, two good-sized lythe,
and nearly a dozen saithe. Rob got hold of
these; washed them clean to make them look
fresh and smart; put a string through their
gills, and marched ofl'.' with them to the village.

He felt no shame in trying to sell fish: was it
not the whole trade of the village? He walked
into the grocer's shop.

"Will ye buy some fish?" said he; "they're
fresh."

"I will see," Bob said.

So he had his ball of twine--and a very large

afiixed his guy-poles; and they went to the grocer
and got from him a lot of old rope on the promise
to give him a few fresh fish whenever they hap-
pened to have a good haul. Then Rob pro-
ceeded to his fateful interview with Peter, the

"Why will ye no lend me the boat '4"

"Do I want it sunk, as ye sunk that boat the

"We want it for the fishing, Peter," said Rob,

the bench.

The tailor looked at the shilling; took it up,
bit it, and put it in his pocket.

"Very well," said be; "but mind, if ye sink
my boat, ye'll have three pounds to pay."

Rob went back eager and joyous. Forthwith,
a thorough inspection of the boat was set about
by the lads in conjunction; they tested the cars ;
they tested the thole-pins; they had a new piece
of cork put into the bottom. For that evening,
when it grew a little more toward dusk, they
would make their first cast with their net.

THAT was indeed an anxious time, when the
four MacNicols proceeded to try the net on
which they had spent so much forethought and
labor.

They had no great expectation of catching
fish this evening; their object was, rather, to
try whether the ropes would hold, whether the
floats would be sufficient, and whether Rob's
guy-poles would keep the net vertical. So they
got into the tailor's boat, and rowed away round
the point to a sandy bay, where they had noth-

It was, as has been mentioned in the previous
chapter, nearly dusk--an excellent time for catch-
ing saithe, if saithe were about. The net had
been carefully placed in the stern of the boat, so
that it would run out easily, the rope attached
to the guy-pole neatly coiled on the top.

Rob was very silent as his two brothers pulled
away at the long oars. He knew what depended
on this trial. They had just enough money left
to settle with their landlady on the following
evening, and Nicol's school-fees had to be paid
in advance.

They rowed quietly into this little bay, which,
though of a sandy bottom,was pretty deep. Rob
had resolved to take the whole responsibility of
the experiment on himself. He landed his broth-
ers and his cousin, giving the latter the end of
the rope attached to the guy-pole; then he qui-

When the length of the rope was exhausted,
he himself took the guy-pole and gently dropped
it over, to prevent splashing; and as he did so
the net began to pay out.

He pulled slowly, just to see how the thing
would work; and it seemed'to work very well.
The net went out freely, and apparently sunk
properly; from the top of the guy-pole to the
stern of the boat you could see nothing but the
line of the floats on the smooth water.

But the net was a small one; soon it would be
exhausted; so Rob began to pull round toward
the shore again. At the same time Neil, who
had had his instructions, began to haul in his
end of the net gently, so that by-and-by, when
Rob had run the boat on the beach, and jumped
out with his rope in his hand, the line of floats
began to form a semicircle that was gradually
narrowing and coming nearer the shore.

It was a moment of great excitement, and not
a word was spoken. For although this was os-
tensibly only a trial, to see how the net would
work, each lad in his secret heart was wondering
it over, to prevent splashing; and as he did so
the net began to pay out.

tone of great disappointment.

But Rob's eye had been caught by some odd

somehow, and more especially near the line of .

poles, so that the fish should be frightened back
into the net.

And, as the semicircle grew still smaller, it
was very obvious that, though there might be
seaweed in the net, it was not all seaweed. By
this time the guy-poles had been got ashore;
they were now hauling at the net itself.

"Quicker now, boys!" Rob called out. "Man
alive! look at that!"

All the space of water now enclosed by the
net was seen to be in a state of commotion; the
net itself was being violently shaken; here and
there a fish leaped into the air.

"Steady, boys! Don't jerk, or ye'll tear the
net to bits!" Rob called out, in great excitement.

For behold! when they had hauled this great
weight up on the shore with a final swoop, there
was something there that almost bewildered
them--a living mass of fish floundering about
in the wet seaweed, some springing into the air,
others flopping out on to the sand, many helpless-
poles, so that the fish should be frightened back
into the net.

"Run for the boat, Nicol! There's more where

Nicol rushed along to the boat, shoved her
out, pulled her along to where his companions
were, and backed her, stern in.

They had no bucket; they had to fling the
fish into the bottom of the boat. But this busi-
ness of stripping the nets--shaking out the sea-
weed and freeing the enmeshed fish--was fa-
miliar to them; and they all worked with a
will. There was neither a dog-fish nor a conger
in all the haul, so they had no fears for their
hands.

they were too eager; and this time they hauled
in with such might and main that, just as the
guy-poles were nearng the shore, the rope at-
tached to one of them broke. But Rob instant-

and hauled it out with him.

Here, also, they had a considerable take of
fish; but there was a heavy weight of seaweed
besides, and one or two rents showed that they
had pulled the net over rocks. So they went
back to their former ground; and so successful
were they, and so eagerly did they work, that,
when the coming darkness warned them to re

so that they were but rarely retailed in Erisaig

Perhaps, however, it was more curiosity than
anything else that brought the neighbors along
to the west slip to see what the MacNicols had
been about.

Well, there was a good deal of laughing and

Indeed, when the people had gone away again,
and the four lads were by themselves on the
quay, there was not a single "cuddy" left--ex-
cept a dozen that Rob had put into a can of
water, to be given to the grocer in the morning,
as part payment for the loan of the ropes.

"What do ye make it altogether?" said Neil to
Rob, Who was counting the money.

"Three shillings and ninepence."

"Three shillings and ninepence! Man, that's a
lot. Will ye put it in the savings-bank?"

"No, I will not," said Rob. "I'm no satisfied
with the net, Neil. We must have better ropes
all the way round; and sinkers, too; and what-
ever money we can spare we maun spend on the
net. Man, think of this, now: if we were to fall
in with a big haul of herring or J ohnnie-Dories,
and lose them through the breaking of the net, I
think ye would jist sit down and greet."

It was wise counsel, as events showed. For
one afternoon, some ten days afterward, they set
out as usual. They had been having varying
success; but they had earned more than enough
to pay their landlady, the tailor, and the school-
master; and every farthing beyond these neces-
water, to be given to the grocer in the morning,
as part payment for the loan of the ropes.

to pay their landlady, the tailor, and the school-

sary expenses they had spent on the net. They
had replaced all the rotten pieces with sound
twine; they had got new ropes; they had deep-
ened it, moreover, and added some more sinkers,
to help the guy-poles.

Well, on this afternoon, Duncan and Nicol, be-
ing the two youngest, were as usual pulling away
to one of the small, quiet bays, and Rob was idly
looking around him, when he saw something on
the surface of the sea at some distance ofl' that
excited a sudden interest. It was what the fish-
ermen call "broken water "~--a seething produced
by a shoal of fish.

"Look, look, Neil l" he cried. "It's either
mackerel or herring; will we try for them '2",

The greatest excitement now prevailed on
board. The younger brothers pulled their hard-
est to make for that rough patch on the water.
Rob undid the rope from the guy-pole, and got
this last ready to drop overboard.

He knew very well that they ought to have
sary expenses they had spent on the net. They
had replaced all the rotten pieces with sound
twine; they had got new ropes; they had deep-

He knew very well that they ought to havePAYING OUT THE NET.A
had two boats to execute this manoeuvre; but
was there not a chance, if they were to row hard,
in a circle, and pick up the other end of the net
when they came to it? So Neil took the third
oar--two rowing one side and one the other was
just what they wanted.

They came nearer and nearer that strange hiss-
ing of the water. They kept- rather away from
it; and Rob quietly dropped the guy-pole over,
paying out the net rapidly, so that it should not
be dragged after the boat.

Then the three lads pulled hard, and in a cir-
cle, so that at last they were sending the bow of
the boat straight toward the floating guy-pole.
The other guy-pole was near the stern of the
boat, the rope made fast to one of the thwarts.
In a few minutes Rob had caught this first guy-
pole; they were now possessed of the two ends
of the net.

But the water had grown suddenly quiet.
Had the fish dived and escaped them? There
had two boats to execute this manoeuvre; but
was there not a chance, if they were to row hard,

Had the fish dived and escaped them? There
was not the motion of a fin anywhere; and yet
the net seemed heavy to haul.

"Rob," said Neil, almost in a whisper, "we've
got them!"

"We havena got them," was the reply; "but
they're in the net. Man,I wonder if it'll stand
out 2"

Then it was that the diligent patching and the
strong tackle told. The question was not with
regard to the strength of the net, it was rather
with regard to the strength of the younger lads;
for they had succeeded in enclosing a goodly por-
tion of a large shoal of mackerel, and the weight
seemed more than they could get into the boat.

But even the strength of the younger ones
seemed to grow into the strength of giants when
they saw through the clear water a great moving
mass like quicksilver. And then the wild ex.
citement of hauling in; the difficulty of it; the
danger of the fish escaping; the warning cries of
Bob; the clatter made by the mackerel; the pos-
was not the motion of a fin anywhere; and yet
the net seemed heavy to haul.

sibility of swamping the boat altogether, as all
the four were straining their utmost at one side.

It is true that by an awkward tilt at one mo-
ment some hundred or two of the mackerel were
seen to glide away; but perhaps that rendered it
all the more practicable to get into the boat what
remained.

When that heaving, sparkling, jerking mass
of quicksilver at last was captured--shining all
through the brown meshes of the net--the young
lads sat down quite exhausted, wet through and
happy.

"Man! Rob, what do you think of that ?" said
Neil, in amazement.

" What do I think?" said Rob. "I think that
if we could get two or three more hauls like that,
I would soon buy a share in 0011 MacDougall's
boat and go after the herring." '

They had no more thought that afternoon. of
"cuddy" fishing after this famous take. Rob
and Neil--the younger ones having had their

and Neil--the younger ones having had their
share--rowed back to Erisaig; then Rob left the
boat at the slip, and walked up to the oflice of
the fish-salesman.

"What will ye give me for mackerel?" he said.

The salesman laughed at him, thinking he had
caught a few with rods and flies.

" I'm no buying mackerel," said he; "no by
the half- dozen. "

"I have half a boat- load, " said Rob.

The salesman glanced toward the 311p, and saw
the tailor's boat pretty low in the water.

" Is that mackerel?"

" Yes, it is mackerel."

" Where were you buying them g"

"I was not buying them anywhere. I caught
them myself--my brothers and me."

"I do not believe you."

"I cannot help that, then," said Rob. "But

The salesman glanced at the boat again.
" I'll go down to the slip with you."

So he and Rob together walked down to the
slip, and the salesman had a look at the mack-
erel. Apparently, he had arrived at the conclu-
sion that, after all, Rob was not likely to have
bought a cargo of mackerel as a commercial
speculation.-

"Well, I will buy the mackerel from you," he
said. "I will give you half a crown the hundred
for them."

" Half a crown l" said Rob. " I will take three
and Sixpence the hundred for them."

"I will not give it to you. But I will give
you three shillings the hundred, and a good price,
too."

"Very well, then," said Rob.

So the MacNicols got altogether two pounds
and eight shillings for that load of mackerel;
and out of that Rob spent the eight shillings on
still farther improving the net; the two pounds
going into the savings-bank.

It is to be imagined that after this they kept
a pretty sharp lookout for " broken water ;" but
of course they could not expect to run across a
shoal of mackerel every day.

However, as time went on, with bad luck and
with good, and by dint of hard and constant
work whatever the luck was, the sum in the sav-
ings-bank slowly increased; and at last Rob an-
nounced to his companions that they had saved
enough to enable him to purchase a share in 0011
MacDougall's boat.

Neil and Duncan and Nicol were sorely disin~
clined to part with Rob; but yet they saw clear-
ly enough that he was getting too old to remain
at the cuddy-fishing; and they knew they could
now work that line of business quite well by
themselves.

Of course, that was a dream of the future; for
a herring-skifl' costs a great deal of money, and
so do nets. But in the mean time they were all
agreed that what Rob counselled was wise; and

agreed that what Rob counselled was wise; and
a share in Coll MacDougall's boat was accord-
ingly purchased, after a great deal of bargaining.
A proud lad was Rob MacNicol the afternoon
he came along to the wharf to take his place in
the boat that was now partly his own. His .
brothers and cousin were there to see him--en-
vious a little, perhaps, but proud also; for part
of their money had gone to buy the share. He
had likewise purchased second-hand a huge pair
of boots, that were as soft and pliable as grease
could make them; and he carried a brand-new yel-
low oil-skin in his hand that crackled as he walked.
Neil, Duncan, and Nicol watched him throw
his oil-skin into the boat, and go forward to the
bow, and take his place there at the oar; and
they knew very well that if there was any one
who could pull an oar better than Rob, it was
not in Erisaig that that person was to be found.
Then the big herring-skiff passed away out of
the point in the red glow of the evening, and Rob
had achieved the first great ambition of his life.

THAT was not a very good year for the her-
ring-fishing on this part of the coast; but, at all
events, Rob MacNicol learned all the lore of the
fishermen, and grew as skilled as any of them in
guessing at the whereabouts of the herring, while
at the end of the season he had more than re-
placed the twelve pounds he had used of the
common fund.

Then he returned to the tailor's boat, and
worked with his brothers and cousin. He was
proud to know that he had a share in a fishing-

These MacNicol boys had grown to be greatly
respected in Erisaig. The audacity of four "was-
trel laddies" setting up to be fishing on their
own account had at first amused the neighbors;
but their success and their conduct generally
soon raised them above ridicule, and the women
especially were warm in their commendation.

They saw how Rob gradually improved the
appearance of his brothers and cousin. All of
them had boots and stockings now. Not only
that, but they had white shirts and jackets of
blue cloth to go to church with on Sunday; and
each of them put twopence in the collection-
plate, just as if they had all been sons of a rich
tradesman.

Moreover, they were setting an example to the
other boys about. Four of these, indeed, com-
bined to start a cuddy-fishing business similar to
that of Rob's. Neil was rather angry, but Rob
was not afraid of any competition. He asked
the new boys to come and see how he had rig-
ged up the guy-poles. He said there were plen-

especially were warm in their commendation.

They saw how Rob gradually improved the
appearance of his brothers and cousin. All of
them had boots and stockings now. Not only
that, but they had white shirts and jackets of
blue cloth to go to church with on Sunday; and
each of them put twopence in the collection-
plate, just as if they had all been sons of a rich
tradesman.

Moreover, they were setting an example to the
other boys about. Four of these, indeed, com-
bined to start a cuddy-fishing business similar to
that of Rob's. Neil was rather angry, but Rob
was not afraid of any competition. He asked
the new boys to come and see how he had rig-
ged up the guy-poles. He said there were plen-

ty of fish in the sea, and the market was large
enough.

But when the new boys asked him to lend
them some money to buy new ropes, he distinct-
ly declined. He had got on without borrowing
himself.

It was a long and dreary winter; but Nicol
had nearly finished with his schooling, and the
seine-net had been largely added to, and every
inch of it overhauled. Then the cuddy-fishing
began again; and soon Rob--who was now near-
ly eighteen, and remarkably firm-set for his age
--would be away after the herring.

One day, as Bob was going along the main
thoroughfare of Erisaig, the banker called him
into his office.

"Rob," said he, "have ye seen the skifi'* at'the
building-yard ?"

"Ay," said Rob, rather wistfully; for many a

In his excitement at the notion of being made
master of such a beautiful craft, Rob forgot the
respect he ought to have shown in addressing
so great a person as the banker. He blurted
out,

" Man, I would just like to try!"

Rob was quite bewildered. All he could say

Some of the women shook their heads, and said
it was a. shame to let such mere lads go to the
herring-fishing, for some day or other they would
be drowned; but the men, who knew something '
of Rob's seamanship, had no fear at all; and their
only doubt was about the younger lads being up
to the heavy work of hauling in the nets in the
morning.

But their youth was a fault that would mend
week by week. In the mean time, Rob, having
sold out his share in MacDougall's boat, bought
jerseys and black boots and yellow oil-skins for
his companions; so that the new crew, if they
were rather slightly built, looked smart enough
as they went down to the slip 'to overhaul the
Mary of Argyle.

With what a pride they regarded the long and
shapely lines of her--the yellow beams shining
with varnish; the tall mast at the bow, with its
of Argyle; and that he had taken his brothers

had captured the cuddies.

put to sea on her trial trip, her owner was on

Rob who was at the tiller. Rob wanted to try

"Well, What do ye think of her?" said Mr.
Bailie to his young skipper. -

Rob's face was aglow with pride.

"I think she's like a race-horse!" he said. "I
think she would lick any boat in Erisaig Bay."

"But it is not to run races I have handed her
over to ye. You must be careful, Rob; and run
back if there's any squally weather about. I'll
no be vexed if you're over-cautious. For ye
know if anything was to happen to one of the
lads, the people would say I had done wrong in
lippening* a boat to such a young crew."

"Well, sir," said Rob, boldly, "ye have seen
them work the boat. Do they look like lads
who do not know what sailing a boat is 2"

Mr. Bailie laughed, and said no more.

The afternoon was lovely; there was not a

bay; and the Mary of Argyle went away across '
the shining waters with the long, white oars dip-

not until they were at the mouth of the harbor
that something occurred which seemed likely to
turn this brave setting-out into ridicule.

This was Daft Sandy, who rowed his punt
right across the path of the Mary of Argyle,
and, as she came up, called to Rob.

" What is it ye want?" Rob called to him.

"I want to come on board, Rob," the old man
said, as he now rowed his punt up to the stern
of the skiff.

"It's no for that," said Daft Sandy, as, with the
painter of his boat in one hand, he gripped the
stern of the skiff with the other.

Now Rob was angry. Many of the Erisaig
people would still be watching their setting-out;
and was it to be supposed that they had taken
this doited old body as one of the crew? But
then Daft Sandy was at this moment clambering
into the boat; and Rob could not get up and
fight with an old man, who would probably
tumble into the water.

painter of his punt, "I promised I would tell ye

" Why havena ye made a rich man of yourself,
Sandy 2" said Rob, with more good-nature.

The half-witted creature did not seem to see
the point of this remark. '

"Ay, ay," he said; "many is the time I was
thinking of telling this one or telling that one;
but when I would go near it was always 'Daft
Sandy !' and ' Daft Sandy !' and there was always

you, Rob. And I was saying to myself that

I will show him how to find the herring, and no
one will know but himself."

By this time the MacNicols had taken to their
oars again; and they had pulled outside the bar-
bor, the old punt still astern. Then Rob had to
speak plainly.

"Look here, Sandy: I will not put ye ashore
by force. But I canna have your punt at there.

But the old man was more eager than ever.
If they would only pull into the bay hard by, he
would anchor the punt and leave it. He begged
Rob to take him for that night's fishing. He
had discovered a sure sign of the presence of
herring--unknown to any of the fishermen.

What was the phosphorescence in the sea 2----
the nights were too clear for that. What was
the mere breaking of the water?--a moving
shoal that might escape. But this sign that the
old man had discovered went to show the pres-
ence of large masses of fish, stationary and deep:
it was the appearance on the surface of the water
of small air-bubbles.

He was sure of it. He had watched it. It
was a secret worth a bankful of money. And
again he besought Bob to let him accompany
him. Rob had stopped the lads when they were
throwing herring at him; Rob alone should have
the benefit of this valuable discovery of his.

They pulled in and anchored the punt; then
they set forth again, rowing slowly as the light
faded out of the sky, and keeping a watch all
around on the almost glassy seas.

There was no sign of any herring; no solan-

and none of the other boats, so far as they could
make out, had as yet shot their nets.

The night was coming on, and they were far
away from Erisaig; but still old Sandy kept up
his watch, studying the surface of the water as if
he expected to find pearls floating there. And
at last, in great excitement, be grasped Rob's
arm. Leaning over the side of the boat, they
could just make out in the dusk a great quan-
tity of minute air-bubbles rising to the surface
of the sea.

"Put some stones along with the sinkers, Rob,"
the old man said, in a whisper, as if he were
sist the importunities of the old, half-witted
creature. '

They pulled in and anchored the punt; then
they set forth again, rowing slowly as the light
faded out of the sky, and keeping a watch all
around on the almost glassy seas.

. afraid of the herring hearing; "go deep, deep,
deep."

Well, they quietly let out the seemingly inter-
minable drift-net as they pulled gently along,
and when that was accomplished they took in
the long oars again. Nicol lit up the little stove,
and proceeded to boil the tea. The bundle con-
taining their supper was opened, and Sandy had
his share and his can of tea like the others.

They had a long time of waiting to get over
through the still summer night; but still Rob
was strangely excited, wondering whether Sandy
- had really, in pottering about, discovered a new
indication of the whereabouts of the herring, or
whether he was to go back to Erisaig in the
morning with empty nets.

There was another thing, too. Had he shown
himself too credulous before his companions?
Had he done right in listening to What might be
only a foolish tale? The others began to doze
off; Rob not. He did not sleep a wink all night.

Well, to let out a long drift-net, which some-
times goes as deep as fifteen fathoms, is an easy
affair ; but to haul it in again is a sore task; and
when it happens to be laden, and heavily laden,
with silver- gleaming fish, that is a break-back
business for four young lads. But there is such
a thing as the nervous, eager, joyous strength of
success; and if you are hauling in yard after
yard of a dripping net, only to find the brown
meshes starred at every point with the shining
silver of the herring, then even young lads can
work like men. Daft Sandy was laughing all
the while.

"Rob, my man, what think ye o' the air-bub-
bles now? Maybe Daft Sandy is no sae daft.
And do you think I would be going and tell-
ing any one but yourself, Rob? Do you think
I would be going and telling any one that was
throwing the broken herring at me, and always
a curse for me when I went near the skiffs, and
not once a glass of whiskey for an old man?

Well, Rob, I will not ask you for a glass of
whiskey. If you say it is a teetotal boat, it is a
teetotal boat; but you will not forget to give me
whole herring for bait when you are going out
of the bay ?"

Rob could not speak; he was breathless. Nor
was their work nearly done when they had got
in the net, with all its splendid silver treasure.
There was not a breath of wind; they had to set
to work to pull the heavy boat back to Erisaig.
The gray of the dawn gave way to a glowing
sunrise; when they at length reached the quay,
dead-beat with fatigue and want of sleep, the
' ' people were all about.

They were dead-beat, but there were ten crans
of herring in that boat. And you should have

But the three MacNicols were far too excited
to go away. They wanted to see the great heap
of fish ladled out in baskets on to the quay. - Mr.
Bailie came along not long after that, and shook
hands with Rob, and congratulated him; for it
turned out that, while not another Erisaig boat
had that night got more than from two to three
crans, the Mary of Argyle had turned out ten
crane--as good herring as ever were got out of
Loch Scrone.

Well, the MacNicol lads were now in a fair
way of earning an independent and honorable
living; and this sketch of how they had strug-
gled into that position from being mere wastrels,
living about the shore like so many curlews, may
fitly cease here. Sometimes they had good luck,
and sometimes bad luck; but always they had
the advantage of that additional means of dis-
covering the whereabouts of the herring that
had been imparted to them by Daft Sandy.

a small stone cottage on the slope of the hill
above Erisaig; and that Daft Sandy had been
taken away from the persecution of the harbor
boys to become a sort of general majordomo--
cook, gardener, and mender of nets.

Moreover, each of the MacNicols has his sep-
arate bank-account now; each has got a silver
watch; and Rob was saying the other day that
he thought that he and his brothers and his
cousin ought to take a trip to London (as soon
as the herring-fishing was over), for perhaps
they might see the Queen there; and at any
rate they could go and have a look at Smith-
