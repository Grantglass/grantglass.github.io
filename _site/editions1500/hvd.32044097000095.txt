PEEFACE.
THIS primary work is designed for small children,
and as an easy introduction to the "Progressive Intel-
lectual Arithmetic," for advanced classes.
Its object is to lead the young pupil, by brief and
simple processes, applied to practical examples of easy
gradation, to acquire habits of thought and of reasoning,
in their simplest forms, and to draw out and strengthen
the mind by a progressive and almost imperceptible gra-
dation of thought and expression.
The operations of Adding and Subtracting, of Multi-
plying and Dividing, are first shown by pictorial objects;
portions of the elementary tables are introduced at the
commencement of each lesson, and applied to short ex-
amples concerning familiar objects; promiscuous reviews
of the elementary tables, and the more simple and easy
Denominate tables have been introduced. Fractions
have been treated as far as was thought practicable
in a work of this kind.
It is confidently believed that the progressive and
systematic arrangement, the simplicity and adaptation
to the juvenile mind, the typography and general attrac-
tiveness of this little book, will insure for it abundant
success.
THE AUTHOR.
SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS.
1. A TEACHER should have a particular time allotted
to every exercise, and regular lessons should be assigned,
to be recited each day at a specified hour.
2. Sufficient time being given the pupils to learn
their lessons, they should not be allowed the use of the
book at the time of recitation.
3. The teacher should first ascertain that the table is
thoroughly learned by every pupil in the class.
4. Each question should be slowly and distinctly read,
and the pupils be called upon promiscuously; the pupil
called upon should stand erect, repeat the question, and
then give the solution. This will require close attention.
5. A correct and uniform analysis of each question
should be required from every pupil.
6. The class should be encouraged to detect and cor-
rect errors in the statement and solution of questions, to
be signified by raising the hand.
7. The teacher can extend the questions in each les-
son at pleasure, either by repeating those given, or
making additional ones.

REMARK. — This lesson presents the printed and
written figures, and the Roman letters, by which num-
bers are commonly expressed. 16 should be carefully
studied by children, until they can read the figures with
facility when written on the black-board, or when they
meet with them in books.

1. At 1 cent each, what will 2 eggs cost?
ANALYSIS. — Since 1 egg cost 1 cent, 2 eggs, which

cents. Therefore, at 1 cent each, 2 eggs will cost 2
cents.

1. What will 2 pounds of rice cost, at 6
cents a pound I
ANALYSIS. — Since 1 pound costs 6 cents, 2 pounds,

cost 12 cents, at G cents a pound.

as 6 dollars, the price of a ton, is contained times in
8 times 3 dollars, or 24 dollars, the cost of the broad-
cloth, which are 4 times. Therefore 4 tons of hay, at

LESSON XIV.
1. If 7 oranges cost 28 cents, what will 3
oranges cost 1
ANALYSIS. — If 7 oranges cost 28 cents, 1 orange
will cost as mang cents as 7 is contained times in 28,
which is 4 times; 3 oranges, which are 3 times 1 orange,
will cost 3 times 4 cents, or 12 cents. Therefore, if 7
oranges cost 28 cents, 3 oranges will cost 12 cents,
2. If 6 pounds of sugar cost 60 cents,
what will 9 pounds cost?

Clara, and 4 to Herbert; how many did she
keep for herself?
ANALYSIS. — She kept as many pinks as the difference
between 15 pinks and the sum of 6 pinks and 4 pinks;
6 and 4 are 10, and 10 from 15 leaves 5. Therefore,
if Isabel had 15 pinks, and gave away 10, she had 5 left.

Henry, and 6 to John; how many had he
left?

Entered, according to Act of Congress, m the year 1858, and again in the year 1863, by
DANIEL W. PIsH, A.M.,
In the Clerk's Office of the District Court of the United states, for the Northern
District of New York.
THIS primary work is designed for small children,
and as an easy introduction to the "Progressive Intel-
lectual Arithmetic," for advanced classes.
Its object is to lead the young pupil, by brief and
simple processes, applied to practical examples of easy
gradation, to acquire habits of thought and of reasoning,
in their simplest forms, and to draw out and strengthen
the mind by a progressive and almost imperceptible gra-
dation of thought and expression.
The operations of Adding and Subtracting, of Multi-
plying and Dividing, are first shown by pictorial objects;
portions of the elementary tables are introduced at the
commencement of each lesson, and applied to short ex-
amples concerning familiar objects; promiscuous reviews
of the elementary tables, and the more simple and easy
Denominate tables have been introduced. Fractions
have been treated as far as was thought practicable
in a work of this kind.
It is confidently believed that the progressive and
systematic arrangement, the simplicity and adaptation
to the juvenile mind, the typography and general attrac-
tiveness of this little book, will insure for it abundant
success.
THE AUTHOR.
1. A TEACHER should have a particular time allotted
to every exercise, and regular lessons should be assigned,
to be recited each day at a specified hour.
2. Sufficient time being given the pupils to learn
their lessons, they should not be allowed the use of the
book at the time of recitation.
3. The teacher should first ascertain that the table is
thoroughly learned by every pupil in the class.
4. Each question should be slowly and distinctly read,
and the pupils be called upon promiscuously; the pupil
called upon should stand erect, repeat the question, and
then give the solution. This will require close attention.
5. A correct and uniform analysis of each question
should be required from every pupil.
6. The class should be encouraged to detect and cor-
rect errors in the statement and solution of questions, to
be signified by raising the hand.
7. The teacher can extend the questions in each les-
son at pleasure, either by repeating those given, or
making additional ones.

REMARK. — This lesson presents the printed and
written figures, and the Roman letters, by which num-
bers are commonly expressed. 16 should be carefully
studied by children, until they can read the figures with
facility when written on the black-board, or when they
meet with them in books.

and took 10 sheep for payment; what was
the cost of each sheep?
LESSON XIII.
1. How many tons of hay, at 6 dollars a
ton, will pay for 8 yards of broadcloth, at 3
dollars a yard I
ANALYSTS. — Äs many tons of hay at 6 dollars a ton,
as 6 dollars, the price of a ton, is contained times in
8 times 3 dollars, or 24 dollars, the cost of the broad-
cloth, which are 4 times. Therefore 4 tons of hay, at
G dollars a ton, will pay for 8 yards of broadcloth, at 3
dollars a yard.

LESSON XIV.
1. If 7 oranges cost 28 cents, what will 3
oranges cost 1
ANALYSIS. — If 7 oranges cost 28 cents, 1 orange
will cost as mang cents as 7 is contained times in 28,
which is 4 times; 3 oranges, which are 3 times 1 orange,
will cost 3 times 4 cents, or 12 cents. Therefore, if 7
oranges cost 28 cents, 3 oranges will cost 12 cents,
2. If 6 pounds of sugar cost 60 cents,
what will 9 pounds cost?

Clara, and 4 to Herbert; how many did she
keep for herself?
ANALYSIS. — She kept as many pinks as the difference
between 15 pinks and the sum of 6 pinks and 4 pinks;
6 and 4 are 10, and 10 from 15 leaves 5. Therefore,
if Isabel had 15 pinks, and gave away 10, she had 5 left.
