' WI. BARTON, flOLBORN-HILL, LONDON}PREFACE.

IF ever the story of any private
man's adventures in the world were .
worth making public, and were ac-
ceptable when published, the editor of
this account thinks this will be so.
The wonders of this man's life ex-
ceed all that (he thinks) is to be found
extant; the life of one man being
scarce capable of a greater variety.
The story is told with modesty,
with seriousness, and with a religious
application of events, tovthe uses; to
which wise men always apply them,

viz. to the instruction of others by
A2
this example, and to justify and honor
the wisdom of Providence in all the

variety of our circumstances, let them
happen how they will.

The Editor believes this narrative
to be a just history of fact; neither is
there any appearance of fiction in it;
and though he is well aware there are
many, who, on account of the very
singular preservations the Author met
With, will give it the name of romance;
yet, in which ever of these lights it
shall be viewed, he imagines, that the
improvement of it, as well as the di-
version, as to the instruction of the
reader, will be the same, and as such,
he thinks, without further compliment
to the world, he does them great ser-
vice in the publication.THE

LIFE AND ADVENTURES

OF

ROBINSON CRUSOE.

 

I WAS born at York, in the year 1632, of
a reputable family. My father was a na-
tive of Bremen, who by merchandiziug at
Hull for some time, gained a very plentiful
fortune. He married my mother at York,
and as her maiden name was Robinson, I
was called Robinson Kreutznaer ; which
not being easily pronounced in the English
tongue, we are commonly known by the
name of Crusoe.

I was the youngest of three brothers.--
No charge or pains were wanting in my
education.--My father designed me for the

law, yet nothing would serve me but I must
A 3
go to sea, both against the will of my {a4
ther, the tears of my mother, and the en--
treaties of friends. One morning my father
expostulated very warmly with me: What
reason, says he, have you to leave your na-
tive country, and enter into a wandering
condition of uneasiness and uncertainty"!
He recommended to me Agar's wish, "Nei--
ther to desire pOVerty nor richesz" told
me that a middle state of life was the most
happy, and that high towering thoughts of
raising our condition by wandering abroad,
often ended in confusion and disappoint-
ment. I entreat you, nay, I command you,
(says he,) to desist from these intentions.
If you will go, (added he,) my prayers shall
be offered for your preservation; but a
time may come, when desolate, oppressed,
or forsaken, you may wish you had taken
your poor father's counsel. He pronounced
these words with such a moving and pater-
nal eloquence, while floods of tears ran
down his aged cheeks, that it seemed to
shake my resolutions. But this soon wore
off, and a little after Iinformed my mother,

. that I could not settle to any business; and
begged she would gain my father's consent
only to go one voyage; which if it did not
prove prosperous, I would never atttempt
a second, My mother warmly expressed
her dislike of this proposal.

I was then, I think, nineteen years old,
when one time being at Hull, I met a school
fellow going with his father, who was mas--
ter of a ship, to London; and acquainting
him with my wandering desires, he assured
me of a free passage, and a plentiful share
of what was necessary. Thus, without im--
ploring a blessing, or taking farewell of my
parents, I took shipping on the lst of Sep-
tember, 1651. We set sail soon after, and
our ship had scarce left the Humber when
there arose a violent storm, and being ex-
tremely sea-sick, I concluded the judgment
of God deservedly followed me for my dis-
obedience to my dear parents. It was then
I called to mind the good advice of my fa-
ther; and I firmly resolved, if it pleased
God to set me on dry land once more, to
return to my parents, implore their for-
giveness, and bid a final adieu to my wan-
dering inclinations.

Such were my thoughts while the storm
continued; but these good resolutions de-
creased with the danger; and Isoon forgot
the vows and promisesl made in my distress.

Upon the sixth day we came to anchor in
Harwich road, where we lay wind-bound
with some Newcastle ships; here the sea.
men forgot their late toil and danger, and
spent their time as merrily as if they had
been on shore. But on the eighth day
there arose a brisk gale of wind, which
prevented our tiding it up the river; and
still increasing, our ship rode forecastle in,
and shipped several large seas.

It was not long before horror seized the
seamen themselves, and I heard the master
exclaim, " Lord have mercy upon us, we
shall be all lost and undone!" For my part,
sick unto death, I kept my cabin, till the
universal and terribly dreadful apprehen-
sions of our speedy fate made me get upon
deck; and there I was afl'righted indeed.
The sea ran mountains high; I could see
nothing but distress around us; two ships
had cut their masts on board, and another
was foundered; two more that had lost
their anchors, were forced out to the mercy
of the ocean: and to save our lives we
were forced to cut our foremast and main-
mast quite away. ,

I was just ready to expire with fear,
when immediately all hands were called to
the pump; and the men forced me also to
share with them in their labour. While
thus employed, the master espying some
light colliers, fired a gun as a signal of dis-
tress; and I, not understanding what it
meant, and thinking that either the ship
broke, or some dreadful thing happened,
fainted away. HoweVer, nobody minded
me, excepting to thrust me aside with their
feet, thinking me dead, and it was a great
while before I recovered.

Happy it was for us, when upon the sig-
nal given, they ventured out their boats to
save our lives. All our pumping had been
in vain, had they not come to our ship's
side, with great difficulty we got into their
boat, and we perceived our ship sink within
less than a quarter of an hour.

Strange, after all this, like the prodigal
son, I did not return to my father; who
hearing of the ship's calamity, for a long
time thought me entombed in the deep.

I thought at first I would return home;
butshame opposed that good motion, think-
ing I should he laughed at by my neigh-
bours and acquaintance. So strange is the
nature of youth, who are not ashamed to
sin, but yet are ashamed to repent, and re-
turn to their duty, which is the principal
mark of wisdom. In short, I travelled up
to London, resolving upon a voyage; and
a voyage I soon heard of, to go to the coast
of Guinea. Having some money and ap-
pearing like a gentleman, I went on board
not as a common sailor or foremast man;
nay, the commander agreed I should go
the voyage with him without any expense;
that I should be his messmate and com-
panion, and I was very welcome to carry
any thing with me, and make the best mer-
chandise I could.

I blessed my happy fortune, and hum'bly
thanked my captain for this offer; and ac-
quainting my friends in Yorkshire, forty
pounds were sent me, the greatest part by
my dear father and mother, with which I
bought toys and trifles, as the captain di-
rected me. My captain also taught me
navigation, how to keep an account of the
ship's course, take an observation, and led
me into the knowledge of several useful
branches of the mathematics. And indeed
this voyage made me both a sailor and a
merchant; for I brought home five pounds,
nine ounces of gold dust for my adventure,
which produced at my return to London,
almost three hundred pounds.

But alas! my dear friend, the captain
soon departed this life. This was a sensi-
ble grief to me: yet I resolved to go ano-
ther voyage with his mate, who had now
the command of the ship. My misfortunes
in this unhappy voyage were very great;
for our ship sailing towards the Canary
islands, we were chased by a Salee rover;
and in spite of all the haste we could make,
the pirate gained upon us, so that we pre-
pared ourselves to fight. They had 18
guns, and we had but 12. About three in
the afternoon there was a desperate engage-
ment, wherein many were killed and wound-
ed on both sides; but finding ourselves
overpowered by numbers, we were forced
to surrender; and were all carried prisoners
into the port of Salee. Our men were sentJ" b /

OF ROBINSON cnuson. 13

to the emperor's court to be sold there;
but the pirate captain kept me to be his
own slave.

In this condition, I thought myself the
most miserable creature upon earth, and
the prophecy of my father came afresh into
my thoughts. Some hopes indeed I had
that my new patron would go to sea again,
where he might be taken by a Spanish or
Portuguese man of war, and then I should
be set at liberty. But in thisI was mis-
taken; for he never took me with him, but
left me to_look after his little garden, and
do the drudgery of his house.

After some length of time, my patron as
I found, grew so poor that he could not fit

out his ship as usual; and then he used
constantly, once or twice a week, if the

weather was fair, to go out a fishing, taking
me and a young Moresco boy to row the
boat; and so much pleased was he with me
for my dexterity in catching the fish, that

he would often send me with a Moor, who
8
was one of his kinsmen, and the Moresco
youth, to catch a dish of fish for him.

One morning as we were at the sport,
there arose such a thick fog that we lost
sight of the shore; and rowing we knew not
which way, we laboured all the night, and
in the morning found ourselves in the ocean,
two leagues from land; which however we
at length reached, extremely exhausted by
long fasting; and in order to prevent such
disasters for the future, my patron ordered
a carpenter to build a little state room or
cabin in the middle of the long-boat, with
lockers for provisions.

In this be frequently took us out a fish-
ing; and one time inviting two or three
persons of distinction to go with him, made
provision extraordinary, providing also
three fusees, with powder and shot, that
they might have some sport at fowling
along the sea-coast. The next morning the
boat was made clean, and every thing ready,
but their minds altering, my patron ordered
us to go a fishing, as his guests would cer-
' tainly sup with him that night.

And now I began seriously to think of
my deliverance. In order to this, I per-
suaded the Moor to get some provisions on
board, not daring to meddle with our pa-
tron's; and we stored ourselves with rusk
biscuit, and three jars of water. Besides,
I privately conveyed into the boat a bottle
of brandy, some twine, thread, a hammer,
hatchet, and a saw; and, in particular,
some bees' wax, which was a great comfort
to me, and served to make candles. I then
persuaded Muley (for so was the Moor

- called) to procure some powder and shot,
pretending to kill sea curlews, which he
innocently and readily agreed to. In short,
being provided with all things necessary,
we sailed out, I resolving to make my es-
cape, though it should cost me my life.
When we had run from shore I gave the
boy the helm, and pretending to stoop for
something, seized Muley by surprise" and
B 2
threw him overboard. As he was an exo
cellent swimmer, he soon arose, and made
towards the boat; upon which, I took out
a fusee, and presented at him: " Muley,"
said I, " I never yet designed to do you
" any harm, and seek nothing now but my
" redemption. I know you are able enough
" to swim to shore, and save your life ; but
"if you are resolved to follow me, to the
"endangering of mine, the very moment
" you proceed, I will shoot you through
" the head." The harmless creature at
these words, turned himself from me, and
I make no doubt got safe to land. Then
turning to the boy Xury, I perceived he
trembled at the action; but I put him out
of all fear, telling him, that if he would be
true and faithful to me, I would do well by
him. So innocent did the child then look,
and with such an obliging smile consented,
that I readily believed him, and from that
day forward began to love him entirely.
We then pursued our voyage; and ha-
ving a fresh gale of wind, with a pleasant
smooth sea, by three o'clock next day, I
was one hundred and fifty miles beyond
the Emperor's of Morocco's dominions.
Yet still having the dreadful apprehension
of being retaken, I continued sailing for-
five days successively, till the wind shift--
ing to the southward, made me conclude,
that if any vessel was in chase of me, they
would proceed no farther. After so much
fatigue, I anchored at the mouth of a little
river. What I principally wanted was fresh
water; and I was resolved about dusk to
swim ashore. But no sooner did the
gloomy clouds of night begin to succeed
the declining day, than we heard such bark-
ing, roaring, and howling of wild creatures,
that one might have thought the very
strongest monster of nature or infernal
spirits had their residence there.

The next morning I was resolved to go
on shore to get fresh water, and venture

my life among the beasts or savages, should
B S
either attack me. Xury said, he would take
one of the jars and bring me some.; I asked
him, why he would go, and not I"! The
poor boy answered, " if wild mans come,
they eat me, you go away." This noble--
ness of mind increased my affection to the
child. " Well, dear Xury," said I, " we
will both go ashore, both kill wild mans,
and they shall eat neither of us." So giv-
ing Xury a piece of rusk bread to eat, and
a dram, we waded ashore, carrying nothing
with us but our arms, and twojars of water.
Idid not go out of sight of the boat, as
dreading the savages coming down the
river in their canoes; but the boy seeing a
low descent or vale about a mile in the
country, he wandered to it: and running
back to me with great precipitation, I
thought he was pursued 'by some savage or
wild beast; upon which I approached, re-
solving to perish or protect him from dan--
ger. As he came nearer to me, I saw some-
thing hanging over his shoulders, which
was a creature he had shot like a hare, but
different in colour, and longer legs; how--
ever we were glad of it, for it proved whole-
some and nourishing meat: but what added
to our joy was, my boy assured me there
was plenty of water, and that he see no wild
mans.--In this place I began to consider
that the Canary and Cape de Verde islands
lay not far off. The place I was in was
no doubt that wild country that lies
between the Emperor of Morocco's do-
minions and the Negroes. It is filled
with wild beasts, and the Moors chiefly
use it for hunting--From this place I
thought I saw the top of the mountain
Tenerifi' in the Canaries; and twice in vain
I tried to attain it.

Early one morning we anchored under a
little point of land; and the tide beginning
to flow, we lay ready to go further in. But
Xury, whose youthful and penetrating eyes
were sharper than mine, in a soft tone, de-
sired me to" keep far from land, lest we
should be devoured, " For look yonder,
master," said he, " and see de dreadful
monster fast asleep on de side of de hill."
-----Accordingly looking where he pointed,
I espied a fearful monster indeed. It was
a terrible great lion that lay on shore cover-
ed as it were by a shade of a piece of the
hill. " Xury," said I, " you shall go on
shore and kill him." But the boy looking
amazed: " Me kill him 1" says he, " he eat
me at one mouth;" meaning one mouthful.
Upon which I bid him lie still, and charg-
ing my biggest gun with two slugs, and a
good charge of powder, I took the best aim
I could to shoot him through the head, but
his leg lying over his nose, the slug broke
his knee bone. The lion awaking with the
pain, got up, but soon fell down, giving the
most hideous groan I ever heard: but tak-
ing my second piece, I shot him through
the head, and then he lay struggling for
life. Upon this Xury took heart, and dc.
sired my leave to go on shore. " Go then,"
said 1. Upon which, taking a little gun in
one hand, he swam to shore with the other,
and coming close to the lion, put a period
to his life by shooting him again through
the head.

But this was spending our ammunition
in vain, the flesh not being good to eat.
Xury was like a champion, and came on
board for a hatchet, to cut off the head of
his enemy; but not having strength to per-
form it, he cut off and brought me a foot.
I bethought me, however, that his skin
would be of use. This work cost Xury and
me a whole day; when spreading it on the
top of our cabin, the hot beams of the sun
effectually dried it in two days' time, and
it afterwards served me fora bed to lie on.

And now we sailed southerly, living
sparingly on our provisions, and went no
oftener on shore than we were obliged for
fresh water. My design was to make the
river Gambia or Senegal, or any where
about the Cape de Verde, in hopes 'to meet
some European ship. If providence did
not so favour me, my next course was to
seek for the islands, or lose my life amongst
the Negroes.

One day as we were sailing along, we
saw people stand on the shore looking at
us; we could also perceive they were black
and stark naked. I was inclined to go on
shore, but Xury cried, "No no;" however,
I approached nearer, and I found they run
along the shore by me a good way. They
had no weapons in their hands, except one,
who held a long stick, which Xury told me
was a lance, with which they could kill at
a great distance. I talked to them by signs,
and made them sensible I wanted some-
thing to eat; they beckoned me to stop my
boat, while two of them ran up into the
country, and in less than half an hour came
back, and brought with them two pieces of
dried flesh and some corn, which we gladly
accepted; and to prevent any fears on ei-
ther side, they brought the food to' the
shore, laid it down, then went and stood a
great way off till we fetched it on board,
and then came close to us again.

The Negroes having kindly furnished
me with water, and with what roots and
grains their country afforded, I took my
leave, and after eleven days' sail, came in
sight of the Cape de Verde, and those
islands called by its name; when on a sud-
den, Xury cried out, "Master! Master! a
ship with a sail !" and looked as afi'righted
as if it was his master's ship sent in search
of us. ButI soon discovered she was a
Portuguese ship. Upon whichI strove for
life to come up to them. But vain had it
been, if through their perspective glasses
they had not perceived me and shortened
their sail to let me come up. ; Encouraged
at this, I fired a gun, as a signal of distress;
upon which they very kindly lay to, so
that in three hours time I came up with
them. They spoke to me in Portuguese,
Spanish, and French, but none of these did
I understand; till at length a Scots sailor
called, and then I told him I was an Eng'
lishman, who had escaped from the Moors
at Salee; upon which they took me kindly
on board, with all my effects.

Surely none can express the inconceiva-
ble joy I felt at this happy deliverance!
who from being a late miserable and for-
lorn creature, was not only relieved, but in
favour with the master of the ship, to whom
in return for my deliverance, I offered all
I had. But he nobly refused any recom-
pence, and insisted upon paying for my
boat its full value. He gave me sixty
pieces for my boy Xury. It was with
great reluctance I was prevailed upon to
sell the child's liberty, who had served me
so faithfully; but he was willing himself;
and it was agreed, that after ten years he
should be made free, upon his renouncing
mahometanism, and embracing Christianity.

Having a pleasant voyage to the Brazils,
we arrived in the Bay de Todos los Santos.
or All Saints Bay, in twenty-two days after;
I cannot forget the generous treatment of
the captain. He would take nothing for
my passage, gave me twenty ducats for the
leopard's skin, and thirty for the lion's. In
short I made about 220 pieces of my cargo;
and with this stock I entered once more
into the scene of life;

Being recommended to an honestplanter,
I lived with him till I was informed of the
manner of their planting and making sugar;
and seeing how well they lived, and how'
suddenly they grew rich, I resolved to get
the money I had left in England remitted
to me, and to purchase a plantation.

I bought a settlement next to an honest
and kind neighbour, born at Lisbon, of
English parents,- whose plantation joining
mine, we improved it very amicably to-
gether. Both our stocks Were low,.and
for two years we planted only for food:
but the third we planted some tobacco,

and each of us dressed a large piece of
C
ground the ensuing year for canes. I now
found how much I wanted assistance, and
repented the loss of my dear boy Xury.

I was in some measure settled, before
the captain departed from the Brazils.
One dayI went to him, and told him what
stock I had in London, desiring his assis-
tance in getting it remitted; to which be
readily consented, but would only have me
send for half my money, lest it should mis-
carry.--His kindness towards me was great,
for he not only procured the money I had
drawn for, but sent me over a servant with
a cargo proportionable to my condition;
together with tools of all sorts, iron-work,
and utensils necessary for my plantation.

Uncommon success crowning my pros-
perous labours, I might have rested happy
in that middle state of life my father had
so often recommended; but again I left
this happy station from a foolish ambition
of rising ; and, once more, cast myself into
the greatest gulph of misery that ever a
poor creature fell into. Having lived four
years in Brazil, I had not only learned the
language, but contracted acquaintance with
the most eminent planters; to whom, once
having given an account of my two voyages
to the coast of Guinea, and the manner of
trading there for mere trifles, by which our
plantations were furnished with Negroes,
they gave such attention to what I said,
that three of them came one morning, and
proposed to me a voyage to Guinea, in or--
der to stock the plantation with Negroes,
which, as they could not be publicly sold,
they would divide among them; and if I
would go their super-cargo to manage the
trading part, I should have an equal share
of the Negroes, without providing any
stock. I could not resist the proposal,
but accepted the offer upon condition of
their looking after my plantation.

The ship being fitted out, and all things
ready, we set sail the first of September,

1659, being the same day eight years I left
C 2
my father and mother in Yorkshire. We
sailed northward upon the coast, in order
to gain Africa, till we made Cape Augus-
tine; from whence going farther into the
ocean out of sight of land, we steered as
though we were bound for the Isle Fernand
de Norenba, leaving the islands on the east;
and then it was that we met with a terrible
tempest, which continued twelve days, the
winds carrying us wherever they pleased.
In this perplexity one of our men died,
and another and a boy were washed over--
board. When the weather cleared up a
little, we found ourselves in eleven degrees
north latitude, upon the coast of Guinea.
Upon this the captain gave reasons for re-
turning; which I opposed, counselling
him to stand away for Barhadoes, which,
as I supposed, might be attained in fifteen
days. So altering our course, we sailed
north-west and by west, in order to reach
the Leeward Islands; but a second storm
succeeding, drove us to the westward; so
that we were afraid of falling into the
hands of cruel savages, or the paws of de-
vouring beasts of prey.

In this great distress one of our men,
early in the morning, cried out, " Land,
land l" which he had no sooner said, -but
our ship struck upon a sand-bank, and in
a moment the sea broke over her in such a
manner, that we expected we should all
have perished immediately. We knew not
where we were, or upon what land we were
driven; and we could not so much as hope
that the ship would hold out manyminutes,
without breaking in pieces, except the
wind, by a miracle, should change imme--
diately. While we stood looking at one
another, expecting death every moment,
the mate laid hold of the boat, and with
the help of the rest flung her over the ship's
side, and getting all into her, being eleven
of us, committed ourselves to God's mercy
and the wild sea. When we had rowed, or

rather were driven about a league and a
C 3
half, a raging wave, like a lofty mountain,
came rolling a-stern of us, and took us with
such fury, that at once it overset the boat.

Men are generally counted insensible
when struggling in the pangs of death; but
whi-Ie I was overwhelmed with water, I had
the most dreadful apprehensions imagi--
nable. For thejoys of heaven and the tor-
ments of hell seemed to present themselves
before me in these dying agonies. I was
going I thoughtI knew not whither, into a
dismal gulph unknown, never to behold my
friends, nor the light of this world any
more! I strove, however, to the last ex-'
tremity, while all my companions were
overpowered and entombed in the deep:
and it was with great difficulty I kept my
breath till the wave spent itself, and retir-
ing back, left me on the shore half dead.
As soon as I got on my feet, I ran as fast
as Icould, lest another wave should pursue
me, and carry me back again. The sea
came after me like a high mountain, or
furious enemy. The next dreadful wave
buried me at once twenty or thirty feet
deep, but at the same time carried me with
a mighty force and swiftness towards the
shore; when raising myself, I held out till
the water having spent itself, began to re-
turn, at which I struck forward, and feel-~
ing ground with my feet, I took to my heels
again. I was at length dashed against a
piece of rock, in such a manner as left me
senseless; but recovering a little before the
return of the ane, which, no doubt, would
have overwhelmed me, Ipushed hastily for-
ward and reached the main land, when
clambering up the clifts of the shore, tired
and almost spent, I sat down on the grass,r
free from the dangers of the foaming-ocean.

No tongue can express the ecstasies and
transports that my soul felt at the happy
deliverance. I was wrapt in contemplation,
and often lifted up my hands, with the pro-
foundest humility, to the Divine Powers,
for saving my life, when the rest of my
companions were all drowned. I cast my
eyes around,- to behold what place I was
in, and what I had next to do. I could
see no house nor people; I was wet, yet
had no clothes; hungry and thirsty, yet
had nothing to eat or drink; no weapon to
destroy any creatures for my sustenance,
nor defend myself against devouring beasts;
in short, I had nothing but a knife, 21 to--
bacco pipe, and a box half filled with
tobacco. The darksome night coming
upon me, increased my fears of being de-
voured by wild creatures; my mind was
plunged in despair, and having no pros-
pect, asI thought, of life before me, I pre--
pared for another kind of death than what
I had lately escaped. I walked about a
furlong to see if I could find any fresh
water, which I did to my great joy; and
taking a quid of tobacco to prevent hunger,
I got up into a thick bushy tree, and seat-
ing myself so that I could not fall, a deep
sleep overtook me, and for that night buri-
ed my sorrows in quiet repose. _

It was broad day the next morning be-
fore I awaked; when I not only perceived
the tempest had ceased, but saw the ship
driven almost as far as the rock which the
waves had dashed me against, and which
was about a mile from the place where I
was. When I came down from my apart-
ment in the tree, I perceived the ship's
boat two miles distant on my right hand,
lying on shore, as the waves had cast her.
I thought to have got to her; but there be-
ing an inlet of water of about half a mile's
breadth between it and me, I returned
again towards the ship, as hoping to find
something for my immediate subsistence.
About noon, when the sea was calm, re-
solving to get to the ship, I stripped and
leapt into the water; it was my good for--
tune to espy a small piece of rope hanging
so low, that by the help of it, though with
great difficulty, I got into the ship. The
provisions I found in good order, with
which I crammed my pockets, and losing
no time, ate whileI was doing other things;
I also found some rum, of which I took a
hearty dram; and now I wanted for no-
thing except a boat to carry away what
was needful for me.

Necessity quickeus invention. We had
several spare yards, a spare topmast or
two, and two or three large spars of wood.
With these I fell to work, and flung as
many of them overboard as I could manage,
tying every one of them with a rope, that
they might not drive away. This done, I
went down to the ship's side, and tied four
of them fast together at both ends, in form
of a raft, and laying two or three short
pieces of plank upon them crossways, I
found it would bear me, but not any con-
siderable weight. Upon which 1 went to
work again, cutting a spare topmast into
three lengths, adding them to my raft with
a great deal of labour and pains. I then
considered what I should load it with, it
being not able to bear a ponderous burden.
And this I soon thought of; first laying
upon it all the planks and boards I could
get, next I lowered down three of the
seamen's chests, after I had filled them
with bread, rice, three Dutch cheeses, five
pieces of dried goat's flesh, and some Eu<<
ropean corn; and for liquors, Ifound se-
veral cases of bottles belonging to our
skipper, in which were some cordial waters,
and four or five gallons of rack, which I
stowed by themselves. By this time the
tide beginning to flow, I perceived my
coat, waistcoat, and shirt swim away,
which I left on the shore; as for my linen
breeches and stockings, I swam with them
to the ship; but I soon faund clothes
enough, though I took no more than I
wanted for the present. My eyes were
chiefly on tools to work with; and, after
a long search, I found out the carpenter's
chest, which I got safe down on my raft.
I then looked for arms and ammunition,
and in the great cabin found two good
fowling pieces, two pistols, several powder
horns filled, a small bag of shot, and two
old rusty swords. I likewise found three
barrels of powder, two of which were good;
also two or three broken oars, two saws,
an axe, and a hammer. I then put to sea,
and in getting to shore had three encourage-
ments. 1. A smooth calm sea. 2. The
tide rising and setting in to shore. 3.
The little wind there was blew towards
the land. After Ihad sailed about a mile,
I found the raft drive a little distance from
the place where I first landed; and then I
perceived a little opening of the land, with
a strong current of the tide running into
it: upon which I kept the middle of the
stream. But great was my concern, when
on a sudden the fore part of my raft ran
aground, so that had I not, with great dif-
ficulty, for near half an hour, kept my back

I.>>
straining against the chests to keep my ef--
fects in their places, all I had would have
gone into the sea. But after some time,
the rising of the water caused the raft to
float again, and coming up a little river
with land on both sides, I landed ina cave,
as near the mouth as possible, the better to
discover a sail, if any providentially passed
that way.

Not far off, I espied a hill of stupendous
height, surrounded with lesser hills, and
thither I was resolved to go and view the
country, that I might see what part was
best to fix my habitation. Accordingly,
arming myself with a pistol, a fowling-piece,
powder and ball, I ascended the mountain.
There I perceived I was in an island, en-
compassed by the sea, no distant lands to
be seen but scattering rocks that lay to
the west: it seemed to be a barren place,
inhabited only by wild beasts. I perceived
abundance of fowls, but ignorant of what

kind, or whether good for nourishment;
D
I shot one of them at my return, which ocw
casioned a confused screaming among the
other birds, and I found it, by its colour
and beak, to be a kind of hawk, but its
flesh was perfect carrion.

W hen I came to my raft, I brought my
effects on shore, and fearing that some
cruel beasts might devour me in the night
time, I made a kind of but or barricade
with the chests and boards. I slept very
comfortably; and the next morning got on
board as before, and prepared a second
raft far nicer than the first, upon which I
brought away the carpenter's stores, two
or three bags full of nails, a great jack-
screw, a dozen or two of hatchets, and a
grind--stone. Two or three iron crows, two
barrels of musket--bullets, another fowling
piece, a small quantity of powder, and a
large bag full of small shot. Besides these,
I took all the men's clothesI could find, a
spare fore top--sail, a hammock, and some
bedding; and thus completing my second
cargo, I made all the haste to shore I could,
fearing some wild beast might destroy what
I had there already. But I only found a
little wild cat sitting on one of the chests,
which seeming not to fear me or the'gun
that I presented at her, I thrEw her a piece
of biscuit, which she instantly eat and
departed.

When I had got these effects on shore,
I went to work, in order to make me a little
tent with the sail andsome poles which I
had cut for that purpose; and having fl--
nished it, what things might be damaged by
the weather I brought in, piling all the
empty chests and casks in a circle, the bet
ter to fortify it against any sudden attempt
of man or beast. After this I blocked up
the doors with some boards, charged my
gun and pistol, and laying my bed on the
ground, slept comfortably till next morning.

Now, though Ihad enough to subsist me
a long time, yet despairing of a sudden de-

liverance, I coveted as much as I could}
D2
and so long as the ship remained in that
condition, I daily brought away one ne-
cessary or other; particularly the rigging,
sails, and cordage, some twine, a barrel
of wet powder, some sugar, a barrel of
meal, three easks of rum, and, what indeed
was most welcome to me, a whole hogs-
head of bread.

Thirteen days I had now been in the
island, and eleven times on board, bringing
away all that was possible. As I was going
the twelfth time, the wind began to rise;
however I ventured at low water, and rum~
waging the cabin, in a locker I found se-
veral razors, scissors, and some dozens of
knives and forks; and in another thirty-
six pounds of pieces of eight, silver and
gold. "Ah! simple vanity," said I, " whom
"this world so much dates on, where is
"now thy virtue, thy excellency to me?
" You cannot procure me one thing need-
"ful, nor remove me from this desolate
". island to a place of plenty. One of these
"knives, so meanly esteemed, is to me
"preferable to all this heap. E'en, there-
"fore, remain where thou art, to sink in
"the deep as unregardcd, even as a crea-
" ture whose life is not worth preserving."
Yet, after all, I wrapt it up in a piece of
canvas, and began to think of making ano-
ther raft: butI soon perceived the wind
began to rise, a fresh gale blowing from the
shore, and the sky overcast with clouds
and darkness; so thinking a raft to be in
vain, I let myself into the water, with what
things I had about me, and it was with
much difficulty I got ashore, when soon
after it blew a fearful storm.

That night I slept very contentedly in
my little tent, surrounded with all my ef--
fects; but when I looked out in the morn-
ing, no more ship was to be seem--My
next thoughts were, how I should secure
myself from savages and wild beasts, if any
such were in the island. At one time I

thought of digging a cave; at another I was
D S
for erecting a tent; and, at length I re-
solved to do both.

I found a little plain near a rising hill,
the front towards which being as steep as
a house-side, nothing could descend on me
from the top. On the side of this rock
was a little hollow place, resembling the
entrance or door of a cave. Just before
this place, on the circle of the green, I re-
solved my tent should stand. This plain
did not much exceeda hundred yards broad,
and about twice as long, like a delightful
green before my door, with apleasing tho'
an irregular descent every way to the low
grounds by the sea-side, lying on the N. W.
side of the hill; so that it was sheltered
from the excessive heat of the sun. After
this, [drew a semi--circle, containing ten
yards in a semi-diameter and twenty yards
in the whole, driving down two rows of
strong stakes, not six inches from each
other. Then with a piece of cable which
I had cut on board, I regularly laid them
in acircle between the piles up to their
tops, which Were more than five feet out
of'the earth, and after drove another row
of piles looking within side against them,
between two or three feet high, which
made me conclude it a little impregnable
castle against men and beasts. .And for
my better security I would have no door,
but entered in and came out by the help
of a ladder, which I also made.

Here was my fence and fortress, into
which I carried all my riches, ammunition
and stores. After which, working on the
rock, what with dirt and stones I dug out,
I not only raised my ground two feet, but
made a little cellar to my mansion-house;
and this cost me many days labour and
pains. One day, inparticular, a shower
of .rain falling, thunder and lightning en-
'sued, which put me in terror lest my pow
der should take fire, To prevent which,
I fell to making boxes and bags, in order
to separate it, having by me near 1501bs.
weight. And thus being established as
king of the island, every day I Went out
with my gun to see what I could kill that
was fit to eat. I soon perceived numbers
of goats, and shot one suckling a young
kid; which not thinking its dam slain,
stood by her unconcerned; and when I
took the dead creature up, the young one
followed me even to the inclosure. I lifted
the kid over the pales, and would willingly
have kept it alive; but finding it would
not eat, I killed that also.

It was by the account I kept, the 30th
of September, when I first landed on this
island. About twelve days after, fearing
lest I should lose my reckoning of time,
nay, even forget the sabbath days, for
want of pen, ink, and paper, I carved with
a knife upon a large post, in great letters,
these words, I came on shore, Sept. 30,,
1659. Every day I cut a notch with my
knife on the sides of this square post, and
that on the sabbath was as long again asor nomxsozv CRUSOE. 45'

the rest; and every first day of the month
as long again as that long one. HadI
made a more strict search I need not have
set up this mark; for among my parcels I
found the very things Iwanted; particu-
larly pens, ink, and paper: also two or three
compasses, some mathematical instruments,
dials, perspective glasses, books of navi-
gation, three English bibles, and several
other good books, which I carefully put
up.--A dog and two cats on board, I made
inhabitants with me in my castle. Though
one might think I had all the necessaries
that were desirable, yet still I found several
things wanting. My ink was daily wasting;
I wanted needles, pins, and thread, to
mend my clothes; and particularly a spade,
pickaxc, or shovel, to remove the earth.
It was a year before I finished my little
bulwark.

Having raised a turf wall against the
outside of my habitation, I thatched it so
close as might keep it from the inclemency
of the weather; I also improved it within.
enlarged my cave, and made a passage and
door in the rock, which came out beyond
the pale of my fortification. I next pro-
ceeded to make a chair and a table. When
I wanted a plank or board, I hewed down
a tree with my hatchet, making it as thin
with my axe as possible, and then smooth
enough with an adze to answer my designs:
thus in time I got boards enough to shelter
all my stores.

But now a very strange event happened.
For one day finding a bag, which used to
hold corn for the fowls, I resolved to put
gunpowder in it, and shook all the husks
and dirt upon one side of the rock, little
expecting what the consequence would be.
The rain had fallen plentifully a few days
before; and about a month after, to my
great amazement, something began to look
very green and flourishing; and when I
came to view it more nicely every day as
it grew, I found about ten or twelve ears
of green barley appearing in the very same
shape and make as that in England.

I can scarce express the agitations of
'my mind at this sight. Hitherto I had
looked upon the actions of this life only as
the events of blind chance. But now the
appearance of this barley, flourishing in
a barren soil, and my ignorance in not con~
ceiving how it should come there, made
me conclude, that miracles were not yet
ceased: nay I even thought that God had
appointed it to grow there wituout any
seed, purely for my sustenance in this
miserable and desolate island. And in-

deed such great efl'ect this had upon me,
that it often made me melt into tears,
through a grateful sense of God's mercies;
and the greater still was my thankfulness,
when I perceived about this little field of
barley some rice stalks also, wonderfully
flourishing.

While thus pleased in mind, I concluded
there must be more com in the island; and
therefore made adiligent search among the
rocks; but not being able to find any, on
a sudden it came into my mind, how I had
shaken the husks of corn out of the bag,
and then my admiration ceased, with my
gratitude to the Divine being, as thinking
it was but natural, and not to be conceived
a miracle; though even the manner of its
preservation might have made me own it
was a wonderful event of God's kind Pro-
vidence.

It was about the latter end of June when
the ears of this corn ripened, which I laid
up very carefully, together with twenty or
thirty stalks of rice, expecting one dayI
should reap the fruit of my labour; yet
four years were expired before I could at-
low myself to eat any barley bread, and
much longer time before I had any rice.
After this, with indefatigable pains and in-
dustry, for three or four months, at last I
finished my wall on the 14th of April, ha~
ving no way to go intoit, but by a ladder,
against the walk--April 17th I finished my
ladder and ascended it; afterwards pulled it
up, then let it down on the other side, and
descended into my new habitation, where
I had space enough and so fortified, that
nothing could attack me without scaling
the walls.

But what does all human pains and in:-
dustry avail, if the blessing of God does
not crown our labours? Or who can stand
before the Almighty, when he stretcheth
forth his arm? For one time as I was at
the entrance of my cave, there happened
such a dreadful earthquake, that not only
the roof of the cave came tumbling about

'my ears, but the posts seemed to crack
terribly at the same time. This put me
in great amazement; and running to the
ladder, and getting over the wall, I then
plainly knew it was an earthquake; the
place I stood on sustained three terrible
shocks in less than three minutes. But

judge of my terror when .I saw the top of a
E5O LIFE AND anvzxrunzs

great rock roll into the sea! I then ex-
pected the island would be swalloWed up
every moment: and what made the scene
still more dreadful, was to see the sea
thrown in the most violent agitation and
disorder by this tremendous accident.

For my part, I stood like a criminal at
the place of execution, ready to expire.
At the moving of the earth I was, as it
were, sea-sick; and very much afraid lest
the rock, under which was my defence and
habitation, should overwhelm it and myself
in a lasting tomb.

When the third dreadful shock had spent
itself, my spirits began to revive: yet still
I would not venture to ascend the ladder,
but continued sitting, not knowing what I
should do. So little grace had I then, as
only to say, Lord have mercy upon me! and
no sooner was the earthquake over, but
that pathetic prayer left me.

It was not long after, when a horrible
tempest arose, at the same time attended
with a hurricane of wind. The sea seemed
mountains high, and the waves rolled so
impetuously, that nothing could be per--
ceived but froth and foam. Three hours
did this storm continue, and in so violent
a manner, as to tear the very trees up by
the roots, which was succeeded by abun-
dance of rain. When the tempest was over,I
went to mytent: but the rain coming on
in a furious manner, I was obliged to take
shelter in the cave, where I was forced to
cut a channel through my fortification to
let the water out. It continued mining all
that night, and some time the next day.
These accidents made me resolve, as soon
as the weather cleared up, to build me a
little but in some open place, walled round
to defend me from wild creatures and sa-
vages; not doubting but at the next earth-
quake, the mountain would fall upon my
habitation and me, and swallow up all in
'its bowels.

When I began to put my resolutions in
E 2
practice, I was stopt for want of tools and
instruments to work with. Most of my
axes and hatchets were useless, occasioned
by cutting the hard timber that grew on
the island. It took me up a full week to
make my grindstone of use.

As I walked along the sea-shore, I found
a barrel of gunpowder, and several pieces
of the wreck, the sea had flung up. Ha:
ving secured these, I made to the ship,
whose stern was torn off, and washed at
great distance ashore; but the rest lay in
the sands.

At this time I was afflicted with an ague;
thirsty, yet could not help myself to water:
Prayed to God in these words: " Lord in
" pity look upon me: Lord have mercy
" upon. me: have mercy upon me !" After
this I fell asleep, and dreamt.

Something refreshed with sleep, I arose;
and, after eating some turtle's eggs, I at-
tempted to walk again out of doors with
my gun; but was so weak, that I sat down,
and looked at the sea, which was smooth
and calm. While I continued'here, these
thoughts came into my mind.

In what manner is the production of the
earth and sea, of which I have seen so
much? From whence came myself, and
all other creatures living, and of what are
they made?

Our beings were assuredly created by
some almighty invisible Power, who framed
the earth, the sea, the air, and all therein.
But what is that Power '!

Certainly it must follow, that God has
created all. Yet, said I, if God has made-
all this, he must be the Ruler of all, for
certainly the Power that makes must in--
disputably be able to guide and direct:
them. And if so, nothing can happen
without his knowledge and appointment.
Then certainly God has appointed these
my sufferings. I then proceeded to en-

quire, why should God deal with me in
E3
this manner? Or what had I done to de~
serve his indignation?

Here conscience cried with a loud and
piercing voice, " Unworthy wretch! how
" darest thou ask what thou hast done'!
" Look on thy past life and see what thou
" hast left undone! Ask thyself, why thou
" wert not long ago in the merciless hands
" of death? Why not drowned in Yai-f
" mouth roads, or killed in the fight, when
" the ship was taken by the Salee man of
" war? Why not entombed in the bowels
" of the wild beasts on the African coast, or
" drowned here when all thy companions
" suffered shipwreck in the ocean 2"

Struck dumb with these reflections, I
rose, being so thoughtful that I could not
sleep; and fearing the dreadful return of
my distemper. I recollected that the
Brazilians use tobacco for almost all dis-
cases, and going to my chest in order to
find some, Heaven, no doubt, directed me
to a cure for both soul and body; for there
I found one of the bibles, which, till this
time, Ihad neither leisure nor inclination
to look into.- And no sooner did I open
it, but there appeared to me these words,
" Call on me in the day of trouble, and Iwill
" deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me."

At first, this sentence made a very deep
impression on my heart, but it soon were
off again, when I considered the Word
deliver was foreign to me. And as the
children of Israel said, when they were
promised flesh to eat, " Can God spread
" a table in the wilderness?" In like man-
ner I began to say, " Can God himself
" deliver me from this desolate island 'l"
However, the words still returned to my
mind, and afterwards made a greater im-
pression upon me.

As it was now very late, I felt inclined
to sleep; but before I would lie down I fell
on my knees, and implored the promise
that God had made me in the Holy Scrip-
ture, that "if I called upon him in the day
" of trouble, he would deliver me." With
much difficulty,- I afterwards drank the
rum,- wbereinI had steeped the tobacco,
which flying into my head, threw me into
such a, profound sleep, that it was three
o'clock the next day before I awoke; in-
deed I believe I slept two days, having
lost a day in my account. When I got up,
my spirits were lively and cheerful; I was
very hungry; and, in short, no fit returned
the next day, but I found myself much
altered for the better.

I had now been about ten months in the
island; and, as I never had seen any of
the human kind, I accounted myself as
sole monarch; and as I grew better, lia-
ving secured my habitation to my mind, I
resolved to make a tour round my king-
dom, in order to make new discoveries.

The 15th of July I began my journey;
I first went to the creek, where I had
brought my rafts on shore; and travelling
farther, found that the tide went no higher
than two miles up, where there was alittle
brook of running water, on the banks of
which were many pleasant savannahs or
meadows, plain, smooth, and covered with
grass. On the rising parts, where I sup-
posed the water did not reach, I perceived
a great deal of tobacco growing to a very
strong stalk. Several other plants I like-
wise found, the virtues of which I did not
understand. I searched a long time for
the Cavassa root, which I knew the Indians
in that climate made their bread of, but
all in vain. There were several plants of
aloes, though at that time I knew not what
they were; I saw also several sugar canes,
but imperfect for want of cultivation. With
these few discoveries, I came back that
night and slept contentedly in my little
castle.

The next day, going the same way. but
farther than the day before, I found the
country more adorned with woods and
trees. Here I perceived different fruits
in great abundance. Melons in plenty lay
on the ground, and clusters of grapes, ripe
and very rich, spread over the trees. You
may imagine I was glad of the discovery,
yet eat very sparingly. The grapes I
found of excellent use; for when I had
dried them in the sun, which preserved
them as dried raisins are kept, they proved
very wholesome and nourishing, and served
me in those seasons when no grapes were
to be had. The night drawing on apace,
I ascended a tree, and slept very com-
fortably, though it was the first time I had
lain out of my habitation. And when the
morning came, I proceeded with great
pleasure on my way, travelling about. four
miles, as I imagined. by the length of the
valley, directing my course northward.
At the end of the valley, Icame to an
opening, where the country seemed to de-
scend to the west: there I found alittle
spring of fresh water, proceeding out qt:
the side of the hill, with its crystal streams
running directly east. And indeed, here
my senses were charmed with the most
beautiful landscape nature could afford;
for the country appeared flourishing, green
and delightful. I then descended on the
side of that delicious vale, when I found
abundance of cocoa, orange, lemon, and
citron trees, but very wild and barren at
that time. The limes were delightful and
wholesome, and the juice, mixed in water,
was very cooling and'refreshing. I re-
solved to carry home a store of grapes,
limes, and lemons, against the approach-
ing wet season; and returned to my little

castle, after having spent three days in
this journey.

And now contemplating the fruitfulness
of this valley, its security from storms,
and the delightfulness of the adjacent
woods, I resolved to make a little kind of
bower, surrounding it with a double hedge,
as high as I could reach, well staked and
filled with bulrushes: and having spent a
great part of the month of July, I think it
was the first of August before I began to
enjoy my labour.

On the 30th September, casting up the
notches on my post, which amounted to
365, I concluded this to be the anniversary
of my landing; and, therefore, humbly
prostrating myself on the ground, confes--
sing my sins, acknowledging God's righ-
teous judgments upon me, and praying to
Jesus Christ to have mercy upon me, I
fasted for twelve hours till the going down
of the sun; and then eating a biscuit and
a bunch of grapes, laid me on the bed, and
with great comfort took my night's repose.
You may call to mind what I have men-
tioned of some barley and rice which I had
saved, about thirty stalks of the former,
and twenty of the latter; and, at that time,
the sun being in its southern position, go-
ing from me, together with the rains, made
me conclude it avery proper season to sow
it. Accordinglyl dug up a piece of ground
with my wooden spade, and dividing it
into two parts, sowed about two-thirds of
my seed, preserving by me about a hand-
ful of each. And happy it was I did so;
for no rains falling, it was choaked' up,
and never appeared above the earth till the
wet season came again; and then part of
it grew as if it had been newly sown.

I was resolved still to make another
trial; and seeking 'for a moister piece of
ground near my bower, I sowed the rest
of my seed in February, a little before the
vernal equinox; which having the rainy
months of March and April to water it,
yielded anoble crop. I had still saved part
of the seed, not daring to venture all; and
by the time I found out the proper Seasons
to sow it in, and thatI might expect every
{ear two seed-times and two harvests, my
stock amounted to above half a peck of
each sort of grain.

No sooner were the rains over, but the
F
stakes which I had cut from the trees, shot
out like willows, the first year after lop-
ping their heads. Iwas ignorant of the
tree I cut them from: but they grew so re-
gularly beautiful, that they made a most
lively appearance, and so flourished in
three years time, that I resolved to cut
more of them; and these soon growing,
made a glorious fence.

And now I perceived that the seasons of
the year might generally be divided not
into summer and winter, as in Europe, but
into wet and dry seasons.

The wet season continued longer or
shorter as the winds happened to blow.
But having found the ill consequences of
being abroad in the rain, I took care be-
forehand to furnish myself with provisions;
and during the wet months, sat within
doors as much as possible. At this time
I contrived to make many things I wanted.
The first I tried was a basket; but all the
twigs' proved so brittle, that I could not
perform it. When a boy, I took great de-
light in standing atahasket--maker's in the
same town where my father lived, to View
them work; and like other boys, curious
and very oflicious to assist, I perfectly
learned the method, and wanted nothing
but tools. And recollecting that the twigs
of the tree of which I made my stakes,
might be as tough as osiers, growing in
England, I resolved to make an experiment,
went the next day to my country seat, and
after cutting down a quantity, I dried
them, and when fit to work, carried them
to my cave, where I employed myself in
making several sorts of baskets. It is true,
they were not cleverly made, yet they
served my turn upon all occasions.

Still I had no cask to hold my liquor:
neither had I a pot to boil any thing in.
I wanted likewise at the beginning of this
dry season, a tobacco pipe.

I now resumed my intention of explor-
ing the island; and taking my dog, gun,

F 2
hatchet, two biscuit cakes, a great bunch
of raisins, with a larger quantity of powder
and shot than usual, I began my journey.
Having passed the vale where my bower
stood, I came within view of the sea, lying
to the west; when it being a clear day, I
descried land, extending from the W. to
the S. W. about ten or fifteen leagues, but
could not say whether it was an island or
continent.

As I proceeded forward, I found this
side of the island much more pleasant than
mine; the fields fragrant, adorned with
sweet flowers and verdant grass, together
with several very fine woods. There were
parrots in plenty, which made me long for
one to be my companion; but it was with
great difficulty I could knock one down;
and I kept him some years before I could
get him to call me by my name.

In the low grounds, I found various sorts
of hares and foxes, but different from those
in England. Several of these I killed, but
never eat them; neither, indeed, had I
any occasion, for abounding with goats,
pigeons, turtle, and grapes, I could defy
Leadenhall market to furnish me a better
table. When I came to the sea-shore, I
was amazed at the splendour. The strand
was covered with shells of the most beauti-
ful fish, and abounding with innumerable
turtles, and fowls of many kinds. I might
have shot as many as I pleased, but was
sparing of my ammunition, rather choosing
to kill a she-goat, which I did with much
difficulty, on account of the flatness of
the country.

I continued my journey, travelling about
twelve miles further towards the east,
where I set a great pile on the shore for a
mark.-----In this journey my dOg surprised
a kid, and would have killed it, had I not
prevented him. As I had often been think--
ing of getting a kid or two, and so raising
a breed of tame goats to supply me after

my ammunition was spent, I took this op-
F 3
portnnity of beginning: and having made
a collar for this little creature, with a
string of rope-yarn, I brought it to my
bower, and there inclosed and left him;
and having spent a month in this journey,
at length I returned to my own habitation,
and rested myself a week, which time I
employed in making a cage for my pretty
Poll. Inow recollected my poor kid I had
left in the bower, and immediately went to
fetch it home. When I came there, I found
it almost starved: I gave it some food, and
it followed me like a dog; and as I con~
stantly fed it, it became so loving, gentle,
and fond, that it would never leave me.
The rainy season of the autumnal equi-
nox being now come, I kept the 30th of
September in the most solemn manner, as
usual: it being the third year of my abode
in the island. I spent the whole day in
acknowledging God's mercies, in giving
him thanks for making this solitary life as
agreeable and less sinful, than that of hut--
man society; and for the communications
of his grace to my soul, in supporting,
comforting, and encouraging me to depend
upon his Providence, and hope for his eter-
ual presence in the world to come.

One morning, opening my bible, I int-
mediately fixed my eyes upon these words,
" I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee!"
Surely, thought I, these words are directed
to me; and if God does not forsake, what
matter is it, since he can make me more
happy in this state of life, than if I enjoyed
the greatest splendour in the world 'I I
shut the bible and blessed kind Providence,
that directed my good friend in England
to send it without any order, and for as-
sisting me to save it from the power of the
raging ocean.

And now beginning my third year, my
several daily employments were these:--
First, My duty to Heaven, and diligently
reading the Holy Scriptures; which I did
twice or thrice every day: Secondly, Seek~
ing provisions with my gun, which com-
monly employed me, when it did not rain,
three hours every morning: T hirdly, The
ordering, curing, preserving, and cooking
what I killed, for my supply, which took
me up great part of the day. Iwas no
less than two and forty days making a
board fit for a long shelf, which two saw-
yers, with their tools and saw-pit, would
have cut off the same tree in half a day.
It was a large tree, as my board was to be
broad. I was three days in cutting it down,
and two more in lopping off the boughs,
and reducing it to a piece of timber. This
I hacked and hewed off each side, till it
became light to move: and then I turned
it, made one side of it smooth and flat as
a board from end to end, then turned it
downwards, cutting the other side, tillI
brought the plank to be about three inches
thick, and smooth on both sides.

The harvest months, November and
December, were now at hand, in which I
had the pleasing prospect of a very good
crop. But here I met with a new misfor-
tune; for the goats and hares having tasted
the sweetness of the blade, kept it so short,
that it had not strength to shoot up into a
stalk. To prevent this, I enclosed it with
a hedge, and by day shot some of its de-
vourers; and my dog, which I tied to the
field gate, barking all night, so frightened
those creatures, that I got entirely rid
of them.

But no sooner did I get rid of these,
than other enemies appeared, whole flocks
of several sorts of birds only waited till
my back was turned to ruin me. So much
did this provoke me, that I let fly, and
killed three of the malefactors; and after-
wards served them as they do notorious
thieves in England, hung them up in chains,
as a terror to others. And so good an cf.
fact had this, that they not only forsook
the corn, but all that part of the island,
so long as these criminals hung there.
My corn having ripened apace, the lat-
ter end of December, which was my second
harvest, I reaped it with a scithe, made of
one of my broad swords. I had no fatigue
in cutting down my first crop, it was so
slender. The cars I carried home in a
basket, rubbing it with my hands, instead
of threshing it; and when the harvest was
over, found my half peek of seed produced
near two bushels of rice, and two bushels
and a half of barley. I knew not how to
grind my corn, neither how to bake the
bread.

The want of a plough to turn up the
earth, or shovel to dig it, I conquered by
making a wooden spade. The want of a
barrow I supplied by dragging 'over the.
com a great bough of a tree.' When it
was growing I was forced to fence it;
when ripe to mow it, carry it home, thrt'sh
it, and part it from the chaff. And, after
all, Iwantcd a mill to grind it, sieve to
dress it, yeast and salt to make it into brcid,
and an oven to bake it. This set my brains
to work to find some expedient for every
one of these necessaries against the next
harvest.

And now having more seed, my first
care was to pr'epare more land. I pitched
upon two large flat pieces of ground near
my castle, for that purpose, in which I
sowed my seed, and fenced it with a good
hedge. This took me up three months:
by which time the wet season coming on,
and the rain keeping me within doors, I
found several occasions to employ myself;
and, while at work, used to divert myself
in talking to my parrot, learning him to
know and speak his own name Poll, the
first welcome word I ever heard spoke in
the island. I'had been a long time con-
triving how to make earthen vessels, which
I Wanted extremely, and when I considered
the heat of the climate, I did' not doubt
but if I could find any such clay, I might
make a pot, strong enough when dried in
the sun, to bear handling, and to hold any
thing that was dry, as corn, meal, and
other things.

The clay I found; but it would make
the most serious person smile, to see what
awkward, ugly, mishapen things I made;
how many cracked by the violent heat of
the sun, and fell in pieces when they were
removed: so that I think it was two months
before I could perfect any thing; and even
then but two clumsy things in imitation of
earthen jars. As for the smaller things, I
made them with better success; such as
little round pots, flat dishes, pitchers, and
pipkins, the sun baking them very hard.

Yet still I wanted one thing absolutely
necessary, and that was an earthen pot,
not only to hold my liquid, but also to bear
the fire, which none of these could do. It
once happened, that as I was putting out
my fire, I found therein a broken piece of
one of my vessels burnt as hard as a rock,
and red as a tile. This made me think of
burning some pots, and having no notion
of a kiln, or of glazing them with lead, I
fixed three large pipkins, and two or thee
pots in a pile one upon another. The tire
I piled round the outside, and dry wood
upon the top, till I saw the pots in the in-
side red hot, and found that they were not
cracked at all: and when I perceived them
perfectly red, I let one of them stand in
the fire about five or six hours, till the
clay melted by the extremity of the heat,
and would have run to glass had I suffered
it: upon whichI slackened my fire by de--
grees, till the redness abated; and watch-
ing them till morning, I found I had three
very good pipkins, and two earthen pots,
as well burnt as I could desire.

No joy could be greater than mine at
this discovery. I filled one of my pipkins
with water to boil me some meat.

The next concern I had, was to get me
a'stone mortar to beat some corn in, in-

stead of a mill to grind it. But all the
G
stones of the island being of a mouldering
nature, I resolved to look out for a great
block of hard wood, which having found,
I formed it with my axe and hammer, and
then, with infinite labour, made a hollow
in it, just as the Indians of Brazil make
their canoes. When I had finished this,
I made a great pestle of iron wood, and
then laid them up against my succeeding
harvest.

My next business was to make a sieve to
sift my meal, and part it from the bran
and husk. Having no fine thin canvas, I
could not tell what to do. What linen
I had was reduced to rags: At length I
remembered I had some neckcloths of
cal-.00 or muslin of the sailors, which I had
brought out of the ship, and with these I
made three small sieves, proper enough
for the work.

The want of an oven I supplied by mak-
ing some earthen pans very broad but not
deep. When I had a mind to bake, I made
a great fire upon the hearth, the tiles of
which I had made myself; and when the
wood was burnt into live coals, I spread
them over it, till it became very hot; then
sweeping them away, I set down my loaves,
and turning down the earthen pots upon
them, drew the ashes and coals all round
the outsides of the pots to continue the
heat; and in this manner] baked my bar-
ley loaves, as well as if I had been a com-
plete pastry-cook, and also made of the
rice several cakes and puddings. _

These things took me up the best part
of a year, and what intermediate time I
had was bestowed in managing my new
harvest and husbandry; for in the proper
season I reaped my corn, carried it home,
and laid it up in>> the ear in my large bas-
kets, till I had time to rub, instead of
threshing it.

All this while, the prospect of land,
which I had seen from the bther side of

,the island, ran in mySSmd. I still medi--
' G 2
tated a deliverance from this place, though
the fear of greater misfortunes might have
deterred me from it. For allowing that I
had attained that place, I ran the hazard
of being killed and eaten by the devouring
cannibals; and if they were not so, yet I
might be slain, as other Europeans had
been, who fell into their hands. Notwith-
standing all this, my thoughts ran con--
tinually upon that shore. I wished for my
boy any, and the long boat: the ship's
boat had been cast a great way on the
shore in the late storm. Her bottom being
turned up by the impetuosity and fury of
the waves and wind, I fell to work with all
the strength I had, with levers and rollers
I had cut from the wood, to turn her, and
repair the damages she had sustained. This
work took me up three or four weeks, when
finding my little strength in vain, I fell to
undermining it by digging away the sand,
and so to make it fall down, setting pieces
of wood to thrust and guide it in the fall.
But after this was done, I was still unable
to move it towards the water, and so was
' forced to give it over.

This disappointment, however, did not
frighten me. I began to think whether it
was not possible for me to make a canoe,
such as the Indians make of the trunk of a
tree. But here I lay under particular in-
conveniences; want of tools to make it,
and want of hands to move it in the water
when it was made. However, to workI
went.----I first cut down a cedar tree, which
was five feet ten inches diameter at the
lower part next the stump, and four feet
eleven inches diameter at the end of twenty-
two feet, after which it lessened for a space,
and then parted into branches.' Twenty
days was I a hacking and hewing this tree
at the bottom, fourteen more in cutting off
the branches and limbs, and a whole month
in shaping it like the bottom of a boat.
As for the inside, I was three weeks with

a mallet and chissel clearing it, till it was
G 8
big enough to carry twenty-six men, much
bigger than any canoe I ever saw in my
life, and consequently sufficient to trans-
port me and all my efl'ects to that wished-
for shore.

Nothing remained now, but to get it
into the water, it lying about one hundred
yards from it. I proceeded to measure the
distance of ground, resolving to make a
canal in order to bring the water to the
canoe, since I could not bring the canoe
to the water. But as this seemed to be
impracticable, under the space of eleven
or twelve years, I concluded the attempt
altogether vain. I now saw what stupidity
it is to begin work before we reckon its
cost, orjudge rightly our own abilities to
go through with its performance.

In the height of this work my fourth year
expired, from the time I was cast on this
island. At this time I did not forget my
anniversary; but kept it with rather greater
devotion than before. For now my hopes
being frustrated, I looked upon this world
as a thing I had nothing to do with; and
well might I say, as father Abraham said
unto Dives, " Between thee and me there
" is a gulph fixed." I was separated from
its wickedness too, having neither the lust
of the flesh, the lust of the eye, nor the
pride of life; I had nothing to covet, be-
ing lord, king, and emperor over the whole
country, without dispute and without con-
trol: Corn, plenty of turtles, timber in
abundance, and grapes above measure.
What was all the rest to me'! The money
I had, lay by me as despicable dross,
which I would freely have given for a
gross of tobacco pipes, or a hand-mill to
grind my corn; in a word, the nature and
experience of these things dictated to me
this just reflection: That the good things
of this world are no further good to us,
than they are for our use; and that what-
soever we may heap up to give to others,
we can but enjoy as much as we use.
These thoughts rendered my mind more
easy than usual. Every time I sat down
to meat, I did it with thankfulness, admir-
ing the providential hand of God, who, in
this wilderness, had spread a table for me.

As long as my ink continued, which, with
water, I made last as long as I could, I
used to minute down the days of the month
on which any remarkable event happened.
--And,

First, Iobserved, that the same dayI
forsook my parents and friends, and ran
away to Hull, in order to go to sea: the
same day in the next year, I was taken and
made a slave by the Salee rovers.

That the very day I escaped out of the
wreck of the ship in Yarmouth roads, a
year after on the same day, I made my es--
cape from Salee in my patron's fishing boat.

And, on the 30th of September, being
my birth-day, was I miraculously saved,
and cast ashore on this island.

The next thing that wasted after my ink,
was the biscuits which I had brought out
of the ship; and though I allowed myself
but one cake a day for above a twelve-
month, yet I was quite out of bread for
near a year, before I got any com of
my own.

in the next place, my clothes began to
decay, and my linen had been gone long
before. However, I had preserved about
three dozen of the sailors' chequered shirts,
which proved a great refreshment to me,
when the violent beams of the sun would
not suffer me to bear any of the seamen's
heavy watch-coats; which made me turn
tailor, and after a miserable batching man--
ner, convert them into jackets. To pre-
serve my head, I made a cap of goat's skin,
with the hair outwards to keep out the
rain; and afterwards, a waistcoat and
open--hueed breeches of the same: Icon-
trived a sort of umbrella, covering it with
skins, which not only kept out the heat of
the sun, but rain also. Thus being easy
and settled in my mind, my chief happiness
was to converse with God, in prayer.

For five years after this nothing ex-
traordinary occurred to me. My chief
employment was to cure my raisins, and
plant my barley and rice, of both which I
had ayear's provision beforehand. Though
I was disappointed in my first canoe, I
made, at intermediate times, a second, of
much inferior size; and it was two years
beforeI had finished it. But aslperceived
it would no wise answer my design of sail-
ing to the other shore, my thoughts were
confined to take a tour round the island,
to see what further discoveries I could
make. To this intent, after having moved
her to the water, and tried how she would
sail, I fitted up a little mast to my boat,
and made a sail of the ship's sail that lay
by me. Ithen made lockers or boxes at
the end of it, to put in necessaries, pro-
vision, and ammunition, which would pre-
serve them dry, either from rain or the
spray of the sea; and in the inside of the
boat, I cut a long hollow place to lay my
gun in; and to keep it dry, made a flag
to hang over it. My umbrella I fixed in a
step in the stern, like a mast, to keep the
heat of the sun off me. And now resolving
to see the circumference of my little king--
dom, I victualled my ship for the voyage,
putting in two. dozen of my barley-bread
loaves, an earthen pot full of parched rice,
a little bottle of rum, half a goat, powder
and shot, and two watch coats. It was
the 6th of November, in the 6th year of
my captivity, thatI setout in this voyage;
which was much longer than I expected,
being obliged to put farther out, on ac--
count of the rocks. And indeed so much
did these rocks surprise me, thatI was for
putting back, fearing that if I vehtured
farther it would be out of my power to re-
turn. In this uncertaintyl came to anchor
just on shore, to which I waded with my
gun on my shoulder and then climbing a
hill, which overlooked that point, I saw the
full extent of it, and resolved to run all
hazards.--That night it grew so calm that
I ventured out; and here I may be a monu'
ment to all rash and ignorant pilots; for
Iwas no sooner come to the point, and
not above the boat's length from shore,
but I was got into deep water, with a cur-
rent like a mill, which drove my boat along
so violently, that it was impossible for me
to keep near the edge of it, but forced me
more and more out from the eddy to the
left of me; and all Icould do with my
paddles was useless, there being no wind
to help me.

Who can conceive the present anguish
of my mind at this calamity"! With long-
ing eyes did I look upon my little kingdom,
and thought the island the pleasantest
place in the universe. Happy, thrice
happy desert, said I, shall I never see thee
more"! Wretched creature! whither am I
going? Why did I murmur at my lone.
I

some condition, when now I would give
the whole world to be thither again?
While I was thus complaining, I found
myself driven about two leagues into the
sea; however, I laboured till my strength
was for spent, to keep my boat as far north
as possible. About noon I perceived a
little breeze of wind spring up from the
S. S. E. which overjoyed my heart; and
was still more elated, when in about half
an hour, it blew a gentle fine gale. I set
up my mast again, spread my sail, and
stood away northward as much as I could,
to get rid of the current. And no sooner
did the boat begin to stretch away, but I
perceived, by the clearness of the water,
a change of the current was near. About
four o'clock in the afternoon, I reached
within a league of the island, and in an
hour came within a mile of the shore,
where I soon landed to my unspeakable
comfort; and after an humble prostration,

thanking God for my deliverance, with
H
resolution to lay all thoughts of escaping
aside, I brought my boat safe' to a little
cove, and laid down to take a welcome
repose. When I awoke, I considered how
I migrht get my boat home; and coasting
along the shore, I came to a good bay
which ran up to a rivulet or brook, where
findinga good harbour, I stowed her as
safe as if she had been in a dry dock made
on purpose for her.

I now perceived myself not far from the
place where before I had travelled on foot;
so taking nothing with me, except my gun,
and umbrella, I began my journey; and
in the evening came to my bower, where
I again laid me down to rest. I had not
slept long before I was awakened in great
surprise, by a strange voice that called me
several times, " Robin, Robin, Robinson
" Crusoe, poor Robin! Where are you,
" Robinson Crusoe? Where are you?
"' .Where have you been '1"

So fast was I asleep at first, that I did
not awake thoroughly: but half asleep and
half awake, I thoughtl dreamed that some-
body spoke to me. But as the voice re-
peated Robinson Crusoe several times, be-
ing terribly afi'righted, I started up; and
no sooner were my eyes fully open, but I
beheld my pretty Poll sitting on the top of
the hedge, and soon knew that it was he
that called me; for just in such bewailing
language I used to talk and teach him;
which he so exactly learned, that he would
' sit upon my finger, and lay his bill close
to my face, and cry, " Poor Robinson
." Crusoe, where are you? where have you
" been? how came you here Q" and such
like prattle, I had constantly taught him.
But even though I knew it to be the parrot,
it was a great while before I could adjust
myself; being amazed how the creature
got thither. But now being assured it
could be no Other than my honest Poll,
my wonder ceased, and reaching out my

hand, and calling familiarly Poll, the crea~
H 2
ture came to me, and perched upon my
thumb as he was wont, constantly prating
to me with " Poor Robinson Crusoe, and
" how did I come here, and where had I
" been 2" as if the bird was overjoyed to
see me; so I took him home with me.

I was now pretty well cured of my
rambling to sea, and beoan to lead a very
retired life, living near a twelvemonth in
a very contented manner wanting for no-
thing except conversation. As to mechanic
labours, which my necessities obliged me
to, I fancied I could, upon occasion, make
a tolerable carpenter, were the poor tools
I had to work with, but good. Besides,
as I improved in my earthenware, I con-
trived to make them with a wheel, which
I found much easier and better, making
my work shapely, which before was rude
and ugly. But I think, I was never so
elated with my own performance, as for
being able to make a tobacco-pipe, which,
though it was an awkward clumsy thing,
yet it was very sound, and carried the
smoke perfectly well.--I also improved my
wicker ware, making abundance of baskets,
which were very handy and convenient
My powder beginning to fail, I contrived
many ways to ensnare the goats, and see
if I could catch them alive, particularly a
she-goat with young. At last I had my de-
sire; for, making pitfalls and traps baited
with barley and rice, I found one morning,
in one of them, an old he~goat, and in the
other, three kids, one male, the other two,
females--It was some time before they
would feed; but throwing them sweet corn,
it so much tempted them that they began
to be tamer. I concluded, that if I de-
signed to furnish myself with goat's flesh,
when my ammunition was spent, the tamely
breeding them up, like a flock of sheep, '
about my settlement, was the only method
I could take. I resolved to separate the
wild from the tame; and the best way for

this, was to have some inclosed piece of
HS
90 LIFE AND ADVENTURES

ground well fenced, that those within might
not break out, or those without break in.
Such an undertaking was very great for
one pair of hands; but as there was an ab-
solute necessity for it, my first care was to
find a convenient piece of ground where
there was likely to be herbage for them to
eat, water to drink, and shelter to keep
them from the sum--I resolved to inclose

a piece of ground about one hundred and
fifty yards in length, and one hundred in
breadth, sufficient for as many as would

maintain me till my flock increased, and
then I could add more ground. I now
vigorously prosecuted my work, and it
took me about three months to hedge in
the first piece. I tethered the three kids
in the best part of it, feeding them as near
me as possible, to make them'fanliliar; and
indeedl very often carried some ears of
barley, or a handful of rice, and fed them
out of my hand; by which they grew so
' tame, that when my enclosure was finished,
and I let them loose, they would run after
me for ahandful of corn; In a year and
a half '3 time, I had a flock of about twelve
goats, kids and all; and in two years after,
they amounted to forty-three, besides what
I had taken and killed for my sustenance.
After which I enclosed five pieces of ground
to feed them in, with pens to drive them
into, that I might take them as I had
occasion.
In this project I likewiSe found addi-
tional blessings; for I not only had plenty
..of goat's flesh, but milk too', which at first
I did not think of. And indeed, though I
had never milked, or seen butter or cheese
made, yet after some essays and miscar-
riages, I made both, and never afterwards
wanted.
How mercifully can the I omnipotent
.Power comfort his creatures, even in the
midst of their greatest calamities? He
can sweeten the bitterest providences, and
give us reason to magnify him in dungeons
and prisons! what a bounteous table was
here spread in a wilderness for me, where
I expected nothing at first but to perish
with hunger !------When I dined, I seemed a
king, eating alone, none daring to pre-
sume to do so till I had done. Poll, as if
he had been my'principal court favourite,
was the only person permitted to talk with
me. My old, but faithful dog, continually
sat on my right hand; while my two cats
sat on each side of the table expectinga
bit from my hand, as a mark of my royal
favour. In this manner did I live, wanting
for nothing but conversation. One thing
indeed concerned me, the want of my boat;
lime-w not which way to get her round
the island. One time I resolved to go
along the shore by land to her; but had
an3 one in England met with such a figure,
it would either have afi'righted them, or
made them burst into laughter.

The cap I wore on my head, was great,
high, and shapeless, made of a goat's skin,
with a flap or pent-house hanging down
behind, not only to keep the sun from me,
but to shoot the rain 01?, nothing being
more pernicious than the rain falling upon
the flesh in these climates. I had a short
jacket of goat's skin, whose hair hung
down such'a length on each side, that it
reached to the calves of my legs. As for
my shoes and stockings, they were made
like buskins, and laced on the sides like
spatterdashes, barbarously shaped like the
rest of my habit. I had a broad belt of
goat's skin dried, girt round me with a
couple of thongs, instead of buckles; on
each of which, to supply the deficiency of
sword and dagger, hung my hatchet and
saw. Another belt, not so broad, yet
fastened in the same manner, hung over
my shoulder, and at the end of it, under ,
my left arm, two pouches, made of goat's .
skin, to hold my powder and shot. ' My
basket I carried on my back, and my gun
on my shoulder ; and over my head a great
clumsy ugly goat's skin umbrella, which
however, next to my gun, was the most
necessary thing about me. As for my face,
the' colour was not so swarthy as the
Mulattoes, as might have been expected
from one who took so little care of it, in
a climate within nine or ten degrees of the
equator. At one time my' beard grew so
long that it bung down about a quarter of
a yard; but as I had both razors and scis-
sors in store, I cut ,it all off, and suffered
none to grow, except a large pair of Ma-
hometan whiskers, like what I had seen
worn by some Turks at Salee, not long
enough indeed to hang a hat upon, but of
such a monstrous size, as would have
amazed any Englishman.

I had now two plantations in the island;
the first my little fortification, with many
large and spacious improvements. The
~piles' with which I made my wall were
grown so lofty and great, as secured my
habitation. And near this commodious
and pleasant settlement, lay my well-cultL
vated and improved corn fields, which
yielded me their fruit in proper season.
My second plantation was that near my
country seat, or little bower, where niy
grapes flourished, and where, having plant~
ed many stakes, I made enclosures for my
goats, so strongly fortified by labour and
time, that it was much stronger than a
wall, and consequently impossible for them
to break through. As for my boweritself,
I kept it constantly in repair, and cut the
trees in such a manner, as made them grow
thick and wild, and form a most delightful
shade. In the centre of this, stood my
tent: I had driven four piles in the ground,
spreading over it a piece 'of the ship's sail;
beneath which I made a sort of a couch
with the skins of the creatures I had slain,. _.
and other things; and having laid thereon
one of the sailor's blankets, which I had
' saved from the wreck of the ship, and
covering myself with a great watch coat, I
took up this place for my country retreat.
-----Very frequently from this settlement did
I visit my boat, and keep her in good order.

You may easily suppose, that after ha--
fing been here so long, nothing could be
more amazing than to see a human crea-
ture. One day it happened, that going to
my boat, I saw the print of a man's naked
foot on the shore, very evident on the
sand, as the toes, heels, and every part of
it.--Had I seen an apparition of the most
4 frightful shape, I could not have been more
confounded. My willing ears gave the
strictest attention. I cast my eyes around,
but could satisfy neither the one nor the
other. I proceeded alternately to every
part of the shore, but with equal effect;
neither could I see any other mark, though
the sand about it was as susceptible to
take impression, as that which was so
plainly stamped. Thus, struck with con-
fusion and horror, I returned to my habi-
tation, frightened at every bush and tree,
taking every thing for men; and possessed
with the wildest ideas: that night my eyes
never closed. I formed nothing but the
most dismal imaginations, all my religious
hopes vanished, as though I thought God
would not now protect me by his power,
a ho had wonderfully preserved me so long.

What various changes of Providence are
there in the life of man? How changeable
are our affections, according to different
circumstances? We love today, what we
hate to-morrow; we shun one hour what
we seek the next. This was evident in
me in the most conspicuous manner: for
I, who before had so much lamented my
condition, in being banished from all hu--
man kind, was now even ready to expire,
when I considered that a man had set his
foot on this desolate island. But when I
considered my station of life, decreed by
the infinitely wise and good providence of

God, I found it my duty __to trust sincerely
I
in him, pray ardently to him, and humbly
resign myself to his divine will.

One morning lying on my bed, these
words of the sacred writings came into my
mind, " Call upon me in the day of trou-
" ble, and I will deliver thee, and thou
" shalt glorify me." Upon this sentence,
rising more cheerfully from my bed, I of-
fered up my prayers in the most heavenly
manner: and when I had done, taking up
my bible to read, these words appeared
first in my sight:--" Wait on the Lord,
"and be of good cheer, and he shall
" strengthen thy heart: Wait I say on the
9' Lord." Such divine comfort did this
give me, as to remove all cause of sadness
upon that occasion.

I ventured out of my castle and milked
my goats, one of which was almost spoiled
for want of it. I next (though in great
fear) visited my bower, and milked my
flocks there also; when growing bolder, 1.
went down to the shore again, and mea<<
snring the print of the foot to mine, to
see perhaps, whether I myself had not oc--
casioned that mark, I found it much sn--
perior in largeness: and so returned home,
now absolutely convinced, that either some
men had been ashore, or that the island
must be inhabited, and therefore that I
might be surprised before I was aware.

I began to think of providing for my se~
cnrity, and resolved in my mind many
different schemes for that purpose. I first
proposed to cut down my inclosures, and
turn my tame cattle wild into the woods,
that the enemy might not find them, and
frequent the island in hopes of killing the
same. Secondly, I was for digging up my
corn fields for the very same reason. And
lastly, I concluded to demolish my bower,
lest, seeing a place of human contrivance,
they might come farther, and find out, and
attack me in my little castle.

Sue!) notions did the fear of danger sug-
I 2
gest to me: and I looked, I thought, like
the unfortunate king Saul, when not only
oppressed by the Philistines, but also for--
saken by God. And, it is strange, that a
little before, having entirely resigned my--
self to the will of God, I should now have
little confidence in him, fearing those more
who could kill this fading body, than him
who could destroy my immortal soul.
Wandering one day more to the west of
the island than ever I had yet done, and
casting my eyes towards the sea, methought
I perceived a boat at a great distance, but
could not possibly tell what it was for want
of my perspective glass. I considered then
it was no strange thing to see the print of
a man's foot; and concluding them canni--
bals, blessed God for being cast on the
other side of the island, where none of the
savages, as I thought, ever came. But
when Icame down the hill to the shore,
which was the S. W. point of the island, I
was confirmed in my opinion; nor can
any one describe my horror and amaze-
ment, when I saw the ground spread witn
skulls, hands, feet, and bones of human
bodies; and, particularly I perceived a
space like a circle, in the midst of which
had been a fire, about which I conjectured
these wretches sat, and unnaturally sacri-
ficed and devoured their fellow creatures.

The horror and loathsomeness of this
dreadful spectacle, confounded my senses.
I returned towards my habitation; and,
in my way thither, shedding floods of tears,
and falling down on my knees, gave God
thanks for making my nature contrary to
these wretches, and delivering me so long
out of their hands.

Though reason and my "long residence
here had assured me, that these savages
never came up to the thick woody part of
the country, and that I had no reason to
be apprehensive of a discovery; yet such
an abborrence did I still retain, that, for

two years after, I confined myself only t0.
1 8
my plantations. In process of time my
dreadful apprehensions began to wear
away, yet I was more vigilant for fear of
being surprised, and very cautious of firing
my gun, lest being heard by those crea'
tures, they should proceed to attack me.
I resolved, however, manfully to lose my
life if they did, and went armed with three
pistols, stuck to my girdle, which gave me
a very formidable appearance.

My circumstances for some time re-
mained very calm and undisturbed; and
when I compared my condition with others,
I found it far from being miserable. Would
all persons compare their circumstances,
not with those above them, but with
these innumerable unhappy objects be-
neath them, I am sure we should not hear
those daily murmurings and complainings
that are in the world. The terror which
the savages had put me in, spoiled some
inventions for my own convenience. For
now my inventions were hot! I might rle~
stroy some of these cannibals, when pro-
ceeding to their bloody entertainments:
and so .saving a victim from being sacri-
ficed, that he might after become my ser-
vant. To put my design in execution, I
was not long in seeking fora place con~
venient for my purpose, where unseen I
might behold every action of the savages.
Here I placed my two muskets, each of
which was loaded with a brace of slugs,
and four or five smaller bullets about the
size of pistol bullets; the fowling--piece
was charged with near a handful of the
largest swan shot, and in every pistol was
about four bullets, But having waited in
vain two or three months, it not only grew
very tiresome to me, but brought me to
some consideration, and made me examine
what right had I to kill these creatures in
this manner. Indeed religion took their
part so much as to convince me how con-
trary it was to my duty to be guilty of
shedding human blood, innocent as to me,
whatever they are to one another; that I
had nothing to do with it, but leave it to
the God of all power and dominion, to do
therein what seemed convenient to his
heavenly wisdom. And on my knees I
thanked the Almighty for delivering me
from blood-guiltiness, and begged his pro~
tection, that I might never fall into their
hands.----Thus giving over an attempt which
I had rashly begun, I never ascended the
hill on that occasion afterwards: I only re-
moved my boat, which lay on the other
side of the island, and every thing that
belonged to her, toward the east, into a
little cove, that there might not be the
least shadow of any boat near,'or habi-
tation upon the island.--My castle then
became my cell, keeping always retired in
it, except when I went out to milk my
goats. and order my little flock in the
wood, which was quite out of danger.
Anxiety of mind for my preservation put
a period to all future inventions and con-
trivauces, either for accommodation or
convenience. I now cared not to drive a
nail, chop a stick, fire a gun, or make
a fire, lest either the noise should be heard, '
or the smoke discover me. And on this
account I used to burn my earthenware
privately in a cave which Ifound in the
wood, and which I made convenient for
that purpose; the principal cause that
brought me here was to make charcoal, so
that I might bake and dress my bread and
meat without any danger. At that time,
a curious accident happened me.-----While
I was cutting down some wood for making
my charcoal, I perceived a cavity behind
a very thick branch of underwood. Curious
to look into it, I attained its mouth, and
perceived it sufiicient for me to stand up-
right in. But when I had entered, and
took a further view, two rolling shining
eyes, like flaming stars, seemed to dart
themselves at me; so that I made all the
haste out that I could. When I recovered
a little from my surprise, resuming my
courage, I took a flaming firebrand, and
in I rushed again. I had not proceeded
above three steps, when I was more af-
frighted than before; for I heard a bid
sigh, like that ofa human creature in the
greatest agony, succeeded by a broken
noise resembling words half expressed, and
then a sigh again. Encouraging myself
with the hopes of God's protection,
I went forward, and by the light of my
firebran'd, perceived it to be a monstrous
he~goat, lying on the ground, gasping for
life, and dying of mere old age. At first
I stirred him, thinking to drive him out,
and the poor creature strove to get upon
his feet, but was not able; so I e'en let
him lie still to afi'right the savages, should
they venture into this cave. Inow looked
round and found the place small and shape-
less. At the farther side of it, I perceived
a sort of entrance, yet so low, it must
oblige me to creep upon my hands and
knees to it; so, having no candle, I sus-
pended my enterprise till the 'next day,
and then I came provided with two large
ones of my own making.

Having crept through this strait, I found
the roof, I think, about twenty feet high.
But surely mortal never saw such a glorious
sight before! The roof and walls of this
cave reflected a hundred thousand lights,
from my two candles, as though they were
indented with shining gold, precious stones,
or sparkling diamonds. The floor was dry
and level, and had a kind of gravel upon
it; no nauseous venomous creatures to be
seen there, neither any damp or wet about
it. licould find no fault but in the en-
trance, and [began to think that even this
might be very necessary for my defence,
and therefore resolved to make it my prin-
cipal magazine, I brought hither two
fowling pieces and three muskets, leaving
only five pieces at my castle, planted in
the nature of canon. Of the barrel ofguu-
powder which I took up out of the sea, I
brought away about sixty pounds, which
was not damaged; and this, with a great
quantity of lead for bullets, I removed
from my castle to this retreat, now fortified
both by art and nature.

I fancied myself now like one of the
giants of old, who were said to live in
caves and holes among the rocks, inacces-
sible to any but themselves; or at least, a
most dangerous attempt, And now I de-
spised both the cunning and strength of
the savages, either to find me out_or to
hurt me.

But I must not forget the old goat, which
caused my late dreadful amazement. The
poor creature gave up the ghost the day
after my discovery; and it being diflicult
to drag him out, I dug his grave, and how
nourably entombed him in the same place
where he departed, with as much ceremony
as any Welch goat that has been interred
about the high mountains of Penmanmawr.
Ithink Inow was in the twenty--third
year of my reign, and my thoughts much
easier than formerly, having contrived se-
veral pretty amusements and diversions
agreeably to pass away the time. By this
time my pretty Poll had learned to speak
English, and pronounce his words very
nrticulately and plain; so that for many
hours we used to chat together in a familiar
manner, and he lived with me no less than
twenty--six years. My dog, which was
nineteen years old, sixteen of which he
' lived with me, died some time ago of mere
old.age. As for-my cats they multiplied
so fast, that I was forced to kill or drive
them into the woods, except two or three
which became my particular, favourites.
Besides these, I continually kept two or
three household kids about me, which]?
learned- to feed out of my hand, and two
more parrots which could talk indifferently,
and 'call Robinson Crusoe. *I had also se-

veral sea fowls, which I had wounded and
.K
cut their wings; and growing tame, they
used to breed among the low trees about
my castle walls,- all which made my abode
very agreeable.

But what unforeseen events suddenly
destroy the enjoyment of this uncertain
life! It was now the month of December,
in the southern solstice, and time of my
harvest, which required my attendance in
the fields; when going out pretty early
one morning, before it was light, there
appeared from the sea shore a flaming
light, about two miles from me at the east
end of the island, where] had observed
Some savages had been before, not on the
other side, but to my great affliction, it
was on my side the island.

Struck with a terrible surprise, and my
usual apprehensions, that the savages would
perceive my improvements, I returned di-
rectly to my castle, pulled the ladder after
me, making all things look as wild and aa-
tural as I possibly could. I!) the next
place I put myself in a posture of defence,
loaded my muskets and pistols, and com-
mitting myself to God's protection, re-
solved to defend myself till my last breath.
Two hours after, impatient for intelligence,
I ascended to-the top of a hill, where, by
ing myself down, with my perspective glass,
I perceived no less than nine naked savages,
sitting round a small fire, eating, as I sup-
posed, human flesh, with their two canoes
hauled on shore, waiting for the flood to
carry them off again. I cannot easily ex-
press the consternation I was in at this
sight; but when [ perceived their coming
must be alwayswith the current of the ebb,
I became more easy, being. fully convinced
that I might go abroad with security all
the time of flood, if they-were not before
landed. Before they went off, they danced,
making ridiculous postures and gestures,
for above an hour, all stark-naked. When
I saw them gone, I took two guns upon

my shoulders, and placing a couple of
K2
pistols in my belt, with my great sword
hanging by my side, I went to .the hill,
where at first I made the discovery of these
cannibals, and then saw there had been
three canoes more of the savages on shore
at that place, which with the rest: were
making over to the main land.

But nothing could be more horrid to
me, when going to the place of sacrifice,
the blood, the bones, and other mangled
parts of human bodies appeared in my
sight; and so fired was I with indignation,
thatl was fully resolved to be r'eveuged
on the first that came there, though I lost
my life in the execution. It then appeared
to me, that the visits which they make to
this island are not very frequent, it being
fifteen months before they came again:
but still I was very uneasy lest they should
surprise me unawares.

On the 16th of May (according to my
wooden calendar) the wind blew exceed.-
ingly hard, accompanied with abundance
of lightning and thunder all day, and suc-
ceeded by a very stormy night. The
seeming anger of the Heavens made me
have recourse to my bible. Whilst I was
seriously pondering upon it, I was sud-
denly alarmed with the noise of a-gun,
which I conjectured was fired upon the
ocean. Such an unusual surprise made
me start up in a minute, when, with my
ladder, ascending the mountain as before,
that very moment a flash of fire presaged
the report of another gun, which I pre>>
sently heard, and found it was from that
part of the sea where the current drove
me away. I could not but think, that
this must be a ship in distress, and that
these were the melancholy signals for a
speedy deliverance. Great, indeed, was
my sorrow upon this occasion; but my
labours to assist them must have proved
altogether fruitless. However, I brought
together all the dry wood that was at hand,

and making a pretty large pile, set it on
K3
fire on the hill. I was certain they plainly
perceived it, by their firing another gun
as soon as it began to blaze, and after that
several more from the same quarter. All
night long I kept up my fire: and when
the air cleared up, I perceived something
a great way at sea directly E. but could
not distinguish what it was, even with my
glass, as the weather was very foggy out
at sea. However, keeping my eyes di-
rectly fixed upon it, and perceiving it did
not stir, I presently concluded it must be
a ship at anchor, and taking the gun, I
went to the S. E. part of the island, to the
same rocks where I had been formerly
driven by the current: in which time the
weather being perfectly cleared up, to my
great sorrow, I perceived the wreck of a
ship cast away upon those hidden rocks.

I had the affliction some time after, to
see the corpse of a drowned boy come on
shore, at the end of the island which was
next the wreck; there was nothing on him
but a seaman's waistcoat, a pair of open-
kneed linen drawers, and a blue linen shirt,
but no particular mark to guess what na-
tion he was of. In his pocket were two
pieces of eight, and a tobacco pipe. And
now the calmness of the sea tempted me
to venture out in my boat to this wreck,
not only to get something necessary out of
the ship, but perhaps some living creature
might be on board, whose life I might
preserve. This had such an influence
upon my mind, that immediately I went
home, and prepared eVery thing necessary
for the v0yage, carrying on board my boat
provisions of all sorts, with a good quan-
tity of rum, fresh water, and a compass:
so putting off, I paddled the canoe along
the shore, till I came at last to the north-
east part of the island, from whence I was
to launch into the ocean; but here the
currents ran so violently, and appeared so
terrible, that my heart began to fail me;
threseeing that if I was driven into any of
these currents, I might be carried not only
out of reach of the island, but even inevit-
ably lost in the boiling surges of the ocean.
So oppressed was I at these troubles,
that I gave over my enterprise, sailing to
a little creek on the shore, where stepping
out, I set down on a rising hill, very pen-
sive and thoughtful. I then perceived that
the tide was turned, and the flood came on,
which made it impracticable for me to go
out for many hours.
That night I reposed myself in my canoe,
covered with my watch-coat, instead of a
blanket, the heavens being my tester. I
set out with the first of the tide full north,
till I felt the benefit of the current, which
carried meat a great rate eastward, yet
not with such impetuosity as before, as to
take from me all government of my canoe;
so that in two hours time I came up to the
.wreck. It seemed to be a Spanish vessel,
stuck fast between two rocks; her stern
and quarter beaten to pieces by the sea;
her mainmast and foremast were broken
of short. As I approached near, I per-
ceived a dog on board, who, seeing me
coming, yelped and cried, and no sooner
did I call him, but the poor creature
jumped into the sea, out of whichI took
him up, almost famished with hunger and
thirst; so that when I gave him a cake of
bread, no ravenous wolf could devour it
more greedily; and he drank to that dc.
gree of fresh water, that he would have
burst himself, had I sufl'ered him.

The first sight I met with in the ship,
were two men drowned in the cook-room
or forecastle, inclosed in one another's
arms: hence I'very probably supposed,
that when the vessel struck in the storm,
so highand incessantly did the- waters
break in and over her, that the men not
being able to hear it, were strangled by the
constant rushing in of the waves. There
were severalicasks of liquor, whether wine
or brandy I could not be positive, which
lay in the lower hold, as were plainly per-
ceptible by the ebbing out of the water,
yet were too large for me to pretend to
meddle with; likewise I perceived several
chests, which I supposed to belong to the
seamen, two of which I got into my boat,
without examining what was in them.

Searching further, I found a cask, con-
taining about twenty gallons of liquor,
which, with some labour, I got into my
boat; in her cabin were several muskets,
which I let remain there, but took away
with me a great powder-horn, with about
four pounds of powder. I took also a fire
shovel and tongs, two brass kettles, a cop-
per pot to make chocolate, and a gridiron,
all which were extremely useful to me, es-
pecially the fire shovel and tongs. And
so with this cargo, accompanied by my
dog, I came away, the tide serving for that
purpose: and the same evening I attained
the island, after the greatest toil and
fatigue imaginable.
That night I 'reposed my wearied limbs
in the boat, resolving the next morning to
harbour what I had gotten, in my new-
found subterraneous grotto; and not to
carry my cargo home to my ancient castle.
Having refreshed myself, and got all my
efi'ects on shore, I next proceeded to ex-
amine them; and tapping the cask, I found
the liquor to be mm. In the chest I
found a very fine case of bottles, contain-
ing the'finest and best sorts of cordial
waters; each bottle held about three pints,
curiously tipt with silver. Also, two pots
full of the choicest sweetmeats, and two
more which the water had utterly spoiled.
There were likewise several good shirts,
exceedingly welcome to me; and about
one dozen and a half of white linen hand-
kerchiefs and coloured neckcloths, the
former of which was absolutely necessary
for wiping my face in a hot day; and in
the till I found three bags of pieces of eight,
about eleven-hundred in all, in one of
which, decently wrapped up in a piece of
paper, were six doubloons of gold, and;
some small bars and wedges of the same
metal, which I believe might weigh near a
pound. In the other chest, which I guess-
ed to belong to the gunner's mate, I found
only some clothes of very little value, ex-
cept about two pounds of fine glazed pow-
der, in three flasks, kept, as I believe, for
charging the fowling pieces: so that, in
the whole, I had no great advantage by
this voyage. The money was, indeed, as
mere dirt to me, useless and unprofitable,
all which I would have freely parted with
for two or three pair of English shoes and
stockings; things that for many years I
had not worn, except those which I had
taken off the feet of the unfortunate men I
found. drowned in the wreck. When I are
rived at my castle everything seemed safe
and quiet. _ .

Having retired to my castle, after my
late voyage to the ship, my frigatelaid up.
and secured, as usual, and my condition
the same as before, except being richer,'
thoughl had as little occasion for riches
as the Indians of Peru had for gold before
the cruel Spaniards came among them;
one night in March, being the rainy season,
in the four and twentieth year of my soli-
tude, I lay dowu to sleep, very well in
health, withOut distemper, pain, or un<
common uneasiness either of body or mind;
yet, notwithstanding, I could not com--
pose myself to sleep. All this tedious
time, it is impossible to express what inv
numeralsle thoughts came into my head.
I traced the whole history of my life in
miniature, from my earliest remembranee
of things till [came to this island, and then
proceeded to examine every thing that had
occurred since I had taken 'possession of
my kingdom. ' In my reflections upon the
latter, I was comparing the happy posture
of my affairs in the beginning of my reign,
to this life of anxiety, fear, and concern,
' L
since I had discovered a print of a foot in
the sand. While my thoughts were agi-
tated, my resignation to the will of Hea-
ven was entirely suspended, so that I had
no power to fix my mind to any thing, but
to the project of a voyage to the main
land: till nature being, as it were, fatigued
and exhausted with the thoughts of it,
made me submit myself to a silent repose.

In such a situation, it is very strange,
that! did not dream of what I was so in~
tent upon; but, instead of it, my mind
roved on a thing altogether foreign. I
dreamed, that as I was issuing from my
castle one morning, as customary, I per-
ceived upon the shore two canoes, and
eleven savages coming to land, who had
brought with them another Indian, whom
they designed to make a sacrifice of, in
order to devour; but just as they were
going to give the fatal blow, methought
the poor victim jumped away, and ran di'
rectly into my little thick grove, to air
scond from his enemies, when, perceiving
that the others did not follow him, 1 ap
peared to him; that he humbly kneeled
down before me and seemed to pray for
my assistance; upon which I showed him
my ladder, made him ascend, carried him
to my cave, and he became my servant.
This dream brought me to reflect, that
one sure way of escaping was to get a sa-
vage; that after I had ventured my life to
deliver him from the bloody jaws of his
devourers, the natural sense he might have
of such a preservation, might inspire him
with a lasting gratitude and most sincere
afi'ection.--~I at length resolved, right or
wrong, to get one of these savages into my
hands, even though I should lose my life
in the attempt. Inspired with this 113506
lution, I set my wits at work, to find out
what methods I should take to accomplish
my design: this indeed, was so diflicult a
task, that I could not pitch upon any pro-

bable means to execute it: I therefore re-
L 2
Solved continually to be in a vigilant pos-
ture, to perceive when the savages came
on shore, and to leave the rest to the event.

Such was my fixed resolutions; and ac-
cordingly I set myself upon-the watch. I
waited for. above a year and a half. This
was a very great discouragement; yet the
edge ofmy design wasas keen as ever, and
the longer-it seemed to be delayed, the
more eager was I for it.

I .was one day seriously musing howl
should attain my end, when I was very
much surprised by seeing no less than five
canoes all on shore together, on my side
the island, and the savages that belonged
to them all landed, and out of my sight.
Sucha number of them disconcerted my
measures; for, seeing so many boats, each
of which would contain six, and sometimes
more, I could not tell how to order my
measures; and much dispirited and per-
plexed, I lay still in~ my castle; which,
however, I put in a proper posture for an
attack; and having formerly provided all
that was necessary, was soon ready to'
enter upon an engagement. Having waited
for some time, my impatient temper would
let me. bear it no longer; I set my guns at
the foot of the ladder, and, as usual, as-
cended to the top of the hill; and here,
by the assistance of my perspective glass,
Iohserved no less than thirty in number
around a fire, fea'stiug upon what meat
they had dressed; how they cooked it, or
what it was, I could not then perfectly
tell; but they were all dancing and caper-
ing about the flames, using many frightful
and barbarous gestures.

But while, with a curious eye, I was be-
holding these wretches, my spirits sunk
within me, - when I perceived them drag
two miserable creatures from the boats, to
act afresh the dreadful tragedy, as I sup-
posed they had done before. It was not
long before one of. them fell upon the

ground, knocked down, as I suppose, with
L 3
'1 club or wooden sword; while two or
three others went immediately to work,
Cutting him open for their cookery, while
the last unhappy captive was left by him-
self, till they were ready for him.. The
poor creature looked round him with a
wishful eye, trembling at the thoughts of
death; yet, seeing himself a little at li-
berty, nature, that very moment, as it
Were, inspired him with hopes of llfC: he
started away from them, and ran, with in--
credible swiftness, along: the sands, direct-
ly to that part of the coast where my an-
cient and venerable castle stood.

You may well imagine I was dreadfully
afi'righted upon this occasion. However,
my spirits beginning: to recover, I still
kept upon my guard; and] now plainly
perceived there were but three men out of
the number that pursued him. [was in-
finitely pleased to see with what swiftness
the poor creature ran from his pursners,
gaining so much ground upon them, that
I plainly perceived could he thus hold out
for half an how, there was not the least
doubt but he would save his life from the
power of his enemies.

Between them and my castle there was
a creek, where I much feared the poor
victim would be taken, if he could not
swim for his escape: But soon was I out
of pain for him, when I perceived he made
nothing of it, though at full tide, but with
an intrepid courage, spurred on by the
sense of danger, he plunged into the flood,
swimming over in abOut thirty strokes,
and then landing, ran with the same im
credible strength and swiftness as before.
When the three pursuers came to the creek,
one of them, who I perceived could not
swim, returned to his company, while-the
others, with equal courage, but much less
swiftness, attained the other side, as though
they were resolved never to give over the
pursuit. And now or never [thought was
the time for me to procure me a servant,
companion, or assistant. I immediately
descended my two ladders with the greatest
expedition; I took up my guns, which, as
I said before, were at the bottom nfthem,
and taking a short cut down the hill, I in-
terposed between the pursuers and pur-
sued; hallooing aloud to the latter, who,
venturing to look back, was, no doubt, as
nun-h ten ified at me as I at them. I beckon~
ed to him with my hand, to return back;
in the mean time advancing towards the
pursuers, and rushing on the foremost, I
knocked him down with the stock of my
piece, and laid him flat on the ground.
I w as very unwilling.r to tire, lest the rest
should hear. The other savage seeing his
fellow fail, stopped as if he had been
amazed; when advancing towards him, I
could perceive him take his bow from his
baek, and, fixing an arrow to it, was pre--
paring to shoot at me. In this case of
seltLpreservation, I immediately fired at
him, and shot him dead, just as his hand
'was going to draw the fatal string. All
this while, the savage who had fled before,
stood still, and had the satisfaction to see
his enemies killed: so afl'righted was he
with the fire and noise of my piece, that
he stood fixed and immoveahle, without
either sense or motion. This obliged me
to halloo to him again, making the plainest
signs] could to him to draw nearer. I
perceived he understood those tokens by
his approaching to me a little way, when,
as if afraid I should kill him too, he stop-
ped again. Several times did he advance,
and as often stop in this manner, till com~
iug more to my View, I perceived him
trembling as if he was to undergo the same
fate. Upon which I looked upon him with
a smiling countenance, and still beckoning
to him, at length he came close to me, and
kneeled down, kissing the ground, laid his
head upon it, and taking me by the foot,
set 'it Upon his head; and this, as I under--
stood afterwards, was a token of swearing
to be my slave for ever. I took him up,
and, making much of him, encouraged him
in the best manner I could. But my work
was not yet finished; for l perceived the
savage whom I had knocked down, was
not killed, but stunned with the blow, and
began to come to himself. Upon which I
pointed to my new servant, and showed
him that his enemy was not yet expired;
he spoke some words to me, but which I
could not understand; yet being the first
sound of a man's voice I had heard for
above twenty-five years, they were very
pleasing to me. But there was no time for
reflection now, the wounded savage re-
covering himself so far as to sit upon the
ground, which made my poor prisoner as
much afraid as before; to put him out of
fear, I presented my other gun at the man,
with an intent to shoot him; but my sa-
vage, for so I must now call him, pre.
vented my firing, by making a motion to
me to lend him a sword which hung naked
in my belt by my side. No sooner did I
grant his request, but away he runs to his
enemy, and at one blow cut off his head
as dexterously as the most accomplished
executioner in Germany could have done;
for it seems these creatures make use of
wooden swords made of hard wood, which
will bear edge enough to cut ofl' heads and
arms at one blow. When this valorous ex-
ploit was done, he cornes to me laughing,
as a token of triumph, delivered me my
sword again, with abundance of surprising
gestures, laying it along with the bleeding
and ghastly head of the Indian, at my feet.

The greatest astonishment that my new
servant conceived, was the manner of kil-
ling the savage at such a distance, without
a bow and arrow. First he turned him on
one side, then on another, wondering he
could perceive no quantity of- blood; and
after sufficiently admiring the wound the
bullets had made in his breast, he took up
his bow and arrows, and came back again:
upon which I turned to go away, making
signs to him to follow, lest the rest missing
their companions, might come in pursuit
of them, and this I found he understood.
very well; by his making me understand
that his design was to bury them, that
they might not be seen if it happened, and
which I made him sensible I very much ap-
proved of. Immediately he fell to work,
and never was a grave-digger more dex-
terous than he was: for in an instant, he
scraped a large hole in the sand with his
hands, sufficient to bury the first in; there
be dragged him, and without any cere-
mony he covered him over; in like manner
he served the other: all this was done in
less-than a quarter of an hour. I then
called him away, and instead of carrying
him directly to my castle, I conveyed him
to my cave on the farther part of the island ;
and so my dream was now fulfilled in that
particular, that my grove should prove an
asylum or sanctuary to. him.
Here I gave him hreafl'aiil a bunch of
raisins to eat, and water to'drink, on which
be fed very cheerfully, to his exceeding re-
freshment. I then made him a bed with a
parcel of rice straw, and a blanket upon
it, and pointing to it, made signs for him
to lie down to sleep, upon which the poor
creature went to take a welcome repose.

Indeed he was a very handsome young
fellow, extremely well-made, with straight
longlimbs, not too large, but tall and well-
shaped, and, as near as I-could reckon,
about twenty-six years of age. His coun-
tenance had nothing in it fierce or surly,
but rather a sort of majesty, and, especi-
ally when he smiled, he had all the sweet--
ness and softness of an European.- His
hair was not curled like wool, as many of
the blacks are, but long and black, with
the most beautiful yet careless tresses
spreading over his shoulders. He had a
very high and large forehead, with a great

yivacity and sparkling sharpness in his
M
eyes. His skin was not so tawny as the.
Virginian Brazilians, or other Americans,
but rather of a bright dun olive colour,
that had something agreeable in it, though
not very easy to describe. His face was '
round and plump, with a small nose, very
different from the flatness of the Negroes,
a pretty small mouth, thin lips, fine teeth,
very well set, and white as the driven snow.
In a word, such handsome features, and
exact symmetry in every part, made me
consider, thatI had saved the life of an
Indian prince.

As I understood him in many things, I
made him sensible I was very well pleased
with him; and, in a little time, I began to
speak to him, and taught him to talk to me
again. In the first place I made him under-
stand his name was to be Friday, because
it was upon that day'I ,saved his life; then
I taught him to say Master, which I made
him sensible was to be my name. I like-
wise taught him to say Yes and No, andor .aonmsox cnvsos. 135

to know what they meant. I gave him
some milk in an earthen pot, making him
view me while I drank it before him, and
soaked my bread in it; I gave him a cake
of bread, and caused him to soak it like-
wise, to which he readily consented, mak-
ing signs of the greatest satisfaction.

All that night I kept him there; but in
the morning I ordered him to arise, and
come along with me, with certain tokens
that Iwould give him some clothes like
mine, at which he seemed very glad, being
stark naked.

I carried him with me to my castle, and
gave him a pair of linen drawers, which I
had taken out of the poor gunner's chest,
and which. with a little alteration, fitted
him very well: in the next placelmade
him a jerkin of goat's skin, such as my
skill was able to manage, and indeed I
thought myself then a tolerable good tailor.
I gave him also a cap which I had made of

a hare's skin, very convenient and fashions
M 2
able.---Thus being clothed tolerably well,
my man was no less proud of his habit,
than I was at seeing him in it. Indeed he
went very awkwardly at first, the drawers
being too heavy on his thighs, not used to
bear any weight, and the sleeves of the
waistcoat galled his shoulders and the in-
side of his arms; but by a little easing
where he complained they hurt him, and
by using himself to them, at length he
took to them very well.

My next concern was, where I should
lodge him; and that I might do well by
him, and yet be perfectly easy myself, I
erected a tent for him in the vacant place
between my two fortifications, in the in-
side of the last, and the outside of the
first; and, as there was an entrance or
door into my cave, I made a formal fram-
ed door-case, and a door to open on the
inside; [barred it up in the night time,
taking in my ladders too, so that, was my
man to prove treacherous, there could be
no way to come at me in the inside of my
innermost wall, without making so much
noise in getting over, that it must waken me.
But there was no occasion for this pre-
caution; for surely a master never had a
more sincere; faithful, and loving servant
than Friday proved to me. Without pas-
sion, sullenness, or design; perfectly oblig-
ing and engaging, his affections were as
much tied to me, as those of a child to its
parents; and I might venture to say, he
would have sacrificed his life for the saving

of mine, upon any occasion whatsoever.
One morning I took him out with \me,
with an intention to kill a kid out of the
flock and bring it home, and dress it. As
I was going, I perceived a she-goat lying
down in the shade, and two young kids
sitting by her. Immediately I catched
hold of my man Friday, and bidding him
stand still, and not stir, I presented my
piece, and shot one of the kids. My poor
servant, who at a distance perceived me
M 8 ,
kiii his adversary, and yet did not know
by what means, or how it was done, stood
trembling and surprised, and looked so
amazed, that I thought he would have
sunk into the earth. He did not see the
lm'l I aimed at, or behold I had killed it,
but ripped up his waistcoat to see if he
was not wounded, thinking my intention
was to kill him; for coming to me, he fell
on his knees, earnestly pronouncing many
things which I did not understand the
meaning of; which at length I perceived
was, IhatI would not take away his life.
---To convince him that I would do him no
harm, I took him smiling by the hand,
then laughing at him, and pointing to the
kid which I had slain, made signs to him
to fetch it, which accordingly he did.--
He would not so much as touch the gun for
several days after, but would come and
communicate his thoughts to it, and talk
to it, as if , the senseless piece had under-
stood and answered him; all this I could
perceive him do, when he thought my back
was turned, the chief intent of which was,
to desire it not to kill him, as I after.
wards discovered.

I brought home the kid, and the same
evening 'took off the skin and divided the
carcase as well as I could. Part of the flesh
I stewed: and then spreading my table, I
sat down, giving my man some of it to
eat, who was wonderfully pleased: but
what was most surprising to him was to
see me eat salt with it: upon which he
made me understand, that salt was very '
bad for me; when putting a little into his
mouth he seemed to nauseate it in such a
manner, as to spit and splutter at it, and
then washed his mouth with fresh water;
but to show him how contrary his opinion
was to mine, I put some, meat in my mouth
without salt, and feigned to spit and splut.
ter as much for the want of it, as he had
done at it ; .yet all this proved of-no signi-
fication to Friday; and it was a long while
before he could endure. salt in his meat or
broth, and even then but a small quantity.

Thus having fed him sufliciently with
boiled meat and broth at that time, the
next day I was resolved to feast him with
a roasted piece of the kid. And having
no spit to fasten it, nor jack to turn it, I
made use of that common artifice which
many of the common people of England
have, that is, to set two poles upon each
side of the fire, and one across on the top,
hanging the meat thereon with a string,
and so turning round continually, roast it.
This practice caused great admiration in
my man Friday. But when he came to
taste the sweetness and tenderness of the
flesh, he expressed his entire satisfaction
in a thousand different ways; and made it
very plain to me, that he would never,
while he lived, eat man's flesh more.

It was now high time I should set my
servant to work; so next day I set him to
beat out some corn, and sift it in the same
manner I had done before. And really the
fellow was very quick and handy in the
execution of any thing I ordered him to go
about. I made him understand that it was
to make bread for us to eat, and afterwards
let him see me make it. In short, he did
every thing I ordered him, in a'little time,
as well as I could perform it myself.

But now considering that I had two
mouths to feed instead of one, it was ne~
cessary that I should provide more ground
for my harvest, and plant a larger quantity
of corn than I used to do; upon which I
marked out a larger 'piece of land, fencing
it in, in the same manner as before; in the
execution of which I must give Friday this
good word, that no man could work with
better will than he did; and when I made
him sensible that it was for bread to serve
him as well as me, he made me understand,
that he thought I had much more labour
on his account than I had for myself; and
that no pains or diligence should he wants
ing in him, if I would but direct him what
to do.

I must own, that this was the most
pleasant year I ever had in the island ; for
after some time, Friday began to talk pretty
well, and understood the names of those
things which I was wont to call for, and
the places where I used to send him. So
that my long silent tongue, which had been
useless so many years, except in an ex-
clamatory manner, either for deliverance
or blessings, now began to be occupied in
teaching and talking to my man Friday;
for so innocent did his simple and un--
feigned honesty appear to me, thatl began
entirely to love him.

I believe there is no state of life but
what may be happy, if people would but
endeavour to make it so. He is not the
happiest man that has the most riches;
but he that is content with what he has.
Before I had my servant, I thought myself
miserable; and now that I had enjoyed
the happy benefits of him, I still com-
plained, and begged a deliverance from a
place of retirement, ease, and plenty,
where Providence had sufficiently blessed
me. In a word, from this timeI enter-
tained some hopes, that one time or other
Imight find an opportunity to make my
escape from this island, and that this poor
savage might be a great furtherance thereto.

All this time since my man became so
intelligent as to understand and speak to
me, I spared no pains or diligence to in-
struct him, according to my poor share of
knowledge, in the principles of religion,
and the adoration that he ought to pay to
the true God. One time, as I very well
remember, I asked him who made him?
At first the innocent creature did not un-
derstand what I meant, but rather thought
I asked him who was his father? Upon
which I took another way to make him
sensible. Friday, said I, who is it that
made the sea, this ground whereon we
walk, and all these hills and woods which
we behold? and here indeed I did not miss
my intention; for he told me it was Old
Benamnckee (the God whom I suppose
these savages adored) who lived a great
way beyond all. But as to his attributes,
poor Friday was an utter stranger. He
could describe nothing of this great per-
son; and all that he could say was, that
he was very old, much older than the Sea
and land, the moon, or the stars. Friday,
said I again, if this great and old person
has made all things in the world, how
comes it to pass, that all things, as you in
particular, do not adore and worship him?
Upon this, looking very grave, with a per-
fect sweet look of innocence, he replied,
" Master, all things say 0 to him," by
which it may be '_reasonably supposed he
meant adoration. And where, said I, do
-the people of your country go when they
die? He answered to Benamnckee. What,
and those people that are eaten up, do
they go there? " Benamuckee," said he,
" love 'em dearly; me pray to Benamuckee
"in de canoe, and Benamuckee would love
" me when they eat me all up."

Such discourses as these had I with my
man, which made me sensible, that the
true God is worshipped, though under
imperfect similitudes; and that the false
adoration which the Heathens give to their
imaginary Deity, is as great an argument
of the divine essence, as the most learned
Atheists can bring against it; for God
will be glorified in his warks, let their de-
nomination be what it will.

I began to instruct my servant in the
saving knowledge of the true Deity, in
which the directions of God's Holy Spirit
assisted me. I lifted up my hands to Hea-
ven, and pointing thereto, told him, that
the great maker of Heaven and Earth lived
there; that, as his infinite power fashioned
this world out of a confused chaos, and

made it in that beautiful frame which we
N
behold, so he governs and preserves it by
his unbounded knowledge, sovereign great-
ness, and peculiar providence; that he
was omnipotent, could do every thing for
us, give every thing to us, and take every
thing away from us; that he was the re-
warder of good and punisher ofevil actions;
that there was nothing but what he knew,
no thoughts so secret but what he could
bring to light: and thus by degrees I
opened his eyes, and described to him the
manner of the creation of the world, the
situation of paradise, the transgression of
our first parents, the wickedness of God's
peculiar people, and the universal sins
and abominations of the whole earth.--
When these things were implanted in his
mind, I told him, that as God's justice was
equal to his mercy, he resolved to destroy
this world, till his Son Jesus Christ in-
terposed in our behalf; and, to procure
our redemption, obtained leave of his hea--
venly Father to come down from Heaven
into the World, where he took human na-
ture upon him, instructed us in our way
to eternal life, and died as a sacrifice for
our sins; that he was now ascended into
Heaven, mediating for our pardon, deli-
vering our petitions and obtaining all those
benefits which we ask in his name, by-
humble and hearty prayers, all which were
heard at the throne of Heaven

By the constant application I made to
the Scriptures, as I read them to my man
Friday, I earnestly endeavoured to make
him uuderstand'every part of it, as much
as lay in my power. He also, on the
other hand, by his very serious questions
and enquiries, made me a much better
proficient in Scripture knowledge, than!
should have been by my own private read-
ing and study.

You may well suppose, that by the fre-
quent discourse we had together, my man
and I became most intimately acquainted,

and that there was but very little that I
N 2
could say but what Friday understood;
indeed he spoke very fluently, though it
was but broken English.

I gave him a very particular description
of the. territories of Europe, and in a par.
ticnlar manner of Old England, the place
of my nativity. I laid before him 'the
manner of our worshipping God, our be-
haviour one to another, and how we trade
in ships to every part of the universe.--
I then told him my misfortunes in being
shipwrecked; I brought him to the ruins of
my boat, which before my whole strength
could not move, but now was almost rot-
ten and fallen to pieces. I observed my
man Friday viewed this boat with un-
common curiosity; when he had done, he
stood pondering a great while, but said
' nothing. At last, said I, Friday, what
makes you ponder so? He replied, " 0
master, me see like boat come to place at
my nation."

It was some time before I understood
what my man meant; but examining strict-
ly into it, I plainly found, that a boat
resembling mine, had come upon the
country where he dwelt. It then came
into my mind, that some European ship
having been cast away, the poor distressed
creatures were forced to have recourse to
the boat to save their lives; and being all,
as I thought, drowned, I never concerned
myself to ask any thing concerning them,
but my only inquiry was about the boat,
and what description my man could give
of it.

Indeed, Friday answered my demands
very well, making every thing very plain
to my understanding; but beyond measure
was I satisfied, when he told me with great
warmth and ardonr, " 0 master, we save
white mans from drown ;" upon which I
immediately asked him, if there were any
white mans, as he called them, in the
boat'!- " Yes, yes," said he, " the boat

full, very full of white mans." How many.
N 3
Friday? said I. Hereupon be numbered
his fingers, and counted seventeen. And
when I asked him what became of them
all, and whether they lived or not? he
replied "Yes, master, they all live, they
be live among my nation." This infor--
mation put fresh thoughts into my head,
that these must be those very men who
before I concluded had been swallowed up
in the ocean, after they had left the ship,
that had struck upon the rocks of my
kingdom, and after escaping the fury of
the deep, landed upon the wild shore, and
committed themselves to the fury of the
devouring Indians.

The manner of their cruelties to one
another, which consequently as I thought,
must be acted with great barbarity to
strangers, created in me great anxietv,
and made me still more curious to ask
Friday confining them. He told me, he
was sure they still lived there, having re~
sided among them above four years, and
that the savages gave them victuals to live
upon; But pray, Friday, said I, whence
proceeded all this good nature and gene-
rosity? How came it to pass that they
did not kill and-eat them? " No, no,"
said Friday, "they not kill 'em, they
make brothers with 'em." I had a more
favourable opinion of the Indians, upon
Friday's uttering these words: "My na-
tion, t'other nation no eat mans, but when
mans make war fight;" as though he had
said, that neither those of his kingdom,
nor any other nations that he knew of,
ever eat their fellow creatures, but such
as their law of arms allowed to be de-
voured; that is those miserable captives,
whose misfortune it should be to be made
prisoners of war. '

Some considerable time after, upon a
very pleasant day, in most serene weather,
my man and I stood upon the top of a hill,
on the east side of the island, whence I
hadlonce before beheld the continent of
America. I could not tell immediately
what was the matter; for suddenly Friday
began jumping and dancing as if he had
been mad; and upon my demanding the
reason of his behaviour, " 0 joy," said
he, 0 glad! there see my country, there
my nation, there live white mans gether."
And indeed a rapturous sense of pleasure
appeared in his countenance, his eyes had
an uncommon sparkling and brightness,
as if he had a longing desire to be in his
country again

As we were walking up the same hill
another day, when the weather was so
hazy at sea, that I could not perceive the
continent, Friday, said I, don't you wish
yourself in your own country, among your
old friends and acquaintances? "Yes,"
said he, " me much 0 glad to be at my
own nation." And what would you do
there, Friday '2 Would you turn wild
again, eat man's flesh, and be as savage
as you were formerly? "' No, no," (ans-
wered he, full of concern, and shaking his
head,) "Friday now tell them to live good,
tell them pray God, tell them to eat corn,
bread, cattle, flesh, milk, no eat man
again." But surely, replied I, if you
should offer to do all this, they will kill
you; and to manifest their contempt of
such instruction eat you up when they
have done. He then put on a grave, yet
innocent and smooth countenance, saying,
"No, they no kill me, they willing love
learnz" adding withal, " that they had
learned much of the bearded mans that
came in the boat." Will you, said I, go
back again, F riday'! He smiled at that,
and told me, that he could not swim so
far. But, said I, I will make a canoe for
you. " Yes, master," said he, " me go
if you go; me no go, if you stay." I go,
Friday! why would you have them to eat
me up, and devour your kind master?
" No, no," said he, "me make them not
eat master, and me make them much love
you:" and then he related to me, as well
as he was able, how exceedingly kind those
of his nation were to the white, or beard-
ed men, as he called them, who, in their
great calamity, were driven into their
country.

It was from this time I had strong in-
clinations to venture over, and use my
utmost efforts to join these white bearded
men, who undoubtedly were Spaniards or
Portuguese. Some days after, Friday and
I being at work, as usual, I told him I had
a boat which I would bestow upon him,
whenever be pleased to return to his own
nation; and to convince him of the truth
of what I said, I took him with me to the
other side of the island, where my frigate
lay, and taking it from under the water,
(for I always kept it sunk for fear ofa dis
covery,) we went both into it to see how
it would manage on such an expedition.

And really never could any one be more
dexterous in rowing than my faithful sen.
vent, making the boat go as fast again as
Icould. Well now, Friday, said I, shall
we go to your so much admired nation?
But instead of meeting with that cheerful-
ness I expected, he looked very dull and
melancholy at my saying so; which in-
deed at first surprised me, till he made
me sensible, that his concern was about
the boat being too small to go so far a
voyage. Upon which I let him understand
[had much bigger; and, accordingly, the
next day went to the place where the first
boat lay, which I had made, when all the
strength I had, or art I could use, failed
in my attempt to get it into the water:
but now it having lain in the sun two and
twenty years, and no care being taken .of
it all that while, it became in a manner
rotten. My man told me, that such a
boat would do very well for that purpose,
sufficient to carry enough vittle, drink,
bread, for that was his manner of talking.
In short, my mind being strongly fixed
upon my designs of going over with him
to the continent, I very plainly told him
that we would both go and make a boat
full as big, and more proportionable than
that, wherein he might safely return to
his own nation.

These words made Friday look so very
pensive, that I thought he would have
fallen at my feet. It was some time be--
fore he could speak a word, which made
me ask him what was the matter with him?
He replied, in a very soft and moving tone,
" What has poor Friday done? why are
you angry, mad with poor servant? What
me done, 0 what me done?" Friday,
said I, you never yet have offended me.
what makes you think I am anng with
you, when I am not angry at all. " You
no angry, no angry," said he, several
times; " if you be no angry, why den send
Friday over great water to my own na-
tion!" Why surely, Friday, answered I,
did not you wish to be there, when from
a mountain you beheld the place where
you was born? " Yes, yes," said Friday,
"me wish to be there, sure enough, but
then me wish master there too: no wish
Friday there, no master there." In short,
he could not endure the thoughts of going
without me. Igo there! Friday, said I,-
what should I do there? He answered
very quickly, " 0 master, you do great
deal much good, you teach all devwild
mans to be good tame mans: you learn
dem to be sober, live good life, to know
God, and pray God." Alas! poor Fri-
day, said I, what can I do against their
priests of Benamuckee, or indeed what
good can I'make your nation sensible of,
when I myself am but a poor ignorant
man? "No, no, master," said he, " you
be no ignorant, you teachee me good, you
teachee dem good." You shall go without
me, Friday, said I, for I don't care to
accompany you thither; I would rather

live in this solitude than venture among
0
such inhuman savages. Go your way,
since you desire it, and leave me alone by
myself, as I was before I saved your life.
1Never was any creature more thunder-
struck than Friday at these words. " Go
me away, leave master away," said he,
after a long silence, " no, no, Friday die,

'

Friday live not master gone,' as though
he had said, I neither can nor will live, it'
my master sends me from him.

After I had told Friday in a very care-
less manner, that he should be at liberty
as soon as the boat was made, the language
of his eyes expressed the greatest con-
fusion; and, immediately running to one
of his hatchets, which he used to wear as
a defensive weapon, he gave it into my
hand, with a heart so full, that he could
scarcely speak--Friday, said I, what is
it you mean? What must I do with this?
" Only kill Friday," said he, "Friday
care not live long." " But what must!
kill you for 2" replied I again. "Ah!
dear master, what made you Friday save
from eat a me up, so keep long Friday,
make Friday love God, and love not
Benamuckee, and now Friday send away:
never see Friday more." The tears ran
down his cheeks in such a plentiful man-
ner, that I had much ado to refrain from
weeping also. I endeavoured to comfort
him in the best manner I could, by telling
him, if he was content to abide with me,
I should be ever willing to keep him.
After Friday's grief was somewhat abat-
ed,'more fully to convince me of his at:-
fection, he said, " 0 master, me not care
to be in my nation, leave you here: me
desire nation learn good, that's all." But
as I had no apostolic mission, nor any
concern about their salvation, so I had
not the least intention or desire of under-
taking it; and the strength of my incli-
nation, in order to escape, proceeded
chiefly from my late discourse with Fri-

day, about these seventeen white bearded
O 2
men, that had been driven upon the bar--
barian coast, whom I designed to join as
the only means to further our escape. To
which intent my man and I went to search
for a proper tree to fell, whereof we might
make a large canoe, to undertake the voy-
age; and indeed, we were not long in
finding one fit for our purpose, there be-
ing enough wood in the island to have
built a fleet of large vessels; but the thing
we principally wanted, was to get one so
near the water, that we might launch it
after it was finished, and not commit such
a mistake as I had done once before.
After a great search for what was best
and most convenient, Friday, at last, whose
judgment in such affairs was much superior
to mine, pitched upona kind of wood most
fit for it. But though my man exceeded
me in his knowledge of the most proper
tree, yet I showed him a much better and
clearer way to make a canoe than he knew
before; for he was for burning the hollow
or cavity of the tree, in order to make this
boat; but I then told him how he might
do it with tools, learning him at the same
time how to use them, which he did very
dexterously; so that in a month's time we
finished it, making it very handsome, by
cutting the outside in the true shape of a
boat. After this it took us a full fortnight
before we could get her into the water,
which we did as it were inch by inch,
upon great rollers; but when she was in,
she would have carried twenty men, with
all the ease imaginable.

As I was very well pleased, you may
be sure, at the launching of this man of
war of mine, I was no less amazed to be-
hold with what dexterity my man would
manage her, turn her, and paddle her
along. Well, Friday, said I, what do you
think of it now? Do you think this will
carry us over'! " Yes, master," said he,
" me venture over well, though great blow

wind." But my design was yet farther,
03
which he was insensible. of; and that was
to make a mast and a sail, and to provide
her with an anchor and cable. As to a
mast, that was no difficult thing_to pro-
cure: so I fixed upon a straightyoung cedar
tree, which I found near the place, great
plenty of it abounding in the island; and
setting Friday to cut it down, I gave him
particular directions how to shape and
order it; but as to the sail, that I managed
myself. I very well knew I had some old
ones, or pieces of sails enough, which had
lain six and twenty years by me; but not
being careful to preserve them, as think-
ing I should have no occasion to use them
any more, when I came to overlook them,
I found them all rotten except two; and
with these I went to work, and after a
great deal of pains and awkward tedious
stitching for want of needles, at length I
finished a three-cornered ugly thing, like
ll'.lEt_WSS_....SS_all in England a shoulder of
mutton sail, to go with a boom at bottom,
and a little small sprit at the top,"like
those which our long-boats use, and which
I very well knew how to manage, especi-
ally since it was like that which I had in
my patron's fishing boat, when, with my
boy Xury, I made 'my escape from the
barbarian shore.

It was near two months, I think, before
I completed this work, and when all was
done, I had my man to teach its naviga-
tion; for though he very well Understood
how to paddle a canoe along, he was an
utter stranger to a sail and a rudder, and
was amazed when he saw me work the
boat by them, and how the sail gibbed
and filled this way or that way, as the
course we sailed changed. After some
time and a little use, I made all these
things very familiar to him, so that he
became an expert sailor, except in rela-
tion to the compass, and that I could

as it happened, there was seldom oc-y

164 LIFE AND ADVENTURES

casion for it, there being but little
cloudy Weather, and scarce any fog in
those parts; the stars were always visible
in the night, and the shore perspicuous
by day, except in the rainy season, which
confined every one to his habitation. And
this season beginning to come on, obliged
me to keep the longer within doors; but
before this, I brought my new vessel into
the creek, where I had landed my rafts
from the ship, and hauling her up to the
shore, I ordered my man Friday to dig a
dock sufficient to hold her in, and deep
enough to give her water, wherein she
might float; and then when the tide was
out, we made a strong dam across the end
of it, to keep out the water; by which
means she lay dry, as to the tide from the
sea; and to keep the rain from her, we
thatched her over as it were, with boughs
of trees, like a house, so we waited for the
months of November and December, in
which I designed to venture over the ocean.
As soon as the seasonable weather began

.-- to draw near, I prepared for the voyage.
The first thing I thought on was, to lay
by a certain quantity of provisions, as a
sufficient store for such an expedition,
intending in a week or fortnight's time to
open the dock, and to launch out the boat
for that purpose. But one morning as I
was very busy upon something necessary
for this occasion, I called Friday to me,
and bid him go to the sea shore, and see
if he could find a turtle or tortoise, a thing
which we commonly had once a week, as
much upon account of the eggs, as for
the sake of the flesh. He had not been
long gone, before he came running back, as
though he was pursued for life, and, as it
were, flew over my outer wall, or fence,
like one that felt not the ground, and be-
fore I had time to enquire the reason of
his precipitation, he cries out, " O dear
master, 0 sorrow, O sorrow! Bad! 0
bad !" Why what's the matter, Friday,
said I. " O yonder, yonder!" said he,
" there be one, two, or three canoes! two
three!" Surely thought I, there must be
six, by my man's way of reckoning; but
on a stricter enquiry, Ifound there were
but three. Well, Friday, said I, don't be
terrified, I warrant you we will not only
defend ourselves against them, but kill
most of these cruel savages. But though
I comforted him in the best manner I
could, the poor creature trembled so, I
scarce knew what to do with him: " 0
master," said he, " they come look Fri-
day, cut pieces Friday, cut a me up."
Why, Friday, said I, they will eat me
up as well as you, and my danger is as
great as yours. But since it is so, we
must resolve to fight for our lives. What
say you? Can you fight, Friday? " Yes,"
said he, very faintly, "me shoot, me kill
what I can, but there come a great many
number." That's no matter, said I again,
our guns will terrify those we do not kill;
lam very willing to stand by you to the
last drop of my blood. Now tell 'me if
you will do the like by me, and obey my
orders in whatsoever I command? Friday
then answered, " 0 master, me lose life
for you, me die when you bid die." Thus
concluding all questions concerniug'his
fidelity, immediately I fetched him a good
dram of rum. After he had drank it, I
ordered him to take the two fowling--
pieces, which we always carried, and
loaded them with large swan shot, as big
as small pistol bullets; then. I took'four '
muskets, and loaded them with two slugs
and five small bullets each, charging my
two pistols each with a brace; I bring
my great sword, as customary, naked to
my side, and gave Friday his hatchet,'as
a most excellent weapon for defence. .
Thus prepared, I took my perspective
glass, and went up to the side of the hill, to
see what I could discover; and I perceiVed
very soon, by my glass, that there were
One and twenty savages, three prisoners,
and three canoes, and that their chief
concern seemed to be the triumphant ban-
quet upon the three p'oor human bodies,
a thing which by this time I had observed
was very common with them. I also re-
marked, that they did not land at that
place from whence Friday made his es-
cape, but nearer to the creek, where the
shore was low, and where a thick wood
came very close to the sea. My soul was
then filled with indignation and abhor-
rence at such inhuman wretches, .which
put a period to all my former thoughts in
their vindication, neither would I give my-
self time to consider their right of con-
quest, as I had done before: but de-
scending from the mountain, I came down
to Friday, and told him I was resolved to
go speedily to them, and kill them all;
asking him again, in the same breath, if
he would stand by me: when by this time
being recovered from his fright, and his
spirits much cheered with the dram I had
given him, he seriously told me, as he did
before, " When I hid die, he would die,"

And now I divided the loaded arms be-
twixt us. To my man Friday, I gave a
pistol to stick in his girdle, with three
guns upon his shoulder, a weight too great
I confess to bear; but what must a poor
king do, who had but one soldier in the
world? But to show I made him bear no
more than whatl would lay on myself, I
stuck the other pistol in my girdle, and
the other three guns upon my shoulders;
nay, something more, a small bottle of
rum, which was soon lightened to our
exceeding refreshment. Thus we marched
.out, under a ponderous load of armour,
like two invincible champions, with a
quantity of powder and bullets to stand
our battle, and load again when the pieces
were discharged. I charged Friday to

keep close behind me, and notto stir, or
P
shoot, or attempt any thing till I com-
manded him; and in the interim, not to
speak so much as one word.

I soon entered the thick wood, (my man
Friday following close behind,) when with
all possible wariness and silence I marched
till I came to_ the skirt of it, on that side
which was the nearest to them; for only
one end of the wood interposed between
me and them, I called very softly to
Friday, and showing him a great tree,
that was just at the corner of the wood,
I ordered him to repair thither, and bring
me word if he could perceive their ac-
tions; he did as I commanded him, and
came back with this melancholy story,
that they were all about their fire, eating
the flesh of one of their prisoners; and
that another lay bound upon the sand, at
a little distance from them, which they
designed for the next sacrifice, and this
he told me was not one of their nation,
but one of those very bearded men, who
were driven by a storm into their country,
and whom he had so often talked to me
about. You may be sure that upon hear-
ing this, my soul was ready to sink within
me: when, ascending a tree, I saw plainly
by my glass, a white man who lay upon
the beach, with his hands and feet tied
with things resembling rushes, being cover-
ed with clothes, and seemed to be an Eu-
ropean. From the tree where I took this
prospect, Iperceived another tree and a
thicket beyond it, about fifty yards nearer
to them than where I was, which, by
taking a small (circle round, I might come
at undiscovered, and then I should be
within half a shot of these devourers And
going back about twenty paces, I got be-
hind some bushes, which held all the way
till I came to- the other tree; and then I
ascended a little rising ground, not above

eighteen yards distance, where I had a
P2
full view of these creatures, and could
perceive all their actions.

No less than nineteen sat upon the
ground, close huddled together, expressing
all the delight imaginable at so barbarous
an entertainment; and they had just sent
the other two to murder this poor un~
happy Christian, and bring him limb by
limb to their fire; for they were then
going to untie the bands from his feet in
order for death, as fetters are knocked
off the feet of malefactors before they go
to the place of execution. Hereupon,
immediately turning to my man Friday,
now, Friday, said I, mind what I say,
fail in nothing, but do exactly as you see
me do. All which he promising, I set
down one of my muskets and fowling piece
upon the ground, and Friday did the same
by his; and with the other musket I took
my aim at the savages, bidding him do
the like. Are you ready? said I: "Yes,
master," said be; why then fire at them,
said I; and that very moment I gave fire
likewise. '

I only killed one and wounded two; but
my man Friday, taking his aim much
better than I, killed two and wounded
three. You may be sure they were in a
dreadful consternation at such an IUDCX'
pected disaster, and those who had yet
escaped our shot, immediately jumped
upou their feet, but were in such con-
fusion, that they knew. not which way to
run, not knowing from whence their de-
struction came. We threw down our '
pieces and took up others, giving a se-
cond dreadful volley; but as they were
loaded only with swan shot, or small
pistol bullets, we perceived only two of
them fall; though many were wounded,
who ran yelling and screaming. about like
mad creatures. Now, Friday, said I, lay
down your piece, and take up the musket,

P3
and follow me. He (lid so, with great
courage; when, showing ourselves to the
savages, we gave a great shout, and made
directly to the poor victim, who would
have been sacrificed had not our first fire
obliged the butchers, with three others,
to jump into a canoe. By my order Fri-
day fired at them, at which shot I thought
he had killed them all, by their falling to
the bottom of the boat; however, he killed
two, and mortally wounded a third. In
the mean time, I cut the flags that tied
the hands and feet of the poor creature,
and lifting him up, asked him in the Por-- \
tuguese tongue, What he was? He ans-
wered me in Latin, Christianus; but so
very weak and faint, that he could scarce
stand or speak. Immediately I gave him
a dram and a piece of bread, and asked
him what countryman he was? He said
Ilispaniola, and thenuttered all the thank-
fulness imaginable for his deliverance.
Seignior, said I, with as much Spanish
as I was master of, let us talk afterwards,
but fight now; here take this sword and
pistol, and do what you can. And, in--
deed, he did so with such courage and
intrepidity, that he cut two of them in
pieces in an instant, the savages not ha--
ving the power to fly for their lives. I
ordered Friday to run for those pieces we
had left at the tree, which he brought
me with great swiftness, and then I gave
him my musket, while I loaded the rest.
There happened a fierce encounter be-
tween the Spaniard and one of the savages;
and though the former was as brave as
could be expected, having twice wounded
his enemy in the head, yet being weak
and faint, the Indian had thrown him
upon the ground, and was wresting my
sword out of his hands, which the Spaniard
very wisely quitting, drew out his pistol
and shot him through the body before I
could come near him, though I was run-
ning to his assistance, As for Friday,
he pursued the flying wretehes with his
hatchet, dispatching three, but the rest
were too nimble for him. The Spaniard
taking one of the fowling pieces, wounded
two, who runding into the wood, Friday
pursued and killed; but the other, not-
withstanding his wounds, plunged himself
into the sea, and swam to those who
were left in the canoe, which, with one
wounded, were all that escaped out of
one and twenty.

The savages in the canoe worked very
hard to get out of our reach, and Friday
was eager in pursuing them; and indeed
I was no less anxious about their escape,
lest, after the news had been carried to
their people, they should return in multi~
tudes and destroy us. So being resolved
to pursue them, I jumped into one of
their canoes, and bid Friday follow me;
but no sooner was I in, than, to my sur-
prise, I found another poor creature bound
hand and foot for the slaughter, just as
the Spaniard had been, with very little
life in him. I unbound him, and would
have helped him up, but he could neither
stand nor speak, but groaned piteously,
thinking he was only unbound in order to

be slain. Hereupon I bid Friday speak-

to him, and tell him of his deliverance;
when pulling out my bottle, I made the
poor wretch drink a dram, which, with
the joyful news he had received, so re-
vived him, that he sat up. As soon as
Friday heard him speak, and looked more
fully in his face, it would have moved
any one to tears to perceive his uncommon
transports; he kissed, embraced him, hug-
ged him, cried, laughed, hallooed, jumped
about, danced, sung. wrung his hands,
and beat his face and head, like a dis-
tracted creature; so that it was a great
while beforel could make him speak or
tell me what was the matter; but at last
he told me it was his father.

I was infinitely moved to see the dutiful
and tender afl'ection this poor savage had
to his aged parent. He would sit down
by him in the boat, open his breast, and
hold his father's head close to his bosom,
half an hour together, to cherish him:
his arms and ancles, which were stiff and
numbed with binding, he chafed and rub-
bed with his hands: perceiving what the
case was, I gave him some rum, which
proved of great benefit to him.

While we were thus employed, the sa-
vages were almost out of sight; and happy
it was we did not pursue them: for there
arose from the north-west such a violent
storm, that I could not suppose otherwise
but that they were all drowned. After
this I called Friday to me, and asked him
if he had given his father any bread? He
shook his head and said, " None, not one
hit, me eat a up all;" so I gave him "a
cake of bread, and likewise a dram for
himself, and two or three bunches of
raisins for his father. Both these he car-
ried to him, for he would make him drink
the dram to comfort him. '

Then he ran for an earthen jug of water
for his father, which revived his spirits
more than all the rum I had given him.

I then called Friday to me, and ordered
him to carry the Spaniard a cake, and
some water, who was reposing himself
under the shade of a tree, but so weak,
that though he exerted himself, he could
not stand. Upon which I ordered Friday
to rub and bathe his ancles with rum, as
he had done his father's.--Every minute
he was employed in this, he would cast
a wistful eye towards the boat, where he
left his father sittinw- who suddenly dis-

:3,
appearing, he flew like lightning to him,
and finding he had only laid himself down
to ease his limbs, he returned to me pre--
sently, and then I spoke to the Spaniard
to let Friday help him, and lead him to
the boat, in order to be conveyed to my
dwelling, where I would take care of him.
Upon which Friday took him upon his
back, and carried him to the canoe, set--
ting,r him close by his father; and presently
stepping out again, launched the boat off
and paddled it along the shore faster than
I could walk, though the wind blew veiy
hard, and having brought: them safe to
the creek, he took them out of the boat;
but so weak were they that I was forced
to make a kind of a hand-barrow to con-
vey them to my castle.

To get provisions for my poor weak
subjects, I ordered Friday to kill me a
yearling goat; which, when he had done,
I .cut off the hinder quarters, and chop
ping it into small pieces, boiled and stewed
it, putting barley and rice into the broth.
This I carried into their tent, set a table,
dined with them myself, and encouraged
them. Friday was my interpreter to his
father, and indeed to the Spaniard too,
who spoke the language of the savages
pretty well. After diunerI ordered Fri-
day to fetch home all our arms from the
field of battle, and the next day, to bury
the dead bodies, which he did accordingly.

I made Friday enquire of his father,
whether he thought these savages had es-
caped the late storm in their canoe? and
if so, whether they would not return with
a power too great for us to resist? He
answered, that he thoughtvit impossible
they could outlive the storm; or, if they
were driven southwardly, they would come
to a land where they would he certainly
devoured.

No canoes appearing soon after, as I

expected, my apprehensions ceased; and
Q
my former thoughts of a voyage returned,
especially when Friday's father assured
me, I should have good usage in his na-
tion. As to the Spaniard, he told me,
that sixteen more of his countrymen and
Portuguese, who had been shipwrecked,
made their escape thither; that though
they were in union with the savages, yet
they were very miserable for want ofpro-
visions and other necessaries. When I
asked him about the particulars of his
voyage, he answered that their ship was
bound from Rio de la Plata to the Ha-
vannah; that when the ship was lost, only
five men perished in the ocean; the rest,
having saved themselves in the boat,- were
now landed on the main continent. And
what do they intend to do there? said I.
He replied, they had concerted measures
to escape, by building a vessel, but they
had neither tools nor provisions, so that
all their designs came to nothing. Sup-
posing, said I, I should make a proposal,
and invite them here, would they not
carry me prisoner to New Spain! He
answered no; for he knew them to be
honest men, who would scorn to act so
basely to their deliverer: that, if I pleased,
he and the old savage would go over and
talk with them about it, and bring me an
answer: that they should all swear fidelity
to me as their leader; and he would not
only do the same, but stand to the last
drop of his blood, should there be ac-
casion.

These solemn assurances made me re-
solve to grant them relief, and to send
these two over for that purpose; but
when every thing was ready, the Spaniard
raised an objection, which carried great
weight with it: "You know, Sir," said
he, " that having been some time with
you, I cannot but be sensible of your stock

of rice and corn; sufficient, perhaps, for
Q2
us at present, but not for them, should
they come over presently, much less to
victual a vessel for an intended voyage.
Want might be as great an occasion for
them to disagree and rebel, as the children
of Israel did against God himself, when
they wanted bread in the wilderness. And,
therefore, my advice is, to wait another
harvest, and in the mean time cultivate
and improve more land, whereby we may
have plenty of provisions, in order to
execute our design."

This advice of the Spaniard's I approved
extremely, and so satisfied was I of his
fidelity, that I esteemed him ever after.
We all four went to work upon some more
land, and against seed-time. we had so
much cured and trimmed up, as was sufli-
cient to sow twenty-two bushels of barley
and sixteen jars of rice. As we were four
in number, and by this time all in good
health, we feared not a hundred Indians,
should they venture to attack us; and
while the corn was growing, I pitched
upon some trees, fit to build us a large
vessel, in case the Spaniards came over;
which being marked, I ordered Friday
and his father to cut them down, appoint-
ing the Spaniard, who was now my privy
counsellor, to oversee and direct the whole.
I likewise increased my flocks of goats,
by shooting the wild dams, and bringing
home their kids to my inclosure. Nor
did I neglect the grape Season, but cured
them as usual, though I had such a quan--
tity now, as would have filled eighty
barrels with raisins. And thus all of us
being employed, they in working, and [
in providing for them, till harvest came,
God Almighty blessed the increase of it
so much, that out of twenty-two barrels
of barley, we threshed out two hundred
and twenty, and the like quantity of rice.

sufiicieut to victual a ship lit to carry
Q3
me and all the Spaniards to any part
of America.

Thus the principle objection being ans--
wered, I sent my two ambassadors over
to the main land, with a regal authority
to administer the oaths of allegiance and
fidelity, and have an instrument signed
under their hands, though I never asked
whether they had pen, ink, or paper;
when, giving each of them a musket, eight
charges of powder and ball, and provisions
enough for eight days, they sailed away
with a fair gale.-

Scarce a fortnight had elapsed, when
impatient for their return, I laid down to
sleep one morning, when a strange acci--
dent happened, which was ushered in by
Friday's running to me, and calling aloud,
"Master, master, they are come, they

are come."

Upon which, not dreaming
of any danger, out Ijumped from my bed,

put on my clothes, and hurried through
my little grove; when, lodking towards
the sea, I perceived a boat about a league
and a half distant, standing in for the
shore with the wind fair. Ibeheld they
did not come from the side where the land
lay, but from the southernmost end of the
island: so these being none of the people
we wanted, I ordered Friday to lie still,
till I came down from the mountain, which
I now ascended, in order to discover more
fully what they were; and with the help
of my perspective glass, I plainly per-
ceived an English ship, which filled me
with such uncommon transports of joy as
I cannot describe; and yet some secret
doubts hung about me, proceeding from I
know not what cause, as though I had
reason to be upon my guard.

It was not long before I perceived the
boat approach the shore, as if they were
. looking for a place where they might con-
veniently land; and at last they ran their
boat on shore upon the beach, about half
a mile distance. Now I was fully con-
vinced they were all Englishmen, three of
which were unarmed and bound; when
immediately the first four or five leaped
on shore, and took those three out of the
boat as prisoners; one of whom I could
perceive used the most passionate gestures
of entreaty, affliction, and despair, while
the others showed great concern.

Not knowing the meaning of this, I was
very much astonished, and I beckoned to
Friday, who was below, to ascend the
mountain. "0 master," said he to me,
" you see English mans eat prisoners as
well as savage mans." And do you think
they will eat them, Friday? said I, " Yes,"
said Friday, "they eat a all up." No,
no, said I, Friday, I am much more con-
cerned lest they murder them, but as for
eating them up, that I am sure they will
never do.
And now I not only lamented my mis-
fortune in not having the Spaniard and
the savage with me, but also that I could
not come within shot of them unperceived,
and save these three men, whom I thought
they were going to kill. But some com-
fort it was to me, that I perceived they
were set at liberty to go where they
pleased, the rascally seamen scattering
about as though they had a mind to see
the place; and so long did they negli-
gently ramble, that the tide had ebbed so
low as to leave the boat aground. Nor
were the two men who were in her more
circumspect; for having drunk a little
too much liquor, they fell fast asleep;
but one of them waking before the other,
and perceiving the boat too fast aground
for his strength to move, he hallooed out
to the rest, who made all possible expedi-
tion to come to him; but as Providence
ordered it, all their force was inefi'ectnal
to launch her, when] could hear them
speak to one another, " Why let her alone,
Jack, can't ye, she'll float next tide ;" by
which I was convinced they were my own
countrymen. I took two fusees on my
shoulder, and gave Friday three mushets;
besides, my formidable goat--skin coat and
monstrous cap made me look as fierce
and terrible as Hercules of old, especially
when two pistols were stuck in my belt,
and my naked sword hanging by my side.

It was my design at first not to make
any attempt till it was dark; and it being
now two o'clock, in the very heat of the
day, the sailors were all straggling in the
woods, and undoubtedly were lain down
to sleep. The three poor distressed crea~
tures, too anxious to get any repose, were
seated under the shade of a great tree,
about a quarter of a mile from me. Upon
which, without any more ado, I ap-
proached them, with my man following
behind me, and, before I was perceived,
I called aloud to them in Spanish, "What
are ye, Gentlemen I"

At these words, they started up in great
confusion, when they beheld the strange
figure I made; they returned no answer,
but seemed as if they would fly from me.
"Gentlemen," said I, in English, "don't
be afraid; perhaps you have a friend
nearer than you expect." "He must be
from Heaven," said one of them, gravely,
pulling off his hat, "for we are past all
help in this world." " All help is from
Heaven," said I; "but, Sir, as] have
perceived every action between you and
these brutes since your landing, only in-
form me how to assist you, and I will do
it to the utmost of my power."

" Am I talking with God or man," said
he. " Are you of human kind or an
angel?" " Sir," said I, "my poor habit
will tell you I am a man, and an Englislb
man, willing to assist you, having but
this servant. Here are arms and ammu-
nition; tell freely your condition: Can
we save you?" " The story," said he,
" is too long to relate, since our butchers
are so near; but Sir, I was master of that
ship, my men have mutinied, and it is a
favour they have put my mate, this pas-
senger, and me, on shore without mur-
dering us, though we expect nothing but
perishing here." " Are your enemies
gone?" said I. "No," replied he, point-
ing to a thicket, " there they lie, while
my heart trembles, lest having seen and
heard us, they should murder us all."
"Have they fire arms'!" said I. "They
have but two pieces," said he, " one of
which is left in the bOat." He also told
me there were two enormous villains a-
mong them, that were the authors of this
mutiny, who, if they were killed or seized,
the rest might return to their obedience.
" Well, well, said I, "let us retire far-
ther under cover of the woods ;" and there
it was I made these conditions with him.

1. That, while they staid in the island,
they should not pretend to any authority;
but should entirely conform to my orders,
and return me the arms which I should
put in their hands.

2. That, if the ship was recovered,
they should afford Friday and myself a
passage, gratis, to England.

When he had given me all the satis-
faction I could desire, I gave him and his
two companions each of them a gun, with
powder and ball sufficient, advising them
to fire upon them as they lay sleeping.
The Captain modestly said, that he was
sorry to kill them; though, on the other
hand, to let these villains escape who
were the authors of his misery, might be
the ruin of us all. " Well," said he, " do

as you think fit;" and so accordingly I
R
tired, killed one of the Captain's chief
enemies, and wounded the others, who
eagerly called for assistance; but the
Captain, who had reserved his piece, com-
ing up to him, " Sirrah," said he, "'tis
too late to call for assistance, you should
rather cry to God to pardon your villany;"
and so knocked him down with the stock
of his gun; three others were also slightly
wounded, who, at my approach, cried out
for help. This the Captain granted, upon
condition that they would swear to be
true to him in recovering the ship, which
they solemnly did; however I obliged the
Captain to keep them bound. After which
Isent Friday and the Captain's mate to
secure the boat, and bring away the oars
and sails; when, at their return, three
men coming back, and seeing their late
distressed Captain now their conquerer,
submitted to be bound also. And then
it was, that having more liberty, I related
the adventures of my own life, which he
heard with serious attention. After this,
I carried him and his two companions
into my little fortified castle; showed
them all my conveniences, and refreshed
them with such provisions as I could af--
ford. When this was over, we began to
consider about regaining the ship. He
said that there were twenty-six hands on
board, who, knowing their lives were for-
feited by the law for conspiracy and mu.
tiny, were so very hardened, that it would
be dangerous for our small company to
attack them. This was a reasonable in-
ference indeed; but something we must
resolve on, and immediately put in exe.
cution. We, therefore, heaved the boat
upon the beach so high, that she could
not shoot off at high-water mark, and
broke a hole in her not easily to be stop--
ped; so that all the signals they gave for

the boat to come on board were in vain.
R 2
This obliged them to send another boat
ashore, with ten men armed, whose faces
the Captain plainly described, the boats.
wain being the chief officer; but he said
there were three honest lads among them,
who were forced into the conspiracy. Here-
upon I gave him fresh courage. When the
sailors landed, and beheld their boat in
that condition, they not only hallooed,
but fired for their companions to hear,
yet they received no answer. This struck
them with horror and amazement; and
thinking they were murdered, they made
as if they would return to the ship. I
could perceive the Captain's countenance
change at this, till of a sudden, three men
were ordered to look after the boat, while
the other seven leapt on shore in order
to search for their companions; and, in-
deed, they came to the brow of the hill,
near my ancient castle, from whence they
could see to a great distance in the woods,
and there shouting and hallooing till tired
and weary, they at length seated them-
selves under a spreading tree. My opinion
was, that nothing could be done till night,
when I might use some artifice to get them
all out of the boat; but of a sudden they
started up, and made to the sea-side: I
then ordered Friday and the Captain's
mate to go over the creek, and halloo as
loud as they could, and so decoying them
into the woods, come round to me again.
And this, indeed, had good effect; for
they followed the noise, till coming west--
ward to the creek, they called for their
boat to carry them over, and taking one
of the men out of her, left two to look
after her, having fastened her to the stump
of a little tree on shore. Hereupon im-
mediately the Captain and our party pass-
ing the creek, out of their sight, we sur-
prised them both, by the Captain's knock-
ing down one and ordering the other to
R8
surrender upon pain of death, and who
being the honestest of them all, .sincerely
joined with us. By this time it was pretty
late; when the rest returning to their boat,
which they found aground in the creek,
the tide out, and the men gone, they ran
about wringing their hands, crying it was
an enchanted island, and that they should
be all murdered by spirits or devils. My
men would willingly have fallen upon
them, but I would not agree to hazard
any of our party. But to be more certain,
Friday and the Captain crawled upon their
hands and feet, as near as possible; and
when the boatswaiu approached in sight,
so eager was the Captain, that he fired
and killed him on the spot; Friday wound--
ed the next man, and a third ran away.
Hereupon I advanced with my whole army;
and it being dark, I ordered the man we
had surprised in the boat, to call them by
their names, and to parley with them,
which he did, and they were at length
induced to Kay down their arms in token
of submission. .

After this, the Captain expostotated
with them, telling them that the governor
was an Englishman, who might execute
them here; but he thought they would
ail he sent to England, except Will Atkins,
who was ordered to prepare for death the
next morning. Hereopon Atkins implored
the Captain to intereede for his life, and
the rest begged they might not be sent to
England. This answered our project for
seizing the ship. For after sending At~
kins and two of the worst fast bound to
the cave, and the rest being committed
to my bower, I sent the Captain to treat
with them in the governor's name, offering
them pardon if they would assist in re>>
covering the ship. Upon which they all
promised to stand by him to the last
drop of their blood; and whoever acted
treacherously, should be hanged in chain:
upon the beach. They were all released
on these assurances; and the Captain re-
paired to the other boat, making his pas~
senger Captain of her, and gave him four
men well armed; while himself, his mate,
and five more went in the other boat. By
midnight they came within call of the
ship, when the Captain ordered Robinson
to hail her, and tell them, that with great
difficulty they had found the men at last.
But while they were discoursing, the Cap-
tain, his mate, and the rest entered and
knocked down the second mate and car--
penter, secured those that were upon deck,
by putting them under hatches, while the
other boat's crew entered and secured the
forecastle; they then broke into the round
house, where the mate, after some re-
sistance, shot the pirate captain through
the head, upon which all the rest yielded
themselves prisoners. And thus the ship0F Romxsox cnvsoe. 201

being recovered, the signal was fired,
which I heard with the greatest joy imagi-
nable; nor was it long before he brought
the ship to anchor at the creek's month,
where coming to me unawares, "There,"
says he, " my dearest friend and deliverer,
there is your ship, and we are year ser-
vants :" a comfort so unspeakable, as made
me swoon in his arms, while, with grati-
tude to heaven, we were tenderly em-
bracing each other.

Nothing now remained, bnt to consult
what we should do with the prisoners,
whom he thought it was not safe to take
on board. Concerting with the Captain,
I dressed myself in one of his suits, and
sending for them, told them, that I was
going to leave the island with all my peo-
ple, if they would stay there, their lives
should be spared; if not, they should be
hanged at the first port they came to.
They agreed to stay. Hereupon I told
them my whole story, charging them to
be kind to the Spaniards, that were ex--
'pected, giving them all my arms, and in-
forming them of every thing necessary for
their subsistence; after which, I and my
man Friday went on board. But the next
morning, two of' the men came swimming
to the ship's side, desiring the Captain
to take them on board, though be hanged
them afterwards, complaining how bar-
barously the others used them. Upon
which I prevailed with the Captain to take
them in; and being severely whipt, they
proved more honest for the future. Thus
I bid farewell to this island, carrying along
with me my money, my parrot, umbrella,
and goat's skin cap; setting sail December
'12, 1686, after twenty-eight years, two
months, and nineteen days residence, that
same day and month that I escaped from
Salee, landing in England June 1], 1687,
after five and thirty years absence from
my own country, which rendered me al-
together a stranger there.

I found my first Captain's widow alive,
but in very mean circumstances. Soon
after, I went down to Yorkshire, where
all my family was expired, except two
sisters, and two of my brother's children.
Ifound no provision had been made for
me, they concluding I had been long since
dead. Thus my circumstances would-have
been very indifl'erent, had not my partner
conducted the affairs of my plantation in
the most honorable and profitable manner
during my absence, so that I found myself
possessed of five thousand pounds, besides
an income of one thousand pounds a year.
I discovered my excellent friend, the Por-
tuguese Captain, and as he was in neces-
sitous circumstances, I evinced my grati-
tude for his past kindness, by a handsome
yearly allowance of money.

Not liking to reside at the Brazils, I
determined to sell my plantation and settle
in England; and marrying a young lady
of very good family, I seemed to bid adieu
to my roving inclinations.------I had two sons
and one daughter; and purchasing a farm
in the county of Bedford, I led the life of
a country gentleman, and was as happy in
my retirement as the greatest monarch in
the world---

Free from all vices, free from care,
Age had no pain, and youth no snare.

But in the midst of this my happiness, I
was suddenly plunged into the greatest
sorrow, by the death of my dear and
tender wife. It is impossible to express
the beauties of her mind or the loveliness
of her person; she had the greatest in-
fluence over my conduct and character;
she was the spirit of all my affairs, and
the centre of my enterprises :--when she
was gone I seemed like a ship without a
pilot, my country delights became as in~
sipid and dull as music and science to
those who have neither taste ~nor ingenuity.
In short, I left my farm, and in a few
months returned to London.--Bul that
great city, so famous for its variety of en-
tertainment, could afi'ord me no delight.
It was now the beginning of the year 1694,
at which time my nephew, who was re-
turned from a short voyage to Bilboa,
came to me one morning, telling me, that
some merchants of his acquaintance had
proposed to him to go a voyage for them
to the East Indies and China, in the man-
ner of private traders; " and now, uncle,"
said he, " if you'll accompany me thither,
I'll engage to land you upon your own
island, to see the state of your little
kingdom."

Just before he came in, my thoughts
were fixed to get a patent for its posses-
sion, and then to fill it with inhabitants.
After I hail paused a while, and looked

S
steadfastly on him, " What spirit," said I,
'-' sent you with this unlucky errand?"
He started at first; but recovering him-
self, when he perceived I was not offended,
" Sir," replied he, " what I have pro-
posed cannot, I hope, be styled unlucky,
since certainly you must be desirous to
see your little territory, where you reign-
ed with more content than any of your
brother kings in the universe."----I was not
long in forming my resolution, which over--
swayed my good friend, the widow's per-
suasions and the natural affection I bore
my young children. I made my will, and
settled my estate in such a manner, that
I was perfectly sure my poor infants would
have justice done them. The good widow
not only undertook to make provision for
my voyage, but also took charge of my
domestic affairs, and to provide for my
children's education; and indeed no mo--
ther could take more care, or understandor ROBINSON-03138015. 207

the ollice better; for which I lived to re--
ward and return her my hearty thanks.
The beginning of January, 1694--5, my
nephew being ready to sail, I and Friday
went on board in the Downs on the 8th,
having, besides a framed sloop ready to
be set up in the island, a very considerable
cargo for my new colony. I had servants,
whom I proposed to leave there, if they
should appear willing; two carpenters, a
smith, and a very ingenious fellow who
was Jack-of-all--trades; for he was not
only a cooper by trade, but was also dex-
terous at making wheels, and hand-mills
to grind corn, likewise a good turner, and
a good pot maker. I also carried a tailor,
who consented to stay in my plantation,
and proved a most useful fellow in the
island. My cargo consisted of a suflicient
quantity of linen, and English stuffs for
clothing the Spaniards that I expected to

find there; as likewise loves, hats, shoes,
3
S 2
stockings; together with beds, bedding,
and household stuff, especially kitchen
utensils, with pots, kettles, pewter, brass,
am; also nails, tools of all sorts, staples,
hooks, hinges, and all other things neces-
sary; which, I thEnk, cost me about three
hundred pounds. Nor was this all; for
I carried a hundred spare arms, muskets,
and fusees, besides some pistols, a con-
siderahle Quantity of several sorts of shot,
two brass cannon, besides swords, eut-
lasses, and the iron part of some pikes
and halherts.

Well, we put out to sea; and though I
can't say this voyage was so unprosperous
as my others had been, yet contrary winds
drove us so far northward, that we were
obliged to put in at Galway, in Ireland,
where we lay windJsound two and twenty
days. Here, indeed, provisions were very
cheap, and we added to our ship's stores
by taking several live hogs, two cows and
calves, which I resolved to put on shore in
my island, if our necessities did not call
for them. On the 5th of February we
sailed from Ireland, with a very fair gale,
which lasted for some days; and I think
it was about the 20th of the same month,
late in the evening, when the mate in-
formed us, that he saw a flash of fire, and
heard a gun fired; and when he was speak-
ing, a boy came in and told us, that the
boatswain had heard another. Upon which
we all ran to the quarter deck, from whence,
in a few moments, we perceived a terrible
fire at a distance. We had immediately

recourse to our reckonings, in which we
were all of opinion, that there could be
no land that way, it appearing to be at
N. N. W. We concluded that some ship
had taken fire at sea, and that it could
not be far off, by the report of the guns
which we had heard. We made up di-

rectly to it, and in half an hourfs time,
58
the wind being fair, we could plainly per-
ceive a great ship on fire in the middle
of the sea.--Touched with this unhappy
disaster, and considering my former cir-
cumstances, when the Portuguese Captain
took me up, I immediately ordered five
guns to be fired, that the poor creatures,
not seeing us, it being dark, (though we
could perceive their flame,) might be sen-
sible there was deliverance at hand, and
consequently might endeavour to save
themselves in their boat. Nor was it long
before the ship blew up in the air, and
the fire was extinguished in the ocean.
But supposing them to be all in their boats,
we hung out our lanterns, and kept firing
till eight o'clock in the morning; when,
with our perspectives, we beheld two boats
full of people, making towards us, though
the tide was against them: then spreading
out our ancient, and hanging out a waft,

as a signal for them to come on board, in
half an hour's time we came up with them,
and took them all in, there being no less
than sixty-four men, women, and children.
It was a French merchant ship of three
hundred tons, homeward bound from Que-
bec, in the river Canada.-----The master in-
formed me how, by the negligence of the
steersman, the steerage was set on fire:
that, at his outcry for help, the fire was,
as he thought. totally extinguished: but
that some sparks getting between the tim-
ber and within the ceiling, it proceeded
into the hold, where there was no resisting
it; and tic-en they got into their boats, as
creatures in the last extremity, with what
provisions they had, together with oars,
sails, and a compass, intending to go back
to Newfoundland, the wind blowing at S,
E, by E. though there were several chances
against them; but, said he, in this our
great distress, we heard the welcome re-
port ofyour guns, when with unspeakable.
joy, taking down our masts and sails, we
were resolved to lie by till morning; but
perceiving your light, we set our oars at
work, to keep our boat a-head, the sooner
to attain your ship, the happy instrument
of our deliverance. '

Indeed no one can express the joy of
these poor creatures on this occasion.
The behaviour of a young priest was- very
remarkable. At his entrance on board the
ship, he fell on his face in the most humble
prostration to the Almighty. I thought
he had fallen into a swoon, and ran to help
him up; but he modestly told me, he was
returning thanks to the Almighty, desiring
me to leave him a few moments, and that,
next to his Creator, he would return me
thanks also. And indeed he did so, about
three minutes after, with great seriousness
and affection, while the tears stood in his
eyes, which convinced me of the gratitude
of his soul. The next day the Captain
and Priest desired to speak with me and
my nephew the commander. They told
us, they had saved some money and valu-
able things out of the ruined vessel, which
was at our service; only that they desired
to be set on shore some where in our way.
At first my nephew was for accepting the
.money; but I (who knew how hard my
case would have been, had the Portuguese
Captain served me so) persuaded him to
the contrary; and therefore told them,
that we had done nothing but what we
were obliged to do, by nature and hu-
manity, and what we ourselves might ex-
pect from others in such calamity, we took
them up to save, not plunder them, and
therefore would not accept their moneys
but as to landing them, that was a great
difficulty; for being bound to the East
Indies, it was impossible to changeour
voyage upon their account, nor could my
nephew answer it to the freighters'.-----All
that we Could do, was to put ourselves in

the way of meeting some ships homeward
bound from the West Indies, that if pos-
sible, they might get a passage to France
or England. Indeed, they were very
thankful for our first kindness; but were
under great concern, especially the pas-
sengers, at being carried to the East In-
dies. They begged, therefore, I would
keep on the banks of Newfoundland, where
probably they might meet with some ship
or sloop to carry them to Canada, whence
they came. As this was but a reasonable
request, I was inclined to grant it, and,
as it happened, in a week's time we made
the banks of Newfoundland, where the
French people hired a bark to carry them
to France. But the Priest being desirous
to go to the East Indies, l readily agreed
to it, because I liked his conversation, and
two or three of the French sailors also
entered themselves on board our ship.
Now, directing our course for the West
Indies, another adventure happened to
exercise our humanity. In the latitude
. of 27 degrees, 5 minutes north, the 19th
of March, 1694-5, we perceived a sail,
which bore upon us, and then she ap-
peared to be a large vessel, having lost
her main topmast and boltsprit; when,
firing a gun as a signal of distress, we
soon came to speak with her. She was a
ship from Bristol, bound home from Bar-
badoes, out of which road she had been
forced in a hurricane to the westward, in
which they lost their masts.

In this ship were passengers, a youth,
his mother, and a maid-servant, who were
in a most deplorable condition for want
of food. If I had not gone on board their
ship, the'knowledge of their miserylhad
been concealed from me, and they would
have inevitably perished, though, indeed,
their second mate, who was captain, (the
true captain not being on board when the
hurricane happened,) had before informed
me that there were such persons on board,
whom be supposed to be dead, being
afraid to enquire after them, because he
had nothing to give them for relief. Here-
upon we resolved to let them have what
we could spare, ordering the mate to bring
some of his men on board, which he did
accordingly; he and they looked like skele-
tons; when meat was set before them I
ordered them to eat sparingly, When
they were fed, we ordered our mate to
carry them a sack of bread, and four or five
pieces of beef; but the surgeon charged
them to see it boiled, and keepa guard
on the cook-room, to prevent the men
from eating it raw, and consequently kil-
ling themselves with what was designed
for their relief. But, particularly, I de-
sired the mate to see what condition the
poor passengers were in, and the surgeon
gave him a pitcher of the same broth which
he had prepared for the men. And being
curious to see this scene of misery myself,
I took the Captain (as we called the mate
of the ship) in our own boat, and sailed
after them.

Here was a sad sight indeed! scarce were
the victuals half boiled in the pot, but they
were ready to break open the cook-room
door. To stay their stomachs, the mate
gave them biscuits, which were dipped and
softened with the liquor of the meat, which
they call bruise; telling them it was for
their own safety, that he was obliged to
give them but a little at a time; and so
feeding them gradually, the men did very
well again. But when they came to the
poor gentlewoman in the cabin, who for
several days had continued without food,
giving what she had to her son, they found
her in the arms of death. She was sitting

upon the floor of the deck, with her back
T
against the sides, between two chairs,
which were lashed fast, and her head shrunk
between her shoulders, like a senseless
corpse. Nothing was wanting in my mate
to revive and encourage her; opening her
lips, and putting some broth into her
mouth with a spoon. But not having
strength to speak, she lifted up her head
with much difficulty, intimating that it was
now too late; at the same time pointng to
the youth, her son, as though she desired
him to do what he could to save the lad;
and, in a little time after, she died.
The youth, indeed, was not so far gone,
T p1lay stretched out on the cabin bed, like
one that had scarce any life. In his mouth
was a piece of an old glove, the rest of
which he had ate up. At first he vomited
what the mate had given him; but at length
began sensibly to revive, though in the
greatest concern for the death of his tender-
mother.
As to the poor maid, she lay by her
mistress, like one in the last pangs of
death: her limbs were distorted, one of
her hands was clasped round the frame of
a chair, which she grasped so hard, that
it was with some dilficulty we separated
her from it; her other arm lay over her
head, and her feet lay both together, set
fast against the frame of the cabin table;
not only being starved with hunger, but
overcome with grief at the loss of her mis-
tress, whom she loved most tenderly. It
was a great while before the surgeon could
bring her to life, and a much longer time
before she came to her senses.

After we had sailed with them some days,
we sent them five barrels of beef, one of
pork, two hogsheads of biscuit, with peas,
flour, and other things; taking three casks
of ' sugar, some rum, and some pieces of
eight as payment, we left them, but took

the youth and maid with us, with all their
T 2
goods. The lad was about seventeen years
old, very handsome, modest, sensible, and
well-bred, but much grieved for the loss of
his mother, having lost his father at Bar-
badoes but a few months before. He be-
sought the surgeon to intercede with me
to take him out of the ship; for that the
sailors, by not sparing a small sustenance,
had starved his mother. But hunger has
no bounds, and consequently is incapable
of any compassion. When the surgeon told
him our voyage might put him in bad cir-
cumstances, and farther from his friends,
he said he did not care, if he was delivered
from that terrible crew; and as the Captain
(meaning me) had saved him from death,
so he was sure he would do him no harm;
and, as for the maid, when she was restored
to her senses, she would be no less thankful,
let us carry them where we would. And
indeed the surgeon so represented their
case to me, that I consented, and took
or ROBINSON cnvsoz. 221

them on board with all their goods. I had
great dilficulty in finding mylittle kingdom,
for as I came to, and went from it before,
on the south and east side of the island, as
coming from the Brazils, so now approach-
ing between the main and the island, not
having any chart of the coast, nor land
mark, it obliged me to go on shore on
several islands in the mouth of the river
Oroonoko, but to no purpose. Thus I
perceived, that what I thought was a con-
tinent before, was no such thing, but a
long island, or rather a ridge of sands. At
length I came fair on the south-side of my
island, and then I presently knew the
countenance of my little kingdom.

No sooner did I see the place, but calling
for Friday, I asked him where he was;
when he looked a little, he clapped his
hands, crying, " 0 joy, 0 there, 0 yes,
0 there!" pointing to our old abode, and

then began dancing and capering as if he
T 3
were mad, and I had much ado to keep
him from jumping into the sea, to swim
ashore. " Friday," said I, " what do you
think, shall we see your Father 'l" At the
mentioning his father's name, the poor affec-
tionate creature fell a weeping: " No, no,"
says he, " me see him no more, never see
poor father more! he long ago die, die long

'

ago; he much old man.' " You don't know
that," said I; " but shall we see any body
else'!" " He looks about, and pointing to
the hill above my house, cries out, "We

,

'see there much men and there;' which,
though I could not perceive them with my
perspective glass, was true, by what the
men themselves told me the next day.
When the English ancient was spread,
and three guns fired, as a signal of friend-
ship, we perceived a smoke rise from the
creek; upon which I ordered the boat out,
taking Friday with me, and hanging out a
white flag of truce, I went on shore, ac-
companied also by the young friar, to whom
I had related the history of the first part of
my life; besides, we had sixteen men well
armed, in case we had met with any oppo-
sition, '

After we had rowed directly into the
creek, the first man I fixed my eyes upon
was the Spaniard, whose life I had saved,
and whose face I perfectly well knew. I
ordered them all to stay in the boat for a
while; but Friday, perceiving his father at
a distance, would have jumped into the
sea, had they not let the boat go. No
sooner was he on shore, but he flew like a
swift arrow out of a bow to embrace his
aged father. Certainly it would melt at
man of the 'firmest resolution into the
softest tears, to see with what uncommon
transports of joy he saluted him; he first
kissed him, then stroked his face, took him
in his arms, laid him under a shady tree,
sat down by him, then looked as earnestly
at him, as one would do at a picture, for a
quarter of an hour together. After this
he would lie upon the ground, stroke his
legs and kiss them, then get up and stare
at him, as though he was bewitched: but
the nextday one could not forbear laughing
to see his behaviour; for he would walk
several hours with his father along the
shore, leading him by the hand; while,
every now and then, he would run to the
boat to get something for him, as a lump
of sugar, dram, biscuit, or something or
other that was good. His frolics ran in
another channel in the afternoon; when he
set old Friday on the ground, he would
dance round him, making comical postures
and gestures; and all the while telling him
one story or another of his travels and
adventures.

It was on the 10th of April, 1695, that
I set my foot upon the island a second time.
When my faithful Spaniard, accompanied
by one more, approached the boat, he little
knew who I was, till I discovered myself
to him. " Seignior," said I, in Portuguese,
"don't you know me'!" He spoke not a
word, but giving his musket to his attend-
ant, extended his arms, and saying some-
thing in Spanish that I did not understand,
he came forward and embraced me, saying,
he was inexcusable not to know his de-
liverer, who, like an angel sent from heaven,
had saved his life. He then beckoned to
the men to call out his companions; asked
me if I would walk to my own habitation,
and take possession, where I should find
some mean improvements: but, indeed
they were extraordinary ones; for they had
planted trees so close together, that the
place was like a labyrinth, which none
could find out except themselves, who knew
its intricate windings. I asked him the
meaning of all these fortifications? In an-
swer to this question, he gave me a minute
account of all that had taken place during
my absence, from which I found they had
been so much alarmed by the repeated visits
of the neighbouring savages, that they had
found it necessary to adopt every possible
means of self-defence; on which account
they had planted those trees, whose rapid
growth had formed the fortifications which
had created in me so much surprise. I
found they had had many fierce encounters
with the savages, some of whom they had
taken prisoners, and by kind treatment had
so far gained their love and confidence,
that they had become naturalized among
them, and their savage habits much sub-
dued; the Englishman that had remained
on the island after my departure, had also,
by their obstinacy and insubordination,
given them much trouble; but they had
also returned to their allegiance, and all,
at the time of my arrival, were in the en-
joyment of peace and comfort, some few
Were married to the female savages they
had rescued from the hands of their de-
vouring enemies, so that the appearance of
my little colony was much changed in my
nine years absence.

After my faithful Spaniard had concluded
his account, I told him I was come to es-
tablish, and not to remove them; and upon
that occasion, had not only brought them
necessaries for convenience and defence,
but also artificers, and other persons, both
for the necessary employments, and to add
to their number. They were all together
when I thus talked to them and before I
delivered the stores I brought, I asked them
one by one, if they had entirely forgot
their first animosities, would engage in the
strictest friendship, and shake hands with
one another? On this Will Atkins, who had
been the most troublesome among the Eu-
gliShmen, with abundance of good humour,
said, they had had afflictions enough to
make them all sober, and enemies enough
to make them all friends: as for himself he
would live and die among them.

After these kind declarations of friend-
ship, we appointed all to dine together the
next day; upon this I caused the ship's
cook and his mate to come on shore, to
assist in dressing our dinner. We brought
from the ship six pieces of beef, and four
of pork, together with our punch-bowl,
and materials to fill it; and in particular
I gave them ten bottles of French claret,
and ten of English beer, which was very
acceptable to them. The Spaniards added
to our feast five whole kids, which being
roasted, three of them were sent as fresh
meat to the sailors on board, and the other
two we ate ourselves. After our merry
and innocent feast was over, I began to
distribute my cargo among them. First,
I gave them linen sufficient to make every
one of them four shirts. The thin English
stuff I allotted to make every one a light
coat like a frock, agreeable to the climate,
and left them such a quantity as to make
up more on their decay: as also pumps,
shoes, hats and stockings. It is not to be
expressed the pleasing satisfaction which
sat upon the countenances of these poor
men, when they perceived what care I took
of them, as if I had been a common father
to them all; and they all engaged never to
leave the island, till I gave my consent for
their departure. I then presented to them
the people I brought, viz. the tailor,
smith, and the two carpenters. My tailor
fell immediately to work, and made every
one of them a shirt, after which, he learned
the women how to sew and stich, thereby
to become more useful to their husbands.
Neither were the carpenters less valuable,
taking in pieces their clumsy things; in-
stead of which they made convenient and

handsome tables, stools, bedsteads, cup-
U
boards, lockers, and shelves.--To every
man I gaVe a spade, a shovel, and a rake;
and to every separate place a pickaxe, a
crow, a broad axe, and a saw, with a
store for a general supply, should any be
broken or worn out. I left them also
nails, staples, hinges, hammers, chisels,
knives, scissors, and all sorts of tools
and iron work; and for the use of the
smith, gave them three tons of unwrought
iron, for a supply; and as to arms and
ammunition, I stored them even to pro-
fusion.

The young man (whose mother was un-
fortunately starved to death) together with
the maid, a pious and well-educated young
woman, seeing things so well ordered on
shore, and considering they had no oc-
casion to go so far a voyage as to the
East Indies, both desired of me, that I
would leave them there, and enter them
among my subjects. This I readily agreed
to, ordering them a plat of ground, on
which were three little houses erected.
So contrived were their tents, that each
of them had a room apart to lodge in,
while their middle tent was not only their
store--house, but their place for eating and
drinking. "

The affairs of the island being settled,
I began to think seriously of taking my
final leave of its inhabitants, and returning
to my native country, leaving them in a
flourishing condition, with a promise to
send them further relief from the Brazils, as
sheep, hogs, and cows; I went on board
the ship again the first of May, 1695,
after having been twenty days among
them; and next morning, giving them a
_ salute of five guns at parting, we set sail
for the Brazils. The third day, towards
evening, there happening a calm, and the
current being very strong, we were driven

to the N. N. E. towards the land. Some
U 52
hours after we perceived the sea covered
as it were with something;r very black, not
easiiy at first to be discovered: upon
which our chiefmate ascending the shrouds
a little way, and taking: : new with the
perspective glass, he cries out, " Au army !
an army!" " You fool," said I, "what
do you mean '2" " Nay, Sir," said he,
" don't be angry, I assure you it is not
only an army, but a fleet too, for l believe
there are a thousand canoes paddling along
and making With great haste towards us."

Indeed may one of us m-s'c surprised
at this relation; and my nephew, the
captain, could not tell what to think'ofit,
but thought we should ail be devoured.
Nor was I free from concern, when I con-
sidered how much we were bee-aimed, and
what a strong current set towards the
shore; however, [encouraged him not to
be afraid, but bring the ship to an anchor,
as soon as we were certain that we must
engage them. Accordingly we did so,
and flll'letl all our sails; as to the savages
we feared nothing, except that they might
Set the ship on fire; to prevent which, I
ordered them to get their boats out, and
and fasten them one close by the head,
and another by the stern, well manned,
with sheets and buckets to extinguish the
flames, should it so happen. The savages
Suon came up with us, but there was not
so many as the mate had said, for instead
of a thousand canoes there were only one
hundred and twenty; too many indeed for
us, several of their canoes containing about
sixteen or seventeen men.

As they approached'us, they seemed to
be in the greatest amazement, not knowing
what to make of us. They rowed round

'the ship, which occasioned us to call to
the men in the boats not to suffer them to
come near them. Hereupon they beckoned

to the savages to keep back, which they
U3
accordingly did; but at their retreat they
let fly about fifty arrows among us, and
very much. wounded one of our men in
the long-boat. I called to them not to
fire upon any account, but handing them-
down some deal boards, the carpenters
made them a kind of fence to shield them
from the arrows. In half an hour after
they came so near astern of us, that we
had a perfect sight of them; then they
rowed a little further out, till they came
directly along-side of us, and then ap-
proached so near, that they could hear us
speak; this made me order all my men to
keep close, and get their guns ready. In
the mean time I ordered Friday to go out
upon deck, and ask them in his language
what they meant. He immediately cried

out they were going to shoot; unfortu- (
nately for him, poor creature, who fell
under the cloud of three hundred arrows,
no less than seven piercing through his
body, killing one of the best servants, and
most faithful of companions in all my soli-
tude and afllictions.

So enraged was I at the death of poor
Friday, that the guns, which before were
charged only with powder, to frighten
them, I ordered to be loaded with small
shot; nor did the gunners fail in their aim,
but at this broadside split and overset
thirteen or fourteen of their canoes, which
killed numbers of them and set the rest
swimming: the others, frightened out of
their wits, little regarding their fellows
drowning, scoured away as fast as they
could. One poor wretch our people took
up, swimming for his life an hour after.--
He was very sullen at first, so that he
would neither eat nor speak; but I took
a way to cure him, by ordering them to
throw him into the sea, which they did, '
and then he came swimming back like a
cork, calling in his tongue, as I suppose,
to save him. So we took him on board,
but was a long time before we could make
him speak or understand English: yet
when we had taught him, he told us, they
were going with their kings to fight a great
battle; and when we asked him, what
made them come up to us? he said, "to
makee de great wonder look;" here it is
to be noted, that those natives, and those
of Africa, always add two e's at the end
of English words, as makee, takee, and the

like, which it is a very difficult thing to
make them break off.

Being now under sail, we took our last
farewell of poor honest Friday, and in-
terred him with all possible decency and
solemnity, putting him in a coffin, and corn-
mining him to the deep, at the same time'
causing eleven guns to be fired over him.
Thus ended the life of one of the most
grateful, faithful, honest, and affectionate.
servant, that ever any man was blessed
with in the world.

In our passage, we touched at the island
of Madagascar, where, though the inha-
bitants are naturally fierce and treacherous,
and go constantly armed with bows and
lances, yet for some time they treated us
civilly enough; and, in exchange for knives
scissors, and other [rifles they brought us
eleven good fat bullocks, which we took
partly for present victuals, and the re-
mainder to salt for the ship's use. But in
consequence of the rude conduct of one of
our sailors, this friendly disposition was
changed into malice and revenge; the in-
habitants attacked the ofi'ending sailor,
killed him, and hung him on a tree as an
example to the rest, which so enraged his
companions, that they fell upon them,
burnt their dwellings, and massacred them
without regard to age or sex.
I was extremely angry with every one of
them, but particularly with the captain,
who, instead of cooling the rage of his
men, had prompted them on to further
mischief; nor could he make me any other
excuse, but that as he was a man, he could
not master his passions at the sight of one
of his men so cruelly murdered. As for
the rest, knowing they were not under
my command, they took no notice of my
anger, but rather boasted of their revenge.
According to all their accounts, they
killed or destroyed about one hundred
and fifty men, women, and children, be-
sides burning the town to ashes. They
took their companion, Tom Jeffery, from
the tree, covered him with some of the
ruins, and so left him. But however this
action of our men might seem to them jus-
tifiable, yet I always openly condemned it
with the appellation of the Massacre of
Madagascar.
While we were under sail, the boatswain
would often defend his bloody action, by
saying, that the Indians had broke the
truce the night before, by shooting one of
our men without just provocation: and
what if the poor fellow had conducted him-
self a little improperly, he ought not to
have been murdered in so villanous a man-
ner; and that they had acted nothing but
what the divine laws commissioned to be
done to such homicides. However I was
in the same mind as before, telling them
that they were murderers, and bid them
depend upon it that God would blast their
voyage, for such an unparallelled piece
of barbarity.

When we came to the Gulph of Persia,
five of our men, who ventured on shore,
were either killed or made slaves by the
Arabians, the rest of them having scarce
time to escape to their boat. This made
me upbraid them afresh with the retribu-
tion of Heaven for such actions; upon
which the boatswain very warmly asked
me, "Whether those men on whom the
tower of Siloam fell, were greater sinners
than the rest of the Galileans'! and be--
sides, Sir," said he, "none of these five
poor men that are lost were with us at the
Massacre of Madagascar, as you call it,
and therefore your representations are very
unjust, and your application improper.
Besides," added he, " you are continually
using the men very ill upon this account,
and, being but a passenger yourself, we
are not obliged to bear it; nor can we tell
what evil designs you may have to bring
us to judgment for it in England; and,
therefore, if you do not leave this dis-
course, as also not concern yourself with
any of our affairs, I will leave the ship,
and not sail among such dangerous com-
pany."-----All this I heard very patiently;
but, it being often repeated, I at length
told him, the concern I had on board was
none of his business; that I was a consi-
derable emarr m the ship, and therefore
had a right '10 speak in common, and that
I was no my accountable to him, nor any
body e!se. As no more passed for some
time after, ! thought all had been over.
At this time we were in the road of Bengal,
where, gomg on shore with the supercargo
one day in the evening, as I was pre-
paring to go on board, one of the men
came to me, and told' me, I need not tron-
ble myself to come to the boat, for that
the cockswain and others had ordered him
not to carry me on board any more. This
insole'nt message much surprised me, yet
I gave him no answer to it, but went di-
rectly and acquainted the supercargo, en-
'treating him to go on board, and, by
acquainting the Captain-with it, to pre-
vent the mutiny which I perceived would

happen. But before I had spoken this,
X .
the matter was effected on board; for no
sooner was he gone of in the boat, but
the boatswain, gunner, carpenter, and all
the inferior oflicers, came to the quarter-
deck, desiring to speak with the Captain;
and there the boatswain made a long
harangue, exclaiming against me, as be-
fore mentioned, that if I had not gone on
shore peaceably for my own diversion,
they, by violence, would have compelled
me, for their satisfaction: that .as they
had shipped with the Captain, so they
would faithfully serve him: but if I: did
not quit the ship, or the Captain oblige
me to it, they would leave the ship im-
mediately: hereupou, turning his face
about, by way of signal, they all cried
out, "ONE AND ALL! ONE AND ALL!
You may be sure, that though my nephew '
was a man of great courage, yet he could
as: but be surprised at their sudden and
unexpected behaviour; and though he
talked stoutly to them, and afterwards ex-
postulated with them, that in common
justice to me, who was a considerable
owner in the ship, they could not turn me,
as it were, out of my oWn house, which
might. bring their lives in danger should
they ever be taken in England; nay, though
he invited the boatswain on shore to ac-
commodate matters with me, yet all this
signified nothing; they would have nothing
to do with me; and they were resolved to
go on shore if I came on board. " Well,"
said my nephew, "if you are so resolved,
permit me to talk with him, and then I
have done;" so he came to me, giving me
an account of their resolution, how one
and all designed to forsake the ship when
I came on board, for which he was greatly
concerned. "I am glad to see you nephew,"
said I, "and rejoice it is no worse, since
they have not rebelled against you; [only

desire you to send my necessary things on
X 2
shore, with a sufficient sum of money, and
I will find my way to England as well as
I can." Though this grieved my nephew
to the heart, yet there was no remedy but
compliance: in short, all my necessaries
were sent to me, and so this matter was
over in a few hours.

I think I was now near a thousand leagues
farther off England by sea, than at my
little kingdom--My nephew left me two
persons to attend me; one of them was
his servant, and the other clerk to the
purser, who engaged to be mine. I took
lodgings in an English woman's house.
The handsome entertainment I met with
here, occasioned me to stay nine months,
considering what course I should take.--
Some English goods I had with me of great
value, besides a thousand pieces of eight.
The goods I soon disposed of to advantage,
and bought here several good diamonds,
which I could easily carry about with me.
One morning an English merchant, with
whom I was very intimate, came to me,
" Countryman," said he, "I have a project
to communicate to you, which I hope will
suit to both our advantage. If you will
put a thousand pounds to my thousand
pounds, we will hire a ship, you shall be
Captain, I will be merchant; and we'll go
a trading voyage to China, for why should
we lie still like drones, while the whole
world is in continual motion."

This proposal was very agreeable to my
rambling genius ; but it required some time
before we could get a vessel to our mind,
and sailors to man it; at length we bought
a ship, and got an English mate, boatswain,
and gunner, a Dutch carpenter, and three
. Portuguese foremast--men ; and for want of
others made shift with Indian seamen. We
went up to Suskan, making a great voyage,
and, after 8 months time, I returned to Ben-
gal, very well satisfied with lhis adventure;
The next voyage my friend proposed to
me, was to go among the Spice islands,
and bring home a load of cloves from the
Manillas, islands belonging partly to Spain,
but where the Dutch trade very consi-
derably. We were not long in preparing
for this voyage, which we made no less
successful than the last, touching at Borneo,
and ~several other places which I do not
perfectly remember, and returned home
in about five months time. We soon sold
our spices, which were chiefly cloves and
some nutmegs, to the Persian merchants,
who carried them away to the Gulph, and
were loaded with money.

After a very great variety of adventures,
which prolonged my journey to a year,
five months, and three days, I reached
once more my native land in safety, cured '
of my rambling inclinations, and only de-
sirous to end my days in peace.

THE END.
