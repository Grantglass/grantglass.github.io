The Publisher of this splendid Edition of
Robinson Crusoe has often experienced
the most liberal encouragement for works
whichr being large* might seem hazardous
for an individual; but on no occasion has
he been honoured and assisted by a Sub-
scription more adequate to the greatness of
his expenses, or more encouraging to the
activity of his future endeavours.,—He begs
leave to return his sincere thanks; and he
will only add, that his gratitude for such re-
peated favours will continue through life.

PREFACE.
If ever the story of any private man's adven-
tures in the world were worth making pub-
jie, and were acceptable when published, the
Editor of this account thinks this will be so#
The wonders of this man's life exceed all
that (he thinks) is to be found extant; the
life of one man being scarce capable of a
greater variety.
The story is told with modesty, with se-
riousness, and with a religious application of
events to the uses to whiph wise men always
apply them; viz. to the instruction of others*
by this example, j &n$ tQ, justify and honour
the wisdona <*f Providence in all thfe varifety
of circumstances, let them happen how they
will.
The Editor believes the thing to be a just
history of facts; neither is there any appear-
ance of fiction in it: and however thinks, be-
cause all such things are disputed, that the
improvement of it, as well to the diversion,
as to the instruction of the Reader, will be
the same; and as such, he thinks, without
further compliment to the world,. he does*
them a great service in the publication.
THE
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
OF
ROBINSON CRUSOE,
I was born in the year 1632, in the city of York,
f>f a good family, though not of that country, my
fether being a foreigner of Bremen, who settled
first at Hull: he got a good estate by merchandize,
tad leaving off his trade, lived afterward at York;
from whence he had married my mother, whose
Rations were named Robinson, a very good family
in that country, and from whom I was called
Robinson Kreutenaer; but by the usual corruption
ff words in England, we are now called, nay we
call ourselves^ and write our name Crusoe, and so
fny companions always called me.
I had tw© -elder brothers, one of which was lieu-
tenant colonel to an English regiment of foot in
fiaiwlers* formerly eomimnded by the famous colo-
B
nel Lockhart, and.was killed at the battle near Dun-
kirk against th$ Spaniards; what became of my
second brother j never knew, any more than my
father or mother did know what was become of me.
Being the third son of the family, and not bred
to any trade, my head began to be filled very early
with rambling thoughts: my father, who was very
ancient, had given me a competent share of learning,
as far as house education, and a country free-school
generally goes, and designed me for the law; but I
would be satisfied with nothing but going to sea;
and my inclination to this led me so strongly against
the will, nay the commands of my father, and
against all the entreaties and persuasions of my
mother and other friends, that there seemed to be
something fatal in that prppension of nature tending
directly to the life of misery which was to befal me.
\ My father, a vyise and grave man, gave me serious
and excellent counsel against what he foresaw was
ipy design. HeN called me one morning into hii
chamber, where he was confined by the gout, and
expostulated very warmly with me upon this sub-
ject: he asked me what reasons more than a merfe
wandering inclination I had for leaving my father's
house and my native country, where I might be
well introduced, and hg,d apvpspeqt of raising my
fortune by application anct industry, with a life of
ease and pleasure. H$ tpld.me it was for men of
desperate fortunes opsone hand,, or o£ ^spiring sv^
perior fortunes on the other, \vho we^tabrpaxl upon
adventures, to rise by enterprise, and; make them-
selves famous in midertakingSi of a> n<Mtijfje. opt of
tfre pominpn rpacl; th^t the^vtti»g§'W.ere^ll eithef
too far-above me, or too far Below me/ that mine
w$s the middle state, or what might be catted the
upper station of low life, which he had found by
long experience was the best state in the world,'the
most suited to human happiness, not exposed to the
miseries and hardships, the labour and sufferings
of the mechanic part of mankind, and riot embar-
rassed with the pride, luxury, ambition, and envy
of the upper part of mankind. He told me, I might
judge jof thfc happiness of this state, by this one
thing, viz. That this was the state of life which all
other people envied; that Kings have frequently
lamented the miserable consequences of being born
to great things, and wish they had been placed ill
the middle of the two extremes, between the mean
and the great; that the wise man gave his testi-
mony to this as the just standard of true felicity
when he prayed to have neither poverty or riches.
He bid me observe it, and I should always find,
that the calamities of life were shared among the
upper and lower part of mankind; but that the mid-
dle station had the fewest disasters, arid was not
exposed to so many Vi'cissiiudes as the higher or
lower part of mankind; riay, tliey were not sub-
jected^ to so many disteirif>ers and uneasinesses
either of body or riiiiuf, as those were, who by
vicious living, luxury, and extravagancies on one
K&hd, or by hard labour, want of necessaries, and
«M& or insufficient d ietf on the other hand, bring
(M&kiripgis^jkki themselves by the natural conse-

were theuhafidma^ds of iat^diddle .fortune; that
temperance; ^^eritbiivr<?^etness, health, society,
all agreeable diversions, and ail desirable pleasures,
were the blessings attending the middle station of
life;: that this way men went silently and smoothly
through the world, and comfortably out of it, not
embarrassed with the labours of the hands or of
the head, not sold to the life of slavery for daily
bread, or harassed with perplexed circumstances,
which rob the soul of peace, and the body of rest;
not engaged with the passion of envy, or secret
burning lust of ambition for great things; but in
easy circumstances sliding gently through the
world, and sensibly tasting the sweets of living,
without the bitter, feeling that they are,happy, and
karnAngr by!every day's: experience to know it
more sensibly, ; o . . :
After *this, he ^pressed me earnestly, and in the
most affectionate manner, not to play the young
man, not to precipitate myself into miseries which
nature and the station of life I was born in seemed
to have;provided agaki&tjotfeat I was under no ne-
cessity of seeking ^myr bread j^^ he would do
well for me, and endeavour to enter me fairly into
the station of life which,;he<had been just recom-
mending to me; and that if I was not very easy
and happy in the ,woitld> it must be my merefate
or fault that must hinder it, and that he jsh&uld
have nothing to answer for* having thus^discharged
his duty in warning me against measures! which
he knew would be to my hurt: in a'word, that>as
he would do very kind things for me if I wofcld
stay and settle at home as he directed; soikBiwould
fcofc have so much hand in my misfcrtime*, as to
give me any encouragement to goaway?;&nd -±o
eiose all, he told me I had my elden brother for an
example, to whom he had used the same earnest
persuasions to keep him from going into the low
country wars, but could not prevail, his, yopng de-
sires prompting him to run into the army, whese
he was killed; and though he said he would not
cease to pray for me, yet he would venture to say
to me, that if I did take this foolish step, God
would not bless me, and I would have leisure here-
after to reflect upon having neglected his. counsel
when there might be none to assist in nrpsc-
covery.
I observed in this last part of his discourse,
which was truly prophetic, though? I suppose <ray
father did not know it to be so hiraseifjrl say^ I
observed the tears run down-hisfacerveryspienti-
fully, and especially when he spoke of ray ^brother
who was killed; and that wheji he spoke of my
having leisure t© repent, ar d none to assistmie^he
was so moved, that be brokeiqff th& discourse, and
told me, his: heart cwas J so £\xUf he * could say no
more to me.

^However, iadid>kiote>arit to hastily neither as my
tfir^btott»of msniutioiE pfompted> but I took my
mother, at a time when:-I thought h'er a little plea-*
santer than ordinary, a!nd tokl her, thatmy thoughts
were so entirely bent upon seeing the Nortel, that
I should never settle to any thiftg With resolution
enough to go through with it, and my father had
better give me his consent than force me to go
without it; that I was now eighteen years old,
which was too late to go apprentice to a trade, or
clerk to an attorney; that I was sure, if I did, I
should never servre out my time, and I should cer-
tainly run away from my master before my time
was out, and go to sea; and if she would speak to
my father to let me go one voyage abroad, if I
came home again and did not like it, I would go
no more, and I would promise by a double dili-
gence to recover that time I had lost,
This put rny mother into a great passion: she
told me, she knew it would be to no purpose to
speak to my father upon any such subject; that he
knew too well what was my interest to give his
consent to any such thing so much for my hurt,
and .that she wondered how*I could* think of any
such thiiig after such a^disdoursfe as I had had with
my father, and such kind 'and tender expressions
as she knew my father hiad used to me; and that,
in .short, if 1^ would ruin mysdf,: there was no help
for me; but I might depend I should never have
their consent to it: that> for her part she would
not have so much hand> in my destruction; and I
should never have it to say, that my mother was
willing when my father was*not. ' ^
.Though my mother refused to;-mote, it ta*mty
father, yet, as I have heard afterwards, she reported

s?gh* "That boy might he happy if he would stay
at.hojj&e, b»ut if he goes abroad, he will be the most
i^seralfle wretch that was ever born; I can give
no consent to it."
It was not till almost a year after this that I
brpke loose, though in the mean -time I continued
obstinately deaf to all proposals of settling to busi-
ness, and frequently expostulating with my father
aiu;l mother about their being sp positively deter-
rtiip§$ ^gainst what they knew my inclinations
prompted me to. But being pne day at Hull, where

I began now seriously to reflect upon what I had
done, and how justly I was overtaken by the judg-
ment of Heaven for my wicked leaving tny father's
house, and abandoning my duty; all the good
counsel of my parents, my father's tears and ftijr
mother's entreaties came now fresh into my mind,
and my conscience, which was not yet come to the
pitch of hardness to which it has been since, re-
proached me with the contempt of advice, and thfc
breach of my duty to God and my father.
AH this while the storm increased, amtthe s£&,
which I had neter been upon before, went very
high, though hothing like what I have seen many
times since; no, nor like whaft I saw a few days
after: but it was enough to afftet me then, who
#a;s but a young sailor, arid had never known any-
thing of the matter. I expebted every wiave WotiM
h&tik swallowed us up, and that every tihre the'shtp
felf down, as I thought, in thfe trough or hollfc>&
of the sea, we should tieVei* Wse hiore; and indite

troubles on shore; and I resolved that 1 would,
like a true repenting prodigal, go home to my
father.
These wise and sober thoughts continued all the
while the storm continued, and indeed some time
after; but the next day the^iud was abated and
the sea calmer, and I began to be a little inured to
it: however I was very grave for all that day, being
also a little sea-sick still; but towards night the
weather cleared up, the wind was quite over, and
a charming fine evening followed; the sun went
^down perfectly clear, and rose so the next morn-
ing; and having little or no wind,, and a smooth
sea, the sun shining upon it, the sight was, as I
thought, the most delightful that ever I saw.
I had slept well in the night, and was now no
mw .sea-sick, but very cheerful, looking with
wonder upon the sea that was so j-ough and terrible
the day before, and could be so calm and so plea*
sant in so little time after. And now, lest my
good resolutions should continue, my companion,
who had indeed inticedme^way, comes to me,
Well, Bob, says he, (chapping me upon the shoujr
der,) how do you jio *ift$r it? I warrant you were

the -punch* was* imade,; and I wastiiatde diunk with
it, and in that;one night's 'wickednessI dr6wiied
all my repentance, all my reflections upon my past
conduct, and all my resolutions for my future. In
a; word, as the sea was returned to its smoothness
of surface and settled calmness by the abatement
of that storm, so the hurry of my thoughts being
over, my fears and apprehensions of being swal-
lowed up by the sea being* forgotten, and the cur*
rent of my former desires returned, I entirely for-
got the ?row5>and promises that I made in my dis-
tress^ Ifomud indeed some intervals of reflection*
and. the serious thoughts did, as it were, endeavour
to. retdm again sometimes, but I shook thern £>ff,
and roused myself from them as it were from a
distemper, ^and applying myself to drinking arid
company, soon mastered the return of those fits,
for so I called them, and I had in five or six days
got as complete a victory over conscience ai any
young fellow* that resolved;not to be troubled With

contrary, viz. at south-west; for seven or eight
days, during which time a great many ships from
Newcastle came into the same roads> as the com-
mon harbour where the ships might wait for a
wind for the river.
We had not however rid here so long, but should
have tided it up the river, but that the wind blew
too fresh; and after we had lain four or five days,
blew very hard. However the roads being reck-
oned as good as a harbour, the anchorage good,
and our ground-tackle very strong, our men were
unconcerned, and not in the least apprehensive of
danger, but spent the time in rest and mirth, after
the manner of the sea; but the eighth day m the
morning, the wind increased, and we had all hands
at work to strike our top-masts, and make every
thing snug and close, that the ship might ride as
easy as possible. By noon the sea went very high
indeed, and our ship rid forecastle in, shipped seve-
ral seas, and we thought once or twice our anchor
had come home; upon which our master ordered
out the sheet anchor;-so that W£ rode with two
anchors a-head, and the cables veered out to the
better end.
By this time it blew a terrible storm indeed;
and now I began fcosee, tdrror and amazement in

miy cabin, Which was in the steerage, and eatinot
describe my temper: I could ill fdassume the first
penitence which I had so apparently trampled upon,
and hardened my self against: I thought the bitter-
ness of death had been past, and that this would
be nothing like the first. But when the master
himself came by me, as I said just now, and said
we should be all lost, I was dreadfully frighted: I
got up out of my cabin, and looked out; but such
a dismal sight I never saw: the sea went moun-
tains high, and broke upon us every three or four
minutes: when I could look about, I could see
nothing but distress round us : two ships that rid
near us, we found, had cut their masts by the board,
being deep loadeii; and our men cried out, that a
sjiip which rid about a mile a-head of us was foun-
dered. Two more ships being driven from their
anchors, were run out of the roads to sea, at all
adventures, and that with not a mast standing.
The light ships fared the best, as not so much la-
bouring in the sea; but two or three of them drove,
and came close by us* tunning away with only their
spritsail out before the wind.
Towards evening the mate and boatswain beg-
ged the master of Oiir ship to let them cut away
the fore-mast, #hich he Was vtery unwilling to do:
but the bGatswahi protesting to him, that if he did
not, the fchip WoiMdi foimder, he fconsented; and
when they hkd hat afaay the fore-ma&t, the main-
mast stood so loofce, and shook the ship so much*
they were obliged to cut her away ^iso, and make
a clear d£ck.
Any one may judge what a condition I must be
in at all this, who was but a young sailor, and who
bad bees, in such a fright before at but a little.
But if I can express at this distance the thoughts
I had about me at that time, I.was in tenfold more
horror of mind upon account of my former con-
victions, and the having returned from them to
the resolutions I had wickedly taken at first, than
I was at death itself; and these, added to the ter-
ror of the storm, put me in such a condition, that
I can by no words describe it. But the worst was
not come yet; the storm continued with such fury,
that the seamen themselves acknowledged they had
never known a worse. We had a good ship, but
she was deep loader^ and wallowed in.the sea, that
the seamen every now and then cried out, she
would founder, It was my advantage in one re-
spect, that I did not know what they meant by
founder, till I enquired. However, the storm was
so violent, that I saw, what is not often seen, the
master, the boatswain, and some others more sen-
sible than the rest, at their prayers, and expecting
every moment when the ship would go to the bot-
tom. In the middle,of the? night, and under all
the rest of our distresses,,one, of the men that had
been down on purpose to see* cried out,,we had
sprung a leak; another ^id .there was foiir foot
water in the hold. rThen, jail hands» were called to
othejpui^p. At that very ww4w> heart, as I,thought,
iied withift m^anclXfelLbackwards upon ttieiide
of nxy, biec},where I sat, into the cabin. However,
the m?en i£>#sed me, $nd; told me, that I that was
able to do nothing before, was as well able to pump
as another; at which,I stirred,up, a$d went to the
pump ahd, worked yeiy heartily, ^hrLe thi^. wa,s
doing, the rpaster seeing some liglht cojilievs^, who,'
not able to ride out the storm, were obliged to slip
and run away to sea, and would not come near usr
ordered to fire a gun as a signal of distress. I who %
knew nothing what that meant, was so surprised
that I thought the ship had broke, or some dread-,
ful thing happened. In a word, I was so surprised
that I fell down in a swoon. As this was a tircie
when every body had his own life to think of, no-
body minded me, or what was become of me; but
another man stepped up to the pump, and thrusting
me asidb"\\Ktti his foot, let me lie, thinking I had,
be6n dead'; '§!rid }t was a great while before J cam$(
to my serif!
We worked on, but the water increasing in the
hold, it was apparent that th'6 ship would founder;
and though the storm began to abate a little, yet
as it was riot possible she could swim till we might
run into a port, so the master continued firing
guns for help; and a light ship who had rid it out
just d-hfead of us, ventured a boat out to help us.
It w&te with the utmost hazarcl the boat came near
us, but it was impossible for us to get on board,,or
for 'the l&at to lie near' the(shLp's side: till at last*
the men rowing very heartily, and venturing their
livefc tB kuVe'ours/ our' jnen cast them a rppq over
the*sVend witli t^eftupyto it, anijl then veered it,,
out a Wrfeat length, which'they'after great labour

agt^fctf to [ether drive," and only to pull her in
towards shore as inuch as \^e could, and our master
promised them, that if the boat Was staved upon
shore he would make it good to their master: so,
partly rowing and partly driving, our boat went
avVay to the northward, sloping towards the shore
aliribst as far as Winterton-Ness.
We were not much more than a quarter of an
hotir but of our ship before we saw her sink, and then
I understood for the first time what was meant by
a ship foundering in the sea; I must acknowledge
I b&d hardly eyes to look up when the seamen told.
me 6he was sinking; for From that moment they
rather put me into the boat than that I might be
said to go in: my heart was as it were de$d witkr
in trie, partly with fright, partly with horror of
mind, and the thoughts of what was yet before npe.
While we were in this condition, the men yet
labouring at the oaf to bring the boat near the
shore, we could see (when our boat mounting the
waves we were able to see the shore) a great n>any

we should come near, biif wef made but slow vvay

But my ill fate pushed me on now with an obsti-

several times loud calls from my reason and my
-snore composed judgment to go home, yet I had
no power to do it. I know not what to call this,
nor will I urge that it is a secret overruling decree
that hurries us on to be the instruments of our own

we push upon it with our eyes open. Certainly
nothing but some such decreed unavoidable misery

a very grave and concerned tone, Young man,
says he, you ought never to go to sea any more;
you ought to take this for a plain and visible token
that you are not to be a seafaring man. Why,
Sir, said I, will you go to sea no more? That is
another case, said he, it is my calling, and there-
fore my duty; but as you made this voyage for a
trial, you see what a taste Heaven has given you
of what you are to expect if you persist; perhaps
this is all befallen us on your account, like Jo-
nah in the ship of Tarshish. Pray, continued he,
whjtt are you? and on what account did you go
to sea? Upon that I told him some of my story;
at the end of which he burst out with a strange
kind of passion. What had I done, says he, that
such an unhappy wretch should come into my
ship! I would not set my-foot in the same ship
with thee again for a. thousand pounds. This in-
deed was, as I said, an excursion of his spirits,

I know not., iAs for me^ having *some money,in
my pocket, Is travelled to London, by land; and
there, as well as on the road, had many struggles
with myself, what course of life I should take,
and whether I should go home, or go to sea.
As to going home, shame opposed the best mo-
tions that offered to my thoughts; and it imme-
diately occurred to me how I.should be laughed
at among the neighbours, and should be ashamed
to see, not my father, and mother only, but even
every body eUe; from whence I have since often
observed^ how incongruous and irrational the
QQpimou temper of mankind is, especially of youth,
tQ that reason.which ought to guide them in such
cases, viz, that they are not ashamed to sin, and
yet are ashamed to repent; nor ashamed of the
a&tionfor which they ought justly to be esteemed
fools, but are ashamed of the returning, which
only qan make them be esteemed wise men.
In this state .of life however I remained some
time, uncerfcaii* what measures to take, and what
.course of life to lead. An irresistible reluctance
continued to going home; and as I stayed a while,
the rernembranee o£ the distress I had been in wore
off; and i as that abated,,; the. little motion! bad in
my, desires to & return wore off with ity till, at last
I.quite.lakL asicletiie thoughts offitr.and looked

,-• That .evil influence >wbieh carried nje first away
foomtmy father's house, that, hurried me into the
wild and indicted notion of raising my foutiwe;
and that imprest those conceits so^ forcibly upon
me, as'to make me deaf to all gbbd fed vice,- and to
the entreaties and even the command of my father:
I say, the same influence, whatever it was, pre-
sented the most unfortunate of all enterprizes to
my view; and I went on board a vessel bound to
the coast of Africa; or, as our sailors vulgarly call
it, a voyage to Guinea.
It was my great misfortune that in all these ad-
ventures I did not ship myself as a sailor; whereby,
though I might indeed have worked a little harder
than ordinary, yet at the same time I had learned
the duty and office of a fore-mast man; and in
time might have qualified myself for a mate or
lieutenant, if not for a master. But as it Was
always my fate to choose for the worse, so I did
here; for having money in my pocket, and good
clothes upon my back, I would always go on board
in the habit of a gentleman; and so I neither had
any business in the ship, or learned to do any.
It was my lot first of all to fall into pretty good
company in London, which does not always happen
to such loose and unguided young fellows as I then
was; the devil generally not omitting to lay some
snare for them very early: but it was not so with
me. I first fell acquainted with the master of a
ship who had beeti on the coast of Guinea; and
who having had'v&y good1 success there, was re-
'tolmed to go; again; and who takiiig a fancy to my
conversation, which was not at all 'dfeagree&ble at
that titnfc, 'hearing me say I hatt a miftd tosee the

I embraced the offer, and entering into a strict
friendship with this captain, who was an honest
and plained eaiing man, I went the voyage with
him, and carried a small adventure with me, which
by the disinterested honesty of my friend, the cap-
tain, I increased very considerably; for I carried
about 40 /.in such toys and trifles as the captain
directed me to buy. This 40/. I had mustered
together by the assistance of some"of my relations
whom I corresponded with, and who, I believe,
got my father, or at least my mother, to contribute
so much as that to my first adventure.
This* was* the only voyage which I may say was
successful in all my adventures, and which I owe
to the integrity and honesty of my friend the cap-
tain, under whom also I got a competent knowr
ledge of the mathematics, and the rules of naviga-
tion, learned how to keep an account of the ship's
course^ take an observation, and, in short, to un-
derstand some things*that were needful to be un-
derstood by a sailors r* for .as he took delight to in*

thrown into a violent icalentuate by the excessive
heat#f the climate; our prineipab [beading being
upon the coast, from the latitude of Id'degrees
nojth even to the liue itself. - :
I was now set up for a Guinea trader; and<f»y
friend, to my great misfortune, dying soon*after his
arrival, I resolved to go the same voyage again,
and I embarked in the same vessel with one who
was his mate in the former voyage, and had now
got the command of the ship. This was the up-
happiest voyage that ever man made; for/though
I jdid not carry quite. 100/. of roy new gained
wealth, so that I had 200 left, and which t lodged
with my friend's widow, who was very juit torifte^
yet I fell into terrible misfortunes in this voyage;
and the firat was this, viz. Our ship makiaglieF
^oursfe towards the Canary Islands, or rather bet
tween those islands and the African shore* was
surprised in the grey of the morning, by a Turkish
rover of Sallee, who gave chase to us with aH th6
sail she could make. We crowded also a& much
canvas as our yards would spread*; or our masts
carry, to have got clear; tbtTti finding the pirate
gained upon us, and would certainly come up wifch
us in a few hours, we prepared to figbt; our sbipt
having 12 gunsj and tho^ogue 18. About three

his small shot from near £00 men which he had
on board. However, we had not a man touched,
all our men keeping close. He prepared to attack
us again, and we to defend ourselves; but laying
us on board the next time upon our other quarter,
he entered 60 men upon our decks, who immedi-
ately fell to cutting and hacking the decks and
rigging. We plied them with small shot, half-
pikes, powder-chests, and such like, and cleared
our deck of them twice. However, to cut short
this melancholy part of our story, our ship being
disabled-, and three of our men killed, and eight
wounded, we were obliged to yield, and were car-
ried all prisoners into Sallee, a port belonging to
the Moors.
The usage I had there was not so dreadful as at
first I apprehended, nor was I carried up the coun-
try to the emperor's court, as the rest of our men
were, but was kept by the captain of the rover, as
his proper prize, and made his slave, being young
and nimble, and fit for his business. At this sur-
prising* change of my circumstances, from a mer-
chant to a miserable slave, I was perfectly over-
whelmed; and now I looked back upon my father's
prophetic discourse to* me^ that I should be mise-
rable, and have none to relieve me, which I thought
was now so effectually brought to pass, that I could
not be wdrse; that bow the hand of Heaven had
overtaken me, and'I was undone without redemp-
tion. But, alas! this was but a taste of the misery
I was to go through, as will appear in the sequel
of the story.
As my new patron or master had taken me home
to hi$Jiqu#3, sQjIpW^ki l>qpes,^i%t h# would take
me^witfy, him when.be.wpnt to $e^ ag?un, believing
that it woi|ld so#jp tjme or other he hU >&te to be
taken by a Spanish or.Portugal man of war; and
that then I should be set at liberty. But this hope
of mine was soon taken away; for when he went
to sea, he left me on shore to look after his little
garden, and do the common drudgery of slaves
about his house; and when he came home again
from his cruise, he ordered me to lie in the cabin
to look after the ship.
Here I meditated nothing but my escape; and
what method I might take to effect it, but found
no way that had the least probability in it: nothing
presented to make the supposition of it rational;
for I had nobody to communicate it to, that would
embark with me; no fellow-slave, no Englishman,
Irishman, or Scotsman, there but myself; so that
for two years, though I often pleased myself with
the imagination, yet I never had the least encou-
raging prospect of putting it in practice.
After about two years an odd circumstance pre-
sented itself, which put the old thought of making
some attempt for my liberty, again in my head:
my patron lying at homelongev than usual, with-
out fitting.out his ship, which, as I heard, was few
want of money, he used constantly, on^ce or twicg
a week* sometimes oftener, if the weather was fair*
ta tjajke the ship's pinnace, and, go out into the,
iroa^a fishing;, and as he:always took me? andat
young MarfscQ with him. to row the Jboat>> we
made him very merry, and I proved very dexte-
rous in catching fish; insomuch that sometimes he
would send me with a Moor, one of his kinsmen,
and the youtb, the Maresco as they called him, to
catch a dish of fish for him.
It happened one time, that going a fishing in a
stark calm morning, a fog rose so thick, that
though we were not half a league from the shore,
Ai=>
we lost sight of it; and rowing we knew not
whither or which way, we laboured all day, and
all the next night, and when the morning came
we found we had pulled off to sea instead of pull-
ing in for the shore; and that we were at least
two leagues from the shore: however we got well
in again, though with a great deal of labour, and
some danger; for the wind began to blow pretty
fresh in the morning; but particularly we were all
very hungry.
But our patron, warned by this disaster, resolved
to take more care of himself for the future; and
having lying by him the long boat of our English
ship he had taken, he resolved he would not go a
fishing any more without a compass and some pro-
vision; so he ordered the carpenter of his ship,
who also was an English slave, to build a little
state-room or cabin in the middle of the long-boat,
like that of a barge, with a place to stand behind
it to steer and hale home the main-sheet; androom
before for a hand or two to stand and work the
sails; she sailed with what we call a shoulder of
mutton sail; afcd the boom gibed over the top of
the cabin, which lay very snug and low, and had
rait room for him to lie^with a slave or two, and

a; table to >eat 00, with some sjfeallrtoekers to put
in some bottles of such liquor %s he thought fit to
drink; particularly his bread,Uiee^and coffee, :
We went frequently out with this boat-a fishing,:
and as I was most dexterous to catch fish for him,
he never went without me. It happened that he
had appointed to go out in this boat, either for
pleasure or for fish, with two or three Moors of>
some distinction in that place, and for whom he
had provided extraordinarily; and had therefore
sent on board the boat over night a larger store
of. provisions than ordinary; and had ordered me
to get ready three fusees with powder and shot,-
which were on board his ship; for that they:de-<
signed some sport of fowling, as well as fishing.
i I got all things ready as he had directed, andi
waited the next morning with the boat washed;
clean, her ancient and pendants out, and every
thing to accommodate his guests; when by andi
by my patron came on board alone, and told me^
his guests had put off going, upon som^ business
that fell out, and ordered me with the man and:
boy, as usual, to go~ out with the boat and eateta
them some fish, for that his; friends were to sup at
his house; and commanded that as soon as I got
some fish I should bring it home to his house; all
which I prepared to do* < ,j
This moment my former notions -of deliverance;
darted into my thoughts, for now I found I was
like to have a little ship at my command; a^nd my
master being gone, I prepared to furnish myself,
not for fishing business, but for a voyage; though
I knew not, neither did I so much as consider,
whither I should steer; for any where to get out
of that place was my way.
My first contrivance was to make a pretence to
speak to this Moor, to get something for our sub-
sistance on board; for I told him we must not
presume to eat of our patron's bread: he said, that
was true; so he brought a large basket of rusk or
biscuit of their kind, and three jars with fresh
water into the boat. I knew where my patron's
case of bottles stood, which it was evident by the
make were taken out of some English prize; and
I conveyed them into the boat while the Moor
was on shore, as if they had been there before for
our master: I conveyed also a great lump of bees-
wax into the boat, which weighed above half a
hundred weight, with a parcel of twine or thread,
a hatchet, a saw, and a hammer, all which were of
great use to us afterwards; especially the wax to
make can<dle9. Another trick I tried upon him,
which he innocently came into also. His name
was Ismael, who they call Muly, or Moley: so I
called to him; Moley, said I, our patron's guns are
on board the boat, can you not get a little powder
and shot, it may be we may kill some Alcamies (a-
fowl like our curlews) for ourselves, for I know
he keeps the gunner's stores in the ship? Yes,
says he, I'll bring some, and accordingly he
brought a great leather pouch which held about a
pound and a half of powder, or rather more; and'
another with shot, that had five or six pounds,
with some bullets, and put all into the boat: at
the same time I had found some powder of my'
master's in the gteat cabin, with which I filled'one
of the large bottles in the case, which was almost
empty; pouring what was in it into another: and
thus furnished with everything needful, we sailed
out of the port to fish. The castle which is at the
entrance of the port knew who we were, and took
no notice of us; and we were not above a mile
out of the port before we haled in our sail, and set
us down to fish: the wind blew from the N.N.E.
which was contrary to my desire; for had it blown
southerly I had been sure to have made the coast
of Spain, and at least reached to the bay of Cadiz;
but my resolutions were, blow which way it would,
I would be gone from that horrid place where I
was, and leave the rest to fate.
After we had fished some time and catched no-
thing, for when I had fish on my hook I would
not pull them up, that he might not see them; I
said to the Moor, this will not do, our master will
iiot be thus served, we must stand farther off: he
thinking no harm agreed, and being in the head
of the boat set the sails; and as I had the helm I
run the boat out near a league farther, and then
brought her to as if I would fish, when giving the
boy the helm, I stept forward to where the Moor
was, and making as if I stooped for something
behind him, I took him by surprise with my arm
under his twist, and tossed him clear overboard
into the sea. He rose immediately, for he swam
like a cork, and calling to me, begged to be taken
in, told me he would go all over the world with
me; he swam so strong after the boat that he
would have reached me very quickly, there being
but little wind; \ippn which I stept into the cabin,
E 2
and fetching one of the fowling-pieces, I presented
it at him, and told him, I had done him no hurt,
and if he would be quiet I would do him 'none:
but, said I, you swim well enough to reach to the
shore, and the sea is calm, make the best of your
way to shore, and I will do you no harm, but if
you come near the boat I'll shoot you through the
head; for I am resolved to have my liberty: so he
turned himself about and swam for the shore, and
I make no doubt but lie reached it with ease, for
he was an excellent swimmer.
I could have been content to have taken this
Moor with me, and have drowned the boy, but
there was no venturing to trust him. When he was
gdiVe I turned to the boy, who they called Xury,
arid Said to him, XuryJ'if'you Will be faithful to
Jme I'll make you a great tn&n, but if you Will not
stroke your face to be true to me, that is, swear
by Mahomet and his father's beard, I must throw
you into the sea too: the boy smiled in mytface,
and spoke so innocently that I could not mistrust
him';'and swOre to be faithful to me, and go ail
over the world with me. •» ,
While I was in view of the Moot that was swim-
mitig, I stood out directly to sea'With the boat,
rather stretching to windward, that they Bright
'think me gone towards the 'Straits mouth (as in-
deed any one that had been: in their .wits must
have' been supposed to do,) for Who would have
supposed we Were sailed oil to the Southward to
the truly Barbarian coast, where whole nations, of
negrbes were sure to surround us With their canoes,
and destroy us; where wfc could never.once go on
shore Imt we jshould be devoured by savage beasts,
or mprC;merciless savages of human kind?
,-i But .-as! soon as it grew dusk in ..the evening, I
.changed my course, and steered directly south and
by east, bending my course a little toward the east,
that I might keep in with the shore; and having
a fair fresh gale of wind, and a smooth quiet sea, I
made such sail that I believe by the next day at
three o'clock in the afternoon, when I first made
the-land, I could not be less than 150 miles south
of Sallee; quite beyond the emperor of Morocco's
dominions, or indeed of any other king thereabouts,
«fbr we saw no people.
Yet such was the fright I had taken at the
Moors, and the dreadful apprehensions I had of
falling into their hands, that I would not stop, or
go an shore, or come to an anchor. The wind con-
tinuing fair till I had sailed in that manner five
days, and then the wind shifting to the south-
ward, I concluded also that if any of our vessels
were in chase of me, they also would now give
overj.so I ventured to make to the coast, and
come to an anchor in the mouth of a little river,
J knew not what, .or .where; neither what latitude,
iwliat country, what nation, or what river: I nei-
ther saw, or desired to see any people, the princi-
pal thing I wanted was, fres!v water. We came
into this creek in the eve^ng^ resolving to swim
rQn.sliore as soo& as itv was ;d?i'k, :and discover the
Wiantry; but as soon(as;it was quite dark, we heard
smll dreadful npifces of the barking,' roaring!, and
howling q! wild, cultures of we knew not what
kinds, that the ppprvboy Was ready to dicwith fear,
and begged of me not to go on shore till day.
Well, Xury, said I, then I won't, but it may be we
may see men by day, who will be as bad to us as
those lions. Then we give them the shoot gun,
says Xury, laughing; make them run wey. Such
English Xury spoke by conversing among us slaves.
However I was glad to see the boy so cheerful,
and I gave him a dram (out of our patron's case
of bottles) to cheer him up: after all, Xury's ad-
vice was good, and I took it; we dropped our little
anchor and lay still all night; I say still, for we
slept none; for in two or three hours we saw vast
great creatures (we knew not what to call them)
of many sorts, come down to the sea-shore and run
into the water, wallowing and washing themselves
for the pleasure of cooling themselves; and they
made such hideous bowlings and yellings, that I
never indeed heard the like.
Xury was dreadfully frighted, and indeed so was
I too; but we were both more frighted when we
heard one of these mighty creatures come swim-
ming towards our boat: we could not see him, but
we might hear him by his blowing to be a mon-
strous huge and furious beast. Xury said it was a
lion, and it might be so for aught I know; but
poor Xury cried to me to weigh the anchor and
row away. No, says I, Xury, we can slip our cable
with a buoy to it and go off to sea, they cannot
foliow us far. I had no sooner said so, but I per-
ceived the creature (whatever it was) within two
oars length, which something surprised me; how-
ever I immediately stept to the cabin-door, and
taking up my gun fired at him, upon which he
immediately turned about, and swam towards the
shore again.
But it m impossible to describe the horrible
noises, and hideous cries and bowlings, that were
raised, as well upon the edge of the shore, as higher
within the country, upon the noise or report of
the gun; a thing I have some reason to believe
those creatures had never heard before: this con-
vinced me that J:here was no going on shore for
ns in the night upon that coast, and how to ven-
ture on shore in the day was another question too;
for to have fallen into the hands of any of the
savages, had been as bad as to have fallen into the
bands of lions and tigers; at least we were equally
apprehensive of the danger of it
Be that as it would, we were obliged to go on
shore somewhere or other for water, for we bad
fiota pint left in the boat; when or where to get
to it was the point Xury said, if I would let him
go on shore with one of the jars, he would find if
there was any water and bring some to me. I
asked him why he would go? why I should not go,
and he stay in the boat? The boy answered with
so much affection that made me love him ever
after. Says he, If wikl mans come, they eat me,
you go wey. Well, Xury, said I, we will both
go, and if the wild mans come, we will kill them,
they shall eat neither of us; so I gave Xury a
piece of rusk-bread to eat, and a dram out of our
patron's case of bottles which I mentioned before;
and we haled the boat in as near the shore as we
thought was proper, and waded on shore; carrying
ndthing but our arms* and two jars for water.
I did not care to go out of sight of the boat,
fearing the coming of canoes with savages down
the river: but the boy seeing a low place about a
mile up the country rambled to it; and by and by
I saw him come running towards me. I thought
he was pursued by some savage, or frighted with
some wild beast, and I ran forward towards him
to help him, but when I came nearer to him, I
saw something hanging over his ^shoulders, which
was a creature that he had shot, like a hare, but
different in colour, and longer legs; however we
were very glad of it, and it was very good meat;
but the great joy that poor Xury Game with, was
to tell me he had found good water, and seen no
wild mans. . , •
But we found afterwards that we need not take
jfuch pains-for water; for a little higher up the*
creek where we were, we found the water* fresh
when the tide was out, which. flows but a little-
way u-p; so we filled our jars and feasted on the
hare we had killed, and prepared to go on our
way, having seen no foot-steps of any human
Creature in that part of the country.
As I had been One voyage to this coast before,
I knew very well that the; islands of the Canaries,:
and the Cape d.e Verd islands also, lay not far off
from the :coast. But as I had no instruments to
take an observation to know what latitude we were
in, and not exactly, knowing, or at least remem-
bering,- what latitude: they were in, I knew not
where to look for them, or wh^n tof strand off-to-
sea towards them; otherwise I might now easily
have found some of th<ese islands. .-But iny* hope
was, that if I stood along this coast till I came to
that part where the English traced, I should find
some of their vessels uppa their usual design of
trade, that would relieve and. take us in.
By the best of my calculation, that place wherq
I now was, must be that country, which lying be-
tween the emperor of Morocco's dominions and
the Negroes, lies waste, and uninhabited, except
by wild beasts; the Negroes having abandoned,
it, and gone farther south for fear of the Moors;
and the Moors not thinking it. worth inhabiting,
by reason of its barrenness; and indeed both for*
sjaking it because of the prodigious number of
tigers, lions, leopards, and other furious creatures
which harbour there; so that the Moors use it for
their hunting only, where they go like an army,
two or three thousand men at a time; and indeed
for near an hundred miles together upon this coast,
we saw nothing but a waste uninhabited country
by day; and heard nothing but bowlings and roarr
ing of wild beasts by night.
Once or twice in the day time I thought I saw
the Pico of Teneriffe, being the high top of the
mountain Teneriffe in the Canaries; and had a
great mind to venture out in hopes of reaching
thither; but having tried twice, I was forced in
again by contrary winds, the sea also going too
high for my little vessel, so.I resolved to pursue
my first design and keep along the shore.
Several times I was obliged to land for fresh
water, after ws had left this, place; and once in
particular^ being early im the morning* we came

me, and tells me that we had best go farther off
the shore; for* says he, look yonder lies a dread-
ful monster on the side of that hillock fast asleep,
I looked where he pointed, and saw a dreadful
monster indeed, for it was a terrible great lion^that
lay on the side of the shore, under the shade of ,a
piece -of the hill that hung as it were a little over
him.. Jtufyj s^ys I> y°u s^a^ S° on shore anc^kili

almost ^a\isquetr^orei and loaded it wifh a good
charge of powder, and with two slugs, and laid it
down; then I'loacjed another gun with two bui-
lds; and the third, for we had three pieces, I
loaded with five smaller bullets. I took the best
aim I could with the first piece, to have shot him

andtdking a little gun ifoone hand, swam to^hore
with the other hand, and earning iilose to the crea-
ture, put the muzzle of the piece to liis ear, and
AW him into the head again, which dispatched
him quite.
This was game indeed to us, but this was no
Food; and I was very sorry to lose three charges
of powder and shot upon a creature that was good
for nothing to us. However, Xury said he would
hive some of him; so he comes on bo&rd, and
a&ked me to give him the hatchet. For wh&fc,
Xury? said L Me cut off his head, said he.
Htfwever, Xury could not cut off his head, but hfe
cut off a foot, and brought it with him, and it was
a monstrous great one. ^ - ->
1 bethought myself however, that perhaps'the
skin of him might one way or other be of soirte
value to us; and I resolved to take off his skin/if
I could. So Xury and I went to work with him;
but Xury was much the better workman at it, for
I knew very ill ho# to do it Indeed it took us
up both the whole day; but at last we got off the
hide of him, and spreading it on thfe top of <rik
cfabin, the sun effectually dried it in two days tim£,
and it afterwards served me t&Hd upon.

negal, thatfis to say, any where aboilt the Cape de
VerdJ whei'eMIwas in'hoj:>es to meet with some
Eitropeariship; and if I did not, I knew not what
cburse I had to take, but to seek for the Islands,
tor perish there among the Negroes. I knew that
all the ships from Europe, which sailed either to
the coast of Guinea or to Brasil, or to the East In-
dies, made this Cape, or those Islands; and, in a
word, I put the whole of my fortune upon this
single point, either that I must meet with somq
ship, or must perish.
When I had pursued this resolution about ten
dayis longfer, as I have said, 1 began to see that'the
land was inhabited; and in two or three places, is
we sailed by, we saw people stand upon the shore
t6 look1 at us; we could also perceive they wete
quite black, and stark naked. I was once inclined
to haVe gone on shore to them; but Xury was
my better counsellor, and said to me, No go, no
go: however I hauled in nearer the shore that I
might talk to them, and I found they ran along
the shore by me & good way. I observed they had
no Weapons'in thfeir hands, except one, Who had a
long slender stick, Which Xufy said was a lance,
and tha't they would throw them a great Way with
gfeod aim. So Tkept at a distance, but talked with
them by signs as well as I Could; and particularly
made1 signs for something'to eats they beckoned
to me tb stop my boat, and they would fetch trie
some meat; ujpoh this I lowered the top of my
sail, and* lay by, and two of them ran up into tile
country, and in less than half an' hour came baeft,
arid brought with them two pieces of dry>fl$Bh
a04o?^®^i^^%rs^cb aa is the .produce of their
QQU&tgyi; but we neither knew what-the, one nor
toother wq$z however, we were willing to accept
i% b^thow to-cdwe at it was our next dispute, for
I: was not for venturing on shore to them* and
fehey were as much afraid of us; but they took a
safe way for us all, for they brought it to the shore
and laid it down, and went and stood a great way
off till we fetched it on board, and then came close
Jo us again,
We made signs of thanks to them, for we had
.sathittg to make them amends; but an opportunity
$fFered that very instant to oblige them wonder-
fully; for while we were lying by the. shore, came
tw# mighty creatures, one pursuing theother (as
we^took it) witli great fury,* from the mountains
Itewa^ds the sea: whether it was the male,pursuing
the female; or whether they were in, sport or in
rage, we could not tell,, any more than we could
tell whether it was usual; or strange, but I believe
itiwas? the latter; (because, in .the'.first place,, tl^ose
i^venous creatures seldom appear but in the fcight;
md in the second places we found the people ter-
ribly frighted, especially^ t)be Women. ^Theman
^bathad #ie' lahee or dart td&d not fly fromithem,

within my reach,11 fired, and shot him jdirectly
into the bead. Immediately he sqnjt down into
the water, but rose instantly, and plunged up and
do$m as if he was struggling for life; and so in*
deed he Was: he immediately made to the shore,
but between the wound, which was his mortal
hurt, and the strangling of the water, he died just
before he reached the shore.
It is impossible to express the astonishment of
these poor creatures at the noise and the fire of my
gun; some of them were even ready to die for fear,
and fell down as dead with the very terror. But
when they saw the creature dead, and sunk in the
water, and that I made signs to them to come to
the shore, they took heart and came to the shore,
and began to search for the creature. I found him
by his blood staining the water; and by the help
of a rope, which I slung round him, and gave the
l^egroes to haul, they dragged him on shore, and
found that^it was a most curious leopard, spotted
and fine to an admirable degree, and the Negroes
held up their hands with admiration to think what
it >vas I had killed him with.
The other creature, frighted with the flash of fire
and the noise of the gun, swam on shore, and ran
up directly to the mountains from whence they
came, nor could I at that distance know what it
was. I found quickly the Negroes were for ear-
ing the flesh of this preature, so £ was willing to
have them take it as a .favour from me, which
when I njade signs to them that they might take
him, they were very thankful f<5h Immediately
they fell to work with hin), and though they had
no knife, yet with a sharpened piece of wood they
tools off his skin as readily, and much more readily,
than we could have done with a knife: they offered
me some of the fleshy which I declined* making as
if I would give it them, hut made signs for the
skin, which they gave me very freely, and brought
me a great deal more of their provision, which
though I did not understand, yet I accepted j then
I made signs to them for some water, and held out
one of my jars to them, turning it bottom upward,
to shew that it was empty, and that I wanted to
h$ye it filled. They called immediately to some
of their fiiends, and there came two women^and
brought a great vessel made of earth, and burnt; as
I suppose, in the sun; this they set down for me,
as befoie, and I sent Xury on shore with my Jars,
and filled them all three. The women wei;e as
stark naked as the men.
I was now furnished with roots and corn, such
as it was, and water; and, leaving my friendly-
Negroes, I made forward for about eleven days
more, without offering to g?o near the shore, till I
saw the land run out a great length into the sea,
at about the distance of four or five leagues before
me; and, the sea being very calm, I kept a large
<Dffing to make this point:'at length, doubling the
jpoinjt at about two leagues fron> the land, I saw
plainly land on {he othef lsid(j to seaward; then I
Icoficluded, as it wats most certain tncf eed^ that tliis

In this 4ijep)rn)a, as I was very pensive, I stept
into the cahjn and set me down, Xury having the
helm; when on a sudden the bay cried oat, MasteH,
master, a ship with assail! and the foolish boy wa$
frighted out of his wits, thinking it must needs be
some of his master's ships sent to pursue us, when,
I knew we were gotten far enough out of their
reach.. I jumped out of the cabin, and immedi-
ately saw not only the ship, but what she was, (viz.)
that it was a Portuguese ship, and, as I thought,
was bound to the coast of Guinea for Negroes
Bjut when J observed the course she steered, I was
soon convinced th§y were bound some other ,W£y,
aijid. did n$t design to come a&y nearer to the shore;
upon which I stretched out' to sea as much as 1
could* resolving to speak with them if possible.
With aU the sail I could make^ I found I should
not be able to come in their way, but that they
would be gone by befpre J could make any signal

very kindly brought-to, and lay-by for me, and in
about three hours time I came up with them.
They asked me what I was, in Portuguese, and
in Spanish, and in French; but I understood none
of them; but at last a Scots sailor, who was on
board, called to me, and I answered him, and told
him I was an Englishman, that I had made my
escape out of slavery from the Moors at Sallee
Then they bade me come on board, and very kindly
took me in, and all my goods.
It was an inexpressible joy to me, that any one
Atfould believe that I was thus delivered, as I
esteemed it, from such a miserable and almost
hopeless condition as I was in, and immediately
offered all I had to the captain of the ship, as a
return for my deliverance; but he generously told
me, he would take nothing from me, but that all
I had should be delivered safe to me when I came
to the Brasils; for, says he, I have saved your
life on no other terms than I would be glad to be
saved myself; and it may one time or other be my
lot to be taken up in the same condition: Besides,
said he, when I carry you to the Brasils, so great
a \fray from your own country, if I should take
fFom you what you have, you will be starved there,
and then I only take away that life I have given.
No, no, Seignior Inglese, says he, Mr. English-
mat), X will carry you thither in charity, and those
thitogs will -help you to buy your subsistence there,
and your passage home agairii
As he was charitable m his proposal, so he was
just in the performance to a tittle, for he ordered
tlfese^me% that ^one should offer to touch any
G
thing I had; then he took every thing into his
own possession, and give me back an exa6t inven-
tory of them, that I might have them; even so
much as my three earthen jars.
As to my boat, it was a very good one, and that
he saw, and told me he would buy it of me for the
ship's use, and asked me what I would have for it?
I told him, he had been so generous to me in every
thing, that I could not offer to make any price of
the boat, but left it entirely to him; upon which
he told me he would give me a note of his hand
to pay me 80 pieces of eight for it at Brasil; ancl
when it came there, if any one offered to give
mare, he would make it up; he offered me also 60
pieces of eight more for my boy Xury, which I
A^as loth to take; not that I was not willing to
let the captain have him, but I was very loth to
3ell the poor boy's liberty, who had assisted me so
iaithfiiily in procuring my own. However, when
I let him know my reason, he owned it to be just,
and offered me this medium, that he would give
the boy am obligation to set him free in ten years,
if he turned Christian. Upon this, and Xury say-
ing he was willing ta go to him, I let the captain
Jiave him, <f

nothing of me for my passage gave me twenty
ducats for the leopard's skin, and forty for the
lionus skin, which I had in my boat, and caused
every thing I had in the ship to he punctually de-
livered me; and what I was willing to sell he
bought, such as the case of bottles, two of my
guns* and a piece of the lump of bees-wax, for I
had made candles of the rest; in a word, I made
about 220 pieces of eight of all my cargo, and with
this stock I went on shore in the Brasils.
I had not been long here, but being recom-
mended to the house of a good honest man like
himself, who had an Ingenio as they call it; ihat
is, a plantation and a sugar house; I lived with
him some time, and acquainted myself by that
means with the manner of their planting and mak-
ing of sugar; and seeing how well the plantejs
Hved, and how they grew rich suddenly, I resolved,
if I could get license to settle there, I would turn
planter among them, resolving in the mean time
to find out some way to get my money, which I
had left in London, remitted to me. To this pur-
pose, getting a kind of a letter of naturalization,
1 purchased as much land tbat was uncured as my
money would reach, and formed a plan for my
plantation and settlement,* and^u^h a one as might
be suitable to the stock wjuch I proposed to my-
self to receive firomjEngland*

Stock was'but low^as well as bis; and we* rather

tWfr years.' However, we beg&n to increase, and
Olir land began to come into order; so that the
third year we planted some tobacco, and made each
of usf & large piece of ground ready for planting
canes in the y£ar to come; but we both wanted
help; and now I found, more than before, I had
done wrong in parting with my boy Xury.
But alas! for me to do wrong, that never did
right, was no great wonder; I had no remedy but
to go on; I was gotten into an employment quite
reniote to my genius, and directly contrary to the
life'I1 delighted-in, and for which I forsook my
father's house, and broke through all his good ad-
vice; 'tiay, I was coming into the very middle
station* <6r up£er degree of low life, which my fa-
ther advised me to before; and which if I resolved
to go on with, I might as well have staid at home,
and never haVe fatigued myself in the world as I
had done; and I used^ often to say to myself, I
could have done this as well in England among
my friends, as have gone five thousand miles off
to do it, among strangers and savages in a wilder-
ness, and at such* distance as never to hear from

you riiay liaVe the other half to have recourse to
for your supply.
This was so wholesome advice, and looked so
friendly, that I could not but be convinced it was
the best course I could take; so I accordingly pre-
pared letters to the gentlewoman with whom I had
left my money, and a procuration to the Portu-
guese captain, as he desired.
I wrote the English captain's widow a full ac-
count of all my adventures, my slavery, escape,
and how I had met with the Portugal captain at
sea, the humanity of his behaviour, and what con-
dition I was now in, with all other necessary
directions for my supply; and when this honest
captain came to Lisbon, he found means, by some
of the English merchants there, to send over, not
the order only, but a full account of my story, to
a merchant at London, who represented it effec-
tually to her; whereupon, she not only delivered
the money, but out of her own pocket sent the
Portugal captain a very handsome present for his
humanity and charity to me.
The merchant in London vesting this hundred
pounds in English'gdods, such as the captain had
written for, sent fchfctiV directly to him at Lisbon,
and he brought thetttT&ll safe to me to the Brasils;
among which, without my direction (for I was too
young in my business to think of them) he had
taken care to haVe all sorts bf tools, iron-work, and
utensils necessary * for my plantation, and which
were of great use to md! ? '
When this cargo attftreH I'thritight my forturfS
made, for I was surprised with joy of it; and my
good steward the captain had laid out the five
pounds which my friend had sent him for a pre-
sent for himself, to purchase, and bring me over a
servant under bond for six years service, and would
not accept of any consideration, except a little to-
bacco, which I would have him accept, being of
my own produce.
Neither was this all; but my goods being all
English manufactures, such as cloth, stuffs, baize,
and things particularly valuable and desirable in
the country, I found means to sell them to a very
great advantage, so that I may say I had more
than four times the value of my first cargo, and
was now infinitely beyond my poor neighbour, I
"mean in the advancement of my plantation; for
the first thing I did, I bought me a negro slave*
and an European servant also; I mean another
besides that which the captain brought me from
Lisbon.
But as abused prosperity is oftentimes made the
very means of our greatest adversity, so was it
with me. I went on the next year with great
success in my plantation: I raised fifty great rolls
of tobacco on my own groupd, more than I had
disposed of for necessaries among my neighbours;
and these fifty rolls, .being eacjb of above an hun-
dred weight, were well cured an4 laid by against
the r$tyrn of thje fle$t; from Lisbon. And now>
incasing in |wsine$s and in wealth, my head be-
gan to be full of projects ancj undertakings beyond
my resell; such s$ are indeed often the min of the
*best heads in tfiis business.
Had I coutinued in the station I was now in, I
had room for all tHp happy,things to have yet be-
fallen jne, for which'my father, so earnestly recom-
mended a quiet retired life, and of which he had
so sensibly described the middle station of life to
tjefull; but other things attended me, and I was
still to be the wilful agent of all my own miseries;
and particularly to increase my fault, and double
the reflections upon myself, which in my future
sorrows i should have leisure to make. All these
iftiscarriages were procured by my apparent obsti-
nate adhering to my foolish inclination of wander-
ing abroad, and pursuing that inclination, in con-
tradiction to the clearest views of doing myself
good in a fair and plain pursuit of those piospects
and those measures of life, which nature and Pro-
vidence concurred to present me with, and to
-make my duty.
As I had done thus in breaking away from my
parents, so I could not be content now, but I must
-go and leave the happy view I had of being .a rich
and thriving man in my new plantation, only to
pursue a rash and immoderate desire of rising faster
fthan the nature of the thiflg admitted; and thus I
cast myself down again jnto the deepest gulph of
human misery that ever mgn fell into, or perhaps
..could be consistent ^with life and a state of health
in the world. , , .
To come then by th§ just degrees to the parti-
culars of this<part of my storyj you may suppose^
that having now lived almost four yeays in ty$

thelaiiguagb, but had contracted*acquaintance and
friendship among* my fellow-planters, as well as
ampng the merchants at St. Salvadore, which was
our port; and that in my discourse among th^m,
I had frequently given them an account of my two
voyages to the coast of Guinea, the manner of
trading with the Negroes there; and how easy it
was to purchase upon the coast, for trifles, such as
beads, toy's, knives, scissars, hatchets, bits of glass,
arM t*he like, not only gold dust, Guinea grains*
elephants teeth, &c. but Negroes for the service
of the Brasils, in great numbers.
'IThey listened always very attentively to'my dis-
courses on these heads, but especially to that part
which related to the buying 'Negroes, which was a
trade at: that time not only &ot far entered into^
but as far as it was, had been carried on by the
Assientos, or permission of the kings of Spain and
Portugal, and engrossed in the public, so that few
Negroes were bought, and those excessive dear.

The . same day I Went'on board wc set sail,
standing away to the northward upon: our-own
coasfywith design to stretch over for the African
coast, when they came about 10 or 12 degrees of
northern latitude, which it seems was the manner
of their course in those days. We had very good
weather, only excessive hot, all the way upon our
own coast, till we came the height of Cape St.
Augustino; from whence keeping farther off at
sea we lost sight of land, and steered as if we were
bound for the isle Fernand de Noronha, holding
our course N. E> by N. and leaving those isles on
the east. In this course we passed the line in
about twelve days time, and were by our last ob-
servation in 7 degrees 22 min. northern latitude,,
when a violent tornado or hurricane took us quite
out of our knowledge: it began from the south-
east, came about to the north-west, and then set-
tled into the north-east, from whence it blew in
such a terrible manner, that for twelve days toger
ther we could do nothing but drive; and scudding
away before it, let it carry us whither ever fate
and the fury of the winds directed; and during
these twelve days, I need not say that I expected
every day to be swallowed up, nor indeed did any
in the ship expect to save their lives.
In this distress, we had, besides the terror of the
storm, one of our men died of the calenture, and
one man and the boy washed over-board. About
the.twelfth day, the weather abating a little, the
master made an observation as well as he could,
and found that he was in about 11 degrees north
latitude, but that .he was, 22 degrees:of longitude
difference west from Cape St Augustino; so that
he found he was gotten upon the coast of Guinea,
or the north part of Brasil, beyond the river Ama-
zones, toward that of the river Oronoque, com-
monly called the Great River, and began to con-
sult with me what course be should take, for the
ship was leaky and very much disabled, and he
was going directly back to the coast of Brasil.
I was positively against that; and looking over
the charts of the sea-coasts of America with him,
we concluded there was no inhabited country for
us to have recourse to, till we came within the
circle of the Caribbee-islands, and therefore re-
solved to stand away for Barbadoes, which by
keeping off at sea, to avoid the indraft of the bay
or gulph of Mexico, we might easily perform, as
we hoped, in about fifteen days sail; whereas we
could not possibly make our voyage to the coast
of Africa without some assistance, both to our ship
and to ourselves.
With this design we changed our course, and
steered away N. W. by W. in order to reach some
of our English islands, where I hoped for relief;
but our voyage was otherwise determined; for
being in the latitude of 12 deg. 18 min. a second
storm came upon us, which: carried us away with
the same impetuosity westward, and drove us so
out of the very way of all human commerce, that
had all our lives been saved, as tothe sea, we were
rather in danger of being devoured by savages
than ever returning to our country.
In this distress, the windstill blowingwery *hard7
one of our^ men? early in., the morning cried out,
land! and we had'no sooner ran out of the cabin:
to look out, in hopes of seeing whereabouts in the
world we were, but the ship struck upon a sand,
and in a moment, her motion being so stopped,
the sea broke over her in such a manner, that we
expected we should all have perished immediately;
and we were immediately driven into our cl6se
quarters, to shelter us from the very foam and
spray of the sea.
It is not easy for any one, who has not been hi
the like condition, to describe or conceive the con-
sternation of men in such circumstances: we knew
nothing wher^ we were, or upon what land it was
we were driven, whether an island or the main,
whether inhabited or not inhabited; and as the
rage of die wind was still great, though rather
less than at first, we could not so much as hope to
have the ship hold many minutes without breaking
in pieces, unless the winds by a kind of miracle
should turn immediately about In a word, we
sat looking one upon another, and expecting death
every moment, and every man acting accordingly
as preparing for another world, for there was little
or nothing more for us to do in this: that which
was our present comfort, and all the comfort we
had, was, that contrary to our expectation the ship
did not break yet3 and that the master said the
wind began to ^bate.
Now though we found that the wind did a little
abate, yet the ship having thus struck upon the
sand, and sticking too fast for us to expfcct her
getting off, we were in a dreadful condition indeed,
and had nothing to do- but to think of saving our
liv.es as.we'll as we could. We had a boat at our
sterp, just before the storm, but she was-first-staved
by dashing against the shjp's rudder, and in the
next place she broke away, and either sunk or
was driven off to sea, so there was no hope from
her; we had another boat on board, but how to
get her off in to the sea was a doubtful thing: how-
ever, there was no room to debate, for we fancied
the ship would break in pieces every minute, and
some told us she was actually broken already.
In this distress, the mate of our vessel lays hold
of the boat, and with the help of the rest of the
men, they got her slung over the ship's side, and
getting, all into her, let go, and committed our-
selves, being eleven in. number, to God's mercy,
and the wild sea; for though the storm was abated
considerably, yet the sea went dreadful high upon
the shore, and might well be called, den wild zee/
as the Dutch call the sea in a storm.
And now our case was very dismal indeed; for
we all saw plainly, that the sea went so high, that
the boat could not live, and that we should be in-
evitably drowned* As to making sail, we had
none, nor, if we had, could .we have done any thing
with it; so w0 worked at the oar towards the land,
though with heavy hearts; like men going to ex~
eqi^tipn: for we all jknewy that wjien the boat came
nearer the shore, she would be dashed in a thou-
sand pieces by the! ibreddi of jthe sea. However,
\y? committed; our -souls to G,<S>d jiri the !most; earnest
maimer, and the .wind :driving*- ois > towards!  the
sh0r^,,^ve,hasteiie5<.lio:ur fdestruction with our own
h^nd^ p^llipg as jwelhafc we)kmvtid;towardsdatid. *
What the shore was, whether rock or satid,
whether steep or shoal, we knew not; the only*
hope that could rationally give us the least shadow
of expectation, wasr if we might happen into some
bay or gulph, or the mouth of some river, where
by great chance we might have run our boat in,
or got under tti€ lee of the land, and perhaps made
smooth water. But there was nothing of this ap^
peared; but as we made nearer and nearer the
shore, the land looked more frightful than the s£a.
After we had rowed, or rather driven abo&t a
league and a half, as we reckoned it, a raging wave,
mountain-like, came rolling a-stern of us, and
plainly bade us expect the coup-de-grace. f In a
word, it took us with such a fury, that it overset
tb&bbat at once; and separating us, as well from
the boat as from one another, gave us not time
hardly to say, O God! for we were all swallowed
up in a moment. - - <
Nothing can describe the confusion of thought
which I felt when I sunk into the .water;' for
though I swam very well, yet I could not deliver
myself from the waves so as to draw breath, till
that wave having driven me, or rather carried me
a.vast way on to wards .the shore, and having spent
itae^f, .went back, and left me upon the land Almost
dr$,t but half dead with thp wate? I tookfon^I h^d
so.muchi ^presence of mind" as well as bfeath left,
that seeing myself nearer the, main land Hhaaif ex-
pected, I got uppi^ my feet, and .endeavored to
make on towards the land as fast asrl 0pul<^„ hef^fe
another wave should, return apd take me up agai^u
But I.soon fonn<l it was impossible,£o *tQid it;
for I $a\tf tine sea cdme after me as high as a great
hill, and as furious as an enemy which I Had no
means or strength to contend with; my business
was to hold my breath, and rise fayself upoa the
water, if I could: and so by swimming to preserve
my breathing, and pilot myself towards the shore,
if possible: my greatest concern now being that
the sea, as it would carry me a great way towards
the shore when it came on, might not carry me
back again with it when it gave back towards the
sea.
The wave that came upon me again, buried me
at once 20 or 30 foot deep in its own body; and I
could feel myself carried with a mighty force and
swiftness towards the shore, a very great way;
but I lield my breath, and assisted myself to swim
still forward with all my might. I was ready to
burst with holding my breath, when, as I felt my-
self rising up, so, to my immediate relief, I found
my head and hands shoot out above the surface of
the water; and though it was not two seconds of
time fhat I could keep myself so, yet it relieved
me greatly, gave me breath and new courage. I
was covered again with water a good while, but
xxist so long bat I held it out;' and finding iiie
water had sperit itself, and began to return, I struck
ftf^Wrd against thte Veturti df * the waves, and felt
g^iid,a^rfWi&l,dfyft!6t.u 1 stood'still a few
m^fhenbibVefeo^ef ftr£alh? airH till the water Wiit
frcto^^irfd^hei^tookUd riif hfeete, and Wwitii
A\^atvstrelg'^{f1iitl &r&e/ towards the shore:
But neitffer wc\M this deliver toe from the fury
of Jtte'se% tfhilft'eatite potftfog ifa'kftir Wa£aitf,
and twice more I was lifted up by the waves and
carried farwards as before, the shore being very-
flat.
The last time of these two had well tiear been
fatal to me; for the sea having hurried me along
as before, landed me, or rather dashed me against
a piece of a rock, and that with such force, as it
left me senseless, and indeed helpless, as to my
own deliverance; for the blow taking my side and
breast, beat the breath as it were quite out of my
body; and had it not returned again immediately,
I must h&ve been strangled in the water; but I
recovered a little before the return of the waves,
and seeing I should be covered again with the
water, I resolved to hold fast by a piece of the
lock, and so to hold my breath, if possible, til! the
wave went back. Now as the waves were not'so
high as at first, being near land, I held my ihold
till the wave abated, and then fetched another run,
Which brought/me so near the shore, that tkenext
Wave, though it went over me, yet did not so swal-
low me up as to carry me away; and the next run
I took I got to thfe main land, where, to my great
comfprt, I clambered up the clifts of the shore,
and sat me down upon the igrass, free from danger,
and quite out of the reach of Ihe water.:
I was now landed, and safe on shore, and began
to look np and thank God that my life was saved
in a case wherein there was some minutes before
scarce any room to hope. Tbelieve it is impossi-
ble to express to the life what the ecstasies and
transports of the soul are, when it is so saved, as I
may say, out of the very grave;, and I do not won-
-"J^^^^^^^k r
 der now at that custom, viz, that when a malefac-
tor, who has the halter about his neck, is tied up,
and just going to be turned off, and has a reprieve
brought to him; I say, I do not wonder that they
bring a surgeon with it, to let him blood that very
moment they tell him of it, that the surprise may
not drive the animal spirits from the heart, and
overwhelm him:
For sudden joys, like griefs, confound at first.
1 walked about on the shore, lifting up my hands
and my whole being, as I may say, wrapt up in
the contemplation of my deliverance, making a
"thousand gestures and motions which I cannot
describe, reflecting upon ail my comrades that
Were drowned, and that there should not be one
aoul saved but myself; for, as for them, I never
&aw them afterwards, or any sign of them, except
three of their hats, one cap, and two shoes that
were not fellows*
I cast my eyes to the stranded vessel, when the
breach and froth of the sea being so big, I could
hardly see it, it lay so far off, and considered, Lord!
4iow was it possible I could get on shore!
After I had solaced my mind with the comfort-
able part of my condition, I began to look round
me, to see what kind of place I was in, and what
Was next to be done; and I soon found my com-
forts abate, and that, in ft word, I had a dreadfiil
deliverance: for I was wet, had no clothes to shift
me, nor aiiy thing either to eat or drink to comt
fort me; neither did I see any prospect before
ine, but that of perishing with hunger, or being
i S
devoured by*wild beasts^ a»df that whioh was, par-
ticularly afflicting ta arenas," that i had* >no wea-
pon either'to hunt and kill any creature iforlmy
Sustenance, or to defend myself against anyiofcfoer
creatitrfe that might desire to kill me for theirs c in
a word, I had nothing about me but a knife, a^to-
bacco-pipe, and a little tobacco in a box; this^tfas
all my piovisionr and this threw me into terrible
agonies of mind, that for a while I ran about like
a mad-man; night coming upon me, I began With
a heavy heart to consider what would be my lot if
there were any ravenous beasts in that country,
seeing at night they always come abroad for their
prey.
' ^All the remedy that offered to my thoughts at
that timd, was, to get tip into a thick bushy tree
like a fir, but thorny, which grew near me, and
T where! I resolved to sit all night, and consider the
next1day what death I should die, for as yet I saw
no prospect of life. I walked about a furlong from
the shore, to see if I could find any fresh water to
drink, which I did, to my great joy; and having
*dran%; and put a little tobacco in my mouth to
prevent 'hunger,1 I went* to the tree, and getting
tip feto it, endeavdui-ed to* place myself so, as that
<if Pshould sleep $<in%bt ftot fail; and having cut

Wlito'S*walked itq^as&iitoad <fta#,othe tfaafe^er
^clear/ ,and the storm abated, so that the sea did
not rage and swell as before - but>th£t which sur-
prised me most, was, that the ship was lifted off
in the night from the sand where she lay, by,the
swelling of the tide, and was diiven up almost as
far as the rock which I first mentioned, where I
had been so bruised by the dashing me against it;
this being within about a mile fiom the shore
where I was, and the ship seeming to stand upright
still, I wished myself on board, that, at least, I
might save some necessary things for my use.
When I came down from my apartment in the
tree, 1 looked about me again, and the first thing
I found was the boat, which lay as the wind- and
the sea had tossed her, up upon the land, about
two miles on my right hand^; I walked as far as I
could upon the shore to have got to her, but found
a neck or inlet of water between me and the boat,
which was about half a mile broad; so I capie
back for the present, being more intent upon get-
ting at the ship, where I hoped to find something
for my present subsistence.
A little after noon I found the sea very calm,
and the tide ebbed so far out, that I could come
within a quarter of a mile of the ship; and here I
found a fresh renewing of ,my guef; for I, siaw
evidently, that if we had 4cept on board* we had

possible,nto ,gs* teethe ^ip,} so> I prilled off my
6'<2 LtFB A&D ADVE^fauRES
clothes, for the weather was hot to extremity, and
took the water; but wheti I Came to the Ship, my
difficulty was still greater to know how to get on
board, for as she lay a>-ground, and high out of the
Water, there wad nothing within my reach to lay
hold of. I swam rbund her twice, and the second
time I spied a small piece of a rope, which I won-
dered I did not see at first, hang down by the fore-
chains so low as that with great difficulty I got
hold of it, and by the help of that rope got up into
the forecastle of the ship: here I found that the
Ship was bulged, and had a great deal of water in
her hold, but that she lay so on the side of a bank
of hard sand, or rather earth, and her stern lay
lifted up upon the bank, and her head low almost
to the water; by this means all her quarter was
free, and all that was in that part was dry; for
you may be sure my first work was to search and
to see what was spoiled and what was free: and
first I found that all the ship's provisions were
dry, and untouched by the water; and being very
well disposed to eat, I went to the bread-room and
filled my pockets with biscuit, and eat it as I Went
about other things^ for I had no time to lose. I
also found some rum in the great cabin, of which
I took a large dram, and whfch I had indeed need
enough of to spirit me for what was before me.
Now I wanted nothing but a boat to furnish my-
self with many things whteh 1 foresaw would be
very necessary to me. }
It Was in v&ift to sit still and Wish for what was
not to be had, and this e&ttemfity hrti^ed my ap-
plication'. We had feeVWaSl sparse >$mU\ aiid iWfe
QW H0£JN?ON OBUSOE. 63
or three large spars of wood, and a spare top-mast
or two in the ship; I resolved to fall to work witfy
these, and slung as many of them overboard as I
could npanage of their weight, tying every one
with a rope that they might not drive away; when
this was done I went down the ship's side, and
pulling them to me, I tied four of them fast to-
gether at both ends, as well as I could, in the form
of a raft, and laying two or three short pieces of
plank upon them cross-ways, I found I could walk
upon it very well, but that it was not able to bear
ajay great weight, the pieces being too light; so I
went to work, and with the caipenter's saw I cut
a spare top-mast into three lengths, and added
them to my raft, with a great deal of labour and
pains; .but hope of furnishing myself with neces*
saries, encouraged me to go beyond what I should
have been able to have done upon another occasion*
* My raft was now strong enough to bear any
reasonable weight; my next care was what to load
it with, and how to preserve what I laid upon it
from the surf of the sea; but I was not long con-
sidering this; I first laid all the planks or boards
upon it that I could get, and having considered
well what I most wanted, I first got three of the
seamen's chests, which I had broken open and
emptied,, and lowered them down upon my raft;
the first of these I filled with provisions, viz. bread,
?d£e, three Duteh cheesy five pieces of dried goat's
flesh, which we lived much upon, and>a little re-
mainder of European com which had bee% laid by
for some fowls which we brought m, js^i with us,
but th$ fQwl£ fwsr& JuUe&;< tke^e had been some
barley aijd wheat together, but, to my great disap-
pointment, I found afterwards that the rats had
eaten or spoiled it all; as for liquors, I found seve-
ral cases of bottles belonging to our skipper, in
which were some cordial waters, and in all above
five or six gallons of rack; these I stowed by
themselves, there being no need to put them into
the chest, nor no room for them. While I was
doing this, I found the tide began to flow, though
very calm; and I had the mortification to see my
coat, shirt, and waistcoat, which I had left on
shore upon the sand, swim away; as for my
breeches, which were only linen, and open-kneed,
I swam on board in them and my stockings: how*
ever, this put me upon rummaging for clothes, of
which I found enough, but took no more than I
wanted.for present use, for I had other things
which my eye was more upon; as, first, tools to
w,ork with on shore; and it was after long search-
ing that I found out the carpenter's chest, which
was indeed a very useful prize to me, and much
more valuable than a ship-loading of gold would
have been at that time: I got it down tp my raft,
even whole as it was, without losing time tp look
into it, for I knew in general what it contained.
My next care w;as .for some ammunition and
arms: there weie two very good fowling-pieces m
the great cabin, and two pistols; these I secured
fi^st, with some powder-horns,t and a small bag of
shot, and t\yo old rusjty swords: I knew there were
thiee barrels of powder in the ship, but knew not
where our gujiner had stowed them; but with
mush search I found them, twp of th^m dry and
gcrod, the third had taken water: those two T got
to my raft,' with the arms; and now I thought
myself pretty well freighted, and began to think
how I should get to shore with them, having nei-
* ther sail, oar, or rudder, and the least cap-full of
wind would have overset all my navigation.
I had three encouragements: 1. A smooth, calm
sea: 2. The tide rising and setting into the shore:
3. What little wind there was, blew me towards
the land: and thus, having found two or three
broken oars belonging to the boat, and besides the
tools which were in the chest, I found two saws,
an axe and a hammer, and with this cargo I put
to sea. For a mile, or thereabouts, my raft went
very well, only that I found it drive a little distafit
from the place where I had landed before, by
which I perceived that there wTas some indraft df
the water, and consequently I hoped to find some
creek or river there, which I might make use of
as a port to get to land with my cargo.
As I imagined, so it was; there appeared before
me a little opening of the land, and I found a
strong current of the tide set into it, so I guided
my raft as well as I could to keep in the middle
of the stream: but here I had like to have suffered
a second shipwreck, which, if I had, I think verily
would have broke my heart; for knowing nothing
of the coast, my raft run a-ground at one etad df
it Updii a shoal, and Hot being a-ground at th£
other end, it wanted but a little that all my cargo
had slipped off tovvards that end that was a float,
and so fallen into the water. I did my utmost, by
setting my back against the chests^ to kegp them
K
in their places, !bdt could not thrust off the raft
with all my Strength, neither durst I stir from the
posture I was in; but holding up the chests with
all my might, stood in that manner near half an
hour, in which time the using of the water brought
me a little more upon a level; and a little after,
the water still rising, my raft floated again, and I
thrust her off with the oar I had, into the channel;
&nd then driving up higher, I at length found my-
self in the mouth of a little river, with land on
both sides, and a strong current or tide running
up: 1 looked on both sides for a proper place to
get to shore, for I was not willing to be diiven
too high up the river, hoping in time to see some
ship at sea, and therefore resolved to place myself
a$ near the coast as I could.
At length I spied a little cove on the light shore
*>f. the cteek, to which, with great pain and diffi-
culty* I guided my raft, and at last got so near, as
that, reaching ground with my oar, I could thrust
-her directly in; but here I had like to have clipped
all my cargo in the sea again; for that shore lying
pretty steep, that is to s'ay slopipg, there, was no
place to land> but where one end of the float, if it
run on shores would lie so high, and the other sink
lower as before, that it would endanger my cargo
again: all that I could do, \vas to wait till the tide
was at the highest, kefcping-the raft with my oar
like an anchor to hold the side of it fast to the
shore, near a flat piece of ground, which 1 expected
the water would flow over; and so it did. As
soon as I found water enough (for my ratft drew
about a foot of water) I thrust heB oft' u^poh that
OV ROBIKSOX c&lsoe. 67
ftat p.^ece of ground, and there fastened or moored
hPX by t sticking my two broken oars into the
gTOUod; one on one side near one end, and one on
the other side near the other end; and thus I lay
till the water ebbed away, and left my raft and all
my cargo safe on shore.
My next work was to view the country* and
seek a proper place for my habitation, and where
tq,stow my goods, to secure them from whatever
might happen; where I was I yet knew not;
whether on the continent or on an island, whe-
ther inhabited or not inhabited, whether in dan-
ger of wild beasts or not: there was a-hill not
above a mile from me, which rose up very steep
qnd high, and which seemed to over-top some
other hills which lay as in a ridge from it north-
ward; I took out one of the fowling-pieces, and
one of the pistols, and an horn of powder, and
thus armed I travelled for discovery up to the top
of that hill, where, after I had with great labour
aijd difficulty got to the top, I saw my fates to
my great affliction, viz. that I was in an island
enyironed every way with the sea, no land to be
seqn, except some rocks which lay a great way
off> and two small islands leas than this, which
lay $bout three leagues to the west.
I found also that the island I was in was bar-
ren, and* as I saw good reason to believe, unin-
habited, except by wild beasts, of whom however
I saw i*o?ie;, yet I saw abundance of fowls* but
knew not their kinds, neither when I killed them
could I tell what was fit for food, and what not.
>Abn\y joining imck, 1 shot at^ great bitfd, which
k 2
I saw sitting upon a tree on the side of a great
Wood J. I believe it was the fiist gun that had been
fired there since the creation of the world. I had
no sooner fired, but from all the parts of the Wood
there ai^ose an innumerable number of fowls of
many sorts, making a confused screaming, and
Crying every one according to bis usual note; but
not one of them of any kind that I knew: as for
the creature I kiHed, I took it to be a kind of
hawk, its colour and beak resembling it, but had
no talons or claws more than common; its flesh
was carrion, and fit for nothing*.
Contented with this discoveiy, I came back to
my raft, and fell to work to bring my cargo op
shote, which took me up the rest of that day;
&nd what to do with myself at night I knew not,
nor indeed where to rest; for 1 was afraid to lie
down on the ground, not knowing but some wild
beast might devour me, though, as I afterwards
fotind, there was really no need for those fears.
However, as well as I could, I barricadoed my-
self round with the chests and boards that I had
brought on shore, and made a kind of a hut for
that night's lodging: as for food, I yet saw not
which way to supply myself, except that I had
seen two or three creatures, like hares, run-out of
the Wood where I shot the fowl.
I now began to consider, that I might yet get a
great many things out of the ship, which would
b& useful to me, and particularly some of the rig-
ging and sails, and such oth6r things as might
dome to land, and I resolved to make?ahother
voyage on board the vessel, if possible; and a$ I
knew that the first storm that blew must necessa-
rily rbveak her all ia pieces, I resolyed to set all
other* things apart, till I got every thing out of
the shipithat I could get: then I called a council,
that is to say, in my thoughts, whether I should
take back the raft; but this appeared imprac-
ticable; so I resolved to go as before, when the
tide was down, and I did so, only that I stripped
before I went from my hut, having nothing on
hat a chequered shirt, and a pair of linen trow-
sers, and a pair of pumps on my feet.
I got on board the ship, as before, and prepared
a second raft; and having had experience of the
first, I neither made this so unwieldy, nor loaded
it so hard; but yet I brought away several things
very useful to me; as first, in the carpenter's
stores, I found two or three bags full of nails and
spikes, a great screw-jack, a dozen pr two of
hatchets,-and above all, that most useful thing
called a grindstone: all these I secured, together
with several things belonging to the gunner, par-
ticularly two or three iron crows, and two barrels
pf musquet-bullets, seven musquets, and another
fowling-piece, with some small quantity of pow-
der ipore; a large bag full of small shot, and &
great roll of sheet lead; but thjs last was so heavy,
% could not hoist it up to get it over the ship's
$ide,, „ ,
n/$P9ide$ these things, X took all the men's
oloth.es that J,cpul4,$nd,» #nd a spare fore-top-sail,
haWKXOQk, ,apfl so^ne bedding; and with this I
Iqa^ded my ^copd rftftr,a,pd brought them all$afi?
pn sl)Qre, t^^n^vp^ gjceajt comfort-
I was under some apprehensions during my ab-
sence from the larkl, that at least my provisions
might be devoured on sliore; but when I cairfe
back, I found no sign of any visitor, only there
sat a creature like a wi'ld cat upon one of the
cheats, which, when I came towards it, ran away
a little distance, and then stood still: she sat very
composed, and unconcerned, and looked full in my
face, as if she had a mind to be acquainted with
me; I presented my gun at her, but as she did
not understand it, she was perfectly unconcerned
at it, nor did she offer to stir away; upon which
I tossedlier a bit of hiscuit, though by the wav
I was not very free of it, for my store was not
great: however, I spared her a bit, I say, and she
 went to it, smelled at it, ate it, and looked, as
pleased, for more; but I thanked her, and could
spare^ho more; so she marched off.
Having got my second cargo on shore, though I
was fain to open the barrels of powder, and bring
thfem by parcels, (for they were too heav}', being
Targe casks,) I went to work to make me a little
tent with the sail and some poles which I cut for
that purpose,- and into this tent I brought every
Ifhhig that I knew woulcl spoil, either with rain
of sun, and"I piled all ihe etnplly chests and casks
up ifr a circle round the tent, to fortify it from
any sudden attempt, eitbei; from man or beast.
When Ihad done this I blocked up the doof of
the tent witti some btiSrds witlifri, ancT an ^vhpty
chest feel!'lip all-end witfemt: 'and spreading one
or t\i6 beds upon the' gfttoiH^ la^irig my tw6 pisf
tols just at my h6ad, and-«ffy garifytf fe%tK by m&
I went fo bed for the first time, and slept very
quietly all night, for I was very weary and he^vy;
for the night before I had slept little; and had
laboured very hard all day, as well to fetch all
those things from the ship, as to get them on
shore,
I ha.d the biggest magazine of all kinds now,
that ever were laid up, I believe for one man; but
I was not satisfied still; for while the ship sat up-
right in that posture, I thought I ought to get
every thing out of her that 1 could: sp every day
at low water I went on board, and brought away
something or other; but particularly the third
time I went, I brought away as much of the rig-
ging as I could, as also all the small ropes and rope
twine I could get, with a piece of spare canvass,
which was to mend the sails upon occasion, and
the barrel of wet gun-powder: in a word, I hroMght
away all the sails first and last, only that I was
fain to cut them in pieces, and bring as much at a
time as I could; for they were no more useful to
be sails, but as mere canvass only.
But that whigh comfqrte^ me more still, was,
$bat, Jast of all, after t had made five or six such
voyages as these, and thought I had nothing more
to expect from the Ship tha,t was worth my med-
dling with; I say, aftev alj this, I found a great
hogshead of bread, and thre^ large runlets of rum
or spirits, and .a oqx of .sugar an4 a barrel of fine
$o$r: this was surprising, to me, because I had
givetf over expecting any more provisions, except
what w^s spoiled by the water: I soon emptied
the hogshead of that bread, and wrapped it up?
parcel by parcel, in pieces of the sails, whiclt I
cut out: and, in a word, I got all this safe on shore
also.
The next day I made another voyage; and now,
having plundered the ship of what was portable
and fit to hand out, I began with the cables-; and
cutting the great cable into pieces, such-as I could
move,'sI got two cables and a hawser on shore,
with all the iron-work I could get; and having
cut down the spritsaii-yard, and the mizen-yard,
and every thing I could to make a large raft, I
loaded it with all those heavy goods, and came
away: but my good luck began now to leave me;
for this raft was so unwieldy and so overladen,
that after I was entered the little cave, where I
had landed the rest of my goods, not being able
to guide it so handily as I did the other, it overset,
and threw me and all my cargo into the water.
As for myself Jit was no great harm, -for I was near
the shore; but as to my cargo, it was great part of
it lost, especially the iron, which I expected
would have been of great use to me : however,
when the tide was out, I got most of the pieces
of cable ashore; and some of the iron, though
with infinite labour; for I was fain to dip for it
into the water, a work which fatigued me very
hiuch. After this, I went every day on board,
and brought away what I could get.
I had been now 13 days on shor^, and had been
11 times on board the ship; in which time I had
brought away all that one pair of hands could well
be supposed capable to bring; though I believe
verily, had the calm weather held, I should have
VI i?
 ftaraitoa 
brought away the whole ship, piece by piece; but
preparing the 12th time to go on board, I found
the wind began to rise; however at low water I
went on board, and though I thought I had rum-
maged the cabin so effectually, as that nothing
more could be found, yet I discovered a locker
with drawers in. it, in one of which I found two
or three razors, and one pair of large scissars, with
some ten or a dozen of good knives and forks; in
another I found about thirty-six pounds value in
money, some European coin, some Brasil, some
pieces of eight, some gold, some silver,
I smiled to myself at the sight of this money.
O DrugJ. said I, aloud, what art thou good for?
thou art not worth to me, no not the taking off
of the ground: one of those knives is worth all
this heap: I have no manner of use for thee, even
remain where thou art and go to the bottom, as a
creature whose life is not worth saving. How-
ever upon second thoughts, I took it away, and
wrapping all this in a piece of canvas, I began to
think of making another raft; but while I was
preparing this, I found the sky over-cast, and the
wind began to rise, and in a quarter of an hour it
bkrw a fresh gale from the shore. It presently oc-
curred to me, that it was in vain to pretend to
make a raft with the wind off shore, and that it
was my business to be gone before the tide of flood
began, otherwise I might not be able to reach the
shore at all: accordingly I let myself down into
the water, and swam cross the channel, which lay
between the ship and the sands, and even that
with difficulty enough, partly with the weight o
things I had about me, and partly the roughness
of the water; for the wind rose very hastily, and
before it was quite high water it blew a storm.
But I was gotten home to my little tent, where
I lay with all my wealth about me very secure. It
blew very hard all that night; and in the morning
when I looked out, behold no more ship Was to be
seen: I was a little surprised, but recovered my-
self with this satisfactory reflection, viz. That I
had lost no time, nor abated any diligence to get
every thing out of her that could be useful to m&;
and that indeed there was little left in her that I
was able to bring away, if I had had more time.
I now gave over any more thoughts of the ship;
or of any thing out of her, except what might
drive on shore from her wreck, as indeed divers
pieces of her afterwards did; but those things
were of smaU'ttse to me.
My thoughts were now wholly employed about
securing myself against either savages (if any
should appear) or wild beasts, if any were in the
island; and I had many thoughts of the method
how to do this, and what kind of dwelling to make;
whether I should make me a caVe in the efarth, or
a tent upon the earth: and, in short, I fresolved
Upon both, of the manner and description of
which it may not be improper to give an ac-
count. • " "."l '
I soon found the place I was in was- Hot for my
settlement, particularly because it was Upon & fdw
moorish ground near the-sea, arid 1 belifeved #otild
riot be wholesome, arid more particularly beestuse
there was no fresh wateir near it; so I resolved to
0jr.|l0BJtir&ON CRUSOE. 75
find a fl^Qre healthy ^ndnaore convenient spot of
ground.
I consulted several things in my situation which
X.feqiid would be proper for me: 1st, Health, and
fresh water, I just now mentioned. 2dly, Shelter
from the heat of the sun. 3dly, Security from
ir^yenous creatures, whether man or beast. 4thlyf
A view to the sea; that if God sent any ship in
sight, I might not lose any advantage for my
deliverance, of which I was not willing to banish
jail T&y expectation yet.
In searqh of a place proper for this, I found a
little plain on the side of a rising hill, whosefront
towards this little plain was steep as a house-side,
so that nothing could come down upon me from
the top; on the side of this rock there was a hol-
low place*, worn a little way in, like the entrance
or door of a cave; but there was not really any
cave or way into the rock at all.
On the flat of the green, just before this hollow
place* I resolved to pitch my tent: this plain was
not above an hundred yards broad, and about
twice a& long, and lay like a green before my
4ooiy and a*t the end of it descended irregularly
every way down into the low grounds by the sea-
side. , It was on the N.N.W. side of the hill, so
tl^at I was sheltered from the heat every day, till
it came to a W. and by S. sun, or thereabouts,
which, in Jtjhose countries is near the setting.
Before I set up my tent, I drew a half circle
before the holk>w^place, which took in about ten
yajeds in its spai-diameter from the rock, and
twenty yarcls^its diaiti^terj from its beginning
and enditig.
• In this half circle I pitched two rows of strong
st&kes, driving them into the ground till they stood
very firm, like piles, the biggest end being out of
the ground about five foot and a half, and sharp-
ened on the top; the two rows did not stand above
six inches from one another.
Then I took the pieces of cable which I had cut
in the ship, and laid them in rows one upon an-
other, within the circle between these two rows
of stakes, up to the top, placing other stakes in
the inside, leaning against them, about two foot
and a half high, like a spur to a post; and this
fence was so strong, that neither man or beast
eould get into it or over it: this cost me a great
ddal of time and labour, especially to cut the piles
in the woods, bring them to the place, and drive
them into the earth.
The entrance into this place I made to be not
by a door, but by a short ladder, to go over the
top; which ladder, when I was in, I lifted over
after me; and so I was completely fenced in, and
fortified, as I thought, from all the world, and con-
sequently slept secure in the night, which other-
wise I could not have done; though; as it appeared
afterward, there was* no need of all this caution
from the enemies th&frl apprehended danger from.
Into this fence or-fortress, with infinite labour,
I carried all my riches, all my provisions, ammu-
nition and stores; of which you have the account
above; and I made*me a large tent, which, to pre-
®P SiaB/INSON eRTJ^OE. 77
&ew&me from the rains* .that in- one part of the
year are very violent there, I made double, viz.
one smaller tent within, and one larger tent above
tit,/* and'covered the uppermost with a large tar-
paulin which I had saved among the sails.
And now I lay no more for a while in the bed
which I had brought on shore, but in a hammock,
which was indeed a very good one, and belonged
to the mate of the ship.
, Into this tent I brought all my provisions, and
everything that would spoil by the wet; and hav-
ing thus enclosed all my goods, I made up the
entrance, which till now I had left open, and so
passed and repassed, as I said, by a short ladder.
When I had done this, I began to work my way
into- the rock,^ and bringing all the earth and
stones that I dug down, out through my tent, I
laid them up within my fence in the nature of a
terrace, that so it raised the ground within about
a foot and a half: and thus I made me 3. cave just
behind my tent, which served me like a cellar to
my house.
It cost me much labour, and many days, before
all these things were brought to perfection** and
therefore I must go * back to some other things
which took up some of my thoughts. At the
same time it happened, after I had laid my scheme
£oi\the setting up my tenti and making the cave,
that a sto^m^of rain falling from a thick dark cloud,
%,suddeus flash of light&ing happened, and after
that & great* >clap> of> thunder,^ as is naturally the
effeckof it:t J*wa§ not so^much surprised with the
lightning, as I was with a thought which darted
into my mind as swift as the lightning itself: O
my powder! my very heart sunk within rae, when
I thought, that at one blast all my powder might
be destroyed: on which, not my defence only,
but the providing me food, as I thought, entirely
depended; I was nothing near so anxious about
my own danger; though had the powder took
fire, I had never known who had hurt me.
Such impression did this make upon me, that
after the storm was over, I laid aside all my works,
my building, and fortifying, and applied myself
to make bags and boxes to separate the powder,
and to keep it a little and a little in a parcel, in
hope, that whatever might come, it might not all
take fire at once; and to keep it so apart, that it
should not be possible to make one part fire an-
other. I finished this work in about a fortnight;
and I think, my powder, which in all was about
240 pounds weight, was divided in not less than a
hundred parcels: as to the barrel that had been
wet, I did not apprehend any danger from that, s6
I placed it in my new cave, which in my fancy I
called" my kitchen; and the rest I hid up and
down in holes among the rocks, so that no wet
might come to it, marking very carefully where I
laid it.
In the interval of time while this was doing, I
went out once at least every day with my gun, as
well to divert myself, as to see if I could kill any
thing fit for food, and, as near as I could, to ac-
quaint myself with what the island produced. The
first time I went out I presently discovered that
there were goats in the island^ which was a great
satisfaction to me; but then it was attended with
thi£ misfortune to me, viz, that they were so shy,
so subtle, and so swift of foot, that it was the most
difficult thing in the world to come at them; but
I was not discouraged at this, not doubting but I
might now and then shoot one, as it soon hap-
pened; for after I had found their haunts a little,
I laid wait in this manner for them: I observed, if
they saw me in the vallies, though they were upon
the rocks, they would run away as in a terrible
fright; but if they were feeding in the valleys,
and I was upon the rocks, they took no notice of
me: from whence I concluded, that by the posi-
tion of their optics, their sight was so directed
downward, that they did not readily see objects
that were above them: so afterward I took this
method: I always climbed the rocks first, to get
above them, and then had frequently a fair mark.
The first shot I made among these creatures, I
killed a she-goat, which had a little kid by her,
which she gave suck to, which griet ed me heartily;
but when the old one fell, the kid stood stock still
by her till I came and took her up; and not only
so, but when I carried the old one with me upon
my shoulders, the kid followed me quite to my
enclosure, upon which I laid down the dam, and
took the kid in my arms, apd carried it over my
f>ale, in hopes to have bred it up tame, but it would
not eat, so I was forced to kill it a»nd eat it j^yself:
these two supplied me with flesh 3 great while, for
I eat sparingly; and saved my proyisions (piy
bread especially) as much as possibly I coul$.
Having now fixed my habitation, 1 found it ab~
solutely necessary to provide a place to tnake a
fire in, and fewel to burn; and what I did for that,
as also how I enlarged my cave, and what conve-
niences I made, I shall give a full account of in its
place: but I must first give some little account of
Inyself, and of my thoughts about living, which it
may well be supposed were not a few. \
1 had a dismal prospect of my condition; for as
I was not cast away upon that island without being
driven, as is said, by a violent storm quite out of
the course of our intended voyage, and a great
way, viz. some hundreds of leagues out of the
ordinary course of the trade of mankind, I had
great reason to consider it as a determination of
Heaven, that in this desolate place, and in this de-
solate manner, I should end my life. The tears
would run plentifully down my face when I tirade
these reflections, and sometimes I would expostu-
late with myself, why Providence should thus
completely ruin his creatures, and render them so
absolutely miserable, so without help abandoned,
so entirely depressed, that it could hardly be ra-
tional to be thankful for-stieh a life.
But something always returned swift upon me
to check these thoughts, *and> to reprove me; and
particularly one Jay, walking with my gun in my
hand by the sea-side, 1. was very pensive upon the
subject of my present eoiMkioa/when reason as
it wete expostulating with tt\6 the othsr way, thus-:
Well, you are in a desokt& edftdition, it is trues
but pray remember, *where~ are the^rest^ of you?
Did not you come eleven»of you! into^the boat?
Where are the ten? Why w&re^hey^fcot $|ve<& and
you lost? Why were you singled out? Is it better
to be here or there? and then I pointed to the
sea. All evils are to be considered with the good
that is in them, and with what worse attended
them.
Then it occurred to me again, how well I was
furnished for my subsistence, and what would have
been my case if it had not happened, which was
air hundred thousand to one, that the ship floated
from the place where she first struck, and was
driven so near the shore that I had time to get all
these things out of her: what would have been
my case if I had been to have livecf in the condi-
tion in which I at first came on shore, without ne-
cessaries of life or necessaries to supply and pro-
cure them? Particularly, said I aload, (though to
myself) what shoulcl I have done without a gun,
without ammunition, without any tools to make
any thing, or to work with; without clothes, bed-
ding, a tent, or any manner of covering: and thajt
now I ha4 all these to a sufficient quantity, afld
was in a fair way to provide myself in such a man-
ner, as to live without my gun when my ammuni-
tion was spentj ISO that I had a tolerable view o*f
subsisting, without any want, as long as I lived;
for X considered from the beginning how I should
provide for the accidents thgt might happen and
fQRjthe time that was tot come, e.vei^not only after
my ammunition should be spent* but ev^n after
my, health? or strength should de&ay.
I confess I foa^uot< entertained any notion o£
my ammunitionr beiiyg ^destroyed at on$ jblagt* I
meao my pow^r Jtei^g blpwn up by lightning;
and this made the thoughts of it so surprising to
me when it lightened and thundered, as I observed
just now:
And now being about to enter into a melancholy
relation of a scene of silent life, such perhaps as
was never heard of in the world before, I shall
take it from its beginning, and continue it in its
order. It was, by my account, the 30th of Sep-
tember, when, in the manner as abovesaid, I first
set foot upon this horrid island, when the sun
being, to us, in its autumnal equinox, was almost
just over my head; for I reckoned myself, by ob-
servation, to be in the latitude of 9 degrees 22
minutes north of the line.
After I had been there about ten or twelve days,
it came into my thoughts, that I should lose my
reckoning of time for want of books, and pen and
ink, and should even forget the sabbath days from
the working days; but to prevent this, I cut it
with my knife upon a large post in capital letters,
and making it into a great cross, I set it up on the
shore where I first landed, viz. I came on shore
h6re on the 30th of Sept. 1659. Upon the sides
o'f this square post, I cut every day a notch with
my knife, and every seventh notch Was as long
again as the rest, and every first day of the month
as long again as that long one; and thus I kept
my calendar, or weekly, monthly, and yearly reck-
oning of time.
In the next place we are to observe, that amoijg
the many things which I brought out of the ship
in the several voyages, which, as abovementioned,
I made to it,1 I got seVetal things of less value,
or HOBjjtfsoN Crusoe 83
but not all less useful to me, which I omitted set*
ting down before; as in particular, pens, ink, and
paper; several parcels in the captain's, mate's, gun-
ner's, and carpenter's keeping; three or four com-
passes, some mathematical instruments, dials, per-
spectives, charts, and books of navigation, all
which I huddled together, whether I might want
them or no: also, I found three very good bibles
which came to me in my cargo from England, and
which I had packed up among my things; some
Portugueze books also, and among them two or
three popish prayer-books, and several other books,
all which I carefully secured. And I must not
forget, that we had in the ship a dog and two cats,
of whose eminent history I may have occasion to
say something in its place; for I carried both the
cats with me; and as for the dog, he jumped out
of the ship of himself, and swam on shore to me
the day after I went on shore with my first cargo,
and Was a trusty servant to me many years; I
wanted nothing that he could fetch me, nor any
company that he could make up to me; I only
wanted to have Tiim talk to, me, but that he could
not do. As I observed befqrer I found pen, ink
and paper, and I husbanded them to the utmost;
and I shall shew, that while my ink lasted, I kept
things v^ry exact; but after, that was gone, I
could not; for I could not,make any ink, by am
means that I could devise.
And this put me \xi mind that I wanted many
things, notwithstanding all that I had amassed to-
gether; and of these this of ink was one, as also
spade, pick-axe and shovel, to dig or remove the
M 2
earth; needles, pins, and thread; as for linen* I
soon learned to want that without much difficulty.
This want of tools made every work I did go on
heavily, and it was near a whole year before I had
entirely finished my little pale or surrounded ha-
bitation : the piles or stakes, which were as heavy
as I could well lift, were a long time in cutting
and preparing in the woods, and more by far in
bringing home; so that I spent sometimes two days
in cutting and bringing home one of those posts,
and a third day in driving it into the ground; for
which purpose I got a heavy piece of wood at
first, but at last bethought myself of one of the
iron crows, which however, though I found it, yet
it made driving those posts or piles very laborious
and tedious work.
But what need I have been concerned at the
tediousness of any thing I had to do, seeing I had
time enough to do it in, nor had I any other
employment if that had been over, at least, that I
could foresee, except the ranging the island to seek
for food, which I did more or less every day.
I now began to consider seriously my condition,
and the circumstance I was reduced to, and I
drew up the state of my affairs in writing; not so
much to leave them to any that were to come
after me, for I was like to have but few heirs, as
to deliver my thoughts from daily poring upon
them, and afflicting my mind; and as my reason
began now to master my despondency, I began to
comfort myself as well as I could, and to set the
good against the evil, that 1 might have some-
thing to distinguish my case from worse j >and
*5
I stated rt very impartially, like debtor, and credi-
tor, the comforts I enjoyed against the miseries I
suffered, thus:

I have gotten out so many

or enable me to supply
myself even as long as I
live.
Upon the whale, here was an undoubted testi-
mony, that there was scarce any condition in the
world so miserable, but there was something nega-
tive or something positive to be thankful for in
it;, 2nd let this stand as a direction from the ex-
perience of the most miserable of all conditions in
this world, that we may always find in it some-
thing to comfort ourselves from, and to set in
the description of good and evil, on the credit side
of the account.
Having now brought my mind a little to relish
my condition, and given over looking out to sea,
to see if I could spy a ship; I say, giving over
these things, I began to apply myself to accom-
modate my way of living* and to make things as
easy to me as I could.
I have already described my habitation, wfcich
was a tent under the side of a rock, surrounded
with a strong pale of posts and cables, but I might
now rather call it a wall, for I raised a kind of
wall up against it of turfs, about two feet thick
on the outside, and after some time, I think it
was a year and a half, I raised rafters from it,
leaning to the rock, and thatched or covered it
with boughs of trees, and such things as I could
get to keep out the rain, which I found at some
times of the year very violent.
I have already observed how I brought all my
goods into this pale, and into the cave which I
had made behind me: but I must observe too that
at first this was a confused heap of goods, which
as they lay in no order, so they took up all my
place, 1 had no room to turn myself; so I set my-
self to enlarge my cave and works farther into
the earth; for it was a loose sandy rock, which
yielded easily to the labour I bestowed on it: and
so when I found I was pretty safe as to beasts of
prey, I worked sideways to the right hand into
the rock; and then, turning to the right again,
worked quite out, and made me a door to come
out, on the outside of my pale of fortification.
This gave me not only egress and regress, as it
were a back-way to my tent and to my store-house,
but gave me room to stow my goods.
And no w I began to apply sny $elf to make such
necessary things as I found I most wanted, parti-
cularly a chair and a table; for without these I
was not able to enjoy the few comforts I had in
the world; I could not write or eat, or do several
things with so much pleasure without a table.
So I went to work; and here I must needs ob*
serve, that as reason is the substance and original
of the mathematics, so by stating and squaring
every thing by reason, and by making the most
rational judgment of things, every man may be in
time master of every mechanic art. I had never
handled a tool in my life, and yet in time by la-
bour, application and contrivance, I found at last
that I wanted nothing but I.could have made it,
especially if I had had tools; however I made abun-
dance of things, even without tools,, and some
with no more tools than an adze arid a -hatchet,
which perhaps were never made that way before,
and that with infinite labour; for example, if I
wanted a board, I had no other way but to cut
down a tree, set it on an edge before me, and;hew
it flat on either side with my axe, till I had
brought it to be as thin as a plank^ and; then* dub
it smooth with my adze. It is true, by this me-
thod I could make but one board out of a whole
tree, but this I had no remedy for but patience,
any more than I had for the prodigious deal of time
and labour which it took me up to make a plank
or board: but my time or labour was little worth,
and so it was as well employed one way as another,
« However, I made me a table and a chair,' as I
observed above, in the first place, and this I did
out of the.short pieces of boards which I brought
on my raft from the ship: but when I had wrought
out some boards, as above, I made large shelves,
of the breadth of a foot and a half one over ano-
ther, all along one side of my cave, to lay all my
tools, nails, and iron-work, and in a word, to se-
parate every thing at large in their places, that I
might come easily at them; I knocked pieces into
the wall of the rock to hang my guns and ail
things that would hang up.
So that had my cave been to be seen, it looked
like a general magazine of all necessary things;
and I had every thing so ready at my hand, that
it was a great pleasure to me to see all my goods
in such order, and especially to find my stock of
all necessaries so great.
And now it was that I began to keep a journal
of every day's employment; for indeed at first I
was in too much a hurry; and not only hurry as
to labour, but in too much discomposure of mind,
and my journal would have been full of many dull
thirigs. For example, I must have said thus:
Sept. the 30th, after I got to shore, and had
escaped drowning, instead oO»eing thankful to
God for my deliverance, havin^Brst vomited with
the great quantity of salt water which was gotten
into my stomach, and recovering myself a little, I
ran about the shore, wringing my hands, and beat-
ing my head and face, exclaiming at my misery,
and crying out, I was undone, undone; till, tired
and faint, I was forced to lie down on the ground
te repose, but durst not sleep for fear of being de-
voured.
Some days after this, and after I had been on
board the ship, and got all that I could out of her*
yet I could not forbear getting up to the top of a
little mountain, and looking out to sea in hopes
of seeing a ship; then fancy at a vast distance I
spied a sail; please myself with the hopes of it;
and then, after looking steadily till I was almost
blind, lose it (Juite,* and sit down and weep like a
child, and thus increase my misery by my folly.
But having gotten over these things in some
measure, and having settled my household-stuff
and habitation, made me a table and a chair, and
all as handsome about me as I could, I began ta
keep my journal, of which I shall here give you
the copy (though in it will be told all these parti-
culars over again) as long as it lasted; for having
no more ink, I was forced to leave it off.
THE JOURNAL.
Sept. 30, 1659.
I poor miserall^WRobinson Crusoe, being ship-
wrecked, during a dreadful storm, in the offings
came on shore on this dismal unfortunate island,
which I called the Island of Despair, all the rest
of the ship's company being drowned, and myself
almost dead.
All the rest of that day I spent in afflicting my-
self at the dismal circumstances I was brought to,
viz I had neithetf food, house, clothes, weapon, of
place to fly to, and in despair of any relief, saw
nothing but death before me, either that I should
be devoured by wild beasts, murdered by savages,
or starved to death for want of food. At the ap-
proach of night I slept in a tree, for fear of wild
creatures^ but slept soundly though it rained all
night* '
October U In the morning I saw to my great
surprise, the ship had floated wjrth the high tide,
an& w^s driven on shore again much nearer the
islajnd^ which as it was some comfort on one hand,
for seeing her sit upright, and not broken to
pieces, I hoped, if the wind abated, I might get
on board, and get some food or necessaries out of
her for my relief; so on the other hand, it renewed
my grief at the loss of my comrades, who I ima-
gined if we had all staid on board might have saved
the ship, or at least that they would not have
been all drowned, as they were; and that, had the
men been saved, we might perhaps have built us
a boat out of the ruins of the ship, to have carried
us to some other part of the world. I spent great
part of this day in perplexing myself on these
things; but at length, seeing the ship almost dry,
Iswent upon the sand as near as I could, and then
swam on board; this day also it continued raining,
though with no wind at all. ,J
From the 1st of October to the 241&4 Ail these
days entirely spent in making several voyages to
get all I could out of the ship, which I brought
on shore, every tid$ of flood, upoo rafts. Much
rain also in these days, though with some intervals
of fair weather: but, it seems, this was the rainy
season*. m
Oct. 20. I overset my #a£t, and all the goods
I had got up upon it: but being in shoal water,
3nd the, things being chiefly heavy, I recovered
jnany of them when the tide was out.
Oct, 25.. Jt rained all night and* all day, with
some gusts of wind, during which time the ship

bro^e in pieces, the wind blowing a little harder
' than befofe, attiot was no more to be seen, except
the wreck of her, and that only at low water. I
spent this day in covering and securing the goods
which I had saved, that rain might not spoil
them.
Oct Q6. I walked about the shore almost all
day, to find out a place to fix my habitation,
greatly concerned to secure myself from any at-
tack in the night, either from wild beasts or men.
Towards night I fixed upon a proper place under
a rovqk, and marked out a semi-circle for my en-
vcampmdnt, ^whfch I resolved to strengthen with a
wark; wall, or fortification made of double piles,
lined jwidibi with cable* dnd without with turf.

Nov. 4. This morning I began to order my
times of work, of going out with my gun, time of
sleep, and time of diversion; viz, every morning
I walked out with my gun for two or thre hours,
if it did not rain, then employed myself to work
till about eleven o'clock, then eat what I had ta
live on, and from twelve to two I lay down to
sleep, the weather being excessive hot, and then
in the evening to work again 1 the working part
©if this day, and of the next, were wholly em-
ployed in making my table,-for I was yet but a,
very sorry workman, though time and necessity
made me a complete natural mectemiesoon after,
as I believe it would do any one else.
Nov* 5. This day went abroad with my gun
and my dog, and killed a wild cat, her skin pretty
soft, -but her flesh good for nothing: e^ery "crea-
ture I killed I took off the,skins and preserved
them. Coming back \>y th# sea-shore I saw many

to make me a chair, and with much ado brought
it to a tolerable shape, but never to please me;
and even in the making I pulled it in pieces several
times. Note, I soon neglected my keeping Sun-
daySf for omitting my mark for then) on myfpost,
I forgot which was which.
Nov. 13. This day it rained, which refieshed
me exceedingly, and cooled the eaith, but it was
accompanied with terrible thunder and lightning,
which flighted me dreadfully for fear of my pow-
der: as soQn as it was over I resolved to separate
n?y( stools of powder into as many little parcels a£
possiBlje, that it might not be in danger.
Nov. 14, 15, 16. These three days I spent in
making, little square chests or boxes, which might
hold about a pot^nd, or two pounds, at most, of
ppwder; and so putting the powder in, I stowed
it in places as secure and remote from one another
as possible. On one of these three days I killed a
large bird that was good to eat, but; I knew not
what to call it. ,
Nov. 17, T^his day I beg^nto dig behind my
tent into, the rock, to make room for my farther
conveniency. t Not£, fhijee^things I wanted ex-
ceedingly for this worl$, ^viz. a^pick-axe, a shove),
and a ;wheel-barrow or basket, ,so I desisted from
nrjr work* and be^an to consider how to supply
that want, and make me .some tools: as for a
pickaxe, I made use^ of tfye iron crows, which
were proper enough, though heavy; but thetnext
thing was a shovel orvsp^,de; this w$s so absolutely
necessary, that indeed I could do nothing effec-
ttiatly without it; but what kind of one to make
I knew not.
Nov. 18. The next day in searching the woods
I found a tree of that wood, or like it, which in
the Brasils they call the Iron Tree, for its exceed-
ing hardness; of this, with great labour and almost
spoiling my axe, I cut a piece, and brought it
home too with difficulty enough, for it was ex-
ceeding heavy.
The excessive hardness of the wood, and having
no other way, made me a long wrhile upon this ma-
chine; for I worked it effectually by little and
little into the form of a shovel or spade, the handle
exactly shaped like ours in England, only that the
broad part having no iron shod upon it at bottom,
it would not last me so long; however it-served
well enough for the uses which I had occasion to
put it to; but never was a shovel, I believe, fnade
after that fashion, or so long a making.
I was still deficient, for I wanted a basket or a
wheel-barrow: a basket I could not make by any
means, having no such things as twigs that would
bend to make wickerware, at least none yet found
out; and as to a wheel-frarrow, I fancied I could
make all but the wheel, but that I had no notion
of, rieither did I kiiow how to go about it; besides,
I had no possible way to make the iron gudgeons
for the spindle or axis 6f ttie w$eel to run in, s&t
gave it 6ver; and so' foi carrying aw^a/'the eartli
which I dugout! of the cave, i made me'a thing
like a hod which the labourersr Carry mortar in,
when they $6rVe the bricklayers ' *
This was not so difficult to me as the making the
shovel; and yet this, and the shovel, and the at-
tempt which I made in vain to make a wheelbarrow,
took me up no less than four clays, I mean always
excepting my morning walk with my gun, which
I seldom failed; and very seldom failed also bring-
ing home something to eat
Nov. 23. My other work having now stood still,
because of my making these tools, when they were
finished I went on, and working every day, as my
strength and time allowed, I spent eighteen days
entirely in widening and deepening my cave, that
it might hold my goods commodiously.
Note, During' all this time, I worked to make
this room or cave spacious enough to accommodate
me as a warehouse or magazine, a kitchen, a dining-
room, and a cellar; as for my lodging, I kept to
the* tent, except that sometimes in the wet season
of the year, it rained so hard that I could not keep
myself dry, which caused me afterwards to cover
all my place withifrimy pale with long poles in the
form of rafters^ leaning against the rock, and load
them with flags and large leaves of trees like a
thatch.
December 10. I begin now to think my cave
or vault finished, when on a sudden (it seems I had
made it too large) & great quantity of earth fell
down from the top and tone side, so much that in
short it frighted me, and not without reason too;
for if I had been under it Thad never wanted a
grave-digger; upon this disaster I had a great ddal
of work to do over again; for I had the loose earth
i^icapry.out, and, whieh.wartff -radrejiropbrt&nce,

o
time that I entertained a thought of breeding up
some tame creatures, that I might have food when
my powder and shot was all spent.
Dec. &8, %9, 30. Great heats and no breeze;
so that there was no stirring abroad, except in the
evening for food: this time I spent in putting all
my things in order within doors.
January 1. Very hot still, but I went abroad
early and late with my gun, and lay still in the
middle of the day. This evening, going farther
into the valleys, which lay towards the centre of
the island, I found there was plenty of goats,
though exceeding shy and hard to come at; how-
ever I resolved to try if I fcould not bring my dog
to hunt them down.
Jan. 2. Accordingly, the next day, I went out
with my dog, and set him upon the goats; but I
was mistaken, for they all faced about upon the
dog; and he knew his danger too well, for he
would not come near them.
Jan. 3. I began my fence or wall; which, being
still jealous of my being attacked by somebody, I
resolved to make very thick and strong.
N. B. This wall being described before, I
purposely omit what was said in the Jour-
nal; it is sufficient to observe, that I was
no less time than from the 3d of January
to the 14th of April, Working, finishing,
and perfecting this wall, though it was
no more than about 24 yards in length,
being a half circle from one place in the
rock to another place about eight yards
<m romstson crusoe. 99
from it, the door of the cave being in
the centre behind it.
All this time I worked very hard, the rains hin-
dering me many days, nay, sometimes weeks toge-
ther; but I thought I should never be perfectly
secure until this wall was finished; and it is scarce
credible what inexpressible labour every thing was
done with, especially the bringing piles out of the
woods, and driving them into the ground, for I
made them much bigger than I need to have done.
» When this wall was finished, and the outride
double fenced with a turf-wall raised up close to
it, I persuaded myself that if any people were to
come on shore there, they would not peiceive any
thing like a habitation; and it was very well I did
so, as may be observed hereafter upon a very re-"
markable occasion.
During this time I made my rounds in the woods
for game every day, when the rain admitted me,
and made frequent discoveries in these walks of
something or other to my advantage; particularly
I found a kind of wild pigeons, who built not as
wood pigeons, in a tree, but rather as house pigeons,
in the holes of the rocks; and taking some young
ones, I endeavoured to breed them up tame, and
did so; but when they grew older they flew away,
which perhaps was at first for want of feeding
them, for I had nothing to give them; however I
frequently found their nests, and got their young
ones, which were very good meat.
And now, in the managing my household affairs,
I found myself wanting in many things, which I
thought at first it was impossible for me to make,
o2

^s indeed,, as to^ome of them* it was; for instance,
I could never rqak^ a qask, to be hooped: T bad a
Wall runlet or,two, as I observed before, but I
co#Ul never arrive to the capacity of making, one
by .them, though I spent manyf weeks about it; I
could neither put in the. heads, or joint the staves
so true to one another as to make them hold watery
so I gav£, that also over.
In the next place, I was at a great loss for can-
dle; so that as soon as ever it was dark, which
was generally by seven o'clock, I was obliged to
go to bed: I remembered the lump of bees-wax
with which I made candles in my African adven-
ture, but I had none of that now; the only remedy
I had, w$s, that when I had killed a goat I saved
thp tallow, and with a little dish made of clay,
whicji I baked in the sun, to which I adde&a wick
of some oakum, I made me a lamp; and thia gave
mte, %ht, though not a clear steady light like a
candle. In the middle of ail my labours it hap-
pened, that run^m^ging my things, I found a little
bag, which, as I lifted before, had been filled with
com for the feeding of poultry—not for this voy-
age, but before,, a,s I suppose, when the ship came
from tLisbon; wh$f little remainder of corn had
been in the b^g, wa£ &M ^devoured with the rats,
anfl I saw noting,in the bag but husks and dust;
and being willing to have the bag for some other
us^ J4 tj)in}< it was to put powder an, when I di-
vided it for fear of the* lightning, or * some such
use;, I shook the hysks of corn out of it on one side
of my fortification under the rock.
It was a little beforqfjthe gceajt mm, just now

mentioned, that I threw this stuff away, taking no
-notice-of any thing, and not so much as remem-
bering that I had throwii anything there; when
about a month after, or thereabout, I saw some
few stalks of something green shooting out of the
ground, which I fancied might be some plant I
had not seen; but I was surprised and perfectly
astonished, when after a little longer time I saw
about ten or twelve ears come out, which were
perfect'green- barley of the same kind as our Euro-
pean, nay, as our English barley.
d -It is impossible to express the astonishment and
confusion of my thoughts on this occasioxl; I had
hitherto acted upon no religious foundation at all;
indeed I had very few itotions of religion in my
head* o® had entertamed any sense of any thing
that had befallen me, otherwise than as a chance;
or, as we lightly sa}y what pleases God; without
so mu;ch as inquiring info the end of Providence
in these things, or his order in governing events
in the world; but after I saw barley grow there,
in a climate which I knew was not proper for corn,
and especially that I knew not how it came there,
it startled me strangely; and I began to suggest,
that God had miraculously caused this grain to
gmw without any help of seed sown, and that it
was so directed purely fbr my sustenance on that
wild miserable place.
This touched1 my heart a little, and brought
tears out of my eyes, and I began to bless myself,
that such a prodigy of nature should happen upon
my account; and this was the more strange to me,
because I saw eeafcffc stilly all along by the side of
102 LIIJE.ANB A^VE^XURES
the rock, some other straggling stalks, which
proved tp be stalks of rice, and which I knew, be-
cause I had seen it grow in Africa, when I was
ashore there.
I not only thought these the pure productions
of Providence for my support, but not doubting
but that there was more in the place, I went all
over that part of the island, where I had been be-
fore, peeping in every corner and under every rock
to see for more of it, but I could not find any; at
last it occurred to my thought, that I had shook
a bag of chickens meat out in that place, and then
the wonder began to cease; and I must confess,
my religious thankfulness to God's providence
began to abate tQO, upon discovering that all this
was nothing but what was common; though I
ought to Ixave been as thankful for so strange and
unforeseen a providence as if it had been miracu-
lous; for it was really the work of Providence as
to me, that should order or appoint ten or twelve
grains of corn to remain unspoiled, when the rats
had destroyed all the rest, as if it had been dropped
fiom heaven: a<s also, that I should throw it out
in that particular place, >vhere, it being in the
shade of a high rock, it sprang up immediately;
whereas if I had thrown it any where else at that
time,, it had been, burnt up and destroyed.
I carefully $aved the eais qf corn, you may be
sure, in their seasqp,, which wa3 abfqut the end of
June, aftd laying up pvery corn, J resolved to sow
them all again, hoping, in time to bay# some quan-
tity sufficient to jsupply me with, bi;ead; but it was
i^ot till the fourth year thaf I qoq^d $\\pw jpyself
the least grain of this corn to eat, and even then
but sparingly, as I shall say afterwards in its order;
for I lost all that I sowed the first season, by not
observing the pioper time; for I sowed it just be-
fore the dry season, so that it never came up at all,
at least not as it would have done: of which in
its place.
Besides this barley, there were, as above, twenty
or thirty stalks of rice, which I preserved with the
same care, and whose use was of the same kind or
to the same purpose, viz. To make me bread, or
rather food; for I found ways to cook it up with-
out baking, though I did that also after some time.
But to return to my journal.
I worked excessive hard these three or four
months to get my wall done; and the 14th of
April I closed it up, contriving to go into it, not
by a door, but over the wall by a ladder, that there
might be no sign in the outside of my habitation.
April 16. I finished the ladder, so I went up
with the ladder to the top, and then pulled it up
after me, and let it down on the inside: this was
a complete enclosure to me,4 for within I had room
enough, and nothing could cofne at me from with-
out, unless it could first mount iny wall.
The very next day ^fter * this' Svall was finished,
I had almost had all mV l&bbuf overthrown at once,1
and thyself killedj the fcasd Was thus: As I was
ba$y ih the inside 6f it; 'biehind my terit, just in

the top of ,my?cave was faffing in, as same of it had
tdom before,; and for fear I should be buried in: it,
I ran forward to my ladder; and not thinking my-
self safe there neither, I got over my wall for fear
of the pieces of the hill which I expected might
rojll down upon me: I was no sooner $teppe4down
Vpon the fir^i ground, but I plainly saw it was.a
$enihle, earthquake, for the ground I stoqd on
sh®ok, th^ee tinges at about eight minutes distftnice,
with th^ee such shocks, as would have overtmwd
^the, strongest, building th^t could be supposed *o
<h*av§ stpod^a the earthy and a great piece >of the
top of a rock, which stood about half a mile from
me ne^t the sea, fell down with such a terrible
noise as I never iheard in all my life: I perceived
3-lso the very sea was put into violent motion by
itj $nd I believe the shocks were stronger under
the water than on the island.
I was so amazed with the thing itself, having
aever felt the like, or,discoursed with anyone that
had, that I was like <in& dtead or stupified; and
the -motion of; the* earth ^made my stomach siek,
4ike one that was tossed, at sea; 'but ?the noise t)f

Aftir'the third shodt was( Over, and I felt no
tfiorfe for Sortie time, I began to take courage, and
yeft I had not heart enough to get over my wall
&gairl, for fear of being buried alive, but sat still
upon the ground, greatly cast down and disconso-
late, not knowing what to do: all this while I had
Hdt the least serious religious thought, nothing
but the common, Lord have mercy upon me; and
when it was over, that went away too.
While I sat thus, I found the air overcast, and
grow cloudy, as if it would rain; soon after that
the'wind rose by little and little, so that in less
than half an hour it blew a most dreadful hurri-
cane? the sea was all on a sudden covered 6ver
with fqani and froth, the shore was covered with
the breach of the water, the trees were torn up by
the roots, and a terrible storm it was; and this
held about three hours, and then began to abate,
and in two hours more it was stark calm, and began
to rain very hard.
All this while I sat upon the ground, very much
terrified and dejected, when on a sudden it came
into my thoughts, that these winds and rain being
the consequence of the Earthquake, the earthquake
itself was spent and over, and I might Venture
into my cave again: with this thdught my spirits
began to revive, &nd the rain also helping to per-
suade *ne, I went hs*atndsat*towrt in my tent, but
the faih was so v»ioleft&| that my tent was ready to
be beaten do*wn ^itii *k? and I was forced to go
into ntfy^rnvfe; though "vetymttoh afraid and uneasy,
for fear it%shouldf fallotMny head. ^
Thisrviolent rainifereed rm to anew work, viz.
p
106 LI£& YAKD ABVJ£HtftiJM)8
to eu& a hole through* my new fortification like a
sink to let water go out, which would else have
drowned my cave. After I had been in my cave
some time> and found still" no more shocks' of the
earthquake follow, 1 began to be more composed;
and now, to support my spirits, which indeed
wanted it very much, I went to my little store,
and took a small sup of rum, which however I did
then, and always, very sparingly, knowing I could
have no more when that was gone.
It continued raining all that night, and great
part of the next day, so that I could not stir
abroad; but my mind being more composed, I
began to think of what I had best do, concluding,
that if the island was subject to these earthquakes,
there would be no living for me in a cave, but I
must consider of building me some little hut in an
open place, which I might surround with a wall
as I had done here, and so make myself secure
from wild beasts or men: but concluded* if I staid
where I was, I should certainly, one time or other,
be buried alive.
With these thoughts I resolved to remove my
tent from the place where it stood, which was just
tinder the hanging precipice of the hill, &nd which,
if it should be shaken* again*, would certainly fall
upon my tent: and I spent the twO next days>
being the lflth and^Oth of April, in contriving
where and how to remove my habitation* ^
The fear of being swallowed up alive, made tee
that I never skpt in^iet; and yetthe^appreheifc-
sion of lying abroad* wi&fcbou* afry fdjtice, was atoo^t
equal to it; but still, whe^I looked ikwtwaAGVw

JioW eiery thing was* pu* in order,, how pleasantly
conceded I was, and how safe from danger^ it

in the mean time "it occurred to me that it
would require avast deal of time for me to do this*
tad ttiat I must be contented to run the venture
\yhere I was, till I had formed a camp for myself,
and had secured it so as to remove to it; so with
this resolution I composed myself for a time, and
resolved that I would go to work with all speed to
build me a wall with piles and cables, &c. in a
circle as before; and set my tent up in it when it
was finished, but; that I would venture to stay
where I wars till it was finished and fit to remove
to. This was th£ Slstr
April <&%. The next morning I began to consi-
der of means to put this resolve in execution, but
I was at a great loss about my tools?; I had three
large axes and abundance of hatchets, (for we
carried thfe hatchets for traffick with the Indians)
but with much chopping and cutting knotty hard
wood, they were all full of notches and dull, and
though I had a grind-stone* I could not turn* it &nd
grind my tools too: this cast me as much thought
as a statesman would have'bestowed upon a grand
point of politics, or a judge upon the life and death
of a man. At length I contrived a wheel with a
strings to turn it withNmy foot; that I might have
both my hands- at liberty* ^Note, I had never $e@&

low a great while, now I took a survey of it, and
reduced myself to one biscuit cake a day, which
made my heait very heavy.
May 1. In the morning, looking towards the
sea-side, the tide being low, I saw something lie
on the shore bigger than ordinary; and it looked
lite ahCa&k. When I came to it, I found a small
barrel, and two or three pieces, of the wreck of
lite ship, which were driven on shore by the late
hurricane; and looking towards the wreck itself,
1 thought it seemed to lie higher out of the water
thah it used %to do: I examined the barrel which
wascdriven on shore, and soon found it was * a
barrel of gunpowder, but it h^d taken water, and
the powder was caked as hard as a stone; however
I'foiled it farther on* shore for the present, and
wdnt On upon the saftds^as near as I cquld to the
^rreck of the ship, to^klor-more^ >

whereas there was a great place of water before,
of mo&ffim® Cftusos* 109
so that'll could not eomz milhm a* quar^r of a
mile of the wreck without swimming, I coald now
walk quite-u£ to htr when the tide was out. I was
surprised with this at first, but soon concluded it
must be done by the earthquake: and as by this
violence the ship was more broken open than for-
merly, so many things came daily on shore, which
the sea had loosened, and which the winds and
water rolled by degrees to the land.
This wholly diverted, my thoughts from the de-
sign of removing my habitation; and I busied my*
self mightily that day especially, in searching
whether I could make any way into the ship; bvA
I found nothing was to be expected of that kj^dj
for that all the inside of the ship was chocked i^p
with sand: however, as I had learnt not to despak
of any thing, I resolved to pull every thing-to
pieces that I could of the ship, concluding, that
every thing I could get from her would b$ of some
use or other to me.
May 3. I began with my saw, and cut a piece
of a beam through, which I thought held some
of the upper part or quarter-deck together; and
when I had cut it through, I cleared away the
sand as well as I eonldiftonv the side wbich/iay
highest; but the tide coming in, I was obliged to
give over for that time. -

caught fish enough, as much as I cared to eat; all
which I dried in the sun, and eat them dry.
May 5. Worked on the wreck, cut another
beam asunder, and brought three great fir planks
off from the decks, which I tied together, and
made swim on shore when the tide of flood came
on.
May 6. Worked on the wreck, got several iron
bolts out of her, and other pieces of iron-work;
worked very hard, and came home very much
tired, and had thoughts of giving it over.
May 7. Went to the wreck again, but with an
intent not to work, but found the weight of the
wreck had broke itself down, the beams being
cut, that several pieces of the ship seemed to lie
loose; atid the inside of the hold lay so open, that
I could see into it, but almost full of water and
saifd.
May 8. Went to the wreck, and carried an iron
crow to wrench up the deck, which lay now
quite clear of the water or sand; I wrenched open
two planks, and brought them on shore also with
the tide: I left the iron crow in the wreck for
next day.
May 9. Went1 to the wreck, and with the crow
madfe way into the body of the wreck, and felt
sfeVeral casks, and loosened them with the crow,
but could not break them up; I felt also the roll of
English lead, and eould stir it, but it was too
heavy to remove.
Mai|y io, 11, 12, 13, 14, Went everyday to the
wreekj and got a great ipfiny pieces pf timt>eir?
and boards, or plank, and two or three hundred
weight of iron.
May 15. I carried two hatchets, to try if I
could ilot cut a piece off the roll of lead, fry
placing the edge of one hatchet, and driving it
with the other; but as it lay about a foot and a
half in the water, I could not make any blow to
drive the hatchet.
May 16. It had blowed hard in the night, and
the wreck appeared more broken by the force of
the water; but I staid so long in the woods to get
pigeons for food, that the tide prevented roe going
to the wreck that day.
May 17* I saw some pieces of the wreck blown
on shore, at a great distance, near two miles off
me, hut resolved to see what they were, and fpund
it was a piece of the head, but too heavy for me
to bring away.
May 24. Every day to this day I worked on
the wreck, and with hard labour I loosened some
things so much with the crow, that the first blow-
ing tide several casks floated out, and two of the
seamen's chests; but the wind hlowing from t,h&
shore, nothing came to land, tba£ day but pieces
of timber, and a hogshead, yrhich had son\e Bra-
zil pork in it, but the salt water and the s^nd had
spoiled it* i
^continued this work eyer^ day to the kStliQ^
June/except'the time necessary to get fqQd^whic!^
I always appointed,, during this<p&rt Gf piy employ-
ment, to He" when the tide was up^ that I migjbfc
fee ready when it was ehhed out; and by this time
I had gotten timber, and plank, and iron-work
enough to have built a good boat, if I had known
how; and also, I got at several times, and in seve-
ral pieces, near 100 weight of the sheet-lead.
June 16. Going down to the sea side, I found
a large tortoise or turtle; this was the first I had
seen, which it seems was only my misfortune, not
any defect of the place, or scarcity; for had I
happened to be on the other side of the island, I
might have had hundreds of them every day; as I
found afterwards; but perhaps had paid dear
enough for them.
June 17. I spent in cooking the turtle; I found
in her threescore eggs; and her flesh was to me at
that time the most savoury and pleasant that ever
1 tasted in my life, having had no flesh, but of
goats and fowls, since I landed in this horrid
pla<;e.
June 18. Rained all day, and I stayed within.
I thought at this time the rain felt cold, and I was
something chilly, which I knew was not usual in
that latitude.
June 1£). Very ill, and shivering, as if the wea-
ther had been cold.
June 20. No rest all night, violent pains in
my head, and feverish.
June 21. Very ill, frighted almost to death

June 26. Better; and having no victuals to eat,
took my gun, but found myself very weak; how?
ever I killed a she-goat, and with much difficulty
got it home, and broiled some of it, and eat; I
would fain have stewed it, and made some broth,
|)ut h^ad no pot.
_ June 27* The ague again so violent, that I lay
^-bed all day, and neither eat or drank. I was
Ceacjy to perish for thirst, but so weak I had not
strength to stand up, or to get myself any water
to drink: prayed to God again, but was light-
headed; and when I was not, I was so ignorant
fhaj I knew not what to say; only I lay and criecj,
Lord look, upon me; Lord pity me; Lord have
mercy upon me; I suppose I did nothing else for
two or three hours, till the fit wearing off, I fell
asleep, and did not wake till far in the night; when

and exceeding thirsty; however, as I had nd water

ground with his feet I thought the" earth trem-
bled, just as it had done before in the earthquake,
and all the air looked to my apprehension as if it
had been filled with flashes of fire.
He was no sooner landed upon the earth, but he
moved forward towards me, with a long spear or
weapon in his hand to kill me; and when he .came
to a rising ground, at some distance, he spoke to
me, or I heard a voice so terrible, that it is impos-
sible to express the terror of it; all that I can say I
•understoodwas this, 'Seeing all these things have
not; brought thee to repentance, now thou shaifc
die:' at which words I thought he lifted up the
spear that was in his hand to kill me.
No one, that shall ever read this account, will
expect that I should be able to describe the horrors
of my soul at this terrible vision; I mean, that
even while it was a dream, I even dreamed of
those horrors; nor is it any more possible to de-
scribe the impression that remained upon my mind,
when I awaked, and found it was but a dream.
I had, alas! no divine knowledge; what I had
received by the good instruction of my father was
then worn out by an uninterrupted series, for eight
years, of sea-farjng wickedness, and a constant
ponversation with- nothing but such as were liks
myself, wicked and profane to the last degree:

tioil Wpon my own ways-: tmt a certain stupidity
of sotH, 'without desire of'good, of Conscious of
evil, had entirely overwhelmed me, and I'was
aW that the most hardened, unthinking, wicked
creature among our common sailors can be sup-
posed to be, not having the least sense, either of
the fear of God in danger, or of thankfulness to
GbD in deliverances.
In the relating what is already past of my story,
this will be the more easily believed, when I shall
add, that through all the variety of miseries that
had to this day befallen me, I never had so much
as one thought of it being the hand of'Gob, or
that it was a just punishment for my sin, my re-
bellious behaviour against my father, or m3r present
sins, which were great; or so much as a punish-
ment for the general course of my wicked life.
When I was on the desperate expedition on the
desert shores of Africa, I never had so much a$
one thought of what would become of me; or one
wish to God to direct me whither I should go, or
to keep me from the danger which apparently sur-
rounded me, as well from voracious creatures as
cruel savages: but I was merely thoughtless of a
God, or a Providence; acted like a mere brute from
the principles of nature, and by the dictates of
common sense only, and indeed hardly that.

drowning on this island, I was as far from remorse,
or looking on it as a judgment; I only said to my-
self often, that I was an unfortunate dog,1 and boin
to* fee always miserable.
<- It is true, when I got on shore first here, and
found all my ship's crew drowned, and myself
spared, I was* surprised with a kind of ecstasy, and
some transports of soul, which, had the grace of
God assisted, might have come up to true thank-
fulness; but it ended where it begun, in a mere
common flight of joy, or, as I may say, being glad
I was alive, without the least reflection upon the
distinguishing1 goodness of the hand which had
preserved me, and had singled me out to be pre-
served, when all the rest were destroyed; or an
inquiry why Providence had been thus merciful to
me;' even just the same common sort of joy which
seamen generally have, after they have got safe
on shore from a shipwreck, which they drown all
in the next bowl of punch, and forget, almost asv
sootiw ft is over; and all the rest of my life was
lifce it*

The growing up ,of fhp corn, as is hinted in my
journal, had at first some little influence upon me,
a$d began to affect me with seriousness, as long as
I thought it had something miraculous in it;, but
astsoon as ever that part of thought was removed,
all the impression which was raised from it wore
oif^lso, as I have nQted already.
Even the earthquake, though nothing could be
mare terrible in ,ite nature, or more immediately
c}i reefing to the invisible power, which alone directs
suqh things; yet no sooner was the £f$t irigbt

like praying to G&t>, though I dantiot say th^y
were either a prayer attended with desires, or with
hopes; it was rather the voice of mete fright and
distress^: my thoughts were confused, the convic-
tions great upon my mind, and the horror of dying
in such a miserable condition, raised vapours into
my head with the mere apprehensions; and, in
these hurries of my soul, I knew not what my
tongue might express. But it was rather exclama-
tion; such as, Lord! what a miserable creature am
14 If I should be sick, I shall certainly die foi%
want of help, and what will become of me? Then
the tears burst out of my eyes, and I could say no
more for a good while.
In this interval the good advice of my father
cattle Jto ttty iriifcd, and presently his prediction,
which I mentioned in the beginning of this story;
viz. That if I did'take this foolish step, God would
itot folfcss me, and* I would have leisure hereafter
to retfltect upon having neglected his counsel, when
there might be none to assist in my recovery.
Now, said I aloud, my dear father's words are
come to pass/ God's justice has overtaken me, and
I have3 none to help br hear me; I rejected the
vdice of Prbvitfefrce;- ^hfch had mercifully put me

for even nature itself to support, and no assistance,
no help, no comfort, no advice. Then X cried out,
Lord, be my help, for I am in great distress!
This was the first prayer, if I might calL it so,
that I had made for many years. But I return to
my journal.
June &8. Having been somewhat refreshed with
the sleep I had had, and the fit being entirely off,
I got up: and thougli the fright and terror of my
dream was very great, yet I considered, that the
fit of the ague would return again the next day,
and now was my time to get something to refresh
and support myself when I should be ill; and the
first thing I did, I filled a large square case bottle
with water, and set it upon my tabler in reach of
my bed* and to take off the chill or aguish dispo-
sition of the water, I put about a quarter of a pint
of rum into it, and mixed them together: tfren £
got me a piece of t;he goat's flesh, and broiled it
on the coals, but could e^t ^fpyyi little. , J walked
about, but was very weak* and, withal, very sad
and heavy-hearted under 3. sensej of my miserable
condition, dreading thp r^turn^of my .distemper
the next day: at night I made.rny ^upper of three
gf tfce turtle's eggs, which, I routed in the ^sbes,
and eat, as we call it, ia„|Jie shgllj^and this was
the first bit of m^a*t I had^ver asl^ed Qoy's bless-
ing stp, $ven, as I CQuld. r£t$epiber,t in my whole
life
After I had e^en |tti^e4 *Q^alkJ but^fpuipi
myself so,we^ thsMj t^ul^b^r^cjarry fye gun
(for I never yvent ou^ wjthp^ut^t)^t)^*sa I Mfent
but a little way,, and sat down upon the ground,
looking out upoft the sevwhifch was just before
me, and very calm and smooth. As I sat here,
some such thoughts as these occurred t6 me:—
What is the earth and .sea, of which I have seen
so much? Whence is it produced? And what am
I, and ail the other creatures, wild and tame, hu-
man and brutal; whence are we?
Sure we are all made by some secret power, who
formed the earth and sea, the air and sky; and
who is that?
Then it followed, most naturally: it is God that
has made it all. Well, but then it came on strangely;
if God has made all these things, he guides and
governs them all, and all things that concern them;
for the Being that could make all things, must
certainly have power to guide and direct them.
If so, nothing can happen in the great circuit
of his works, either without his knowledge or ap-
pointment.
% And jf nothing happens without his knowledge,
he knows that I am here, and am in a dreadful
condition; and if nothing happens without his
appointment, he has appointed all this to befall me.
Nothing occurred to my thoughts to contradict
any of these conclusions; and therefore it rested
upon me with the greater force, that it must needs
be, that God had appointed all this to befall me;
that I was brought to this miserable circumstance
by his direction, he having the-sole power, not cff
me only, but of every thing that happened in the
world. Immediately it followed,
Why has God dpi^e this to snt^Whafc kme I
done to be thus used?
My conscience presently checked me in that
inquiry >as if I, had blasph€rtie$;<?and'methoBght
it spoke to -me, Like a voice; Wretch! d&st thou
ask what thou hast done? Look back upon a dread-
ful misspent life, and asfc thyself What (hou hast not
done? Ask, why is it that ihou wert mot long ago
destroyed? Why wert thou not drowned in Yar-
mouth Roads? killed in the fight when the ship
was taken by the Sallee man of war? devoured by
the wild beasts on the coast of Africa? or, drowned
HERE, when all the crew perished but thyself*
Dost thou ask, What have I done?
I was struck with these reflections as one asto-
mishedj and had not a word to say, no, not to an-
swer to myself; but rose up pensive and sad,
walked back to my retreat, and went tip over my
wall, as if I had been going to bed; but my thoughts
were sadly disturbed, and I* had -no inclination to
sleep; so I sat down in my chair, and lighted my
lamp, for it began to be dark. Now, as the ap-
prehensions of the return of my distemper terrified
me very much, it occurred to my thought, that
the Brasilians take no physic but their tobacco,
for almost all distempers? antf I had £ piece of a
roll of tobacco in otte< of-the «fiests, which was
quite cured, and some also' that was gteen, and
not quite cured - *-»***
I went, directed*^ H&veii, no doubt! f6r in
this^ chest I found Satire-Both for-soul and body!
I opened the chesty atid^oaiid-what I- fooked for,
viz. Hb&lxfo&a*? tenArfofr tfteiftw-beMs 1 hdd saved
lay there too, 14&5k mt one of-$ie bibles which
I mentioned* be&fce, Ind Whi^h; td this time, I had
iiotfouud leisure, or so much arfodmatioii, to
look into; I saty I took it out, and brought both
that and the tobacco with me to the table.
What use to iw&ke of the tobacco I kne\t not,
as to my distemper, or whether it was good for it
or no; but I tried several experiments with it, as
if I resolved it should hit one way or other: I first
took a piece of a leaf, and chewed it in my mouth,
which indeed at first almost stupified my brain,
the tobacco being green and strong, and that I
had not been much used to it; then I took some,
and steeped it an hour or two in some rum, and
resolved to take a dose of it when I lay down j
and lastly, I burnt some* upon a pan of coals, and
held my nose close over the smoke of it, as long
as I could bear it, as well for the he&t as the virtue
of it, and I held almost to suffocation*
In the interval of this operation I took up the
bible, land began to read; but nty head was too
much disturbed with the tobacco to bear reading,
at least at that time; only having Opened the botfk
casually, the first words that occurred to' me were
these, " Call on me in the day of trouble, and I will
deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me."
The words \ve?e very apt to my case, and made
some impression upbn (tny thoughts at the time of
reading them, though not so much as they did
afterwards j for, as "for being delivered, th^ word
had no sound, a* I iftay say/ to me; the thing was
so remote, feo ifripfcssibte lin my apprehension of
things, that I began to say as the children of Israel
did when thtey were promised* ffesh to eat, **iCan
God spread-a teblefa itofc-ttildetfiftWr'* So £began
tp say, Can Go© himself dfelivter^iiite from' ehis
!place?f <Av& a& it was not fer»mfany years that any
hope appeared, this prevailed very often upon my
thoughts; hut, .however, the words made a very
great impression upon me, and I mused upon them
very often. It grew now late, and the tobacco
•had, as I said, dozed my head so much, that I in-
clined to sleep; so that I left my lamp burning in
the cave, lest I should want any thing in the night,
and went to bed: but before I lay down, I did
-what I never had done in all my life; I kneeled
down and prayed to Gob to fulfil the promise to
me, that if I called upon him in the day of trouble,
he would deliver me. After my broken and im-
perfect prayer was over, I drank the rum in whidi
I had steeped the tobacco, which was so strong
and rank of the tobacco, that indeed I could scarce
get it down. Immediately upon this I wejit to
bed, and I found presently it flew up into my head
violently; but I fell into a sound sleep, and waked
no more, till by the sun it must necessarily be neaf
three o'clock in the afternoon the next day; nay,
to this hour I am partlyuof the opinion, that I
slept all the next day and night, and till almost
three the day after; for otherwise I knew notihow
I should lose a day out o&.my reckoning in the
<Jays of the week, us it^ppe^red some years after
I had done; for if I had lost,it by crossing and
^crossing the line* I should have lost more than
a day; battio^ my accou*$ it(wa» lost, and I never
knew wJbicfr way-
>JBe that ^hcwe^^ne* way or other* ,when I
awaked/I fouiidsipyself exceedingly refreshed,
<and my spirits lively md chperfuL iSfhen I got
r St
up, I was stronger than I was the day before, atid
my stomach better; for I'was hungry; and, in
short, I had no fit the next day, but continued
much altered for the better.- This was the 29th.
The 30th was my well day, of course; and I
weilt abroad with my gun, but did not care to
travel too far: I killed a sea-fowl or two, something
like a brand goose, and brought them home, but
was not very forward to eat them: so I eat some
more of the turtle's eggs, which were very good.
This evening I renewed the medicine which I had
supposed did rae good the day before, viz. the to*
bacco steeped in rum; only I did not take so much-
as before, nor did I chew any of the leaf, or hold
my head over the smoke: however, I was not so
well the next day, which was the first of July, a$
I hoped I should have befen; for I had a little
spice of the cold fit, but it was not much.
July 2. I renewed the medicitie all the three
ways, and dosed myself with it at first, and doubled
the quantity which I drank.
July 3. I missed the fit for good and all, though
I did not rfecover my full strength for some weeks
after. White I was thus gathering strength, my
thoughts run exceedingly*upon this scripture, "I
will deliver thee;** and the impossibility of my de-
liverance lay much upon nty mind, in bar of my
ever expecting'it? 2 but as^I \£as discouraging my-
self with such thoughts^ it occurred to my mind,
that I pored so much upon my deliverance from
the maiii afflfction; that I disregarded the deliver-
ance I had received; and Invas, }as it were, made-
to ask myself such ^questions as these| viz* Have
OF RAMK&QN C1*US0». 1*3
I not been delivered, and wwderfully to0, from
sieknessc? from the most 'distressed, condition that
c<upld be, and that was so frightful to me? and
what notice had I taken of it? had I done my part?
God had delivered me: but I had not glorified
him: that is to say, I had not owned and been
thankful for that as a deliverance; and how could
I expect greater deliverance?
This touched my heart very much, and imme-
diately I kneeled down, and gave God thanks
aloud, for my recovery from my sickness.
July 4. In the morning I took the bible; and,
beginning at the New Testament, I began seri-
ously to read it, and imposed upon myself to read
awhile every morning and every night* not tying
myself to the number of chapters, but as long as
my thoughts should engage me: it was not long
after I set seriously to this work, but I found my
heart more deeply and sincerely affected with the
wickedness of my past life; the impression of my
dream revived, and the words, All these things
have not brought thee to repentance, ran seriously
in my thoughts* I was earnestly begging of God
to give me repentance,, when it happened provi-
dentially the very day, that, reading the scripture, I
came to these words, " He is exalted a Prince and
a Saviour, to give repentance,, and to give remis-
sion." I threw down the book* and with my heart i
asAveil a,s my hand lifted up>ito heave#, in a.kind
of ecstasy of joy, I cried out aloud, Jesus, thou
son of David, J<?sus, thou exalted Piipice and Sa-
viour,* give me repentance!»,
*This was th^firrstti^e that J could s^ in tb§
true seu$e o£, the wWs* tt^t I p$fye4 in. all my
lifej forr&ow l^r^yjed with a sense ,o£,my condi-
tion, §ml with a true scripture view of hope,
founded on the encouragement of the word of
God; and from this time, I may say, I began to
have hope that God would hear me.
Now I began to construe the words mentioned
above, " Call on me, and I will deliver thee," in a
different sense from what I had ever done before;
for then 1 had no notion of any thing being called
deliverance, but my being delivered from the
captivity I was in; for though I was indeed at
large in the place, yet the island was certainly a
prison to me, and that, in the worst sense in the
vporjd; t*vit now I learned to take it in another
sen$p. Now I looked back upon my past life with
£uq)i horror, and my sins appeared so dreadful, that
Hiy soul sought nothing of God, but deliverance
from the load of guilt that bore down ail my com-
fort. As for my solitary life, it was nothing; I did
npt^o much as.pray to be delivered from it, or
think of it; it was all of no consideration, in com-
parison of this: and I added this part here, to hint
to whoever shall rread it, that whenever they come
to a true sense o£ things, they will find delivera-
nce from sin a n^uch greater blessing than deli-
vpranpe from^affl^ction.
But, leaving this par^, \ return to my jpurnal.
My t cppfti^oa' bfgan piow to, be* though jiot less
^iser^le as to pqy ^$y qf giving, yet m#ph easier
to ipy rnfnd} $ad *py. though Ueipgdijrep^ed by a
constant reading the scripture,' and praying to
Goto, to things of a higher nature, I had a great
deal of comfort within, which till now I knew no-
thing of: also as my health and strength returned,
I bestirred myself to furnish myself with every-
thing that I wanted, and make my way of living
as regular as I could.
From the 4th of July to the 14th, I was chiefly
employed in walking about with my gun in my
hand, a little and a little at a time, as a man that
was gathering up his strength after a fit of sick-
ness; for it is hardly to be imagined how low I was,
and to what weakness 1 was reduced. The applica-
tion which I made use of was perfectly new, and
perhaps what had never cured an ague before;
neither can I recommend it to any one to practise
by this experiment; and though it did carry off
the fit, yet it rather contributed to weaken me;
for I had frequent convulsions in my nerves and
limbs^for some time.
I learnt from it also this in particular, that be-
ing abroad in the rainy season was the most perni-
cious thing to my health that could be, espe-
cially in those rains which came attended with
storms and hurricanes of wind; for as the rain
which came in a dry season was always most ac-
companied with such storms, so I found this rain
was much more dangerous than the rain which fell
in Septeinbter an&October. I
I had been now in this unhappy island above
ten iftotafehs*; air possibility of deliverance tJfrom
this cohditibn seemed to be etttir&ly tak&i firbita
had ever set foot upon that place. H&ving now
secured my habitation, as I thought, fully to my
mind, I had a great desire to make a more perfect
discovery of the island, and to see what other pro-
ductions I might find, which yet I knew nothing
of.
It was the 15th of July that I began to take a
more particular survey of the island itself; I went
up the creek first, where, as I hinted, I brought
my rafts on shore. I found, after I came about
two miles up, that the tide did not flow any
higher, and that it was no more than a little brook
of running water, and very fresh and good; but
this being the dry season, there was hardly any
water in some parts of it, at least not enough to
run into any stream, so as it could be perceived.
On the bank of this brook I found many plea-
sant savannas or meadows, plain, smooth, and co-
vered with grass; and on the rising parts of them
next to the higher grounds, where the water, as it
might be supposed, never overflowed, I found a
great deal of tobacco, green, and growing to a
great and -very strong stalk: there were divers
other plants which I had no notion of, or under-
standing about; and might perhaps have virtues
of their own, which I could not find out
I searched for the cassave root, which | the In-
dians in all that climate make their bread of, but
I could find none. I saw large plants of aloes, but
did not then understand them: I saw several sugar
canes, but wild, and, for want of cultivation, im-
perfect. I contented myself with these discove-
ries for this tipie, and came back musing with
myself what course I might take to know the vir-
tue and goodness of any of the fruits or - plants
which I should discover, but could bring it to no
conclusion: for, in short, I had made so little ob-
servation while I was in the Brasils, that I knew
little of the plants of the field, at least very little
that might serve me to any purpose jiow in my
distress. »
, The next day, the 16th,. I went up the same
way again; and, after going something farther
'than I had done the day before, I found the brook
and the savannas began to cease, and the country
became more woody than before. In this part I
found different fruits, and particularly I found
melons upon the ground in great abundance, and
grapes upon the .trees; the vines had spread indeed
pver the.trees, and the clusters of grapes were just
a^w in their prime, very ripe and rich. This was
a surprising discovery, and I was exceeding glad
of .them, but I was warned by my experience to
^atsparingly of .them, remembering, then when I
wa& ashore in Barbary, the eating of grapes killed
several of our Englishmen who were slaves there,
by throwing them into fluxes and fevers: but I
feund an •excellent u^e for these grapes, and that
twas to cure or dry them in* the sun. and keep, them
as dried grapes or raisins are kept, which I thought
would be, as indeed they were* as,wholesome, and
as agreeable to eat, when no grapes might be had.
, I spent all that evening there, and went not
back to my habitation, which by the way was.the
first night, a§ I might say, I had. lain from home.
In th? night I took my first contrivance* a&dgpt
up into a tree, where I slept well, and the next
looming proceeded upon my discovery, travelling
near four miles, as I might judge by the length of
the valley, keeping still due north, with a ridge of
hills on the south and north side of me.
At the end of this march I came to an opening,
where the country seemed to descend to the west;
and a little spring of freshwater, which issued out
'©f the side of the hill by me, ran the other W&y,
that is, due east; and the country appeared so
fresh; so green, so flourishing, every thing being
in a 'constant verdure or flourishing of spring, that
it looked* like a planted gardem
I descended a little on the side of that delicious
valley, surveying it with a secret kind of pleasure
{though1 mixed with other afflicting thoughts) to
think that this was all my own; that I wa& lking
and lord of all this country indefeasiblyy ^and trad
a right of possession; and if I could convey it, 1
miglft have it in inheritance, as completely as* any
lord of a manor in England'. I saw here abun-
dance of eoeoa'-treek,' orange and lemon, and ci-
tron-tre^' but all' Wild; 'and ffew bearing* any

When I came home from this journey} I con-
templated with great pleasure on the fruitfulness
of that valley, and the pleasantness of the situa-
tion, the security from storms on that side of thfe
water, and the wood; and concluded that I had
pitched upon a place to fix my abode which was
by far the worst part of the country. Upcm the
whole, I began to consider of removing my habi**
tation, and to look out for a place equally safe as >>
where I now was situated, if possible, ivu that tp\m^
santfrurtful part of the island. ' « > »«
This thought ran long in my head, arid I«wfe
exceeding fond of it for some time, the.>piea$antw
ness of the place tempting me; but when I came
to a nearer view of it,i<and' to'/consider that I was
now by the sea side,*'where* tot was atileast possible^
that something might happen to my advantage;'
andtfrat the same ill fate that brought me hithevy
might bring some other unhappy wretches to the
same place; and though it was scarce probable
that any such>thing*sshouikl ever happen, yet taw-

A little aft^r this my ink*beg%n,to fail me, and
so I contented jnyself^to, use it move sparingly,
and to write down only the mostremark&ble events
of my life, without continuing a daily memoran-
dum of other things.
The rainy season* and the dry season* began
now to appear regular to me, and I learned to di-
vide tl^em &o as tq proyidp;for them accordingly.
But,I bought,ali my'experience before I had <it^
and this I am going to relate, was one of the most
discouraging experiments that I made at all. I
have mentioned, that I had saved the Sew ears of
barley and rice which I had so,surprisingly found
spring up, as I thought* of thjetyfiselves, &nd believe
there were about thirty stalks of yiqe, and about
twenty of barley; and now I thought it q, proper
time to sow it after the rains., the jsun being in* its
southern position going from me,
Accordingly I dug up a piece of ground, as well
as> I could, with my wooden spade, and dividing it
into two parts, I sowed my grain; but ^s I was
sowing, it casually occurred >to my thought, that
I would not sowcit all at first* because I,did not
know when was the proper> tim^fc^ it; so I sowed
about pwo thirds-of-the seeds, leaving afxwt an
handfuLof each. It was' a-gr^fc comfort to-me
afterwards that I did sof for, not ^ne^ grain of that
I sowed this tlmepame to anything; for the dry
months following^ the, ?arth« haying had' no, rain
after the "seed* was so*w$, it,had no moiptur£-to
assist its growth,* and never came up at all, till the
wet season had come again, and then it grew as if
i^Jhad been hewly,sowrt
i Mmdiug my first seed did not grpw, which I
easily imagined was by the drought, I sought for
a moister piece of ground to make another trial in;
and I dug up a piece of ground near my new
bQSWJi andjsowed the rest of my seed in February,
a little before the vernal equinox;, and this, having
tlsk&im&yimorttk&Qf March and April to water it,
s$tu#guip very .pleasantly, and yielded a very good
c*B®py but ^haying, part of the seed.left only, and
@ot daring to>sow all* that I had yet, I had but a
sfpa*H quantity atjast, my whole crop not amount-
ing to abov$ hajf^ peck ,of eaeh>kind. *
, Bust i by this- experience Lfflsas majfc> master of
^ifiltu^ess^aiidiktevY pxactly whffn the proper
season*was to sow; and that I might expect two
seed tiipes/ and two hansest? every year.
While this corn wvas growing, I made a little
dispoysery, which \yas of us$ to*me afterwards. As
soon as the raifts were over, and the weather began
to settle, which was about the month of Novem-
ber, I made a visit up the country to my howerf
where th&uglvl 4&utai<ft been some months, yet I
found att things>j#M afs I deft them. The circle or
double hedge that I had made, was not only firm
and entire^ but the stakes which I had cut off of
sonjie .trees i.that, grew thereabouts, were all shot
out; and gi^v^vesithflong branches, as much as a
willow tree usually shoots the firsjf year after lop-
ping its head. I €ould not tell what tree to call
it that these stakes were cut from. I was sur-
138 MTV AND ABVE^rUROKS
prised and yet very well pleased, to see the young
trees grow; and I pruned them, and led them up
to grow as much alike as I could, and it is scarce
credible, how beautiful a figure they grew into in
three years; so that though the hedge made a
circle of about twenty-five yards in diameter, yet
the trees, for such I might now call them, soon
covered it; and it was a complete shade, sufficient
to lodge under all the dry season.
This made me revive to cut some more stakes,
and m&ke me an hedge like this in & semicircle
round my wall, I mean that of my first dwellfeg,
which I did; and placing the trees c® stakefe ifFfc
double fdW, at above eight yafris distaric^ frdfti
my first fence, they gr6w presently, arid were'at
first a fine cover to mf h&bit&tfcte, md afterwards
served' fttt a defence also, asf I shall obs§rve3*i to
order*
I found now, thOfcthfe ^asons^f the yfeaf might
generally be divided,' tot into summer and wiWfeer,
as in Europe, but ifitd the rain'y seasons,'^ndthe
dry seasons, which were generally thus:

, The rainy season sometimes held longer or
shorter, as the winds happened to blow; but this
was the general observation J wade. After I had
found, by experience, the ill consequence of beiug
abroad in (the raiq, I took pare to furnish myself
with provision beforehand, that J .might not be
obliged to go <mt; and I sat within doors as much
as possible during the wet months.
. Iw this time I found much employment, (and
y#ry suitable also to the time) for I found great
occasion of wpny things which I had no way to
furnish myself with,, ,but by hard Ubour and con-
stant application: particularly; 1 tried many ways
to make myself a basket; but alUhe twigs I could
get for the- purpose proved j&o brittle, that they
would do nothing. It proved of excellent advan-
J&ge to me now, that when I was a boy, I used to
take great delight in standing at & basket-maker's
k} the, town where my ^ther iked, to see them
make th^ir wicker ware; aWw being, as boys usually
are, very officious to help, and a great observer of
the manner how they worked those things, a»d
sometimes lent a hand, I had by this means so
t 2
full knowledge of the methods of it? that I wanted
nothing but the materials; when it came into my
mind, that the twigs of that tree from whence I
cut my stakes that grew, might possibly be as
tough as the sallows and willows, and osiers, in
England; and I lesolved to try.
Accordingly the next day I went to my coun-
try-house, as I called it, and cutting some of the
smaller twigs, I found them to my purpose -as
much as I could desire; whereupon I came the
next time prepared with an hatchet to cut down a
quantity, which I soon found, for there was a
great plenty of them: these I set up to dry within
my circle or hedges; and when they were fit for
use, I carried them to my cave; and here during
the next season I employed myself in making, (as
Well as I could) a great many baskets, both to
carry earth, or to carry or lay up any thing, as I
had occasion; and though I did not finish them
very handsomely, yet I made them sufficiently-
serviceable for my purpose; and thus afterwards
I took care never to be without them; and as my
wicker-ware decayed, I made more; especially I
ma'dc strong deep baskets to place my coin in, in-
stead of sacks, 'when V should come to have any
qtiantity of it
Having masterecrthis difficulty, and employed a
world of time about it? I bestirred myself to see,
if possible, hoVto supply two wants, I h^.d no
vessels to hblcl aify'tiling thatfwas Hquicl, except
two rundlets, whicti were almost full of rum, and
sorrie glass bdttles, some of the common size, and
others which were case-bottles sqiiare, for the
hblding of waters, spirits, &c. I had not so much
as a pot to boil any thing in, except a great ket-
tle which I saved out of the ship, and vv hicli was
too big for such uses as I desiied it for, viz. to
make broth, and stew a bit of meat by itself. The
second thing I would fain have had, was a to-
bacco pipe, but it was impossible for me to make
one; however I found a contiivance for that too
at last.
I employed myself in planting my second rows
of stakes of piles, and in this wicker work, ail the
summer, or dry season; when another business
took me up more time than it could be imagined I
could spare.
I mentioned before, that I had a great mind to
see the whole island, and that I had travelled up
the brook, and so on to where I built my bower,
and where I had an opening quite to the sea, on the
other side of the island. I now resolved to travel
quite across to the sea shore on that side: so taking
mjf gun, and hatchet, and my dog, and a larger
quantity of powder and shot than usual, with two
tnscuit-cakes, and a great bunch of raisins in my
pouch, for my store, I began my journey. When
I had" passed the vale where my bower stood, as
above, I came within view of the sea, to the west;
and it being a very clear day, I fairly desciied land,
whether an island or continent I could not tell;
but it lay veiy high, extending frpm the West,
to the W.*&W. at a very giea,t distance; by my
guess it* could not be less than fifteen or twenty
leagues off*. *
I could Hot tell what part of the world this
might be, otherwise than that I knew it must be
part of America; and, as I concluded by all my
observations, must be near the Spanish dominions,
and perhaps was all inhabited by savages, where
if I should have landed, I had been in a worse
condition than I was now; and therefore I acqui-
esced in the dispositions of Providence, which I
began now to own, and to believe, ordered every
thing for the best; I say, I quieted my mind with
this, and left afflicting myself with fruitless wishes
of being there.
Besides, after some pause upon this affair, I con-
sidered, that if this land was the Spanish coast, I
should certainly, one time or other, see some ves-
sels pass or repass one way or other; but if not,
then it was the savage coast between the Spanish
country and Braail, which were indeed the worst
of savages; for they are cannibals, or men-eaters,
and fail not to murder and devour all the human
bodies that fall into their hands.
With these considerations I walked very lei-
surely forward. I found that side of the island
where I now was, much pleasanter than mine, the
open or savanna fields sweet, adorned with flowers
and grass, and full of very fine woods. I saw
abundance of parrots, and fain would I have
caught one, if possible, to have kept it to be tame,
and taught it to, spe^k to me I did, after some
pains taken, catchayroung parrot; ibr I knocked
it down with 3 stick, and having; recoverexl it, I
brought it home, b^fc it wa2 some years before J
could make him speak. However, at last I taught
bias to call me by my name, Yery fkmiliairly; but
the accident that followed, though it be a trifle,
will be very diverting in its place.
I was exceedingly diverted with this journey: I
found in the low grounds, hares, as I thought
them to be, and foxes, but they differed greatly
from all the other kinds I had met with; nor could
I satisfy myself to eat them, though I killed seve-
ral: but I had no need to be ventrous; for I had
ik) want of food, and of that which was very
good too: especially these three sorts, viz. goats,
pigeons, and turtle or tortoise; which, added to
my grapes, Leadenhall market could not have
furnished a better table than I, in proportion to
the company: and though my case was deplorable
enough, yet I had great cause for thankfulness,
that I was not driven to any extremities for food;
but rather plenty, even to dainties.
I never travelled in this journey above two miles
outright in a day, or thereabouts; but I took so
many turns and returns, to see what discoveries I
could make, that I came weary enough to the
jStace where I resolved to sit down for all nights
and then either reposed myself in a tree, or sur-
Tbunded myself with a tow of stakes set upright ?n
the ground, either from one trefe to atnother, or fco
as no wild creature could come at me without
waking toe.
As soon as i^came to the seashore, I was sur-
prised tdT see that I had tafceii up my lot on the
worst jsidfe of the islatid; for here indeed the sIiotc
was covered'With hifltimefable turtles, wliere&s on
the other i^dfe I had fbrnid but three1 in a year and
an half/ $dr6Vas also* an infinite inimbef^f fowls
of many kinds, some of which I had not seen be-
fore, and many of them very good meat; but such
as I knew not the names of, except those called
penguins.
I could have shot as many as I pleased, but
was very sparing of my powder and shot: and
therefore had more mind to kill a she-goat, if I
could, which I could better feed on: and though
there were many more goats heie than on the
other side of the island, yet it was with much more
difficulty that I could come near them: the coun-
tiy being flat and even, and they saw me much
sooner than when I was on the hills.
I confess this side of the country was much
pleasanter than mine, but yet I had not the least
inclination to remove; for as I was fixed in my ha-
bitation, it became natural to me; and I seemed
all the while I was here, to be, as it were, upon a
journey, and from home. However, I travelled
along the shore of the sea towards the east, I sup-
pose, about twelve miles; and then setting up a
great pole upon the shore for amark, I concluded
I would go home again; and the next journey I
took should be on the other side of the island, east
from my dwelling, and so round, till I came to
my post ag&in: of which in its place.,,
I took another way to come back than that I
went, thinking I could easily keep all the island so
much in my view, that I could not miss finding
my first dwelling by viewing the country; but I
found myself mistaken; for being come about two
or three miles, 1 found myself descended into a
veiy large valley; but so surrounded with hills^
and those Bills cohered with woods, that I could
not see which was my way by any direction but
that of the sun; nor even then, unless I knew
very well the position of the sun at that time of
the day.
It happened, to my farther misfortune, that the
weather proved hazy for three or four days, while
I was in this valley; and not being able to see the
slm, I wandered about very uncomfortably, and
atlastwas obliged to find out the sea-side, look for
my post, and come back the same way I went;
and then by easy journies I turned homeward, the
weather being exceeding hot; and my gun, ammu-
nition, hatchet, and other things, very heavy-
In this journey my dbg surprised a young kid,
and seized upon it; and I running in to take hold
ef it, caught it, and saved it alive from the dog.
II had a great mind to bring it home, if I couldj
Ibr I had' often been musing whether it might not
fee possible to get a kid or two, and so raise a
fere^d of tame goats, which might supply me when
jrj'y powder and shot should be spent.
* I made a collar for this little creature; and with
a sfaririg which I made of some rope yarn, which I
always carried about me, I led him along, though
w;ith some difficulty, till I came to my bower, and
the^e I enclosed him> and left him; fori was very
impatient to be at home, from whence I had been
atjfceAt above a month/
T cknnot1 express what a satisfaction it was td
me to come into my old hutch, t and lie down in
my hammock-bed : this little wandering journey,
without a sett/led place of abode, had been so un-
u
pleasant to me, that my own house, as I called it to
myself, was a perfect settlement to me, compared to
that; and it rendered everything about me so
comfortable, that I resolved I would never go a
great way from it again, while it should be my lot
to stay on the island.
I reposed myself here a week, to rest and regale
myself after my long journey; during which, most
of the time was taken up in the weighty affair of
making a cage for my Poll, who began now to be
a mere domestic, and to be mighty well acquainted
with me. Then I began now to think of the poor
kid, which I had pent in within my little circle,
and resolved to go and fetch it home, and give it
some food: accordingly I went, and foujid it
where I left it; for indeed it could not get out,
but was almost starved for want of food. I went
and cut boughs of trees and branches of such
shrubs as I could find, and threw it over; and
having fed it, I tied it as I did before to lead it
away; but it was so tame with being hungry, that
I had no need to have tied it; for it followed me
like a dog; and as I continually fed it, the crea-
ture became so loving, so gentle, afid so fond, that
it became from that time one of my domestics
also, and would never leave me afterwards.
The rainy season of the autumnal equinox was
now come, afcd I kept the 30th of September in
the same solemn manner as before, being the anni-
versary of my landing on the island, having now
been there t#o years, and no more prospect of
being delivered than the first day I came there* I
spent the whole day in humble and thankful ac-
knowledgments of the many wonderful mercies
which my solitary condition was attended with,
and without which it might have been infinitely
more miserable, I gave humble and hearty thanks,
that God had been pleased to discover to me, even
that it was possible I might be more happy in this
solitary condition, than I should have been in a
liberty of society, and in all the pleasures of the
world: that he could fully make up to me the de-
ficiences of my solitary state and the want of hu-
man society, by his presence, and the communica-
tion of his grace to my soul, supporting, comfort-
ing, and encouraging me to depend upon his pro-
vidence here, and hope for his eternal presence
hereafter.
It was now that I began sensibly to feel how
much more happy the life I now led was, with all
its miserable circumstances, than the wicked
cursed abominable life I led all the past part of my
days; and now, having changed both my sorrows
and my joys, my very desires altered, my affec-
tions changed their gust, and my delights were
perfectly new from what they were at first com-
ing, or indeed for the two years past.
Before as I walked about, either on my hunting,
or for viewing the country, the anguish of my soul
at my condition would break out upon me on a
sudden, and my very heart would die within me,
to think of the woods, the mountains, the deserts
I was in; and how I was a prisoner, locked up
with the eternal bolts and b$r$,of the ocean, in an
uninhabited wilderness, without redemption,. In
the midst of the greatest composures of my mind,
u 2
this would break out upon me like a storm, and
made me wring my hands, and weep like a child.
Sometimes it would take mc in the middle of my
work, and I would immediately sit down and
sigh, and look upon the ground for an hour or two
together; and this was stidl worse to me; for if I
could burst out into tears, or vent myself by
words, it would go off, and the grief, having ex-
hausted itself, would abate.
But now I began to exercise myself with new
thoughts; I daily read the word of God, and ap-
plied all the comforts of it to my present state.
One morning, being very sad, I opened the bible
upon these words, " I will never, never leave thee,
nor forsake thee!" Immediately it occurred, that
these words were to me, why else should they be
directed in such a manner, just at the moment
when I was mourning over my condition, as one
forsaken of God and man? Well then, said I, if
God does not forsake me, of what ill consequence
can it be, or what matters it, though the world
should all forsake me; .seeing on the other hand,
if I had all the world, and should lose the favour
and blessing of God, there would be no compari-
son in the loss?
From this moment I began to conclude in my
mind, that it was possible for me to be more happy
in this forsake^ solitary .condition, than it was
probable I should have ever been in any other par-
ticular state in the world; and with this thought
I was going to give thanks to God for bringing
me to this place.
I know not what it was, but something shocked
my mind at that thouglat, and I durst not speak
the words. How canst tftiou be such an hypocrite
(said I, even audibly), to pretend to be thankful
for a condition, which, however thou may est en-
deavour to be contented with, thou wouldest ra-
ther pray heartily to be delivered from? So I stop-
ped there; but though I could not say I thanked
God for being there, yet I sincerely gave thanks
to God for opening my eyes, by whatever afflicting
providences, to see the former condition of my
life, and to mourn for my wickedness, and repent
I never opened the bible, or shut it, but my very
<soul within me blessed God for directing my friend
in England, without any order of mine, to pack it
up among my goods; and for assisting me after-
wards to save it out of the wreck of the ship.
Thus, and in this disposition of mind, I began
jny third year; and though I have not given the
reader the trouble of so particular an account of
jny works this year as at the first, yet in general
it may be observed, that I was very seldom idle;
feaving regularly divided my time, according to
the several daily employments that were before
me; such as, firs.,t, my duty to God, and reading
the scriptures, which I constantly set apart some
time foiv thrice every day* Secondly* the going
abroad with my gun for food, which generally
took me up three hours every morning when it
did note rain. Thirdly, the ordering, curings
preserving* and cooking what I had killed or
matched for my supply. These took up great part
of the day. Also it is to be considered, that in the
middle of the day> when the sun was in the ze-
nith, the violence of the heat was too great to stir
out; so that about four hours in the evening was
all the time I could be supposed to work in; with
this exception, that sometimes I changed my
hours of hunting and working, and went to work
in the morning, and abroad with my gun in the
afternoon.
To this short time allowed for labour, I desire
may be added the exceeding laboriousness of my
work; the many hours which, for want of tools,
want of help, and want of skill, every thing that I
did took up out of my time: for example, I was
full two-and-forty days making me a board for a
long shelf, which I wanted in my cave; whereas
two sawyers, with their tools and saw-pit, would
have cut six of them out of the same tree in half
a day.
- My case was this: It was to be a large tree
which was to be cut down, because my board was
to be a broad one. The tree I was three days a
cutting down, and two more cutting off the boughs,
and reducing it to a log, or piece of timber. With
inexpressible hacking and hewing, I reduced both
the sides of it into chips, till it began to be light
enough to move; then I turned it, and made one
side of it smooth and flat, as a board, from end to
end: then turning that side downward, cut the
other side till I brought the plank to be about three
inches thick, and smooth on both sides. Any one
may judges the labour of my hands in such a piece
of work; but labour and patience carried me
through that and many other things; I oply ob-
serve this m particular, to shew the reason why
so much of my time went away with so little work,
viz. That what might be a little to be done with
help and tools, was a vast labour, and required a
prodigious time to do alone, and by hand.
But notwithstanding this, with patience and la-
bour I went through many things, and indeed
every thing that my circumstances made necessary
for me to do, as will appear by what follows.
I was now in the months of November and" De-
cember, expecting my crop of barley and rice. The
ground I had manured or dug up for them was not
great; for, as I observed, my seed of each was not
above the quantity of half a peck; for I had lost
one whole crop by sowing in the dry season; but
now my crop promised very well, when on a sud-
den I found I was in danger of losing it all again
by enemies of several sorts, which it was scarce
possible to keep from it; at first, the goats, and
wild creatures which I called hares, which, tast-
ing the sweetness of the blade, lay in it night
and day, as soon as it came up, and eat it so close,
that it could get no time to shoot up into stalks.
This I saw no remedy for, but by making an
inclosure about it with an hedge, which I did with
a great deal of toil; and the more, because it re-
quired a great deal of speed; the creatures daily
spoiling my corn. However, as my arable land
was but small, suited to my crop, I got it totally
well fenced in about three weeks time; and shoot-
ing some of the creatures in the day-time, I set
my dog to guard it in the night, tying him up to
a stake at the gate, where he would stand and
bark all nightlong: so in a little time the enemies
forsook the place, and the corn grew very strong
and well, and began to ripen apace.
But as the beasts ruined me before, while my
corn was in the blade, so the birds were as like to
ruin me now, when it was in the ear; for going
along by the place to see how it throve, I saw my
little crop surrounded with fowls of I know not
how many sorts, which stood as it were watching
till I should be gone. I immediately let fly among
them, (for I always had my "gun with me.) I had
no sooner shot, but there arose up a little cloud
of fowls, which I had not seen at all, from among
the Corn itself.
This touched me sensibly; for I foresaw, that
in a few days they would devour all my hopes.:
that I should be starved,, and never be able to
raise a erop at all; and what to do I could not
tell; however, I resolved not to lose my corn, if
possible, though I should watch it night and day.
In the first place, I went among it to see what
damage was already done, and found they had
spoiled a good deal of it; but that, as it was yet
too green for them, the loss> was not so great, but
the remainder was like to be a good crop, if it
could be saved. j
I staid by iito load my gun, and then coming
away, -1 could easily see the thieves sitting upon
all thetrees about me, a$ if they only waited till I
was gone way, and the event proved it to be so;
for as I walked off, as if I was gone, I was no
sooner out of their sight, but they dropped down
one by one into the corn again. I was so provoked,
that I could nfrt haw patience to ,«U(£f till more
came on, knowing that every grain that they eat
now was, as it might be said, a peck loaf to me in
the consequence; but coming up to the hedge, I
fired again, and killed three of them. This was
what I wished for; so I took them up, and served
them as we serve notorious thieves in England,
viz. hanged them in chains, for a terror to others.
It is impossible to imagine almost, that this should
have such an effect as it had; for the fowls would
tiot only not come at the corn, but in short they
forsook all that part of the island, and I could never
see a bird near the place as long as my scarecrows
hung there.
This I was very glad of, you may be sure; and
about the latter end of December, which was our
second harvest of the year, I reaped my corn.
I was sadly put to it for a scythe or a sickle to
cut it down, and all I could do was to make one
as well as I could, out of one of the broad-swords,
or cutlasses, which I saved among the arms out of
the ship. However, as my crop was but small, I
had no great difficulty to cut it down: in short, I
reaped it my way, for I cut nothing off but the
ears, and carried it away in a great basket which
I had made, and so rubbed it out with my hands:
and at the end of all my harvesting I found, that
out of my half-peck of seed, I had near two
bushels of rice, and above two bushels and a half
of barley, that is to say, by my guess, for I had
no measure at that time.
However, this was a great encouragement to
me; and I foresaw that in time it would please
God to supply me with bread: and yet here I was
x
perplexed again ; for I neither knew how to grind
or make meal of my corn, or indeed how to clean
it, and part it; nor, if made into meal, how to
make bread of it; and if how to make it, yet I
knew not how to bake it. These things being
added to my desire of having a good quantity for
store, and to secure a constant supply, I resolved
not to taste any of this crop, but to preserve it ail
for seed against the next season, and in the mean
time to employ all my study and hours of working
to accomplish this great work of providing myself
with corn and bread.
It might be truly said, that I now worked for
my bread. It is a little wonderful, and what I
believe few people have thought much upon; vi^»
the strange multitude of little things necessary in
the providing, producing, curing, dressing, mak-
ing, and finishing, this one article of bread.
I, that was reduced to a mere state of nature,
found this to be my daily discouragement, and was
made more and more sensible of it every hour,
even after I got the first handful of seed corn,
which, as I have said, came up unexpectedly, and
indeed to a surprise.
First, I had,no plough to turn the earth, no spade
or shpvel to dig it. Well, this I conquered by
making a wgtoden spade, as I observed before, but
this did my work but in a wooden, manner; an4
though, it co$t ipe a great many days tp make it,
yet for want of iron, it not only wore out the
sooner, but made my work the harder, smd made
it be performed much \yorse*
However, this I boxe with too, and was content
to work it out with patience, and bear with the
badness of the performance. When the corn was
sowed, I had no harrow, but was forced to go over
it myself, and drag a great heavy bough of a tree
over it, to scratch the earth, as it may be called,
rather than rake or harrow it.
Wheti it was growing or grown, I have observed
already how many things I wanted, to fence it,
secare it, mow or reap it, cure or carry it home,
thresh, part it from the chaff, and save it. Theti
I wanted a mill to grind it, sieves to dress it, yeast
and salt to make it into bread, and an oven to
bake it in; and all these things I did without, as
shall be observed; and yet the corn was an inesti-
mable comfort and advantage to me tbo: but all
this, as I said, made every thing laborious and
tedious to me, but that there Was no help for;
neither was my time so'ttmch loss to me, because
I had divided it. A certain part of it was every
day appointed to these works; and as I resolved
to use none of the corn for bread till I had a greater
quantity by me, I had the next six months to
apply myself, wholly by khotir and invention, to
furnish myself with utensils proper for the per-
forming all the operations necessary for the making
the corn, when I had it, fit forjmy use.
But first I was to prepare tnore land, for I had
now seed enough to sow above an* acre of ground.
Before I did this* Iliad a Week's work at least to
make me a spade, which, whin it was done, was a
very sorry one indeed, and very heavy, and requiied
double labour to work with it; however, I went
through that, and sowed my seeds in t\Vo large flat
x 2
pieces of ground, as near my house as I could find
them to my mind, and fenced them in with a good
hedge, the stakes of which were all cut off that
wood which I had set before, which I knew would
grow; so that in one year's time I knew I should
have a quick or living hedge, that would want
but little repair. This work was not so little as
to take me up less than three months; because
great part of that time was in the wet season,
when I could not go abroad.
Within-door, that is, when it rained, and I could
not go out, I found employment on the following
occasion, always observing, that all the while I
was at work, I diverted myself with talking to my
parrot, and teaching him to speak; and I quickly
learnt him to know his own name; at last, to speak
it out pretty loud, Poll-, which was the first word
I ever heard spoken in the island by any mouth
but my own. This therefore was not my work,
but an assistant to my work; for now, as I said, I
had a great employment upon my hands, as fol-
lows: viz. I had long studied, by some means or
other, to make myself some earthen vessels, which
indeed I wanted sorely, but knew not where to
come at them: however, considering the heat of
the climate, I did not doubt but if I could find out
any such clay, I might botch up some such pot,
as might, being dried by the sun, be hard enough,
and strong enough, to bear handling, and to hold
any thing that was dry, and required to be kept
so; and as this was necessary in preparing corn,
meal, &c. which was the thing I was upon, I re-
solved to make some as large as I could, and fit
only to stand like jars to hold what should be put
into them.
I would make the reader pity me, or rather
laugh at me, to tell how many aukward ways I
took to raise this paste, what odd misshapen ugly
things I made, how many of them fell in, and how
many fell out, the clay not being stiff enough to
bear its own weight; how many cracked by the
over violent heat of the sun, being set out too
hastily; and how many fell to pieces with only
removing,, as well before as after they were dried;
and, in a word, how, after having laboured hard
to find the clay, to dig it, to temper it, to bring it
home, and work it, I could not make above two
large earthen ugly things, I cannot call them jars,
in about two months labour.
However, as the sun baked these two very dry
and hard, I lifted them very gently up, and set
them down again in two great wicker baskets,
which I had made on purpose for them, that they
might not break; and, as between the pot and the
basket there was a little room to spare, I stuffed
it full of the rice and barley straw; and these two
pots being to stand always dry, I thought would
hold my dry corn, and perhaps the meal when the
corn was bruised.
Though I miscarried so much in my design for
large pots, yet I made several smaller things with
better success; such as little round pots, flat dishes,
pitchers, and pipkins, anti any thing my hand
turned to; and the heat of the sun baked them
strangely hard
But all this would not answer my end, which
was to get an earthen pot to hold what was liquid,
and bear the fire, which none of these could do.
It happened after some time, making a pretty
large fire for cooking my meat, when I went to
put it out after 1 had done with it, I found a bro-
ken piece of one of my earthen-ware vessels in the
fire, burnt as hard as a stone, and red as a tile. I
was agreeably surprised to see it, and said to my-
self, that certainly they might be made to burn
whole, if they would burn broken.
This set me to study how to order my fire, so
as to make it burn me some pots. I had no notion
of a kiln, such as the potters burn in, or of glazing
them with lead, though I had some lead to do it
with; but I placed three large pipkins, and two
or three pots, in a pile one upon another, and
placed my fire-wood all round it, with a great heap
of embers under them: I plied the fire with fresh
fuel round the outside, and upon the top, till I saw
the pots in the inside red-hot quite through, and
observed that they did not crack at all: when I
saw them clear red, I let them stand in that heat
about five or six houre, till I found one of them,
though it did not crack, did melt or run; for the
sand which was mixed5 with the clay, melted by
the violence of/the<he#t, &nd would have run into
glass, (if I bad gone on; so I slacked my fire gra-
dually, till jhe po;fcsTbegan to abate of the red co-
lour; .and watching them all night, that I might
not let the^ fire .abate* too fast, in the morning I
had three very good, I will not say handsome pip-
kins, and two other earthen pots^ as hard burnt as
could be desired; and one of them peifectly glazed
with the running of the sand.
After this experiment I need not say that I
wanted no sort of earthen-ware for my use; but
I must needs say, as to the shapes of them, they
were very indifferent, as any one may suppose,
when I had no way of making them, but as the
children make dirt-pies, or as a woman would
make pies that never learnt to raise paste.
No joy at a thing of so mean a nature was ever
equal to mine, when I found I had made an eaithen
pot that would bear the fire; and I had hardly patience
to stay till they were cold, before I set one upon
the fire again, with some water in it, to boil me
some meat, which I did admirably well; and with
a piece of a kid I made some very good broth,
though I wanted oatmeal, and several other ingre-
dients requisite to make it so good as I would have
had it.
My next concern wa& to get me a stone mortar
to stamp or beat some corn in; for as to the mill,
there was no thought of arriving to that perfection
of art with one pair of hands. To supply this
wan£, I was at a great toss; for of all trades in the
world I was as perfectly unqualified for a stone-
CHtter, as for any whatever; neither had I any
tools to, go about it with. I spent many a day to
find out a great sto^e big enough to cut hollow,
and mqke fit* for ^ mortar, a©d could find none at
all, except what was in the solid orock,' and which
I had no \yay to dig orf cut out;* npr indeed were
the rocks in the island of hardness sufficient, but
were all of a sandy ciumbling stone, which would
neither bear the weight of an heavy pestle, nor
would break the corn without filling it with sand;
so, after a great deal of time lost in searching for
a stone, I gave it over, and resolved to look out a
great block of hard wood, which I found indeed
much easier; and getting one as big as I had
strength to stir, I rounded it, and formed it on the
outside with my axe and hatchet; and then, with
the help of fire and infinite labour, made an hallow
place in it, as the Indians in Brasil make their
canoes. After this, I made a great heavy pestle
or beater, of the wood called the iron-wood; and
this I prepared and laid by against I had my next
crop of corn, when I proposed to myself to grind,
or rather pound, my com or meal to make my
biead.
My next difficulty was to make a sieve or searce,
to dress my meal, and part it from the bran and
the husk, without which I did not see it possible I
could have any bread. This was a most difficult
thing, so much as but to think on; for, to be sure,
I had nothing like the necessary things to mak£
it with; i mean fine thin canvass, or stuff* to searce
the meal through. And here I was at a fulLstop
for many months; nor did I really know what <o
do: linen I had none left but what was mere rag*s;
I had goat's hair, but neither kn>ew I how to weave
or spin it; and had I kno^n how, here were no
tools to woik it with. All the remedy that I found
for this, was, that at last I did remember I had
among the seamen's clothes, which were.aaved out
of the ship, some neckcloths of calico or muslin;
and with some pieces of these I made three small
sieves, but proper enough for the work: and thus
I made shift for some years; how I did afterwards,
I shall shew in its place.
The baking part was the next thing to be con-
sidered, and how I should make bread when I
came to have corn; for, first, I had no yeast. As
to that part, there was no supplying the want, so
I did not concern myself much about it. But for
aft oven, I was indeed in great pain. At length I
found out an experiment for that also, which was
this? I made some earthen vessels very broad, but
not deep; that is to say, aboat two feet diameter,
a^id not above nine inches deep; these I burnt in
the fire, as I had done the other, and laid them
by: and when I wanted to bake, I made a great
fire upon the hearth, wnich I had paved with some
square tiles of my own making and burning also;
but I should not call them square.
When the fire-wood was burnt pretty much into
embers, orr live coals, I drew them forward upon
this-hearth, so as to cover it all over; and there I
let them lie, till the hearth was very hot: then
sweeping away all the e3mbers, I set down my loaf,
w loaves j and whelming down the earthen pot
Bp&irthem, drew the em(bei*$ all round the outside
of the pot, to keep ill, and add to the heat: and
thus, as wdl && ill the^est dveti in the world, I
baked my barlefy4oaVes,' and became in a little
time a* fttere ^astry-edok intoMtheJ bargain; for I
made myself several cakes 6f the rice, and pud-
dings; indeed* I madfe fro pies, nfeitherhad I any
f Y
thing to put into them, supposing I had, except
the flesh either of fowls or goats. «
It need not be wondered at, if all these things
took me up most part of the third year of my
abode here; for it is to be observed, that in the
intervals of these things, I had my new harvest
and husbandry to manage: for I reaped my corn
in its season, and carried it home as well as I could*
and laid it up in the ear, in my large baskets, till
I had time to rub it out; for I had no floor to
thrash it on, or instrument to thrash it with.
And now indeed, my stock of corn increasing,
I really wanted to build my barns bigger: I wanted
a place to lay it up in; fotf the increase of the corn
now yielded hie so much, that I had of the barley
about twenty bushels, and of the rice as much, or
more; insomuch that I now resolved to begin to
use it freely, for my bread >had been quite gone a
great while; also I resolved to see what quantity
would be sufficient for me & whole year, and to
sow but once a year.
Upon the whole, I found that the forty bushels
of barley and rice were imuofa more than I could
consume in a year; iso* 1 Jif&oived to sow just the
same quantity every yeartfeat I sowed the last,' in
hopes ithat* su^h ar quantity wbukl fully provide
me with bre&d> &c:
Ail the while th^*e things* were doing, you may
be sure friy thoughts ran many times upon the
prospect of land which I had seen from the other
side of the island; and I was not without secret
wishes that I was on shore them,» fancying that
seeing the main land, and an inhabited country, I
might find some way or other to convey myself
farther, and perhaps at last find some means of
escape.
But all this while I made no allowance for the
dangers of such a condition, and how I might fall
into the hands of savage?, and perhaps such as I
might have reason to think far worse than the
lions and tigers of Africa: that if I once came into
their power, I should run an hazard moie than a
thousand to one of being killed, and perhaps of
being leaten; for I had heard that the people of
the Caribean coasts were cannibals, or men-eaters;
and I knew by the latitude that I could not be
far off from that shore: that, suppose they were
not cannibals,^ yet they might kill me, as many
Europeans who had fallen into their hands had
been served, even when they had been ten or
twenty together; much more 1 that was but one,
and, could make little or no defence. All these
things, I say, which I ought to have consideied
well of, and I did cast up iu my thoughts after-
wards,! yet took none of my apprehensions at first;
and my head ran mightily upon the thoughts of
getting over to that shore*, r i
>t,fNFow I wished for my .boy Xuny^andnthe long
boat with the shoulder-of-mutto©: sail,, with which
Issaakdv above* an fehou&and hmJ£& on the. coast of
Affriea>j. but this was^intvain*i „Then I thought,I
would gotaaadi look oa our ship's boat, wjhieh, ^u$ J
have said,, was blown up t*p®n thej^sh^ne a great
way in ithe storm,, ivhen we were first east afeay.
She lay almost where she did at first, but not
y 2
quite; and was turned, by the force of the vwes
and the winds, almost bottom upwards, against the
high ridge of a beachy rough sand, but no w^ater
about her as before.
If I had had hands to have refitted her, and
have launched her into the water> the boat would
have done well enough, and I might have gone
back into the Brasils with her easy enough; but I
might have easily foreseen, that I could no more
turn her, and set her upright upon her bottom*
than I could remove the island. However I w*ent
to the wood, and cut levers and rollers, and brought
them to i the boat, resolving to try what I could
do; suggesting to myself, that if I could but turn
her down, I might easily repair the damage she
had received^ and she iWould be a very good boafy
and I might go to sea m her v&ty easily.
I spared no pains indeed inthi£ piece of fruitless
toil, and spent, I think, three or four weeks afeoufi
it:>at last finding it impossible to heave it up with
my little strength, I fell to digging away the sand
toiundermine it; and so to make it fail down, set-
ting pieces of wood to thrust and guide it right in
the fall. ^
But when! had done? thisy I was* unable, to ^tir

of the boat, my? design to venture nov,«ri fop the

for it seemed 'impossible.
This at length set me upon thinking whether it
was not possible^ to* mate myself a^anoe' or pe-
&P lioBttf&oisr cuusoE. 165
riagaa, siiclras the natives of those climates make,
evien'witbout tools, or as I might say, without
h&Mls, viz. of the trunk of a great tree. This I
not only thought possible, but easy; and pleased
myself extremely with my thoughts of making it,
and with my having much more convenience for
it than any of the negroes or Indians; but not at
ail ^considering the particular inconveniences which
I lay under more than the Indians did, viz. want
of rlmiids to move it into the water, when it was
itode; >a difficulty much harder for me to surmount
thtoall the consequences of want of tools could
USito them: for what was it to me, that when I
had chosen a vast tree in the woods,-1 might with
great trouble cut it down, if, after I might be able

irasklfe to make it hollow, so to make a boat of it;
i#,i sifter all this, I must leave it just there wheie I
fdttnd it, and was not able to launch it i&to the
water ^ J
^One would have thought, I could not have had
the least reflection uptm my mind of my circum-
stances, while I was making my boat, but I should
huft immediately thought how I should get it
iftWtlie sea; but my thoughts were so intent upon
r®f voyage ©vei* the sea in it; that* I never once

I went W workrtepon tbiisrboat thd most .like a
fool that ever man did, who had any of his seftstes
awake. I pleased myself with the design, without
determining whether I was ever able to undertake
it; not but that the difficulty of launching my boat
came often into my head; but I put a stop to my
own inquiries into it by this foolish answer, which
I gave myself; Let me first make it, I will war-
rant I will find some way or other to-get it along;
when it is done.
This was a most preposterous method; but the
eagerness of my fancy prevailed, and to work I
went, and felled a cedar tree: I question much
whetlier Sotomon ever had such an one for the
building, the temple of Jerusalem; it was five feet
teniriches diameter at the lower part next the
stump, and four feet eleven inches diameter at the
endof t wentyntwo feet, after which it lessened for
afile,: and thea parted into/branches. :It; was
not without infinite labour that I felled this tree:
I was twenty days hacking and hewing at it at thg
bottom; I was fourteen more getting the branches
and limbs, and the vast spreading head of it cut
off* which I hacked'and hewed through with my
axe and hatchet, with iinexpressible iabdur; aftet
this itrcost me a.month; tolshaped and dub it to
a proportion* and to something like the bottcim of
a boat, that it alightiswhra upright as it ought to
dot. Iticostine neaT tlir^^nxontto-more ;to clear
the inside, and woris i-jfcr out so' as to itiake an exact
boat of &: tihh Idid indeed without fiire,! by mere
iBalletand chbs^l^ and bjy the=dint <d hard labour;
till I had brought it to be a very-bandsonie pe-
riagua, and; bigi leiiotig&3 to have? darried six-afi d-
twenty men, and consequently big enough to have
cauried me and all my cargo.
^When I had gone through this work, I was
extremely delighted with it: the boat was really
mqoh bigger than I ever saw a canoe or periagua,
that was made of one tree, in my life; many a
weary sjroke it had cost, you may be sure, for
theie remained nothing but to get it into the
water; and had I gotten it into the water, I make
no'question but I should have begun the maddest
voyage, and the most unlikely to be performed, that
ever was undertaken.
But all my devices to get it into the water failed
me, though they cost infinite labour too; it lay
about one hundred yards from the water, and not
more; but the first inconvenience was, it was up
hill towards the creek. Well, to take away this
discouragement, I resolved to dig into the surface
of the earth, and so make a declivity; this I began,
and it cost me a prodigious deal of pains: but who
grudge pains, that have their deliverance in view?
But when this was worked through, and thi&diffi-.
aa4ty managed, it was still much at one; far I could
no more stir the canoe, than I could the other boat.
- Then I measured ffae distance of ground, and re-
solved to <£ut a dock, or eanal, to bring the water
up4o the canoe, seeing I could not ferjiig the canoe
down to*the wateh Well, I began fchis'work, and
when 1 began to enter into it> alnd calculated how
deep it was to be dug, how brofcd, hotv the stuff
to be thrown out, I found, that by the number of
hands I had*'being none but my own, it* must have
been ten or twelve years before >I*should>have gone
through .with it;> for the shore lay high, so th&i at
the upper end it must have heen at least twenty
feet deep ; so at length, though with great reltte-
tancy, I gave this attempt over also.
This grieved me heartily; and now I saw, though
too late, the folly of beginning a work before*we
count the cost, and before we judge rightly of our
own strength to go through with it. < - >
In the middle of this work I finished my fourth
year in this place, and kept my anniversary with
the same devotion, and with as much comfort, as
ever before; for by a constant study, and serious
application of the word of God, and by the assist-
ance Of his grace, I gained a different knowledge
ftom what I had'before; I entertained different
notions of things; I looked now upon -the world as
a thing remote; which I'h&d nothing to do with,
no expectation from, andftideed no desires about:
in a tvord/I had nothing indeed to do with ityhor
Was ever like to have; so lthought it looked, as we
may perhaps look upon it hereafter, viz. as a plac&
I had lived in, but was come out of it; and well
I might say, as father Abrahajn to Dives, Between
me and thee there- is ^greatgaiiph fixed. ' a

wickedness of the> worldE 4iett6:*<I had -neitfofci% tha

petitor, none to dispute-sovereignty or command
w.th me; I might have raised ship-loadings of corn,
but I had no use for it; so I let as little grow as I
thought enough for my occasion: I had tortoises,
or turtles enough; but now and then one was as
much as I could put to any use: I had timber
enough to have built a fleet of ships; I had grapes
enough to have made wine, or to have cured into
raisins, to have loaded that fleet when they had
been built
But all I could make use of, was all that was
valuable: I had enough to eat, and to supply my
wants, and what was all the rest to rae? If I
killed more flesh than I could eat> the dog must
e#t it, or the veimin; if I sowed more corn tliaa
I could eat, it must be spoiled: the trees that I
cut down were 1} ing to rot on the ground, I could
make no more use of them than for fuel; and that
I bad no occasion for, but to dress my food*
In a word, the nature and experience of things
dictated to me, upon just reflection, that all the
good things of this world are no farther good to
us> than as they are for our use: and that what-
ever we may heap up indeed to give to others, we
enjoy as much as we can use, and no more. The
asaost covetous griping misqr in the world would
have been cuned of the vice of covetousness, if he
Jaad been in my case; for I possessed infinitely
more that* I kaew what to 4a wifh^ I had no
mo^ for desite, except it w$s of things which I
bad not,, awd tbey v&re bu,t trifles, though indeed
of gneat m& to me. I had,, a$ I hinted before, a
parcel of tnqney, as well gold as silver, about
thirty-six poitfcd^ sterling;. ais&I there* tfee nasty,
z
sorry, useless stuff lay; I had no manner of busi-
ness for it; and I often thought with myself, that
I would have given an handful of it for a gross of
tobacco-pipes, or for an hand-mill to grind my
corn; nay, I would have given it all for six-penny
worth of turnip and carrot seed out of England, or
for an handful of peas and beans, and a bottle of
ink: as it was, I had not the least advantage by
it, or benefit from it; but there it lay in a drawer,
and grew mouldy with the damp of the cave in
the wet season; and if I had had the drawer full of
diamonds, it had been the same case; and they
had been of no manner of value to me, because of
no use.
I had now brought my state of life to be much
easier in itself than it was at first, and much easier
to my mind, as well as to my body. I frequently
aat dbwn to my meat with thankfulness, and ad-
mired the hand of God's providence, which had
thus spread my table in the wilderness. I learned
to look more upon the bright side of my condition,
and less upon the dark side; and to consider what
I enjoyed, rather than what I wanted; and this
gave me sometimes such secret comforts, that I
cannot express them; and which I take notice of
here, tQ put those discontented people in mind of
it, who caumot enjoy comfortably what God hath
given them* becfuise they see and covet something
th^t he&as not igiyen them: all our discontents
about what we w;ant> appeared to me to spring
from the want of thankfulness for what' we have*
Another reflection was of grjeajt,ti£erto4me, and
doubtless would \)§ibq to any #p& -tfe^tushould fall
into sttch ^distress as mine vir&s; and this was, to
comp&re my present condition with what I at first
expected it should be; nay, with what it would
certainly have been, if the good providence of Got)
had not wonderfully ordered the ship to be cast
up near to the shore, where I not only could come
at her, but could bring what I got out of her to
the shore for my relief and comfort; without
which I had wanted tools to work, weapons for de-
fence, or gunpowder and shot for getting my food*.
I spent whole hours, I may say whole days, in
representing to myself in the most lively colours,
how" I must have acted, if I had got nothing out
of the ship; how I could not have so much as got
any food, except fish and turtles; and that, as it
was long before I found any of them, I must have
perished first: that I*should have lived, if I had
not perished, like a mere savage: that if I had
killed a goat or a fowl by any contrivance, I had
no way to slay or open them, or part the flesh
ftofti the skin and the bowels, or to cut it up; but
must gnaw it with my teeth, and pull it with my
ckws, like a beast.
These reflections made me very sensible of the
goodness of Providence to me, and very thankful
for1 my present condition, ^with all its hardships
arid niisfortun^s * and this-part • &1 sb i cannot but
recomtnetid to the'refteetioft of> those wlio are^apt

some people^ are, and" what^their cas£ might have
been, if Providence &ad thdught^fit. - * > ^ '
I had afrotfa^r -reflection which assisted mt alsb
z 2
to comfort my mind with hopes; and this was,
comparing my present condition with what I had
deserved, and had therefore reason to expect from
the hand of Providence; I had lived a dreadful
life, perfectly destitute of the knowledge and fear
of God: I had been well instructed by my father
and mother; neither had they been wanting to
me in their early endeavours, to infuse a/ religious
awe of God into my mind, a sense of my 4uty,
and of what the nature and end of my being ac-
quired of me. But, alas! falling early into; the^sea-
faringlife, which of all the lives is the nio$]t fl^&fii-
tutejo&the fear o£ God, though his tenuis are
always before them, I say, falling, early into the
seafaring life, and* into seafaring company, all that
little sense of < religion owhich I »had entertained,
was laughed out of me hy nay messmates; by.an
hardened .despising lof dangjer^ and the views of
death, which grew habitual to me; by my \Qt\g
absence from all manner of opportunities to con-
yerse with any thing but what was like myself, or
to hear any thing of what was good, or tended to-
wards it / • i

I had terrible reflections upon my mind for
ftMrty months, as I have already observed, on the
adcount of my wicked and hardened life past; and
wfceiT I looked about me, and considered what
t&ftfttalaff Providences had attended me, since my
cllttiitfg into this place, and how God had dealt

sonous, which I might have fed on to my huVt;
no savages to murder and devour me.
In a word, as my life was a life of sorrow one
way, so it was a life of mercy another: and I
wanted nothing to make it a life of comfort,- but
to be able to make my sense of God's goodness *d
me, and care over me in this condition, be my
daily consolation; and after I made a just improve-
ment of these things, I went away, and Was no
more sad. ' '
I had now been here so long, that jfiany things
whiqh I brought on shore for my help, were either
quite gone^ or veiy much wasted^ and frear spent.
My ink,*as I observed, had beeii gone for some
time,, all but a very little, which I eked out with
water a little and a little, till it was so pale it scarce

long as it lasted, I made use of it to minute dowh
the days of the month on which any remarkable
thing happened to me; and first, breasting up
times, past* I remember that there was a strahge

which befell me, andwhicty if I-had been super-
stifciously inclined to observe days'as fatal or for-

war, and made a steve*
, Tb# same day of the year that I escaped out of
the wreck of that ship in Yarmouth Roads, that
same day of the year afterwards I made mjr escape
from Sallee in the boat.
The same day of the year I was born on, viz.
the aoth of September, the same day I had my
life so miraculously saved 26 years after, when I
was jcast on shore in this island; so that my wicked
life, and solitary life, both began on a day.
The, next thing to my ink's being wasted, was
that of my bread, I mean the biscuit which I
brought out of the ship. This I had husbanded to
the last dpgree, allowing myself but one cake of
bre^4 a day, for above a year: and yet I was quite
without bread foit a year before I got any corn of
m}7 own; and great reason I had to be thankful
that,I had any at aH, the getting it being, as has
be^n already observed, next to miraculous.
,My clothes too began to decay mightily: as to
linen* I had none a good while, except some die*
quered shirts which I found in the chests of th&
other seamen,^ atid which I carefully preserved,

One reason why I could not go quite naked,
was, I could not bear the heat of the sun so well
when quite naked, as with some clothes on; nay,
the very heat frequently blistered my skin;. whereas,
with a shirt on, the air itself made some motion,
and whistling under the shirt, was twofold Cooler
than without it: no more could I ever bring my-
self to go out in the heat of the sun without a cap
or an hat; the heat of the sun beating with such
violence as it does in that place,, would give me
the head-ach presently; by. darling so directly on
my head, without a cap or. hat on, so that I could
not bear it; whereas, if I put on my hat, it would
presently go away. :
Upon these views I began to consider about
putting the.few rags I had, which I called clothes,
into some order; I had worn out all the waistcoats
I had, and my business was now to try if I could
not make jackets out of the great watch-coats
which I had by me, and with such other materials
as I had; so I set to work a-tailoring, or rather in-
deed a botching.; for I made most piteous work
of it. However, I made shift to make two or
three waistcoats, which I hoped would serve me
a great while; as for breeches or drawers, I made
but very sorry shift.indeed, till afterwards.
I have mentioned that I saved, the skins of all
the creatures that I killed, T mean four-footed
ones; and I had hung them up stretched out with
sticks in the sun; by which means some of ihetx\
were so dry and hard, that they were fit for little;
but others, it seems, were very useful. The first
thing I made of these was a great cap for my
 ,
head, with the hair on the outside to shoot off
the rain; and thi3 I peiformed so well, that after
this I made a suit of clothes wholly of those skins;
that is to say, a waistcoat and breeches open at
the knees, and both loose; for they were lather
wanted to keep me cool, than to keep me warm.
I must not omit to acknowledge, that they were
Wretchedly made; for if I was a bad carpenter, I
was a worse tailor: however, they were such as I
made a very good shift with; and when I was
abroad, if it happened to rain, the hair of the waist-
coat and cap being outmost, I was kept very dry.
After this I spent a deal of time and pains to
make me an umbrella: 1 was indeed in gieat want
of one, and had a great mind to make one: I had
seen them made in the Brasils, wheie they are very
useful in the great heats which are there; and I
felt the heats every jot as great here, and greater
too, being nearer the equinox; besides, as I was
obliged to be much abroad, it was a most useful
thing to me, as well for the rains as the heats. I
took a world of'pains at it, and was a great while
before 1 could make any thing likely to hold; nay,
after I thought I had hit the way, I spoiled two
or three before I made one to my mind; but at
last I made one that answered indifferently well;
the main difficulty I found was to make it to let
down. I could make it to spread; but if it did
not let down too, and draw in, it would not be
portable for me any way, but just over my head,
which would not do. However, at last, as I said,
I made one to answer; I covered it with skins,
th$ hair upwards, so that it cast off the rain like
2 A
a pent-house, and kept off the sun so effectually,,
that I could walk out in the hottest of the weather,
with greater advantage than I could before in the
coolest; and when I had no need of it, I could
close it, and carry it under my arm.-
Thus I lived mighty comfortably, my mind
being entirely composed by resigning to the will
of God, and throwing myself wholly upon the
disposal of his Providence: this made my life bet-
ter than sociable; for when I began to regret the
want of conversation, I would ask myself, whether
thus conversing mutually with my own thoughts,
and, as I hope, I may say, with even my Maker,
by ejaculations and petitions, was not better than
the utmost enjoyment of human society in the
world?
I cannot say, that after this, for five years, any
extraordinary thing happened to me; but I lived
on in the same course, in the same posture and
place just as before: the chief thing.I was em-
ployed in, besides my yearly labour of planting
my barley and rice, and curing my raisins, of both,
which I always kept up just enough to have suffi-
cient stock of the year's provisions before-hand; I
say, besides this yearly labour, andiny daily labour
of going out with my gun, I had one labour to
make me a canoe, which at last I finished: so that
by digging a canal to it, six feet wide, and four
feet deep, I brought it into the creek, almost half
a mile. As for the first, that was so vastly big,
as I made it without considering beforehand., as, I
ought to do, how I should be able to launch it;
»o never being able to bring it to the water, or
bring the water to it, I was obliged to let it lie
where it was, as a memorandum to teach me to be
wiser next time. Indeed the next time, though
I could not get a tree proper for it, and was in a
place where I could not get the water to it, at any
less distance than, as I have said, of near half a
mile; yet as I saw it was practicable at last, I
never gave it over; and though I was near two
years about it, yet I never grudged my labour, in
hopes of having a boat to go off to sea at last.
However, though my little periagua was finished,
yet the size of it was not at all answerable to the
design which I had in view, when I made the first;
1 mean of venturing over to the terra firma, where
it was above forty miles broad; accordingly, the
smallness of my boat assisted to put an end to that
design, and now I thought no more of it. But as
I had; a boat, my next design was to make a tour
round the.island; but as I had been on the other
side, in one place, crossing, as I have already de-
scribed it, over the land, so the discoveries I made
in that journey made me very eager to see the
other parts of the coast; and now I had a boat, I
thought of nothing but sailing round the island.
For this purpose, and that I might do every
thing with discretion and consideration, I fitted
upra little mast to my boat, and made a sail to it
out of some of the pieces of the ship's sails, which
lay in store, and of which I had a great store by
me.
Having fitted my mast and sail, and tried the
boat, I found she would sail very well. Then I
2 A 2
made little lockers and boxes at each end of my
boat, to put provisions, necessaries^ and ammuni-
tion, &c. into, to be kept dry, either from rain, or
the spray of the sea; and a little long hollow place
I cut in the inside of the boat, where I could lay
my gun, making a flap to hang down over it to
keep it dry.
I fixed my umbrella also in a step. at. the stern,
like a mast, to stand over my head,, and keep the
heat of the sun off me, like an awning; and thus
I every now and then took a little voyage upon
the sea, but never went far out, nor far from the
little creek; but at last, being eager to view the
circumference of my little kingdom, I resolved
upon my tour, and accordingly I victualled, my
ship for the voyage; putting in two dozen of my
loaves (cakes I should rather call them) of barley^
bread; an earthen pot full of parched rice, a food
I eat a great deal of; a little bottle of rum, half a
goatj and. powder with shot for killing more, and
two large watchrcoats, of those which, as J men*
tioned before, I had saved out of the seamen's
chests; these I took, one to lie .upon, and the other
to cover me in.the night
It-was the sixth of November, in the sixth year
of my reign, or my captivity, which you please*
that I set out on this voyagerand I found,it much
longer than I expected: for though the island
itself was not very large, yet when I came to the
east side of it, I found a great ledge of rocks lie
out about two leagues into the sea, some-above
water, some under it; and beyond thisv a shoal of
sand, lying dry half a league more; so that I was
obliged to go a great way out to sea to double that
point.
- When I first discovered them, I was going to
give over my enterprize, and come back again, not
knowing how far it might oblige me to go out to
sea, and above all, doubting how I should get back
again; so I came to an anchor, for I had made me
a kind of an anchor with a piece of broken grap-
pling which I got out of the ship.
. Having secured my boat, I took my gun, and
went on shore, climbing up an hill, which seemed
to overlook that point, where I saw the full extent
of it, and resolved, to venture.
In my viewing the sea from that hill where I
stood* I perceived a strong, and indeed, a most fu-
rious current, which ran to the east, even came
close to the point; and I took the more notice of
it, because I saw there might be some danger,
that when I came into it, I might be carried out
to sea by the strength of it> and not be able to
tfnake the island again. And indeed, had I not
gotten first upon this hill, I believe it would have
been so; for there was the same current on the
other side of the island, only that it set it off at a
farther distance; and I saw there was a strong
eddy under the shore; so I had nothing to do but
to get out of the first current, and I should pre-
sently be i n an eddy.
I lay here, however, two days; because the wind
blowing pretty fresh (E. at S* E. and that being
just contrary to the said current) made a great
breach of the sea upon the point; so that it was
not safe for me to keep too close to the shore for the
breach, nor to go too far off because of the stream.
The third day in the morning, the wind having
abated over night, the sea was calm, and I ven-
tured; but I am a warning-piece again to all rash
and ignorant pilots; for no sooner was I come to
the point, when I was not my boat's length from
the shore, but I found myself in a great depth of
Avater, and a current like the sluice of a mill. It
carried my boat along with it with such violence,
that all I could dos could not keep her so much as
on the edge of it: but I found it hurried me far-
ther and farther out from the eddy, which was on
the left hand. There was no wind stirring to help
me, and all that I could do with my paddles sig-
nified nothing: and now I began to give myself
over for lost; for, as the current was on both sides
the island, I knew in a few leagues distance they
must join again, and then I was irrecoverably
gone; nor did I see any possibility of avoiding it:
so that I had no prospect before me but of perish-
ing; not by the sea, for that was calm enough,
but of starving for hunger. I had indeed found a
tortoise on the shore, as big almost as I could
lift, and had tossed it into the boat; and I had a
great jar of fresh water, that is to say, one of my
earthen pots: but what was all this to being dri-
ven into the vast ocean, where, to be sure, there
was no shore, no main land or island, for a thou-
sand leagues at least!
And now 1 saw how easy it was for the Provi-
dence of God to make the most miserable condi-
tion that mankind could be in, worse. Now I
looked back upon my desolate solitary island, as
the most pleasant place in the world, and all the
happiness my heart could wish for, was to be there
again. I stretched out my hand to it with eager
wishes; O happy desert, said I, I shall never see
thee more! O miserable creature! said I, whither
am I going! Then I reproached myself with my
unthankful temper, and how I had repined at my
solitary condition; and now what would I give to
be on shore there again! Thus we never see the
true state of our condition, till it is illustrated to
us by its contraries; nor know how to value what
we. enjoy, but by the want of it It is scarce pos-
sible to imagine the consternation I was now in,
being driven from my beloved island (for so it ap-
peared to me now to be) into the wide ocean, al-
most two leagues, and in the utmost despair of
ever recovering it again: however, I worked hard,
till indeed my strength was almost exhausted; and
kept my boat as much to the northward, that is,
towards the side of the current which the eddy lay
on, as possibly I could; when about noon, as the
sun passed the meridian, I thought I felt a little
breeze of wind in my face, springing up from the
S. S. E. . This cheared my heart a little, and espe-
cially when in about half an hour more, it blew a
pretty small gentle gale. By this time I was got-
ten at a frightful distance from the island; and,
had the least cloud or hazy weather intervened, I
had been undone another way too; for I had no
compass on board, and should never have known
how to have steered towards.the, island, if I had .
but once lost sight of it; but the weather continu-
ing clear, I applied myelf to get up my mast again
and spread my:sail, standing away to the north as
much as possible, to get out of the current.
Just as I had set my mast and sail, and the boat
began to stretch away, I saw even by the clear-
ness of the water, some alteration of the current
was near; for where the current was so strong, the
water was foul; but perceiving the water clear, I
found the current abate, and presently I found to
the east, at about half a mile, a breach of the sea
upon some rocks; these rocks I found caused the
current to part again; and as the main stress of it
ran away more southerly, leaving the focks to the
north-east, so the other returned by the repulse of
the rock, and made a strong eddy, which ran back
again to the north-west with a very sharp stream,
They who know what it is to have a reprieve
brought to them upon the ladder, or to be rescued
from thieves just going to murder them, or who
have been in* such like extremities, may guess
what my present surprise of joy was, arid how
gladly I put my boat into the stream of this eddy;
and the wind also freshening, how gladly I spread
my sail to it, running cheerfully before the wind,
and with a strong tide or eddy under foot..
This eddy carried me about a league in my way
back again directly towards the island, but about
two leagues more towards the northward than the
current lay, which carried me away at first; so
that when I came near the island; I found myself
open to the northern shore of it, that is to say,
the other end of the island, opposite to that which
I went out from.
When I had made something more than a league
of way by the help of this current or eddy, I found
it was spent, and saved me no farther. However,
I found, that being between the two great cur-
rents, viz. that on the south side which had hur-
ried me away, and that ou the north, which lay
about two leagues on the other side; I say, be-
tween these two, in the west of the island, I found
the water at least still, and running no way; and
having still a breeze of wind fair for me, I kept on
steering directly for the island, though not making
such fresh way as I did before.
About four o'clock in the evening, being then
within about a league of the island, I found the
point of the rocks which occasioned this distance,
stretching out as is described before, to the south-
ward, and, casting off the current more southerly,
had of course made another eddy to the north;
and this I found very strong, but directly setting
the way my course lay, which was due west, but
almost full north. However, having a fresh gale,
I stretched across this eddy, slanting north-west,
and in about an hour came within about a mile of
the shore, it being smooth water, I soon got to
land.
When I was on shore, I fell on my kne$s> and
gave God thanks for my deliverance, resolving to
lay aside all thoughts of my deliverance by my
boat; and refreshing myself with such things as I
had, I brought my boat close to the shore, in a
little cove that I had espied under some trees, and
laid me down to sleep, being quite spent with the
labour and fatigue of the voyage.
2 B
I was now at a great loss which way to get home
with my boat; I had run so much hazard, and
knew too much the case, to think of attempting
it by the way I went out; and what might be at
the other side (I mean the west side) I knew not,
nor had I any mind to run any more ventures; so I
only resolved in the morning to make my way
westward along the shore, and to see if there was
no creek where I might lay up my frigate in safety,
so as to have her again if I wanted her. In about
three miles, or thereabouts, coasting the shore, I
came to a very good inlet, or bay, about a mile
over, which narrowed till it came to a very little
rivulet, or brook, where I found a convenient har-
bour for my boat, and where she lay as if she had
been in a little dock made on purpose for her: here
I put in, and having stowed my boat very safe, I
went on shore to look about me7 and see where I
was.
I 50011 found I had but a little passed by the
place where I had been before when I travelled on
foot to that shore; so taking nothing out of my
boat but my gun and my umbrella, for it was exceed-
ing hot, I began my march: the way was comforta-
ble enough after such a voyage as I had been upon,
and I reached my old bower in the evening, where
I found every thing standing as I left it; for J
always kept it in goad order, being, as I said be-
fore, my country-house.
I got over the fence, and laid me down in the
shade to rest my limbs, for I was very weary, and
fell asleep: but judge you, ifyouGan, that read
my story, what a surprise I must be in, when I
was- awaked out of my sleep by a voice calling me
by my name several times, Robin, Robin, Robin
Crusoe, poor Robin Crusoe! Where are you, Ro-
bin Crusoe? Where are you? Where have you
been?
I was so dead asleep at first, being fatigued with
rowing, or paddling, as it is called, the first part of
the day, and walking the latter part, that I did
not awake thoroughly; and clozfng between sleep-
ing and waking, thought I dreamed that somebody
spoke to. me: but as the voice continued to repeat
Robin Crusoe, Robin Crusoe, at last I began to
awake more perfectly, and was at first dreadfully
frighted, and started up in the utmost consterna-
tion: but no sooner were my eyes open, but 1 saw
my Poll sitting on the top of the hedge, and im-
mediately knew that this was he that spoke tome;
for just in sucb bemoaning language I had used to
talk to him, and teach him; and he had learned
it so perfectly, that he would sit upon my finger,
and lay his bill close to my face, and cry, Poor
Robin Crusoe, Where are you? Where have you
been?? How came you here?—and such things as I
had taught him.
However, even though I knew it was the par-
rot and that indeed it could be nobody else, it
was a* good while befdte I could compose myself.
Firsts I was amazed how the creature got thither,
and then how he should just keep about the place,
and no where else: but as I was well satisfied it
could be nobody but honest Poll, I got it over;
and holding out my hand, and calling him by his
name, Poll, the sociable creature came to me, and
2b 2
sat upon my thumb, as he used to do, and continued
talking to me, Poor Robin Crusoe, and, how did I
come here? and, where had I been? just as if he
had been overjoyed to see me again; and so I car-
lied him home along with me.
I had now had enough of rambling to sea for
some time, and had enough to do for many days
to sit still, and reflect upon the danger I had been
in. I would have been very glad to have had my
boat again on my side of the island, but I knew
not how it was practicable to get it about. As to
the east-side of the island, which I had gone round,.
I knew well enough there was no venturing that
way; my veiy heart would shrink, and my very
blood run chill, but to think of it; and to the other
side of the island, I did not know how it might be
there; but supposing the current ran with the
same force against the shore at the east, as it passed
by it on the other, I might run the same risk of
being driven down the stream, and carried by the
island, as I had been befoie of being carried away
from it: so with these thoughts I contented my-
self to be without any boat, though it had been
the product of so many months labour to make it,,
and of so many more to get it into the sea.
In this government of my temper I remained
near a year, lived a very sedate retired life, as you
may well suppose; and my thoughts being very
much composed, as to my condition, and fully
comfoited in resigning myself to the dispensations
of Providence, I thought I lived really very hap-
pily in all things except that of society.
I impioved myself, in this time, in all the me-
chanic exercises which my necessities put me upon
applying myself to; and I believe could, upon oc-
casion, have made a very good carpenter, especially
considering how few tools I had.
Besides this, I arrived at an unexpected perfec-
tion in my earthen ware, and contrived well enough
to make them with a wheel, which I found infi-
nitely easier and better, because I made things
round and shapeable, which before were filthy
things indeed to look on. But I think I never
was more vain of my own performance, or more
joyful for any thing I found out, than for my being
able to make a tobacco-pipe; and though it was a
very ugly "clumsy $fing when it was done, and
only burnt red likfe^other earthen-ware, yet as
it was hard and firta, and would draw the smoke,
I was exceedingly comforted with it; for 1 had
been always used to smoke, and there were pipes
in the ship, but I forgot them at first, not knowing
there was tobacco in the island; and afterwards,
when I searched the ship again, I could not come
at any pipes at all.
In my wicker-ware I also improved much, and
made abundance of necessary baskets, as well as
my invention shewed nte, though not very hand-
some, yet convenient for my laying things up in,
or fetching things home in. For example, if I
killed a goat abroad, I co\ild hang it up in a tree,
flay it, and dress it, and fcutit in pieces, and
bring it home ib<a basket; 'and the like by a tur-
tle: I could cut it up, take or^t: the eggs, afid a
piece or two of the flesh, which was enough for
me, and bring them home in a basket, and leave
the rest behind me: also large deep baskets were
my receivers for my corn, which I always rubbed
out as soon as it was dry, and cured; and kept it
in great baskets instead of a granary.
I began now to perceive my powder abated con-
sideiably; and this was a want which it was im-
possible for me to supply : then I began seriously
to consider what I must do when I should have
no more powder; that is to say, how I should do
to kill any goats. I had, as I observed, in the
third year of my being here, kept a young kid,
and bied her tame; I was ira hopes of getting an
he kid, but I could not bycany means bring it to
pass, till my kid grew an aWf- goat; and I could
never find in my heart to killeher, till she died at
last of mere age.
But being now in the eleventh year of my resi-
dence, and, as I have said, my ammunition grow-
ing low, I set myself to study some art to trap
3nd snare the goats, to see whether I could not
catch some of them alive; and particularly I
wanted a she-goat great with young.
To this purpose I made snares to hamper them;
and believe they were more than once taken in
them; but my tackle was not good, for I had no
wire, and always found them broken, and my bait
devoured.
At length I resolved to try a pit-fall; so I dug
several large pits in the earth, in places where I
had observed the goats used to feed, and over
these pits I placed hurdles of my own making too,
with a great weight upon them; and several times
I put ears of barley, and dry rice, without setting
the trap; and I could easily perceive that the goats
had gone in, and eaten up the corn, that I could
see the mark of their feet: at length, I set three
traps in one night, and going the next morning,
I found them all standing, and yet the bait eaten
and gone. This was very discouraging; however,
I altered my trap; and, not to trouble you with
particulars, going one morning to see my traps, I
found in one of them a large old he-goat; and, in
one of the others, three kids, a male and two
females.
As to the old one, I knew not what to do with
him; he was so fierce I durst not go into the pit
to him; that is to say, to go about to bring him
away alive, which was what I wanted; I could
have killed him, but that was not my business,
nor would it answer my end; so I e'en let him
out, and he ran away as if he had been frightened
Qtytof his wits; but I did not then know what I
afterwards learned, that hunger would tame a
lion: if I had let him stay there three or four days
without food, and then hftve carried him some
watfr to drink, and then a little corn, he would
have been as tame as one of the kids; for they are
mighty sagacious, tractable creatures, where they
gre well used.
However, for the present I let him go, knowing
no fetter at that time; then I went to the three
kids*; and taking them one by one, I tied them
with strings together; ancL with some difficulty
brought the$n aH home*
It was a good while before they would feed ;
but throwing them some isweet corn, it tempted
them, and they began to be tame: and now I found,
that if I expected to supply myself with goats-1
flesh, when I had no powder or shot left, breeding
some up tame was my only way, when perhaps I
might have them about my house like a flock of
sheep.
But then it presently occurred to me, th&t I
must keep the tame from the wild, or else they
would always run wild when they grew up; and
the only way for this was to have some inclosed
piece of ground, well fenced either with hedge or
pale, to keep them up so effectually, that those
within might not break out, or those without
break in,
This was a great undertaking for one pair of
hands; yet as I saw there was an absolute necessity
of doing it, my first piece of work was to find out
a proper piece of ground; viz. where there was
likely to be herbage for them to eat, water for
them to drink, and cover to keep them from the
sun.
Those who understand such inclosures, will
think I had very little contrivance, when I pitched
upon a place very proper for all these, being a plain
open piece of meadow-land or savanna (as our peo-
ple call it in the western colonies) which had two
or three little drills of fresh water in it, and at one
end was very woody; I say they? will smilelat my
forecast, when I shall tell the<m< T began my in-
closing of this piece of ground in*sxich a manner,
that my hedge, or pale, must have been at least
two miles about; nor was the madness of it so
great as to the compass; for if it was ten miles
abopt, I was like to have time enough to do it in;
but I did not consider, that my goats would be as
wild in so much compass, as if they had had the
whole island; and I should have so much room to
clrase them in, that I should never catch them.
My hedge was began and carried on, I believe,
about fifty yards, when this thought occurred to
me; so I presently stopped short, and for the first
beginning I resolved to enclose a piece of about
150 yards in length, and 100 yards in breadth,
which as it would mam tain as many as I should
have in any reasonable time, so, as my flock in-
creased, I could add more ground to my enclosure.
This was acting with some prudence, and I went
to work with courage. I was about three months
hedging in the first piece; and, till I had done it,
I tethered the three kids in the best part of it, atad
used thenvto feed as near me as possible, to make'
them familiar; and very often I would go and
carry them some ears of badey, or an handful of
rice, and feed them out of my hand; so that after
my enclosure was finished, and I let them loose,
they would follow me up and down* bleating after
me for an handful of corni
This answered my end, and in about a year and
a half I had a flock of about twelve goats, kids4
and all; and in two years more I had three-and-
forty, besides several that I took and killed for
my food; and after that I enclosed five several
pieces of ground to feed them in, with little pens
to drive them into, to take them as I wanted them;
and gates out of one piece of ground into another.
But this was not all; for now I not only had
2 C
goat's fle^b to feed on when I pleased, but u>ilk
tqo, a thing which indeed in my beginning I 4id
ftof so much as think of, and which, when it came
into my thoughts, was really an agreeable surpiise;
for now I set up my dairy, and had sometimes a
gallon or two of milk in a day. And as Nature,
who gives supplies of food to every creature, idic-
tates even naturally how to make use of it, so I,
that never milked a cow, much less a goat, or saw
butter or cheese made, very readily and handily,
rthoqgh after a great many essays and miscarriages,
made ;me both butter and cheese at last, and never
waited it afterwards.
Hpw mercifully can our great Creator treat his
creatures, even in those conditions in which they
$een}ed to be overwhelmed in destruction! How
can he sweeten the bitterest providences, and give
us cause to praise him for dungeons and prisons!
What a table was here spread for me in a wilder-
ness, where I saw nothing at first but to peiish for
hunger!
It would have made a stoic smile, to have seen
jine and my little family sit down to dinger: the^re
was my majesty, the prince and lord of the w,hpl#
inland; I had the lives q£ all my subjects at abso-
lute cpmmand; I could hang; diaw, give life #nd
liberty, and take it atyay, anjl no rebels among all
my subjects!
Then to see howjike.a kipg I dined too, all
alone, attended by n\y servants! Poll, as if he had
been my favQurite, as the only person permitted
to talk to mej my dog, which was < now grown
very old and crazy, and found nQ species to mul-
tiply his kind upon, sat always at my right hand;
antl1 tvtfo cats, one on one side the table, and one
&ti the other, expecting now and then a bit from
ttyy 'band, as a mark of special favour.
But these were not the two cats which I brought
on shore at first; for they were both of them dead,
and had been interred near my habitation by my
own hands; but one of them having multiplied by
I know not what kind of creature, these were two
^hich I preserved tame, whereas the rest ran wild
into the woods, and became indeed troublesome to
me at last; for they would often come into my
house, and plunder me too, till at last I was Obliged
to sftobt them, and did kill a great many; at
length they left me with this attendance, and in
this plentiful manner I lived; neither could I be
said to want any thing but society, and of that, in
some time after this, I was like to have too much.
I Was something impatient, as I had observed,
to have the use of my boat, though very loth to
run any more hazard: and therefore sometimes I
Sat contriving ways to get her about the island,
°aud at other times I sat myself down contented
^tttiiigh without her. But I had a strange uneasi-
ness m my iriind to go down Jto the point of the
Ifcfand; where, as I have Said in my last ramble, I

the current set, that I might see what I had to do:
thisf fo^lta&tn&ii iftA'gased upon me every day; and
at lefegth'I resolved to tiavfcl thither by land, and
following thte^edge of the shore, I did so: but had
any one in1 England been to meet such d nlati a& 1
was, it must either have frighted them; tir r&i&ed
2 c 2
a great deal of laughter; and as I frequently stood
still to look at myself, I could not but smile at the
potion of my travelling through Yorkshire with
such an equipage, and in such a dress. Be pleased
to take a sketch of my figure, as follows:
I had a great high shapeless cap, made of goat's-
$kin, with a flap hanging down behind, as well to
keep the sun from me, as to shoot the rain oft'
from running into my neck; nothing being so
hurtful in these climates, as the rain upon the flesh
under the clothes.
I had a short jacket of goat's*skin, the skirts
coming down to about the middle of my thighs;
and a pair of open-kneed breeches of the same:
the breeches were made of a skin of an old he-
goat, whose hair hung down such a length on
either side, that, like pantaloons, it reached to the
middle of my legs. Stockings and shoes I had
none; but I had made me a pair of something, I
scarce knew what to call them, like buskins, to
flap over my legs, and lace on either side like spat-
terdashes; but of a most barbarous shape, as indeed
were all the rest of my clothes.
I had on a broad belt of goatVskin dried, which
I drew together with two thongs of the same, in-
stead of buckles; and in a kind of frog on either
side of this, instead of a sword and dagger, hung
a little saw and a hatchet; one on one side, one
on the other: I had another belt not so broad,
and fastened in the same manner, which hung over
my shoulder; and at the end of it^ under my left
arm, hung two pouches, bath made of goat's-skki
too; in one of which hung my powder, in the
^ther my shot: at my back I carried my basket,
on my shoulder my gun, and over my head a great
clumsy ugly goat's-skin umbrella, but which, after
all, was the most necessary thing I had about me,
next to my gun: as for my face, the colour of it
was really not so Mulatto like, as one might ex-
pect from a man not at all careful of it, and living
within nine or ten degrees of the equinox. My
beard I had once suffered to grow till it was about
a quarter of a yard long; but as I had both scis-
sars and razors sufficient, I had cut it pretty short,
except what grew on my upper lip, which I had
trimmed into a large pair of Mahometan whiskers,
such as I had seen worn by some Turks whom I
sawiat Sallee: for the Moors did not wear such,
though the Turks did. Of these mustachios, or
whiskers, I will mrt say they were long enough to
hang my Wat inpon them; but they were of length
and shape monstrous enough, and such as in En*
gland would have passed for frightful.
. B&t all this is by the bye; for as to my figure,
I had so f$W to observe me, that it was of no
manner of consequence; so I say no more to that
part: in this kind of figure I weht my new jour-
ney, and was out five or six days. I travelled first
along the sea-shore, directly to the place where I
fkst brftjgjht my boat to an auchor* to get up upon
the rooks^ and, having no boat now ta take care
of, b weftt'oner 4the tend a tieia#er way, to the satae
height that I wa& i»p<n> before when looking for-
ward to titoe point of the rock which lay out, and
which I was/ to, cUmbte- with' my boat, as I said
above, I was surprised to see-'the sea ail smooth
and quiet; no rippling, no motion, no current, any-
more there than in other places.
I was at a strange loss to understand this, and
resolved to spend some time in the observing of it,
to see if nothing from the sets of the tide had oc-
casioned it: but I was presently convinced how it
was; viz. that the tide of ebb setting from the
west, and joining with the current of waters from
some great river on the shore, must be the occasion
of this current; and that according as the wind
blew more forcible from the west, or from the
north, this current came near, or went farther
from the shore; for, waiting thereabouts till eveii-
ing, I went up to the rock again, and then the
tide of ebb being made, I plainly saw the ctrrrent
again as before, only that it ran farther off, being
near half a league from the shore; whereas in iny
case, it set close upon the lsliOre, and hurried me
in my canoe along with it, which at another time
it would not have done.
This observation convinced me, that I had no-
thing to do but to observe the ebbing and the
flowing of the tide, and I might very easily bring
my boat about the island again: but when I beg&n
to think of putting it in practice, I had such a ter-
ror upon my spirits at the reffiembrance of the dan-
ger I had been in, that I fcduld not think' of it
again with any patience; but, on the contrary, I
took up another resolution, Which was more safe,
though more laborious; and this was, that I would
build, or rather make me another periagua, or
canoe; and so have one for one!side of the island
and one for the other.
< You are to understand, that now I had, as I may
call itr two plantations in the island; one my little
fortification or tent, with the wall about it under
th&rock, with the cave behind me, which by this
time I had enlarged into several apartments or
cares, one within another. One of these, which
was the driest and largest, and had a door yet be-
yond my wall or fortification, that is to say, be-
yond where my wall joined to the rock, was all
filled up with large earthen pots, of which I have
giv*en^an aecount, and with fourteen or fifteen
gr$atfbaskets, which would hold five or six bushels
each, where I laid up my stores of provision, espe-
cially tny corn, some in the ear cut off short from
the straw, and the other rubbed out with my
hands.
^s for my wall, made aa- before, with long stakes
or,, piles, those piles grew all like trees, and were
by this time grown so big> and spread so very
much, that there was not the least appearance, to
any one's view, of any habitation behind them;
Near this dwelling of mice, but a little farther
within the land, and upon lower ground, lay my
Ufo pieces of corn ground; which I kept duly
cultivated and sowed> and which duly yielded me
thek harvest in its season: and whenever I had
occasion for more cora, I had more land adjoining
as fit as that. i ^ - i ,
Besides this, I had my,country-seat, and I had
now a tolerable plantation there also* for first, i
had ray..little bower, as I called it> which I kept
in repair? that is to say, I kept the badge which
circled it in, constantly fitted^upt£<*oU& mSnai
height, the ladder standing always in the inside; I
kept the trees, which at first were no more than
my stakes, but were now grown veiy firm and tall;
I kept them always so cut, that they might spread
and grow thick and wild, and make the more
agreeable shade, which they did effectually to my
mind. In the middle of this I had my tent always
standing, being a piece of a sail spread over poles
set up for that purpose, and which never wanted
any repair or renewing; and under this I had
made me a squab or couch, with the skins of the
creatures I had killed, and with other soft things,
and a blanket laid on them, such as belonged to
our sea-bedding, which I had saved, and a great
watch-coat to cover me; and here, whenever I had
occasion to be absent from my chief seat, I took
up my country habitation.
Adjoining to this I had my enclosures for my
cattle, that is to say, my goats: and as I had taken
an inconceivable deal of pains to fence and enclose
this ground, I was so uneasy to see it kept entire,
lest the goats should break through, that I never
left off, till with infinite labour I had stuck the out-
side of the hedge so full of small stakes, and so
near to one another, that it was rather a pale than
an hedge, and there was scarce room to put an
hand through between them, which afterwards,
when those stakes grew, as they all did in the
next rainy season, made the enclosuie strong, like
a wall, indeed stronger than any wall
This will testify for me that I was not idle, and
that I spared no pains to bring to pass whatever
appeared necessary for my comfortable support ;>

for I considered the keeping up a breed of tame
creatures thus at my hand, would be a living maga-
zine of flesh, milk, butter and cheese, for me, as
long as I lived in the place, if it were to be forty
years; and that keeping them in my reach, de-
pended entirely upon my perfecting my enclosures
to such a degree, that I might be sure of keeping
them together; which by this method indeed I so
effectually secured, that when these little stakes
began to grow, 1 had planted them so very thick,
.,| was forced to pull some of them up again.
In this place also I had my grapes growing,
which I principally depended on for my winter
store of raisins, and which I never failed to pre-
serve very carefully, as the best and most agreea-
ble dainty of my whole diet; and indeed they were
not only agreeable, but physical, wholesome, nou-
rishing, and refreshing to the last degree.
As this was also about half way between my
other habitation and the place where I had laid up
my boat, I generally staid and lay here in my way
thither; for I used frequently to visit my boat,
and I kept all things about or belonging to her in
very good order: sometimes I went out in her to
divert, myself, but no more hazardous voyages
would I go, nor scarce ever above a stone's cast or
two from the shore, I was so apprehensive of be-
ing hurried out of my knowledge again by the cur-
rents, or winds, or any other accident. But now
I come to a new scene of my life.
It happened one day about noon, going towards
my boat, I was exceedingly surprised with the
print of a man's naked foot on the shore, which
2 D
was very plain to be seen in the sand. I stood like
one thunderstruck, or as if I had seen an appari-
tion. I listened, I looked round uie, I could hear
nothing, nor see any thing; I went up to a rising
ground to look farther. I went up the shore, and
down the shore, but it was all one, I could see no
other impression but that one. I went to it again
to see if there were any more, and to observe if it
might not be my fancy, but there was no room for
that, for there was exactly the very print of a fgqfe
toes, heel, and every part of a foot: how it caiiff
thither I knew not, nor could in the least imagiae*
But after innumerable fluttering thoughts, like a
man perfectly confused, and out of myself, I came
home to my fortification, not feeling, as we say,
the,ground I went on, but terrified to the last de-
gree, looking behind me at every two or three
steps, mistaking every bush and tree, and fancying
every stump at a distance to be a man; nor is it
possible to describe how many various shapes ^n
Affrighted imagination represented things to me
in; how many wild ideas were formed every mo-
jnent ip my fancy, and, what strange unaccountable
whimsies came into my thoughts by the way. -
When I came to my.castjp, for so,I think I cabled
it ever after this, JMfled into it like* one pursued;
whether I went^ over t>y the l#dc|er, as first con-
trive^ or went in ^t thejjoje in {hepck, which I
called a door^ I tcannot remember; for never
frighted hare fled to poy$ft or fosf (to earth, with
more terror of mipd^th^ I t(> this retreat
I had no sleep that pight; the farther I waq from
the occasion of my ff ight, the gje^F j^j^pprehen-
sions were; which is Something contrary to the
nature of such things, and especially to the usual
practice of all creatures in fear. But 1 was so em-
barrassed with my own frightful ideas of the
thing, that I formed nothing but dismal imagina-
tions to myself, even though I was now a great
way off it. Sometimes I fancied it must be the de-
vil; and reason joined in with me upon this suppo-
sition. For how should any other thing in human
shape come into the place? Where was the vessel
that brought them? What marks were there of
any other footsteps? And how was it possible a
friati should come there? But then to think that
Satan should take human shape upon him in such
a place, where there could be no manner of occa-
sion for it, but to leave the print of his foot behind
him, and that even for no purpose too (for he
could: not be sure I should see it,) this was an
amazement the other way. I considered that the
devil might have found out abundance of other
ways to have terrified me, than this of the single
print of a foot. That as I lived quite on the other
Side of the island, he would never have been so
simple to leave a mark in a place where it was ten
thousand to one whether I should ever see it or
not; knd in the sand too, which the first surgre of
the sea upon ati high wind would have defaced
entirely. All this seemed inconsistent with the
thing itself, Wd with all notions we usually enter-
tain of^he subtlety of the devil. ~
Abundance of such thirigs} & 'these assisted to
argue me out of all appreheiisions of its being the
devil. And* I presently concluded that it must be
2 d 2
some more dangerous creature; viz. That it must
be some of the savages of the main land over
against me, who had wandered out to sea in their
canoes, and, eithei chiven by the currents, or by
contraiy winds, had made the island; and had
been on shoie, but were gone away again to sea,
being as loth, perhaps, to have staid in this deso-
late island, as I would have been to have had them.
While these reflections were rolling upon rrtv
mind, I was very thankful in my thought, that I
was so happy as not to be thereabouts at that time,
ot that they did not see my boat, by which they
wduld have concluded, that some inhabitants had
been in the place, and perhaps have searched far-
ther for me. Then terrible thoughts racked my
imaginations about their having found my boat,
and that there were people here; and that if so, I
should certainly have them come again in greater
numbers} and devour me; that if it should happen
sQtthat they should not find me, yet they would
ffnd my enclosure, destroy all my corn, carry away
alLmy flock of tame goats, and I should perish at
la$tfoi* mere want
.Thus my fear banished all my religious hope: all
tb#t former confidence in Goi>,f which was founded
upop sueh wonderful experience* a&I had had of
hi§; goodness^ iqaw vanished; as if *he that had fed
me by jmiracle hitheiito,<> could not preserve by his
power the provision whieh he had made for me by
his goodness. I reproached myself with my uneasi-
ness, that J would mob sow any more corn one year,
than would just serve tad till the next season, as if
no accident eould intervene to^prevent ttiy enjoying
the crop,, that was upon the ground. And this I
thpught so just a reproof, that I resolved for the
future(tohave two or three years coin before-hand,
sp that whatever might come, I might not perish
for want of bread.

Siickb thsvmne^ea siiteiofohnman life; and it
afforded m&i a great many curious speculations
afterward vwhen> I had a little recovered my first
surprise.. I oomidered* that thisrwis <ihe station of
life the infinitely wise and good providence of God
had determined for me; that as I could not fore-
see what the ends of divine wisdom might be in all
this, so I was not to dispute his sovereignty, who,
as I was his creature, had an undoubted right, by
creation, to govern and dispose of me absolutely
as he thought fit; and who, as I was a creature
who had offended him, had likewise a judicial
right to condemn me to what punishment he
thought fit; and that it was my part to submit to
bear his indignation, because I had sinned against
him.
I then reflected, that God, who was not only
righteous, but omnipotent, as he had thought fit
thus to punish and afflict me, so he was able to de-
liver me; that if he did not thjnk fit to do it, it
was my unquestioned! duty to resign myself abso-
lutely and entirely to his will. And, on the other
hand, it was my duty also to hope in him, pray to
him, and quietly to attend the dictates and direc-
tions of his daily providence.
These thoughts took me up many hours, days,
nay, I may say, weeks and months; and one par-
ticular effect of my cogitations on this occasion I
cannot omit; viz. one morning early, lying in piy
bed, and filled with thoughts about my danger from
the appearance of savages, I found it discomposed
me very much; upon which those words qf the
scripture came into my-thoughts,"" Call mpoi\ me
in the day of trouble, and I will deliver thee, jand
thou shalt glorify me."
Upon this, rising chearfully out of my bed, my
heart was not only comforted, but I was guided
and encouraged to pray earnestly to God for deli-
verance. When I had done praying, I took up
my bible, and opening it to read, the first words
that presented to me, were, " Wait on the Lord,
and be of good cheer, and he shall strengthen thy
heartr wait, I say, on the Lord." It is impossible
to eKpress the comfort this gave me; and in return,
I thankfully laid down the book, and was no more
£ad, at least, not on that occasion.
In the middle of these cogitations, apprehen-
sions, and reflections, it came into my thoughts
odd day, that all this might be a mere chimera of
my own, and that this foot might be the print of
infy own foot, when I came on shore from my boat.
This cheared me up a little too, arid I began to
persuade myself it was 411 a delusion; that it was
nothing else but my own foot; and why might not
I tome4 that way from the boat as well as I was
going that way to the boat? Again, I considered
also, that I could by no means tell for certain
where I had trod, and where I had not; and that,
if at last this was only the print of my own f6ot,
I had played the part of those fools, who strive to
make istories of spectres atid apparitions, and theii
are'themselves frighted at them more than any
bodjr efed. -
^Now 1 ^egki^ itt tdlce * ctfurage, -and to peep
kBroasdla$aiii; fbrT^iadnot "sfthhd out of my cas-
flfc fdt thVefe da^ anrf i^ght^ so that I tegan to

within dobi^' but1 some barley-bakes and water.
Then I knew that my goats \^anted to b£ milked
too, which lis^ll^Hv^s1 my evening divwsibti} and
the pofcr cfea^ture^ vtrtrg itr'gre&t1 patfi and incon-
venience for want of it; and indeed it almost
spoiled some of them, and almost dried up their
milk.
Heartening myself therefore with the belief,
that this was nothing but the print of one of my
own feet, (and so I might be truly said to start at
my own shadow,) I began to go abroad again, and
went to my country-house to milk my flock; but
to see with what fear I went forward, how often I
looked behind me, how I was ready, every now-
and-then, to lay down my basket, and run for my*
life; it would have made any one have thought I
was haunted with an evil conscience, or that I had
been lately most terribly frighted; and so indeed I
had.
However, as I went down thus two or three
days, and having seen nothing, I began to be a lit-
tle bolder, and to think there was really nothing in
it but my own imagination; but I could not per-
suade myself fully of this, till I should go dpwn
to the shore again, and see this print of a foot,
and measure it by my own, and see if there was
any similitude or fitness, that I might be assured
it was my own foot. But when I came to the
place first, it appeared evidently to me, that when
I laid up my boat, I could not possibly be on shore
any where thereabouts. Secondly, when I cacpe
to measure the mark with my own foot, I found
my foot not so large by a great deal* Both these
things filled my head with new imaginations, and
gave me the vapours again to the highest degree;
so that I shook with cold, like one in an ague* and
I went home again, filled with the belief that sQmd
man or men had been on shore there; or, in short
that the island was inhabited, and I might be sur-
prised before I was aware; and what course to take
for my security, 1 knew not.
, O what ridiculous resolutions men take, when
possessed with fear! It depiives them of the use
of those means which reason offers for their relief.
The first thing I proposed to myself was, to throw
down my inclosures, and turn all my tame cattle
wild into the woods, that the enemy might not
find them, and then frequent the island in prospect
of the same, or the like booty; then to the simple
thlng^of digging up my two corn-fieldsr that they
might not find such a grain there, and stilf to be
prompted to frequent the island: theil to demolish
my bov|pr and tent, that they might not see any
vestiges^of my habitation, and be prompted to look
farther, in order to find out the persons inhabiting.
These were the subjects of the first night*s Cogi-
tation^ after I was come homejagatn, while the ap-4
prehensions which had so over-run my mind were
frlesh upon me, and my head was full of vapours,
a& above. Thus fear of danger is ten thousatid
times more terrifying than danger itself, when ap-
parent to the eyes; and we find the burden of
af*x?ety, greater by much than the evil which we
af6 anxious ahout; but, which was worse than all
this, I had not that relief in this trouble frOtti the
resignation I used to practise thatl hoped to have.
I looked, t thought, Hke SaoV^ho' complained
not only that tfap Philistines were upon liim, but
that Goto had forsaken him; fbr I did not now-
take due ways to compose my mind, by crying to
God in my distress, and resting upon his proVl-

deuce, as I had done before, for my defence alld
deliverance; which if I had done, I had at leasts
been more cheerfully supported under this ne\ir
surprise, and perhaps carried through it with more
resolution.
This confusion of my thoughts kept me waking
#11 night; but in the morning I fell dsleep, &nd
having by the amusement of my mind been, ajs it
were, tired, and my spirits exhausted, I slept very
roundly, and awaked much better composed that*
I had evetf been before. And now I began to think
sedately; and, upon the utmost debate withjsmy-
JscrtfJ* L concluded, that this island, which waatao
exceeding pleasant, fruitful, and no farther froih
the*main land than as I had seen, was nei sa,en-
tirely abaridoned as I might imagine. That* al-
though there were no statfed inhabitants who lived
! oft the spot; yet that there-might sometimes come
boats off from the shore, who either ^with design,
c*r perhaps never but when they were driveti by
1 cross wifids, might come to this place.
* That I had lived here fifteen years now, and bad
not met with the least shadow or figure of atiy
people before; and that if at any time they should
be driven hefe, it was probable they went away
again as soon as ever they could* seeing they had
newef thought fit tb fix* there upon any occasion,
to this tittie.
* That the nlost I ctould suggest any danger from,
wasl ftrtfrn any such casual accidental landing ©f
straggling {pfeople from the main, who, as it was
I likely, if the^ wfcre driven hitheiy were here against
their will&j <so they mads no jst#y hfciEe^r&u* went
off again with all possible speed, seldom staying
<me>night on shore, lest they should not have the
iielp of the tides and day-light back again; and
that therefore I had nothing to do but to consider
of some safe retreat, in case I should see any sa-
vages land upon the spot.
Now I begun sorely to repent that I had dug
any cave so large, as to bring a door through again,
$rhich door, as I said, came out beyond where my
'fortification joined to the rock. Upon maturely
considering this, therefore, I resolved to draw me
a second fortification, in the manner of a semi-
circle, at a distance from my wall, just where I
had planted a double row of trees about twelve
years before, of which I made mention; these-trees
having been planted so thick before, there wanted
but a few piles to be driven between them, that
^ihey should be thicker and stronger, and my wall
would be soon finished.
So that I had now a double wall, and my outer
wall was thickened with pieces of timber, old
cables^ and every thing I could think of to make
it strong; having in it seven little holes, about as
big as I might put my arm out at. In the inside
^f this I thickened my wall to about ten feet thick,
continually bringing earth out of my cave, and
laying it at the foot of the wall, and walking upon
it; and through the seven holes I contrived to
plant the tnusketsy of which I took notice that I
got seven 0& shore out of the &hij»; these, I say,
I planted tike my cannon, and fitted thejx* into
frames that held them like a carriage, ^hat-sal
«©uid fire aH th© seven guns in two mkuites* time:
as %
this wall I was many a weary month in finishing,
and yet never thought myself safe till it was done.
When this was done, I stuck all the ground,
without my \Vall, for a great way every ,way$, $s
full with stakes or sticks of the osier-like wood,
which I found so apt to grow, as they could weH
stand; insomuch that I believe I might set in near
twenty thousand of them, leaving a pretty large
space between them and my wall, that I might
have room to see an enemy, and they might have
no shelter from the young trees, if they attempted
to approach my outer wall.
Thus in two years time I had a thick grove; And
in five or six years time J had a wood before mj
<J welling, grown so monstrous thick and strong,
that i,t was indeed perfectly impassable; and np
man of what kind soever would ever imagine that
there was any thing beyond it, much less an habi-
tation : as for the way I proposed myself to go in
and out (for I left no avenue) it was by getting
two ladders; one to a part of the lock which was
lpw, and then broke in, and left room to place an-
other laddei; upon that; so when the two ladders
were taken down, no man living,could come down
to me without mischiefing himself; and if they
lpcl come down,, they wete stijl qu the outside of
my outer walk i
Thus I took all the^measuneis frjunaapLpfudence
could suggest far iny own preservation} $nd it will
be seen. at l^gth, that they were, not altogether
without ju$t,re&son; though I .fqiesaw nothing at
that time more ^han my inhere fjear.sugge^ed,
While this was doing, I was not altogether care*
less fcf my other affairs; for I had a great concern
upon me for my little herd of goats; they were
mot*oftly a prdsent supply to me upon every occa-
sional and began,to he sufficient forme, without
tht1 expense of powder and shot, but also abated
the fatigue of my hunting after the wild ones; and
I was* loth to lose the advantage of them, and to
fabve 4hem all to nurse up over again.
i 3To this purpose, after long consideration, I could
-think1 but of two ways to preserve them: one was
tb find another convenient place to dig a cave
under ground, and to drive them into it every
bight; and the other was to enclose two or three
little'bits of land, remote from pne another, and as
much concealed as I could, where I might keep
about half a'dozen yoiing goats in* each place; so
&h£t if any disaster happened to the flock in gene-
ral,11 might be able to raise them again with little
trouble and time: anld this, though it would re-
quire a great deal of time and labour, I thought
was the most rational design.
Accordingly I spent some time to find out the
HiOsfc^retired parts of the island; and I pitched
ttporo one, "which was as private indeed as my heart
<i&uld wish; ?for it Was a Httle damp piece of ground
*& 4he  fniddle of-^fcbe follow and thick woods,
where, as is observed, I almost lost myself once
IStefbr^V ende&fr&wriog'to come back that way from
tflietfeasttfm fkn of the island: here SI found a clear
pideettaf^d^Qea? three aefes, so surrounded with
woorfs that it wa£ almost &fc in&osure by nature;
at least' it did <&tit \teat near so much labour to
make it so, as the other pieces of ground I had
worked so hard at.
I immediately went to work with this piece df
ground, and in less than a month's time I had so
fenced it round, that my flock or herd, call it
which you please, which were not so wild now as
at first they might be supposed to be, were well
enough secured in it. So without any farther de-
lay, I removed ten she-goats and two he-goarts po
this piece; and when there, I continued 'to* per-
fect the fence, till I had made it as secure as tlfe
other, which, however, I did at more leisure/ and
it took me up more time by a great deal. {( ' *
All this labour I was at the expense of, pufely
from my apprehensions on the account qf the
print of a man's foot which I had seen; for as yet,
I never saw any human creature come neai^ tftte
island, and I had now lived two years under these
uneasinesses, which indeed made my life much
less comfortable than it was before; as may ivell
be imagined, by any who know what it is to
live in the constant snare of the fear of man: and
this I must observe with grief too, that the dis-
composure of my mind had too great impressions
also upon the religious part of my thoughts: for
the dread and terror of falling into the hands of
savages and cannibals lay so upon my spirits, t&at
I seldom found, myself in a due temper for applica-
tion to my Maker; at least, not with the sedate
calmness and resignation of soul whidh I was wont
to do. I rather prayed to God as under grfcat
affliction and pressure of mind, surrounded with
danger, an4 in expectation every night of being
gtjvr4ejred and devoured before the morning; and I
must testify from my experience, that a temper of
peace^ thankfulness, love and affection, is much
jji^r^ tjie proper frame for prayer than that of ter-
XQV and discomposure; and that under the dread of
niischief, impending, a man is no more fit for a
comforting performance of the duty of praying to
CffiV) tfian he is for repentance on a sick-bed; for
^hepe discomposures affect the mind as the others dp
the body; and the discomposure of the mind must
ijecessarily be as great a disability as that of the
body, and much greater: praying to God being
properly an act of the mind, not of the t>ody.
^ JJut; tp go on: after I had thus secured one part
_o£ my little living stock, I went about the whole
|slan<|, searching for another private plac&, to make
sjiclj another deposit; when wandering more to the
x^est point of the island than I had ever dotie yet,
#nd looking out to sea, I thought I saw a boat upon
tlje sea at a great distance. I had found a "per-
spective gHss or two in one of the seamen's chests,
I which t saved out of our ship; but I had it not
about me; and this was so remote, that I could
not tell what to make of it, though I looked at it
1^11 my eyes were npt able to look any longer: whd-
fther It was a boat, or nqt, I do not ^now; but as I
, descend from the hill, I co\ild see no more
of it, so I gave it over; only I resoled to go no
more without a perapective glass in iny pocket. -
When I was come down the hill, tb the end of
the island, where indeed I had^tever been before,
I was presently convinced) that the Seeing the
|)riiijtqf a inan's foot, was not siich^a strange thing
in the island as 1 imaginedyW<l, bilttfittt ftVas a
special Providence that I was cast upon tlie side
of the island where the savages never came, I
should easily have known, that nothing was more
frequent than for the canoes from the main, when
they happened to be a little too far out at sea, to
shoot over to that side of the island for harbour;
likewise, as they often met and fought iri their ca-
noes, the victors, having taken any--.prisoners,
would bring them over to this shore, where, ac-
cording to their dreadful customs, being all canni-
bals, they would kill and eat them: of which here-
after, • -, -<
..When I was come down the hill to-the shore,-as
I said above, being the S. W. point of the island,
I was perfectly confounded and amazed; nor is it
possible for mc to express the horror of my mind,
at seeing the shore spread with skulls, hands, fee%
and other bones of human bodies; and particularly
I observed a place where there had been a fire
made, and a circle dug in the earth, like a cock-
pit, where it is supposed the savage wretches -had
sat down to their inhuman feastings upon the hoo-
dies of their fellow-creatures.
I was so astonished with the sight of these
things, that I. entertained no notions of any dajif
ger to myself irom it, for. a lpng while; all my-ap-
prehensions, were buried in the thoughts of such a
pitch of inhuman, hellish brutality^'and the horror
of the degeneracy qf human nature-; which; though
I had heard of, often, yet I never had so neara
view of before: in.shorty I.turned away my face
from the horrid spectacle, my stomach grew sick,
and I was.just at, the point of fainting,*: when na-
ture discharged the disorder from my stomach.

sted, having vomited with at* uncommon violence,
J~wa# a little relieved, but could not bear to stay in
the place a moment; so I got me up the hill again
with all the speed I could, and walked on towards
my own habitation.
' When I came a little out of that part of the is-
land, I stood still awhile as amazed; and then re-
fcovermg myself, I looked up with the utmost af-
fection of my soul, and, with a flood of tears in my
eyes; gave Gox> thanks, that had castmy first lot in
# part of the w<!>rid where Iwas distinguished from
such dreadful creatures as these; and that though
1 had efstefemed my present condition very misera-
ble, had yet given me so many comforts in it, that
I had still more to* give thanks for than to com-
plain' of; and* this above all, that I had, even in
this miserable condition, been comforted with the
knowledge of himself, and the hope of his bless-
ing, which was a' felicity more than sufficiently
equivalent to all the1 misery which I had suffered
or could suffer.
^"I& this fr&me of thankfulness I went home td
my castle, and began to be much easier now, as to
the safety of my circumstances, than ever I was
Jilsfore; for I observed, that these wretches never
cfwne to this island in seareh of what they could
get; perhaps nbfr seeking, no& Wanting, or not ex-
J>ecting any thing here; and having often, no
dmibt, <been up in* the cdvered woody part of it,
without* finding* any thing to their purpose. I
knew I h®d been here now almost eighteen years,
and never saw the least footsteps of a human crea-
ture there Jbefore; and might be here eighteen

was m*>fe cautious of firing my gun, lest any of
them du the island should happen to hear it; and
it was therefore a very good providence to me,
that I had furnished myself with a tame breed of
goats, that I had no need to hunt any more about
the woods, or shoot at them; and if I did catch
$&f more? of them after this, it was with traps and
Snares, as I had done before: so that for two years
after this, I believe I never fired my gun once off,
though I never went out without it; and, which
W&& iftore,; as I had sa^ed three pistols out of the
ship, i always carried them out with me, or at least
two of them, sticking them in my goat-skin belt.
I likewise furbished up one of the great cutlasses
th&tfi had out of the ship, and made me a belt to
j5nt it in also; so that I was now a most formida-
ble fellow to look at when I went abroad, if you
add to the former>description of myself, the par-
ticular of two pistols, and a great broad-sword
hianging at my side in a belt, but without a scab-

'how I mipht destroy some of these monsters in
their cruel bloody entertainment, and, if possible,
save the victim they should bring hither to destroy.
It would take up a larger volume than this whole
work is intended to be, to set down all the con-
trivances 1 hatched, or rather brooded upon in my
thoughts, for the destroying these creatures, or at
least frightening them, so as to prevent their com-
ing hither any more; but all was abortive; nothing
could be possible to take effect, unless I was to be
there to do it myself; and what could one man
do among them, when perhaps there might be
twenty or thirty of them together, with their darts,
or their bows and arrows, with which they could
shoot as true to a mark as I. could with my gun?
Sometimes I contrived to dig an hole under the
place where they made their fire, and put in five
or six pounds of gunpowder, which when they
kindled their fire, would consequently take fire,
and blow up all that was near it; but, as in the
first place I should be very loth to waste so much
powder upon them, my store being now within the
quantity of a barrel, so neither could I be sure of
its going off* at any certain time, when it might
surprise then); and, at best, that it would do little
more than just blow the fire about their ears, and
fright them, but no.t sufficient to.make them for-
sake the place;.so .1 laid it.aside, and then pro-
povsed^ that,I would place anys-elf in ambush, in
some convenient .place, with my three guns all
double-loaded, and in the middle of their bloody
ceremony l$t ,|y at them, when I should be surs
to kill-or. wound perhaps two or three at every
shot; and then falling in upon them with my thrfee
pistols and my sword, I made no doubt but tHtft,
if there were twenty, I should kill them all: thfe
fancy pleased my thoughts for some weeks, and I
was so full of it that I often dreamt of it;^and
sometimes, that I was just going to let fly at them
in my sleep.
I went so far with it in my indignation, that I
employed myself several days to find oiit proper
places to put myself in ambuscade, as I said, ^5
watch for them; and I went frequently to the
place itself, which was now grown more fatfnliar
to me; and especially while my mind was 4hus
filled with thoughts of revenge, and of a bloddy
putting'twenty or thirty of them to the sword, ks
I may call it; but the horror I had at the place,
and at the signals of the barbarous wretches de-
vouring one another, abated my malice.
Well, at length I found a place in thd side df
the hill, where I was satisfied 1 might securely
wait till I saw any of the boats coming, and might
then, even before they would be ready to come on
shore, convey myself unseen into thickets of trees,
in pne of which there was an hollow large enough
to conceal ixie entirely; and wheref<I rnight'sitj
and observe ell their bloody doings, and' take mf
full aim .at, their * heads, when they xv&te so close!
together** $3 <;thalt iit>would>be next/to impossible
th^t J^ho^idimiss/my shoot, or that I could fail
wouudingjtjiree or fodnof them atrthefkst shoot.
In ,th]&5 place ^thean^iresolved to fix^hiy design;
and accordingly I Spared two nrfuskeM *and friy
ordinary: fowiing-pjeae* OThe^two-iHuakets^I loaded
with a* brace of slugs each, and four or five smaller
ballets* about the size of pistol-bullets, and the
f^wlinig-piece I loaded with near an handful of
swan-shot, of the largest size; I also loaded my
pistols with about four bullets each: and in this
posture, well provided with ammunition for a
second and third charge, I prepared myself for
my expedition.
, > After I had thus laid the scheme for my design,
and in jpuy imagination put it in practice, I conti-
nually njade my tour every morning up to the top
of the^iiUj which was from my castle, as I called
i^ abont three miles or more, to see if I could ob*
serve any boats upon the sea, coming near the
isjiand, or standing over towards it; but I begau
to ±ii;e of this hard duty, after. I had for two or
thi'ee>months constantly kept my watch; but came
always back without any < disco very, there having
not J** all that time been the least appearance, not
Gfliy on or near the shore, but not on the whole
QC£au, so far as my eyes or glasses could reach
e^ery way.
;*%$ long as I kept up my daily tour to the hill t&
lqak out, so long also I kept up) the vigour of my
df jsigo, and my spirits seemed to he all the white
i$r& suitable frame for so*©utrageousan execution,

to have no other guide than that of their o\vn abo-
minable and vitiated passions; and consequently
were left, and perhaps had been for some ages, to
act such horrid things, and receive such dreadful
customs, as nothing but nature, entirely abandoned
of Heaven, and actuated by some hellish degene-
racy, could have run/them into; but now, when,
as I have said, I began to be weary of the fruitless
excursion which I had made so long, and so far,
every morning in vain; so my opinion of the
action itself began to alter, and I began, with
cooler and calmer thoughts, to consider what it
was I was going to engage in; what authority or
call I had to pretend to be judge and executioner
upon these men as criminals, whom Heaven had
thought fit for so many ages to suffer, unpunished,
to go on, and to be, as it were, the executioueis
of .his judgments upon one another; also, how far
these people were offenders against me, and what
Tight I had to engage in the quarrel of that blood
which they shed promiscuously one upon another.
T debated this very often with myself thus: How
do I know what God himself judges in this parti-
cular case? It is certain these people do not com-
mit this as a crime; it is not against their own
consciences reproving, or their light reproaching
them. They do not know it to be an offence, and
then commit it in defiance of divine justice, as we
do in almost all the sins we commit They think
it no more a crime to kill a captive taken in war,
than we do to kill an ox; nor to eat human flash)
than we do to eat mutton.
When I had considered this a lifctk, it followed
<0f RQ£f»S®N OBUSDE. 225
mC£mwily> that I was certamiy in f the wrong in
it^tfoftt these people were not murderers in the
sens^bat I had before condemned them in my
thoughts, any more than those Christians were
murderers, who often put to death the prisoners
takm in battle, or more frequently, upon many
occasions, put whole troops of men to the sword,
without giving quarter, though they threw down
ttairasms. and submitted.
* ijn the next place, it occurred to jne, that albeit
l&Gyu§age they gave one another was thus brutish
^n^dnjniman,' yet it was really nothing >to^me:
tbe#e jpe&ple had done me no injury: that if!they

name of & Spaniard is reckoned to be frightful and
terrible to all people of humanity, or of Christian
compassion: as if the kingdom of Spain weie par-
ticularly eminent for the product of a race of men,
who were without principles of tenderness, or the
common bowels of pity to the miserable, which is
leckoned to be a maik of a generous temper in
the mind.
These considerations really put me to a pause,
and to a kind of a full stop; and I began by little
and little to be off of my design, and to conclude
I had taken a wrong measure in my resolutions to
attack the savages; that it was not my business
to meddle with them, unless they first attacked
me, and this it was my business, if possible, to pre-
vent; but that, if I were discovered and attacked,
then I knew my duty.
On the other hand, I argued with myself, that
this really was the way, not to deliver myself, but
entirely to ruin and destroy myself; for unless I
was sure to kill every one that not only should be
on shore at that time, but that should ever come
on shore afterwards, if but one of them escaped
to tell their country-people what had. happened,
they would come over again by thousands to re-
venge the death of their fellows; and I should
only bring rupon .myself a certain destruction,
which atypresetitl/had no*man$er of occasion for.
"Kpoa'the wholey I-concluded, that neither in
principles nor impolicy) I,ought oneway or other
to concern myself in thi? affair: that my business
was by alii possible! mean® to conceal myself * from
them, and;trot-to leave the least signal to them to
guess by, that there were any living creatures upon
the island, I mean of human shape.
• Religion joined in with this prudential, and I
was convinced now many ways that I was perfectly
out of my duty, when I was laying all my bloody
schemes for the destruction of innocent creatures,
I mean innocent as to me; as to the crimes they
were guilty of towards one another, I had nothing
to do with them; they were national punishments
to make a just retribution for national offences;
and to bring public judgments upon those who
Offend in a public manner, by such ways as best
please God.
This appeared so clear to me now, that nothing
was a greater satisfaction to me, than that I had
not been suffered to do a thing which I now saw
so much reason to believe would have been no less
a sin than that of wilful murder, if I had com-
mitted vit; and I gave most humble thanks on my
knees to God, that had thus delivered me from
blood-guiltiness; beseeching him to grant me the
protection of his providence, that I might not fall
into the hands of barbarians; or that I might not
lay my hands upon them, unless I had a more
t^lear call from Heaven to do it, in defence of my
own life.
In this disposition I continued for near a year
after this: and so far was I from desiring an occa-
sion for falling upon these wretches, that in all
that time I never once went? up the hill to see
whether there were.any of them in sight, or to
know whether any of them had been -on shore
there, or*nbtj~,that I might not betsmpted to re-

new any of my contrivances against thern^ of be
provoked, by any advantage which might present
itself, to fail upon them; only this I did, I went
and removed my boat, which I had on the other
side of the island, and carried it down to the east
end of the whole island, where I ran it into a little
cove which I found under some high rocks; and
where I knew, by reason of the currents; the sa-
vages durst not, at least would not,> come with
their boats, upon any account whatsoever. *
With my boat I carried away every thing that
I had left there belonging to her, though not ne-
cessary for the bare going thither; viz. a mast
and sail, whdch I had made for heiv and a thing
like an anchor, but indeed,- which could not be
called either anchor or grappling; however, it was
the best I could make of its kind. All these I re-
moved-, that there might not be the least shadow
of any discovery, or any appearance of any boatt
or of any habitation upon the island.
Besides this, I kept myself, as I said, more re-
tired than ever, and seldom went from my cell,
other than upon my constant employment, viz. to
milk my she-goats, and f manage rnylittle flock in
thewood* which, as it was vquite on the other part
of the island, was quite out of danger: fo* certain
it hi that these savage people^ .who sometimes
haunted this island, never came with any thoughts
of finding any tiling here,; and consequently never
wandered off frdm the? coast; and I doubt not but
they might .have been several times on shores after
my apprehensions^ of rtheiniihad made me cautious,
as well asjbefo^ andandeed I looked back with
or ROBINSON crusoi. 229
some htowor upon the thoughts of what ray condi-
tion .would have been, if I had chopped upon them,
and Jbeen discovered before that, when naked and
unarmed, except with one gun, and that loaded
often only with small* shot I walked every where
peeping and peering about the island, to see what
I could get: what a surprise should I have been
in, if, when I discovered the print of a man's foot,
I had instead of that seen fifteen or twenty savages
and found them pursuing me, and, by the swift-
ness of their running, no possibility of my escap-
ing them t
The thoughts of this sometimes sunk my very
soul within me, and distressed my mind so much,
that I cduki not soon recover it; to think what I
should have doiie, and how I not only should not
have been able to resist them, but even should not
have bad- presence of mind enough to do what I
might have done; much less what now, after so
much consideration and preparation, I might be
able to do. Indeed, after serious thinking' of
these things* I would be very melancholy, and
sometimes it would last a great white; but I re-
solved it at last all into thankfulness to that Pro-
vidence which had delivered me from so many un-
seen dangers^ amd had* kept me from those mis-
chiefs, which I couhj no way have been the agent
Mi-delivering myself from? became I had not the
leastnnotion 0f any mish things depending, or the
lea$t*s*&ppfc$iftioja yi\its rbeing*possibIe.
Thi$»>j$itetta<i a contemplation, which often had
come tQ myrthocightfr innfoitodr time? when first I
began to s6e>the smsrbiM dispositions^ Hfeaven,
in the -dangers we; run through inrftbis/iiffe; bow
wonderfully we are. delivered, when we knowmd-
thing of it: how, when we are in a quandaryi(ms
we call it) a doubt or hesitation, whether to, go
this way or t;hat way, a secret hint shall direct us
this way,, when we intended to go ano them way;
nay, when sense, our own inclination, and perhaps
business, has called to go the other way, yet a
strange impression upon the mind, from we know
not what springs, and by we know not whatpower,
shall over-rule us to go this way; and it shalivafi-
terwards appear, that had we gone that way which
we would have gone, and eveti to our imagination
ought to have gone, we should have been ruined
and lost. Upon these, and many like reflections* I
Afterwards made it a certain-rule with me,bthat
whenever 1 found those secret, hints^ or -pr<ds§ings
of my mind, to doingw no* doing any: thing that
presented, or to go^ng this way or that way, rl
never failed to obey the secret dictate; though I
-fcnew.iio other reason for it, than that such a pres*
sure, or such an hint, hung upon my minder I
could give many examples of the success of this
conduct in the course of my life; but more espe-
cially in the .latter part of my inhabiting this ui>-
happy island;, besides many occasions which it is
very likely I might,have taken* no tice-ofi 'ii. I had
seen with, the same eyes*then that I saw with now.
But it is neves >toou late to be wise & and I cannot
but advise all considering men, whogie liv^s are at-
tended with- suph^traordinaiy foeklenjfcs as mine,
or even though, not sa^^tr|Qrc(i3iary/)not tor slight
such secret intima^ons ^fi^roviden^^ let them
come fram wiiat invisible intelligence they will.
That I shall not discuss, and perhaps cannot ac-
count for; but certainly they are a proof of the
converse of spirits, and the secret communication
between those embodied, and'those unembodied;
and such a proof as can never be withstood; of
which I shall have occasion to give some very re-
markable instances, in the remainder of my soli-
tary residence in this dismal place.
I believe the reader of this will not think it
strange, if 1 confess that these anxieties, these
constant dangers I lived in, and the concern that
was now upon me, put an end to all invention, and
to all the contrivances that I had laid for ray fu-
ture' accommodations and conveniences, I had
the care of my safety more now upon my hands
than that of my food. I cared not to drive a nail,
or chop*a stick of wood now, for fear the noise I
should make should be^heard; much less would I
fire a gun, for the same reason; and above all, I
was* very uneasy at making any fire, lest the
smoke, which is visible at a great distance in the
day, should betray met and for this reason I re-
moved that f>art of my business, which required
fire, such as burning of pots and pipes, &c. into
my new'apartment'in the wood; where, after I
foad b&en some time, L found, to my unspeakable
GOft&ohttion,* a* mere natural * cave in the earth,
wfefcfa went in auvast way, and where, I dare say,
no savage, had he been at fche»mofuth of it, would
be so hardy* -a^ to-venture iny nor indeed would
any man else, hut one who, like me, wanted no-
thing so much ias a safe retreat.
23g l;f£ 4,nd Aj)v^jsrxui\5s
The mputh of this hollow was at the hQttym pf
a. great jock, where by mere accident (I would
say, if I did not see an abundant reason to ascribe
all such things now to Providence), I was c%ut^
ting down some thick branches of trees to make
charcoal; and before I go on, I must observe th$
reason of my making this charcoal, which \vas
thus:
I was afraid of making a smoke about my ha-
bitation, as I said before; and yet I could not live
there without baking my bread, cooking my me^k
&c. so I contrived to burn some wood here,, a$ I
had seen done in England under turf, till it became
chark, or dry coal; and then putting the fire out,
I preserved the coal to carry home, and perform
the atheu services .which fire was wanting format
home, without any danger of smoke. , , ,
But this by the bye. While I was cutting down
some wood here, Itperceivjed.that behind A.yery
thick branch of low brushwood, or underwood, there
was a kind of hollow place. I was curious to lopk
i#tp it, and getting with difficulty (into the mouth
of it, I found it was ^pretty large, that is to(say,
sufficient for. xpe to ,stand upright in it, and ppr-
haps another^Lth me;-bu,t J^jnupj; confejss to yo^,

However, after some ga^se^I jfiGpyffied.*nyAfHf9
and began to call myself a thousand fools, and tell
riiyself, that he that was afraid to see the devil, was
tiot 'fit to live twenty years in an island all alone,
and that I durst to believe there was nothing in
this cave that was more frightful than myself:
upon this, plucking up my courage, I took up a
large firebrand, and in I rushed again, with the
stick flaming in my hand. I had not gone three
steps in, but I was almost as much frightened as
T was before; for I heard a very loud sigh, like
that of a man in some pain; and it was followed
by a broken noise, as if of words half-expressed,
and then a deep sigh again. I stepped back, and
was indeed struck with such a surprise, that it put
me into a cold sweat; and if I had had an hat on
my head, I will not answer for it that my hair
might not have lifted it off. But still, plucking
Up my spirits as well as I could, and encouraging
myself a little, with considering that the power
and presence of God was every-where, and was
atble to protect me; upon this I stepped forward
again, and by the light of the firebrand, holding rt
up a little over my head, I saw lying on the ground
a most monstrous frightful old he-goat, just mak-
ing his will, as we sdy, gasping for life, and dying
indeed of mere old age. *
I stirred him'a little to see' if I could get him
out, and he essayed to get up, but was not able
ttf Vaise' himself; and I thought with myself, he
might even lie there; for if he had frightened me
so, he wotrld^cfertaiiily fright any of the savages, if
any of them should be so hardy as to come ^tt there,
while he bad any life in him. >*

I was now recovered from my surprize, and 'be*
gan to look round mej when I found the cave wa*
but very small; that is to say, it might be atrtmt
twelve feet over, but in no manner of shape, either
lound or square, no hands ever having been em-*
ployed in making it but those of mere nature. I
observed also, that there was a place at the farther
side of it that went in farther, but so low, that it
required me to creep upon my hands and knee*
to get into it, and whither it went, I knew not; ^6
having no candle, 1 gave it over for some time/
but resolved to come again the next day* provided!
with candles and a tinder box, which I had ni&de
of the lock of one of the musquets> with sonie wild-
fire in the pan.
Accordingly, the next day, I came provided
with six large candles of my own making (for I
made very good candles now of goats tallow); and
going into this low place, I was obliged to creep
upon all fours, as I have said, almost ten yards;
which, by the way, I thought was a venture bold
enough^ considering that I knew not how far it
might go, or what was beyond it. When I was
got through' the streight^ I found' the roof rose^
higher up, I believe near twenty feet; but never
was such a glorious sight see& in the island, t dai*ei
say, as it was, to look round the sideband roof of
this v&ult or cave. The walfe reflected an Mandred^
thousand lights to me from mytwo*teandl*e$: what
it was inthe>rdy<ik, whether diafflwttdsj t>* afay*6the#j
precious stones, or%okty which I rather ktippose' it
to be, I knewmok *
The place I was in was* & most delig&6ful*<&vity,
QJVgrpttcvof its kind, as could be expected, though
p$i$e£% dark; the floojr was dry and level, and
had, a sort of small loose gravel upon it; so that
-th^re was no nauseous creature to be seen; nei-
ther was there any damp or wet on the sides of
-the roofj the only difficulty in it was the en-
trance, which, however, as it was a place of secu-
rity, and such a retreat as I wanted* I thought
that was a convenience; so that I was really re-
joiced at the discovery, and resolved, without any
d§lay, to bring some of those things which I was
tt^stanxious about to this place; particularly, I
resolved.to taring hither my magazine of powder,
*ind ail my/spare arias, viz. two fowling-pieces (for
J had three in all) and three musquets (for of them
I had»eightin all);) so I, kept at my castle only five,
wjjhiah, stood ready jmounted, like pieces of cannon,
oji my'QUte^&tience^and were ready also to take
out i*pon any,expedition.
tUpto'this occasion of removing my ammunition,
Ijwas obliged; to open the harrfel of powder which
I took up outhof the sea, and which had .been wet c
and J found 4hat therwatefciiad penetrated about

I fancied myself now like one of the ancient
giants, which were said to live in caves anciitofe
in the rock, where none could come at them; f6r
I persuaded myself while I was here, if five hun-
dred savages were to hunt me, they could never
find me out; or if they did, they would not ven-
ture to attack me here.
The old goat, which I found expiring, died in
the mouth of the cave the next day after I itiade
this discoveiy; and I found it much easier to dig
a great hole there, and throw him in^ and coVer
him with earth, than to drag him out; so I interred
him theie, to prevent offence to my nose/
I was now in my twenty-third year of /residence
in this island, and was so naturalized to the place,
and to the manner of living', that could I have but
enjoyed the certainty that no savages'would come
to the place to disturb me, I could have been con-
tent to have capitulated for spending the rest of
my time there, even to the last moment, till I had
laid me down and died, like the old goat in the
cave. I had also arrived to some iitfcle diversions
and amusements, which made the time pass more
.pleasantly with me a great deal than it did before
as, first, I had taught my Poll, as I noted before,
to speak; and he did it so familiarly, and taljked
so articulately and plain, that it was very pleasant
to me; and he lived with me no less tljan six-^nd-
tvyeqty y^ars: hovp; l6ng he ii)ight live afterwards
I knew not; though I know they h^ave a notion in
the Brasils, that they ljve an hundred*years; per-
haps some of npy Polls may be aljve there still, call-
ing after poor Robin Crusoe 'to !ihis day; I wish
no Ei^gljshman the ill luck to come there and hear
them; but if he did, he would certainly believe it
Has the devil. My clog was a very pleasant and
laying companion to me for no less than sixteen
years of my time, and then died of mere old age;
#s for my cats, they multiplied, as I have observed,
to that degree, that I was obliged to shoot several
of them at first, to keep them from devouring me
ap4 all I had; but at length, when the two old
one&I brought with me were gone, and after some
r£hpe continually driving them from me, and let-
ting: them have no provision with me, they all ran
wild into the woods, except two or three fa-
Xpurites^ which I kept tame, and whose young,
when they had any, I always drowned, and these
were past of my family. Besides these, I always
|cept two or three household kids about me, which
I taught to feed out of my hand; and I had also
more parrots which talked pretty well^ and would
all tcali Robin Crusoe, but none like my first; nor,
indeed, did I take the pains with any of them that
I had done with him. I had also several tame sea-
fof\vls, whose names I know not, which I caught
upon the shore, and cut their wings; and the lit-
tle stakes, which I had planted before my castle
vyall, being now grown up to a good thick grove,
these fowls all lived among these low trees, and
bred there, which was very agreeable to me; so
ttwl as I said $bbve, 1 began to be very well con-
tended yrim the Jife t led, if it might but have
been securedlfrJ the <freadt>F savages.
Bi^t ltrwai otherwise directed; and it might not
be amiss'Tor Tail people who shall meet with my
story to make this just observation from it, viz.
How frequently, in the course of our lives, th^
evil which in itself we seek most to shun, and
which, when we are fallen into, is the most dread-
ful to us, is oftentimes the very means or door of
our deliverance, by which alone we can be raised
again from the affliction we are fallen into. I
could give many examples of this in the course of
my unaccountable life; but in nothing was it more
particularly remarkable, than in the circumstances
of my last years of solitary residence in this
island.
It was now the month of December, as I said
above, in my twenty ^third year; and this being the
southern solstice, for winter 1 cannot call it, was
the particular time of tny harvest, and required my
being pretty much abroad in the fields; when go-
ing out prdfcty early in ^he intoning, even before
it was thorough day-light, I <vas surprised with
seeing*a light of some ftre uptsm the shore, at a dis-
tance from me of about two miles, towards the
end d£the island, where I had observed some 'sa-
vages diad been, as before; but not on the other
sides abut to my great affliction, it was on my side
of.thensland. "
I was indeed 4erribly surprised at the sight, and
gtoppfcd short within TiW grov^ not daring to go
out^lejst^(mightibe/stit'pr?^ed; 'and^yet I had no
mone^peace" within^ftom't^fe ^prehensions I had,
th$t if ±hes^'tevag£&, ih ikmfalftig ovetf the island,
should fm&myxxfab1mtd%ng,*or ciit, or aiiy of my
works and in^r<mmetttS/th6y would htttadcfiately
conclude thaWtt^e^toe^eo^te-in^tliepl^cb, and
would then never give over till they found me out*
In this extremity I went back directly to my cas-
tle, pulled up the ladder after me, having made all
things.without look as wild and natural as I could.
Then I prepared myself within, putting myself
in a posture of defence. I loaded all my cannon,
as I called them, that is to say, my m usque ts,
which were mounted upon my new fortification^
and all my pistols, and resolved to defend myself
to the last gasp;, not forgetting seriously to re-
commend myself to the divine protection, and ear-
nestly,to pray to God to deliver me out of the
hands of the barbarians; and in this posture I €oe*
tiuued about two hours, but began to be mighty im-
patient for intelligence abroad, for I had no spies
to send out.
After sitting a while longer, and musing what I
should do in this ease, I was not able to bear sit-
ting in ignorance longer; so setting up my ladder
to the side of the hill, where there was a flat
place, as I observed before, and then pulling the
ladder up after me, I set it up again, and mounted
to the top of the hill; and pulling out my perspec-
tive glass, which I had taken on purpose, I laid: me
down flat on my belly on the ground* and began
to look for the plaqe. I presently found there
were no Jess than nine nafc^6rav§gesf^tti«ig round
a sm$l| fire ^heyvhad m£d§j,?$otrtoiwaign .there-
for they had na.&e^d of tthat* t&e weat&er being
extreme ^ot;. bi|tras I suj)pp^dr-to^dr^ss somemtf
their harh^mjis*. diet of humsa ilesh which .they
had brought with.,themy, whether sliye^r dead I
could not know.
They had two canoes with them, which they had
hauled up upon the shore; and as it w5§ then tide
of ebb, they seemed to me to wait the re turn of
the flood to go away again. It is not easy to ima-
gine what confusion this sight put me into, espe-
cially seeing them come on my side the island, and
so near me, too; but when I observed their coming
must be always with the current of the ebb, I be-
gan afterwards to be more sedate in my mind,
being satisfied that I might go abroad with safety
all the time of tide of flood, if they were notion
shore before; and having made this observatidft; I
Went abroad about my harvest work* with the
more composure.
As I expected, so it proved; for as soon as the
tide made to the westward, I saw them all take
boat, and row (Or paddle as we call it) all away.
I should have observed, that for an hour and more
before they went oif, they went to dancing, and
I could easily discern their postures' and gestures
by my glasses: I could only perceive, by my
nicest observation, Jthat they were stark naked,
and had not (the Idast covering upon them; bat
whether they were men or women, that I could
not distinguish.
As soon as Ilsawthem' shipped arid gome, Ltook
two guns uptaimy shoitldel*s, amd'two pistols at my
girdle, and my great sword by my side^ without a
scabbard^ and with all the speed Iiwas< able to
make, I went &way totfae bill^whfere'I had disco-
vered the first appearance of all. k As soon ai Iugot
thither, which tww n&$ less tkmitwo* houtrs (for
'I'coiftd ftbt go apace/ being ioi loaddtfewith arms
ow itOBiarsoN chusoe. £44
%$ I was), I perceived there had been tliree canoes
fnore«of savages on that place; and looking out
farther, I saw they were all at sea together, mak-
ing over for the main.
This was a dreadful sight to me, especially, when
going down to the shore, I could see the marks
«£ horror which the dismal work they had beep
about had left behind it, viz. the blood, the bones,
$ud paxt of the flesh of human bodies, eaten and
^voured by those wretches with merriment and
$$q$U I was so filled with indignation at the sight,
|that I began now to premeditate the destruction of
the nexjt that I saw there, let them be who or how
many soever.
- Itseenied^evident to me, that the visits which
they thus made to this bland were not very fre-
quent j'for it was above fifteen months before any
more of them came on shore there again; that is
to say, I never saw them, or any footsteps or sig-
nals,of them, in ail that time; for as to the rainy
p^asons, then they are*sure not to come abroad, at
feast notso far: yet all this while I.lived uncom-
l&rtably, by reason of the constant apprehensions I
imm m of theis <joming>upo« ra& by surprize; from
whence I observe, that the expectatioaof evil Ls
jEnare bitter *han}thq?*6flferipg, especially if there
i$,no mom to shfeke ^flS'that e^pee&ation or those
/apprehensions.

should be1 divided, as they were the last time, into
two pai'tl^; nor did I consider at all* that if I
killed one party, suppose ten or a dozen, I was
still the next day, or week, or month, t6 kill
another, and so another, even ad infinitum, till I
should be at length no less a, murderer than they
were in being men-eaters, and perhaps much
more so,
I spent my days now in great perplexity and
anxiety of mind, expecting that I should one day
or other fall into the hands of those merciless
creatures. If I did at any time venture abroad," it
Was not without looking round me with the great-
est care and caution imaginable; and now I found,
to my great comfort, how happy it was that I had
provided a tame flock or herd of goats; for I durst
not, upon any account, fire my gun, especially near
that side of the island where they usually came,
lest I should alarm the savages; and if they had
fled from me now, I was sure to have them come
back again, with perhaps two or three hundred
canoe3 with them in a few days, and then I knew
what; to expect

ne&r &s 1'cbiild'calculate? and"in myTour-and-tweu
tieth year, I had a yenr strange encoi^nter with
Ifo&'&ffllfaMJti 4?my mind, during ttmfifteen
or sixteen months interval, was very great; I slept
\mqulet, dreamed always frightful dreams, and
often started out of my sleep in the night: in the
{lay great troubles overwhelmed my mind; in the
night I dreamed often of killing the savages, and
the reasons why I might justify the doing of it
$ut to wave all this for a while, it was the middle
of May, on the sixteenth day, I think, as well as
my poor wooden calendar would reckon, for I
marked all upon the post still; 1 say, it was on the
sixteenth of May, that it blew a great storm of
wind all day, with a great deal of lightning and
thunder, and a very foul night was after it. I
know not what was the particular occasion of it:
but as I was reading in the bible, and taken up
with serious thoughts about my present condition,
1^ was surprised with the noise of a gun, as I
thought, fired at sea.
This was, to be sure, a surprise of a quite dif-
ferent nature from any I had met with before; foi
the notions this put into my thoughts were quite
of another kh)d. I started up in the greatest haste
imaginable; and in a trice clapped, up my ladder
tc^tfye middle place of the rockA and pulled it after
me, and mounting it the second^ t\mey got to the
tcftfof the hill;- that very moment a flash of lire
bade me Jisten for a second gun^ which accord-
ing in ^about^half a mpmenj; H^an^ a^d by the
S9un^^ewrjliatjt yas fi:bm that part 9ft(the .se^t
wherefI^was^riyen out? wkl^^tji^Gun;Qni ip'my

I immediately considered that this, mqsjt Jj.e some
ship in,distress,^and that'they 1?^ jj^e^iswle,

of some other ship in company, and1 fired these
guns for signals of distress, and to obtain help. I
had this presence of mind at that minute as to
think, that though I could not help them, it may-
be they might help me: so I brought together all
the dry wood I could get at hand, and making a
good handsome pile, I set it on fire upon the-hill:
the wood was dry, and blazed freely, and th&kgh
the wind blew very hard, yet it burnt fairly out,
so that I was certain, if there was any such thing
as a ship, they must needs see it, and no doubt they
did; for as goon as ever my fire blazed up, £ heard
indtlitfrgtm, and after that several others, &H ftehi
the samd quarter. I plied my fire all night long,
till day broke; and when it was-broad day; and
the air cl'ea'rfed tip, I savir something at a great dis-
tance at sea, full east of 1;he island; Whether k'sail
or an hull I could not distinguish, no, not wMh
my glares, the distance was so' great, and the lea-
ther still something hazy alsoj at least it #afe ko
out at sea.
I looked frequently at it alt that day,T arid-stoon
perceived that it did riot move;1' so I presently
concluded that'it was a! shij^at &icftor*; Stnd(beifog
eager, you ntey*be sttffej td be satisfied,u! td&k!«y

I was duff ifcmy bon^ and whrbh ^otik^ «r they
cocked theviolence of the stream, and made a
kind^pf counter-stream* or pddy, were the occa-
sion of my recovering then from- the most despe-
rate, hopeless condition, that ever I had been in
all my life.
Thus, what is one man's safety is another man's
4estraction; for it seems these men, whoever they
we*e,i being out of their knowledge, and the rocks
feeing wholly under water, had been driven upon
^he$i< in the night, the wipd blowing hard at E.
^a*|d B«N.E.. Had they seen the island, as I must
o&ecessarily suppose they did not, they must, as I
though t, have endeavoured to have saved them-
selves on shore by the help of their boat; but the
firing of their guns for help, especially wbep they
saw, as I imagined, my fire, filled me with many
thoughts: first, I imagined, that, upon seeing ray
^ight* they might have put themselves into their
boat, and have endeavoured to make the shore;
Iwt^hat the sea going very high,' they might have
been cast away: other times I imagined, that they
plight have lost their boat before, as might be the
;$asemany ways; as particularly, by the breaking
qf \h& sea upon thejr ship, which many times
.gbijggs men, to stave, or t^ke in*pieces their boat;
irawB$ #omeJ;ifipes to throw it pverboard with their
.m^n haijds; oth^ tym£& I imagined* they hid
^e othef ^ip or ^hjps in^cpmp^xy, who, upon
tfie Ijig^als of duress they^acL made, had taken
thepa Apy^d carrfgd them off/ otberwhiles I fan-
cied tj^yyer^v^ll gone^f^to se.a in their boat, and
being %riif 4i^JS*W ^J ^e »?HFePilt ^a* * ka4 ^een
formerly ^we^e^i^d out intp th# ^reat. ocean,
where there was nothing but misery and perishing;
and that perhaps they might by this time think of
starving, and of being in a condition to eat one
another.
As all these were but conjectures at best, so, in
the condition I was in, I could do no more than
look upon the misery of the poor men, and pity
them; which had still this good effect on my side,
that it gave me more and more cause to give thanks
to God, who had so happily and comfortably pro-
vided for me in my desolate condition; and that
of two ships companies, who were now cast away
upon this part of the world, not one life should
be spared but mine. I learned here again to ob-
serve, that it is very rare that the providence of
God casts us into any condition of life so low, or
any misery so great, but we may see something or
other to be thankful for, and may see others in
worsfc circumstances than our own.
Such certainly was the case of these men, of
whom I could not so much as see room to suppose
any of them were saved; nothing could make i£
rational, so much as to wish or expect that they
dfd not all perish there, except the possibility
only of their being taken up Jby another ship in
company: and this was but mere possibility in-
deed; fd»r I ^aw not the least signal or appearance
any saeli thing.
I^Carifrot 'expfelli, by &ny possijbip energy of
wo^cfs, wha^'sL Vr^iige longing, or h,ankfering of
desire, I felt in'jny soiif upjon tliis siWlit; breaking-
out sometimes' thus: O that tliere Y^cTb^en but
one or two, ^iay/But one soul saWcfoutof tfi& ship,
to have escaped to me, that I might but have had
one companion, one fellow-creature to have spoken
to me, and to have conversed with! In all the time
of my solitary life, I never felt so earnest, so strong
a desire after the society of my fellow-creatures,
or so deep a regret at the want of it.
There are some secret moving springs in the
affections, which, when they are set a going by
some object in view, or be it some object though
not in view, yet rendered present to the mind by
the power of imagination, that motion carries out
the soul by its impetuosity to such violent eager
embracings of the object, that the absence of it is
insupportable.
Such were these earnest wishings, That but one
man had been saved! O that it had been but one!
I believe I repeated the words, O that it had been
but one! a thousand times; and my desires were
so moved by it, that when I spoke the words, my
hands would clinch together, and my fingers press
tfce palms of my hands, that if I had had any soft
tlbing in my hand, it would have crushed it invo-
luntarily; and my teeth in vfiy head would strike
together, and set against one another so strong*
that for some time I could not part them again.
Let the naturalists explain the$e things, and the
reason an$ manner T>f them: all Icari $ay of them
is, to describe the fact, which wa§ ever surprising
to me^when 1 found it, though I knew pot from
what it snou|4 proc^dj it was^ doubtless t^ie effect
of ardent f\tfisli£s,' and of st^ng icleas fornxed in
my mind, ^luq9g the.qoipfort wljich ^b&£Qnver-
sation of one of my fellow-christians would have
been to me.
But it was not to be; either their fate, or mine,
or both, forbad it; for till the last year of my being
on this island, I never knew whether any were
saved out of that ship, or no; and had only the
affliction some days after to see the corpse of a
drowned bov come on shoie, at the end of the
island which was next the shipwreck: he had on
no clothes but & seaman's waistcoat, a pair of open
kneed linen drawers, and a blue linen shirt; but
nothing to direct me so much as to guess wh&t
nation he was of: he had ndthing in his pocket
but two pieces of eight, and a tobacco-*ptpe; the
last was to me of ten times more value than the
first.
It Was now calm, and I had a great mind * to
venture out in my boat to this wreck, n6t doubl-
ing but I might find something on board that
might be useful to me; but that did not altoge-
ther press me so much, as the possibility that there
might be yet some living creatureron board, who&e
life I might not only save, bfit might, by saving
that life, comfort mywrn to the last degree: and
this thought clung so to my heart, that I ttfwld
not be quiet niglit: nor 'day, buVPrimst vdntuV6
out tit my boat oh board this tvi^ck; ahd ttotffmffr
ting the rest to God's providettcte, I thought tfhe
impression wa's so -stforig- iipow tfty1 mintJj1 that'it
could nrot be refsisted, thtftitmust£<kne ffttfn^oftte
invisible direction, and that I sfaraiM be waiting
to myself if11 did «&t U&.* •. -'
Under the power of this impression, I hastened
back to my castle, prepared every thing for my
voyage, took a quantity of bread, a great pot for
fresbwater, a compass to steer by, a bottle of rum
(for I had still a great deal of that left,) a basket-
ful! of raisins: ^and thus loading myself with every
thing necessary, 1 went down to my boat, got the
water out of her, and got her afloat, loaded all my
cargo in her, and then went home again for more:
my second cargo was a great bag-full of rice, the
umbrella to set up over my head for shade, an-
other large pot-full of fresh water, and about two
dofcen of my small loaves, or barley cakes, more
than before, with a bottle of goat's milk, and a
cheese; all which, with great labour and sweat, I
brought to my boat; and praying to God to direct
my voyage, J put out, and rowing or paddling the
e^noe along the shore, I Game at last to the utmost
poifct of the island,, on that side, viz, N% E. And
now I was to launch out into the ocean, and either
to venture, or not to venture; I looked on the
rapid currents which ran constantly on both sides
of the island, at a distance, and which were very
terrible to me, from the remembrance of the hazard
Irjiad been in before, and my heart began to fail
?q£; Jor I foresaw* that if I w£s driven into either
g£ $©se current^ I sbou!4 be parried, a vast way
ou<t to sea, and .perhaps out of vmy reach or sight
of the isfoii4ag$in; and t&at,them, as my boat was
but small| illapry little^* o£ wind should rise, I
ihouldbe inevitably lost
These thoughts so oppressed my* mind, *hat I
began to give over my enterprise; and having
2 K
haled my boat into a little creek on the shore, I
stepped out, and sat me down upon a little spot of
rising ground, very pensive and anxious, between
fear and desire, about my voyage; when, as I was
musing, I could perceive that thg tide was turned,
and the flood came on, upon which my going was
for so many hours impracticable: upon this it pre-
sently occurred to me, that I should go up to the
highest piece of ground I could find, and observe,
if I could, how the sets of the tide or currents lay,
when the flood came in, that I might judge whe-
ther, if I Was driven one way.out, I might not
expect to be driven another way home, with the
same rapidness* of the currents. This thought was
no sooner in my head, but 1 cast my eyes upon 'a
little hill which sufficiently overlooked ikt sea both
Ways, and from whence I had a clear view of the
currents, or sets of the tide, and which way I was
to guide myself in my return: here I found, that as
the current of the ebb set out close by the south
point of the island, so the current of the flood ^set
in Close by the shore of the north-side; and thatl
had nothing to do but to keep to the north of the
island in ,my return, and L'shouM- do well enough.
Encouraged with this observation, I r$s#lvfed
the next morning 'to ^et out With ^e first of thte
tide; and rfeposing myself5Jfor that night-in the
canoe, tinder the* great watch-coat I'mentioned, I
launched out* I ftikde firata litMe out to* sea, full
north, 'till I bfeg&n to ftfel the betiejfit of the cur-

a great rate, 'and' yet did not so Uuhy me as the
$outh£rri-skte current had done fte$&^ and so as
to take from me all government of the boat; but
having a strong steerage with my paddle, I went,
I say, at a great rate, directly for the wreck, and
in less than two hours I came up to it.
It was a dismal sight to look at: the ship, which
by its building was Spanish, stuck fast, jambed in
between two rocks; all the stern and quarter of her
was beaten to pieces with the sea; and as her fore-
castle, which stuck in the rocks, had run on with
great violence, her main-mast and fore-mast were
brought by the board, that is to say, broken short
off, bat her bowsprit was sound, and the head and
|)ow appeared firm. When I came close to her, a
dog appeared upon her, which, seeing me coming,
yelped and cried, and as soon as I called him,
jumped mto the sea to Gome to me; and I took
him*into the boat, but found him almost .dead for
hungernaad thirst I gave him a cake of my biiead,
and he ate like a ravenous wolf that had beea
starving a fortnight in the snow. I then gave
the poor creature some fresh water, with which, if
I would have let him, he would have burst him-
self.
After this I weat on board; the first sight I met

had life, nor any goods that I could see* but what
were spoiled by the w&ter: there were* some casks
of liquor, whether wine or brandy I knew not,
which lay lower in the hold, and which, the w^ter
being ebbed out, I could see; but they were too
big to meddle with, I saw several chests, which
I believed belonged to some of the seamen, and J
got two of them into the boat without examining
what was in them.
Had the stern of the ship been fixed, and the
fore-part broken off, I am persuaded I might have
made a good voyage; for by what I found in these
two chests, I had room to suppose the ship had ja
great deal of wealth on board; and if* I may g^eis
by the bourse she steered, she mmt have been
bound1 from the Buenos Ayres, or the Rio de la
Pfotk, in the south part of America, beyond the
Brasils, to the Havanna, in the gulph of Mexico,
and so perhaps to Spain. She had, no doubt, q,
'great treasure in her, but of no use at that time to
any body; and what became of the re$t of her
people I then knew not.
I found besides these chests, a little cask fulliof
liquor, of aboiit twenty gallon which I got into

weary and fatigued to. the last degree*

i&g I resolved to harbour what I had gotten in

After refreshing myself, I got all my cargo on
shore* and began to examine the particulars: the
cask of liquor I found to be a kind of rum, but not
sucbhas we had at the Brasils; and, in a word, not
at ail good; but when I came to open the chests,
I4bund several things which I wanted: for exam-
ple I found in one a fine case of bottles, of an ex-
iteawdinaryt kind, and filled with^ cordial waters,
fine; and very good; the battles held ahoutrthree

the water had spoiled. I found some very good
shirts, which were very welcome to me, and about
a dozen and a half of white linea handkerchiefs,

iwyt welcome, being exceeding refreshing to wipe

but oitJiifcte valuer but J*$t&fc ^u^ri^es, it
must have belonged to the gunner's mate, as there
was no powder in it, but about two pounds of
glazed powder in the three flasks, kept, I suppose,
for charging their fowling-pieces on occasion.
Upon the whole, I got very little by this voyage
that was of much use to me; for as to the money,
1 had no manner of occasion for it; it was to me
as the dirt under my feet; and I would have given
it for three or four more pair of English shoes and
stockings, which were things I grektly wanted,
but had not had on my feet now far many years.
I had, indeed, got two pair of shoes now, which I
took off the feet of the two drowned men whota
I saw in the wreck; and I found two pair more in
one of the chests, which were very welcome to
me; but they were not like our English5shoes; ei-
ther for ease or service, beitog rather what we call
pumps than shoes. I found in the seathan's chest
about fifty pieces of eight in royals, but no'gdld;
I suppose this belonged to a poorer *mani than the
other, which seemed to belong* to somte officer. * 1
Well, however, I lugged the money home to my
oave, and laid it up, as'I had done that before
which I brought*from our own ship; but it was
gre&t pity, #s I said, that the other part of the ship
h£d not come to my share, for I am satisfied I
might have loaded my canoe several times over
with'ftidtweyy whicfy if I had*everesd&ped to En-
gMitlV' would-have Iain* here^safe enough till I
might havd'come-again and fdtqhed it. - >
Having now brought all my things on shore/ and
secured them, i webt b&ck'to irty boat, and*rbived
or paddled taer alofrg the shor^to tei^&Wlh^btfur,
wherfe Inlaid her up5 and made the best of my way
tq^fmy old habitation, where I found every thing
safe and quiet; so I began to repose myself, live
aj|£r my old fashion, and take care of my family
affairs; and for a while I lived easy enough, only
that I was more vigilant than I used to be, looked
out oftener, and did not go abroad so much; and
if #t aqy Jtime I did stir with any freedom, it was
always to the east part of the island, where I was
pretty well satisfied the savages never came, and
wl^ere* I could go without so many precautions,
a^puch a load of arms and ammunition, as I al~
way^.c&rried with me, if I went the other way.
I lived in this, condition near two years more;
but my milucky head, that was always to let me
kqow it was bora to make my body miserable, was
all t^iese tjwo years filled with projects and designs,
how, if it were possible, I might get away from
this island; for sometimes I was for making ano-
ther voyage to the wreck, though my reason told
me? tjhat there was nothing left there worth the
hazard of my voyage: sometimes for a ramble one
Wfiy, sometimes another; and I believe verily, if ^
had the boat that I went from Sallee in, I should
h$iy? ventured to .sea, bound any where, I knew
np$ whiter. .

primitive condition, and the excellent advice of my
father, the opposition to which was, as I may call
it, my original sin, my subsequent mistakes of the
same kind have been the means of my coming into
this miserable condition; for had that Providence,
which so happily had seated me at the Brasils as a
planter, blessed me with confined desires, and
could I have been contented to have gone on gra-
dually, I might have been by this time, I mean
in the time of my being on this island, one of the
most considerable planters in the Brasils; nay, I
am persuaded, that by the improvement I had
made in that little time I lived there, and the in-
crease I should probably have made if I had staid,
I might have been worth an hundred thousand
moidofes; and what business had I to leave a set-
tled fortune, well-stocked plantation, improving
and increasing, to turn super-cargo to Guinea, to
feteh Negroes, when patience and time would so
have increased our stock at home, that we could
have bought them at out own doors, from those
whose business it was to fetch them? And thougfe
it had cost us something more, yet the different^
Of that price was by no means worth saving at s6
great a hazard.
But as this is ordinarily the fate of young heads*,
so reflection upon the folly of it is as oj4inarily the
exercise of more years, or of the dear-bought ex-
perience of time; and so it was with me now; and
yfet, so deep had the mistake taken root in my
tempfer, that I could not satisfy myself in my sta-
tion, but was continually poring upon the mea&s
and possibility of my escape from this pla®e: and
that I m&y, with the gteater pleastt*rfc to the
reader, bring oU'the remaining part of' my story, it
may not be improper to give some account of my
first conceptions* on the subject of this foolish
scheme for my fescape-; and how and upon what
foundation, I acted^
I am now to be supposed to be retired into my
castle, after my late voyage to the wreck, my fri-
gate laid up, and secured under water as usual, and
mf <K>ndition restored to what it was before. I
had more wealth, indeed, than I had before, but
was not at all the richer; for I had no more use
for it than the Indians of Peru had before the Spa-
niards came thither.
It was one of the nights, in the rainy season in
Match, the fo&r-and-twentieth year of my first
setting foot in this island of solitariness, I was ly-
ing in my bed or hamatock, awake, and very well
in health, had no pain, no distemper, no uneasiness
of bbdy, no, nor any uneasiness of mind more than
ordinary, but could by no means close my eyes,
that is, so as to steep; no, not a wink all night
long; otherwise thaai as follows^
It k as impossible as needless, to set down the
innumerable crowd of thoughts that whirled
through that great thoroughfare of the brain, the
memory, m this night's time. I ran over the
whofe history of >my life im miniature/or by afrridg-

of these thoughts, I say, so much as came in fiiy

netiofcof my passing over in my boat to the main

the most miserable that could -possibly be; tha/t I
was not able to throw myself into any thing but

When lhis^fca(!:agi^t^d pn$ thoughts for two
hours* or? toiore, with such violence that it set fny
very Mood into a ferment, and my pulse beat as
high as if I had been in a fever, merely with the
extraordinary fervour of my mind about it; na-
ture, as if I had been fatigued and exhausted with
the .very thought of it, threw me infco a sound
sleep: one would have thought I should have
dreamed of it; btit I did not, nor of any thiftg re-
lating to it; hut Lidveaifted that as I was going
out in the morning, as usual, from my castle, I saw
upon the shore ~W& fcanoes, and eleven satfages
eamihgtoiand," and • that * they brought with them
anothensaVage^ whottrfcbdyjwere going to kill, in
order toieat him; ^trliefi, on a sadden, the savage
that they were going' to kill, jumped away, and
ran* for'his life: then I thotight in my sleep, that
hte-damejrraming into my little thiak grove, before
my fortification to hide himself ;> and that I seeing
him alone, i and not fxetfceiving that the others
$<aught him that way, shewed^ myseif to faimy and
smiling upon him, en©era«aged him, that he kneeled
down to me, seeming to .pray me to* assist him;
upon whieh I shewed* lrny ladder, made him go up
4k^ and carried him into my ca^e, and he became
myTservant; audi.that &s ^odn ris I had got this

whither 4^ go for provisions, and whither not to
gTO-forfeaa-irf befagxdvrauted; whatplactes to ven-
ture into, ^nd what to escape. I waked with tMs
thought, andiwsasTimdei'setth inexpressible impres-
sions )6f joyjab!thpi/pi®s{«dct -of^y~e#caf>i&*in my
dream, that the disappointments which I felt upon
coming to myself, and finding it was no more than
a dream, were equally extravagant the other way,
and threw me into a very great dejection of spirit.
Upon this, however, I made this conclusion,
that my only way to go about an attempt for an
escape, was, if possible, to get a savage in my pos-
session; and, if possible, it should be one of their
prisoners whom they had condemned to be eaten,
and should bring hither to kill; but these thoughts
still were attended with this difficulty, that it was
impossible to effect this, withofatlttkcking* a whole
caravan of them, and killing^ Wem all; and this
was not only a very desperate attempt, and might
miscarry; but, on th6 other hand, I had greatly
scrupled the lawfulness of it to me, and my heart
trembled at the thoughts of shedding so much
blood, though it was for my deliverance. I need
not repeat the arguments which occurred to me
against this, they behig the'same mentioned before:
but though I had other reasons to offer now, viz.
that those men were enemies to my life, and would
devour me, if they could; that it was self-preser-
vation, in the highest degree, to deliver myself
from this death of life, and was acting in my own
defence, as much as<if they \^ere actually assault-
ing me, and the like; I say, though these things
argued for it, yet the thoughts bf shedding human
blood for my deliverance were very terrible to me,
and such as I could by no m£ans .reconcile myself
to a great whilQ.
However, at last, after many' secret disputes
\frith myself, and after great perplexities about it
(fot all these arguments, one way and another,
struggled in my head a long time,) the eager pre-
vailing desire of deliverance at length masteied
all the rest, and I resolved, if possible, to get one
of these savages into my hands, cost what it would:
the next thing then was to contrive how to do it;
and this indeed was very difficult to resolve on:
but as I amid pitch upon no probable means for
it, so I resolved to put myself upon the watch to
see them when £hey came on shore, and leave the
rest to the event, taking such measures as the op-
portunity should present, let it be what it would,
"With these resolutions in my thoughts, I set
myself jupon the scout as often as possible, and
indeed so often, till I was heartily tired of it; for
it was above a yeatr an$ an half that I waited, and
for a great part of that time went out to the west
end, and to the south-west coiner of the island,
almost every clay, to{see tjie canoes, but none ap-
peared; this was very discouraging, and began to
trouble me much; though I cannot say that it did
in, this case, as it had done some time before that,
viz. 'wear off the edge of my desire to the thing;
hut the longer it seemed to be delayed, the more
eager I was for it: in a word, I was not at first
more careful to shun the sight of these savages,
and avoid being seen by them, than I was now
eacger to be upon them.
Besides^ I fancied myself able to manage one,
nay, two of three savages, if I had them, so as to
make them entirely slaves to me, to do whatever
I should direct them, and to prevent their being
able, at any time, to do me any hurt It was a
great while that I pleased myself with this af&k,
but nothing still presented; all my fancies and
$cheijt§s came to, nothings for no savages came
uear me for a great while*
About a year and an half after I had entertained
these notions, and, by long musing, had, as it were,
resolved them all into nothingv for want of an
occasion to put them in execution, I was surprised
one morning early, with seeing no less than five
canoes all on shore together, on my side the island,
and the people, who belonged to them all landed*
an,d out of my sight: the number of them.brok^
all my measures; for seeing so many, and knowing
that they always came four, or six, or sometimes
more, in a boat, I could not, tell what to think^f
it, or how to take my measures to attack twenty
or thirty men single-handed; so I lay still in my
castle, perplexed and ,discomforted: however, I
put myself into all the same pastures for an attack
that I had formerly provided, and was juat read$
for action, if any thing had presented. Haying
Waited a good while, listening to hear if ,theymad&
any noise; at length being very impatient, I set
my gun$ at the foot of my ladder^ and clambered
up to the, top of the hill by my two stages, ,as
U£ual; standing so, however, that my .head did next
appear above the hill, so that they could not per-
ceive me by any means: here I observed, by the
help of my perspective glass, that they were no
less than thirty in number; that they had a fire
kindled, and th^t they had meat dressed; how
they rcqok?d it, that I kn^w npt* or what it v/as^
but they were all darning in I know not Jhoto
many barbarous gestures and figures, their own
way, round the fire.
When I was thus looking on them, I perceived
by my perspective two miserable wretches dragged
from the boats, where, it seems, they were laid
by, and were now brought out for the slaughter.
I perceived one of them immediately fail, being
knocked down, I suppose, with a club or wooden
sword, for that was their way; and two or three
others were at work immediately, cutting him
open for their cookery, while the other victim was
left standing by himself, till they should be ready
&r him: in that very moment this poor wretch,
seeing himself a little at liberty, nature inspired
him with hopes of life, and he started away from
them, and ran with incredible swiftness along the
s&iids, directly towards me, I mean, towards that
part of the coast where my habitation was.
I Was dreadfully frighted (that I must acknow-
ledge) when I perceived him to run my way; and es-
pecially when, as I thought, I saw him pursued by
the whole body; and now I expected that part of
my dream was coming to pass, and that he would
certainly take shelter in my grove; but I could
not depend, by any means, upon my dream for
the rest of it, viz. that the other savages would
not pursue him thither, and find him there. How-
ever, I kept my station, and my spirits began to
recover, when I found that there were not above
three men that followed him; and still more was
I encouraged, when I found he outstrip! them ex-
ceedingly in running, and gained ground of them,
2 M
so that if he could but hold it for half an hour, I
saw easily he would fairly get away from them all.
There was between them and my castle the
creek, which I mentioned often at the first part of
my story, when I landed my cargoes out of the
ship; and this I knew, he must necessarily swim
over, or the poor wretch would be taken there:
but when the savage escaping came thither, he
made nothing of it, though the tide was then up;
but plunging in, swam through in about thirty
strokes, or thereabouts, landed, and ran on with
exceeding strength and swiftness. When the three
pursuers came to the creek, I found that two of
them could swim, but the third could not, and
that he, standing on the other side, looked at the
other, but went no farther; and soon after went
softly back again, which, as it happened, was very
well for him in the main.
I observed, that the two who swam were yet
more than twice as long swimming over the creek
than the fellow was that fled from them. It came
now very warmly upon my thoughts, and indeed
irresistibly, that now was my time to get a ser-
vant, and perhaps a companion, or assistant, and
that I was called plainly by Providence to save this
poor creature's life. I immediately got down the
ladders with all possible expedition, fetched my
two guns, for they were both at the foot of the
ladder> as I observed above; and getting up again
with the same haste to the top of the hill, I crossed
towards the sea; and having a very short cut, and
all down hill, clapped myself in the way between
the pui&uers and the pursued, hallooing aloud to
him tfe.fled, who, looking back, was at first per-
haps as much fngbted at me as I at them; but I
beckoned with my haiid to him to come back $ and
in the mean time, I slowly advanced towards the
two that followed; then rushing at once upon the
foremost, J knocked him down with the stock of
my piece; I was loth to fire, because I would not
have tfee rest hear, though at that distance it
would not have been easily heard; and being out
of sight of the smoke too, they would not have
easily known what to make of it Having knocked
this fellow down, the other who pursued him
stopped, as if he had been frightened, and I ad-
vanced apace towards him; but as I came nearer,
I perceived presently he had a bow and arrow,
and was fitting it-to shoot at me; so I was then
necessitated to shoot at him first; which I did, and
killed him at the first shot. The poor savage who
fled, but had stopped, though he saw both his
enemies fallen, and killed (as he thought) yet was
so frighted with the fire and noise of my piece,
that he stood stock-still, and neither came forward
nor went backward, though he seemed rather in-
clined to fly still, than to come on. I hallooed
again to him, and made signs to come forward,
which he easily understood, and came a little way,
then stopped again, and then a little farther, and
stopped again; and I could then perceive that he
stood trembling, as if he had been taken prisoner,
and had just been to be killed, as his two enemies
were. I beckoned him again to come to me, and
gave him all the signs of encouragement that I
S MS
could think of; and he came nearer and nearer,
kneeling down every ten or twelve steps, in token
of acknowledgment for saving his life. I smiled
at him and looked pleasantly, and beckoned to
him to come still nearer. At length he came close
to me, and he then kneeled down again, kissed
the ground, and laid his head upon the ground, and
taking me by the foot, set my foot upon his head.
This, it seems, was in token of swearihg to be my
slave for ever. I took him up, and made^tnuch of
him, and encouraged him all I could. But there
was more woik to do yet; for I pfcfaeiVGd the sa-
vage, whom I knocked down, was not killed, but
stunned with the blow, and began to^come to him-
self: so I pointed to him, and shewed him the sa-
vage, that he was not dead: upon this he spoke
some words to me; and though I could not under-
stand them, yet I thought they were pleasant to
hear, for they were the first sound of a man's
voice, that'I had heard, iriy own excepted, for
above five-and-twenty years. But there was no
time for such reflections now: the savage, who
Was knocked down, recovered himself so far as
to sit up upon the ground; and I perceived that
my savage began to be afraid; but when haw
that, I presented my other piece at the man, as if I
would shoot him: upon this my savage, for so I
tall him now, made a motion to me to lend him
my sword, which hung naked in a belt by iny
side; so I did: he no sooner had it, but he runs
to his enemy, and at one blow cut oif his head so
cleverly, iio £x^cutioher 11*1 Germany could have
done it sooner or better; ^hMi I thou^M it very
strange for one, who, I had reason to believe, never
saw a swor4 in his life before, except their own
wooden swords. However it seems, as I learned
afterwards, they make their woodexi swords so
^harp, so heavy, and the wood is so hard, that
they will cut off heads even with them, nay, and
arms, and that at one blow too. When he h*id
done this, he comes laughing to me iu sign of
-triumph, and brought me the sword again, and,
with abundance,of gestures, which I did not un-
derstand, laid it down, with the head of the sa-
.vage that he had killed, just before me.
> Butjthat which astonished him most was, to
know how I had killed the other Indian so far off;
so pointing to him, he made signs to me to let
him go tQ hifBa; so I bade him go, as well as I
could. When he came to him, he stood like
one amazed, looking at him; turned him first on
one side, then on the other; looked at the wound
the bullet had made, which it seems was just in
rjiis breast, where it had made an hole, and no
.great quantity of blood had followed; but Ije had
cbled inwardly, for lie was quite dead: then he, took
^ijp Jhis bow and arrowy and came back; so I
itiiijned to go away, and beckoned him to follow
Ui% making signs to him that more might come
$£ter them. i
i i Upon this he signed to mey that he should bury
thefti with sapd* $hat they might not be jseen by
the re$t* ifi they followed j and so I made signs
again tQ hapx to do &©: he fell to wqrk^andjn an
instant he ^4 fsg?a#ed,4J^ hqte in >the ^Sftd ^ith
his hand% big ®n>wgh to-b\iry tjicfixstm, and
then dragged him into it/ and covered him, and
did so also by the other. I believe he had buried
them both in a quarter of an hour: then calling
him away, I carried him not to my castle, but
quite away to my cave, on the farther part of thfc
island; so I did not let my dream come to pass in
that part; viz. that he came into my grove for
shelter.
Here I gave him bread, and a bunch of raisins
to eat, and a draught of water, which I found he
was indeed in great distress for, by his running;
and having refreshed him, I made? signs for hifn
to go lie down and sleep, pointing to a place
where I had laid a great parcel of rice-straw, and
a blanket upon it, which I used to sleep upon my-
self sometimes: so the poor creature lay down,
and went to sleep.
He was a comely halidsome fellow, perfectly
well made, with straight long limbs, not tod
large, tall, and well-shaped, and, as I reckon,
about twenty-six years of age. He had a very
good countenance, not a fierce and surly aspect,
but seemed to have something very manly in his
face, and yet he had all the sweetness and softness
of an European in his cduntenance too, especially
when he smited: his hair was long and black, Hot
curled like wool; his forehead very high and forge,
and a great vivacity 'and sparkling sharpness in
his eyes. The colour of his skin was not quite
hkck, but very tawny, and yet not bf an ugly
yellow nauseous tawny, as thfe Br&siliaiis and Vir-
ginians, and other natives of Atitffcrtea are; but of
a bright kind of a dun olive colour, that had in it
sojpe$nag very agreeable, though not very easy
to describe^ His face was round* and plumpy bis
nose small, not flat like the negroes, a very good
month, thin lips, and his teeth fine, well-set, and
white as ivory. After he had slumbered, rather
than slept, about half an hour, he waked again,
and comes out of the cave to me, for I had been
milking my goats, which I had in the enclosure
just by. When, he espied me, he came running to
me,, laying himself down again upon the ground,
with all the possible signs of an humble thankful
disposition making many aiitic gestures to shew
it. i At last he lays his head flat upon the ground,
close to i?iy foor, and sets my other foot upon his
head, as he had done before; and after this,, made
aJJLthe signs tq o\e of subjection, servitude, and
submission imaginable, to let me know how much
he* would serve me as long as he lived. 1 under-
stood him m many things, and let him know I was
very well pleased with him. In a little time I
bsgan to speak to him, and teach him to speak to
n^e; and firat^ I made, hi*n know his name shbuld
b£ Friday,, whiGh was the day I saved his life; and
tjcalled him so for the memory of the time. I
likewise taught him to say Master, and then let
him know that .was to be* my name; I likewise
taught him* to say Ye^ a&d No, and to know the
mea^ing.of jthem. Igaise him some milk in an
ear£hen,pot* an4* let him see me drink it before
him,, sop my bi^ead in ttj ^nd. I gave him a eakfe
of bread* to, d«> the* like, which he quickly com-
plied with,s a&dimade aigns that it was very good
far hinur
I kept there with him all that night; but as sdon
as it was day, I beckoned him to come with me,
and let him know I would give him some clothes;
at which he seemed very glad, for he was stark-
naked. As we went by the place where he bad
buried the two men, he pointed exactly to the
spot, and shewed me the marks that he had made
to find them again, making signs to me that we
should dig them up again, and eat them. At this I
appeared very angry, expressed my abhorrence of
it, made as if I would vomit at the thoughts of it,
and beckoned with my hand to him to come away,
which he did immediately, with great submission,
I then led him up to the top of the hill, to see if
his enemies were gone, and pulling out my glass, I
looked, and saw plainly the place where they had
been, but no appearance of them, or of their ca-
noes; so that it was plain that they were gone,
and had left their two comrades behind them,
without any search after them.
But I was not content with this discovery; but
having now more courage, and consequently mc^e
curiosity, I took my man Friday with me, giving
him the sword in his hand, with the bow and ar-
rows at his back, which I found he could use very
dexterously, making him Garry one *gim for me,
and I two for myself, and away we marched to the
place where these creatures had been; for I had a
mind now to get some fuller intelligence of them.
When I came to the place, my*very blood ran chill
in my veins, and my heart sunk Within me at the
horror of the spectacle; indeed it was a dreadful
sight, at least it was so to me, though Friday made
or w&mm&N ouusoe. 273
nOthifig'&f it. The place was cohered with human
bo#es, the ground dyed with the blood, gseat pieces
of ^flesh left here and -there half-eaten, mangled,
auld scorched; and, in short, all the tokens of the
triumphant feast they had been making there, after
# victory over their enemies. I saw three skulls,
five hands, and the bones of three or four legs and
feet, and abundance of other parts of the bodies;
dn4 Friday, by his signs, made me understand that
they brought over four prisoners to feast upon;
that three of them were eaten upT and that he,
pointing to hftnself, was the fourth: that there had
b^en a great battle between them and their next
king/whose subjects, it seems, he had been one of;
and that they had taken a great number of pri-
soners, all which were carried to several places by
t&Osa that had* taken'them in the flight, in order to
feast uproti them, a3 was done hene by these
w^ehes* upoi those they brought hither.
I caused Friday to gather all the skulls, bones,
fl$$fe, atod whatever remariried, and lay them toge-
ther on airtheap, and make a great fire upon ify
^rd burn them alt to ashes. I found Friday had
stiM an hankering stomach after some of the fleshy
afyftfe wa& still a cannibal in his nature; but I disco*
vMQd $0 muoh abhorrence at the very thoughts of
if^&nd at*tljr@iteast appe&raa&ce of'it, that he durst
ifbi>dls<k>vei* it^*brlMad,Tby some means, let him
Ism^ikat^rmnUi kilHnn if he offered it.
Wtm*lte^adfdone this, *we came back to out*

chest I mentioned, and which I found in the
wreck; and which, with a little'alteration, fitted
him very well: then I made him a jerkin of goat's*
skin as well as my skill would allow, and I was
now grown a tolerably good tailor: and I gave him
a cap, which I had made of an hare-skin, very con-
venient, and fashionable enough: and thus he was
dressed, for the present, tolerably well, and mighty
well was he pleased to see himself almost as well
clothed as his master: it is true, he went awk-
wardly in these things at first; wearing the
drawers was very awkward to him, &nd the sleeves
of the waistcoat galled his shoulders and the in-
side of his artns; but a little easing them, where
he complained they hurt himj and using himself to
them, at length he took to them very well.
The next day aftfer I came home td my hutch
with him, I began to consider where I should
lodge him; and that I might do well for him, and
yet be perfectly fea'sy myself, I made a little tent
for him in the vacant £laee between my two forti-
fications, in the inside of the last, and in the out-
side of the first: and as there was a door or en-
trance^there into my cavfe, I made a formal framed
door-case, and a door t6 it of boards, and set it up
in the passage, a little withiu the entrance; and
causing the dooi? to open on the inside, I barred it
up in the night, taking in my ladders too? so that
Friday could no way contfe at me in the inside of
my innermost wall, without makiftg so much noise
in getting over, that it must needs awaken me;
for vky first ^all had now dComplete roof oVer it of
bug poles, covering all ftiy**tfent, and leaning up to
the side of the bill, which was again laid cross
with small sticks, instead fof laths, and then
thatched over a great thickness with the rice-
s£raw, which was strong like reeds; and at the
bole or place which was left to go in or .out by the
ladder, I had placed a kind of trap-door, which if
it had been attempted on the outside, would not
haye opened at all, but would have fallen down,
and piade a great noise; and as to weapons, I toojc
them all into my side every night.
But I needed Jione of all this precaution; for
never man h«id a more faithful, loving, sincere ser-
vant than,Friday was to me; without passions, sul-
lenness, or designs; perfectly obliging and engag-
ing; his very affections were tied to me, like those
of a child to a father; and I dare say, he wonld
have sacrificed his life for the saving mine, upon
any occasion whatsoever: the many testimonies
he gave meof this, put it out of doubt; and soon
convinced me, that I needed to use no precautions
as to my safety on his account
t This, frequently gave me occasion to observe,
and that with wonder, that, however, it had pleased
God in his providence* and in the government of
the works of his hands, to take from so great *a
paxt of the worldy of his creatures, the best uses to
which their faculties and the powers'of their souls
are adapted; yet that he ha& bestowed upon them
th& ^me powers, the same reasqn, the same affec-
tions, the same sentiments of kindness and obliga-
tion, the same passions and resentments of wrongs,
the same $ense>of ^gratitude, sincerity, fidelity, and
all the capacities of tfoing good, and receiving good,
2n2
that he has given to us; and that when he pleased
to offer them occasions of exerting these, they are
as ready, nay, more ready to apply them to1 the
right uses for which they were bestowed, than we
are. And this made me very melancholy^some*
times, in reflecting, as the several occasions pre*
sen ted, how mean a use we make of all these, even
though we have these powers enlightened by the
great lamp of instruction, the Spirit of God, and
by the knowledge of his word>, added itx»our niv
derstanding; and why it has pleased Go© to bide
the like saving knowledge from so many millions
of souls, who if one might judgeby this poor sal-
vage, would make a much better uTse of it than
we did.
From hence I sometimes was Jed tooifatf to in-
vade the sovereignty of Providence; and, as it
were, arraign the justice of so arbitrary a dispotfi*
tion of things, that should hide that light from
some, and reveal it toothers, and yet expect a like
duty from both: but I shut it up, and checkedjmy
thoughts with this conclusion* First, that we do
not know by what light and kw these should be
condemned; but that as God was necessarily, and
by the nature of his being, infinitely holy dnd just,
so it could not be, but that if these creatures were
all sentenced to absence from himself, it was on
account of sinning against that light, which/ as
the scripture says, was .a law to themselves, and
by such rules as their consciences would acknow*
tadigei to be just, though the foundation was &ot
discovered *q <us: aiatd, secondly,* that stilly as we
are all clay in, the frand of the > potter, no vessel
could say to him, why hast thou formed me
thus?
4 ii But to return to my new companion. I was
greatly delighted with him, and made it my busi-
ness to teach him every thing that was proper to
make him useful, handy, and helpful; but espe-
cially to make him speak, and understand me
when I spake; and he was the aptest scholar that
ever was; and particularly was so merry, so con-
st&ntly diligent,, and so pleased when he could but
understand me, or make me understand him, that
it was very pleasant to me to talk to him. And
bow my life began to be so easy, that I began to
say to myelf, that could I but have been safe from
more savages, I cared not if I was never to remove
from the place while I lived.
After I had been two or three days returned to
my castle, I thought that, in order to bring Friday
off from his horrid way of feeding, and from the
relish of a cannibal's stomach, I ought to let him
taste other flesh; so I took him out with me one
morning to the woods. I went, indeed, intending
to kill a kid out of my own flock, and bring it
home and dress it: but as I was going, I saw a
she-goat lying down in the shade, and two young
kids sitting by her. I catched hold of Friday,
Hold, said I, stand still; and made signs to him
not to stir; immediately I presented my piece*
sb&t and killed one of the kids. The poor crea-
ture, who had, at a distance indeed, seen me kill
the savage his enemy, but did not know or could
imagine how it was done, was sensibly surprised^
trembled and shook, and looked so amazed, that
I thought he*would have sunk down; he did not
see the kid I had shot at, or perceive I had killed
it, but ripped up his waistcoat to feel if he was
not wounded; and, as I found, presently thought
I was resolved to kill him; for he came and
kneeled down to me, and, embracing my knees,
said a great many things I did not understand;
but I could easily see that his meaning was to
pray me not to kill him. >
I soon found a way to convince him, that I
would do him no harm; and taking him up by £h$
hand, laughed at him, and pointing to the kid
which I had killed, beckoned ta him to run and
fetch it, which he did; and while he was wander-
ing and looking to see how the creature was killed,
I loaded my gun again, and by and> by I saw a
great fowl, like an hawk, sit upon a tree within
shot: so, to let Friday understand a little what I
would do, I * called him to me again, pointing at
the fowl, which was indeed a parrot, though I
thought it had been an hawk; I say, pointing to
the parrot, and to my gun, and to the ground under
the parrot, to let him see I would make him faH>
I made him understand that I would shoot and
kill that bird; accordingly I fired, and bid him
look* and immediately he saw the parrot fall. He
stood like one frighted again, notwithstanding ail
that I had said to him; and I found he was the
more amazed, because he did not see me put any
thing into the gun; but thought there must be
some wonderful fund of deathfand destruction in
that thing, able to kill man, beast, bird, or any
thing*nea? or far off: for the astonishment this
created in him was such, as could not wear off for
along time; and I believe, if I would have let him,
he would have worshipped me and my gun: as for
the gun itself, he would not so much as touch it
for several days after; but would speak to it, and
talk to it, as if it had answered him, when he was
by himself; which, as I afterwards learned of him,
was to desire it not to kill him.
Well: after his astonishment was a little over at
this, I pointed to him to run and fetch the bird I
had shot, which he did, but staid some time; for
the parrot, ridfe being quite dead, had fluttered a
good way off from the place where she fell; how-
ever he found'her, took her up, and brought her
to me; and, asl had perceived his ignorance about
the gun before, I took this advantage to charge
the gun again, and not let him see me do it, that
I might be ready for any other mark that might
present; but nothing more offered at that time:
so I brought home the kid; and the same evening I
took the skin off, and cut it out as well as I could;
and having a pot for that purpose, I boiled or
stewed some of the flesh, and made some very
good broth. After I had began to eat some, I gave
some to my man, who seemed very glad of it, and
liked it very well; but that which was strangest
io~him, vtras/to see me eat^alt with it. r He made
a sign t6 me that the salt was not good to eat; and
putting a little into his own mouth, he seemed to
nauseate it, and would spit and sputter at it, wash-
ing his *raouth With* freshwater after it; on the
Other hand, I took 'koine meat in my tooutk with*
out salt, and I pretended to^pit and sputter for
want of salt, as fast as he had done at the salt;
but It would not do, he would never care for salt
with meat, or in his broth; at least, not a great
while, and then but a very little.
Having thus fed him with boiled mfeai and
broth, I was resolved to feast him the next day
with roasting a piece of the kid: this I did by
hanging it before the fire in a string, as I had sqen
many people do in England, setting twp<potes up,
one on each side the fire, and one across on the
top, and tying the string to the cross stick, letting
the meat turn continually; this Friday adniirtid
very much; but when he-came to taste the flesh,
he took so many ways to tell me how well he liked
it, that I could not but understand him; and at last
he told me he would never eat mat's flesh any
more, which I was very glad to hear*'
The next day I set him to work to beating some
corn out, and sifting it in the manner I used to do,
as I observed before; and he soon understood how
to do it as well as I, especially after he bad see**,
what the meaning of it was, and that it was to<
make bread of; for after that I let him see me
make my bread, and bake it too; and in a little
time Friday was able to do all the work for me, vas
well as I could do it myself*
I began now to consider, that having two
mouths to feed instead of one, Iimust provide more
ground for my harvest, and plaitt a larger quantity
of corn than I used to do; so I marked out a lar-
ger piece of land, and began the fence in the samfe-
manner as before, in which Friday not only worked*
very willingly, and very hard, but did it very
6F lffi#(KZQX etfuseffc. 281
cheerfully; and I told him whai it was for, fhatfit
was for corn to make more breiB, b£caiise he was
now with mfe, and that I ftii^hft have enough fx>r Inm
and myself too: he appeared Very7 Visible of that
part, and let me know, thai he thought I Had much
m#re labour* iipbtt mfe on his account, than I had
for myself> and thit life wdufdiVork the harder for
m^ if I wbttld Ml him \Vhkt to do.
»Thi»-tfas the plea^antestjrgai' of all the life I led
in this place. Friday began to talk p'retty well,

Friday. Yes, I l?^eR herp [points to the N. W+
side of the island^ j&hi£h> if seems, was their
side,] t > , >>
By^this I understood, that my n>an Friday had
fp?{^^3ri,been among the sav^s^ who used to
com^iop shore, on the farther pajt of the island,
on the said u^n-eating occasions that he was now
brought for; and some time after, when I took
the courage to carry him to that side, being the
same I formerly mentioned, he presently knew
the place, and told me, he was there once when
they eat up twenty men, two women, and one
child: he could not tell twenty m English, but he
numbered them by laying so many stones in a row,
and pointed to me to tell them over.
I have told this passage, because it introduces
what follows;—that after I had had this discourse
with him, I asked him, How far it was from our
island to the shore, and whether the canoes were
not often lost? He told me there was no danger,
no canoes ever lost; but that after a little way
out to sea, there was a current, and a wind always
one way in the morning, the other in the after-
noon.
This I understand to be no more than.the sets
of the tide, as going out, or coming in; but I after-
wards understood it was occasioned by the great
draught and reflux of the mighty river Oroonoque;
in the mouth of which river, as I thought after-
wards, our island lay; and th&t this land, which I
perceived to the W. and N. W. was the great
island Trinidad, on the north point of the mouth
of the river: I asked Friday a thousand questions
about the country, the inhabitants, the sea, the
coast, and what nations were near: he told me all
he,kn§w, with the greatest openness imaginable.
I a$ked hiip the names of the several nations of
his sort *of, pebple, but could get no other name
than Caribysj from whence I easily understood,
that these were the Caribbees, which our m&ps
g o %
place on that part of America which reaches from
the mouth of thg river Oroonoque to Guinea, and
onwards to St Marthai he told me, that up a
great way heyond thfeunoou, that was, beyond
the setting of the moon, which must be W. from
their country, there dwelt white-bearded men, like
me, and pointed to my great whiskers, which 1
mentioned before; and that they had killed mudh
mans, that was his word: by which I understood
he meant the Spaniards, whose > cruelties in Ame-
rica had been spread* over' the whol& countries,
and were remembered by all * the nations from
father to son.
I inquired if foe could tell mefeotv I might coitie
from this island, and get amongthose white<men:
he told me, Yes, yes, I'might\gormtwo canoe; I
could not understand what he meant by two canoe;
till at last, with great difficulty^! found he njeant,
that it must be in a large great boat as .big as two
canoes.
This part of Friday's discourse began to relish
with me very well; and from this time I enter-
tained some hopes, that one time or»other I might
find an opportunity-to make my-eseape from tfoia
places and*that*tfais{pooxs-sa^ag^mi^ht^e*anse&ps
to help me to do it. ~
' Daring* the long; time #hatf;' Friday had noW>been
with me, <aiul that he*begi*i to speak to me, and
understand me,* l:wa& not w^rttmg'ta lay A foun-
dation oi religious knowledge in Ms mind/ parti-
cularly, I,faaked^iim one 4hh$*^boi made^him?
The poor OTeatur© 4id/»ot und^fand *nfce-%fc ail,,
but thought I had asked whtf &a£ htf'f&thek but
I took it by another handle, and asked him, Who
made the sea, the ground he walked on, and the
hijls and woods? He told me, it was one old Ben-
s&Hiuckee that lived beyond all; lie could describe
nothing of this great person, but that he was very
©Id j much older, he said, than the sea or the land,
than the moon or the stars* I asked him then, If
thi3 old person had made all things, why did not
ail things worship him? He looked very grave,
and with a perfect look of innocence, said, All
things said Of to him. I asked him if the people
who die in his country, went away any-where?
He said, Yes, they all went to Benamuckee. Then
I aske<| Jhim, whether those they eat up went
thither; too? rhe said, Yes.
From these things I began to instruct him in
the knowledge of the true God. I told him, that
the. great Maker of all things lived there, pointing
up towards heaven: that he governs the world by
the same power and providence by which he made
itj that he was omnipotent, could do every thing
for us, give every thing to us> take every thing
from us; and thus, by degrees^ I opened his eyes.
He listened with great attention, and received with
pleasure the notion of Jesus Christ being sent ta
redeem us, and of the manner of making our
prayers to God^ *and his being able to hear us,,
e^en into heaven. He told me one day, that'if
our Gob Could hear us up * beyond the stin, he
must needs be a greater Goi> thai* their Be&a-
mucfoeey who lived but a little way off, and yet
could not hear, < till they went up* to the -great
mountains, where he dwelt, to speak to him, I
asked him, if ever he went thither to speak to him?
He said, No, they never went that were young
men; none went thither but the old men; whom
he called their Oowookakee, that is, as I made
him explain it to me, their religious, or clergy;
and that they went to say O! (so he called saying
prayers) and then came back, and told them what
Benamuckee said. By this I observed that there
is priestcraft even amongst the most blinded igno-
rant Pagans in the world; and the policy of mak-
ing a secret religion, in order to preserve the vene-
ration of the people to the clergy/ is not only to
be found in the Roman, but perhaps among all re-
ligions in the world, even among the most brutish
arid barbarous savages.
I endeavoured to clear up this fraud to my man
Friday; and told him, that the pretence of their
old men going up to the mountains to say O! to
their god Benamuckee, was a cheat; and their
bringing word from thence what he said, was
much more so; that if they met with any answer,
or spoke with any one there, it must be with an
evil spirit: and then I entered into a long dis-
course with him about the devil, the original of
him, his rebellion against God, his enmity to man,
the reason of it, his setting himself up in the dark
parts of the world to be worshipped instead of
God, and as God, and the many stratagems he
made use of to delude mankind to their ruin; how
he had a secret access to pur passions and to our
affection^ to adapt his snares so to our inclinations,
as to cause us even to be our own tempters, and
to run upon our own destructions by our own
choice.
I found it was not so easy to imprint right no-
tions in his mind about the devil, as it was about
the being of a God : nature assisted all my argu-
ments to evidence to him even the necessity of a
great first cause, and over-ruling governing power,
a secret directing Providence, and of the equity
and justice of paying homage to him that made
us, and the like: but there appeared nothing of
all this in the notion of an evil spirit; of his ori-
ginal, his being, Mis nature, and above all, of his
inclination to do evil, and to draw us in to do so
too: and the poor creature puzzled me once in
such a manner, by a question merely natural and
innocent, that I scarce knew what to say to him.
I had been talking a great deal to him of the power
of God, his omnipotence, his dreadful aversion to
sin, his being a consuming fire to the workers of
iniquity; how, as he had made us all, he could
destroy u$, and all the world, in a moment; and
he listened with great seriousness to me all the
while.
After this, I had been telling him how the devil
was God's enemy in tlje hearts of men, and used
all his malice and skill to defeat the good designs
of Providence, and to ruin the kingdom of Christ
in il\e world? and the like: Well, says Eriday, but
you say vGod is so strong, so great, is he not nuich
strong, much migHtas^the devil? Yes, yes? said.I,
Friday, God is stronger than the devil: God is
above the devil, and therefore we pray to God to
tread him under our feet, and enable us to restet
hisvtemptations, and quench his fiery darts. But,
says he again, If God much stiong, much might
as the devil, why God not kill tire devil, so make
him no more wicked?
I was strangely surprised at his question; and
after all, though I was now an old man, yet I was
but a young doctor, and ill efiough qualified for a
casuist or a solver of difficulties: tod, at first, I
could not tell what to say; so I pretended not to
hear him, and asked hifn what he said? but he was
too earnest for an answer to* forget bis question;
S0i that he repeated it in the very same broken
WQTds, as above. By this time I had recovered
suayself a little, and I said,* God will at la&fc punish
him severely; he is reserved ibr the judgment,
and is to be <iast into* the bottomless pit, to dwell
with everlasting fire. This dpd nt>t satisfy FrtdAy;
bx\t he returns upxm me, repeating mf words, Re-
serve at last! me no understa«njd: but why not kill
the devil now, not kill great ago? You may as
well atsk me, said I, why God does not kill you
and me, when we doj wicked things here that
offend him: we are preserved to repent and be
pardoned. He muses a while at this: Well, Well,
says he, mighty affectionately,, that'well'; so you,
I, devil, all wicked, all preserve, repent, God pair-
don all. Here I was run, down* again by fofth to
the last degree, a#d> it was a testimony to me, how
the mere notions of nature, though they will guide
reasonable creatures to the .knowledge of a God,
and of a \tforship or homage- due to the supreme
being of Go^ as the consequence of our nature;
yet nothi&g but divine revelation can form the
knowledge of Jesus Christ, and of a redemption
purchased for us; of a Mediator; of a new cove-
nant; and of an Intercessor at the footstool of
God's throne: I say nothing but a revelation from
jHeaven can form these in the soul; and that there-
fore the Gospel of our Lord and Saviour Jesus
Christ, I mean the word of God, and the Spirit
of God, promised for the guide and sanctifier of
his people, are the absolutely necessary instructors
of the souls of men in the saving knowledge of
God, and the meafis of salvation.
I therefore Averted the present discourse be-
tween n^e and i&y man, rising up hastily, as upon
some sudden occasion of going out; then sending
him for something a great way off, I seriously
prayed to God*, ,that he would enable me -to in-
struct savingly this,poor savage, assisting by his
Spirit th£,heart of the poor ignorant creature to
receive the light of the knowledge of God in
Ghiuw, reconciling him to himself, and would
gn\d& pie to speak so to him from the word of
G$$d, £l& his conscience might be convinced, his
^e^iopened, and his soul saved: when he came
_3gain to me, I entered into a long discourse with
him upon the subject of lite redemption of man
%,£be Saviour of the world, and of the doctrine
®f the pospei preached* from heaven, viz. of re-
pentance towards iGo©, and faith in our blessed
Lord ffBsus^.Pfcbeni explained to him, as welb^as
I could, -whyioiiw blessed Redeemer took notion
him the nature of angek, but the spdd of Abfaham*
and how, for that .reason, th@ fetllen angels h$d no
2 P
share in the redemption; that he came only to the
lost sheep of the house of Israel, and the like.
I had, God knows, more sincerity than know-
ledge, in all the methods I took for this poor
creature's instruction; and must acknowledge, what
I believe all that act upon the same principle
will find, that in laying things open to him, I
really informed and instructed myself in many
things, that either I did not know, or had not
fully considered before; but which occurred na-
turally to my mind, upon my searching into them
for the infoimation of this poor savage; and I had
more affection in my inquiry after things upon
this occasion, than ever I felt before: so that whe-
ther this poor wild wretch was the better for mt
or no, I had great reason to be thankful that ever
he came to me: my grief sat lighter upon me, my
habitation grew comfortable to me beyomd mea-
sure; and when I reflected, that in this solitary
life, which I had been confined to, I had not only
been moved myself to look up to Heaven, and to
seek to the hand that brought me thither, but was
now to be made an instrument, under Providence,
to save the life, and, for aught I know, the soul of
a poor savage, and bring him to the true know-
ledge of religion, and of the Christian doctrine,
that he might know Christ Jesus, to°know whom
is life eternal; I say, when I reflected upon all
these things, a secret joy ran through every part
of my soul, and I frequently rejoiced that ever I
was brought to tbis place, which I had often
thought the most dreadful of <a11 afflictions that
could possibly have befallen me,
Iii this thankful frame I continued all the re-
mainder of my time; and the conversation which
employed the hours between Friday and me was
such, as made the three years which we lived theie
together perfectly and completely happy, if any
such thing as complete happiness can be found in
a sublunary state. The savage was now a good
Christian, a much better than I; though I have
reason to hope, and bless God for it, that we were
equally penitent, and comforted restored peni-
tents; we had here the word of God to read, and
no farther off from his Spirit to instruct than if we
had been in England.
I always applied myself to reading the Scripture,
and to let him know, as well as I could, the mean-
ing of what I rejad; and he again by his serious
inquiries and questions, made me, as I said before,
a much better scholar in the Scripture knowledge,
than I should ever have been by my own private
reading: another thing I cannot refrain from ob-
serving here also, from experience, in this retired
part of my life; viz. how infinite and inexpressi-
ble 9. blessing it is, that the knowledge of Goi>,
and of the doctrine of salvation by Christ Jesus,
is so plainly laid down in the word of God, so
easy to be received and understood, that as the
bare reading the Scripture made me capable of un-
derstanding enough of my duty to carry me di-
rectly on to the great work of sincere repentance
for my sins, and laying hold of a Saviour for Kfe
and salvation, to a stated reformation in practice,
and obedience to all God's commands, and this
without any teacher or instructor, (I mean, hu-
2 p 2
man) so the plain instruction sufficiently served
to the enlightening this savage creature, and
bringing him to be such a Chiistian, as I have
known few equal to him in my life.
As to the disputes, wranglings, strife and con-
tention, which has happened in the world about
religion, whether niceties in doctrines, or schemes
of church government, they were all presently
useless to us, as, for aught I can yet see, they
have been to all the rest in the world: we had
the sure guide to heaven, vb,* the word of God;
and we had, blessed be God ! comfortable views of
the Spirit of God, teaching and instructing us by
his wQrd, leading us into all truth, and making us
both willing and obedient to the instruction of
his word: and I cannot see the least use that the
greatest knowledge of the disputed points in reli-
gion, which have made such confusions in the
world, would have been to us, if we could have
obtained it—But I must go on with the historical
part of things, and take every part'in its order.
After Friday and I became more intimately ac-
quainted, apd that he could understand almost all
I said to him, and speak fluently, though in bro-
ken English, to me, I acquainted him with my
own story, or at least so mnch of it as related to
my coming into the place; how I had lived there,
and how long. I let him into the mystery (for
such it was to him) of gunpowder and bullets, and
taught him how to shoot. I gave him a knife,
which he was wonderfully delighted lwith ; and I
made him a belt with a frog haliging to it, such as
in England we wear hangers in; attd in the'frog,
instead of an hanger, I gave him an hatchet, which
was not only as good a weapon in some cases, but
much more useful upon many occasions.
I described to him the countries of Europe, and
particularly England, which I came from; how we
lived, how we worshipped God, how we behaved
to one another, and how we traded in ships to all
the parts of the world. I gave him an account of
the^wreck which I had been on board of, and
shewed him, as near as 1 could, the place where
she lay; but she was all beaten in pieces long be-
fore, amd quite gone.
r I shewed him the ruins of our boat, which we
lost when i we escaped, and which I could not stir
\yith my whole strength then, but was now fallen
alrnost all to pieces., Upon seeing this boat, Fri-
day stood musing a great while, and said nothing;
I asked him what it was he studied upon? At last,
says he, Me see such boat like come to place at my
nation,
I did not understand him a good while; but at
last, when I had examined further into it, I under-
stood by him* that a boat, such as that had been,
came on shore upon the country where he lived,
tha,t is, as he explained it, was driven thither by
stress of weather. I presently imagined that some
European ship must have been cast away upon
tljeir coast, and the boat might get loose, and drive
ashore; but was so dull, that I never once thought
of men making escape from a wreck thither, much
less whence they might come; so I only inquired
after a description of the boat.
Friday described the boat to me well enough;
but brought me better to understand him, when
he added, with some warmth, We save the white
mans from drown: then I presently asked him,
if there were any white mans, as he called them,
in the boat? Yes, he said, the boat full of white
mans. I asked him, how many? he told upon his
fingers seventeen. I asked him then, what became
of them? he told me, They live, they dwell at my
nation.
This put new thoughts into my head again; for
I presently imagined, that these might be the men
belonging to the ship that was cast away in sight
of my island, as I now call it; and who, after the
ship was struck on the rock, and they saw her in-
evitably lost, had saved themselves in their boat,
and were landed upon that wild shore among the
savages.
Upon this I inquired of him more critically,
what was become of them? He assured me they
lived still there, that they had been there about four
years, that the savages let them alone, and gave
them victuals to eat. I asked him, how it came
to pass they did not kill them, and eat them? he
said, No, they make brother with them: that is, as
I understood him, a truce: and then he added,
They eat no mans but when make the war fight;
that is to say, they never eat any men, but such
as come to fight with them, and are taken in
battle.
It was after this some considerable time, that
being on the top of the hill, at the east side of the
island, from whence, as I have sard, I had in a
clear day discovered the main or continent of Ame-
rica; Friday, the weather being very serene, looks
very earnestly towards the main land, and in a
kind of surprise falls a jumping and dancing, and
calls out to me, for I was at some distance from
him. I asked him what was the matter? Ojoy!
says he, O glad! there see my country, there my
nation!
I observed an extraordinary sense of pleasure
appeared in his face, and his eyes sparkled, and
his countenance discoveied a strange eagerness, as
if he had a mind to be in his own country again;
and this observation of mine put a great many
thoughts into me; which mad^ me at first not so
easy about my new man Friday as I was before;
and I made no doubt, but that if Friday could get
back to his own nation again, he would not only
forget all his religion, but all his obligations to
me; and would be forward enough to give his
countrymen an account of me, and come back per-
haps with an hundred or two of them, and make
a feast upon me, at which he might be as meny
as he used to be with those of his enemies, when
they were taken in war.
But I wronged the poor honest creature very
much, for which I was very soiry afterwards:
however, as my jealousy increased, and held me
some weeks, 1 was a little more circumspect, and
not so familiar and kind to him as before; in which
I was certainly in the wrong too, the honest
grateful creature having no thought about it, but
what consisted of the best principles, both as a
religious Christian, and as a grateful friend; as
appeared afterwards, to my full satisfaction.
Whilst my jealousy of him lasted, you may be
sure I was every day pumping him, to see if he
would discover any of the new thoughts which I
suspected were in him; but I found every thing he
said was so honest, and so innocent, that I could
find nothing to nourish my suspicion; and, in spite
of all my uneasiness, he made me at last entirely
his own again; nor did he in the least perceive
that I was uneasy; and therefore I could not sus-
pect him of deceit.
One day, walking up the same hill, but the wea-
ther being hazy at sea, so that we could not see
the continent, I called to him, and said, Friday,
do not you wish yourself in your own country,
your own nation? Yes, he said, I be much O glad
to be at my own nation. What would you do
there? said I: would you turn wild again, eat
men's flesh again, and be a savage as you were be-
fore? He looked full of concern, and shaking his
head, said, No, no, Friday tell them to live good,
tell them to pray God, tell them to eat corn-bread,
cattle-flesh, milk, no eat man again. Why then,
said I to him, they will kill you. He looked
grave at that, and then said, No, they no kill me,
they willing love learn: he meant by this, they
would be willing to learn. He added, they learned
much of the bearded mans that came in the boat.
Then I asked him, if he would go back to them?
He smiled at that, and told me he could not swim
so far. I told him I would make a canoe for him.
He told me he would go, if I would go with him.
I go! said I, why they will eat me if I come
there. No, no, says he, Me make them no eat
you, me jnake them much love you: he meant he
.would tell them how I had killed his enemies and
sa^ed his life, and so he would make them love me.
Then he told me, as well as he could, how kind
^?y were t0 seventeen white men, or bearded
4ii£n, as he called them, who came on shore in dis-
tress*
Frpip this time, I confess, I had a mind to
venture pver, and see if I could possibly join with
these bearded men, who, I made no doubt, were
Spaniards or Portuguese; not doubting but if I
£Quld? we, (might fipd some method to escape from
tj^ejaee, being upon the continent, and a good com-
pany tog£tJier, better than I could from an island
fprty ix\ilesfoffj the shore, and alone without help.
$pn after rsoix^e day^ I took Friday to work again,
iby w?y pf discourse; and told him, I would give
I^m, A b^ to go back to his own nation; and ac-
^rd^ng^ly I carried him to my frigate, which lay
pflujjhe other side of the island; and having cleared
£t of,water (for I always kept it sunk in the water),
XI Jb^ough£ it out, shewed it him, and we both went
vrTI, found he was q, most dexterous fellow at ma-
,3i3gingit; he would m^ke it go almost as swift and
jf$?tjagain as I coul^; so when he was in, I said
4q him, Well, now; Friday, shall we go to your
n^Qn? He looked very dull at my saying so,
^vhich, it seems, was because he thought the boat
too small to go so far. I told him then I had a
bigger: soothe nexif day I went to the place where
the first boat lay \yhich I had made, but which I
could not get into th$ water: he said that was big
2 Q
enough; but then, as I had taken no care of it,
and it had lain two or three-and-twenty years
there, the sun had split and dried it, that it was
in a manner rotten. Friday told me, such a boat
would do very well, and would carry ' much
* enough vittle, dri$k, bread;' that was his way of
talking.
Upon the whole, I was by this time so fixed
upon my design of going over with him to the con-
tinent, that I told him we would go and make one
as big as that, and he should go home in it. He
answered not one word, but looked very grave and
sad. I asked him, what was the matter with him?
He asked me again thus, Why you angry mad
with Friday ? what me done ? I asked him What
he meant? I told him I was not fcfigry with him
at all. No angry! no angry! says he, repeating the
words several times. Why send Friday home away
to my nation? Why, said I, Fiiday, did you not say
you wished you were there? Yes, yes, says he,
wish be both there; no wish Friday there, no
master there. In a word, he* would not thiftk of
going there without me. I go there, Friday! said
I, what should I do there? He turned very quick
upon me at this. You do great deal much good,
says he, you teach wild mans be good, sober, tame
mans; you tell them know God, pray God, and
Kve new life. Alas, Friday, said I, thou knowest
not what thou sayest; I am but an ignorant man
myself. Yes, yes, says he, you teechee me good,
you teechee them good. No, no, Friday, said I,
you shall go without me; leave me here to< Jive
by myself, as I did before. He looked confused
again at that word, and running to one of the hat-
chets which he used to wear, he takes it up has-
tily, and gives it me. What must I do with this?
said I to him. You take kill Friday, says he.
What must I kill you for? said I again. He re-
turns very quick, What you send Friday away for?
Take kill Friday, no send Friday away. This he
spoke so earnestly, that I saw tears stand in his
eyes. In a word, I so plainly discovered the ut-
most affection in him to me, and a firm resolution
in him, that I told him then, and often after, that
I would never send him away from me, if he was
willing to stay with me.
Upon the whole, as I found by all his discourse
a settled affection to me, and that nothing should
part him fromme, so I found all the foundation of
his desire to go to his own country was laid in his
ardent affection to the people, and his hopes of my
doing them good; a thing, which as I had no no-
tion of myself, so-1 had not the least thought, or
intention, or desire of undertaking it: but still I
found a strong inclination to my attempting an es-
cape, as above, founded on the supposition ga-
thered from the former discourse; viz. that there
were seventeen bearded men there: and therefore,
^without any delay, I went to work with Friday, to
find out a great tree proper to fell, and make a
large periagua or canoe, to undertake the voyage.
There were trees enough in the island to have
built a little fleet, not of periaguas and canoes only,
but even of good large vessels: but the main thing
I looked at^ was ta get one so. near the* watei}
U2
that we might launch it when it was made, to
avoid the mistake I committed at first.
At last Friday pitched upon a tree; for I found
he knew much better than I what kind of wood
was fittest for it; nor can I tell to this day what
wood to call the tree we cut down, except that it
was very like the tree we call fustic, or between
that and the Nicaragua wood, for it was much of
the same colour and smelL Friday was for Burning
the hollow or cavity of this tree out, to make it
into a boat: but I shewed him how rather, tq cut it
out with tools, which after I shewed him how to
use, he did very handily; and in about a month's
hard labour we finished it, and made it very hand-
some, especially when, with *a\ir axes, which I
shewed him how to handle, we cut and hewed the
outside into the true shape of a boat. After this*,
however, it cost us near a fortnight's time to get
her along, a& it were inch by inch, upon great
rollers into the water; but when she was in, she
would have, carried twenty men with great ease.
When she was in the water, and though she
was so big, .it amazed me to see with what dexte-
rity and haw swift my man Friday could manage
her, turn her, and paddle her along; so Tasked
him if he would go, and if we might venture over
in her? Yes, he said, he venture over in her very
well,, though great blow wind: however, I had a
farther design that he knew nothing of, .and that
was to make a mast and sail, and to fit her with an
anchor and cable. As to a mast, that was easy
enough to get; so I pitched upon a straight young
 •
..iV/i
cedar-tree, which I found near the place, and
which there was a great plenty of in the island;
and I set Friday to work to cut it down, and gave
him directions how to shape and order it: but as
to the sail, that was my particular care; I knew I
had old sails or rather pieces of old sails enough;
but as I had had them now twenty-six years by me,
and had not been very careful to preserve them,
not imagining that I should ever have this kind of
use for them, I did not doubt but they were all
rotten; and indeed most of them were so: however,
I found two pieces which appeared pretty good,
and with these I went to work, and with a great
deal of pains, and awkward tedious stitching (you
may be sure) for want of needles, I at length
made a three-cornered ugly thing, like what we
call in England a shoulder-of-mutton sail, to go
with a boom at bottom, and a little short sprit at
the top, such as usually our ships long-boats sail
with, and such as I best knew how to manage;
because it was such an one as I used in the boat in
which I made my escape from Barbary, as related
in the first part of my story.
I was near two months performing this last
work; viz. rigging and fitting my mast and sails;
for I finished them very complete, making a
small stay, and a sail or foresail to it, to assist, if
we should turn to windward; and, which was more
than all, I fixed a rudder to the stern of her, to
steer with; and though I was but a bungling ship-
wright, yet, as I knew the usefulness, and even
necessity of such a thing, I applied myself with so
mch pains to do it, that at last I brought it to
pass, though, considering the many dull contri-
vances I had for it that failed, I think it cost me
almost as much labour as making the boat.
After all this was done, I had my man Friday to
teach as to what belonged to the navigation of my
boat; for though he knew very well how to pad-
die the canoe, he knew nothing what belonged to
a sail and a rudder, and was the more amazed when
lie saw me work the boat to-and-again in the sea
by the rudder, and how the sail gybed, and filled
this way or that way, as the course we sailed
changed; I say, when he saw this he stood like
one astonished and amazed; however, with a little
use, I made ail these things familiar to him, and
he became an expert sailor, except that as to the
compass I could make him understand very little
of that: on the other hand, as there was very little
cloudy weather, and seldom or never any fogs in
those parts, there was the less occasion for a com*
pass, seeing the stars were always to be seen by
night, and the shore by day, except in the rainy
seasohs; and then nobody cared to stir abroad,
either by land or sea.
I was now entered on the seven-and-twentieth
year of my captivity in this place; though the three
last years that I had this creature with me, ought
rather to be left out of the account, my habita-
tion being quite of another kind than in all the
resti>f my time. I kept the anniversary of my
landing here with the same thankfulness to God
for his mercies as at first; and if I had such cause
of acknowledgment at first, I had much more so
now, having such additional testimonies of the care
of Providence over me, and the great hopes I had
of being effectually and speedily delivered; for I
had an invincible impression upon my thoughts,
that my deliverance was at hand, and that I should
not be another year in this place: however, I went
on with my husbandry, digging, planting, and
fencing, as usual; I gathered and cured my grapes,
and did every necessary thing, as before.
The rainy season was in the mean time upon me,
when I kept more within doors than at other times;
so I had stowed our new vessel as secure as we
could, bringing her up into the creek, where, as I
said in the beginning, I landed my rafts from the
ship; and haling her up to the shore, at high-water
mark, I made my man Friday dig a little dock,
just big enough for her to float in; and then, when,
the tide was out, we made a strong dam cross the
end of it, to keep the water out; and so she lay
dry, as to the tide, from the sea; and to keep the
rain off, we laid a great many boughs of trees so
thick, that she was as well thatched as an house;
and thus we waited for the months of November
and December, in which I designed to make my
adventure-
When the settled season began to come in, as
the thought of my design returned with the fair
weather, I was preparing daily for the voyage;
and the first thing I did was to lay up a certain
quantity of provision, being the store for the voy-
age; and intended,, in a week or a fortnight's time,
to open the dock, and launch out our boat; I was
busy one morning upon something of this kind,
when I called to Friday, and bid him go to the
sea-shore, and see if he could find a turtle or tQr-
toise, a thing which we generally got once a week,
for the sake of the eggs, as well as the flesh. Fri-
day had not been long gone, when he came nm-
ning back, and flew over my outward wall, or
fence, like one that felt not the ground, or the
steps he set his feet on; and before I had time to
speak to him, he cried out to me, O masterl O
master! O sorrow! O bad! What's the matter,
Friday, said I? O yonder there, says he, one, two,
three, canoe! one, two, three! By this way of
speaking I concluded there were six; but on in-
quiry I found there were but three. Well, Friday,
said I, do not be frighted; so I heartened him up
as well as I could. However, I saw the poor fal-
low most terribly scared; for nothing ran in his
head but that they were come to look for liijn, *vnd
would cut him in pieces, and eat him; t^e pooi;
fellow trembled so, that I scarce knew wh^t to 4°
with him: I comforted him as well as I could,
and told him I was in as much danger as he, and
that they would eat me as well as him: but, said
I, Friday, we must resolve to fight them : Can you
fight, Friday? Me shoot, says he, but,there cqme
many great number. No matter for that, said 1
again, our guns will fright them that we do not
kill. So I asked him, whether, if I resolved to
defend him, he would defend me, and stand by
me, and do just as I bade him? He said, Me die,
when you bid die, master; so I went and fetched
a gbod dram of rum, and gave hjm; for I had bepn
so good an husband of my rum^ that I had a great
deal left:, whence ha4 drank it, I piade bim take
the tw& fowling-pieces which we always earned,
and load them with large swan shot as big as small
pistol-bullets; then I took four muskets, and loaded
them with two slugs, atid &v6 small bullets each;
dnd my two pistols I loaded with a brace of bul-
lets each: I hung my great sword, as usual, naked
by my side, and gave Friday his hatchet.
When I had thus prepared myself, I took my
perspective-glass, and went up to the side of the
hill, to see what I could discover; and I found
quickly, by my glass, that there were one-and-
twenty savages, three prisoners, and three canoes;
and that their whole business seemed to be the
triumphant banquet upon these three human bo-
dies; a barbarous feast indeed, but nothing more
than as I had observed was usual with them.
I observed also, that they were landed, not where
they had done when Friday made his escape, but
nearer to fny creek, where the shore was low, and
where a thick wood came' close almost down to
theses!: this, with the abhbrrence of the inhuman
entfcnd these wretches came about, so filled me with
indignation, that I catme down again to Friday,
a*$dtold him, I was resolved to go down to them,
and*kill them all; and asked him if he would stand
by me. He Was now gotten dver his fright, and
his spirits being a little raised with the dram I had
glten him, he was very cheerful; and told me, as
before, he would die when I bid die.
Iti this fit of fbry, I took first and divided the
arms Which I'had charged, as before, between us;
I gave Friday 6ne* pistol to stick in'his girdle, and
$free guns upon his s&oulder; audi t<K>k oile pis-
2 a
tol, and the other three myself; and in this posture
we marched out. I took a small bottle of rum in
my pocket, and gaye Friday a large bag with more
powder and bullets; and as to orders, I charged
him to keep close behind me, and not to stir, shoot,
or do any thing till I bid him; and in the mean
time, not to speak a word: in this posture I fetched
a compass to my right Jiand of near a mile, as well
to get over the creek as to get into the wopd; so
that I might come within shot of tftem, before I
could be discovered, which I had se^n by *ny glass
it was easy to do. - , <
While I was making tbisf marc^L, piy^ former
thoughts returning, I began tp*abate ray resolu-
tion; I do not mean, that I entertained any; fear
of their number; for as they were naked, unarmed
wretches, it is certain I was superior to them; nay,
though I had been alone :< but it occurred to my
thoughts, what call, wh^fc occasion, much less
what necessity, I was ip to go and dip my hands
in blood, to attack popple who had neither done
or,in tended me any wrong; who, as to me, weje
innocent, and whose barbarous customs w^re their
own disaster^ being in them a token'indeed-of
God's, having left therr^ with the other nations of
that part of the world, to such stupidity and to
such inhuman courses; but did not call me to take
upon me to he a judge of th^ir actions, much less
an executioner of his justice; tjhat whenever he
thought fit, he would take the cause into his own
hands, and by national vengeance punish them for
national crimes; but that in th? rnean time, it was
none pf my fyusine&s: tljat it was true, Jriday might
justify it, because he Was a declared enemy, and
in a state of war with those very particular people,
and it was lawful for him to attack them; but I
fcOfild not say the same with respect to me. These
things were so warmly pressed upon my thoughts
dll'thewayas I went, that I resolved I would only
|f& plac^ myself near them, that I might observe
their barbarous feast, and that I would act then as
God should direct; but that unless something
Offered that? was more a call to me than yet I knew
Of, I woujd itt>t meddle with them.
With this resolution I entered the wood, and
With dll p$ssit>te waraiess and silence (Friday fol-
lowing close at my heels) I marched till I came
to the skirt of the wood, on the side which was
t\ext to them; only that one corner of the wood
ky between me and them: here I called softly to
Wid&yl ^and shewing him a great tree, which was
just at the cottier of the wood, I bade him go to
the itee| and bring me word if he could see there
plainly what they wer6 d&ing: he did so, and
$&fti£ immediately back to me, and told me they
i&igfrhtbe plainly viewed there^ that they were all
ibotit the fire, eating tfhe flesh of one of their pri-
soners; and that another lay bound upon the sand,
ft little from them, whom he said they would kill
nfc£t,J and which fifed the very soul within me.
He told me, it was riot one of their nation, but
otte of the bearded men whom he had told me of,
who catnie to their country in the boat. I was
filled with horror at the very naming the white-
bearded mati, and, going to the tree, I saw txlkirity,
by my glass, a white ihan, who lay upon^the* beach
2 r 2
of the sea, with his hands #nd his feet tied* with
flags, or things like rushes; and that he was an
European, and had clothes on.
There was another tree, and a little thicket be-
yond it, about fifty yards nearer to them than thfc
place where I was, which, by going a little way
about, I saw I might come at undiscovered, aitfd
that then I should be within half shot of them; so
I withheld my passion, though I was indeed env
raged to the highest degree: and going back about
twenty paces, I got behind some bushes, which
held all the way till I came to the other tree, and
then I came to a little rising ground, Which gave
me a full view of them, at the distance of abaat
eighty yards.
I had now not a moment to lose; for nineteen
of the dreadful wretches sat upon the ground all
close huddled together, and had just sent the other
two to butcher the poor Christian, and bring him,
perhaps limb by limb, to their fire; and they were
stooped down to untie the bands at his feet. I
turned to Friday; Now, Friday, said I, do as I bid
thee. Friday said, he would. Then, Friday, said
I, do exactly as you see me do; fail in nothing.
So I set down one of the muskets and the fowling-
piece upon the ground, and Friday did the like by
his; and with the other musket I took my aim at
the savages, bidding him do the like* Then ask-
ing him if he was ready, he said, Yes. Then fire
at them, said I; aud the same moment I fired
also.
Friday took his aim so much better than I, that
on the-side that he shat, .he ki|kd two o£ them>
and wounded three more; and on my side, I killed
one,, $pd wounded two. They were, you may be
sure, in a dreadful consternations and all of them,
W&o were not hurt, jumped up upon their feet im-
m§diately, but did not know which way to run,
Qt whieh way tp look; for they knew not from
Whence their detraction came, Friday kept h^s
eyes qk>se upon me, that as I had bid him, he
might? observe w?hat I did; so as soon as the first
§hofc/wa§ #i&de, I thiew down the piece, and took
up the lotyling-piece,,and Friday did the like: he
$&%s msvo&k* a©d present; he did the same again.
AreyOu ready? JBrjday? said L Yes, says he. Let
fly tjhej?* said. I, in ithe name of God; and with
that I^ed agq^n among the amazed wretches, and
$& did Friday; and^s our pieces were now loaden
With what I called swan?&tet, or small pistol bul-

wounded, that .they ran,about yelling and scream-

KpWjvFriday* jsaid I> feyi&g down the discharged

dfeal of courage? n|>o& which I rushed out of the
?W§od, mid^showe&mysslf* and Friday close at my
ifo®t: &$$oon*as I perceived they saw me, I shouted
as lo&d fcs I scfuld^ftdtbade^Friday do so too; and

Hot very fast, being loaded with arms as I waaj I
made dnnectl^jfexwardsi the poor vxetiio^who was
as Lsaid,, lying^poki the faeadv onshore)between
the place where they sat and the sea; the two
butchers, who were just going to work with him,
had left him, at the surprise of our first fire, and
fled in a terrible fright to the sea-side, and had
jumped into a canoe, and three more of the rest
made the same way: I turned to Friday, and bade
him step forwards, and fire at them;'he understood
me immediately, and running about forty yards trt
be near them, he shot at them, and I thoughtdi&
had killed them all; for I saw them all fall on an!
heap into the boat; though I saw tw6 of them uip
again quickly: however, he killed twoofitherny
and wounded the third, so that he lay down in the
bottom of the boat, as if he had been deacL
While my man Friday fired at them, I pulled
out my knife, and cut the flags that bound thd
poor victim; and loosing his hands and> feet £
lifted him up, and asked him in fehe< Portuguese/
tongue, what he was? He answered* in Latin*}
Christianus; but was so weak and faint, that fyci
could scarce stand, or speak; I took my bottle out
of my pocket, and gave it him, making signs that'
he should drink, which hp did; and I gavGhim®}
piece of bread, which het eat; then I asked him+<
what countryman he was? and he said, Espagnole?
and, being a little recovered) let me know, \fy all
the signs he could possibly'make, how much he
was in my debt for his deliverance. Seignior, said
I, with as much Spatnish as If could make up, we
will talk afterwards, but we must fight now: if
you have any strength left, take,this pistol and
sword, and lay about ypu:v/hb took them>v&yi

hands, but as if they had put new vigour into him?
be* flew upon his murderers like a fury, and had;
Gutstwo of them in pieces in an instant; for the
truth is, as the whole was a surprise to them, so
the poor creatures were so much frighted with
the noise of our pieces, that they fell down for
mere amazement and fear, and had no more power
to attempt their own escape, than their flesh had
to resist our shot; and that was the case of those
five that Friday shot in the boat; for as three of
them fell with the hurt they received, so the other
two fell with the fright.
I kept my piece in my hand still, without firing,
being willing to keep my charge ready, because I
had given the Spaniard my pistol and sword: so
I called to Friday,, and bade him run up to the
ttee from whence we first fired, and fetch the arms
which lay there, that had been discharged, which
he did* with great swiftness; and then giving him
my mufcket, I sat down myself to load all the rest
again^'and bade them eome to me when they
wanted* While I was loading these pieces, there
happened a fierce engagement between the Spa-
niard and one of the savages, who made at him
with one of their great wooden swords, the same
weapcm that was to have killed him before, if I
had not prevented it- The Spaniard, who was as bold
and as tirajre&s fiomMim.imagined, though weak,
hard fotfgbt>this I^diin^a good while, and had cut
him fwo^eafev#aui!d&@*i bis head; but the savage,

Those that were in the canoe, worked hard to
get out of gum-shot; and though Friday made two
or three shot at them* I did not find that he hit
any of them. Friday would fain have had me
take one of their canoes, and pursue them; and in-
deed I was very anxious about their escape, lest
carrying the news home to their people, they
should come back, perhaps, with two or three
hundred of their canoes, and devour us by mere
multitudes; so I consented to pursue them by sea;
awl mn-ning to one of their canoes, I jumped in, and
bade Friday follow me; but when I was in the
canoe, I was surprised to find another poor crea-
ture lie there alive, bound hand and foot, as the
Spaniard was, for the slaughter, and almost dead
with fear, not knowing what the matter was; for
hevhad not been able to look up overthe side of the
boat, he was tied so hard, neck and heels, and had
been tied so long, that he had really little life in
him.
I immediately cut * the twisted flags, or rushes,
which they had bound him with, and would have
helped him up; but he could not stand, or speak,
but groaned most piteously, believing, it seems
still, that he was only unbound in order to be
killed.
When Friday came to him, I bade him speak to
him, and tell him of his deliverance; and pulling
out my bottle* made him give the poor wretch a
dram, which, with the news of his being delivered,
revived him, and he sat up in the boat; but when
Friday came, to hear him speak, and looked In his
2 6
face, it wfculd have moved any one to tears, to have
seen how Friday kissed him, embraced him* hugged
him, cried, laughed, hallooed, jumped about,
danced, sung, then cried again, wrung his hands,
beat his own face and head, and *then sung and
jumped about again like a distracted creature. It
was a good while before I could make him speak
to me, or tell me what was the matter; butwheu
he came a little to himself, he told me that it was
his father. * >
It was not easy for me to express haw i^mpyed
me, to see what ecstasy and filial a,f$ectian>4iad
worked in this poor savage, at the sight pf his fa-
ther, and of his being delivered fwm death; nor
indeed can I describe half the extravagancies.of.his
affection after this; for he went into the boat and
out of the boat a great many times; when he went
in to him, he would sit down by him* open l>is
breast, and hold his.father's head close to his, bo-
som half an hour together, to nourish it; then he
took his arms and ankles, which were numbed and
stiff with the binding, and chafed and rubbed them
with his hands; and J, perceiving what th# ?ase
was? gave him some rum out of my bottle to rub
them with, which did them a great deal of good,
This action put an end to our pursuit of the
canoe with the other savages, who were now gotten
almost out of sight; and it was happy fo* us that
we did not; for it blew Bb hard within> two hours
after, and before they could be gotten a quarter of
their way, and continued blowing so hard all night,
and that from the north-west, w*hich was against
#F tfdm&sotf cbusoe. 315
$iefti, th&t I could not suppose their boat could
live, <*r that they ever reached to their own coast
But to return to Friday; he was so busy about
his father, that I could not find in my heart to take
h**n off for some time: but after I thought he could
leave him a little, I called him to me, and he came
jumping and laughing, and pleased to the highest
extreme. Then I asked him, if he had given his
fetber any bread? He shook his head, and said,
None: ugly dog eat all up self. So I gave him a
cttfee of bread out of a little pouch I carried on
jna/rp&se; I also gave him a dram for himself, but
lie Would net teste it, but carried it to his father.
I had in my pocket also two or three bunches of
itiy raisin*, so I gave him a handful of them for
his father. He had no sooner given his father
Vltese raisins, but I saw hhn come out of the boat,
and tfun away as if he had been bewitched. He
ran at suCfo^a rate, (for he was the swiftest fellow
of iris feet that ever I saw) I say, he ran at
#uch-a rate, that he was out of sight, as it were,
inLa instant; and though I called and hallooed too
after him, it was all one; away he went, and in a
quarter of an hour I saw him come back again,
though not so fast as he went; and as he came
fcfeatfer, I found his pace was slacker, because he
liad something hi his hand.
• When he came up to ine, I found he had been
4piite ftom^fo* an.earfcfoen^&g, or pot, tp bring his
father Some fVesii w^ater; and that he had got two
more eake^ w loaves of bread. The thread he g^ve
me, but the water he carried to his father: how-
ever, as I was very thirsty too, I took a little sup
2 s 2
of it: this water revived his father more than all
the rum or spirits I had given him; for he was
just fainting with,thirst.
When his father had drank, I called him, to
know if there was any water left; he said, Yes; and
I bade him give it to the poor Spaniard, who was
in as much want of it as his father; and I sent one
of the cakes, that Friday brought, to the Spaniard
too, who was indeed very weak, and was reposing
himself upon a green place, under the shade of a
tree, and whose limbs were also very stiff, and
very much swelled with the rude bandage he had
been tied with: when I saw that upon Friday's
coming to him with the water, he sat up and drank,
and took the bread, and began to eat, I went to
him, and gave him an handful of raisins; he looked
up in my face with all the tokens of gratitude and
thankfulness that could appear in any countenance;
but was so weak, notwithstanding he had so exerted
himself in the fight, that he could not stand upon
his feet; he tried to do it two or three times, but
was really not able, his ankles were so swelled and
so painful to him; so I bade him sit still, and
caused Friday to rub his ankles, and bathe them
with rum, as he had done his father's.
I observed the poor affectionate creature every
two minutes, or perhaps less, all the while he was
here, turned his head about, to see if his father was
in the same place and posture as he left him
sitting; and at last he found he was not to be
seen; at which he st arted up, and, without speak-
ing a word, flew with that swiftness to him, that
one could scarce perceive his feet to touch the
 1

ground as he went: but when he came, he only
found he had laid himself down to ease his limbs:
so Friday came back to me presently, and I then
spoke to the Spaniard to let Friday help him up,
if he could, and lead him to the boat,'and then he
should carry him to out dwelling, where I would
take care of him: but Friday, a lusty young fellow,
took the Spaniard quite up upon his back, and car-
ried him away to the boat, and set him down softly
upon the side or gunnel of the canoe, with his
feet in the inside of it, and then lifted them quite
in, and set him close to his father, and presently
stepping out again, launched the boat off, and
paddled it along the shorefaster than I could walk,
though the wind blew pretty hard too; so he
brought them both safe into our creek; and leav-
ing them in the boat, runs, away to fetch the other
canoe. As he passed me, I spoke to him, and
asked him, whither he went? He told me, Go
fetch more boat; so away he went like the wind;
for sure never man or horse ran like him, and he
had the other canoe in the creek almost as soon as
I got to it by land; so he wafted me over, and then
went to help our new guests out of the boat,
which he did; but they were neither of them
able to walk; so that poor Friday knew not what
to do.
To remedy this, I went to work in my thought,
and calling to Friday to bid them sit down on the
bank while he came to me, I soon made a kind of
hand-barrow to lay them on, and Friday and I car-
ried them up both together upon it between us;
but when we got them to the outside of our wall or'
fortification, we were at § worse loss than before;
for it was impossible i;o get them over; and I was
resolved riot to break it -down: so I set to work
again; and Friday and I, in about two hours time,
made a very handsome.tent, covered with old sails,
and above that with boughs of trees^ being in the
space without our outward fence, and between
that and the grove of young wood which I had
planted, and here we made two bed$ of such
things as I had; viz. of good rice-straw, with
blankets laid upon it lo lie on, and another to
cover them on each~bqd.
My island was now pep^ied, and^I thought my-
self very rich in subjects; and it was a merry re-

killed: then I cut off the hind quarter, and, chop-
ping itTntd small pieces, I set Friday to work
to boiling and stewing, and made them a very good
dish, I assure you, of flesh and broth; having put
some barley and rice also into the broth, and as I
cooked it without doors (for I made no fire within
my inner wall) so I carried it all into the new
tent; and having set a*table there for them, I sat
down and e&t my dinner also with them; and, as
Well as 1 could, cheered them and encouraged
them, Friday being thy interpreter, especially to
his father, and indeed to the Spaniard too; for the
Spaniard tfpoke the Kiiigtia'ge of the savages pretty
well.
After We had dined, or rather supped, I ordered
FHday to take tkig of the* canoes, and go and fetch
our musquettf aftd other fire-arms, which, for want
6f tiftie, we had left frpdft the place of battle; and

to hiquiffe ofhHMfcthtt,* what^li^4i&«ght (STthe
escape of the savages in that canoe? and whether
he might expect a return of them with a power
too great for us to resist? His first opinion was,
that the savages in the boat never could live out
the storm which blew that night they went off,
but must of necessity be drowned or driven south
to those other shores, where they were as sure to
be devoured, as they were to be drowned if they
were cast away; but as to what they would do if
they came safe on shore, he said he knew not; but
it was his opinion, that they were so dreadfully
frighted with the manner of being attacked, the
noise, and the fire, that he believed they would
tell their people they were all killed by thunder
and lightning, and not by the hand of man ;» and
that the two which appeared (viz. Friday and I)
were two heavenly spirits or furies come down to
destroy them, and not men with weapons. This,
lie said, he knew, because he heard them cry out
so in their language to one another; for it was im-
possible for them to conceive that a man should
dart fire, and speak thunder, and kill at a distance,
without lifting up the hand, as was done now.
And this old savage was in the right, for, as I un-
derstood since by other htfnds, the savages of that
part never attempted to go over to the island af-
terwards. They were so-terrified with the accounts
given by thejse four men (for it seems they did
escape the sea)> that they believed whoever went
to that enchanted island, would be destroyed with
fire from the gods*
This, however, I knew not, and therefore was
under continual apprehensions for a good while,
and kept always upon my guard, I and all my
army; for as there were now four of us, I would
have ventured upon an hundred of them fairly in
the open field at any time.
'In a little time, however, no more canoes ap-
pearing, the fear of their coming wore off, and I
began to take my former thoughts of a voyage to
the main into consideration, being likewise as-
sured by Friday's father, that I might depend upon
good usage from their nation on his account, if I
would go.
But my thoughts were a little suspended, when
I had a serious * discourse with the Spaniard, and
when I understood, that there were sixteen more
of his countrymen and Portuguese, who having
been-cast away, and made their escape to that side,
lived thereat peace indeed with the savages, but
were very sore put to it for necessaries, and indeed
for life, I asked him all the particulars of their
voyage, and found they were a Spanish ship,
bound from the Rio de la Plata to the Havanna,
being directed to leave their loading there, which
was chiefly hides and silver, and to bring back
what European goods they could meet with there;
that they had five Portuguese seamen on board,
whom they took out of another wreck; that
fivie -of their own/men were drowned when first
the ship 5was dost; and that these escaped through
infinite dangers and hazards^ and arrived almost
starved on - the Cannibal coast, where they ex-
pected to have been devoured every moment.
He told- mey they had some arms with them, but
they were^psrf ectlj* useless, for that they had neither
2 T
powder-or> ball, the washing of the sea having
'spoiled all their powder, but a little which they
used at their first landing to provide themselves
some food*
I asked him what-he thought would become of
them there; and4f they iiad4 formed no design of
making any escape? Hesadd^ 4&ey Md many con-
sultations ^about it;- but th&fc-havkig^ithefr vessel,

people, I might be ill used for my kindness to
them, and make my case worse than it was before.
He answered, with a great deal of candour and
ingenuity, that their condition was so miserable,
and tjbey we^re so sensible of it, that he believed
they would abhor the thought of using any man

nor any food, but at the mercy and discretion of
the savages; out of all hopes of ever returning to
their own country; and that he was sure, if I
would undeitake their relief, they would live and
die by me,
Upon these assurances, I resolved to venture to
lelieve them, if possible, apd to send the old savage
and this Spaniard over to them to treat: but when
he had gotten all things in readiness to(go} the
Spaniard himself started an objection, which had
so much prudence in it on one hand, ^and $o much
sincerity on the other hand, that I cpuld not but
be very well satisfiedj in it; rand, by his advice,
put off the deliverance of his coipr3<$es for at least
half a year. The case was thus:
He had been with us jiow a&oujt, a month; du-
ring which time I had let him se£ inf\y^t (tnanner
I had provided, with the assistance of Prpvidence,
for my support; and he saw evidently what stock
of corn and rice I ^iad laiji up; which, as it was
more thaji sufficient fpr myself, so it was not suf-
ficient, at least without, goo$ husbandry, for my
family, now it was increased to number four; but
much less would it be sufficient, if rhis country-
men, who were, as he said, fourteen still alive,
should come overs and least of all would it be suf-
ficient to victual our vessel^ if jve should build
one, for a voyage to any of the christian colonies
of America. So he told me, he thought it would
be more adviseable, to let him and the other two
dig and {cultivate some more l#nd, as much as I
could sp^re s^d to sow; and th^t \ve should wait
another,harvest jhat w^ might haye a supply of
corn for his countrymen when they should come;
for want might be a temptation to them to disa-
gree, or not to think" themselves delivered, other-
wise than out of one difficulty into another. You
know, says he, the children of Israel, though they
rejoiced at first at th<*ir being delivered out of
Egypt, yet rebelled ev*en against God himself, that
delivered them, when they came to want bread in
the wilderness.
'His caution was so seasonable, and his advice so
good, that I cpuld not but be very well pleased
with his proposal, as well as I was satisfied with
his fidelity: so wte fell to digging, all four of us,
as weir as (He wooden tools wre were furnished
with permitted; and in about a month's time, by
the end*of which it was seed-time, we had gotten
as nfucTi land cdred and trimmed up as we sowed
twetity-two bushels 6f barley on, and sixteen jars
of rice," which vtfas/in short, all the seed we had
tb spare; nor indeed diet we leave ourselves barley
•sufficient for our own fobd for the six months that
We had to eipect oftf 6rop, that is to say, reckon-
ing from th'e time we set our seed aside for sowing;
for it is not to be suppbsed it is six months in the
ground in that country.
Having now spciety enough, and our number
being sufficient to put uS out of fear of the savages,
if*'they liad copae, unless their number had been
very great:;- vve went freely all over the island,
wherever we found occasion; and as here we had
our escape or deliverance upon our thoughts/ it
was impossible, at least for me, to have the nieans
of it out 6f mine; to'thisf purpose, I marked otit
severaf trees, which I thought fit jfbr our worlc^
and I set Friday and his father to cutting them
down; atid then I caused "the Spaniard, to whom
I imparted my thoughts oti that affair, to oVersee
and direct their work: I shewed them with What
indefatigable pains I had hewed a l»i*ge tree into
single planks, and I caused therri"1 to do the like,
till they had made about a d&ren large ptanks of
good oak, near two feet broad, thirty-five fe6t long,
and from two inches to four Inched thick \ what
prodigious labour it took xtp, aAy oiie ifitiy irhagine.
At the same time I ctintriv^d t6Jincfe$se' my
little flock of tame goats as'rtiucll as I coiifd; and
to this purpose I made Friday and the S^&niard to
go out one day, and myself, with Friday, the next
day, for we took our turns: and by thfe means >Ve
got about twenty youtig kids to breed up with the
rest: for whenever we shot the dain^ we-saved th6
kids, and added ihem to 6i\r flock: but, above ill,
the season for curing the'grapes coming on, I
caused such a jirodi^ioCi^ qtiatltity to be hung up
in the sun, thkt I believe; hdd* wfe been at Alfcanj^
where the raising 6f thes\in kte ctired, we should
have filled sixty or eighty Ukrrelfc; and these, Wiftl
our bread, was a great part of t>ur foad, &(id very
good living too, I assufe^yoii^fol4 it is an &66eil-
ing nourishing food.'
A'It was tiow harvest, a"nd btir'cro^ih gobt! ordeT;
k*fr&s n&t the most plentifM ^nci^ease Ihad 3een
in the island, but, however, 'it'Ms endu&W to %ri-
sWer'our-end; for^frofn 'WeiitjMfc^o ^ushd^ of
barley^ wer%rougeKt4ti'arid tllffe^hec^but aboVe t\ird
hundred and twenty bushels, and the like in pro-
portion of the rice, which was store enough for
our food to the next harvest, though all the six-
teen Spaniards had been on shore with me; or, if
we had been ready for a voyage, it would very
plentifully have victualled our ship, to have car-
ried us to any part of the. world, that is to say, of
America. When we had thus housed and secured
our magazine of corn, we fell to work to make
more wicker-work; viz. great baskets, in which
we kept it; and the Spaniard was very handy and
dexterous at this part, and often blamed me, that
I did not make some things for defence of this
kind of work; but I saw no need of it. And now,
having a fell supply of food for ail the guests ex-
pected, I g^ve- the Spaniard leave to go over to
the main, to see what he could do with those he
left behind him there. I gave him a strict charge
jn writing not to bring any man with him, who
would p^t first swea#, in the presence of himself
and of the old savage* that he would no way in-

one of the canoes, which they might be said tp
cope in, or rather were brought in, when they
came as prisoners to be devoured by the, savages.
I gave each of them a musket with a fiiclock
on, it, and about eight charges,of .powder and ball,
charging them to be very good husbands of both,K
and not to use either of them but^ upon urgent
occasions.
This was a cheerful woik, being the fir^t mea-
suies used by me in view of my deliverance fipr
now 27 yeais and some days; I gave them provi-
sions of bread, and of £ried grapes, sufficient^ for
themselves for many days, and sufficient for then;
countrymen for about eight days time;, and wish-
ing them a good voyage,, I let Jhgra go, agreeing^
with them about a signal they should fyang out at
their return, by wfyiqh I should know them again,
when they came back, at a di?tapce, before theyt
came on shore, ,
They went away with a f^r gale on the day,
that the moon was at, thf full; by my account in
the month of October; but as for the exact reck-
oning of days, after I had once lost it, I coujcl
never recover it again; nor had I kept even^tfye
number of years so punctually, as to, be sure that
I was right, though,, «is it proved when I after-
wards examined my(accomit, lft found, I had ke|>t
a J;rue reckoning pf ye^rs. ^ .
.Jtyras no lcsssthftn.eighf/day^I waited for them,
when a strange and \ii\foxe$^en accident intervened,
of ,whiph the like h^ not, j\e$pps, he^en bfard of
in history^ J was fast^slegp* k\iW» J™tch ong
morning, when my man Friday came running in
to me, and called aloud, Master, master, they are
eome, they are come.
I jumped up, and, regardless of danger, I went
out as soon as I could get my clothes on, through
my little grove, which (by the way) was by this
time grown to be a very thick wood; I say, re-
gardless of danger, I went without my arms, which
was not my custom to do; but I was surprised,
when, turning my eyes to the sea, I presently saw
a boat at about a league and a half's distance,
standing in for the shore, with a shoulder of mutton
sail, as they call it, and the wind blowing pretty
fair to bring them in: also I observed presently,
that they did not come from that side which the
shore lay on, but from the southermost end of the
island. Upon this I called Friday in, and bid him
lie close, for these were not the people we looked
for, and that we did not know yet whether they
were friends or enemies.
*In the next place, I went in to fetch my perspec-
tive glass, to see what I could make of them; and
having taken the ladder out, I climbedr up to the
top of the hill, as I used to do when I was appre*
hensive of any thing, and to take my view the
plainer without being discovered.
rhad scarce set my foot on the hill, when my
eye plainly discovered a ship lying at an anchor,
at about two leagues* and a half's distance from
me, S. S. E., but not above a league and a half
from the shttfe. iUy^friy observation it appeared
plainly to be in English isfiip, and the boat apps&red
to be an English long-boat.
#*

I cannot express the confusion I was in, though
the joy of seeing a ship, and one whom I had rea*
son to believe was manned by my own country'*
men, and consequently friends* was such as I can-
not describe,* but yet I had some secret doubts
hung about me, I cannot tell from whence they
came, bidding me keep upon my guard. In the
first place it occurred to me to consider what busi-
ness an English ship could have in that part of the
world; since it was jnot the way to»orfrom any
part of the world where the English hadany traf *
fick; and I knew there had.been.no atorms to drive
them in there, as in distress; and if they were
English really, it was most piKjhable^that they
were here upon no good design; and that I had
better continue as I was, than fall into the hands
of thieves and murderers, j a <. '»
Let no man despise the secret hints and notices
of danger, which sometimes a(re*given him whan
he may think there is no ^possibility of its*being
real. That such bints and notices are> givinous,
I believe few thafc 'have made any observationstof
things >can deny; that thejrare certain discoveries
of an invisible worlds amd a coaversQ.ofrspiritspwe
cannot doubt; and if theMtiendency of>them seems
to be to warn us of dangefc, why should we rnofc
suppose they arejfrom some friendly'.agent (whe-
ther supreme, or inferior and subordinate, is* not
the question), and that they are given for our
good ? >  \ . .
The present question abumdarafly confirms me in
the justice of this ,reaspnihg; for* had I not been
made cautious by this secret admonition, come
m &6%f$$0T€ c&uSOfc. 33!
frornudhenceit will, I had been undone inevitably,
and im a far worse condition $ian before, as you
will see presently.
rl had not kept myself long im this posture, but I
saw^the boat draw near the shore, as if they looked
for a creek to thrust in at for the convenience of
landing; however, as they did not come quite far
mouglyi they did not see the little inlet where I
fcrnterbplandsd^my rafts, but run their boat on
shore upon the beach* kt about half a mile from
inie, whibta>Was^ery happy for me; for otherwise
they)would have? landed just, as I may say, at my
door, and: Wouldnhave soon beaten me out of my
ca«tle,rand, perhaps, harve .plundered me of all I
had. i
^Wihen*they .were on?ishot?e, I was fully satisfied
they were Englishmen, at least most of them; one
m tW0*l£fa>ugdii werarDufcch, but it did not prove
so^i theare iwece in ^all eleven men* whereof three
<&£4keiitf I found were unarmed, and (as I thought)
bound; and when the first four or five of them
^teere jumped^onv shore, they took those three out
©& the* boat as prisoners* One of the three I could
perceive using the most passionate gestures of en-
treaty, i affliction, and? despair, even to a kmd of
exAravagamce; the other* two, I could perceive,
lifted up their hands sometimes, and appeared con*
tecned iadeedy but not to such a degree as the
first. i
I was perfectly confounded at the sight, and
knew nQt^hat the fneaningof it should be. Fri-
day callediobt to me in ^English, as well as hfe could,
8u 3
O master! you §eeJEnglish mans eat prisoners jaai
well as savage mans. Why, said I, Friday, do you
think they are going to eat them then? Yes, says
Friday, they will eat them - No, no, said J, Fri-
day; I am afraid they will murder them indeed;
but you may be sure they will not eaf them.
All this while I had no thought of what the mafc
ter really was, but stood trembling, witlv horror
of the sight, expecting every .moment when the
three prisoners should be killed;.nay,, once I saw
one of the villians lift up his arm with&gi^at <mt->
lace (as the seamep caU it) ovtSWwd>, feMtdkeione
of the poor men; and J expected to seer him fall
every moment, at which all the, bloodin^ray* body
seemed to run chill in my veins,
I wished heartily now fop our, Spaniard, <#nd the
savage that w^s gone with him; 01* that I had >any
way to have comfe undisoovexed within oshoti of
them, that I might fyav^e, rescued the tthf e&r i»en£
for I saw no Alarms they had * among them; but*
it fell out to my n^^.watiheri way.
After I fcad observed^the,outrageous usage of
the three men by the insolent seamen, I obseweti
the, fellows ran scattering 5iabout thei,Und,<*asi if
they* wanted to see th^co,witry. J observed* lalaos
that the three other men, had liberty to^go whene
they pleased; hut they sat tdojwn all three up^n
the grpund very peo^iye* and looked like mefriift
despair.
This put me in mind > of the first time when I
came <pp sho>^,and b^gaA fcoiook abouit me; how
I g^y,e ^lys^^Qivpr^fATnio^M /how .wildly J looked
round ltiei what dreadful ap*prehensibns I had, and
hew I? lodged in the tree all night for fear of being
devoured by wild beasts.
As I knew nothing that night of the supply
hwa® to receivd by the providential driving of
the ship nearer the land, by the storms and tides,
by which I have sinee beeta so long nourished and
supported; so^these three poor desolate men knew
nothing <how dertaiu of deliverance and supply
they we#e; haw near it was to them, and how ef-
fecfcuMly-and realtythey were in a condition of
safety^ iat the <&hme Girlie they thought themselves
I&st, afid their case desperate.
? So lifctle^dolve see before us in the world, and
so much reason have we to depend cheerfully upon
tiler great Mabe?r of! the world, that he does not
l$a*se^his fcreatures so absolutely destitute, but that

Mtwas just at the top of high-water when these
peejple came on shore, and while partly they stood
padyiag with the prisoners they brought, and
partly while they rambled about to see what kind
of place they were in* > they had carelessly staid till
the tide was spent, and the water was ebbed con-
siderably^aw&y>- leaving their boat aground.
They fcA kft tW6 mei*4n the boat, who, a^ I
found afterwards, halving drank a little fo6 futieh
brandy, fell asleep; however, one of them waking
sooner than the other, and finding the boat too
fast aground for him to stir it, hallooed for the
rest who were straggling about, upon which they
all soon came to the boat; but it was past all their
strength to launch her, the boat being ve<ry heavy,
and the shore on that side being a soft oosy sand,
almost like a quicksand.
In this condition, like true se&fcnen, Who are,
perhaps, the least of all mankind given to fore-
thought, they gave it over, and aw&y they strolled
about the country again; and I heard one of them
say aloud to another (calling theniof4 frofri"the
boat), Why let her alone, Jack,' can't ye?> shfe'll
float next tide. By which I wasfutlyconfirnted in
the main inquiry, of what countrymen they were.
All this while I kepfrmyself close, not ^once dat-
ing to stir out of my castle, any further than to
my place of observation, near the top of the hill;
and very glad I was, to thmk how well 4t was^ for-
tified. I knew it was no less than ten hour& be-
fore the boat Could be on float again, and by that
time it would be dark, and I might be more at
liberty to see their motions, and to hear their5 dis-
course^ if they had any.L {
Iti the mean time 1 fitted1 myself up for a battle,
as before, though with mtire caption, knowing I
had to do with andth^r Jkin<i bf enemy than 1 had
at first. I ordered Frida^ also, wh6m I had riiade
aft Excellent marksman With his "gnu, to load him-
self with arms. I took myself two fowling-pieces,
and I gave him three mu£queis;: m^c figure, indeed,
was very fierce* I liadi my forrfttclable goat-skin
coat on, with the great eap FmentToned, a naked
swords two pistols in my belt, and a gun upon
eaeh shoulder.
It was my design, as I said above, not to have
ua&de any attempt till it was dark; but about two
a'clock, being the heat of the day, I found that in
short they were all gone straggling into the woods,
and, as I thought, were all laid down to sleep: the
three poor distressed men* too anxious for their
condition to get any sleep, were however set down
under the .shelter of a great tree, at about a quar-
ter of a mije from me, and, as I thought, out of
sigh t&G-any x>f the rest*
Uponithis I resolved to discover myself to them,
$nd learnrsomething of their condition* Immedi*
atfly I marched in the figure above, my man Fri^
d%y at a, good distance behind .me, as formidable
for his^arms as I, but not making quite so staring
a speqtre-lik§ figure as I did.
I came asf near them undiscovered as I could*
anti then, before any of tliena saw me, I called
alwd to them in Spanish, \Vhat are ye, Gentle-
men.?,  -
They started up at the .noise,* but were ten times
more confounded when they saw me, and the un*
couth figure that I made: >they made no answer
£|t all, but I thought I perceived them just going
to fly from me, when I spoke to them in English*

The poor man with tears running down his face,
and trembling, looking like one astonished; re-
turned, Am I talking to Odd or man? Is it a real
man, or an angel? Be in no fear aboutf that., Sir,

Have they any fire-arms? said I:,jhe answered,
they had only two pieces, and one which they left
iu the boat. Well then, said I, teavq the rest to
me; I see they are all asleep; it is aai easy thing
to kill them all; but shall we rather t^fce them
prisoners? He told me tbe?e were two* desperate
villains among them, that it was scarce safes to
shew any mercy to; but if they were secured, he
believed all the rest would return to their duty.
I asked hi*n# <Which they were? He told me* he
could not at that .distance describe them; but he
would obey my orders m any thing I would direct.
Well, sa*id I, let m /retreat out of their view Or
hearings le$t they, awake, and we will resolve far-
ther; so they willingly went back with me, till
t^e woods OQvered us frpm.Jthem.
Look you, Si*,-.sail! I,jjif I vulture upon your
deliverance, are you* willing to make two condi-
tions with me? He anticipated my proposals, by
telii^g^me* that both he and the shijp, if recovered,
shanld he wholly directed and eomjnanded by me
iiL gvjeiy thitfg; and if *he ship was not recovered,
he would Ike and die with.- me in what part of tbe
world soever I would send* him; and the two other
men said the same-
Well, said I, my conditions ar$ but two; 1.
That while you stay on this island with me, you
will&ot pretend tor any autb^rity here; and if I
put arms into jom hands* you will upon all occar
stans give them up to me, >and d«* no prejudice tor
me or mine,* upon* this- island, and l$x the^ mea»
time to be governed hy&ay orders. i, >
S. That if the ship is, or may be rectarece& #W
2 X
will carry me and my man to England, passage
free.
He gavfe me all the assurance that the invention
and faith of a rimn could devise, that he would
comply with these most reasonable demands; and
besides, would owe his life to me, and acknow-
ledge it upon all occasions as! long as he lived.
Well then, said I, here are three muskets for
you, with powder and ball; tell me'iiext'what you
think is proper to be done: he shewed1 all the tes-
timony of his gratitude thdt he 'Was £bTe;' btit of-
fered to be wholly giiided byme:iTf told him, I
thbught it was hard venttirin^atiy thlirfef biii'the
best method I could think: of, Was "to'*fife upon
them at once, as thfey lay; arid if &ny were not
killed at the first volley, arid' offered to submit,
we might save them, and % ph\x it Whollyupon
God's providence to direct the shot.
He said, very modestly, thfet he was loth to kill
them, if he cotitd help it; bbt'that those tw6 wfere
incorrigible villains7, and had been the atittiors of
all the mutiny in the ship; and if they escaped,
we should be \itidoiie stilli Jfor they wotild go 6ii
hoard; and briiig therwhole sMpVdompaiiy, iatid
destroy us all. Well therf,4aid 1, necessity legiti-
mates my advice; for it4is the only way to save
our lives. However,- sfeemg hltti ^still cautious of
Shedding bloody I tbld him, they fcfro'uld go them-
selves, and ttiari&ge ab thdy ffr&fld! convenient.
In the middle of thi'sc<tfsfc6ufs£ we heard some
£>f them awake, and soon after we saw two of them
6n their feet. I asked hifnjlf 'either of them were
the mtea Who hb had c*said'were the' heads of the
mutiny? He said. No. Well jthep, saidj, you may
let them escape, and Providence seems to have
wakeped them on purpose tQ save themselves:
Npw, s^id I, if the rest espape yo,u, it is your fault.
Animated with this, he took the \musket I had
given him in his Jiand, and pistol in his belt, and
his two comrades wijth him, with each man a piece
in his hand: the two mep, who were with him,
going first, rpade spme noise, &t which one of the

testations of their sihcerity that could be desired;
and he was willing to believe them, and spare their
lives, which I Was n$t against; only I obliged him
to keep them bound h^ndand foot while they weie
upon the island, .* >
While this wa& doiiagv I sen* Friday with the
captain's mate to the boat, with orders to secure
her, and bring away the oars and sail, which they
did; and by and bye, three straggling men, that
were (happily for them) patted from the rest, c&me
back upon hearing the guns fired; and seeing their
captain, who before was itheir>prisoner$ n^ow their
conqueror, they submitted tOi«be bound <also, and
so our victory was complete.
It now remained, that the captain andSI-should
inquire into one another's circumstances* I began
first, and told him my whole history ^whteh he
heard with an attention even to amazement, and
particularly at the wonderful manned of my being
furnished with provisions and ammunition; * ind
indeed, as my story is a whole collection of wbn-
dersr it affected him deeply; hut when he reflected
from thence upon himself, and how I seemed to
I^&ve been preserved there ©n purpose to save his
life, the tears ran do^ai hifc face, and he couWlnot
speak a word more.
After this communication was at ah. end^ I car*
ried him and his two men into my apattimuls,
leading them in just where I came5 out?, *vfe. atffthe
top of the house; whore I refreshed them with
such provisions as I had* and shewed them blithe
contrivances I had made during my long, long in-
habiting that plaice.
* .'AH :3dshe>wed tfeei% ajrldLsaid to them, was per-
fecityamazing; but, #hoM£.8&K the captain admired
imy ^vti&l^km; jandrjtow perfectly I had eon-
*?eapl$d ray retreat with.&|jreve of the trees,, which,
^having now been planted near treaty years, and
Lithe.trees growing much faster than in,England,
was become a< little wood, and so thick, that it
,was unpassable in any part of it, but at that One
> &dG*wbete-1 had reserved my little winding pas-
Amg£ inito. it; this I told him was nay castle^ and
< my^reddence; but that J had a seat in the coun-
try,,^ most prince have, whither I could retreat
f<npwa occasion,, and I jrccaiJdjshew trim that too an-
other time; but at present our business was to
, jemisSd^inhowrt^eeaver the ship. He agreed with
.^oe as tot that; taut* told me,, he was perfectly at a
loss what measurer to take; for that there were
itill $ix*and?twenty hands Qn board, who having
entered jnjto.a cursed compi«5acy, by which they
hadiiall forfeited their lives to the law, would be
Jbardened in it now, by desperation; and would
$mty it amy. knowing that if they were reduced,
they-Sjboidd<i>e brought to the gallows as soon as
tjaey* came to England*, or to any of the English
G$io©ies$ ami that therefore there would be no
attacking them with so small a number as we were.
H mnaeiLfw some: time npon what he had said,
*&wi fo^indi^: .was a^v*ery> rational conclusion^and
that themfom^sonfe thing was jto be resolved on
y®*f speedily, as wfell to draw the men on bmrd
into some (snare for their surprise, as to, present
tb$k landingjuf*m us, and destroying tissrupon
this it presently occurred tame, thatjmalittle
while, the ship's crew, wondering what was be-
come of their comrades^ and of ,the boat, would
certainly come on shore ip. their other boat to see
for them; and that then perhaps they might come
armed, and be too strong for us: this he allowed,
was rational.
Upon this I told him, the first thing we were to
do, was to save the boat, which lay upon the
beach, so that they might not carry her off; and
taking everything out of her, leave her so far use-
less as not to be fit to swim; accordingly, we wei)$
on board, took the arms which ^vere$left oji board
out of her, and whatever else we found(,(th^re,
which was a bottle of brandy, and another pf rum,
a few biscuit cakes, an horn^of po^er,, and a^reat,
great lump of sugar in a piece of canvas; the sugar,,
was five or six pounds; ail which was veny wel-
come to me, especially the brandy aud sugar, pf
which I had had none left fpr many years. r
When we had carried all these things op. shores
(the oars, mast, sail, and rudder of the boat, were
carried before, as above), we knocked a great hole v
in her bottom, that if they had qome strong enough
to master us, yet they could (not carry off the boat.
Indeed it was not much |in my thoughts, th^t
we could be capable to recpver the ship; but my
view was, that if ,jthey weAt^uway, without the
boat, I did n*ot much .qyestjon to makp her fit
again to carry us away to0tl^?Lee\yard Inlands, and
call upqn our friends the$p^i$rd£(hi my way; for
I jha4< them ^ill ^n.ipy {heights, r
While, we; we^e th,u£ prep^ri^g ^i^esigps, and
hadtofe %fjip^n,^]t^ng^b, J^vecJ,»the,t>aat up
upon the belch, so high that the tide would not
float her off at high-Water mirk; and, besides,
had broken an hole'insher bottom, too big ta be
quickly stopped, and wete sat down musing what
we should do, we heard the ship fire a gun, and
saw her make a waft with her ancient, as a signal
for the boat to come on board; but no boat stirred;
and they fired several times, making other signals
for the boat.
At la&t, when all their signals and firings proved
fruitless, and they found the boat did not stir, v/e
saw theth (by thehelp of our glasses) hoist another
bolt out, and row towards the shore; and we
fourid, Is they approached, that there were no less
than ten ihen in her, and that they had fire-arm*
with thfcm.
*&i th£*sh?ip lay almost two leagues from the
stiore,1 Kvb had a full view of them as they came,
and a plain sight of the men, even of their faces;
bed&u'se the ti'deTiaviug set them a little to the east
of 4thfe other boat, they rowed up under shore, to
cOtne to ^the safrfe place whefrfc the other had
lakted; and1 1vhef e ffie %fc>at fey. r
By tliis means, I ^ay, J1we*had a full view of
thfetn, and-the captairi kndW the persons and cha-
racters' of ill thtftfietf hi the boat; of whOm he said
tftat tiiet^^ere^thr^fe Vfery^Wne^t fellows, who,

re^/belii^^ov^ti^efea^aiid f/ighted.
But^hfit^r'tli^^b^tsi^aiti, who, it 5eems> was
the chief officer amtfrig ift&h, aifd'all the rest, they
were as46WC^d«tts%»'atty bf the shipys ere\^; and
were, ri6 dfttfbtpntede desperate 4n theft new eiv
terprize; and terribly apprehensive he was, that
they would be too powerful for us.
I smiled at him, and told him, that men in our
circumstances were past the operations of fear;
that seeing almost every condition that could be
was better than that we were supposed to be in,
we ought to expect that the consequence, whether
death or life, would be sure to be a deliverance. I
asked him, what he thought of the circumstances
of my life, and whether a deliverance Was not Worth
venturing for? And where, Sir, said i, is your be-
lief of my being preserved here on purpose to save
your life, which elevated you a little While ago?
For my part, said I, there seems to be but one
thing amiss in all the prospect of it" What is that?
says he. Why, said I, it is that, as you say, there
are three or four honest fellows among them,
which should be spared; bad they been all of the
wicked part of the crew, I should have thought
God's providence had singled them out to deli*-
ver them into your hands^ for> depend upon it,
every man of them that comes ashore are our own,
and shall die or live, as th$y behave to us, <
As I spoke this* with a raked *roice, and cheer-
ful countenance, I found it greatly encouraged
him; so we set vigorously to our business; we had,
upon the first appearance of ^the boat's comittg
from the ship, considered' of separating our prv-
soners, and had indeed secured them effectually.
Two of them, of whom the captaki was less as-
sured than ordinary, I sent with-Friday,"'akid one
of^the three (delivered meh) to my caver where

of being heai'd or discovered, or of finding their
way out of the woods, if they could have delivered
themselves: here they left them bound, but gave
them provisions, and promised them, if they con-
tinued there quietly, to give them their liberty in
a day or two; but that if they attempted their
esp&pe, they should be put to death without
mercy. They promised faithfully to, bear their con-
finejnent with patience, and were very thankful
th^t they \wd such good usage as to have provi-
sions^ and, a light left tbem; for Fiiday gave them
caries imeh as we ma*de ourselves) for their com-

them were kepfciphupned indeed, because the cap-

^$c$nmendation, and upon their solemnly engaging
tQl Ifeve and die with us; ^sq, with them and the
thr©$,boniest men, we were>seven men well armed;
and I made no doubt we should be able to deal
well enough with the ten that were coining, con-
sidering that the captain had. said, there were three
tot&uf honest men among them also.
n*As> soon a& they got to the place where their
&th§r boat lay, thQy-pwfc their boat into the beach,
a&4 c^pae^il-on shore, hauling the boat up after
then% which I was* glad td see; for I was afraid
they *$qul$ $*the^ have teft the boat at an anehor,
some^d-^staiite^^Q^the^hotej with gome hand$ in
her to guard ^er* a^d ^ we should not-he able to
*eise the boat«* k
2 y
Being on shore, the first thing they did, they
ran all to the other boat; and it was easy to see
they were under a great surprise to find her strip-
ped, as above, of all that was in her, and a great
hole in her bottom-
After they had mused awhile upon this, they
set up two or three grest shouts, hallooing with
all their might, to try if they could make their
companions hear; but all was to no purpose; then
they came all close in a ring, and fifed a volley of
their small arms, which indeed we heard, and the
echoes made the woods ring; but it was all one;
those in the cave, we were sure, could not hear;
and those in our keeping, though they heard it
well enough, yet durst give no answer to them.
They were so astonished at the surprise of this,
that as they told us afterwards, they resolved to
go all on board again to their ship, and let them
know there, that the men were all murdered,
and the long-boat Stated; accordingly, they imme-
diately launched the boat again, and got all Qf
them on board.
The captain was terribly amazed, and even con-
founded at this> believing they would go on board
the ship again, and set sail, giving their comrades
up for lost, and §o he should still lose the ship,
which he* was ift hopes we should h&ve recovered;
but te w&s quickly &4 much frighted the other
way.
They-tead riot been long put off \Hth the boat,
but w&^perceived 'theito all Conliiig on shore again;
but^with this new measure in their conduct,
which, it seems, they consulted together upon, viz.
to leave three men in the boat, and the rest ta go
on shore, and go up into the country to look for
their fellows.
This was a great disappointment to ,us; for now
we were at a loss what to do; for our seizing those
seven men on shore would be no advantage to us
if we let the boat escape, because they would
then row away to the ship; £nd then the rest of
them would be sure to weigh, and set sail, and so
our recovering the ship would be lost.
However, we had no remedy but to wait and see
what the issus of things might present; the seven
men came* an shore, and the three who remained
in the boat put,her off to a good distance from the
shore, and came to an anchor to wait for them; so
that it was impossible for u$ to come at them in
the bo^t.
Those that caine on shore kept close together,,
marching towards the top of the little hill, under
which my habitation lay; and we could see thepi
plainly, though they could not perceive us: we
could have been very glad they woi^ld have comq
nearer to us, so that we might have ftred at them;
pr that they would haye gone farther off, that wc
might have come abroad*
But when they were come to the brow pf the
hill, where they qoidd see a great way in the
vaUey and woods, which lay towards the north-
east part, and where the island lay lowest, th$y
shouted and hallooed till they were weary; and
not caring, it seems, to venture far from the shore*
nor far from one another, they sp,t down together
under a tree, to consider of it: 4ia$ 4&$y thought
2 y 2
fit to have gone to sleep there, as the other party
of them had done, they had done the job for us;
but they were too full of apprehensions of danger,
to venture to go to sleep, though they could not
tell what the danger was they had to fear neither.
The captain made a very just proposal to me
upon this consultation of theirs; viz. that perhaps
they would all fire a volley again, to endeavour
to make their fellows hear, and that we should
all sally upon them, just at the juncture when their
pieces were all discharged, and they would cer-
tainly yield, and we should have them without
bloodshed. I liked the proposal, provided it was
done while we were near enough to come up to
them, before they could load their pieces again.
But this event did not happen, and we lay still
a long time, very irresolute what course to take;
at length I told them, there would be nothing to
be done in my Opinion till night; and then, if they
did not return to the boat, perhaps we might find
a way to get between tliem and the shore, and so
might use some stratagem with them in the boat,
to get them on shore.
We Waited a great while, though very impatient
for their removing, and were very uneasy : when?
after long consultations, we saw them start all up,
and march down toward the sea: it seems, they
had such dreadful apprehensions upon them of the
danger of the place, that they resolved to go on
board the ship again, give their companions over
for lost, and so go on with their intended voyage
with the ship,
As soon as I perceived them go towards the
shore/ I > imagined it to be as it really was* that
they had given over their search, and weie for
going back again; and the captain, as soon as I
told him my thoughts, was ready to sink at the ap-
prehensions of it; but I presently thought of a
Stratagem to fetch them back again, and which
answered my end to a tittle,
I ordered Friday, and the captain's mate, to go
over the little creek westward, towards the place
where the savages came on shore when Friday was
i?escu^d; and as soon as they came to a little rising
gfoittid, at abou>t half a mile's distance, I bade
them halloo as loud as they could, and wait till
th^y found the seamen heard them; that as soon
as ever they heard the seamen answer them, they
should retufrtv it again, and then, keeping out of
sight,0 take'a round, always answering when the
Others hallooedv5to draw them as far into the island,
and aiftong the woods, as possible, and then wheel
about-again to me, by such ways as I directed.
1 They wdre just going into the boat, when Friday
%nd the-mate hallooed* and they presently heard
them, and answering ran along the shore westward
towards 'the voice they heard, when they were
presently stepped by the creek, where, the water
beifrg up, thdy could not get over, and called for
-the boat-to come up^ and set them over, as indeed
XI expected. *
When they had set themselves over, I observed
thatthfe boast being gone up a good way into the
fcreek, and as it were in an harbour within the
land, they took one of the three men out of her to
rgo along iyifh them* and left only two in the boat,
having fastened her to the stump of a little tree
on the shore.
This was what I wished for, and immediately
leaving Friday and the captain's mate to their bu-
siness, I took the rest with me, and, crossing the
creek out of their sight, we surprised the two men
before they were aware, one of them lying on
shore, and the other being in the boat; the* fallow
on shore was between sleeping* and waking, and
going to startup, the captain, who?w$s foremost*
ran in upon him, and knocked hkn.fdown* and
then called out to him in th§,boat to< yiel(J>ror he
was a dead man. ,
There needed very few arguments to persuader
single man to yield, .when he ?aw five imenpuppn
him* and his comrade knocked down*; J^ides^this
was, it seeps, one of the three, $i$t were not^p
hearty in the mutiny a$ thereat of vthe'Crew, ^nd
therefore was easily persuaded nQt <?ply tQjyifld*
but afterwards to join very sincerely >with \i». > * «
In the mean time, Friday and the captain's mate
so well managed their business .with the rest, that,
they drew them, by hallooing and answering, froiai
one hill to another, and from, one wood to another,
till they not only heartily tired them, bjut left them
where they were very sure they could nojt reach
back to the boat before it was dark» pqid indeed
they were heartily tired themselves also by the time
they came back, to us.
We had nothing now ito do -but to watch for
them in the xiark, and to fall upom thetp, so as tp
make sure work with, them. > i >,
It was several hours after liarkfey cam$ back to
me before they came back to their boat; and vre
coulcl hear the foremost of them, long before they
came quite up, calling to those behind to come
along; and could also bear them answer, and com-
plain how lame and tired they were, and not being-
able to come any faster, which was very welcome
news to us.
At length they came up to the boat; but it is
impossible to express their confusion, when they
found' the boat fast a-ground in the creek. The
tide ebbed out, and their two men gone; we could
heat' them call to one another in a most lamenta-
ble manner, telling one another they were gotten
into aiv eiichanted island; that either there were
inhabitants in it, and they should all be murdered;
or else there were devils or spirits in it, and they
should be all carried away and devoured.
They hallooed again, and called their two com-
rades < by* their names a great many times, but no
answer; after some time, we could see them, by
the little light there was, run about wringing their
hands,«like men in despair; and that sometimes
they -would go and sit down in the boat to rest
themselves, 'then come ashore, and walk about
a<g$in, and so* the same thing over again.
My men would fain have had me give them
leave to fall upon • them at once in the dark; but
I was willing to take them at some advantage, so
to spare them, and kill as few of them as I could;
a$d especially I was unwilling to hazard the killing
any of oumaen, kjwwing the other men were very
well armed: I resolved to wait to see if they did
not separate; and therefore, to make sure of them,
I drew my ambuscade nearer; and oidered Friday
and the captain to creep upon their hands and feet
as close to the ground as they could, that they
might not be discovered, and get as near them as
they could possibly, before they offered to fiie.
They had not been long in that posture, till the
boatswain, who was the principal ringleader of the
mutiny, and had now shewn himself the most de-
jected and dispirited of all the rest, came walking
towards them with two more of the crew; the
captain was so eager, at having the principal rogue
so much in his power, that he could hardly have
patience to let him come so near as to be sure of
him; for they only heard his tongue before: but
when they came nearer, the captain and Friday,
starting up on their feet, let fly at them.
The boatswain was killed upon the spot; the
»ext man was shot in the body, and fell just by
hjm, though he did not die till an hour or two
after; and the third ran for it.
At the noise of the fire, I immediately advanced
with my whole army, which was now eight men;
Viz, myself generalissimo; Friday my lieutenant-
general > the captain and his two men, and the
three prisoners of war, whom he had trusted with
arms.
We came upon them indeed in the dark, so that
they could not see our number; and I made the
man they had left in the boat, who was now one
of us, to call them by name, to try if I could bring
them to a parley, and so might perhaps reduce
them to terms; which fell out just as we desired:
for indeed it was easy to think, as their condition
then was, they would be very willing to capitulate;
so he calls out, as loud as he could, to one of them,
Tom Smith, Tom Smith. Tom Smith answered
immediately, Who's that! Robinson! Fot it seems
he knew his voice. The other answered, Ay, ay;
for God's sake, Tom Smith, throw down your arms,
and yield, or you are all dead men this moment.
Who must wc yield to? Where are they? says
Smith again- Here they are, says he: here is our
captain and fifty men with him, have been hunting
yo& this two hours; the bbatswain is killed; Will
Fryeis wouiided, and! am a prisotier; and if you
do not yield, you are all lost.
Will they give usquarter then? says Tom Smith,
and we will yield, I'll go and ask, if you promise
to yield, says Robinson. So he asked the captain,
and the captain himself then calls out; You, Smith,
you know my voice, if you lay down your arms
immediately, and sfnbmit* you shall have your
lives, all but Will Atkfois.
Upon this Will Atkftis cried out, For God's
sake, captain, give me quarter: what have I done?
they have been all as bad as Is: (which by the wa^
was not true, eithetf; for it sieems this Will Atkins
vias the first anan that laid hold of the captain
when they first mutinied, and used him barbarously;
in tying Ms- hands, and giving him injurious lan-
guage:) however, tfoe captain told him he must
lay down his arms at discretion, fcnd trust to the
governor's mdrcy,by which hem^ant me-; for they
all Called me governor-
In a word, they all laid down theft arms, and
2 %
begged their lives; and I sent the man that had
parlied with them, and two more, who bound them
all; and then my great army of fifty men, which,
particularly with those three, were all but eight,
came up and seized upon them all, and upon their
boat, only that I kept myself and one more out of
sight, for reasons of state.
Our next work was to repair the boat, and to
think of seizing the ship; and as for the captain,
now he had leisure to parley with them, he expos-
tulated with them upon the villany of their prac-
tices with him, and at length, upon the further
wickedness of their design; and how certainly it
must bring them to misery and distress in the end,
and perhaps to the gallows.
They all appeared very penitent, and begged
hard for their lives. As for that, he told them they
were none of his prisoners, but the commander's
of the island; that they thought they had set him
on shore in a barren uninhabited island; but it
had pleased God so to direct them, that the island
Was inhabited, and that the governor was an En-
glishman; that he might hang them all there, if
he pleased; but as he had given them all quarter,
he apposed he would send them to England, to
be dealt with there as justice required, except^At-
kms, whom he was commanded by the governor
to advise to prepare for death; for that he would
-beiiaftged in the morning*
Though this was all a fiction of his own, yet it
had its desired effect: Atkins fell upon his knees
ito^beg the captain to intercede with the governor
for his life; and all the rest begged of him for
God's sake, that they might not be sent to
England.
It now occurred to me, that the time of our de-
liverance was come, and that it would be a most
easy thing to bring these fellows in to be hearty
in getting possession of the ship; so I retired in
the dark from them, that they might not see what
kind of a governor they had, and called the cap-
tain to me; when I called, as at a good distance,
one of the men was ordered to speak again, and
say to the captain, Captain, the commander calls
for you; and presently the captain replied, Tell
his excellency I am just a coming. This more
perfectly amused them; and they all believed, that
the commander was just by with his fifty men.
Upon the captain's coming to me, I told him
my project for seizing the ship, which he liked
wonderfully well, and resolved to put it in execu-
tion the next morning.
But, in order to execute it with more art, and
to be secure of success, I told him we must divide
the prisoners, and that he should go and take At-
kins, and two more of the worst of them, and send
them pinioned to the cave where the others lay:
this was committed to Friday, and the two men
who came on shore with the captain.
They conveyed them to the cave, as to a prison;
and it was indeed a dismal place, especially to men
in their condition.
The others I ordered to my bower, as I called
it, of which I have given a full description; and
as it was fenced in, and they pinioned, the place
z 2
was secure enough, considering they werfe upon
their behaviour.
To these in the morning I sent the captain, who
was to enter into a parley with them; in a word,
to try them, and tell me, whether he thought they
might be trusted or no, to go on board, and sur-
prise the ship: he talked to them of the injury
done him, of the condition they were brought to;
and that though the governor had given them
quarter for their lives as to the present action, yet
that if they were sent to England, they would all
be hanged in chains, to be sure; but that if they
would join in such an attempt, as to recover the
ship, he would have the governor's engagement
for their pardon.
Any one may guess how readily such a proposal
Would be accepted by men in their condition; they
fell down on their knees to the captain, and pro-
mised with the deepest imprecations, that they
would be faithful to him to the last drop, and that
they should owe their lives to him, and would go
with him all over the world; that they would own
him for a father to them as long as they lived.
Well, says the captain, I must go and tell the
governor what you say, and see what I can do to
bring him to consent to it: so he brought me an
account of the temper he found them in, and that
he verily believed they would be faithful.
However, that we might be very secure, I told
him he should go back again, and choose out five
of them, and tell them, that they should see that
they did not want men; but he would take out
those five to be his assistants, and that the gover-
nor would keep the other two, and the three that
were sent prisoners to the castle, (my cave) as hos-
tages, for the fidelity of those five; and that if
they proved unfaithful in the execution, the
five hostages should be hanged in chains alive
upon the shore.
This looked severe, and convinced them that the
governor was in earnest; however, they had no
way left them but to accept it; and it was now
the business of the prisoners, as much as of the
captain, to persuade the other five to do their
duty.
Our strength was now thus ordered for the ex-
pedition* 1. The captain, his mate, and passenger.
2. Then the two prisoners of the first gangv to
whom, having their characters from the captain, I
bad given their liberty, and trusted them with
arms* 3. The othfer two whom I kept till now in
nay bower pinioned * but, upon the captain's "mo-
tion, had now released. 4. These five released at
last; so that they were twelve m all, besides five
we kept prisoners' in the cavte for hostages,
I asked the captain if he wak willing to venture
with these'hands onboard the ship: fory ate'farme
and my man Friday r I did not think it was prober
for u& to stir, having seven men lefti betitnd;'aiid
it was employment enough fbr us to keep them
asunder, and supply them- with victuals*
. As to the five in the ca^e, I Resolved to keep
thfom^fast; but5 Friday went? twice' a day to ti&tii,.
to suppfy them with necessaries^ and I m&tifc tile
other two carry provisions to a fc^rtfrbr dist&fiEe,*
where Friday was to take it.
When I shewed myself to the two hostages, it
was with the captain, who told them, I was the
person the governor had ordered to look after
them, and that it was the governor's pleasure that
they should not stir any where but by my direc-
tion; that if they did, they should beTetched into
the castle, and be laid in irons; so that as we never
suffered them to see me as governor, so I now
appeared as another person, and spoke of the go-
vernor, the garrison, the castle, and the like, upon
all occasions.
The captain now had no difficulty before him,
hut to furnish his two boats, stop the breach of
one, and man them: he made his passenger cap-
tain of one, with four other men; and himself, and
his mate, and five more, went in the other; and
they contrived their business very well; for they
came up to the shipi about midnight As soon as
they came within call of the ship, he made Robin-
son hail them, and tell them he had brought off
the men and the boat, but that it was a long time
before they had found them, and the like; holding
them in a chat, till they came to the ship's side;
when the captain and the mate, entering first .with
their arms, immediately knocked down the second
mate and carpenter with the but end of their tnus-
quets, being very faithfully seconded by their men;
they secured all the rest that were upon the main
and quarter-decks, and began to fasten the hatches
to keep them down who were below, when the
other boat, and their men, entering at the fore-
chains, secured the forecastle of the ship, and the
skuttle" which went down into the cook-room,
making three men they fouad there prisoners.
When this was done, and all saf$ u>pon the deck,
the captain ordered the mate with three men to
break into the round house, where the new rebel
captain lay, and, having taken the alarm, was gat-
ten up, and with two men and a boy h^d gottep
fire-arms in their ih^ds; and when the mate with
a crow split open the door, the- ne\p captain apd
i»is men fired boldly among them, and wounded
the mate with a mupquet ball, which broke his
arm, and wounded t two more of the m$ih hat
killed nobody.
The mate, calling fof help, rushed, }1$&\veverT
into the round-house, wounded as ,he.was, -and
-with his pistol shot the m§w captain through ^he
ibead,ithe bullets entering ]at,hi$ mouth, quid-came
out again behind one of ,his^rs; sa thai* he pever
spofee<<a word; ?up^jf> which ,tljie,rest yielded, and
the^shipwas taken effectualy>{*without ajuy more
liy^s being lost*
t, As soon as the ship v^as thus secured, the captain
ordered seven guns to be fired, which was the* sig-
nal agreed \ipfon with me, $o <givejme notice of his
success ;< which you may the sure I tyfts.very glad
to»hear, having, sat *ygt<?hii}g upofttthe shore for
it till nq$ir two; of the clock in th$ morning.
* » ,JH["&ving thus heavd the signal plainly, I lakl me
jfewjH and it havipg been a day-of .great fai;igure
to me, I slept very sound, till I was something $ur>-
prised with the.aojysQqof & gjun;J3fid pte^eptly
starting up, J feeafcL a> wan, call^ipe by the^nai^e
of Governor, governor; and presently I knew
the captain's* voice, when climbing up to the top
of the hill, there he stood, and pointing to the ship,
he embraced me in his arms. My dear friend
and deliverer, says he, there is your ship, for she
is all your's, and so are we, and all that belong to
her. I cast my eyes to the ship, and there she
rode within d little nltfre than half a mile of the
shor£;'for th&y'h&d* weighed her anchor as soon
as they were masters of he?; and the weather be-
ing fair, had brought her to an anchor jusH against
the ulotith of a little creek; and the tide being up>
the captain had brought the pinnace in near the
place W&ere I first landed ihy rafts, and so landed
ju^t at'itty door. !>>!> !
] {1 W&&, £t first, ready to sink down with the sur-
prise; for I saw my deliverance indeed visibly put
into my hands, all thing^ easy, and a' large ship
juist rfc&dy to ctfrry^taieaWay whither I pleased to
go. At first,r for softie tim£, I was not able to answer
one word; but as he had taken me in his arms,
I held fast by him, or I should have fallen to the
ground.
He perceived the sutprise, and immediately
pulled a bottle 'out of- His^O'ckct, and gave me a
dram of cordial, Which lte'had brought on purpose
for me. After I drank it, I sat down upon the
grotmd, and though it brought me to myself, yet
it was a good while before I could speak a worii
to him.
All this while the poor'mail was in as great an
ecstasy as I, only not under any sui'pris£, as I
was; and he said a thousand kind tender things
to me, to compose and bring me to myself; but
such was the flood of joy in my breast, that it put
all my spirits into confusion; at last it broke into
tears, and in a little while after I recovered my
speech.
Then I took my turn and embraced him as my
deliverer, and we rejoiced together. I told him,
I looked upon him as a man sent from Heaven to
deliver me, and that the whole transaction seemed
to be a chain? of wonders; that such things as
these were the testimonies we had of a secret hand
of Providence governing the world, and an evi-
dence, that the eyes of an infinite power could
search into the remotest corner of the worldy and
send help to the miserable whenever he pleased.
I forgot not to lift up my heart in. thankfulness-
to Heaven; and what heart could forbear to* bless
Him, who had not only in a miraculous- manner
provided for one in such a wilderness, and in such
a desolate condition^ but from whom every deli-
verance must always be acknowledged to pro>-
ceed!
When we had talked a while, the captain told
me, he had brought me some little refreshments,
such a& the ship afforded, and such as the wretches,
who had been so long his masters, had not plun-
dered him oft upon this he called aloud to the boat,
and bids his men bring the things ashore that were
for the governor; and indeed it was a present, as^
if I had been oner not that I was to be carried
along with them, but as if I had been to dwell
upon the island still, and they were to go without
me.
3 A
First, he had brought me a case of bottles full
of excellent cordial waters, six large bottles of
Madeira wine; the bottles held two quarts a piece;
two pounds of excellent good tobacco, twelve
good pieces of the ship's beef, and six pieces of
pork, with a bag of peas, .and about an hundred
weight of biscuit.
He brought me also a box of sugar, a box of
flour, a bag full of lemons, and two bottles of
lime-juice, and abundance of other things: but be-
sides these, and what was a thousand times more
useful to me, he brought me six clean new shirts,
six very good neckcloths, two pair of gloves, one
pair of shoes, an hat, and one pair of stockings,
and a very good suit of clothes of his own, which
had been worn but very little: in a word, he
•clothed me from head to foot.
It was a very kind and agreeable present, as any
one may imagine, to one in my circumstances;
but never was any thing in the world of that kind
so unpleasant, awkward, and uneasy, as it was to
me to wear such clothes at their first putting on.
After these ceremonies passed, and after alt his
good things were brought into my little apart-
ment, we began to consult what was to be done
with the prisoners we had; for it was worth con-
sidering whether we might venture to take them
away with us or no, especially two of them, whom
we knew to be incorrigible and refractory to the
last degree; and the captain said, he knew they
were such rogues, that there was no obliging
them; and if he did carry them away it must be
in irons, as malefactors, to be delivered over to
justice at the first English colony he could come
at; and I found that the captain himself was very
anxious about it.
Upon this, I told him, that if he desired it, I
durst undertake to bring the two men he spoke of,
to make it their own request that he should leave
them upon the island. I should be very glad of
that, says the captain, with all my heart.
^ell, said I, I will send for them, and talk with
thiHi for you: so I caused Friday and the two-
hostages^ for they were now discharged, their
comrades having performed their promise; I say,
I caused them to-go to the cave, and bring up the
five men, pinioned as they were, to the bower, and
fceep them there till I came.
After some time, I came thither dressed in* my
new habit, and now I was called governor again.
Being all met, and the captain with me, I caused
the men to be brought before me, and I told them,
I had had a full account of their villainous beha-
viour to the captain, and how they had run away
with the ship, and were preparing to commit fur-
ther robberies; but that Providence had ensnared
them in their own ways, and that they were fallen
into the pit which they had.digged for others*
I let them know, that by my direction: the ship
had been seized,, that she lay now ki the road, and
they might see by and by, that their newj^aptain
had received the reward of his villany; for that
they might see him hanging at the yard-arm.
That as to them, I wanted to know what they
had tasay^ why I should not execute them as pi
3 a %
rates taken in the fact, as by my commission they
could not doubt I had authority to do.
v One of them answered m the name of the rest,
that they had nothing to say but this, That when
they were taken, the captain promised them thek
lives, and they humbly implored my mercy; but I
told them I knew not what mercy to shew them;
for, as for myself, I had Resolved to quit the island
with all my men, and had taken passage with the
captain to go for England: and as for the captain,
he could not catry them to England, other than
as prisoners in irons to be tried for mutiny, and
running away with the ship; the consequence of
which, they must needs know, would be the gal-
lows; so that I could not tell Which Was best for
them, unless they had a mind to take their fate in
the island: if they desired that, I did not care, as
I had liberty to leave it; I had some inclination
to give them their lives, if they thought they
cdtild shift ©n shore.' They seemed very thank-
ful for it; said they would much rather venture
to stay there, than to be carried to England to be
hanged; so I left it on that issue.
However, the captain seemed to make some
difficulty of it, as if he dutst not leave them there:
upon this I seemed to be a little angry with the
fcaptain, and told him, that they were my prisoners,
not his; and that seeing I had offered them so
mudh favour, I would be as good as my word;
and that if he did not think fit to consent to it, I
would set them at liberty as I found them; and if
he did not like that, he might<take them again, if
he could catch them.
Upon this they appeared very thankful, and I
accordingly set them at liberty, and bade them
retire into the woods, to the place whence they
caitfe, and I woi^ld leave them some fire-arms,
some ammunition, and some directions how they
should live very well, if they thought fit.
Upon this, I prepared to go on board the ship;
but told the captain, that I would stay that night
to prepare my things; and desired him to go on
board'in the mean time, and keep all right in the
ship* and send th& boat on shore the next day for
me; ordering him, in the mean time, to cause the
ftew captain who was killed, to be hanged at the
yardtarm^ that these men might see him.
i When the captain was gone, I sent for the met*
up to, me to my apartment, and entered seriously
into discourse with them of their circumstances.
I told them, I thought they had made a right
chpics; that if the oaptain carried them away,
thqy would certainly be hatiged. I shewed them
their, captain hanging at .the yard-arm of the ship,
and jtold them they had nothing less to expect.
When they had all declared their willingness to
stay, I then told them, I would let them into the
story of my iivitog t<htife» and put them into the
way of making .it easy to them: accordingly I gave
them the whole history of the place, and of my
-CQraing to >itj shewed them my fortifications, the
w$y I made! my bread, planted my corn, cured my
gntpes} m<i% in a word, all that was necessary to
make tfem easy. J told them*the staey of sthe
sisteeii Sjpaniards that were to be exj>ectjed; for
whom I left a letter, and made them promise to
treat th^m in common with themselves.
I left them my fire-arms; viz. five musquets,
three fowling-pieces^ and three swords. I had
about a barrel ©f powder left; for after the first
year or two I used but little, and wasted none. I
gave them a description of the way I managed the
goats, and directions to milk and fatten them, to
make both butter and cheese.
In a word, I gave them every part of my own
story; and I told them, I would prevail with the
captain to leave them two barrels of gunpowder
more, and some garden-seed, which I told them I
would have been very glad of; also I gave1 them
the bag of peats which the? captain had brought me
to eat> and bade'them.be sure to sow and increase
them. l
Having done all this, I left them the next day,
ai*4 went on boardtthe<$kipr. we prepaied imme-
diately to sail, but did not Weigh that night. The
next morning early, two^ofr the five men came
swimming to th^ ship's side| and making a most
lamentable complaint of the other three, begged
to be taken into the* ship* f<^ Good's sake, for they
should be tpurdered; ^and begged the captain to
tak£ then* onboard, though he hanged them inime*
diately.
Upon this the calptain pretended to- have no
power without m&i but after some difficulty, and*
after their? solemn promises jof amendment, they
were taken on jboard, and W;ei;e some time after
soundly whipped> and- piokled; affter wihicli they
proved very honest and quiet/feltewa.
Some time after this, I went with the boat on
shore, the tide being up, with the things promised
to the men, to which the captain, at my interces-
sion, caused their chests and clothes to be added,
which they took, and were very thankful for. I
also encouraged them, by telling them, that if it
lay in my way to send a vessel to take them in, I
would not forget them.
When i took leave of this island, I carried on
board for reliques the great goat's skin cap I had
made, my umbrella, and one of my parrots; also I
forgot not to take the money I formerly mention-
ed, which had lain by me sa long useless that it
was growp rusty, for tarnished, and could hardly
pass for silver, till it had been a little rubbed and
handled; and also the money I found in the wreck
of the Spanish ship.
And thus I left the island the nineteenth of De*
cember, as I found by the ship*s account, in the
year 1686, after I 4^d been upon it eight and
twenty years, two months, and nineteen days;
being delivered from the second captivity the same
day of the month that I * fire! made my escape in
the Barco-longo, from among the Moors of Sallee.
In this vessel, affcep a long voyage, I arrived in
England the eleventh ofLJune, in the year 1687,
having been thirty and five years absent.
When I came to England, I was a perfect
stranger to all the world, as if I had never been
known tJjjere: mydbenefactor, and faithful steward,
whom I had left in trust with my money, was
alive but had had great misfortunes in the world,
was become a widow the second tim£, and very low
m the world. I made her easy as to what she
she owed me, assuring her, I would give her no
trouble; but on the contrary, in gratitude to her for-
mer care and faithflilnes to me, I relieved her als
my little stock would afford, which at that time
would indeed allow me to do but little for her:
but I assured her, I would never forget her for-
mer kindness to me; nor did I forget he?, when
I had sufficient to help her; as shall be observed
in its place.
I went down afterwards into Yorkshire; but
my father was dead, and my mother, and all the
family extinct; except that I forund two sisters,
and two of the children of dne of my brothers:
and as I had been long ag6 given over fb'r dead,
there had been no provision lttacle for me, so that,
in a word, I found nothing to relieve or assist me;
and that little money I had, would not do so much
for me as to settling in: the worldl
I met with one piece of gfatitu'de, indeed, which
I did not expect; and this*was, that the master of
the ship, whom I had so happily delivered, and by
the same means saved the ship and cargo, having
given a very handsoirie Account to the owners, of
the manner how I had'saved rthe lives of the men;
and the ship, they invited me to meet them, ind
some other merchants concerned, and all together
made me a very handsome compliment upon that
subject, and a present of almost' two hundred
pounds sterling. j • *
But after making several reflections upon the
circumstances of my life, and ho# little way this
Would go towards settling me in the World, I re-
salved to go to Lisbon, and see if I might not
come by some information of the state of my plan-
tation in the Brasils, and what was become of my
partner, who, I had reason to suppose, had some
years now given me over for dead.
t With this view I took shipping for Lisbon,
where I arrived in April following; my man Fri-
day accompanying me very honestly in all these
ramblings, and proving a most faithful servant
upon all occasions.
When I came to Lisbon, I found out, by in-
quiry, , and to my particular satisfaction, my old
friend, the .captain of the ship, who first took me
up at sea, off the shore of Africa: he was now
grown old, and had left off tii£ sea, having put hi*
son, who was far from a jgouing man, into his ship;
and who still used the BmsiL tirade. The old mam
did no£ know me, and, iqdeed, I hardly kn^w him;
but I soon brought myself, to liis> remembrance,
when I told him who I was. T ,
After some passionate expressions of our old ac-
quainj#npe* I inquired* yQuTraay be suje, after my
plantation^ an4 my partner. tTh$ o|d man told me,
he had qotjt&eep. jr* $ie4 Br^ite for about; nine

I never came to &fa>m *it,,pne third to, the King,
370 LltfE AtfD AfcVfeNTUItES
and two-thirds to the monastery of St. Augustine,
to be expended for the benefit of the poOr, and for
the conversion of the Indians to the CathOlifc faith;
but that if I appeared, or any one for ttie, to claim
the inheritance, it Would be restored; ohly that
the improvement, or atlnual production, being dis-
tributed to charitable usea, c6Uld nbt be restored;
but he assured me, that the steward of the king's
revenue (from lands) and the proveddre, of steward
of the monastery, had taken great car&all along,
that the incumbent, that id to say, Jnfy pdHfrifcf,
gave every year a faithful a&count of the |froifece,
of which they received duly niy ftiOiety. ' -
I asked him, if he knew to What height of-im-
provement he had brought the pldtltdtidil': and
whether he thought it ftiight be Worth* hkfbfihg
after; or whether, 6n niy goingillithdf;nI should
meet with no obstruction to my possessing Iny jtiSt
right in the irioiety. { ,f
He told m£, he eotild ftot tdl'efcactty*to ^Mt
degree the plantation wafc ifaprotetf; bttt this'he
knew, that my partner was-growing ex066Hifrg
rich upon the enjoying but one Itelf of it! dftd
that, to the best of his r^irierrfbtanee, he had hfeaf d,
that the king's third of my part, Whfeh WaJ, it
seeitis, granted away to softie other motoaatery, t>r
religious house, amounted td above two hundred
moidores a year; that, as to my being restored to
a quiet possession of it, there was fio questioh fto
be made of that, my partner beirig alrve to Witness
rtiy title, and my name beihg alio inrolled in the
register of the country. Also he told tee, that
the survivors of my two trustees* were ve?$ fhit.
kpx\e$% p#Ppte, an4 very wealthy, and he believed
I woijld £pt only have their assistance for putting
i#e in possession, but would find a very conside-
j^le sujii of money iu their hands for my account,
being the produce of the farm, while their fathers
.frgld the trust, a#d bjefore it was given up, as above,
which, as he remembered, was about twelve years.
I shewed myself a little concerned and uneasy
#t tl?fs accost, and inquired of the old captain,
hgyr Ik c^ie tp pass, that the trustees should thus
disypo&e <?f n?y effects, when he knew that I had
Wfteh jpay will, a#fl Jia4 m?4^ him, the Portuguese
captain, njy n&ivGr§al h$ir, §tc>
H§ %<$& me, tliat was true; but that, as there
was no prppf of lpy being dead» he could not act
^s^x^cu^tpr, yufcUt some certain account should come
pf i$y $eatb; sa^d^hatj besides, he was not willing
49 ijut£rn^44te .with a |&ng so remote: that it
was tri^e, he had registered my will, and put in

j^o (sq t^ey <?411q4 the sug&r-house) and had given
Jta^sp^, who w$s ^ow #t the Brasils, order to do it.
J$}4> /(s^ys the old m^n) I have pne piece of
;aews to tell you* which pe^h^ps may not be so
jiqciepj#ye to you as the pest; and tjaat is, that
beUeving you were lost, and all the world believ-
ing, SQ a^o, your partner and trustees did offer to
PGQOupf to p§ in yp^r jiappe, for six or eight of
.the fiyst jyea,ss of pro^t, whic,h I received; bjut
jthere being at $iat £ime, says he, great disburse-
ments for i^cr^asing the works, building an inge-
3B 2
nio, and buying slaves, it did not amount to near
so much as afterwards it produced: however, says
the old man, I shall give you a true account of
what I have received in all, and how I have dis-
posed of it.
After a few days further conference with this
ancient friend, he brought me an account of the
six first years income of my plantation, signed by
my partner, and the merchant's trustees, being
always delivered in goods; viz. tobacco in roll,
and sugar in chests, besides rum, molasses, &q.
which is the consequence of a sugar-work; and I
found by this account, that every year the income
considerably increased: but, as above, the disburse-
ment being large, the sum at first was small: how-
ever, the old man let me see, that he was debtor
to me 470 moidores of gold, besides 60 chests of
sugar, and 15 double rolls of tobacco, which were
lost in his ship, he having been shipwrecked com-
ing home to Lisbon, about eleven years after my
leaving the place*
The good man then began to complain of, his
misfortunes, and how he had been obliged to make
use of my money to, recover his losses, and buy
him a share in a new ship 5 However, my .old friend,
says he, You shall not,want a supply in your ne-
cessity; and as soon as my son returns, you shall
be fully satisfied. « »
Upon this he pulls out an old pouch, and gives
me two hundred Portugal mmdores in gold; and
giving me the writings of his title to the ship
which his son was gone to the Brails in, of which
he was a quarter part owner, $n4 his son another.
he put them both in my hands for security of the
rest.
f I Was too much mov£d with the honesty and
kindness of the poor man, to be able to bear this;
and remembering what he had done for me, how
he had taken me up at sea, and how generously
he had used me on all occasions, and particularly
how sincere a friend he was now to me, I could
hardly refrain weeping at what he said to me.
Therefore, first I asked him if his circumstances
admitted him to spare so much money at that
time, and if it would not straiten him? He told
trie he could not say but it might straiten him a
little; but, however, it \^as my money, and I might
want it more than he.
> "Every thitig the good man said was full of af-
fection, arid I could hardly refrain from tears while
he* spoke. ' In short, I took one hundred of the
moid6re3, dnd called fbr!a pen and ink to give him
a^rebe^t for them; then I returned him the rest,
and told him, if ever I had possession of the plan-
tation, I would returfi^the other to him also, as
indeed I afterwards did: and that, as to the bill
Wtote of hrs" part in his sbn*s ship, I would not
taikfc it hy any means; but that if I wanted the
tfroiiey, I found he wis honest enough to pay me;
Undif I did not, but canfe to receive what he gave
me reason to expect, I would never have a penny
tnorve ftbm hfrh. ? >
Wlien^this wfcs p&^fed, the old man began to ask
me if he should' p'ut n*ie in a method to make my
claim to my pfant&ttoftt I'told him, I thbtight to
go over to it tiiyself, Hefraid, I bright do so if I
pleased; but that if I did not, there were Ways
enough to secure my right, and immediately to
appropriate the profits to my use; and as there
were ships in the river of Lisbon, just ready to go
away to Brasil, he made me enter my name in a
public register, with his affidavit, affirming upon
oath that I was alive, and that I was the same per-
son who took up the land for the planting the said
plantation at first.
This being regularly attested by a notary, $nd a
procuration affixed, he directed me to send it with
a letter of his writing, to a merchant of his ac-
quaintance at the place; and then proposed my
staying with him till an afccdunt came of the
return.
Never any thing was more honourable than the
proceedings upon this procuration; for in less than
seven months I received a large packet from the
survivors of my trustees, the merchants, on whose
account I went to sea, in whieh Werfc the following
particular letters and papers enclosed.
First, There was the account current of the pro-
duce of my farm, or plantation, from the year when
their fathers had balanced with my old Portugal
captain, being for six years; the balance appeared
to be 1174 moidores in my favour.
Secondly, There was the account of four years
more while they kept the effects in their hands,
before the government claimed the administration,
as being the effects of a person not to be found,
which they call Civil Death; and the balance of
this, the value of the plantation increasing, amounted
to cruisadoes, which made 3241 moidores.
Thirdly, There was the prior of the Augustines
account, who had received the profits for above
fourteen years; but not being able to account for
what was disposed to the hospital, very honestly
declared he had 872 moidores not distributed, which
he acknowledged to ray account. As to the king's
part, that refunded nothing.
There was also a letter of my partner's, congra-
tulating 'me very affectionately upon my being
alive; giving me an account how the estate was
improved, and what it produced a year, with a par-
ticular of the number of squares, or acres, that it
contained; how planted, how many slaves theie
were uponit; and, making two and twenty crosses
for blessings, told me he had said so many Ave
Marias to thank the blessedVirgin that I was alive,
inviting me very passionately to come over and
take possession of my own* and in the mean time
to give him orders to whom he should deliver my
effects, if 1 did not came myself; concluding with
an hearty tender of his .friendship, and that of his
family; and sent me, as a present, seven fine Jeo-
pards skins, which he had, it seems, received from
Africa by some other ship which* be had sent thi-
ther, and who, it seems, had made a better voyage
than I. He sent me also five chests of excellent
sweetmeats* and an hundred pieces of gold un-
coined, not quite so largeas moidojm
By the same fleet my mecchant-trustees shipped
mt 1S00 chests of sugar, 800 rolls *of tobacco, and
the rest pf the whole account in gold,
I might welt say now, indeed, that the latter
cud of Jab was fetter ikm the b^ginnwjg* Jt is
impossible to express the flutterings of my v6ry
heart, when I looked over these letters, and espe*-
cially when I found all my wealth about me; for
as the Brasil ships caiAe all'in€eets, the same ships
which brought rtiy letters brought my^ goods; and
the effects were safe in^the Tagus before the letter
came to my hand. In a word^ I turned pale, and
grew sick; tod had not the old mad raa, a^id
fetched me a coidial, I!believe the sudden surprise
of joy hid overset nature, arid I had died tipbn the
spot.
Nay, after that} I continuedaveiy iH^and #as
jto'sonie hours, till aphystefei^bteirig sentfer^and
&>flhethmg of lthfe real 6ause^f ray* iHi^es& being
known, he ordered me to be let blood, after^which
I h&d relief* aftd grevrweli$ but I verily believe,
if it had not been*eased by thb venfcg^nJirthat
manner to thd spirits} I*sfooi|ild have died.,.
1 was now m'aster ail on a suddeivdfi ajtove
#50,000 sterling intfttoney, and had an. estate,- as J
might welt call 4t, in the Brasrls, of above a thou^
-s4nd pdundfr a ydar, ®s sure as an estate o£ lands
in En'gland; and in a wordy I was in a condition
whitfh'I scarce knew* how to ^understand, or haw
t6 cbmpose myself fonthe enjoyment of.
The first thing.! did was ta recompense my^ori-
g*ihal benefactor, my good old;captain whp had
be'en first charitable t© me ia v\ry distress, kind to
fri&'m the fetegiiini^g, and honest to me at the end.
I shewed him all that (was s#nt me; J told him thafe
next to the providence of Heaven, which dispqses
aTl things, it was owing to iiim^andnthat it now
lay&n'W to regard :lmxi£ w&idkitwould do,ta?»
hundred fold. So I first returned to him the hun-
dred moidores I had received of him; then I sent
fer a notary, and caused him to draw up a general
please *or discharge for this 470 moidores, which he
faad acknowledge he owed me, in the fullest and
.firmest manns* po^ible; after which I caused a
procuration to be dr*wn, empowering him to bf
my receiver of the annual profits of my plantation,
aad ^pointing*?ny partner to account to him, and
make *he wtuciis by fee usnai fleet* to him in my
name; and a clause in the end, beiug a grant of
im m^ones^y^ar to him^dnring hi* life, out of
tfeje+eifeetsi and fifty i»i<4dOT$s a year to his son
a$er <hi*% fo*v his life. And ihn* I requited iiny
old man.
I,was ww to consider wJbich way to steer ,my
co^rsenexfe and wtoto d9^ith t^e estate that
JProvid#ttae>had thus put^nto^ny jhpnds; and, in-
deed Iliad more oare*npon my bsad now«fchan I
had in my siknt state.of life in th^ island, where I
waited noting hut what >I jh&d> find tad nothing
&u**wh&t I wwited; wkeareas I &ad npwa great
charge up®n mq, and tey fewness was how to se-
.eu« it. I had wver a<cave to bide my snQneyin,
«r a place where it-wgbhlie without iock or key>
till it.grew mouldy and tarnished before any b<?dy
would meddle with it ^©n the cjontraiy, I knew
not where-to *put it, m whom to trust with (it; my
old patec»% the captain* .'indeed, was 4xon#st, and
that wa& tke.only uefuge I &ad.
In the mmt *pia©e, *ny interest in the ®ras$s
seemed to summon me thither; but jiw I could* not
*$11 tow to JhMiiAf going thithejr J&X& had set-
3 C
tied my affairs, and left my effects in some safe
hands behind me. At first I thought of my aid
frifehd the widow, who, I knew, was honest, and
would be just to me; but then she was ifi years,
and but poor, and, for aught I knew, might be in
debt; so that, in a word, I had no way but to go
back to England myself, and take my effects with
me. f
I was some months, howfever, before I resolved
upon this; and therefore as I had rewarded the old
captain fully, ahd to satisfaction/ who°had ftben
my former benefactor, so F began to<%hink 6f my
£oor widow, whose husbaftd had befeh my first be-
nefactor, and she, while it was in her poWer; rtiy
faithful steward and instructor.l So the first thing
I did, I got a merchant in Lisbonl to ^rite 'tcJ his
correspondent in London, ndt oftly to pky i> bill,
but to go find her out, and ckrry her in itiotiey an
hundred pounds ftorii me, a*nd to talk ^th her,
ahd comfort her irih^'pdVerty, by tellitfg hW she
should, if I liVed, h&ve a*further siipply. 'At the
same time! sent my two sisters'ih-the country,
each of them an hundred pounds, they being,
though not in want, yet not in viery good circum-
stances; one havitig been ih&rrie'd, ahd' left a wi-
dow;'and the other hkving an1 husband riot so
liind to her as he should be. u* { '
But among all riiy relations or acquaintance's, I
Could not yet pitcir upftn bne to whom iVlurst com-
itiit the gross of my stock, that I might go away to
the Braisils, and leave thitigi^ safe behind me; and
this greatly perplexed rtie. " ' -
I had once a mind to have gone to the Brasite.
and hav(e settled myself there, for I was, as it were,
naturalized to the place; but I had some little
scruple in my mind about religion, which insensi-
bly drew me back, of which I shall say more pre-
sently. However, it was not religion that kept
me from goipg thither for the present; and as I
had made no scruple of being openly of the religion
of the country, all the while I was among them,
so neither did I yet; only that now and then hav-
ing of Mte thought more of it than formerly, when
Ihegan to$ think, of Jiving and dying among them, I
fyegau ta regret my Jmving professed myself a Pa-
p^sity a#d thought \t might not be the best religion
tordie in?
But, as I have said, this was not the main thing
tha^kept me from going to the Brasils, but that
really I did not kna^ with whom to leave my ef-
fects, bqhind m©; so I r^olved at last to go to En-
gland with them, where, if I arrived, I concluded
J, jshoujd make some acquaintance^ or find some re-
^atjiqns, that would be faithful to me; and accord-
ingly I prepared tQ go (for England with all my
wealth.
In order to prepare things for my gping home,
I first* (the Brasil fleet being just going away) re-
solved to give answers suitable to the just and
faithful account of things I fyad from thence; and
first tOjtb^e prior of St, Augustine, I wrote a letter
full of shanks for his jfist dealings,, and the offer
of the §7% n^dpr^s, whjiph was undisposed o£
which,1 cjpsifed ipight bp given; 500 to the mo-
nastery; and 372 to the poor,„as thp prk>r should
3C %
dhect, desiring the good Padre's prayers for me,
and the like.
I wrote next a letter of thanks to my two trus-
tees, with all the acknowledgment that so much
justice and honesty called for; as tor sending them
any piesent, they werfc far abbve having any occa-
sion of it.
Lastly I wrote to my partner, afckt>6Wledging
his industry in the improving the plantation, and
his integrity in increasing th6 stock of the wbrkfc,
giving him instructions foHiis future goverhm&rlt
of my part according to the pWers I had left With
my old patron, to whom I desired hitn to sdnd
whatever became due to me, till he should he&r
from me more particularly: assuring hirfi th&t it
was my intention, not only t'6 cdfhe to tfini, but'to
settle myself there for the remainder b£ itiy life.
To this I added a very handfcdifte present df sbme
Italian silks for his wife alid tWo daughters,' f6r
such the captain's Sbti informed ftie he hacl; With
two pieces of fine English broad-fclo'ih, the best I
could get in Lisbon, five piedeS of black B&ifce, atid
borne Flanders lace of a good value.
Having thus settled my affairs, sold my cargo,
and turned all my 'effects into good bills of ex*
change, my next difficulty was, which W&y to go
to England. I had been accustomed enough to
the sea, and yet I had a strange aversion to go
to England by %ea at that time; and though I
coulld give no reason for it, yet the difficulty in-
creased upon me So much, that though I had once
shipped my baggage in order to go, yet I altered
my mind, and that not once, but two or three
times.
It is true, I had been very unfortunate by sea,
and this might be one of the reasons. But let no
man slight the strong impulses of his own thoughts
in cases of such moment. Two of the ships which
I had singled out to go in, I mean more partieu-
laily singled out than any other, that is to say, so
as in one of them to put my things on board, and
in the other to have agreed with the captain; I say,
<ttvo of these &hips miscarried, viz. one was taken by
the Algerines, and the other was cast away on the
Start, near Torbay, and all the people drowned ex-
cept three; so that in either of those vessels I had
been made miserable, and in which most, it was
hard to say.
Having been thus harassed in my thoughts,
my old pilot, to whom I communicated every thing,
pressed me earnestly not to go to sea; but either
to go by land to the Groyne, and cross over the
Bay of Biscay to Rochelle, from whence.it was but
an easy and safe journey by land to Paris, and so
to Calais and Dover; or to go up to Madrid, and
so all the way by land through Fi ance.
In a word, I was so prepossessed against my go-
ing by sea at all, except from Calais to Dover, that
)i resolved to travel all the way hy land; which,
as I was not in haste, and did not value the charge,
was by much thq pleasanter way; and to make it
more so, my old captain brought an English gen-
tleman, the son of a merchant in Lisbon, who was
willing to travef with me; after wVfch, we picked
up two who were English, and merchants also>
and two young Portuguese gentlemen, the last: go-
ing to Paris only; so that we were in all six; of us,
and five servants, the two merchants, and the two
Portuguese, contenting themselves with one ser-
vant between two, to save the charge; and as for
me I got an English sailor to travel with me as a
servant, besides my man Friday, who was too much
a stranger to be capable of supplying the place of
a servant upon the road.
In this manner I set out for Lisbon: and our
company being all very well mounted arid' 4rme J,
we made a little troop, whereof +hey did mc the
honour to call me captain, as well because I was
the oldest man, as because I had two servants,
and indeed was the original of the whole journey.
As I have troubled you with none of my sea
journals, so shall I trouble you with none of my
, land journals. But some adventures that happened
to us in this tedious and difficult journey, 1 must
not omit.
When we tame to Madrid, we, being all of us
strangers to Spain, were willing to stay some
time to see the court of Sj^ain, and to see what
was worth dbserving; but it bdfag the latter patt
of the summer, we hastened away, 'and set out
from Madrid about the middle of October. Biit
when we came to the edge of Navarre, we were
alarmed at several towns oii^ the 'wa^, with an
account that so much snoW 'was' fallen on the
French side of the mountain's,'f tliat5 several tra-
vellers were obliged to c6me batfk to fampeluna,
after having attempted, at ah extreme hazard, to
pass ort, .'
When we came to Pampeluna itself, we found
it so indeed; and to me that had been always used
to #n hot climate, and indeed to countries where
ye could scarce bear any clothes on, the cold was
^insufferable; nor, indeed, was it more painful than
it was surprising^ to come but ten days before out
,of the Old Castile, where the weather was not only
,warrp, but very hot, and immediately to feel a wind
from the Pyrenean mountains, so very keen, so
severely cp}d> as to be intolerable, and to endanger
benumbing <and perishing of our fingers and toes,
;was very strange.
Poor Friday was really frighted when he saw
the mountains alLcovered with snow, and felt cold
weathqr, which he had never seen or felt before
in his life*
T9 mend the matter, after we came to Pampe-
luna, it continued snowing with so much violence,
and so long, that the people said, winter was come
before its time; and the roads, which were difficult
before, y/ere now quite impassable: in a word, the.
srjow lay in some places too thick for us to travel;
and being not hard frozen, as is the case in north-
ern countries, there was no going without being
ivi danger of being buried alive every step. We
^aid no les^.than twenty days at Pauxpeluna;
Avben feeing the winter coming on, and no like-
lihood of it$ beiug fyettei;, for it was the severest
^jmtetr all over Jiuropp that had been known, in
many yeaps) I proposed^ that we should ajl go away
to Fontarabi^ ^njd* there t$ke shipping for Bour
deaux, whiqjh wa*s,a v^ry littl^^yage.
But while we were considering this, thei^xame

hi fout ^French gentlemen \\$ho„ having <been stop-

on ths Spanish, had found out a guide, who tra-
YGrakpg the country near the head of Languedoe,

ways, that they were not much incommoded with
the snow; and where they met with snow i% a$|r
quantity, they said it was -frozen, ford teaougk to

upon our guide, we wefrt oh/
**' 3Pt w&s about tWO^hours before rlight, when our
£nide being something before us, and not just in
&ghtt out rtislied' three monstrous wolves, and after
Iheift £ bear, out of an iiollbw way, adjoining to a
thick wood: two of the wofvesf flew upon the
guide, and had heTteeti half a mile before us, he
hM h^eti devoured^ndfeed, before we could have
^helped Kifta: dn^df them fastened upon his horse
and theotheifaitackfed the man with thatvioleticfe
that he h£cP5not time*/ t>? not J^rdence of ttited
enough, to draw his pistol, but hallooed and cried
out to us most lustily. My man Friday being next
to me, I bid him ride up, and see what was the
matter. As soon as Friday came in sight of the
man, he hallooed, as loud as the other, O master!
O master! But, like a bold fellow, rode directly
up to the man, and with his pistol shot the wolf
that attacked him in the head.
It was happy for the poor man th^t it was my
man Friday; for he, having been used to/that kind
of creature in his country, had no fea^ ppoft him,
but went close up to him, and shotihim as above;
whereas any of us would have fired at a further
distance, and have perhaps either missed the wolf,
or endangered shooting the mam
But it was enough to have terrified a "bolder
man than I, and indeed it alarmed aH our company;
when, with the noise of v Friday's pistol, we heard
on both sides the dism^llest howling^ of waives,
and the noise redoubled by the echo of the tnxmn*
tains, that it was to us asjf there had beeua pro*
digious multitude of .them; and perhaps indeed
there was not such a few, as that'w&had no cause
of apprehensions.
However, as Fr4day b$d killed, thisi,wolf, the
other, that had)fa&te^d ijpojufche horse, left him
immediately, and 4te& having happily fastened
Upon his he*d,>wh&# %$ ft®me$ ($f the bridle had

the arm, ,and 4he other time a little abov/e his knee;*
and he Was just as it were tumbling down by the
disorder of the horse, when Friday came up, and
shtft the wolf.
It is easy to suppose, that at the noise of Friday's
pistol we all mended our pace, and rid up as fast
as the way (which was very difficult) would give
&s leave, to see what was the matter: as soon as
we came clear of the trees, which blinded us before,
\ye gaw plainly what had been the case, and how
Iriday had disengaged the poor guide; though
we did not presently discern what kind of creature
\t was he had killed.
.Bufctaevet was^a fight managed so hardily, and
in saclival surprising ^manner, as that which fol-
lowed between Friday and the bear, which gave
H3 Jill t{though attfirst-we were&urprised and afraid
for him) the greatest diversion imaginable; as the
bear* is an heavy, clumsy creature, and does not
gallop as^the wolf does, which is swift and lights
so he has two particular qualities?, whieh generally
aue the rule of hm actions*; first as to men, who
are* foot his proper $>rey, I say not his proper prey,
because though Tcaniiot say what excessive hun-
ger might do, which was now their case, the
ground being all covered with snow; yet as to
men, he doe&not usually attempt them, unless they
first attack tern; on the contrary, if you meet him
in the woods* W you d6 not meddle with him, he
will not meddle with you; yet thenyofc must take
care tok be wry civil to-him* and give him the
road; for hei^a^efyntee gentleman; he will not
go a step out? dfthe wayfbr & prinee£ nay,*i£ you
are really afraid, your best way is to look another
3D %
i ) t <
way, and keep going on; for sometimes, if you
stop,Nai^d stand still, apd look stedfastly at him, he
takes it for an affront; and if you throw or toss
any thing at him, and it hits him, though it were
but a bit of stick as big as your finger, he takes it
for an affront, and sets all other business aside to
pursue his revenge; for he will have satisfaction in
point of honour, and this is his first quality; the
next is, that if he be once affronted, he will never
leave you, night or day, till he has his reyenge,
]but follow at a good ro^nd^ rat;e trill he overtakes
you. ( !
My man Friday had: deliveredf oiir guide, T and
when we came up to him, J19 was helping him, off
from his hor§e; for the man wajs both hurt and
frighted, and indeed the last /more than the fi[rstj
when, on a sudden^ we espied the bear come out
of the wood, and a very monstrous one it was, the
biggest by far that ever I ^saw: we were all alijttle
surprised when ,we saw him; but when Friday saw
him, it was easy to see joy and courage in the
fellow's countenance^ O! 01 Q! says Friday, three
times, pointing to him, O master! you give nlq te
leave, me shakee te hand with him, me makeeyoii
good laugh.
I was surprised to see the fellow so pleased,
You fool you, said I, he will eat you up. Eate<?
me wj>! eatee me up! says Friday, twice over again:
3\le eatpe him up; me make you goodj laugh; you
allsta^ here, me tshew you good laugh: so down
he sits, and gets his boots pff in a moment, ancj
pijt on a pair f of pump^a^ we calf the fla,t shoes
they wear) and whicli he had in his packet, kncl
gives my other servant his horse, and, with his
gijn, away he flew, swift like the wind.
The bear was walking softly on, and"offered td
meddle with nobody, till Friday coming pretty
near, calls to him, as if the bear could Understand
him: Hark ye, hark ye, says Friday, me speakee
wit you. We followed at a distance; for noW
being come down to the Gascoigne side of the
mountains, we were entered a vast great foi*est;
where the country was plain, and pretty open,
though many trees in it scattered here and thefe.'
* Friday, who hacl, as1 We say, the heels of the
bear, came up with him quickly, and takes irp a
great stoht, "and tfirows at him, and hit him just
n the beacf * "but did hint nov more harm than i|*
lie fyad thrown it against a wall; but it answered
Friday's end; for the rogue was so void of fear,
thjat he did it purely to make the bear follow him,
iind $hew us some laugh,1 as hfc called it.
As spo£ as the bear felt the stone, and saw hhti;
he'turns about, and comes after him; takitig de-
vilish lorfg strides, atn^ shuffling along at a Strang^
rate, so as he would put an horse to a middling
gallop: away runs Friday, and takesshrs course, as
if he ran towards us1 fox help; so ite all resolved
to fire at once upon the bear, and deli vet thy matrj

ture. He hears me, and qries out, No shpot, no
shoot, stand still, you get much laugh: and as the
nimble creature ran two feet for the beast's one,
he turned on a sudden, on one side of us, and see-
ing a great oak tree, fit for bis purpose, lie beck-
oned us to follow, and doubling his pace, he gets
nimbly up the tree, laying his gun down upon the
ground, at about five or six yards from the bottom
of the tree.
The bear soon came to the tree, and we fol-
lowed at a distance; the first thing he did, he
stopped at the gun?i smelt that, but let it lie, and up
he scrambles into the tree;, plimbing' like a cati
though so monstrous heavy. J was amazed at the
folly, as I thought it, of ljiy man, and could not
for my life see any thing to laugh at yet, till see-
ing the bear get up the tree, we all rode nearer to
him.
When we came to the tree, there was Friday got
out to the small of a large limb of the tree, and
the bear got about half way to him; as soon as the
bear got out to that part where the limb of th£
tree was weaker, Ha, says he to us, now you sec
me teachee the bear dance; so he falls a jumping^
and shaking the bough, at which the bear began
to totter, but stood still, and began to look behind
him, to see how he should get back;' then indeed
we,did laugh heartily. But Fridayliad not done
with him by a great deal: when lie sees him stand
still, he calls out to him again, as if he had sup-
posed the bear could speak English, What, you
come no further? Pray you conie further. So he
left jumping and shaking the bough: and the bear,
just as if he understood what he said, did come a
little further; then he fell a jumping again, and
the hear stopped again.
We thought now was a good time to knock him
on the head, and called to Friday to stand still,
and we would shoot the hear; but he cried out
earnestly, O pray! O pray! no shoot, me shoot
by and then; he would have said, by and bye.
However, to shorten the story, Friday danced so
much and the hear stood so ticklish, that we had
laughing enough indeed, but still could not ima-
gine what the fellow would do; for first we thought
Be depended upon shaking the bear off; and we
found the bear was too cunning for that too; for
he would not get out far enough to be thrown
down, hut clings fast with his great broad claws and
feet, so that we could not imagine what would be
the end of it, and where the jest would be at last
But Friday put us out of doubt quickly; for
seeing the bear cling fast to the bough, and that
he would not be persuaded to come any further,
Well, well, said, said Friday, you no come further,
me go, me'go; you no come to me, me come to
ybu; and upon this he goes out to the smallest
end of the bough, where it would hend with his
yeight, and gently lets himself down by it sliding
down the bough, till he came near enough to jum]>
aown on his feet, and away he ran to his gun, takes
it u|>,tah|d stands still.
Wel£ ^id I to* hini, Friday, what will you da
now?' Why doriVydu shoot him? No shoot, say&
friday, no jit; me shoot now me no kilt; me $t&%
giVfeybu Me* tfriSfcttfetf j4fcfi indeed s^&^d/&
you will see presently; for when the bear saw his
enemy gone, he comes back from the bQUgh
where he stood, but did it mighty leisurely,
looking behind him every step, and coming back-
ward till he got into the body of the tree; then
with the same hinder end foremost, he came down
the tree, grasping it with his claws, and movipg
one foot at a time, very leisurely; at this junc-
tuie, and just before he could set his hind feet upon
the ground, Friday stepped close to him, clapped
the muzzle of his piece into hjs ear, and shot, him
as dead as a stone. u
Then the rogue turned about, to specif W£ did
not laugh; and when he saw we were pleased by
our looks, he falls a laughing hirpself very lpudj
So we kills bear in my country,, say^ Frid^yi t §9
you kill them, said I; why you have no gu^s.
No, says he, no guns, but shoot great ipucb l<j>pg
arrow.
This was, indeed, a good diversion tp us^ 6i^ty^
were still in a wild place, and our guide very ipucjk
hurt, and what to dlo we hardly knew; the fyOj^K
ing of wolves ran mucji in my head; and ifldgf^l
except the noise I once heard on the -shore" of
Africa, of which I have said soijiejthing already* J
never heard any thing tHat filled me.wit;h so jnuch
horror.
These things, and the approach of nighty called
us off, or else, as Friday would have had us, we
should certainly have taken the skin of this mon-
strous creature off, which was worth saving; but
we had three leagues to,gof and ouj* guide hastened
m; so we left lum, and Mfsat forward oa aurioiir-
The ground was still covered with snow, though
not so deep and dangerous as on the mountains;
and the ravenous creatures, as we heard afterwards,
were come down into the forest and plain country,
pressed by hunger/to seek for food, and had done
a great deal of mischief in the villages, where they
surprised the country people, killed a great many
of their sheep and horses, and some people too.
We had one dangerous place to pass, of which
our guide told us, if there were any more wolves
in the country, we should find them there; and
this was a small plain, surrounded with woods on
every side, and a long narrow defile or lane, which
we were to pass to get through the wood, and then
we should come to the village where we were to
lodge.
It was within half an hour of sunset when we
entered the first wood; and a little after sunset,
when we came into the plain. We met with no-
thing in the first wood, except that in a little plain
within the wood, which was not above two fur-
longs over, we saw five great wolves cross the road,
full speed one after another, as if they had been
in chase of some prey, and had it in view; they
took no notice of us, and were gone and out of
sight in a few moments.
Upon this our guide, who, by the way, was a
wretched faint-hearted fellow, bade us keep in a
ready posture; for he believed there were more,
wolves a coming.
We kept our arms ready, and our eyes about us;
but-we saw no more wolves till wre came through
that wood, which was near half a league, and en-

trance of the wood* through which we were *io
pass, at the fuither side of the plain: but we,were
greatly surprised^ when, coming near the lane, or
pass> we saw a confused number of wolves stand-
ing just at the entrance.
On a sudden, at another opening of the wood,
we heard the noise of a gun; and, looking that
way, out rushed an horse, with a saddle and a
bridle on him, flying like the wind, and sixteen
or seventeen xwoives after /him full spfced; indeed
the horse had the heels.of them; but as we sup-
posed that he could not hold it atvth^t rate, we
doubted not *but .they woirldgetjupwith him at

Here we had a most horrible sight;., for, riding up
to the entrance where the hoi secame.out* wefouud
the carcase of another horsey and of two men de-
voured by these ravenous creatures, and of "one
the man was no> doubt the^ame whom we»»heard
fire a gun, for there lay. a <gnn> just by him fired
off; but as to the man, his head> and .the upper
part of his bod}', were eatennup.
This filled us with hafror, and we knew not
what course, to take^ but < the creatures resolved
us sooh> foir .they ^gathered .about us *presently^ in
hopes of*prey; and I Eerily believe ithere' weie
three hundred^of >them.i It happened tvery much
to bur advantage, that at the entrance *into the
wbodr but a little wayJiorci it^therevlay some larg^
timber trees* which hadJbeen cut.dbwnthe sum-
mer before* and I f suppose * lay there for carrjag^;
I drew my little troop in among these trees, and
placing ourselves in a line behind one long-tree, JL
advised them all to alight,* and, keeping that tree
before us,* for a,breast-work, to.stand in a triangle,
or three fronts, inclosing our horses in the centre.
We did so, and it was well we did; for never
was a more furious charge than the creatures*made
upon us in this place; tbey came on us with a
growling kind of a noise, and mounted the pie^e
of timber (which, as I said, was our* breast-work,)
as if they were only rushing upon their prey; and
this fury of theirs, it seems, was principally occa-
sioned by their seeing onr horses behind us, which
was the prey they aimed at:. I ordered our men
toifire ai before, every man; and they took thek
aim so sure, th&t^mdeed they Jkilled several of the
wolves at the first volley; but there was a neces-
sity to keep a continual firing, for they came on
like devils, those behind* pushing on those before*
u When we had fired our second volley of fusils,
we thought they stopped a little, and I hoped they
would have gone off,, but it was but a«moment,ibr
^others came foi ward again; so we fired our volleys
of pistols; and I beli&ve in these four ^Brings, we
killecL seventeen or dghteen of them, and lamed
twice as many; yet they came on again. »
% J was loth to spend our last shot too hastily^; so
Ixalled my servant, not my man Friday, for he
was better, employed;, for,* with the greatest dex-
terity imaginable, he charged my fusil and his
orosn, wJiile^tve were engaged; but, as I said, I
called.toy other man; and giving him a horn of
powder, I bade haifl lay a*train all along the pieee
of timber,,and let* it be a large train; lie djdUsi),
and ha4 but time to get away, when the wolves
dime up to it, &tid s6mb ^ere got up upon it;
when I, snapping an uncharged pistol dx^seto the
powder, set it on fire; and those that were upon
the timber were scorched with it, and six ot seven
of them fell, or rather jumped in among us, with
the force afld fright of the fire; we dispatched
these in an instant, and the rest were so frighted
with the light, which the night, for now it was
very near dark, made more terrible, that they dr§\V
back a little.
Upon which I ordered our last pistols to be
fired off in one volley, and after that we gave a
shout; upon this the wolves turned tail, and We
satfied immediately upon near twenty lame ones,
which we found struggling o^l tfi$ ground, and
fell a cutting them with our swSrcfs, whicK ?,ft-
swered our expectation; for the crying and! nowl-
iiig they made were better understood^ by th^ir
fellows; so that they lied and If ft us.
We had, first and last, kjllerf about threescore
of them; and hacl it Been day-light, we had kil|ed
many more. The field of battle being thus cleaf ea,
we mad6 forward again, for we frad still neaj?ja
league to go; we heard the ravenous dreatuf^
ho\Vt and yell in the woods as wfe went, sev£qal
times; attdv sometimes we fancied we saw some of
theft, but the'snow doling our eyes, we,were
not certain; sd In about an honr mbre we <^me,Jto

gu&rd flight and day, but especially in the night,
to preserve their cattle, and indeed their people.
The next morning our guide was so ill, and his
limbs so swelled with the rankling of his two
wounds, that he could go no further; so we were
obliged to take a new guide there, and go to Tho-
louse, where we found a warm climate, a fruitful,
pleasant country, and no snow, no wolves, or any
thing like them; but when we tqld our story at
Tholouse, they to}d us it was nothing but what
was ordinary* in thli grc&t forest at the foot of the
mountains, ^specialty when the snow lay on the
ground; "but they inquired much what kind of a
guide we fiad gotten, that would venture to bring
**s tW way in* such a sevete season; and told us,
it w&s very trincli we were not all devoured. When
we totd them Ifciow we placed ourselves, and the
horses in th^middle^ they blamed us exceedingly,
and told us it wasiifty to one hut we had been all
deitrd^ed; for it was the sight of the horses that
siaffe th<6 waives so furious, seeing their prey; and
that 'at other times they are really afraid of a gun;
|nit they^beiig excessivel hungry, and raging on
that account, the eagerness to come at the horses

would have been so eager to have devoured thera^
that we might have come off safe, especially hav-
ing our fire-arms in our hands, and being so many
in number.
For my part, I was never so sensible of danger
in my life; for seeing above three hundred devik
come roaring and open-mouthed to devour us, and
having nothing to shelter us, or retreat to, I gave
myself over for lost; and as it was, I believe, I
shall never care to dross those mountains a^ain; I
think I would much rather go a thousand leagues i
by. sea, though I were sure to meet with a storm
once a week.
I have nothing uncommon to take notice of in
my passage through France; nothing but what
other travellers have given an account of, with
much more advantage than I can* I travelled from
Tholouse to Paris, and without any considerable
stay, came to Calais, and landed safe at Dover;
the fourteenth of January, .after having had &
severe cold season to .travel in. ,
I was now come to the centre of my travels^
and had in a^ little time all my new discovered
estate safe about me, the bills of r exchange, whicht
I brought with me, having* been, very currently
paid. * . <
My, principal guide and pxivy coujaeellor, was
my|[odd<ancient widow, jwfaQ*J& gratitude for the
ip&ney I bad senfciier, thoughltno pains Jboo mjucbr
or pare jtox>*gr#&!H0 sreptoy for m$h $ndX trusted
her so, enJi^y*iw*th $ wp?y tfeg& $b*fcj wm pe#K
fectly e^sy as to the sectary of my $ffe&tsj:«d
indeed I was very happy from my beginning, and
now to the end, in the unspotted integrity of this
good gentlewoman.
And now 1 began to think of leaving my effects
with this woman, and setting out for Lisbon, and
so to the Brasils: but now another scruple came
in the way, and: that was religion; for as I had
entertained some doubts about the Roman religion,
even while I was abroad, especially in my state of
solitude; so I kuew there was no going to the
Brasite/for mermuch less going to settle there, un-
less I> resolved to embrace the Roman Catholic re-
ligion* without any reserve; except on the other
hand I resolved to be a sacrifice to my principles,
be a martyr for religion, and die in the Inquisition:
so I resolved to stay at home, and if I could find
means for it, to dispose of my plantation.
To this purpose I wrote to my old friend at Lis-
bon, who in return gave me notice, that he could
easily dispose of it there: but that if I thought
fit to give him leave to offer it in my name to the
two merchants, the survivors of my trustees who
lived in the Brasils, who must fully understand
the Value of it, who lived just upon the spot, and
who I knew to be very rich, so that he believed
th&j>would be fond of buying itj he did not
dS|pfe% but I should make 4 or 5 5000 pieces of
6ight the more of it.
^Accordingly I agreed, gave him orders-to offer
it to them, and he* did so* and in about eight;
months more^ the'ship* being then returned, he
sent me an > account, that they had*;aceepted the
offer,* and had remitted 33,000 jrieces >®£ eight to
vol. 1. a F
a correspondent of theirs at Lisbon, to pay for
it
In return, I signed the instrument of sale in the
form which they sent from Lisbon, and sent it to
my old man, who sent me> the bills of exchange
for 32,800 pieces of eight for the estate; reserving
the payment of 100 moidores a ye&iy to him, (the
old man,) during^ his life, and 50 raoidbres* after-
wards to his son for hisrlife, whiclr I had promised
them; and which the^plantation \^a^ to make good
as a rent charge. And thus I have given the fii^t
part of a life erf fortune aiid.adVtnturej^life of
Providence's cbequer^ork, &frduo£ a< variety fahicH
the world will seldom bfe able to shew the lik}e 6f:
beginning foolishly, but closing much more hap-
pily than any part of it ever .gave me1 leave so
much as to hope for.
Any one would think, that in thft Mate of com*
plicated good fortune, I was past running any more
hazards, and so indeed I had been, if other cirdutn-
stances had concurred l but-1 was inured td a
wandering life, had no family, nor many relation;
rior, however rich, had I contracted much ac-
quaintance; and'though I had sold my estate in
the Brasils, yet I could n&t keep that country tjiit
of my head, and had a £reat mipd to be upon iffee
wing again;' especially 1 dould hot'resist thfe strolf^
inclination I had to see my island, &nd to knoVif if
the poor Spaniards were in beirig thet&;s afrd h6w

would apply themselves to planting; which I
afterwards could not perform: the fellows proved
very honest and diligent, after they were mastered,
and had their properties set apart for them. I

them being big with calf, some sheep, and some

PREFACE.
The success the former part of this Worjk
foas met with in the world, has yet been no
olhei? than is acknowledged to be due to the
surprising variety of the subject, and to the
agueeable manner of the performance.
All the endeavours of envious people to re-
proach it with being a romance, to search it
for errors in geography, inconsistency in the
relation, and contradictions in the fact, have
proved abortive, and as impotent as mali-
cious*
The just application of every incident, the
religious and useful inferences drawn from
everyx part, are so many testimonies to the
good design of making it public, and must
legitimate all the part that may be called in-
vention or parable In the story.
VOL. II. A
iv FHi?HAoem
Tfe£ Stolid "Bait, if the Editors opinio**
may pass, is (contrary to the usage of Second
Parts) every way as entertaining as the First j
contains as strange and surprising incidents,
and as great a variety of them; nor is the
application less serious or suitable; and doubt-
less will, to the sober, as well as the ingenious
ItEAiiEft, be every wayas profitable and|4|r
Testing; and this makes the^&brirfgl&g* tfepp
Work as scandalous, as it is knavish andtlMir
culous. Seeing, to shorten the Book, that they
may seem to reduce the value, they strip it of
all those reflections, as well religious as moral,
which are not only the greatest beauties of the
Work, but are calculated for the infinite ad-
vantage of the Reader.
By this, they leave the Work naked of its
brightest ornaments; and yet they would (at
the same time they pretend that the Author
has supplied his story out of his invention)
take from it the improvement, which alone
recommends that invention to wise and good
men.
The injury these men do to the Propria
#iE«^t>f*Wo&i£s, is a practice ^i lionest
feleo &1)hor Jf and they believe they i»ay ch^Jr
lenge them to shew the difference between
that and robbing on the highway, or break-
ing open a house.
If they cannot shew any difference in the
lerime, they will find it hard io shew why
*foere should be any difference in the punish-
went.
FURTHER ADVENTURES
OF
ROBINSON CRUSOE,
%c. 8sc.
Xhat homely proverb used on so many occasions
in England, viz. That what is bred in the bone will
not go out of the flesh, was never more verified
than in the story of my LIFE. Any one would
think that after thirty-five years affliction, and a
variety of unhappy circumstances, which few men,
if any, ever went through before, and after near
seven years of peace and enjoyment in the fulness
of all things; grown old, and when, if ever, it
might be allowed me to have had experience of
every state of middle life, and to know which was
most adapted to make a man completely happy; I
say, after all this, any one would have thought
that the native propensity to rambling, which I
gave an account of in my first setting out into the
world to have been so predominant in my thoughts,
should be worn out, the volatile part be fully eva-
VOL. II. B
cuated, or at least condensed, and I might at sixty-
one years of age have been a bttle inclined to stay
at home, and have done ventilling life and fortune
any more.
Nay fui iher, the common motive of foreign ad-
ventaies was taken away in me; fori had no fortune
to make, I had nothing to seek: if I had gained ten
thousand pounds, I had been no licher; for I had
already sufficient for me, and for those I had to
leave it to; and that I had was visibly inci easing
for having no great family, I could not spend the
income of what I had, unless I would set up for an
expensive way of living, such as a great family,
servants, equipage, gaiety, and the like, which were
things I had no notion of, or inclination to; so
that I had nothing indeed to do but to sit still,
and fully enjoy what I had got, and gfee it increase
daily upon my hands, »
Yet all these things had no effect upon me, or at
least not enough to resist the strong inclination I
had to go abroad again, which hung- about me like
a chronical distemper; particularly the desire of
seeing my new plantation in the island, and the
colony I left there, run in my head continually. I
dreamed of it all night, and my imagination run
upon it all day; it was uppermost in all my
thoughts, and my fancy worked so steadily and
strongly upon it, that I talked of it in my sleep;
in short, nothing could remove it out of my mind;
it even broke so violently into all my discourses,
that it made my conversation tiresome; for I could
talk of nothing else, all my discourse run into it,
even to impertinence, and I saw it myself.
I have often heard persons of good judgment
say, that all the stir people make in the world
about ghosts and apparitions, is owing to the
strength of imagination, and the powerful opera-
tion of fancy in their minds; that there is no such
thing as a spiiit appearing, or agho^t walking, and
the like; that people's poring affectionately upon
the past conversation of their deceased friends so
realises it to them, that they are capable of fancy-
ing upon some extraordinary circumstances that
they see them, talk to them, and are answered by
them, when, in truth, there is nothing but shadow
and vapour in the thing; and they really know
nothing of the matter.
For my part, I know not to this hour, whether
there are any such things as real apparitions, spec-
tres, or walking of people after they are dead, or
whether there is any thing in the stories they tell
us of that kind, more than the product of vapours,
sick minds, and wandering fancies. But this I
know, that my imagination worked up to such a
height, and brought me into such excess of va-
pours, or what else I may call it, that I actually
supposed myself often-times upon the spot, at my
old castle behind the trees, saw my old Spaniard,
Friday's father, and the reprobate sailors whom I
left upon the island; nay, I fancied I talked with
them, and looked at them as steadily, though I
ivas broad awake, as at persons just before me; and
this I did till I often frightened myself with the
images my fancy represented to me: one time in
my sleep I h^the villany of the three pirate sal*
lors so lively,rdated to me by the fkst Spaniard
b 2
and Friday's father, that it was surprising; they
told me how they barbarously attempted to mur-
der all the Spaniards, and that they-set fire to the
provisions they had laid up, on purpose to distress
and starve them, things that I had never heard of,
and that were yet all of them true in fact: but it
was so warm in my imagination, and so realised
to me, that to the hour I saw them, I could not
be persuaded but that it was or would be true;
also how I resented it when the Spaniard com-
plained to me, and how I brought them to jus-
tice, tried them before me, and ordered them all
three to be hanged: what there was really in this,
shall be seen in its place: for however I came to
form such things in my dream, and what secret
converse of spirits injected it, yet there was, 1 say,
very much of it true. I own, that this dream had
nothing literally and specifically true: but the ge-
neral part was so true, the base and villanous be-
haviour of these three hardened rogues was such,
and had been so much worse than all I can de-
scribe, that the dream had too much similitude of
the fact; and as I would afterwards have pun-
ished them severely, so if I had hanged them all,
I had been much in the right, and should have
been justifiable both by the laws of God and man.
But to return to my story. In this kind of tem-
per I had lived some years; Phad no enjoyment of
my life, no pleasant hours, no agreeable diversion
but what had something or other of this in it, so
that my wife, who saw1 my mind so wholly bent
upon it, told me very seriously one night, that she
believed there was some secret powerful impulse
of Providence upon me, which had determined
me to go thither again; and that she found no-
thing hindered my going but my being engaged to
a wife and children. She told me, that it was true
she could not think of parting with me; but as she
was assured, that if she was dead it would be the
first thing I would do; so, as it seemed to her that
the thing was determined above, she would not
be the only obstruction: for if I thought fit, and
resolved to go—here she found me very intent
iiporj her words, and that I looked very earnestly
at her; so that it a little disordered her, and she
stopped. J asked her why she did not go on, and
say out what she was going to say? But I peiceived
h£r heart was too full, and some tears stood in hei
eyes. Speak out, my dear, said I, are you willing
I should go? No, says she, very affectionately, I
am far from willing; but if you are resolved to go,
says she, and rather than I will be the only hin-
derance, I will go with you; for though I think it
a preposterous thing, for one of your years, and iu
your condition, yet if it must be, said she again,
weeping, I won't leave you; for if it be of Hea-
ven, you tjiust do it; there is no resisting it; and if
Heaven makes it your duty to go, he will also
make it mine to go with you, or otherwise dis-
pose of me, that I may not obstruct it.
This affectionate behaviour of my wife brought
me a little out of the vapours, and I began to con-
sider what I >vas dping; I corrected my wander-
ing fapcy, and began to argue with myself se-
dately, \yh^t business I had, after threescore
years, and after si,ic)\ a, life of tedious sufferings
and disasters, and closed in so happy and easy a
manner, I say, what business had I to rush into
new hazards, and put myself upon adventures, fit
only for youth and poverty to run into'?
With those thoughts, I considered my new en-
gagement; that I had a wife, one child born, and
my wife then great with child of another; that I
had all the woild could give me, and had no need
to seek hazards for gain; that I was declining in
years, and ought to think lather of leaving what I
had gained, than of seeking to increase it; that as
to what my wife had said, of its being an impulse
from Heaven, and that it should be my duty to
go, I had no notion of that; so after many of these
cogitations, I struggled with the power of my
imagination, reasoned myself out of it, as I believe
people may always do in like cases, if they will;
and, in a word, I conquered it; composed myself
with such arguments as occurred to my thoughts,
and which my present condition furnished me
plentifully with: and particularly, as the most ef-
fectual method, I resolved to divert myself with
other things, and to engage in some business that
might effectually tie me up from any more excur-
sions of this kind; for I found the thing return
upon me chiefly when I was idle, had nothing to
do, or any thing of moment immediately before
me.
To this purpose I bought a little farm in the
couqty of Bedford, and resolved to remove myself
thither, I had a little convenient house upon it>
an 4 the lan<3 about it I found was( capable o£ great
improvement, and thaj^t.was many w^.ys suited to
my indication, which delighted in cultivating,
managing, planting and improving of land; and
particularly, being an inland country, I was re-
moved from conversing among ships, sailors, and
things relating to the remote part of the world.
In a word, I went down to my farm, settled my
family, bought me ploughs, harrows, a cart, wag-
gon, horses, cows, sheep; and setting seriously to
work, became in one half year a mere country gen-
tleman; my thoughts were entirely taken up in
managing my servants, cultivating the ground, en-
closing, planting, &c. and I lived, as I thought, the
most agreeable life that nature was capable of di
recting, or that a man always bred to misfoitunes
was capable of being retreated to.
I farmed upon my own land, I had no rent to
pay, was limited by no articles, I could pull up or
cut down as I pleased r what I planted was for
myself, and what I improved, was for my family;
and having thus left off the thoughts of wander-
ing, I had not the least discomfort in any part of
my life, as to this world. Now I thought indeed,
that I enjoyed the middle state of life which my
father so earnestly recommended to me, a kind of
heavenly life, something like what is described by
the poet Upon the subject of a country life.
Free from vices, free from care,
Age has no pains, and youth, no snare.
But in the middle of all this felicity, one blow
from unforeseen Prdvidence unhinged me at once;
and not only made a breach upon tne, inevitable
and incurable, but drbve rnte; 'by'its ionseqiimcte;
upon a deep relapse into the wandering disposi-
tion; which, as I may say, being born in my very
blood, soon recovered its hold of me, and, like the
returns of a violent distemper, came on with an
irresistible force upon me; so that nothing could
make any more impression upon me. This blow
was the loss of my wife.
It is not my business here to write an elegy
upon my wife, to give a character of her particular
virtues, and make my court to the sex by the flat-
tery of a funeral sermon. She was, in a few words,
the stay of all my affairs, the centre of all my en-
terprizes, the engine that by her prudence reduced
me to that happy compass I was in, from the mosfi
extravagant and ruinous project that fluttered in
my head as above; and did more to guide my ram-
bling genius, than a mother's tears, a father's in-
structions, a friend's counsel, or all my own reason-
ing powers could do. I was happy in listening to
her tears, and in being moved by her entreaties,
and to the last degree desolate and dislocated in
the world by the loss of her.
When she was gone, the world looked awk-
wardly, round me^ I was as much a stranger in it,
in my thoughts, as I was in the Brasils when I
went fiiston shore there; and as mugh alone, ex-
cept as to the assistance of servants, as I was in
my island. I knew neither what to do, or what
not to do. Tsaw the world busy round me, one
part labouring for bread, and the bther pfrrt squan-
dering in virle excesses or empty pleasures, equtftl^
miserable, because the end they proposed still Afl&
from ttem; fbr^he^enof'pleitturti evfery day*&f-
felted of their vice, and heaped up work for sorrow
and Repentance; and the men of labour spent their
strength in daily smugglings for breath to main-
tain the vital strength they laboured with; so liv-
ing in a daily circulation of sorrow, living but to
work, and working but to live, as if daily bread
were the only end of a wearisome life, and a weari-
some life the only occasion of daily bread.
This put me in mind of the life I lived in my
kingdom, the island; where I suffered no more
corn to grow, because I did not want it; and bred
no -more goats, because I had no more use for
them: where the money lay in the drawer till it
grew mildewed, and had scarce the favour to be
looked upon in twenty years.
All these things, had I improved them as I
ought to have done, and as reason and religion had
dictated to me, would have taught me to search
further than human enjoyments for a full felicity,
and that there was something which certainly was
the reason and end of life, superior to all these
things, and which was either to be possessed, or at
least hoped for, on this side the grave.
But my sage counsellor was gonej I was like a
ship without a pilot, that could only run before
the wind; my thoughts ran all away again into the
old affair, my head was quite turned with the whim-
sies of foreign adventures; and all the pleasing
innocent amusements of my farm and my garden,
my cattle, and my family, which before entirely
possest me^ were nothing to me, had no relish,
and were like music to one that has no ear, or
food to one that has no taste. In a word, I re-
voi*. II. c
solved to leave off house-keeping* let my farm,
and return to London; and in a few months after
I did 50.
When I came to London, I was still uneasy as
before; I had no relish to the place, no employ-
ment in it, nothing to do but to saunter about like
an idle person, of whom it may be said, he is per-
fectly useless in God's creation, and it is not one
farthing matter to the rest of his kind, whether
he be dead or alive. This also was the thing
which of all circumstances of life was the most
my aversion, who had been all my days used to an
active life; and I would often say to myself* A
state of idleness is thp very dregs of life; and in-
deed I thought I was much more suitably era^
ployed, when I was twenty-six days making m$ 3,
deal board.
It was now the beginning of the year 1693^
when my nephew, whom, as* I have observed ber,
fbre> Ihadhroughtnp to the sea, and had made
him commander of a ship, was come home from a
short voyage to Bilboa, being the first he had
made; he came to ,me, and told me, that some
merchants of his acquaintance had been proposing
to him to go a voyage for them to the East Indies
and to China, as private traders: and now, uncle,
says he, if you will go to sea with me, I will en-
gage to land you upon your old habitation in the
island, for we are to touch at the Brasils.
Nothing can be a^greater demonstration of a
future state, ^nd of the existence ,of an invisible
world, than the concurrency of second causes with
the ideass>f things which Wfi form intQur minds
perfectly reserved, and not communicated to any
in the world.
My nephew knew nothing how far my distem-
per of wandering was returned upon me, arid I
knew nothing of what he had in his thoughts to
say, when that very morning before he came to
me I had, in a great deal of confusion of thought,
and revolving every part of my circumstances in
my mifrd, come to this resolution, viz. That I would,
^o to Lisbon, and consult with my old sea cap
lain; and so, if it was rational and practicable, I
would go and see the island again, and see what
iiras become of my people there. I had pleased
<myself also with the thoughts of peopling the
^l&ce, and carrying inhabitants from* hence, getting
<a fratent for the possession, and I know not what;
when in the middle of all this, in comes my ne-
.phew, as I have said, with his project of carrying
nie thither, in his way to the East Indies.
I paused a while at his words, and Iboking stea-
dily at him, What devil, said I, sent you on thts
mnlucky errand? My nephew Startled, as if he had
been frighted at 'first; but perceiving I *was not
much displeased with the proposal", he recovered
iiimself. I hope it may not be an unlucky propo-
sal, Sir, says he; I <kre say you would be pteksed
to see your new colony there, where you once

merchants, I would go with him: but I told him,
I would not promise to go any further than fti^
Own island. Why, Sir, says he, you don't ^arft
to be left theie again, I hope? Why, said I, can
you not take me up again on your retuiii? He told
me it could not be possible that the merchants
would allow him to come that way with a loaded
ship of such value, it being a month's sail out of
his way, and might be three or four. Besides, Sir,
if I should miscarry, said he, and not return at
all, then you would be just reduced to the con-
dition you were in before.
This was very rational; but we both found out
a remedy for it, which was to carry a framed* slod|>
on board the ship, which, being taken in pieces
and shipped on board the ship, might, by the help
of some caipenters, whom we agreed to carry with
us, be set up again in the island; and finished, fit
to go to sea in a few days.
I was not long resolving; for indeed the impor-
tunities of my nephew joined in so effectually with
my iriclination, that nothing could oppose me: on
the other hand, my wife being dead, I had nobody
concerned themselves so much for me, as to per-
suade me one way or other, except my ancient
good friend the widow, who earnestly struggled
with me to consider my years, my easy circum-
stances, and the needless hazard of a long voyage;
and, above all, my young children: but it was all
to no purpose; I had an irresistible desire to the
voyage; and 1 told her I thought there was some-
thing £o uncommon In the impressions I had upon
Uiy mind for ike vo^e, that it would be 9. kind of
re&isjting Providence, if I should attempt to stay
at hpme; after which she ceased her expostula-
tion, and joined with me, not only in making
provision for my voyage, but also in settling my
family affairs in my absence, and providing for
fthe education of my children.
In order to this, I made my will, and settled the
estate I had in such a manner for my children, and
placed in such hands, that I was perfectly easy and
satisfied they would have justice done them, what-
ever might befal me; and for their education, I
^eft it wholly to my widow, with a sufficient main-
tenance to herself for her care: all which she
richly deserved; for no mother could have taken
more care in their education, or understood it bet-
ter; and as she lived till I came home, I alsolivpd
fto thank her for it.
My nephew was ready to sail about the begin-
ning of January 1694-5, and I with my man Friday
went on board in the Downs the 8th, having be-
sides that sloop which I mentioned above, a very
considerable cargo of all kinds of necessary things
for my colony, yrhich, if I did not find in good
condition, I resolved to leave so.
First, I carried with me some servants, whom I
purposed fo place there, as inhabitants, or at least
to set on work there upon 'my own account, while
I stayed, and either to leaye them there,, or cany
them forward* as,they should,appear willing; par-
ticularly I ca^ied £W9 carpenters* a suytlvah&a
very handy j^ugenjqi^ fellow^ \vpo was a c9oper by
<trade»>but wa^a^o-a genera,! ^p^nic^^t^e.was
dexterous at making wheels, and hand-mills to
grind corn, was a good turner, and tf good "pot-
maker; he also made any thing that was proper to
make of earth, or of wood; in a word we called
him our Jack of all trades.
With these I carried a tailor, who had offered
himself to go passenger to the East Indies with my
nephew, but afterwards consented to stay on our
new plantation, and proved a most necessary
handy fellow as could be desired, in many other
businesses besides that of thisHrade; for, as I ob-
served formerly, necessity arms us fbr stll employ-*
ments.
My cargo, as near as I can recollect, for I have
not kept an account of the particulars, consisted^
a sufficient quantity of linen, and some thin En-
glish stuffs for clothing the Spaniards, that I ex-
pected to find there, and enough of them as by my
calculation' might comfortably supply them for se-
ven years; if I remember right, the materials
which I carried for clothing them, with gloves,
hats, shoes, stockings, and all such things as thfcy
could want for wearing, amounted to above 200
pounds, including some beds, bedding, and house-
hold-stuff, particularly kitchen utensils, with pots,
kettles, pewter, brass, &c. besides near an hundred
pounds more in iron-work, nails, took of every
kind, staples, hooks, * hinges, and every necessary
thing I could think of. ]
I carried also a hnndrfed spdre arms, muskets,'
and fusees, besides some pistols, a cdnsiderablt
quantity of shotxyf all sfofes, three or four tons of
lead, and twofpieces 6f brass can^on^ and tedause'
I kiaew hot \vhatf>time,f^ndwhat extremities I wks ]
ptrwi4'mg* f°r? Learned an hundred barrels of pow-
der, .besides swonds, cutlasses, and the iron part of
some .pikes, and halberts; so that, in short, we had
a large magazine of all sorts of stores; and I made
n\y nephew carry two small quarter deck guns
more than he wanted for his ship, to leave behind,
if there was, occasion; that when they came there,
we.might build a fort,, and man it against all sorts
of enemies: and indeed, I at first thought there
WQukLbe need enough, of it all, and much more^ if
w<e hoped to maintain our possession of the island,
as shall be seen in the course of the story.
Ijhad .notsuch bad luck in this voyage as I ilad
beenaased to meet with; and therefore shall have
tlie less occasion to interrupt ther reader, who per-
haps may be impatient to hear how matters went
with my colony; yet some odd accidents, cross
winds,* and bad weather happened* on this first set^
tijxg,out, which made the^voyage longer than I
expected it at first; and I, who had never made
but one voyage, (viz.) my first voyage to Guinea,
in which I jmight be said to come back again, as the
voyage was at first designed, began to think the
same ill fate still attended me; and that I was born
to he never contented with being on shore, and*
yet ito be always unfortunate at sea.*
..Contrary winds first put up to the northward,
and .we were obliged to put in at Galway in Ire-
land^ 5 where we lay wind-bound twoand-thirty
day&; Jwnt^e had this, satisfaction with the dis-
aster, thatJ>rovisions wjbrg hjere)exceeding cheap,
and in the utmost plenty; so that while^we lay
hers .we vnevex touched theship?s stones, but father
added to them; here also I took several hqgs, and
two cows, with their calves, which I resolved, if I
had a good passage, to put on shore in my island;
hut we found occasion to dispose otherwise of them.
We set out the 5 th of February from Ireland,
and had a very fair gale of wind for some days.
As I remember, it might be about the 20th of Fe-
bruary in the evening late, when the mate having,
the watch, came into the round-house, and told
us he saw a flash of fire, and heard a gun fired;
and while he was telling us of it, a boy came iu>
and told us the boatswain heard another. This
made us all run out upon the quarter-deck, where
we h6ard nothing, but in a few minutes we saw a
very great light, and found that there was some
very terrible fire at a distance; immediately we
had recourse to our reckonings, in which we
all agreed that there could be no land that way, in
which the fire shewed itself^ no not for 500 leagues,
for it appeared at W. N. W. Upon this we con-
cluded it must be some ship on fire at sea; and as
by our hearing the noise of guns just before, we
concluded it could not be far off, we stood directly
towards it, and were presently satisfied we should
discover it, because the further vte sailed the greater
the light appeared, though the weather being hazy
we could not perceive any thing but the light for a
while; in about half an hour's sailing, the wind
being fair for us, though riot much of it, and the
weather clearing up a little, we could plainly dis-
cern that it was a great ship on fire in the middle
of the sea.
I was most sensibly touched with this disaster,
though not at all acquainted with the persons en-
gaged In it; I presently recollected my former
circumstances, in what condition I wa$ in when
taketo up by the Portugal Captain; and how much
more deplorable the circumstances of the poor
creatures belonging to this ship must be if they
kid no oth^r ship in company with them: upon
this I immediately ordered, that five guns should
t^p fired, one soon after another, that, if possible, \v e
m|ght give notice to them that there was help for
thfem at hafid, and that they might endeavour to
sa^e themselves iti their boat; for though we could
ske tjie flame in the ship, yet they, it being night,
cbulxTsee nothing; of us.
We laj? by some time upon this, only driving as
th6 burning ship drove, waiting for day-light;
wlien on^ a sudden, to our great terror, though we
had reason to expect it, the ship blew up in the
air, and immediately sunk: this was terrible, and
indeed an afflicting sigh^ for the sake of the poor
men, who, I concluded, must be either all de-
stroyed in the ship, or be in the utmost distress in
their boats in the middle of the ocean, which at
ppesent, by reason it was dark, I could not see:
however to direct them as well as I could, I caused
lights to be hung out in all the parts of the ship
W&Sre^we could, and which we had Ian thorns for;
a|id kept firing guns all the night long; letting
thfen\ know by this, thp,t there was a ship not far
off. \ *
About eight o'clock in the iporning, we disco-
vered the ship's boats, by the help of our perspec*
tive-glasses; and found there were tyro of thtm,
vol. ri. d
both thronged with people, and deep in the-wai-
ter; we perceived they rowed, the wind bqujg
against them; that they saw our ship, and did the
utmost to make us see them.
We immediately spread our ancient, to let them
know we saw them; and hung a waft out, as a sig-
nal for them to come on board; and then made
more sail, standing directly to them. In a little
more than half an hour, we came up with them,
and, in a word, took them all in, being no le$s
than sixty-four men, women, and children; for
there were a great many passengers.
Upon the whole, we found it was a French
merchant-ship of 300 tons, homeward-bound from
Quebec, in the river of Canada. The master gave
ns a long account of the distress of his ship, how
the fire began in the steerage by the negligence of
the steersman; but, on his crying out for help^
was, as every body thought, entirely put out: but
they soon found that some sparks of the first fire
had gotten into some part of the ship, so difficult
to come at, that they could not effectually quench
it; and afterwards getting in between the timbers,
and within, the cieling of the ship, it proceeded
into the hold, and mastered all the skill and all
the application they were able to exert.
, They had no more to do then but to get into
their bqats, which, to their great, pomfort, were
pretty large; being .their long, boat, and a great
shallop, besides a-smajl skiff, whiph was of no great
service to.them/other tfyan to get some fresh water
and pvwisip^s intQ her, affpr they had sec wed
hopes of their lives by getting into these boats at
that'distance from any land; only, as they said
well, that they were escaped from the fire, and had
a possibility, that some ship might happen to be at
sea, and might take them in. They had sails, oars,
and a cojnpass; and were preparing to make the
best of their way to Newfoundland, the wind
blowing pretty fair; for it blew an easy gale at
S. E. by E. They had as much provisions and wa-
t£T, as, with sparing it so as to be next door to
starving, might support them about twelve days;
in which, if they had no bad weather, and no con-
trary winds, the captain said, he hoped he might
gbt to the banks of Newfoundland, and might
perhaps take some fish to sustain them till they
friight go on shore. But there were so many
chances against them in all these cases; such as
Storms to overset and founder them; rains and
cold to benumb and perish their limbs; contrary
winds to keep them out and starve them; that it
must have been next to miraculous if they had es-
caped.
In the midst of their consultations, every one
being hopeless, and ready to despair, the captain
with tears in his eyes told me, they wete on a sud-
den surprised with the joy of hearing a gun fire,
and after that four more; these were the five guns
#hich learned to be fired at first seeing the light:
fchifc revived their hearts, and gave them the no-
tice, which, as above,' T designed it should^ vifc.
that there was & ship at hafrd for their help. * l J
It was ufion the hearing these guns, thaitS they
tookdowft their masts ariffs^life^ah^-the^^emnd
d 2
coming from the windward, they resolved to lie
by till morning. Sorrie time after this, hearing no
mote guns, they fired three ttiuaquets, one a con-
siderable while after another; but these, the wind
being contrary, we never heard.
- Some time after that again, they were still more
agreeably surprised with seeing our lights, and
hearing the guns, which, as I have said, I caused
to be fired all the rest of the night: this set them
to work with their oars to keep their boats a-head,
at least that we might the sooner come up with
them; and at last, to their inexpressible joy, they
found we saw them.
It is impossible for me to express the several
gestures, the strange ecstasies, the variety of pos-
tures, which these poor delivered people ran intof
to express the joy of their souls at so unexpected
$ deliverance. Grief and fear are easily described;
sighs, tears, groans, atid a very few motions of
head and hands, make ttp the sum of its variety:
but an excess of joy, a surprise of joy, has a thou-
sand extravagancies in it; there weie some in tears,
some raging and tearing themselves, as if they had
been in the greatest agonies of sorrow; some stark
raving and down-right lunatic; sdnVe ran about the
ship stamping with their feet, others wringing
their hands; some were dancing, Several singing,
some laughing, more 'cryihgj many qitite dumb,
not able to speak a Word; others sfck and vomit-
ing, several swootfifrg, and ready to faifit; and a
few were crossing t*hertfsfelv£s and giving G^d
thanks. <
I would n6t\frbrig theto nfeithd*; thefe might
Jbe mauiy th#t»,W£i;e thankful afterward; but the
ps&sion Wds too strong fof,them,at first, and,they
were not able tQ master it; they* were thrown into
ecstasies and a kind of frenjzy, and so there were
but a very few who wpre composed and serious in
their joy.
Perhaps also the case may have some addition to
it, from the particular circumstance of the nation
(hey belonged to; I mean the French, whose tem-
per is allowed to be more volatile, more passionate,
and more sprightly, and their spirits more fluid,
than of other nations. I am not philosopher
enqugh to determine the cause, b^ nothing I had
ever seen before came up to it; the ecstasies poor
Friday, my trusty savage, was in, when he found his
father in the boat, came the nearest to it; and the
surprise of the master* and his two companions,
whom I delivered frpm the two villains that set
them on shore in the island, came a little way to*
wards it; but nothing was to compare .to this, ei-
ther that I saw i& Friday, 01; any where pise inAmy
life,
v It is further observable, that these extravagancies
did not $hew themselves in that different manner
I have mentioned, in -different persons only: but
all the vaiiety would appear in a short succession
of moments, in one and the same person, A man
that we saw this minute dumb, and, as it were,
stupid and confounded, should the next minute be
dancing and hallooing* like jiq antic; and the next
moment tearing his hair, or pulling his clothes to
pieces, and stamping tl^n> upde* his feafc like a
madman j a few minutes after that, we should have
him all in tears, then sick,* then swooning; and
had not immediate help been had, would in a fe\fr
moments more have been dead; and thus it was,
not with one or two, or ten or twenty, but with
the greatest part of them; and, if I remember
right, our surgeon was obliged to let above thirty
of them blood.
There were two priests among them, one an old
man, and the other a young man; and that which
was strangest was, that the oldest man was the
worst. •
As soon as he set his foot on board our ship,' and
saw himself safe, he dropped down stone-dead, to*
all appearance; not the least sign of life could beJ
perceived in him; our surgeon immediately ap-
plied proper remedies to recover him; and was the
only man in the ship that believed he was not dead:
and at length he opened a vein in his arm, having
first chafed and rubbed the part, so as to warm it
as much as possible: upon this the blood, which
only dropped at first, flowed something fieely; in
three minutes after the man opened his eyes; and
about a quarter of an hour after that he spoke,
grew better, and in a little time, quite well; after
the blood was stopped, he walked about, told us he
was perfectly well, took a dram of cordial which
the surgeon gave him, and was what we called,
come to himself; about a quarter of an hour after
this, they came running into the cabin to the sur-
geon, who was bleeding a French woman that had
fainted; and told him, the priest was gone stark
tpad. It geems he had began to revolve the charge
of his circumstances in his mind, and this put him
into an ecstasy of joy; his spirits whirled about
faster than the vessels could convey them; the
blood grew hot and feverish; and the man was as
fit for Bedlam as any creature that ever was in it;
the surgeon would not bleed him again in that
condition, but gave him something to doze and put
him to sleep, which, after some time, operated
upon him, and he waked next morning perfectly
composed, and well.
The younger priest behaved himself with great
command of his passion, and was really an exam-
ple of a serious well-governed mind; at his first
doming on board the ship, he threw himself flat
on his face, prostrating himself in thankfulness for
his deliverance; in which I unhappily and unsea-
sonably disturbed him, really thinking he had been
in a swoon; but bespoke calmly; thanked me;
told me, he was giving God thanks for his deli-
verance; begged me to leave him a few moments,
and that, next to his Maker, he would give me
thanks also.
I was heartily sorry that I disturbed him; and
not only left him, but kept others from interrupt-
ing him also; he continued in that posture about
three minutes, or a little more, after I left him;
then came to me, as he had said he would, and,
with a great deal of seriousness and affection, but
^ith' tears in his eyes, thanked me, that had,
under God, given him and so many miserable
creatutes their lives. I told him, I had no room
to move him to thank God for it, rather than me;
for I had seen that he had done that already: but
lidded, t)iat it was nothing but? what reason and
humanity dictated to all men, and that we had as
much reason as he to give thanks to God, who
had blessed us so far as to make us the instruments
of his mercy to so many of his creatures.
After this the young priest Applied himself to
his country folks; laboured to compose them; per-
suaded, entreated, argued, reasoned with them, and
did his utmost to keep them within the exercise
of their reason; and with some he had success,
though others were, for a time, out of all govern-
ment of themselves.
I cannot help committing this to writing, as
perhaps it may be useful to those into whose hands
it may fall, in the guiding themselves in all the ex-
travagancies of their passions; for if an excess of
joy can carry men out to such a length beyond
the reach of their reason, what will not the extras
vagancies of anger, rage, and a provoked mind,
carry us to? And indeed, here I saw reason for
keeping an exceeding watch over our passions of
every kind, as well those of joy and satisfaction,
as those of sorrow and anger.
We were something disordered by these extra-
vagancies among our new guests for the first day;
but when they had been retired, lodgings pro-
vided for them as well as our ship would allow,
and they had slept heartily, as most of them did,
being fatigued and frightened, they Were quite
another sort of people the next day.
Nothing of good manners, or civil acknow-
ledgments for the kindness shewn them was want-,
ing; the French, it is known, are naturally apt
enough to exceed that way. The captain, and
one of the priests, came to me the next day; and,
desiring to speak with me and my nephew, the
commander, began to consult with us what should
be done with them; and first they told us, that, as
we had saved their lives, so all they had was little
enough for a return to us for the kindness received.
The captain said, they had saved some money, and
some things of value in their boats, catched hastily
out of the flames; and if we would accept it, they
were ordered to make an offer of it all to us; they
only desiied to be set on shore somewhere in our
way, where, if possible, they might get a passage
tolerance.
My nephew was for accepting their money at
first word, and to consider what to do with them
afterwards; hut I over-ruled him in that part; for
I knew what it was to be set on shore in a strange
country; and if the Portugal captain that took me
up at sea had served me so, and took all I had for
my deliverance, I must have starved, or have been
as much a slave at the Brasils, as I had been at
Barbary, the being sold to a Mahometan only ex-
cepted ; and perhaps a Portuguese is not a much
better master than a Turk, if not, in some cases,
a much worse.
I therefore told the French captain, that we had
taken them up in their distress, it was true; but
that it was our duty to do so, as we were fellow-
creatures, and as we would desire to be so deli-
vered, if we were in the like or any other extre-
mity; that we had done nothing for them,, but
what we believed they would have done for us if
vf& had Tte£h in*flieir case, and ttiey in our*s;rbut
VOL* II. JS
that we took them up to serve then), not to plun-
der them;^ and that it would be a most barbarous
thing, to take that little from them which they
had saved out of the fire, and then set them on
shore and leave them; that this would be first to
save them from death, and then kill thetn our-
selves ; save them from downing, and then aban-
don them to starving; and therefore I would not
let the least thing be taken from them. As to set-
ting them on shore, I told them, indeed, that was
an exceeding difficulty to us, for that the ship .was
bound to the East-Indies;, and though we wpre
driven out of our course to the westward a very
great way, which perhaps was directed by Heaven
on purpose for their deliverance, yet it was impos-
sible for us wilfully to change our voyage on this
particular account; noi; could my nephew, the cap-
tain, answer it to the freighters, with whom he was
under charter-party to pursue his* voyage by the
way of Brasil; aqd all I knew he could do for them
was, to put ourselves in the way of meeting with
other ships homeward-fround from the West-Indie^
and get them passage, if possible, to England or
Fiance.
The first part of the proposal was so generous
and kind, they could not but be very thankful for
it: but they were in a great consternation, espe*
cially the passenger?, at the notion of being car-
j;ie4 away to the East-Indies; they tjaen entieated
me, tha^t seeing I was dsivefl so far to the west-
ward before J met with them, I would at lea^t
keep pp tlxe same cpur^e to the, banks pf New-
fonndland,, jwhgre it was gpssible,J might meet
with sbm^ ship or sloop that they might hire to
carry* them back to Canada, from whence they
came.
I thought this was but a reasonable request on
their part; and therefore I inclined to agree to it;
for indeed I considered, that to carry this whole
company to the East-Indies, would not only be an
intolerable severity to the poor people, but would
be ruining our whole voyage by devouring all our
provisions; so I thought it no breach of charter-
party, bul what an unforeseen accident made abso-
lutely necessary to us; and in which no one could
say we were to blame; for the laws of Goo and
nature^ would have forbid that we should refuse
to take up two boats full of people in such a dis-
tressed condition; and the nature of the thing as
well respecting ourselves as the poor people, ob-
liged us to see them on shore somewhere or other,
for their deliverance; so I consented that we would
carry them to Newfoundland, if wind and weather
would permit; and, if not, that I would carry
them to Martinico in the West-Indies.
The wind continued fresh easterly, but the wea-
ther pretty good; and as it had bio wed continually
in the points between N. E. and S. E. a longtime,
we missed several opportunities of sending them to
France; for we met several ships bound to Europe,
whereof two were French, from St. Christopher's;
but they had been so long beating up against the
wind, that they durst take in no passengers for
fear of wan ting'provisions for thfer voyage, as well
for themselves as for those they should take in 5 so
jW£ were obliged to' go on. It faas^ about aVeek
E2
after this, that we madd the Batiks of Newfoutod*
land, where, ta shorten my story, we put all oup
French people on board a bark, which they hired
at sea there, to put them on shore, and afterwards
to carry them to France, if they could get provi-
sions to victual themselves with: when, I say, all
the French went on shore, I should remember,
that the young priest I spoke of, hearing we were
bound to the East-Indies, desired to go the voyage
with us, and to be set on shore on the coast of Co-
romandel/ I readily agreed to that; for I wonder-
fully liked the man, and had very good reason, as
will appear afterwards; also four of the seamen
entered themselves in our ship, and proved very
useful fellows.
From hence we directed our course for the West-
Indies, steering away S. and S. by E. for about
twenty days together, sometimes little or no wind
at all, when we met with another subject for our
humanity to woitk upon, almost as deplorable as
that befoie.
It was in the latitude of twenty-seven degrees
five minutes N.and the 19th day of March 1684-5,
when we espied a sail, our course S. E. and by S.
We soon perceived it was a large vessel, and that
she bore up to us; but could not at first know wha/t
to make of her, till, after comirig a little nearer,
we found she had lost her mah>top-ma$t, fore-
mast, and bowsprit; and presently she fires a gun
as a signal of distress; the weather was pretty good,
wind at N. Ni W» a fresh* gale, and we soon came
to speak with her.
We found, lier a ship of Bristol bound* home frain
Bai&$dQ£$/bttt bad been* blown* out of the road at
Barbadoes, a few daysibefore she was ready to sail,
by ft,terrible hurricane, while the captain, and chief
mate wfre both gone on shone; so that beside the
terror? of the storm, they were but in an indifferent
case for good artists to bring-the ship home: they
had been already nine weeks at sea, and had met
with another terrible storm after the hurricane was
oyer/ which had blown them quite out of their
knowledge to the westward, and in which they
had lost their masts as above; they told us, they
expected to have seen the Bahama islands, but
were then driven away again to the south-east by
by a strong. gale of wind at N. N- W. the same
that blew now, and having no sails to woik the
ship with, but a main course, and a kind of square
sail upon a jury forecast, which they had set up>
they could not lie near the wind, but were endea-
vouring to stand away for the Canaries*
But that which was worst x*f aU, was, that they
were almost starved for want of provisions, besides
the fatigues they bad undergone; their bread and
flesh wais quite gone^ jthey had Jiot an ounce left in
the ship, and had had *mne for eleven days; the
only relief they had, was, their water was not all
spent, and they had about half a barrel of flour
left; they had sugar.enough; some succades or
sweet-me^ts they had at first, but they were de-
voured, and-they, had seven casks of rum.
There was.anycmth and this mother,* and .a maid<-
servant, on board, who were going passengers,
and thinkingvthe ship was leady to sail, unhappily
came pn board the evening before jtheiJmrjrkane
began; and, having no provkiohs of tft&r frwnleft;,
they were in a more deplorable condition than the
rest; for the seamen being reduced to such an ex-
treme necessity themselves, had no edmpassion,
we may be sure, for the poor passengers;'and they
were indeed in a condition that their misery is
very hard to desciibe.
I had perhaps not known this part, if my curio-
sity had not led me, the weather being fair, and the
wind abated, to go on board the ship: the second1
mate, who upon this occasion commanded1 the
ship, had been on board our ship; and he told me
indeed, that they had three passengers in th^
great cabin, that they were in a deplorable condi-
tion; nay, says he, I believe they are dead, fori
have heard nothing of them for above two days;
and I was afraid to inquire after them, said he, for*
I had nothing to relieve thetff with.
We immediately applied ourselves to give them
what relief we could spate; and indeed I had so
far over-ruled things with my nephew, that I
would have victualled them, though we had gone
away to Virginia, or any part of the coast of Ame-
rica, to have supplied ourselves; but there was no
necessity for that.
Butrnow they were in a new danger; for they
were afraid of eating too much, even of that little
we gave them; the mate or commander brought
six men with him in his boat; but these poor
wretches looked like skeletons, and were so weak,
they could hardly sifrto th&r oars: the mate him-
self was ver£ ill/drid half-starved; for he declared
he had reseiVed nbtfein^'froin the> mfeffi, and w£nt
share and share alilfe with them in every hit they
eat. , f
I cautioned him to eat sparingly, hut set meat
hefore him immediately, and he had not eaten
three mouthfuls before he began to be sick, and
out of order; so he stopt awhile, and our surgeon
mixed him up something with some broth, which
he said would be to him both food and physic;
and, after Jie had taken it, he grew better; in
the mean time I forgot not the men; I ordered
victuals to he given them, and the poor crea-
tures rather devoured than eat it; they were so
exceeding hungry, that they were in a manner ra-
venous, and had no command of themselves; and
two of them eat with so much greediness, that
they were in danger of their lives the next morn-
ing.
The sight of these people's distress was very mov-
ing to me, and brought to mind what I had a terri-
ble prospect of at my first coming on shore in my
island, where I had gfot tfye lea$t mouthful of food,
or any hopes Qf procuring it; besides the hourly
apprehensioi\ I had of bei^g made the food of other
creatures. But all the while the mate was thus re-
lating to me the miserable condition of the ship's
company, I could not put out of my thought the
story he had told me of the three poor creatures in
the great cabip; (viz,) the piqther, her son, and
the maidjse^va^nt^ whom he had heard nothing of
for twc? or three day§; and, whon> he seamed to
confess they had .wjip^ly, n^gjectesd^ their own ex-
tremities, being s^ gr^ ^by^hic^ J und^stpod,

^uc^ thatrthere%e they m^st ^ peiwhedv'ftvchbe
all lying dead perhaps on^e.floQr o^4,eplf pfrtfoe
cabin.
As I therefore kept the matei, whom ^e * tfyea
called captain, on board with his meji to -refresh
them, sp I also forgot not the starving cre*s*4h&t
were left on board, but< ordered'my owiv boa$ 4o
go on board the>slup, a,nd^ith my rpat^a%d(tw&lv^
men to carry them a sacl£ of bread, ajidtfojjfngp
five pieces of beef to boil. Our suj*g£($i^]>agg<gd

caution he preserved the men, who ;svoul<^ ofcfee^v
wise have killed themselves with that veajy Soofi
that was given thejm on pi^ppse.tosave^hpir lives*
At the same time, I ordered the mate tp go into
the great ca.bin, and, seeri$Avbatcondition thq poor
passengers were ihj, and, if tifeey^wpieaiiv^ toao$n-
fort them $nd giy,e $iem ^h^t-rpfeshmentwas

I found the poor men on board almost in fc
ttimult to get the victuals out of the boiler before
it was ready: but my mate observed his order,
and kept a good guard at the cook-room door;
and- the itian he placed there, after using all possi-
ble persuasidn to have patience, kept them off by
force: however, he cattsed some biscuit cakes to
be dipped in the pot, and softened them with the
liquor of the meat, which they call brewis, and
gave them every one one, to stay their stomachs,
and told them it was for their own safety, that
he was obliged to give them but little at a time.
But it was all in vain, and had I not come on
bdard,faird their own commander and officers with
me, and with good words, and some threats also
of giving them no more, I believe they would have
broke into the cook room by force, and tore the
meat out of the furnaefe; for words indeed are of
a very small force to an hungr^ beily: however
we pacified them, antJ fed them gradually and cau-
tiously for the first time, and the next time gave
them more; afcid at last filled thefr bellies, and the
men did well endugh.
But the misery of the poor passengers in the
cabin wa§ of another nature, and far beyond the
rest; for as, first, the ship's company had so little
for themselves, nt was but too ttue, that they had
at first kfcpt thefti very low, and at last totally
nfeglectfcd theth; s6 that fot six or seven days, it
inif ht be said, 'they h&d really had no food at all,
and for several days beftfre veiy little.
The poof imother, >tfho, *Wr the first mate re-
potted) was a woman of good^setis^J £hd gotod
VOL, IT. F
bfeedrtig, had spared all she could get so affection-
ately for her son, that at^lalsthshe entirely sunk
under it: and when the mate of our ship went in,
she set upon the floor or deck, with her back up
against the sides, between two chairs,) which were
lashed fast, and her head sunk in between her
shoulders, like a corpse, though not quite .dead.
My mate said all he could to revive and ?enc®u-
rage her, and with a spoon put sbme b^otih! into
her mouth: she opened her lips, and*lifted*wpbone
hand, but could not speak: y*et> shecundeiktbod
what he said, and made signs tor hiuv m$m$&mg,
that it was too late for her; but pointedrtQ*hm
child, as if she would have jsaid;^ they jsliojuidjteke

However the mate, who was exceedingtymoved
with the sight, endeavoured to get some of the
T>roth into her mouth; and, as he said, got two or
three spoonfuls, down, though I question whether
he could be sure of it or hoU but it was too late,
and she died the same night.
The youth, wfeo was preserved at the price of
his most affectionate mother^ life,1 «was aaot so far
gone; yet he lay in a cabin-bed as one stretched
out, with hardly any life left in him; he bad a
piece of an old glove in his mouth, .having eaten

The young ted was about seventeen *yeai?s of

and, as, it seems, had io^t his father hu<t*ai $&$
months before, at Barbadoes, He begged ©f^the

hogsheads of sugar, which could not be removed,

< We beat about a great while, and went oti shore
on seveiai islands in the mouth of the great river
Oroonoque, but nonfe for my purpose; only this I
learned by my coasting the shore, that I was imdfcr
one gr£at mistake before, viz. that the continent
which I thought I saw from the island I lived* ill,
was really no continent, but a long island, or rather
a ridge of islands reaching from one to the Other
side of the extended mouth of *that great iffer;
and that the savages who came to my island, wetfe
not properly those which we call Caribbees,' but
islanders, and other Barbarians' of the same lrincf,
who inhabited soniething nearer to dnr -side tlteii
the re&t.
In short, I visited several of tbe islands to no
purpbse; some I found were inhabited, and some
were not. On one oi* them I found kome Spaniards,
and thought they had lived then; but speaking
with them, found thfey had a sloop lay in a small
creek hard by, arid that they came ihither to make
salt, and catch some pearl-muscles, if they could;
but they belonged to the Isle dfc Trinidad, which
lay farther north, in the latitude of 10 and i)

of the place; so I brought the ship.safe to an an-
chor, broadside with the little creek where.was
my old habitation.
As soon as I saw the place, I called for Friday,
and asked him if he knew where he was? He
looked about a little, and presently clapping his
hands, cried, O yes, O there, O yes, O there!
pointing to our old habitation, and fella dancing
and capering like a mad fellow; and I had much
ado to keep him from jumping into the sea, to
swim ashore to the place.
Well, Friday, said I, do you think we shall find
any body here, or no? and what do you think, shall
we see your father? The fellow stood mute as a
stock a good while; but when I named his father,
the poor affectionate creature looked dejected;
and I could see the tears run down his face very
plentifully. What is the matter, Friday, said I ?
are you troubled because you may see your father?
No,:.no, says he, shaking his head, no. see him
more, no ever more see again. Why so, said I, Fri-
day? how do you know that? O no, O no, says
Friday, he long ago die; long ago, he much old
man. Well, well, said I, Friday, you don't know:
but shall we see any one else then? The fellow, k
-seems, had better eyes than I, and he .points just
to the hill above my old house; and though we
lay half a league off, he cries out, Me see! me see!
yes, yes, jne see much man there, and therer and

caused the English ancient to be. spread, aUKi fined

and about half a quarter of an< hotor after, we per-
ceived a smoke rise from the side of the creek; $®
I immediately, ordered a boat out, taking FrMay
>with me; and, hanging out a white flag, or & flag
of truce, I went directly on shore, taking with me
the young friar I mentioned, to whom I had told
the whole story of my liying there,, and the mpti*-
merrof it, and every particular, botlrofasnyself, and
^.pd.those that I left there; and who was ©u th#t

like an arrow out of a bow. It would have made
any man shed tears, in spite of the firmest resolu-
tion, to have seen the first transports of this poor
fellow's joy, when he came to his father; how he
embraced him, kissed him, stroked his face took
him up in his arms, set him down upon a tree, an
lay down by him; then stood and looked at h
as any one would look at a strange picture, for a
quarter of an hour together; then lay down upon
the ground, and stroked his legs and kissed them,
and then got up again, and stared at him; one
would have thought the folly bewitched; but it
would have made a dog laugh to see how the next
day his passion run out another way: in the morn-
ing he walked along the shore, to-and-again, with
his father, several hours, always leading him by
the hand, as if he had been a lady; and every now-
and-then would come to fetch something or other
for him from the boat, either a lump of sugar or
a dram, a biscuit, or something or other that was
good. In the afternoon his frolics ran another
way; for then he would set the old man down upon
the ground, and dance about him, and made a
thousand antic postures and gestures; and all the
while he did this, he would be talking to him and
telling him one story or another of his travels, and
of what had happened to him abroad, to divert
him. In short, if the same filial affection was to be
found in Christians to their parents, in our parts
of the world, one would be tempted to say, there
hardly would have been any need of' the fifth
commandment i

It would be endless to take notice of all the cere-
monies and civilities that the Spaniards received
me with. The first Spaniard, whom, as I said, I
knew very well, was he whose life I saved: he
came towards the boat, attended by one more,
carrying a flag of truce also; and he did not only
not know me at first, but he had no thoughts, no
notion, of its being me that was come, till I spoke
to him. Seignior, said I, in Portuguese, do you
not know me? at which he spoke not a word; but
giving his musquet to the man that was with him,
threw his arms abroad, and saying something in
Spanish that I d.d not perfectly hear, came for-
ward and embraced me, telling me, he was inex-
cusable not to know that face again that he had
once seen, as of an angel from heaven sent to save
his live: he said abundance of very handsome
things, as a well-bred Spaniard always knows how;
and then beckoning to the person that attended
hjm, bade him go and call out his comrades. He
then asked me if I would walk to my old habita-
tion, where he would give me possession of my
own house again, and where I should see there had
been but mean improvements. So I walked along
with him; but, alas! I could no more find the
place again, than if I had never been there; for
they had planted so many trees, and placed them
in such a posture, so thick and close to one ano-
ther, in ten years time they were grown so big,
that, in' short, the place was inaccessible, except
by such windings, ^arid blind ways, as they them-
selves only who madetHfem could find.
Talked theiii, What nWt! them upon all these for-
ti%f|i^s?fjH€ told me, I would say theie was
ijped enough pf it, when they had given an ac-
count h^w they had passed their time since their
arriving in the island, especially after they had the
misfortune to find that I was gone: he told me
he could not but have some satisfaction in my good
fortune, when he heard that I was gone in a good
ship, and to my satisfaction; and that he had of-
tentimes a strong persuasion, that one time or other
fee should see me again; but nothing that ever
befell him in his life, he said, was so surprising and
afflicting to him at first,^ as the disappointment he
V^cis under when he came back to the island, and
foui^d I was not there.
- As to the three Barbarians (so he called them)
that were left behind, and of whom he said he had
a long story to tell me; the Spaniards all thought
themselves much better among the savages, only
that their number was so small. And, says he,
had they been strong enough, we had been alt long
ago in purgatory; and with that he crossed himself
upon the breast But, Sir, says he, I hope you will
not be displeased, when I shall tell you how,
forced by necessity, we were obliged, for our own
preservation to disarm them, and making them our
subjects, who would not be content with being mo-
derately our masters, but would be our murderers.
I answered, I was heartily afraid of it when I left
them there; and nothing troubled ix^e at my parting
frQipi the island, but that they were not come back?

thing first, a^d left the 9tjherf in a ptate of subjec-

what nation they were of; bat he m&de all eleW

which I left the island, and which the persons wer*

sary to repeal that I had sent away Friday's fa-
ther and th£ Spaniard, the two whose lives I had
re§Qu#$l from the savages; I say, I had sent the*
avf#yjn a large canoe to the main, asl then thought '
iti tQ fetch over the Spaniard's companions, wfeoift
h§ had l£ft behind him, in order to save them from1
the^hke calamity that he had been hi; and in ortter
to succour them for the present, and that; if pos-
sible, we might together find some w&)£ fc¥ out
deliverance afterward, " ! *
When I sent them away, Iihad no visible appear-
ance of9 or. the least room to hope for, xhy bwn
deliverance, anymore than I hadtwentyyearsObe*
fore; much less hajl I any foreknbwledge of vrtiat
after happened, I mean of an English shftp doming
on shore there to fetch them off; and it cotild not
but be a very great surprise to them, v(rMn they'
can*$ bacJtjvHot only to find that I was^gofce, bui
to £nd .three strangers leftim the spo% pbsdessdd
of ,3lli tbaf I )i»4 left behind 3tt$$ which vto&&'
otherwise have been their owa». *
ThejSrst.thhig, however^ wfaieb L^uifled int<^
(that I aright begiaw*here I left qff^ jfMvfttftfilir
own part: and I desired he would give,roe^p^jti-
ciilar account"of his voyage backf to his country-
men with the boat, when I sent him to fetch tl\eml
over. He told me there was little variety in tljat
part; for nothing remarkable happened to them
on the way, they having very calm weather, and a
smooth sea; for his countrymen, it could not be
doubted, he said, but that they were overjoyed to
see him (it seems he was the principal man among
them, the captain of the vessel they had been ship-
wrecked in, having been dead some time): they
were, he said, the moie surprised to see him, ber
cause they knew that he was fallen into the hand?
of savages, who, they were satisfied, would
devour him, as they did all the rest of their pri-
soners; that when he told them the story of the
deliverance, and in what manner he was furnished
for carrying them away, it was like a dream to
them: and their astonishment, they said, was some-
thing like that of Joseph's brethren, when he told
them who he was, and told them the story of his
exaltation in Pharaoh's court: but when he shewed
them the arms, the powder, the ball, and the pro-
visions that he brought them for their journey or
voyage, they were restored to themselves, took a
jast share of the joy of their deliverance, and im-
mediately prepared to come away with him.
Hieir first business was to get canoes; arjd in
tliis they were obliged not to sticfc so much upon
the honest p^art of it, but to trespass upon their
friendly savages,' and to borrow t^o large canoesij
or periaguas^on pfretsnce or going oata-fishing, or
for pleasure.
In these they came away the next morning; it
seems they wanted no time to get themselves
ready, for they had no baggage, neither clothes,
or provisions, or any thing in the world, but what
they had on them, and a few roots to eat, of which
they used to make their bread.
They were in all three weeks absent, and in that
time, unluckily for them, I had the occasion
offered for my escape, as I mentioned in my other
part; and to get off from the island; leaving three
of the most impudent, hardened, ungoverned, dis-
agreeable villains behind me, that any man could
desire to meet with, to the poor Spaniards' great
grifef and disappointment, you may be sure
The only just thing the rogues did, was, that
when the Spaniards came on shoie, they gave my
letter to them, and gave them provisions, and
other relief, as I had ordered them to do; also they
gave them the long paper of directions, which I
had left with them, containing the particular me-
thods which I took for managing every part of my
life there; the way how I baked my bread, bred up
my tame goats, and planted my corn; how I cured
my grapes, made my p9ts, and, in a word, every
thing I did: all this being written down, they
gave to the Spaniards, two of whom understood En-
glish well enough; nor did they refuse to accom-
modate the Spaniards with any thing else, for they
agffeetf Vfcry \frell for some time,: they gave them
annual &dmfs&ton into the |iouse, or cave, and
they begata1 to live vefy sociabty; and the head
Spfcnkfd, Wfod had^seeti* pretty nhueh of ^y me-
thod, and Friday's father together, managed ^ all
4H %Wi'' aftbv a iS v m ft k es
their affairs; for, as for the Englishmen, they did
nothing but ramble about the island, shoot parrots,
and catch tortoises, and when they came home af
night, the Spaniards provided their suppers for
them.
The Spaniards would have been satisfied with
this, would the other but have left them alone;
which, however, they could not find in their hearts
to do long; but, like the dog in the manger,
they would not eat themselves, and would not let
others eat either: the differences, nevertheless, were
at first but trivial, and such as are not worth re-
lating; but at last it broke out into open war, and
it began with all the rudeness and insolence that
can be imagined, without reason, without provoca-
tion, contrary to nature, and indeed to common
sense; and though it is true, the first relation of it
came from the Spaniards themselves, whom I may
call the accusers, yet when I came to examine the
fellows* they could not deny a word of it.
But before I come to the particulars of this part,
I'must supply a defect in my former relation; and
this was, that I forgot to set down among the rest,
that, just as we were weighing the anchor to set
sail, there happened a little quarrel on board our
ship, which I was afraid once would turn to a se-
cond mutiny; nor was it appeased till the captain,
"r6usmg* up his courage, and taking us all to his
assistance, parted them by force, and making two
of the most refractory fellows prisoners, he laid
thetn in ironsj artel as they had been active in the
former disorders, and let fall some ugly dangerous
words the second time, he threatened to carry
them in icons to England, and have them banged
tfcere far mutiny and running away with the
ship.
• This, it seems, though the captain did not intend
to do, it frighted some other men in the ship; and
,somp of them h$d put it in the heads of the rest,
that the captain only gave them good words for
the present, till they should come to some English
port; and that then they should be all put into
a gaolf and tried for their lives.
The mate got intelligence of this, and acquainted
lis with it; upon which it was desired, that I, who
Still passed for a great man among them, should
g& down with the mate, and satisfy the men, and
tell thera> that they might be assured, if they be-
Jiaved well the rest of the voyage, all they had
done for the time past should be pardoned. So I
went, and after passing my honour's .word to them,
they appeared sasy, and the more so, when I caused
the two men who were in irons, to be released and
forgiven.
But this mutiny had brought us to* an anchor
for that night, th$ wind also falling calm; ne&t
morning we founds that our two men who had
been laid in irons, had stole each of them, a mus-
ket, and some other weapons; what power or shot
th$y had, we knew not; and had taken the ship's
pinnace, which was not yet haled up, and run
away with her to their companions in roguery on
shore, / * * % , >-
As soon as be found this* I ordered the long-
boat on shore, with twelve men and the tnatev aiid
vol. ii. a
neither find ' them, nor any of th£ rest; for they^alt
fled into the w*oods when they Saw the boat eoming*
on shore. The mate was once resolved, in justice*
to their roguery, to have destroyed their planta-
tions, burnt all their household-stuff and furniture,
and left them to shift without it; but having no*
order, he let all alone, left every thing as they
found it, and bringing the pftinace away, canae ort
board without them.
These two men made their number five; but th®
other three villains were so much wickeder than
these, that after they had been two or three days
together, they turned their two new-comers on £ of
doors to shift for themselves, and would have no-
thing to do with them; nor could they for a good
while be persuaded to give them any food; as for
the Spaniards, they were not yet come.
When the Spaniards came first on shore, the
business began to go forward; the Spaniards would
have persuaded the three English brutes to have
taken in their two countrymen again, that, as they
said, they might be all one family; but they would
not hear of k: so the two poor fellows lived by
themselves; and finding nothing but industry and
application would make them live comfortable, they
pitched their tents on the north shore of the island,
but~a little more to the west, to be out of the clan-
ger of the savages, who always landed on the east
parts of the island*
Here they built two huts, one to lodge in, and
the other to by up ! their magazines and stores in;
and the Spaniards haVitig^iven'.tfafera' some goto

had kit them* they dug and planted, and enclosed,
after tfaepattern I had set for thjem all, and began
tQjlive pretty well Their first crop of corn was
on the ground, and though it was but a little bit
of land which they had dug up at first, having
had but a little time, yet it was enough to relieve
them, and find them with bread or other eatables;
and one of the fellows, being the cook's mate of
the ship, was very ready at making soup, puddings,
and su$h other preparations, as the rice and the
#ylk, and such little flesh as they got, furnished
hi#* t% do.
(cTh$y were going on in a little thriving posture,
W>heUfthe three unnatural rogues, their own coun-
tl^men-too, in mere humour, and to insult them,
eame and bullied them, and told them the island
was theirs; that the governor, meaning me, had
given them possession of it, and nobody else had
any right to it; and, damn them, they should
build no houses upon their ground, unless they
would pay them rent for them.
The two men thought they had jested at first;
and asked them to come and sit down, and see what
fine houses they were that they had built, and tell
them what rent they demanded: and one of them
merrily told then^ if they were ground-landlords,
4*e hoped if thsy built tenements upon the land,

the hfi^t men had made a fire to dtess their tsfe*
tubals, he takes a fire-brand and slaps it td the Wirt-
side of their hut, and very fairly set it on fire; atid
it would have been all burnt down in a few minutes,
if one of the two had not run to the fellow, thrust
him away, and trod the fire out with his feet, and
that not without same difficulty too*
The fellow was in such a rage at the honest
man's thrusting him away, that he turned np6n
him with a pole he had in his hand* and bad' no*
the man avoided the blow very nimbly, and ruift
into the hut, he had ended his day sat once, Hik

in after him, and immediately they came* both out
with their muskets -, and the man'that wasitfiftft
struck at with the pole, knocked the fellow down*,
who began the quarrel, with the stock of the mus-
quet, and that hefpre the other two could come to
help hiipi-y and then seeing the tfesfc come at them,
they stood together, and presenting the other ends
of their pieces to them, bade them stand off.
The others had fire-arms with them too; but
one of the two honest men, bolder than his conf-
rade, and made desperate by his danger, told them,
if they offered to move hand or foot, they were all
dead men; and boldly commanded them to lay
down their arms. They did not indeed lay dowfr
their arms; but, seeing him resolute,* it brought
them to a parity* and they consented to take1
their wovjnd^ed man.with them^and^be gone; and
indeed, §t> $eems the fellow wasi wounded suffi-1

But not to crowd this part with an accdtantoF
thef lesser part o£ their rogueries,- such as treading
down their corn, shooting three young kids, and
aoshfr-goat, .which'the poor men had got to breed

^>fjn night and jday in this manner, it forced the
t$8© jnefl to snch a desperation,* that they resolved
t%fighfrthem^kthree the first time they had a feir
opportunity. In order to this, they resolved te go
to? 'the castle, as they called it, that was lmy old
dwelling, where the three rogues^ndthe Spaniards
all lived together at that tim% intending to have
a fair battle, and the Spaniards should stand hy to
see fair play. So* they^got up in^th^mo^&ing be-

However, as the two men had also a design
upon them, as I have said, though a much fairer
one than that of burning and murdering, it hap-
pened, and very luckily, for them all, that they,
were up and gone abroad, before the bloody-
minded rogues came to their huts.
When they came thither and found the men
gone, Atkins, who it seems was the forwardest
man, called out to his comrades, Ha! Jack, here's
the nest; butd—n them, the birds are flown: they
mused a while to think what should be the occa-
sion of their being gone abroad so soon, and sug-
gested presently, that the Spaniards had given them
notice of it; and with that they shook hands, and
swore to one another, that they would be revenged
of the Spaniards. As soon as they had made this
bloody bargain, they fell to work with the poor
men's habitation; they did not set fire indeed to any
thing, but they pulled down both their houses, and
pulled them so limb from limb that they left not
the least stick standing, or scarce any sign on the
ground where they stood; they tore all their little
collected household-stuff in pieces, and threw
every thing about in such a manner, that the poor
men found, afterwards, some of their things a mile
off from their habitation.
When they had done this, they pulled up all the
young trees which the poor men had planted;
pulled lip^the, inclosure they had made to secure
their cattle and their corn; and, in a word, sacked
and plundered .everything,;as completely as a herd
of Tartars would "have done. ,
\ The two pen w£re at thLs jitnctiire gone to find
them but, and had resolved to fight tfyem wherever
they had been, though they were but .two or three:
so "that, bad tbey met, there certainly would have
btfen bloodshed among them; for they were all
v&ry stout, resolute fellows, to give them their
due.
But Providence took more care to keep them
asunder, than they themselves could do to meetr
fbtj^ they had dogged one another, when the three
w£re gone thither, the two were here; and after-
wklfds, when the two went back to find them, the
tlttfefe were'come to the old habitation again; we
sfratT s^e thei^ differing conduct presently. When
tntj'thj'&e came back, like furious creatures, flushed
\^?th the" rage which the work they had been ahout
p'tit them into, they came up to the Spaniards, and
told' them \vhat they had done, by way of scoff
and bravado; and one of them stepping up to one
of1 the Spaniards,, as if they had heen a couple of
boys at play, takes hold of his hat, as it was upon
his head, and giving it a twirl about, fleering m his
fafce, says he to him, And you, Seignior Jack Spa-
niard, shall have the saipe sauce, if you do not
mend your manners. The Spaniard who, though
qriite a civil man, was as brave as a man could de-
sire to be, and withal a strong well-made m^n,
Rooked steadily at him for a good while; and then,
ha^n£ tiD weapbn in his hand, stept gravely up to
hinif and with "One blow of his fist, knocked him
down, %s kti 6x is felled with a 'pole-axe, \t which
ofre of the rogues* itisoleitfr&s (lie first, fired his pis-
tol at the Spaniard immediately: }he miss"ed\iis

VOL. II. i
Mir, but one of them touched the tip of his ear,
and he bled pretty much. The blood made the
Spaniard believe he was more hurt than he really
was, and that put him into some heat, for before
he acted all in a perfect calm; but now resolving
to go through with his work, he stooped and took
the fellow's musquet whom he had knocked down,
and was just going to shoot the man wh6 had fired
at him; when the rest of the Spaniards, being in
the cave, came out, and calling to him not to shoot,
they stept in, secured the other two, and took
their arms from them.
When they were thus disarmed, and found they
had made all the Spaniards their enemies* as well
as their own?countrymen, they began to cool; and
giving the<Spa$iards better Words> would have had
their arms again; but the Spaniards, considering
the feud that was between th^m and the other two
Englishmen, and that itw6uld be the best method
they could take to keep them from one another,
told them they would do them no harm; and if
they would live peaceably they would be very wil-
ling to assist and associate with them, as they did
Veforej but that they could not think of giving
them their a/rms again, while they appeared so re-
solved to do mischief with them to their own
countrymen, and had even threatened them all to
make them their servants.
The rogues were now* more capable to hear rea
son than to aot r#as6n; but beitig refused their
arms, they went Having &W&y> and raging like mad-
men^ threatening what they would do, though they
had no fire*arcri&* but the Spaniards despising

their, threatening, told them they should take
care how they offered any injury to their plahtac-
tion or ,cattle; for if they did, they would shoot
them, as they would do ravenous beasts, wherever
they found them; and if they fell into their hands
3,Uve, they would certainly be hanged. However,
this was far from cooling them; but away they
went,'Swe&ring and raging like furies of hell. As
<soon as they were gone, came back the two men in
passion and rage enough also, though of another
kind;* for, having been at their plantation, and
finding it all demolished and destroyed, as above,
it will easily be supposed they had provocation
enough; they could scarce have room to tell their
tale, <the Spaniards were so eager to tell them
theirs; and it was strange enough to find, that
three men should thus bully nineteen, and receive
no punishment at all.
The Spaniards indeed despised them, and espe-
cially having thus disarmed them, made light of
their threatenings; hut the two Englishmen re-
solved to have their remedy against them, what
pains soever it cost to find them out,
But the Spaniards interposed here too, and told
them, that they were already disarmed; they could
not consent that they (the two) should pursue them
with fire-arms, and perhaps kill them: but, said
the grave Spaniard, who was their governor, we
will endeavour to make them do you justice, if
yw will leave it to us, for> -as tkere is no doubt
but they will come to us again when th^iinpassioi*
is over, being mot #ble to subsist without' oyir-as-

ihetn, wkhout having a full satisfaction for you;
and tipdn this condition we hopd you will promise
to useTio violence with them, other than in your
defence.
The two Englishmen yielded to this very awk-
wardly, and with great reluctance; but the Spa-
niards protested, they did it only to keep the!m
from bloodshed, and to make all easy at last, for,
said they, we are not so many of us; here is room
enough for us all, and it is great pity we should
not be all good friends. At length they did con-
sent, and watted for the issue of the thing, livihg
for some days with the Spaniards; for their &Hfrn
habitation was destroyed. k
In about five days time the three vagrantis, tired
With wandering, and almost starved with huftgfer,
having chiefly lived on turtles eggs all that while,
came back to the grove; aud finding my Spaniard,
who, as 1 have said, Hvas the governor, and two
'more with him, walking by the side of the creek,
they came up in a very submissive humble manner,
stntTbe£ged to be received again into the family.
'The Spaniards used them civilly, but told them,
they had acted so unnaturally by their country-
ihen^ arid so very grossly By them (the Spaniards),
that fhey could npt come to any conclusion with-
out consulting th6 two Englishmen, and the r£st;

After half an hour's consultation they were
called in, and a long debate had about them, their
, two countrymen charging them with the ruin of all
their labour, and a design to murder them; all
whiGh they owned before, and therefore could not
^ijeny now; upon the whole, the Spaniards acted the
t moderators between them; and as they had obliged
jftfeeftwo Englishmen not to hurt the three, while
i*they were naked and unarmed, so they now ob-
- l%ed the three to go and rebuild their fellows two
huts, one to be of the same dimensions, and the
t other, larger than they were before; also to fence
their ground again, where they bad pulled up the
fences,-plant trees Ln the room of those pulled up,
dig up^ the land again for planting corn, where
they had spoiled it; and, iu a word, to restore
every thing in the same state as they found it, as
near as they could; for entirely it could not be,
the season for the corn, and the growth of the

and study in the whole the good of the plantation,
they would be content to work for them, 3<ndttei
them walk about and be as idle as they pleased;
and thus having lived pretty well together for a
month or two, the Spaniards gave them their arms
again, and gave them liberty to go abroad with
them as before.
It was not above a week after they had these
arms, and went abroad, but the ungrateful crea-
tures began to be as insolent and troublesome, as
before; but however, an accident happened„pr$-
sently upon this, which endangered the safpty^Qf
them all; they were obliged to lay by $11 private
resentments, and look to the preservation of J;heir
lives.
It happened one night, that the Spaniard gpve*>
nor, as I call him, that is to say, the Spaniard
whose life I had saved, who was now the captain,
or leader, or governor of the rest, found himself
very uneasy in the night; and could by no means
get any sleep: he was perfectly well in body, as
he told me the story, only found h;s thoughts tu-
multuous; his mind ran upon men fighting, and
killing one another, but was broad awake, and
could not by any means get any sleep; in short,
he lay a great while; but growing more and more
uneasy, he resolved to rise: as they lay, being sO
many of them, upon goat-skins, laid thick upon
sudi couches and pads as they made themselves,
and'not in hammocks and styp-beds, as I did, whp
was but one, so the^ ljad little to do, when they
were willing to' rise, but to get up upon their fpet,
and perhapsput on a cpai,such as it'w^s,apdrtheir
pumps; and tHey were ready for goiqg aijy w^y
thai their tfiotigllts giiitf&' ffimu '
Berfig thus gotten up, he looked out; but, be-
ing dark, he could see little or nothing; and be-
sides, the trees which I had planted, as in my for-
mer account is described, and which were now
grown tall, intercepted his sight, so that he could
only look up, and see that it was a clear star-light
night; and, hearing no noise, he returned and
laid him dowti again; but it was all one, he could
ilot sleep, nor could he compose himself to any
tfiftig like rest, but his thoughts were to the last
degree uneasy, and yet he knew not for what.
iHaving made some noise with rising and walk-
ing about, going out and coming in, another of
thern waked, and, calling, asked who it was that
was tfp? The governor told him, how it had been
trithhrm. Say you so? says the other Spaniard;
Such things are not to be slighted, I assure you;
there is certainly some mischief working, says he,
near us; and presently he asked him, Where are
the Englishmen? They are all in their huts, says
he, safe enough. ' It seems the Spaniards had kept
possession of the mainapartment, and had made
a £lac^, where the three Englishmen, since their
last mutiny, always quartered by themselves, and
could not come at the rest. Well, says the Spa-
niard, there is something in it, I am persuaded
from my own experience; I am satisfied our spirits
embodied have converse withA and receive intelli^
gfenfce ffom, the spirits unembocfteel, and inhabit-
ing th£ invisible world; and this friendly notice is
given for our advantage, if we kno\jr liox^to make

tify our Wduble, I will tell you a story to the pur-
pose, that shall convince you of the justice of my
proposing it.
In a word, they went out to go to the top 6f
thfe hill, where I used to go; but they, being strong,
and ill good company, nor alone, as 1 was, used
none of my cautions to go up by the ladder, and
tben ptilling it up after them, to go up a second/
stage t6 the top, but were going round through
the grove unconcerned and unwary, when they4
were surprised with seeing a light as of fire, a very
little way off from them, and hearing theVofces
of men, not of one or two, but of a great number!"
In all the discoveries I had made of the savages
landing on the island, it was my constant care to*
prevent them rtrakirig the least discovery of there
being1 aby inhabitant upon the place; and when by
any necessity they came to know it, they felt it so
effectually, that t?hey that got aWay, were scarce
aMe to givfe any account of ft, for we disappeared
as s&onas possible, nor did ever any that had seen
me, .escape to tell'any one else, except it were the
three savages in (our last encounter, who jumped
into-the boal, of whom I mentioned that I was
afraitithey should go home, and bring more help*
' Whether it was the consequence of the escape
of those men, that so great a number came n6w to-
gether^ ()r whether they came ignorantly, and by
accident, oft their usual blobdy errand, the Spfr*
ttferds douldiiot' it fceetfts^understand; but what-
ever it* was,{ftthaH" lieeti^their- btfsi&ess, either to
have coticedled th^mfcetvH;* ^d ftot have seen
th&m abatl;.imifch !es&4b havejtetethe^v^g^s have
seen that there were any inhabitants in the place,
but to have fallen upon them so effectually, as
that not a man of them should have escaped, which
could only have been by getting in between them
and their boats; but this presence of mind was
wanting to them, which was the ruin of their tran-
quillity for a great while.
We need not doubt but that the governor, and
the man with him, surprised with this sight, ran
back immediately, and raised their fellows, giv-
ing them an account of the imminent danger they
were all in; and they again as readily took the
alarm, but it was impossible to persuade them to
stay close within where they were, but they rnus-
all run out to see how things stood.
While it was dark indeed, they were well
enough, and they had opportunity enough, for
some hours, to view them by the light of three
fires they had made at some distance from one ano-
ther; what they were doing they knew not, and
what to do themselves they knew not; for, first,
the enemy were too many; and, secondly, they
did not keep together, but were divided into seve-
ral parties, and were on shore in several places.
The Spaniards were in no small consternation at
this sight; and as they found that the fellows ran
straggling all over the shore, they made no doubt,
but, first or last, some of them would chop in upon
their habitation, or upon some other place, where
they would see the tokens of inhabitants; and they
were in great perplexity also for fear of their stock
of goats, which would have been little less than
starving them^if tltfy shouUbhave been destroyed;
vol, ir, k
so the first thing they resolved upon, was to dis-
patch three men away before it was light, viz. two
Spaniards and one Englishman, to drive all the
goats away to the great valley where the cave was,
and, if need were, to drive them into the very cave
itself.
Could they have seen the savages altogether in
one body, and at a distance from their canoes,
they resolved, if there had been an hundred of
them, to have attacked them; but that could not
be obtained, for there were some of them !two
miles off from the other, and, as it appeared after-
wards, were of two different nations
After having mused a great while on the course
they should take, and beaten their brains in consi-
dering their present circumstances, they resolved
at last, while it was dark, to send the old savage
(Friday's father) out as a spy, to learn, if possible,
something concerning them, as what they came
for, and what they intended to do, and the like;
the old man readily undertook it, and* stripping
himself quite naked, as most of the savages were,
away he went: after he had been gone an hour or
two, he brings word, that hehad been among them
undiscovered, that he found they were two par-
ties, and of tifro several nations, who had war with
one another, and had had a great battle in their
own country, and that both sides having had se-
veral prisoners taken in the fight, they were by
mere chance landed in the sarrffe island, for the de-
vouring^ their prisoners, arid mdking merry; but
their coming sb bf~ chalicfe td'the iaitie place, "had
spoiled all tMlrv ntiftlrj mt Hdtf^txtih * g»t
r^geat om ajjottueife and were so near, that he be-
lie«ed(they would fight again as soon as day-light
began to.appear; but he did not perceive that they
had any notion of any body's being on the island
but themselves. He had hardly made an end of
telling the story, when they could perceive, by
the unusual noise they made, that the two little
armies were engaged in a bloody fight.
, Friday's father used all the arguments he could
to persuade our people to lie close, and not be
<§een; he ,told them, their safety consisted in it,
and that they had nothing to do but to lie still,
and the savages would kill one another to their
^a,nds, and the rest would go away; and it was so
to a tittle. But it was impossible to prevail, espe-
cially upon the Englishmen; their curiosity was
sq importunate upon their prudentials, that they
must run out and see the battle; however, they
used some caution, viz. they did not go openly
just by their own dwelling, but went further into
the woods, ,and placed themselves to advantage,
where .they might, securely see them manage the
fight, and, as they thought, not to be seen by them;
but it seems the savages did see them, as we shall
find hereafter,
The battle was very fierce, and if I might be-
lieve the Englishmen, one of them said, he could
perceive, that }some of them were men of great
bravqry* of invincible §pirits,/raud of great policy

weakest, and after some time mojse,, some of them
began to fly; and this put our men again intp, ^
great consternation, lest any of those that fted
should run into the grove, before their dwellings
for shelter, and thereby involuntarily discover the
place; and that by consequence the pursuers*
should do the like ia search for therm Upon, this-
they resolved, that they would stand armed within
the wall, and whoever came into the grove, they,
should sally out aver the waJJ, and. kill them; s4,
that,»if possible, not one should, return to give art?
account of it; they ordered also, that i<t should b$>
d<?ne with th£ir swords, or by knocking them doj$#}
with the &tock of the musquet, not by^shooti^

„ As they expected, it fell out; three of the i;owjfctf
ed army fled for life, and crossing the creeks ra&>
directly into the pkce, not in the least knowing
whither they went, but running a* into* a thick
wood for- shelter; thereout they kept to look,
aferoad gave notice of this within, with this ad-
dition to our< men's great sartisfaqtion, viz. That
the * conquerors had not pursued them> w seen*
which way they were gone* Upon this the Spa^
niard governor, a man of humatiity, would not $u£*
fpr them to kHl the- three fugitives; but, sending
three men out by the top of the hi$, oldened them
to go round, and come in behind them, surprise
and JtWm them prisoners,! which* was -donej the re-

shouts> which they supposed were by way of tak
umph* an!d so the fight ended; and the same dayr
about three o'clock in the afternoon, they alsa
matched to their canoes. And thus the Spaniards
had their island again free to themselves, their
ftight was over, and they saw no savages in seve-^
i%1 years after.
After they were all gone, the Spaniards came*
dut of their den; and, viewing the field of battle^
they found about two-and-thirty dead men upon*
tfe^ SpoS; s?ome were killed with great long arrows,
sfevetel'ofi which were found sticking in their bo~
dl#s? b&fc mosfc of them were killed with theii^
gr^at wooden swords^ sixteen or seventeen o£
whi£h they found in the field of battle, and as*
maify bows, with a< great many arrows; these
swords* were great unwieldy things, and they mnsfc
bfc very strongmen tliat used them: most of those
men that were killed with them had their- heads*
nUashed to pieces, aa we may say, or, sis we call it
in English, their* brains knocked out, and several
of their arms and kgs broken; so that it is evident
they fight with inexpressible rage and fury; they
found not ofce wounded man that was not stone
dead; for either they stay by their enemy till
they have quite killed them, or they carry all the
wontirded men, that are not quite dead;, away with
Thi& deliverance tamed our Englishmen-for'^
great while: the aight had filled thenp with horrdiy*-

or other they shou-id fallen to .th^haiid^ of ^those
qre^tures^who iwould >nofc only kill them las ienc-
miesj hut kid(l them for food, as iwe^kill our cattle.
And they professed to me, that the/thoughts of
beiB?g eaten up like beef or mutton, though it was
supposed it was not to be till they were dead, had
something in it so horrible, that it nauseated their
very stomachs, made them sick when they thought
of it, and filled their minds with unusual ^terror,
that they were not themselves for some weeks^
after.
, This, as I said, tamed even the three English
brutes I have been speaking of; and, for_a great
while after, they were very tractable, and werife
about the common business of the whole society
well enough; planted, sowed, reaped, and begat*
to be all naturalized to the country; but some
time after this, they fell all into such simple mea-
sures again as brought them into a great deal of
trouble. ,
1 They had taken three prisoners, as I had ob-
served ; and these three being lusty stout young
fellows, they made them servants, and taught them
to work for them; and, as slaves, l they did well
enough; but they did not take their measures with
them, as I did by my man Friday, viz. to begin
with them upon the principle of hav ing saved their
lives, and then instructed them in the rational
principles of life, much less of religion, civilizing
and redncingjihem by kind usage, and affectionate
arguing*; *but, a# theyjgavd them their food ev&ry
day/so they*gave*them their workjtoo, and kept
jbhemtfully employed An<flrudge;ny enough; but they
failM in> this f(byAciV that itheyhuever h^d.them to
assist them and fight for them, as I had my man
Friday, who was as true to me as the very flesh
upon my bones.
But to come to the family part. Being all now
good friends (for common danger, as I said above,
had effectually reconciled them), they began to
consider their general circumstances; and the first
thing that came under their consideration was, whe-
ther, seeing the savages particulaily haunted that
side of the island, and that there were more remote
and retired paits of it equally adapted to their way
of living, and manifestly to their advantage, they
should not rather remove their habitation, and plant
in some more proper place for their safety, and es-
pecially for the security of their cattle and corn.
Upon this, after long debate, it vvas conceived,
that they should not remove their habitation; be-
cause that some time or other they thought they
might hear from their governor again, meaning
me: and if I should send any one to seek them, I
would be sure to direct them on that side, where,
if they should find the place demolished, they
would conclude the savages had killed us all, and
we were gone, and so our supply would go away
too.
But as to their corn and cattle, they agreed to
remove them into the valley where my cave was,
where the land was as proper to both, and where
indeed there wa&land enough: however, upon se-
cond thoughts, they altered one part of that reso-
lution too, and resolved only to remove part of
their cattle- thitheiy<aad7 plant part of their com
there; andiso, if one part .was destroyed^ the other
might be saved: and one piece of prudence they

ugedy which>it was very well they did; viz, ^hett

, But, however, they re$olve<jfc not to change tk®k
habitation; yet they agreed, that a*Jj had cwefyilfr
covered it ftrst with a wall and for*ifiDa|i©%^ii^

consisted entirely in their being £once^le<%*|!if
which they were now fully convinced^ft^ey^set^o
work to cover and conceal the place yet more ef^
fectiralty than, before; to this purpose, as I had
planted -trees (or rather thrust in stakes, which iri
time all grew to be trees) for some good distance
before the entrance in to my apaa-tmetit, they went
©n in the same manner, and filled up the rest of
that whole *space of ground, from the trees I had
set, sprite down to thd side of the creek, where> as I
said,-! landed my floats, and even into the very owe

into the plantation: as for that part which I had
planted, the* trees were grown as thick as a man's
thigh; and among them they placed so many other
sfeort ones,<and so thiek, that, in a word, it stood
like a palisado a quarter of a mile thick, and it was
nefct to impossible to penetrate it, but with a little
army, to cut it all down; for a little dog could
hardly get«between the trees, they stood so close, *
Mutt this was not<all; for they did the same by

and round even to fchfe top of the hill 5 leaving no

where I never went, for fear of being discovered*,
they were surprised with seeing above twenty
canoes of Indians just coming on shore.
They made the best of their way home, in
hurry enough; and giving the alarm to their com-
rades, they kept close all that day and the nfekt,
going out only at night, to make observation:
but they had the good luck to be mistaken; for
wherever the savages went, they did not land at
that time on the island, but pursued sortie other
design.
And now they had another broil with the three
Englishmen; one of which, a most turbulent fel-
low, being in a rage at oiie: of the three slaves,
which I mentioned they had taken, because the
fellow had not done something right which he
bid him do, and seemed a little untractable in his
shewing him, drew a hatchet out of a frog-belt, in
which he bore it by his side, and fell upon him,
the poor savage, not to correct him, but to kill
him. One of the Spaniards, who was by, seeing
him give the fellow a barbarous cut with the hat-
chet, which he aimed at his head, but struck into
his shoulder, so that he thought he had cut the
poor creature's arm off, ran to him, and entreating
him not to murder the poor man, clapped in be-
tween him and the savage, to prevent the mischief,
The fellow, being enraged the more at this,
struck at the Spaniard with his hatchet, and swore
he Would serve him'as he intended to serve the
savage; which the Spaniard perceiving, avoided
the blow, and with a shovel, which he had in his
hand (for they Were working" in the field about
the corn-land,) knocked the brute down: another
of the Englishmen, running at the same time to
help his comrade, knocked the Spaniard down;
and then two Spaniards more came to help their
man, and a third Englishman fell upon them.
The}/ had none of them any fire-arms, or any other
.weapons but hatchets and other tools, except the
third .Englishman; he had one of my old rusty
cutlasses, ,with which he made at the last Spaniards,
and ^wounded them both: this fray set the whole
family in an uproar, and more help coming in,
they took the three Englishmen prisoners. The
next question was, What should be done with
them? They had been so often mutinous, and were
so furious, so desperate, and so idle withal, that
they knew not what course to take with them,
for they were mischievous to the highest degree,
and valued not what hurt they did any man; so
that, in short, it was not safe to live with them.
The Spaniard who was governor, told them in
so many words, that if they had been his own
countrymen, he would have hanged them all; for
all laws, and all governors, were to preserve society;
and those who were dangerous to the society ought
to be expelled out of it; but as they were English-
men, and that it was to the generous kindness of
an Englishman that they all owed their preserva-
tion and deliverance, he would use them with all
possible lenity, and would leave them to the judg-
ment of the other two Englishmen, who were their
countrymen.
One of the two honest Englishmen stood up,
and said,,they desired it might not be left to them :
for, says he, I am sure we ought to sentence them
to the gallows; and with that gives an account
how Will Atkins, one of the three, had proposed
to have all the five Englishmen join together, and
murder all the Spaniards, when they were in their
sleep.
When the Spanish governor heard this, he calls
to Will Atkins. How, Seignior Atkins, says
he, Will you murder us all? What have you to say
to that? That hardened villain was so far from
denying it, that he said it was true, and G—d
d—mn him they would do it still before they had
done with them. Well, but Seignior Atkins, said'
the Spaniard, What have we done to you that you
will kill us? And what would you get by killing
us? And what must we do to prevent your killing
us? Must we kill you, or will you kill us? Why
will you put us to the necessity of this, Seignior
Atkins? says the Spaniard very calmly, and smil-
ing-
Seignior Atkins was in such a rage at the Spa-
niard's making a jest of it, that, had he not been
held by three men, and withal had no weapons with
him, it was thought he would have attempted to
have killed the Spaniard in the middle of all the
company*
This hare-brained carriage obliged them to con-
sider seriously what was to be done. The two
Englishmen and the Spaniard, who saved the poor
savage, wer£ of the opinion, that they should
hang one of the three for an example to the rest;
and that particularly it should be he that had
twice attempted to commit murder with his
hatchet; and indeed there was some reason to be-
lieve he had done it, for the poor savage was in
such a miserable condition with the wound he had
received, that it was thought he could not live.
But the governor Spaniard still said, No, it was
an Englishman that had saved all their lives, and
he would never consent to put an Englishman to
death, though he had murdered half of them; nay,
he said, if he had been killed himself by an En-
glishman, and had time left to speak, it should be,
that they should pardon him.
This was so positively insisted on by the gover-
nor Spaniardr that there was no gainsaying it; and,
as jnerciful counsels are most apt to prevail, where
they are so earnestly pressed, so they all came into
it; but then it was to be considered, what should
be done to keep them from the mischief they de-
signed; for all agreed, governor and all, that means
were to be used for preserving the society from
danger. After a long debate it was agreed, first,
That they should be disarmed, and not permitted
to> have either gun, or powder, or shot, or sword,
or any weapon, and should be turned out of the
society, and left to live where they would, and
how they could, by themselves; but that none of
the rest, either Spaniards or English, should con-
verse with them, speak with them, or have any
thing to do with them ; that they should be for-
bid to come within a certain distance of the place
where the rest dwelt; and that if they offered to .
commit any disorder,! so as to spoil, burn, kill, or
destroy any of the co^ plantings, , buildings,
fences, or cattle belonging to the society, thai
they should die without mercy, and would shoot
them wherever they could find them.
The governor, a man of great humanity, musing
upon the sentence, considered a little upon it; and
turning to the two honest Englishmen, said, Hold;
you must reflect, that it will be long ere they can
raise corn and cattle of their own, and they must
not starve; we must therefore allow them provi-
sions. So he caused to be added, That they should
have a proportion of corn given them to last them
eight months, and for seed to sow, by which time
they might be supposed to raise some of their own;
that they should have six milch-goats, four he-
goats, and six kids, given.them, as well for present
subsistence, as for a store; and that they should
have tools given them for their work in the*field;
such as, six hatchets, an axe, a saw, and the like.
But they should have none of these tools or provi-
sions, unless they would swear solemnly, that they
would not hurt or injure any of the Spaniards with
them, or their fellow Englishmen.
Thus they dismissed them the society, and
turned them out to shift for themselves. They
went away sullen and refractory, as neither con-
tented to go away or to stay; but, as there was no
remedy, they went, pretending to go and choose
a place where they should settle themselves, to
plant and live by themselves; and sojne provisions
were given, but no weapons*
About four or five days after, they came again
for some victuals, and gave the governor an ac-
count where they had pitched their tents, and
marked themselves out an habitation or planta-
tion; it was a very convenient place indeed, on
the remotest part of the island, N. E. much about
the place where I providentially landed in my first
voyage, when I was driven out to sea, the Lord
alone knows whither, in my foolish attempt to sur-
round the island.
Here they built themselves two handsome huts,
and contrived them in a manner like my first ha-
bitation, being close under the side of a hill, hav-
ing some trees growing already to the three sides
of it; so that by planting others, it would be very
easily covered from the sight, unless narrowly
searched for; they desired some dry goat skins for
beds and covering, which were given them; and
upon their giving their words that they would not
disturb the rest, or injure any of their plantations,
they gave them hatchets, and what other tools
they could spare; some pease, barley, and rice, for
sowing, and, in a word, any thing they wanted
but arms and ammunition.
They lived in this separate condition about six
months, and had got in their first harvest, though
the quantity was but small, the parcel of land they
had planted being but little; for indeed, having
all their plantation to form, they had a great deal
of work upon their hands; and when they came
to make boards, and pots, and such things, they
were quite out of their element, and could make
nothing of it; and when the rainy season came on,
for want of a cave in the earth, they could not keep,
their grain dry, and it was in great danger of spoil-
ing: and this humbled them muchj; so they came
and begged the Spaniards to help them, which
they very readily did; and in four days worked a
great hole in the side of the hill for them, big
enough to secure their corn, and other things front
the rain; but it was but a poor place at best, conv
pared to mine; and especially as mine was then;
for the Spaniards had greatly enlarged it, and madie
several new apartments in it.
About three quarters of a year after this separa*
tion, a new frolic took these rogues, which toge-
ther with the former villany they had committed,
brought mischief enough upon them, and had very
near been the ruin of the whole colony; the three
new associates began, it seems, to be weary of the
laborious life they led, and that without hope1 of
betteringf their circumstances; and a whim1 took
them, that they would make a voyage to the con-
tinent from whence the savages came, and would
try if they could not seize upon some prisoners
among the natives there and bring them home, so
as to make them do the laborious part of the work
for them.
The project was not so preposterous, if they
had gone no further; but they did nothing, and
proposed nothing, but had either mischief in the
design, or mischief in the event: and, if I may
give my opinion, they seemed to be under a blast
from Heaveh; for if we will not allow a visible
curse to pursue visible crimes, how shall we recon*
cile the events of things with divine justice? It
was certainly an apparent vengeance on their crime
of mutiny and piracy, that brought them to the
state they were in; and, as tliey shewed not the
least remorse for the crime, but added new villa-
nie& toity &n<?b as, particularly, that piece of mon±
strous cruelty of wounding a poor slave, because
be did not, or perhaps could not, understand to do
what he was directed; and to wound him in such
a, manner, as, *io question,' made him a cripple all
hii-life* *and<iti a place where no surgeon or medi-
cine could be had for his-cure: and, what was -still
wovse* the murderous intent; or, to do justice to
the* drime, -the intentional murder, for such to be
s,ia#e ik was, as was .afterwards the formed de$iga.
they all laid, to murder the Spaniards-in eold blood,
a?fid4n their sleep* *
' But I leay-e observing, and return to the story":
The three fellows catne down to Jfche Spaniards one
morning, 'and, in very humble teran*, desired to be
admitted «to speak with them: theSpaniards very*
$&djly heard what they had to s^y, which was
this: that they we^e tired of living in the manner
they did; that they were net imndy enough to
make the necessaries tMy waiitgd;* and that, hav-
ing no help, they found they should be sta#ved;
but if the Spaniards would ^give'theife&ave to take
one of the canoes which they oanie over mf kmd
give them arms and ammunition, ^proportioned for
tkeir defence, they* would go over to the, main,
and seek theipfoi^tune, and so deliver them from
the trouble of supplying them with any other pro*
visions.*

o£prophecy, teill them, that'theywould b# starved
ar murdered; and bade them consider of it.
The men replied audaciously, they should be
starved if they stayed here, for they could not
work, and would not work; and they could but
be starved abroad; and if they were murdered,
there was an end of them, they had no wives or
children to cry after them; and, in short, insisted
importunately upon their demand^ declaring that
they would go, whether they would give them
any arms or no.
The Spaniards told them, with !gi*eat' kindness,
that if they were resolved to go, they should not
go like naked men, and be in no condition to^de-
fend themselves; and that though they could ill
spare their fire-arms, having not enough for them-
selves, yet they would letthem have two musqufets,
a pistol, and a cutlass/ and each man a hatchet,
which they thought sufficient for thefri*
In a word, they accepted the offer; and having
baked them bread enough* to serve them a month,
a^iid given them as rpuch goat's flesh as they could
eat whilejt was'sweet, and a great-basket full of
iJried' grapes, a, pot full of fresh water, *and a
young kid alive to kill, they boldly set oivt m a

drie4^hieh they-had sowed or laced together;
and away they>went merrily enough: the,Spaniards
called after, them, Bon Veajo; and no man ever
thought of seeing them any more.
The Spauiards would often say to one another,
and the two honest Englishmen who remained be-
hind, how quietly and comfortably they Jived,
noiy -those three turbulent fellows were gone; as
fp?r thsir ever coming again, that was the remotest
thipg tfrom .their thoughts could be imagined;
when, behold, after twenty-two days absence, one

A}waymns the Englishman, as if he was b&-
witched* and became* -frighted and amazed, to the
governor Spaniard, and tells him they were all unr
done, for there were strangers landed upon the
island, he could* not tell who** the Spaniard pausing

not tell who? They tare. savages *to be snre. No,

with ar^is?. ^Nay their, says the Spaniard, why are
you concerned? If they are not savages* they must
be £rj^cK}s$ilar there ^is no Christian nafcion^upon
earth, but will do us good rather than harm.
WhUM*h^hweice debating thus, came the three

V&TOfthejr voices, and so all the womdinof that
ki&d jce&s^d.^JJ^t &©w th© admiration was tMaed
upon another question, viz. What could be the
matter, and what made them come back again?
It was not long before they brought the men
in; and inquiring where? they had been, and what
they had been doing? They gave them a full ac-
count of their voyage in a few Avords, viz. That
they reached the land in two days^ or something
less; but finding the people,alarrroed at their earn-
ing, and preparing with hows and arrows to fight
them* they durst not go on shore, but sailed on to
the northward six or seven .hours, till they came
to a great opening, by whieh> they perceived* that
the land they saw* fnom our island was not the
main, but an island; that entering that opening
of the sea, they saw another island on the5 right
hand north, and several more west; and being re-
solved tp land somewhere* they >pnt over to one of
the* islands which ky west, and went boldly on
shore; that they found the people were courteous
aqd fiiendly to them,, and they gave them several
roots, and some dried .fish, and appeared very so-
ciable; and the women, ras>weH as the men, were
very forward to supply, Jthem wit& any thing they
qould get for them to eat, and* brought it to them
a grieat way upon their heads, , !
They continued heie four days, and inquired,
as well as they could of them by signs> what na-
tions wei;e thi$ way, and thafway? and were told
of s£ver*4 fierce and terrible, people, that lived
almost €very way;, who, as they anade 'known by
signs to them, used to eat men; but as for them-
selves, they said, ,that they -never eat mentor wo-

mea^ extj^pt tnily such as they took in the wars;
an A then they owned, that they made a great feast,
and eat their prisoners.
jnTbei Englishmen inquired, when they had a
feast ;of that kind; and they told them two moons
ago, pointing to the moon, and then to two fingers;
and that their great king had two hundred pri-
§0j&ecs *now, which lie had taken in his war; and
they were feeding them to make them fat for the
Heart* fea&t. nThe Englishmen seemed mighty de-
mwm to see those, prisoners; but the others mis-
taking) them, thought they were desirous to have
some ©£ them to carry away for their own eating.
Six ii^ey beckoned to them, pointing to the setting
©£ the sun, and then to the rising; which was to
signify** that the next morning, at sun-rising, they
would bring some for them; and accordingly, the
next morning, they brought down five womfen,
and eleven men; and gave them to the English-
men, to carry with them on their voyage, just as
we would bripg so many cows and oxen down to
a sea-port town, to victual a ship.
As brutish and barbarous as these felLows were
at home, their stomachs turned at this sight, and
they did not know what to do: to refuse the pri-
$©nfirs)W€mld have been the highest affront'to the
savage-g<entry that offered them; and what to do
T^teJj&efa*,they knew not; however, upon sortie

with: and then, tying the poor creatures handsr
behind them, they (the people) dragged the' pri-
soners into the boat for our meno » i ' »
The Englishmen were obliged to come away as
soon as they had them, or else they that gave them
this noble present, Would certainly have expected
that they should have gone to work ,wifch them,
have killed two or three of them the next morn»gy
and perhaps have invited the donors to dinner.
But, having taken their leave with all the.ro>*-
spect and thanks that could well pass between*
people, where, on either side, they understood u0$
one word they could say, they put off with their
boat, and came back towards the first island, WhereJ
when they arrived, they set eight of their prisoners
at liberty, there being too many of them for thei#
occasion. >>
In their voyage they endeavoured to have some
communication with their prisoners, but it was
impossible to make them understand any thing;
nothing they could say to them, or give them, or
do for them, but was looked upon as going about
to murder them: they first of all unbound them;
but the poor creatures screamed at that, especially
the women, as if they had just felt the knife at
their throats; for they immediately iconchxded
they were unbound on purpose to be killed* ,«-* >
If they gave them any thing to eat, tjfcuftps the
same thing; then they concluded it was/dor *feae
they should sink in flesh, and so not Jbe fabeiaougty
to kill: if they looked at one of them,moie parti*
cularly, the party presently conclnddd,> nt was tx>
see whether he or she was fattest and fittest to kill
Rt&; nay,? bftef they had brought them quite over,
and began to use them kindly, and treat them well,
still they expected every day to make a dinner or
supper for their new masters.
When the three wanderers had given this unac-
countable history or journal of their voyage, the
Spaniard asked them, where their new family was?
And being told that they had brought them on
shore, and put them into one of their huts, and
w*fcre<fcoitoe to beg some victuals for them; they
(dre^ Spaniards) and the other two Englishmen,
ttot is-to say, Che whole colony, resolved to go all
down to the place, and see them, and did so, and
Friday's father with them.
When they came into the hut, there they sat all
bo*and: for when they had brought them on shore,
they bound their hands, that they might not take
the boat and make their escape; there, I say, they
sat, all of them stark-naked; first, there were three
men, lusty, comply fellows, well shaped/straight and
fair limbs, about thirty or thirty-five years of age,
and five women* wheieof two might be from thirty
to forty, two more not above twenty-four or twen-
ty-five, and the fifth, a tall, comely maiden, about
sixteen * or seventeen: the women were well fa-
voured ugreeable* persons, both in shape and fea-
tures, dn% ^awny; and two of them> had they
bdgre$£Ngr#ec$Vtfhite, would have passed for hand-
sale iwSDtf*ea,j even in London itself, having very
pteasatsfc^ag^eeaMe -countenances, and of a very
mtidqsdJbehavioiir, especially when they came af-
terwards! to* be clothed, and dressed, &s they called
it, though that dre&s was very iftdifferefltydt flflUst
be-confessed; of whichherfcaftei\
The sight, you may bfc sure, was something un-
couth to our Spaniards, who were (to> give them a
just character) men of the besfcbehavibur, of the
most calm, sedate tempers, and perfect gaod-fra-
mour that ever I met with; and, in*f>&rtiGutar, of
the most modesty, aS will presently appear* 1 say
the sight was very uncouth, to $&& three naked
men, and five naked wouien, alt tOge$*€rb®und,
and in the most miserable ciftfumst&nce& tfiaft hu-
man nature could be supposed to be, yiz/ f<y be ex-

knew any of them; and then, if >he* understood
any of their speech; as -soon as the old man <camc
in, fie looked seriously at them, but knew none of
them; 'neither could any of theta understand a
word he said, dr a sign he could make, except one
of the Women.
However, this wa& enough to answer the end,
v^hfch was to satisfy then?!, that the! mfetf into

were of several nations
The womaa,»who was their interpreter, was bid,
in the next place, to ask them if they were willing
to be servants, and to work for the men who had
brought them away, to save their lives? At which
they all fell a dancing; and presently one fell to
taking up this, and another that, any thing that
lay next, torqarryon their shoulders, to intimate,
that they were willing to work.
The governor, who found that the having wo-
men among them would presently be attended
with some inconveniency, and might occasion some
strife, and perhaps blood, asked the three men,
what they intended to do with these women, and
how they intended to use them, whether as ser-
vants, or as women? One of the Englishmen an-
swered very boldly and readily, that they would
use them as both. To which the governor said, I
am not going to restrain you from it; you are your
own masters as to that;- but this I thiuk is but
just,-for avoiding disorders and quarrels among
you, and I desire it of you for that reason only, viz,
that you will all engage, that if any of you take
any of these women, as a woman, or wife, he shall
take but one; and that, having takep one, none else
should touch her; for though we cannot marry any
of you, yet it is hut reasonable, that while you
stay here, the woman any of you t^ke should be
maintained by the man that takes her, and should
be hi^w^fej I mean, says.he, whilp he continues
here; and febat.naoe eUe should haye any thing to
do with her. 4&rt*i? appeared so just, thkt svery
one agreed to it without any .difficulty.
Then the Englishmen asked the Spaniards, if
vol, ir. N
they designed tot^ke any of them? But every one
answered, No: some of them s^au} they had wives
in Spain; and the others did not like women that
were not Christians; and altogether declared, that
they would not touch one of them; which Was an
instance of such virtue, as I have not met with in
all my travels; on the other hand, to be short, the
five Englishmen took them every one a wife; that
is to say, a temporary wife; and so they set up a
new form of living; for the Spaniards and Friday's
father lived in my old habitation, which they
had enlarged exceedingly within; the t^hjee ser-
vants, which they had taken in the late battle of
the savages, lived with them; and these carried on
the main part of the colony, supplying all the rest
with food, and assisting them in any thing as they
fcould, or as they found, necessity required.
But the wondeijof this story was, how five such
refractory, ill-maftdred fellows should agree about
these women, antLthat two of them should not
pitch upon the£am£ woman, especially seeing two
or three of them were, without comparison, more
agreeable than the others: but thdy took a good
way enough to prevent quarrelling among them-
selves : for they set the five' women by themselves
in bne of their huts, and they went all into the
other ^t, and drew lots among them who should
choose fij$t. v j
He* that 4^w ta choose $ost, went away J>y hijn-
sdf to*hq? hut* w^erp <the -poor, naked cap^turts
were, tan$ fet^ec^qut^gr herph*>$e; £ttd it^vas
worth observing, that*Jiei that chose first, took her
that was thought the homeliest, and the oldest of
the five, wh/ch made mirth enough among the
rest: and eVen the Spaniard* laoghed at it; but
the feltow cQftsidered better than any of them,
that it was application and business^ that they were
to expect assistance in, as much as any thing else;
and she proved the best wife in the parcel.
Wheii the poor women saw themselves in a row
thus, *an<i fetched out one by one, the terrors of
their condition returned upon them again, and
they fiTtniy believed, that they were now going to
be devoured: accordingly, when the English sai-
lor came hi and fetched out one of them, the rest
set up^a^lnost^ai^entable cry, and hung ab&ut her,
and*tobi £heir leave of her with such agonies and
sucK^affection', asA would have grieved the hardest
heart iii the world; nor was it possible for the En-
glishmen to satisfy them that they were not to be
immediately murdered, till they fetched the old
man Friday's fathei>who instantly let them know,
that, the five menr who Itad fetched them out one
by one, had chosea theni for thefer wires.
When they had'done this, an$ the fright the wo-
men were in was tHMftle over, the men went to
work, and the Spaniards came and helped them;
apd, in a few hotirsj they had built them eyery
rtjpfe & new hut or tent for their lodging apart; for
those they had already were crowded with their
tools* Kfoiisebold s&^ff, and provisions* The three
wicked ones had pitched farthest off, and the two
honed; tiM&0tfrer\ btit b6th on the aarth shore of
the island* $q thalt ^ey^contrntleiP^epafate^ be-
fore: atid thWin^iSMdf was f>ex>p\e^in.3Chree
places, and, as I might say, three towns were be-
gun to be planted.
And here it is very well worth observing, that
as it often happens in the world (what the wise
ends of God's providence are in such a disposition
of things, I cannot say) the two honest fellows
had the two worst wives; and the three reprobates,
that were scarce worth hanging, that were fit for
nothing, and neither seemed born to do themselves
good, or any one else, had three clever, dili-
gent, careful, and ingenious wives; not that the
two first were ill wives as to their temper or hu-
mour; for all the five were most willing, quiet,
passive, and subjected creatures, rather like slaves
than wives; but my meaning is, they were not
alike capable, ingenious, or industrious, or alike
cleanly and neat.
Another observation I must make, to the honour
of a diligent application on the one hand, and to
the disgrace of a slothful, negligent, idle temper
on the other, that when I came to the place, and
viewed the several improvements, planting, and
management of the several little colonies, the two
men had so far outgone the three,- that there was
no comparison; they had indeed both of them as
much ground laid out for corn as they wanted ;*
and the reason was, because, according to my rule,
nature dictated, that it was to no purpose to sow
more corn than they wanted; but the difference of
the cultivation, of the planting, of the fences, and
indeed every thing else, was easy to be seen at
first view.
The two men had innumerable young trees
trigim I 8i
,bo1nslc
 r*m
planted about their huts, that when you came to
the place nothing was to be seen but a wood; and
though they had their plantation tw ice demolished,
once by their own countrymen, and once by the
enemy, as shall be shewn in its place, yet they
had restored all again, and every thing was flou-
rishing, and thriving about them: they had grapes
planted in order, and managed like a vineyard,
though they had themselves never seen any thing
of that kind: and by their good ordering their
vines, their grapes were as good again as any of
the others. They had also formed themselves a
retreat in the thickest part of the woods, 'where,
though there was not a natural cave, as I had
found, yetihey made one with incessant labour of
their hands, and where, when the mischief which
followed happened, they secured their wives and
children, so as they could never be found; they
having, by sticking innumerable stakes and poles
of the wood, which, as I said, grew so easily, made
a grove impassible, except in one place, where they
climbed up to get over the outside part, and then
went in by ways of their own leaving.
As to the tliTee reprobates, as I justly call them,
though they were much civilized by their new set-
tlement, compared to what they were before, and
were not so quarrelsome, having not the same op-
portunity, yet one of the certain companions of a
.profligate mind never left them, and that was their
idleness. It is true, they planted corn, and made
fences; but Solomon's words were never better
.verified than in them. " I went by the vineyard of
" the slothful,, and it was overgrown with thorns;"

for when the Spaniards came to view thek cmp,
they could not see it in some places for weeds; the
hedge had several gaps in it, wheiie the wild goats
had gotten in, and eaten up the corn; perhaps
here and there a dead bush w-as crammed inf to
stop them out for the presents but at <was only
shutting the stable door after the rsteed was,stolen;
whereas, when they looked on the colony of the
other two, there was the very face of industry* ami
success upon all they did; there was not a weed to
be seen in all their corn, or a gap in any of *hedr
hedges; and they, on the other hand, verified Sor
lomon's words in another place. "/The ,/diJigfciit

thrived, and they had plenty within and without
they had more tame cattle than the others mo$b

more pleasure and diversion too.
It is true, the wives of , the * three were very
handy and cleanly within doors; and having
learned the English ways of dressing and cooking
from one of the other Englishmen, who, as I said,
was a cook's mate on board the ship, they dressed
their husbands' victuals very nicely;, whereas the
other could not be brought to understand it; <but

But now I* come to a scene different from all
tbit haU> happened before, eitheF to them or me;
atid the origin of the story was this.
Early one momiftg there came on shore five or
six canoes of Indians, or savages, -call them which
you please; and there is no room to doubt that
they came upon th^ old errand of feeding upon
their slaves; butthat part was now so familiar to
the Spaniards, and to 6ur men too, that they did
stdt concern- themselves about it, as I did; but,
haying-been made sensible by their experience, that
their^ only business was to lie concealed, and that,
if they*{were not seen by any df the savages, they
^otild' g& off! again quietly, when their business
wins do^e, having as yet not the least notion of
there* bc&frgf any inhabitants in the island; I say,
having been m&de sensible of this, they had no-
thing to do but to give ^notice to all the three plan-
tations to k£epf within <kfors, and not to shew
themselves 5* only placing* a sc&itt in a proper

they had cither been so gorged with their jnjhn
man feast, that, like beasts, they weie asleep, an$
would not stir when the others went, or they w;er§
wandered into the woods, and did not come back
in time to be taken in.
The Spaniards were greatly surprised at this
sight, and perfectly at a loss what to do: the Spa-
niard governor, as it happened, was with them,
and his advice was asked; but he professed he
knew not what to do: as for slaves, they had
enough already; and^as to killing them, theynw§re
none of them inclined to that; the £paqiard gp-
vernor told me they could not think: of ^h^dduqg
innocent blood; for as to them the popr creat^pQS
had done no wrong, invaded norje qf the^r ypy.-
perty; and they thought ttyey ljad^no jus£qu3f£gl
against them to take away their lives. ,
And here I mujst, in justice to tlpese Spaniards,
observe, that let all the#ccpunts,of Sp^ni^h cruelty
in Mexico and Peru bef wjhat tjhey will, I lievef
met with seventeen men, fof any nation wh#tsqr
ever, in any foreign country, who were so? univer-
sally modest, temperate, virtuous, so very gopd-hu-
moured, and so coijrteous, as these $p^piards; ^nd*
as to cruelty, they ha<J nothing o£ it in tfoeii; very

courage and spirit.

men; and their justice and humanity appeared p$$\

Wt$rfd Ke^tilfi\^hlle longer, tiff, if possible, these
tftfee men ihfghfc be gone; but then the governor
SjpaniaM recollected that the three savages had
no boat; and that, if they were left to rove about
the island, they would certainly discover that
thefe Were inhabitants in it, and so they shbuld
be-undone that way.
tJpon this they went back again, and there lay
thb fellows fast asleep still; so they resolved to
tfivtfken them, and take them prisoneis; and they
cfitF sov; the poor fellows were strangely frighted
vrfferTthey were seized upon and bound, and afraid,
lrkgHJhfe women, that they should be murdered and
eitetif for, it seems, those people think all the
world d6 as they do, eating men's flesh; but they
wferesoon made easy as to that; and away they
carried them.
* Irwks very happjr for them, that they did not
cafry them home to their casfde; I mean to my pa-
lace under the hill; but they carried them first to
the bower, where was the chief of their country
work; such as the keeping the goats, the planting
the corn," &c. and afterwards they carried them' to
the habitatibn of the two Englishmen.
' Here they were set to work, thouglilf was not

savages, who came on shore three; pi: four weeks
afterwards, and who, carrying On their revels as
usual, went off again in two days time: this
thought terrified them exceedingly; for they con-
cluded, and that not without good cause indeed,
that if this fellow got safe home among his cpm-
rades, he would certainly give them an account
that there were people in the island, as also how
weak and few they were; for this savage, as I ob-
served before, had never been told, as it was very
happy he had not, how many they were, or where
they lived, nor had he ever seen or heard the fire
of any of their guns, much less had they shewn
him any other of their retired places, such as the
cave in the valley, or the new retreat which the
two Englishmen had made, and the like.
The first testimony they had, that this fellow
had given intelligence of them was, that about
two months after this, six canoes of savages, with
about seven or eighty or ten men in a canoe, came
rowing along the north-side of the island, where
they never used to come before, and landed about
an hour after sun-rise, at a convenient place, about
a mile from the habitation of the two Englishtnen,
where this escaped man had been kept: as the
Spaniard governor said, had they been all there,
the damage would not have been so much, for not
a man of them would have escaped: but the case
differed now very much; for two men to fifty
were too much odds: the two men had the happi-
ness to discover them about a league off, so that
it was above an hour before they landed; and as
they landed about a mile from their huts, it was
 MW
.
'/I,//,,/.,/ ,l/„, ,-, /, ,:„ ,., M„A /;....,V///,
some time before they could come at them. Now
having great reason to believe that they were be-
trayed, the first thing they did was to bind the
slaves which were left, and cause two of the three
men, whom they brought <with the women, who,
it seems, proved very faithful to thera, to lead
them .with their two witfes, and whatever they
could jcarry away with them, to their retired place
in the .woods, which I ha,ve spoken of above, and
there to bind the two fellows hand and foot till
they, heard, further.
In the next place, seeing the Savages were ail
come on shore, and that they beat their course
directly that way,- they opened the fences where
their milch-goats were kept, and drove them all
out, leaving their goats to straggle into the wood,
whither they pleased, that the savages might think
they were all bred wild; but the vogue who came
with them was too cunning for that, and gave
them an account of it all; for they went directly
to the place. When the poor frighted men had
secured their wives and goods, they sent the other
slave they had of the three, who came with the
women, and who was at their place by accident,
away to the Spaniards with all speed, to give them
the alarm, and desire speedy help; and in the
mean time they to6k their arms,, and what ammu-
nition they had, and ^treated towards the place
in the wood where their wives were sent, keeping
at a distance; yet so that they might see, if pos-
sible, which way the savages took.
They had not gone far, but that, from a rising
o 2
ground* tbe^cotrid sefc the Jittte^hffyffcflF their
enemies come'efetlifeetly to thefr habitation^ fctfcfc
in a moment moie could see all their'huts and
household-stuff flaming up together, to their great
grief and mortification; for they had a very ^reat
loss, and to them irretrievable, at least for $frm£>
time. They kept their station for awhile, till'tiiey
found the savages, like wild beasts, spread'thesfflw
selves all over the place, rummaging every* way$>
atid every place they could think of, in search fi^5
prey; and, in particular, for the people, tff whomf
it plainly appeared they had intelligence. n ni »
The two Englishmen seeing this, thinking'theciri
selves not sectrte where they stood) afs it was Jik^ly
some of the wild people might come that wayv-sd
they might come too many together, thought)if
proper to make another retreat about half a mile
further, believing, as it afterwards happened, that
the further they strolled, the fewer would be tor
gether.
Th6 next halt was at the entrance into a very
thick grown part of the woods, and where an old
trunk of a tree stood, which was hollow, and
vastly large; and in this tree they tooth took their
standing, resolving to see what might offer, * <rl
They had not stood there long) but two< of the
savages appeared running directly that way, as if
they had already notice where they stbod,' and
were coming up to attack them; and a little way
further they espied three more coming»after tfeeift,
and five more beyond them, all coming the same
way; besides which, they saw seven or eight moarfe
a£ft dis^n$e* punning aether Wfry; for, in a word,
$agy »^iev^y wa^, like sportsmen beating for
j/T^erpoor men were now m great perplexity,
whether they should stand, and keep their posture,,
QBifly >. but after a very short debate with them-
selves,*, fehey considered, that if the savages ranged
fckfckCoimtry thus, before help came, they might,
Perhaps, find out,their retreat in the woods, and
tib4i*i&U would be lost; so they resolved to stand
AetfV'there; and if there were too many to deal
with, then they would get to.the top of the tree,
fram^beupe they doubted not to defend them-
S€feeS,rfire excepted, as long as their ammunition
lasted^ though all the savages that were landed*
whichuwere near fifty, were to attack them. ,
-» Jia^ing resolved uponjthis, they next considered
whether they should* fiie at the two first, or wait
for the three, and sq take,, the. middle partyj by
which the two and the five that followed would
fee separated,* at length they jresqlyed to let the
Wo first pass by, unless they should spy them in
the tree,* and comedo attack them* The two first
savages also confirmed them in this resolution, by
turnings little from them towards another part of
iht wood;.* but the three> and the five after them,
tsaa&e $Qi\wai?d^ directly to the tree, as if they had
lfionDv^)the Eiaglishmen were there. »>
l^S&Ao§ fehtem. come so straight towards them,
thej^ffGsofce&tQitaketthem in a line as theycam§;
.and as> they* resolved to fire but one at a timQ, per-
haps the firsttahflfe might hit them all three; to
which purpose, the man who was to fire, put three
102 L^FK AND ADYfiBmjRBS
or four bullets into his piece, m& having a fair
loophole, as it were, from a broken hole in 'the
tree, he took a sure aim, without being sfefen,
waiting till they were within about thirtyywds of
the tree, so that he could not miss.
While they were thus waitings and thers&qagest
came on, they plainly saw, tha^t one of the><tShEree
was the run-away savage that bad escaped? from
them, and they both knew him 'distinctly,! arid re-
solved, that, if possible, he should ^ot escape/
though they should both fire; so the other istood

hit two of them directly: the foremost was* kilted
outright, being shot iu the head; the second?

the third had a little scratch in the ^hoiildeiy per*

ilov^ver, all being silent again, and they not

Ubhtl fc& believe, toM them that a flash of fire fiist,
and immediately after that, thunder from their
gads,v had fritted* those two, and wounded him.
Thifcj1 I-say, is rational; for nothing is more cer-
tain thanJ that, as they saw no man near them, so
they had never heard a gun in all their lives, or
so, much as heard of* a gtm; neither knew they
anything of killing ot-wolindmg at a distance,
withiire and bullets; if they had, one might rea-
sonably believe/ ftfet tftey woiiltf not have stood
so unconcerned, lit viewing the fate of their fel-
lows, without stitn& ap^i-ehen^ion of their own.

when they came to the 'placed andnfound no^less

that had been the cause of all the mischief;'and
of another that was hurt in his krfee, andput^h^in
out of their pain; then the man that'wa^ Aot'burt
at all came'and kneeled down to them, wfth$hk
two hands held up, and made piteous moan to tlieiii
by gestures and signs, for his life; but could not
say one word to them that they could understand,
However, they signified to trim to sit down at
the foot of a tree thereby; and one of the English-
men, with a piece of rope-twine, which he had by
great chance in his pocket, tied his feet fast toge-
ther, and'his hands behind him, and there they
left him; and, with what speed they could, made
after the other two which were gone before, fear-
ing they, or any more of them, should find the
way to their covered place in the,woods> where
their wives, and the few goods they *had left lav;
they came once m sight or the two men, butat
was at a great distance; however,., they h$d ,fch$
satisfaction £0 see^them ,cross oyfri a^vgj^eyr iff
wards me>ea, the quite contrary way from that
vvQicu lea to their retrpat, which they were &fmid
of; and> bemg sali*6ed with that, they went back
to the tree where they left their prisoner, who, as
they supposed, was delivered by his comrades; for
he w$s gone, and the two pieces of rope-yarn, with
which they had bound him, lay just at the foot of
the tree.
They were now in as great a concern as before,
not knowing what course to take, or how near the
enemy might be, or in what numbers; so they re-
solved to go away to the place wheie their wives
were, to see if all was well there, and to make them
eafy, who were in fright enough to be sure; for
thoqgh the savages were their own country folks^
yet they were most terribly afraid of them, and
perhaps the more, for thp knowledge they had of
them.
When they came thither, they found the savages
had been in the wood, and very near the placfr,
but had not found it; for, indeed, it was inaccessi-
ble, by the trees standing so thick, as before, un-
less the persons seeking it had been directed by
those that knew it, which these were not; they
found, therefore, every thing very safe, only the
women in a terrible fright: while they were here,
they had the comfort of seven of the Spaniards
coming to their assistance; the other ten, with
tfreu' servants, and old Friday, I mean Friday's ^fa-
ther, were gone in a body to defend their bower,
akl the cbrn and cattle that were kept there, in
ca$ef th£ savages should have roved over to that
side of the country; but they did not sjiead so far.
With the seven Spaniards came one of the pages'
who, as I said, were their prisoner* fbxtntxi^ zm
vol. n. " V * " ! •* - -
With them also the lavage whom the English-
men had left bound hand and foot at the tree> fbr
it seems they came that way, saw the slaughter bf
the seven men, and unbound the eighth, and
brought him ulong with them, where, however,
they were obliged to bind him again, as they had
done the two others, who were left when the ^hird
ran fcway.
. The prisoners began now to be af buTcletrto
them; and they were so afraid of their Escaping,
that they thought they were under an absolute ne-
cessity to kill them for thtir own preservation:
however, the Spaniard governor would not consent
to it; but ordered, that they should be sent oufcof
the way to my oM cave in the valley, and be k£pt
there, with two Spaniards to guard them, and give
them food: tyihich was done; and they were bound
there hand and foot for that night.
0 Allien tbe Spaniards came, the two Englishmen
were so encouraged, that? they could not satisfy
themselves to stay any longer there; but taking
fiv£ of the Spaniards, and themselves, with four
musquets and a pistol among them, and two stout
quarter staves, away they went in quest of the sa-
vages; and first, they catne to the tree where the
men lay that had been killed; but it w&s easy to
s£e, that some moi^eof the savages had been ther6;
for they attetnptedi W carry therf dead menj away,
arid had dragged two of them a' good way, but
h$d given it 6ver; frdm thence they" advanced to
the fitst rising gtbtind, fwhei*e* they had stood ^and
seen their earn ]£ destroy ed5 and wbere they had the
ttiottiftcation still to* see some of the^moke; but
^either, could they here see any of the savages':
they then resolved, though with all possible cau-
tion %Q go forward towards their ruined planta-
tion: hut a little before they came thither, coming
insight of the sea shore, they saw plainly the sa-
vages all embarking again in their canoes, in order
to be gone.
They seemed sorry at first that there was no
>vay to come at them, to give them a parting blow;
kut* upon, thp whole, were very well satisfied to be
rj/d .ofithem.
~,%The/p0or Englishmen being now twice ruined,
3&(LaU their improvements destroyed, the rest ail
agreed to come and help them to rebuild, and to
assist them with .needful supplies. Their three
countrymen, who were not yet noted for having
the least inclination to do any thing good, yet, as
soon as they heard of it (for they, living remote,
knew nothing till all was over) came and offered
their help and assistance, and did very friendly
work for several days, to restore their habitations,
and make necessaries for them; and thus, in a lit-
tle time, they were set upon their legs again.
About two days after this, they had the further
satisfaction of seeing three of the savages canoes
come driving on shore, and, afrsome distance frop
tbenvwitlvtwo drowned men; by which they had
r<easpni<to>believe, that they had met with a ^torm

carry all before them; for,.except what ithe first
man had told them of inhabitants, they eould><say
little to it of their own knowledge, foi\they i*e^er
saw one man, and the fellow being killed thatihad
affirmed it, they had no other witness to confirm
it to them.
It was five or six months after this, "before* they:
heard any more of the savages, in which time our*
men were in hopes they had not forgot thei& for-
mer bad luck, or had given over the hopes of bete
ter, when, on a sudden, they were invaded with
a most formidable fleet, of no Jess than twenty-
eight canoes full of savages, armed with bows and
arrows, great clubs, wooden swordsr and>such like
engines of war; and they brought such numbers
with them> that, in short, it put all our people into
the utmost consternation.
As they came on shore in the evening, and at
the easternmost side of the island, our men had that
night to consult and consider what to do; and, in
the first place, knowing that their being entirely
concealed was their only safety before, and Would
much more be so now, while the number of their
enemies was so great, they therefore resolved, first
of sl\y to take down the huts which were built for
the two Englishmen/and drive away th^irgoats to
the old cave; because they supposed the savages
would go directly thither, as soon as it was day, to
play the old game over again, though they did)
not now land within two leagues of it.

whiek belonged to the Spaniards; and, in short,
Wt as little appearance of inhabitants any where
a^ possible;* and? the next morning early they
pasted themselves with all their force, at the plan-
tation* of the two men, waiting for their coming. As
they guessed, so it happened; these new invaders,
leaving their canoes at the east end of the island*
c^me* ranging almig the shore, directly towards the
ptaee, to the number of two hundred and fifty, as
near as our men could judge. Our army was but
small indeed; but, that which was worse, they had
not arms* for all their number neither. The whole

with one another, and ^ the wotae^had thatehels

The Spaniard governor, whom I hav^e* descHbdd
so often* commanded the. whole;f and WlWi&m At-

ness, was a most daring bold fellow, comffiinded
under him. The savages came forward like lions,

had no advantage in their situation; only that
Will Atkins, who now proved a most useful fellow,
with jsix men1, was planted1 just -behind a small
thicket of bushes, as an advanced guard, with orders
to let the first of them pass by, and then fire into
the middle of them; &lid, as soon as he had fired,
to make his retreat, as nimbly as ht could, round
a part of the wood, and so come in behind the Spa-
niards where they stood, having at thicket of trees
all before them.

tax. ii* q
The Spaniaids charged again, with the 'utmost
expedition, and then divided themselves into thiee
bodies, and resolved to fall in among them all toge-
thei: they had in each body eight peisons; that is
to say, twenty -four, whereof were twenty-two men,
and the two women, who, by the way, fought des-
perately.
They divided the fiie-arms equally in each party-,
and so of the haiberts and staves. They would
have had the women keep back; but they said,
they weie lesolved to die with their husbands.
Having thus formed their little army, they marched
out from among the trees, and came up to the
teeth of the enemy, shouting and hallooing as loud
as they could; the savages stood all together, but
were in the utmost confusion, hearing the noise of
our men shouting from three quarters together;
they would have fought if they had seen us;
and, as soon as we came near enough to be seen,
some arrows were shot, and poor old Friday was
wounded, though not dangerously. But our men
gave them no time; but, running up to them, fired
among them three ways, and then fell in with the
but-ends of their musquets, their swords, armed
staves, and hatchets; and laid about them so well,
that, in a word, they set up a dismal screaming and
howling, flying to save their lives which way soe-
ver they could.
Our men were tired with the execution; and
killed, or mortally wounded, in the two fights,
about 180 of them; the rest:, being frighted out'of
their wits,*3 scoured! *'through the woods,' and ovter
the lulls, with all }th£ ' sp&d'tliat ffeaf andt nimble
feet could help therft to do; and as we did not
trouble our$eJves much to pursue them, they got
all together to the sea-side, where they landed,
and where their canoes lay. But their disaster was
not at an end yet; for it blew a terrible storm of
>vind that evening from the sea-ward; so that it
was impossible for them to put off; nay, the storm
continuing all night, when the tide came up, their
canoes were most of them driven by the surge of
the sea so high upon the shore, that it required in-
finite toil to get them off; and some of them were
qven, dashed to pieces against the beach, or against
one another.
t, Our men, though glad of their victory, yet got
" little rest that night; but having refreshed them-
selves as well as they could, they resolved to march
to that part of the island where the savages were
fled, and see what posture they were in. This ne-
cessarily led them over the place where the fight
had been, and where they found several of the poor
creatures not quite dead, and yet past reco\ering
life; a sight disagreeable enough to generous
minds; for a truly great man, though obliged by
the law of battle to destroy his enemy, takes no
delight in his misery.
However, there was no need to give any order
in this case; for their own savages, who were their
servant dispatched those poor creatures with
their hatchets.
At length they capae in view of the place where
the more miserable remains of the savages' army
lay, where there appeared about; 100 stilt; tl>eir
posture was generally sitting upon the ground, wjth
t|ieir l^nees up {o\y,ar<^their,mouthy and,the head
put between the hands, leaning down upon the
knees.
When our men came within two musquet shot
of them, the Spaniard governor ordered two mus-
quets to be fired without ball, to alarm them; this
he did, that by their countenance he might know
what to expect, viz. Whether they were still in
heart to fight, or were so heartily beaten, as to be
dispirited and discouraged, and so he might ma-
nage accordingly.
This stratagem took; for, as soon as the savages
heard the first gun, and saw the flash of the second,
they started up upon their feet in the greatest con-
sternation imaginable; and, as our men advanced
swiftly towards them, they all ran screaming and
yawling away, with a kind of an howling noise,
which our men did not understand, and had never
heard before; and thus they ran up the hills into
the country.
At first, our men had much rather the weather
had been calm, and they had all gone away to sea;
but they did not then consider, that this might
probably have been the occasion of their coming
again in such multitudes as not to be resisted, or,
at least, to come so many and so often, as would
quite desolate the island, and starve them. Will
Atkins therefore, who, notwithstanding his wound,
kept always with them, proved the best counsellor
in this case; his advice was, to take the advantage
that offered, and clap in between them and their
boats, and so deprive them of the capacity of
ever returning any more to plague the island.
They consulted long about this, and some were
til

against it, for fear of making the wretches fly into
the \voods, and live there desperate; and so they
should bjive them to hunt like wild beasts, be
airajd? to stir, about their business, and have their
plantation continually rifled, all their tame goats
destroyed, and, in short, be reduced to a life of
continual distress.
. Will Atkins told tbem, they had better have to
do with 10Q men, than with; 100 nations; that as
as they must destroy .their boats, so they must-die*
sfcroy the jnefr, or be all of them destroyed them-
selves. In a word, he shewed them the necessity
©f it so plainly, that they all came into it; so they
went to work immediately with the boats, and,
getting some dry wood together from a dead tree,
they tried to set some of them on fire; but they
were so wet, that they would scarce burn. How-
ever, the fire so burned the upper part, that it soon
made them unfit for swimming in the sea as boats.
When the Indians saw what they were about,
some of them came running out of the woods; and
coming as near as they could to our men, kneeled
down and cried, Oa, Oa, Waramokoa, and some
other words of their language, which none of the
others understood any thing of; but as they made
pitiful gestures, and strange noises, it was easy to
understand they begged to have their boats spared,
and that they would be gone, and never return
thither again.
But our men were now satisfied, that they had
no way to preserve themselves, or to save theijr
colony, but effectually to prevent any of thesfe
people from ever going home again; depending
upon this, that if ever isoonuclras Dne of them got
back into their country^ to> tell the story, thfe
colony was undone; so that, letting them know-
that they should not have any mercy, the/ fell to
work with their canoes^/and destroyed them every-
one that the storm had not destroyed before; at
the sight of which, the savages raised a hideous
cry in the woods, which our people ^hea?rd plain
enough; after which they ran about the 'isfatid
like distracted men; so that, in a woiti, our meli
did not really know at first what to do with tihfetn.
Nor did the Spaniards, with all their prudence,
consider that while they friade fchose^xpeople this
desperate, they ought to have kept good gua*dA#t
the same time'upon their plantations-; for though
it is erue they had driven away their cattle, ami
the Indians did not find their main retreat, I mean
my old castle at the hill; nor the cave in the vat-
ley;* yet they found out my plantation at tlie
bower, and pulled it all to pieces,' and all the fences
and planting about it; trod all the corn under foot;
<tore xip the vines and grapes, being just then
almost ripe; and did our men an inestimable
damage, though, to themselves, notone faithing's
worth of service.
j Though our men were able to fight them upon
illi occasions, yet they were in no condition'' to
pursue them, or hunt thenl up and'down f foN&s

* The extremity and distress they weie reduced
to was great, and indeed deplorable, but at the
same time our men were also brought to very hard
circumstances by them; for though their retreats
were preserved, yet their provision was destroyed,
<anfl their harvest spoiled; and what to do, or
which way to turn themselves, they knew not;
4hc* ojuly refuge they had now was, the stock of
pa^fcle they had in the valley by the cave, and
$Qf®e Jittle corn which grew there. The three
(Englishmen, .William Atkins and his comrades,
wfere i*ow> reduced to two, one of them being
killed by an arrow, which struck him on Hhe side
oi tys head, just under the temples^ so that he
uever spoke more; and it was very remarkable,
that this was the same barbarous * fellow who vcut
the poor savage slave with his hatchet, and who
afterwards intended to have murdered the Spa-
niards. _ »
I looked upon their case to have been worse at
this timet,than mime was at any time after I first
discovered the grains of barley and rice, and got
into the method of planting and raising my com,
and my tame cattle; for now they had,.as Itoiay

They had taught them both to plant corn, m&ke
bread, breed tame goats, and milk them;< they
wanted nothing but wives, and they soon would
have been a nation: they were confined to< a neck
of land, surrounded with high rocks behind them,
and lying plain towards the sea before them, on
the south-east corner of the island; they had land
enough, and it was very goQd and fruitful^ fe
they had a pieae of land ^bout a mile and & half
bfoad, and three or four miles in length*
Our men taught them to make wooden spades,
such as I made for myself; and gave among them
twelve hatchets, and three or four knives; ami
ther6 they lived the most subjected innocent crea-
tures that were ever heard of.
After this the colony enjoyed a perfect tranquil-
lity with respect to the savages, till I came to re-
visit them, which was in about two years; not
but that now and then some canoes of savages
came on shore for their triumphal, unnatural fea$t$;
but as they were of several nations, and, perhaps,
had never heard of those that came before* or the
reason of it, they did not make auyjsearchor i#-

would not have their settlement betrayed again.
1 One thing was very remarkable, viz. that they
taught the savaggs to make wicker-work, or
baskets; but they soon out-did their masters; for
they made abundance of most ingenious things in
wioker-work; particularly, all sorts of baskets,
sieves, bird-cages^ cupboards, &c. as also chairs to
sit on, stools, beds, couches, and abundance of
ol&er things, being very ingenious at such work,
when they were once put in the way of it*
My coming was a particular relief to these peo-
ple* because we furnished them with knives, scis-
sars, spades, shovels, pick-axes, and all things of
that kind which they could want.
With the help of these tools they were so very
handy, that they came, at last, to build up their
huts, Or houses, very handsomely; raddling, or
working it up like basket-work all the way round,
which was a very extraordinary piece of ingenuity,
and looked very odd; but was an exceeding good
fence, as well against heat, as against all sorts of
vermin; and our men were so taken with it, that
they got the wild savages to come and do the lik^e
for^ttiem,* so (that when I came to see the two En-

thirty-two in number, and very strong, standing
about seven feet high: in the middle was another
not above twenty-two paces round* but built
stronger, being eight square in its form, and ixx $he
eight corners stood eight very strong posts, rom^d
the top of which he laid strong pieces, joined toge-
ther with wooden pins, from which, he raised a py-
ramid before the roof of eight rafters, very hanc^
&6me, I assuie you, and joined together very well,
though he had no nails, and only a few iron pikes,
3vhich he had made himself too, out of the, old }tq\\
that I had left there; and, indeed, this fellow
shewed abundance of ingenuity in several thjqgs
which he had no knowledge of; he made himself
a forge, with a pair of wooden bellows to blow the
fire; he made himself charcoal for his work, and
he fdfrned'out of one of the iron crows a mid-
cllinggdod anvil to hammer upon; in this manner
frfc made many things, but especially hooks, sta-
ples and spikes, bolts and hinges. But to return
to the house; after he pitched the roof of his inner-
most tfcnt, he worked it up between the rafters
with basket-work, so firm, and thatched that over
ag&in so ingeniously with rice straw> and over thafc
a large teaf of a tree, which covered the top, that
hU house Was as dry as if it had Been, tiled pr

from the thirty-two angle^ to the top posts of the
inner bouse, being about twenty feet distant; so
that there was a space like a walk within the outer
wicker-wall, and without the inner, near twenty
feet wide.
The inner place he partitioned off with the same
wicker-work, but much fairer, and divided into six
apartments, for that he had six rooms on a floor,
and out of every one of these there was a door;
first, into the cntty, or coming into the main tent;
and another door into the space or walk that was
round it; so that this walk was also divided into
six equal parts, which served not only for a re-
treat, but to store up any necessaries which the fa-
inily had occasion for. These six spaces not tak-
ing up the whole circumference, what other apart-
ments the outer circle had, were thus ordered: as
soon as you were in at the door of the outer circle,
you had a short passage straight before you to the
door of the inner house; but on either side was a
wicker partition, and a door in it, by which you
went, first, into a large room or store-house,
twenty feet wide, and about thirty feet long, and
through that into another not quite so long: so
that in the outer circle were ten handsome rooms5
six'of which were only to be come at through die
apartments of the inner tent, and served as closets
or retired rooms to the respective chambers of the
inner circle; and four larg.e warehouses or barns,,
or what you please to call them, which went iji
through one another, two on either hand of the
passage that led through the outer door to the in-
ner tent. ' ( s > j \ , .

bee-hive lived the three families; that is t6 $ay,
Will Atkins, and his companions; the third was
killed, but his wife remained with three children;
for she was, it seems, big with child when he died;
and the other two Were not at all backward to give
the widow hef full share of every thing, I mean* as
to their corn, milk, grapes, &c. and when they
killed a kid, or found a turtle on the shore; so that
they all lived well enough, though it was true,
they were not so industrious as the other t\fb/ #s
has been observed already.
One thing, however cannot be omitted, vi^
that, as for religion, I do not know that there #as
any thing of that kind among them; they pretty,
often, indeed, put one smother in mind, that there
was a God, by the very common method of sea-*
men, viz. Sweating by his name;# nor were their
poor, ignorant savage wives much the better for
having been inarried to Christians, as we must call
them; for as they knew very little of God them-
selves, 'so they Were utterly incapable of entering
intb day discourse with their wives about a God,
or to talk any thing to them concerning religion.
The utmost of all the improvement which I can
say the wives had made from them, was, that they

less, I think the cook's mate's wife was big of her
sixth child; and the mothers were all a good sort
of well governed, quiet, laborious women, modest
a&d decent, helpful to one another, mighty obser-

tfem husbands; and wanted nothing but to be
well instructed in the Christian religion, and to be
legally married; both which were happily brought
about afterwards by my means, or, at least, by the
consequence cf my coming among them*

who were the main body of the family; and in-

mgly; that they were cast upon the shore without
necessaries, without supply of food, or of present
sustenance, till they could provide it: that it is true,
I had this disadvantage and discomfort, that I was
alone; but then the supplies I had providentially
thrown into my hands, by the unexpected driving
of the ship on shore, was such a help as would
have encouraged any creature in the world to have
applied himself as I had done. Seignior, says the
Spaniard, had we poor Spaniards been in your case,
we should never have gotten half those things out of
the ship as you did: nay, says he, we should never
have found means to have gotten a raft to carry
them, or to have gotten a raft on shore without
boat or sail; and how much less should we have
done, said he, if any of us had been alone! Well, I
.desired him to abate his compliment, and go on
with the history of their coming on shore, where
they landed. He told me, they unhappily landed
at a place where there were people without provi-
sions; whereas, had they had the common sense to
have put off to sea again, and gone to another island
a little further, they had found provisions, though
without people; there being an island that way, >
as they had been told, where there were provi$ions?
though no.people; that is to say, that the Spa-*
njards of Trinidad had frequently been there, and
filled the island with goats and hogs at several.'

herbs, which they understood not, and which had
no substance in them, and which the inhabitants
gave them sparingly enough, and who could treat
them no better, unless they would turn cannibals,
and eat men's flesh, which was the great dainty rrf
the country.
They gave me an account how many ways they
strove to civilize the savages they were with, and
to teach them rational customs in the ordinary way
of living; but in vain: and how they retorted it
upon them, as unjust, that they who came thither
for assistance and support, should attempt twmt
up for instructors of those that gave them b#ead;
intimating, it seems, that none should set up ffor
the instructors of others, but those who could livfc
without them.
They gave me dismal accounts of the extremities
they were driven to; how sometimes they wetfe
many days without any food at all; the island they
were upon being inhabited by a sort of savages
-that lived more indolent, and, for that reason,
were less supplied with the* necessaries of life, than
ithey had reason to believe others were in the same
part of the world; and yet they foand'that these
savages were less ravenous and voracious, than
those who had better supplies of food.
Also they added, that they could Hot but see
with what demonstrations of wisdom'and goodness,
the governing Providence of God directs the
event of things in the world; which, they said,
appeared in their circumstances; foHf, pre$sed<fey
the hardships they were under, and the barrenness
of the country where they wets, they had searched
after a;better place to live In, they had then been
omt of the way of the relief that happened to them
by my means*
Then they gave me an account, how the savages,
whom they lived among, expected them to go out
with them into their wars; and it was true, that,
as they had fire-arms with them, had they had not
had the disaster to lose their ammunition, they
shauJcL not have been serviceable only to their
friends, but have made themselves terrible both to
friends and enemies; but being without powder
aiad shot, an(l ^n a condition, that they could not
iitrreason deny to go out with their landlords to
their wars j when they came in the field of battle,
they were in a worse condition than the savages
themselves; for they neither had bows nor arrows,
nov could they use those the savages gave them;
so that they could do nothing but stand still, and
be wounded with arrows, till they came up to the
teeth of their enemy; and then, indeed, the three
halberts they had were of use to them; and they
would often drive a whole little army before them,
with those halberts and sharpened sticks put into
the muzzles of their muskets: but that for all this,
they were sometimes surrounded with multitudes,
and in great danger from their arrows; till at last
they found the way to make themselves large tar-
gets of wood^ which they covered with skins of
wild beasts, whose names they knew not; and
these covered them from theaniow§ of the savages;
thafy notwithstanding: ithese, they were sometimes

Which Was the time when one 6f them Wis tak&rr
prisoher, that is to say/ the Spbnkrd whofti I had
relieved. That at first they thought he hadbee&
killed, but when afterwards they heard h^iwaS
taken prisoner, they were under the greatest gtifef
imaginable, and would willingly have all ventured
their lives to have rescued him.
They told me, that when they were so knocked
down, the rest of their company rescued them, and
fctood over them fightingr till they were cofrie tb
themselves, all but he who they thought had been
dead; and then they made their way with ttheirhal-
berts and pieces, standing close together in a line,
through a body of above a thousand savages, beat-
ing down ill that came in their way, got' the vic-
tory over thfcir enemies, but to their great sorrow,
because it Was with the loss of their friend; whom
the other p&rty finding him alivfe, carried off with
some others, as I gave Ian account in my former.
They described most affectionately, how they
were surprised With joy at .the return of their
friend'and companion in misery, who they thought
had been devoured b}r wild beasts of the worst of
kihd, viz. by Wild men; and, yet how more and
more they were surprised with the account he gave
them of his errand, and that there was a Christian
in a .place near, iMich more one that was able,
and "had hufnanity enough to contribute toth^ir
deliverance. ;
They de&fribfetl how they wefea$tbni&hed at the

iioni Heaven; #ndrwhat a reviving cardial it was
to^their spirits to taste it; as also,, of the other
jfchings! Lhad sent for their supply. And, after all,
they would have told me something of the joy
they were in at the sight of a boat and pilots to
carry them away to the person and place, from
whence all these new comforts came; but they
told me, it was impossible to express it by words;
for.itheir excessive joy driving them to unbecom-
ing extravagancies, they had no way to describe
thenjt but by telling me, that they bordered upon
lunacy, having no way to give vent to their pas-
sion, suitable to the sense that was upon them;
that in some it worked one way, and in §ome ano-
ther; and that some of them, through a surprise of
joy, would burst out into tears; others be half
imad, and others immediately faint. Thjs discourse
extremely affected me, and ^lled to my mind ^Fri-
day's ecstasy, when, |xe met his father, apd the
poor people's ecstasy, when I took them up ^t sea,
after their ship wasxm fire; t the mate of the ship's
joy, when he found himself delivered in the place
where he expected to perish; and my own joy,
when after twenty-eight years captivity, I found
$ good ship ready to carry me to my own country.

r^latiQjQ of these poor men, and more affected

that they would be troubled no more with the sa-
vages'; or tftat, if they were, they would be abfe
to cut them off, if they were twice as many as be-
fore; so that they had no concern about that.
Then I entered into a serious discourse with the
Spaniard, whom I called governor, about their
stay in the island; for as I was not come td carry
any of them off, so it would not be just to carry
off some, and leave others, who perhaps would
be unwilling to stay if their strength was dimin*
ished. * (
On the other hand, I told them, I came to es-
tablish them there, not to remove them; and then
I let them know, that I had brought with me re-
lief of sundry kinds for them. That I had beeit
at a great charge to supply them with all things
necessary, as well for their convenience, as their
defence; and that I had such particular persons
with me, as well to increase and recruit their num*
bcr, as by the particular necessary employments
which they were bred to, being artificers, to assist
them in those things, in which, at present, they
Were to seek.
They were all together when I talked thus to
them; and before I delivered to them the stores I
had brought, I asked them, one by one, if they
had entirely forgot and buried the first animosities
that had been among them, and could shake hands
with one another, and engage in a strict friend-
ship, and union of interest, so that there might be
no more misunderstandings or jealousies.
William Atkins, with abundance of frankness
and good-humour, ^aid, They had met with afflic-
tions enough to make them all sober, €nd enemies
enough to make them all friends. That, for his
part, he would live and die with them; and was so
far from designing any thing against the Spaniards,
that, he owned, they had done nothing to him
but what his own bad humour made necessary, and
what he would have done, and, perhaps, much
worse, in their case; and that he would ask them
pardon, if I desired it, fox the foolish and brutish
things he had done to them; and was very willing
and desirous of living on terms of entire friend-
ship and union with them; and would do any
thing that lay in his power to convince them of
it: arid as for /going to England, he cared not if
he did not go thither these twenty years.
The Spaniards said, they had, indeed, at first,
disarmed and excluded William Atkins, and his two
countrymen, for their ill conduct, as they h#d let
me know. And they appealed to me, for the ne-
cessity they were under to do so; but that William
Atkins had behaved himself so bravely in the great
fight they had with the savages, and on several ac-
<casions since^ and had shewed himself so faithful
to, and concerned for the general interest of them
all, thut they had forgotten all that was past, and
thought he merited as much to be trusted with
arms, and supplied with necessaries, as any of
them; ,and that they had testified thei? satisfaction
in him, by committing the cpmmand to him, next
to the governor himself; and as they had^an ejotire
confidence in*him, and all hi^ countrymen,, sp they
acknowledged, they hajd medted tjb^ $oifcfid§nce?
by all the methods thkt lionest mfen could merit to
be valued and trusted: and they most heartily em-
braced the occasion of giving me this assurance,
that they would never have any interest separate
from one another.
Upon these frank and open declarations of
friendship, we appointed the next day to dine all
together; and indeed we made a splendid feast. I
caused the ship's cook and his mate to come on
shore, and dress our dinner; and the old cook's
mate we had on shore, assisted. We brought on
shore six pieces of good beef, and four pieces of
pork, out of the ship's provision, with our punch
bowl, and materials to fill it; and in particular, I
gave them ten bottles of French claret, and ten
bottles of English beer; things that neither the
Spanianls; oy the Englishmen, had tasted for many
years; and which, it may be supposed, they were
exceeding glad of.
The Spaniards added to our feast five whole kids,
which the cooks roasted; and three of them were
sent covered up close, on board our ship to the
seamen, that they might feast on fresh meat from
ox\ shore, ,as we did with their salt meat from on
board*
After this feast, at which we were very inno-
cently merry, I brought out my cargo of goods,
wiierein, that there might be no dispute about di-
viding, I shewed them that there was sufficient for
thepn all;rand desired, that they might all take an
equal .quantity of the goods that were for wear-
ing; that is to say, equal when made up. As first, '
I distributed linen sufficient to make every one of
them four shirtsj and, at the Spaniard's request,
afterwards made them tip six; these were exceed-
ing comfortable to them, having been what, as I
may say, they had long since forgot the use of, or
what it was to wear them.
I allotted the thin English stuffs, which I men-
tioned before, to make every one a light coat, like
a frock; which I judged fittest for the heat of the
season, cool and loose; and ordered, that when-
ever they decayed, they should make more, as they
thought fit. The like for pumps, shoes, stock-
ings, and hats, &c.
1 cannot express what pleasure, what satisfac-
tion, sat upon the countenances of all these poor
men, when they saw the care I had taken of them,
and how well I had furnished them: they told me,
I was a father to them; and that, havipg such a
correspondent as I was, in so rembte a part of the
world, it would make them forget that they were
left in a desolate place; and they all voluntarily
engaged to me, not to lfeave the place without my
consent.
Then I presented to them the people I had
brought with me; particularly the taiidr, the smith,
and the two carpenters, all of them most necessary
people; but above all, my general artificer, than
whbm' they could not name any thing that was
more needftl to them; and the tailor, to shew his
concern for them*, went to work immediately, and
With my l^ave/made them every one a shirt the
first* thing he did,; and, which was still more, he
taught the women not only how to sow and stitch,
and use the needle, but made them assist to make
the* siMtts for their* htfsbaifcW atod for all thfr rest ]
VOL. IT. T
As for the carpenters, I scarce need mention
how useful they were, for they took in pieces all
my clumsy, unhandy things, and made them cle-
ver, convenient tables, • stools, bedsteads, cup-
boards, lockers, shelves, and every thing they
wanted of that kind.
But, to let them see how nature made artificers
at first, I carried the carpenters to see William At-
kins's basket-house, as I called it; and they both
owned, they never saw an instance of such na-
tural ingenuity before; nor any thing so regular,
and so handily built, at least of its kind: and one
of thetn, when he saw it, after musing a good while,
turning about to me, I am sure, says he, that man
has no need of ti$; you need do tiothing but give
him tools.
Then I brought them out all my store of tools,
and gave every man a digging spade, a shovel, and
a rake, for we had no harrows or ploughs; and, to
every separate pl^ce, a pick-axe, a crow, a broad-
axe, and a saw; always appointing, that as often
as any were broken, or worn out, they should be
supplied, without grudging, out of > the general
stores that I left behind.
Nails, staples, hinges, hammers, chisels, knives,
scissars, and all sorts of tools and iron-work, they
had without tale, as they required; for no man
would care to take more than they wanted; and
he must be a fool that would waste or spoil them,
on any account whatever. And for the use of the
smith, I left two tons of unwrought iron for a
supply.
My magazine of powder and arms, Which I
I
J
•X1
brought them, was such even to profusion, that
they could not but rejoice at them; for now they
could march as I used to do, with a musket upon
each shoulder, if there was occasion; and were
able to fight 1000 savages, if they had but some
little advantages of situation; which also they
could not miss of, if they had occasion.
I carried on shore with me the young man whose
mother was starved to death, and the maid also;
she was a sober, well-educated, religious young
woman, and behaved so inoffensively, that every
one gave her a good word. She had, indeed, an
unhappy life with us, there being no woman in the
ship but herself; but she bore it with patience.
After a while, seeing things so well ordered, and in
so fine a way of thriving upon my island, and con-
sidering that they had neither business or acquaint-
ance in the East Indies, or reason for taking so
long a voyage; I say, considering all this, both of
them came to me, and desired I would give them
leave to remain on the island, and be entered
among my family, as they called it.
I agreed to it readily; and they had a little plot
of ground allotted to them, where they had three
tents or houses set up, surrounded with a basket-
work, palisaded like Atkins's, and adjoining to his
plantation; their tents were contrived so, that they
had each of them a room, a part to lodge in, and a
middle tent, like a great store-house, to lay all their
goods in, and to eat and drink in. And now the
other two Englishmen moved their habitation to
the same place; and so the island was divided into
three colonies, and no more; viz. The Spaniards,
t 2
with old Friday, and the first servants, at my old
habitation under the hill, which was, in a word,
the capital city, and where they had so enlarged
and extended their works, as well under as on the
out-side of the hill, that they lived, though per-
fectly concealed, yet full at large. Never was
there such a little city in a wood, and so hid, I be-
lieve, in any part of the world. For I verily be-
lieve, 1000 men might have ranged th<? inland a
month, and, if they had not known there was such
a thing, and looked on purpose for it, they would
not have found it; for the trees stood so thick, and
so close,.and grew so fast matted into one another,
that nothing but cutting them down first could
discover the place, except the two narrow entrances
where they went in and out, could be found;
which was not very easy. One #f them was just
j do,\vn at the water's edge, on the side of the
creek; and it was afterwards above 200 yards to
the-place; and the other was up the ladder at
twice, as I havefalready formerly described it; and
they had a large wood, thick planted, also on the
*opof j the hill, which contained above an acre,
which grew apace, and covered the place from all
.diiscoyery there, with only one narrow place be-
tween two trees, not easy to be discovered, to enter
on that side.
, r^.Q^er^oloiiy >vas , that of Will Atkins'^,
^whercthere^ve^e four families of Englishmen,;!
tt^ean thqse^I had left: the re* >,witjh their wives and
children- thr^e sav^es^that ytrere slaves, the wi-
dow, and children,^ the^nqlishmn* that was
Jcjlled; 17the ..young ipa»^P^Jteinwwi};'and/ bythe
way, we made a wife of her also, before we went
away* There were also the two carpenters and
the tailor, who I brought with me:for them; also
the smith, who was a very necessary man to them,
especially as the gunsmith, to take care of their
arms; and my other man, whom I called Jack of
all trades; who was himself as good almost as
twenty men, for he was not only a very ingenious
fellow, but a very merry fellow; and, before I
went away, we married him to the honest maid
that came with the youth in the ship, whom I
mentioned before.
And now I speak of marrying, it brings me na-
turally to say something of the French ecclesiastic
that I had brought with me out of the ship's crew,
whom I took at sea. It is true, this man was a
Roman, and perhaps, it may give offence to some
hereafter, if I leave any thing extraordinary upon
record, of a man, whom, before I begin, I must
(to set him out in just colours) represent in terms
very much to his disadvantage, in the account of
Protestants; as first, that he was a Papist; secondly,
a Popish priest; and thirdly, a French Popish
priest.
But justice demands of me to give him a due'cha-
racter; and I must say, he was a grave, sober, pious,
and most religious person; exact in his life, exten-
sive iiVdiis charity, and exemplary in almost every
thinjfccha' did. What, then, can any one say against
my being very sensible of the value of such a man.,
notwithstanding his profession? Though it may
be my opinion, perhaps, as well as the opinion of
others, who shall read this^ that he was mistaken*
The first hour that I bega» to converse with
biip, - after he had agreed to go with nie to <th#
East Indies, I found reason to delight exceedingly
in his conversation. And he first began, with
me about religion, in the most obliging manneu
imaginable.
Sir, says he, you have not only, under.GoD (and
at that he crossed his breast) saved my life, but
you have admitted me to go this*voyage iji^yorur
ship, and by your obliging civility, have ta*kenm#
into your family, giving me an opportunity^of free
conversation. Now, Sir, says he, you see by my*
habit what lmy profession i is; and I guess by/yotro
nation, what your's is: Lm&y.thinkit is myf duty*
and doubtless it is so, to use my utmost .endea^
vours, on^ all occasions,^ ta bring all the souls 4>hat
I can to the knowledge of the truth, aud to em^
brace the Catholic .doctrine*; but, as I am here
under ^your permission, a&d in your family, I am
bound (injustice to your kindness, as well as ir*
decency and good manners, to be under your go*
Vjeramen-t; and therefore l>shalt not,*without your
leave, enter* into any debates on the points of reH
ligion, in which we may not agree, further than
yoU'&halLjgive me le^ve.

us; and if we'did 'not converse without any dislike
otfeither side, upon that score, it would be his
fattiJ^ not bin's. «
>Hfe relied,'That he though* our conversation
m%hfcfoe easily separated from disputes; that it was
not his business to cap principles with every man,
h&^discoursed with; kndihat he rather desired me
to* converge with him as a gentleman, than as a
reiigtetite; tfhait if I would give him leave, at any
ti*e' *to 'discourse upoa religious subjects, he
wQ$ld tidily comply "with fa; and that then he did
n*>t AdritiV but I would allow him also to defend
hfe dwfl' opinions, as well as he could: but that,
witti&ut ihy leave, he wbuld not break m upon me
with any such thing.
'fie told me further, that he would not cease to
dOl8ll that became him in his office, as a priest, as
Well as a private Christian, to procure the goods
of the ship, and the safety of all that was in her;
and though, perhaps, we would not join with him,
and he could not pray with us, he hoped he might
pray for<uvwhich he would do upon all occasions.
In this manner we conversed; and, as he was-of &
mo&t obliging gentlemanlike behaviour, so he was,
if I may be allowed to say so, a man of good sense,
and,'&s T believe, of great learning.

That his first intent was, to have gone to Martinico;
and that he went on board a ship bound thither
at St. Maloes; but being forced into Lisbon in bad
weather, the ship received some damage, by run-
ning aground in the mouth of the river Tagus, and
was obliged to unload her cargo there. *That find-
ing a Portuguese ship there, hound to the Ma-
deiras, and ready to sail, and supposing he should
easily meet with a vessel there bound to Martinico,
he went on board, in order to sail to the Madeiras;
but the master of the Portuguese ship, being but
an indifferent mariner, had been out. b£-his reck-
oning, and they drove to Fial; where, however, *
he happened to find a very good market for his
cargo, which was corn; and therefore resolved not
to go to the Madeiras; but to load salt at the Iste,
of May, to go away to Newfoundland. He had
no remedy in the exigence, but to go with the
ship; and had a pretty good voyage as far as the
Banks, (so they call the place where they catch
the fish) where meeting~with a French ship bound*
from France to Quebec, in the river of Canada, and
frtmi thence to Martinico, to carry provisions, he
thought he should have an opportunity * to com-
plete his first design. But when he came to Que-
bec, the master of the ship died, and the ship pro-
ceeded no further. So the next voyage he shipped
himself for France, in the ship^that^as burnt, when
we took them up at sea, and^tlien-, shipped them
With us for the East Indies, as> I have already saicj-
Thus he had been disappointed in five voy^ge^ all^
as I may call it, in one voyage, besides what I shall
have occasion to mention further of the same per-
son. ,
But I shall not make digressions into other men's
stories, which have no relation to my own. I re-
turn to what concerns our affair in the island. He
Game to me one morning, for he lodged among us
all the while we were upon the island; and it hap-
pened to be just when I was going to visit the En-
glishmen's colony, at the furthest part of the island;
I say, he came,to me, and told me, with a very
grave countenance, that he had, for two or three
days, desired an opportunity of some discourse
with me, which, he hoped, would not be displeas-
ing to me,, because he thought it might, in some
measure, correspond with my general design,
which was the prosperity of my new colony; and,
perhaps, might put it, at least, more than he yet
thought it was, in the way of Gop's blessing.
I looked a little surprised at the last part of his
dbcQurse; and turning a little short, How, Sir, said
I, can it be said, that we are not in the way of
God's blessing, after such visible assistances, and
wonderful deliverances, as we have seen here, and
of which I have given you a large account?
If you had pleased, Sir, * says he, (with a world
of modesty, and yet with great readiness) to have
heard me, you would have fbiwid nor room to have
been displejased, much Jess to think so hard of me
that I should suggest, that you have not had won;
derful, assistances and deliverances. And, J hope,
on your behalf, that you are in the way of God's
blessing, and yoar desigar is exceeding good, and
VOL. If, tJ
\Vill prosper. " But,' Sir) kaid he, though it tyere
more so, than is even possible to ^ou, yet thfet^e
may be some among you that are not equally right
in their actions. And you know, that in the story
Of Isfkely one Achan, in the camp, removed GtOd'£
blessing from them, and turned his hand so^ainst
them, that thirty-sixf of th*im(; though not coti-
corned in the crime, were the 61yects of divitife
vettgeaiice, and bore the weight* of ' that puiiish-
ment.
I was sensibly touched5 With this discourse; and
told him his infereuee Was' so sjust, }attd, tine whole
design seemed so Sincere, 'and was really so drelik

And, in thfe m^atj- time, because it'seemed, that
what w£ had both to say, might take up some
time, I told hita I was going to the Englishman's

Why then, SiV^ays he, b^plteased to give me
leate to lay down a'^few propositions, as the foun-
dation of what I haveTt^sy,ithatfw^ may not dif-
fer in the general principles^ tiiccag^w^ may be jo£
some differing opinions in tlj^pracriioe'XfS particu-
lars. First; Sir> though tfe^fferin mvmi^ the
doctrinal articles bf religion, att#*t W&&J wktfppy
that it is so, especially ifo^hfe cm$ toe^egajs^ I
shajil shew afterwards; yet, there are some general
principles in vyhich we both agr$e; viz. First, that
there k a God; and that this God, having given
us some stated general rules for our service and
.obedience, we ought not willingly and knowingly
to offend him, either by neglecting to do what>he
has commanded, or by doing what has expressly
forbidden j and let pur different religions be what
they .will, tfaU general principle is readily owned
by us all. That the blessing of God does not 01-
4mai% follow a presumptuous sinning against his
•command; and every, good Christian will be a£-
f£etionatel$r concerned to present any that a?£
tinder his care, living in a total neglect of Gon %&4
Jbis commands. It is notour men being Protes-

that they should live in as little distarncenfromr and

J could not yet imagine what he aimed at,
and told him I 'granted Mh he, had said; and
thanked him, that he would so far concern him-
selffor us; land b^gg^d he would explain the par-
ticulars of what foe %d qbseclved, th£t, like Joslmat,
{ta takie.his ^own pav^ble)\I might put away the
<aeci$rsed thing fro* u^ K
Why then, Sir, *fsays he, I will take the liberty
*ydu|*iv*ei.«Be;j andlthere are three things, which,

should rejoice, for yoitr sake, and their own, to see
removed. And, Sir, says he, I promise mysfclf that
you will fully agree with me in them all, as soon
as I name them; especially, because I shall con-
vince you, that every one of them may, with great
ease, and very much to your satisfaction, be re-
medied. x
He gave me no leave to put in any more civili-
ties, but went on. First, Sir, says he, you hate
here four Englishmen, who have fetched womeh
fiom among the savages, and have taken them as
their wives, and have had many children by them
all, and yet are not married to them after any
stated legal manner, &s the laws of God and^m&n
require; and therefore are yet> itf the setose of both,
no less than adulterers, and living in adultery.
To this, Sir, says he, I know you will object, that
there was no clergymen, or "priest of any kind, or
of any profession, to perform the ceremony: nor
any pen and ink, or paper, to write down a con-
tract of marriage*- and' hhve It signed betweefi
them* And I know al§o, $ir, whdfc the Spaniard
governor has told you; I mean, of the agreement
that he obliged thenf to n^k&^ften they took these
women, viz. <That they should chuse them oiit by

one another %& man and wife, but in the formal and
l#gal obligation that there is in tlie contract, to
compel the man and woman, at all times, to own
and acknowledge each other; obliging the man to
abstain from all the other women, to engage in no
other contract while these subsist; and on all oc-
casions, as ability allows, to provide honestly for
/them, and their children; and to oblige the women
to the same, or like conditionsv mutatis mutandis,
on their side.-
•>, Now, Si}\ says he, these meu may, when they
rpkase, or when occasion presents, abandon these
vwomen, disown their children, leave them to
parish,, and take othef women, and many them
whilst the$e are living. f And here he added, with
some warmth, How, Sir, i$ God honoured in this
.unlawful liberty? And how shall a blessing succeed

. tconfes?, I was strijqk at the thing itself, but
much move with the,{Convincing arguments he sup-
ported it with: for k was certainly true, that

children, an4 the women to the same with their
husbands, had been "an effectual lawful marriagi
in the sight of God; and it was a great neglect
tfett it was not done.
But I thought to have gotten off with my young
priest, by telling him, that all that part was done
when I was not here; and they had lived so many
years with them now, that if it was adultery, it
was past remedy; they could do nothing in it now.
Sir, says he, asking your pardon for such free-
dom, you are right in this; that it being done in
your absence, you could not be charged with that
part of the crime. But I beseech you, flatter not
yourself, that you are not therefore under an obli-
gation to do your uttermost now to put an end to
it. How can you think, but that, lpt the time past
li^e on wliom it will, all the guilt, for the future,
will lie entirely upon you? Because it is certainly
in your power now to put an fcnd to it; and in no-
body's power but your's.
I was so dull still, that I did not take him right;
but I imagined, that, by putting an £nd to it, he
meant, that I should part them, and not suffer them
to live together any longer; and I said to him, I
could not do that by atay means, for that it would
put the whole island in confusion. He seemed sur-
prised that I should so far mistake him. IsTo, "Sir,
says be, I do not taekn that you "should separate
them, but legally ^nd effectually marry them now1.
And, Sir, ^V rpjway of marrying friay not be so
easy to recQiicifb them tp, thougft it will be as ef-
fectual, eveplby your bwii laws; sx> your way rti&V
be as wel| W£or§ CrG|i>; an^as validt ambnjg'm^n;*I
mean, by a written contract, signed by Loth man and
woman, and by all the witnesses present; which
all the laws of Europe would decree to be valid.
I was amazed to see so much true piety, and
so much sincerity of zeal, besides the unusual im-
partiality in his discourse, as to his own party or
church, and such a true warmth for the preserving
people that he had no knowledge of, or relation
to; I say, for preserving them from transgressing
the laws of God; the like of which I had indeed
not met with any where. But recollecting what
he had said of marrying them by a written con-
tract, which I knew would stand too, I returned
it back upon him, and told him, I granted all that
he had said to be just, and, on his part, very kind;
that I would discourse with the men upon the
point now, when I came to them. And I knew
no reason why they should scruple to let him
marry them all; which I knew well enough would
be granted to be as authentic and valid in England,
as if they were married by one of our own clergy-
men. What was afterwards done in this matter, t
shall speak of by itself.
I then pressed him to tell me, what was the se-
cond complaint which he had to make; acknow-
ledging, that I was very much his debtor for the
first; and thanked him heartily for it. He told
me he would use the same'freedom and plainness
in the second; and hopcel I would'take it as well:
and this was, that notwithstanding these English
subjects of mine, as be .called them, had lived with'
these women for almost' seve,nv ye'ars, anfd had
taught them to' speafc finglisli,' ari&'eVeiPto tea$
it; and that they were, as he perceived, women of
tolerable understanding, and capable of instruc-
tion; yet they had not to this hour taught them
any thing of the Christian religion; no, not so
much as to know that there was a God, or a wor-
ship, or in what manner God was to be served;
or that their own idolatry, and worshipping they
knew not who, was false and absurd.
This, he said, was an unaccountable neglect,
and what God would certainly call them to an ac-
count for; and, perhaps, at last take the work out
of their hands. He spoke this very affectionately
and warmly. I am persuaded, says he, had those
men lived in the savage country, whence their
wives came, the savages would have taken more
pains to have brought them to be idolaters, and
to worship the devil, than any of these men, so
far as I can see, has taken with them, to teach
them the knowledge of the true God. Now, Sir,
said he, though I do not acknowledge your reli-
gion, or you mine, yet we should be all glad to
see the devil's servants, and the subjects of his
kingdom, taught to know the general principles
of the Christian religion; that they might at least
hear of God, and of a Redeemer, and of the resur-
rection, and of a future state, things which we all
believe; they had at least been so much nearer
coming into the bosom of the true church, than
they are now, in the public profession of idolatry,
and devil-worship.
I could hold no longer; I took him in my arms,
and embraced him with an excess of passion: How
far, said I to him,, have I been from understanding
the most essential part of a Christian, viz. to love
the interest of the Christian church, and the good
of other men's souls! I scarce have known what
belongs to being a Christian. O, Sir, do not say-
so, replied he; this thing is not your fault No,
said I, but why did I never lay it to heart as well
as you? It is not too late yet, said he; be not too
forward to condemn yourself. But what can be
done now? said I, you see I am going away. Will
you give me leave, said he, to talk with these poor
men about it? Yes, with all my heart, said I; and
I will oblige them to give heed to what you say
too. As to that, said he, wc must leave them to
the mercy of Christ; but it is our business to assist
them, encourage them, and instruct them; and, if
you will give me leave, and God his blessing, I
do not doubt but the poor ignorant souls shall be
brought home into the great circle of Christianity,
if not into the particular faith that we all embrace;
and that even while you stay here. Upon this, 1
said, I shall not only give you leave, but give you
a thousand thanks for it. What followed on this
account I shall mention also again in its place*
I now pressed him for the thiid article in which
we were to blame: Why really, says he, it is of
the same nature, and I will proceed (asking your
leave) with the same plainness as before: It is
about your poor savages yonder, who are (as I
may say) your conquered subjects. It is a maxim,
Sir, that is, or ought to be received among all
Christians, of what church, or pretended church
soever, viz. that Christian knowledge ought to be
propagated by all possible means, and on all pos-
sible occasions. It is on this principle that our
ehurch sends missionaries iato Persia, India, and
vol. ir, x '
Chinas and that our clergy, even of the superior
sort, willingly engage in the most hazardous voy-
ages, and the most -dangerous residence, among
murderers and barbarians, to teach them the know*
ledge of the true God, and to biing them over to
embrace the Christian faith. Now, Sir, you; haye
an opportunity here, to, have six or seven*£nd>
thirty poor savages brought over from idolatry* tto
the knowledge of God, their Maker and Redeemer,
that I wonder how you can pass by such an occa-
sion of doing good; which is really worth the ex-
pense of a man's whole life.
I was now struck dumb indeed, ami had wot
one word to say: I had here a spirit of true Chris*-
tian zeal for God and religion *befoi*e fne^lefrhis
particular principles be of what kind^soever. As
for me, I had not so much aseiit^Pt^ined a thought
of this in my heart before; and? I believe^ should
not have thought of it; for lobbed* upon tto®se
savages as slaves, and people^ 'whbmj >had«weany

should enever ftake any natice of this before, but
with reflecting what notice I am able to take of it
now. You know, Sir, said I, what circumstances
I am in; I am bound to the East Indies, in a ship
freighted by merchants, and to whom it would be
an insufferable piece of injustice to detain their
§hip heps, the men lying all this while at victuals
and-vtfajges upon the owner's account: it is true, I
agreed to be allowed twelve days here; and if I
fctaymare, I musk pay 31. sterling per diem de-
murrage; nor can I stay upon demurrage above
eight days more; and I, have been here thirteen
days already; so that I *am perfectly unable to
engage in this work, unless li would suffer myself
to be left behmd here again; in which case, if this
single ship should miscarry in any part of her voy-
age, I should be just in the .same condition that I
iffftsJleft.ui hefe* at first; and from which I have
.been $o wonderfully delivered.

Upon this he faced about, just before me, as he
walked along, and, putting me to a full stop, made
me a very low bow. I most heartily thank God-,
and you, Sir, says he for giving me so evident a
call lo so blessed a work; and if you think your-
self discharged from it, and desireme to undertake
it, I will most readily do it, and think it a Happy
reward for all the hazards and difficulties of such
a broken, disappointed voyage as I have met with,
that I have dropped at last into so glorious a
work.
I discovered a kind of rapture in his face, while
he spoke this to me; his eyes sparkled like fire,
his face glowed* and his colour came and went, as
if he had been falling into fits; in a word, he was
fired with the joy of being embarked in such a
work. I paused a considerable' while before I
could tell what to say to him; for I was really
surprised to find a man of such sincerity and zeal,
and carried out in his zeal beyond the ordinary
rate of men, not of his profession only, but even
of any profession whatsoever: but, after I had
considered it a while, I asked him seriously, if he
was in earnest, and that he would venture on the
single consideration of an attempt on those poor
people, to be locked jip in an unplanted island for,
perhaps, his life; and at last, might not know
whether he should be able to do them any good
or not?
He turned short upon me, and asked me, what
I called a venture? Pray, Sir, said he, what do
you think I consented to go in your ship to the
East Indies for? Nay, said I, that I know not, un-
fil 3
 56 b
Jess it was to pueach to the Indians. Doubtless it
.was, said he And do you think, if I can convert
these seven-and-thirty men to the faith of Christ,
it is not worth my time, though I should never be
fetched off the island again? Nay, is it not infi-
nitely of more worth to save so many souls, than
,-my life is, or the. life of twenty more of the same
profession? Yes, Sir, says he, I would give Christ
<and the Blessed Virgin thanks all my days, if I
could be made the least happy instrument of sav-
ing the souls of these poor men, though I was
never to. set my foot off this island, or see my
native country any more: but since you will
honour me, says he, with putting me into this
work, (for which I will pray for you all the days
.of my life) I have one humble petition to you,
said he, besicles. What is that? said I. Why,
says he, it is, that you will leave your man Friday
with me, to be my interpreter to them, and to
assist me; for, without some help, I cannot speak
to them, or they to me.
I was sensibly troubled at his requesting Friday,
^because I could not think of parting with him,
and that for many reasons: he had been the com-
panioii of my travels; he was not only faithful to
.me,, but sincerely affectionate to the last degree;
and I had resolved to do something considerable
for him, if he out-lived me, as it was probable "he
, would: then I knew, that as I had bred Friday
lip tjp be a Protestant, it would quite confound
him, to bring him to embrace another profession;
and he would never, while his eyes were open,
.believe that his old master was an heretic, and
would be damned; and this might in the end ruin
the poor fellow's principles, and so turn him back
again to his first idolatry.
However, a sudden thought relieved me in this
strait, and it was this: I told him, I could not say-
that I was willing to part with Friday on any ac-
count whatever; though a work, that to him was
of more value than his life, ought to me to be pf
much more value than the keeping or parting with
a servant. But, on the other hand, I was per-
suaded, that Eriday would by no means consent
to part with me; and then to force him to it,
without his consent, would be manifest injustice;
because I had promised I would never put him
away; and he had promised and engaged to me
that he would never leave me, unless I put him
away.
He seemed yery much concerned<at it; for lie
had no rational access %o these poor people, seeing
lie did not understand one wordsof their language,
nor they one word of his. Tor remove this diffi-
culty, I told him, Friday's father had learned
Spanish, which I found he also -understood^; ami
he should serve him- for an interpreter; so he was
much better satisfied, and nothing could persuade
liim but he would stay to endeavour to convert
them; but Providence gave another and very happy
turn to alltthis. *
I come back now* to the first part of his objec-
tions. Whence c,ame Jjo^hc^Eipgljslmien, I sent
for £hem aUi4qgf^her-£ <&pdcq£t®$ spip£ a^cojsmis
^given them of wha,t I hj*dfdonft&r t$mv><w& ^toat
.necessary things I^fUpfqvi<jIi#hfp? d4fepn* -and
how 'fliey were distributed, which they were
sensible of, and very thankful for; I began to
talk to them of the scandalous life they led, and
gave them a fiill* account of the notice the clergy-
man had already taken of it; and, arguing how
imchristian and irreligious a life it was, I first
askied them, if they were married men or bache-
lors? They soon explained their condition to me,
and shewed me that two of them were widowers,
and the other three were single men or bachelors.
I asked them; with what conscience they could
take these women, and lie with them, as they
had done, call them their wives, and^iave so many
cftrildren by them/ and not be married lawfully to
tltfem? <
**£They all gave me the -answer that I expected,
viz,*that there was nobody to marry them; that

but would take care, that what I did should be for
the women and children, without them; and that
unless they would give some assurances that they
would marry the women, I could not think it was
convenient they should continue together as man
and wife; for that it was both scandalous to men,
and offensive to God, who they could not think
would bless them if they went on thus.
All this passed as I expected; and they told me,
especially Will Atkins, who seemed now to speak
for the rest, that they loved their wives, as well as
if they had been born in their own native country,,
and would not leave them upon any account what?*
ever; and they did verily believe their wives wexe>
as virtuous and as modest, and did, to the utmost
of their skill, as much for them, and for their chil-
dren, as any women could possibly do; and they
would not part with them on any account. And*
Will Atkins, for his own particular, added, if any
man would take him away, and offer to carry hinjj
home to England/and to make him captain of the
best man of war in the navy, he would not go with,
him, if he might not carry his wife and children
with him; and if there was a clergyman in the
ship, he would be married to her now, with all his
heart.
This was just as I would have it; the priest was
not with me at that moment, but was not far off
So, to try him further, I told him I had a clergy-
man with me, and, if he was sincere, I would have
him married the Bext morning ;<4fld bade him cw^

the minister, was a Frenchman, and could not
speak English; but that I would act the clerk be-
tween them. He never so much as asked m£
Whether he was a Papist or Protestant; which wafc
indeed what I was afraid of. But, I say, they
n^Ve^ inquired about it. So we parted. I went
back to my clergyman; and Will Atkins went in
tor t&lk with his companions. I desired the French
ge'ntldman not to say any thing to them till the
bttihess was thorough ripe; and I told him what
afrs^ver the men had given me.

the next morning, where I brought out my clergy-
man: and though he had not on a minister's gown,
after the manner of England, or the habit of a
priest, after the manner of France; yet having a
black vest, something like a cassock, with a sash
round it, he did not look very unlike a minister;
and as for his language, I was interpreter.
But the seriousness of his behaviour to them,
and the scruples he made of marrying the women,
because they were not baptized, and professed
Christians, gave them an exceeding reverence for
his person; and there was no need after that to in-
quire whether he was a clergyman or no.
Indeed I was afraid his scruple would have been
carried so far, as that he would not have married
them at all: nay, notwithstanding all I was able to
say to bim, he resisted me, though modestly, yet
very steadily; and at last, refused absolutely to
marry them, unless he had first talked with the
men, and the women too; and though at first I was
fi little backward ta it? yet at last I agreed to it
with a good will, perceiving the sincerity of his
design.
When he came to them, he let them know that
I had acquainted him with their circumstances, and
with the present design; that he was very willing
to perform that part of his function, and marry
them, as I had desired; but that before he could
do it, he must take the liberty to talk witli them;
he told them, that In the sight of all different men,
and in the sense of the lawsy <j>f Society, they had

marry, or effectually separating them from one
another now, could put an end to it; but there was
9, difficulty in it too, with respect to the laws of
Christian matrimony, which he was not fully sa-
tisfied about, viz. That of marrying one that is a
professed Christian, to a savage, an idolater, and
an heathen, one that is not baptized; and yet that
he did not see, that theie was time left for it, to
cpcjeavour to peisuacle the women to be baptized,
pr to profess the name of Christy whom they had,
lie doubtedx heard nothing of, and without which
tliey could not be baptized.
He told me, he doubted they were but indif-
ferent Christians themselves; that they had but
Jittle knowledge of God^ or his ways; and there-
fore Jae could not expect, that they had said much
£0 their wives on that head yet; 'but that unless
they Ayould promise him to use their endeavours
with?,their wives, to persuade them to become
Christians* and would as well as they could in-
struct them i|i the knowledge and belief of God
t^tm^de them, and to worship Jesus Christ that
redeemed them, he could not marry them; fpr he
\ypuld have no l^nd in joining Christians with sa-
vages; nQr was it consistent with the principles of
$ie tChristian religion; and was, indeed, expressly
Jprfcidden in G^d's law.
< They heard ^11 this very attentively, and I deli-
v^$d |t v$ry.faithfully to th£m,j from his mouth,
as ne^r hi^yvp \^ords as I jQoy*ld, only sometimes

Always y^ry ifaitlifully distinguished, between what
I said from myself, and what were the clergyman's
words. They told me, it was very true what the gen-
tleman Tiad said, that they weie but very indifferent
Christians themselves, and that they had never
talked to their wives about religion. Lord, Sir,
says Will Atkins, howT should we teach them reli-
gion? Why, we know nothing ourselves; and be-
sides, Sir, said he, should we go to talk to them of
God, and Jesus Christ, and heaven and hell, it
would be to make them laugh at us, and ask us,
what we believe ourselves? And if we should tell
them, we believe all the things that we speak of to
them, such as of good people going to heaven, and
wicked people to the devil, they would ask usj,
where we intended to go ourselves, who believe
all this, and yet are such wicked fellows, as we
indeed are. Why; Sir, said Will, it is enough to
give them a surfeit of religion, at first hearing:
folks must have some religion themselves, before
they pretend to teach other people.—Will Atkins,
said I to him, though I am afraid what you say
has too much truth in it, yet can you not tell your
wife, that she is in the wrong? that there is God';
and a religion better than her own; that her gods
are idols; that they can neither hear nor speak;
that there is a great Being that made all things,
and that can destroy all that he has made; that he
rewards the good, and punishes the bad; that we
are to be judged by him, at last, for all we do here:
you are not so ignorant, but even nature itself will
teach you, that all tliis is tru^; arid, I am satisfied
you know it all to be true, and belieye it youx-
self,
That is true, Sir, said Atkins; but with what
face can I say any thing to my wife of all this,
when she will tell me immediately, it cannot be
true?
Not true! said I,—what do you mean by that?
Why, Sir, said he, she will tell me it cannot be
true, that this God (I shall tell her of) can be just,
ox can punish or reward, since I am not punished,
and sent to the devil, that have been such a wicked
creature as she knows I have been, even to her,
afid to every body else; and that I should be suf-
fered to live, that have been always acting so con-
trary to what I must tell her is good, and to what
I ought to have done
Why truly, Atkins, said I, I am afraid thou
speakest too much truth i and with that I let the
clergyman know what Atkins had said; for he was
impatient to know. O! said the priest, tell him
there is one thing will make him the best minister
in the world to his wife, and that is repentance;
for none teach repentance like true penitents. He
wants nothing but to repent, and then he will be
so much the better qualified to instruct his wife;
he will then be able to tell her, that there is not
only a Godr and that he is the just rewarder of
good and evil; but that he is a merciful Being,
and, with infinite goodness and long suffering, for-
bears to punish those, that offend; waiting to be
gracious, and willing not the death of a sinner, but
rather that he should return apd Jive; that he oftep
suffers wicked men to go on ^ long time, and even
reserves damnation to the general day of retribu-
tion: that it is a clear evidence of God, and of a
future state, that righteous men receive not their
reward, or wicked men their punishment, till the^
come into another world; and this will lead him
to teach hrs wife the doctrine of the resurrection^
and of the last judgment: let him but repent for
himself, he will be an excellent preacher of repent^
ance to his wife.
I repeated all this to Atkins, who looked very
serious all the while, and who, we could easily
perceive, was more than ordinarily affected with
it: when being eager, and hardly suffering me to
make an end—I knew, all this, tfiasterrsays'he, and
a great deal more; but I have not the impudent
to talk thus to my wife: when God, and my owi
conscience knows, and my wife!will be aft undeni-
able evidence against me, that I have lived as if I
had never heard 6f God', or a future state, or any
thing about it; and to talk of itiy repenting, alas!
(and with that he fetched'a deep Sigh; and I could
see that tear3 stood in his" eyes) H is past all 'that
with me. Past it! Atkins, safd LL What dokt
thou mean by that? I know Well enough what £
mean, Sir, says he; I mean it is tdo late; and that
it is too true. ' T '
I told my clergyman wofd' for word what he
said: the poor zealou^ priefetf (1 ttiust call him so$
for be his opinion(what it will, he* had certainly a
most singular affection for' the good of otheV
men's souls; and It watild'be iktd to think he had
not the like fot his d&&;Jl h$, this fcdalous, affect
tionate man)'could riot Ji*dfrain tekfs^Isb. But re--
covering himself/ he'^drtb^ief; A*fr MmJbdi onfe
question. Is he easy that it is too late, or is he
troubled, and wishes it were not so? I put the
question fairly to Atkins; and he answered with
a great deal of passion, How could any man be
easy in a condition that certainly must end in eter-
nal destruction? That he was far from being easy;
but that, on the contrary, he believed it would one
time or the other ruin him.
What do you mean by that? said I. Why, he
said, he believed he should one time or another,
ejut his owa tfrroa^ tp put an end to the terror
of it
The clergyman shook his head, with a great con-
cern* in his face^ when I told him all this; but,
$ur#ing quick tp n\e uppn it, said, If that be his
ease, you may assume him it is not too late: Christ
wUl give him repentance., But pray, s^ys he, ex-
plain this to him, -That as no>man is saved but by
Christ, and the merit of his passion, procuring di-
vine vinercy fos JiipvJ&ow can it be too late for any
man to receive mercy ?t Does he think he is able to
&in Jbeyojod thf ypwer 90: ^ach of divine mercy?
Pray tell hinyThw may kq a, tin^e when provoked
mercy will ^Ipngef strive,* and^hen God may
refuse to hear; but that it is never too late for men
ip afk mertsy; apd?W£tb£trare CJhr^t's servants
are commanded totpjre^ch m§^cy at a}lJftimes, in the
name of J,esiUa Christ* tp aU;tho?e that sincerely

I told^^^si^i-tliis^ md l^e heard me wit]?
great iear^^tpea9| ityfit ^JP^i as if he turne^d
offitl^s diac^utsqia ik& T^sti^fo^jh^said to me?t he
would gQ.^diMvQ^ome^lk^wit}i|}i^y^ so he
went out awhile, and we talked to the rest.' I per-
ceived they were all stupidly ignorant, as to mat-
ters of religion; much as I was when I went
rambling away from my father: and yet that'there
were none of them backward to hear what had
been said; and all of them seriously promised,
that they would talk with their wives about it,
and do their endeavour to persuade them to turn
Christians.
The clergyman smiled upon me, when I re-
ported what answer they gave, but said nothing a
good while; but, at last, shaking his head, We
that are Christ's servants, says he, can go no fur-
ther than to exhort and instruct; and when meu
comply, submit to the reproof, and promise what
we ask, 'tis all we can do; we are bound to accept
their good words; but, believe me, Sir, said lie,
whatever you may have known of the life of that
man you call William Atkins, t believe he is the
only sincere convert among them; I take that
man to be a true penitent; I will not despair of
the rest; but that man is perfectly struck with
the sense of his past life; and I doubt not, but
when he comes to talk of religion to his wife, he
will talk himself effectually into it; for attempting
to teach others is sometimes the best way of teach-
ing ourselves. I knew a man, added he, who hav-
ing nothing but a summary notion of religion him-
self, and being wicked and profligate,' to the last
degree, in his life, made a'thorough reformation ip.
himself, by labouring to convert a Jew: atid if
that poor Aikias begins jbijit, once4o talk serfbjisly
of J[£sus Christ to his wife, my life for it, he talks
himself into a thorough convert, makes himself a
penitent: apd who knows what may follow?
tTpon this discourse, however, and their pro-
noising, as above, to endeavour to persuade their
wives to embrace Christianity, he married the
other three couple; but Will Atkins and his wife
were not yet come in. After this, my clergyman,
waiting a while, was curious to know where At-
kins was gone; and, turning to me, says he, I en-
treat you, Sir, let us walk out of your labyrinth
here, and look; I dare say we shall find this poor
man somewhere or other, talking seriously with
his wife? and teaching her already something of
religion. I began to be of the same mind; so
we went out together; and I carried him a way
which none knew but myself, and where the trees
were so thick, stt9 as that it was not easy to see
though the thicket of leaves, and far harder to
$e?ein, than to see out; when coming to the edge
qf tlie wqod, I saw Atkins, and his tawny savage
\$fe,4 sitting under the shade of a bush, very eager
19 discourse. I §t9pped short, till my clergyman
cpe up to me; and then, having shewed him
^eje they were, we stood and looked very steadily
a£ them a good while.
, We observied him very earnest with her, point-
ing up to the sun, and to every quarter of the
heavens; then down to the earth, then out to the
sea, then to himself, then to her, to the woods, to
the trees. Now, "says my clergyman, you see my
words are made gpod; t*he than preaches to her;
mark Mm; now he ts telBnffttetth%t'our God "has
VOL. II. z
made him, and her, and the heavens, the earthr,
the sea, the woods, the trees, &c. I believe he is,
said I. Immediately we peiceived Will Atkins
start up upon his feet, fall down upon his knees,
and lift up both his hands; we supposed he said
something, but we could not hear him: it was to6
far off for that: he did not continue kneeling h&lf
a minute, but comes and sits down again by iiis
wife, and talks to her again. We perceived theft
the woman very attentive; but whether she Said
any thing or no, we could not tell. While the
poor fellow was upon his knees, I could see the
tears run plentifully down my clergyman's cheeks;
and I could hardly forbear myself; biit it#as*a
great affliction to us both, that we were not tieaV
enough to '{tear any thing tiiat passed betwfeteh
them.
Well, however, w6 could come1 no frearer,^ for
fear of disturbing them: so we resolved to s6e an
end of this'piece of still fconversatfcm; kndit sp6kc
loud enough to tis, without thehtflp of voice. He
sat down again, as I have said, t'lose by her, and
talked again earnestly' to' her\ arid' tWosor thrde
times we could see huh'Vfnfitfafce lief* passionately;
another time we saw him take o\it his handker-
chief, and wipe her eyes, &hd thfen kiss her ag&ih,
with a kind of ^transport ^ery mtusual; and aft£r
several of thes£ thifegs, we sa\fr him bn a sudd&n
jump up a^ain, aftd lend hex* his hand to help ht§r
up; when itfrfriediktely leading her by the hand'a
step or two, th^>:Both kheeleitt doWn together, and
continued so abput two fhilititfe?s: £ ' }
My'friended b^r ftto f^r^Hk^Hy out
qjpud, $t< Paul, St. Paul! behold he prayethl—I
was afraid Atkins would hear him; therefore I en-
treated him to withhold himself awhile, that we
might see an end of the scene, which to me, I
inust confess, was the most affecting, and yet the
jpipst agreeable, that ever I saw in my life. Well,
hfi strove with himself, and contained himself for
.awhile, but was in such raptures of joy to think
thM the poor heathen woman was become a Chris-
tian, that he was not able to contain himself; he
^ept several times; then throwing up his hands,
and crossing his breast, said over several things
qj^culatory, and by way of giving God thanks for
so miraculous a testimony of the success of our
endeavours: some he spoke softly, and I could
not well hear; others audibly; soqie in Latin,
some in French; then two or three times the tears
of joy would interrupt him, that be could notspeak
at alL But I begged that he would compose him-
self, and let us T mpre narrowly and fully observe
^hat^w<3 before ^whicfy he did for a time, and
fche sc$ne ^as(;uot eadefl there yet; for, after the
poor iram and^i§ w^ were risejl again from their
k^ees, we observed he atopjd talking still eagerly to
h$pi and we observe4 by her jnotion that she was
greatly affected wfth what he s^id, by her frequent
lift;ing%up her l^nds, laying hsr kaDcl *? ^er breast,
vamd such> other p^stu^s, as u^ally, express the

I tppk this.«xt^yai t9< tafkwitH my clfiigy roan,

and first, I told him, I was glad to see the particu-
lars we had both been witnesses to; that though I
was hard enough of belief in such cases, yet that I
began to think it was all very sincere here, both in
the man and his wife, however ignorant they both
might be; and I hoped such a beginning would
have yet a more happy end: and who knows, sard
I, but these two may in time, by instruction atid
example, work upon some of the others? Some trf
them! said he, turning quick upon me, ay, upoh
all of them: depend upon it, if those two savages
(for he has been but little better, as you relate it)
should embrace Jesus Christ, they will never leave
till they work upon all the rest; for true religion
is naturally communicative," and he that is once
made a Christian will never leave a pagan behind
him, if he can help it. I owned it was a most
Christian principle to think so, and a testimony
of a true zeal, as well as a generous heart in him.
But, my friend, said I, will you give me liberty to
start one difficulty here? I cannot tell how to ob-
ject the least thing against that affectionate con-
cern which you shew for the'turningthe poor peo-
ple from their paganism to the-Christian religion;
but how does this comfort you, while these peo-
ple are, in your account, out of the pale of the Ca-
tholic church, Without which, you believe there is
no salvation; so that you esteem these but heretics
still; and, for* other reasons, as effectually lost as
the pagans themselves? * i
To this he answered with abundance of candour
and Christian charity, thus, *<Siiy I am a Catholic
of the Roman church, and a priest of the order of
St^ Benedict, and I embrace all the principles of
the Roman faith. But yet, if you will believe me,
&nd this I do not speak in compliment to yo% or
in Respect to my circumstances, and your civilities;
I say, nevertheless, I do not look upon you, who
€&1! yourselves reformed, without some charity. I
dare not say, though I know it is our opinion in
general; yet I dare hot say, that you cannot be
saved; I will by no means limit the mercy of'
Christy so far as to think that he cannot receive
you-into the bosom of his church, in a manner, to
us, iinperceivabie, and which it is impossible for
u& to know i and Lhope you have the same charity
for us. I pray fdaily for your being all restored to
Christ's -church, by whatsoever methods he, who is
all'Wise^ is pleased to direct. In the mean time,
sure, you will allow it to consist with me, as a Ro-
man, to distinguish far between a Protestant and
& Pagans between him that calls on Jesus Chiist,
though in a way which I do not think is accord-
ing to the true' faith; and a savage, a barbarian,
that knows Ao Gob, no Christ* no Redeemer at
fill. And-if you are^notwithin the pale of the Ca-
tholic church, We.hope you are nearer being re-
stored to it> than those that know nothing at all of
Gob, or hi&chutah. I rejoice, therefore, when I
see this poor man, who, you say, has been a profli-
-gate* andalmost amuFderer, kneel down and pray
to Jesus Christ as we suppose he did, though not
fully enlightened; believing that God, from whom
every svtehr wotfte proceeds, will sensibly touch his
heart, and bring him to the further knowledge of
4he< truth' in his wn time; and if G#d sh&liinfla-
ence this poor man to convert and instruct the ig-
norant savage his wife, I can never believe that he
shall be cast away himself: and have I not reason
then to rejoice, the nearer any are brought to the
knowledge of Christ, though they may not be
brought quite home into the bosom of the Catho-
lic church, just at the time when I may desire it;
leaving it to the goodness of Christ to perfect hU
Work in his own time, and his own way? Certainly
I would rejoice, if all the savages in America were
brought, like this poor woman, to pray to God,
though they were to be all Protestants at first, ra-
ther than they should continue pagans and hea-
thens; firmly believing, that he who had bestowed
that first light upon thetn, would further illurtfi-
nate them with a beam of his heavenly grace, and
biing them int6 the pale of his church, when he
should see good.
I wife astonished at the sincerity and temper of
this truly pious? Papist, a<5 much as I Was oppressed
by the power of his reasoning: aiid it presently
occurred to my thoughtd, that if such a temper
was universal, We might be all Catholic Christians,
whatever church or particular profession we joined
to, or joined in; that d spirit bf charity would
soon work us all up into right principles; and, in
a word, as he thought that t~he like charjty would
make us all Catholi'cs, s<Hs told him, I believed,
had all the members 6f his fchurch the like modera-
tion, they would #e>oti be-all'Protestants. And
there we left that part, for we never disputed at
all. -
However, I talked to him atiotlterHvay; and,
taking him by the hand, My friend, said I, I wish
all the clergy of the Roman church, were blessed
with such moderation, and an equal share of your
charity. I am entirely of your opinion; but I must
tell you, that if you should preach such doptrine
iq Spain or Italy r they would put you into the in-
quisition. f
It may be so, said he; I know not what they
xpight do in Spain and Italy; but I will not say
they would be the better Christians for that seve-
rity j for I am sure there is no heresy in too much
charity.

Priest. Ha? amurdeier?
[Here the priest started (for I inteipreted every word as he
spoke it) and looked pale. It seems he believed that Will
had really killed his own father.] '
R. C. No, no, Sir, I do not understand him so*
Will Atkins, explain yourself} you did not kill
your father did you with your own hands?
W. A. No, Sir; I did not cut his throat; but I
cut the thread of all his comforts, and shortened
his days; I broke his heart by the most ungrate-
ful, unnatural return, for the most tender, affec-
tionate treatment that ever father gave, or child
could receive.
IL C. Well, I will not ask you^about your father,
to extort this confession; I pray God give you re-
pentance for it, and forgive; you, that, and all your
other sins: but I asked ryqu, because I see that
though you have not mucl\ learning,.y^t you are
not so ignorant as soriie -are, in things that* are
good; that you have kpown^mQre of religion „
great deal than you have practised.
W. A. Though you, Sir, <fid,not; extort the cojv

are certainly the first that touch ps;' t]?e wounds

R. C. You talk too feelingly and sensible for
me, Atkins; I cannot bear it.
W.A. You bear it, master! I dare say you know
nothing of it.
R. C. Yes, Atkins; every shore, every hill, nay,
I may say, every tree in this island, is witness to
the anguish of my soul, for my ingratitude, and
base usage of a good tender father; a father much
like your's, by your description; and I murdered
my father as well as you, Will Atkins; but think,
for all that, my repentance is short of your's too,
by a great deal.
[I would have said more, if. I- could have restrained my pas-
sions; but I thought this poor man's repentance was so
much sincerer than mine, that I was going to leave oft the
discourse, and retire, for I was surprised with what he said ;
and thought that instead of my going about to teach and
instruct him, the man was made a teacher and instructor to
me, in a most surprising and unexpected manner.]
I laid all this before the young clergyman, who
was greatly affected with it, and said to me, Did I
not say, Sir, that when this man was converted, he
would preach to us all? I tell you, Sir, if this one
man be made a true penitent, here will be no need
of me; he will make Christians of all in the island.
But having a little composed myself, I renewed my
discourse with Will Atkius.
But, Will, said I, how comes the sense of this
matter to touch you just now'
W. A. Sir, you have set me about a work that
has struck a dart throu gh my very soul; I have
been talking about God and religion to my wife,
in order, as you directed me, to make a Christian

Qf her; ^nd she has preached SiUGh a sermon; to me
as I shall never forget while I live.
EL C. No, no; ittis not; your wife has preached
to yon: but when you were moving religious argu*
ments to her, conscience has flung them back> upon
you.
W. A. Ay, Sir, with such a force as is not to b$
resisted.
R. C. Pray, Will, let us know what passed be-r
tween you and your wife; for I know something
of it already,
W. A. Sir, it is impossible to giveyou a full>B£*
count of it: I am too full to hold it, and yet have
HO)tongue to express it; but let her have said what
she will, and thbugh I cannot give you an account
of it, this I can tell you of it, that I resolve to
amend and reform my life
IL C. But tell us some of it. How did you be-
gin, Will?f For this has been an extraordinary case,
that is certain; she has preaqhed a ^ertnon, indeed,
if she has wrought this upon you.
W. A. Why, I fir&fc told her the.juatiuie of onx
laws abput marriage, and what tfre reasons were
that men and women were obliged to eatgr into
such compacts, as it was neither in tfye power of
one or other to break; that otherwise, order* and
justice could not be maintained, and mei^wquld run
from their wives, and abandon their children, mix
confusedly with one another,- and neither families
be kept entire, or inheritances be settled by a legal
descent. [ L ,

the father and daughter, and the son and the mo-
ther.
W. A. I believe, Sir, you are misinformed;—
i^y Wife ffi&ures itie of the contrary, and that they
abhor it. Perhaps, for any further relations, they
may not be 60 exact as we are; but she tells me
they never touch one another in the near relations
you speak of.
ft. C. Well; what did she aay to what you told
her?
W. A. She Safd she liked it vety well; and it was
much better than in her Cdutttty.
R. C. But did you tteil her What marriage was?
W. A. Ay^ ay, there began ail our dialogue. I
asked her, if she would be ttfarfied to ifte our way?
She asked me, What #ay thit w&s? I told her mar-
riage was appointed of Goix; arid here we had a
strStage talk together Indeed, as £\ret man and wife
had, I believe. *
[N.B. This dialogue between W. Atkins and his wife, as
I took it down in writings j^t after he told it me, was as
follows.]
Wife. Appointed by your God! Why, have you
a God in yctat cbuntry?
W. A. Yes, my dear, God is in every country?
» W-tfer* Mo^otir Gdd in xtx$ cfcfftntry,* rnf coun-
try have the great old Benamuckee God.
2 A3
W. A. Child, I am very unfit tQ shew you who
God is; God is in heaven, and made the heaven
and the earth, the sea, and all that in them is. ,
Wife. No makee de earth; no you God makse
de earth; no make my country. i ,
[W. A. laughed a little at her expression of God not making
her country.] *
Wife. No laugh. Why laugh me? This no ting
to laugh.
[He was justly leproved by his wife; for she was moie se-
rious than he at first.] '->,»«« ;
W. A. That is true indeed; I will not^laugh any
more, my dear.
Wife. Why you say, you God make all?
W. A. Yes, child, our God made; the whole
world, and you, and me, and all things; for he is
the only true God; there is no God but he; he
lives for ever in heaven.
Wife. Why you no tell me long ago ?
W. A. That is true indeed; but I have been a
wicked wretch, and have not only forgotten to ac-
quaint thee with any thing before, but have li^ed
without God in the world myself.
Wife. What hav6J you de great jGod in your
country, you no kno\\^ him? T^o say O to him? No
do good ting for him? That no impossible?
W. A. It rs too true though, for all that: we live
as if there was no God in Heaven, or that he had no
power on earth. * 4
Wife. But why God let you do so?v Why he no
makee you good live?
W. A. It is all our own fault
Wife. But you say me, he is great, much great,
have much great power; can make kill when he
will: why he no makee kill when you no serve
him? No say O to him? No be good mans?
W. A. That is true; he might strike me dead,
and I ought to expect it; for I have been a wicked
wretch, that is true: but God is merciful, and
does not deal with us as we deserve.
Wife. But then, do not you tell God tankee for
that too?
W. A. No, indeed; I have not thanked God
for his mercy, any more than I have feared God
for his power.
Wife. Then you God no God; me no think, be-
lieve he be such one, great much power, strong;
no makee kill you, though you makee him much
angry?
W A. What! will my wicked life hinder you
from believing in God! What a dreadful creature
am I! And what a sad truth is it, that the horrid
ives of Christians hinder the conversion of hea-
thens!
Wife. How me tink you have great much God
up there, (she points up to heaven,) and yet no do
well, no do good ting? Can he tell? Sure he no
tell what you d<?.
W. A. Yes, yes, he knows and sees ail things;
he hears us speak, s$es what wre do, knows what
we think, though: we do not speak.
Wife. What! he no he^r you swear, curse, speak
the great damn?
W. A. Yes, yes, he hears it all.
Wife. Where be then the muchee great power
strong?
W. A. He is merciful; that is all we can say
for it; and this proves him to be the true God :
He is God, and not man; and therefore we are
not consumed.
[Here Will Atkins told us, he was struck with horror to
think how he could tell his wire so clearly, that God sees*
and hears, and knows the secret thoughts of the heart, and
all that we do 5 and yet that he had dared to do all the
vile things he had done.]
Wife. Merciful! what you call dat?
W. A. He is our father and maker; and he
pities and spares us.
Wife, So then he never makee kill, never angry
when you do wicked; then he no good himself, or
no great able. *
W. A. Yes, yes, my dear; he is infinitely good,
and infinitely great, and able to punish too; and
sometimes to shew his justice and vengeance, he
lets fly his anger to destroy sinners, and make
examples; many are cut off in their sins.
Wife. But no makee kill you yet; then he tell
you, may be, that he no makee you kill, so you
make de bargain with him, you do bad ting, he
no be angry at you, when he be angry at other
mans?
W. A. No, indeed, my sins are all presumptions
upon his goodness^ aad h^ would be infinitely
just, if he destroyed' me> as he lias donfc other
men. l
Wife, Well, and yet nokill, no makee you dead!
What you say to him for that? You no tell him
tankee for all that too!
W. A. I am an unthankful, ungrateful dog, that
is true.
Wife. Why he no makee you much good better?
You say he makee you.
W. A. He made me as he made all the world ;
it is I have deformed myself, and abused his good-
ness, and have made myself an abominable wretch.
Wife. I wish you makee God know me; I no
makee htm angry; I nfrdo bad wicked ting.
[Here Will Atkins said his heart sunk within him, to hear a
poor, untaught creature, desire to be taught to know God $
and he such a wicked wretch, that he could not say one
word to her about God, but what the reproach of his own
carnage would make most irrational to her to believe; myy
that? already* she could not believe in God, because he that
was so wicked was not destroyed ]r
W. A. My dear, you mean you wish I could
teach you to know God, not God to know you;
for he knows you already, and every thought in
your heart.
Wife. Why then he know what I say to j7ou
now; he know me wish to know him$ how shall
me know who makee1 me?
W. A* Poor creature, he must teach thee, I can-
not teach thee; I'll pray to him to teach thee to
know him; and to forgive me, that I am un-
worthy to teach thee.
[The poor fellow was in suchsai &gony at her desiring him to
make her know $&&? and iier wishing? to know him, that,
he said, he fell down on his knees before hei, and pi ay eel
t . to God to ealightea Jxer mind with the saving knowledge
of Jesus Christ, and to pardon his sins, and accept of his
being the unworthy instrument of instructing her in the
principles of religion; after which he sat down by her
again, and their dialogue went on.]
N. B. This was the time when we saw him kneel down and
lift up his hands.
Wife. What you put down the knee for? What
you hold up the hand for? What you say? Who
you speak to? What is that?
W. A. My dear, I bow my knees in token of
niy submission to him that made me: I said O to
him, as you call it, and as you say your old men
do to their idol Benamuckee; that is, I prayed to
him.
Wife* What you say O to him for?
W. A. I prayed to him to open your eyes and
your understanding, that you may know him, and
be accepted by him.
Wife. Can he do that too?
W. A. Yes, he can; he can do all things.
Wife. But he no he&r what you say ?
W. A. Yes, he has bid us pray to him; and pro-
mised to he$r us.o
Wife. Bid you pray? When he bid you? How
he bid you? What you hear him speak?
W. A. No, we d6 not hear him speak; but he
has revealed himself many ways to us.
[Here he was at a great loss to make her understand that God
had revealed himself to us by his Word; and what his
word was -} but at last he told it her thus:
W. A. God ]d&& ^po&en to^some good men in
former day§„^ve% fro*$, hgaf&Jjt by plain words;
and God has inspired good men, by his Spirit; and
they have written all his laws down in a book.
Wife. Me no understand that; where is book?
W. A. Alas! my poor creature, I have not "this
book; but I hope I shall, one time or other, get
it for you to read it.
[Here he embraced her with great affection; but with in-
expressible grief, that he had not a bible]
Wife. But how you makee me know, that God
teachee them to write that book?
W. A. By the same rule that we know him to
be God.
Wife. What rule; what way you know?
W. A. Because he teaches and commands no-
thing but what is good, righteous, aijd holy; and
tends to make us perfectly good, as well as per-
fectly happy; and because he forbids, and com-
mands us to avoid all that is wicked, that is evil
in itself, or evil in its consequences.
Wife. That me would understand,, that me fain
see;1 if he reward all good thing, punish all wicked
thing, he teachee all good thing, forbid all wicked
thing, he makee all thing, he give all thing; he
hear me when I say O to him, as you go to do
just now; he makee me good, if I wish be good;
he spaie me, no makee kill me, when I no be good;
aJKthis you say he do; yes, he be great God; me
takes think, believe,, him be great God; me say O
to him too, with you, my dear*
Here the poor man said he could forbear no
longer; but raising her up, made hfer kneel by him;
and he praytdte Gtfd-albud, to nfttriict htr m the
VOL. II. 2 B
knowledge of himself, by bis Spirit; and that by
some good providence, if possible, she might some
time or other come to have a bible, that she might
read the word of God, and sbe taught by him to
know him.
[This was the time that we saw him lift her up by the hand,
and saw him kneel down by her as above.]
They had several other discourses, it seems, after
this, too long to set down here; and particularly
she made him promise, that since he confessed his
own life had been a wicked, abominable course of
provocation against God, that he would reform it,
and not make God angry any more, lest he should
make him dead, as she called it, and then she
should be left alone, and never be taught to know
this God better; and lest he should be miserable,
as he had told her wicked men should be after
death.
This was a strange account, and very affecting
to us both, but particularly the young clergyman:
he was indeed wonderfully surprised with it; but
under the greatest affliction imaginable, that he
could not talk to her; that he could not speak
English to make her understand him; and as she
spoke but very broken English, he could not un-
derstand her. However, he turned himself to me,
and told me, that he'believed there must be more
to do with this woman than to marry her; I did
not understand him at first; but 'at length he ex-
plained himself; viz. That she ought to be bap-
tized.
I agreed with him in that part readily, and was
forgoing about it presently. No, no: hold, Sir,
said he, though I would have her baptized by all
means, yet I must observe, that Will Atkins, her
husband, has indeed brought her, in a wonderful
manner, to be willing to embrace a religious life;
and has given her just ideas of the being of a God,
of his power, justice, and mercy; yet I desire to
know of him, if he has said any thing to her of
Jesus Christ, and of the salvation of sinners; of
the nature of faith in him; and the redemption by
him; of the holy Spirit, the resurrection, Che last
judgment, and a future state.
I called Will Atkins again; and asked him; but
the poor fellow fell immediately into tears, and told
us, he had said something to her of all those things,
but that he was himself so wicked a creature, and
Ills own conscience so reproached him with his
horrid ungodly life, that he trembled at the appre-
hensions, that her knowledge of him should lessen
the attention she should give to those things, and
make her rather contemn religion, than receive it:
but he was assured* he said, that her mind was so
disposed to receive due impressions of all those
things, that if I would discourse with her, she
would make it appear to my satisfaction, that my
labour would not be lost upon her-
Accordingly I cajled her in, and placing myself
as interpreter, between my religious priest and the
woman, I entreated him to begin with her: but
sure such a sermon was never preached by a popish
priest in these latter ages of the world; and,
as J told himfc I thought he had all the zeal,
all the knowledge, all the sincerity of the Chris-
2 b 2
tian, without the errors of a Roman Catholic; and
that I took him to be such a clergyman as the Ro-
man bishops were, before the church of Rome as-
sumed spiritual sovereignty over the consciences
of mem
In a word, he brought the poor woman to em-
biace the knowledge of Christ, and of redemption
by him, not with wonder and astonishment only, as
she did the first notions of a God, but with joy
and faith, with an affection, and a surprising de-
gree of understanding, scarce to be imagined, much
less to be expressed; and at her own request she
was baptized.
When he was preparing to baptize her, I en-
treated him, that he would perform that office with
some caution, that the man might not perceive he
was of the Roman church, if possible; because of
other ill consequences which might attend a differ-
ence among us in that very religion which we
were instructing the other in. He told me that as
he had no consecrated chapel, nor proper things
for the office, I should see he would do it in a man-
ner that I should not know by it that he was a Ro-
man Catholic myself* if I had. not known it be-
fore: and so he did; for saying only some words
cover to himself in Latin, which J could not under-
stand, he poured a whole dish full of water upon
the woman's head, pronouncing in French very
loud, Mary; which was the name her husband de-
shed me to give her, for I was hex god-father, I
Wptize thee in the name of the Father, and of the
Son, and Qf.thf^oly Ghost;i*so thatj npae could
know any thing by it, what n&Ligion he was of UiQ
gave the benediction afterwards in Latin; but ei-
ther Will Atkins did not know but it was in French,
or else did not take notice of it that time.
As soon as this was over, he married them; and
after the marriage was over, he turned himself to
Will Atkins, and in a very affectionate manner ex-
horted him not only to persevere in that good dis-
position he was in, but to support the convictions
that were upon him, by a resolution to reform his
life: told him, it was in vain to say he repented,
if he did not forsake his crimes; represented to
him, how God had honoured him with being the
instrument of bringing his wife to the knowledge
of the Christian religion; and that he should be
careful he did not dishonour the grace of God; and
that, if he did, he would see the heathen a better
Christian than himself; the savage converted,
and the instrument cast away.
He said a great many good tilings to them both,
and then recommended them, in a few words, to
God's goodness; gave them* the benediction again,
I repeating every thing to them in English. And
thus ended ithe ceremony*, I think it was the most
pleasant, agreeable day to me, that ever I passed
in my whole life. ,»
But my clergyman had not done yet; his
thoughts hung continually tpon the conversion of
the thirty+seven.savages; and fain he would have
&taid upon'the island to have undertaken it: but I
convinced him, First, that his undertaking was
impracticable im a^self? and 'secondly, that, per-
haps, I could, put it into a way of being done, in
hisabsence, to bis, satisfaction; pf which by and by.
Having thus brought the affair of the island to a
narrow compass, I was preparing to go on board
the ship, when the young man, whom I had taken
out of the famished ship's company, came to me,
and told me, he understood I had a clergyman with
me, and that I had caused the Englishmen to be
married to the savages, whom they called wives;
that he had a match too, which he desired might;
be finished before I went, between two Christians;
which he hoped would not be disagreeable to me.
I knew this must be the young woman who was
his mother's servant, for there was no other Chris-
tian woman on the island; so I began to persuade
him not to do any thing of that kind rashly, or be-
cause he found himself im this solitary circum-
stance. I represented, that he had some consi-
derable substance in tli£ world and good friends,
as I understood by him^eli^ and by his maid also;
that the maid was- not only poor, and a servant,
but was unequal to him, she being twenty-six or
twenty-seven years old, and he not above seven-
teen or eighteen; thakhe might very-pr-obably, with
my assistance, make aremoveirpm this wilderness,
and come into his ^wn, country ^again; and that
then it would be a thousand to one but he would
repent his choice; and the dislike of-that circum-
stance might be disadvantageous to both. I was
going to say more^but he interrupted me, smiling;
and told me, with a great deal of modesty, that J
nustook in my guesses; that he had nothing of
that kind in his thoughts, his .present eiFQirm*
stances being melancholy and discpn$o}a$e-enough;
a$d he was very glad- tq> hear, tfyat \ ^ad,£©na£
thoughts of putting them in a way to see their
own country again; and that nothing should have
set him upon staying there, but that the voyage I
was going was so exceeding long and hazardous,
and would carry him quite out of the reach of all
his friends; that he had nothing to desire of me,
but that I would settle him in some little property
in the island where he was; give him a servant or
two, and some few necessaries, and he would settle
himself here like a planter, Waiting the gdod time
when, if ever I returned to England, I would re-
deem him, and hoped I would not be unmindful of
him when I came to England; that he would give
me some fetters to his friends in London, to let
them know how good I had been to him, ahd what
part of the worid, and what circumstances I had
ldfthim in; and he promised me, that whenever I
redeemed him, the plantation, and all the improve-
ments he had made upon it, let the value be what
it would, should be* wholly mine.
His discourse Was very prettily delivered, consi-
dering his youth; arid-was the more agreeable to
me, because he ttfld me positively the match was
not for himself. I gbrerhhn all possible assurances,
that if I livfed to cotne safe to England, I would
deliver his letters, fcnd do hi^business effectually;
ami that he might depend* !f would never forget
the circumstances I left him hi; but still I was im-
patient to ktitfw MtfKrwas thfe person to be mar-
ried, tfptin which *he^told me it Was my Jack of
all Trades; lanti his maid Slds&n.
I-Was most agreeably1 $ui*prisfcd ^hen he named
the maWh; for indeed11 had thought it-^ery suita-
ble. The character of that man I have given al-
ready; and as for the maid, she was a very honest,
itiodest, sober, and religious young woman; had a
vefy good share of sense; was agieeable enough
in her person; spoke very handsomely, and to the
purpose; always with decency and good manners,
and not backward to speak when any thing re-
quired it, or impertinently forward to speak when
it was not her business; very handy and house-
wifely in any thing th&t was before her; an excel-
lent manager, and fit indeed to have been gover-
ness to the whole island; she knew very well how
to behave herself to all kind of folks she had about
her, and to better, if she had found any there.
The match being proposed in this manner, we
married them the same day; and, as I was father
at the altar, as I may say, and gave her away, so I
gave her a portibn; for I appointed her and her
husband a handsome large space of ground for
their plantation; and, indfe'ed, this match, and the
proposal the young gentleman made to me, to give
him a small property in the island, put me upon
parcelling it out among them, that they might not
quarrel afterwards about their situation.
This sharing out the land to them I left to Will
Atkins, who, indeed, was no\# grown a most sober/
gt%ve, managing fellow; perfectly reformed, ex-
ceeding pious and religious," and, as far as I may
be allowed to speak positively ih such a case, I ve-
rily believe, was 3, true'siric<Jre'penitent.
He divided things so justlyy arid" so much' to
every one's satisfaction/ that they only desiYed
one general writing under my hand for the whole;
which I caused to be drawn up, and signed and
sealed to them, setting out the bounds and situation
of every man's plantation, and testifying, that I
gave them thereby, severally, a right to the whole
possession and inheritance of the respective planta-
tions or farms, with their improvements, to them
and their heirs; reserving all the rest of the island
as my own property, and a certain lent for every
particular plantation, after eleven years, if I, or
any one from me, or in my name, came to demand
it, producing an attested copy of the same writing.
As to the government and laws among them, I
told them, I was not capable of giving them bet-
ter rules than they were able to give themselves;
only made them promise me, to live in love and
good neighbourhood with one another: and so I
prepared to leave them.
One' thing I must not omit; and that is, that
being now settled in a kind of commonwealth
among themselves, and having much business in
hand, it was but odd to have seven-and-thirty
Indians live in a nook of the island, independent,
and, indeed^ unemployed; for, excepting the pro-
viding themselves food, which they had difficulty
enough in doing sometimes, they had no manner
of business t or property to manage: I proposed
therefore to the governor Spaniard, that he should
go to them with Friday's father, and propose to
them to remove, and either plant for themselves,
or take them into their several families as servants,
to be maintained for. their labour, but without
being absolute slaves; for I woul^ uot admit them
to ipake tj^pi slaves by force, by any means, be-
VOL. II. 2 c
cause they had their liberty given by capitulation,
and, as it were, articles of surrender, which they
ought not to break.
They most willingly embraced the proposal, and
came all very cheerfully along with him; so we
allotted them land and plantations, which three or
four accepted of, but all the rest chose to be enfr-
plbyed as servants in the several families we had
settled; and thus my colony was in a manner set-
tled, as follows : the Spaniards possessed1 my origi-
nal habitation, which was the capital city, and ex-
tended their plantation all along the side of the
brook, which made the 'creek that Is have so often
described, as far as my bower J and as they iherek&d
their culture, it went klways'eastward;' the English
lived in the north-east part, where 'Will Atkins
and his comrades began, and came bri southward
and1 south-west, towards the back part of the Spa-
niards ; and every plantation had a great addition
of land id take in, if they fouftd1 occasion j so that
they need not jostle one another for want of room.
All the West end'of the island was left Uninha-
bited, that if anylofrtlfe savages shbuld come 6n
shore there, only fo^ their usual ct&tdmary barba-
rities, they mi^ht domeiand go; if they disturbed
tiobody, nobody "would disturb* them; and no
doubt but they were oftetf Ashore, &nd went aWay
again;1 for T never heard rthd£ the planters were
ever atifadked&nd$iiitirbe& animate. *
It nOwcam&inttJiriy ttoiigHts,1 that* I hadhihted
to my frieiixi tfce'cfe^Mn,' tha$ the°Wk of con-
verting the fttt^toalgU^ ^feAapfc;%^«Jto'ttot
in his absence, to hfisSatisfaction; and I told him,
OF -JiOBIKSOJS:" CKCJSOf,. IQS
that now I thought it was put in a fair way ; for
the savages being thus divided among the Chris-
tians, if they would but every one of them do their
part with those which came under their hands, I
hoped it might have a very good effect.
He agreed presently in that: If, said he, they
will do their part; but how, says he, shall we ob-
tain that of them? I told him, we would call them
all together, and leave it in charge with them, or
go to them one by one, which he thought best;
so we divided it; he to speak to the Spaniards,
who were all Papists; and I to the English, who
were all Protestants; and wre recommended it
earnestly to them, and made them promise, that
they would never make any distinction of Papist
or Protestant, in their exhorting the savages to
turn Christians; but teach them the general know-
ledge of the true God, and of their Saviour Jesus
Christ; and they likewise promised us, that they
would never have any differences or disputes, one
with another, about religion.
When I came to Will Atkins's house (I may call
it so; for such a house, or such a piece of basket-
work, I believe was not standing in the world
again!) I say, when I came thither, I found the
young woman I have mentioned above, and Wil-
liam Atkins's wife, were become intimates; and
this, prudent, religious young woman, had per-
fected the work Will Atkins had begun; and
though it was not above four days after what I
have related, yet the new-baptized savage woman
was made such a Christian, as I have seldom heard
; -2 c 2
of any like her, in all my observation or conver-
sation in the world.
It came next into my mind, in the morning, be-
fore I went to them, that among all the needful
things I had to leave with them, I had not left a
bible; in which I shewed myself less considering
for them, than my good friend the widow was for
me, when she sent me the cargo of c£lOO frojp
Lisbon, where she packed up three bibles and a
prayer-book. However, the good woman's charity
bad a greater extent than ever she imagined; for
they were reserved for the CQmfort and instruction
of those that made much better use of them than
I had done.
I took one of the bibles in my pocket, and wheji
I came to William Atkins's tent, or house, I found
the young woman, and Atkins's baptized wife, had
been discoursing of religion together; (for William
Atkins told it me, with a great deal of joy), I
asked if they were together* now? And he said
yes; so I went into the house, and he with me, and
we found them together^ very eajne^t in discourse.
O, Sir, says William Atkins, wh^n God has sinners
to reconcile to himself, and aliens t$ bring home,
he never wants a messenger. My wife has got a
new instructor; I knew I was unworthy, as I w^s
incapable of that work ;Mthat jQung woman has
been sent hither fnom Jfteaven; ,she is enough to
convert n whole isJapyd >of, savages. The young
woman blushed, and^jipseiAp to g# away, but I de-
sired her to At fetilJj? MaW ber,f$he i»4>a good
*work upon> ter ^ai^s,oian.d $, hoped CJpd ^ouW
bless her in 4t*
We talked a little; and I did not perceive they
had any book among them, though I did not ask;
but I put my hand in my pocket, and pulled out
my bible- Here, said I to Atkins, I have brought
you an assistant, that, perhaps, you had not before.
The man was so confounded, that he was not able
t4 speak for some time; but recovering himself, he
tdkes it with both hands, and, turning to his wife,
Here, my dear, says he, did not I tell you, our
God, though he lives above, could hear what we
*said?4 Here is the book I prayed for, when you and
f kneeled d^wn under the bush; now God has
heard usand sent it; When he bad said thus, the
man fell into such transports of a passionate joy,
that between the joy of havingvit, and giving God
tbatilcs for it, the tears run down his face like a
<3rild that was crying!

ter to suffer any delusion to take place. So^I
ttrned to' the young wtfn&tif tod^told her, we did
tiofc desire to impose \ipoti thcpii6W convert, ialier
fifcsl aftdiridre Jgnoran^urid^r&tlindiilgofitbing^nd
^gged^l^r^^x^a&n tac3be^ that (OfcwLm&y be

in the course of hisr jProyidence, such things are?
in a particular manner, brought to pass, as we pe-
titioned for; but we do not expect return^ Frdm
Heaven, in a miraculous and particular manner;
and that it is our mercy, it is not so.
This the young woman did afterwards effec-
tually; so that there was, I assure you, no priest-
craft used here; and I should have thought it one
of the most unjustifiable frauds in the world,, to
have had it so: but the surprize of joy upon Will
Atkins, is really not to be expressed; and there,
we may be sure, was no delusion. Sure no man
was ever more thankful in the world for anything;
of its land, than he was for this bible; and I be-
lieve, never any man was glad of a bible from a
better principle; and though he had been a most
profligate creature, desperate; lieadstrong, outra-
geous, furidus, and wicked to a great degree; yet
this man is a standing rule to u$ all, for the well
instructing - children; viz., that parents should
never give over to teach, and instruct or ever de*
spair of the success of their endeavours, let the
children be ever so obstinate, refractory, or, to ap-
pearance,, insensible of instruction; for if .ever God
in his Providence touches the consciences of such,
the force of their education retuVns upon them,
and the early instruction of parents is not lost,
though it m^y have been 'many years laid asleep;
but, some >time ov othe^ tney jpi&y find the benefit
of it.
Thus it was with tljis pQOj\man^ However ig-
norant he was, or divested ofurellgltfn and Chris-
tian knowledge, he found he had some to do with
now more ignorant than himself* and that the
least part of the instruction of his good father, that
could now come to his mind, was of use to him.
Among the rest it occurred to him, he said, how
his father used to insist much upon the inexpressi-
ble value of the bible; the privilege and blessing
of it to nations, families, and persons; but he never
entertained the least notion of the worth of it till
now; when, being (to talk to heathens, savages, and
barbarians, he wanted the help of the written ora-
cle for his assistance.
The young woman was very glad of it also, for
tlib present occasion, though she had one; and so
had the youth on board our ship, among the goods
which were not yet brought on shore* And now,
having said so many things of this young woman,
I cannot omit telling one story more of her and
myself which has something in it very informing
and remarkable.
I have related to what extremity the poor
young woman was reduced; how her mistress was
starved to death, and did die, on board that un-
happy ship we met at sea; and how the whole
ship's company being reduced to the last extremity,
the gtentlewoman, and her son, and this, maid,
were first hardly used, as to provisions, and, at last,
totally neglected and starved * that is to say,
brought to the last extremity, of hunger.
One day,, being tiis'eo^rsinjg with her upon the
extremities they suffered, T asked Iher, if she cou]d
describe, by, what she felt, what it was to starve,
aftdhowlt app^red^ S^etolcl me, she fceWved
she could; and she told her tale very distinctly
thus,
]?irst, Sir, said she, we had for some days fared
exceeding hard, and suffered very great hunger;
but now, at last, we were wholly without food of
any kind, except sugar, and a little wine, and a
little water. The first day after I had received no
food at all, I found myself, towards evening, first
empty and sickish at my stomach; and nearer
night, mightily inclined to yawning, and sleepy;
I laid down on a couch in the great cabin to sleep;
and slept about three hours, and awaked a little
refreshed, having taken a glass of wine when I lay
down: after being about three hours awake, it
being about five o'clock in the morning, I found
myself empty, and my stomach sickish again, and
laid down again; but could not sleep at all, being
very faint and ill; and thus I continued ail the
second day, with a strange variety; first hungry,
then sick again, with reachings to vomit: the se-
cond night, being obliged to go to bed again, with-
out any food more than a draught of fair water,
and being asleep, I dreamed 1 was at Barbadoes,
and that the market was mightily stocked with
provisions; that I bought some for my mistress,
and went and dined very heartily.
I thought my stomach was full after this, as it
Arould have been after, or at a good dinner; but
when I waked, I was exceedingly sunk in my
spirits to find myself in the extremity of famine:
the last glass of wine we had, I drank, and put
sugar into it, because of its having some spirit to
supply nourishment; but there being no substance
in the stomach for the digesting office to work
upon, I found the only effect of the wine was, to
raise disagreeable fumes from the stomach into the
head; and I lay, as they told me, stupid and sense-
less, as one drunk, for s6me time.
*The third day in the morning, after a night of
strange and confused inconsistent dreams, and ra-
ther dozing than sleeping, I awaked, ravenous and
furious with hunger; and I question, had not my
understanding returned, and conquered it; I say,
I question whether, if I had been a mother, and
had had a little child with me, its life would have
been safe or no.
This lasted about three hours; during which
time I was twice raging mad, as any creature in
Bedlam, as my young master told me, and as he
can now inform you.
In one of these fits of lunacy, or distraction,
whether by the motion of the ship, or some slip of
fhy foot, I know not, I fell down, and struck my
face against the corner of a pallet-bed, in which
my mistress lay; and with the blow the blood
gushed out of my nose; and the cabin-boy bring-
ing me a little bason, I sat down and bled into
it a great deal; and as the blood raa from me, I
came to myself j and the violence of the flame, or
the fever I was in, abated, and so did the ravenous
partlof the hunger.
Then I grew sick and reached to vomits but
could not; for I had nothing in my*stomach, to
bring*up: after T'had bled some time, I swooned,
and they all believed I was dead; but I cause to
myself soon after, and then had a most dreadful
p&m in my stomach, not to be described; not like
ihe cholic, but a gnawing eager pain for food; and,
towards night, it went off with a kind of earnest
wishing or longing for food; something like, as I
suppose, the longing of a woman with child. I
took' another draught of water, with sugar in it,
but my stomach loathed the sugai4, and brought it
all up again. Then I took a draught of Wateri
Without sugar, and that stayed with n1e; and I l&id
me down upon the bed, praying most heartily, that
it would please God to take me away; and com-
posing my mind in hopes or it, I slumbered awhile';
and then waking, thought my&df dying, being
light with vapours ftom an empty'stomach. I re-
commended my soul to God, and earnestly wished
that somebody would throw me into the sea.
All this while my mistress lay by me, just, &s I
thought, expiring; but bore it With much more
jpatience than I, and gave the last "bit of bread she
had to her child, myyoting^lnaster, who would not
have taken it, 'but she obliged-liira to eat it j and,
I believe, it saved his Hfe.
Towards the mortiing, I slept again; and first,
when I awaked, I jellinto'a vicflent passion of cry-
ing; and after that, liad a sebond fit of violent
hunger, 'so that I got trp ravenous, and in a most
dreadful condition. Had my mistress been dead,
as much as I ldved hfetv I 'am certain I should have
eaten a piece of her flesh with as much relish, dnd
as iriiconcerrie'd, as e^eflcIitTth^ fldsKPof arfy ctea-
tUTe appoijit$d fhrfdbd,* ttmftmce ottwitt T^¥s
son, in which was the blood I had bled at my nose
the day before; I ran to it, and swallowed it with
such haste, and such a greedy appetite, as if I had
wondered nobody had taken it before, and afraid
it should be taken from me now.
Though after it was down the thoughts of it fill-
ed me with horror, yet it checked the fit of hunger;
and>I drank a draught of fair water, and was com-
posed and refreshed for some hours after it. This
was the fourth day; and thus I held it till towards
^ight, when, within the compass of three hours,. I
ha,d all these several circumstances over again, one
after another; viz. sick, sleepy, eagerly hungry,
pain in the stomach, then ravenous again, then
sick again, then lunatic, then crying, then raven-
ous again, and so every quarter of an hour; and my
strength wasted exceedingly. At night I laid me
dotwn» having no cqmfort, but in the hope that I
$honld die before morning.
. s All this #ight I had ua sleep, but the hunger
•was now turned into a disease; and I had a terri-
ble cholic $nd grifipg^ wind, instead of food, hav-
ing found its way into the bowels; and in this
condition I Jay till porning^when I was surprized
A little with the cries and lamentations of my young

petite, that nothing but the tortures of death can
imitate; and this condition I was in, when I heard
the seamen above cry out, A sail! a sail! and halloo
and jump about as if they were distracted.
I was not able to get off from the bed, and my
mistress much less; and my master was so sick,
that I thought he had been expiring; so we could
not open the cabin door, or get any account what
it was that occasioned such a combustion; nor had
we any conversation with the ship's company for
two days, they having told us they had not a
mouthful of any thing to eat in the ship; and they
told us afterwards, they thought we had been
dead.
It was this dreadful condition we were in when
you were sent to save our lives; and how you found
us, Sir, you know as well as I, and better too.
This was her own relation, and is such a distinct
account of starving to death, as, I confess, I never
met with, and was exceeding entertaining to me.
I am the rather apt to believe it to be a true ac-
count, because the youth gave me an account of a
good part of it; though I must own, not so dis-
tinct, and so feelingly as his maid ; and the rather,
because, it seems, his mother fed him at the price
of her own life: but the poor maid, though her
constitution being stronger than,th^t of her mis-
tressj who was in years, and a weakly woman too,
she might struggle harder with it; J say, the poor
maid might be supposed to, feel the extremity
something sooner than her mistress, who might
be allowed to keep tjieylast ^it^jsopiet^ipg longer
than she parted ^ith my to xejieye; th^ majicjL No
question, as the case is here related, if our ship, oj
some other, had not so providentially met them,
a few days more would have ended all their lives,
unless they had prevented it by eating one ano-
ther; and even that, as their case stood, would
have served them but a little while, they being
500 leagues from any land, or any possibility of
relief, other than in the miraculous manner it hap-
pened.—But this by the way; I return to my dis-
position of things among the people.
And first, it is to be observed here, that for
many reasons, I did not think fit to let them know
any thing of the sloop I had framed, and which I
thought of setting up among them; for I found,
at least at my first coming, such seeds of division
among them, that I saw it plainly, had I set up
the sloop, and left it among them, they would,
upon very light disgust, have separated, and gone
away from one another; or perhaps have turned
pirates, and so made the island a den of thieves,
instead of a plantation of sober and religious peo-
ple, as I intended it to be; nor did I leave the two
pieces of brass cannon that I had on board, or the
two quarter deck guns, that my nephew took ex-
traordinary, for the same reason. I thought they
had enough to qualify the ill for k defensive war,
against any that should invade them; but I was
not to set them up for'an offensive'war,' or to en-
courage them to go abroa'd to attack others,1 which,
in the end, would only brirtg rufri a'nd destruction
upon themselves and'aH'thfeir' undertaking! I re-
served the sloop, theVefor^, and thd gutts^fortheir
service another way^sl^haH'otJs^tVe iWitfe1 jtfkce.
I have now done with the island. I left them all
in good circumstances, and in a flourishing condi-
tion, and went on board my ship again the fifth
day of May, having been five-and-twenty days
among them; and as they were all resolved to stay
upon the island till I came to remove them, I pro-
mised to send some further relief from theBrasdls,
if I could possibly find an opportunity; and parti-
cularly I promised to send theni some cattle; such
as sheep, hogs, and cows; for as to the two cows
and calves which I brought from England, we had
been obliged, by the length of but voyage, to kill
them at sea, for want of hay td feed them.
The next day, giving them a salute of five guns
at parting, we set sail, aftd arrived ^t the bay of
All Saints, in the Brasils, rn about twenty-two
days; meeting nothing remarkable in our passage
but this* That about- three days after we sailed,
being beeahned, and the current setting strong to
the NiN.E. runiling, as it were, into a bay or
gulph, on the iand^side, we were driven something
out of our course} and once or twice our men cried
Land, to the westward^; but whether it was thg
continent, or islands, we cduld not tell by aiiy
means.
But the third day, towards evening, the sea
smooth and the weather <Jahny we saw the^sea, a*
it were, covered* towards the tend, with something
very blaek, not being able to discover what it wa&;
buft, after somg time* ©ujp^chief ma*e' going tip the

spoke alittle hastily, calling the fellow a fool, or

aftgry, for it is an army, and a fleet too; for I be-
lieve there are a thousand canoes, and you may
$ee them paddle along, and they are coming to-
wards us too apace, and full of men.
„ I Was a little surprised then, indeed, and so was
my nephew the captain; £ov he* had heard such
terrible stories of thetn An the island, and having
never beea in those seas before, that he could not
tell what to think of itf but said two or three
times, we should all be devoured. I must confess,
considering we were becalmed$<ai*d the current set

were some of my old friends, the same sort of sa-
vages that I had been used to engage with; and in
a little time more they rowed somewhat further
out to sea, till they came directly broadside with
us, and then rowed down straight upon us, till they
came so near that they could hear us speak. Upon
this, I ordered all my men to keep close, lest they
should shoot any more arrows, and make all our
guns ready; but being so near as to be within
hearing, I made Friday go out upon the deck, and
call out aloud to them in his language, to know
what they meant; which accordingly he did: whe-
ther they understood him or not, that I know not;
but, as soon as he had called to them, six of them,
who were in the foremost, or nighest boat to us,
turned their canoes from us; and, stooping down,
shewed us their naked backsides; just as if, in En-
glish, (saving your presence) the)7 had bid us kiss . Whether this was a defiance or chal-
lenge, we knew not; or whether it was done in
mere contempt, or a signal to the rest; but imme-
diately Friday cried out, They were going to
shoot; and unhappily for him (poor fellow) they
let fly about 300 of their arrows; and, to my in-
expressible grief, killed poor Friday, no other man
being in their sight The poor fellow was shot
with no less than three arrows, and about three
more fell very nigh hit\x; such unlucky .marksmen
they were.

them such a broadside as they had never had in
their lives before, to be sure.
They were not above half a cable's length off
when we filed; and our gunners took their aim so
well, that three or four of their canoes were over-
set, as we had reason to believe, by one shot only.
The ill manners of turning up their bare back-
sides to us, gave us no great offence; neither did
I know for certain whether that, which would
pass for the greatest contempt among us, might
be understood so by them or not; therefore in re-
turn I had only resolved to have fired four or five
guns with powder only, which I knew would"
fright them sufficiently: but when they shot at us
directly with all the fury they were capable or, an#
especially as they had killed my poor Friday, whom
I so entiieiy lovefland valued, and who, indeed^ so
well deserved it; I not only had been justified^ be-
fore God ^nd man, but would have been very glad,
if I could, to have overset every canoe there, and
drowned ev^ry one of them.
I can neither tell how maqy we killed, or how
many we wounded, at this Brqadsiae; but sure such
a fright and hurry never was seen among such a
multitude: there vfcere thirteen or fourteen of their
canoes split, and overset, in all; and the men all
set a swimming: the rest, frighted out of their
wits, sdbured aty£y as fast'as they couldy taking

Our small shot from our cannon must needs kill
and wound a great many; but, in short, we never
l^new any thing how it went with them; for they
fled so fast, that, in three hours, or thereabouts,
we could not see above three or four straggling
canoes; nor did we ever see the rest any more;
for a breeze of wind springing up the same even-
ing, we weighed and set sail for the Brasils.
° We had a prisoner indeed, but the creature was
so sullen, that he would neither eat or speak; and
wVall fancied he would starve himself to death;
but 1 took a way to cure him; for I made them
take him, and turn him into the long-boat, and
make hiiji believe they \frould toss him into the
sea again, and so leave him where they found him,
if he would not speak: nor would that do, but
tliey really did throw him into #ie sea, and came
away from him; and then he followed them, for
he 3warn like a cork, and called to them in his
tongue, though they^ knew not one word of what
he said. However, at last, they took him in again,
and then he began to be more tractable; nor did
t ever design they should drown him.
We were now uncler sail again; but I was the
most disconsolate Creature alive, for want of my
max? Friday, and would have been very glad to
have gone back to the island^ to have taken'one
of tne rest from thenqe for my occasion, but it
6oiild not be; $o we Went on. "We had qne pri-

we inquired what country he came from, but could
make nothing of what he said; for his speech was
so odd, all gutturals, and spoken in the throat, in
such an hollow and odd manner, that we could
never form a word from him; and we were all of
opinion that they might speak that language as
well, if they were gagged, as otherwise; nor could
we perceive that they had any occasion either for
teeth, tongue, lips or palate; but formed their
words just as a hunting-horn forms a tune, with
an open throat: he told us, however, some time
after, when we had taught him to speak a little
English, that they were going, with their kings,
to fight a great battle. When he said kings, we
asked him, how many kings? He said there were
five nation, (we could not make him understand
the plural s,) and that they all joined to go against
two nation. We asked him, What made them
come up to us? He said, To makee te great wonder
look—Where it is to be observed, that all those
natives, as also those of Africa, when they learn
English, they always add two e's at the end of the
words where we use one, aud place the accent
upon the last of them; as makee, takee, and the
like; and we could not break them of it; nay, I
could hardly .make Friday leave it off, though at
last he did.
. J And now I name the poor fellow once more, 1
i^ust take my last leave of him,; poor honest Fri-
day! We buried him with all decency and so-
lemnity pQssible^y, pitting, jb^inpijnto,a coffin, and
l throwing him j^tp,thp js^f; aja$ J caused them to
the most grateful, faithful, honest, and most affec-
tionate servant that ever man had.
We now went away with a fair wind forBrasiL
and, in about twelve days time, we made land ia
the latitude of five degrees south of the line, being
the north-eastermost land of all that part of Ame-
rica. We kept on S. by E. in sight of the shore
four days, when we made the Cape St. Augustine,
and in three days came to an anchor off the bay of
All Saints, the old place of my deliverance, from
whence came both my good and evil fate.
Never did a ship come to this part that had less
business than I had; and yet it was with great
difficulty that we were admitted to hold the least
correspondence on shore. Not my partner himself,
who was alive, and made a great figure among
them, not my two merchant trustees, nor the fame
of my wonderful preservation in the island, could
obtain me that favour: but my partner, remem-
bering that I had given five hundred moidores to
the prior of the monastery of the Augustines, and
three hundred and seventy-two to the poor, went
to the monastery, and obliged the prior that then
was, to go to the governor, and beg leave for me
presently, with the captain, and one more, besides
eight seamen, to come on shore, and no more;
and this upon condition absolutely capitulated for,
that we should not offer to land any goods out of
the ship, or to carry any person away without
icence.
They were so strict with us, as to landing any
godds, that it was with extreme difficulty that I
g6t bn Shore three bales of English'goods, such as
214 urn and a^yeotures
fine broad cloths, stuffs, aijd soms larenj which I
had brought for a present to ipy partner.
ife was a very generous, broad-hearted man,
thougjh (like me) he came from little at first; and
though he knew not that I had the least design of
giving him any thing, he sqnt me on board a pre-
sent of fresh provisions, wine, and sweetmeats,
worth above thirty moidore^ including some to-,
bacco, and three or four fin§ m^d^U in gold. But
I was even with him in myfpresent, which, as l
have said, consisted of fin^e biro^d cloth, English
stuffs, lage, and fine HpU«4& vAlaa, I delivered
him abput the value pf lOPt sterling; in the same*
goqds> for other usq^; and I ob%ed him to set top
the sipqp which, I had brought with me from En->

ord^r to send tlje refreshments. I intended to my

Accordingly hs got bands, *nd finished the stoofi

sired; and, as an addition, I gave him the savage
which we had taken prisoner of war, to be his
slave, and ordered the governor Spaniard to give
him his share of every thing he wanted, with the
rest
When we came to fit this man out, my old part-
ner told me, there was a certain very honest fellow,
a Brasil planter of his acquaintance, who had fallen
into the displeasure of the church: I know not
what the matter is with him, says he, but, on my
conscience, I think he is an heretic in his heart;
and he has been obliged to conceal himself for fear
of the inquisition; that he would be very glad of
such an opportunity to make his escape, with his
wife and two daughters; and if I would let them
go to the island, and allot them a plantation, he
would give them a small stock to begin with; for
the officers of the inquisition had seized all his
effects and estate, and he had nothing left but a
little household stuff, and two slaves; and, adds he,
though I hate his principles, yet I would not have
him fall into their hands, for he will assuredly be
burnt alive if he does.
I granted this presently, and joined my English-
man with them: and we concealed the man, and
his wife and daughters, on board our ship, till the
sloop put out to go to sea; and then (having put
all their goods on board the sloop some time be-
fore) we put them on board the sloop, after she
was s>'ot out of the bav.
Our seaman was mightily pleased with this new
partner; and their stock, indeed, \vas much alike
rich in tools, and ia preparations, fot a farm; but
nothing to begin with, but as above. However,
they carried over with them (which was worth all
the rest) some materials for planting sugar canes,
with some plants of canes; which he (I mean the
Portugal man) understood very well,
Atnong the rest of the supplies sent my tenants
in the island, I sent them, by this sloop, three
milch cows and five calves, about twenty-two
hogs among them, three sows big with pig, two
mares, and a stone-horse.
For my Spaniards, according to my promise^ I
engaged three Portugal women to go; &nd recom-
mended it to them to marry them, an*d use thefri
kindly. I could have procured mo^e women, b&t
I remembered that the poor persecuted man hid
two daughters, and there 1vere but five of the
Spaniards that wanted; the rest had wives of tfieii;
own, though in another country.
All this cargo arrived safe, and as you may easily-
suppose, very welcome tatny old inhabitants; whfd
were now (with this additiotf^ between 'sixty &nd
seventy people, besides Kttle t&ildmi; of vWbich
there were a great matly: 1 fouftd letters at Loii-
doti from them all, b^ Vd^ of" Lisbon, w&en I
came back to England1, being rfetft back to the
Brasils by this sloop; of which I shall take some
notice in its place.

to beware of the like; not cooled by almost forty
years misery and disappointments; not satisfied
with prosperity be}7ond expectation; not made
cautious by affliction and distress beyond imitation,
I had no more business to go to the East Indies,
than a man at full liberty, and having committed
no crime, has to go to the turnkey at Newgate,
and desire him to lock him up among the prisoners
there, and starve him. Had I taken a small vessel
from England, and went directly to the island;
had I loaded her, as I did the other vessel, with
all the necessaries for the plantation, and for my
people; took a patent from the government here,
to ,have secured my property, in subjection only
to that of England, which, to be sure, I might
have obtained; had I carried over cannon and ana-
munition, servants, and people to plant, and, tak-
ing possession of the place, fortified and strength-
ened it in the name of England, and increased it
with people, as I might easily have clone; had I
then settled myself there, and sent the ship back,
loaded with good rice, as I might also have done
in six months time, and ordered my friends to
have fitted her out again for our supply; had I
done this, and stayed there nryself, I had, at least,
acted like a man of common sense; but I was pos-
sessed with a wandering spirit, scorned all advan-
tages, pleased myself with being the patron of
these people I had placed there, and doing for -
thqm in a kind of hafigjity, majestic way, like an
old patriarchal moijavcli;.providing for them, as
if I had been father of the whole family, as well
as of the plantation: but I never so much as pre-
VOL, II. 1 F
tended to plant in the name of any government
or nation, or to acknowledge any prince, or to call
my people subjects to any one nation more than
another; nay, I never so much as gave the place
a name; but left it as I found it, belonging to no
man; and the people under no discipline or go-
vernment but my own; who, though I had an in-
fluence over them as father and benefactor, had
no authority or power to act or command one way
or other, further than voluntary consent moved
them to comply: yet even this, had I staid there,
would have done well enough; but as I rambled
from them, and came thither no more, the last
letters I had from any of them, were by my part-
ner's means, who afterwards sent another sloop to
the place; and who sent me word, though I had
not the letter till five years after it was written,
that they went on but poorly, were malecontent
with their long stay there; that Will Atkins was
dead; that five of the Spaniards were come away;
and that though they had not been much molested
by the savages, yet they had had some skirmishes
with them; that they begged of him to write to
me, to think of the promise I had made to fetch
them away, that they might see their own country
again before they died.
But I was gone a wild-goose chase indeed; and
they .who will have any more of me, must be con-
tent to follow me through a new variety of follies,
hardships, and wild adventures; wherein the justice
of Providence may be duly observed, and we may
see how easily Heaven can gorge us with our own
desires, make the strongest of our wishes to be
our affliction, and punish us most severely with
those very things which we think it would be our
utmost happiness to be allowed in.
Let no wise man flatter himself with the strength
of his own judgment, as if he was able to chuse
any particular station of life for himself. Man is
a short-sighted creature, sees but a very little way
before him; and as his passions are none of his best
friends, so his particular affections are generally his
worst counsellors.
I say this with respect to the impetuous desire I
had from a youth, to wander into the world; and
how evident it now was, that this principle was
preserved in me for my punishment. How it came
on, the manner, the circumstance, and the conclu-
sion of it, it is easy to give you historically, and
with its utmost variety of particulars. But the
secret ends of Divine Providence, in thus permit-
ting us to be hurried down the stream of our own
desires, are only to be understood of those who
can listen to the voice of Providence, and draw
religious consequences from God's justice, and
their own mistakes.
Be it, had I business, or no business, away I
went; it is no time now to enlarge any further
upon the reason or absurdity of my own conduct;
but to come to the history; I was embarked for
the voyage, and the voyage I went.
I shall only add here, that my honest and truly
pious clergyman left meiiere; a ship being read|y
to go to Lisbon, he asked me leave to go thither;
being still, as he observed, bound never to finish
2 f 2
any voyage he began. How happy had it been
for me, if I had gone with him.
But it was too late now; all things Heaven ap-
points are best; had I gone with him, 1 had never
had so many things to be thankful for, and yon
had never heard of the second part of the Travis
and Adventures of Robinson Crusoe; so I qmst
leave here the fruitless exclaiming at myself, ajfji
go oji with my voyage.
From the Brasils we made directly away over the
Atlantic sea, to the Cape de Bonne Esperance, or,
ajs we call it, the Cape of Good Hope; and ha$ba
tolerable good voyage, our course generally sp(utfy-
east; now and then a storm, and some contjpfy
winds. But my disasters at sea were at an $w};
my future rubs and cross events were to befat me
on shore; that it might appear, the land was p»
well prepared to be our scourge,as the sea, wji^n
Heaven, who directs the circumstances of things,
pleases to appoint it to be so,.
Our ship was on a trading voyage, ?#d had a su-
percargo on board, wb9;was ^direct all her mo-
tions, after she arrived jat tjfte Cape; only being li-
initted to a certain number of days for stay, by
fcharter-p^rty, &t th?e sqveralt ports she was to go
to: this was none ojfcjroy business, neither did I

of our way/ojr,.tbft«>>st. of Gmvmmdel^ws we
indeed informed that a French man of war of fifty
guns, and two large merchant ships, were gone for
the Indies; and, as I knew we were at war with
France, I had some apprehensions of them; but
they went their own way, and we heard no more
of them.
I shall not pester my account or the reader, with
descriptions of places, journals of our voyages, va-
riations of the compass, latitudes, meridian dis-
tances, trade wind, situation of ports, and the like;
such as almost all the histories of long navigation
are full of, and which make the reading tiresome
enough; and are perfectly unprofitable to all that
read, except only to those who are to go to those
places themselves.
It is enough to name the ports and places which
we touched at; and what occurred to us upon our
passing from one to another. We touched first at
the island of Madagascar, where, though the peo-
ple are fierce and treacherous, and, in particular,
very well armed with lances and bows, which they
use with inconceivable dexterity, yet we fared very
well with them awhile; they treated us very ci-
villy; and for some trifles which we gave them,
such as knives, scissars, &c. they brought us eleven
good fat bullocks, middling in size, but very good
in flesh; which we took in, partly for fresh provi-
sions for our present spending, and the rest to salt
for the ship's use. ^ ' '
We were obliged to stay here for some time,
after we had furnished ourselves with provisions;
and I, that was always'too^ curious 'to l6oli info
every nook of the world wherever I came? was for
going on shore as often as I could*. It wds on the
east side of the island that we went oil shore one
evening; and the people, who, by the way, ate
very numerous, came thronging about us, arid
stood gazing at us at a distance; as we had traded
freely with them, and had been kindly used, wfe
thought ourselves ifi no danger: but when wfc safor
the people, we cut three boughs out of a tree, aftia
stuck them at a distance from us, wl\ich, it se^mS,
is a mark in the country, not only of tructe knd
friendship, but when it is accepted, the other sidd
set up three poles, or fr6u£h$ also; Which is a sig-
nal that they accept the fruce tbo;1 but then'thfs

roots, and several things very acceptable to us, and
all was quiet; and we made us a little tent, or hut,
of some boughs of trees, and lay on shore all that
night.
I know not what was the occasion, but I was
not so well satisfied to lie on shore as the rest; and
the boat lying at an anchor about a stone's cast
from the land, with two men in her to take care
of her, I made one of them come on shore; and
getting some boughs of trees to cover us also in
the boat, I spread the sail on the bottom of the
boat, and lay on board, under the cover of the
branches of the trees, all might.
About two o'clock in the morning we heard one
of our men make a terrible noise on the shore, call-
ing out for God's sake to bring the boat in, and
come and help them, for they were all like to be mur-
dered; at the same time I heard the firing of five
musquets, which was the number of the guns they
had, and that three times over: for, it seems, the
natives here were not so easily frighted with guns
as the savages were in America, where I had to do
with them.
All this while I knew not what was the matter;
but rousing immediately from sleep with the noise,
I caused the boat to be thrust in, and resolved,
with three fusils we had on board, to l#nd and
assist our men.
We got the boat soon to the shore; but our men
were in too much haste; for, being come to the
shore, they plunged into the water, to get to the
boat with all the expedition they could, being pur-
sued by between three and four < hundred miem
Our men were but nine in all, and only five of
them had fusils with them; the rest, indeed, had
pistols and swords, but they were of small use to
them.
We took up seven of our men, and with diffi-
culty enough too, three of them being very ill
wounded; and that which was still worse, was,
that while wc stood in the boat to take our men
in, we were in as much danger as they were in on
shore; for they poured their arrows in upon us so
thick, that we were fain to barricade the side of
the boat up with the benches, and two or three
loose boards, which, to our great satisfaction, we
had, by mere accident, or providence rather, in the
boat.
And yet, had it been day-light, they are, it
seems, such exact marksmen, that if they could
have seen but the least part of any of us, they
would have been sure of us: we had, by the light
of the moon, a little sight of them, as they stood
pelting us from the shore with darts and arrows;
and, having got ready our fire-arms, we gave them
a volley; and we could hear by the cries of some
of them, that we had wounded several; however,
they stood thus in battle array on the shore till
break of day, which we suppose was, that they
might see the better to take their aim at us.
In this condition we lay, and could not tell how
to weigh our anchor, to set up our sail, because we
must needs stand up in the boat, and they were as
sure to hit us, as we were to hit a bird in a tree
with small shot: we made signals of distress to the
ship, which though she rode a league off, yet my
nephew, the captain, hearing our firing, and by
glasses perceiving the posture we lay in, and that
we fired towards the shore, pretty well understood
us; and, weighing anchor with all speed, he stood
as near the shore as he durst with the ship, and
then sent another boat, with ten hands in her, to
assist us; but we called to them not to come too
near, telling them what condition we were in: how-
ever, they stood in nearer to us, and one of the
men, taking the end of a tow-line in his hand, and
keeping our boat between him and the enemy, so
that they soulci not perfectly see him, swam on
board us, and made the line fast to the boat; upon
which we slipt our little cable, and leaving our
anchor behind, they towed us out of the reach of
the arrows; we all the while lying close behind
the barricade we had made.
As soon as we were got from between the ship
and the shore, that she could lay her side to the
shore, we ran along just by them, and we poured
in a broadside among them, loaded with pieces of
iron and lead, small bullets, and such stuff, besides
the great shot, which made a terrible havock among
them.
When we were got on board, and out of danger,
we had time to examine into the occasion of thib
fray; and, indeed, our supercargo, who had been
often in those parts, put me upon it; for he said
he was sure the inhabitants would not have touched
us after we had made a truce, if we had not done
something to provoke them to it. At length it
came out, viz. That an old woman, who had come
to sell us some milk, had brought it within our
VOL. II. 2 G
pales, with a young woman with her, who also
brought some roots or herbs; and while the old
Woman (whether she was mother to the young
Woman or no, they could tiot tell) was selling us
the milk, one of our men offered some rudeness to
the wench that was with her; at which the old
woman made a great noise. However, the seaman
would not quit his prize, but carried her out of the
old woman's sight, among the trees, it being almost
dark; the old woman went away without her; and,
as we suppose, made an outcry among the people
she came from; who, upon notice, raised this
great army upon us in three or four hours; and it
was great odds but we had been all destroyed.
One of our men was killed with a lance that was
thrown at him, just at the beginning of the attack,
as he sallied out of the tent we had made; the rest
came off free, all but the fellow who was the oc-
casion of all the mischief, who paid dear enough
for his black mistress, for we could not hear what
became of him a great while. We lay upon the
shore two days after, though the wind presented,
and made signals for him; made our boat sail up
shore, and down shore, several leagues, but in vain;
so we were obliged to give him over; and if he
alone had suffered for it, the loss, had been the
less.
I could not satisfy myself, however, without
venturing pn shore once more, to try if I could
learn any thing of him or them; it was the third
night after4;he action, that I had a great mind to
learn*, if I could by any m^ans, what mischief we
had done, < md *how>*h« gafme stood cm the* Indian
side. I was careful to do it in the dark, lest we
should be attacked again; but I ought indeed to
have been sure, that the men I went with had been
under my command, before I engaged in a thing
so hazardous and mischievous, as I was brought
into it without any knowledge or desire.
We took twenty stout fellows with us as any in
the $hip, besides the supercargo and myself; and
we landed two hours before midnight, at the same
place where the Indians stood drawn up the even-
ing before. I landed here, because my design, as I
have said, was chiefly to see if they had quitted
the field,, and if they had left any marks behind
then^ or of the mischief we had done them; and I
thought, if we could surprise one or two of them,
perhaps we might get our man again, by way of
sxchangs.
We landed without any noise, and .divided our
men into two companies, whereof the boatswain
commanded pne, and I the other. We neithei
could hear nor see any body stir when we landed;
so we marched up* one body at a distance from
the other, to the field ofijbattle* At first we could
see nothing, it being very daork; but by and by,
our boatswain, that led the first party, stumbled
and fell over a dead bo^y. This made them halt
there awhile; for knowing by the circumstances,
that they were at the place where the Indians had
stood,* they waiteci fojt my coming up. Here we
concluded* to. h$lfe till-the moon .began to rise,

dead. > Some h&dan arm, and some a leg, shot off;
and one his head* Those that were wounded, vfe
supposed *they had carried away.
When we had made, as I thought, a full disco-
very of all we could come at the knowledge of, I
was for going on board again; but the boatswain
and his party often sent me word, that they wetfe
resolved to make a visit to the Indian town, where
these dogs, as they called them, dwelt, and de-
sired me to go along with them; and if they could
find them, as they, still'fancied they should, thtey
did not doubt, they said, getting-a good b6o$y;
ami it might be, they might find Thomas Jefff^s
there: ithat was*the man's, name we had lost. *t

mad thing they were going about, and supposed

frys.
- They told me, like seamen, they would warrant
it they would come off again; and they would
take care, &o ; So away they went I in treated
them to consider the ship, and the voyage; that
their liveswerejvrt their own; and that they were

of them weie aware ofr set*them on-fire with re-

came to the few Indian houses^ which they thought

and if they untied her, they should see which way
she went: if she went bafck, they had nothing to
say to her; but if she went forward? they iiad
fcothing to do but to follow her; so they cut the
cord, which was made of twisted flags, and the
cow went on before them. In a word, the cow led
them directly to,the town, wliich, as they reported,
consisted of above 200 houses, or huts; and in
some of these* they found several families living
together.
i Here they found? atl silent; as profoundly secure,
as sleep and a eotmtry that had never seen an
enemy of tha& kind, soukl make them. Upon this
they called another council, to consider what they
had to do; and, in*a word; trhey resolved to divide
themselves into three bodies;* and to set three
houses on fire in three parte of the town; and as
the men came out8* to siezethem, and bind them:

would venture upon them; but* while they were

that* were-a little before 'the rest, called out aloud,

#r thei* t&teytfdund thfe'ftoo* fellow, hanged \ip
*atoAty%tag'tft^ kndiiis ffooM'cnfc*' There Was
an hidian house just by the tree, where they found
sixteen or seventeen of the principal Indians, who
had been concerned in the fray with us before, and
two or three of them wounded with our shot; and
our men found they were awake, and talking one
to another in that house, but knew not their num-
ber.
The sight of their poor mangled comrade so en-
raged them, as before, that they swore to one ano-
ther they would be revenged, and that not an In-
dian who came into their hands should have
quarter; and to work they went immediately; and
yet not so madly as by the rage and fury they were
in might be expected. Their first care was to get
something that would soon take fire; but after a
little search, they found that would be to no pur-
pose, for most of the houses were low, and thatched
with flags or rushes, of which the country is full;
so they presently made some wild fire, as we call it,
by wetting a little powder in the palms of their
hands; and in a quarter of an hour they set the
town on fire in four or five places; and particularly
that house where the Indians were not gone to bed.
As soon as the fire began to blaze, the poor frighted
creatures began to rush out to save their lives; but
met with their fate in the attempt, and especially
at the door, where they drove them back, the boat-
swain himself killing one or two with his pole-axe;
the house being large, and many in it, he did not
care to go in, but called for an hand-grenado, and
threw it among ,them, which, at first, frighted
them; but when it- burst, made such havock
among them, that they cried out in an hideous
manner.
In $hort, most of the Indians who were in the
open part of the house, were killed or hurt with
thegrenado, except two or three more, who pressed
to the door, which the boatswain and two mare
kept with the bayonets in the muzzles of their
pieces, and dispatched all who came that way.
But there was another apartment in the house,
where the prince, or king, or whatsoever he was,
and several'others, were; and they kept in, till
the house, which.was by this time ail of a light
flame, fell in upon them, and they were smothered,
or Kurnt together.
-All this vs^hile they fired not a gun, because they
would not awaken the people faster than they could
master th^jqa; but the fire began to awaken them
fast enough, and our fellows were glad to keep a
little together in bodies; for the fire grew so rag-
ing, all the* houses being made of light fcom-
bi^stible stuffy that they could hardly bear the
street between them; and thejr business was to
follow, the &e foj^the, surer execution. As fast as
th^fire either forced the people out of those houses
whteh were i burning* or frighted them out of
others, our people were ready at their doors to
knock them on'theAeasl* stiilcalling and hatlooing
to one another to remembet Thomas Jeffrys.
While this was doing, I must confess I was very
uneapyv and especially, when J .saw the flames of

was in; especially hearing the guns too; for by this
time they began to use their fire-arms. A thousand
thoughts oppressed his mind concerning me and
the supercargo, what should become of us; and at
last, though he could ill spare any more men, yet,
not knowing what exigence we might be in, he
takes another boat, and with thirteen men and him*
self comes on shore to me.
He was surprised to see me and the supercargo
in the boat, with no more than two men, for one
had been left to< keep the boat; and though he was
glad that we were well; yet he was in the same
impatience with us to know what was doing; for
the noise continued, and the flame increased. I
confess it was next to an impossibility for any men
in the world to restrain their cusiosity of knowing
what had happened, or their concern for the safety
of the men. In a word, the captain told me, he
would go and help his men, let what would come.
I argued with him, as I did before with the men,
the safety of the ship, and the danger of the
voyage, the interest of the owners and merchants,
&c. and told him I would go, and the two men,
and only see if we could, at a distance, learn what
was like to be the event, and come back and tell
him.
It was all one to talk to my nephew, as it was to
talk to the rest before; he would go, he said, and
he only wished he had left but ten men in the
ship; for he could not think of having his men
lost for want of help: he had rather, he said, lose
the ship, the voyage; and his life and all. And so
away went he.
Nor was I any more able to stay behind now,
than I was to persuade them not to go before; so,
in short, the captain ordered two men to row back
the pinnace, and fetch twelve men more from
the ship, leaving the long-boat at an anchor; and
that when they came back, six men should keep
the two boats, and six more to come after us; so
that he left only sixteen men in the ship; for the
whole ship's company consisted of sixty-five men,
whereof two were lost in the first quarrel which
brought this mischief on.
Being now on the march, you may be sure we
felt little of the ground we trod on; and being
guided by the fire, we kept no path, but went di-
rectly to the place of the flatpe. If the noise of
the guns were surprising to us before, the cries of
the poor people were now quite of another nature,
and filled us with horror, I must confess I never
was at the sacking of a city, or at the taking of a
town by storm. I have heard of Oliver Cromwell
taking Drogheda, in Ireland, and killing man,
woman, and child; and I had read of Count Tilly
sacking the city of Magdebourg, and cutting the
throats of 22000 of both sexes; but I never had
an idea of the thing itself before; nor is it possible
to describe it, or the horror which was upon our
minds at hearing it.
However we went on, and, at length, came to
the town, though there was no entering the streets
of it for the fire. The first object we met with
was the ruins of a hut or house, or rather the ashes
of it, for the house was consumed; and just before
it, plain now to be seen by the light of the fire, lay
2 h 2
four men and three women killed; and, as we
thought, one or two more lay in the heap among
the fire. In short, these were such instances of a
rage altogether barbarous, and of a fury something
beyond what was human, that we thought it im-
possible our men could be guilty of it; or, if they
were the authors of it, we thought that every one
of them ought to be put to the worst of deaths.
But this was not all; we saw the fire increased for-
ward, and the cry went on, just as the fire went
on, so that we were in the utmost confusion. We
advanced a little way further; and beheld, to our
astonishment, three women naked, crying in a most
dreadful manner, and flying as if they had, indeed,
had wings, and after them sixteen or seventeen
men, natives, in the same terror and consternation,
with three of our English butchers (for I can call
them no better) in the rear; who, when they could
not overtake them, fired in among them, and one
that was killed by their shot, fell down in our
sight; when the rest saw us, believing us to be
their enemies, and that we would murder them, as
well as those that pursued them, they set up a most
dreadful shriek, especially the women; and two of
them fell down as if already dead with the fright.
My very soul shrunk within me, and my blood
run chill in my veins when I saw this; and I be-
lieve, had the three English sailors that pursued
them come on, I had made our men kill them all.
However, we took some ways to let the poor fly-
ing creatures, know that we would not hurt them;
and immediately they came up to us, and kneeling
down, with their hands lifted up, made piteous la^
mentations to us to save them, which we let them
know we would do; whereupon they kept all to-
gether in a huddle, close behind us, for protection.
I left my men drawn up together, and charged
them to hurt nobody, but, if possible, to get at
some of our people, and see what devil it was pos-
sessed them, and what they intended to do; and,
in a word, to command them off; assuring them,
that if they staid till day-light, they would have a
hundred thousand men about their ears; I say, I
left them, and went among those flying people,
taking only two of our men with me; and there
was, indeed, a piteous spectacle among them.
Some of them had their feet terribly burnt with
trampling and running through the fire; others
their hands burnt; one of the women had fallen
down in the fire, and was almost burnt to death
before she could get out again; two or three of
the men had cuts in their backs and thighs, from
our men pursuing; and another was shot through
the body, and died while I was there.
I would fain have learned what the occasion of
all this was, but I could not understand one word
they said, though by signs I perceived that some
of them knew not what was the occasion them-
selves. I was so terrified in my thoughts at this
outrageous attempt, that I could not stay theie,
but went back to my own men. I told them my
resolution, and commanded them to follow me,
when in the very moment came four of our men,
with the boatswain at their head, running over the
heaps of bodies they had killed, all covered with
blood and dust, as if they wanted more people to
massacre; when our men hallooed to them as loud
as they could halloo; and, with much ado, one of
them made them hear; so that they knew who we
were, and came up to us.
As soon as the boatswain saw us, he set up a
halloo, like a shout of triumph, for having, as he
thought, more help come ;^ and without bearing to
hear me, Captain, says he, noble captain, I am glad
you are come; we have not half done yet. Vil-
lains ! hell-hound dogs! I will kill as many of them
as poor Tom has hairs upon his head. We have
sworn to spare none of them; we will root out the
very name of them from the earth: and thus he
ran on, out of breath too with action, and would
not give us leave to speak a word.
At last, raising my voice that I might silence
him a little. Barbarous dog! said I, what are you
doing? I will not have one creature touched more,
upon pain of death.. I charge you, upon your
life, to stop your hands, and stand still here, or
you are a dead man this minute.
Why, Sir, says he, do you know what you do,
or what they have done? If you want a reason for
what we have done, come hither; and with that he
shewed me the poor fellow hanging upon a tree,
with his throat cut.
I confess I was urged then myself, and at ano-
ther time should have been forward enough; but I
thought they had carried their rage too far, and
thought of Jacob's words to his sons Simeon and
Levi, " Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce;
" and their wrath, for it was cruel." But I had
now a new task upon my hands; for when the men
I carried with me saw the sight, as I had done, I
had as much to do to restrain them, as I should
have had with the others; nay, my nephew him-
self fell in with them, and told me, in their hear-
ing, that he was only concerned for fear of the
men being overpowered; for, as to the people, he
thought not one of them ought to live; for they
had all glutted themselves with the murder of the
poor man, and that they ought to be used like
murderers: upon these words, away ran eight of
my men with the boatswain and his crew, to com-
plete their bloody work: and I, seeing it quite out
of my power to restrain them, came away pensive
and sad; for I could not bear the sight, much less
the horrible noise and cries of the poor wretches
that fell into their hands.
I got nobody to come back with me but the su-
percargo and two men, and with these I walked
back to the boats. It was a very great piece of
folly in me, I confess, to venture back as it were
alone; for as it began now to be almost day, and
the alarm had run over the country, there stood
about forty men, armed with lances and bows, at
the little place where the twelve or thirteen houses
stood, mentioned before; but by accident I missed
the place, and came directly to the sea-side; and
by that time I got to the sea-side, it was broad
day? immediately I took the pinnace, and went
aboard, and sent her back to assist the men in what
might happen.
I observed, that about the time I came to the
boat-side, the fire was pretty well out, and the
iidise abated; but in about half an hour after I got
on board, I heard a volley of our men's fire-arms,
and saw a great smoke; this, as I understood af-
terwards, was, our men falling upon the forty
men, who, as I said, stood at the few houses on the
way; of whom they killed sixteen or seventeen,
and set all those houses on fire, but did not med-
dle with the women or children.
By that time the men got to the shore again
with the pinnace, our men began to appear; they
came dropping in, some and some; not in two bo-
dies, and in form, as they went out, but all in
heaps, straggling here and there in such manner,
that a small force of resolute men might have cut
them all off.
But the dread of them was upon the whole coun-
try. The people were amazed and surprised, and
so frighted, that, I believe, an hundred of them
would have fled at the sight of but five of our men.
Nor in all this terrible action wa^ there a man who
made any considerable defence; they were so sur-
prized between the terror of the fire, and the sud->
den attack of our men in the dai*k, that they knew
not which way to turn themselves; for if they
fled one way, they were met by one party; if back
again, by another; so that they were every where
knocked down. Nor did any of our men receive
the least hurt, except one who strained his foot,
and another had one of his hands very much
burnt,
I was very angry with my nephew, the captain,
and, indeed, with all the men, in my mind, but
with him in particular j as well for his acting $o
out of his duty, as commander of the sfeip, and hav-
ing the charge of the voyage upon him, as in bis
prompting, rather than cooling, the rage of his
men in so bloody and cruel an enterprise. My
nephew answered me very respectfully; but told
me that when he saw the body of the poor seaman,
whom they had murdered in such a cruel and bar-
barous manner, he was not master of himself, nei-
ther could he govern his passion; he owned, he
should not have done so, as he was commander of
the ship; but, as he was a man, and nature moved
him, he dould not bear it. As for the rest of the
men, they were not subject to me at all; and they
knew it well enough, so they took no notice of my
dislike.
The next day we set sail; so we never heard any
more of it. Our men differed in the account of
the number they killed; some said one thing, some
another. But, according to the best of their ac*
counts put all together, they killed, or destroyed,
about 1§0 people, men, women, and children; and
left not a house standing in the tiown.
As for the poor felloe, Thomas Jeffrys, as he was
%uite dead, for his throat was so cut that his head
was half off, rt wottld do hhn no service to bring
him away; so they left him where they found bim,
only took him down from the tree where he was
hanged by one hand.
However just our men thought this action to be,
I was against them in it; and I always, after that
lime, told them God woald blast the voyage; for
I looked upon the blood they shed that night to be
murder m them: for though it is true that they kill-
ed Thomas Jeffrys, yet it was? as fF&e that Jeffrpi

was the aggressor, had broken the truce, and had
violated or debauched a young woman of their's
who came to our camp innocently, and on the
faith of their capitulation.
The boatswain defended this quarrel when we
were afterwards on board. He said, it was true
that we seemed to break the truce, but really had
not; and that the war was began the night before
by the natives themselves, who had shot at us, and
killed one of our men without any just provocation;
so that, as we were in a capacity to fight them,
we might also be in a capacity to do ourselves jus-
tice upon them in an extraordinary manner; that
though the poor man had taken liberty with a
wench, he ought not to have been murdered, and
that ia such a villanous manner; and that they
did nothing hut what was just, and that the laws
of God allowed toi be done to murderers.
One would thin*k this should have* been enough
to have warned us against goiug onshore among
heathens and barbarians; \bl*fc it is .impossible to

We were now hound tQnth?e,g^lph of Persia, and
from thence to the coast of Coromandel, only to
touch at Surat; but the chief q{ the supercargo's
design lay at the bay of Bengal, where, if he missed
of the business outward-bound, he was to go up to
China, and x&tum. to the,coast as he came home.
The first disaster jthat befgl us was in the gulph
of Persia, where five* ,of our men, venturing on
shoie on thei-Atabian §idejQf the?gulph,i were sur-
rounded by the Arabs, and either ail killed, or car*
ried away into slavery; the rest of the boats' crew
were not able to rescue them, and had but just
time to get off their boat I began to upbraid
them with the just retribution of Heaven in thi*
case; but the boatswain very warmly told me, he
thought I went fiuther in my censures than I could
shew any warrant for in scripture, and referred to
the thirteenth of St. Luke, ver. 4, where our Sa-
viour intimates, that those men, on whom the
Tower of Siloam fell, were not sinners above all
the Galileans; but that which, indeed, put me to
silence in thisoase,* was, that none of these five
men, who were now lost, were of the number of
those who went on shore to the massacre of Mada-
gascar (so I atway& called it, though our men could
not bear the word massacre i*ith any patience):
and, indeed, this last* circumstance, as Iliave said,
put me to silence for the present.
But my frequent preaching to them on this sub-
ject had worse consequences than I expected; and
the boatewaifr/ who liad been the head of the at-
tempt, C3Ltr&ijup boldly to me one time, and told
me, he found that I Continually brought that affair
upon the stage; that I made unjust reflections upon
it, and had used the men Very ill on that account,
arki himself in particular; that as I was but a pas-
senger^ and had no GOftifnandvki the ship, or con-
cern i& the voy^ge^ they were not obliged to bear
it; that they tfid^ncfck&owhtit I might liave some

2 12
done with it, and also not tp concern myself fur-
ther with him, or any of his affairs, he would leave
the ship; for he did not think it was safe to sail
with me among them.
I heard him patiently enough tfll he had done,
and then told him, that I did confess I ha$ all
along opposed the massacre of Madagascar, for
such I would always call it; and that I had ou all
occasions spoken my mmd fieely ahout it2 though
not more upon him than any of the rest; thatas,jto
my having no command in the ship, that was. true,
nor did I exercise any authority, only took the li-
berty of speaking my mind in things which pub-
licly concerned us ail; as to what concern I had
in the voyage, that was none of his business; I
was a considerable owner of the skip, and in th&t
claim I cpnpeived I had a .right to speak, even fur-
ther than I had yet done, and would not b$ ac-
countable to him, or any one else; and began to be
a little warm with him: he made fcut ljtttle reply
to me at that time, and I thought that affair load
been over. We were at this time in the road tp
Bengal; and, being willing to see the place, I went
on shore with the &updreargo, in the ship's boat,
to divert myself; ^nd towards evening was pre-
paring to go on bpard, when one of the men
came to me, and told me, be would not have mc
trouble myself to come dawn to the boat, for tbey
had orders not to carry me on board. Any one
may guess what a surprise 1 was in at so insolent
a message; and I aske^L the &aan, who .bade h$n
deliver that errand to me? He told me,.the cqok-
swain. I said no more to the fellow* butJaidhim
let them know he frad delivered his message, and
that I had given him no answer to it.
I immediately went, and found out the super-
cargo, and told him the story, adding, what I pre-
sently foresaw, viz. that there would certainly be
a mutiny in the ship; and entreated him to go
immediately on board the ship in an Indian boat,
and acquaint the captain of it: but I might have
spared this intelligence, for, before I had spoken
to him on shore, the matter was effected on board:
the boatswain, the gunner, the carpenter, and in
a Word, all the inferior officers, as soon as I was
goti£ off fri the boat, came up to the quarter-deck,
and desired to spe&k with the captain; and there
the boatswain, making a long harangue (for the
fellow talked t*ery well,) and repeating all he had
said to me, told the captain in a few \<rords, that
as I was now gone peaceably on shore, they were
loth to use any violence with me; which, if I had
not gone on shore, they would otherwise have
dbne, to oblige me to have gotie. They therefore
thought fit to tell hinf, that as they shipped them-
sdves to serve' in thd strip undet his command,
they would perform it feithfufty: but if I would
not quit the ship, or the captain oblige me to quit
it, they would all leave the ship, and sail no fur-
ther with him: and at that word ALL, he turned
hi& face about towards the main-mast, which Was
it seems, the signal agreed on between them; at
which #11 the searmen being got together, thejr
cried out, Chae and ALL, Otte Othd ALL!
My tfephe^, the captain, Was af iftan t>f spirit,
afad of great presence of mind', an$ thcftrgh he was
surprised, you may be sure, at the thing, yet he
told them calmly he would consider of the matter;
but that he could do nothing in it till he had
spoken to me about it: he used some arguments
with them, to shew them the unreasonableness
and injustice of the thing; but it was all in vain;
they swore, and shook hands round, before his
face, that they would go all on shore, unless he
would engage to them not to suffer me to come
on board the ship.
This was an hard article upon him, who knew
his obligation to me, and did not know how I
might take it; so he (began to talk cavalierly to
them; told them that I was a very considerable
owner of the ship, ancj that in justice he could not
put me out of my own house; that this was next
door to serving me as the famous pirate Kid ,had
done, who made the mutiny in .the ship, set the
captain on shore in an uninhabited island, and ran
away with the ship; that let them go into what
ship they would, if ever they carpe to England
again, it would cost them dear; that the ship was
mine, and that he would not put me out of it;
and that he would rather lose the ship, and the
voyage too, than disoblige me so much; so they
might do as they pleased. However, he would
go on shore, and talk with me there; and invited
the boatswain to go with him, and perhaps they
might accommodate thejnatter with me.
But they all rejected the proposal; and said,
they would have nothing to do with me anymore,
neither on boajd,t or on shore; and if I pame on
board, they would go on-shore, Weil, said the
captain, if you are all of this mind, let me go on
shore, and talk with him: so away he came to me
with this account, a little after the message had
been brought to me from the cockswain.
I was very glad to see my nephew, I must con-
fess; for I was not without apprehensions that
they would confine him by violence, set sail, and
run away with the ship; and then I had been
stripped naked, in a remote country, and nothing
to help myself: in short, I had been in a worse
case than when I was all alone in the island.
But they had not come to that length, it seems,
to my great satisfaction; and when my nephew
told me what they had said to him, and how they
had sworn, and shook hands, that they would one
and all leave the ship, if I was suffered to come on
board, I told him, he should not be concerned at
it at all, for I would stay on shore: I only desired
he would take care and send me all my necessary
things on shore, and leave me a sufficient sum of
money, and 1 would find my way to England as
well as I could.
This was a heavy piece of news to my nephew;
but there was no way to help it, but to comply
with it So, in short, he went on board the ship
again, and satisfied i the men, that his uncle had
yielded to their importunity, and had sent for his
goods from on board the ship. So the matter was
over in a very few hours: the men returned to
their duty, and I begun to consider what course I
should steer.
I was npw; alone in, the remotest part of the
world, as I think 1 may call it; for I was near
three thousand leagues, by sea, further off from'
England than I was at my island; only, it is true,
I might travel here by land, over the Great Mo-
gul's country to Surat, might go from theffce tb
Bassora by sea, up the gulph of Persia, and from
thence might take the way of the caravans, over
the deserts of Arabia to Aleppo $nd Scarf dei dan;
and from thence by sea again to Italy, and so over
land into France; and this, put together, might
be, at least, a full diameter of the gtobe; but, if
it were to be measured, I suppose it would appear
to be a great deal more.
I had another way before me, which was to* wart
for some English ships, which were coming to
Bengal, from Achin, on the island of Sumatra, and
get passage on board them for England, but as I
came hither without any concern with the English
East-India Company, so it would be difficult to
ffo from hence without their licence, unJess- With
great favour of the captains of the* ships, of dfthe
company's factors; and tor bfttfh I was an utter
stranger.
Here I had the particular pleasure, speaking4 by
contrarieties, to see the ship set sail without me;
» treatment, I think, a man in my circumstances
scarce ever met with, except from pirates runnmg
away with a ship, and setting those that would
not agree with thteirvitlany on shore: ind'eed, thfc
was the next door to it, both ways. However,
my nephew left me two servants, or rather, erne
companion, and one servant: the first w£s* clefrte
to the purser, whbtfi he1 engaged* to gey with me;
and the other was his own sertthlt. I took' mt
also a good lodging in the bouse of an English
woman, where several merchants lodged, some
French, two Italians, or rather Jews, and one
Englishman. Here I was handsomely enough en-
tertained; and, that I might not be said to run
rashly upon any thing, I stayed here above nine
months, considering what course to take, and how
to manage myself. I had some English goods
with me of value, and a considerable sum of
money; my nephew furnishing me with a thou-
sand pieces of eight, and a letter of credit for
more, if I had occasion, that I might not be strait-
ened, whatever might happen.
* I quickly disposeds of my goods, aud to advan-
tage too; and, as I .originally intended, 1 bought
here some very good .diamonds, iwhich, of all other
jfekiags, was the most proper foj; me, in my circum-
stances,* because I might always earry my whole
estate about me.
After a long stay here, and many proposals made
for my .return to England, but none falling to my
mind, the English merchant, who lodged with me,
and. with whom I had contracted an intimate ac-
quaintance, came to m«e pne morning: Country-

you will put a thousand pounds to my thousand
pounds, we will hire a ship here, the first we can
get to our minds; you shall be captain, I will be
merchant, and we will go a trading voyage to
China: for what should we stand still for? The
whole world is in motion, rolling round and round;
all the creatures of God, heavenly bodies and
earthly, are busy and diligent: why should we
be idle? There are no drones, says he, living in
the world but men: why should we be of that
number?
I liked this proposal very well; and the more,
because it seemed to be expressed with so much
good will, and in so fiiendly a manner. I will
not say, but that I might, by my loose and un-
hinged circumstances, be the fitter to embrace a
proposal for trade, and, indeed, for any thing else;
or otherwise, trade was none of my element: how-
ever, I might, perhaps, say, with some truth, that
if trade was not my element, rambling was; and
no proposal for seeing any part of the world which
I had never seen before, could possibly come amiss
to rtie.
It was, however, some time before we could get
a ship to our mind; and when we got a vessel, it
was not easy to get English sailors; that is to say,
so many as were necessary to govern the voyage,
and manage the sailors which we should pick up
there. After some time we got a mate, a boatswain,
and a gunner, English; a Dutch carpenter, and
three Portuguese, foremast men; with these, we
found we could clo well enough, having Indian
seamen, such as they are, to make up.
There are so many travellers who have written
the history of their voyages and travels this way,
that it would be but very little diversion to any
body, to give a long account of the places we went
to, and the people who inhabit there: those things
I leave to others, and refer the reader to those
journals and travels of Englishmen, many of which,
I fiud, are published, and more promised every
day. It is enough for me to tell you, that we
made the voyage to Achin, in the island of Su-
matra, first; and from thence to Siam, where we
exchanged some of our wares for opium, and for
some arrack; the first, a commodity which bears
a great price among the Chinese, and which, at
that time, was very much wanted there: in a word,
we went up to Susham; made a very great voyage;
were eight months out; and returned to Bengal:
and I was very well satisfied with my adventure.
I observe, that our people in England, often ad-
mire how the officers, which the Company send
into India, and the merchants which generally
stay there, get such very good estates as they do,
and sometimes come home worth sixt}', seventy,
and an hundred thousand pounds at a time.
But it is no wonder, or, at least, we shall see so
much further into it, when we consider the innu-
merable ports and places where they have a free
commerce, that it will the^ be no wonder; and
much less will it be so, when vye consider, that all
those places and ports wherpf t;he English ship*
come, thene is so mijch,t3UKl$ucfy constant demand
for the growth of allvQther countries*, that there is
2 £ 2
a certain vent for the return, as well as a market
abroad for the goods carried out.
In short, we made a very good voyage, and I
got so much money by the first adventure, and
such an insight into the method of getting more,
that, had I been twenty years younger, „ I should
have been tempted to have stayed here, and sought
no further for making my fortune: but what was
all this to a man on the wrong side of threescore,
that was rich enough, and came abroad more in
obedience to a restless desire of seeing the world,
than a covetous desire of getting in it? Atid, in-
deed, I think, it is with great justice that I now
call it a restless desire; for it was so: when I was
at home, I was restless to go abroad; and now I
was abroad, I was restless to be at home. I say,
what was this gain to me? I was rich enough al-
ready; nor had I any uneasy desires about getting
more money; and therefore, the profits of the
voyage to me, were things of no great force to
me, for the prompting me forward- to further un-
dertakings; hence I thought, that by this voyage
I had made no progress at all; becauseX was come
back, as I might call it, to the place from whence
I came, as to an home; whereas my eye, which,
like that which Solomon speaks of, was never sa-
tisfied with seeing, was still more desirous of wan-
dering and seeing. I was come into a part of the
world which I never was in before • and that part
in particular, which I had heard much of; and
was resolved to see as much of it as I cbuld; and
then I thought, I might say, I had seen all the
world that was worth seeing.
'"But my fellow-traveller and I had different no-
tions. I do not name this to insist upon my own,
for I acknowledge his was most just, and the most
suited to the end of a merchant's life5 who, when
he is abroad upon adventures, it is his wisdom to
stick to that, as the best thing for him, which he
is likfe to get the most money by. My new friend
kept himself to the nature of the thing, and would
have been content to have gone, like a carrier's
horse, always to the same inn, backward and for-
ward, provided he could, as he called it, find his
account in it; on the other hand, mine, as old as I
Was, was the notion of a mad rambling boy, that
never cares to see a thing twice over.
But this was not all. I had a kind of impatience
upon me to be nearer home, and yet the most un-
settled resolution imaginable, which way to go.
In the interval of these consultations, my friend,
who was always upon the search for business, pro-
posed another voyage to me, viz. among the
Spice Islands; and to bring home a load of cloves
from the Manillas, or thereabouts; places where,
indeed, the Dutch do trade, but the islands belong
partly to the Spaniards; though we went not so
far, but to some other, where they have not the
whole-power as they have at Batavia, Ceylon, &c.
We were not long in preparing for this voyage;
the chief difficulty was in bringing me to come
into it; however, at last, nothing else offering, and
finding that really stirring about and trading, the
profit being so great,, and, as I may say, certain,
had more pleasure in it, and more satisfaction to
the mind, than sitting still; which, to me espe-
cially was the unhappiest part of life, I resolved on
this voyage too: which we made very successfully,
touching at Borneo, and several islands, whose
names I do not remember, aifd came home in about
five months. We sold our spice, which was chiefly
cloves, and some nutmegs, to the Persian mer-
chants, who carried them away for the Gulph; and,
making near five of one, we really got a great deal
of money.
My friend, when we made up this account,
smiled at me. Well now, said he, with a sort of
an agreeable insult upon my indolent temper, is
not this better than walking about here like a man
of nothing to do, and spending our time in staring
at the nonsense a;nd ignorance of the Pagans?
Why truly, said I, my friend, I think it is; and I
begin to be a convert to the principles of merchan-
dizing. But I must tell you, said I, by the way,
you do not know what I am doing; for if once I
conquer my backwardness, and embark heartily,
as old as I am, I shall harass you tip and down
the world till I tire ^ou; for I shall pursue it so
eagerly, I shall never let you lie still.
But to be short with my speculations: a little
while after this, there came in a Dutch ship from
Batavia; she was a coaster, not an European trader,
and of about two hundred tons burden: the men,
as they pretended, having been so sickly, that the
captain had not men enough to go to sea with, he
lay by at Bengal; and, as if having got money
enough, or being willing, for other reasons, to go
for Europe, he gate public notice, that he would
sell his ship: this came to my ears before* my new
partner heard of it; and I had a great mind to buy
it So I went home to him, and told him of it:
he considered awhile, for he was no rash man nei-
ther; but musing some time, he replied, She is a
little too big; but, however, we will have her.
Accordingly we bought the ship; and, agreeing
with the master, we paid for her, and took pos-
session: when we had done so, we resolved to en-
tertain the men, if we could, to join them with
those we had, for the pursuing our business; but
on a sudden, they not having received their wages,
but their share of the money, as we afterwards
learnt, not one of them was to be found. We in-
quired much about them, and at length were told,
that they were all gone together, by land, to Agra,
the great city of the Mogul's residence; and from
thence were to travel to Surat, and so by sea to the
gulph of Persia,
Nothing had so heartily troubled me a good
while, as that I missed the opportunity of going
with them, for such a ramble, I thought, and in
such company as would both have guarded me,
and diverted me, would have suited mightily with
my great design; and I should both have seen the
world, and gome homewards too; but I was much
better satisfied a few days after, when I came to
know what sort of fellows they were; for, in short,
their history was, that this man they called captain
was the gunner only, not the commander; that
they had been a trading voyage, in which they
were attacked on shore by some of the Malaccans,
who had killed the captain and three of his men;
and that after the captain was killed, these men,
eleven in number, had resolved to run away with
the ship, which they did,- and had brought her in
at the bay of Bengal, leaving the mate and five men
more on shore; of whom we shall hear further,
Well; let them come by the ship how they
would, we came honestly by her, as we thought;
though we did not, I confess, examine into things
so exactly as we ought; for we never inquired any
thing of the sean$enr who, if we had examined,
would certainly have f&ulteied in their accounts,
contradicted one another, and perhaps have contra-
dicted themselves; or, one how or other, we
should have seen reason to have suspected them,:
but the man shewed us a bill of sale for the ship,
to one Emanuel Clostershoven, or some such name
(for I suppose it was all a forgery) and called^him-
self by that name; and that we could not contra-
dict him; and being withal a little too unwary, or
at least, having no suspicion of the thing, we went
through with our bargain.
However we picked up some English seamen
here after this, and some Dutch; and we now re-
solved for a second voyage to the south-east, for
cloves, &c. that is to say among the Philippine
and Malacca isles; and, in short, not to fill this
part of my story with trifles, when what is yet to
come is so remarkable, I spent, from first to last,
s*t£ years in this country, trading from port to port,
backward and forward, and with very good suc-
cess; and was now the last' year with my partner,
going in the' ship above-mentioned, on a voyage
to Ch'rtia; byt Uesigning fir,st to go to Siam, to
buy rice.
In this voyage, being by contrary winds obliged
to beat up and down a great while in the straits
of Malacca, and among the islands, we were no
sooner got clear of those difficult seas, but we
found our ship had sprung aleak, and we were not
able, by all our industry, to find out where it was.
This forced us to make for some port; and my
partner, who knew the country better than I did,
directed the captain to put into the river of Cam-
bodia; for I had made the English mate, one Mr.
Thompson, captain, not being willing to take the
charge of the ship upon myself. This river lies
on the north side of the great bay or gulph, which
goes up to Siam.
While we were here, and going often on shore
for refreshment, there comes to me one day an En-
glishman, and he was, it seems, a gunner's mate on
board an English East India ship, which lode in
the same river, up at, or near the city of Cambo-
dia. What brought him hither we knew not; but
he comes up to me, and, speaking English, Sir,
says he, you are a stranger to me, and I to you;
but I have something to tell you, that very nearly
concerns you.
I looked stedfastly at him a great while, and he
thought at first I had known him, but I did not.
If it very nearly concerns me, said I, and not your-
self, what moves you to tell it me? I am moved,
says he, by the imminent danger you are in; and,
for aught I see, you have no knowledge of it. I
know no danger I am in, said I, but that my ship
h leaky, and I cannot find it out; but I propose to
lay her aground to-morrow, to see if I can find it.
vol, n. 2 l
But, Sir, says he, teaky or not leaky, find it or not
find it, you will be wiser than to lay your ship on
shore to-morrow, when you hear what I have to say
to you. Do you know, Sir, said he, the town of
Cambodia lies about fifteen leagues up this river?
And there are two large English ships about five
leagues on this side, and three Dutch. Well, said
I, and what is that to me? Why, Sir, says he, is it
for a man that is upon such adventures as you are,
to come into a port, and not examine first what
ships there are there, and whether he is able to deal
with them? I suppose you do not think you are a
match for them? I was amused very much at his
discourse, but not amazed at it; for I could not
conceive what he meaiit; and I turned short upon
him, and said, Sir, I wish you would explain your-
self; I cannot imagine what reason I have to be
afraid of any of the Company's ships, or Dutch
ships; I am no interloper; what call they have to
say to me?
He locked like a man half angry, half pleased;
and, pausing awhile, but smiling, Well, Sir, says
he, if you think yourstelf Secure, you must take
your chance; I am sorry your fate should blind
you against good advice; but assure yourself, if
you do not put to sea immediately, you will the
very next tide be attacked by five long-boats full
of men; and, perhaps if you are taken, you will be
hanged fot a pirate, and the particulars be examined
into afterwards. I thought, Sir, added he, I
should have met with a better reception than this,
for doing yOu^a piece of 'service of such irop6r-
ta&<5e. lcan^nevfcr be ungmteftil, safid'I, for any
OS HOBJNSQtf cau&OE- 259
service, or to any man that offers me any kind-
nesa; but it is past my comprehension, said I, what
tfeey should have such a design upon me for. How-
ever, since you say there is no time to be lost, and
th^t there is some villanous design in hand against
jne> I will go ou board this minute, and put to sea
immediately, if my men can stop the leak, or if we
can swim without stopping it. But, Sir, said I,
shall I go away ignorant of the reason of all this?
Can you give n^e no further light into it?
I can tell you but part of the story, Sir, says he;
but? I foave a Dutel* seaman here with me, and, I be-
lieve, I could persuade him to tell you the rest;
k\\t there is scarce time for it. But the short of
the story is this* the first part of which, I suppose,
ypu knpw well enoughs viz. That you were with
this ship at Sumatra % that there your captain was
niurdered by the Malaccans, with, three of his
men; and that you* Qr some of those that were on
board with you, ran away with the ship, and are
sinae turned PIRATES* This is the sum of the
<&tory, and yo# will all be seized as pirates, I can
assure yon, and executed with very little cere-
mony; for you know merchant ships shew but lit-
tle law to pirates, if they get them in their power.
Now you speak plain English, said I, and I
thank you; and though I know nothing that we
have done, like what you talk of, but I am sure
fwe came honestly and fairly by the ship; yet see-
ing such work is a d^ing, as you $$y*and that you
jreem to mean honestly* I will Jbe npon my guard.
Nay* Sir* $ay$ he, do not talfcpf being upon your
gua^d; tjhehfeestdpfcrooe is tq be opt of^e dagger:

if you have any regard to your life, and the lives of
all your men, put out to sea without fail at high-
water; and as you have a whole tide before you,
you will be gone too far out before they can come
down; for they will come away at high-water;
and as they have twenty miles to come, you'll get
near two hours of them by the difference of the
tide, not reckoning the length of the way: besides,
as they are only boats, and not ships, they will
not venture to follow you far out to sea, especially
if it blows.
Well, said I, you have been very kind in this:
What shall I do for you to make you amends? Sir,
says he, you may not be so willing* to make nfie
amends, because you may not be convinced of the
truth of it: I will make an offer to you; I have
nineteen months* pay due <to me on board the ship
-« r-, which I<camejowt of England in; and the
Dutchman,'that iswith me,has Seven months pay
xlue to him; if ybu will make gvood our pay to us,
we will go along with you. > If you find nothing
more in it, we will desire no more; but if we do
convince you, that we have saved your life, and
the ship, and the lives of' all the men in her, we
will leave the rest to you.
I consented to this readily; and went immedi-
ately on board, and the two men with me. As
soon as I came to the ship's side, my partner, who
was on board, came on the quarter-deck, and called
to me with a great deal of joy, O ho! O ho! we
have stopped the leak! Say you so, said I, thaifk
God 'f bntweighithe anchor!then immediatefty:
We;g*h! says he, -what do y<M jme&taP by "that^
Whajt is the matter? says he. Ask no questions,
said I, but all hands to work, and weigh without
losing a minute. He was surprised: But, however,
he called the captain, and he immediately ordered
the anchor to be got up; and though the tide was
not quite done, yet a little land-breeze blowing,
W*e stood out to sea; then I called him into the
^abin, and told him the story at large; and we
called in the men, and they told us the rest of it:
but as it took us up a great deal of time, so before
wc had done, a seaman comes to the cabin-door,
and calls out to ust that the captain bade him tell
us, we were chased: Chased, said I, by whom,
and by what? By five sloops, or boats, said the
fellow, full of men. Very well* said I; then it is
apparent there is something in it. In the taext
pl^ce, I ordered all our men to be called up: and
told them, that there was a design to seize the
ship, and to take us for pirates; and asked them,
if they would stand by us, ^nd by one another?
The men answered, cheerfully, one and all, that
they would live and die with us. Then I asked
the captain, what way he thought best for us to
jnanage a fight &ith them .\ for resist them I re-
solved we would, and that to the last drop. He
said, readily, that the way was to keep them off
with our great shot, as long as we could, and then
to fire at them with our small arms, to keep them
from boarding us; bi*t when neither of these
would do any longer, we should retire to our close
quarters 5 perhaps they had not materials to break
qpeya our b^lk-heads^ or get in upon us.
j^The gumj«K h$d, in the mean time* ordtrs to
bring two gunsto bear fore and aft, out of tht
steerage* to clear the deck, and load them with
musket-bullets, and small pieces of old iron, and
what next came to hand; and thus we made ready
for fight; but all this while kept out to sea, with
wind enough, and could see the boats at a distance,
being five large long-boats following us, with aH
the sail they could make.
Two of these boats, which by our glasses, we
could see were English, had out-sailed the rest,
were near two leagues a~head of them, and gained
upon us considerably; so that we found they
would come up with us: upon which we fired a
guti without a shot, to intimate that they should
bring to; and we put out a flag of truce, as a sig-
nal for parley; but they kept crowding after lis,
till they came within shot: upon this we took m
out* white flag, they having made no answer to it,
hung out the red flag, and fired at them with shot.
Notwithstanding this, they came on till they were
near enough to call to them with a speaking trum-
pet, which we had on board; so we called to them,
and bade theni keep off at their peril.
It was all one, they crowded after us, and en?-
deavoured to come under our stern, so to board
lis on our quarter. Upon which, seeing they were
resolute for mischief, and depended upon the
strength that followed ttoem, I ordered to bring
tfoe ship to^ so that they lay upon our broadside,
when i mmediatfcly we fired' five guns at them; one
of them had beet* levelled $b true, as to carry
away the steM of 1^hiild€«i0st boat, arid bring
th&fr W the ^cei&foy/bfi their sail,
aad running all to the head of the boat to keep
her from sinking; so she lay by, and had enough
of it; but seeing the foremost boat still crowd on
after us, we made ready to fire at her in particular.
While this was doing, one of the three boats
that was behind, being forwarder than the other
two, made up to the boat which we had disabled,
to relieve her, and we could afterwards see her
take out the men: we called again to the foremost
boat, and offered a trace to parley again, and to
know what was her business with us; but had no
answer: only she crowded close under our stern.
Upon this our gunner, who was a very dexterous
fellow, run out his two chace guns, and fired at
her; but the shot missing, the men in the boat
shouted, waved their caps, and came on; but the
gunner, getting quickly ready again, fired among
them a second time; one shot of which, though
it missed the boat itself, yet fell in among the
men, and we could easily see had done a great
deal of mischief among them; but we, taking no
notice of that, weared the ship again, and brought
our quarter to bear upon them; and, firing three
gunk more, we found the boat was split almost to
pieces; in particular, her rudder, and a piece of
her stern, were shot quite away; so they handed
their sail immediately, and were in great disorder:
but, to complete their misfortune, our gunner let
fly two guns at them again; -where he hit them
we could* not telH but we found the boat was sink-
ing, and some of the m$Tk already in the water:—
Upon this I imnredfelely ma»ed out our pinnace,
which we h#d kept qlosfc by o%& side, ^itb orde?s
to pick up some of the men, if they could, and
save them from drowning, and immediately to
come on board with them; because we saw the
rest of the boats began to come up. Our men in
the pinnace followed their orders, and took up
three men; one of which was just drowning, and
it was a good while before we could recover him.
As soon as they were on board, we crowded all
the sail we could make, and stood further out to
sea; and we found, that when the other three
boats came up to the first two, they gave over
their chace.
Being thus delivered from a danger, which
though I knew not the reason of it, yet seemed
to be much greater than I apprehended, I took
care that we should change our course, and not
let anyone imagine whither we were going; so
we stood out to sea eastward, quite out of the
course of all European ships, whether they were
bound to China, or any where else, within the
commerce of the European nations.
When we were now at sea, we began to consult
with the two seamen, and inquire first, what the
meaning of all this should be? The Dutchman let
us into the secret of it at once; telling us, that
the fellow that sold us the ship, as we said, was
no more than a thief that had run away with her.
Then he told us how the captain, whose name too
he mentioned, though I do not remember it now,
was treacherously murdered by the natives on the
coast of Malacca, with three of his men; and that
he, this Dutchman, and four more* got into the
woods, where they wandered about a great while;
till at length, he, in particular, ia a miraculous
manner, made his escape, and swam off to a Dutch
ship, which, sailing near the shore, in its way
from China, had sent their boat on shore for
fresh water; that he durst not come to that part
of the shore where the boat was, but made shift in
the night to take in the water further off, and
swimming a great while, at last, the ship's boat
took him up.
He then told us, that he went to Batavia, where
two of the seamen belonging to the ship had ar-
rived, having deserted the rest in their travels;
and gave an account, that the fellow who had run
away with the ship, sold her at Bengal to a set of
pirates, which weie gone a cruising in her; and
that they had already taken an English ship, and
two Dutch ships, very richly laden.
This latter part wre found to concern us directly;
and though we knew it to be false, yet, as my part-
ner said very well, if we had fallen into their hands,
and they had }swch a prepossession against us be-
fore-hand, it had bee;n in vain for us to have de-
fended ourselyes, or to hope for any good quarters
at their hands; especially considering that our ac-
cusers fyad been our judges, and that we could have
expected nothing from them but what rage would
have dictated, and u$g]overoed passion have exe-
cuted a and therefore ifc w#s his opinion, we should
go directly back to Bengal, frock whence we came,'
without putting iq at<any port whatever; because
there w% could give, ai* ^cc&unt of ourselves, and
could prove wbea$ \pe w$F& when the ship put m
wfiomwe bought her of, and the like; and, which
VOL. II. 2 M
i
was more than all the rest, if we were |>ut to the
necessity of bringing it before the proper judgesr
we should be sure to have some justice; and not
be hanged first, and judged afterwards.
1 was some time of my partner's opinion; but
after a little more seiious thinking, I told him, I
thought it was a very great hazard for us to at-
tempt returning to Bengal, for that we were on
the wrong side of the straits of Malacca; and that
if the alarm was given, we should be sure to be
way-laid on every side, as well by the Dutch of
Batavia, as the English elsewhere; that if we
should be taken, as it were running away, we
should even condemn ourselves, and there would
want no more evidence to destroy us. I alscr
asked the English sailor's opinion, who said, he was
of my mind, and that we should certainly be
taken.
This danger a little startled my partner, and all
the ship's company; and we immediately resolved
to go away to the coast of Tonquin, and so on to
China; and from thence pursuing the fiist designr
as to trade, find some way or other to dispose of
the ship, and come back in some of the vessels of
the country, such as we could get. This was ap-
proved of as the best method for our security; and
accordingly we steered away N. N. E. keeping
above fifty leagues off from the usu^l course to
the eastward.
This, however, put us to some inconveniences^
for first the winds, when we came to'that distance
from the short, seemed to be more stfc&dily against
us, blowing almost trade, as we call it, from the
east ^*id E. N. E. so that we were a long while
upon our voyage; and we were but ill provided
with victuals for so long a run; and, which was
still worse, there was some danger, that those En-
glish and Dutch ships, whose boats pursued us,
Whereof some were bound that way, might be got
in before us; and if not, some other ship, bound
to China, might have information of us from them,
and pursue us with the same vigour.
I must confess, I wasr now very uneasy, and
thought myself, including the late escape from the
long-boats, to have been in the most dangerous
condition that ever I was in through all my past
life; for, whatever ill circumstance I had been in,
I* was never pursued for a thief before; nor had I
ever done any thing that merited the name of dis-
hronest or fraudulent, much less thievish- I had
chiefly been mine own enemy; or, as I may rightly
say, I had been nobody's enemy but my own.
But now I was embarrassed in the worst condition
imaginable; for though I was perfectly innocent/
I was in no condition to make that innocence ap-
pear. And if I had been taken, it had been under
a supposed guilt of the worst kind; at least, a
crime esteemed so among the people I had to do
with.
This made me very anxious to make an escape,
though which way to do it, I knew not; or what
port or place we should go to. My partner,
seeing me thus d^ected, though he was the
most concerned at first, began to encourage me;
and describing to m& th$ several ports of that
2 u 2
coast, told me, he would put in on the coast of
Cochinchina, or the bay of Tonquin; intending ta
go afterwards to Macao, a town once in the pos-
session of the Poituguese, and where still a great
many Euiopean families resided, and particulaily
the missionary priests usually went thither, in order
to their going forward to China.
Hither we then resolved to go; and accordingly,
though after a tedious and irregular course, and-
very much straitened for provisions, we came
within sight of the coast very early in the morn-
ing; and, upon reflection upon the past circum-
stances we were in, and the danger, if we had not
escaped, we resolved to put into a small river,
which, however, had depth enough of water for us,
and to see if we could, either over land or by the ,
ship's pinnace, come to know what ships were in-
any port thereabouts. This happy step was, in-
deed, our deliverance; for though wq did not im-
mediately see any European ships in the bay of
Tonquin, yet, the next morning, there came into
the bay two. Dutch ships, and a third without any
colours spread out, but which we believed to be a
Dutchman, passed by at about two leagues dis-
tance, sheering for the coast of China; and in the
afternoon went by two English ships, steering the
same course; and thus, we thought, we saw our-
selves beset with enemies, both one way and the
other. The place we were in was wild and bar-
barous, the people thieves, eve$ by occupation or
profession; and though, it is trpe, yve had not piucli
tp seek of them, and exQgpt gptti$g\a fpw proyi-
sions, cared not how little we had to do with them;
yet it was with much difficulty that we kept our-
selves from being insulted by them several ways.
We were in a small river of this country, within
a few leagues of its utmost limits northward; and
by our boat we coasted north-east to the point of
land which opens to the great bay of Tonquin;
and it was in this beating up along the shore, that
we discovered as above, that, in a word, we were
surrounded with enemies. The people we were
amahs: were the most barbarous of all the inhabi-
tatits of the coast; having no correspondence with
any other nation, and dealing only in fish and oil,
arid such gross commodities; and it may be par-
ticularly seen, that they are, as I said, the most
barbarous of any of the inhabitants, viz. that among
other customs they have this one, that if any ves-
sel had the misfortune to be shipwrecked upon their
coast, they presently make the men all prisoners;
that is to say, slaves; and it was not long before
we found a spice of their kindness this way, on the
occasion following.
I have observed above, that our ship sprung a
leak at sea, and that we could not find it out; and
however it happened, that, as I have said, it was
stopped unexpectedly, in the happy minute of our
being to be seized by the Dutcih and English ships,
near the bay of Siam; yet, as we did not find the
ship so perfectly tight and sound as we desired, we
resolved, while we were in this place, to lay her
on shore, take out #hdt heavy things We had on
board, which:- v^cflf^1 ^iiot'-iiitBittiy^" sEnd:' ¥0^ 'wasl^'' and
clean her bottom; and if possible, to find out
where the leaks were.
1 Accordingly, having lightened the ship, and
brought all our guns, and other moveable things,
to one side, we tried to bring her down, that we
might come at her bottom; for, on second thoughts,
we did not care to lay her dry a-ground, neither
could we find out a proper place for it.
The inhabitants, who had never been acquainted
with such a sight, came wondering down to the
shore to look at us; and seeing the ship lie down
on one side in such a manner, and heeling towards
the shore, and not seeing our men, who were at
work on her bottom, with stages, and with their
boats on the off side, they presently concluded that
the ship was cast away, and lay so very fast on
the ground.
On this supposition they came all about us in
two or three hours time, with ten or twelve large
boats, having some of them eight, some ten men
in a boat, intending, no doubt, to have come on
board and plundered the ship; and if they found
us there, to have carried us away for slaves to their
king, or whatever they call him, for we knew not
who was their governor.
When they came up to the ship, and begai^i to
row round her, they discovered us all hard at work
on the outside of the ship's bottom and side, wash-
ing and graving, and stopping, as every seafaring
man knows how.
They stood for a while gazing at us, and we,
who were a little surprized, could not imagine
what their design was; but, being willing to be
sure, we took this opportunity to get some of us
into the ship, and others to hand down arms and
ammunition, to those that were at work to defend
themselves with, if there should be occasion; and
if was no more than need; for, in less than a quar-
ter of an hour's consultation, they agreed, it seems,
that the ship was really a wreck; that we were all
at work, endeavouring to save her, or to save our
lives by the help of our boats; and when we
handed our arms into the boats, they concluded, by
that motion, that we were endeavouring to save
tome of our goods. Upon this they took it for
granted they all belonged to them; and away they
came directly upon our men, as if it had been in a
line of battle.
Our men, seeing so many of them, began to be
frighted; for we lay but in an ill posture to fight,
and cried out to us to know what they should do?
^immediately called to the men who worked upon
the stages, to slip them down, and get up the side
into the ship; and bade those in the boat to row
round and come on board; and those few of us who
were on board, worked with all the strength and
hands, we had, to bring the ship to lights; but
however, neither the men upon the stage, nor
those in the boats, could do as they were ordered,
before the Cochinchinese were upon them; and,
with two of their boats boarded our long-boat,
afid began to lay hold of the men as their pri-
soners*
The first man they laid hold of was an English
seaman, a stout strong fellow, who having a raus-
quet in his hand, never offered to fire it, but laid
it down in the boat, like a fool, as I thought. But
he understood his business better than I could
teach him; for he grappled the pagan, and dragged
him by main force out of their own boat into ours;
where, taking him by the two ears, he beat his
head so against the boat's gunnel, that the fellow
died instantly in his hands; and in the mean time,
a Dutchman, who stood next, took up the mus-
quet, and with the butt-end of it, so laid about him,
that he knocked down five of them, who attempted
to enter the boat: but this was little towards re-
sisting thiity or forty men, who fearless, because
ignorant of their danger, began to throw themselves
into the long-boat, where we had but five men to
defend it: but one accident gave our men a com-
plete victory, which deserved our laughter rather
than any thing else; and that was this—
Our carpenter being prepared to grave the out-
side of the ship, as well as to pay the seams where
he had caulked her, to stop the leaks, had got two
kettles just letdown into the boat; one filled with
boiling pitch, and the other with rosin, tallow,' and
oil, and such stuff as the shipwrights used for that
work; and the man that tended the carpenter had
a great iron ladle in his hand, with which he sup-
plied the men that were at work with that hot
stuff: two of the enemy's men entered the boat just
where this fellow stood, being in the fore-sheets;
he immediately saluted him with a ladleful of the
stuff, boiling hot, which so burnt and scalded them,
being half naked, that tlley roared out like two
bujls, and enraged with the fire, leaped both into
the sea, The carpenter saw it, and cried out, Weil
done, Jack, give them some more of it; when step-
ping forward himself, he takes one of their mops,
and dipping it in the pitch-pot, he and his man
threw it among them so plentifully, that, in short,
of all the men in three boats, there was not one
that was not scalded and burnt with it in a most
frightful pitiful manner, and made such an howl-
ing and crying, that I never heard a worse noise,
and, indeed, nothing like it; for it was worth ob-
serving, that though pain naturally makes all peo-
ple cry out, yet every nation have a particular way
of exclamation, and make noises as different from
one another as their speech. I cannot give the
noise these creatures made, a better name than
howling, nor a name more proper to the tone of
it; for I never heaid any thing more like the
noise of the wolves, which, as I have said, I heard
howl in the forest on the frontiers of Languedoc.
I was never pleased with a victory better in my
Iflfe; not only as it was a perfect surprise to me,
and that our danger was imminent before; but as
we got this victory without any bloodshed, except
of that man the fellow killed with his naked hands,
and which I was very much concerned at; for I
was sick of killing such poor savage wretches, even
though it wa& in my own defence, knowing they
came on errands which they thought just, and
knew no better: and that though it may be a just
thing, because necessary, for there is no necessary
wickedness in nature; yet I thought it was a sad
life, when we must be always obliged to be killing
our fellow-creatures to preserve ourselves; and, in-
VOL. II, 2 N
deed, I think so still; and I would, even now,
suffer a great deal, rather than I would tyke away
the life even of the worst person injuring ipq, X
believe also, all considering people, who knovtf the
value of life, would be of my opinion, if Jtfyey en-
tered seriously into the consideration of it.
But to return to my story: All the while this
was doing, my partner and T, who managed the
rest of the men on board, had, with great dexte-
rity, brought the ship almost to rights; and, hav*
ing gotten the guns into their places again, the
gunner called to pie, to bid our boat get out of
the way, for he would l$t fly among them. J
called back again to him, and bid him not offer to
file, for the carpenter would do the woik without
him; but bade him heat another pitch-kettle;
which our cook, who was on board, took care of.
But the enemy was so tenified with what they
met with in their first attack, that they would,not
come on again; and some of them, that were fur-
thest off, seeing the ship swim, as it were, upright,
began, as we supposed, to see their mistake, and
gave over the enterprise, finding it was not as they
expected. Thus we got clear of this merry fight;
and, having gotten some rice, and some roots and
bread, with about sixteen good big hogs, on board,
two days before, we resolved to stay here iio
longer, but go forward, whatever came of it; for
we made no doubt but we ^hoyld be surrounded
the next day with rogues enough, perhaps more
than our pitch-kettle would dispose of for us.
We, therefore, got all ouj* things on board the
samp evening^ and thp next mprpipg were jeady

Not being able to put the old man out of his

I told "him, we were gentlemen as well as mer-
chants; and that we had a mind to go and see flie^

The old man found me H little confused, and^
under some concern, when he named a Dutch ship;
and said to me, Sir, you need be under np appre-
hension of the Dutch, I suppose they are not now
at war with your nation. No, said I, that's true;
but I know not what liberties men may take,
when they are out of the leach of the laws of their
country. Why, said he, you are no pirates, what

said I, it is true, I am a little unsettled in my reso-
lution at this time, whither to go jn particular]
$nd I am something more, so, for what you said
about pirates; I hope ?t)i§ie are* no pirates in thes§

seas these fifteen years, except one, which was
seen, as I hear, in the bay of Siam, about a month
sindtf; but you may be*assured she is gone to the
southward; nor was she a ship of any great force,
6t fit for the work: she Was not built for a pri-
vateer, but was run away with by a reprobate
crew that were oti hoard, after the captain and
some of his men had been murdered by the Ma-
laceans, afc or near the island of Sumatra.
What! said Ir seeming to know nothing of the
matter, did they murder the captain? No, said he,
I <da not understand that they murdered him; but,
as they afterwards ran away with the ship, it is
generally believed they betrayed him into the
hands*of the Malayans, who did murder him;
and, perhaps, they procured them to do it. Why
tlien,* said I, thdy deserved death, as much as if
they had done it themselves. Nay, said the old
matt, they do deserve it; and they will certainly
have it if they light upon any English or Dutch
ship; for they have all agreed together, that if
they*meet that rogue, they will give him no
quarter. -
But, said I to, him, you say the pirate is gone
out of these seas; how can they meet with him
then? Why, that is true, said he, they do say so;
but»he was, as I tell you, in the bay of Siatn, in
the river Cambodia, and was discovered there by
soinfe Dutchmen, who belonged to the ship, and
who were left on shbte wheit they run away with
her; and some English and Duteh traders being
in the river, they were within a little of ^taking
him. Nay, said he, if'the ' foremost <- boats ^fead
been Welt seconded by* the &s% thfcy had^ertainly
280* I*I£E AWTJ> M)YEN.XXJ^BS
taken him; but he, finding only twp boats within

two, and disabled t^em before the others came
up^ and then standing off-to sea, the othe$a wseiie
not able to foll6w him, and so he got awdy. Hut
they have all so exact a description of the skip,
that they will be sure to know him; andwherewr
they find him, they have Vowed to give no quarter
to either the captain or the seamen, but to hang
them all up at the yard-arm*
What! said I, will they execute them right >o*
wrong; hang them first, and judge them after-
wards? O, Sit! said the old pilot, there is mo need
to make a formal business of it with such rogues
as those; let them tie them bapk to back, anti set
them a diving; it is no more than they rightly
deserve.
I knew I "had my ohl man fast aboard, and that
he could do me no harm^ so I turned! short upo»
him; Well^ Seignior, said I, and this^ is the very
reason why I would have yQU caray us-taNaaquiiv
and not to put back to Macao, or to any-other
part of the country, where the English or Dutch
ships came; for, be it known to you, Seigniory
those captains of the English and Dutch, ships, are
a parcel of rash, proud, insolent fellows, that.nei*
thfcr know what belongs to>ju&tice, or how to-be-
have themselves, asr the laiws of God and natua^
direct; but being proud of their offices, and&ofc

replied,-. I..-should meet with customers enough for
the ship at Nanquin, and that a Chinese junk
would serve me very well to go back again; and
that he would procure me people to buy.one,, and
sell, the other.
Well, but, Seignior, says I, as you say they
know the ship so well, I may, perhaps, if I follow
your measures, be instrumental to bring some ho-
nest innocent men into a terrible broil, and, perhaps,
be murdered in cold blood; for wherever they find
the ship they will prove the guilt upon the men,
by proving this was the ship; and so innocent men
may brobably be overpowered and murdered-
Why, said the old man, I will find out a way to
prevent that also; for as I know all those com-
manders you speak of very well, and shall see them
all as they pass by, I will be sure to set them to
rights in the thing, and let them know that they
had been so much in the wrong; that though the
people who were on board at first might run away
with the ship, yet it was not true that they had
turned pirates; and that in particular those were
not the men that first went off. with the ship, but
innocently bought her for their trade; and I am
persuaded they will so far believe me, as, at least,
to,act more cautiously for the time to come. Well,
said I, and will you deliver one message to them
from me? Y.es,,I .-will, says he, if you will give it

285 life and adventures
Bengal; the Dutchmen, who, it was said, had the
names of all the men that were in the ship, might
easily see that we were a mixture of English, Por-
tuguese, and Indians, and but two Dutchmen on
board, These, and many other particular circum-
stances, might have made it evident to the under-
standing of any commander, whose hands we
might have fallen into, that we were no pirates.
But fear, that blind useless passion, worked ano-
ther way, and threw us into the vapours; it be-
wildered our understandings, and set the imagina-
tion at work, to form a thousand terrible things,
that, perhaps, might never happen. We first sup-
posed, as indeed every body had related to us, that
the seamen on board the English and Dutch ships,
but especially the Dutch, were so enraged at the
name of a pirate, and especially at our beating off*
their boats, and escaping, that they would not give
themselves leave to inquire whether we were pi-
rates or no; but would execute us off-hand, as we
call it, without giving us any room for a defence.
We reflected that there was really so much appa-
rent evidence before them, that they would scarce
inquire after any more; as, first, that the ship was
certainly the same, and that some of the seamen
among them knew her, and had been on board her;
and, secondly, that when we had intelligence at
the river Cambodia, that they were coming down
to examine us, we fought their boats, and fled. So
that we made no doubt but they were as fully sa-
tisfied of our being pirates, as we were satisfied of
the contrary; and I often said, I knew not but I
should have been apt to have taken the little cir-
OX. PwO BIN. S 0 N C RU S 0 E• 287
cumstances for evidence, if the tables were turned,
and my case was theirs; and have made no scru-
ple : of cutting all the crew to pieces, without be-
lieving, or perhaps considering, what they might
have to offer in their defence.
But let that be how it will, those were our ap-
prehensions; and both my partner and I too,
scarce slept a night without dreaming of halters
and yard-arms; that is to say, gibbets; of fighting,
and being taken; of killing, and being killed; and
one night I was in such a fury in my dream, fan-
cying the Dutchmen had boarded us, and I was
knocking one of their seamen down, that I struck
my double fist against the side of the cabin I lay in,
with such a force as wounded my hand most grie-
vously, broke my knuckles, and cut and bruised
the flesh, so that it not only waked me out of my
sleep, and I was once afraid I should have lost two
of my fingers.
Another apprehension I had, was, of the cruel
usage we should meet with from them, if we fell
into their hands: then the story of Amboyna came
into my head, and how the Dutch might, perhaps,
torture us, as they did our countrymen there; and
make some of our men, by extremity of torture,
confess those crimes they never were guilty of;
own themselves, and all of us, to be pirates; and
so they would put us to death, with a formal ap-
pearance of justice; and that they might be
tempted to do this, for the gain of our ship and
cargo, which was worth four or five thousand
pounds, put all together.
These'things tormented me, and my partner too^
night and day; nor did we consider that the cap-
tains of ships have no authority to act thus;, and if
we had surrendered prisoners to them they could
not answer the destroying us, or torturing us, hut
would he accountable for it when they came into
their own country. This, I say, gave me no sa-
tisfaction; for, if they will act thus with us, what
advantage would it be to us that they would be
called to an account for it; or, if we were first to
be murdered, what satisfaction would it be to us
to have them punished when they came home?
. I cannot refrain taking notice here what reflec-
tions I now had upon the past variety of my particu-
lar circumstances; how hard I thought it was, that
1, who had spent forty years in a life of continued
difficulties, and was, at last, come, as it were, at
the port or haven which all men drive at, viz. to
have rest and plenty, should be a volunteer
in new sorrows, by my own unhappy choice; and
that I, who had escaped so many dangers in my
youth, should now come to be hanged in my old
age, and in so remote a place, for-a crime I was
not in the least inclined to, much less guilty of;
and in a place and circumstance, where innocence
was not like to be any protection at all to me.
After these thoughts, something of religion
would come in; and I would be considering that
this seemed to me to be a disposition of imme-
diate Providence; and I ought tq look upon it,
and submit to it, as such: and although I was
innocent as to men, I was far from being inno-
cent as to my Maker; and I ought to: look in,
and examine, what other crimes in my life were
rtmt Hflbtftff* x\b W, afrd fbr which Providence
mighl justly itifiict this punishment as a retribu-
tlhiff ml that I bught to submit to this, just as T
#oul4 to a shipwreck, if it had pleased God to
fe&tf e hi'eugbt* sudh a disaster upon rhe.
*4n its^ 'tutrr, natural courage would sometimes
fetfeo itsplaiee; atid then I would be tklking myself
Up t& vigdrous resolution, that I would not be taken
to bfc barbarously used by a parcel of merciless
wtetclrcs in cold blood; that it was mucli better
to ha?v« fallen into the hands df the savages, who
W^tfe m«n-eaters, and Who, Fwas sure, would feast
upon me, when they had taketi ink, than by those
vvho would, perhaps, glut their tage' upon me by
hihdtnan tortures and barbarities:'that, in the case
of the^vages, I always resolved t6 die fighting,
to the*last gasp; atid why should I fiot do so now,
sefeirfg it was much more dreadful, to me at least,
to think of falling into these men's hands, than ever
it%a^ to tMak of heingr eaten by men: for thq sa-

watta' another toad i tig," which'he wotildpay the
freight <>£'befo)re>they went from Japan;, and that,
at their return, he Would buy the ship. I began
to listen to this I proposal; and soeagef did rtiyfoead
still >run upon^rafnbfeig, that I could not but begin
to enteitain a notion of myself of going with'bim,
and so to sail frotn the Philippine islands away to
thd Sottth Seas; and accordingly 1 asked the Ja-
panese merchant, if he would not hire us to1 the
Philippine islands, and dischargers there He said,
noi hb could not1 do that; for then he could not
hWe the return of his cargo; but he would dis?
charge us in Japan, he said, at the ship's return.
Well,'Still I was for taking him at that proposal,

gers; as well of'the teas,-as of the Japanese, Who

»£fBut, >td ^ringirthist'tong turn of our affairs ^to
a c&ftGliTsfan;1 *the first thing we had to do, was to
eotmilt with the captain of the ship, and with the
tn&iir land kmiow if they were willing to go to Ja-
pati; and, iwhile^LwaS d©d<ng>this,rthe young man*

tiiat if1! woeuidtnot^apnti^woul^gwejhim'leave, he
"woufcl g^as'arijixhQlifcHt,* arhow*I pteasedrtoi order
him; that if ever he came to England, and I was
there, and alive, he would render me a faithful ac-
count of his success, and it should be as much
mine as I pleased.
I was really loth tapart with him; but, consi-
dering the prospect of advantage, which wa& really
considerable, and; that he was a young fellow as
likely tQ do well in it as any I knew, I inclined to
let him, go; but fii;st I t9ld him I would consult my
partner and give him an answer the next day.
B^y partus a*)d I discoursed about it; and my
p$rt;n?r niade,a most generous offer: he told me,
ypij know it has been an unlucky ship, and we
tjoth regolve not to go to sea in it again; if your
steward (so he called my man; will ventuie the
voyage, I will leave my share of _the vessel tp hiip*
and let him make the best of it; and if we livs to
meet in England, and he meets with success
abroad, he shall account for one half of the. pro-
fits of the ship's freight to us, the other shall b§
his own.
If my partner, who w&s no way co^pemed wit|i
my ycxung man^ made him such an offer, I could
do no less than offer him the same; and all the
ship's company being willing to go with him, we
made over half the ship to him in property, and took
a writing from him, obliging h^m to account for
the other; and away he went to Japan. The J[a~
pan merchant proved a .very punctual honest man
to htm, protectee^ Jhim at Japan, and got him a li-
cence to come on shore, yfhjch the Europeans in

a couple of rog^ufes too: for, as they believed the
storjr of our being pirates, anc( that we had really
run away with the ship, they came down to us,
not only to betray the design that was formed
against us, but to go to sea with us as pirates; and
one of thefri confessed afterwards, that nothing
else but the hopes of going a roguing broiight him
to do it. However, the service they did us was
not the less; and therefore, as I had promised to be
grafeftil 'to them', I'first ordered the money to be
pMtfWfhefti, which they said was due to them on
bfeVd their ^espectfivVnahips; that is to'say, the
Ehgl&htoall h^itiet'eeh month's pay, and to' tie
Bufrbhthsin seveii;Hand; over and above that/ X
glW each df<tliem & small sum of money in gofd*
ifrWch cbn tented them very well: then I made the
Englishman gunner of the ship, tlie gunner being
now ihade second mate and purser; the Dutchman
Tin&de boatswain: so they were both very well
pleased and pVbved Very serviceable, ieing both
tkHe setting, and very stout fellows.
W£ Hvere now on'shore in China. If 1 thought
rifyself banished, and remote from nly own coun-
try at Bengal, where I had many ways to get home
for my money, what cduld I think of myself now,

nese junks or vessels from Nanqum, that wpuld
be to be sold, and would carry us and our gooda
whither we pleased. This I liked veiy well, and
resolved to wait; besides, as our particular persons
were not obnoxious, so if any English or Dutch
ships came thither, perhaps we might have an op-
portunity to load our goods, and get passage to.
some other place in India nearer home. A
Upon these hopes we resolved to continue here*
but, to divert oui selves, we took twooi three jpur-
nies into the country; first, yre went ten days jour*
ney to see the city of Nanquin, a city well wprjtjb
seeing indeed: they say it has a million of people in
it; which, however, I do not belipve. It is rggu?
larly built, the streets all exactly straight, and cross,
one another in direct lines, which gives the figure
of it great advantage.
Bitf; when I came to compare the miserable peo^
pie of these countries with our's; their fabrics,
their manner of living, their government, their re-
ligion, their wealth, and ttheir glory (as. some call
it), I must confess, X do not so much as think it
worth naming, or \yoi;th my while to write*of* or
any that shall come after me to read.
It is very obsembjle, that we wonder a£ the
grandeur, the riches, the pomp, the ceremonies,
the government, the manufactures, the commerce,
and the conduct of these.people; not that they .are
to be wondered af, or, tindeec^ in the least t<* be
regarded s but because, haying^ first; a notion of $ie
barbarity jof those countries, tliq rudene^, and^tlfy?

greatness of thfcirweafrlv, thbir trade, the power of
their government, and strength of their armies are
surprising to us, because,as-I have said, consider-
ing them as a> barbarous nation of > pagans, little
better thau savages, we did not expect such things
am#ng them;< and this, indeed, is the advantage
with which ail their greatness and power is irepTe*
sented to us: otherwise, it is in itself toothing*at
all; for; as I have said of their ships, so it may be
said of their armies and troops; all the forces of
their eittpfre, though they were to bring* twot mil*
lions of men into the field together, would be able
ta* db nothing but ruin the country, and starve
thfetnselves. If they wfere to besiege a: strong to^n

Having lesolved upon this, we agreed, that if our
Portuguese pilot would go with us, he woijld beajr
his charges to Moscow, or to England, if hp
pleased; nor, indeed, were we to be esteemed over
generous in that part neither, if we had not re-
warded him further; for the service he had done
us was'ieally woith all that, and more; for he h^d
not only been a pilot to us at sea, but he had beqi
also like a broker for us on shore; and his procure
ing for, us the Japan merchant, was some hundreds
of pound? in our pockets. §o we consulted tog^-
i^ier about it; and, being wjllling to gratify him,
which wa$, indeed, but doing him justice, and ve;y
willing also to have him with us besides, for he
was a most necessary man on all occasions, we
agieed to give him a quantity pf coined gol;d, which,
as I compute it, come to a,bout 175 pounds ster-
ling between us, and to b^ar his charges, both for
himself 94ul horse, except only a* horse to carry hi$

Wfe would set him safe ashore, (life and casualties

n'L He deceived the proposal like a man transported,
atfd tbld us, hre would go with us over1 the whole
#6rld; tod sd, in short, We all prepared ourselves
fox* the journey.' However, as it was with us, so
it w&4 with the other merchants, they had many
things to do; and instead of being ready in five
weeks/it was four months ahd some odd days be-
fore alt thifcgs'wert got together.
-L It Was thfc1 beginning of February, our styfe,
%vhen Ve^etrotit from Pekrn. My partner and th£
old pilot had gone express back to the port whete
Wt had first put fn, to dispose of sotne goods which
Ve hkd left thereT tmd I, with a Chinese merchant,
whom I had kome knowledge of at Nanquin, and
Mio 5came to Pefcin on life owti affairs, went to
Nanquin, where I bought ninety pieces of fine da-
lilasks, with about two hutidrtd pieces of other
V&ry fWs'ilks, of several" sorts!; some mixed with
^bldj and ha& alt these bhJught to Pekin ^gathst
my partner's r&turni besides "this, We bbtight a
very large quantity of raw silk, and some other
goods; our cargo amounting, in these goods only,"
to.about three thousand five hundred pounds ster-
ling, which, together with-, tea, and some fine-cali-
coes, and three camel-loads of nutmegs and cloves*
loaded in all eighteen camels for our share, besides
those we rode upon; which, with two or thre^
spare horses, and two horses loaded with provi?
sions, made us, in short, twenty-six camels' and
horses in our retinue.
The company was very great, and, as near as I
can remember, made between three and four hun-
dred horses and camels, and upward of an hundred
and twenty men, very well armed, and provided
for all events. For; as the eastern caravans are
subject to be attacked by the Arabs, so are these
by the Tartars; but they are not altogether so dan-
gerous as the Arabs, nor so barbarous when they
prevail.
The company consisted of people of several na-
tions, such as Muscovites chiefly; for there were
about sixty of them who were merchants or inha-
bitants of Muscow, though of them some wen*
Livonians; and, to our particular satisfaction, five
of them were Scots, who appeared also to be men
of great experience in business, and very good sub-
stance.
.. Wheti we had travelled one day's journey, the
guides, who were five in number, called all the
gentlemen and merchants; that is to say, all
the passengers, except the servants, to a great
council, as they termed it. At this great council

r We were all this while in the Chinese dominions,
a,nd therefore the Tartars were not so bold as af-
terwards; hut in about five days we entered a va#t
great wild dpsart, which held us three days and
nights march; and we were obliged to carry^ou^:
water with us in great leather bottles, and to em-
camp all night, just as I have heard they do in.the
deserts of Arabia*
I asked our guides, whose dominion, this ,w^
in? and they told me this was 5a kind of bprder
that might be called No Man's Land; being part
0f the Great Karakathy, or Grand Tartary; bqt
that, however, it was reckoned to China; thftt
there was no care taken i here to preserve it froEfL
the inroads of thieves; and therefore it was re^ck*
oned the worst desert in the whole march, though
Yf$ we,re to go over sQt^e much larger.

well enough too; but away he flew, and carried
him quite out of the pilot's reach; and, at some

Accordingly) two days after, we had 200 soldiers
sent us from a garrison of the Chinese on our left,
atid three hundred more from the city of * Nauro*
and with those we advanced boldly: the thtee
hundred soldiers from Naum marched in ou$ front?,
the two hundred in our rear, and our meii on each
side of our camels with our baggage, and thfc
whole caravan in the centre; in this order, aiiid
wall prepared for'battle,* we thought ouiselves a
inafcchi fb» tha w-holfe ten thousand Mogul Tartars*,
if t they had appealed; but the next clay, when
&ey did*appear> it was'quite another thing.
It was easrly mi the-morning, when marching
from a little, well-situated town, called Changu,
we had a river to pass, where we»were obliged to
ferry;Land had the Tartars had any intelligence
then had been^ the time to have attacked us, when,
the caravan4 being over, the rearguard was behind:
butitheydid not appear there.

most ignorant of pagans: and 50 indeed we found
it
We were now launched into the greatest piece
of solid earth, if I understand any thing of the
surface of the globe, that is to be foupd in any
part of the world: we had at least twelve hundred
miles to the sea, eastward; we had at least two
thousand to the bottom of the Baltic sea, west-
ward; and almost three thousand miles, if we left
that sea, and went on west to the British and
French channelsi.we had fall five thousand miles
to the Indian or Persian sea, south; and about
eight hundred miles to the frozen sea, north; nay,
if some people may be believed, there might be
no sea north-east till we came round the pole, and
consequently into the .north-west, and so had a
continent of land ijnto America, no mortal knows
where; though I could give some reasons why
I believe that to be a mistake too.
As we entered into the Moscovite dominions, a
good while before we came to any considerable
town, we had nothing to observe there but this:
first, that all the rivers run to the cast; as I un-
derstood by the charts which some of our caravans
had with them, it was plain that all those rivers
ran into the great river Yamour, or Gammour,
This river, by the natural course of it, must run
into the east sea, or Chinese ocean. The story
they tell us, that the mouth of this river is choaked
up with bulrushes of a monstrous growth, viz.
three feet about, and twenty or thirty feet high,
I must be allowed to say^ I believe nothing of;
but as its navigation is of no ufee, because there b
no trade that way, the Tartars, to whom alone it
belongs, dealing in nothing but cattle; so nobody
that ever I heard of; has been curious enough ei-
ther to go down to the mouth of it in boats, or to
come up from the mouth of it in ships; but this is
certain, that this river running due east, in the la-
titude of sixty degrees, carries a vast concourse of
rivers along with it, and finds an ocean to empty
itself in that latitude; so we are sure of sea there.
Some leagues to the north of this river there are
several considerable rivers, whose streams run as
due north as the Yamour runs east; and these are
all found to join their waters with the great river
Tartarus, named so from the northern most nations
of the Mogul Tartars, who, the Chinese say, were
the first Tartars in the world; and who, as our
geographers allege, are the Gog and Magog
mentioned in sacred story.
These rivers running all northward, as well as alt
the other rivers I am yet to speak of, made it evi-
dent that the northern ocean bounds the land
also on that side; so that it does not seem rational
in the least to think that the land can extend itself
to join with America on that side, or that there is
not a communication between the northern and
the eastern ocean; but of this I shall say no more;
it wras my observation at that time, and therefore
I take notice of it in this place. We now advanced
from the river Arguna by easy and moderate jour-
neys, and were very visibly obliged to the care the
czar of Muscovy has taken to have cities and towns
built in as many places as are possible to place
them, where his soldiers keep garrison,' sdmethin^

them again.
Our caravan rested three nights at the town,
which was about four miles off, in order to pro-
vide some horses, which they wanted, several of
the horses having been lamed and jaded with the
badness of the way, and our long march over the
last desart; so we had some leisure here to put my
design in execution. I communicated my project
to the Scots merchant of Moscow, of whose cou-
rage I had a sufficient testimony, as above. I told
him what I had seen, and with what indignation
I had since thought, that human nature could be
so degenerate. I told him, I was resolved, if I
could get but four or five men well armed to go
with me, to go and destroy that vile, abominable
idol; to let them see, that it had no power to help
itself, and consequently could not be an object of
worship, or to be prayed to, much less help them
that offered sacrifices to it.
He laughed at me: said he, Your zeal may be
good; but what do you propose to yourself by it?
Propose! said I; to vindicate the honour of God5
which is insulted by this devil-worship. But how
will it vindicate the honour of God? said he, while
the people will not be able to know what you mean
by it, unless you could speak to them too, and tell
them so; and then they will fight you too,"I will
assure you; for they are desperate fellows, and
that especially in dpfence of their idolatry. Can ,
we not, said I, do it in the night, and then leave
them the reasons, in writing, in, their own lan-
guage? Writing! said he, why thprp is,not in five
nations of them, one man that knows any thing
33$ lifj| aap APY^N^runxs
of % letter, or how 1 to read a.wordr ijpl any lan->
guage, or in their own. Wretched jgnpranee!
said I to him; howqver, I haye a great mipd to, do
it; perhaps nature<may flraw inferences fromTit to,
them, to let them see how brutish they are to wp^
ship such horrid things. Look you, Sir, said he,
if your ?z^al{ prompts jou to it so warmly, you
must do it; but, in the next place, I would have,
you consider th^ese wild nations of people are sqb-<
jested tyy force to the, ,czar of Muscovy's domi-,
nipns;, ^nd if yoi^ do this, \p is ten to one but they(

This, I pt^nfess, put,newtthpugjhtts into my he^d
for awhile; hut I harped upon the same stiing,
stilly and all tfjiat day I was uneasy to put my pro-
ject ip execution. Towards the evening, thefScpjts
merchant met me by accident in our w^Ik about
the town, and desired to speak with me. I be-;
lieye^ said he, I have put you off your good ftesign;.
I "have been a little concerned about it since; for I
ab}ior the idol and idolatry as much as you can dp^
Truly, said I, you have put it off a little, as to the^
execution of it,x but; you have not put it all out o£
ray thoughts; and, I believe., I shall do it still be^
fore I quit this placed though I were to be deli-,
vered iip to them for satisfaction. ^No, po, said he;,
Gop fqrbicl tliey should, deliver you up to such a;
cijew of monsters! .they shall not do that neither
tfiat wouiil be murdenngvyou indeed. Why* sa"l

they tdok him and stripped him stark naked, and
sfetliim upon the top of the idol monster,' and
sfOod atl round him, and shot as many aiYoWs int<)
hhtfas toould stick over his whole body; and then
th^y 'burnt him and all th6 arrows sticking in
h1tii> as a sacrifice to the idbl. And Was this the
san/e idol? said I. Yes, said he, the very satiie.
WWl, said I, I will tell you a story/ "So I related
tfie story of our men at Madagascar, arid how tHey
butnt and sacked the village there, and killed man,
Wottikn; &nd child, for their murdering one of our
men, just as it is related before; and when I had
done, I added, that I thought we ought to do so
to this village.
5 He listened very attentively to the story"; but
when I talfeed of doing so to that village, said he,
ydu mistake very much; it was not this village, it
w|s almost an "hundred miles from this place; but
it W&s the s£me idol| for they carry him aboiit in
procession all over the country. Well, said I, then
th^t idoKought to be punished for it; and it shall,
sitid I, if I five this night out.

had| $fc oter g*eat satisfaction, jftst pitched upon a
pla&^fcr our camp, which was very convenient for
themJght; for as wewertfupon h desart, though
b&t at the beginning of it, that was above five hun-
dred miles over, we had no towns to lodge at,
a&d, indeed expected none but the city JaraWena,
which we had yet two days march to; the desart,
however, had some few woods in it on this side, *
and*little rivers, which ran all into the great river
Uddaa It was in a narrow straight between two
small, but very thick woods,. that we pitched our
little camp for that night, expecting to be at-
tacked in the night. ' f
-Nobody knew but ourselves what we wer& pur-
sued for; but as it was usual for the Mogul Tar-
tars to go about in troops in that desart, so the ca-
ravans always fortify themselves every night
against them, as against armies of robbers; and it
was therefore no new thing to he pursued. ? t
But we had this night, of all the nights of our
travels,* a most advantageous camp; for ws lay be--
tween two woods* with a little rivulet running josfc *
befote our fronts so that we could not be stfp- ""
rounded or attacked anjr way, but in our front or <
row; we took care also to make our front as strong
aswe could, by placing our packs, with our camels
andb horses, all in a, line on* the side of the river,
ai|d* we felled some trees ah our rear.
In this posture we encamped for the night; but
the enemy was upon us before, we had ^finished om
situation: they did not come on us like thieves, 4s
we expected^ but seat three messengers toixis^ tor
dfi^and theraen t& b£ delivered to) them; that ha*t *
VOL. IX, 2 Y
abused their priests, and burnt their god Qhim-
Chi-Thaungu, that they nrfght burn them With
fire; and, upon this, they said they would go
away, and do us no further harm, otherwise they
would burn us all with fire. Our men looked very
blank at this message, and began to> stare at one
another, to see Who looked with most guilt in their
faces, but, nobody was the word, nbbody did it.
The leader of the caravan sent word, he was well
assured it was not done by any of our camp; that
we were peaeeable merchants, travelling on our
business; that we had done no harm to them, or
to any one else; and therefore they must look fur-
ther for therrenerniefc, whohad injured them, for we
were not the people; so desired them not to dis-
turb us; for if th6y did, we should defend our*
selves.
They were ^fer from being satisfied with this for
an answer, and a great crowd of them came down
in the morning, by break of day,> to our camp;
but, seeing us in such an advantageous situation,
they durst come no further than the brook in our
front, where they stood, aftd shewedltts» such a num-
ber, as, indeed, terrified us vfery much; for those
that spoke least of them, spoke of ten thousand.
Here they stood, knd looked at ufr a while, and
then setting up a great howl, they let fly a eloud
of arrows among its; but*we were well enough
fortified for that, for We were sheltered umder our
baggage; and I do not remember that one man of
ns was hurt.
Some time after this, We saw them move a lit-
tle to our right, and expected them on the rear,
when a cunning fellow, a Cossack, as they call
thenv of Jarawena, in the pay of the Muscovites,
palltpg to the leader of the caravan, said to him, I
will send all these people away to Sibeilka. This
was a city four or five days journey, at least, to the
south, and rather behind us. So he takes his bow
and arrows, and, getting on horseback, he rides
away from our rear directly, as it were, back to
Nertziaskay; after this he takes a great circuit
about, and comes to the army of the Tartars, as if
he had been sent express to tell them a long story,
that the people who had burnt their Cham-Chi-
Thaungu were gone to Sibeilka, with a caravan of
miscreants, as he called them; that is to say,
Christians; and that they were resolved to burn
the god Seal Isarg, belonging to the Tongueses.
As this fellow was a mere Tartar, and perfectly
spok$ their language, he counterfeited so well* that
they all .took it from him$ and away they drove,
in a most violent hurry, to Sibeilka, which, it
seems, w^s five days journey to" the south; and in
less than three hotus they were entirety out of
our sight, ->and we never heard any more of Iherp,
nor ever knew whether they went to that other
place called Sibeilka, or no*
So we passed safely on to the <sity of Jarawem,
where there was a garrison- of Muscovites; and
there we rested five days, the carayan being ex-
ceedingly fatigued with the J^st day's march, and
with want of rest in the nigbt,
From this city we had a frightful desart, which
held us threenancUtweuty cjays march. We fur-
nished ourselves * with sqi»q tents here, for the bet-
2 y 2
14& Lft$ AtiD AtWBlPftJR&S
tex* accommodating ourselves in the night; and
the leader of the caravan procured sixteen car-
riages, or waggons, of the country, for carrying*
our water and provisions; and these carriages were
our defence every night round our little camp; so
that had the Tartars appeared, unless they had
been very miimerous indeed, they would not have
been able to hurt us.
i>We mayiwell be supposed to want rest again
after this long journey; for in this desart we sa^
neither house or trfee, or scarce a bush; we saw,
ipdeed,; abundance of* the sable-hunters, as> they
called* them. These are all Tartars of the Mogul
Tartary of whicb this cotintry is a part; and they
frequently attack small caravans; but we sa\^ nd
numbers of cthem together. I was cuiioUs to see
the sable-skins they catched; but I could never
speak with any of them; for they durst not come
near us; neither durst we<straggle from our com-
pany ta go near them.
* After we had passed this desart, we came into #
country pretty well inhabited; that is to say, we
fennel towns and castles settled by the czar of
Muscovy, with garrisons of stationary soldiers
to protect the caravans, and defend the country
against the Tartars, who would otherwise make it
very dangerous travelling; and his czarish majesty
has givea such strict orders for the well guarding
the^ caravans and naerchamts, that if there are
any Tartars heard of in the country, detachments
of the garrison are always sent to see travellers
safe from station to station,

had ^mqpportaiiy to make a .visit to, by means
oft tbe^oote merchant, wbo was acquainted with
l$m, offered us a guard of fifty men, if we thought
there was any danger^ to the next station^
I thought'long before this, that^s,we? came
nearer to Europe, we should find*the country bet-?
ter„ peopled* and the people more civilized; <b®& I
found myself mistaken in both, for we hadyetitbd
nation of theTongueses to pass through* where
we saw the same tokens of paganism and barbarity*
of)worse, than before;, only as they wese conquered
^y_the Muscovites, and entirely xeduced,* jfehey
were tfot jso dangerous; but fcr> the rudeness of
ipa*nners> idolatry, and polytheism^ no people inthfe
WiOrld ever went beyond them. They are clothed
all in skins of beasts, and their houses are built of
the same. Yqu know not & man firom & womaii,
neither (by the ruggedness of their countenance^
or, their, clothes; jand inp the winters, when the
ground is covered with snow> they live under
ground* in houses like vaults* which have cavities
or caves going* from <^ue to another.
If the Tartars bad tkei^Cham-Chi-Thaungu for
a^hqle village, ,or aountry,t these had idols.irf
eveny hut, and, every*cave; besides, they worship
^be,stars, the sun, the water, the snow; and, in^a
\^>rd* every thing that they do mot understand,
apd they understand but very little; so that almost
$v$ry element, every meomismm things sets them
^sacrificing*
»But I am no more to describe people than coun-
tries, any further than my own story come® to be
formed in* them, * I met with nothing peculiar
to myself in all this country, which, I reckon, was,
from the<desart which I spqke of last; at ileast four
hundred miles, half of it being another desert,
and took us up twelve days severe travelling,
without house, tree, or bush; but were obliged
again to carry our own provisions) as well water
as bread. After we were out of this desart, and
had travelled two clays, we came to Janezay, a
Muscovite city or station, on the great river Jane-
zay. This river, they told us, parted Europe from
Asia, though our map-makers, as I am told, do
Hot agree to it; however, it is certainly the eastern
boundary .of the ancient Siberia, which now makes
a province oply of the vast Muscovite empire, bi*t
is itself equal in bigness to the whole empire of
Germany.
And yet here I observed ignorance and paganism
still prevailed, except in the Muscovite garrisons.
All the country between the river Oby, and the
river Janezay, is as entirely pagan, and the people
as barbarous, as the remotest of theffartars; nay,
as any nation, for aught I know> in Asia or Ame-
rica* I also found, which I observed to the Musco-
vite governors, whom I had opportunity to converse
^itfy that the pagans ^re not much the wiser, or
the jnearer Christianity, for being under the Mus-
covite government; which they acknowledged
was true enough, but, they said, it was none of
their business; that if >the czar expected to convert
his Siberian, or Tonguese, or Tartar subjects, it
should be ^dpi^ b$\ sending ^clergymen among
them, not soldiers; and they added with moiesin-
cerity th#n I expected; that they found 'it was not
so my^fe^tfaeiconceftt' of their monarch to make thef
peopleiChristians, as it was to make them sub-
jects.
From this river to the great river Oby, we
crossed awild Uncultivated country; I cannot say
it is a barbarous soil; it is only barren of people,
and wants good management; otherwise it is in
itself a most pteasantr fruitful, and agreeable coun-
try. What inhabitants we found in it are all pa-
gans, except such as are sent among them from
Russia; for* this* isrthe^ country, 1 mean on both
sides the riwrQby, whither the Muscovite crimi-
nals? »that are not put to death, are banished, and
ftfon* whence it is ne&t to impossible they should
ever come away.

twasr now in a quite different climate from *my
beloved island, where I never felt coldr except
when I had iny ague; on the contrary, I had much
to dti to bear ray clothes on my back, and never
made any fire bat without doors, and my neces^
sity* in dressing my food, &c. Now I made me
tht^e good vests, with large robes or gowns over
th&tif ito hang down to the feet, and button close
to the wrists, and all these lined with furs, to make
theniisufficiently warm*
As?toa"warm house, I must confess, I greatly
dislike our way in England, of making £res in
every room in the house, in open chimnies, which,
when the fire was out, always kept the air in the
room cold as the climate* But taking* an apart-
ment in a good house in the town, I ordered a
chimney to he built like a furnace, in the centre of
six several rooms, like a stovef; the funnel to carry
th^smoke went up one way, the door to come .at
the- firfc went in another, and all the rooms were
kept equally warn** but no fire seen; like as they
heat thfe bagnios in England,
By this means we had always the same climate
in all the rooms, and an equal heat was preserved;
and how cold soever it was without, it was always
wafrm within; and yet we saw no fire, nor were
ever incommoded with any smoke.

in a future state; and in this, he said, they were
more happy in their banishment, than all their ene-
mies were, who had the full.possession of all the
wealth and power that they (the banished) had left
behind them. . ;
Now, Sir, said he, do I bring my mind, to this
politically, by the necessity of my circumstances,
-winch some call miserable; but, if I know any
thing of myself, I would not go backr;or iiot
though my master, the czar, should call me, cind
offer to reinstate me in ail .my former grandeur;
I say, I would no more go back to it, than J-be-
lieve, my soul when it shall be delivered-from this
prison of the body and lias had a taste of the -glo-
rious state beyond life, would come back to the
gaol of flesh and blood it is now enclosed in, and
leave heaven to deal in the dirt and grime of hu-
man affairs.
He spak 5 this with so much warmth in his tern*
per, so much earnestness and motion of his spirits,
which were apparent in his countenance, that it
was evident it was the true sense of his soul; and,
indeed, there was no room to doubt his sincerity.
I told him, I once thought myself a kind of a
monarch in my old station, of which I had given
him an account, but that I thought he was not a
monarch only, but a great conqueror; for that he
that has got a victory over his own exorbitant de-
sires, and has the absolute dominion over himself,
and whose reason entirely governs his will, is cer-
tainly greater than he that conquers a city. But,
my lord, said I, shall 1 take the liberty to ask you
a question?. With all my heart, said he. If the
door of your liberty was opened, said I, would not
you take take hold of it to deliver yourself from
this exile?
Hold, said he, your question is subtle, and re-
quires some serious just distinctions to give it a
sincere answer; and I will give it you from the
bottom of my heart. Nothing that I know of in
this world would move me to deliver myself from
the state of banishment, except these two. First,
the enjoyment of my relations; and, secondly, a
little vvarmer climate: but I protest to you, that to
go back to the pomp of the court, the glory, the
power, the hurry of a minister of state; the wealth,
the gaiety, and the pleasures, that is to say, follies
of a courtier; if my master should send me word
this moment, that he restores me to all he banished
me from; I protest, if I know myself at all, I
would not leave this wilderness, these desarts, and
these frozen lakes, for the palace of Moscow.
But, my lord, said I, perhaps you not only are
banished from the pleasures of the court, and from
the power,, and authority, and wealth, you enjoyed
before, but you may be absent too from some of
the conveniences of life; your estate, perhaps, con-
fiscated, and your effects plundered; and the sup-
plier left you here may not be suitable to the ordi-
nary demands of life.
Ayr said he, that is as you suppose me to be, a
lord, or a prince, ,&c. So, indeed, I am; but you
are now to consider me only as a man, an human
creature, not at all distinguished from another;
and so I can suffer no want, unless I should be vi-
sited With sickness and distempers, However, to
put the question out of dispute; you see our manner;
we are in this place five persons of rank; we live
perfectly retired, as suited to a state of banishment;
we have something rescued from the shipwreck of
our fortunes, which keeps us from the mere neces-
sity of hunting for our food; but the poor soldiers
who are here, without that help, live in as much
plenty as we. They go into the woods, and catch
sables and foxes; the labour of a month will main-
tain them a year; and as the way of living is not
expensive, so it is not hard to get sufficient to our-
selves. So that objection is out of doors.
I have no room to give a full account of the
most agreeable conversation I had with this truly
great man; in all which he shewed, that his mind
was so inspired with a superior knowledge of
things, so supported by religion, as well as by a
vast share of wisdom, that his contempt of the
world was really as much as he had expressed, and
that he was always the same to the last, as will ap-
pear in the story I am going to tell.
I had been here eight months, and a dark dread-
ful winter I thought it to be; the cold was so
intense, that I could not so much as look abroad
without being wrapt in furs, and a mask of fur be-
fore my face, or rather a hood, with only an hole
for breath, and two for sight. The little day-light
we had, was, as we reckoned, for three months,
not above five hours a day, and six at most; only
that the snow lying on the ground continually,
and the weather being clear, it was never quite
dark. Our horses were kept (or rather starved)
ufoder ground; and,-as for our servants (for \ve
hired servants here to look after our horses and
ourselves), we had every now and then their fin-
gers and toes to thaw, and take care of, lest they
should mortify and fall off.
It is true, within doors we were warm, the
houses being close, the walls thick, the lights
small* and the glass all double. Our food was
chiefly the flesh of deer, dried and cured in the sea-
son ; good bread enough, but baked as biscuits;
dried fish of several sorts, and some flesh of mut-
ton, and of buffaloes, which is pretty good beef:
AH the stores of provision for the winter are laid
up in the summer, and; well cured- our drink was
water mixed with aqua vite instead of brandy;
and, for a treat, mead instead of wine, which, how-
ever, they have excellent good. The hunters,
who ventured abroad all weathers, frequently
brought us in fresh venison, very fat and good;
and sometimes bear's flesh, but we did not much
care for the last. We had a good stock of tea,
with which we treated our friends as above; and,
in a word, we lived very chearfully and well, all
things considered.
It was now March, and the days-grown consi-
derably' longer, and the weather at least tolera-
ble; so other travellers began to prepare sledges
to carry the.m over the snow, and to get things
ready to' be goi rtg; but my measures being fixed,
as I have -said, for, Arch-Angel, and not for Mus-
covy or the Baltic^ I made no motion, knowing
Y:ery w<?ll, that the ships from the south do not
setout fbMhat part of the world till May or June;
and that if I was there at the beginning of August,
it would be as soon as any ships would be ready to
go away; and therefore, I say, I made no haste to
be gone, as others did; in a word, I saw a great
many people, nay, all the travellers, go away be-
fore me. It seems, every year they go from thence
to Moscow for trade; viz. to carry furs, and buy
necessaries with them, which they bring back :tO'
furnish their shops; also others Ivent on the same
errand to Arch-Angel; but then they also, being
to come back again above eight hundred miles?
went all out before me.
. In short, about the latter end of May, I began
to make all ready to pack up; and as I was doing
this, it occurred to me, that seeing all these people
were banished by the czar of Muscovy to Siberia,
and yet, when they came there, were at liberty to
go whither they would; why did they not then
go away to any part of the world wherever they
thought fit? and I began to examine what should
hinder them from making such an attempt.
But my wonder was over, when I entered upon
that subject with the person I have mentioned, who
answered me thus. Consider, first, said he, the
place where we are; and, secondly, the condition
we are in; especially, said he, the generality of
the people who are banished hither. We are
surrounded, said he, with stronger things than bars
and bolts: on the north side is an unnavigable
ocean, where ship never sailed, and boat never
swam; neither, if we had both, could we know
whither to go with them. Every other way, said
he, we have above a thousand miles topass through
vol* ir» s a
'362 LTFfe A15TD* AlDVE-aTTURBS
the c2ar*s own dominions, and by ways utterly im-
passable, except by the roads made by the govern-
ment, and: through the towns garrisoned by h|s
troops; so that we could neither pass undiscovered
"by the road, or subsist any other way:' so that it is
in vain to attempt it. ' i
I was silenced, indeed, at once, and found that
they were in a prison every jot as secure as if
they had been Wcked Up in the castleof Moscow;
however, it £ame into my thoughts, that I might
cekainly be nrade^an instrument to procure th&es-
cape of this excellent person, and that it was very
easy for me'to carry him away, there being i$o
guard over him in the country; and as I was not
<^6iflg to Mosc6ttrJ but to Arfch'Angel, and tbM I
wentin the riaturfe of thfe? caravan, by Which I was
not obliged to lie in the stationary towns in the
desartf, but tfodld encamp every night where I

the largest desert to pass over that we met with
in all the journey; indeed I call it the worst* ^be-
cause the way was very deep in some'placfes, xmd
y^ry uneven in cithers; the best we had to say for ii,
was, that we thought we had no troops of Tartars
and robbers to fear, and that they never ckmi on
this side the \ river Oby, or at least but'ver^ sel-
dom; but we found it otherwise. . >»
4 My young loud had with him a faithful Musco-
vite servant, oi\ rather.a!Siberian 'servant, who was
perfectly acquainted with the country; and who
led us by private roads, that we avoided coming
into the principal towns and cities upon the great
road, suieh as Tubmen, Soloy Kamaskoy, and several
others ;< because the Muscovite garrisons, which
are kept there, are very curious and strict in their
observation upon travellers, and searching lest,any
&f the banished persons of iiote should make their
escape that way into Muscovy; but by this mean*,
-as we Were kept out of the cities, so our whole
journey was a, depart, and we were' obliged to *n-
* camp and lie in our tentsr wheh we had good ae-
hcoirnnpdation'in the pities on the way: this the
young lord wa& so sensible of, that he would not
- allow v»si to lie .abrqafd, when we came to seve-
ral cities on the way^.but lay* abroad himself, with

 We were just entered Europe, having passed-the
jriver Kama, which, in these parts, is the boundary'
.between Europe and Asia; and the first city on
the European side was called Soloy Kxtaoskoy,
which is as much as to sajr, the great city on the
river Kama; and here we thought to have seen
some evident alteration in the people, their man-
ners, their habit, their religion, and their business;
but we were mistaken; for as we had a vast desert
to pass, which by relation, is near seven hundred
miles long in some places, but not above two hun-
dred miles over where we passed it; so, till we
came past that horrible place, we found little differ-
ence between that countrv, and the Moo-ul Tar-
tary; the people mostly Pagans, and little better
.than the savages of America; their houses and
towns full of idols, and their way of living wholly
barbarous, except in the cities as above, and the
villages near them; where they are Christians, as
they call themselves, of the Greek church, but
even these have their religion mingled with so
*nany reliques of superstition, that it is scarce to
be known in some places from mere sorcery and
witchcraft.
• In passing this forest, I thought, indeed, we
must, after all our dangers were, in our imagina-
tion, escaped, as before, have been plundered and
robbed, and perhaps murdered by a troop of
thieves; of what country they were, whether the
roving bands of the Ostiaehi, a kind of Tartars, or
wild people on the banks of the Oby, had ranged
thus far; or whether they were the sable-hunt-
ers of Siberia, lam yet at a loss to know; but

tliey were dll oil horseback,1 parried bovt^s and ar-
rows, and were at first about five-and-forty in nufrr-
ber; they bapne'so hear to i]$ as within'about two
musquet stioij/aficl, askihg iio questions, they sur-
rounded us'wilh their horse,'and' lbokdd( very ear-
nestly upon us twice; at length they placed'them-
selves'just in our way; upon which1 we dreVir uji in
a little line before'our camels, being; n6t above six-
teen men in all; arid, being drawn up thus, Hve
Raited, and sent out the Siberian servant who at-
tended bis lord, to "see who they were; Tiis hiaster
was the more willing to let him go, because'he
was not a little apprehensive that they were a'Si-
berian fro,op sent out' aft^r him. The man came
up near them with a flag of" truce, and called to
them; but though he spoke several of their lan-
guages, or dialects of languages rather, be could
not understand a word they said: however, after
some signs to him not to come'nearer to them at
liis peril, so he said he understood them to mean,
offering to shoot at him if he advanced, the fellow
$ame back no wiser than he went, only that by
their dress, he said, he believed them to be some
Tartars of Kalmuck, or of the Circassian hordes;
and that there must be more of them on the great
desert, though he never heard that ever any of
them were seen so far north before.
This was1 small comfort to us; however, wc
had no remedy: there was on our left hand, at
about a quarter of a mile's distance, a little grove
or clump o'f trees, which stood close together, and
very near the road; I immediately resolved we
would advance0 to those tr^es, arid "fortify ourselvte
01- fl0Bia,S0>f CRUSOE. 371
as well as we could there; for, first, i considered
thai the trees would in a great measure cover us
from their arrows; and in the next place, they
could not come to charge us in a body; it was,
indeed,, my old Portuguese pilot who proposed it;
and who had this excellency attending him,
namely, that he was always readiest and most apt
to direct and encourage us in cases of the most
danger. We advanced immediately with what
speed we could, and gained that little wood, the
Tartars, or thieves, for we knew not what to call
them, keeping their stand, and not attempting to
hinder us. When we came thither, we found, to
our great satisfaction, that it was a swampy,
springy piece of ground, and, on the other side, a
great spring of water, which running out in a little
rill or brook, was a little further joined by ano-
ther of the like bigness; and was, in short, the head,
,or source of a considerable river, called afterwards
the Wirtska. The trees which grew about this
spring, were not in all above two hundred, but
were very large and stood pretty thick; so that as
soon as we got in, we saw ourselves perfectly safe
from the enemy, unless they alighted and attacked
us on foot.
But to make this more difficult, our Portuguese,
with indefatigable application, cut down great
arms of the trees, and laid them hanging, not cut
quite off, from one tree to another; so that he
made a continued fence almost round us.
We staid here, waiting the motion of the enemy
some hours, without perceiving they made any
offer to stir; when about two hours before night

when we foeti.
'!W5ej aimed so tru'e (or Providence directed am-
sh-otsosure) that^e ^killed fourteen of them at
the,* first volley, amd Wounded several others, as
also several of their horses; for we had all of -us
loaded our pieces with two* 01*'three bullets apiece,
at^eastl
T^hey were terribly ^stwprised with our fire, and
retreated {immediately about one? hundred rods
from us*; m which time >we loaded our pieces
a«ahva*kl seeing'them keep that distance, we sal-
lied* out, and/©aught fouT or five of their'tidrees,
whose riders, we supposed, were killed; and com-
frig up to the dead, we could easily perceive they
were Tartars, hut knew not from M'hat country, or
how ihey came to make an excursion such an un-
usual length.
; About an hour after, they made a motion to at-
tack us again, and rode round our little wood, to
see where else they might break in: but finding
us always ready to face them, the}' went off again,
and we resolved not to stir from the place for that
might. *;.*
We slept a little, you may be sure; but spent
the most part of the night in strengthening our
situation, and barricading the entrances into the
wood; and, keeping a strict watch, we waited for
day-light, and, when it came, it gave us a very un-
welcome discovery indeed: for the enemy, who,
\ve thought were discouraged with the reception
they had met with, were now increased to no less
than three hundred, and had set up eleven or
twelve huts and tents, as if they were resolved to
besiege us; and this little camp they had pitched,
was upon the open plain, at about three quarters
of a mile from us. We were indeed surprised at
this discover}7; and now, I confess, I gave my-
self over for lost, and all that I had. The loss of
my effects did not lie so near me (though they
were very considerable) as the thoughts of falling
into the hands of such barbarians, at the latter
end of my journey, after so many difficulties and
hazards as I had gone through; and even in sight
of our port, where we expected safety aad deliver-
ance. As for my partner he was raging; he de*
dared, that to lose his goods would be Jits ruin;-
and lie would rather die than be starved;, and, he
was for fighting to the last drpp.r,
The young lord, as gallant as ever fle^s.hewed
itself* was for fighting to the last a}sp; and my old
pilot was of the opinion wc were abl.e ,to- resist;
them all, in the situation we then were in:, and;
thus we spent the day in debates of what we
should do; but towards evening, we found that
v.) I ^
the number of our enemies still increased: per?_
haps, as they were abroad in several parties for
prey, the first had sent out scouts to call for help^
and to acquaint them of their booty; and we die}
not know but by the morning they might still bq
a greater number; sol beg^,n to inquire of thp'sq
people we had brought from Toboiski, if there
was Ho other, or more private ways, by which we
might avoid them in tne night, and perhaps, eithejr
tetreat to some town, or get help to guard us qver
the desert
The Siberian, who was servant to the young
lord, told us, if we designed to avoid them, and
$xot fight, he would engage to carry us off in \hc
night to a way that went north towards the river
Petraz, by which he mad^e no doubt but we
might get away, and theNTartars never the wiser;
but he said, his lord had told him, he would not re-
turn, but would, rather, chuse to .fight. I told
him, he mistook his lorcU for that he was too
lyise a man to love fighting for the sake of jfo
that I kneyr his lord was braye epough by what
he had s^wed already; but that his lord kney
better than to desire to have seventeen or eighteen
men' fight five hundred, unless an unavoidable
necessity forced them to it; and that if he thought
it possible for us to escape in the night, we had
nothing else to do but to attempt it. He an-
swered, if his lord gave him such order, he would
lose his life if he did not perform it. We soon
brought his lord to give that order, though pri-
vately, and we immediately prepared for the put-
ting it in practice.
And first, a[s soon as it began to be dark, we
kindled a fire in our little camp, which we kept
burning, and prepared so as to make it burn all
night, that the Tartars might conclude we were
still there; but, as soon as it was dark, that is to
say, as we could see the stars, (for our guide
would not stir before) having all our horses and
camels ready loaded, we followed our new gukle3
tvho, I soon found, steered himself by the pole,
or north star, all the country being level for a long
way.
After we had travelled two hours very hard, it
began to be lighter still; not that it was quite
datk all night,' but the moon began to rise, so
that, in short, it was rather lighter than we
wished it to be; but by six o'clock next morn-
ingwe were gotten near forty miles, though the
truth is, we almost spoiled our horses. Here w$
found a Russian village, named Kirmazinskoy,
where we rested, and heard; nothing of tlie Caf-
ifiu£k Tartars that day. K About two hours before
night \V6 set out a;gain, and' travelled'till eight the
next morning, though not quite so hastily as be-
fore; and about seven o'clock we passed a little
river, called Kirtza, and came to a good large
town inhabited by Russians, and very populous,
called Ozomys. There we heard, that several
troops, or herds of Calmucks had been abroad-
upon the desert, but that we were now completely
out of danger of them, which-was to our great sa*
tisfac-tion, you may be sure. Here we were ob-
liged to get some fresh horses, and having need
enough of rest,-we staid five days; and my partner
and I agreed to give the honest Siberian, \vl\6
brought us hither, the value of ten pistoles for his
conducting us.
In five days more we came to Veussima, upon
the river Witzogda, which running into the river
Dwina, we were there very happily near the end
of our travels by land, that river being navigable
in seven days passage to Arch-Angel: from hence
we came to Lawrenskoy, where the river joins, the
third of July; and provided ourselves with two
•luggage-boats, and a barge, for our convenience*
We embarked the seventh, and arrived all safe at
Arch-Angel the eighteenth, having been a year,
five months, and three days on the journey, in-
cluding our stay of eight months and odd days at
Tobolskh
We were obliged to stay at this place six weeks
for the arrival of the ships, and must have tarried
longer, had not a Hamburgher come in above a
month sooner than any of the English ships; when,
after some consideration, that the city of Ham-
burgh might happen to,hr as good a market for
our goods as London, we all took freight with

LIFE
DANIEL DE FOE.
Bit
GEOE^E CHAFERS, ESQ.
3 0 2
The ensuing Life was written for amuse-
ment, during a period of convalescence in
1785; and published anonymously by Stock-
dale, before ' The History of the Union/ in
1786. As the Author fears no reproach for
such amusement, during such a period, he
made no strong objections to Sloekdale's soli-
citations, that it might be annexed, with
the Author's name, to this splendid edition
of Robinson Crusoe.
LIFE OF DE FOE.
It is lamented by those who labour the fields of
British biography, that after being entangled in
briers they are often rewarded with the scanty
products of barrenness. The lives of literary men
are generally passed in the obscurities of the clo-
set, which conceal even from friendly inquiries
the artifices t>f study, whereby each may have
risen to eminence. And during the same moment
that the diligent biographer sets out to ask for in-
formation, with regard to the origin, the modes of
life, or the various fortunes of writers who have
amused or instructed their country, the house-
keeper, the daughter, or grandchild, that knew
connexions and traditions, drop into the grave.
These reflexions naturally arose from my in-
quiries about the life of the Author of ' The His-
tory of the Union of Great Britain;' and of < The
Adventures of Robinson Crusoe/ Whether he
were born on the neighbouring continent, or in
this island; in London, or in the country; was
equally uncertain. And whether his name were
Foe, or De Foe, was somewhat doubtful. Like
384 THE IIFfe OV BE FOE.
Swift, he had perhaps reasons for concealing whkt'
would have added little to his consequence. It is
at length known, with sufficient certainty, that
our author was the son of James Foe, of the parish
of St. Giles's, Cripplegate, London, Citizen and
Butcher. * The concluding sentiment * of ' The
True-born Englishman/ we now see, was then ats
natural as it will be just.'
Then, let us boast of ancestors no more.
For, fame of families is all a cheat;
Tis personal virtue only makes us great.
£f we m^y credit th,e Gazette, Daniel Foe, or
De Foe, as he is said by his enemies to have called
himself that he might not be thought an English-
man, was born in London,* about |:he year^&6§\
His family were probably Dissenters, f amo>ng
* It is at last discovered,,by searching The Chamberlain's books,
which have since been burnt, that our 'author was the son of
James Foe, of the parish of Cripplegate, London, Citizen and
Butcher; Vho was himself the son of Daniel Foe, oflfclton, lathe
county of Northampton, Yeoman 5 and who obtained *h» Freedom
by scrying his apprenticeship with John Levit, Citizen and But-
cher. Daniel Foe, the son of James, was admitted to his Freedom
by birth, on the 26th of January, 1687-8. f was led td these dis-
coveries by observing that De Foe had voted at an election for a
Representative of London^ wheneeU inferred, that he must have
been a citizen either by birth or service. But in the parish books
I could find no notice of his baptism 3 as his parents were Dis-
senters.

De Foe was born a writer, as other men are
born geneials and statesmen; and when he was
not twenty-one, he published, in 1683, a pam-
phlet against a very prevailing sentiment in favojur
of the Turks, as opposed to the Austrians; v^ry
justly thinking, as he avows in his riper age, that
it was better the Popish House of Austria should
ruin the Protestants in Hungary, than the infidel
House of Ottoman should ruin both Protestants
and Papists, by overrunning Germany.* De Foe
was a man who would fight as well as write for
his principles; and before he was three-and-twenty
he appeared in arms for the Duke of Monmouth,
in June 1685. (Of this exploit he boastsf in his
latter years, when it was no longer dangerous to
avow his participation in that, imprudent enter-
prise, with greater men of similar principles.
Having escaped from the dangers, of battle, and
from the fangs of Jefferys, De Foe found complete
security in the more gainful pursuits of peace.
Yet, he was prompted by his zeal to mingle in the
controversies of the reign of Jame$ II. whom he
' efficaciously opposed* by warning the dissenters of
/the secret danger of the insidious tolerance, which
Was offered by the monarch's bigotry, or by the
minister's aitifice. When o_iir Author collected his
writings, he did not think proper to republish ei-
ther his tract against .the Turks, or his pamphlet
against the King.
» De Foe was admitted a Liveryman of London
on the 26th of January, l#87-8; when, being al-

Itfw^ft'his freedom by biith, he was received a
frifcnibertff that eminent corporation. As he had
efedeaVoured to promote the revolution by his pen
and his sword, he had the satisfaction of partaking,
^e long, *in the pleasures and advantages of that
great event During the hilarity of that moment,
{the Lord Mayor of London asked King William to
partake of the city feast on the ££th cf October,
16S9. Every honour was paid the Sovereign of
~the people's choice, A regiment of volunteers,
Composed of the chief eitizens, and commanded
^ly the celebrated Earl of Peterborough, attended
the King and Queen from Whitehall to the Man-
sion House. Among these troopers, gallantly
mounted, and richly accoutred, was Daniel De Eoe,
if we may believe OldmixonJ* ?
While our author thus displayed his zeal, and
courted notiee, he is said to have acted as a hosier
in Freeman's Yard, Cornhilh but the hosierf" and
the poet are very irreconcileable characters, i With
the usual imprudettce of superior genius, he was
carried by his vivacity into companies who were
gratified by hfe wit. He spent those hours with* a
small society for the cultivation of polite learoitjg,
which he ought to have employed in the calcula-

f Being reproached by Tutchiriia his « Observ^tor' with having
been bred an apprentice to a hosier, De Foe asserts., in May 1/Q5,
that he nevei was a hosier, or an ^prentice, but admits that he
had been a Trader. [Review, vol. ii. p. 149 1 Oidmixon, who

tions of the counting-house* and being obligedrtof
abscond from his creditors in KSgfl, he naturally
attributed those misfortunes to thenvar, whkh Tirer®
probably owing to his own misconduct.) An^an-
gry creditor took out ia commission of bankruptcy;
which toassoqn superseded on the petition of those
to whoinrhe was most indebted, who accepted a
composition on his single bond. This he punctu-
ally paid by~the> efforts,'of unwearied diligence*
But some of those creditors, who had been thus
satisfied,^ailing afterwards into distress themselves,
De Foe voluntarily'^paid them their whole claims5
being then in rising circumstances from1 King
Wiiliafri's favour.5** This is $uch<an example of ho*
nestyr as it would be- unju&t to Dei Foe and to the
world to conceal. Being reproached inT 4705'toy
Lord Haversham with hmercenari mess, onr author
feelingly, mentions; " Howv with a > numerous fa<*
mily, and no helps but his own industry, he had
forced.,his * way with undiscouraged dibgence,

did not, like the Egyptians, require bricks without

ced no great nran by his satire, 'or offended any
party by ,bis< pamphlets, he-had?acquired friends
by his powers of pleasing, who -did not, with
the usual instability of friendships, desert him
amidst his distresses. They offered to settle him
ast a» factor at Cadiz, where, as a trader, he had
spme previo is correspondence.- In this situation
he might have procured business by his care, land
accumulated wealth without a risque; but, as her
assures lis in his old age, Providence which tad
other work for him to do, placed a secret aversion
in his mind to q<uittif*g England.. «Ue had ctinfi*-

tlys field he could gather laurels,  or at least gain

In a projecting^age, as our Author denominates
King William Vreign, *he was himself a projector.
While he was yet youngs I>e Foe was prompted
by a vigorous* mind to think of many schemes* and.
to offer, what w<*sf most pleasing to the ruling
powers, ways and means for carrying on the war.
He wrote, as he says, many sheets about the coin;
be proposed a register for seamen* long before the
aet of Parliament was* thought of; he projected
county banks and factories for goods; he men-
tioned a proposal for a commission of inquiries
into bankrupts' estates; be contrived a pension-
office for the relief of the poor. At length, in Ja-
nuary 1696-7, he published his li Essay upon Pro-
390 THE LIFE O^'bfc F0&
jects;' which fie dedicated to Palby Thomas^ not as
a commissioner of glass duties, under \vhomffhe
then served, or as a friend, to whom he acknow-
ledges obligations; but as to the most proper
jtidge on the subject. It is always curious to trace
a thought, in order to see Where it first originated,
or how it was afterwards expanded. Among other
projects, which shew a wide range of knowledge^
he suggests to King William the imitation of
Lewis 14th, in the establishment of a society " for
encouraging polite learning, for lefining the En-
glish language, and for preventing barbarisms 6JT
manners/' Prior offeied in 1700 the same project
fo King William, in his < Carmen Seculare/ Swift
fti^ntfoned in 1710 to Lord Oxford a proposal for
improving the English tongue; and Tickell flatters
himself in his ' Prospect of Peace/ that our daring
language—cshall sport no morein arbitrary sound/'
However his projects were taken, certain it is, tlxat
when De Foe ceased to be a trader, he was, by the
interposition of Dafby Thomas probably, appointed
in 1695, accomptant to the Commissioners for
managing the duties on glass; who, with our
Author, ceased to act, on the first of August, 1699,
when the tax was suppressed by act of Parliament.*
From projects of ivays and means, De Foe's ar-
dour soon carried him into the thorny paths of sa-
tiric poetry; and his muse pioduced, in January
1700-1, « The true-borrt Englishman/ Of the
origin of this satire, which was the cause of much
-good fortune, but of some disasters, he gives him-
<*'io-MWmMi.{ch}U
self the following account.—" Duiing this time
came out an abhorred pamphlet, in veiy ill veise,
written by one Mr. Tutchin, and called * The Fo-
reigners : in which the Author, who he was I then
knew not, fell personally upon the King, then upon
the Dutch nation, and, after having repioached
his Majesty with crimes that his wrorst enemies
could not think of without honoiv he sums up all
in the odious name of Foreigner. This filled me
with a kind of rage against the book, and gave
birth to a trifle, which I never could hope should
have met with so general an acceptation," The
sale wras prodigious, and probably unexampled; as
§acheverers trial had jipt then appeared. ' The
True-born Englishman*', was, answered, paragraph
by paragraph, in February 1700-1, by a writer*
who brings haste to apologize for dulness. For
t&is Defence of King William and the Dutch,
which was doubtless circulated by detraction and
By; power, De Foe was amply rewarded. * How
tjhis poem was the occasion,' says he, * of my be-
ing known to his Majesty; how I was afterwards
received by him; how employed abroad; and how,
above my capacity of deserving, rewaided, is no
jjatt of the present case.' Of the particulars,
which the Author thus declined to tell, nothing
now can be told. It is only certain, that he was
admitted to personal interviews with the King,
who was no reader of poetry; ^nd that for the
rpyal favours De Foe was always grateful.

very rational to suppose," says our Author, ^ that
they who will buy will sell; or, what seemamore
rational, they who have bought must sell/' This
is certainly a persuasive performance, though we
may suppose, that many voters were influenced
theij by arguments still more persuasive. And he
concludes with a sentiment, which has not been
too often repeated, that nothing can make us for-
midable to our neighbours, and maintain the repu-
tation of our nation, but union among ourselves. 
How,much soever King William may have been
pleasfed with* TheTrue-bom Englishman^' or with
Other services, he >was little gratified probably by
our Author's * Reasons against a war with France/
This argument, shewing that the*French King's
owning the Prince of Wales as King of England,
is no sufficient ground of War, is one of the finest,
becauseit is-one of the most useful,* tracts in the
English languagev After remarking the universal
cry of thef4>e£ple fot war, our Author declares he
is not against war with^ France,, provided it b&xm

<&t*rpwis hostilities hi remote places, where th6
d&thage may bfc greater, by pounding the Spaniard
itf sohie wfc&fcer part-; so as upon a peace he shall
be glad to quit Flanders for an equivalent" Who
at present does not wish that De Foe's argument
had been more studiously read, and more efficaci-
ously admitted?
A scene of sorrow soon after opened, which
probably embittered our Author's future life. The
death < of King William f deprived him of a pro-
tector, who, he says, traisted, esteemed/ and mttfcli
more valued him than he deserved; and who, as M
flattered himself amidst his later distresses/would
never have suffered him to be treated as he had
been in the world, Of that monarchV memory, he
says, that he never patiently heard it abused; im
evfcr could doso : *and in this-gratitude to >a roy&l
benefactor there is surely much to - praise, but
nothing to blame.
1 In thfc midst of that furious contest of ;p*rty?
civil and religious, which ensued on the acaces^
sion of Queen Anne, our Author was noimcofi-
cerned spectator. He Teprinted his *, Itiquiiy
into the Occasional Conformity of Dissenters/

geeiafeSv h&ve n#t penetrated Into the real design;
the Author presents the1 World With the genuine
meaning of the paper, which hi hopes may allay
the anger of Government, or at least satisfy the
minds of such as imagine a design to inflame and
divide us." Neither his submissiveness to the
ruling powers, nor his generosity to his printers,
was a sufficient shield from the resentment of his
enemies. He was found guilty of a libel, sentenced
to the pillory, and adjudged to be fined and impri-
soned. Thus, as he acknowledges, was he a second
time ruined; and by this affair, as he asserts, he
lost above d£3,500 sterling, which consisted pro-
bably in his brick \vorks and in the more abundant
product of his pen.
When, by these means, immured in Newgate,
our Author consoled himself with the animating
reflection, that having meant well he unjustly
suffered. He had a mind too active to beidiein
the'solitude of a prison which i3 seldom invaded
by.visitors. -And he Avrote^a hymn to the piHory^

He employed this involuntary leisure in correct-
ing for the press a collection of his writings, which,
with several things he had no hand in, had been
already published by a piratical printer. He thought
it a most unaccountable boldness in him to print
that particular book called ' The Shortest Way
with the Dissenters/ while he lay under the public
resentment for the same fact In this collection
of 1?03, there are one-and-twenty treatises in poe-
try and prose, beginning with c The true-bom
Englishman/ and ending with ' The Shortest Way
to Peace and Union/ To this volume there was
prefixed the first print of De Foe; to which was
afterwards added, the apt inscription : Laudatur
et alget.
In the solitariness of a gaol, the energy of De
Foe projected ' The Review.' This is a periodical
paper in quarto, which was first published on the
lyth of February, 1703-4; and which was intended
to treat of news, foreign and domestic; of politics,
British and European; of trade, particular and
universal But our Author foresaw, from the
natural aversion of the age to any tedious affair,
that however profitable, the world would never
read, if it were not diverting. With this de-
sign, both instructive and amusing, he skilfully
institutes a Scandal Club, which discusses ques-
tions in divinity, morals, war, trade, language,
poetry, love, marriage, drunkenness, and gaming.
Tta*, it is easy to'see, that' The Review * pointed
the way to tise^Cfttiers, Spectators, and Guardians,
which may be allowed hmt&v&t to have treated
t|*Qse interesting topics with more delicacy of
hutnour, m&ve terseness of style, and greater depth
of leading; yet, has De Foe many passages, both
of prose and poetry* which, for refinement^ wit-
neatness ofexpression, and efficacy of moral* would
dabonourto Steele or to Addison. Of.aJI this
was Joteson unconscious, when h£ speaks of-tbe

tjaper, however obnokfous to' a%y party, may tra-
vel peaceably about his affairs over England, with-
out fear of interruption. Were a justice of peace,
from whatever motive, to offer him any obstruc-
tion, such a magistrate would be overwhelmed by
the public indignation, and punished by the higher
guardians of our quiet and our laws.
De Foe began the year 1706 with c A I-fyrrm to
Peace;'* occasioned by the two'Houses of Parlia-
ment joining in one address to the Queen. Oil
the 4th of May he published (An Essay at remov-
ing National Prejudices against an Union with
Scotland.' A few weeks after he gave the v/oild a
second essay, to soften rancour and defeat perver-
sity. But the time was now come, when he was
to perform what he had often piomised: ai:dhis
fruitfulness produced in July 1706, ' Juie Diviuo/
a satire against tyranny and passive obedience,
which had been delayed, for fear, as he declares,
of parliamentary censure. Of this poem, it cannot
be said, as of Thomson's ( Liberty/ that it was
written to prove what no man ever denied. This
satire, says the preface, had never been published,
though some of it has been a long time in being,
had not the world seemed to be going mad a se-
cond time with the error of passive obedience, and
non-resistance. And because some men require,
says he, more explicit answers, I declare my he-
lief, that a monarchy, according to the present con-
stitution, limited by Parliament, and dependant
upon lawr, is not only the best government in the

the circumstances of the whole body. Dryden
had given an example, a few years before, of argu-
mentative rpoetry }n his 4 Hipd and rapther;' by
which he endeavoured to defend the tenets of the
Church of Rome. Our author now reasoned in
rhyme, through twelve books, in defence of every
man's birthright by nature, when all sorts of li-
berty were rijn down and opposed. His purpose
is doubtless honester than Dry den's; and his argu-
ment, being in support of the better cause, is per-
haps superior in strength: bij.t in the 'Jure Di-

at Edinburo\ m October 1706. And we .shall
find him pq inconsiderable aetoi? jn the perform-
ance of that greyest of all good works. He at-
"tended the committees of jpafliament, for w lose
use he made several of the calculations * on the
subject of trade and taxes. He eomplains,f how-
eve^ that, when afterwards some clamour was
raised upon the inequality of the proportions, and
the contrivers began to be blamed, and a little
threatened a-la-mob, then it was D. F. % made it
all, and he was to be stoned for it. He endea-
voured to confute § all that was published by Web-
ster, and Hodges, and the other writers in Scot-
land against the Union: and he had his share of
danger, since, as he says, he was watched by
the mob; had his -chamber windows insulted;
but, by the prudence of his friends, and God's
providence, he escaped.j| In the mrdst~ of Jthis
great scene of business and tumult* he collected
^the documents which he afterwards published for
the instruction of posterity, with regard to oneJof
the most difficult, and, at the same time, themtast
fortunate, transactions, in our annals. \ r .»
During ali those labours and risques, De-Foe
published, in December 1706, ' Caledonia,5 a P$e©;

which was intended to rescue Scotland from slan-
der in opinion, Caledonia herself bade him dedicate
to the Duke of Queensberry. Beside other bene-
factions, the Commissioner gave the author,
whom he calls Daniel De Foe/ Esquire, an exclu-
sive privilege to sell his encomiastic strains for se-
ven years, within the country of his celebration.
Amidst our Author's busy occupations at Edin-
burgh, he was anxious to assure the world, that
wherever the writer may be, the Reviews are
written with his own.hand; no person having, or
ever had, any concern in writing them, but the
known author, D. F. On the 16th of January,
the act of Union was passed by the Scots Parlia-
ment; and De Foe returned to London, in Fe-
bruary 1706-7. While he thus acted importantly
at Edinburgh, he formed connexions with con-
siderable persons, who were proud of his future
correspondence, and profited from his political in-
terests*
* Lord JBuchan was so obliging as to communicate the subjoined
extract of a letter to his Lordship's grandfather, the Earl of
Buchan, from Dc Foe, dated the 2.9th of May, 1711.—< The per-
son, with whom I endeavoured to plant the interest of your Lord-
ship's fticud, has been strangely taken up, since I had that occa-
sion 3 viz. first, in suffering the operation of the surgeons to heal
~ the wound of the assassin 3 and since, in accumulating honours
from Parliament, the Queen, and the people. On Thursday
, evening her Majesty created him Earl Mortimer, Earl of Oxford,
and Lord Harley of Wigmore : and we expect that to-morrow in
council he will have the white staff given him. by the Queen, and
be declared Lord High Treasurer. I wrote this yesterday; and
this day, May the 29th, he is made Lord High Treasurer of
Great Britain, and carried the white staff before the Queen this
morning to chapel.
How our Author was rewarded by the ministers
who derived a benefit from those services, and
from that danger, as he does not tell, cannot now
be known. Before his departure for Scotland,
indeed, Lord Godolphi n, as he acknowledges/"
obtained for him the continuance of an appointment,
which her Majesty, by the interposition of his first
benefactor, had been pleased to make him, in con-
sideration of a former service, in a foreign country,
wherein he run as much risque as a grenadier on
the counter-scarp. As he was too prudent to dis-
close his secret services, they must at present re-
remain undiscovered. Yet is there reason to think
that he had a pension rather than an office, since his
name is net in the red book of the Queen ; and he
solemnly avers, in his Appeal, that he had not in-
terest enough with Lord Oxford to procure him the
arrears due to him in the time of the former Mini-
stry. This appointment, whatever it were, he is
studious to tell, he originally owed to Harley: he,
however, thankfully acknowledges, that Lord Go-
dolphin continued his favour to him after the un-
happy breach that separated his first benefactor
from the Minister, who 'continued^ in power till
August, 1710.
The nation, which was filled with combustible
matter, burst into flame the moment of that memo-
rable separation, in 1707. In the midst of this
conflagration our Author was not inactive. He
waited on Harley after he had been driven from
power, who generously advised him to continue
* Appeal, p. Id.
his services to the Queen, which he supposed
would have no relation to personal differences 1
among- statesmen. Godolphin received him with
usual kindness, by saying—* I always think a man
honest till I find to the contrary.' And if we may
credit De Foe's asseverations, in the presence of1
those Who could have convicted him of falsehood,
he for three years held no correspondence with his
principal benefactor, which the great man never
tciok ill of" him. "
-As early as February 1706-7, De Foe avowed
his purpose to publish the ' History of the Union/
which-he* had ably assisted to accomplish. This !
design he executed in I70,f, though he Was engaged
in other"lucubrations, and gave the world a Review-
three times a week. His history seems to have
been little notided when it first appeared; for, as
the preface states, it had many difficulties in
the way; many factions' to encounter, and parties
to'please. Ytt it was republished in 1712; and a
third time in 1786, when a similar union had be-
cottfe the topic of public debate and private con-
ve?4£tibn.'' TKe subject of this work is the com-
pletadh ofu measure, which was Carried into effect
notwithstanding obstructions apparently insur-
mountable, and tumults approaching to rebellion,
arid'Which has produced the ends designed, beyond
exptectStibtr, Whether We consider its influence on,
the government, bi^its operation on the governed.

sawMd' hea^dom the turbiileht stage, ydiere he
actedl (a cbiis^icuOus part, is extremely interesting '
tovtifc,J whb wish td Icn^W wh^t ictUally passe^,'
however this circumstantiality may have disgusted
contemporaneous readers. History is chiefly valu-
able as it transmits a faithful copy of the manners
and sentiments of every age. 1 his narrative of De
Foe is a drama, in which he introduces the highest
peers and the lowest peasants, speaking and acting
according as they were each actuated by their
characteristic passions; and while the man of taste
is amused by his manner, the man of business may
draw instruction from the documents, which are
appended to the end, and interspersed in every
page. This publication had alone preserved his
name, had his Crusoe pleased us less.
De Foe published in 1709, what indeed required
less effort of the intellect or the hand, * The His-
tory of Addresses;'.with no design^ he says, and as
we may believe, to disturb the public peace, but
to compare the.present tempers of men with the ,
past, in order to discover who had altered far. the-
better' and who for the worse. He gave a second
volume of Addresses in J7J1, with remarks serious^,
antl comical ^Jfis pu/pose plainly was to abate,,
by ridicule, the public fervour with regard to ,
Sacheverel, who, by I know not what fatality, or
folly, gave rise to eventful changes. De Fog
evinces, by these timeful publications,that amidst c
all that enthusiasm arid ^tumult, he preservecLhis.
senses, and adhered to(hisprinciples.
When, by such in^riidp^ce asjhe, world had
never seen before, GodoJpiyu4\v;asi ii^hiatjurn ex- ^
pelled, in August 1710,, o^^uthor, .waited on the
ex-minister j (^hpv ob]jgingty .sauj ffj, liim?tcNVTl^t^
he had the same good-will, but not the same
power to assist him:' and Godolphin told him,
what was of more real use—to receive the
Queen's commands from her confidential ser-
vants, when he saw things settled. It natu-
rally occurred to De Foe, that it was his duty
to go along with the ministers, while, as he says*
they did not break in on the constitution. And
who can blame a very subordinate officer, (if indeed
he held an officey) who had a wife and six children
to maintain with very precarious means? He was
thus, says he, ' cast back providentially on his
first benefactor, who laid his case before her Ma-
jesty> whereby lie preserved his interest, without
amy eogageincBt. On that memorable change De
Foe however somewhat changed his tone. The
method I shall take, says he,* in talking of the

De Foe now lived at Newington, in cotnfortable
circumstances, publishing ' The4 Reviews,' and
sending out such tracts, as either gratified his pre-
judices, or ^supplied his needs. During that con-
ten tiousperiod he naturally gaveand received many
wounds; and he prudently entered into a truce
with Mr. J. Dyer, who was engaged in similar o<£
cnp&jdons, that however they might clash in party,

had then much to think of, and much to do at a
distance: and he soon after gave some support to
Lord Oxford's South-sea project, by publishing
* Aa Essay on the South-sea Trade/ with an inquiry
into the 'reasons of the present complaint against
the settlement of the South-sea Company. In the
same year he published ' An Essay at a plain Expo*,

The treaty at Utrecht furnishes a memorable ex-
ample of this. T*h« furious debates which ensued
within the Walfe of Parliament and without, ar&
sufficiently remembered. About this time, says

promoted Lord Oxford's views, and which, there*
fore, gaitied little of his favour. Our Author wrote
against the peace of Utrecht, because he approved
of it as little as he had done ttte treaty at Gertruy*
denburgh, under very different influences, a few
years before. The peace he was for, afc fie liitnself
says, was such as should neither have given the
Spanish monarchy to the house of Bourbon, not
to the house of Austria; but that this bone of con*
tention should have been so broken to pieces, as
that it should not have been dangerous to Eurapej
£nd that England and Holland should have to
strengthend themselves, by sharing its commerce
as should have made them no more afraid of Franc£#
orthe Emper6r; and thtftrall that we should coi^-
qqer in the Spanish West Indies shouTd be our
own. But it is equally trtfe, he affirms, that when
the peace was established,' I thought our business
was to make the best of it; and rather to itiqUhte What
improvements could be made of it, than to be con-
tinually exclaiming against those who procured it/
He manfully avowed his opinion in 1715, when
ijt was both disgraceful and tlangerous, that the
9th aiticle of the Treaty of Oofrifnefce Was calcu-
lated for the advantage 'of oiir trade; i Let *who
will make it, that,"say& h^,' is nothing to me. "My
reasons are, because it tied up the French to open
the door to our manufactures, at a certain duty of
importatibn th^e; aticl left tTie parliament of Bri-
tain at liberty to slftW ttitWk <kfc, 'by as hi£h diittes
as they pleased here, there being no limitation
upon ufc, as to duties" &H French goods^but that
other nations should pay the same. While the
J^^h?fwei$ thus bound,, a»d the British free, J
^^ysthought we must he in a couditiou to trade
ta advantage, or it must bp our own fault; this
waa^ny opinion, £nd is so still; and I would engage
%o maintain it against any man, on a public stage,
before a jury of fifty merchants, and venture my
life upon the cause, if I were assured of fair play
ip the dispute. But, that it was my opinion, we
might carry on a trade with France to our great
advantage, and that we ought for that reason to
trade with them, appears in the third, fourth, fifth,
and sixth volumes of < The Reviews/ above nine
years before ' The Mercator,' was thought of.
Experience has decided in favour of De Foe against
his opponents, with regard both to the theory and
the practice of commerce.
In May 1713, our Author relinquished the 'Re-
view,' after nine years continuance: in Newgate
it began, and in Newgate it ended. Whether w;e
consider the frequency of the publication^ or the
power of his disquisitions, the pertinacity of h&
opponents, or the address of his defences, &mid
other studies, without assistants, this must be
allowed to be such a work, as few of our writers
have equalled. Yet, of this great performance, said
Gay, * The poor Review' is qui^e exhausted, and
grown so very conten^hje, that though he has
provoked all his bi&theis of tl?e quill, none will
enter into a controversy y&ph ,hw. TThe fellow,

to be destroyed, if it must remain with France;
but, if it were added to England, or made a fiee-
port, it would be for the good of mankind to have
a safe harbour in such dangerous seas. This His-
tory of Trade, which exhibits the ingenuity, the
strength, and the piety of De Foe, extended only
to twcUJnumbers. The agitations of the tinier
carried Mm^to other literary pursuits; and the
factiousness of the times constrained him to attend
ta personal security. c While I spoke of things
thus/ says our Author, * I bore infinite reproaches,
as the defender of the peace, by pamphlets, which
I hadno hand in.' He appears to have beensilenced
by noise, obloquy, and insailt; and finding himself
ifrjthis manner treated, he declined writing at all*
ast he assures us; and for great part of a year never
s£t pen to papeiy except in ' The Reviews/ 'After
this,' continues he, M was a long time absent in
the north of England,' though we may easily infer,
for a very different reason than that of the famous
i^tireroQnt of Swift* upon the final breach between
Qxford and Bolingbroke.

prosecution was instituted by the absurd zeal of
William Benson, who afterwards became ridicu-
lously famous for literary exploits, which justly
raised him to the honours of the Dunciad. Our
Author attributes this prosecution to the malice of
his enemies, who were numerous and powerful.
No inconsiderable people were heard to say, that
they knew the books were against the Pretender,
but that De Foe had disobliged them in othet
things, and they resolved to take this advantage to
punish him. This story is the more credible, as he
had procured evidence to prove the fact, had the
trial proceeded. He was prompted by conscious-
ness of innocence to defend himself in the ' Review
during the prosecution, which offended the judges,
who, being somewhat infected with the violent spi-
rit of the times, committed him to Newgate in
Easter term 1713. He was however soon released
on making a proper submission. But it was happy
for De Foe that his first benefactor was still in.

November** 1713. This act of liberal justice was
produced by the party-writers f of those black and
bitter days, as an additional proof of Lord Ox-
ford's attachment to the abdicated family, while
De Foe was said to be convicted of absolute Jaco-
bitism, contrary to the tenor of his life, and the
purpose of his writings. He himself said sarcasti-
cally, that they might as well have made him a

was revived, rather by Roberts the bookseller,
than by De Foe the Author.* But the pei sedi-
tions of party did not cease when De Foe ceased
to be a party-writer. He Avas insulted by Boyer,
in April 17if>, as the author of ' The Triennial
Act impartially stated:' ' but, whatever was offer-
ed/ says Boyer, ' against the Septennial Bill, was
fitly confuted by the ingenious and judicious Jo*
^eph Addison, Esquire.' Whether De Foe wrote
iW defence of the people's rights, or in support of
the law's authority, he is to be censured: whether
Addison defended the Septennial Bill, or the Peer-
age Bill, lie is to be praised. With the same mis-
conception of the fact, and malignancy of spirit,
Tolland reviled f De Foe for waiting an answer to

and children; 2d, to masters and servants; <3d, .to
husbands and wives. He carefully concealed his
authorship, lest the good effects of his labour
should be obstructed by the great imperfections
of the writer. The world was 'then too busy to
look immediately into the work.' The bookseller
soon procured a recommendatory letter from the
Reverend Satniiei Wright, a well-known preacher
in the Black-Friars. It was praised from the pul-
pit and the press: and the utility of the end, with
the attractiveness of the execution, gave it, at
length, a general reception.* The Author's first
design was to write a * Dramatic Poem;' but the
subject was too solemn, and the text too copious,
to'admit of restraint, or to allow excursions. His
purpose was to divert and instruct, at the same
moment; and by giving it a dramatic form, it has
been called by some * A religious play/ De Foe
at last says with his usual archness: 'As to its be
ing called a play, be it called so, if they please: it
must be confessed, some parts of it are too much
acted'in many families among us.' The Author
wishes, that either all our plays were as useful for
the improvement and entertainment of the world,
©V that they were less encouraged* There is, I
think, some mysticism in the preface, which, it
;* The family of George T.J)had' been instructed by the copy of
ihjs book, which' is' ini( The1 Museum.'' It would seem from tfee
fide page of Mr*. ^Wright'd letter befog 'printed on a different paper
tfvom the work itself, that, .both, were added after the first publica-
tion.' /.The, Family Insirpctor/ and Mr. .Wright'sletter were en-
tered at Stationers' Hall, for Emanuel Mathews, on the 31st of
were to be desired, a judicious hand would ex-
punge, when ' The Family Instructor' shall be
again reprinted; for, reprinted it will be, while
our language endures; at least, while wise men
shall continue to consider the influences of religion
and the practice of morals as of the greatest use
to society6
De Foe afterwards added a second volume, iq
two parts; 1st, relating to Family Breaches; 2dly,
to the great Mistake, of mixing the Passions in
the managing of Children. He considered it, in-
deed, as a bold adventure to write a second volume
of any thing; there being a general opinion
among modern readers, that second parts never
came up to the spirit of the first He quotes Mr.
Milton, for differing from the world upon the
question, and for affirming with regard to his own
great performances, That the people had a gene-
ral sense of the loss of Paradise, but not an equal
gust for regaining it. Of De Foe's second volume,
it will he easily allowed, that it is as instructive
and pleasing as the first. His ' Religious Court-
ship/ which he published in 1722, may properly
be considered as a third volume. For the desigu
is equally moral, the manner is equally attractive!,
and it may in the same manner be called a ' Reli-
gious Pi-ay/
But the time at length came, when De Foe was
to deliver to the world the most popular of all his
performances. In April 17J9» he published the
well-known 4 Life and surprising'Adventures of
Robinson Crusoe.' The reception Was immediate
and universal; and Taylor who purchase^ the 1114-
nuscript, after every bookseller had refused it, is
said to have gained a thousand pounds* If it be
inquired by what charm it is that these surprising
adventures should have instantly pleased, and air-
ways pleased, it will be found, that few books
have ever so naturally mingled amusement with
instruction. The attention is fixed, either by the
simplicity of the narration, or by the variety of
the incidents; the heart is amended by a vindica-
tion of the ways of God to man; and the under-
standing is infoimed, by various examples, how
much utility ought to be pi\fened to ornament:
the young are instructed, while the old aie amused*
Robinson Crusoe had scarcely drawn his c&m3e
ashore, when he was attacked by his old enemies,
the savages. He was assailed first by 4 The I/ife
and strange Adventures of Mr. D^ De F—, pf
London, Hosier, who has lived above Fifty Y$$gs
by himself in the Kingdoms of North and South
^Britain.' In a dull dialogue between De Foe, Cru-
soe, and his man Fiiday, our Author's life is lam-
pooned, and his misfortunes lidiculed. But he
who had been struck by apopleKy, and who was
jimw discountenanced by power, was no fit object
of an Englishman's satire* Our Author declares,
when he wa$ himself a writer of satiiic poetry,
6 that he never reproached any man for his private

cast away, ox hj$ family ruined; nor had he ever

Author's infirmities were greater and his comfort
less. He was again assaulted in 1719, by 'An
Epistle to D De F—, the reputed Author of
Robinson Crusoe.' * Mr. Foe,' say* the letter-
writer, «I have perused your pleasant story of * Ro-
binson Crusoe; and if the faults of it had extend-
ed fro further than the frequent solecisms and in-
correctness of style, improbabilities, and some-
times impossibitres, I had not given the trouble
<©# this Epistle.' ' Yet,' said Johnson to Piozzi>
^was there ever any thing written b}' mere man,
that was wished longer by its readers, except * Don
Quixote,' ' Robinson Crusoe;' and the *• Pilgrim's
Progress?' This epistolary critic, who renewed his
ktogry attack when the second volume ^ppeated,
has all the dulness, without the aeumetvof Dennis,
^ind aM his malignity, without his purpose of re-
formation. The Life of Crusoe has passed through
iiin-umerable editions, and has been translated into
fiweign languages, While the criticism sunk into
>obfiv<ibn. r
'De'Foe set the* critics at de6ance while'he had
ih6 people on his side. As a commercial legislator
he knew, fch&t k is-iapid sale which is the great
incentive: and, in August 1719, lie published a
second volume of4 Surprising Adventures,5 with si-
milar success, In hope of profit aftd of praise, he

He however did not advefFt, that instruction must
be insinuated rather than enforoed. That thb third
volume has more morality than fable, is the cause,
I fear, that it has never been read with the same
avidity as the former two, or spoken of with the
s&me approbation. We all prefer amusement to
instruction; and he who would inculcate useful
truths, tmist study to amuse, or he will offer his
lessons to an auditory, neither numerous, nor at-
tentive.
The tongue of detraction is seldom at reat. It
has often been repeated, that De Foe had surrep*
titioasly appropriated thepapers of Alexander Sel-
kirk, a Scotch mariner, who having lived solitarily
on the isle of Juan Fernandez, four years and
four months, was relieved on the second of Fe-
bruary, 17Q&-9, by Captain Wbodes Rogers, m
Ms cruiiaag voyage round the world* But let ao
one draw inferences till the fact be first ascertain-
ed. The adventures of Selkirk had been thrown
infeo the air, in 1712, for literary bawjss to de-
vour;* and De Foe may have catched a common
* The whole story of Selkirk is told in Woodes Roger's voyage,

ijt appears, that Selkirk had preseryed no pen, ink, or paper, and

lect, and distributed for the purpose -:. his interest.
Thus he may have fairly acquired the fundamen-
tal incident of Crusoe's life; hut lie did not bor-
row the various events, the useful moralities, or
the engaging style. Few men could write such a
poem; and few Selkjiks could iiiucate so pat! ,,u
an original. It was the happiness oi De Foe, .nu.t
as many writers have succeeded in relating enter-
prises by land, he excelled i, narrating adven-
tures by sea, with such felicities of language, such
attractive varieties, such insinuatr e instruction,
as have seldom been equalled, but never sur-
passed.
tale was told in the ' Memoirs of Literature/ 5. vol. p. 118: so that
the world was fully possessed of Selkirk's story in 3; 12, seven
years prior to the publication of Crusoe's ad\entures. Nor were
his adventures singular j for, Ringrose mentions, in his account of
Captain SlTarp's voyage, a person who had escaped singly from a
ship that had been wrecked on Juan Fernandez, and who lived
alone five years before he was relieved. And Dampier mentions a
Mosquito Indian, who having been accidentally left on this island,
subsisted three years solitarily, till that voyager carried him off.
From which of these De Foe borrowed his great incident, it is not
easy to discover. In the preface to c The Serious Reflections,' he
indeed says, ' That there.is a man. alive and well known, the ac-
tions of whose life are'the just subject of these volumes, and to
whom the most part of the story directly alludes.' This turns the
"scale in favour of Selkirk. Nor, w as the name of Crusoe wholly
fictitious: for, among De Foe's contemporaries John Dunton
speaks of Timothy Crusoe, who was called the Golden Preacher,
and was so great a textuary, that he could pray two hours together
* in scripture language j but he was not arrived at perfection; as ap-
peared by his sloth hi tying the conjugal knot: yet his repentance

De Foe published, hi 1722, ' A Journal of the
Plague in 166 *>.7 The Author's artifice consists in
fixing the reader's attention by the deep distress
of fellow-men; and, by recalling the reader's re-
collection to striking examples of mortality, he
endeavours to inculcate the uncertainty of lifeP
and the usefulness of reformation. In 1724, De
Foe published 'The great Law of Subordination.9
This is an admirable commentary on the 6 Unsuf-
ferable Behaviour of Servants,' Yet, though he in-
terest by his mode, inform by his facts, and con-
vince by his argument, he fails at last, by expect"
ing from law what must proceed from manners.
Our Author gave the c Political History of the
Devil/ in 1726. The matter and the mode con-
join to make this a charming performance. He
engages poetry and prose, reasoning and wit, per-
suasion and ridicule, on the side of religion and
morals, with wonderful efficacy. De Foe wrote a
system of magic in 17C26. This may be properly
regarded as a supplement to the c History of the
Devil.' His end and his execution are exactly the
same. He could see no great harm in the present
pretenders to magic, if the poor people would but
keep their money in their pockets; and that they
should have their pockets picked by such an un-
performing, unmeaning, ignorant crew as these
Sire, is the only magic De Foe could see in tl'ie
whole science. But the reader will discover in
our Author's system extensive erudition, salutary
remark, and useful satire. De Foe published in
1727, his < Treatise on the Use and Abuse of the
'Marriage-Bed7 The Author had begun this per-
formance thirty years before: he delayed the pub-
lication, though it had been long,finished, in hopes
of reformation. But being now grown old, and
out of the reach of scandal, and despairing of
amendment from a vicious age, he thought pro-
per to close his days with this satire lie appealed
to that Judge, before whom he expected soon toap*
pear, that as he had done it with an upright inten-
tion, so he had used his utmost endeavour to per-
form it in a manner, which was the least liable to re-
flection, and the most answerable to the end of It
—the reformation of the guilty, After such an ap-
peal, and such asseverations, I will only remark,
that this is an excellent book with an improper
title page.
We are now to consider our Author's ' Tours/
He published his Travels through England, in
172^ and 1725; and through Scotland, in 1727*
J)e Foe was not one of those travellers who seldom
quit the banks of the Thames. He had made wide
excursions over all those countries, with observant
eyes and a vigorous intellect. The great artifice
of these volumes consists iu the frequent mention
of such men and things, as are always welcome to
the reader's mind.
De Foe's Commercial Tracts are to be reviewed
lastly. Whether his fancy gradually failed, as age
hastily advanced, I am unable to tell. He certainly
began, in 1726, to employ his pen more frequently
on the real business of common life. He published,
in 1727, 'The Complete English Tradesman;' di-
recting him in the several parts of trade. A second
volume soon after followed, which was addressed
chiefly to the more experienced and more opulent
traders. In these treatises the tradesman found
many directions of business, and many lessons of
prudence. De Foe was not one of those writers,
who consider private vices < as 'public benefits.'
* God forbid, lie exclaims, that'I should be under-
stood to prompt the vices -of the age, in order to
promote an}4 practice of traffic: trade need not be
de-troycd though vice were mortally wounded/
With this salutary spirit he published, in I7'2l, * A
Plan of the English Commerce.7 This seems to be
the conclusion of what1 he :had begun in 1713.
In 1728, Gee printed his 'Trade and Navigation
Considered.' De Foe insisted, that our industry,
our commerce, our'opulence, and our people, hg.d
increased and were increasing. Gee represented
that our manufactures had received mortal stabs;
that o.ur poor were destitute, and our country
miserable. De Foe maintained the truth, which
experience has taught to unwilling auditors.' Gee
asserted the falsehood, without knowing the fact:
yet Gee is quoted, while De Foe,' with all his
knowledge of the subject, as a commercial writer,
is almost forgotten. The reason may be found
perhaps in the characteristic remark with which
he opens his plan. Trade, like religion, is what
every body talks of, but few understand.
When curiosity has contemplated such copious-
ness, such variety, and such excellence, it naturally
inquires, which was the last of De Foe's perform-
ances ? Were we to determine from the date of the
title-page, the < Plan of Commerce' must be admit-
ted to be his last. But if we must judge from his
prefatory declaration, in < The Abuse of the 'Mar-
eHAJUEJES 2D/—•GEORGE 2D- 449

this satire,' whici^lie-was so far from seeing cause
of being ashamed of, thft.t he hoped he should not
fee asiiafc&ed 6f it where he was g&ing ia account
for it, we, must finally decide, that our Author
closed hisxsareer < with this upright intention for
<Jie good of njankind/

Benjamin his second son, no account can be given.
His youngest daughter, Sophia, married Mr. Henry
Baker, a person-mofe respectable as a philosopher
than a poet, who died in 1774, at the age of se-
venty. His daughter Maria married one I&ngley;
but Haijnah and Henrietta probably remained un-

the time is come, when he must b6 acknowledged
as one of the ablest, as he is due of the most cap-
tivating, writers, of which this island can boast
Before he can be admitted to this pre-eminence,
he must be considered distinctly, as a poet, as a
novelist, as a polemick, as a commercial writer,
and as a grave historian.
As a poet, we must look to the end of his effu-
sions rather than to his execution, ere we can
aCltovv him considerable praise. To mollify na-
tional animosities, or to vindicate national rights,
is certainly noble objects, which merit the vigour
and imagination of Milton, or the flow and preci
sion of Pope j but otir Author's energy runs into
harshness, and his sweetness is to be tasted in his
prose'more than in his poesy. If we regard the
adventures of Crusoe, like the adventures of ' Te-
xnelachus,' as a poem, his moral, his incidents, and
his language, must lift him high on the poet's
scale. His professed poems, whether we con-
template the propriety of sentiment, or the suavity
of numbers, may indeed, without much loss of
pleasure or instruction, be resigned to those, who,
in imitation of Pope, poach iri the fields of obso-
lete poetry for brilliant thoughts, felicities of
phrase, or for happy rhymes.
As a novelist, every one will place him in the
foremost rank, who considers' his originality, his
performance, and his purpose. The ' Ship of Fools'
had indeed been launched1 in early times; but
who, like De Foe, had ever carried his reader to sea
in order to mend the heart,1 and 'regulate the prac-
tice of life, by shewing his readers the effects, of

©'Avena^t is more apt to consider laws in their

effects. 'From^the publications of D'Avenant it it
• wilffiscaetitly efleaFj that! he was not very regardful

*Be Foe-must yield the palm to ChUdvwha f°f^*
seeang^from experience that inen'? conduct va/mt

because he deemed interest a more strenuous
prompter than enthusiasm* Were- we however to
form an opinion, not from special passages, but
from whole performances, we must incline to* Djk
Foe, when compared, with the ablest contempo-t
rary; we must allow him the preference, on recol-
lection, that when he .writes on commerce be set*
dom fails to insinuate some axiom of morals, or t<*
inculcate some precept of religion*
* As an historian, it will be found, that our Author
had few equals in the English language, when he
wrote. His ' Memoirs of a CavaUer' -shqw how
well he could execute the lighter narratives*)
His c History-of the Union' evinces that he w&s
^qual to the higher department of historic compost**
ttoifr This is? an account of a single event, difficult
indeed in its execution, but beneficial certainly
in its consequences. With extraordinary skilland
i ? formation, our Author relates, not only the event,
tyut the transactions which preceded, and the ef-
fects which followed. He is at once learned and
intelligent. Considering^ the factiousness qf tha
age, his. candour is admirable. _ His moderation is_
exemplary, Aodif the spoke of JagaesJ.^as aityi!ant,

torians formerly ffqjoyed, of ca,st}og obloquy oft an
unfortunate a ace, in order to supply defieienpe of
knowledge, pf elegance, and of stile.,, In this in-
stance De Foeallowed his prejudice to .overpower
his philosophy. If the language of his narrative
want the dignity of the great historians of the .cur-
rent times, it has greater facility; if it be not al-
ways grammatical, it ip generally, precise; and if
it be thought defective in strength, it roust; be al-
lowed to excel in sweetness
Such then are the pretensions of Bd Foe, to be
acknowledged as one of the ablest and most useful
. writers of our island*
