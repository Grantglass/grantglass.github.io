ism de Foe was born in London about the year 16C3. i^
father was a butcher; and the family name was Foe, un- -^
ur author, for some unknown reason, changed it to De _
. He was probably intended for trade; but very soon af- _
he had received such education as a school at Newington- k
;n afforded, he became a political writer. He afterwards
aged in business as a hosier, and then as a pantile-maker; *
in both was unsuccessful. His head was frequently em-
yed on projects, and he even wrote an essay on that sub-
:; but he was always either unskilful, or unfortunate. It is,
fever, much to his credit that he continued satisfying the
nands of his creditors, as he was able, until they were paid
whole amount of their debts.
rhe first of his peiformances which excited much atten-
a was ' The True-Born Englishman,' published in 1701.
iis was a poetical satire, in defence of King William, who,
that time was blamed for employing foreigners as his friends
court. During the popularity of this piece, he wrote ano-
jr satire, called ' Reformation of Manners,' in which, among
ler topics, appeared one of the first censures on the slave-
ide.
As De Foe was a wit, he often employed an ironical way
writing, which the age was too dull to comprehend. In this
yle, he wrote a pamphlet, entitled ' The Shortest Way with
le Dissenters, or Pioposals for the Establishment of the
hurch.' It was, in fact, a defence of the dissenters, but so
I understood, that the House ofCommons pronounced it to
e a seditious libel; and De Foe suffered fine, imprisonment,
nd the pillory; the latter of which punishments he bore with
reat fortitude, and amused himself by writing ' A Hymn to
le Pillory,' during his confinement. In February, 1703 4,

while in Newgate, he commenced a periodical publication,
called the " Review," which has been supposed, and not with-
out some reason, to have given rise to the Tatler and Spec-
tator. A. t length he was liberated, by the interposition of Mr.
Harley, afterwards Lord Oxford, and resumed his occupation
of political writing. Among his principal productions of this
kind, were ' Jure Divino,' a poetical satire, in twelve books,
against arbitrary government; and ' The History of the Union/
which has lately been reprinted; to promote this, he was sent
to Scotland, where he wrote a poem, in honour of the inhabit-
ants of that country, called 'Caledonia.' He wrote also, 'The
History of Addresses,' and some pamphlets in favour of the
house of Hanover, which, being written in an ironical style,
were unfortunately mistaken for defences of the Pretender,
and the author was again prosecuted and imprisoned. These
misfortunes induced him, about the year 1715, to relinquish
politics altogether, and employ his pen on subjects of morals
or manners.
His performances in this way were chiefly ' The Family
Instructor,' in dialogues, a work to which Richardson in his
novels owes great obligation. He wrote also in the same form
' Religious Courtship,' and the narratives of ' Robinson Cru-
soe,' ' The Life of Captain Singleton,' 'Colonel Jack,' 'Moll
Flanders,' * Duncan Campbell,' and ' The Fortunate Mis-
tress.' The morality of some of these has been justly ques-
tioned, but they have all the fascinations of simplicity of style
and probability of adventure, and all enjoyed a considerable
shave of popularity. In 1722, he wrote a ' Journal of the
Plague in 1665,' which, although a fiction, imposed on Dr.
Mead, who considered it as a book of authority. He publish-
ed also three volumes of ' Travels through England and Scot-
land,' which have been the foundation of all the complete
tours and other publications of that kind since. In this
manner, for several years, he continued to publish treatises,
or pieces of fiction, many of which are no longer read; and
his poetry, it must be confessed, is only valuable as including
hints of the events and political characters of the times.
He died at his house at Islington, in 1751, leaving a daugh-
ter, who was married to Mr. H. Baker, the ingenious natu-
ralist.
Of all his writings, that which is now before the reader has
ever been the most popular. It was first published in 1719;
and perhaps few years have since passed without its being
reprinted in some convenient form. A story has long pre-
vailed that De Foe defrauded a Scotch seaman, of the name of
Selkirk, of his papers or journals, and made them the foun-
dation of this novel. That such a seaman existed, and was
shipwrecked, and afterwards wrote a journal, is probable
enough; but that he contributed more than the mere sugges-
tion of writing Robinson Crusoe, it is impossible to be-
lieve, nor have we any authenticated facts in favour of the
supposition. Robinson Crusoe, in all its essential points, is a
pure fiction, and displays a reach of invention which had never
before appeared in any English work of the kind; a fertility
of fancy and genins which De Foe could have borrowed from
no source but the inexhaustible fund of his own mind. In
adapting his style to the supposed situation and rank of Cru-
soe, he is eminently successful, simplicity and perspicuity be-
ing so uniformly preserved, that, perhaps, it is impossible to
name a work so fascinating to young and unenlightened minds,
or so happily adapted to their comprehension. It has, for
nearly a century, been one of the most popular books in our
language, and translation into most of the European languages
has rendered it the subject of admiration abroad. It has been
-well observed, that it breathes throughout a spirit of piety and
benevolence, and sets in a very striking light the importance
of the mechanic arts: it fixes in the mind a lively idea of the
horrors of solitude, and, consequently, of the sweets of social
life, and of the blessings we derive from conversation and mu-
tual aid.
ROBINSON CRUSOE.
I was born in the year 1632, in the city of York, of a good
family, though not of that country, my father being a foreigner
of Bremen, who settled first at Hull. He got a good estate
by merchandise, and leaving off his trade, lived afterwards at
York; from whence he married my mother, whose relations
were named Robinson, a very good family in that country,
and from whom 1 was called Robinson Kreutznaer; but, by
the usual corruption of words in England, we are now called,
nay, we call ourselves, and write our name, Crusoe; and so
my companions always called me.
I had two elder brothers; one of whom was lieutenant-
colonel to an English regiment of foot in Flanders, formerly
commanded my the famous colonel Lockhart, and was killed
at the battle near Dunkirk against the Spaniards. What be-
came of my second brother, I never knew, any more than my
father or mother did know what was become of me.
Being the third son of the family, and not bred to any
trade, my head began to be filled very early with rambling
thoughts. My father, who was very ancient, had given me a
competent share of learning, as far as house-education and a
country free-school generally goes, and designed me for the
law; but I would be satisfied with nothing but going to sea:
and my inclination to this led me so strongly against the will,
nay, the commands of my father, and against all the entrea-
ties and persuasions of my mother and other friends, that
there seemed to be something fatal in that propension of na-
ture, tending directly to the life of misery which was to be-
fall me.
My father, a wise and grave man, gave me serious and
excellent counsel against what he foresaw was my design. He
called me one morning into his chamber, where he was con-
fined by the gout, and expostulated very warmly with me up-
on this subject. He asked me what reasons, more than a mere
wandering inclination, I had for leaving my lather's house,
A 2
and my native country; where I might be well introduced,
and have a prospect of raising my fortune by application and
industry, with a life of ease and pleasure. He told me it was
men of desperate fortunes on one hand, or of aspiring superior
fortunes on the other, who went abroad upon adventures, to
rise by enterprise; and make themselves famous in underta.
kings of a nature out of the common road; that these things
were all either too far above me, or too far below me; that
mine was the middle state, or what might be called the upper
station of low life, which he had found, by long experience,
was the best stale in the world; the most suited to human hap-
piness, not exposed to the miseries and hardships, the labour
and sufferings, of the mechanic part of mankind: and not em-
barrassed with the pride, luxury, ambition and envy of the up-
per part of mankind. He told me I might judge of the hap-
piness of this state by this one thing; viz. that this was the state
of life which all other people envied; that kings have frequent-
ly lamented the miserable consequences of being born to great
things, and wished they had been placed in the middle of the
two extremes, between the mean and the great; that the wise
man gave his testimony to this, as the just standard of true
felicity, when he prayed to have neither poverty nor riches.
He bade me observe it, and I should always find, thai the
calamities of life were shared among the upper and lower part
of mankind; but that the middle station had the fewest disas-
ters, and was nol exposed to so many vicissitudes as the high-
er or lower part of mankind; nay, they were not subjected to
so many distempers and uneasinesses, either of body or mind,
as those were, who, by vicious living, luxury, and extravagan-
cies on one hand, or by hard labour, want of necessaries, and
mean or insufficient diet, on the other hand, bring distempers
upon themselves by the natural consequences of their way of
living; that the middle statiou of life was calculated for all kind
of virtues, and all kinds of enjoyments; that peace and plenty
were the handmaids of a middle fortune; that temperance,
moderation, quietness, health, society, all agreeable diver-
sions, and all desirable pleasures, were the blessings attend-
ing the middle station of life; that this way men went silently
Jmd smoothly through the world, and comfortably out of it;
not embarrassed with the labours of the hands, or of the head;
not sold to a life of slavery for daily bread, or harassed with
perplexed circumstances, which rob the soul of peace, and
the body of rest; nor enraged with the passion of envy, or the
secret burning lust of ambition for great things; but, in easy
circumstances, sliding gently through the world, and sensibly
tasting the sweets of living, without the bitter; feeling that
they are happy, and learning by every day's experience to
know it more sensibly.
After this, he pressed me earnestly, and in the most
affectionate manner, not to play the young man, nor to pre-
cipitate myself into miseries, which nature, and the station of
life I was born in, seemed to have provided against; that I
was under no necessity of seeking my bread; that he would
do well for me, and endeavour to enter me fairly into the
station of life which he had. been just recommending to mc;
and that if 1 was not very easy and happy in the world, it
must be my mere fate, or fault, that must hmder it: and that
he should have nothing to answer for, having thus discharged
his duty in warning me against measures which he knew
would be to my hurt. In a word, that as he would do very
kind things for me if I would stay and settle at home as he
directed; so he would not have so much hand in my misfor-
tunes, as to give me any encouragement to go away: and to
close all, he told me, I had my elder brother for an exam-
ple, to whom he had used the same earnest persuasions to
keep him from going into the Low Country wars; but could
not prevail, his young desires prompting him to run into the
army, where he was killed; and though he said he would not
cease to pray for me, yet he would venture to say to me, that
if I did take this foolish step, God would not bless me, and I
would have leisure hereafter to reflect upon having neglect-
ed his counsel, when there might be none to assist in my re-
covery.
I observed in this last part of his discourse, which was
truly prophetie, though I suppose my father did not know it
to be so himself; I say, I observed the tears run down his
face very plentifully, especially when he spoke of my hrother
who was killed: and that when he spoke of my having lei-
sure to repent, and none to assist me, he was so moved, that
he broke off the discourse, and told me, his heart was so full,
he could say no more to me.
1 was sincerely affected with this discourse, as indeed who
could be otherwise' And I resolved not to think of going
abroad any more, but to settle at home according to my fa-
ther's desire. But alas! a few days wore it all off; anil,
in short, to prevent any of my father's farther importunities,
in a few weeks after I resolved to run quite away from him.
However, I did not act so hastily neither, as the first heat of
my resolution prompted; but I took my mother at a time
when I thought her a little pleasanter than ordinary, and told
her, that my thoughts were so entirely bent upon seeing the
world, that I should never settle to any thing with resolution
enough to go through with it; and my father had better give
me his consent, than force me to go without it: that I was now
eighteen years old, which was too late to go apprentice to a
a trade, or clerk to an attorney: that I was sure, if I did, I
should never serve out my time, but I should certainly run
away from my master before my time was out, and go to
sea: and if she would speak to my father to let me go one
voyage abroad, if I came home again and did not like it, I
would go no more, and I would promise, by a double dili-
gence, to recover the time I had lost.
This put my mother into a great passion. She told me,
she knew it would be to no purpose to speak to my father
upon any such subject; that he knew too well what was my
interest, to give his consent to any thing so much for my
hurt; and that she wondered how I could think of any such
thing, after the discourse I had had with my father, and such
kind and tender expressions, as she knew my father had used
to me; and that, in short, if I would ruin myself, there was
no help for me; but I might depend I should never have
their consent to it: that for her part, she would not have so
much hand in my destruction; and I should never have it to
say, that my mother was willing, when my father was not-
Though my mother refused to move it to my father, yet I
heard afterwards that she reported all the discourse to him;
and that my father, after showing a great concern at it, said
to her, with a sigh, ' That the boy might be happy, if he
would stay at home; but if he goes abroad, he will be the
most miserable wretch that ever was born: I can give no con-
sent to it.'
It was not till almost a year after this that I broke loose,
though in the mean time L continued obstinately deaf to all
proposals of settling to business, and frequently expostulating
with my father and mother about their being so positively
determined against what they knew my inclinations prompt-
ed me to. But being one day at Hull, whither I went casu-
ally, and without any purpose of making an elopement that
time; but, 1 say, being there, and one of my companions be-
ing going by sea to London, in his father's ship, and prompt-
ing me to go with them, with the common allurement of a
seafaring man, that it should cost me nothing for my passage,
1 consulted neither father nor mother any more, nor so much
as sent them word of it: but leaving them to hear of it, as
they might, without asking God's blessing, or my father's,
without any consideration of circumstances or consequences,
and in an ill hour, God knows, on the first of September, 1651,
I went on board a ship bound for London. Never any young
adventurer's misfortunes, I believe began sooner or continued
longer, than mine. The ship was no sooner got out of the
Humber, but the wind began to blow, and the sea to rise in a
most frightful manner; and, as I had never been at sea be-
fore, I was most inexpressibly sick in body, and terrified in
mind. I began now seriously to reflect upon what I had done,
and how justly I was overtaken by the judgment of heaven,
for my wicked leaving my father's house, and abandoning my
duty. All the good council of my parents, my father's tears,
and my mother's entreaties, came now fresh into my mind;
and my conscience, which was not yet come to the pitch of
hardness to which it has been since, reproached me with the
•ontempt of advice, and the breach of my duty to God and my
father.
All this while the storm increased, and the sea went very
high, though nothing like what I have seen many times
since; no, nor what I saw a few days after But it was
enough to affect me then, who was but a young sailor, and
had never known any thing of the matter. 1 expected every
wave would have swallowed us up, and that every time the
ship fell down, as I thought it did, in the trough or hollow of
the sea, we should never rise more. In this agony of mind,
I made many vows and resolutions, that if it would please
God to spare my life in this one voyage, if ever I got once
my foot upon dry land again, I would go directly home to my
father, and never set it into a ship again while I lived: that
.I would take his advice, and never run myself into such. mi-
series as these any more. Now I saw plainly the goodness of
his observations about the middle station of life, how easy,
how comfortable, he had lived all his days, and never had
been exposed to tempests at sea, or troubles on shore: and,
in short, I resolved that I would, like a true repenting prodi-
gal, go home to my father.
These wise and sober thoughts continued all the while the
storm continued, and indeed some time after; but the next
day the wind was abated, and the sea calmer, and I began t«
be a little inured to it. However, I was very grave for all
that day, being also a little sea-sick still; but towards night
the weather cleared up, the wind was quite over, and a
charming fine evening followed; the sun went down perfectly
clear, and rose so the next morning; and having little or no
wind, and a smooth sea, the suu shining upon it, the sight
was, as I thought, the most delightful that ever I saw
I had slept well in the night, and was now no more sea-sick,
but very cheerful; looking with wonder upon the sea, that
was so rough and terrible the day before, and could be so
calm and so pleasant in so little a time after. And now, lest
my good resolutions should continue, my companion, who had
indeed, entieed me away, eomes to me, ' Well Bob,' says he,
clapping me upon the shoulder, "how do you do after it? I war-
rant you were frightened, w'an't you, lastnight, when it blew
but a capfull of wind?' ' A capfull d'youcallit?' said I, 'twasa
terrible storm,' ' A storm, you fool you!' replies he; 'do you
call that a storm? Why it was nothing at all; give us but a
good ship and sen-room, and we think nothing of such a squall
of wind as that: but, you're but a fresh-water sailor, Bob.
Come, let us make a bowl of punch, and we'll forget all that.
D'you see what charming weather 'tis now!' To make short
this sad part of my story, we went the way of all sailors; the
punch was made; and 1 was made half drunk with it, and in
that one night's wickedness I drowned all my repen-
tance, all my reflections upon my past conduct, .and all my
resolutions for the future In a word, as the sea was re-
turned to its smoothness of surface, and settled calmness, by
the abatement of that storm, so the hurry of my thoughts be-
ing over, my fears and apprehensions of being swallowed up
by sea being forgotten, and the current of my former desires
returned, I entirely forgot the vows and promises that I made
in my distress. I found indeed some intervals of reflection,
and the serious thoughts did, as it were, endeavour to return
again sometimes; but I shook them off, and roused myself
from them, as it were from a distemper! and applying my-
self to drinking and company, soon mastered the return of
those fits (for so I called them); and I had, in five or six
days, got as complete a victory over conscience, as any young
fellow that resolved not to be troubled with it could desire.
But I was to have another trial for it still; and Providence,
as in such cases generally it does, resolved to leave me en-
tirely without excuse: for, if I would not take this for a deli-
verance, the next was to be such a one, as the worst and
most hardened wretch among us would confess both the dan-
ger and the mercy. .
The sixth day of our being at sea, we came into Yarmouth
Roads: the wind having been contrary, and the weather calm,
we had made but little way since the storm. Here we were
obliged to come to an anchor; and here we lay, the wind con-
tinuing contrary, viz. at south-west for seven or eight days:
during which time a great many ships from New-castle came
into the same roads, as the common harbour where the ships
might wait for a wind for the river.
We had not, however, rid here so long, but we should
have tided it up the river, but that the wind blew too fresh;
and, after we had lain four or five days, blew very hard.
However, the roads being reckoned as good as a harbour, the
anchorage good, and our ground tackle very strong, our men
were unconcerned, and not in the least apprehensive of dan-
ger, but spent the time in rest and mirth, after the manner
of the sea: but the eighth day in the morning, the wind in-
creased, and we had all hands at work to strike our top-
masts, and make every thing snug and close, that the ship
might ride as easy as possible. By noon the sea went very
high indeed, and our ship rid fore-castle in, shipped several
seas, and we thought once or twice our anchor had come
home; upon which our master ordered out the sheet anchor,
so that we rode with two anchors ahead, and the cables veered
out to the better end.
By this time it blew a terrible storm indeed, and now I
began to see terror and amazement in the faces even of the
seamen themselves. The master, though vigilant in the bu-
siness of preserving the ship, yet as he went in and out of his
cabin by me, I could hear him, softly to himself, say several
times; ' Lord be merciful to us! We shall be all lost; we shall
be all undone!' and the like. During these first hurries I was
stupid, lying still in my cabin, which was in the steerage,
and cannot describe my temper. I could ill resume the first
penitence, which I had so apparently trampled upon, and
hardened myself against. I thought the bitterness of death
had been past; and that this would be nothing too, like the
first. But when the master himself came by me, as I said
just now, and said we should be all lost, I was dreadfully
frighted. I got up out of my cabin, and looked out; but such
a dismal sight I never saw; the sea went mountains high, and
broke upon us every three or four minutes. When I could
look about, I could see nothing but distress round us Two
ships that rid near us, we found had cut their masts by the
board, being deep loaden; and our men cried out, that a ship,
which rid about a mile ahead of us, was foundered. Two more
ships, beingdhven from their anchors, were run out of the roads
to sea, at all adventures, and that not with a mast standing.
The light ships fared the best, as not so much labouring in
the sea; but two or three of them drove, and came close by
us, running away, with only their sprit-sail out, before the wind.
Towards the evening the mate and boatswain begged the
master of our ship to let them cut away the fore-mast, which
he was very unwilling to do; but the boatswain protesting to
him that if he did not, the ship would founder, he consented:
and when they had cut away the fore-maM, the main mast
stood so loose, and shook the ship so much, they were obliged
to cut her away also, and make a clear deck.
\ny one may judge what a condition I must be in at all
this, who was but a young sailor, and who had been in such a
fright before at but a little. But, if I can express at this dis-
tance the thoughts! had about me at that time, I was in ten-
fold mbre horror of mind upon account of my former convic-
tions, and the having returned from them to the resolutions I
had wickedly taken at first, than I was at death itself; and
these, added to the terror of the storm, put me into such ft
condition, that I can by no words describe it. But the worst
was not come yet: the storm continued with such fury, that
the seamen themselves acknowledged they had never seen a
worse. We had a good ship, but she was deep loaden, and
wallowed in the sea, that the seamen every row and then
cried out, she would founder. It was my advantage in one
respect, that I did not know what they meant by founder,
till I inquired. However, the storm was so violent, that I
saw what is not often seen, the master, the boatswain, and
some others more sensible than the rest, at their prayers,
and expecting every moment when the ship would go to the
bottom. In the middle of the night, and under all the rest
of our distresses, one of the men that had been down on pur-
pose to see, cried out we had sprung a leak; another said,
there was four feet water in the hold. .Then all hands were
called to the pump. At that very word my heart as I thought,
died within me; and I fell backwards upon the side of the
b-ed where I sat into the cabin. However, the men roused
me, and told me, that I that was able to do nothing before,
was as well able to pump as another: at which I stirred up,
and went to the pump, and worked very heartily. While
this was doing, the master seeing some light colliers, who,
not able to ride out the storm, were obliged to slip and run
away to sea, and would come near us, ordered to fire a gun
as a signal of distress. I who knew nothing what that meant,
was so surprised, that I thought the ship had broke, or some
dreadful thing happened. In a word, I was so surprised, that
I fell down in a swoon. As this was a time when every body
had his own life to think of, nobody minded me, or what was
become of me: but another man stepped up to the pump,
and, thrusting me aside with his foot, let me lie, thinking
I had been dead; and it was a great while before I came to
myself.
We worked on, but the water increasing in the hold, it
was apparent that the ship would founder; and though the
storm began to abate a little, yet as it was not possible she
could swim till we might run into any port, so the master
continued firing guns for help; and a light ship, who had rid it
out just sihead of us, ventured a boat out to help us. It was
with the utmost hazard the boat came near us; but it was im-
possible for us to get on board, or for the boat to lie near the
ship-side, till at last the men rowing very heartily, and ven-
turing tlieir lives to save ours, our men cast them a rope over
the stern with a buoy to it, and then veered it out a great
length, which they, after much labour and hazard, took hold
of; and we hauled them close under our stern, and got all into
their boat. It was to no purpose for them or us. after we
were in the boat, to think of reaching to their own ship; so
all agreed to let her drive, and only to pull her in towards
shore as much as we could; and our master promised them,
B
that if the boat was staved upon shove, he would make it good
to their master. So partly rowing; and partly driving, our
boat went away to the northward, sloping towards the shore,
almost as far as VVintertonness.
We were not much more than a quarter of an hour out of
our ship, but we saw her sink; and then I understood, for the
first time, what was meant by a ship foundering in the sea. I
must acknowledge I had hardly eyes to look up, when the
seamen told me she was sinking; for, from that moment, they
rather put me into the boat, than that I might he said to go
in; my heart was, as it were, dead within me, partly with
fright, partly with horror of mind, and the thoughts of what
was yet before me.
While we were in this condition, the men yet labouring at
the oar to bring the boat near the shore, we could see (when
our boat mounting the waves, we were able to see the shore)
a great many people running along the strand to assist us
when we should come near. But we made but slow way to-
wards the shore; nor were we able to reach the shore, till
being past the light-house at Winterton, the shore falls off to
the westward towards Cromer; and so the land broke off a
little the violence of the wind. Here we got in; and, though
not without much difficulty, got all safe on shore; and walked
afterwards on foot to Yarmouth, where, as unfortunate men,
we were used with great humanity, as -well by the ma-
gistrates of the town, who assigned us good quarters, as by
particular merchants and owners of ships; and had money
given us sufficient to carry us either to London or back to
Hull, as we thought fit.
Had I now had the sense to have gone back to Hull, and
have gone home, I had been happy, and my father, an em-
blem of our blessed Saviour's parable, had even killed the
fatted calf for me; for, hearing the ship I went away in was
cast away in Yarmouth roads, it was a great while before he
had any assurances that I was not drowned
But my ill fate pushed me on now with an obstinacy that
nothing could resist; and though I had several times loud
calls from my reason, and my more composed judgment, to
go home, yet I had no power to do it. I know not what to
call this; nor will I urge, that it is a secret over-ruling decree,
that hurries us on to be the instruments of our own destruc-
tion, even thongh it be before us, and that we push upon it
with our eyes open. Certainly, nothing but some such de-
creed unavoidable misery attending, and which it was impos-
sible tor me to escape, could have pushed me forward against
the calm reasonings and persuasions of my most retired
thoughts, and against two such visible instructions as I had
met with in my first attempt.
My comrade, who had helped to harden me before, and
who was the master's son, was now less forward than I. The
first time he spoke to me after we were at Yarmouth, which
was not till two or three days, for we were separated in the
town to several quarters; 1 say, the first time he saw me, it
appeared his tone was altered; and looking very melancholy,
and shaking his head, asked me how I did; and telling his
father who I was, and how I had come this voyage only for a
trial, in order to go farther abroad; his father turning to me
with a very grave and concerned tone, ' Young man,' says he,
* you ought never to go to sea any more; you ought to take
this for a plain and visible token, that you are not to be a sea-
faring man.' ' Why, sir,' said I,' will you go to sea no more?'
* That is another case,' said he; ' it is my calling, and there-
fore my duty; but, as you made this voyage for a trial, you
see what a taste Heaven has given you of what you are to ex-
pect, if you persist; perhaps all this has befallen us on your
account, like Jonah in the ship of Tarshish. Pray,' continues
he, ' what are you? and on what account did you go to sea?'
Upon that I told him some of my story; at the end of
-which he burst out with a strange kind of passion. ..£ What
had 1 done,' says he, ' that such an unhappy wretch should
come into my ship? 1 would not set my foot in the same ship
with thee again for a thousand pounds!' This mdeed was, as
I said, an excursion of his spirits; which were yet agitated by
the sense of his loss, and Vas further than he could have au-
thorily to go. However, lie afterwards talked very gravely
to me, exhorting me to go back to my father, and not tempt
Providence to my ruin; told me 1 might see a visible hand of
Heaven against me: ' And young man,' said he, ' depend
npon it, if you do not go back, wherever you go, you will meet
with nothing but disasters and disappointments, till your fa-
ther's words are fulfilled upon you.'
We parted soon after; for I made him little answer, and I
saw him no more: which way he went I know not. As for
me, having some money in my pocket, I travelled to London
by land; and there, as well as on the mad, had many struggles
with myself, what course of life I should take, am) whether I
should go home, or go to sea.
As to going home, shame opposed the best motions that of-
fered to my thoughts; and it immediately occurred to me
how I should he laughed at among the neighbours, and should
be ashamed to see, not my father and mother only, but even
every body else. From whence I have since often observed
how incongruous and irrational the common temper of man-
kind is, especially of youth, to that reason that ought to guide
them in such cases, viz. that they are not ashamed to sin, and
yet are ashamed to repent; and not ashamed of the acl ion,
for which they ought justly to be esteemed fools; but are
ashamed of the returning, which only can make them esteem-
ed wise men.
In this state of life, however, I remained some time, un-
certain what measures to take, and what course of lift; to
lead An irresistible reluctance continued to going home;
and, as I stayed awhile, the remembrance of the distress I
hud been in wore of; and as that abated, the little motion I
had in my desires to return, wore off with it, till at last I quite
laid aside the thoughts of it and looked out for a voyage.
That evil influence which carried me first away from
my father's house, which hurried me into the wild and indi-
gested notion of raising mj fortune, and that impressed those
conceits so forcibly upon me, as to make me deaf to all good
advice, and to the entreaties, and even the commands of nay
father; I say, the same influence, whatever it was, presented
the most unfortunate of all enterprises to my view; and I
went on board a vessel bound to the coast of Africa, or, as
our sailors vulgarly call it, u voyage to Guinea.
It was my great misfortnne, that, in all these adventures,
I did not ship myself as a sailor; whereby, though I might
indeed have worked a little harder than ordinary, vet at the
same time I had learned the duty and office of a fore-mast-
man; and in time might have qualified myself tor a mate or
lientenant, if not for a master But as it was always my fate
to choose for the worse, so I did here ; for, having money in
my pocket, and good clothes on my back, I would always go
on board in the habit of a gentleman; and so I neither had
any business in the ship, nor learned to do any.
It was my lot first of all to fall into pretty good company
in London, which does not always happen to such loose and
unguided young fellows as I then was; the devil, generally,
not omitting to lay some snare for them very early: but it
was not so with me. I first fell acquainted with the master
of a ship who had been on the eoast of Guinea, and who,
having had very good success there, was resolved to go again.
This captain taking a fancy to my conversation, which was
not disagreeable at that time, hearing me say I had a
mind to see the world, told me,!if I would go the voyage with
him, I should be at no expense; I should be his messmate,
and his companion; and if 1 could carry any thing with me, I
should have all the advantage of it that the trade would ad-
mit; and perhaps I might meet with some encouragement.
I embraced the offer, and, entering into a strict friendship
with this captain, who was an honest plain-dealing man, went
the voyage with him; and carried a small adventure with me,
which by the disinterested honesty of my friend the captain,
I increased very considerably; for I carried about 401. in such
toys and trifles as the captain directed me to buy. This 401.
1 had mustered together by the assistance of some of my re-
lations whom I corresponded with, and who, I believe got my
father, or at least my mother, to contribute so much as that
to my first adventure.
This was the only voyage which I may say was successful
in all my adventures, and which I owe to the integrity and
honesty of my friend the captain; under whom I also got a
competent knowledge of the mathematics, and the rules of
navigation ; learned how to keep an account of the ship's
course, take an observation, and, in short, to understand some
things that were needful to be understood by a sailor; for, as
he took delight to introduce me, I took delight to learn; and,
in a word, this voyage made me both a sailor and a merchant;
for I brought home five pounds nine ounces of gold-dust for
my adventure, which yielded me in London, at my return,
almost 3001.; and this filled me with those aspiring thoughts
which have since so completed my ruin.
Vet, even in this voyage, I had my misfortunes too; par-
ticularly that I was continually sick, being thrown into a vio-
lent calenture by the excessive heat of the climate, our prin-
cipal trading being upon the coast, from the latitude of 15 de-
grees N. even to the line itself.
n 2
I was now set up for a Guinea trader; and my friend to my
great misfortune, dying soon after his arrival, I resolved to go
the same voyage again; and I embarked in the same vessel
with one who was his mate in the former voyage, and had now
got the command of the ship- This was the unhappiest voy-
age that ever man made; for though I ilid not carry quite
1001 of my new-gained wealth, so that I had 2001. left, and
which I lodged with my friend's widow, who was very just to
me, yet I fell into terrible misfortunes in this voyage; and
the first was this, viz. our ship, making her course towards
the Canary islands, or rather between those islands and the
African shore, was surprised in the gray of the morning by a
Moorish rover of Sallee, who gave chase to us with all the sail
she could make. We crowded also as much canvass as our
yards would spread, or our masts carry, to have got clear; but,
finding the pirate gained upon us, and would certainly come up
with us in a few hours, we prepared to fight; our ship having
twelve guns, and the rogue eighteen. About three in the af-
ternoon he came up with us, and bringing to, by mistake, just
athwart our quarter, instead of athwart our stern, as he in-
tended, we brought eight of our guns to bear on that side, and
poured in a broadside upon him, which made him sheer off
again, after returning our fire, and pouring in also his small
shot from near two hundred men which he had on board.
However, we had not a man touched, all our men keeping
close. He prepared to attack us again, and we to defend
ourselves; but, laying us on board the next time upon our
other quarter, he entered ninety men upon our decks who
immediately fell to cutting and hacking the decks and rig-
ging. We plied them with small shot, half-pikes, puwder
i bests, and such like, and cleared our decks of them twice.
However, to cut short this melancholy part of our story, our
ship being disabled, and three of our men killed, and eight
wounded, we were obliged to yield; and were carried all pri-
soners into Sallee, a port belonged to the Moors.
The usage I had there was not so dreadful as at first t ap-
prehended; nor was I carried up the country, to trie empe-
ror's court, as the rest of our men were, but was loppt by the
captain of the rover as his proper prize, and made his slave,
being young and nimble, and fit for his business. Jit this sur-
prising change of my circumstances, from a merchant to a
miserable slave, I was perfectly overwhelmed; and now I
looked back upon my father's prophetic discourse to me, that
I should be miserable, and have norie.to relieve me, which I
thought was no .1 so effectually brought to pass, that I could
not be worse; that now the hand of Heaven had overtaken
me, and I was undone without redemption. But alas! this
was but a taste of the misery I was to go through, as will ap-
pear in the sequel of this story. '. '
As my new patron or master had taken me home to his
house, sol was in hopes that he would take me with him when
he went to sea again, believing that it would be some time or
other his fate to be taken by a Spanish or Portuguese man of
war; and that then I should be set at liberty. But this hope
of mine was soon taken away, for when he went to sea, he
left me on shore to look after his little garden, and do the
common drudgery of slaves about his house; and when he
came home again from his cruise, he ordered me to lie in the
cabin, to look after the ship.
Here I meditated nothing but my escape, and what me-
thod I might take to effect it; but found no way that bad the
least probability in it. Nothing presented to make the sup-
position of it rational, for I had nobody to communicate it to,
that would embark with me, .no fellow slave, no Englishman,
Irishman or Scotsman there, but myself; so that for two years,
though I often pleased myself with the imagination, yetl never
had the least encouraging prospect of putting it in practice.
After about two years, an odd circumstance presented it-
self, which put the old thought of making some attempt for
my liberty again in my head. My patroa lying at home lon-
ger than usual, without Suing out his ship, which as I heard,
was for want of money, he used, constantly once or twice a
week, sometimes oftener, if the weather was fjir, to take the
ship's pinnace, and go out into the road a fishing; and as he
always took me and a young Maresco with him to row the
boat, we made him very merry, and I proved verv dexterous
in catching fish; inasmuch that sometimes he would send me
with a Moor, one of his kinsmen, and the youth the Mores-
<o, as, they called him, to catch a dish of fish for him.
It happened onetime, that going a fishing with him in a
calm morning, a fog rose so thick, that though we were not
half a league from the shore, we lost sight of it; and, rowing
we knew not whither, or which way, we laboured all day, and
all the next night; and when the morning came, we found
we had pulled oft- to sea, instead of pulling in for the shore,
and that we were at least two leagues from the land. How-
ever, we got well in again, though with a great deal of labour,
and some danger; for the wind began to blow pretty fresh in
the morning: hut particularly we were all very hungry.
But our patron, warned by this disaster, resolved to take
more care of himself for the future; and having lying by him
the long boat of our English ship which he had taken, he re-
solved he would not go a fishing any more without a compass,
and some provision'- so he ordered the carpenter of his ship,
who was also an English slave, to build a little state-room or
cabin in the middle of the long-boat, like that of a barge, with
a place to stand behind it to steer, and haul home the main-
sheet; and room before for a hand or two to stand and work
the sails. She sailed with what we call a shoulder-of-mutton
sail; and the boom jibbed over the top of the cabin, which
lay very suug and low, and had in it room for him to lie, with
a slave or two, and a table to eat on, with some small lockers
to put in some bottles of such liquor as be thought fit to drink;
particularly his bread, rice, and coffee.
We were frequently out with this boat a fishing; and as I
was most dexterous to catch fish for him, he never went
without me. It happened one day, that he had appointed to
go out in this boat, either for pleasure or for fish, with two
or three Moors of some distinction, and for whom he had
provided extraordinarily, and had therefore sent onboard the
boat over night a larger store of provisions than usual; and
had ordered me to get ready three fusils with powder and
shot, which were on board his ship: for that they designed
some sport of fowling as well as fishing.
I got all things ready, as he had directed; and waited the
next morning with the boat washed clean, her ancient and pen-
dants out, and everything to accommodate his guests. when,
by and by, my patron came on board alone, and told me his
guests had put offgoing, upon some business that fell out, and
ordered me with the man and boy, as usual, to go out with
the boat, and catch them some fish, for that his friends were
to sup at his house. He commanded me too, that as soon as
I had got some fish, I should bring it home to his house.
All which I prepared to do.
This moment my former notions of deliverance darted into
my thoughts, for now I found I was like to have a little ship
at my command; and my master being gone, I prepared to
furnish! myself, not for fishing business, but for a voyage:
though I knew not, neither did I so much as consider, whi-
ther I would steer; for any where to get out of that place
was my way.
My first contrivance was to make a pretence to speak to
this Moor, to get something for our subsistence on board;
for I told him we must not presume to eat of our patron's
bread. He said, that was true; so he brought a large basket
of rusk or biscuit, of their kind, and three jars with fresh
water, into the boat. I knew where my patron's case of bot-
tles stood, which, it was evident by the make, were taken
outof some English prize, and I conveyed them into the boat,
while the Moor was on shore, as if they had been there be-
fore for oar master. I conveyed also a great lump of bees-
wax into the boat, which weighed about half a hundred
weight with a parcel of twine and thread, a hatchet, a saw,
and a hammer, all which were of great use to us afterwards:
especially the wax to make candles. Another trick I tried
upon him, which he innocently came into also. His name
was Ismael, whom they call Muley or Moley; so I called to
him, ' Moley,' said I, 'our patron's guns are all on board
the boat: can you not get a little powder and shot? It may be
we may kill some alcamies (a fowl like our curliens) for our-
selves; for I know he keeps the gunner's stores in the ship.'
'Yes,' says he, 'I'll bring some.' Accordingly he brought
a great leather pouch, which held about a pound aud a half
of powder, or rather more; and another with shot, that had
five or six pounds, with some bullets, and put all into the
boat. At the same time time I had found some powder of
my master's in the great cabin, with which I filled one of the
large bottles in the case, which was almost empty, pouring
what was in it into another: and thus furnished with every
thing needful, we sailed out of the port to fish. The castle,
which is at the entrance of the port, knew who we were, and
took no notice of us; and we were not above a mile out of
the port, before we hauled in our sail, and set us down to fish.
The wind blew from the N.N. E. which was contrary to my
desire; for had it blown southerly, I had been sure to have
made the coast of Spain, and at least reached to the bay of
Cadiz; but my resolutions were, blow which way it would, I
.would be gone from thai horrid place where I was, and leave
the rest to fate.
After we had fished some time, and catched nothing (for
-when 1 had fish on my hook, I would not pull them up, that he
might not see them,) 1 said to the Moor, ' This will not do:
our master will not be thus served. We must stand farther
off.' He, thinking no harm, agreed; and being in the head of
the boat, set the sails, and, as I had the helm, I run the boat
out near a league farther, and then brought her to, as if I
would fish; when, giving the boy the helm, I stepped for-
-ward to where the Moor was, and making as if I stooped for
something behind him, I took him by surprise with my arm
under his twist, and tossed him clear overboard into the sea.
He rose immediately, for he swam like a cork, and called to
me, begged to be taken in, told me he would go all over the
world with me He swam so strong after the boat, that he
would have reached me very quickly, there being but little'
wind; upon which I stepped into the cabin, and, fetching one
of the fowling pieces, I presented it at him, and told him I
had done him no hurt, and, if he would be quiet, I would do
him none: ' But,' said I, ' you swim well enough to reach the
shore, and the sea is calm, make the best of your way to
shore, and I will do you no harm: but, if you come near the
boat, I'll shoot you through the head, for 1 am resolved to
have my liberty.' So he turned himself about, and swam for
the shore, and I make no doubt but he reached it with ease,
for he was an excellent swimmer.
I could have been content to have taken this Moor with me,
and have drowned the boy, but there was no venturing to
trust him When he was gone, I turned to the boy, whom
they called Xury, and said to him, ' Xury, if you will be
faithful to me, I'll make you a great man; but if you will not
stroke your face to he true to me, that is, swear by Maho-
met, and his father's beard; I must throw you into the sea
too.' The boy smiled in my face, and spoke so innocently,
that I could not mistrust him; and swore to be faithful to
me, and go all over the world with nie.
While I was in view of the Moor that was swimming, I
stood out directly to sea with the boat, rather stretching to
windward, that they might think me gone towards the Straits
mouth (as indeed any one that had been in their wits must
have been supposed to do; for who would have supposed we
were sailed on to the southward, to the truly barbarian coasts,
.where whole nations of Negroes were sure to surround us,
with their canoes, and destroy us; where we could never
once go on shore, but we should be devoured by savage beasts,
or more merciless savages of human kind?
But, as soon as it grew dusk in the evening, I changed my
course, and steered directly south and by east, bending my
course a little towards the east, that I might keep in with the
shore; and, having a fair fresh gale of wind, and a smooth
quiet sea, I made such sail. that, I believe, by the next day
at three o'clock in the afternoon, when I first made the land,
1 could not be less than 150 miles south of Sallee, quite be-
yond the Emperor of Morocco's dominions, or indeed of any
other king thereabouts, for we saw no people.
Yet such was the fright I had taken at the Moors, and the
dreadful apprehensions I had of falling into their hands, that
I would not stop, or go on shore, or come to an anchor, the
wind continuing fair, till I had sailed in that manner five
days; and then the wind shifting to the southward, I con-
cluded, also that if any of our vessels were in chase of me,
they also would now give over; so 1 ventured to make to
the coast, and came to an anchor in the mouth of a little ri-
ver, I knejW not what or where, neither what latitude, what
eountry, what nation, or what river. I neither saw nor desired
to see any people: the principal thing I wanted was fresh
water. We came into this creek in the evening, resolving to
swim on shore as soon as it was dark, and discover the coun-
try; but as soon as it was quite dark, we heard such dreadful
noises of the barking, roaring, and howling of wild creatures,
of we knew not what kinds, that the poor boy was ready to
die with fear, and begged of me not to go on shore till day.
* Well, Xury', said I, ' then I won't; but it may be we may
see men by day, who will be as bad to us as those lions.'
• Then we may give them the shoot gun,' says Xury, laugh-
ing, ' make them run wey.' Such English Xury spoke by
conversing among the slaves. However, I was glad to see the
boy so cheerful, and I gave him a dram (out of our patron's
case of bottles) to cheer him up. After all, Xury's advice was
good, and I took it: we dropped our little anchor, and lay
still all night; I say stdl, for we slept none; for in two or three
hours we saw vast great creatures, we knew not what to call
them, of many sorts, come down to the sea-shore, and run
into the water, wallowing anil washing themselves for the
pleasure of cooling themselves: and they made such hideous
howlings and veilings, that I never indeed heard the like.
Xury was dreadfully frighted, and indeed so was I too; but
we were both worse frighted when we heard one of the migh-
ty creatures come swimming towards our boat: we could net see
him, but we might hear him by his blowing to be a monstrous
huge and furious beast. Xury said it was a lion, and (hat it
might be for aught I know. Poor Xury cried out to me to
weigh the anchor, and row away. ' No,' says I, Xury, ' we
can slip our cable with a buoy to it, and go to sea; they can-
not follow us far.' I had uo sooner said so, but I perceived
the creature (whatever it was) within two oars length, which
something surprised me; however, I immediately stepped to
the cabin door, and taking up my gun, fired at him, upon
which he immediately turned about, and swam towards
the shore again.
But it was not possible to describe the horrible noises, and
hideous cries and howlings that were raised, as well upon the
edge of the shore as higher within the country, upon the
noise or report of a gun, a thing, I have some reason to be-
lieve those creatures had never heard before. This convin-
ced me that there was no going on shore for us in the night
upon that coast, and how to venture on shore in the day,
was another question too; for, to have fallen into the hands
of any of the savages, had been as bad as to have fallen into
the paws of lions and tigers; at least we were equally appre-
hensive of the danger of it.
Be that as it would, we were obliged to go on shore some-
where or other for water, for we had not a pint left in the
boat: when or where to get to it, was the point. Xury said if I
would let him go on shore with one of the jars, he would
find if there was any water, and bring some to me. I asked
him why he would go, why I should not go, and he stay in
the boat. The boy answered wilh so much affection that
made me love him ever after. Says he, ' If wild mans come,
they eat me; you go wey.' ' Well, Xury,' said I, ' we will
both go, and if the wild mans come, we will kill them: they
shall eat neither of us.' So 1 gave Xury a piece of rusk bread
to eat, and a dram out of our patron's case of bottles, which
I mentioned before, and we hauled the boat in as near the shore
'.
Xrmr shootexg thk Lio>i
as we thought was proper, and waded on shore, carrying
nothing but our arms, and two jars for water.
I did not care to go out of sight of the boat, fearing the
coming of canoes with savages down the river: but the boy
seeing a low place, about a mile up the country, rambled to
it, and by and by I saw him come running towards me. I
thought he was pursued by some savages, or frightened by
some wild beast, and I ran forward towards him to help him;
but when I came nearer to him, I saw something hanging over
his shoulders, which was a creature that he had shot, like a
hare, butdifferentin colour, and longer legs. However, we were
very glad of it, and it was very good meat; but the great joy that
poor Xury came with, was to tell me he had found good wa-
ter, and seen no wild mans.
But we found afterwards that we need not take such pains
for water, for a little higher up the creek where we were,
we found the water fresh when the tide was out, which flows
but a little way up: so we filled our jars and feasted on the
hare we had killed, and prepared to go on our way, having
seen no footsteps of any human creature in that part of the
country. .
As I had been one voyage to the coast before, I knew
very well that the islands of the Canaries, and the Cape de Verd
islands also, lay not far off from the coast. But as I had no
instruments to take an observation to know what latitude we
were in, and did not exactly know, or at least not remember,
what latitude they were in, I knew not where to look for
them, or when to stand off to sea towards them; otherwise I
might now easily have found some cf these islands. But
my hope was, that if I stood along this coast till 1 came to
that part where. the English traded, I should find some of
their vessels upon their usual design of trade, that would re-
lieve and take us in.
By the best of my calculation, that place where I now
was, must be that country which, lying between the emperor
of Morocco's dominions and the Negroes, lies waste and un-
inhabited, except by wild beasts, the Negroes having aban-
doned it, and gone farther south, for fear of the Moors; and
the Moors not thinking it worth inhabiting, by reason of its
barrenness, and indeed both forsaking it because of the pro-
digious numbers of tigers, lions, leopards, and other furious
creatures which harbour there, so that the Moors use it for
C
their hunting only, where they go like an army, two or three
thousand men at a time; and indeed for near a hundred miles
together upon this coast, we saw nothing but a waste uninha-
bited country by day, and heard nothing but howlings and
roarings of wild beasts by night.
Once or twice in the day-time, I thought I saw the Pico
of Teneriffe, being the high top ot the mountain Teneriffe
in the Canaries, and had a great mind to venture out in hopes
of reaching thither; but having tried twice, I was forced in
again by contrary winds, the sea also going too high for my
little vessel; so I resolved to pursue my first design; and keep
along the shore.
Several times we were obliged to land for fresh water, af-
ter we had left this place; and once in particular, being ear-
ly in the morning, we came to an anchor under a little point
of land, which was pretty high, and the tide beginning to
flow, we lay still to go farther in. Xury, whose eyes were
more about him, than it seems mine were, calls softly to me,
and tells me that we had best go farther off, the shore,
* For,' says he, ' look, yonder lies a dreadful monster on the
side of that hillock, fast asleep.' I looked where he pointed,
and saw a dreadful monster indeed; for it was a terrible great
lion, that lay on the side of the shore, under the shade ot a
piece of the hill, that hung as it were a little over him,
' Xury,' said I, ' you shall go on shove, and kill him.' Xury
looked frighted, and said, ' Me kill! He eat me at one
mouth!' at one mouthful he meant. However I said no more
to the boy, but bade him be still, and took our biggest gun,
•which was almost musket-bore, and loaded it with a good
charge of powder, and with two slugs, and laid it down; then
1 loaded another gun with two bullets, and the third (for we
had three pieces) 1 loaded with five smaller bullets. I took
the best aim I could with the first piece, to have shot him in
the head; hut hclaysowith hislegraised a little above his nose,
that the slug hit his leg about the knee, and broke the bone.
He started up growling at first, but finding his leg broke,
fell down again, and then got upon three legs, and gave he
most hideous roar that ever 1 heard. I was a little surprised
that I had not hit him on the head: however, ! took np the
second piece immediately; and, though he be .an to move off,
fired a^ain, and shot him Into the head, antl had the pleasure
to see him drop, and making very little noise, he lay strug-
ghng for life. Then Xury took heart, and would have me
let him go on shore. ' Well, go,' said I. So. the boy jump*
cd into the water, and taking a little gun in one hand, swam
to shore with the dther hand, and coming close to the crea-
ture, put the muzzle of the piece to his ear, and shot him
into the head again, which despatched him quite >
This was game indeed to us, but this was no food; and I
was very sorry to lose three charges of powder and shot upon
a creature that was good for nothing to us. However, Xury
said he would have some of him: so he comes on board, and
asked me to give him the hatchet. ' For what, Xury?' said I.
' Me cut off his head,' said he. However, Xuiy could nof
cut off his head, but he cut off a foot, and brought it with
him, and it was a monstrous great one.
I bethonght myself, however, that perhaps the skin of him
might one way or other be of some value to us; and 1 resol-
ved to take off his skin if I,could. So Xury and I went to
work with him, but Xury was much the better workman at
it, for I knew very ill how to do it. Indeed it took us up
both the whole day; but at last we got off the hide of him,
and, spreading it on the top of our cabin, the sun effectually
drjed it in two days time, and it afterwards served me to lie upon.
After this stop we made on to the southward continually,
for ten or twelve days. living very sparingly on our provisions,
-which began to abate very much, and going no oftener in to
the shore than we were obliged to, for fresh water. My de-
sign in this was to make the river Gambia or Senegall, that
is to say, any where about the Cape de Verd, where I was
in hopes to meet with some European ship; and if I did not,
I knew not what course I had to take, but to seek for the
islands, or perish there among the Negroes. I knew that all
the ships from Europe, which sailed either to the coast of
Guinea, or to Brasil, or to the East Indies, made this cape
or those islands, and, in a word, I put the whole of my for-
tune upon this single point, either that I must meet with
some ship or must perish.
When I had pursued this resolution about ten days longer,
as I have said, 1 began to see that the land was inhabited;
and in two or three places, as we sailed by, we saw people
stand upon the shore 1o look at us: we could also perceive
they were quite black, and stark naked. 1 was once inclined
to have gone on shore to them, but Xury was my better
counsellor, and said to me. ' No go, no go.' However, I
hauled in nearer the shore that I might talk to them, and 1
{bund they ran along the shore by me a good way. I ob-
served they had no weapons in their hands, except one, who
had a long slender stick, which Xury said was a lance, and
that they would throw them a great way with good aim: so
I kept at a distance, but talked with them by signs as well as I
could, and particularly made signs for something to eat They
beckoned to me to stop my boat, and they would fetch me
some meat. Upon this I lowered the top of my sail, and lay
by, and two of them ran up into the country, and in less than
half an hour came back and brought with them two pieces of
dry flesh, and some corn, such as is the produce of their
country; but we neither knew what the one or the other was:
however, we were willing to accept it. But how to come at
it, was our next dispute, for I was not for venturing on shore
to them, and they were as much afraid of us; but they took a
safe way for us all, for they brought it to the shore, and laid
it down, and went and stood a great way off, till we fetched
it on board, and then came close to us again.
We made signs of thanks to them, for we had nothing to
make them amends; but an opportunity offered that very in-
stant to oblige them wonderfully; for while we were lying by
the shore, came two mighty creatures, one pursuing the other
(as we took it) with great fury, from the mountams towards
the sea: whether it was the male pursuing the female, or
whether they were in sport or in rage, we could not tell any
more than we could tell whether it was usual or strange; but
I believe it was the latter, because, in the first place, those ra-
venous creatures seldom appear but in the night; and, in the
second place we found the people terribly frighted, especially
the women The man that had the lance or dart did not fly
from them, but the rest did. However, as the two oreatures
ran directly into the water, they did not seem to offer to fall
upon the Negroes, but plunged themselves into the sea, and
swam about as if they had come for their diversion; at last
one of them began to come nearer our boat than at first I ex-
pected, but I lay ready for him, for I had loaded my gun
with all possible expedition, and bade Xury load both the
others. As soon as he came fairly within my reach, I fired,
and shot him directly into the head. Immediately he sunk
down into the water, but he rose instantly, and plunged ups
and down as if he was struggling for life; and so indeed he
was He immediately made to the shore; but, between the
wound, which was his mortal hurt, and the strangling of the
water, he died just before he reached the shore
It is impossible to express the astonishment of these poor
creatures at the noise and fire of my gun: some of them were
ready even to die for fear, and fell down as dead with the
very terror. Rut when they saw the creature dead, and sunk
in the water, and that I made signs to them to come to the
shore, they took heart. and came to the shore, and began to
search for the creature. I found him by his blood staining
tiie water, and by the help of a rcpei which I flung round
him, and gave the Negroes to haul, they dragged him on
shore, and found that it was u most curious leopard, spotted
and fine to an admirable degree; and the Negroes held up
their hands with admiration to think what it was I killed
him with
The other creature, frighted with the flash of fire, and the
noiso of the gun, swam to the shore, and ran up directly to
the mountains, from whence they came, nor-could I at that
distance know what it was. 1 found quickly the Ni groes
were for eating the flesh of this creature, so 1 was willing to
have them take-it as a favour from me, which when I made
signs to them that they might take him they were very
thankful for. Immediately they fell to work with him, and
though they had no knife, yet with a sharpened piece of
wood they took off- his skin as readily, nay, much more readi-
ly than we would have done with a knife. They offered me
some of the flesh, which I declined, making as if I would
give it them, but made signs for the skin, which they gave
me very freely, and brought me a great deal more of their
provision, which though I did not understand, yet I accepted.
Then I made signs to them for some water, and held out
one of my jars to them turning it bottom upward, to show
that it was empty, and that I wanted to have it filled. They
called immediately to some of their friends, and there came
two women, and brought a great vessel made of earth, and
burnt, as I suppose, in the sun: this they set down for me, as
before, and I sent Xury on shore with my jars, and filled
them all three. The women were stark naked as the men.
I was now furnished with roots and corn, such as it was,
and water; and, leaving my friendly Negroes, I made for-
02
ward for about eleven days more, without offering to go
near the shore, till I saw the land run out a great length
into the sea, at about the distance of four or five leagues be-
fore me, and, the sea being very calm, I kept a large offmg
to make this point; at length, doubling the point at about two
leagues from the land, I saw plainly land on the other side to
seaward; then I concluded, as it was most certain indeed, that
this was the Cape de Vcrd, and those the islands, called
from thence Cape de Verd Islands. However, they were at
a great distance, and I could not well tell what"! had best to
do; for if I should be taken with a fresh of wind, I might nei-
ther reach one nor the other.
In this dilemma, as I was very pensive, I stepped into the
cabin, and sat me down, Xury having the helm, when on a
sudden the boy cried out' Master master, a ship was a sail!'
and the foolish boy was frighted out of his wits, thinking it must
needs be some of his master's ships sent to pursue us, when I
knew we were gotten far enough out of their reach. I jump-
ed out of the cabin, and immediately saw not only the ship,
but what she was; viz. that it was a Portuguese ship, anil as,
I thought was bound to the coast of Guinea for Negroes.
But when I observed the course she steered, I was soon con-
vinced they were bound some other way, and did not design
to go any nearer to the shore, upon which I stretched out to
sea as much as I could, resolving to speak with them, if pos-
sible.
With all the sail I could make, I found I should not be able
to come in their way, but that they would be gone by before
I could make any. signal to them; but after I had crowded to
the utmost, and began to despair, they, it seems, saw me by
the help of their perspective-glasses, and that it was some
European boat, which they supposed must belong to some
ship that was lost; so they shortened sail to let me come
up. I was encouraged with this, and as I had my patron's
ancient on board, I made a waft of it to them for a signal
of distress, and fired a gun, both which they saw; for they
told me they saw the smoke, though they did not hear the
gun. Upon these signals they very kindly brought to, and
lay by for me, and in about three hours time I came up with
them.
They asked me what I was in Portuguese, and in Spanish,
and in French; but I understood none of them; but at last a
Scots sailor, who was on board, called to me, and I answered
him, and told him I was an Englishman, that I had made
my escape out of slavery from the Moors at Sallee. Then
they bade me come on board, and very kindly took me in,
and all my goods.
It was an inexpressible joy to me, that any one will believe
that I was thus delivered, as I esteemed it, from such a mi-
serable and almost hopeless condition as I was in. 1 imme-
diately offered all I had to the captain of the ship, as a return
for my deliverance; but lie generously told me, he would
take nothing from me, but that all f had should be delivered
safe to me when I came to the Brasils. ' For,' says he, ' I
. have saved your life on no other terms than as I would be
glad to be saved myself; and it may one time or other be my
lot to be taken up in the same condition. ' Besides,' 6ays he,
'when 1 carry you to the Brasils, so great a way from your
own country, if I should take from you what little you have,
you will he starved there, and then I only take away that life
I have given.' 'No; no,' says he, ' Signor Inglese [Mr. En-
glishman], I will carry you thither in charity, and these
things will help you to buy your subsistence there, and your
passage home again.'
As he was charitable in this proposal, so he was just in the
performance to a tittle; for he ordered the seamen that none
should offer to touch any thing I had: then he took every
thing into his own possession, and gave hack me an exact in-
ventory of them, that I might have ihem again, even so much
as my three earthen jars.
As to my boat, it was a very good one, and that he saw,
and told me he would buy it of me for the ship's use, and
asked me what I would have for it. I told him he had been
so generous to me in every thing, that I could not offer to
make any price of the boat, but left it entirely to him; upon
which he told me he would give me a note of his hand to pay
me SO pieces of eight for it at Brasil, aud when it came there,
if any one offered to give more, he would make it up. He
offered me also GO pieces of eight more for my boy, Xury,
which I was loath to take; not that I was not willing to let the
captain have him, but I was very loath to sell the poor boy's
liberty, who had assisted me so faithfully in procuring my
own. However, when I let him know my reason, he owned
it to be just, and offered me this medinm, that he would give
tlie hoy an obligation to set him free in ten years, if he turn-
ed Christian. Upon this, Xury saying he was willmg to go to
him, I let the captain have him
We had a very good voyage to the Brasils, and arrived in
the Bay de todos los Santos, or All-Saints Bay. in about twen-
ty-two days after And now I was once more delivered from
the most miserable of all conditions of life; and what to do
next with myself, I was to consider.
The generous treatment the captain gave me, I can never
enough remember: he would take nothing of me for my pas-
sage, gave me 20 ducats for the leopard's skin and 40 for the
lion's skin, winch I had in the boat, and caused every thing
I had in the ship to be punctually delivered me; and what I
.was willing to sell, he nought, such as the case of bottles, two
of my guns. and a piece of the lump of bees-wax, for I
had made candles of the rest: in a word, I made about 220
pieces of eight of all my cargo, and with this stock I went oh
shore in the Brasiis
I had not been long here, but being recommended to the
house of a good honest man like himself, who had an ingenio,
as they call it, that is, a plantation and a sugar-house, I lived
-with him some time, and acquainted myself by that means
-with the manner of their planting and making of sugar; and
seeing how well the planters lived, and how they grew rich
suddenly, I resolved, if I could get license to settle there, I
would turn planter among them; resolving, in the meantime,
to find out some way to gel my money which I had left in
London remitted to me To this purpose, getting a kind of
a letter of naturalization, I purchased as much land that was
Cmcured as my money would reach, and formed a plan for
my plantation and settlement, and such a one as might be
suitable to the stock which I proposed to myself to receive
from England
I had a neighbour, a Portuguese of Lisbon. but born of En-
glish parents, v. hose name was Wells, and in much such cir-
cumstances as I was I call him neighbour, because his plan-
tation lay nextto mine, and we went on very sociably together:
my slock was but low as well as his, and we rather planted for
food than any thing else for about two years However, we
began to increase, and our land began to come into order, so
that the third -ear we planted some tobacco and made each
of us a large piece of ground ready for planting canes in the
year to come; but we both wanted help, and now I found,
more than before, I had done wrong in parting with my boy,
Xury.
But, alas! for me to do wrong that never did right, was no
great wonder. I had no reme<ly but to go on I was gotten
into an employment quite remote to my genius, and directly
contrary to the life I delighted in, and for which I forsook my
father's house, and broke through all his good advice; nay, I
was coming into the very middle station, or upper degree of
low life, which my father advised me to before, and which if
I resolved to go (m with, I might as well have staid at home,
and never fatigued myself in the world, as I have done: and I
used often to say to myself, I could have done this as well in
England among my friends, as have gone 5000 miles off to do
it among strangers and savages, in a wilderness, and at such a
distance as never to hear from any part of the world that had
the least knowledge of me.
In this manner I used to look upon my condition with the
utmost regret. I had nobody to converse with, but now and
then this neighbour: no work to be done but by the labour of
my hands; and I used to say, I.lived just like a man cast
away upon some desolate island, that had nobody there but
himself. But how just has it been, and bow should all men
reflect, that, when they compare their present condition with
others that are worse, Heaven may oblige them to make the
exchange, and be convinced of their former felicity, by their
experience! I say, how just has it been, that the truly solitary
life I reflected on in an island of mere desolation should be my
lot, who had so often unjustly compared it with the life which
I then led, in which, had I continued, I had, in all probability,
been exceedingly prosperous and rich!
I was in some degree settled in my measures for carrying
on the plantation, before my kind friend, the captain of the
ship that took me up at sea, went back; for the ship remain-
ed there in providing her loading and preparing for her
.voyage, near three months; when tellmg him what little stock
I had left behind me in London, he gave nre this friendly and
smoere advice: 'Signor Inglese,' says he (for so he always
called me), 'if you will give me letters, and a procuration
here in form to me, with orders to the person who has your
money in London, to send your elTccts to Lisbon, to such per-
sons as 1 shall direct, and such goods as are proper for this
country, I will bring you the produce of them, God willing,
at my return* but since human affairs are all subject to Chan-
ges and disasters, I would have you give orders but for 100?.
sterling, which, you say, is half your stock, and let the httzard
be run for the first, so that if it come safe, you may order the
rest the same way, and if it miscarry, you may have the other
half to have recourse to for ycui supply .- //' -*
This was so wholesome advice, and looked so friendly, that
T cnuld not but be convinced it was the best course I could
take: so I accordingly prepared letters to the gentlewoman
with whom 1 had left my money, and a procuration to the
Portuguese captain as he desired.
I wrote the English captain's widow a full account of all
my adventures, my slavery, escape, and how I had met with
the Portugal captain at sea, the humanity of his behaviour,
and what condition I was now in, with all other necessary di-
rections for my supply; and when tins honest captain came
to Lisbon, he found means. by some of the English merchants
there, to send over not the order only, but a full account of
my story, to a merchant at London, who presented it effec-
tually to her, whereupon she not only delivered the-money,
but out of her own pocket se*t the Portugal captain a very
handsome present for his humanity and charity to me
The merchant in London vested this 100/. in English
goods, such as the captain had written for, sent them direct-
ly to him at Lisbon, and he brought them all safe to me to
the Brasils; among which, without my direction (for 1 was
too young in my business to think of them), he had taken
care to have all sorts of tools, iron work, and utensils neces-
sary for my plantation, and which were of great use to me.
When this cargo arrived, I thought- my fortune made, for
I was surprised with the joy of it. and my good stewart, the
captain, had laid out the 5/ which my friend had sent him for
a present for himself, to purchase and bring me over a ser-
vant, under bond for six years' service. and would not ac-
cept of any consideration except a little tobacco, which I
would have him accept, being of my own produce.
Neither was this all. but my goods being all English manu-
factures, such as cloth, stuff, batze, and things particularly
valuable and desirable m the country. I found means to sell
them to a very great advantage; so that I may say, I had
more than low times the value of my first cargo, and was
now infinitely beyond my poor neighbour, I mean in the ad-
vancement of my plantation; for- the first thing I did, I
bought me a Negro slave ajid an European servant also : I
mean another besides that which the captain brought me
from Lisbon.
But as abased prosperity is oftentimes made the very means
of our .greatest adversity, so was it with me 1 went ou the
next year with great success in my plantation: I raised fifty
great rolls of tobacco on my own ground, more than I had
disposed of for necessaries among my neighbours, and these
fifty rolls being each of above 100 lb. weight, were well -cured
and laid by agamst the return of the fleet from Lisbon. And
now increasing in business and wealth, my head began to be
full of projects and undertakings beyond my reach, such as
are indeed often the ruin of the best heads "m business.
had I continued in the station 1 was now in, I had room
for all the happy things to have yet befallen me, for which
my lather so earnestly recommended a quiet retired life, and
which he had so sensibly described the middle station of life
to be full of; but other things attended me, and I was still to
be trie wilful agent of all my own miseries: and particularly
to mcrease my fault, and double the reflections upon myself
which in my future sorrows I should have leisure to make. all
these miscarriages were procured by my apparent obstinate
adhering to my foolish inclination of wandering abroad, and
pursuing that inclination in contradiction to the clearest
views of doing myself good in a fair and plain pursuit of
those prospects, and those measures of life, which Nature
and Providence concurred to present me with, and to make
my duty. " --
As I had once done thus in breaking away from my pa-
rents so 1 could not be content now; but I must go and leave
the happy view I had of being.a rich and thriving man in my
new plantation, and to pursue a rash and immoderate desire
of rismg faster ihan the nature of the thing admitted; and
thus I cast myself down again into the deepest gulf of human.
misery that'ever man fell into, or perhaps could be cousia-
tent with life, and a state of health in the world.
To come then by just degrees to the particulars of this part
of my story. You may suppose that having now lived almost
four years in the lirasils, and beginning to thrive and prosper
very well upon my plantation, I had not only learned the
language, but had contracted acquaintance and friendship
among my fellow-planters, as well as among the merchants at
St. Salvadore, which was our port? and that, in my discourse
among them, 1 had frequently given them an account of my
two voyages to the coast of Guinea, the manner of trading
with the Negroes there, and how easy it wastQ purchase upon.
the coast, for trifles, such as heads, toys, knives, scissars, hat-
chets, bits of glass, and the like, not only gold dust, Guinea-
grains, elephants' teeth, &c. but Negroes for the service of
the Brasils, in great numbers.
They listened always very attentively to my discourses on
these heads, but especially to that part which related to the
buying of Negroes, which was a trade at that time not only
not far entered into, but as far as it was, had been parried on
by the assientos, or permission of the kings of Spain and
Portugal, and engrossed in the public stock, so that few Ne.
groes were bought, and those excessive dear.
It happened, being in company one day with some mer-
chants and planters of my acquaintance, and talking of those
things very earnestly, three of them came to me the next
morning, and told me they had been musing very much upon
what I had discoursed of with them the last night, and they
came to make a secret proposal to mej and, after enjoining
me secrecy, they told me that they had a mind to fit out a
ship to go to Guinea; that they had all plantations as well as
I, and were straitened for nothing so much as servants; that
as it was a trade that could not be carried on, because they
could not publicly sell the Negroes when they came home, so
they desired to make but one voyage, to bring the Negroes
on shore privately, and divide them among their own planta-
tions; and, in a word, the question was, whether I Would go
their supercargo in the ship, to manage the trading part upon
the coast of Guinea? and they offered me that I should have
my equal share of the Negroes without providing any |>art of
the stock.
This was a fair proposal, it must be confessed, had it been
made to any one that had not had a settlement and planta-
tion of his own to look after, which was in a fair way of com-
ing to be very considerablev and with a good stock upon it.
But for me that was thus established, and had nothing to
do but go on as I had begun for three or four years more,
and to have sent for the other lQQl. from England, and who
e
in that time, and with that little addition, could scarce have
failed of being worth 3 or 4O0tW. sterling, and that increasing
too; for me to think of such a voyage, was the most prepos«
terous thing that ever man, in such circumstances could be
guilty of
But I, that was born to be my own destroyer, could no
more resist the offer, than 1 could restrain my first rambling
designs, when my father's good counsel was lost upon me. In
a word, I told them 1 would go with all my heart, if they
would undertake to look after my plantation in my absence,
and would dispose of it to such as I should direct, if I miscar-
ried. This they all engaged to do, and entered into wiytings
or covenants to do so; and I made a formal will, disposing of
iy plantation and effects, in case of my death, making the
iptain of the ship that had saved my life, as before, my uni-
ersal heir, but obliging him to dispose of my effects as t had
directed in my will: one half of the produce being to himself,
and the other to be shipped to England.
In short, I tyiok all possible caution to preserve my effects,
and to keep up my plantation Had I used half as much pru-
dence to have looked mto my own interest, and have made a
judgment of what I ought to have done, and not to have
done, I had certainly never gone away from so prosperous
an undertaking, leaving all the probable views of a thrivmg
circumbtance, and gone upon a voyage to sea, attended with
all its comm^i hazards, to say nothing of the reasons 1 had
to expect particular misfortunes to myself.
But I was hurried on, and obeyed blindly the dictates of
my fancy, rather than my reason; and, accordingly, tho
ship being fitted out, and the cargo furnished, and all things
done as by agreement by my partners in the voyage, I went
ron board in an evil hour again, the 1st of September, 1G59,
being the same day eight years that I went from my father
and mother at Hull, in order to Set the rebel to their autho-
rity, and the fool to my own interest.
Our ship was about 120 tons burden, carried six gaps, and
fourteen men, besides the master, his boy, and myself We
had on board no largi cargo of goods, except of such toys as
were fit for our trade with the negroes, such as beads, bits of
glass, shells, and odd trifles, especially little looking-glasses,
luitvcs, scissars, liattlicts, and the like.
D
The same day I went on board, we set sail, standing away
to the northward upon our own coast, with design to stretch
over for the African coast, when they came into about
ten or twelve degrees of northern latitude, which, it seems,
was the manner of their course in those days. We had very
good weather, only excessive hot all the way upon our own
coast, till we came to the height uf Cape St. Augustino, from
whence keeping farther off at sea, we lost sight of land, and
steered as if we were bound for the Isle of Fernand de No-
ronba, holding our course N.E. by N. and leaving those isles
on the east In this course we passed the line in about twelve
days' time, and were, by our last observation, in 7 degrees
22 minutes, northern latitude, when a violent tornado or hur-
ricane took us quite out of our knowledge: it began from ihe
southeast, came about to the northwest, and then settle*
into the north-east, from whence it blew in such a terribl
manner that for twelve days together we could do nothing
but drive; and scudding away before it, let it carry us where-
ever fate and the fury of the winds directed: and during these
twelve days, 1 need not say that I expected every day to be
swallowed up, nor did any in the ship expect to save their
.lives. . I
In this distress we had, besides the terror of the storm,
one of our men died of the calenture and one man and.
the bov washed overboard. About the twelfth day, the wea.
ther abating a little, the master made an observation as
well as he could, and found that he was in about 11 degrees
of north latitude, but that be was 22 degrees of longitude dif-
ference west iVoiu Cape St. August ino, so that he found he
was gotten upon the coast of Guiaua, or the north part of
Israsil, beyond the river Amazones, towards that of the rive
Oronnoque, commonly called the Great River: and now he1
began to consult wilh me what course he should take, for the
ship was leaky, and very much disabled, and he was for go-
ing directly back to the coast of Brasil.
I was positively against that; and, looking over the charts
of the sea-coast of America with him, we concluded there was
no inhabited country for us to have recourse to, till we came
within the circle of the Caribbee Islands, and therefore resolved
to stand away for Barhadoes, which, by keeping off at sea, to
avoid the in-draugbt of the Bay or Gulf of Mexico, we might
easily perform, as we hoped, in about fifteen days' sail:
whereas we eoulil not possibly make our voyage to the coast
of Africa, without some assistance both to our ship, and to
ourselves.
With this design, we changed our course, and steered
away N.W. by W. in order to reach some of our English
islands, where I hoped for relief; but our voyage was other-
wise determined: for, being in the latitude of V2 degrees, 18
minutes, a second storm came upon us, which carried us
away with the same impetuosity westward, and drove us so
out of the very way of all human commerce, that had all our
lives been saved, as to the sea, we were rather in danger of
being devoured by savages, than ever returning to our own
country.
In this distress, the wind still blowing very hard, one of ouv
men, early one morning cried out, 'Land!' and we had no
sooner run out of the cabin to look out, in hopes of seeing
whereabouts in the world we were, but the ship struck upon
a sand, and, in a moment, her motion being so stopped, the
sea broke over her in such a manner that we expected we
should all have perished immediately; and we were even driven
into our close quarters, to shelter us from the very foam and
spray of the sea.
It is not easy for any one, who has not been in the 'ike
condition, to describe or conceive the consternation of men
,7\ In such circumstances. We knew nothmg where we were,
pr upon what land it was we were driven, whether an island
or the main, whether inhabited or not inhabited; and as the
rage of the wind.was still great, though rather less than at
first, we could not so much as hope to have the ship hold
many minutes without breasing in pieces, unless the winds,
ybt by a kind of miracle, should turn immediately about In a
Jm word, we sat looking one upon another, and expecting death
every moment, and every man acting accordingly, as prepar-
ing for another world, for there was little or nothing more
for us to do in this: that which was our present comfort, and
all the comfort we had, was that, contrary to our expectation,
the ship did not break yet, and that the master said the wind
began to abate.
Now, though we thought that the wind did a little abate,
yet the ship having thus struck upon the sand, and sticking too
fast for us to expect her getting off, we were in a dreadful
condition indeed, and had nothing to do but to think of" saving
our lives as well as we could. We had a boat at our stern,
just before the storm, but she was first staved by dashing
against the ship's rudder, and in the next place she broke
away, and either sunk or was driven off to sea, so there
was -io hope from her. We had another boat on board, but
how to get her off into the sea, was a doubtful thing How.
. ever, there was no room to debate, for we fancied the ship
would break in pieces every minute; and some told us she
Was actually broken already.
In this distress, the mate of our vessel lays hold of the
boat, and with the help of the rest of the men, they got her
flung over the ship's side, and getting all into her, let go, and
committed ourselves, being eleven in number, to God's mer-
cy, and the wild sea; for though the storm was abated consi-
derably, yet the sea went dreadfully high upon the shore, .
and might well be called, ' Den wild zee,' as the Dutch call
the sea in a storm.
And now our case was very dismal indeed, for we all saw
plainly that th^e sea went so high, that the boat could not es-
cape, and that we should be inevitably drowned As to
making sail, we had none; nor if we had, could we have done
any thing with it; so we worked at the oar towards the land,
though with heavy hearts, like men going to execution; for
we all knew, that when the boat came near the shore, she
would be dashed in a thousand pieces, by the breach of
the sea. However, we committed our souls to God in the
most earnest manner, and the wind driving us towards the
shore, we hastened our destruction with our own hands,
pulling, as well as we could, towards land
What the shore was whether rock or sand, whether steep
or sho»l, we knew not; the only hope that could rationally
give us the least shadow of expectation, was, if we might
happen into some bay or gulf, or the mouth of some river,
-where, by great chance, we might have run our boat in, or
got under the lee of the land, and perhaps made smooth
water. But there was nothing of this appeared; but as we
made nearer and nearer the shore, the land looked more
frightful than the sea
After we had rowed or rather driven, about a league and
a half, as we reckoned it, a raging wave, mountain like, came
rolling astern of us, and plainty bade us expect the ' coup de
trace.' Jbri a word, it took us with such a fury, that it over-
-\
set the boat at once, and separating us as well from the boat
as from one another, gave us not time hardly to say,' O God!'
for we were all swallowed up in a moment.
Nothing can describe the confusion of thought which I felt
when I sunk into the water, for though 1 swam very well,
yet I could not deliver myself from the waves so as to draw
breath, till that wave having driven me, or rather carried me
a vast way on towards the shore, and having spent itself,
went back, and left me upon the land almost dry, but half
dead with the water I took in. I had so much presence of
mind, as well as breath left, that seeing myself nearer the
main land than I expected, I got upon my feet, and endea-
voured to make on towards the land, as fast as I could, before
another wave should return, and take me up again. But I
soon found it was impossible to avoid it, for I saw the sea
come after me as high as a great hill, and as furious as an
enemy, which I bad no means or strength to contend with;
my business was to h61d my breath, and raise myself upon
the water, if I could, and so by swimming to preserve my
breathing, and pilot myself towards the shore, if possible; my
greatest concern now being that the wave, as it would carry
me a great way towards the shore when it came on, might
not carry me back again with it, when it gave back towards
the sea
The wave that came upon me again, buried me at once
twenty or thirty feet deep in its own body, and I could feel
myself carried with a mighty force a»d swiftness towards the
shore a very great way; but I held my breath, and assisted
myself to swim still forward with all my might 1 was ready
to burst with holding my breath, when, as I felt myself rising
up, so to my immediate relief, I found my head and hands
shoot out above the surface of the water; and though it was
not two seconds of time that I could keep myself so, yet it
relieved me greatly, gave me breath and new courage 1 was
covered again with water a good while, but not so long but I
held it out, and findmg the water had spent itself, and began
to return, I struck forward against the return of the waves,
and felt ground again with my feet. I stood still a few mo-
ments to recover breath, and till the water went from me,
and then I took to rny heels, and ran witli what strength I
had, farther towards the shore. But neither would this deli-
ver me from the fury of the sea, which came pouring in after
I) 2
me again, and twice more I was lifted up by the waves, and
carriei forwards as before,: the shore being very flat.
The last time of these two had well near been fatal to me;
for the sea having hurried me along as before, landed me, or
rather dashed me, against a piece of a rock, and that with such
force as it left me senseless, and indeed helpless, as to toy
own deliverance; for the blow taking my side and breast,
beat the breath, as it were, quite out of my body, and had it
-returned again immediately, I must have been strangled in
the water; but I recovered a little before the return of the
waves, and seeing I should be covered again with the water,
I resolved to hold fast by a piece of the rock, and so to hold
my breath, if possible, till the wave went back. Now, as
the waves were not so high as at first, being near land, I held
my hold till the wave abated, and then fetched another run,
which brought me so rear the shore, that the next wave, though
it went over me, yet did not so swallow me up as to carry
me away; and the next run I took, I got to the main land,
where to my great comfort, I clambered up the cliffs of the
shore, and sat me down upon the grass, free from danger,
and quite out of the reach of the water
1 was now landed and safe on shore, and began to look up
and thank God that my life was saved, in a case wherein
there was some minutes before scarce any room to hope. . I
believe it is impossible to express to the life, what the ecsta-
sies and transports of the soul are when it is so saved, as I may
' say, out of the very grave: and 1 do not wonder now at lhat
custom, viz. that when a malefactor, who has the halter
about his neck, is tied up, and just going to be turned off, anil
lias a reprieve brought to him; 1 say, I do not wonder that
they bring a surgeon with it, to let him blood that very mo-
ment they tell him of it, that the surprize may not drive the
animal spirits from the heart, and overwhelm him:
For sudden joys, like griefs, confound at first.
I walked about on the shore, lifting up my hands, and my
whole being. as I may say, wrapt up in the contemplation of
my deliverance, making a thousand gestures and motions
which I cannot describe, reflecting upon all my comradesthat
were drowned, and that there should not be one soul saved
hut myself: for, as for litem, I never saw them afterwards, or

«ny sign of them, except three of their hats, one cap, and
tvio shoes that were not fellows.
I cast my eyes to the stranded vessel, when the hreach and
froth of the sea being so big, I eould hardly see it, it lay so
far off: and considered, Lord! how was it possible 1 could get
on shore! *-
After I had solaced my mind with the comfortable part of
my condition, I began to look round me, to see what kind of
place I was in, and what was next to he done, and I soon
found my comforts abate, and that in a word, I had a dread-
ful deliverance for I was wet, had no clothes to shift me,
nnr any thing either to eat or drink to comfort me, neither
did I see any prospect before me, but that of perishing w ith
hunger, or being devoured by wild beasts; and that which
-was particularly afflictmg to me, was, that I had no weapon
either to hunt and kill any creature for my sustenance, or to
defend myself against any other creature that might desire
to kill me for theirs. In a word, I had nothing about me but
. a knife, a tobacco-pipe, and a little tobacco in a box; this was
all my prevision, and this threw me into terrible agouies of
mind| that for a while I ran about like a madman. Night
coming upon me, I began, with a heavy heart, to consider
what would be my lot, if there were any ravenous beasts in
that country, seeing at night they always come abroad for
their prey.
All the remedy that offered to my thoughts at that time-
was, to get up into a thick bushy tree, like a fir, but thorny,
which grew near me, and where I resolved to sit all night,
and consider the next day what death I should die; for, as yet,
I saw no prospect of life. I walked about a furlong from the
shore, to see if I could find any fresh water to drink, which T
did to my great joy; and having drank, and put a little to-
bacco m my mouth, to prevent hunger, I went to the tree,
and getting up into it, endeavoured to place myself so as that
if I should sleep, I might not fall; and having cut me a short
stick like a truncheon, for my defence, I took up my lodg-
ing; and having been excessively fatigued, I fell fast asleep,
and slept as comfortably as I believe few could have done in
my condition; and found myself the most refreshed with it
that 1 think I ever was on such occasion.
When I waked, it was broad day, the weather clear, and
the storm abated, so that the sea did not rage and swell a«
^
before; but that which surprised me most, was, that the ship
-was lifted off, in the night, from the sand where she lay, by
the swelling of the tide, and was driven up almost as far as the
rock, which I first mentioned, where I had been so bruised
by the dashing me against it. This being within about a mile
from the shore where I was, and the ship seeming to stand
upright still, I wished myself onboard, that, at least, I might
save some necessary things for myuse.
When I came down from my apartment in the tree, 1
looked about me again, and the first thing I found was the
boat, which lay as the wind and the sea had tossed her upon
the land, about two miles on my right hand. I walked as far
as I could upon the shore, to have got to her, but found a
neck or inlet of water between me and the boat, which was
about half a mile broad; so I came back for the present, being
more intent upon getting at the ship, where I hoped to find
something for my present subsistence.
A little after noon I found the sea Tery calm, and the tide
ebbed so far out, that I could come within a quarter of a mile '
of the ship; 'and here I found a fresh renewing of my grief;
fori saw evidently that if we had kept on board we bad-been.
all safe, that is to say, we had all got safe on shore, and I had not
been so miserable as to be left entirely destitute of all comfort
and company, as I now was. This forced tears from my
eyes again; but as there was little relief in that, I resolved, if
possible, to get to the ship; sol pulled off my clothes, for the
weather was hot to extremity, and took the water; but,
when I came to the ship, my difficulty was still greater to
know how to get on board; for as she lay aground, and high
out of the water, there was nothing within my reach to lay hold
of. I swam round her twice, and the second time I espied a
small piece of rope, which I wondered I did not see at first,
hang down by the fore-chains, so low as that with great diffi-
culty I got hold of it, and, by the help of that rope, got up into
the forecastle of the ship. Here I found that the ship was
bulged, and had a great deal of water in her hold, but that she
lay so on the side of a bank of hard sand, or rati er eai _h, that
her stern lay lifted up upon the bank, and her head low al-
most to the water; by this means all her quarter was free,
and all that was in that part was dry; for you may be sure my
first work was to search and to see what was spoiled, and
what was free; and first I found that all the ship's provisions
were dry and untouched by the waters and being Terv well
disposed to eat, I went to the bread room, and tilled my
pockets-with biscuit, and eat it as • wrnt about other things,
fori had no time to lose. I also found some rum in the great
cabin, of which I took a large dram, and which I had indeed
need enough of, to spirit me for what was before me. Now
I wanted nothing but a boat to furnish invself with many
things which I foresaw would be very necessary to me.
It was vain to sit still and wish for what was not to be had,
and this extremity roused my application We had several
spare yards, and two or three large spars of wood, and a spare
top-mast or two in the ship; I resolved to fall to work with
these, and flung as many of them overboard as I could
manage for their weight, tying every one with a rope, that
they might not drive away. When this was done, I went
down the ship's side, and pulling them to me, I tied four of
them fast together at both ends, as well as I could, in the
form of a raft, and laying two or three short pieces of plunk
upon them crossways I found I could walk upon it very well,
but that it was not able to bear any great weight, the pieces
being too light; so I went to work, and, with a carpenter's
saw, I cut a spare top-mast into three lengths, and added
them to my raft, with a great deal of labour and pains; but
the hope of furnishing myself with necessaries encouraged
me to go beyond what I should have been able to have done
upon another occasion
My raft was now strong enough to bear any reasonable
weight. My next care was what to load it with, and how to
preserve what I laid upon it from the surf of the sea: but I
was, not long considering this; I first laid all the planks or
boards upon it that I could get, and having considered well
what I most wanted, I first got three of the seamen's chests,
which I had broken open and emptied, and 'lowered them
down upon my raft. The first of these I filled with provi-
sions, viz. bread, rice, three Dutch cheeses, five pieces of
dried goat's flesh, which we lived much upon, and a little re-
mainder of European corn, which had been laid by for some
fowls which we brought to sea with us, but the fowls were
killed: there had been some barley and wheat together, but,
to my great disappointment, I found afterwards that the rats
had eaten or spoiled it all. As tor liquors, I found several
cases of bottles belonging to our skipper, in which were some
cordial waters, and in all about live or six gallons of arrack:
these I stowed by themselves, there being no need to put
them into the chest, nor any room for them. While I was
doing this, I found the tide began to flow, though very calm,
and I had the mortification to see my coat, shirt, and waist-
coat, which I had left on shore upon the sand, swim away:
as for my breeches', which were only linen and open knee'd,
I swam on board in them and my stockings. However, this
put me upon rummaging for clothes, of which I found enough,
but took no more than I wanted for present use, for I had
other things which my eye was more upon: as first, tools to
work with on shore, and it was after long searching that I
found out the carpenter's chest, which was indeed a very
useful prize to me, and much more valuable than a ship-load-
ing of gold would have been at that time. I got it down to
my raft, even whole as it was, without losing time to look into
it, for I knew in general what it contained.
My next care was for some ammunition and arms. There
were two very good fowling pieces in the great cabin, and two
pistols; these I secured first, with some powder horns, a'
small bag of shot, and two old rusty swords. I knew there
were three barrels of powder in the ship, but knew not
where our gunner had stowed them, but with much search I
found them, two of them dry and good, the third had taken
water: those two I got to my raft, with the arms And now
I thought myself pretty well freighted, and began to think
how I should get to shore with them, having neither sail, oar,
or rudder, and the least cap-full of wind would have overset
all my navigation.
I had three encouragements. First, A smooth and calm
sea. Secondly, The tide rising and setting in to the shore.
Thirdly, What little wind there was, blew me towards the
land. And thus, having found two or three broken oars .be-
longing to the boat, and besides the tools which were in the
chest, I found two saws, an ax, and a hammer; and with this
cargo I put to sea. For a mile, or thereabouts, my raft went
very well, only that I found it drive a little distant from the
place where I had landed before, by which I perceived that
there was some indraught of the water, and consequently I
hoped to find some creek or river there, which I might make
use of as a port to get to land with my cargo.
As I imagined, so it was: there appeared before me a little
opening of the land. I found a strong current of the tide set
into it, so I guided my rait as well as I could, to keep in the
middle of the stream. But here I had like to have suffered
a second shipwreck, which, if I had, 1 think verily would
have broken my heart; for knowing nothing of the coast, my
raft run aground at one end of it, upon a shoal, and not being
aground at the other end, it wanted but a little that all my
cargo had slipped off towards that end that was afloat, and so
fallen into the water: I did my utmost by setting my back
against the chests, to keep them in their places, but could not
thrust off the raft with all my strength; neither durst I stir
from the posture I was in, but, holding up the chests with all
my might, stood in that manner near half an hour, in which
time the rising of the water bi ought me a little more upon a
level: and a little after, the water still rising, my raft floated
again, and I thrust her off with the oar I had, into the chan-
nel and then driving up higher, I at length found myself in
the mouth of a little river, with land on both sides, and a
strong current of tide running up. I looked on both sides for
a proper place to get on shore, for I was not willing to be dri-
ven too high up the river, hoping in time to see some ship at
sea, and therefore resolved to place myself as near the coast
as I could.
At length I spied a little cove on the right shore of the
creek, to which with great pain and difficulty I guided my
raft, and at last got so near, as that, reaching ground with my
oar, I could thrust her directly in; bat here 1 had like to have
dipped all my cargo in the sea again; for that shore lying
pretty steep, that is to say, sloping, there was no place to
land, but where one end of the float, if it ran on shore, would
lie so high, and the other sink lower, as before, that it would
endanger my cargo again. All that I could do, was to wait till
the tide was at the highest, keeping the raft with my oar,
like an anchor, to hold the side of it fast to the shore, near a
flat piece of ground, which I expected the water would flow
over; and so it did. As soon as I found water enough (for
my raft drew about a foot of water), I thrust her upon that
flat piece of ground, and there fastened or moored her, by
sticking my two broken oars into the ground, one on one side
near one end, and one on the other side, near the other end;
:
and thus 1 lay till the wftter ebbed away, and left my raft and
all my cargo safe on shore.
My next work was to view the country, and seek a proper
place for my habitation, and where to stow my goods, to se-
cure them from whatever might happen. Where I was, I
yet knew not; whether on the continent, or on an island;
whether inhabited, or not inhabited; whether in danger of
wild beasts or not There was a hill not above a mile from
me, which rose up very steep and high, and which seemed to
overtop some other hills, which lay as in a ridge from it north-
ward. I took out one of the fowling-pieces, and one of the
pistols, and a horn of powder, and, thus armed, I travelled
for discovery up to the top of that hill, where, after I had
with great labour and difficulty got up, I immediately saw
my fate, to my great affliction; viz. that I was in an island,
environed every way with the sea, no land to be seen, except
some rocks, which lay a great way off, and two small islands,
less than this, which lay about three leagues to the west.
I found also that the islam) X was in was barren, and, as I
saw good reason to believe, uninhabited, except by wild
beasts, of which, however, I saw none, yet I saw abundance
of fowls, but knew not their kinds, neither, when I killed
them, could I tell what was fit for food, and what not. ' At
my coming back, I shot at a great bird, which I saw sitting
upon a tree,on the side of a large wood. I believe it was the
first gun that had been fired there, since the creation of the
world. I had no sooner fired, but from all the parts of the
wood there arose an extraordinary number of fowls, of many
sorts, mxking a confused screaming and crying. every one
- according to his U6ual note; but not one of them of any kind that
I knew As for that creature I killed, I took it to be a kind
of a hawk, its colour and beak resembling it, but it had no
talons or claws more than common: its flesh was carrion, and
fit for nothing.
Contented with this discovery, I came back to my raft, and
fell to work to bring my cargo on shore, which took me the
rest of the day What to do with myself at night, I knew not,
nor indeed where to rest, for I was afraid to lie down on the
ground. not knowing but some wild beast might devour me,
though I afterwards found there was really no need for those
fears.
However, as well as i could, I barricadoed myself round
with the chests and boards that I had brought on shore, and
made a kind of a hut for that night's lodging: as for food, I
yet saw not which way to supply myself, except that I hid
seen two or three creatures, like hares, run out of the wood
where I shot the fowl.
I now began to consider that 1 might yet get a great many
tilings out of the ship, which would be useful to me, and par-
ticularh some of the rigging and sails, and such other things
as might come to hand, and I resolved to make another
voyage on board the vessel, if possible; and as I knew that
the first storm that blew must necessarily break her all in
pieces,I resolved to set all other things apart, till i got every
thing out of the ship that I could get: then I called a council-
that is to say, in my thoughts, whether I should take back the
raft, but this appeared impracticable, so 1 resolved to go as
before, when the tide was down, and F did so, only that I
stripped before I went from my hut, havmg nothing on but
a checkered shirt, a pair of linen drawers, and a pair of pumps
on my feet.
I got on board the ship as before, and prepared a second
raft; and having had experience of the first, I neither made
this so unwieldy, nor loaded it so hard; but yet I brought
away several things very usefol to me; as first. in the cai-pen-
ter's store 1 found two or three bags full of nails and spikes,
a great screw jack, a dozen or two of hatchets, and, above
all, that most useful thing called a grindstone: all these I se-
cured, together with several things belonging to the gunner,
particularly two or three iron crows, and two barrels of mus-
ket tmllets, seven muskets, and another fowling-piece, with
some small quantity of powder more; a large bag full of small
shot, and a great roll of sheet lead: but this last was so heavy
1 could not hoist it up to get it over the shjp's side.
Besides these things, 1 took all the men's clothes that I
could find, and a spare fore-top-sail, hammock, and some bed-
ding; and with this I loaded my second raft, and brought them
also all safe on shove, to my very great comfort.
I was under some apprehensions during my absence from
the land, that at least my provisions might be devoured on
shore; but when I came back, I found no sign of any nsiior,
only there sat a creature like a wild cat upon one of the
chests, which, .vlicii I came towards it, ran away to a little di»-
E
tance, and then stood still. She sat very composed and un-
concerned,-and looked full in my face, as if she had a mind to
be acquainted with me. I presented my gun at her, but as
she did not understand it, she was perfectly unconcerned at
it, nor did she offer to stir away; upon which I tossed her a
bit of biscuit, though by the way I was not very free of it,
for my store was not great. However, I spared her a bit, I
say, and she went to it, smelled of it, and eat it, and looked
(as pleased) for more; but I thanked her, and could spare no
more, so she marched off.
Having got my second cargo on shore (though I was fain
to open the barrels of powder, and bring them by parcels, for
they were too heavy, being large casks,) I went to work to
make a little tent with the sail and some poles which I cut for
that purpose; and into this tent I brought every thing that I
knew would spoil, either with rain or sun; and I piled all the
empty chests and casks up in a circle round the tent, to for-
tify it from any sudden attempt, either from man or beast.
When 1 had done this, I blocked up the door of the tent
with some boards within, and an empty chest set up on end
without, and spreading one of the beds upon the ground, lay-
ing my two pistols just at my head, and my gun at length by
me, I went to bed, fur the first time, and slept very quietly
all night, being very weary and heavy, for the night before I
had slept little, and had laboured very hard all day, as
well to fetch those things from the ship, as to get them on shore.
I had the biggest magazine of all kinds now that ever were
laid up, I believe, for one man; but I was not satisfied still,
for while the ship sat upright in that posture, 1 thought I
ought to get every thing out of her that 1 could: so every-
day, at low water, I went on board. and brought away some-
thing or other. But particularly the third time I went, I
brought away as much of the rigging as I could, as also all
the small ropes and rope-twine I could get, with a piece of
spare canvas, which was to mend the sails upon occasion,'and
the barrel of wet gunpowder. In a word, I brought away all
the sails first and last, only that I was fain to cut them in pie-
ces, and bring as much at a time as I could; for they were no
more useful to me for sails, but as mere canvas only.
But that which comforted me more still, was, that at last of all
after I bad made five or six such voyages as these, and thought
I had nothing more to expect from the ship that was worth
my meddling with, I say, after all this, I found a great hogs-
head of bread; three large runlets of rum or spirits, a box of
sugar, and a barrel of tine flour: this was surprising to me,
because 1 had given over expecting any more provisions, ex-
cept what was spoiled by the water. I soon emptied the
hogshead of that bread, and wrapt it up, parcel by parcel, in
pieces of the sails, which I cut out; and, in a word, I got all
this safe on shore also, though at several times.
The next day I made another voyage, and now having
plundered the ship of what was portable, and lit to hand out,
I began with the .cables; and cutting the great cable into pie-
ces, such as I could move, I got two cables and a haulser on
shore, with all the iron-work I could get; and having cut down
the sprit-sail-yard, and the mizen-yard, and every thing I
could to make a large raft, I loaded it with all those heavy
goods, and came away. But my good luck began to leave me,
for this raft was so unwieldy, and so overladen, that after I
was entered the little cove, where I had landed the rest of my
goods, not being able to guide it so handily as I did the other,
it overset, and threw me and all my cargo into the water. As
for myself, it was no great harm, fori was near the shore;
but as to my cargo it was great part of it lost, especially the
iron, which I expected would have been of great use to me.
However, when the tide was out, I got most of the pieces of
cable ashore; and some of the iron, though with infinite la-
bour, for I was fain to dip for it into the water, a work which
fatigued me very much. After this, I went every day on
board, and brought away what I could '.;et.
I had been now thirteen days on shore, and had been
eleven times on board the ship, in which time I had brought
away all that one pair of hands could well be supposed capa-
ble to bring, though I believe verily, had the calm weather
held, I should have brought away the whole ship, piece by
pieee' But preparing the twelfth time to go on board, I
found the wind began to rise: however, at low water, I went
on board; and though I thought I had rummaged the cabin so
effectually, as that nothing more could be found, yet I disco-
vered a locker, with drawers in it, in one of which 1 found
two or three razors, and one pair of large scissors, with
ten or a dozen good knives and forks; in another I found
about thirty-six pounds value in money, some European
coin, some Iirasil, some pieces of eight, some gold, some silver.
I smiled to myself at the sight of this money. «0 drug!'
laid I, aloud, ' what art thou good for? Thou art not -worth
to me, no, not the taking off the ground. One of those knives
is worth all this heap. I have no manner of use for thee:
even remain where thou art, and go to the bottom as a crea-
ture whose life is not worth saving!' However, upon second
thoughts I took it away, and wrapping all this in a piece of
canvas. I began to think of making another raft. hut while I
was preparing [his, I found the sky overcast, and the wind
began to rise, and in a quarter of an hour it blew a fresh gale
from the shore; it presently occurred to me, that it was" in
vain to pretend to make a raft, with the wind off shore, and
that it was my business to be gone before the tide of flood be-
gan, otherwise I might not be able to reach the shore at all:
accordingly, I let myself down into the water, and swam
across the channel, which lay between the ship and the sand,
and even that with difficulty enough, partly with the weight
of the things I had about me, and partly with the roughness
of the water; lor the wind rose very hastily, and before it was
quite high water, it blew a storm.
But I was gotten home to my little tent, where I lay with
all my wealth about me very secure; it blew very hard all
that night; and in the morning, when I looked out, behold,
no more ship was to be seen! I was a little surprised,
but recovered myself with this satisfactory reflection; viz.
thai I had lost no time, nor abated any diligence, to get every
thing out of her tnat could be useful to me; and that indeed
there was little left in her that I was able to bring away, if I
had had more time I now gave over any more thought of
the ship, or of any thing out of her, except what might drive
on shore from her wreck, as indeed divers pieces of her af-
terwards did; but those things were of small use to me.
M> thoughts were now wholly employed about securing
myself against either savages, if any should appear, or wild
beasts if any were in the island: and I had many thoughts of
the method how to do this, and what kind of dwelling fo
make; whether I should make me a cave in the earth, or a
tent upon the earth- and, in short, I resolved upon both; the
manner and description of which it may not be improper to
give an account of
I soon found the place I was in was not for my settlement,
'particularly because it was upon a low moorish ground near
the sea, and I believed would not he wholesome, aad more
particularly because there was no fresh water near it; so I
resolved to hud a more healthy and more convenient spot of
ground.
I consulted several things in my situation, which I found
would be proper for me; first, health and fresh water, as I
just now mentioned; secondly, shelter from the heat of the
sun; thirdly, security from ravenous creatures, whether man
or beast; fourthly, a view to the sea, that if God sent any
ship in sight, I might not lose any advantage for my delive.
ranee, for which I was not willing to banish all my expectation
yet.
In search of a place proper for this, I found a little
plain on the side of a rising hill, whose front towards this lit-
tle plain, was as steep as a house-side, so that nothing could
comedown upon me from the top. On the side of this rock
there was a hollow place, worn a little way in, like the en-
trance or door of a cave, but there was not really any cave or
way into the rock at all.
On the flat of the green, just before this hollow place, I re-
solved to pitch my tent. This plain was not above a hundred
yards broad, and about twice as long, and lay like a green be-
fore my door, and at the end of it descended irregularly
every way down into the low grounds by the sea-side. It was
on the N. N. W. side of the hill, so that it was sheltered from
the heat every day, till it came to a W. and by S sun, or
(hereabouts. which in those countries is near the setting.
Before I set up my tent, I drew a half-circle before the
loJIow place, whieh took in about ten yards in its semi-dia-
meter, from the rock, and twenty yards in its diameter, from.
its beginning and ending.
In this half-circle I pitched (wo rows of strong stakes, dri-
ving them into the ground till they stood very firm, like piles,
the biggest end being out of the ground about five feet and a
half, and sharpened on the top; the two rows did not stand
above six inches from one another.
Then 1 took the pieces of cable which I had cut in the ship;
and laid them in rows upon one another, within the circle be-
tween these two rows of stakes, up to the top, placing other
stakes in the inside, leaning against them about two feet and
a half high, like a spur fo a post; and this fence was so strong,
(hat oeither.man nor beast could get into it, or over it. This
E2
cost me a great deal of time and labour, especially to cut the
piles in the woods, bring them to the place, and drive them
into the earth.
The entrance into this place I made to be, not by a door,
but by a short ladder, to go over the top, which ladder, when
I was in, I lifted over after me, and so I was completely fen-
ced in, and fortified, as I thought, from all the world, and
consequently slept secure in the night, which otherwise I
could not have done; though as it appeared afterwards, there
was no need of all this caution from the enemies I apprehen-
ded danger from.
Into this fence, or fortress, with infinite labour, I carried
all my riches, all my provisions, ammunition and stores; of
which you have the account above; and 1 made me a large
tent also, which, to preserve me from the rains, that in one
part of the year are very violent there, I made double, viz.
one smaller tent within, and one larger tent above it; and
covered the uppermost with a large tarpaulin, which I had
saved among the sails.
And now 1 lay no more for awhile in the bed which I had
brought on shore, but in a hammock, which was indeed a very
good one, and belonged to the mate of the ship.
Into this tent I brought all my provisions, and every thing
that would spoil by the wet; and havmg thus enclosed all my
goods, I made up the entrance. which till now I had left open,
and so passed and repassed, as 1 said, by a short ladder.
When 1 had done this, I began to work my way into the
rock, and bringing all the earth and stones that I dug down,
out through my tent. I laid them up within my fence in the na-
ture of a terrace, so that it raised the ground within about a
foot and a half. and thus 1 made me a cave just behind my
tent, which served me like a cellar to my house.
It cost me much labour, and many days, before all these
things were brought to perfection; and therefore I must go
back to some other things which took up some of my thoughts.
At the same time It happened, after 1 had laid my scheme
for the setting up my tent, and making the cave, that a storm
of rain falling frem a thick dark cloud, a sudden flash of light-
ning happened and after that, a great clap of thunder, as is
naturally the effect of it I was not so much surprised with the
lightning, as I was with the thought which darted into my
jnind as swift sui the lightning itself: O my powder! my very

heart sunk within me, when I thought that at one blast all my
powder might he destroyed; on which, not my defence only,
but the providing me food, as I thought, entirely depen-
ded; I was nothing near so anxious about my own danger;
though had the powder took fire, I had never known who had
hurt me.
Such impressions did this make upon me, that after the
storm was over, I laid aside all my works, my building and
fortifying, and applied myself to make bags and boxes to
separate my powder, and to keep it a little and a little in a
parcel, in hopes, that, whatever might come, it might not
all take fire at once, and to keep it so apart, that it should
not be possible to make one part fire another. I finish-
ed this work in about a fortnight, and I think my powder,
-which in all was about 1401b. weight was divided into no less
than a hundred parcels. As to the barrel that had been wet,
I did not apprehend any danger from that, so I placed it in
roy new cave, which in my far.cy I called my kitchen; and the
rest I hid up and down in holes among the rocks, so that no
-vet might come to it, marking very carefully where 1 laid it.
In the interval of time while this was doing, I went out at
least once every day with my gun, as well to divert myself,
as to see if I could kill any thing for food, and as near as I
could, to acquaint myself with what the island produced.
The first time 1 wen tout, I presently discovered that there were
goats in the island, which was a great satisfaction to me; but
then it was attended with this misfortune to me, viz. that
they were so shy, so subtle, and so swift of foot, that it was
the diflicultest thing in the world to eon.e at them; hut I was
not discouraged at this, not doubting but I might now and
then shoot one, as it soon happened; for after I had found
their haunts :i little, I laid wait in this manner fur them: I
observed, if they saw me in the valleys, though ihey were
ttpon the rocks,.they would run away as in a terrible fright; but
if ihey were feeding in the valleys, and I was upon the rocks,
they took no notice of me; from whence I concluded, that
by the position of their optics, their sight was so directed
downward, that they did not readily see objects that were
above them. So afterwards I took this method, I always
climbed the rocks first, to get above them, and then had
frequently a fair mark The first shot I made among these
creatures, I killed a she-goat which had a little kid by her',
which she gave suck to, which grieved me heartily; but when
the old one fell, the kid stood stock still by her till I came and
took her up; and not only so, but when I carried the old one
with me upon my shoulders, the kid followed me quite to my
enclosure; upon which I laid down the dam, and took the kid
in my arms, and earned it over my pale, in hopes to have
bred it up tame; but it would not eat; so I was forced to kill
it, and eat it myself These two supplied me with flesh a
great while; for I eat sparingly, and saved my provisions (my
bread especially) as much as possibly I could
Having now fixed my habitation, I found it absolutely ne-
cessary to provide a place to make a fire in, and fuel to burn;
and what I did for that, as also how I enlarged my cave, and
what conveniences I made, I shall give a full account of in its
place: but I must first give some little account of myself, and
of my thoughts about living, which it may well be supposed
were not a few
I had a dismal prospect of my condition; for as I was not
cast away upon that island without being driven, as is said, by
a violent storm quite out of the course of our intended voy-
age, and a great way, viz. some hundreds of leagues, out of
the ordinary course of the trade of mankind, I had great rea-
son to consider it as a determination of Heaven, that in this
desolate place, and m this desolate manner, I should end my
life. The tears would run plentifully down my face, when I
made these reflections; and sometimes I would expostulate
with myself, why Providence should thus completely rain its
creatures, and render them so absolutely miserable, so with-
out help abandoned, and so entirely depressed, that it could
hardly be rational to be thankful for such a life?
But something always returned swift upon me to check
these thoughts, and to reprove me; and particularly one day,
walking with my gun in my hand by the sea side, 1 was vci-yr
pensive upon the subject of my present condition, when rea-
son, as it were, put in, expostulating with me the other way,
thus: Well, you are in a desolate condition, it is true, hut
pray remember, where are the rest of you? Did not you come
eleven of you into the boat? where are the ten? why were
not they saved,' Snd you lost? why were you singled out? is it
better to be here or there? and then I pointed to the sea- All
evils are to be considered with the good that is in them, and
with what worse attended them-
Tiien it occurred to me again, how well I was furnished for
my subsistence, and what would have been my case, if it had
not happened, which was an hundred thousand to one that
the ship floated from the place where she first struck, and
was driven so near to the shore, that I had time to get all
these things out of her? What would have been my case, if I
had been to have lived in the condition in which I at first
came on shore, without necessaries of life, or any means to
supply and procure them? Particularly, said I aloud (though
to myself), what would I have done, without a gun, without
ammunition, without any tools to make any thing, or to work
with? without clothes, bedding, a tent, or any manner of co-
verings? And that now I had all these to a sufficient quantity,
and was in a fair way to provide myself in such a manner, as
to live without my gun when my ammunition was spent, so
that I had a tolerable view of subsisting without any want as
long as I lived; for I considered from the beginning how I
would provide for the accidents that might happen, and for
the time that was to come, even not only after my ammuni-
tion should be spent, but even after my health or strength
should decay.
I confess I had not then entertained any notion of my am-
munition being destroyed at one blast, I mean my powder
being blown up by lightning; and this made the thoughts of
it so surprising to me, when it lightened and thundered, as I
observed just now.
And now, being to enter into a melancholy relation of a
secne of silent life, such perhaps as was never heard of in the
world before, I shall take it from its beginning, and continue it
iu its order. It was, by my account, the 30th of September,
when, in the manner as abovesaid, I first set foot upon this
Iiorrid island, when the sun being, to us, in its autumnal equi-
nox, was almost just over my head; fori reckoned myself, by
observation, to be in the latitude of 9 degrees, 22 minutes
north of the line.
After I had been there about ten or twelve days, it came
into my thoughts, that I should lose my reckoning of time for
want of books, and pen and ink, and should even forget the
sabbath days from the working days: hut to prevent this, I
cut it with my knife upon a large post, in eapiul letters and,
making it into a great cross, I set it up on the shore, where I
first landed, m. I came on shore here the 30th of Sept. 1653.
Upon the sides of this square post I cut every day a notch
with my knife, and every seventh notch was as long again as
the rest, and every first day of the month as long again as
that long one; and thus 1 kept my calendar, or weekly,
monthly and yearly reckoning of time.
In the next place we are to observe, that among the many
things which 1 brought off the ship in the several voyages,
which, as above-mentioned, I made to it, I got several things
of less value, but not at all less useful to me, which I omitted
setting down before; as in particular, pens, ink, and paper,
several parcels m the captain's, mate's, gunner's, and car-
penter's keeping, three or four compasses, some mathemati-
cal instruments, dials. perspectives, charts, and hooks of na-
vigation, all which 1 huddled together, whether I might
want them or no. also I found three very good Bibles, which
came to me in my cargo from England, and which I had packed
up among my things, some Portuguese books also, and among
them two or three popish prayer-books, and several other books,
all which I carefully secured. And I must not forget that we'had
in the ship a dog and two cats, ot whose eminent history I may
have occasion to say something in its place; for I carried both
the cats with me; and as for the deg, he jumped out of the
ship of himself, and swam on shore to me the day after I went
on shore with my first cargo, and was a trusty servant to me
many years; 1 wanted nothing that he could fetch me, nor
any company that he could make up to me; I only wanted to
have him talk to me, but that he could not do. As I obser-
ved before, 1 found pen, ink, and paper, and 1 husbanded
them to the utmost; and I shall show, that while my ink las-
ted, 1 kept things very exact; but after that was gone, I
could not; for I could not make any ink, by any means that I
could devise.
And this put me in mind that 1 wanted many things, not-
withstanding all that 1 had amassed together; and of these,
this of ink was one, as also a spade, pick-axe, and shovel, to
dig or remove the earth; needles, pins, and thread; as for
linen, I soon learned to want that without much difficulty.
This want of tools made every work I did go on heavily,
and it was near a whole year before I had entirely finished
my little pale, or surrounded habitation: the piles, or stakes,
which were as heavy as 1 could well lift, were a long time in
cutting and preparing in the woods, and more by far ia
bringing home; so that I spent sometimes two days in cutting
and bringing home one of those posts, and a third day in dri-
ving it into the ground: fop which purpose I got a heavy
piece of wood at first, but at last bethought myself of one of
the iron crows, which, however, though 1 found it, yet made
driving those posts or piles very laborious and tedious work.
But what need 1 have been concerned at the tediousness of
any thing I had to do, seeing I had time enough to do it in?
Nor had I any other employment, if that had been over, at
least, that I could foresee, except the ranging the island to
seek for food, which 1 did more or less every day.
I now began to consider seriously my condition, and the cir-
cumstance I was reduced to, and I drew up the state of my
affairs in writing; not so much to leave them to any that
were to come after me, for I was like to have but few heirs,
as to deliver my thoughts from daily poring upon them, and
afflicting my mind; and as my reason began now to master
my despondency, 1 began to comfort myself as well as I
could, and to set the good against the evil, thatI might have
something to distinguish my case from worse; and I stated it
very impartially, like debtor and creditor, the comforts I en-
joyed, against the miseries I suffered, thus:
EVIL. GOOD.

or relieve me. the ship in near enough to the
shore, that I have gotten out
so many necessary things as
will either supply my wants,
or enable me to supply my-
self, even as long as I live.
Upon the whole here was an undaubted testimony, that
there was scarce any condition in the world so miserable, but
there was something negative, or something positive, to be
thankful for in it; and let this stand as a direction from the
experience of the most miserable of all conditions in this
world, that we may always find in it something to comfort
ourselves from, and to set, in the description of good ami
evil, on the credit side of the accompt.
Having now brought my mind a little to relisli my condi-
tion, and giving over looking out to sea, to see if I could spy a
ship; 1 say, giving over these things, I began to apply myself
to accommodate my way of living, and to make things as easy
to me as I could.
1 have already described my habitation, which was a tent
under the side of a rock, surrounded with a strong pale of
posts and cables, but I might now ralher call it a wall; for I
raised a kind of wall up against it of turfs, about two feet thick
on the outside; and after some time (I think it was a year and a
half) 1 raised rafters from it, leaning to the rock, and thatch-
ed or covered it with boughs of trees, and such things as I
could get to keep out the rain, which I found at some times
of the year very violent.
I have already observed how I brought all my goods into
fliis pale, and into the. cave which I had made behind me;
but I must observe too, that, at first, this was a confused heap
of goods, which, as they lay in no order, so they took up all
my place: I had no room to turn myself, so I set myself to
enlarge my cave, and worked farther into the earthi for it
was a loose sandy rock, which yielded easily to the labour i
bestowed on it: and so, when I found I was pretty safe as to
beasts of prey, I worked sideways to the right hand into the
rock; and, then turning to the right again, worked quite out,
and made me a door to come out on the outside of my pale or
fortification.
This gave me not only egress and regress, as it was a back
way to my tent, and to my store house, but gave me room to
stow my goods.
And now I began to apply myself to make such necessary
things as I found I most wanted, particularly a chair and a
table; for without these I was not able to enjoy the few com-
forts I had in the world; I could not write or eat, or several
things, with so much pleasure without a table.
So I went to work; and here I must needs observe, that as
reason is the substance and original of the mathematics, so
by stating and squaring every thing by reason, and by making
the most rational judgment of things, every man may be, in
time, master of every mechanic art. 1 had never handled a
tool in my life, and yet, in time, by labour, application, and
contrivance, I found, at last, that I wanted nothing but I could
have made it, especially if I had had tools; however, I made
abundance of things, even without tools, and some with no
more tools than an adz and a hatchet, which perhaps were
never made that way before, and that with infinite labour. For
example, if I wanted a board, I had no other way but to cut
down a tree, set it on an edge before me, and hew it flat on
either side with my ax, till I had brought it to be as thin as a
plank, and then dub it smoothe with my adz. It is true, by
this method I could make but one board out of a whole tree,
but this I had no remedy for, but patience, any more than I
had for the prodigious deal of time and labour which it took
me up to make a plank or board: but my time or labour was
little worth, and so it was as well employed one way as ano-
ther.
However, I made me a table and a chair, as I observed
above, in the first place, and this I did out of the short pieces
of boards that I brought on my raft from the ship; but when
I had wrought out some boards, as above, I made large
, shelves of the breadth of a foot and a half, one over another,
all along one side of my cave, to lay all my tools, nails, and
iron-work. and in a word, to separate every thing at large in
their places, that I might easily come at them: also.J knock-
F
ed pieces into the wall of the rock to hang my guns, and all
things that would hang up
So that had my cave been to be seen, it looked like a gene-
ral magazine of all necessary things; and I had every thing so
ready at my hand, that it was a great pleasure to me to see
all my goods in such order, and especially to find my stock of
all necessaries so great.
And now it was when I began to keep a journal of every
day's employment; for indeed at first I was in too much hur-
ry, and not only a hurry as to labour, but in too much dis-
composure of mind, and my journal would have been full of
many dull things. For example, 1 must have said thus: Sep-
tember the 30th, After I got to shore, and had escaped
drowning, instead of being thankful to God for my deliverance,
having first vomited with the great quantity of salt water
which was gotten into my stomach, and recovering myself a
little, I ran about the shore, wringing my hands and beating
my head and face, exclaiming at my misery, and crying out,
I was undone! undone! till, tired and faint, 1 was forced to lie
down on the ground to repose, but durst not sleep for fear
of being devoured
Some days after this, and after I had been on board the
ship, and had got all I could out of her, yet I could not for-
bear getting up to the top of a little mountain, and looking
out to sea, in hopes of seeing a ship, thenlfancy, at a vast dis-
tance, I spied a sail, please myself with the hopes of it, and
then, after looking steadily, till, I was almost blind, lose
it quite, and set down and weep like a child, and thus increase
my misery by my folly.
But having gotten over these things, in some measure, and
having settled my household-stuff and habitation, made me a
table and a chair, and all as handsome about me as I could, I
began, I say, to keep my journal, of which I shall here give
you the copy (though in it will be told all these particulars
over again), as long as it lasted; for at last having no more
ink, I was forced to leave it off.
THE JOURNAL.
September 30,1659, 1, poor miserable Robinson Cru-
soe, being shipwrecked during a dreadful storm in the offing,
came on shore on this dismal unfortunate island, which I cal-
led the Island of Despair; all the rest of the ship's company
being drowned, and mysell almost dead.
All the rest of the day 1 spent in afflicting myself at the
dismal circumstances I was brought to, viz. I had neither
food, house, clothes, weapon, or place to fly to, and in des-
pair of any relief, saw nothing but death before me, either
th..t I should be devoured by wild beasts, murdered by sava-
ges, or starved to death for want of food At the approach
of night, I slept in a tree, for fear of wild creatures; but slept
soundly, though it rained all night-
October 1 In the morning I saw, to my great surprise,
the ship had floated with the high tide, and was driven on
shore again much nearer the island, which, as it was some
comfort on one hand (for seeing her set upright, and not bro-
ken lo pieces, I hoped, if the wind abated, I might get on
board, and get some food and necessaries out of her for my
relief), so on the other hand, it renewed my grief at the loss
of my comrades, who, I imagined, if we had all staid on board,
might have saved the ship, or at least that they would not
have been all drowned, as they were; and that, had the men
been saved, we might perhaps have built us a boat out of the
ruins of the ship, to have carried us to some other part of the
world. I spent great part of this day in perplexing myself
on these things; but at length seeing the ship almost dry, I
went upon the sand as near as I could, and then swam on
board. This day also continued raining, though with no
wind at all.
From the 1st of October to the 24th. All these days en-
tirely spent in making several voyages to get all I could out
of the ship, which I brought on shore every tide of flood upon
rafts. Much rain also in these days, though with some inter-
vals of fair weather; but, it seems, this was the rainy season.
October 24 I overset my raft, and all the goods I had
got upon it; but being in shoal water, and the things being
chiefly heavy, I recovered many of them when the tide was
out.
October 25. It rained all night, and all day, with some gusts
of wind, during which time the ship broke in pieces, the wind
blowing a little harder than before, and was no more to be
seen, except the wreck of her, and that only at low water. I
spent this day in covering and securing the goods which I sa-
ved, that the rain might not spoil them.
October 2G. I walked about the shore almost all clay to
find out a place to fix my habitation, greatly concerned to
secure myself from any attack, in the night, either from wild
beasts or men. Towards night I fixed upon a proper place
under a rock, and marked out a semicircle for my encamp-
ment, which I resolved to strengthen with a work, wall, or
fortification, made of double piles, lined within with cable,
and without with turf.
From the 26th to the 30th, I worked very hard in carrying
all my goods to my new habitation, though some part of the
time it rained exceeding hard.
The 31st, in the morning, I went out into the island with
my gun, to see for some food, and discover the country;
-when I killed a she-goat, and her kid followed me home,
-which I afterwards killed also, because it would not feed.
November 1. I set up my tent under a rock, and lay
there for the first night, making it as large as I could, with
stakes driven in to swing my hammock upon
November 2. I set up all my chests and boards, and the
pieces of timber which made my rafts. and with them formed
a fence round me, a little within the place I had marked out
for my fortification.
November 3. I went out with my gun, and killed two
fowls like ducks, which were very good food. In the after-
noon went to work to make me a table
November 4. This morning I began to order my times of
work, of going out with my gun, time of sleep, and time of
diversion; viz. every morning I walked out with my gun, for
two or three hours, if it did not rain; then employed myself
to work till about eleven o'clock; then eat what I had to live
nn; and, from twelve to two; I lay down to sleep, the weather
being excessive hot, and then in the evening to work again.
The working part of this day and the next were wholly em-
ployed in making my table, for I was yet but a very sorry
workman, though time and necessity made me a complete
natural mechanic soon after, as I believe it would do any one
else.
November 5. This day I went abroad with my gun and
my dog, and killed a wild cat; her skin pretty soft, but her
flesh good for nothing. Every creature I killed, I took off the
skins and preserved them. Coming back, by the sea shore, I
saw many sorts of sea-fowls which I did not understand; hut
was surprised, and almost frighted, with two or three seals,
which, while I was gazing at, not well knowing what they
were, got into the sea, and escaped me for that time.
November 6. After my morning walk, 1 went to work with
my table again, and finished it, though not to my liking; nor
was it long before 1 learned to mend it.
November 7. Now it began to be settled fair weather.
The 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, and part of the 12th (for the Uth
was Sunday, according to my reckoning), I took wholly up
to make me a ehair, and with much ado, brought it to a to-
lerable shape, but never to please me; and even in the mak-
ing I pulled it to pieces several times Note, I soon neglec-
ted keeping my Sundays; for, omitting my mark for them on
my post, I forgot which was which.
November IS. This day it rained, which refreshed me ex-
ceedingly, and cooled the earth; but it was accompanied with
terrible thunder and lightning, which frighted me dreadfully,
for fear of my powder. As soon as it was over, I resolved
to separate my stock of powder into as many little parcels as
possible, that it might not be in danger
November 14, 15, 16. These three days I spent in mak-,
ing little square chests or boxes, which might hold about a
pound, or two pounds at most, of powder; and so putting the
powder in, I stowed it in places as secure and remote from
one another as possible- On one of these three days I killed
a large bird that was good to eat, but I knew not what to call
it.
November 17. This day I began to dig behind my tent into
the rock, to make room for my farther conveniency. Note,
Three things I wanted exceedingly for this work; viz. a pick
axe, a shovel, and a wheelbarrow or basket: so I desisted
from my work, and began to consider how to supply that
want, and make me some tools. As for the pick-axe, I made
use of the iron crows, which were proper enough, though
heavy, but the next thing was a shovel or spade; this was so
absolutely necessary, that indeed I could do nothing effectual-
ly without it; but what kind of one to make, I knew not.
November 18. The next day, in searching the woods, I
found a tree of that wood, or like it, which in the lirasils,
they call the iron-tree, for its exceeding hardness: of this,
with great labour, and almost spoiling my axe, I cut a piece,
F2
/
and brought it home too with difficult; enough, for it was ex-
ceeding heavy.
The excessive hardness of the wood, and having no other
way, made me a long while upon this machine; for I worked
it effectually, by little and little, into the form of a shovel or
apade, the handle exactly shaped like ours in England, only that
the broad part having no iron shod upon it at bottom, it would
not last me so long: however, it served well enough for the
uses which I had occasion to put it to; but never was a sho-
vel, I believe made after that fashion, or so long a making.
I was still deficient, for I wanted a basket, or a wheelbar-
row: a basket I could not make by any means, having no
such things as twigs that would bend to make wicker-ware,
or at least none yet found out; and, as to the wheelbarrow, I
fancied I could make all but the wheel; but that I had no no-
tion of, neither did I know how to go about it: besides I had
no possible way to make iron gudgeons, for the spindle or
axis of the wheel to run in, so I gave it over; and so, for car-
rying away the earth which I dug out of the cave, I made me
a thing like a hod which the labourers carry mortar in, when
they serve the bricklayers.
This was not so difficult to me as the making the shovel;
and yet this, and the shovel, and the attempt which I made in
vain to make a wheelbarrow, took me no less than four days:
I mean, always excepting my morning walk with my gun,
which I seldom failed, and very seldom failed also of bringing
home something fit to eat.
November 23. My other work having stood still, because
of my making these tools, when they were fmished I went
on; and working every day as my strength and time allowed,
1 spent eighteen days entirely in widening and deepening my
cave, that it might hold my goods commodiously.
Note. During all this time, I worked to make this room,
or cave, spacious enough to accommodate me as a warehouse
or magazine, a kitchen, a dining room, and a cellar; as for a
lodging, I kept to the tent, except that sometimes in the wet
season of the year it rained so hard, that I could not keep
myself dry; which caused me afterwards to coverall my place
-within my pale, with long poles, in the form of rafters, lean-
ing against the rock, and load them with flags, and large leaves
of trees, like a thatch.
December 10. I began now to think my cave or vault
finished, when, on a sudden (it seems Ihad made it too large),
a great quantity of earth fell down from the top and on one
side, so much that, in short, it frighted me, and not without
reason too; for if I had been under it, I bad never wanted a
grave-digger. Upon this disaster, I had a great deal of work
to do over again; for I had the loose earth to carry out, and,
which was of more importance, I had the ceiling to prop up,
so that I might be sure no more would come down.
December ll. This day I went to work with it according-
ly, and got two shores, or posts, pitched upright to the top
with two pieces of boards across over each post. This I
finished the next day;. and setting more posts up with boards,
in about a week more I had the roof secured; and the posts,
standing in rows, served-me for partitions to part off my
house.
December 17. From this day to the 20th, I placed shelves,
and knocked up nails on the posts, to hang every thing up
that could be hung up; and now I began to be in some order
within doors.
December 20. Now I carried every thing into the cave,
and began to furnish my house, and set up some pieces of
boards, like a dresser, to order my victuals upon; but boards
began to be very scarce with me. Also I made me another
table.
December 24. Much rain all night and all day; no stirring
out.
December 25. Rain all day.
December 26. No rain, and the earth much cooler than
before, and pleasanter.
December. 27. Killed a young goat, and lamed another, so
that I catched it, and led it home in a string; when 1 had it
home I bound and splintered up its leg, which was broke.
N. B. I took such care of it, that it lived, and the leg grew
well, and as strong as ever; but by nursing it so long it
grew tame, and fed upon the little green at my door, and
would not go away. 1'his was the first time that I enter-
tained a thought of breeding up some tame creatures, that I
might have food when my powder and shot was all spent-
December 2S, 29, 30. Great heats and no breeze; so that
there was no stirring abroad, except in the evening for food.
This time I spent in putting all my things in order within
doors.
January 1. Very hot still; but I went abroad, early and
late, with my gun, and lay still in the middle of the day.
This evening, going farther into the valleys, which lay to the
centre of the island, I found there was plenty of goats, though
exceeding shy, and hard to come at; however, I resolved to
try if I could not bring my dog to hunt them down.
January 2. Accordingly, the next day, I went out with
my dog and set him upon the goats; but I was mistaken, for
they all faced about upon the dog, and he knew his danger top
well, for he would not come near them.
January 3. I began my fence or wall, which, being still
jealous of my being attacked by somebody, I resolved to make
very thick and strong
[N. B. This wall being described before, I purposely omit
what was said in the journal; ii is sufficient to observe, that I
was no less time than from the 3d of January to the 14th of
April, workiug, finishing, and perfecting this wall, though it
it was no more than about twenty-four yards in length, being
a half circle, from one place in the roek, to another place
about eighty yards from it, the door of the cave being in the
centre behind it.]
All this time I worked very hard, the rains hindering me
many ctoys, nay, sometimes weeks, together; but 1 thought I
should never be perfectly secure till this wall was finished:
and it is scarce credible what inexpressible labour every thing
was done with, especially the bringing piles out of the woods,
and driving them into the ground; for 1 made them much
bigger than I needed to have done.
W hen this wall was finished, and the outside double fenced,
villi a turf wall raised up close to it, 1 persuaded myself, that
if »n people were to come on shore there, they would not
perceive any thing like a habitation: and it was very well I
did so, as may be observed hereafter, upon a very remarkable
occasion.
During this time, I made my rounds in the woods for game
every day, when the rain admitted me, and made frequent
discoveries in these walks of something or other to my advan-
tage; particularly I found a kind of wild pigeons, which
build not as wood pigeons in a tree, but rather as house-pi-
geons, iu the holes of the rocks; and taking some young
ones, I endeavoured to breed them up tame, and did so; but
when they grew older, they flew all away, which perhaps
was at first for want of feeding them, for I had nothing to
give them: however, I frequently found their nests, and got
their young ones, which were very good meat.
And now, in the managing my household affairs, I found
myself wanting in many things, which I thought at first it was
impossible for me to make, as indeed as to some of them it
was: for instance, I could never make a cask to be hooped.
I had a>small runlet or two, as I observed before, but I could
never arrive to the capacity of making one by them, though
I spent many weeks about it; I could neither put in the heads,
or join the staves so true to one another, as to make them
hold water; so I gave that also over.
In the next place, I was at a great loss for candles; so that
as soon as it was dark, which was generally by seven o'clock,
I was obliged to go to bed. I remembered the lump of bees-
wax, with which I made candles in my African adventure;
but I had none of that now: the only remedy I had, was, that
when I had killed a goat, I saved the tallow, and with a little
dish made of clay, which 1 baked in the sun, to which I added
a wick of some oakum, I made me a lamp: and this gave me
light, though not a clear stead; light, like a candle. In the
middle of all my labours it happened that, rummaging my
things, I found a little bag, which, as I hinted before, had
been filled with corn, for the feeding of poultry, not for this
voy age, but before, as I suppose, when the ship came from
Lisbon: what little remainder of corn had been in the bag,
was all devoured by the rats, and I saw nothing in the bag but
husks and dust; and being willing to have the bag for some
other use (I think it was to put powder in, when I divi-
ded it for fear of the lightning, or some such use), I shook the
husks of corn out of it, oo one side of my fortification, under
the rnck.
It was a little before the great rains, just now mentioned,
that i threw this stuff away, taking no notice of any thing,
and not so much as remembering that I had thrown any thing
there; when, about a month after, or thereabouts, I saw
aome few stalks of something green shooting up on the ground,
which I fancied might he some plant I had not seen, but 1 was
aorpiised, and perfectly astonished, when, after a little lon-
ger time, I saw about ten or twelve ears come out, which
-were perfect green barley, of the same kind as our European,
nay, as our English barley. . .
It is impossible to express the astonishment and contusion
of my thoughts on this occasion. I had hitherto acted upon no
religious foundation at all; indeed I had very few notions of
religion in my head, nor had entertained any sense of any
thmg that had befallen me. otherwise than as a chance, or as
,e lightly say, what pleases God: without so much as mquir-
ing into the end of Providence in these thmgs. or his order m
governing events in the world: but after I saw barley grow
{here. in a climate which I knew was not proper for corn,
and especially that I knew not how it came there, it startled
me strangely, and I began to suggest, that God had miracu-
louslv caused this grain to grow, without any help of seed
sown, and that it was so directed purely for my suste-
nance in that wild miserable place
This touched my heartalittle, and brought tears out of my
eyes, and I began to bless myself, that such a prodigy of na-
ture should happen upon my account; and this was the more
stra..ge to me, because I saw near it still, all along by the s,de
of the rock, some other st- aggling stalks, which proved to be
stalks of rice, and which I knew, because I had seen it grow
in Africa, when I was ashore there.
I »ot only thought these the pure productions of Provi-
dence for my support; but not doubting but that there was
more in the place, I went all over that part of the island
where I had been before, peering in every corner, and under
every rock, to see for more of it, but I could not find any. at
last it occurred to my thoughts, that I had shaken the bag ot
chicken's meat out in that place, and then the wonder began.
to cease: and I must confess, my religious thankfulness to
God's providence began to abate too, upon the discovermg
that all this was nothing but what was common, though I
ought to have been as thankful for so strange and unforeseen
Providence, as if it had been miraculous; for it was really the
work of Providence as to me, that should order or appomt,
that ten or twelve grains of corn should remain unspoiled
(when the rats had destroyed all the rest), as if it had been
dropped from Heaven: as also that I should throw it out in
th»t particular place, where. it being in the shade of a high
rock, it sprang up immediately, whereas, if I had thrown it any
where else, at that time, it had been burnt up and destroyed.
I carefully saved the ears of this corn, you may be sure, in
their season, which was about the end of June; and laying up
every corn, I resolved to sow them all again, hoping in time.
to have some nuantity sufficient to supply me with bread;
but it was not till the fourth year that I would allow mvself.
the least grain of this corn to eat, and even then but sparing-
ly, as I shall say afterwards in its order; for I lost all lhat I
sowed the first season, by not observing the proper time, for
I sowed it just before the dry season, so that it never came
tip at all, at least, not as it would have done: of which, in its
place.
Besides this barley, there were, as above, twenty or thirty
stalks of rice, which I preserved with the same care, and
whose use was of the same kind, or to the same purpose,
viz. to make me bread, or rather food; for I found ways to
cook it up without baking, though I did that also, after some
time. But to return to my journal.
I worked excessive hard these three or four months, to
get my wall done; and the 14th of April, I closed it up, con-
triving to go into it, not by a door, but over the wall, by a
ladder, that there might be no sign on the outside of my ha-
bitation.
April 16 I finished the ladder, so I went up with the lad-
der to the top, and then pulled it up after me, and let it down
on the inside. This was a complete enclosure to me; for
within I had room enough, and nothing could come at me
from without, unless it could first mount my wall. ' >
The very next day after this wall was finished, I had al-
most had all my labour overthrown at once, and myself kil-
led. The case was thus: as I was busy in the inside of it,
behind my tent, just in the entrance into my cave, I was ter-
ribly frighted with a most dreadful surprising thing indeed;
for, all on a sudden. I found the earth came tumbling down
from the roof of my cave, and from the edge of the hill, over
my head, and two of the posts I had set up in the cave,
cracked in a frightful manner. I was heartily scared, but
thought nothing of what really was the cause; only thinking
that the top of my cave was falling in, as some of it had done
before, and, for fear t should be buried in it, 1 ran forwards
to my ladder: and, not thinking myself safe there neither, t
got over my wall. for fear of the pieces of the hill, which I
expected might roll down upon me. I was no sooner stepped
down upon the firm ground, but I plainly saw it was a terri-
ble earthquake; for the ground I stood on shook three times,
at about eight minutes distance, with three such shocks as
would have overturned the strongest building that could be
supposed to have stood upon the earth; and a great piece
of the top of a rock, which stood about half a mile from me
next the sea, fell down with such a terrible noise, as I never
heard in all my life. I perceived also the very sea was
put into a violent motion by it; and, I believe the shocks were
stronger under the water than on the island.
I was so amazed with the thing itself, having never felt the
like, or discoursed with any one that had, that I was like one
dead or stupified; and the motion of the earth made my
stomach sick, like one that was tossed at sea; but the noise of
the falling of the rock awaked me, as it were, and rousing
jne from the stupified condition I was in, filled me with hor-
ror; and I thought of nothing then but the hill falling upon
my tent, and all my household goods, and burying all at
once; and this sunk my very soul within me a second time.
After the third shock was over, and f felt no more for
some time, I began to take courage, and yet I had not heart
enough to get over my wall again, for fear of being buried
alive; but still sat upon the ground greatly cast down, and
disconsolate, not knowing what to do. All this while, I had
not the least serious religious thought, nothing but the com-
mon 'Lord, have mercy upon rne.1' and when it was over,
that went away too
While I sat thus, I found the air overcast, and it grew
cloudy, as if it would rain; and, in less than half an hour, it
blew a most dreadful hurricane of wind. The sea was all on.
a sudden covered with foam and froth, the shore was cover-
ed with the breach of the water, the trees were torn up by
the roots, and a terrible storm it was; and this held about
three hours, and then began to abate; and then in two hours
more it was calm, and began to rain very hard.
All this while, I sat upon the ground, very much terrified
and dejected; when, on a sudden, it came into my thoughts,
that these winds and rain, being the consequence of the earth-
quake, the earthquake itself was spent and over, and 1 might
venture into my cave again. With this thought my spirits began
to revive, and the rain helping also to persuade me, I went
in, and sat me down in my tent; hut the rain was so violent,
that my tent was ready to be beaten down with it, and I was
forced to go into my cave, though very much atraid and unea-
sy, for fear it should fall on my head.
This violent rain forced me to a new work, viz. toeut a
hole through my new fortification, like a sink, to let the wa-
ter go out, which would else have drowned my cave. After
1 had been in my cave some time, and found still no more
shocks of the earthquake follow, I began to be more com-
nosed; and now, to support my spirits, which mdeed wanted
it very much. I went to my little store, and took a small sup
of rum, which, however, I did then, and always very sparmg.
lv, knowing I conld have no more when that was gone.
It continued raining all that night, and great part of the
next day, so that t could not stir abroad; but, myf mmd bemg
more composed, I began to think of what 1 bad best do; con.
eludmg that if the island was subject to these earthquakes,
there would be no living for me in a cave, but 1 must consider
of building me some little hut, in an open place, which I
might surround with a wall, as I had done here, and so make
myself secure from wild beasts or men; but concluded, ill
staid where I was, 1 should certainly, one time or other, be
buried alive. ,
With these thoughts. I resolved to move my tent trom the
place where it stood, which was just under the hanging pre-
cipice of the hill, and which, if it should be shaken again,
would certainly fall upon my tent. And I spent the two next
days. being the 19th and 20th of April, in contriving where
and how to remove my habitation.
The fear of being swallowed up alive, made me that I ne-
ver slept in quiet; and yet the apprehension of lying abroad,
withoufan, fence, was almost equal to it: but still, when I
looked about, and saw how every thmg was put ,n order how
pleasantly concealed I was, and how safe from danger, it made
me very loath to remove. •
In-the mean time it occurred to me, that it would require
a vast deal of time for me to do this, and thai I must be con-
tented to run the venture where 1 was, till t had formed a
camp for myself, and had secured it so as to remove to it. So,
-with this resolution, I composed myself for a time, and re-
solved that I would go to work, with all speed, to build me a
wall, with piles and cables, &c in a circle, as before, ami set
my tent up in it, when it was finished! but that I would Ten-
ture to stay where I was, till it was finished, and fit to remove
to. This was the 21st I
April 22. The next morning I hegan to consider of means
to put this resolve in execution; but I was at a great loss about
my tools. I had three large axes, and abundance of hatchets^
(for we carried the hatchets for traffic with the Indians); but,
-with much chopping and cutting knotty hard wood, they
were all full of notches, and dull; and though I had a grind-
stone, I could not turn it, and grind my tools too. This cost
me as much thought as a statesman would have bestowed
upon a grand point of politics, or a judge upon the life and
death of a man. At length, I contrived a wheel, with a
string, to turn it with my foot, that I might have both my
hands at liberty. Note. I had not seen any such thing in
England, or at Least not to take notice how it was done, though
since I have observed it is very common there; besides that,
my grindstone was very large and heavy. This machine cost
me a full week's work, to bring it to perfection.
Aprl 28, 29. These two whole days I took up in grinding
my tools; my machine for turning my grindstone performing
very well.
April.SO. Having perceived my bread had been low a
great while, I now took a survey of it, and reduced myself to
one biscuit-cuke a day, which made my heart very heavy.
May 1 In the morning, looking towards the sea-side, the
tide being low, I saw something lie on the shore, bigger than
ordinary, and it looked like a cask; when I came to it, I
found a small barrel, and two or three pieces of the wreck of
the ship, which were driven on shove hy the late hurricane;
and, looking towards the wreck itself, I thought it seemed to
lie higher out of the water than it used to do I examined
the barrel which was driven on shore, and soon found it was
a barrel- of gunpowder, but it had taken-water, and the pow-
der was caked as hard as a stone; however, I rolled it farther
on s'iore for the present, and went on upon the sands a's near
as I could to the wreck of the ship to look for more.
When I came down to the ship, I found it strangely remo-
ved; the forecastle, which lay before buried in the sand, was
heaved up at least six feet; and the stern, which was broken
to pieces, and parted from the re&J by the foice of the sea,
soon alter I had left rummaging of her, was tossed, as it were,
np, and cast on one side; and the sand was thrown so high
on that side next the stern, that whereas there was a great
place of water before,. so that I could not come within a
quarter of a mile of the wreck without swimming, I could now
walk quite up to her when the tide was out. I was surprised
wilh this at first, but soon concluded that it must be done by
the earthquake; and as by this violence the ship-was more
broken open than formerly, so many things came daily on
shore, which the sea had loosened, and which the winds and
water rolled by degrees to the land.
This wholly diverted my thoughts from the design of re*-
moving my habitation; and I busied myself mightily, that day
especially, in searching whether I could make any way into'
into the ship; but I found nothing was to be expected of that
kind, for that all the inside of the ship was choaked up with
sand. However, as I had learnt not to despair of any thing,
I resolved to pull every thing to pieces that I could of the ship,
concluding that every thing I could get from her would be of
some use or other to me.
May 3. I began with my saw, and cut a piece of a beam
through, which -I thought held some of the upper part, or
quarter deck, - together; and when I had cut it through, I
cleared away the sand as well as I could, from the side which
lay highest; but the tide coming in, I was obliged to give over
for that time.
May 4 I went a fishing, but caught not one fish that I
durst eat of. till 1 was weary of my sport, when, just going to
leave off, I caught.a young dolphin. I had made me a long
line of some rope yarn, but I had no hooks; yet I frequently
caught fish enough, as much as I cared to eat; all which I
dried in the sun, and eat them dry.
May 5. Worked on the wreck, cut another beam asunder,
and brought three great fir-planks off from the decks, which
I tied together, and made swjm on shore, when the tide
of flood came on
May 6. Worked on the wreck, got several iron bolts out
of her, and other pieces of iron work: worked very hard, and
came home very much tired, and had thoughts of giving it
over.
May 7. Went to the wreck again, but with an intent not
to work; but found the weight of the wreckhad broken it-
self down, the beams being cut, that several pieces of the
ship seemed to lie loose, and the inside of the hold lay so
open, that I could see into it, but almost full of water and
sand.
May 8. Went to the wreck, and carried an iron crow to
wrench up the deck, which lay now quite clear of the water
or sand. I wrenched open two planks, and brought them on
shore also with the tide. I left the iron crow in the wreck
for next day.
May 9. Went to the wreck, and, with the crow, made
way into the body of the wreck, and felt several casks, and
loosened them with the crow; but could not break them up.
I felt also the roll of English lead, and could stir it; but it was
too heavy to move.
May 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. Went every dav to the wreck,
and got a great deal of pieces of timber, and boards, or planks,
and two or three hundred weight of iron.
May 15. I carried two hatchets, to try if I could not cut a
piece off the roll of lead, by placing the edge of one hatchet,
and driving it with the other; but as it lay about a foot and
a half in the water, 1 could not make any blow to drive the
hatchet.
May 16 It had Mowed hard in the night, and the wreck
appeared more broken by the force of the water: but I staid so
long in the woods, to gel pigeons for food, that the tide pre-
vented me going to the wreck that day. ,
May 17. I saw some pieces of the wreck blown on shore.
at a great distance, two miles off me: but resolved to see
what they » ere. and found it was a pieoe of the head; but
too heavy for me to bring away.
May 24. Every dav, to this day I worked on the wreck,
and, »iih hard labour, I loosened some things so much
.with the crow, that, the first Honing tide, several casks float-
ed out, and two of the seamen's chests; but the wind blowing
from the shore, nothing came to land that day, but pieces of
timber and a hogshead which had some Brasil pork in it;
hut the salt water and the sand had spoiled it.
I continued this work every day to the 15th of June, ex-
cept the time necessary to get food, which I always appointed
during this part of my employment, to be when the tide was
up. that I might be ready when it was ebbed out; and by 'his
time. I duo gotten timber and plank, and iron-work enough
(o have built a good boat, if I had known how; and also I got
at several times, and in several pieces, near one hundred

June 16. Going (iu-wu to the sea-side, 1 found a large tortoise
or turtle; this was the first I had seen, and which, it seems,
was only my misfortune, not any defect of the place, or scar-
city; for, had I happened to be on the other side of the
islandi I might have had hundreds of them.. every day, as I
found afterwards; but, perhaps, had paid dear enough for ihem.
June 17. I spent in cooking the turtle. I found in her
threescore eggs; and her flesh was to me at that time the
most savoury and pleasant that ever I tasted in my life, hav-
ing had no flesh but of goats and fowls, since I landed in this
horrible place.
June 18. Rained all the day,.and I staid within. I thought,
at this time, the rain felt cold, and I was something chilly,
which I knew was not usual in that latitude.
. June 19. Very ill, and shivering, as if the weather had
been cold. ;-...-.
June 20 No rest all night, violent pains in my head, and
feverish.
June 21. Very ill, frighted almost to death with the ap-
prehensions of my sad condition, to he sick, and no help.
Prayed to God,.for the first time since the storm off Hull;
but scarce knew what 1 said; or why: my thoughts being all
confused.
June 22. A little better; but under dreadful apprehen-
sions of sickness
June 23. Very bad again, cold and shivering, and then a
violent head-ach.
June 24. Much better.
June 25. An ague very violent; the fit held me seven
hours, cold fit and hot, with faint sweats after it.
June 26. Better; and having no victuals to eat, took my
gun, but found myself very weak: however, I killed a she-
goat, and with much difficulty, got it home, and broiled some
of it, and eat: I would fain have stewed it, and made some
broth, but had no pot.
June 27. The ague again so violent, that I lay abed all
day, and neither eat nor drank. I was ready to perish for
thirst, but so weak, I had not strength to stand up, or to get
myself any water to drink: prayed to God again, but was
light-headed; and when I was not, I was so ignorant, that I
G2
knew not what to say; only 1 lay, and cried, ' Lord, look
upon me! Lord pity me! Lord have mercy upon me! I sup-
pose I did nothing else for two or three hours, till the At
wearing off, I fell asleep, and did not awake till far in the
night. When I awaked, 1 found myself much refreshed, but
weak, and exceedingly thirsty; however, as I had no water in
my whole habitation', I was forced to lie mill morning. and
went to sleep again. In this second sleep, I had this terrible
dream:
I thought that I was sitting on the ground, on the outside
of my «all, where I sat when the storm blew after the earth-
quake, and that I saw a man descend from a great black
cloud, in a bright flame of fire, and light upon the ground.
He was all over as bright as a Same, so that I could but just
bear to look towards him: his countenance was most inex-
pressibly dreadful, impossible for words to describe-: when he
Stepped upon the ground with his feet, I thought the earth
trembled, just as it had done before in the earthquake: and
all the ait looked, to my apprehension, as if it had been filled
with flashes of fire.
He was no sooner landed upon the earth; but he moved
forward towards me, with a long spear or weapon in his hand,
to kill me; and when he came to a rising ground, at some
distance, he spoke to me, or I heard a voice so terrible, that
it is impossible to express the terror of it; all that I can say
I understood was this, ' Seeing all these things have not
-brought thee to repentance, now shalt thou die.' At which
fords, I thought he lifted up the spear that was in his hand,
to kill me.
No one that shall ever read this account, will expect that
I should be able to describe the horrors of my soul at this
terrible vision; I mean, that even while it was a dream. I
even dreamed of those horrors: nor is it any more possible
to describe the impression that remained upon my mind,
when 1 awaked, and found it was but a dream.
I had, alas! no divine knowledge- what I had received by
the good instruction of my father, was then worn out by an
uninterrupted series, for eight years, of seafaring wickedness,
and a constant conversation with none but such as were like my-
self, wicked and profane to the last degree. Ido not remember,
that I hart, m all ihat time, one thought that so much as
tended either to looking upwards toward God, or inwards tt><-
wards a reflection upon my own ways; but a certain stupidity
of soul, without desire of good, or conscience of evil, had en-
tire! -- overwhelmed me, and I was all that the most hardened,
un.limiting, wicked creature among our common sailors can
be supposed to be, not havmg the least sense either of the
fear of God in dangers^ or of thankfulness to God in delive-
rances
In the relatmg what is already past of my story, this will be
the more easily believed, when I shall add, that, through all
the variety of miseries that had to this day befallen me, X
never bad so much as one thought of its being the hand of
God, or that it was a just punishment for my sin, my rebel-
lious behaviour against my father; or my present sins, which.
were great; or so much as a punishment for the general
course of my wicked life. When I was on the desperate ex-
pedition, on the desert shores of \frica, I never had so much
as one thought of what would become of me, or one wish to
God to direct me whither I should go, or to keep me from dan-
ger, which apparently surrounded me, as well from voracious
creatures as cruel savages: but I was merely thoughtless of
God or a Providences I acted like a mere brute from the
principles of nature, and by the dictates of common sense
only, and indeed hardly that.
When I was delivered and taken up at sea by the Portugal
eaptain. well used, and dealt justly and honourably with, as
well as charitably, I had not the least thankfulness in my
thoughts: when again 1 was shipwrecked, ruined, and in dan-
ger of drowning on this island, I was as far from remorse, or
looking on il as a judgment; I only said to myself often, that
I was an unfortunate dog, and horn to be always miserable.
It is true, when I got on shore first here, and found all my
ship's crew drowned, and myself spared, I was surprised with
ft kind of extacy and some transports of soul, which, had the
grace of God assisted, might have come up to true thank-
fulness: but it ended where it began, in a mere common
flight of joy, or, as I may say, being glad I was alive, without
the least reflection upon the distinguishmg goodness of the
hand which had preserved me, and had singled me out to be
preserved, when all the rest were destroyed; or an inquiry
why Providence had been thus merciful to me; even just the
same common sort of joy which seamen generally have, af-
ter they have got safe ashore from a shipwreck, which they
drown ajl in the next bowl of punch, and forget almost m
soon as it is over; and all the rest of my life was like it..
Even when I was afterwards, on due consideration, made
sensible of my condition, how I was cast on this dreadful
place, out of the reach of human kind, out of all hope of re-
lief, or prospect of redemption, as soon as I saw n proba-
bility of living, and that I should not starve and perish for hun-
ger, all the sense of my affliction wore off, and I began to
be very easy, applied myself to the works proper for my
preservation and supply, and was far enough from being af-
flicted at my condition, as a judgment from Heaven, or as
the hand of God against me: these were thoughts which very
seldom entered into my head.
The growing up of the corn, as is hinted in my journal, had
at first some little influence upon me, and began to affect me
with seriousness, as long as I thought it had something mira-
culous in it; but as soon as ever that part of the thought was
removed, all the impression which was raised from it wore
oft- also, as I have noticed already.
Even the earthquake, though nothing could be more ter-
rible in its nature, or more immediately directing to the in-
visible l'ower which alone directs such things, yet no sooner
was the first fright over, but the impression it had madu
went off also. I had no more sense of God, or his judgments,
much less of the present affliction of my circumstances being
from his hand, than if I had been in the most prosperous con.
dition of life.
But now -when I began to be sick, and a leisurely view of
the miseries of death came to place itself before me;
when my spirits began to sink under the burden of a strong
distemper, and nature was exhausted with the violence of
the fever; conscience, that had slept so long, began to awake,
and I began to reproach myself with my past life, in which I
had so evidently, by uncommon wickedness, provoked the
justice of God to lay me under uncommon strokes, and to
deal with me in so vindictive a manner.
These reflections oppressed me from the second or third
day of my distemper, and in the violence, as well of the fever
as of the dreadful reproaches of my conscience, extorted
some words from me, like praying to God, though I cannot
say they were either a prayer attended with desires, or with
hopes; it was rather the voice of mere fright and distress:
my thoughts were contused, the convictions great upon my
mind, and the horror of dying in such a miserable condition,
raised vapours into my head, with the mere apprehensions;
and in these hurries of my soul, I knew not what my tongue
might express: but it was rather exclamation, such as,
* Lord! what a miserable creature am I' If I should be sick,
I shall certainly die for want of help, and what will be-
come of meH Then the tears burst out of my eyes, and I could
say no more for a good while.
In this interval, the good advice of my father came to my
mind, and presently his prediction. which I mentioned at the
beginning of this story: viz. That, if I did lake this foolish
step, God would not bless me, and I would have leisure here-
after to reflect upon having neglected his counsel, when.
there might be none to assist me in my recovery. ' Now,'
said I, aloud, ' my dear father's words are come to pass:
God's justice has overtaken me, and I have none to help or
hear me. 1 rejected the voice of Providence, which had
mercifully put me in a posture or station of life wherein I
might have been happy and easy; but 1 would neither see it
myself, uor learn to know the blessing of it from my parents:
I left them to mourn over my folly, and now I am left to
mourn under the consequences of it. I refused their help
and assistance, who would have lifted me into the world, and
would have made every thing easy to me: and now I have
difficulties to struggle with, too great for even nature itself to
support, and no assistance, no help, no comfort, no advice-
Then I cried out, ' Lord, be my help, for 1 am in great dis-
tress!'
This was the first prayer, if I might call it so, that I had
made for many years. Ilut I return to my journal.
June 28. Having been somewhat refreshed with the sleep
I had had, and the fit being entirely off, 1 got upi and though
the fright and terror of my dream was very great, yet 1 con-
sidered, that the fit of the ague would return again the next
day, and now was my time to get something to refresh and
support myself when 1 should be ill; and the first thing I
did, I filled a large square case bottle with water, and set it
upon my table, m reach of my bed: and, to take off the chill
or aguish disposition of the water, I put about a quarter of a
pint of rum into it, and mixed them together; then I got me
a piece of the goat's flesh, and broiled it on the coals, but
could eat very little; I walked about, but was very weak,
and withal, very sad and heavy-hearted in the sense of my
miserable condition, dreading. the return of my distemper
the next day; at night I made my supper of three of the tur-
tle's eggs, which I roasted in the ashes, and eat, as we call it,
in the shell; .and this was the first bit of meat 1 had ever
asked God's blessing to, even, as I could remember, in my
whole life.
After I had eaten, I tried to walk; but found myself so
weak, that I could hardly cany the gun (for I never went
out without that); so I went but a little way, and sat down
upon the ground, looking out upon the sea, which was just
before me, and very calm and smooth. As I sat here, some
such thoughts as these occurred to me.
What is this earth and sea, of which I have seen so much?
Whence is it produced? And what am I, and all the other
creatures, wild and tame, human and brutal, whence are we?
Sure we are all made by some secret power, who formed
the earth and sea, the air and sky; and who is that?
Then it followed most naturally: It is God that has made
it all. Well, but then it came on strongly: If God has made
all these things; he guides and governs them all, and all
things that concern them; for the Being that could make
all things, must certainly have power to guide and direct
them.
If so, nothing can happen in the great circuit of his works,
either without bis knowledge or appointment.
And if nothing happens without his knowledge, he knows
that I am here, and am in this dreadful condition; aud if
nothing happens without his appointment, he has appointed
all this to befall me.
Nothing occurred to my thoughts to contradict any of these
conclusions; and therefore it rested upon me with the greater
force, that it must needs be, that God has appointed all this
to befall me; that I was brought to this miserable circum-
stance by his direction, he having the sole power, not of me
only, but of every thing that happened in the world. Imme-
diately it followed,
Why has God done this to me? What have I done to be
thus used?
My conscience presently checked me in that inquiry, as if
I had blasphemed; and, methought it spoke to me like a
voice, Wretch! dost thou ask what thou hast done? Look
hack upon a dreadful mispent life, and ask thyself what thou
hast not done? Ask, Why is it that thou wert not long ago de-
stroyed? Why wert thou not drowned in Yarmouth roads?
killed in the fight, when the ship was taken by the Sallee man
of war? devoured by wild beasts on the coast of Africa? or,
drowned here, when all the crew perished but thyself?
Dost thou ask, What have I done?
I was struck dumb with these reflections, as one astonish-
ed, and had not a word to say, no, not to answer to myself;
but rose up, pensive and sad; walked back to my retreat, and
went up over my wall, as if I had been going to bed; but my
thoughts were sadly disturbed, and I had no inclination to
sleep; so I sat down in my chair, and lighted my lamp, for it
began to be dark. Now, as the apprehensions of the return
of my distemper terrified me very much, it occurred to my
thought that the Brasillians take no physic but their tobacco,
for almost all distempers; and I had a piece of a roll of tobac-
co m one of the chests, which was quite cured, and some also
that was green, and not quite cured.
I went, directed by Heaven, no doubt; for in this chest I
found a cure both for soul and body. I opened the chest and
found what I looked for, viz. the tobacco; and as the few books
1 had saved lay there too, I took out one of the Bibles whioh
I mentioned before, and which, to this time, I had not found
leisure, or so much as inclination, to look into: I say I took
it out, and brought both that and the tobacco with me to the
table.
What use to make of the tobacco I knew not, as to my dis-
temper, or whether it was good for me or no; but I tried se-
veral experiments with it, as if I was resolved it should hit one
way or other. I first took a piece of a leaf, and chewed it in
my mouth, which indeed, at first, almost stupified my brain;
the tobacco being green and strong, and that I had not been
much used to it: then I took some, and steeped it an hour or
two in rum, and resolved to take a dose of it when I lay down;
and lastly, 1 burnt some upon a pan of coals, and held my nose
close over the smoke of it, as long as I could bear it, as well
for the heat as the virtue of it, ar.d I held it almost to suffo-
cation.
In the interval of this operation, I took up the Bible, and
began to read, but my head was too much disturbed with the
tobacco to bear reading, at least at that time; only, having
opened the book casually, the first words that occurred to me
were these, ' Call on me in the day of trouble, and I will de-
liver, and thou shalt glorify me."
The words were very apt to my case, and made tome im-
pression upon my thoughts at the time of reading them,
though not so much as they did afterwards; for, as for being
delivered, the word had no sound, as I may say to me; the
thing was so remote, so impossible in my apprehension of
things, that I began to say as the children of Israel did, when
they were promised flesh to eat, ' Can God spread a table in
the wilderness?' Sol began to say, Can God himself deliver me
from this place? Vndasit was not for many years that any hope
appeared, this prevailed very often upon my thoughts. But,
however, the words made a great impression upon me, and I
mused upon them very often. It grew now late, and the to-
bacco had, as I said, dozed my head so much, that I inclined
to sleep; so Heft my lamp burning in the cave, lest I should
"want any thing in the night, and went to bed; but before I
lay down, I did what I never had done in all my life, I kneel-
ed dowD, and prayed to God to fulfil the promise to me, that,
if I called upon him in the day of trouble, he would deliver
me. After my broken and imperfect prayer was over, I
drank the rum in which I had steeped the tobacco, which
was so strong and rank of the tobacco, that indeed I could
scarce get it down. Immediately upon this I went to bed,
and I found precently it flew up into my head violently; but
I fell into a sound sleep and waked no more, till, by the sun,
it must necessarily be near three o'clock in the afternoon the
ne.it day; nay, to this hour, I am partly of the opinion that I
slept all the next day and night. and till almost three the day
after; for otherwise I knew not how I should lose a day out
df my reckoning in the days of the week, as it appeared some
years after I had done; for if I had lost it by crossmg and
re-crossing the line, I should have lost more than one day;
but certainly I lost a day in my account, and I never knew
which way.
Be that, however, one way or other, when I awaked, I
found myself exceedingly refreshed, and my spirits livel* and
cheerful. When I got up, I uas stronger than I was the day
before, and my stomach better; for I was hungry, and, in

short, I had no fit the next day, but continued much altered
for the better. This was the 29th.
The 30th was my well day, of coarse, and I went abroad
with my gun, but did not care to travel too far. I killed a
sea-fowl or two, something like a brand-goose, and brought
them home, but was not very forward to eat them; so I eat
some more of the turtles eggs, which were very good. This
evening I renewed the medicine, which I had supposed did
me good the day before, viz. the tobacco steeped in rum,
only I did not take so much as before, nor did I chew any
of the leaf, or hold my head over the smoke. However, I
was not so well the next day, which was the 1st of July as I
hoped I should have been; for I had a little spice of the
cold fit, but it was not much.
July 2. I renewed the medicine all the three ways, and
dosed myself with it as at first, and doubled the quantity
which 1 drank.
July 3. I missed the fit for good and all, though I did not
recover my full strength for some weeks after. While 1 was
thus gathering strength, my thoughts ran exceedingly upon
the Scripture. ' I will deliver thee;' and the impossibility of
my deliverance lay much upon my mind, in bar of my ever ex-
pecting it. But as 1 was discouraging my self with such
thoughts, it occurred to my mind, that I pored so much upon
my deliverance from the main affliction, that I disregarded
the deliverance I had received; and I was, as it were, made
to ask myself such questions as these: viz Havel not been
delivered, and wonderfully too, from sickness; from the most
distressed condition that could be, and that was so frightful
to me? And what notice had I taken of it? Had I done my
part? God had delivered me: but I had not glorified him;
that is to say, I had not owned and been thankful for that
as a deliverance, and how could I expect greater delive-
rance !
This touched my heart very much, and immediately I
kneeled down, and gave God thanks aloud, for my recovery
from sickness.
July 4. In the morning, I took the Bible; and beginning
at the New Testament, I began seriously to read it, and im-
posed upon myself to read a while every morning and every
night, not tying myself to a number of chapters, but as long
as my thoughts should engage me. It was not long after T
H
set seriously to this work, but I found my heart more deeply
and sincerely affected with the wickedness of my past life.
The impression of my dream revived, and the words, ' All
these things have not brought thee to repentance,' ran se.
riously in my thoughts. I was earnestly begging of God to
give me repentance, when it happened providentially, the
very day, that readmg the Scripture, I came to these words,
" He is exalted a Prince, and a Saviour to give repentance,
and to give remission ! I threw down the book, and, with
my heart, as well as my hands, lifted up to Heaven, in a kind
of extaoy of joy, I cried.out aloud, 'Jesus, thou Son of Da-
vid, Jesus, thou exalted Prince and Saviour, give me repen-
tance!'
This was the first time that I could say, in the true sense
of the words, that I prayed in all my life; for now I prayed
with a sense of my condition, arid with a true Scripture view
of hope, founded on the encouragement of the word of God;
and from this time, I may say, I began to have hope that
God would hear me.
Now I began to construe the words mentioned above,
* Call on me, and I will deliver you;' in a different sense from
what I had ever done before; for then I had no notion of any
thing being called deliverance, but my being delivered from
the captivity I was in, for though I was indeed at large in
the place, yet the island was certainly a prison to me, and
that in the worst sense in the world, but now 1 learned to
take it in another sense. Now, I looked back upon my past
life with such horror, and my sins appeared so dreadful, that
my soul sought nothing of God but deliverance from the load
of guilt that bore down all my comfort. As for my solitary
life, it was nothing; I did not so much as pray to be deliver-
ed from it, or thiek of it! it was all of no consideration in
comparison of this; and I add this part here, to hint to who-
ever shall read it, that whenever they come to a true sense of
things, they will find deliverance from 'Sin a much greater.
blessing, than deliverance from affliction.
But, leaving this part, I return to my journal
My condition began now to be, though not less miserable
as to my way of living, yet much easier to my mind; and my
thoughts being directed, by a constant reading the Scripture,
and praying to God, to things of higher nature, I had a great
deal of comfort within, which, till now, I knew nothing of.
Aiso, as my health and strength returned, I bestirred myself
to furnish myself with every thing that I wanted, and make
my way of living as regular as I could.
From the 4th of July to the 14th, I was chiefly employed
in walking about with my gun in my hand, a little and a little
at a time, as a man that waa gathering up his strength after
a fit of sickness: for it is hardly to be imagined how low I
was, and to what weakness I was reduced. The application
which I made use of, was perfectly new, and perhaps what
had never cured an ague before; neither can I recommend
it to any one to practise, by this experiment; and though it
did carry off the fit, yet it rather contributed to weaken me:
tur I had frequent convulsions in my nerves and limbs for
some time.
1 learnt from it also, this in particular, that being abroad
in the rainy season was the most pernicious thing to my
health that could be, especially in those rains which came at-
tended with storms, and hurricanes of wind; for as the rain
which came in a dry season, was always most accompanied
with sucli storms, so I found this rain was much more dan-
gerous than the rain which fell in September and October.
I had been now in this unhappy island above ten months:
all possibility of deliverance from this condition seemed to be
entirely taken from me; and I firmly believed that no human
shape had ever set font upon that place. Having now secur-
ed my habitation, as I thought, fully to my mind, I had a
great desire to make a more perfect discovery of the island,
and to see what other productions I might find, which yet I
knew nothing of.
It was the 15th of July that I began to take a more parti-
cular survey of the island itself 1 went up the creek first,
where, as 1 hinted, I brought my rafts on shore. I found, af-
ter I came about two miles up, that the tide did not flow any
higher; and that it was no more than a little brook of run-
ning water, and very fresh and good; but this being the dry
season, there was hardly any water in some parts of it, at
least not enough to run in any stream, so as it could be per-
ceived.
On the bank of this brook, I found many pleasant savannaa
or meadows, plain, smooth, and covered with grass; and, on
the rising parts of them, next to the higher grounds, where
the water, as it might be supposed, never overflowed, I found
a great ileal of tobacco, green, and growing to a great and
very strong stalk. There were divers other plants, which I
had no notion of, or understanding about. and might, per-
haps, have virtues of their own, which I could not find out.
I searched for the Cassava root, which the Indians, in all
that climate, make their bread off; but I could find none. I
saw large plants of aloes, but did not then understand them.
I saw several sugar canes, but wild, and, for want of cultiva-
tion, imperfect. I contented myself with these discoveries
for this time, and came back musing with myself what course
I might take to know the virtue anil goodness of any of the
fruits or plants which 1 should discover, but could bring it to
no conclusion; for, in short, I had made so little observation
while I was in the Brasils, that I knew little of the plants of
the field, at least very little that might serve me to any pur-
pose now in my distress
The next day, the 16th, I went up the same way again;
and, after going something farther than I had gone the
day before, I found the brook and the savannas began to
cease, and the country became more woody than before la
this part I found different fruits, and particularly I found
melons upon the ground in great abundance, and grapes upon
the trees: the vines had spread indeed over the trees, and the
clusters of grapes were just now in theii prime, very ripe and
rich. This was a surprising discovery, and I was exceeding
glad of them; but I was warned by my experience, to eat
sparingly of them, remembering that when I was ashore in
Bar .ary, the eating of grapes killed several of our English-
men who were slaves there, by throwing them into fluxes and
fevers: but I found an excellent use for these grapes, and
that was to cure or dry them in the sun, and keep them as
dried grapes or raisins are kept, which 1 thought would be,
as indeed they were, as wholesome, and as agreeable to eat,
when no grapes might be had.
I spent all that evening there, and went not back to my ha-
bitation. whieh by the way, was the first night, as I might
say. I had lain from home. In the night I took my first con-
trivance, and got up into a tree; where I slept well, and the
next morning proceeded upon my discovery, travelling near
four miles, as I might judge by the length of the valley,
keeping still due north, with a ridge of hills on the south and
north side of me.
At the end of this march, I came to an opening, where
the country seemed to descend to the west; and a little spring
of fresh water, which issued out of the side of the hill by me,
ran the other way, that is, due east; and the country appear-
ed so fresh, so green, so flourishing, every thing being in a
constant verdure or flourish of spring, that it looked like a
planted garden.
I descended a little on the side of that delicious valley,
surveying it with a secret kind of pleasure (though mixed
with other afflicting thoughts,) to think that this was all
my own, that I was king and lord of all this country indefea-
sibly, and had a right of possession; and, if I could convey
it, I might have it in inheritance, as completely as any lord
of a manor in England. I saw here abundance of cocoa-
trees, orange and lemon, and citron-trees; but all wild, and
few bearing any fruit, at least not then. However, the green
times that I gathered were not only pleasant to eat, but very
wholesome; and I mixed their juice afterwards wiih water,
which made it very wholesome, and very cool and refresh-
ings
I found now I had business enough to gather and carry
home; and I resolved to lay up a store, as well of grapes as
Ernes and lemons, to furnish myself for the wet season, which
1 knew was approaching. ~
In order to this, I gathered a great heap of grapes in
one place, and a lesser heap in another place, and a great
parcel cf limes and lemons in another place, and, taking a
few of each with me, I travelled homeward, and resolved to
come again, and bring a bag or sack, or what I could make,
to carry the rest home.
Accordingly, having spent three days in this journey, I
came home (sol must now call my tent and my cave); .but,
before I got thither, the grapes were spoiled: the richness
of the fruit, and the weight of the juice, having broken them
and bruised them, they were good for little or nothing; as to
the limes, they were good, but I could bring but a few.
The next day, being the 18th, I went baek, having made
me two small bags to bring home my harvest; but I was sur-
prised, when coming to my heap of grapes, which were so
rich and fine when I gathered them, 1 found them all spread
abroad, trod to pieces, and dragged about, some here,
some there, and abundance eaten and devoured. By this, I
1H
concluded, there were some wild creatures thereabouts,
which had done this; hut what they were, I knew not
However, as I found there was no laying them up on heaps,
and no carrying them away in a sack, but that one way they
would be destroyed, and the other way they would be crush,
ed by their own weight, I took another course; for I gathered
a large quantity of the grapes, and hung them upon the out-
branches of the trees, that they might cure and dry in the sun;
and as for the limes and lemons, I carried as many back as I
could well stand under.
When I came home from this journey, I contemplated
with great pleasure, the fruitfulness of that valley, and the
pleasantness of the situation, the security from storms on that
side of the water, and the wood; and concluded that I had
pitched upon a place to fix my abode, which was, by far, the
worst part of the country. Upon the whole, I began to con-
sider of removing my habitation, and to look out for a place
equally safe as where 1 now was situate, if possible, in that
pleasant fruitful part of the island.
This thought run long in my head, and X was exceeding
fond of it for some time, the pleasantness of the place temp-
ting me; but when I came to a nearer view of it, and to con-
sider that I was now by the sea-side, where it was at least
possible that something might happen to my advantage, and
'that the same ill fate that brought me hither, might bring
some other unhappy wretches to the same place; and though
it was scarce probable, that any such thing should ever hap-
pen, yet, to enclose myself among the hills and woods in the
centre of the island, was to anticipate my bondage, and to
render such an affair not only improbable, but impossible;
and that therefore I ought not, by any means, to remove.
However, I was so enamoured with this place, that I spent
much of my time there, for the whole remaining part of the
month of July; and though, upon second thoughts, I resolved
as above, not to remove, yet I built me a little kind of a
bower, and surrounded it, at a distance, with a strong fence,
being a double hedge, as high as I could reach, well staked
and filled between with brush-wood; and here I lay very se-
cure, sometimes two or three nights together, always going
over it with a ladder, as before, so that I fancied now I had
my country house, and my sea coast house; and this work
took me up to the beginning of August,
I had but newly finished my fence, ami began to enjoy my
labour when the rains came on, and made me stick close to
my first habitation; for though I had made me a tent like the
other, with a piece of a sail, and spread it very well, yet I
bad not the shelter of a hill to keep me from storms, nor a
care behind me to retreat into, when the rains were extraor-
dinary.
About the beginning of August, as I said, I had finished
»y bower, and began to enjoy myself. The 3d of August, I
found the grapes I had hung np were perfectly dried, and
indeed were excellent good raisins of the sun; so I began to
take them down from the trees, and it was very happy that
I did so, for the rains which followed would have spoiled them,
and I had lost the best part of my winter food; for I had
above two hundred large bunches of them. No sooner had
I taken them all down, and carried most of them home to my
caw, bnt it began to rain; and from hence, which was the
14th of August, it rained more or less every day, till the mic-
elle of October; and sometimes so violently that I could not
stir out of my cay for several days.
In this seasonal was much surprised with the increase of
my family. I had been concerned for the loss of one of my
cats, who ran away from me, or, as I thought had been dead;
and I heard no more tale or tidings of her, till, to my asto-
nishment, she came home about the end of August, with
three kittens. This was the more strange to me, because,
•hough I had killed a wild cat, as I called it, with my gun,
yet I thought it was a quite different kind from our European
cats; yet the young cats were the same kind of house-breed,
Eke the old one; and both my cats being females, I thought
it very strange. Rut from these three cats, I afterwards
came to be so pestered with cats, that I was forced to kill
them like vermin, or wild beasts, and to drive them from my
Louse as much as possible.
From the 14th of August to the 26th, incessant rain, so
that I could not stir, and was now very careful not to he
much wet. In this confinement I began to be straitened for
food; kut venturing out twice, I one day killed a goat; and
the last day, which was the 26i|i, found a very large tortoise,
aihicb was a treat to me, and my food was regulated thus: I
eat a bunch of raisms for my breakfast, a piece of the goat's
flesh, or of the turtle, for my dinner, broiled (for, to my great
/
misfortune, I had no vessel to boil or stew any thing), and
two or three of the turtle's eggs for supper.
Durmg this confinement m my cover by the rain, I worked
daily two or three hours at enlarging my cave; and by de-
grees, worked it on towards one side, till I came to the out-
side of the hill, and made a door or way out, which came
beyond my fence or wall, and so I came in and out this way.
But I was not perfectly easy at lying so open; for, as 1 had
managed myself before, I wasin a perfect enclosure, whereas
now I thought I lay exposed: and yet I could not perceive
that there was any living thing to fear, the biggest creature
that I had yet seen upon the island being a goat.
September the 30th. I was now come to the unhappy an-
niversary of my landing least up the notches on my post,
and found that I had been on shore three hundred and sixty-
five days. I kept this day as a solemn fast, setting it a part
to religious exercise, prostrating myself on the ground with
the most serious humiliation, confessing my sins to God, ac-
knowledging his righteous judgments upon me, and praying
to him to have mercy on me, through Jesus Christ; and
having not tasted the least refreshment for twelve hours, even
till the gomg down of the sun, I then eat a biseuit-cake, and
a bunch of grapes, and went to bed, finishing the day as I be-
gan it.
I had all this time observed no Sabbath day; for as at first
I had no sense of religion upon my mind, I had after some
time omitted to distinguish the weeks, by making a longer
notch than ordinary for the Sabbath-day, and so did not real-
ly know what any of the days were; but now having east up
the days as above, 1 found 1 had been there a year, sol divi-
ded it into Veeks, and set apart every seventh day for a Sab-
hath; though 1 found at the end of my account, I had lost a
day or two m my reckoning.
A little after this, my ink began to fail me, and so I con-
tented myself to use it more sparingly, and to writedown
only the most remarkable events of my life, without contmu-
ing a daily memorandum of other things
The rainy season, and the dry season, began now to appear
regular to me, and I learned to divide them so as to provide
for them accordingly. But I bought all my experience be-
fore I had it: and this I am going to relate, was one of the
most discouraging experiments that I made at all. I have
mentioned, that I had saved the few ears of barley and rice '
which I had so surprisingly found spring up, as I thought, of
themselves, and believe there were about thirty stalks of rice,
and about twenty of barley; and now I thought it a proper
time to sow it after the rains, the sun being in its southern
position, going from me.
Accordingly, I dug up a piece of ground, as Well as I could,
with my wooden spade, and dividing it into two parts, I sow-
ed my grain; but, as I was sowing, it casually occurred to
my thoughts, that I would not sow it all at first, because I
<hd not know when was the proper time for it; so I sowed
about two-thirds of the seed, leaving about a handful of each.
It was a great comfort to me afterwards that I did so, for
not one grain of that I sowed this time came to any thing;
for the dry months following, the earth having had no rain
after the seed was sown, it had no moisture to assist its
growth, and never came up at all, till the wet season had
come again, and then it grew as if it had been but newly
sown.
Finding my first seed did rot grow, which I easily imagined
was by the draught, I sought for a moister pieee of ground to
make another trial in; and I dug up a piece of ground near
my new bower, and sowed the rest of my seed in February, a
little before the vernal equinox; and this, having the rainy
months of March and April to water it, sprung up very plea-
santly, and yielded a very good crop; but having part of the
teed left only, and not daring to sow all that I had yet, I had but
a small quantity at last, my whole crop not amounting to
above half a peck of each kind.
But, by this experiment, I was made master of my busi-
ness, and knew exactly when the proper season was to sow;
and that I might expect two seed-times, and two harvests,
every year.
While this earn was growing, I made a little discovery,
-which was of use to me afterwards. As soon as the rains
-were over, and the weather began to settle, which was about
the month of November, I made a visit up the country to my
bower, where, though I had not been some months, jet I found
all things just as I left them The circle, or double hedge,
that I had made, was not only firm and entire, but the stakes
ithich I had cut off of some trees that grew thereabouts, were
all shot out, and grown with long branches, as much as a
willow-tree usually shoots the first year after lopping its head.
I could not tell what tree to call it that these stakes were cut
from. I was surprised, and yet very well pleased, to see the
young trees grow and I pruned them, and led them up to
grow as much alike as I could: and it is scarce credible how
beautiful a figure they grew into in three years, so that though
the hedge made a circle of about twenty-five yards, in diame-
ter, yet the trees, for such 1 might now call them, soon co-
vered it, and it was a complete shade, sufficient to lodge un-
der all the dry season.
This made me resolve to cut some more stakes, and make
me a hedge, like this, in a semicircle, round my wall, I mean.
that of my first dwelling, which I did, and placing the trees
or stakes in a double row, at about eight yards' distance from
my first fence, they grew presently, and were at first, a fine
cover to my habitation, and afterwards served for a defence
also, as I shall observe in its order.
I found now that the seasons of the year might generally
he divided, not into summer and winter, as in Europe; but
into the rainy season, and the dry season, which were gene-
rally thus:

The rainy season sometimes held longer or shorter, as the
winds happen to blow; but this was the general onservation
I made. Alter I had found, by experience, the ill consequence
of being abroad in the rain, I took care to famish my.
self with provisions before-hand, that I might not be obliged
to go out; and I sat within doors, as much as possible, during
the wet months.
In this time I found much employment (and very suitable
also to the time); for 1 found great occasion of many things
-which I had no way to furnish myself with, but by hard labour,
and constant application: particularly, I tried many ways to
make myself a basket; but all the twigs I could get for the
purpose proved so brittle, that they would do nothing. It
proved of excellent advantage to me now, that, when I was a
boy, I used to take great delight in standing at a basket-ma-
ker's, in the town where my father lived, to see them make
their wicker-ware; and being, as boys usually are, very offi-
cious to help, and a great observer of the manner how they
-worked those things, and sometimes lending a hand, I had,
by this means, so full knowledge of the methods of it, that I
wanted nothing but the materials: when it came into my mind,
that the twigs of that tree, from whence I cut my stakes that
grew, might possibly be as tough as the sallows and w Hows,
and osiers in England; and I resolved to try.
Accordingly, the next day; I went to my country house, as
I called it, and cutting some of the smaller twigs, I found
them to my purpose as much as I could desire: wherenpon
I came the next time prepared with a hatchet to cut down a
quantity, which I soon found, for there was great plenty of
them. These I set up to dry within my circle or hedge, and
when they were fit for, use, I carried them to my cave; and
here, during the next season, I employed myself in making,
as well as I could, a great many baskets, both to carry earth,
or to carry or lay up any thing, as I had occasion; and
though I did not finish them very handsomely, yet I made
them sufficiently serviceable for my purpose: and thus, after-
wards, 1 took care never to be without theni. and, as my
wicker-ware decayed, I made more; especially I made strong
deep baskets to place my corn in, instead of sacks, when I
should come to have any quantity of it.
Having mastered this difficulty, and employed a world of
time about it, I bestirred myself to see, if possible, how to
supply two wants I had no vessels to hold any thing that was
liquid, except two runlets, which were almost full of rum, and
some glass bottles, some of the common size, and others
which were case hotlles square, for the holding of water,
spirits, &c. I had not so much as a pot to boil any thing in,
except a great kettle which 1 saved out of the ship, and which
was too big for such uses as I desired it lor, viz. to make broth,
and stew a bit of meat by itself. The second thing I would
fain have had, was a tobacco-pipe, but it was impossible lor
me to make one: however, 1 found a contrivance for that too
at last.
I employed myself in planting my second rows of stakes or
piles; and in this wicker-work, all the summer, or dry season;
when another business took me up more time than it could
be imagined 1 could spare.
I mentioned before, that I had a great mind to see the
whole island, and that I had travelled up the brook, and so
on to where I built my bower, and where I had an opening
Suite to the sea, on the other side of the island. I now re-
solved to travel quite across to the sea-shore on that side; so
taking my gun, a hatchet, and my dog, and a larger quantity
of powder and shot than usual, with two biscuit cakes, and a
large bunch of raisins in my pouch, for my store, i began my
journey When I had passed the vale where my bower
stood, as above, I came within view of the sea, to the west;
and it being a very clear day, I fairly descried land, whether
an island or a continent, I could not; tell; but it lay very high, .
extending from the west, to the W S. W. at a very great
distance: by my guess, it could not be less than fifteen or
twenty leagues off.
I could not tell what part of the world this might be, other-
wise than that I knew it must be part of America; and, as I
concluded, by all my observations, must be near the Spanish
dominions, and perhaps was all inhabited by savages, where,
if I should have landed, I had been in a worse condition than
I was now; and therefore 1 acquiesced in the dispositions of
Providence, which I began now to own, and to believe, or-
dered every thing for the best; I say, I quieted my mind withv
this, and left afflictmg myself with fruitless wishes of being
there.
Besides, after some pause upon this affair, I considered,
that if this land was the Spanish coast, I should certainly, one
time or other, see some vessels pass or repass one way or
other; but if not, then it was the savage coast between the
Spanish country and Brasils, which were indeed the worst oV
savages, for they are cannibals, or men -eaters, and fail not to
murder and devour all the human bodies that fall into their
hands.
With these considerations I "walked very leisurely forward.
I found that side of the island where I now was much pleasan-
ter than mine, the open or savanna fields sweet, adorned with
flowers and grass, and full of Very fine woods. I saw abun-
dance of parrots, and fain would I have caught one, if possi-
ble; to have kept it to be tame, and taught it to speak to me.
I did, after some pains-taking, catch a young parrot; for I
knocked it down with a stick, and having recovered it, I
brought it home, but it was some years before I could make
him speak. However, at last I taught him to call me by my
name very familiarly. But the accident that followed, though
it be a trifle, will be vei-y diverting in its place.
I was exceedingly diverted with this journey. I found in
the low grounds; hares, as I thought them to be, and foxes,
but they differed greatly from all the other kinds I had met
with; nor could 1 satisfy myself to eat them, though I killed
several. But I had no need to be venturous, for I had no
want of food, and of that which was very good too; especial-
ly these three sorts, viz. goats, pigeons, and turtle or tortoise,
which, added to my grapes, Leadenhall market could not
have furnished a table better than I, in proportion to the com-
pany. And though my case was deplorable enough, yet I
had great cause for thankfulness, that I was not driven to
any extremities for food; but had rather plenty even to dain-
ties.
I never travelled in this journey above two miles outright
in a day, or thereabouts; but I took so many turns and re.
turns to see what discoveries I could make, that I came
weary enough to the place where I resolved to sit down for
all night; and then 1 either reposed myself in a tree, or sur-
rounded myself with a row of stakes set uprightin the ground,
either from one tree to another, or so as no wild creature
could come at me, without waking me.
As soon as I came to the sea-shore, I was surprised to see
that I had taken up my lot on the worst side of the island;
for here indeed the shore was covered with innumerable tur-
tles; whereas on the other side I had found but three in a
year and a half. Here was also an infinite number of fowls,
of many kinds, some of which I had seen, and some of
I
which I had not seen before, and many of them very good
meat; bat such as I knew not the names of, except those cal-
led penguins.
I could have shot as many as I pleased, but was very sparing
of my powder and shot; and therefore had more mind to kill
a she-goat, if I could, which I could better feed on. And
though there were many goats here more than on my side of
the island, yet it was with much more difficulty that I could
come near them, the country being flat and even, and they
saw me much sooner than when I was on the hills.
I confess this side of the country was much pleasanter
than mine, but yet I had not the least inclination to remove;
for as I was fixed in my habitation, it became natural to me;
and I seemed all the while I was here, to be, as it were, upon a
journey, and from home. However, I travelled along the
shore of the sea, towards the east, I suppose about twelve
miles; and then setting up a great pole upon the shore. for a
mark, I concluded I would go home again; and that the next
journey I took should be on the other side of the island, east
from my dwelling, and so round, till I came to my post again:
of which in its place.
I took another way to come back than that I went, think-
ing I could easily keep all the island so much in my view,
that I could not miss fmding my first dwelling, by viewing the
country: but 1 found myself mistaken; for being come about
two or three miles, I found myself descended into a very
large valley, but so surrounded with hills, and those hills
covered with woods, that I could not see which was my way
by any direction but that of the sun, nor even then, unless I
knew very well the position of the sun at that time of the
day
It happened to my farther misfortune, that the weather
proved hazy for three or four days, while I was in this valley;
and not being able to see the sun, 1 wandered about very un-
comfortably, and at last was obliged to find out the sea-side,
look for my post, and come back the same way I went; and
then, by easy journeys, I turned homeward, the weather being
exceeding hot: and my gun, ammunition, hatchet, and other
things, very heavy.
In this journey my dog surprised a young kid, and seized
upon it; and I running in to take hold of it, caught it, and
saved it alive from the dog. I had a great mind to bring it
home, if I could; for 1 had often been musing whether it
might not be possible to get a kid or two, and so raise a breed
of tame goats, which might supply me when my powder and
shot should be all spent.
I made a collar to this little creature, and with a string
which 1 made of some rope-yarn, which I always carried about
me, I led him along, though with some difficulty, till I came
to my bower, and there I enclosed him, and left him; for I
was very impatient to he at home, from whence 1 had been
absent above a month.
I cannot express what a satisfaction it was to me to come
into my old hutch, and lie down in my hammock-bed. This
little wandering journey, without any settled place of abode,
had been so unpleasant to me, that my own house, as I called
it to myself, was a perfect settlement to me, compared to that;
and it rendered every thing about me so comfortable, that I
resolved 1 would never go a great way from it again, while it
should be my lot to stay on the island.
I reposed myself here a week, to rest and regale myself
after my long journey, during which, most of thetime was
taken up in the weighty affair of making a cage for my poll,
who began now to be a mere domestie, and to be mighty well
acquainted with me Then I began to think of the poor kid,
which I had pent within my little circle, and resolved to go
and fetch it home, or give it some food: accordingly I went,
and found it where I left it, for indeed it could not get out,
but was almost starved for want of food I went and cut
boughs of trees, and branches of such shrubs as I could find,
and threw it over; and having fed it, I tied it as I did before,
to lead it away; but it was so tame with being" hungry, that I
had no need to have tied it, for it followed me like a dog:
and as I continually fed it, the creature became so loving, so
gentle, and so fond, that it became, from that time, one of
my domestics also, and would never leave me afterwards.
The rainy season of the autumnal equinox was now come,
and I kept the 30th of September in the same solemn man-
ner as before, being the anniversary of my landing on the
island, having now been there two years, and no more pros-
pect of being delivered than the first clay I came there. I
spent the whole day in humble and thankful acknowledgments
of the many wonderful mercies which my solitary condition
was attended with, and without which it might have been in-
finitely more miserable. I gave humble and hearty thanks,
that God had been pleased to discover to me, even that it was
possible I might be more happy in this solitary condition,
than I should have been in a liberty of society, and in all the
pleasures of the world; that he could fully make up to me the
deficiencies of my solitary state, and the want of human so-
ciety, by his presence, and the communications of his grace
to my soul, supporting, comforting, and encouraging me to
depend upon his providence here, and hope for his eternal
presence hereafter.;'
It was now that I began sensibly to feel how much more
happy the life I now led was, with all its miserable circum-
stances, than the wicked, cursed, abominable life I led all the
past part of my days; and now having changed both my sor-
rows and my joys, my very desires altered, my affections
changed their gusts, and. my delights were perfectly new,
from what they were at my first coming, or indeed for the
two years past .
Before, as I walked about, either on my hunting, or for
viewing the country, the anguish of my soul at my condition
would break out upon me on a sudden, and my very heart
would die within me, to think of the woods, the mountains,
the desarts I was in; and how I was a prisoner locked up,
with the eternal bars and bolts of the ocean, in an uninhabited
wilderness, without redemption. In the midst of the greatest
composures of my mind, this would break out upon me, like
a storm, and make me wring my hands, and weep like a child.
Sometimes it would take me in the middle of my work, and
I would immediately sit down and sigh, and look upon the
ground for an hour or two together, and this was still worse
to me; for if I could burst out into tears, or vent myself by
words, it would go off, and the grief, having exhausted itself,
would abate.
But now I began to exercise myself with new thoughts. I
daily read the word of God, and applied all the comforts of it
to mv present state. One morning,' being very sad, I opened
the Bible upon these words, 'I will never, never leave thee, nor
forsake thee!' Immediately it occurred, that these words
were to me; why else should they be directed in such a man-
ner, just at the moment when I was mourning over my con-
dition, as one forsaken of God and man? 'Well then,' said I,
•if God does not forsake me, of what ill consequence can it
be, or what matters it, though the world should all forsake me,
seeing, on the other hand, if I hid all the world, and should
lose the favour and blessing of God, there would be no
comparison in the loss?
From this moment I began to conclude in my mind that it
was possible for me to be more happy in this forsaken, solita-
ry condition, than it was probable I should have ever been in
any other particular state in the world; and, with this thought,
I was going to give thanks to God for bringing me to this
place.
I know not what it was, but somethmg shocked my mind at
that thought, and I durst not speak the words ' How canst thou
be such a hypocrite (said I, even audibly), to pretend to be
thankful for a condition which, however thou mayest endea-
vour to be contented with, thou wouldst rather pray heartily
to be delivered from?' So I stopped there. But though I
could not say, 1 thanked God for being there; yet I sincerely
gave thanks to God for opening my eyes, by whatever afflic-
ting providences, to see the former condition of my life, and
to mourn for my wickedness, and repent. I never opened the
Bible, or shut it, btft my very soul within me blessed God for
directing my friend in England, without any order of mine, to
pack it up among my goods, and for assisting mc afterwards
to save it out of the wreck of the ship.
Thus, and in this disposition of mind, I began my third
yean and though I have not given the reader the trouble of so
particular an account of my works this year as the first; yet
in general it may be observed, that I was very seldom idle,
having regularly divided my time according to the several
daily employments that were before me; such as, First, My
duty to God, and reading the Scriptures, which I constantly
set apart some time for, thrice every day. Secondly, The
going abroad with my gun for food, which generally took me
up three hours in every morning, when it did not ram.
Thirdly, The ordering, curing, preserving, and cooking what
I had killed or catched for my supply, these took up great
part of the day Also it is to be considered, that the middle
of the day, when the sun was in the zenith, the violence of
the heat was too great to stir out, so that about four hours in
the evening was all the time I could be supposed to work in;
with this exception, that sometimes I changed my hours of
12
hunting and working, and went to work in the morning, and
abroad with my gun in the afternoon.
Tn this short time allowed for labour, I desire may be ad-
ded the exceeding laboriousness of my work, the many hours
which, for the want of tools, want of help, and want of skill,
every thin;; that I did, took up out of my time. For example,
I was full twoand-forty days making me a board for a long
shelf, which I wanted in my cave; whereas two sawyers, with
their tools and a sawpit, would have cut six of them, out of
the same tree, in half a day.
My case was this: it was to be a large tree which was to
be cut down, because my board was to be a broad one. This
tree I was three days a cutting down, and two more cutting off
the boughs, and reducing it to a log or piece of timber. With
inexpressible hacking and hewing, I reduced both the sides
of it into chips, till it began to be light enough to move; then
I turned it, and made one side of it smooth and flat as a
board, from end to end; then turning that side downward, cut
the other side, till I brought the plank to be about three in-
ches thick, nd smooth on both sides. Any one may judge
the labour of my hands in such a piece of work; but labour
and patience carried me through that, and many other things.
I only observe this in particular, to show the reason wby so
much of my time went away with so little work, viz. that
what might be a little to be done with help and tools, was a
vast labour, and required a prodigious time to do alone, and
by hand.
But, notwithstanding this, with patience and labour I went
through many things, and indeed every thing that my cir-
cumstances made necessary for me to do, as will appear by
what follows.
I was now in the months of November and December, ex.
pecting my crop of barley and rice. The ground I had
manured or dug tip for them was not great; for, as I obser-
ved, my seed of each was not above the quantity of half a
peck, for I had lost one whole crop by sowing in the dry sea-
son, but now my crop promised very well, when, on a sud-
den I found I was in danger of losing' it all again, by enemies
of several sorts, which it was scarce possible to keep from it;
as first, the goats, and wild creatures which I called hares, - ~
who, tasting the sweetness of the blades, lay in it night ami
day, as soon as it came up, anil eat it so close, that it could
get no time to shoot up into stalk.
This I saw no remedy for, but my making an enclosure
about it with a hedge, which I did with a great deal of toil,
and the more because it required speed, the creatures daily
spoiling my corn- However, as my arable land- was but small,
suited to my crop, I got it totally well fenced in about three
week's time; and shooting some of ihe creatures in the day
time, 1 set my dug to guard it in the night, tying him up to a
stake at the gate, where he would stand and bark all night
long; so, in a little time, the enemies forsook the place, and
the corn grew very strong and well, and began to ripen
apace.
Hut, as the beasts ruined me before, while my corn was
in the blade, so the birds were as likely to ruin me now, when it
was in the ear, for going along by the place to see how it
throve, I saw my little cTop surrounded with fowls. of I know
not how many sorts, who stood, as it were, watching till I
should be gone. I immediately let fly among them (for 1 al-
ways had my gun with me). I had no sooner shot, but there
rose up a little cloud of fowls, which I had not seen at all,
from among the corn itself.
This touched me sensibly; for I foresaw that, in a few
days, they would devour all my hopes; that I should be star-
ved, and never be able to raise a Clop at all; and what to do,
I could not tell However, I resolved not to lose my corn, if
possible, though I should watch it night and day. In the first
place, I went among it to see what damage was already done,
and found they had spoiled a good deal of it; but that, as it
was yet too green for them, the loss was not so great, but
that the remainder was like to be a good crop, if it could be
saved.
I staid by it to load my gun, and then coming away, I could
easily see the thieves sitting upon all the trees about me, as if
they only waited till I was gone away, and the event proved
it to be so; for as I walked offas if I was gone, I was no sooner
out of their sight, hut they dropped down one by one, into
the corn again. I was so provoked, that I could not have
patience to stay till more came on, knowing that every grain
that they eat now. was, as it might be said, a peck loaf to me
in the consequence; but, coming up to the hedge, I fii-ed
again, and killed three of them. This was what I wished
for' so I took them up, and served them as we serve noto-
rious thieves in England, viz. hanged {.hum in chains for a
terror to others. It is impossible to imagine almost that this
should have such an effect as it it had for the fowls would
not only not come at the corn, but in short, they forsook all
that part of the island, and I could never see a bird near the
place as long as my scarecrows hung there.
Thi.s I was very glad of, you may be sure; and about the
latter end of December, which was our second harvest of the
year, I reaped my crop. *
I was sadly put to it for a scythe, or a sickle, to cut it down,
and all 1 could do was to make one as well as I could,
out of one of the broad swords, or cutlasses, which I saved
among the arms out of the ship. However, as my crop was"
but small, I had no great difficulty to cut it down. In short,
I reaped it my way; for I cut nothing off but the ears, and
carried it away in a great basket which I had made, and so
rubbed it out with my hands. And at the end of all my har-
vesting, I found thnt, out of my half peck of seed, I had near
two bushels of rice and above two bushels and a half of bar-
ley; that is to say, by my guess, for I had no measure at that
time
However, this was a great encouragement to me; and I
foresaw that, in time, it would please dod to supply me with
bread. And yet here I was perplexed again, for I neither
knew how to-giind or make meal of my corn, or indeed how
to clean it, and part it; nor, if made into meal, how to make
bread of it; and if how to make it, yet I knew not how- to
bake it These things being added to my desire of having a
good quantity for store, and to secure a constant supply, I
resolved not to taste any of this crop, but to preserve it all for
seed against the next" season, and, in the mean time, to em-
ploy all my study and hours of working to accomplish this
great work of providing myself with corn and bread
Ii might be truly said, that now I worked for my bread.
It is a little wonderful, and what I believe few people have
thought much upon; viz the strange multitude of little things
necessary in the providing, producing, curing, dressing,
making, and finishing this one article of bread-
I, that was reduced to a mere stale of nature, found this to
be my dady discouragement, and was made more and more
sensible of it every hour, even after I had got the first handful
of seed-corn, which, as I have said, came up unexpectedly,
and indeed to a surprise.
First, I had no plough to turn up the earth, no spade or
shovel to dig it. Well, this I conquered by making a wooden
spade, asl observed before; but this did my work but in a wooden
manner: and though it cost me a great many days to make
it, yet for want of iron it not only wore out the sooner. but
made my work the harder, and made it be performed much
worse.
However, this I bore with, and was content to work it out
with patience, and bear with the badness of the performance.
When the corn was sowed, I had no harrow: but was forced
to go over it myself, and drag a great heavy bow of a tree over
it, to scratch the earth, as it may be called, rather than
rake or harrow it.
When it was growing and grown, I have observed already
how many things I wanted, to fence it, secure it. mow or reap
it, cure and carry it home, thresh, part it from the chaff, and
save it. Then I wanted a mill to grind it, sieves to dress it,
yeast and salt to make it into bread, and an oven to bake it
in; and yet all these things I did without, as shall be observed;
and yet the corn was an inestimable comfort and advantage
to me too. All this, as I said, made every thing laborious
and tedious to me, but that there was no help for: neither
was my time so much loss to me, because as I had divided it,
a certain part of it was every day appointed to these works;
and, as I resolved to use none of the corn for bread, till I
had a greater quantity by me, 1 had the next six months to
apply myself wholly by labour and mvention to furnish myself
with utensils proper for the performing all the operations
necessary for the making the corn, when I had it fit for my
use.
But, first, I was to prepare more land, for I had now seed
enough to sow above an acre of ground. Before I did this, I
had a week's work at least to make me a spade, which, when
it was done, was but a sorry one indeed, and very heavy, and re-
quirer! double labour to work with it. However,! went through
that, and sowed my seed in two large flat pieces of ground, as
near my house as I could find them to my mind, and fenced them
in with a good hedge, the stakes of which were all cut of that
wood, which I had set before, which I knew would grow; so that
in one year's time, I knew I shoukl have a quick or living hedge,
that would want but little repair. This work was not so lit-
tle as to take me up less than three months because great
part of that time was of the wet season, when I could not go
abroad.
Within doors, that is, when it rained, and I could not go
Out, I found employment on the following occasions; always
observing, that all the while I was at work, I diverted myself
with talking to my parrot, and teaching him to speak; and
I quickly learned him to know his own name, at last, to speak
it out pretty loud, 'Poll;' which was the first word I ever
heard spoken in the island by any mouth but my own. This
therefore was not my work, but an assistant to my work; for
now, as I said, I had a great employment upon my hands, as
follows, viz I had long studied, bv some means or other, to
make myself some earthen vessel, which indeed I wanted
sorely, but knew not where to come at them. However,con-
sidering the heat of the climate, I did not doubt but, if I could
find out any such clay, I might botch up some such pot. as
might, being dried in the sun, be hard enough, and strong
enough, to hear handling, and to hold any thing that was dry,
and required to be kept so; and as this was necessary in pre-
paring corn, meal, &c. which was the thing I was upon, i
resolved to make some as large as I could, and fit only to
stand like jars to hold what should be put into them.
Ii would make the reader pity me, or rather laugh at me,
to tell how many awkward ways 1 took to raise this paste;
what odd, mishapen, ugly things I made; how many of them
fell in, and how many fell out, the clay not being stiff enough
to bear its own weight; how many cracked by the over vio-
lent heat of the sun, being set out too hastily; and how many
fell to pieces with only removing, as well before as after they
were dried: and, in a word, how, after having laboured hard
to find the clay to dig it, to temper it, to bring it home, and
work it, I could not make above two large, earthen, ugly-
things, 1 cannot call them jars, in about two months labour.
However, as the sun baked these two very dry and hard, I
lifted them very genllc up, and set them down again in two
great wicker-baskets, which I had made on purpose for them,
that they might not break- and as between the pot and the
basket there was little room to spare. I stuffed it full of rice
and barley-straw; and these two pots, being to stand always
dry, I thought would hold my dry corn, and perhaps the meal
when the corn was bruised
Though I miscarried so much in my design for large
pots, yet I made several smaller things with better success;
such as little round pots, flat dishes, pitchers, and pipkins, and
any thing my hand turned to; and the heat of the sun baked
them strangely hard.
But all this would not answer my end, which was to get an
earthen pot to hold what was liquid, and bear the fire, which
none of these could do. It happened after some time, making
a pretty large fire for cooking my meat, when I went to put
it out, after 1 had done with it, I found a broken piece of one.
of my earthen ware vessels in the fire, burnt as hard as a
stone, and red as a tile. I was agreeably surprised to see it,
and said to myself, that certainly they might be made to burn
whole, if they would burn broken.
This set me to study how to order my fire, so as to make it
burn me some pots. I had no notion of a kiln, such as the
potters burn in. or of glazing them with lend, though 1 had
some lead to do it with; hut I placed three large pipkins, and
two or three pots, in a pile one upon another, and placed my
fire wood all round it with a great heap of embers under them.
I plied the fire with fresh fuel round the outside, and upon.
the top, till I saw the pots in the inside red-hot quite through,
and observed that they did not crack at all. When I saw
them clear red, I let them stand in that heat about five or six
hours, till I found one of them, though it did not crack, did
melt or run; for the sand which was mixed with the clay
melted by the violence of the heat, and would have run into
glass, if I hud gone on; so I slacked my fire gradually, till the
pots began to abate of the red colour, and watching them all
night, that I might not let the fire abate too fast, in the morn-
ing I bad three very good, I will not say handsome, pipkins,
and two other earthen pots, as hard burnt as could be desir-
ed; and one of them perfectly glazed with the running of the
sand.
After this experiment, I need not say that I wanted no
sort of earthen-ware for my use; but I must needs say, as to
the shapes of them, (hey were very indifferent, as any one
may suppose, when I had no way of making them, but as chc
children make dirt-pies, or as a woman would make pies that
never learnt to raise paste.
No joy at a thing of so mean a nature was ever equal to
jftine, when I found I had made an earthen pot that would
heai- the fire; anil I had hardly patience to stay till they were
cold. before 1 set one upon the fire again, with some water in
it, to boil me some meat, which it did admirably well; and,
wilh the piece of a kid, I made some very good broth, though
I wanted oatmeal, and several other ingredients requisite to
make it as good as I would have had it.
My next concern was to get me a stone mortar to stamp
or beat some corn in; for as to the mill, there was no thought
of arriving to that perfection of art, with one pair of hands.
To supply this want I was at a great loss; for, of all trades in
tht world, I was as perfectly unqualified for a stonecutter, as
for any whatever: neither had I any tools to go about it with.
1 spent many a day to find out a great stone big enough to
cut hollow, and make fit for a mortar, and could find none at
all, except what was in the solid rock, and which I had no
wav to dig or cut out, nor indeed were the rocks in the island
of hardness sufficient, but were all of asandy crumbling stone,
which would neither bear the weight of a heavy pestle, nor
would break the corn without fillmg it with sand. So, after
a great deal of time lost in searching for a stone, I gave it
over, and resolved to look out a great block of hard wood,
which I found indeed much easier; and getting one as big
as I had strength to stir, I rounded it, and formed it on the
outside with my axe and hatchet; and then, wilh the help of
fire, and infinite labour, made a hollow place in it, as the
Indians in Brasil make their canoes. After this, I made a
great heavy pestle or heater, of thle wood called the iron-
wood, and this I prepared and laid by against I had my
next crop of corn, when I proposed to myself to grim! or
rather pound, my corn into meal to make my bread.
My next difficulty was to make a sieve, or senrce, to
dress my meal, and o part it from the bran and the husk,
without which I did not see it possible I could have. any
Dread. This was a most difficult thing, so much as hut to
think on; for, to be sure, I had nothing like the necessary
thing to make it with, I mean fine thin canvas, or stuff to
scarce the meal through. And here I was at a full stop for
many mouths; nor did I really know what to do: linen I
had none left but what was mere rags. I had goats' hair,
but neither knew I how to weave or spin it; and had I known
how, here were no'ools te work it with: all the remedy that
I found for this, was, that at best I did remember I had,
among the seamen's clothes, which were saved out "of the
ship, some neckcloths of calico or muslin; and with some
pieces of these I made three small sieves, but proper enough
for the work: and thus I made shift for some years. How I
I did afterwards, I shall show in its place
The baking part was the next thing to be considered, and
how I should make bread when I came to have corn; for,
first, I had no yeast. As to that part, as there was no sup-
plying the want, so I did not concern myself much about it;
but for an oven, I was indeed in great pain. \*. length, I
found out an expedient for that also, which was this: I made
some earthen vessels very broad, but not deep; that is to say,
about two feet diameter, and not above nine inches deep:
these I burnt in the fire, as I had done the other, and laid
them by, and when I wanttd to bake, I made a great fire
upon my hearth, which I had paved with some square tiles,
of my own making and burning also: but I should not call
them square-
When the fire wood was burnt pretty much into embers,
or live coals, 1 drew them forward upon this hearth, so as to
cover it all over: and there I let them lie, till the hearth was
very hot, then sweeping away all the embers, I set down my
loaf or loaves, and, whelming down the earthen pot upon
them, drew the embers all round the outside of the pot, to
keep in, aud add to the heat and thus, as well as in the best
oven in the world, I baked my barley .loaves, and became, in
a little time, a mere pastry-cook into the bargain; for I made
myself several cakes of the rice, and puddings: indeed I made
no pies, neither had I any thing to put into them, supposing
I had, except the flesh either of fowls or goats.
It need not be wondered at, if all these things took me up
most part of the third year of my abode here; for it is to be
observed, that in the intervals of these things, I had my new
harvest and husbandry to manage, for I reaped my corn in its
season, and carried it home as well as I could, and laid it up
in the ear, in my large baskets, till I had time to rub it out;
for I had no floor to thresh it on, or instrument to thresh it
with.
And now indeed my stock of corn increasing, I really wan-
ted to build mv barns bigger. I wanted a place to lay it up
K
f
in; for the increase of the corn now yielded me sa much, that
I had of the barley about twenty bushel?, and of the rice S3
much more; insomuch that now I resolved to begin to use it
freely, for my bread had been quite gone a great while; also
I resolved to see what quantity would be sufficient for me a
whole year, and to sow but once a year.
Upon the whole, I found that the forty bushels of barley
and rice were much more than I could consume in a year; so
1 resolved to sow just the same quantity every year that I
sowed the last, in hopes that such a quantity would fully pro-
vide me with bread, Sec.
All the while these things were doing, you may be sure
my thoughts ran many times upon the prospect of land,
which I had seen from the olher side of the island; and I was
not without secret wishes that I were on shore there, fancy-
ing that, seemg the main land, and an inhabited country, I
might find some way or other to convey myself farther, and
perhaps at last find some means of escape.
But all this while I made no allowance for the dangers of
such a condition, and how I might fall mto the hands of sava-
ges, and perhaps such as I might have rtason to think far
worse than the lions and tigers of Africa; that if I once came
into their power, 1 should run a hazard more than a thousand
to one of being killed, and perhaps of being eaten; for I had
heard, that the people of the Caribbean coast were cannibals,
or men eaters; and I knew by the latitude, that I could not
Tie far off from that shore; that suppose they were not canni-
bals, yet they might kill me, as many Europeans who had
fallen into their hands had been served, even when they had
been ten or twenty together; much more I that was but one,
and could make little or no defence. All these things, I say,
which 1 ought to have considered well of, and did cast up in
mv thoughts afterwards, yet took up none of my apprehen-
sions at first; and my head ran mightily upon the thought of
getting over to that shore.
Now I wished for my boy Xury, and the long-boat, with
the shoulder-of mutton sail, with which I sailed above a thou-
sand miles on the coast of Africa; but this was in vain. Then
I thought I would go and look at our ship's boat, which, as I
hare said, was blown up upon the shore, a great way. in the
storm, when we were first cast away She lay almost where she
did at first, but not quia-; and was turned, by the force of the
waves and the -winds, almost bottom upwards, against a high
ridge of beaehy rough sand, but no water about her, as before-
If I had had hands to have refitted her, and to have lun-
ched her into the water, the boat would have done well enough,
and I might gave gone back into the Brasils with her easily
enough; but I might have easily foreseen that I could no more
turn her, and set her upright upon her bottom, than I could
remove the island. However, I went to tilie woods, and cut
levers and rollers, and brought them to the boat, resolved to
try what I could do, suggesting to myself, that if I could but
turn her dowu, I might easily repair the damage she had re-
ceived, and she would be a very good boat, and I might go
to sea in her very easily.
I spared no pains indeed in this piece of fruitless toil, and
spent, I think, three or four weeks aoout it; at last, finding
it impossible to heave it up with my little strength, I fell to
digging away the sand to undermine it, and so to make it fall
down, setting pieces of wood to thrust and guide it right in
the fall
But when I had done this, I was unable to stir it up again,
or to get under it, much less to move it forward towards the
water; so I was forced to give it over: and yet, though I gave
over the hopes of the boat, my desire to venture over for the
main increased, rather than decreased, as the means for it
seemed impossible.
This at length set me upon th.nking, whether it was not pos-
sible to make myself a canoe, or periagua, such as the natives
of those climates make, even without tools, or, as I might say,
without hands, viz. of the trunk of a great tree. This I not
only thought possible, but easy; and pleased myself extreme-
ly with the thoughts of making it, and with my having much
more convenience for it than any of the Negroes or Indians,
but not at all considering the particular inconveniences which
I lay under more than the Indians did, viz. want of hands to
move it into the water, when it was made: a difficulty much
harder for me to surmount, than all the consequences of want
of tools could be to them; for what was it to me, that when I
had chosen a vast tree in the woods, I might with great trou-
ble cut it down; if after I might be able with my tools to hew
and dub the outside into the proper shape of a boat, and b^rn
or cut out the inside to make it hollow, so to make a boat cf
it, if, after all this, I must leave it just where I found it, and
was not able to laneh it into the water?
One would have thought, I could not have had the least
reflection upon my mind of my circumstance, while I was
makmg this boat, but I should have immediately thought how
I should get it into the sea; but my thoughts were so intent
upon my voyage over the sea in it, that I never once consi-
dered how I -liould get it off the land; and it was really, in
its own nature, more easy for me to guide it over forty-five
milts of sea than about forty-five fathom of land, where it lay,
to set it afloat in the water.
I went to work upon this boat the most like a fool that ever
man did, who had any of his senses awake I pleased myself
with the design, without determming whether I wis ever able
to undertake it: not hut that the difficulty of lanching my
boat came often into my head; but I put a stop to my own
inquiries into it, by this foolish answer, which I gave myself:
•Let me first make it; I'll warrant I'll find some way or other
to get it along, when it is done.'
This was a most preposterous method; but the eagerness
of my fancy prevailed, and to work I went, and felled a cedar
tree. I question much whether Solomon ever had such a
one for the building the temple atJerusalem: it was five feet
ten inches diameter, at the lower part next the stump, and
four feet eleven inches diameter, at the end of twenty-two
feet; after which, it lessened for a while, and then parted
into branches, It was not without infinite labour that I felled
this tree I was twenty days hacking and hewing at it at the
"bottom: 1 was fourteen more getting the branches and limbs,
and the vast spreading head of it cut off, which 1 hacked and
hewed through with my axe and hatchet, and inexpressible
labour. After this it cost me a month to shape it, and dub
it to a proportion, and to something like the bottom of a boat,
that it might swim upright asit ought to do It cost me near
three months more to clear the inside, and work it out so as
to make an exact boat of it. This I did indeed without fire,
hy mere mallet and chisel, and by the dint of hard labour,
till I had brought it to be a very handsome pcriagua, arid big
enough to have carried six and twenty men, and consequently
big enough to have carried me and all my cargo
VV lien I had gone through this work, I « as extremely de-
lighted with it. The boat was really much bigger than I ever

saw a canoe, or periagua, that was made of one tree, in
my life; many a weary stroke it had cost, you may be sure,
and there remamed nothing but to get it into the water; and
had I gotten it into the water, I make no question, but I
should have begun the maddest voyage, and the most unlikely
to be performed, that ever was undertaken.
But all my devices to get it into the water failed me, though
they cost me infinite labour too: it lay about one hundred
yards from the water, and not more; but the first inconve-
nience was, it was up hill towards the creek. Well, to take
away this discouragement, I resolved to dig into the surface
of the earth, and so make a declivity. This I began, and it
cost me a prodigious deal of pains: but who grudge pains,
that have their deliverance in view? Hut when this was worked
through, and this difficulty managed, it was still much at one;
for I could no more stir the canoe, than 1 could the other boat.
Then I measured the distance of ground, and resolved to
cut a dock, or canal, to bring the water up to the canoe,
seeing I could not bring the canoe down to the water. Well, I
began this work, and when 1 began to enter into it, and cal-
culated how deep it was to be dug, how broad, how the stuff
was to be thrown out, I found that, bv the number of hands I
had, being none but my own, it must have been ten or twelve
years before I should have gone through wilh it; for the shore
lay high, so that at the upper end it must have been at least
twenty feet deep; so at length, though wilh great reluctaucy,
I gave this attempt over also.
This grieved me heartily; and now I saw, though too
late, the foily of beginning a work before we count the cost,
and before we judge rightly of our own strenglh to go through
with it.
In the middle of this work, I finished my fourth year in
this place, and kept my anniversary with the same devotion,
and with as much comfort as ever before; for by a constant
study, and serious application of the word of God; and by the
assistance of his Grace, 1 gained a different knowledge from
what 1 had belore. I entertained different notions of things.
I looked now upon the world as a thmg remote, which i had
nothing to do wilh, no expectation from, and indeed no de-
sires about; in a word, 1 had nothing mdeed to do wilh it, nor
was ever like to have; so 1 thought it looked, as we may per-
haps look upon it hereafter, viz. as a place I had lived in,
K2
tut was come out of it; and well might I say, as father Abra-
ham to Dives, ' Between me and thee is a great gulf fixed.'
In the first place, I was removed from all the wickedness
of the world here. I had neither the ' lust of the flesh, the
lust of the eye, nor the pride of life'.' I had nothing to coveti
for I had all I was now capable of enjoying: I was lord of the
whole manor, on if I pleased, I might call myself king or em-
peror over the whole country which I had possession of.
There were no rivals. I had no competitor, none to dispute
sovereignty or command with me. I mighi have raised ship-
loadings of corn, but I had no use for it; so I let as little grow
as I thought enough for my occasion. I had tortoises or tur-
tles enough; but now and then one was as much as I could
put to anv use. I had timber enough to have built a fleet of
ships. I had grapes enough to have made wine, or to have
cured into raisins, to have loaded that fleet when they had been
built.
But all I could make use of was all that was valuable- I
had enough to eat, and to supply my wants, and what was nil
the rest to me! If I killed more flesh than I could eat, the
dog must eat it, or the vermin; if 1 sowed more corn than I
could eat, it must be spoiled. The trees that I cat down
were lying to rot on the ground; I could make no more use of
them than for fuel; and that I had no occasion for, but to
dress my food.
In a word, the nature and experience of things dictated to
me, upon just reflection, that all the good things of this world
are no farther good to us, than they are for our use; and that
whatever we may heap up indeed to give others, we enjoy as
much as we can use, and no more. The most covetous,
gripuig miser in the world would have been cured of the vice
of covetousness, if he had been in m> case; for I possessed
infinitely more than I knew what to do with. I had no room
for desire, except it was of things which I had not, and they
were but trifles, though indeed of great use to me. I had, as
I hinted before. a parcel of money, as well gold as silver,
above thirty six pounds sterling Alas' there the nasty, sorry,
useless stuff lay: I had no manner of business for it; and I
often thought with myself, that I would have given a handful
of it for a groce of tobacco pipes, or for a hand-mill to giind
my corn; nay, I would have given it all for six-pennyworth of
turnip and carrot seed out of England, or for a handful of
peas and beans, and a bottle of ink. As it was, I had not the
least advantage by it, or benefit from it; but there it lay in a
drawer and grew mouldy with the damp of the cave, in the
wet season: and if I had had the drawer full of diamonds, it
had been the same case: and they had been of no manner of
value to me, because of no use
I had new brought my state of life to be much easier in it-
self than it was at first, and much easier to my mind, as well
as to my body I frequently sat down to my meat with thank-
fulness, and admired the hand of God's providence, which
had thus spread my table in the wilderness. I learned to
look more upon the bright side of my condition, and less upon
the dark side, and to consider what I enjoyed rather than
what 1 wanted; and this gave me sometimes such secret com-
forts, that I cannot express them, and which I take notice of
here to put those discontented people in mind of it, who can-
not enjoy comfortably what God has given them, because
they see and covet something that he has not given them.
All our discontents about what we want, appeared to me to
spring from the want of thankfulness for what we have.
Another reflection was of great use to me, and doubtless
would be so to any one that should fall into such distress as
mine was; and this was to compare my present condition
with what I at first expected it should be; nay, with what it
-would certainly have been, if the good providence of God had
not wonderfully ordered the ship to be cast up nearer to the
shore, where I not only could corneal her, but could bring what
I got out of her to the shore, for my relief and comfort, with-
out which I had wanted tools to work, weapons for defence,
or gunpowder and shot for getting my food.
I spent whole hours, I may say, whole days, in representing
to myself, in the most lively colours, how I must have acted,
if I had got nothing out of the ship; how 1 could not have
so much as got any food, except fish and turtles; and that,
as it was long before I found any of them, I must have pe-
rished first; that 1 should have lived, if I had not perished,
like a mere savage; that if I had killed a goat or a fowl, by
any contrivance, I had no way to flay or open them, or part
the flesh from the skin and the bowels, or to cut it up, but
must gnaw it with my teeth, and pull it with my claws like a
beast-
These reflections made me very sensible of the goodness ot
Providence to me, and very thankful for my present con-
dition, with all its hardships and misfortunes: and (his part
also I cannot but recommend to the reflection of those who
are apt in their misery to say, Ms any affliction like mine?'
Let tliem consider how much worse the cases of some people
are, and their case might have been, if Providence had
thought fit.
I had another reflection which assisted me also to comfort
my mind with hopes; and this was comparing my present
condition with what I had deserved, and had therefore rea-
son to expect from the hand of Providence. I had lived 8
dreadful life, perfectly destitute of the knowledge and fear
cf God. I had been well instructed by father and mother;
neither had they been wanting to me in their early endea-
vours to infuse a religious awe of God into my mind, a sense
of my duty, and of what the nature and end of my being re-
quired of ;ae. Hut, alas! falling early into the sea-faring life,
which, of all lives, is the most destitute of the fear of God,
though his terrors are always before them; I say, falling early
into the sea-faring life, and into sea faring company, all that
little sense of religion which I had entertamed, was laughed
out of me by my messmates; by a hardened despising of dan-
gers, and the views of death, which grew habitual to me; by
my long absence from all manner of opportunities to converse
with any thing but what was like myself, or to hear any thing
that was good, or tended towards it.
So void was 1 of every thing that was good, or of the least
sense of what I was, or was to be, that in the greatest deli-
verances I enjoyed, such as my escape from Sullee, my being
taken up by the Portuguese master of the ship, my being
planted so well in the Mrasils, my receiving the cargo from
Engiaud, and the like, I never once had the words ' Thank
God,' so much as otrmy mind, or in my mouth; nor in the
greatest distress had 1 so much thought as to pray to him;
nor so much as to say, 'Lord, have mercy upon me!' no, nor
to mention the name of God, unless it was to swear by, and
L!n4pheme it.
I had terrible reflections upon my mind for many months,
as I have already observed, on the account of my wicked and
hardened life past; and when I looked about mc, and cousi-
dered what particular providences had attended me since my
coming into this place, and how God had dealt bountifully
with me; had not only punished me less than my iniquity de-
served, but had so plentifully provided forme: this gave me
great hopes, that my repentance was accepted, and that God
had yet mercies in store for me.
With these reflections I worked my mind up, not only to
resignation to the will of God, in the present disposition of my
circumstances, but even to a sincere thankfulness for my con-
dition, and that I, who was yet a living man, ought not to
complain, seeing I had not the due punishment of my sins;
that I enjoyed so many mercies which I had no reason to have
expected in that place, that I ought never more to repine at
my condition, but to rejoice, and to give daily thanks, for that
daily bread, which nothing but a crowd of wonders could have
brought; that I ought to consider I had been fed even by a
miracle, even as great as that of leeding Elijah by ravens, nay,
by a long series of miracles; and that I could hardly have
named a place in the uninhabited part of the world where I
could have been cast more to my advantage: a place where,
as I had no society, which was my affliction on one hand, so
I found no ravenous beasts, no furious waives or tigers,
to threaten my life; no venomous creatures or poisonous,
which I might have fed on to my hurt; no savages to murder
and devour me.
In a word, as my life was a life of sorrow one way, so it
was a life of mercy another: and I wanted nothing to make
it a life of comfort, but to be able to make my sense of God's
goodness to me, and care over me in this condition, my daily
consolation: and after I made a just improvement of these
things, I went away, and was no more sad.
I had now been here so long, that many things which I
brought on shore for my help were either quite gone, or very
much wasted, and near spent.
My ink, as I observed, had been gone for some time, all
but a very little, which I eked out with water a little and a
little, till it was so pale it scarce left any appearance of black
upon the paper. As long as it lasted, I made use of it to
minute down the days of the month on which any remarkable
thing happened to me: and first, by casting up times past, I
remember that there was a strange concurrence of days, in
the various providences w hich befell me, and which if I had
i
been superstitiously inclined to observe days as fatal or fortu-
nate, I might have had reason to have looked upon with a
great deal of curiosity.
First, I had observed that the same day that I broke away
from my father and my friends, and ran away to Hull, in or-
der to go to sea, the same day afterwards I was taken by the
Sallee man of war, and made a slave.
The same day of the year that I escaped out of the wreck
of that ship in Yarmouth roads, that same day of the year af-
terwards I made my escape from Sallee in the boat.
The same day of the year I was born on, viz. the 30th of
September, the same day I had my life so miraculously saved
twenty-six years after, when I was cast on shore on this island:
so that my wicked life, and solitary life, began both on a day.
The next thing to my ink's being wasted, was that of my
bread, I mean the biscuit which I brought out of the ship.
This I had husbanded to the last degree, allowing myself but
one cake of bread a day, for above a year; and yet I was
quite without bread, for near a year, before 1 got any corn of
my own: and great reason I had to be thankful that 1 had any
at all; the getting it being, as has been already observed, next
to miraculous.
My clothes too began to decay mightily. As to linen, I
had none a good while, except some check shirts which I
found in the chests of the other seamen, and which I careful-
ly preserved, because many times I could bear no other
clothes on but a shirt; and it was a very great help to me
that I had among all the men's clothes of the ship almost
three dozen of shirts. There were also several thick watch-
coats of the seamen, which were left indeed, but they were
too hot to wear; and though it is true, that the weather was
so violent hot, that there was no need of clothes, yet I could
not go quite naked, no, though 1 had been inclined to it, which
I was not, nor could 1 abide the thoughts of it, though I was
all alone.
One reason why I could not go quite naked, was, I could
not bear the heat of the sun so well when quite naked, as
with some clothes on; nay, the very heat frequently blistered
my skin; whereas, with a shirt on, the air itself made some
motion, and whistling under that shirt, was twofold cooler
than without it. No more could I ever bring myself to go
out in the heat of the sun without a cap or a hat, the heat
of the sun beating with such violence as it does in that place,
would give me the head-ache presently, by darting so directly
on my head, without a cap or a hat on, so that I coidd not
bear it; whereas, if I put on my hat, it would presently go
away.
Upon these views I began to consider about putting the few
rags I had, which I called clothes, into some order. 1 had
worn out all the waistcoats I had, and my business was now
to try if I could not make jackets out of the great watch-
coats which I had by me, and with such other materials as I
had; so I set to work a tailoring, or rather indeed a botching,
for I made most piteous work of it. However, I made shift
to make two or three new waistcoats, which I hoped would
serve me a great while; as for breeches or drawers, I made
hut very sorry shift indeed, till afterwards
I have mentioned that I saved the skins of all the Crea-
tures that I killed, I mean the four-footed ones; and I had
hung them up stretched out with sticks in the sun, by which
means some of them were so dry and hard, that they were
fit for little, but others were very useful. The first thing I
made of these was a great cap for my head, with the hair on
the outside to shoot off the rain; and this 1 performed so well
that, after this, 1 made me a suit of clothes, wholly of those
skins; that is to say, a waistcoat and breeches, open at knees,
and both loose; for they were rather wanting to keep me cool,
than to keep me warm I must not omit to acknowledge,
that they were wretchedly made; for if I was a bad carpen-
ter, I was a worse tailor. However, they were such as I
made a very good shift with, and when I was abroad, if it hap-
pened to rain, the hair of the waistcoat and cap being out-
most, I was kept very dry.
After this I spent a great deal of time and pains to make
me an umbrella: I was indeed in great want of one, and had a
great mind to make one. 1 had seen them made in the Bra-
sils, where they are very useful in the great heats which arc
there; and I felt the heats every jot as great here, and great-
er too, being nearer the equinox; besides, as I was obliged
to be much abroad, it was a most useful thing to me, as well
for the rains as the heats. I took a world of pains at it, and
was a great while before I could make any thing likely to
hold; nay, after I thought I had hit the way, 1 spoiled two or
three before I made one to my mind: but, at last, I made
one that answered indifferently well. The main difficulty.I
found was to make it to let down. I could make it to spread;
but if it did not let down too, and draw in, it would not be
portable for me any way but just over my head, which would
not do. However, at last, as I said, I made one to answer: I
covered it with skins, the hair upwards, so that it cast off the
ram like a penthouse, and kept off the sun so effectually, that
I could walk out in the hottest of the weather, with greater
advantage than I could before in the coolest; and when I had
no need of it, I could close it, and carry it under my arm.
Thus I lived mighty comfortably, my mind being entirely
composed, by resigning to the will of God, and throwing my-
self wholly upon the disposal of his providence. This made
my life better than sociable; for when I began to regret the
want of conversation, I would ask myself, whether thus con-
versing mutually with my own thoughts, and, as I hope I may
say, with even my Maker, by ejaculations and petitions, was
not better than the utmost enjoyment of human society in
the world?
I cannot say that after this, for five years, any extraordina-
ry thing happened to me; but I lived on in the same course,
in the same posture and place, just as before. The chief
thing I was employed in, besides my yearly labour and plant-
ing my barley and rice, and curing my raisins, of both which
I always kept up just enough to have sufficient stock of one
year's provisions before-hand; I say, besides thisyearly labour,
and my daily labour of going out with my gun, I had one
labour to make me a canoe, which at last I finished. So that
by digging a canal to it six feet wide, and four feet deep, I
brought it into the creek, almost half a mile. As for the first,
that was so vastly big, as I made it without considering before-
hand, as I ought to do, how I should be able to lanch it; so
never being able to bring it to the water, or bring the water
to it, I was obliged to let it lie where it was, as a memoran-
dum to teach me to be wiser the next time. Indeed the next
time, though I could not get a tree proper for it, and was in
a place where I could not get the water to it, at any less dis-
tance than, as 1 have said, of near half a mile, yet as I saw it
was practicable at last, I never gave it over; and though I was
near two y ears about it, yet I never grudged my labour, in
hopes of having a boat to go oft" to sea in at last.
However, though my little periagua was finished, yet the
size of it was not at all answerable to the design which I had
in view, when I made the first; I mean of venturing over to
the terra firma, where it was above forty miles broad: accor-
dingly, the small ncss of my boat assisted to put an end to that
design, and now I thought no more of it. But as I had a boat,
my next design was to make a tour round the island. for as I
had been on the other side, in one place, crossing, as I have
already described it, over the land, so the discoveries I made
in that journey, made me very eager to see other parts of the
coast, and now I had a beat, I thought of nothing but sailing
round the island.
For this purpose, and that I might do every thing with dis-
cretion and consideration, I fitted up a little mast to my boat,
and made a sail to it out of some of the pieces of the ship's
sails, which lay in store, and of which I had a great stock by
me.
Having fitted my mast and sail, and tried the boat, I found
she would sail very well. Then I made little lockers or
boxes at either end of my boat, to put provisions, necessaries,
and ammunition, &o. into, to be kept dry, either from rain,
or the spray of the sea, and a little long hollow place I cut in
the inside of the boat, where I could lay my gun, making a
flap to hang down over it to keep it dry
1 fixed my umbrella also in a step at the stern, like a mast,
to stand over my head, and keep the heat of the sun off me,
like an awning; and thus I every now and then took a little
voyage upon the sea, but never went far out, nor far from the
little creek; but at last, being eager to view the circumference
of my little kingdom, I resolved upon my tour, and accord-
ingly I victualled my ship for the voyage, putting in two
dozen of my loaves (cakes I should rather call themj of bar-
ley bread, an earthen pot full of parched rice, a food I eat
a great deal of, a little bottle of rum, half a goat, and powder
and shot for killing more, and two large watch coats, of those
which, as I mentioned before, I had saved out of the seamen's
chests; these I took, one to lie upon, and the other to cover
me in the night.
Ii was the 6th of November, in the sixth year of my reign,
or my captivity, which you please, that I set out on this
voyage, and I found it much longer than I expected; for
though the island itself was not very large, yet when I came
L
to the east side of it, I found a great ledge of rocks lie out
above two leagues into the sea, some above water, some un-
der it; and beyond that a shoal of sand, lying dry, half a
league more, so that 1 was obliged to go a great way out to
sea to double that point.
When I first discovered them, I was going to give over my
enterprise, and come back, not knowing how far it might
oblige me to go out to sea, and, above all, doubting how I
should get back again; so I came to anchor, for I had made
me a kind of an anchor, with a piece of a broken grappling
which I got out of the ship.
Having secured my boat, I took my gun, and went on
shore, climbing upon a hill, which seemed to overlook that
point, where I saw the full extent of it, and resolved to ven-
ture.
In my viewing the sea from that hill where I stood, I per-
ceived a strong, and, indeed, a most furious current, which
ran to the east, and even came close to the point; and I took
the more notice of it, because 1 saw there might be some dan-
ger, that when I came into it, I might be carried out to sea by
the strength of it, and not be able to make the island again.
And indeed, had I not gotten first up upon this hill, I believe
It would have been so; for there was the same current on the
other side of the island, only that it set off" at a farther dis-
tance, and I saw there was a strong eddy under the shore; so
I had nothing to do but to get in out of the first current, and
I should presently be in an eddy.
I lay here, however, two days; because the wind, blowing
pretty fresh (at E S. E. and that being just contrary to the
said current), made a great breach of the sea upon the point;
so that it was not safe for me to keep too close to the shore
for the breach, nor to go too far off because of the stream.
The third day in the morning, the wind having abated
over night, the sea was calm, and I ventured; but I am a
warning-piece again to all rash and ignorant pilots; for no
sooner was I come to the point, when even 1 was not my
boat's length from the shore, but I found myself in a great
depth of water, and a current like the sluice of a mill. It
carried my boat along with it with such violence, that all I
could do, could not keep her so much as on the edge of it;
but I found it hurried me farther and farther out from the
eddy, which was on the left hand. There was no wind stir-
ring to help me, and all that I could do with my paddles sig-
nified nothing: and now I began to give mi self over for lost;
for, as the current was on both sides the island, 1 knew in a
few leagues distance they must join again, and then I was irre-
coverably gone, nor did I see any possibility of avoiding it; so
that I had no prospect before me but of perishing, not by the
sea, for that was calm enough, but of starving for hunger. I
had indeed found a tortoise on the shore, as big almost as I
could lift, and had tossed it into the boat; and I had a great
jar of fresh water, that is to say, one of my earthen pots: but
what was all this to being driven into the vast ocean, where,
to be sure, there was no shore, no main land or island, for a
thousand leagues at least?
And now I saw how easy it was for the providence of God
to make the most miserable condition that mankind could be
in, worse. Now 1 looked back upon my desolate solitary
island, as the most pleasant place in the world; and all the
happiness my heart could wish for, was to be but there again.
I stretched out my hands to it with eager wishes. * O happy
desert,' said I, ' I shall never see thee more! O miserable
creature,' said I, ' whither am I going?' Then I reproach-
ed myself with my unthankful temper, and how I had repin-
ed at my solitary condition, and now what would I give to be
on shore there again' Thus we never see the true state of
our condition, till it is illustrated to us by its contraries;
nor know how to value what we enjoy, but by the want of it.
It is scarce possible to imagine the consternation I was now
in, being driven from my beloved island (for so it appeared
to me now to be) into the wide ocean, almost two leagues,
and in the utmost despair of ever recovering it agam. Howe-
ver, I worked hard, till indeed my strength was almost ex-
hausted, and kept my boat as much to the northward, that is,
towards the side of the current which the eddy lay on, as
possibly I could. When about noon, as the sun passed the
meridian, I thought I felt a little breeze of wind in my face,
springing up from the S. S. E. This cheered my heart a little,
and especially when in about half an hour more it blew a
pretty small gentle gale. By this time I was gotten a fright-
ful distance from the island, and had the least cloud or hazy
weather intervened, I had been undone another way too; for
1 had do compass on board, and should never have known
how to have steered towards the island, if 1 had but once lost
sight of it: bat the weather continuing clear, I applied my-
self to get up my mast again, and spread my sail, standing
away to the north, as much as possible, to get oat of the cur-
rent
Just as I had set my mast and sail, and the boat began to
stretch avay. I saw, even by the clearness of the water, some
alteration of the current was near; for where the currant was
so strong, the water was foul; but perceiving the water clear,
I found the current abate, and presently I found to the east,
at about half a mile, a breach of the sea upon some rocks;
these rocks 1 found caused the current to part again, and as
the main stress of it ran away more southerly, leaving the
rocks to the north east, so the other returned by the repulse
of this rock, and made a strong eddy, which ran back again.
to the north-west, with a very sharp stream.
They who know what it is to have a reprieve brought to
them upon the ladder, or to be rescued from thieves just
going to murder them, or who have been in such-like extre-
mities, may guess what my present surprise of joy was, and
how gladly I put my boat into the stream of this eddy; and,
the wind also freshening, how gladly I spread my sail to it,
running cheerfully before the wind, and with a strong tide or
eddy under foot
This eddy carried be about a league in my way back again,
directly towards the island, but about two leagues more to-
wards the northward than the current lay, which carried me
away at first; so that when I came near the island, I found
myself open to the northern shore of it, that is to say, the
other end of the island, opposite to that which I went out
from.
When I had made something more than a league of way,
by the help of this current or eddy. I found it was spent, and
served me no farther However, I found that being between
the two gi cat currents, viz that on the south side, which had
hurried me away, and that on the north, which lay about tyvo
leagues on the other side; I say, between these two, in the
west of the island, I found the water at least still, and running
no way; and having still a breeze of wind fair for me, I kept
on steering directly for the island, though not making such
fresh way as I did before
About four o'clock in the evening, being then within about
a league of the island, I found the point of the rocks which
occasioned this disaster stretching out, as is described before,
to the southward, and casting off the current more south-
wardly, had, of course, made another eddy to the north, and
this I found very strong, but not directly setting the way my
course lay, which was due west, but almost full north. How-
ever, having a fresh gale, I stretched across this eddy, slant-
ing north-west, and in about an hour came within a mile of
the shore, where, it being smooth water, I soon got to land.
When I was on shore I fell on my knees, and gave God
thanks for my escape, resolving to lay aside all thoughts of
my deliverance by my boat; and refreshing myself with such
things as I had, I brought my boat close to the shore, m a.
little cove that I had espied under some trees, and laid me
down to slet,), being quite spent with the labour and fatigue of
the voyage.
I was now at a great loss which way to get home with my
boat. I had run so much hazard, and knew too much the
case, to think of attempting it by the way I went out; and
what might be at the other side (X mean the west side), I
knew not, nor had I any mind to run any more ventures: so
I only resolved in the morning to make my way westward
along the shore, and to see if there was no creek, where I
might lay up my frigate in safety, so as to have her again, if I
wanted her. In about three miles, or thereabouts, coasting
the shore, I came to a very good inlet, or bay, about a mile
over, which narrowed till it came to a very little rivulet or
brook, where I found a convenient harbour for my boat, and
where she lay as if she had been in a little dock made on
purpose for her: here I put in, and having stowed my boat
very safe, I went on shore to look about me, and see where
1 was.
I soon found I had but a little passed by the place where I
had been before, when I travelled on foot to that shore: so
taking nothing out of my boat, but my gun and my umbrella,
for it was exceeding hot, I began my march. The way was
comfortable enough after such a voyage as I had been upon,
and I reached my old bower in the evening, where I found
every thing standing as I left it; for I always kept it in good
order, bemg, as I said before, my country bouse.
I got over the fence, and laid me down in the shade to rest
my limbs; for 1 was very weary, and fell asleep. But judge
you, if you can, that read my story, what surprise I must be
La
in, when t was awaked out of my sleep, by a voice calling tne
by my name several times, 'Robin, Robin, Robin Crusoe!
poor Robin Crusoe! Where are you, Robin Crusoe? Where
are you? Where have you been?*
I was so dead asleep at firs., being fatigued with rowing, or
paddling as it is called. the first part of the day, and with
walking the latter part, that I did not awake thoroughly, and
dozing, between sleeping and waking, thought I dreamed
that somebody spoke to me. But as the voice continued to
repeat ' Robin Crusoe! Robin Crusoe!' at last I began to
awake more perfectly, and was at first dreadfully frighted,
and started up in the utmost consternation. But no sooner
were my eyes open, but I saw my Poll sitting on the top of
the hedge, and immediately knew that it was he that spoke to
me; for just m such bemoaning language I had used to talk to
him, and teach him; and he had learned it so perfectly, that
he would sit upon my finger, and lay his bill close to my face,
and cry, ' Poor Robin Crusoe! Where are you? Where
have you been? How came you here?' and such things as I
had taught him.
However, even though I knew it was the parrot, and that
indeed it could be nobody else, it was a good while before I
could compose myself First, I was amazed how the crea-
ture got thither, and then how he should just keep about
the place, and no where el«e. But as I was well satisfied it
could be nobody but honest Poll, I got over it; and holding
out my hand, and calling him by his name, ' Poll,' the socia-
ble creature came to me, and sat upon my thumb, as he used
to do, and continued talking to me, ' Poor Robin Crusoe!'
and how did I come here, and where had I been, just as if he
had been overjoyed to see me again; and so I carried him
home along with me.
I had now had enough of rambling to sea for some time,
and had enough to dolor many days to sit still, and reflect
upon the danger I had been in. 1 would have been very glad
to have had my boat again on my side of the island; but I
knew not how it was practicable to get it about. As to the
east side of the island, which 1 had gone round, I knew well
enough there was no venturing that way: my very heart
would shrink, and my very blood run chill, but to think of it.
And as to the other side of the island, I did not know how it
might be there; but supposing the current ran with the same
Against the shore at the east, as it passed by it on the other, I
might run the same risk of being driven down the stream, and
carried by the island, as 1 had been before of being carried
away from it; so with these thoughts I contented myself to
be without any boat, though it had been the product of so
many months' labour to make it, and of so many more to get
it into the sea.
^ In this government of my temper I remained near a year,
lived a very sedate, retired life, as you may well suppose: and
my thoughts being vi^vy much composed as to my condition,
and fully comforted in resigning myself to the dispositions of
Providence, I thought I lived really very happily in all things,
except that of society.
I improved myself in this time in all the mechanic exerci-
ses which my necessities put me upon applying myself to; and,
I believe, could, upon occasion, have made a very good car-
penter, especially considering how few tools I had.
Besides this, I arrived at an unexpected perfection in my
earthen ware, and contrived well enough to make them with
a wheel, which I found infmitely easier a id better; because I
made things round and shapeable, which before were filthy
^fengsindeed to look on. But I think I never was more vain
of my own performance, or more. joyful for any thing I found
out, than for my being able to make n tobacco-pipe; and though
it was a very ugly, clumsy thing, when it was done, and only
burnt red like other earthen ware, yet, as it was hard and
firm, and would draw the smoke, I was exceedingly comfort-
able with it; for I had been always used to smoke, and there
were pipes in the ship, but I forgot them at first, not knowing
that there was tobacco in the island; and afterwards, when I
searched the ship again, I could not come at any pipes at all.
In my wicker-ware I also improved much, and made abun-
dance of necessary baskets as well as my invention showed
me, though not very handsome, yet they were such as were
very handy and convenient for my laying things up in, or
fetching things home in. For example, If I killed a goat
abroad, I could hang it up in a tree, flay it, and dress it, and
cut it in pieces, and bring it home in a basket; and the like by
a turtle, I could cut it up, take out the eggs, and a piece or two
of the flesh, which was enough for me, and bring them home
in a basket, and leave the rest behind me. Also large deep
baskets were my receivers for my corn, which I always rub-
bed out as soon as it was dry and cured; and kept in great
baskets, instead of a granary.
1 began now to perceive my powder abated considerably,
and this was a want which it was impossible for me to supply,
and I began seriously to consider what I must do when I should
have no more powder; that is to say, how I should do to kill
any goats. I had, as I observed in the third year of my being
here, kept a young kid, and bred her up tame. 1 was in
hopes of getting a he-kid; but I could not, by any means,
bring it to pass, till my kid grew an old goat, and I could ne-
ver find in my heart to kill her, till she died at last of mere
age
But, being now in the eleventh year of my residence, and
as I have said my ammunition growing low, 1 set myself to
study some art to trap and snare the goats, to see whether I
could not catch some of them alive; and particularly I wan-
ted a she-goat great with young.
To this purpose I made snares to hamper them, and I do
believe they were more than once taken in them; hut my
tackle was not good, for I had no wire, and I always found
them broken, and my bait devoured.
At length I resolved to try a pit-fall; so I dug several large
pits in the earth, in places where I had observed the goats
used to feed, and over these pits I placed hurdles of my own
making too, with a great weight upon them; and several times
I put ears of barley and dry rice, without setting the trap,
and I could easily perceive that the goats had gone in, ami
eaten up the corn; for I could see the mark of their feet At
length, I set three traps in one night, and, going the next
morning, I found them all standing, and yet the bait eaten
and gone. This was very discouraging: however, I altered
my traps; and, not to trouble you with particulars, going one
morning to sec my traps, I found in one of them a large old
he goat, and, in one of the others, three kids; a male and two
females.
As to the old one, I knew not what to do with him: he was
so fierce 1 durst not go into the pit to him; that is to say, to
go about to bring htm away alive, which was what I wanted.
1 could have killed him, but that was not my business, nor
would it answer my end; so I even let him out, and he ran
away as if he had been flighted out of his wits; but I had for-
got then what I learned afterwards, that hunger will tame a
lion. If I had let him stay there three or four days without
food, and then have carried him some water to drink, and then
a little corn, he would have been as tame as one of the kids;
for they are mighty sagacious, tractable creatures, when they
are well used.
However, for the present I let him go, knowing no better
at that timet then I went to the three kids, and, taking them
one by one, I tied them with strings together, and with some
difficulty brought them all home.
It was a good while before they would feed; but throwing
them some sweet corn, it tempted them, and they began to
be tame. And now I found, that if I expected to supply
myself with goat-flesh, when I had no powder or shot left,
breeding some up tame was my only way, when perhaps I
might have them about my house like a flock of sheep.
But then it presently occurred to me, that I must keep the
tame from the wild, or else they would always run wild when
they grew up; and the only way for this was to have some
enclosed piece of ground, well fenced either with hedge or
pale, to keep them up so effectually, that those within might
not break out, or those without break in.
This was a great undertaking for one pair of hands; yet, as
I saw there was an absolute necessity of doing it, my first
piece of work was to find out a proper piece of ground, viz.
where there was likely to be herbage for them to eat, water
for them to drink, and cover to keep them from the sun.
Those who understand such enclosures will think I had very
little contrivance, when I pitched upon a place very proper
for all these, being a plain open piece of meadow land, or
savanna (as our people call it in the western colonies), which
had two or three little drills of fresh water in it, and at one
end was very woody; I say, they will smile at my forecast,
when I shall tell them 1 began my enclosing of this piece of
ground in such a manner, that my hedge or pale must have
been at least two miles about: nor was the madness of it so
great as to the compass; for if it was ten miles about, I was
like to have time enough to do it in; but 1 did not consider
that my goats would be as wild in so much compass, as if they
had had the whole island, and I should have so much room
to chase them in, that I should never catch them.
My hedge was begun and carried on, I believe about fifty
yards, when this thought occurred to me; so I presently stop-
peil short, and, for the first beginning, I resolved to enclose
a piece of about one hundred and fifty yards in length, and
one hundred yards in breadth, which as it would maintain as
many as I should have in any reasonable time, so, as my flock
increased, I could add more ground to my enclosure.
This was acting with some prudence, and I went to work
with courage. I was about three months hedging in the first
piece, and, till I had done it, I tethered the three kids in the
best part of it, and used them to feed as near me as possible,
to make them familiar, and very often 1 would go and carry
them some ears of barley, or a handful of rice, and feed them
out of my hand, so that, after my enclosure was finished and
I let them loose, they would follow me up and down, bleating
after me for a handful of corn.
This answered my end, and in about a year and a half I
had a flock of about twelve goats, kids and all; and in two
years more I had three-and-forty, besides several that I took
and killed for my food; and after that I enclosed five several
pieces of ground to feed them in, with little pens to drive them
into, to take them as I wanted them; and gates out of one
piece of ground into another.
Hut this was not all; for now I not only had goat's flesh to
feed on when 1 pleased, but milk too; a thing which indeed
in the beginning I did not so much as think of, and which,
when it came into my thoughts, was really an agreeable sur-
prise: for now I set up my dairy, and had sometimes a gallon
or two of milk m a day. And as nature, who gives supplies of
food to every creature, dictates even naturally how to make
use of it; so I, that never milked a cow, much less a goat, or
saw butter or cheese made, very readily and handily, though
after a great many essays and miscarriages, made me both
butter and cheese at last, and never wanted it afterwards.
How mercifully can our great Creator treat his creatures,
even in those conditions in which they seem to be over-
whelmed in destruction! How can he sweeten the bitterest
providences, and give us cause to praise him for dungeons and
prisons! What a table was here spread for me in a wilderness,
where I saw nothing at first but to perish for hunger.
It would have made a Stoic smile to have seen me and my
little family sit down to dinner. There was my majesty, the
prince and lord of the whole island. I had the lives of all my
subjects at my absolute command: I could hang, draw, give
liberty, anil take it away, and no rebels among all my sub-
jects.
Then to see how like a king I dined too, all alone, attended
by my servants! Poll, as if he had been my favourite, was the
only person permitted to talk to me: my dog, who was now
grown very old aud crazy, and had found no species to mul-
tiply his kind upon, sat always at my right hand; and two cats,
one on one side the table, and one on the other, expecting
now and then a bit from my hand, as a mark of special
favour.
But these were not the two cats which I brought on shore at
first; for thev were both of them dead, and had been interred
near my habitation by my own hands; but one of them having
multiplied by I know not what kind of creature, these were
two which I had preserved tame, whereas the rest ran wild in
the woods, and became indeed troublesome to me at last; for
they would often come into my house, and plunder me too,
till at last I was obliged to shoot them, and kill a great many;
at length they left me with this attendance. And in this plen-
tiful manner 1 lived; neither could I be said to want any thing
but society and of that, in some time alter this, 1 was like
to have too much.
I was something impatient, as I before observed, to have
the use of my boat, though very loath to run any more ha-
zards; and therefore sometimes I sat contriving ways to get
her about the island, and at other times I sat myself down
contented enough without her But I had a strange uneasiness
in my mind to go down to the point of the island, where, as
I have said, in my last ramble, I went up the hill to see how
the shore lay, and how the current set, that 1 might see what
I had to do. This inclination increased upon me every day,
and at length I resolved to travel th'ther by land; and follow-
ing the edge of the shore, I did so; but had any one in England
been to meet such a man as I was, it must have either frighted
him, or raised a great deal of laughier; and as I frequently
stood still to look at myself, I could not but smile at the notion
of my travelling through Yorkshire with such an equipage,
and in such a dress. Be pleased to take a sketch of my
figure as follows:
I had a great, high, shapeless cap, made of a goat's skin,
with a flap hanging down behind, as well to keep the sun from
me, as to ilioot the rain off from'running into my neck; nothing
being so hurtful in these climates, as the rain upon the flesh
under the clothes.
I had a short jacket of goat's skin, the sktrts coming down
to about the middle of my thighs; and a pair of open-knee'd
breeches of the same: the breeches were made of the skin of
of an old he goat, whose hair hung down such a length on ei-
ther side, that, like pantaloons, it reached to the middle of
my legs. Stockings and shoes 1 had none; hut I had made a
pair of something, I scarce know what to call them, like bus-
kins, to flap over my legs, and lace on either side like spatter-
dashes, but of a most barbarous shape, as indeed were all the
rest of my clothes.
I had on a broad belt of goat's skin dried, which I drew to-
-gether with two thongs of the same, instead of buckles; and,
in a kind of a frog, on either side of this, instead of a sword
and a dagger, hung a little saw and a hatchet, one on one side,
one on the other. I had another belt not so broad, and fast-
ened in the same manner, which hung over my shoulder; and
at the end of it, under my left arm, hung two pouches, both
made of goat's skin too: in one of which hung my powder,
in the other my shot. At my back I carried my basket, ou
my shoulder my gun, and over my head a great, clumsy, ugly,
goat-skin umbrella, but which, after all, was the most neces-
sary thing I had about me, next to my gun, As for my face,
the colour of it was really not so Mulatto like as one might
expect from a man not at all careful of It, and living within
nine or ten degrees of the eqainox. My beard I had once
suffered to grow till it was about a quarter of a yard long; but
as I hart both scissars and razors sufficient, I hail cut it pretty
Aort, except what grew on my upper lip, which I had trim-
med into a large pair of Mahometan whiskers, such as I had
seen worn by some Turks, whom I saw at Sallee; for the
Moors did not wear such, though the Turks did. Of these
mustachioes, or whiskers, I will not say they were long enough
to hang my hat upon them; but they were of a length and
shape monstrous enough, and such as in England would have
passed for frightful.
But all this is by the bye: for as to my figure, I had so few
to observe me, that it was of no manner of consequence; so 1
say no more to that part. In this kind of figure I went my
new journey, and was out five or six days. I travelled first
along the sea-shore, directly to the place where I first brought
r
tSA&Ars/n/ t?fa, <_^?W^ i?i> /ike <*ant/-.
my boat to anchor, to get up upon the rocks; and, having no
boat now to take care of, 1 went over the-land a nearer way,
to the same height that I was upon before, when looking for-
ward to the point of the rocks which lay out, and which I was
to double with my boat, as I said above, I was surprised to
see the sea all smooth and quiet: no rippling, no motion, no
current, any more there than in other places.
I was at a strange loss to understand this, and resolved to
spend some time in observing it, to see if nothing from the
sets of the tide had occasioned it. But I was presently con-
vinced how it was, viz. that the tide of ebb setting from the
west, and joining with the current of waters from some great
river on the shore, must be the occasion of this current; and
that, according as the wind blew more forcibly from the west,
or from the north, this current came near, or went farther
from the shore; for, waiting thereabouts till evening, I went
up to the rock again, and then the tide of ebb being made, I
plainly saw the current again as before, only that it ran far-
ther off, being near half a league from the shore; whereas, in
my case, it set close upon the shore, and hurried me in my
canoe along with it, which at another time it would not have
done.
This observation convinced me, that I had nothing to do
but to observe the ebbing anil flowing of the tide, and I might
very easily bring my boat about the island again: but when I
began to think of putting it in practice, I had such a terror
upon my spirits at the remembrance of the danger I had been
in, that I could not think of it again with any patience; but,
on the contrary, I took up another resolution, which was more
safe, though more laborious, and this was, that 1 would build,
or rather make me another periagua, or canoe, and so have
one for one side of the island, and one for the other.
You are to understand that now I had, as I may call it, two
plantations in the island; one, my little fortification or tent,
with the wall about it under the rock, with the cave behind
me, which, by this time I had enlarged into several apartments
or caves, one within another. One of these, which was (Jie
driest and largest, and had a door out beyond my wall or lfir-
tification, that is to say, beyond where my wall joined to the
rock. was all filled up with large earthen pots, of which I have
given an account, and with fouiteen or fifteen great baskets,
which would hold five or six bushels each, where I laid up my
M
stores of prevision, especially my corn, some in the ear cut
off short from the straw, and the other rubbed out with my
hand.
A» for my wall made, as before, with long stakes or piles,
those piles grew all like trees, and were by this time grown
so big, and spread so very much, that there was not the least
appearance, to any one's view, of any habitation behind them.
Near this dwelling of mine, but a little farther within the
land, and upon lower ground, lay my two pieces of corn-
ground, which I kept duly cultivated and sowed, and which
duly yielded me their harvest in its season; and whenever I
had occasion for more corn, I had more land adjoining as fit
as that.
Besides this, I had my country seat, and I had now a tole .
rable plantation there also. For, first, I had my little bower,
as I called it, which I kept in repair; that is to say, I kept
the hedge which circled it in, constantly fitted up to its usual
height, the ladder standing always in the inside I kept the
trees, whioh at first were no more than my stakes, but were
now grown very firm and tall I kept them always so cut, that
they might spread and grow thick and wild, and make the
more agreeable shade. which they did effectually to my mind.
In the middle of this, I had my tent always standing, being a
piece of a sail spread over poles set up for that purpose, and
which never wanted any repair or renewing; and under this I
had made mc a squab or couch, with the skins of the creatures
I had killed, and with other soft things, and a blanket laid on
them, such as belonged to our sea-bedding, which I had saved,
and a great watch-coat to cover me: and here, whenever I
had occasion to be absent from my chief seat, I took up my
country habitation-
Adjoining to this, I had my enclosures for my cattle, that
is to say, my goats: and as I had taken an inconceivable deal
of pains to fence and enclose this ground, I was so uneasy to
see it kept entire lest the goats should break through, that I
nev«r left off, till, with infinite labour, I had stuck the outside
of the hedge so full of small stakes, and so near to one ano-
ther, that it was rather a pale than a hedge, and there was
scarce room to put a hand through between them: which
afterwards, when those stakes grew, as they all did in the
next rainy season, made the enclosure strong, like a wall,
indeed stronger than any wall.
This will testify for me that I was not idle, and that I
spared no pains to bring to pass whatever appeared necessary
for my comfortable support' for I considered the keeping up
a breed of tame creatures thus at my hand, would be a living
magazine of flesh, milk, butter, and cheese, for me as long as
I lived in the place, if it were to be forty years; and that
keeping them within my reach depended entirely upon my
perfecting my enclosures to such a degree, that I might be
sure of keeping them together; which by this method indeed
I so effectually secured, that when these little stakes began
to grow, I had planted them so very thick, I was forced to
pull some of them up again.
In this place also I had my grapes growing, which I prin-
cipally depended on for my winter-store of raisins, and which
I never failed to preserve very carefully, as the best and most
agreeable dainty of my whole diet; and indeed they were not
agreeable only, but physical, wholesome, nourishing, and
refreshing to the last degree-
As this was also about half way between my other habitation
and the place where I had laid up my boat, I generally staid
and lay here in my way thither; for I used frequently to visit
my boat, and I kept all things about or belonging to her ia
very good order. Sometimes I went out in her to divert my-
self; but no more hazardous voyages would I go, nor scarce
ever above a stone's cast or two from the shore; I was so
apprehensive of being hurried out of my knowledge again by
the currents, or winds, or any other accident- But now I
come to a new scene of my life.
/ft happened one day about noon, going towards my boat,
I was exceedingly surprised with the print of a man's naked
foot on the shore, which was very plain to be seen in the sand.
I stood like one thunderstruck, or as if I had seen an appari-
tion. I listened, I looked round me; I could hear nothing,
nor see any thing. I went up to a rising ground to look far-
ther. I went up the shore, and down the shore, but it was
all one; I could see no other impression but that one I went
to it again to see if there were any more, and to observe if it
might not be my fancy; but there was no room for that, for
there was exactly the very print of a foot, toes, heel and every
part of a foot: how it came thither, 1 knew not, nor could in
the least imagine. But after innumerable fluttering thoughts,
like a man perfectly confused and out of myself, I came home.
to my fortification, not feeling, as we say, the ground I went
on, but terrified to the last ('egree, looking behind me at every
two or three steps, mistaking every bush and tree, and fan-
cying every stump at a distance to be a man. Nor is it pos-
sible to describe how many various shapes an affrighted ima-
gination represented things to me in; how many wild ideas
were formed every moment in my fancy, aud what strange
Unaccountable whimsies came into my thoughts by the way.
When I came to my castle, for so I think I called it ever
after this, I fled into it like one pursued: whether I went over
by the ladder, as first contrived, or went in at the hole in the
rock, which I called a door, 1 cannot remember; for never
frighted hare fled to cover, or fox to earth, with more terror
of mind than I to this retreat.
I had no sleep that night. The farther I was from the
occasion of my fright, the greater my apprehensions were;
which is something contrary to the nature of such things, and
especially to the usual practice of all creatures in fear. But
I was so embarrassed with my own frightful ideas of the thing,
that I formed nothing but dismal imaginations to myself, even.
though I was now a great way off it. Sometimes I fancied it
must be the devil; and reason joined in with me upon this
supposition: for how should any other thing, in human shape,
come into the place? Where was the vessel that brought
them? What marks were there of any other footsteps? And
how was it possible a man should come there? But then to
think that Satan should take human shape upon him in such a
place, where there could be uo manner of occasion for it, but
to leave the print of his foot behind him, and that even fo" no
purpose too (for he could not be sure I should see it), this
was an amazement the other way. I considered that the devil
might have found out abundance of other ways to have terri-
fied me, than this of the single print of a foot: that as I lived
quite on the other side of the island, he would never have
been so simple to leave a mark in a place where it was ten
thousand to one whether I should ever sec it or not, and in the
sand too, which the first surge of the sea, upon a high wind,
would have defaced entirely. All this seemed inconsistent
with the thing itself, and with all notions we usually entertain
of the subtilty of the devil.
Abundance of such things as these assisted to argue me out
of all apprehensions of its being the devil: and I presently
concluded then, that it must be some more dangerous crea-
ture; viz. that it must be some of the savages of the main
land over against me, who had wandered out to sea in their
canoes, and, either driven by the currents, or by contrary
winds, had made the island; anil had been on shore, but were
gone away again to sea, being as loath, perhaps, to have staid
in this desolate island, as I would have been to have had
them.
While these reflections were rolling upon my mind, I wa*
very thankful in my thoughts, that I was so happy as not to
be thereabouts at that time, or that they did not see my boat,
by which they would have concluded, that some inhabitants
had been in the place, and perhaps have searched farther for
me. Then terrible thoughts racked my imagination about
their having found my boat, and that there were people here;
and that, if so, I should certainly have them come again in
greater numbers, and devour me; that if it should happen so
that they should not find me, yet they would find my enclo-
sure, destroy all my corn, carry away all my flock of tame
goats, and I should perish at last for mere want.
Thus my fear banished all my religious hope; all that for-
mer confidence in God, which was founded upon such won-
derful experience as I had had of his goodness, now vanished;
as if he that had fed me by miracle hitherto, could not pre-
serve by hit1 power the provision which he had made for me
by his goodness. I reproached myself with my easiness, that
would not sow any more corn one year than would just serve
me till the next season, as if no accident could intervene to
prevent my enjoying the crop that was upon the ground; and
this I thought so just a reproof, that I resolved for the future
to have two or three years' corn beforehand; so that whatever
might come, I might not perish for want of bread.
How strange a checker-work of Providence is the life of
man! and by what secret different springs are the affections
hurried about, as differing circumstances present! To day we
love what to-morrow we hate: to day we seek what to-morrow
-we shun: to day we desire what to morrow we fear; nay, even
tremMe at the apprehensions of. This was exemplified in me,
at this time, in the most lively manner imaginable; for I,
whose only affliction was, that I seemed banished from human
society, that I was all alone, circumscribed by the boundlert
ocean, cut off from mankind, and condemned to what I call
M2 ,
silent life; that I was as one whom Heaven thought not worthy
to be numbered among the living, or to appear among the rest
of his creatures; that to have seen one of my own species,
would have seemed to me a raising me from death to life, and
the greatest blessing that Heaven itself, next to the supreme
blessing of salvation could bestow; I say, that I should now
tremble at the very apprehensions of seeing a man, and was
ready to sink into the ground at but the shadow, or silent
appearance of a man's having set his foot on the island.
Such is the uneven state of human life; and it afforded me
a great many curious speculations afterwards, when I had a
little recovered my first surprise. I considered that this was
the station of life, the infinitely wise and good providence of
God had determined for me; that as I could not foresee what
the ends of divine wisdom might be in all this, so I was
not to dispute his sovereignty, who, as I was his creature, had
an undoubted right, by creation, to govern and dispose of me
absolutely as he thought fit; and who, as I was a creature who
had offended him, had likewise a judicial right to condemn
me to what punishment he thought fit; and that it was my part
to submit to bear his indignation, because I had sinned against
him. ^
I then reflected that God, who was not only righteous, but
omnipotent, as he bad thought fit thus to punish and afflict
me, so he was able to deliver me; that if he did not think fit
to do it, it was my unquestioned duty to resign myself abso-
lutely and entirely to his will: and, on the other hand, it was
my duty aUo to hope in him, pray to him, and quietly to attend
the dictates and directions of his daily providence.
These thoughts took me up many hours, days, nay, I may-
say, weeks and months: and one particular effect of my cogi-
tations on this occasion, I cannot omit; viz. one morning early,
lying in my bed, and filled with thoughts about my danger
from the appearance of savages, 1 found it decomposed me
very much; upon which those words of the Scripture came
into my thoughts; ' Call upon me in the day of trouble, and
I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me.'
Upon this, rising cheerfully out of my bed, my heart was
not only comforted, but I was guided and encouraged to pray
earnestly to God for deliverance. When 1 had done praying,
I took up my Bible, and opening it to read, the first words
that presented to me were • Wait on the Lord, and be of good
cheer, and he shall strengthen thy heart; wait, I say, on the
Lord.' It is impossible to express the comfort this gave me:
and in return 1 thankfully laid down the book, and *as no
more sad, at least not on that occasion.
In the middle of these cogitations, apprehensions, and
reflections, it came into my thoughts one day, that all this
might be a mere chimera of my own, and that this foot might
be the print of my own foot, when 1 came on shore from my
boat. This cheered me up a little too, and I began to persuade
myself it was all a delusion; that it was nothing else but my
own foot; and why might not I come that way from the boat,
as well as I was going that way to the boat? Again, I consi-
dered also, that I could by no means tell for certain where I
had trod, and where I had not; and that if at last this was
only the print of my own foot, I had played the part of those
fools, who strive to make stories of spectres and apparitions,
and then are themselves frighted at them more than any body
else.
Now 1 began to take courage, and to peep abroad again;
for I had not stirred out of my castle for three days and nights,
so that I began to starve for provision, for I had little or nothing
within doors, but some barley cakes and water. Then I knew
that my goats wanted to be milked too, which usually was my
evening diversion, and the poor creatures were in great pain
and inconvenience for want of it, and indeed it almost spoiled
some of them, and almost dried up their milk.
Heartening myself therefore with the belief, that this was
nothing but the print of one of my own feet (and so I might
be truly said to start at my own shadow), I began to go abroad
again, and went to my country house to milk my Sock; but to
see with what fear I went forward, how often I looked behind
me, how I was ready, every now and then, to lay down my
basket. and run for my life, it would have made any one have
thought I was haunted with an evil conscience, or that I had
been lately most terribly frighted- and so indeed I had.
However, as I went on thus two or three days, and had
seen nothing, I began to be a little bolder, and to think there
was ready nothing in it but my own imagination; but I could
not persuade myself fully of this, till I should go down to the
shore again, and see this print of a foot, and measure it by my
own, and see if there was any similitude or fitness, that I might
be assured it was my own foot. But when I came to the place
first, it appeared evidently to me, that when I laid up my
boat, I could not possibly be on shore any where thereabouts.
Secondly, when I came to measure the mark with my own
foot, I found my foot not so large by a great deal: both these
things Slled my head with new imaginations, and gave me the
vapours again to the highest degree, so that I shook with cold,
like one in an ague, and I went home again, filled with the
belief that some man or men had been on shore there; or, in
short, that the island was inhabited, and I might be surprised
before I was aware; and what course to take for my security,
I knew not.
O what ridiculous resolutions men take, when possessed with
fear! It deprives them of the use of those means which reason
offers for their relief. The first thing I proposed to myself
was, to throw down my enclosures, and turn all my tame cattle
wild into the woods, that the enemy might not find them, and
then frequent the island in prospect of the same, or the like
booty; then the simple thing of digging up my two corn fields,
that they might not find such a grain there, and still be
prompted to frequent the island; then to demolish my bower
and tent. that they might not see any vestiges of habitation,
and be tempted to look farther, in order to find out the per-
sons mhabiting.
These were the subjects of the first night's cogitation, after
I was come home again, while the apprehensions which had
so over run my mind were fresh upon me, and my head was
full of vapours, as above. Thus fear of danger is ten thousand
times more ternfy ing than danger itself, when apparent to the
eyes; and we find the burden of anxiety greater by much, than
the evil which we are anxious about; but, which was worse
than alt this. I had not that relief in this trouble from the
resignation I used to practise, that I hoped to have. I looked,
I thought, like Saul, who complained not only that the Phi-
listines were upon him, but that God had forsaken him; for
I did not now take due ways to compose my mind, by crying
to God in my distress, and resting upon his providence, as I
had done before, for my defence and deliverance; which if I
had done. I had, at least, been more cheerfully supported
under this new surprise, and perhaps carried through it with
more resolution.
This cnfusinn of my thoughts kept me waking all night;
but, in the morning, I fell asleep, and having, by the amuse-
ment of my mind, been, as,it were, tired, and my spirits
exhausted, I slept very soundly, and awaked much better
composed than ever L had been before. And now I began to
think sedately; and, upon the utmost debate with myself, I
concluded, that this island, which was so exceeding pleasant,
fruitful, and no farther from the main land than as I had seen,
was not so entirely abandoned as I might imagine: that although
there were no stated inhabitants who lived on the spot, yet
that there might sometimes come boats off from the shore,
who either with design, or perhaps never but when they were
driven by cross winds, might come to this place: that I had
lived 6fteen years now, and had not met with the least shadow
or figure of any people before; and that if at any time they
should be driven here, it was probable they went away again
as soon as ever they could, seeing they had never thought fit
to fix there, upon any occasion, to this time; that the most I
could suggest any danger from, was, from any such casual
accidental landing of straggling people from the main; who,
as it was likely, if they were driven hither, were here against
their wills, so they made no stay here, but went off again with
all possible speed, seldom staying one night on shore, lest they
should not have the help of the tides and daylight back again;
and that therefore I had nothing to do but to consider of some
safe retreat, in case I should see any savages land upon the
spot.
Now I began sorely to repent, that I had dug my cave so
large as to bring a door through again, which door, as 1 said,
came out beyond where my fortification joined to the rock.
Upon maturely considering this, therefore. I resolved to draw
me a second fortification, in the same manner of a semicircle,
at a distance from my wall, just where I had planted a double
row of trees, about twelve years before, of which I made
mention These trees having been planted so thick before,
there. wanted but a few piles to be driven between them, that
they should be thicker and stronger, and my wall would be
soon finished.
So that I had now a double wall, and my outer wall was
thickened with pieces of timber, old cable, and every thing
I could think of to make it strong; having in it seven little
holes, about as big as I might put my aim out at I the
inside of this I thickened my wall to about ten feet thick,
continually bringing earth out of my cave, and laying it at the
foot of the wall, and walking upon it and through the seven
holes I contrived to plant the muskets, of which I took notice
that I gat seven on shore out of the ship; these, I say I
planted like my cannon, and fitted them into frames that held
them like a carriage, that so I could fire all the seven guns in
two minutes' time. This wall I was many a weary month in
finishing, and yet never thought myself safe till it was done.
When this was done, I stuck all V e ground without my
wall, for a great way every way, as full with stakes or sticks
of the osier like wood, which I found so apt to grow, as they
could well stand; insomuch that I believe I might set in near
twenty thousand of them, leaving a pretty large space between
them and my wall, that I might have room to see an enemy,
and they might have no shelter from the young trees, if they
attempted to approach my outer wall
Thus, in two years' time, X had a thick grove; and, in five
br six years' time, I had a wood before my dwelling grown so
monstrous thick and strong, that it was indeed perfectly im -
passable: and no man, of what kind soever, would ever ima-
gine.that there was any thing beyond it, much less a habitation.
As for the way I proposed to myself to go in and oat (for I
lefl no avenue), it was by setting two ladders; one to a part
of the rock whjch was low, and then broke in, and left room
to place another ladder upon that: so when the two ladders
were taken down, no man living could come down to me
without mischiefing himself; and if they had come down, they
were still on the outside of my outer wall.
Thus I took all the measures human prudence could suggest
for my own preservation. and it will be seen, at length. that
they were not altogether without just reason, though I fore-
saw nothing at that time, more than my mere fear suggested
to me.
While this was doing, I was n->t altogether careless of my
other affairs; for I had a great concern upon me'for my little
herd of goats: they were not only a present supply to me upon
every occasion, and began to be sufficient to me, without the
expense of powder and shot, but also abated the fatigue of my
burning after the wild ones; and I was loath to lose the ad-
vantage of them, and to have them all to nurse up over again.
To this purpose, after long consideration, I could think. of
hut two ways to preserve them: one was to find another con-
venient place to dig a cave under ground, and to drive them
into it every night; and the other was to enclose two or three
little bits of land, remote from one another, and as much
concealed as I could, where I might keep about half a dozen
young goats in each place, so that if any disaster happened to
the flock in general, I might be able to raise them again with
little trouble and time: and this, though it would require a
great deal of time and labour, I thought was the most rational
design.
Accordingly I spent some time to find out the most retired
parts of the island; and I pitched upon one which was as pri-
vate indeed as my heart could wish; for it was a little damp
piece of ground in the middle of the hollow and thick woods,
where, as is observed, I almost lost myself once before, en-
deavouring to come back that way from the eastern part of
the island Here I found a clear piece of land, near three acres,
so surrounded with woods, that it was almost an enclosure by
nature; at least it did not want near so much labour to make
it so, as the other pieces of ground I had worked so hard at.
1 immediately went to work with this piece of ground; and,
in less than a month's time, I had so fenced it round, that my
flock or herd, call it which you please, which were not so
wild now as at first they might be supposed to be, were well
enough secured in it So, without any farther delay, I re-
moved ten she-goats and two he-goats to this piece, and when
they were there, I continued to perfect the fence, till I had
made it as secure as the other, which, however, I did at more
leisure, and it took me up more time by a great deal.
All this labour I was at the expense of, purely from my
apprehensions on the account of the print of a man's foot
which I had seen; for as yet I never saw any human creature
come near the island; and I had now lived two years under
these uneasinesses, which indeed made my life much less
comfortable than it was before, as may well be imagined by
any who know what it is to live in the constant snare of the
fear of man: and this I must observe with grief too, that the
discomposure of my mind had too great impressions also upon
the religious part of my thoughts; for the dread and terror of
falling into the hands of savages and cannibals lay so upon my
spirits, that I seldom found myself in a due temper for appli-
cation to my Maker, at least not with the sedate calmness and
resignation of soul which I was wont to do. I rather prayed
to God a3 under great affliction and pressure of mind, sur-
rounded with danger, and in expectation every night of being
murdered and devoured before morning; and I must testify,
from my experience, that a temper of peace, thankfulness,
love, and affection, is much the more proper frame tor prayer,
than that of terror and discomposure; and that under the
dread of mischief impending, a man is no more fit for a com-
forting performance of the duty of praying to God, than he is
for repentance on a sick bed; for these discomposures affect
the mind as the others do the body; and the discomposure of
the mind must necessarily he as great a disability as that of the
body, and much greater, praying to God bcing properly an.
act of the mind, not of the body.
But to go on: after I had thus secured one part of my little
living stock, I went about the whole island, searching for ano-
ther private place, to make such another deposit; when wander-
ing more to the west point of the island than I had ever done
yet, and looking out to sea, I thought I saw a boat upon the
sea, at a great distance. I had found a perspective glass or two,
in one of the seamen's chests which 1 saved out of our ship,
but I had it not about me, and this was so remote that I could
not tell what to make of it, though I looked at it till my eyes
were not able to hold to look any longer Whether it was a
boat or not, I do not know; but as I descended from the hill,
I could see no more of it, so I gave it over; only I resolved
to go no more v. illiout a perspective glass in my pocket.
When I was come down the hill, to the end of the island,
where indeed I had never been before, I was presently con-
vinced that the seeing the print of a man's foot was not such
a strange thing in the island as I imagined; and, but that it
was a special providence that 1 was cast upon the side of the
island where the savages never came, I should easily have
known that nothing was more frequent than for the canoes
from the main, when. they happened to be a little too far out
to sea, to shoot over to that side of the island for harbour;
likewise, as they often met, and fought in their canoes, the
victors, havmg taken any prisoners, would bring them over to
this shore, where, according to their dreadful customs, being
all cannibals, they would kill and eat them. Of which here-
after.
When I was come down the hill to the shore, as I said
above, being the S. W point of the island, I was perfectly
confounded and amazed; nor is it possible for me to express
the horror of my mind, at seemg the shoiv spread with skulls,
hands. feet, and other bones of human bodies; and particu-
larly I observed a place where there had been a fire made,
and a circle dug in the earth. like a cockpit, v.-here it'is
supposed the savage "wretches had sat down to their mhumatL
feastmgs upon the bodies of their fellow creatures.
X was so astonished with the sight of these things, that X
entertained no notions of any danger to myself from it for a
long while: all my apprehensions were buried in the thoughts
of such a pitch of inhuman, hellish brutality, and the horror
of the degeneracy of human nature. which, though I had
heard of often, yet I never had so near a view of before; in
short. I turned away my face from the horrid spectacle my
stomach grew sick, and I was just at the point of fainting,
when nature discharged the disorder from my stomach. and,
having vomited with an uncommon violence, I was a little
relieved, but could not bear to stay in the place a moment^
so I got me up the hill again, with all the speed I could, and
walked on towards my own habitation.
When I came a little out ot that part of the island, I stood
still a while as amazed; and then recovering myself I looked
tip with the utmost affection of my soul, and, with a flood of
tears in my eyes, gave God thanks, that had cast my hrst lot
in a part of the world where I was distinguished from such
dreadful creatures as these; and that though I had esteemed
my present condition very miserable, had yet given me so
many comforts in it, that I had still more to give thanks for,
than to complain of; and this, above all, that I had, even in
this miserable condition, been comforted with the knowledge
of Himself. and the hope of his blessing, which was a felicity1
more than sufficiently equivalent to all the misery which I had
Buffered, or could suffer
In this frame of thankfulness, I went home to my castle,
and began to be much easier now, as to the safety of my
circumstances, than ever I was before; for 1 observed that
these wretches never came to this island in search of what;
thev could get; perhaps not seeking, not wanting, or not
expecting any thing here; and having often, no doubt, been
up in the covered woody part of it, without finding any thing
to their purpose. I knew 1 had been here now almost eighteen,
years, and never saw the least footsteps of human creature
there before; and might be here eighteen more as entirely
N
concealed as I was *iow, if I did not discover myself to theiny
which I had no manner of occasion to do; it being my only
business- to keep myself entirely concealed where I was, unless
I found a better sort of creatures than cannibals to make my-
self known to.
Yet I entertained such an abhorrence of the savage wretches
that I have been speaking of, and of the wretched inhuman
custom of 'heir devouring and eating one auother up, that t
contmued pensive and sad, and kept close within my own
circle for almost two years after this When I say my own
circle, I mean by it my three plantations, viz. my castle, niy
country seat, which I called my bower, and my enclosure in
the woods: nor did I look after this for any other use than as
an enclosure for my goats: tor the aversion which nature gave
me to these hellish wretches was such,- that 1 was as fearful
of seeing them, as of seeing the devil himself. Nor did I so
much as g© to look after my boat in all this time, but began
gather to think of making me another; for I could not think
of ever making any more attempts to bring the other boat
round the island to me, lest I should meet with some of those
creatures at sea, in which, if I had happened to have fallen
into their hands, I knew what would have been my lot.
Time, however, and the satisfaction I had that I was in no
danger of being discovered by these peX)ple, began to wear off
my uneasmess about them; and I began to live just in .the
£ame composed manner as before; only with this difference,
th«t 1 used more caution, and kept my eyes more about me
than I did before, lest I should happen to be seen by any of
tbem. and particularly I was more cautious in firing my gun,
lest any of them being on the island should happen te hear it;
and it was therefore a very good providence to me that I had
furnished myself with a tame breed of goats, that I needed
not hunt any move about the woods, or shoot at them; and
if I did catch any of them after this, it was by traps and snares,
as l had done before: so that for two years after this, I believe
1 never fired my gun once off though 1 never went out without
it; and, which was more, as I had saved three pistols out of
the ship, I always carried them out with me, or at least two
of them, sticking them in my goat-skin belt: 1 likewise fur-
bished up one of the great cutlasses that ' had out of the ship,
ar.d made me a belt to put it on also; so that I was now a
aost formidable fellow to look at, when 1 went abroad, if yot*
add to the former description of myself the particular of two
pistols, and a great broad sword, hanging at my side in a belt,
but without a scabbard. i
Things going on thus, as I have said, for some time, I
6eemed, excepting these cautions, to be reduced to my former
calm, sedate way of living. Ml these things tended to showing
me, more and more, how far my condition was from being
miserable, compared to some others, nay, to manv other
particulars of life, which it might have pleased God to have
made my lot. It put me upon reflecting how little repinmg
there would be among mankind, at any condition of life, if
people would rather compare their condition with those that
are worse, In order to be thankful, than be always comparmg
them with those which are better, to assist their murmuring*
and complainings.
As in my present condition there were not really many
things which I wanted, so indeed I thought that the frights
X had been in about these savage wretches, ami the concern.
I had been in for my own preservation, had taken off the
edge of my invention for my own conveniences; and 1 bad
dropped a good design, which I had once bent.my thoughts
upon, and that was, to try if I could not make some of my
barley into malt, and then try to brew myself some beer.
This was really a whimsical thought, au-J I reproved myself
often for the simplicity of it; for I presently saw there would!
be the want of several things necessary to the making my beer
that it would be impossible for me to supply: as, first, casks
to preserve it in, which was a thing that. as I have observed
already, I could never compass;'no, though I spent not many
days, but weeks, nay, months, in attempting it, but to no
purpose. In the next place, I had no hops to make it keep,
no yeast to make it work, no copper or kettle to make it boil;
and yet, had not all these things intervened, I mean the frights
and terrors I was in about the savages, I had undertaken it,
and perhaps brought it to pass too; for I seldom gave any
thing over without accomplishing it, when 1 once had it in.
my head enough to begin it. ,.-.
But my Invention now ran quite another way; for night and
day I could think of nothing but how I might destroy some of
these monsters in their cruel bloody entertainment, and, if
possible, save the victim they should bring hither to des/roy*
jt would take up a larger volume than this whole work. H
intended to be, to set down all the contrivances I hatched, or
rather brooded upon, in m> thoughts, tor the destroying these
creatures, .or at least frighting ihem, so as to prevent their
coming hither any more; but all whs abortive, nothmg could
be possible to take effect, unless I was to be there to do it
toy bell': and what could one man do among them, when per-
haps there might be twenty or thirtv of them together, with
their darts. or their bows and arrows, with which they could
shoot as true to a mark, as I could with my gun?
, Some times 1 contrived to dig a hole under the place where
they made their fire, and put in five or six pounds t,f gun-
powder, which, when they kindled their fire, would conse-
quently take fire, and blow up all that was near it. But as,
in the first place, I should be very loath to waste so much
powder upon them, my btOVe bemg imw within the quantity
of one barrel. so neither could I he sure of its going oft-, at
any certain time, when it might surprise ihem, and at best
that it would do little more than just blow the fire about their
ears, and fright them, but not sufficient to make them forsake
the place; so I laid it aside, and then proposed that I would
place myself m ambush, m some convenient place, with my
three guns, all double loaded, and, in the middle of their
bloody ceremony, let fly at them, when. I should be sure to
-kill or wound perhaps two or three at every shot, and then
falling in upon them with my three pistols, and my sword,
1 made no doubt but that if there were twenty I should kill
them all. This fancy pleased my thoughts for some weeks,
an- 1 was so full of it that I often dreamt of it, and sometimes
thai I was just going to let fly at them in my sleep
I went so far with it in my imagination, that t employed
m> M;lf several days to find out proper places to put myself in
ambu-cade, as I said, to watch for them. and I went fre-
quently to the place itself, winch was now grown more fami-
liar to me and especially while my mind was thus filled with
thoughts of revenge, and of a bloody putting twenty or thirty
of them to the sword, as I may call it. but the horror I had
at the place. and at the- signals of the barbarous wretches
devouring one another, abated my malice
W ell. at length 1 found a place in the side of the hill, where
I was satisfied 1 might securely wait till I saw any of their
boat« coming, and might then, even before they "would be
i-'judy to come on ahore, convey myself unseen into thicket*
of the frees, in one of which there was a hollow large enough
to conceal me entirely, and where I might sit. and observe all
their bloody doings, and take my full aim at their heads, when
they were so close together as that it would be next to impos-
sible that I should miss my shot, or tnat I could fail wounding
three or four of them at the first shot.
In this place then I resolved to fix my design, and accord-
ingly I prepared two muskets, and my ordinary fowling-piece.
The two muskets I loaded with a brace of slugs each, and four
or fire smaller bullets, about the size of pistol bullets; and the
fowling-piece I loaded with nearaliandl'd of swan-shot, of the
largest size. I also loaded my pistols with about four bullets
each: and irt this posture, well provided with ammunition for
a second and third charge, I prepared myself for my expe*
dttion.
(-After I had thus laid the scheme for my design, and, in mf
imagination, put it in practice, I continually made my tour
every morning up to the top of the hill, which was from my
castle, as I called it, about three miles, or more, to see if I
could observe any boats upon the sea, coming near the island,
or standing over towards it; but I began to tire of this hard
duty, after I had for two or three months constantly kept my
watch, and come always back without any discovery, there
having not in all that time been the least appearance, not only
on or near the shore, but not on the whole ocean, so far as
my eyes or glasses could reach every way
As long as I kept up my daily tour to the hill to look out,
so long also I kept up the vigour of my desigu. and my spirits
seemed to be all the while in a suitable frame, for so outrage-
ous an execution as the killing twenty or thirty naked savages
for an offence whioh I had not at all entered into a discussioa
of in my thoughts, any further than my passions were at first
fired by the horror I conceived at the unnatural custom ol the
people of that country; who, it seems, had been suffered by
Providence, in his wise disposition of the world, to have no
other guide than that of their own abominable and vitiated!
passions; and consequently were left, and perhaps had been.
so for some ages, to act such horrid things, and receive suchi
dreadful customs, as nothing but nature, entirely abandoned
of Heaven, and actuated by some hellish degeneracy could
have run them into But now, when, as I have said, I began.
Iq be weary of the fruitless excursion which I had made-so
N3
long, and so far, every morning in vain, so my opinion of the
action itself began to alter, and I began, with cooler and
calmer thoughts, to consider what it was I was gomg to en-
gage in; what anthority or call I had, to pretend to be judge
and executioner npon these men as criminals, whom Heaven
had thought fit, for so many ages, to suffer, unpunished, to go
on, and to be, as it were, the executioners of his judgments
upon one another; also how far these people were offenders
against me, and what light I had to engage in the quarrel of
that blood, which they shed promiscuously one upon another.
I debated this very often with myself thus: How do I know
-what God himself judges in this particular case? It is certain
these people do not commit this as a crime: it is not against
their own consciences reproving, or their light reproaching
them. They do not know it to be an offence, and then com-
mit it in defiance of divine justice, as we do in almost all the
sins we commit. They think it no more a crime to kill a
captive taken in war. than we do to kill an ox; nor to eat
human flesh, than we do to eat mutton.
When I had considered this a Utile, it followed necessarily
rlhat I was certainly in the wrong i.i it; that these people were
not murderers in the sense that I had before condemned them
in my thoughts, any more than those Christians weVe mur-
derers who often put to death the prisoners taken in battle,
or more frequently, upon many occasions, put whole troopsj
of men to the sword, without giving quarter, though they
threw down their arms, and submitted.
In the next place it occurred to me, that albeit the usage
they gave one another was thus brutish and inhuman, yet it
-was really nothing to me; that these people had done me no
injury; that if they attempted me, or I saw it necessary for
my immediate preservation to fall upon them, something
might be said for it; but that I was yet out of their power,
and thev had really no knowledge of me, and consequently
no desgn upon me; and therefore it could not be just for me
to fall upon them: that this would justify the conduct of the
Spaniards, in all their barbarities practised in Amerca, where
they destroyed millions of these people, who, however they
were idolaters and barbarians, and had several bloody and
barbarous rites in their customs, such as sacrificing human
.bod is to their idols, were yet, as to the Spaniards, very
Ujnqcent people; and that the "rooting them. out of the country
)a spoken of with the utmost abhorrence and detestation, even
b* the Spaniards themselves, at this time, and by all other
Christian nations' of Europe, as a mere butchery, and a
bloody and unnatural Ijiece of cruelty, unjustifiable either to
God or man; and such' as for which the very name of a
Spaniard is reckoned to be frightful and terrible to all people
of humanity, or of Christian compassion; as if the kingdom
of Spain were particularly eminent for the product of a race
of men who were without principles of tenderness, or the
common bowels of pity to the miserable, which is reckoned
to be a mark of generous temper in the mind.
These considerations really put me to a pause, and to a kind
of full stop and I began, by little and little, to be off my
design, and to conclude I bad taken wroug measures in my
resolutions to attack the savages; that it was not my business
to meddle with them,' unless they first attacked me, and this
it was my business, if possible, to prevent; but that if 1 were
discovered, atid attacked, then I knew my duty.
On the other hand, I argued with myself that this really
was the way not to deliver myself, but entirely to ruin and
destroy myself; for unless I was sure to kill every one that
not only should be on shore at that time, hut that should ever
come on shore afterwards, if but one of them escaped to tell
their country people what had happened, they would come
over again, by thousands, to revenge the death of their fellows;
and I should only bring upon myself a certain destruction,
which at present I had no manner of occasion for.
Upon the whole, 1 concluded that neither in principles nor
in policy 1 ought, one way or other, to concern myself in this
affair. that my business was, by all possible means, to conceal
myself from them,' and not to leave the least signal to them;
to gue^s bv that there were any living creatures upon the
island; 1 mean of human shape.
Religion joined in with this prudential resolution; and I was
convinced now many ways, that I was perfectly out oi my
duty, when I was laying all my bloody schemes for the de-
struction of innocent creatures; I mean innocent as to me. Aft
to the crimes they were guilty of towards one another, I had
nothing to do with them: they were national, and I ought to
leave them to the justice of God, who is the governor of na-
tions. and knows how to bring public judgments upon those
who offend in a public manner, by such ways as best please hiplc
This appeared so clear to me.nov, that nothing was a
greater satisfaction to me than that I had not been suffered to
do a thing which I now saw so much reason to believe would
have been no less a sin, than that of wilful murder, if I bad
committed it; and I gave most hunble thanks on my knees
to God, that had thus delivered me from blood-guiltiness,
beseeching him to grant me the protection of his providence,
that I might not fall into the hands of barbarians, or that I
might not lay my hands upon them, unless 1 had a more clear
call from Heaven to do it, in defence of my own life.
In this disposition I continued for near a year after this; and
so far was I from desiring an occasion for falling upon these
wretches, that in all that time I never once went up the hill
to see whether there were any of them in sight, or to know
whether any of them had been on shore there or not, that I
might not be tempted to renew any of my contrivances against
them, or be provoked by any advantage which might present
itself to fall upon them; only this I did, 1 went and removed
my boat, which 1 had on the other side of the island, and
carried it down to the east end of the whole island, where I
ran it into a little cove, which I found under some high rocks,
and where I knew, by reason of the currents, the savages
durst not, at least would not, come with their boats, upon
any account whatsoever.
With my boat, I carried away every thing that I had left
there belonging to her, though not necessary for the bare go-
ing thither, viz. a mast and sail, which I had made for her,
and a thing like an anchor, but indeed which could not be
called either anchor or grappling: however, it was the best I
could make of its kind. All these I removed, that there
.might not be the least shadow of any discovery, or any ap-
pearance of any boat, or of any human habitation upon the
island.
Besides this, I kept myself, as I said, more retired than
ever, and seldom went from my cell, other than upon rr.y
constant employment, viz. to milk my she goats, and manage
my little flock in the wood, which as it was on the other part
of the island, was quite out of danger; for certain it is, that
these savage people, who sometimes haunted this island, never
came with any thoughts of finding any thing here, and conse-
quently never wandered off from the coast; anil I doubt not,
hut they might have been several times on shore, after toy
apprehensions of them had made me cautious* as well as
before: and indeed I looked back with some horror upon the
thoughts of what my condition would have been if I had
chopped upon them, and been discovered before thft, when
naked ond unarmed, except with one gun, and that loaded
often only with small shot. I walked every where peeping
and peering about the island, to see what I could get: what
a surprise should I have been in, if, when I discovered the
print of a man's foot, I had, instead of that seen fifteen or
twenty savages, and found them pursufng me, and, by the
swiftness of their running, no possibility of my escaping them!
The thoughts of this sometimes sunk my very soul within
me, and distressed my mind so much that I could not soon
recover it; to think what I should have done, and how I not
only should not have been able to resist them, but even should
not have had presence of mind enough to do what I might have
done, much less what now, after so much consideration and
preparation, I might be able to do Indeed, after serious
thinking of these things, I would be very melancholy, and
sometimes it would last a great while; but I resolved it at last
all into thankfulness to that Providence which had delivered
me from so many unseen dangers, and had kept me from
tli sc misclnets, which I could no way have been the agent in
delivering myself from: because I hail not the least notion of
any such thing depending, or the least supposition of its being
possible.
This renewed a contemplation which often had come to
my thoughts in former time, when first 1 began to see the
mereiful dispositions of Heaven, in the dangers w< run through
in this life: how wonderfully we are delivered, when we know
nothing of it: how.when we are in (a quandary, as we call it)
a doubt or hesitation, whether to go this way, or that way, a
secret hint should direct us this way, when we intended to go
that way; nay, when sense, our own inclination, and perhaps
business, has called to go the other way, yet a strange impres-
sion upon the mind, from we know not what springs, and by
we know not what power, shall over-rule us to go this way;
and it shall afterwards appear, that had we gone that way
which we would have gone, and even to our imagination
ought to have gone, we should have been ruined and lost.
Upo< these, and many like reflections, I afterwards made it
a certain rule with me, that whenever I found those secret
hints, or pressings of my mind, to doing or not doing any
thing that presented, or to going this way or that way, I never
failed to obey the secret dictate, though I knew no other rea-
son for it, than that such a pressure or such a hint, hung upon
my mind. I could give many examples of the success of this
conduct, in the course of my life; but more especially in the
Tatter part of my inhabiting this unhappy island: besides many
occasions which it is very likely I might have taken notice of,
if I had seen with the same eyes then, that I saw with now.
But it is never too late to be wise; and I cannot but advise all
considering men, whose lives are attended with such extraor-
dinary incidents as mine, or even though not so extraordinary,
not to slight such secret intimations of Providence, let them
come from what invisible intelligence they will, that I shall
not discuss, and perhaps cannot account for; but certainly they
are a proof of the converse of spirits, and the secret commu-
nication between those unbodied, and those unimbodied, and
such a proof as can never be withstood: of which I shall have
occasion to give some very remarkable instances in the re-
mainder of my solitary residence in this dismal place.
I believe the reader of this will not think it strange if I con-
fess that these anxieties, these constant dangers I lived in,
and the concern that was now upon me, put an end to all in-
vention, and to all the contrivances that 1 had laid for my fu-
ture accommodations and conveniences. I had the care of
my safety more now upon my hands, than that of my food.
I cared not to drive a nail, or chop.a stick of wood now, for
fear the noise I should make should be heard, much less would
I fire » gun for the same reason; and above all I was very uneasy
at making any lire, lest the smoke, which is visible at a jreat
distance in the day, should betray me; and for this reason I re-
moved that part of my business which required fire, such as
burning of pots and pipes, &c. into my new apartment in the
woods, where, after I had been some time, I found, to my un-
speakable consolation, a mere natural cave in the earth, which
went in a vast way, and where, I dare say, no savage, had he
been at the mouth of it, would be so hardy as to ven-
ture in; nor indeed would any man else, but one who, like me,
wanted nothing so much as a safe retreat.
The mouth of this hollow was at the bottom of a great rock,
where, by mere accident (I would say, if I did not see abun-
dant reason to ascribe all such things how to Providence), t
was cutting down some thick branches of trees, to make char-
coal; and before I go so, I must observe the reason of my
making this charcoal, which was this:
I was afraid of making a smoke about my habitation, as I
said before; and yet I could not live there without baking my
bread, Cooking my meat, &c; so I contrived to burn some
wood here, as I had seen done in England under turf, till it
became chark, or dry coal; and then putting the fire out, I
preserved the coal to carry home, and perform the other ser-
vices which fire was wanting for at home, without danger
of smoke.
But this by the bye, while I was cutting down some wood
here, I perceived that, behind a very thick branch of low
brushwood, or underwood, there was a kind of hollow place. I
was carious to look into it, and getting with difficulty into the
mouth of it, I found it was pretty large, that isto say, sufficient
for me to stand upright in it, and perhaps another with me; but
I must confess to you, I made more haste out than I did in,
when looking further into the place, which was perfectly
dark, I saw two broad shining eyes of some creature, whether
devil or man I knew not, which twinkled like two stars; the
dim light from the cave's mouth shining directly in, and mak-
ing the reflexion.
However, after some pause, I recovered myself, and began
to call myself a thousand fools, and tell myself, that he that
was afraid to see the devil, was not fit to live twenty years in
an island all alone, and that I durst to believe there was no-
thing in this cave that was more frightful than myself. Upon
this, plucking up my courage, I took up a great fire brand, and
in I rushed again,with the stick flaming in my hand. I had
not gone three steps in, but I was almost as much frightened
as I was before; for I heard a very loud sigh, like that of a
man in some pain, and it was followed by a broken noise, as if
of words half expressed, and then a deep sigh again. I step-
ped back, and was indeed struck with such a surprise, that it
put me into a cold sweat; and if I had had a hat on my head,
I will not answer for it, that my hair might not have lifted it
off. But still pluckmg up my spirits as well as I could, and
encouraging myself a little, with considering that the power
and presence of God was every where, and was able to pro-
tect me, I stepped forward again, and, by the light of the fire-
brand, holding it up a little over my head, I saw, lying on the
ground, a most monstrous frightful old he-goat, just making;
his will, as we say, gasping for life, and dying indeed of mere
old age
I stirred him a little, to see if I could get him out, aud he es-
sayed to get up, but was not able to raise himself: and I thought
with myself he might even lie there; for if he had frightened
me so, he would certainly fright any of the savages, if any of
them should be so hardy as to come in there, while he had
any life in him.
I was now recovered from my surprise, and began to look
round me, when I found the cave was bill very small; that is
to say, it might be about twelve feet over, but in no manner
of shape either round or square, no hands having ever been.
employed in making it except those of mere uature. I ob-
served also, that there was a place at the farthest side of it,
that went in farther, but was so low that it required me to
creep upon my hands and knees to go into it, and whither it
went, I knew not; so having no candle, I gave it over for some
time, hut resolved to come again the next day, provided with
candles and a timterbox, which I had made of the lock of
one of the muskets, with some wildfire in the pan
Accordingly, the next day, I came provided with six large
candles of my own making, for I made very good candles now
of goal's tallow: and, going into this low place, 1 was obliged
to creep upon all fours, as I have said. almost ten yards, which,
by the way, I thought was a venture bold enough, consider-
ing that I knew not how far it might go, or what was beyond
it. When I was got through the strait, I found the roof rose
higher up, I believe near twenty feet; but never was such a
glorious sight seen in the island, I dare say, as it was, to look
round the sii'es and roof of this vault or cave The walls re-
flected a hundred thousand lights to me from my two candles:
what it was in the rock, whether diamonds, or any other pre-
cious stones, or gold, which I rather supposed it to be, I knew
not.
The place I was in, was a most delightful cavity, or grotto,
of its kind, as could be expected (hough perfectly dark: the
floor was dry and level, and had a sort of small loose gravel
upon it, so that there was no nauseous or venemous creature,
to be seen; neither was there any damp or wet on the sides
or roof. The only difficulty in it was the entrance, wliich,
however, as it was a place of security, and such a retreat as I

iranted, I thought that was a convenience; so that 1 was real-
ly rejoiced at the discovery, and resolved, without any delay,
to bring some of those things which I was most anxious about
to this place; particularly I resolved to bring hither my maga-
zine of powder, and all my spare arms, viz. two fowling pie-
ces (for I had three in all), aud three muskets for of them I
had eight in all; so I kept at my castle only live, which stood
ready mounted, like pieces of cannon, on my outmost fence,
and were ready also to take out upon any expedition.
Upon this occasion of removing my ammunition, I was
obliged to open the barrel of powder which I tookup out of the
sea and which had been wet; and I found that the water had
penetrated about three or four inches into the powder on
every side, which, caking and growmg hard, had preserved
the inside like a kernel in a shell, so that I had near sixty
pounds of very good powder in the centre of the cask; and
this was an agreeable discovery to me at that time: so I
carried all away thither, never keeping above two or three
pounds of powder with me in my castle, for fear of surprise of
any kind. I also carried thitherall thelead (had left for bullets.
I fancied myself now like one of the ancient giants, which
-were said to live in caves and holes in the rocks, where none
could come at them; fori persuaded myself, while I was here,
if five hundred savages were to hunt me, they could never
find me out; or if they did, they would not venture to attack
me here.
The old goat whom I found expiring, died in the mouth of
the cave, the next day after 1 made this discovery; and I found
it much easier to dig a great hole there and throw him in,
and cover him with earth, than to drag him out, so I interred
him there, to prevent offence to my nose.
I was now in my twenty-third year of residence in this
island, and was so naturalized to the place, and to the man-
ner of living that could I have but enjoyed the certainty that no
•avages would come to the place to disturb me, I could have
been content to have capitulated for spending the rest of
my time there, even to the last moment, till I had laid me
down and died, like the old goat in the cave. I had also ar-
rived to some little diversions and amusements, which made
the time pass more pleasantly with mc a great deal than it
did before; as, first, I had taught my Poll as I noted before, to
(peak, and he did It so familiarlv, and talked so articulately
O '
and plain, that it was very pleasant to me; and he lived wifii,
pie no less than six and tweDty years. How long he might
live afterwards I know not; though I know they have a notion,
in the Brasils, that they live a hundred years. Perhaps poor
Poll may be alive there still, calling after' poor Iiobin Crusoe*
to this day. I wish no Englishman the ill luck to come there
and hear him; but if he did, he would certainly believe it
was the devil. My dog was a very pleasant and loving
companion to me for no less than sixteen years of my time,
and then died of mere old age. As for my cats, they multi-
plied, as I have observed, to that degree, that I was obliged
to shoot several of them at first to keep them from devouring
me, and all I had; but at length when the two old ones I
brought with me were gone, and after sometime continually
driving them from me, and letting them have no provision
with me, they all ran wild into the woods, except two oc
three favourites, which I kept tame, and whose young, whea
they had any, I always drowned; and these were part of my
family. Besides these, I always kept two or three household
kids about me which I taught to feed out of my hand; and 1
had some more parrots, which talked pretty well; and would
all call • Robin Crusoe," but none like my first; nor, indeed,
did I take the pains with any of them that I had done with
him. I had also several tame sea fowls, whose names I know
uot, which I caught upon the shore, and cut their wings; and
the little stakes, which I had planted before my castle wall,
being now grown up to a good thick grove, these fowls all
lived among these low trees, and bred there, which was very
agreeable to me; so that, as I said above, I began to be very
well contented with the life I led, if it might but have been
secured from the dread of the savages.
But it was otherwise directed; and it may not lie amiss for
all people who shall meet with my story, to make this just
observation from it; viz. how frequently, in the course of our
lives, the evil, which in itself we seek most to shun, and
which, when we are fallen into, is the most dreadful to us, ist
oftentimes the very means or door of our deliverance, by
which alone we can be raised again from the affliction we arc
falling into. I could give many examples of this in the course
of my unaccountable life; hut In nothing was it more particu-
larly remarkable than in the circumstances of the last vest's
of my solitary residence in this island.
It was now in the month of December, as I said above, in
my twenty-third year; and this being the southern solstice,
for winter I cannot call it, was the particular time of my har-
vest, and required my being pretty much abroad in the fields;
when going out pretty early in the morning, even before it
was thorough day light, I was surprised with seeing a light of
snnic fire upon the shore, at a distance from me of about two
miles, towards the end of the island where I had observed
some savages had been, as before) but not on the other side,
tut to my great affliction, it was on my side of the island.
I was indeed terribly surprised at the sight, and stopped
short within my grove, not daring to go out, lest I might be
surprised; and yet I had no more peace within from the ap-
prehensions I had that if these savages in rambling over the
bland, should find my torn standing, or cut, or any of my
Works and improvements, they would immediately conclude,
that there were people in the place, and would then never
give over till they found me out. In this extremity I went
back directly to my castle, pulled up the ladder after me,
having made all things without look as wild and natural as I
eould.
Then I prepared myself within, putting myself in a pos-
tare of defence. I loaded all my cannon, as I called them,
that is to say my muskets, which were mounted upon my new
fortification, and all my pistols, and resolved to defend myself
to the last gasp; not forgetting seriously to recommend my-
self to the Divine Protection, and earnestly to pray to God to
deliver me out of the hands of the barbarians; and in this pos-
ture I continued about two hours, but began to be mighty im-
patient fur intelligence abroad, for I had no spies to send out.
After sitting awhile longer, and musing what I should do
in this case, 1 was not able to bear sitting in ignorance longer;
so setting up my ladder to the side of the hill, where there
was a flat place, as I observed before, and then pulling the
ladder up after me, I set it up again and so mounted to the top
of the hill; and pulling out my perspective glass, which I had
taken on purpose, I laid me down flat on my belly on the
ground, and began to look for the place. I presently found
there were no less than nine naked savages sitting round a
small fire they had made; not to warm them, for they had
no need of that, the weather being extreme hot, but, as I sup-
posed, to dress some of their barbarous diet of human flesh,
which they had brought with them, -whether alive or dead,
I could not know;
They had two canoes -with them, -which they had hauled up
upon the shore; and as it was then tide of ebb, they seemed
to me to wait the return of the flood to go away again. It
is not easy to imagine what confusion this sight put me into,
especially seeing them come on my side of the island, and so
near me too; but when I observed their coming must be al-
ways with the current of the ebb, I began afterwards to be
more sedate in my mind,'being satisfied that I might go
abroad with safety, all the time of tide of flood, if they were
not on shore before; and having made this observation I went
abroad about my harvest-work with the more composure.
As I expected, so it proved; for as soon as the tide made to
the westward, I saw them all take boat and row (or paddle,
as we call it) all away. I should have observed, that for an
hour and more before they went off, they went to dancing,
and I could easily discern their postures and gestures by my
glasses: I could not perceive, by my nicest observation, but
that they were stark naked, and had not the least cover-
ing upon them; hut whether they were men or women, that
I could not distinguish.
As soon as I saw them shipped and gone, I took two guns
upon my shoulders, and two pistols at my girdle, and my
great sword by my side, without a scabbard, and with all the
speed I was able to make, I went away to the hill, where I
had discovered the first appearance of all. As soon as I got
thither, which was not less than two hours (for I could not
go apace being so loaden with arms as I was), I perceived
there had been three canoes more of savages on that place;
and looking out further, I saw they were all at sea together
making over for the main.
This was a dreadful sight to me; especially when going
down to the shore, I could see the marks of horror which the
dismal work they had been about had left behind it, viz. the
blood, the bones, and part of the flesh of human bodies, eaten
and devoured by those wretches with merriment and sport.
I was so filled with indignation at the sight, that I began now
10 premeditate the destruction of the next that I saw there,
let them be who or how many soever.
It seemed evident to me, that the visits which they thus
made to this islaud, were not very frequent; for it was above
fifteen months before any more of them came on shore there
again; that is to say, I never saw them, or any footsteps or
signals of them, in all that time: for, as to the rainy seasons,
then they are sure not to come abroad, at least not so fari yet
all this while I lived uncomfortably, by reason of the constant
apprehensions I was in of their comirfg upon me by surprise:
from whence I observe, that the expectation of evil is more
bitter than the suffering, especially if there is no room to
shake off that expectation, or those apprehensions.
During all this time, I was in a murdering humour; and took
np most of my hours, which should have been better employed,
in contriving how to circumvent and fall upon them the very
next time I should see them, especially if they should be
divided, as they were the last time, into two parties: nor did
I consider at all, that if I killed one party, suppose ten or a
clnzen, I was still the next day, or week, or month, to kill
another, even ad infinitum, till I should be at length no less
a murderer than they were in being man eaters, aud perhaps
much more so.
I spent my days now in great perplexity and anxiety of
mind, expecting that I should one day or other fall into the
hands of these merciless creatures. If I did at any time ven-
ture abroad, it was not without looking round me with the
greatest care and caution imaginable; and now 1 found, to my
great comfort, how happy it was that I had provided a tame
ilock or herd of goats; for J durst not, upon any account,
lire my gun, especially near that side of the island where
they usually came, lest 1 should alarm the savages; audit-
'hey had lied from me now, I was sure to have them come
back again, with perhaps two or three hundred canoes with
them in a few days, and then 1 knew what to expect.
However, I wore out a year and three months more, be-
fore I ever saw any more of the savages; and then I found
them~again, as I shall soon observe. It is true they might
have been there once or twice; but either they made no stay,
or at least I did not hear them: but in the month of May, as
near as I could calculate, and in my four-and-twentieth year,
I had a very strange encounter with them, of which in its
place.
The perturbation of my mind during this fifteen or sixteen
months' interval, was very great I slept unquiet, dreamed
always frightful dreams, and often started put of my sleep in
0 3
the night: in the Jay great troubles overwhelmed my mind;
in the night I dreamed often of killing savages, and the rea-
sons why I might justify the doing of it. But, to wave all
this for a while, it was in the middle of May, on the sixteenth
day, I think, as well as my poor wooden calender would reck-
on; for I marked all upon the post still: I nay, it was on the
sixteenth of May, that it blew a very great storm of wind alt
day, with a great deal of lightning aud thunder, and a very
foul night was after it. 1 know not what was the particular
occasion of it, but as I was reading in the Bible, and taken up
with serious thoughts about my present condition, I was sur-
prised with the noise of a gun, as I thought fired at sea.
This was, to be sure, a surprise of a quite different nature
from any I had met mifh before; for the notions this put
into my thoughts were quite of another kind. I started up in
the greatest haste imaginable; and, in a trice, clapped up my
ladder to the middle place of the rock, and pulled it after me,
and, mounting it the second time, got to the top of the hill:
that very moment a flash of fire bade me listen for a second
gun, which accordingly, in about half a minute, I heard; and
by the sound knew that it was from that part of the sea where
1 was driven out wilh the current in my boat
I immediately considered, that this must be some ship in dis-
tress, and that they had some comrade, or some other ship
in company, and fired these guns for signals of distress, and
to obtain help. I had this presence of mind at that mmute,
as to think that though I could not help tlicm, it may be they
might help me; so I brought together all the dry wood I conl«l
get at hand, aud making a good handsome pile, I set it on fire
opon the hill. The wood was dry, aud blazed freeiy; and
though the wind blew very hard, yet it burnt fairly out, ao
th-it I was certain, if there was any such thing as a ship, they
must needs see it, and no doubt they did; for as soon as ever
my fire blazed up, I heard another gun, aud after that seve-
ral others, all from the same quarter. I plied my fire all night
long, till day broke; and when it was broad day, and the air
cleared up, I saw something at a great distance at sea, fu'.l
east of the island, whether a sail, or a hull, I could not distin-
guish; no, not with my glasses, the distance was so great, and
the weather still something hazy also; at least it was so out at
sea.
I looked frequently at it all that day, and soon pcrceiveu' tiA\
it did not move; so I presently concluded that it was a ship
at anchor; and being eager, you may be sine, to be satisfied,
I took my gun in my hand, and ran towards the south-east
side of the island, to the rocks where I had been formerly
carried away with the current; and getting up there, the
-weather by this time being perfectly clear, I could plainly see,
to my great sorrow, the wreck of a ship cast away in the night
upon those concealed rocks, which I found when I was out in
my boat; and which rocks, as they checked the violence of the
stream, and made a kind of counter-stream, or eddy, were
the occasion of my recovering then from the most desperate,
hopeless condition that ever'I had been in, all my life
Thus, what is one man's safety is another man's destruc-
tion; for it seems these men, whoever they were, being out
of their knowledge, and the rocks being wholly under water,
had been driven upon them in the night, the wind blowing
hard at E. and E. N. E. Had they seen the island, as I must
necessarily suppose they did not, they must, as I thought,
have endeavoured to have saved themselves on shore by the.
help of their boat; but their firing of their guns for help, espe-
cially when they saw, as 1 imagined, my fiVe, filled me with
many thoughts. First.I imagined that, upon seeing my light,
they might have put themselves into their boat, and have en-
deavoured to make the shore; but that the sea going very
high, they might have been caBt away. Other times I ima-
gined that they might have lost their boat before, as might
be the case many ways; as particularly by the breaking of the
sea upon their ship, which many times obliges men to stave,
or take in pieces their boat; and sometimes to throw it over-
board with their own hands Other times I imagined they
had some other ship or ships in company, who, upon the sig-
nals of distress they had made, had taken them up, and car-
ried them off". Other while? I fancied they were all gone off
to sea in their bottf, and, being hurried away by the current
that I had been formerly in, were carried out into the great
ocean, where there was nothing but misery and perishing; and
that perhaps they might, by this time, think of starving, and
of being in a condition to eat one another.
As all these were hut conjectures at best, so, in the condi-
tion I was in, I oould do no more than look upon the misery
of the poor men, and pity them, which had still this good ef-
fect on my side, that it gave me more and more cause to give
thanks to God, -who had so happily and comfortably provided
for me in my desolate condition! and that of two ships' com-
panies, who were now cast away upon this part of the world,
not one life should be spared but mine. I learnt here again
to observe that it is very rare that the providence of God
casts us into any condition of life so low, or any misery so
great, but we may see something or other to be thankful for,
and may see others in worse circumstances than our own.
Such certainly was the case of these men, of whom I could
not so much as see room to suppose any of them were sav-
ed; nothing could make it rational, so much as to wish or ex-
pect that they did not all perish there, except the possibility
only of their being taken up by another ship in company: and
this was but mere possibility indeed) for 1 saw not the least
signal or appearance of any such thing.
1 cannot explain, by any possible energy of words, what a
strange longing or hankering of desires I felt in my soul upon
this sight, breaking out sometimes thus: ' O that there had
been but one or two, nay, or but one soul saved out of the
ship, to have escaped to me, that I might but have had one
companion, one fellow creature, to have spoken to me, ami
to have conversed with!' In all the time of my solitary life,
1 never felt so earnest so strong a desire after the society of

There are some secret moving springs in the affections,
which, when they are set agoing by some object in view, or
be it some object, though not in view, yet rendered present
to the mind by the power of imagination, whose motion car-
ries out the soul by its impetuosity to such violent, eager em-
liracings of the object, that the absence of it is insupportable.
Sncb. were these earnest vishings, that but one man had
been saved. O that it had been but one! I believe I repeated

and my desires were so moved by it that when 1 spoke the
words, my hands would clinch together, and my fingers press
the palms of my hands, that if I had any soft thing in my
hand it would have crushed it involuntarily; and my teeth in
my head would strike together, and set against one another
so strong, that for some time I could not part them again.

frbm what it should proceed; it was doubtless the effect of
ardent wishes, and of strong ideas formed in my mind, realiz-
ing the comfort which the conversation. of one of my fellow1
Christians would hive been to me.
But it w as not to be; either their fate, or mine, or both, for-
bade it: for till, the last year of my being on this island, I never
knew whether any were saved out of that ship or no; and had
only the affliction, some days after, to see the corpse of a
drowned boy come on shore at the end of the island, which
-was next the shipwreck. He had on no clothes but a sea-
roan's waistcoat, a pair of open-knee'd linen drawers, and a
blue linen shirt; but nothing to direct me so much as to guess
.what nation he was of. He had nothing in his pocket but two
pieces of eight, and a tohaoco-pipe; the last was to me often
times more value than the first.
It was now calm, and I had a great mind to venture out in
my boat to this wreck, not doubting but I might find some-
thing on board that might be useful to me; but that did not
altogether press me so much, as the possibility that there
might be yet some living creature on board whose life I might
not only save, but might, by saving that life, comfort my own
to the last degree; and this thought clung so to my heart,
that I could not be quiet, night nor day, but I must venture
out in my boat on board this wreck; and committing the rest
to God's providence, I thought the impression was so strong
upon mind, that it could not be resisted, that it must come
from some invisible direction, and that I should be wanting
to myself, if I did not go.
Under the power of this impression, I hastened back to my
castle, prepared every thing for my voyage, took a quantity
of bread, a great pot for fresh water, a compass to steer by,
a bottle of rum (for I had still a great deal of that left), a
basket full of raisins: and thus loading myself with every thing
necessary, I went down to my boat, got the water out of her,
and got her afloat, loaded all my cargo in her, and then went
home again for more. My second cargo was a great bag full
. of rice, the umbrella to set up over my head for shade, another
large pot full of fresh water, and about two dozen of my
small loaves, or barley cakes, more than before, with a bot-
tle of goat's milk, and a cheese; all which with great la-
bour anil sweat, I brought to my boat, and praying to <*od to
direct my voyage, I put out, and rowing or paddling the caf
i
noe along the shore, I came at last to the utmost point of the
island, on that side, viz N. E. And now I was to lanch out
into the ocean; and either to Tenture, or not to venture. I
looked on the rapid currents which ran constantly- on both
sides of the island, at a distance, and which were very terri-
ble to me, from the remembrance of the hazard I had been in
before, and my heart began to fail me; for I foresaw, that if I
was driven into either of those currents, I should be carried a
vast way out to sea, and perhaps out of my reach, or sight of
the island again; and that then, as my boat was but small, if
any little gale of wind should rise, I should be inevitably
lost
These thoughts ss oppressed my mind, that I began to give>
over my enterprise, and having hauled my boat into a little
creek on the shore, I stepped out, and sat me down upon a
little spot of rising ground, very pensive and anxious, between . .
fear and desire about my voyage; when, as I was musing, X
could perceive that the tide was turned and the flood came on,
upon which my going was for so many hours impracticable.
Upon this it presently occurred to me, that I should go up t»
the highest piece of ground 1 could find, and observe, if I
could, how the sets of the tide or currents lay, when the flood
came in, that I might judge .whether, If I was driven one way
out, I might not expect to be driven another way home, with
the same rapidness of the currents. This thought was no-
sooner in my head, but I cast my eye upon a little hill which.
sufficiently overlooked the sea both ways, and from whence
I had a clear view of the currents, or sets of the tide, and
which way I was to guide myself in my return. Here X
found that as the current of the ebb set out close by the south
point of the island, so the current of the flood set in close by
the shore of the north side; and that 1 had nothing to do but
to keep to the north of the island in my return, and I should
do well enough.
Encouraged with this observation, I resolved the next
morning to set out with the first of the tide; and reposing my-
self for that night in the casoe, under the great watch-coat I
mentioned. I laoched out. I made first a little out to sea,
full north, till I began to feel the benefit of the current, which
set eastward, and which carried me at a great rate, and yet
did not so hurry me as the southern side current had done
before, and so as to take from me the government of the boat*'
Tiut, having a strong steerage with my paddle, I went, I say, at
a great rate, directly for the wreck, and in less than two
hours I came up to it.
It was a dismal sight to look at: the ship, which by its
huMing was Spanish, stuck fast, jamhed in between two
rocks; all the stern and quarter of her was beaten to pieces
-with the sea; and as her forecastle, which stuck in the rocks,
had run on with great violence, her main-mast and fore-mast
were brought by the board, that is to say, broken short off;
hut her bowsprit was sound, and the head and bow appeared
firm. When I came close to her, a dog appeared upon her,
who, seeing me coming, yelped, and cried; and as soon as I
called him, jumped into the sea, to come to me; and I took
him into the boat, but found him almost dead for hunger and
thirst. I gave him a cake of my bread, and he eat like a
ravenous wolf, that had been starving a fortnight in the snow.
I then gave the poor creature some fresh water, with which,
if I would have let him, he would have burst himself.
After this I went on board. The first sightl met with waa
two men drowned in the cook-room, or forecastle ofthe ship,
with their arms fast about one another. I concluded, as is in-
deed probable, that when the ship struck, it being in a storm,
the sea broke so high, and so continually over her, that the
men were not able to bear it, and were strangled with the
constant lushing in of the water, as much as if they had been
Tmder water. Besides the dog there was nothing left in the
ship that had life, nor any goods that I could see but what
were spoiled by the water. There were some casks of li-
quor, whether wine or brandy, I knew not, which lay lower-
in the hold, and which the water being ebbed out, I could
see; but they were too big to meddle with. I saw several
chests, which 1 believed belonged to some of the seamen, and
I got two of them into the boat, without examining what wag
in them.
Had the stern of the ship been fixed, and the fore port
broken off, I am persuaded that I might have made a good
voyage: for, by what I found in these two chests, I had room
to suppose the ship had a great deal of wealth on board: and,
if I may guess by the course she steered, she must have been
bound from Buenos Ay res, or the Rio de la Plata, in the
south part of America, beyond the Brasils, to the llavanna,
in the Gulf of Mexico, and so pet haps to Spain. She had,
no doubt, a great treasure in her, but of no use at that time
to any body; and what became of the rest of her people, I then.
knew not.
I found, besides these chests, a little cask full of liquor, of
about twenty gallons, which I got into my boat with much dif-
ficulty. There were several muskets in a cabin, and a great
powder-horn, with about four pounds of powder in it: as for
the muskets I had no occasion for them, so I left them, but took
the powder-horn. I took a fire-shovel and tongs which I
wanted extremely; as also two little brass kettles, a copper
pot to make chocolate, and a gridiron, and with this cargo,
and the dog, I came away, the tide beginning to make home
again: and the same evening about an hour within night, I
reached the island again, weary and fatigued to the last de-
gree.
I reposed that night in the boat, and in the morning I re-
solved to harbour what I had gotten in my new cave, and not
to carry it home to my castle. After refreshing myself, I got
all my cargo on shore, and began to examine the particulars'.
The cask of liquor I found to be a kind of rum, but not such
as we had at the Urasils; and, in a word, not at all good. Hot
when I came to open the chests, I found several things which
I wanted: for example, I found in one a fine case of bottles, of
an extraordinary kind, and filled with cordial waters, fine and!
very good: the bottles held about three pints each, and were
tipped with silver- 1 found two pots of very good succades,
or sweetmeats, so fastened also on top, that the salt watce
had not hurt them; and two more of the same, which the wa-
ter had spoiled. I found some very good shins, which were
very welcome to me, and about a dozen and a half of white
linen handkerchiefs, and coloured neckcloths; the former
were also very welcome, being exceeding refreshing to
wipe my face in a hot day. Besides this, when I came to
the till in the chests, 1 found there three great bags of pieces
of eight, which held about eleven hundred pieces in all; ami
in one of them, wrapt up in a paper, six doubloons of gold, and
some small bars of wedges of gold; I suppose they might all
weigh near a pound.
The other chest I found had some clothes in it, but of little
value; but by the circumstances it must have belonged to the
gunner s mate, though there was no powder in it, but about
two pounds of glazed powder, in three 'small flasks, kept, 1
suppose, for charging their fowling-pieces on occasion. Upon
the whole I got very little by this voyage, that was of much
use to me; for, as to the money, I had no manner of occasion
for it, it was to me as the dirt under my feet, and I would
have given it all for three or four pair of English shoes and
stockings which were things I greatly wanted, but had not
had on my feet now for many years. I had, indeed, gotten
two pair of shoes now, which I (ook off the feet of the two
drowned men whom I saw in the wreck; and I found two pair
more in one of the chests, whioh were very welcome to me;
but they were not like our English shoes, either for ease or
service, being rather what we call pumps than shoes. I found
in this seaman's chest about fifty pieces of eight in royals, but
no gold: I suppose this belonged to a poorer man than the
other, which seemed to belong to some officer.
Well, however, 1 lugged this money home to my cave, and
laid it up, as I had done that before, which 1 brought from
our own ship; but it was a great pity, as I said, that the other
part of the ship had not come to my share, for I am satisfied
I might have loaded my canoe several times over with mo-
ney, which, if I bad ever escaped to England, would have lien
here safe enough till I might have come again and fetched it.
Having now brought all my things on shore, and secured
them, I -went back to my boat and rowed or paddled her
along the shore to her old harbour, where I laid her up, and
made the best of my way to my old habitation, where I found
every thing safe and quiet; so I began to repose myself, live
after my old fashion, and take care of my family affairs; and
for a while I lived easy enough, only that I was more vigilant
than I used to be, looked out oftener, and did not go abroad
so much; and if at any time I did stir with any freedom, it
was always to the east part of the island, where I was pretty
well satisfied the savages never came, and where I could go
without so many precautious, and such a load of arms and
ammunition as I always carried with me, if I went the other
way •
1 lived in this condition near two years more; but my un-
lucky head, that was always to let me know it was born to
make my body miserable, was all those two years filled with
projects and designs, how, if it were possible, I might get
away from this island; for sometimes 1 was for making another -
Voyage to the wreck, though my reason told me, that there
. P
-was nothing left there worth the hazard of my voyage; some-
times for a ramble one way, sometimes another; and I be-
lieve verily, if I had had the boat that I went from Sallee tn, I
should have ventured to sea, bound any where, I knew not
whither.
I have been, in all my circumstances, a memento to those
-who are touched vith that general plague of mankind, whence,
for aught I know, one half of their miseries flow; I mean,
that of not being satisfied with the station wherein God and
nature hath placed them For, not to look back upon my
primitive condition, and the excellent advice of my father, the
opposition to which was, as I may call it, my original sin, my
subsequent mistakes of the same kind have been the
means of my coming into this miserable condition; for had
that Providence, which so happily had seated me at the Bra-
sils, as a planter, blessed me with confined desires, and could
I have been contented to have gone on gradually, I might
have been by this time, I mean of the time of my being in this
island, one of the most considerable planters in the Urasiis; nay,
I am persuaded that, by the improvements I had made in that
little time I lived there and the increase I should probably
have made, if I had staid, I might have been worth a hundred
thousand moidores. And what business had I to leave a set-
tle:! fortune, a well stocked plantation, improving and increas-
ing, to turn supercargo to Guinea to fetch Vegroes, wWfen pa-
tience and time would have so increased our stock at home,
that we could have bought them at our own doors, from those
whose business it was to fetch them? and though it had cost
us something more, yet the difference of that price was by no
means w orth saving, at so great a hazard
But as this is ordinarily the fate of young heads, so reflec-
tion upon the folly of it, is as ordinarily the exercise of more
years, or of the dear-bought experience of time; and so it was
with me now: and yet so deep had the mistake taken root
in my temper, that I could not satisfy myself in my station,
but was continually poring upon the means and possibility of
my escape from this place. And that I may, with the great-
er pleasure to the reader, bring on the remaining part of my
story, it may not be improper to give some account of my first
conceptions on the subect of this foolish scheme for my es-
cape, and how and upon what foundation I acted.
I Am now to he supposed to be retired into my castle, af.
ter mv late voyage to the wreck, my frigate laid up and se-
cured under water as usual, and my condition restored to
•what it was before I had more wealth, indeed, than I had
before, but was not at all the richer, for I had no more use
for it than the Indians of Peru had before the Spaniards came
thither.
It was one of the nights, in the rainy season, in March, the
four-and-twentieth year of my first setting foot in this island of
solitariness, I was lying in my bed, or hammock, awake, very
well in health, had no pain, no distemper, no uneasiness of
body, no, nor any nneasiness of mind more than ordi-
nary; but could by no means close my eyes; that is, so as
t» sleep, no not a wink all night long, otherwise than as fol-
lows?
It is as impossible as needless to set down the innumerable
crowd of thoughts that whirled through that great thorough-
fare of the brain, the memory, in this night's time: I ran
over the whole history of my life in miniature, or by abridg-
ment, as I may call it, to my coming to this island; and also
of that part of my life since I came to this island. In my re-
flections upon the state of my case, since I came on shore
on this island, I was comparing the happy posture of my af-
fairs, in the first years of my habitation here, to that course of
anxiety, fear, and care, which I had lived in ever since I had
seen the print of a foot in the sand. Not that I did not be-
lieve the savages had frequented the island even all the while,
and might have been several hundreds of them at times on
shore there; bot as I had never known it, and was incapable
of any apprehensions about it, my satisfaction was perfect,
though my danger was the same; and I was as happy in not
knowing my danger, as if I had never really been exposed to
it. This furnished my thoughts with many very profitable
reflections, and particularly this one, How infinitely good that
Providence is. which has settled in its government of man-
kind such narrow bounds to his sight and knowledge of
things; and though he walks in the midst of so many thousand
dangers, the sight of which, if discovered to him would dis-
tract his mind, and sink his spirits, he is kept serene and
cai.n, by having the events of thingafhid from hise yes, and
knowing nothing of the dangers which surround him.
After these thoughts had for some time entertained me, I
came to reflect seriously upon the real danger I had been in
for so. many years in this very island; and how I had walked
about in the greatest security, and with all possible tran-
quillity, even when perhaps nothing but the brow of a hill,
a great tree, or the casual approach of night, had been be-
tween me and the worst kind of destruction; viz. that of fal-
ling into the hands of cannibals and savages, who would-have
seized on me with the same view as I did on a|goat or a turtle,
and have thought it no more a crime to kill and devour me,
than I did of a pigeon or a curlien: I should unjustly slander
myself, ifl should say I was not sincerely thankfid to my great
Preserver, to whose singular protection I acknowledged, with
great humility. that all these unknown deliverances were due,
and without which I should inevitably have fallen into their
merciless hands-
When these thoughts were over, my head was for some
time taken up in considering the nature of these wretched
,Creatures, I mean, the savages; and how it came to pass in the
world, that the wise Governor of all things should give op any
of his creatures to such inhumanity, nay, to something so
much below even brutality itself. as to devour its own kind.
But as this ended in some (at that time fruitless) specula-
tions, it occurred to me to inquire what part of the world
these wretches lived in; how far off the coast was from
whence they came; what thev ventured over »o far from
home for; what kind of boats they had; and why I might
not order myself, and my business so, that I might be
as able to go over thither, as they were to come to me.
I never so much as troubled myself to consider what I
should do with myself when I came thither; what should be-
come of me, if I fell into the hands of the savages; or how I
should escape from them, if they attempted me; no, nor so
much as how it was possible for me to reach the coast, and
not be attempted by some one or other of them, without any
possibility of delivering myself, and if I should not fall into
their hands, what I should do for provision, or whither I
should bend my course, none of these thoughts, 1 say, so much
as came in my way; but my mind was wholly bent upon the
notion of my passing over in my boat to the main land. I
looked back upon my present condition, as the moot misera-
ble that could possibly be; thatlwus not able to throw my.
self into any thing but death that could be called worse; thatj
if I reached the shore of the main, I might perhaps meet
.with relief. or I might coast along as I did on the shore of
Africa, till 1 came to some inhabited country, and where I
might find some relief; and after all, perhaps I might fall in
with some Christian ship that might take me in, and if the
worst came to the worst I could but die, which would put an
end to all these miseries at once. Pray note, all this was the
fruit of a disturbed mind, an impatient temper, made, as it
were, desperate by the long continuance of my troubles, and
the disappointments I had met with in the wreck I had been on
hoard of, and where I had been so near the obtaining what I
so earnestly longed for, viz. somebody to speak to, and to learn
some knowledge from, of the place where I was, and of the
probable means of my deliverance; I say, I was agitated
wholly by these thoughts. All my calm of mind, in my re-
signation to Providence, and waiting the issue of the disposi-
tions of Heaven, seemed to be suspended; and I had, as it
were, no power to turn my thoughts to any thing, hut the
project of a voyage to the main, which came upon me with
such force, and such an Impetuosity of desire, that it was not
to be resisted.
When this had agitated my thoughts, for two hours or
more, with such violence, that it set my very blood into a
ferment. and my pulse beat as high as if I had been in a fe-
ver, merely with the extraordinary fervour of my mind about
it; nature, as if I had been fatigued and exhausted with the
very thought of it, threw me into a sound sleep. One would
have thought I should have dreamed of it; but I did not, nor
of any thing relating to ic: but I 'dreamed that as 1 was going
out in the morning as usual, from my castle, I saw upon the
shore two canoes, and eleven savages coming to land, and
that they brought with them another savage, whom they
were going to kill, in order to eat him, when, on a sudden,
the savage that they were going to kill, jumped away, and
ran for his life: then I thought in my sleep, that he came run-
ning into my little thick grove, before my fortification, to
hide himself; and that 1 seeing him alone, and not perceiving
that the others sought him that way, showed myself to him,
and smiling upon him, encouraged him: that he kneeled down
to me seeming to pray to me to assist him; upon which I
showed him my ladder, made him go upon it and carried him
into my cave, and he became my servant; and that as soon as I
P2
liad gotten this man. 1 said to myself, ' Now I may certainly
venture to the main land: for this fellow will serve me as a pilot,
and will tell me what to do. and whither to go for provisions,
and whither not to go for fear of being devoured, what places to
venture into, and what to escape.' I waked with this thought,
and was undersuch inexpressible impressions of joy at the
prospect of mv escape in my dream, that the disappointments
which I felt upon coming to myself, and finding it was no more
than a dream, were equally extravagant the other way, and
threw me into a very great dejection of spirit.
Upon this, however, I made this conclusion, that my only
way to go about an attempt for an escape, was if possible, to
get a savage in my possession and, if possible, it should be
one of their prisoners, whom they had condemned to be eat-
en, and should bring hither to kill; but these thoughts still
were attended with this difficulty, that it was impossible to
effect this without attacking a whole caravan of them, and kil-
ling them all; and this was not only a very desperate attempt,
and might miscarry, but, on the other hand, I had greatly scru-
pled the lawfulness of it to me, and my heart trembled at
the thoughts of shedding so much blood, though it was for
my deliverance. I need not repeat the arguments which oc-
curred to me against this, they being the same mentioned be-
fore, but though I had other reasons to offer now; viz. that
those men were enemies to my life, and would devour me, if
they could; that it was self-preservation, in the highest degree
to deliver myself from this death of a life, and was acting in.
my own defence, as much as if they were actually assaulting
me, and the like, I say, though these things argued for it, yet
the thoughts of shedding buman blood for my deliverance,
were very terrible to me, and such its I could by no means re-
concile myself to a great while.
However, at last, after many secret disputes with myself,
and after great perplexities about it (lor all these arguments
one way and another, struggled in my head a long time), the
eager prevailing desire of deliverance at length mastered all
the rest, and I resolved, if possible, to get one of these savages
into my hands, cost what it would. My next thing then was
to contrive how to do it; and this indeed was Very difficult to
resolve or.: but as I could pitch upon no probable means for it,
so I resolved to put myself upon the watch, to see them when
they came on shore, and leave the rest to the event, taking
fuch measures as the opportunity should present, let be what
would be
With these resolutions in my thoughts, I set myself upon.
the scout, as often as possible, and indeed so often, ttll I was
heartily tired of it; for it was above a year and a half that I
waited, and for a great part of that time went out to the west
end, and to the south-west corner of the island, almost every
day, to see the canoes but none appeared. This was very
discouraging, and began to trouble me much: though I cannot
say that it did in this case, as it had done some time before
that, viz. wear off the edge of my desire to the thing, but the'
longer it seemed to be delayed, the more eager.I was for it.
In a word, I was not at first more careful to shun the sight of
these savages, and avoid being seen by them, than I was now
eager to be upon them
Besides, I fancied myself able to manage one, nay. two ot
or three savages, if I had them, so as to make them eutirely
slaves to me, to do whateverl should direct them, and to pre-
vent their being able at any time to do me any hurt It was
a great while that I pleased myself with this affair: but nothing
still presented; all my fancies and schemes came to nothmg,
for no savages came near me for a great while.
About a year and a halt after I had entertained these no-
tions, and, by long musing, had, as it were, resolved them all
into nothing, for want of an occasion to put them into execu-
tion, I was surprized one morning early, with seeing no less
than five canoes, all on shore together, on my side the island,
and the people who belonged to them all landed and out of
my sight. The number of them broke all my measures; for
seeing so many, and knowing thnt they always came four or six',
or sometimes more, in a boat, I could not tell what to think of
it, or how to take my measures to at.rick twenty or thirtv men
single-handed; so I lay still in my castle, perplexed and dis-
comforted. However, I put myself into all the same posrures
for an attack, that I had formerly provided, and was just rea-
dy for action if any thing had presented. Having waited a
good while, listening to hear if they made any noise,-at length,
being very impatient, I set my guns at the foot of my ladder,
and clambered up to the top of the hill by my two stages, as
ysual. standing so however, that my head did not appear
above the hill; so that they could not perceive me, by any
means. Here 1 observed, by the help of my perspective
glass, that they were no less than thirty in number, that they
had a fire kindled, and that they had meat dressed how they
cooked it, that I knew not, or what it was; but they wire all
dancing, in 1 know not how many barbarous gestures and fi-
gures, their own way, round the fire
While I was thus looking on them, I perceived by my
perspective, two miserable wretches dragged from the boats,
-where, it seems, they were laid by, and were now brought
out for the slaughter I perceived one of them immediately
fell, being knocked down, I suppose, with a club or woodea
tfwnrd for that was their way; and two or three others were
at work immediately, cutting him open for theii' cookery,
-while the other victim was left standing by himself, till they
should be ready for him. ' In that very moment this poor
wretch seeing himself a little at liberty, nature inspired him
with hopes of life, and he started away from them, and ran
-willi incredible swiftness along the sands, directly towards me,
I mean, toward that part of the coast where my habitation
was.
I was dreadfully frighted (that I must acknowledge), when
I perceived him to run nn way; and especially when, as I
thought, 1 saw him pursued by the whole body; and now I ex*
pected that part of my dream was coming to pass, and that he
would certainly take shelter in my grove; but I could not de-
pend, by any means, upon my dream for the rest of it, viz.
that the other savages would not pursue him thither, and find
him there.- However. I kept my station, and my spirits be-
gat to recover, when I found that there were nut above three
men that followed him; and still more was I encouraged,
when I found that he outstripped them exceedingly in run-
ning, and gamed ground of them, so that if he could but hold
it out for half an hour, I saw easily he would fairly get away
from them all.
There was between them and my castle the creek, which
I mentioned often at the first part of my story, when I land-
ed my cargoes out of the ship, and this I knew he must ne-
cessarily swim over, or the poor wretch would be taken there:
but when the savage escaping came thither, he made noth-
mg of it, though the tide was then up, but plunging in, swam.
through in about thirty strokes, or thereabouts. landed, and
ran on with exceeding stivngth and swiftness. When the
three pursuers came to the creek, I found that two of them
could swim, but that the third could not, and that he, standing
on the other side, looked at the others, but went no farther;
and soon after went softly back again, which, as it happened,
Has very well for hirn in the main.
I observed that the two who swam, were yet more than
twice as longswimmiog over the creek, than the fellow was
that fled from them. It came now very warmly upon my
thoughts, and indeed irresistibly, that now was my time to get
me a servant, and perhaps a companion or assistant, and that
I was called plainly, by Providence, to save this poor crea-
ture's life. I immediately got down the ladders, with all
possible expedition, fetched my two guns, for they were both
at the foot of the ladders, as I observed above; and getting up
again with the same haste to the top of the hill, I crossed to-
wards the sea; and having a very short cut, and all down hill,
clapped myself in the way, between the pursuers and the
pursued, hollowing aloud to him that fled, who, looking back,
-was at firs* perhaps as much frighted at me, as at them; but
I beckoned with my hand to him to come back, and, in the
mean time, I slowly advanced towards the two that followed;
then rushing at once upon the foremost, I knocked him down
with the stuck of my piece: I was loath to fire, because I
would not have the rest hear. though at that distance it would
not have been easily heard; and being out of sight of ihe
smoke too, they would not have easily known what to make
of it. Having knocked this fellow down, the other who pur-
sued him stopped, as if he had been frightened, and I ad-
vanced apace towards him; but as I came nearer, I perceived
presently he had a bow and arrow, and was fitting it to shoot-
at roe; so I was then necessitated to shoot at him first, wl,:ch
I did, and killed him at the first shot. The poor savage who
fled, but had stopped, though he saw both his enemies falien,
and killed (as he thought), yet was so frighted with the lire
and noise of my piece, that he stooil stock-still, and neither
came forward, nor went backward, though he seemed rather
inclined to fly still, than to come on I hollowed again to him,
and made signs lo come forward, which he easily understood,
and came a little way, then stopped again, and then a little
farther, and stopped again, and I could then perceive that he
stood trembling, as if he had been taken prisoner. and had
just been to be killed, as his two enemies were I beckoned
him again to come to me, and gave him all the signs of en-
cooragement that I ciinlt) think of; and he came nearer and
nearer, kneeling down ever) ten or twelve steps in token of
acknowledgement tor saving his life. I smiled at him, and
looked pleasantly, and beckoned him to come still nearer.
At length he came close to me, and then he kneeled di.wa
again, kissed the ground, and laid his head upon the ground,
and taking me by the foot, set mj foot upon his head: this, it
seems, was in token of swearing to be my slave for ever X
took him up, and made much of him, and encouraged him all!
Gould But there was more v/ork to do yel; for I perceived the
savage whom I had knocked down j»as not killed, but stunned
-with the blow, and began to com; to himself. So I pointed to
him, and showing him the savage, that he was not'dead; upon
this he spoke someWoi ds to me, and though I could not under-
staid them, yet I thought they were pleasant to hear, for they
-were the first sound of a1 man's voice, that I had heard, my
own excepted, for above five and-twenty years. But there
Was no time for such reflections now. The savage who was
knocked down recovered himself so far as to sit upon the.
ground; and I perceived that my savage begat, to be afraid: but
ivhei. I saw that, I presented my other piece at the man as if
I would shoot him; upon this my savage, fer so loll him now,
made a motion to me to lend him my sword, which hung
naked in a belt by my side; so I did. He no sooner had it but
he runs to his enemy, and, at one ' blow, cut offhis head as
Cleverly, no executioner in Germany could have done it
soulier or better; which 11 bought very strange for one, who,
I had reason to believe. never saw a sword in his life before,
except their own wooden swords. However, it seems, as I
learned afterwards, they make iheir wooden swords so 9harp,
so heavy, aid the wood is so hard, that they will cut off heads
even with them, ay, and arms, and that at one blow too.
When he had done this, he comes laughing to me in sign of
trinmph, and brought me the sword again, and with abun-
dance of gestures, which I did not understand, laid it down,
with the head of the savage that he had killed, just before me.
But that which astonished him most was to know how 1 had
killed the other Indian so far off; so pointing to bin, he made
signs to me to let him go to him; so I bade him go, as well as
I could. When he came to him, he stood like one amazed,
lookmg at him; turned him first on one side, then on the other;
•ooked at the wound the bullet had made, wliioh, it seem\
was just in his breast, where it had made a hole, and no great
quantity of blood had followed, hut he had bled inwardly. fur he
was quite dead Then he took up his bow and arrows, and
came back, so I turned to go away, and beckoned to him to fol-
low me, makmgsigns to him that more might come after them.
Upon this, he signed to me that he should bury them with
sand, that they might uot be seen by the rest, if they follow-
ed, and so I made signs, again to him to do so: he fell to work, -
and, in an instant, he scraped a hole in the sand wiih his
hands. big enough to bury the first in, and then dragged him
into it, and covered him; and did so also, by the other I be-
lieve he had buried them both in a quarter of an hour; then
calling him away, I carried him not to my castle, but quite
away to my eave, on the farther part of the island: so I did.
not let my dream come to pass in that part; viz. that he come;
into my grove for shelter.
Here 1 gave him bread, and a bunch of raisins to eat, and
tk draught of water, which I found he was indeed in great dis-
tress for by his running. and having refreshed him, I made
signs for him to go lie down and sleep, pointing to a place
.where I had laid a great parcel of rice straw, and a blanket
upon it, which I used to sleep upon myself sometimes: so the
j>oor creature lay down, and went to sleep.
He was a comely, handsome fellow; perfectly well made,
with straight, long limbs, not too large; tall, and well shaped;
and, as I reckon, about twenty-six years of age. He had a
very good countenance. not a fierce and surly aspect, but
seemed to have something very manly in his face, and yet he
had all the sweetness and softness of an European in his coun-
tenance too, especially when he smiled. His hair was long and
black, not curled like wool; his forehead very high, and large,
and a great vivacity and sparkling sharpness in his ev es. The
colour of his skin was not quite black, but very tawny, and let
not of an ugly, yellow, nauseous tawny, as the Brasilians, and
Virginians, and other natives of America are, but of a bright
kind of a dun olive colour, that had in it so'methingvery agree-
able, though not very easy to describe. His face was round,
and plump, his nose small, not flat like the negroes, a very
good mouth, thin lips, and his teeth fine, well set, and white
a* ivory After he had slumbered, rather than slept, about
half an hour; he waked again, and conies out of the cave to
me, fov I had been milking my goats which I had in the enclp.
sure just by. When lie espied me, lie came running to me,
laying himself down upon the ground with all the possible
signs of a humble thankful disposition, making many antio.
gestures to show it. At last he lays his head flat upon the
ground, close to my foot, and sets my other foot upon his
head, as he had done before; and after this, made all the
signs to me of subjection, servitude, and submission imagina-
ble. to let me know how much he would serve me as long as
he lived. I'understood him in many things, and let him
know I was very well pleased with him. In a little time I be-
gan to speak to him, and teach him to speak to me; and firat
I made him know his name should be Friday, which was (he
da' I saved his life; and I called him so for the memory of
the time: I likewise taught him to say,'Master,'and then
let hini know that was tc be my nam^j; 1 likewise taught
him to sav, ' Yes'and 'No,' and to kijosc the meaning of
them. I gave him some milk in an earthed pot, and let him
see me drmk it before him, ami sop my bread in it; and I
gave him a cake of bread to do the like; which he quickly
complied with, and made signs that it was very good for
him.
I kept there with him all that night; but as soon as it was
dni, 1 beckoned him to come with me, and let him know I
would give him some clothes; at which he seemed very glad,
for he was stark naked. As we went by the place where we
had buried the two men, he pointed exactly to the spot, and
showed me the marks that he had made to find them again,
making signs to me that we should dig them up again, and
eat them: at this I appeared very angry, expressed my abhor-
rence of it, made as if 1 would vomit at the thoughts of it, and
beckoned with my hand to him to come away, which he did
immediately, with great submission. I then led him up to the
top of the hill to sec if his enemies were gone, and pulling
out my glass, I looked, and saw plainly the place where they
h:ul been, but no appearance of them, or of their canoes; so
that it was plain that they were gone, and had left their two
comrades behmd them, without any search after them.
Hut I was not content with this discovery; hut, having now
more courage, and consequently more curiosity, 1 took my
man Friday with me, giving him the swtird in his hand, with
the bow and arrows at his back, which I found he could use
very dextorouslv, making him carry one gun for me, and
Fridays Submission
"\
t two for myself, and away we marched to the place where
these creatures had been; for I had a mind now to get some
fuller intelligence of them. When I came to the place, my
Very blood ran chill in my veins, and my heart sunk within
me at the horror of the spectacle. Indeed it was a dreadful
sight, at least it was so to me, though Friday made nothing
of it: the place was covered witli human bones, the ground
dyed with the blood, great pieces of flesh left here and there,
half eaten, mangled, and scorched; and, in short, all the tokens
of the trinmphant feast the* had been making there, after a
victory over the enemies. I saw three skulls, five hands, and
the bones of three or four legs and feet, and abundance of other
parts of the bodies: and Friday, by his signs, made me under-
stand, that they brought over four prisoners to feast upon: that
three of them were eaten up, and that he pointing to himself
was the fourth; that there had been a great battle between,
them and their next king, whose subject, it seems, he had
been one of; and that they had taken a great number of pri-
soners, all which were carried to several places by those that
had taken them in the fight, in order to feast upon them,as
was done here by these wretches upon those they brought
hither.
I caused Friday to gather all the skulls, bones, flesh, and
whatever remained, and lay them together on a heap, and
make a great fire upon it, and burn them all to ashes. 1
found Friday had still a hankering stomach after some of the
flesh, and was still a cannibal in his nature; but I discovered
so much abhorrence at the very thoughts of it, and at the
least appearance of it, that he durst not discover it; for I had
by some means, let him know, that I would kill him if he of-
fered it.
When we had done this, we came back to our castle, and
there I fell to work for my man Friday. And first of all, {
gave him a pair of linen drawers, which I had out of the poor
gunner's chest, I mentioned, and which I found in the wreck;
and which, with a little alteration, fitted him very well: then
I made him a jerkin of goat's skin, as well as my skill would
allow, and I was now grown a tolerable good tailor; and I gave
him a cap, which I had made of hare-skin, very convenient,
and fashionable enough: and thus he was dressed, for the pre-
sent, tolerably well; and mighty well pleased was he to see
hjmsejf almost as well clothed as his master. It is true, he
« J
went awkwardly in these things at first; wearing the drawer?
Was very awkwaid to him; and the sleeves of the waisicoat
galled his shoulder and the inside of his arms: but a little eas-
ing, them where he complained they hurt him, and using
himself to them, at length he took to them very well.
The next day after 1 came home to my hutch with him, I
iiegan to consider where I should lodge him, and that I might
do well for him, and yet be perfectly easy myself, I made a little
tent for him, in the vacant place netween my two fortifica-
tions, in the inside of the last, and the outside of the first: and
as there was a door or entrance there into my cave, I made
a formal framed door-case, and a door to it of boards, mm] set
it up in the passage, a little within the entrance; and causing
the door to open on the inside, 1 barred it up in the night,
vking in my ladders too, so thai Friday oould no way come
at me in the inside of my innermost wall, without making so
much noise in getting over, that it must needs awaken me; for
my first wall had now a complete roof over it of long poles,
covering all my tent, and leaning up to the side of the hill,
Which was again laid cross with small sticks instead of laths,
and then thatched over a great thickness with the rice straw,
-winch was strong like reeds; and at the hule or place which
Ivti" left to go in or out by the ladder, I had placed a kind of
trap-door, which, if it had been attempted on the outside,
Would not have opened at all, but would have fallen down,
and made a great noise: and as to weapons, I took them all in
to, my side every night.
But I needed none of all this precaution; for never man
iiad a more faithful, loving, sincere servant than Friday was to
me, without passion, sullenuess, or designs; perfectly obliged
and engaged: his very affections were tied to me, like those
of a child to afatlier; and I dare say, he would have sacrificed
his life for the saving mine, upon any occasion whatsoever.
The many testimonies he gave me of this, put it out of doubt;
and soon convinced me, that I needed to use no precautions
as to my safety on his account.
This frequently gave me occasion to observe, and that with
Wonder, that, however it had pleased God in his providence,
and in the government of the works of his hands, to take from
so great a part of the world of his creatures, the best uses to
winch their faculties, and the powers of t heir souls, are adapt-
•I; yet that he has bestowed upon them the same powers,
the same reason, the same affections, the same sentiments of
kindness and obligation, the same passions and resentments
of wrongs, the same sense of gratitude, sincerity, fidelity. and
ail the capacities of domg good, and receiving good, that he
has given to us; and; and that when he pleases to offer them'
occasions of exerting these, they are as ready, nay, more rea-
dy to apply them to the right uses for which they were be-
stowed, than we are. And this made me very melancholy
sometimes, in reflecting, as the several occasions presented,
how mean a use we make of all these, .even though we have
these powers enlightened by the great lamp of instruction,
the Spirit of God, and by the knowledge of his word, added to
our understanding, and why it has pleased God to hide the like
saving knowledge from so many millions of souls, who, if I
might judge by this poor savage, would make a much belief
use of it than we did. i
From hence I sometimes was led too far to invade the sove-
reignty of Providence, and as it were, arraign the justice of so
arbitrary a disposition of things that should hide that light
from some, and reveal it to others, and yet expect a like du-
ty from both. But I shut it up, and checked my thoughts
with this conclusion; first, That we did not know by what
light and law these would be condemned; but that as God was.
necessarily, and by the nature of his being, infinitely holy
and just so it could not be, but that if these creatures were all
sentenced to absence from himself, it was on account of sin-
ning against that light, which, as the scripture says. was a
law to themselves, and by such rules, as their consciences
would acknowledge to be just, though the foundation was not
discovered to us: and, secondly, That still as we are all 'he
clay in the hand of the potter, no vessel could say to hinjj
' Why hast thou formed me thus?'
But to return to my new companion: I was greatly delight-
ed with him and made it my business to teach him every
thing that was proper to make him useful, handy, and helpful;
but especially to make him speak and understand me when
I spake; and he was the uptest scholar that ever was, and par-
ticularly was so merry, so constantly diligent and so pleased
when he could but understand me, or make me understand
him, that it was very pleasant to me to talk to him. And
now my life began to be so easy, that I began to say to my-
sjelf, that could I but have been safe from more savages, I
tared dot if I was never to remove from the place where I
lived.
After I had been two or three days.returned to my castle,
1 thought, that, in order to bring Friday off from his horrid
way of feeding, and from the relish of a cannibal's stomach, I
ought to let him taste other flesh So I took him out with
me one morning to the woods. I went, indeed, intending to
kill a kid out of my own flock, and bring it home and dress it:
hut as I was going, I saw a she.goat, lying down in the shade,
and two young kids sitting by her. I catched hold of Friday;
'Hold,' said I ' stand still;' and made signs to him not to stir:
immediately I presented my piece, shot, and killed one of the
4ids The poor creature who had, at a distance, indeed,
seen me kill the savage, his enemy, but did not know, nor
could imagine how it was done, was sensibly surprised, trem-
lied, and shook, and looked so amazed, that 1 thought he
Would have sunk down. He did not see the kid I had shot
at, nor perceive I had killed it, but ripped up his waistcoat
to feel if he was not wounded; and, as I found, presently
thought I was resolved to kill him; for he came and kneeled
dewn to me, and, embracing my knees, said a great many
things I did not understand, but I could easily see, that his
meaning was to pray me not to kill him.
I sooh found a way to convince him, that I would do him
no harm; and taking him up by the hand, laughed at him,
and pointing to the kid which I had killed, beckoned to him
to run and fetch it, which he didj and while he was wonder-
ing and looking to see how the creature was killed, I loaded
my gun again, and by-and-by I saw a great fowl, like
a hswk, sit upon a tree within shot, so, to let Friday un-
derstand a little what I would do, I called him to me again,
pomting at the fowl, which was indeed a parrot, though I
thought it had been a hawk; I say pointing to the par-
rot, and to my gun, and to the ground under the parrot,
to let him see I would make him fall, I made him understand
thai I Would shoot and kill that bird: accordingly I tired and
bade him look, and immediately he saw the parrot fall. He
stood like one frighted again, notwithstanding all that I had
said to him; and I found he was the more amazed, because he
did not see me put any thing into the gun; but thought there
must be some wonderful fund of death and destruction in
that thmg, able to kill man, beast, bird, or any thing near oj.-
far off; for the astonishment this created in him was such as
could not wear off for a long time; and 1 believe/ if I would
have let him, he would have worshipped me and my gun: as
for the gun itself, he would not so much as touch it for seve-
ral days after; but would speak to it, and talk to it, as if it had
answered him, when lie was by himself, which, as I afterwards
learned was to desire it not to kill him.
Well, after his astonishment was a little over at this, I
pointed to him to run and fetch the bird I had shot, which he
did, but staid some time, for the parrot, not being quite dead,
was fluttered a good way oif from the place where she fell.
However, he found her, took her up, and brought her to
me: and as 1 had perceived his ignorance about the gun be-
fore, I took this advantage to charge the gun again, and not
let him see me do it, that I might be ready for any othei»
mark that might present; but nothing more offered at that
time. So I brought home the kid, and the same evening
I took the skin oil', and cut it out as well as I could; and
having a pot for that purpose, I boiled or stewed some of
the flesh, and made some very good broth after I had begun
to eat some, I gave some to my man, who seemed very glad of
it, and liked it very well, but that which was strangest to him
was to see me eat salt with it- He made a sign to me that
the salt was not good to eat, and putting a little into his own
mouth, he seemed to nauseate it, and would spit and sputter at
it. washing his mouth with fresh water after it; on the other
hand, I took some meat in my mouth without salt, and I pre-
tended to spit and sputter for want of salt, as fast is he had
done at the salt; but it would not do, he would never care for
salt with meat .or in his broth, at least, not a gi eat while, and
then hut a very little
Having thus fed him with boiled meat and broth, I was re-
solved to feast him the next day with roasting a piece of the
kid: this I did by hanging it before the fire in a string, as I had
seen many people do in England, setting two poles up, one oni
eaeh side the fire, and one cross on the top, and tying the
string to the cross stick, letting the meat turn continually.
This Friday admired very much: but when he came to taste
the flesh, he took so many ways to tell me how well he liked
it, that I could not but understand him: and, at last,' he told
me he would never cat man's flesh any more, which 1 was
very glad to hear.
The next clay I set him to work to beating some corn out,
and sifting it in the manner I used to do, as I observed before;
and he soon understood how to do it as well as I, especially
after he had seen what the meaning of it was, and that it was
to make bread of, for after that I let him see me make
my breads and bake it too: and in a little time Friday
-was able to do all the work for me, as "well as I could do it
myself.
I began to consider that having two mouths to feed instead
of one, I must provide more ground for my harvest, and plant
h larger quantity of corn than I used to do; so I marked out
a larger piece of land, and began the fence in the same man-
ner as before, in which Friday not only worked very willingly
and very hard, but did it very cheerfully, and I told him wbat
it was for, that it was for corn to make more bread, because
lie was now with me, and that I might have enough for him
and myself too. He appeared very sensible of that part, and
let me know that he thought 1 had much more labour upon
me on his account, than 1 had for myself, and that he would
Vork the harder for me, if I would tell him what to do.
This was the pleasantest year of all theMife I led in this
place. Friday began to talk pretty well, and understand the
names of almost every thing I had occasion to call for, and of
every place I had to send him to, and talk a great deal to
me; so that, in short, 1 began now to have some use for
my tongue again, which indeed I had very little occasion for
before; that is too say, about speech. Besides the pleasure of
talking to him, I had a singular satisfaction in the fellow him-
self: his simple, unfeigned honesty appeared to me more and
more every day, and I began really to love the creature; and
on his side, I believe he loved me more than it was possible
for him ever to love any thing before.
I had a mind once to try if he had any hankering inclination
to his own country again; and having learned him English so
.well, that he could answer me almost any questions, 1 asked
him whether the nation that he belonged to never conquered
in battle At which he smiled, and said, 'Yes, yes; we al-
™> fight the betteiv' that is, he meant, always gel the better
in fight- and so we began the following discourse. 'You al-
wnvs fight the better!' said I: ' How came you to be taken
prisoner then, Friday?'
Tritiny. My nation beat jnuch for all that,
J8£ -
Master. How teat? If your nation beat them, how came
yon to be taken? .
Friday. They more than my nation in the plaoe where me
was: they take one, two, three, and me. my nation Over-
heat them in yonder place, where me no was: there my nation
take one, two, great thousand.
Master. But why did not your side recover you from the-
hands of your enemies then?
Fritlay. They ran one, two, three, and me, and make
go in the canoe; my nation have no canoe that time.
Mclster. Well, Friday, and what does your nation do with
the men they take? Do they carry them away, and eat them,
as these did?
Friday. Yes, my nation eat mans too, eat all up.
Matter. Where do they carry them?
Friday. Go to other place where they think.
Master. Do they come hither?
Friday. Yes, yes, they come hither; come other else place.
Master. Have you been here with them?
Friday. Yes, I been here. (Points to the N. W. side of
the island, which it seems was their side.)
By this I understood that my man Friday had formerly
been among the savages, who used to come on shore, on the
farther part of the island, on the said man-eating occasions
that he was now brought for; and some time after, when I
took courage to carry him to that side, being the same I
formerly mentioned, he presently knew the place, and told
me, he was there once when they eat up twenty men, two
women, and one child: he could not tell twenty in English,
but he numbered them by laying so many stones in a row,
and pointing to me to tell them over.
I have told this passage, because it introduces what follows:
that, after I had had this discourse with him, I asked him
how far it was from our island to the shore, and whether the
canoes were not often lost He told me there was no danger,
no canoes ever lost, but that, after a little way out to sea,
there was a current, and a wind always one way in the morn-
ing, the other in the afternoon.
This I understood to be no more than the sets of the tide, as
going out, or coming in; but I afterwards understood it was occa-
sioned by the great draught and reflux of the mighty river Oroo-
noque) in the mouth of which river, as I thought afterwards
oar island lay; and that this land, which I perceived to the W.
. and N. XV. was the great island of Trinidad, on the north
point of the mouth of the river. I asked Friday a thousand
questions about the country, the inhabitants, the sea, the
coast, and what nations were near: he told me all he knew,
with the greatest openness imaginable. I asked him the
names of the several nations of his sort of people, but could
get no other name than Caribs; from whence I easily under-
stood, that these were the Caribbees, which our maps place
on that part of America which reaches from the mouth of
the river Oroonoque to Guiana, and onwards to St. Martha.
He told me that up a great way beyond the moon, that was,
beyond the setting 01 the moon, which must be west from
their country, there dwelt white, bearded men, like me, and
pointed to my great whiskers, which I mentioned before;
and that they had killed much mans', that was his word.
By all which I understood he meant the Spaniards, whose
cruelties in America had been spread over the whole coun-
tries, and were remembered by all nations from father to son.
I inquired if he could tell me how I might come from this
island, and get among those white men; he told me, yes, yes,
I might go in ' two canoe ' I could not understand what he
meant by ' two canoe/ till at last, with great difficulty. I found
he meant, that it must be in a large, great boat, as big as two
canoes.
This part of. Friday's discourse began to relish with me
very well; and from this time I entertained some hopes. that,
one time or other, I might find an opportunity to make my
escape from this place, and that this poor savage might be a
means to help me to do it
During the long time that Friday had now been with me,
and that he began to speak to me, and understand me, I was
not wanting to lay a foundation of religious knowledge in his
mind; particularly 1 asked him one time, who made him.
The poor creature did not understand me at all, but thought
1 had asked him who was his father. But I took it by ano-
ther handle, and'asked him, who made the sea, the ground
lie walked on, and the hills and woods. He told me, it was
one old Benamuckee, that lived beyond all. He could describe
nothing of this great person, but that he was very old; much.
older, he said, than the sea or the land, than (he moon or the
atars. 1 asked him then, if this old person had made all.
things, why did not all things worship him. He looked very
grave, and with a perfect look of innocence, said, 'All things
said O to him.' I asked him if the people who die in his
country went away any where. He said, yes, they all went
to Benamuckee. Then I asked him, whether those they eat
up went thither too: he said, 'Yes.'
From these things I began to instruct him in the knowledge
of the trae God, I told him, that the great Maker of all
things lived up there, pointing up towards heaven: that he
governs the world by the same power and providence by
which he had made it: that he was omnipotent, could do
every thing for us, give every thing to us, take every thing
from us; and thus, by degrees I opened his eyes. He listen-
ed with great attention, and received with pleasure the no-
tion of Jesus Christ being sent to redeem us, and of the
manner of making our prayers to God, and his being able to
hear us, even into heaven. He told me one day, that if our
God could hear us up beyond the sun, he must needs be a
greater God than their Benamuckee, who lived but a little
way off, and yet could not hear, till they went up to the
great mountains where he dwelt, to speak to him. I asked
him, if ever he went thither to speak to him: he said, no;
they never went that were young men; none went thither
but the old men, whom he called their Oowokakee, that is,
as I made him explain it to me, their religious, or clergy;
and that they went to say O (so he called saying prayers),
and (hen came back, and told them what Benamuckee said.
By this I observed, that there is priestcraft even amongst
the most blinded ignorant Pagans in the world; and the poli-
ty of making a secret religion, in order to preserve the vene-
ration of the people to the clergy, is not only to be found in
the Roman, but perhaps among all l'eligions in the world,
even among the most brutish and barbarous savages.
I endeavoured to clear up this fraud to my man Friday,
and told him, that the pretence of their old men going up to
the mountains to say O to their god Benamuckee, was a cheat;
and their bringing word from thence what he said, was much
'.more so; that if they met with any answer, or spoke with any
one there, it must be with an evil spirit: and then I entered
into a long discourse with him about the devil, the original ot
him; his rebellion against God, his enmity to man, the reason
of it, his setting himself up in the dark parts of the world to.
be worshipped instead of- God, and as God, and the many
stratagems he made use of, to delude mankind to their ruin;
how he had a secret access to our passions, and to our affec-
tions, to adapt his snares so to our inclinations, as to cause us
even to be our own tempters, and to run upon our own de-
struction, by our own choice.
I found it was not so easy to imprint right notions in his
mind about the devil, as it was about the being of a God.
Nature assisted all my arguments to evidence to him even
the necessity of a great First Cause, and over-ruling, gov-
erning power, a secret, directing providence, and of the equity
and justice of paying homage to him that made us, and the
like: but there appeared nothing of all this in the notion of an
evil spirit, of his original, his being, his nature, and, above
all, of his inclination to do evil, and to draw us in to do so too.
And the poor creature puzzled me once in such a manner,
by a question merely natural and mnocent, that I scarce knew
what to say to him. I had been talking a great deal to him
of the power of God; his omnipotence, his dreadful aversion
to sin, his being a consuming fire to the workers of iniquity;
how, as he had made us all, he could destroy us, and all the
world, in a moment: and he listened with great seriousness
to me all the while.
After this, I had been telling him how the devil was God's
enemy in the hearts of men, and used all his malice and skill
to defeat the good designs of Providence. and to ruin the
kingdom of Christ in ihe world, and the like: * Well,' says
Friday, 'but you say, God is so strong, so great, is he not
much strong, much might, as the devil?' ' Yes, yes,' said I,
' Friday, God is stronger than the devil, God is above the
devil, and therefore we pray to God to tread him under our
feet, and enable us to resist his temptations, and quench his
fiery darts,'' Hut,' says he again, 'if God much strong, much
might, as the devil, why God not kill the devil so make him
no more wicked.
I was strangely surprised at his question, and after all,
though I was now an old man, yet I was but a young doctor,
and ill enough qualified for a casuist, or a solver of difficul-
ties: and, at first, I could not tell what to say; so I pretend-
ed not to hear him, and asked him what he said. But he
was too earnest for an answer to forget his question, so that
he repeated it in the very same broken words as above. By
this time I had recovered myself a little, and I said,' God will
at last punish him severely, he is reserved for the judgment,
and is to be cast into the bottomless pit, to dwell with ever-
lasting tire.' This did not satisfy Friday; but he returns upon
me, repeating'my words,' Reserve at last! me no understand.
But why not kill the devil now, not kill great ago?' ' You
may as well ask me,' said I, ' why God does not kill you and
me, when we do wicked things here that offend him; we are
preserved to repent and be pardoned' He muses awhile
at this: ' Well, well,' sayshe, mighty affectionately,' that well,
so you, I, devil, all wicked, all preserve, repent, God pardon
all.' Here I was run down again by him to the last degree,
and it was a testimony to me, how the mere notions of nature,
though they will guide reasonable creatures to the knowledge
of a God, and of a worship or homage due to the supreme
1 being of God, as the consequence of our nature; yet nothing
but divine revelation can form the knowledge of Jesus Christ,
and of a redemption purchased for us, of a mediator, of a new
covenant, and of an intercessor at the footstool of God's throne;
I say, nothing but a revelation from heaven can form these in
the soul; and that therefore the Gospel of our Lor-d and Sa-
viour Jesus Christ, 1 mean, the word of God, and the Spirit
of God, promised for the guide and sanctifier of his people,.
and the absolutely necessary instructors of the souls of men
in the saving knowledge of God, and the means of salvation.
I therefore diverted the^re'ient discourse between me and
my man, raising up hastily, as upon some sudden occasion of
going out; then sending him for something a great way off, I
seriously prayed to God that he would enable me to instruct
savingly this poor savage, assisting by his Spirit the heart of
the poor ignorant creature to receive the light ofthe know-
ledge of God in Christ, reconciling hint to himself, and would
guide me to speak so to him from the word of God, as his
conscience might be convinced, his eyes opened, and his soul
saved. When he came again to me, I entered into a long
discourse with him upon the subject of the redemption of man
by the Saviour of the world, and of the doctrine of the Gospel
preached from heaven, viz. of repentance towards God, and
faith in our blessed Lord Jesus. I then explained to him, as
well h> I could, why our blessed Redeemer took not on him
the nature of angels, but the seed of Abraham, and how, for
that reason, the fallen angels had no share in the redemption;
that he came only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel,
and the like.
I had, God knows, more sincerity than knowledge, in all
the methods I took for this poor creature's instruction; and
must acknowledge what I believe all that act upon the same
principle will find, that, in laying things open to him, I really
informed and instructed myself in many things that either I
did not know, or had not fully considered before; but which
occurred naturally to my mind, upon my searching into them
for the information of this poor savage; and I had more affec-
tion in my inquiry after things upon this occasion, than ever
I felt before; so that whether this poor wild wretch was the
better for me or no, I had great reason to be thankful that
ever he came to me; my grief sat lighter upon me, my habi-
tation grew comfortable to me beyond measure; and when I
reflected, that, in this solitary life, which I had been confined
to, I had not only been moved myself to look up to heaven,
and to seek the Hand that brought me thither, but was now
to me made an instrument, under Providence, to save the
life, and for aught I knew, the soul, of a poor savage, and bring
him to the true knowledge of religion, and of the Christian
doctrine, that he might know Christ Jesus, 'to know whom
is life eternal;' I say, when I reflected upon all these things, a
secret joy ran through every part of my soul, and I frequent-
ly rejoiced that ever I was brought to th'is place, which I had
often thought the most dreadful of all afflictions that could
possibly have befallen me.
In this thankful frame I continued all the remainder of my
time; and the conversation which employed the hours between
Friday and me was such as made the three years, which we
lived there together perfectly and completely happy, if any
such thing as complete happiness can be found in a sublunary
state. The savage was now a good Christian; a much better
than I: though 1 have reason to hope, and bless God for it,
that we were equally penitent, and comforted restored peni-
tents. We had here the word of God to read, and no farther
off from his Spirit to instruct than if we had been in England.
I always applied myself to reading the Scripture, and to
let him know, as well as I could, the meaning of what I read,
and he again, by bis serious inquiries and questions, made me,
as I said before, a much better scholar in the scripture-
knowledge than I should ever have been by my own mere
private reading. Another thing I cannot refrain from ob-
serving here also, from experience, in this retired part of my
life; viz. how infinite and inexpressible a ble9sing it is, that
the knowledge of God, and of the doctrine of salvation by
Christ Jesus, is so plainly laid down in the word of God, so
easy to be received and understood, that as the bare reading
the Scripture made me capable of understanding enough of
my duty to carry me directly on to the great work of sincere
repentance for my sins, and laying hold of a Saviour for life
and salvation, to a stated reformation in practice, and obedi-
ence to all God's commands, and this without any teacher
or instructor (I mean human); so the same plain instruction
sufficiently served to the enlightening this savage creature,
and bringing him to become such a Christian, as I have
known few equal to him in my life.
As to the disputes, wranglings, strife, and contention,
which has happened in the world about religion, whether
niceties in doctrines, or schemes of Cliurch government. they
were all perfectly useless to us, as, for aught I can yet see,
they have been to all the rest in the world. We had the
sure guide to heaven, viz. the word of God; and we had, bles-
sed be God! comfortable views of the Spirit of God, teaching
and instructing us by his word, leading us into all truth, and
making us both willing and obedient to the instruction of his
word; and I cannot see the least use that the greatest know-
ledge of the disputed points in religion, which have made such
confusion in the world, would have been to us, if wc could
have obtained it. but I must go on with the historical part
of things, and take every part in its order
After Friday and 1 became more intimately acquainted,
and that he could understand almost all I said to him, and
speak fluently, though in broken English, to me, 1 acquainted
him with my own story, or at le:ist as much of it as related to
my coming into the place. how I had lived there, and how
long. I let him into the mystery (for such it was to him) of
gunpowder and bullet, and taught him how to shoot I gave
him a knife, which he was wonderfully delighted with, and I
made him a belt with a frog hanging to it, such as in England
xwe wear hangers in; and, in the frog instead of a hanger, I
gave him a hatchet, which was not only as good a weapon in
some cases, but much more useful upon many occasions.
I described to him the countries of Europe, and particulav-
It
1y England, which I came from, how we lived, how we wbfe
shipped God, how we behaved to one another, and how we
traded in ships to all parts of the world. I gave him an ac-
count of the wreck which I had been on board of, and showed
him, as near as I could, the place where she lay, but she was
all beaten in pieces long before, and quite gone.
I showed him the ruins of our boat, which we lost when I
escaped, and which I could not stir with my whole strength
then, but was now fallen almost to pieces. Upon seeing this
boat, Friday stood musing a great while, and said nothing.
I asked him what it was he studied upon; at last, says he,
• Me see such boat like come to place at my nation.'
I did not understand him a good while; but, at last, when I
had examined further into it, I understood by him, that a boat,
such as that had been, came on shore upon the country wher6
he lived; that is, as he explained it, was driven thither by
stress of weather. I presently imagined, that some European
ship must have been cast away upon their coast, and the boat
might get loose, and drive ashore; but was so dull that I ne-
ver once thought of men making escape from a wreck thither,
much less whence they might come; so 1 only inquired after
ft description of the boat-
Friday described the boat to me well enough; but brought
me better to understand him, when he added, with some
-warmth, ' We save the white mans from drown.' Then I
presently asked him, if there were any white mans, as he
called theiu, in the boat: ' Yes,'he said,' the boat full of
white mans.' I asked him, ' How many?' He told upon his
fingers seventeen I asked him then, ' What became of
them?' He told me,' They live, they dwell at my nation.'
This put new thoughts into my head again; for I presently
imagined, that these might be the men belonging to the ship
that was cast away in sight of my island, as I now call it; and
who, after the ship was struck on the rock, and they saw
her inevitably lost, had saved themselves in their boat, and
were landed upon that wild shore, among the savages.
Upon this, 1 inquired of him more critically, what was be-
come of them' he assured me they lived still there: that they
had been there about four years; that the savages let them
alone, and gave them victuals to live. I asked him, how it
came to pass they did not kill them, and eat them He said,
* No, they make brother with them;' that is, as I understood
him; a truce: and then he added, ' They no eat mans, hut
-when make the war fight;' that is to say, they never eat any
men, but such as come to fight with them, and are taken in
battle.
It was after this some considerable time, that being on the
top of the hill, at the east side of the island, from whence, as
I have said, I had, in a clear day, discovered the main or con-
tinent of America; Friday, the weather being very serene,
looks very earnestly towards the main land, and, in a kind of
surprise, falls ajnmping and dancing, and calls out to me, for
I was at some distance from him: I asked him what was the
matter. ' O joy !' says he,' O glad! There see my country!
there my nation!'
I observed an extraordinary sense of pleasure appeared in
Jiisface, and his eyes sparkled, and his countenance diseoyer-
ed a strange eagerpess, as if he had a mind to be in his own
country again; and this observation of mine put a great muny
thoughts into me, which made me at first not so easy about my
new man Friday, as I was before; and I made no doubt, but
that if Friday could get back to disown nation again, he would
not only forget all die religion; but all his obligation to me; and
would be forward enough to give his countrymen an account
of me, and come back, perhaps, with a hundred or two of
them, and make a feast upon me, at which he might be as
merry as he used to be with those of his enemies, when they
were taken in war.
But I wronged the poor honest creature very much, for
which I was very sorry afterwards: however, as my jealousy
increased, and held me some weeks, I was a little more cir-
cumspect, and not so familiar and kind to him as before, in
which I was certainly in the wrong too, the honest, grateful
ererture having no thought about it, but what consisted of
the best principles, both as a religious Christian, and as a
grateful friend, as appeared afterwards to my full satisfaction.
Whilst my jealousy of him lasted, you may be sure I was
every day pumping him to see if he would discover any of
the new thoughts, which I suspected were in bim; but I found
every thing he said was honest, and so innocent, that I could
find nothing to nourish my suspicion; and, in spite of all my
uneasiness, he made me at last entirely dis own again; nor
did he in tde least perceive, that I was uneasy; and therefore
I could not suspect him of deceit.-
One day walking up the same hill, but the weather being
hazy at sea, so thai we could not see the continent, I called
to him, and said, 'Friday, do not you wish yourself in your
owu country, your own nation'' 'Yes', he said, 1 be much
0 glad to be at my own nation.' 'What would you do
there', said I: 'would you turn wild again, eat man's flesh
again, and be a savage as you were before? He looked full
of concern, and shaking his head, said, 'No, no; Friday tell,
ihem to live good, tell them to pray God, tell them to eat
corn-bread, cattle flesh, milk: no eat man again.' 'Why
then,' said I to him, 'they will kill you' He looked
grave at that. and then said, 'No, they no kill me; they wil-
ling, love learn.' He meant by this, they would be willing to
learn: he added, they learned much of the bearded mans that
came in the bont. Then I asked him if he would go back to
them He smiled at that, and told me he could not swim so
far I told him I would make a canoe for him. He told me
he would go, if 1 would go with him. I go!' said I, 'why
they will eat me, if I come there.' 'No, no,'says he,'me
make them no eat you: me make they much love you.' He
meant he would tell them how I had killed his enemies, and
saved his life, and so he would make them love me. Then he
told me, as well as he could, how kind they were to seven"
teen white men, or bearded men, as he called them, who
came on shore there in distress.
From this time, I confess, I had a mind to venture over,
and see if I could possibly jom with these bearded men, who,
1 made no doubt, were Spaniards or Portuguese; not doubting
but, if I could, we might find some method to escape from
thence, being upon the continent, and a good company to-
gether, belter than I could from an island, forty miles off the
shore, and alone without help. So, after some days, 1 took
Friday to work agam, by way of discourse; and told him, I
would give hmj a boat to go back ti his own nation: and ac-
cordingly I carried him to my frigate, which lay on the other
side of the island, and having cleared it of water I for I always
kept it sunk m the water) I brought it out, showed it him,
and we both went into it.
I found he was a most dexterous follow at managing it,
would make it p., almost as swift and fast again as I could; so
when he was in I said to him, 'Well, now, Friday, shall we
go to your nation?' He looked very dull at my" saying so.
which, it seems, was because he thought the boat too small
to go so far. I told him then I had a bigger; so the next
day, I went to the place where the first boat lay which I
had made, but which I could not get into the water. tie
said that was big enough; but then, as ( had taken no care of
it, and it had lain two or three and-twenty years there, the
sun had split and dried it, that it was in a manner rotten.
-Friday told me that sucli a boat would do very well, and
would carry ' much enough vitile, drink, bread;' that was his
way of talking
Upon the whole, I was by this time so fixed upon my de-
sign of going over with him to the continent; that I told him
we would go and make one as big as that, and he should go
home in it. He answered not one word, but looked very
grave and sad. I asked him what was the matter with him.
He asked me agam thus, ' Why you angry mad with Friday.''
* What me done?' I asked him what he meant: I told him I was
not angry with him at all. • No angry! no angry!' says he, re-
peatingthe words several times; 'Why send Friday homeaway
to my nation?' ' Why,' said I, ' Friday did you not say you
wished you were there?'' Yes, yes,' sa) s he,' wish be both there;
no wish Friday there, no master there.' In a word he would
not think of going there without me. ' I go there, Friday!' said
I: ' what should i do there?* He turned very quick upon me at
this;' You do great deal much good,' says he; ' you teach wild
mans be good, sober, tame mans. you tell them know God, pray
God, and live new life.' ' Alas, Friday,'said I,' thou knowest
not what thou sayest. I am but an ignorant man myself.'' Yes,
yes, says he,' you teachee me good, you teachee them good.'
' No, no, Friday,' said I, ' you shall go without me; leave me
here to live by myself, as I did before. He looked confused
again at that word; and, running to one of the hatchets which
he used to wear, he takes it up hastily, and gives it me.
• What must I do with this?' said I to him. ' You take kill
Friday,' says he. ' What must I kill you for?' said I again.
He returns very qnick, * What you send Friday away for?
Take kill Friday. no send Friday away.' This he spoke so
earnestly, that I saw tears stand in his eyes. In a word, I so
plainly discovered the utmost affectiou in him to me, and a
firm resolution in him, that I told him then, and often after,
that I would never send him away from me, if he wa9 willmg
4o stay with me. ,

\
Upon the -whole, as I found, by all his discourse, a settled
affection to me, and that nothing should part him from mc,
so 1 found all the foundation of his desire to go to his own
country was laid in his ardent affection to the people, and his
hopes of my doing them good; a thing, which as I had no no-
tion of myself, so I had not the least thought, or intention, or
desire of undertaking it But still I found a strong inclination
to my attempting an escape,. as above, founded on the suppo-
sition gathered from the former discourse; viz. that there
were seventeen bearded men there; and, therefore, without
any more delay, I went to work with Friday, to find out a
great tree proper to fell, and make a large periagua, or canoe,
to undertake the voyage. There were trees enough in the
island to have built a little fleet, not of periagnas and canoes
only, but even of good large vessels; but the main thing I looked
at, was to get one so near the water, that we might lanch it in
when it was made, to avoid the mistake 1 committed at first.
At last Friday pitched upon a tree;.for I found he knew
much better than 1 what Kind of wood was fittest for it; nor
can I tell, to this day, what wood to call the tree we cut
down, except that it was very like the tree we call fustie, or
between that and the Nicaragua wood, for it was much of the
same colour and smell. Friday was for burning the hollow or
cavity of this tree but, to make it into a boat: bull showed him
how rather to cut it out with tools, which after 1 showed him
how to use, he did it very handily; and, in about a month's
hard labour, we finished it, and made it very handsome, es-
pecially when with our axes, which I showed him how to
handle, we cut and hewed the outside into the true shape of
a boat. \fter this, however, it cost us near a fortnight's
time to get her along, as it were, inch by inch, upon great
rollers, into the water; but when she was in, she would have
carried twenty men with great ease.
When she was in the water, and though she Was so big, it
amazed me to see with what dexterity and how swift my
man Friday would manage - her, turn her, and paddle her
along So I asked him if he would, and if we might, venture
over in her; 'Yes,' he said, 'me venture over in her very well,
though great blow wind.' However, I had a farther design.
that he knew nothing of, and that was to make a mast and.
a sail, and to fit her with an anchor and cable. As to a mast,
that was easy enough to get; sn I pitched upon a straight
joung cedar-tree, which I found near the place, and which
there was great plenty of in the island; and I set Friday to
work to cut it down, and gave him directions how to shape
and order it; lmt as to the sail, that was my particular care.
I knew I had old sails, or rather pieces of old sails enough,
tmt as I hail had them now twenty-six years by me, and
Itad not been very careful to preserve them, not imagining
that 1 should ever have this kind of use for them, I did not
doubt but they were all rotten; and mdeed most of them
were so. However, I found two pieces which appeared
pretty good, and with those I went to work; and with a
great deal of pains, and awkward tedious stitching (you may
lie. sure) for want of needles, I at length made a three-cor-
nered ugly thing, like what we call in England a shoulder-of-
jautton sail, to go with a boom at bottom, and a little short
sprit at the top, such as usually our ships' long-boats sail with,
and such as 1 best knew how to manage, because it was such
a one as I used in the boat in which I made my escape from
Barbary, as related in the first part of my story.
I was near two months performing this last work; viz. rig-
ging and fitting my mast and sails; for I finished them very
complete, making a small stay, and a sail or foresail to
it, to assist, if we should turn to windward: and, which
.was more than all, I fixed a rudder to the stern of her, to
steer with; and though I was but a bungling shipwright, yet
as I knew the usefulness and even necessity of such a thing,
I applied myself with so much pains to do it, that at last I
Brought it to pass; though, considering the many dull con-
trivances I had for it that failed, I think it cost me almost as
much labour as making the boat.
After all this was done, I had my man Friday to teach as
to what belonged to the navigation of my boat; for though he?
knew very well how to paddle the canoe, he knew nothing
what belonged to a sail and a rudder, and was the most
amazed when he saw me work the boat toand-agiiin in the
sea, by the rudder, and how the sail gibbed, aad filled this
way or that way, as the;course we sailed changed; I say, when
he saw this, he stood like one astonished and amazed. How-
ever, with a little use, I made all these'things familiar to him,
and he became an expert sailor, except that as to the compass,
I could make him understand very little; of that; on the
other hand, as there was very little cloudy weather, and seV
dom or never any fogs in those parts. there was the less oc-
casion for a compass, seeing the stars were always to be seen
by night, and the shore by day, except in the rainy seasons;
and then noboch cared to stir abroad, either by land or sea.
I was now entered on the seven-and twentieth year of my
captivity in this place; though the three last years that I had
this creature with me ought rather to be left out of the ac-
count, my habitation being quite of another kind, than in all
the rest of the time. I kept the aniversary of my landing
here, with the same thankfulness to God for his mercies as
at first; and if I had such cause of acknowledgment at first,
I had much more so now, having such. additional testimonies
of the oare of Providence over me, and the great hopes I had
of being effectually and speedily delivered: for I had an in-
vincible impression upon my thoughts, that my deliverance
was at hand, and that I should not be another year in
this place However, I went on with my husbandry, dig-
ging, planting, fencing, as usual; I gathered and cured my
grapes, and did every necessary thing, as before.
The ramy season was in the mean time upon me, when I
kept more within doors than at other times; so I had stowed
qur new vessel as secure as we could, bringing her up into
the creek, where, as I said in the beginning, I landed my
rafts from the ship: and hauling her up to the shore, at high-
water mark, I made my man Friday dig a little dock, just
big enough to hold her, and just deep enough to give her
water enough to float in; and then when the tide was out, we
made a strong dam cross the end of it, to keep the water
out; and so she lay dry, as to the tide from the sea; and
to keep the rain off, we laid a great many boughs of trees
so thick, that she was as well thatched as a house: and thus
we wailed for the months of November and December in
which I designed to make my adventure.
When the settled season began to come in, as the thought
of my design returned with the fair weather, I was preparing
daily for the voyage; and the lirst thing I did was to lay by a
certain quantity of provisions, being the stores for our voyage;
and intended, in a week or a fortnight's time, to open the
dock, and lanch out our boat. I was busy one morning upon
something of this kind, when I called to Friday, and bade
him go to the sea-shore, and see if he could find a turtle, or
tortoise, a thing which we generally got once a week, for the
suit: of the eggs, as well as the flesh. Friday had not been
long gone, when he cajne running back, and flew over my
outward wall, or fence, like one that felt not the ground, or
the steps he set his feet on; and before I had time to speak
to liim, he cried out to me,' O master! O master1. O sorrow!
Obad!' 'What's the matter, Friday?' saidl. 'O yonder
there,' says he, ' one, two, three canoe! one, two, three!' By
this way of speaking, I concluded there were six; but, on
inquiry, I found there were hut three. ' Well, Friday,' said
J, ' do not be frighted:' so I heartened him up as well as 1
could. However, I saw the poor fellow was most terribly
scared; for nothing ran in his head but that they were come
to look for him, and would cut him in pieces, and eat him;
and the poor fellow trembled so, that I scarce knew what to
do with him. I comforted him as well as I could, and told
Iiim I was in as much danger as he, and that they would eat
me as well as him. ' But,' said I, ' Friday, we must resolve
to fight them. Can you fight, Friday?' ' Me shoot,' says he;
' but there come many great number.' ' No matter for that,'
said I again, ' our guns will fright them that we do not kill,'
So I asked him, whether, if I resolved to defend him, he
would defend me, and stand by me, and do just as 1 bade
him. lie said. ' Me die, when you bid die Masterj' So I
went and fetched a good dram of rum, and gave him; for I
had been so good a husband »f my rum, that 1 had a great
deal left. When he had drank it, I made him take the two
fowling-pieces, which we always carried, and load them with
large swan-shot, as big as small pistol-bullets: then I took
four muskets, and loaded them with two slugs, and five
small bullets each; and my two pistols I loaded with a brace
of bullets each. I hung my great sword, as usual, naked
by niy side, and gave Friday his hatchet.
When f had thus prepared myself, I took my perspective
glass, and went up to the side of the hill, to sec what I eould
discover, and I found quickly, by my glass, that there were
©ne-and-twenty savages, three prisoners, and three canoes;
and that their whole business seemed to be the trinmphant
banquet upon these three human bodies (a barbarous feast in-
deed!); hut nothing more than as I had observed was usual
with them.
I observed also, that they were landed, not where they had
done when Friday made his escape, but nearer to my creek,
where the shore was low, and where a thick wood came close
almost down to the sea. This, with the abhorrence of the
inhuman errand these wretches came about, so filled me with
indignation, that I came down again to Friday, and told him
I was resolved to go down to them, and kill them all; and
asked him if he would stand by me He had now gotten over
his fright, and his spirits being a little raised with the dram I
had given him, he was very cheerful; and told me, as before,
' he would die, when I bid die'
In this fit of fury, I took first and divided the arms which.
I had charged, as before, between us: I gave Friday one pis-
tol to stick in his girdle, and three guns upon his shoulder;
and I took one pistol, and the other three myself; and in this
posture we marched out. I took a small bottle of rum in my
pocket, and gave Friday a large bag with more powder and
bullet: and as to orders, I charged him to keep close behind
me, and not to stir, or shoot, or do any thing till I bade him;
and, in the meantime, not to speak a word. In this posture
I fetched a compass to my right hand of near a mile, as well
to get over the creek as to get into the wood; so that I might
come within shot of them, before I should be discovered,
which I had seen by my glass it was easy to do.
While I was making this march, my former thoughts re-
turning, I began to abate my resolution. I do not mean that
I entertained any fear of their number: for as they were
naked, unarmed wretches, it if certain I was superior to
them; nay, though I had been alone: but it occurred to my
thoughts, what call, what occasion, much less what necessity
I was in to go and dip my hands in blood, to attack people
who had neither done nor intended me any wrong; who,
as to me, were innocent, and whose barbarous customs were
their own disaster, being in them a token indeed of God's
having left them, with the other nations of that part of
the world, to such stupidity, and to such inhuman courses;
but did not call me to take upon me to be a judge of their ac-
tions, much less an executioner of his justice: that whenever-
he thought fit, he would take the cause into his own hands,
and, by national vengeance, punish them for national crimes;
hut that in the mean time, it was none of my business: that it
was true, Friday might justify it, because he was a declared
enemy, and in a state of war with those very particular
people, and it was lawful for him to attack them; but I
could not say the same with respect to me. These things
.were so warmly pressed upon my thoughts all the way »»
I went, that I resolved I would only go and place myself near
them, that I might observe their barbarous feast, and that I
would act then as God should direct; but that, unless some-
thing offered that was more a call to me than yet I knew of, I
would not meddle with them.
With this resolution I entered the wood, and with all pos-
sible wariness aud silence (Friday following close at my
heels,) I marched till I came to the skirt of the wood, on
the side which was next to them; only that one corner of the
wood lay between me and them. Here I called softly to Fri-
day, and showing him a great tree, which was just at the cor-
ner of the wood, I bade him go to the tree, and bring me
word if he could see there plainly what they were doiug.
He did so. and came immediately back to me, and told me
they might be plainly viewed there; that they were all about
the fire, eating the flesh of one of their prisoners; and
that another lay bound upon the sand, a little from them,
whom, he said, they would kill next, and which fired the
very soul within me. He told me it was not one of their
nation, but one of the bearded men whom he had told
me of, that came to their country in the boat. I was filled
with horror at the very naming the white, bearded man; and,
going to the tree, 1 saw plainly, by my glass, a white man,
who lay upon the beach of the sea, with his hands and his
fret tied with flags, or things like rushes: and that he was an
European, and had clothes on.
There was another tree, and a little thicket beyond it,
about fifty yards nearer to them than the place where I was,
which, by going a little way about. I saw I might come at un-
discovered, and that then 1 should be within half shot of
them. So I withheld my passion; though I was indeed en-
raged to the highest degree; and. going back about twenty
paces, I got behind some bushes, which held all the way till
I came to the other tree, and then I came to a little rising
ground, which gave me a full view of them, at the distance
of about eighty yards.
I had now not a moment to lose; for nineteen of Ihe dread-
ful wretches sat upon the ground, all close huddled together,
and had just sent the other two to butcher the poor Christian,
aud bring him, perhaps, limb by limb, to their fire, and they
\
were stooped down to untie the bands at his feet. I turned
to Friday: ' Now, Friday,' said I, ' do as I bid thee. Friday
said he would. ' Then, Friday,' said I, ' do exactly as you
see me do; fail in nothing.' So I set down one of the mus-
kets, and the fowling-piece, upon the ground, and Friday
did the like by his; and with the other musket I took my aim
at the savages, bidding him to do the like: then asking him if
he was ready, he said,' Yes.' ' Then fire at them,' said I;
and the same moment I fired also.
Friday took his aim so much better than I, that, on the
side that he shot, he killed two of them, and wounded three
more;. and, on my side, I killed one, and wounded two.
They were, you may be sure, in a dreadful consternation;
and all of them, who were not hurt, jumped up upon their
feet immediately, but did not know which way to run, or
which way to look; for they knew not from whence their des-
truction came. Friday kept his eyes close upon me, that, as
I had bid him, he might observe what I did: so, as soon as
the first shot was made, I threw down the piece, and took up
the fowling-piece, and Friday did the like: he sees me cock
and present: he did the same again. ' Are you ready, Fri-
day?' said I. * Yes,' said he. ' Let fly, then,' said 1, ' in the
name of God;' and with that I fired again among the amazed
wretches, and so did Friday; and as our pieces were now
loaded with what I called swan-shot, or small pistol bullets, we
found only~iwo drop; but so many were wounded, that they
ran about yelling and screaming like mad creatures, all bloody
and miserably wounded, most of them; whereof three more
fell quickly after, though not quite dead.
' Now, Friday,' said I, laying down the discharged pieces,
and taking up the musket, which was yet loaded, * follow
me,' said I; which he did, with a deal of courage; upon
which 1 rushed out of the wood, and showed myself, anil
Friday close at my foot. As soon as I perceived they saw me,
I shouted as loud as 1 could, and bade Friday do so too; and
running as fast as I could, which, by the way, was not very
fast, being loaded with arms as I was, I made directly to-
wards the poor victim, who was, as I said, lying upon the
beach or shore, between the place where they sat, and the
sea. The two butchers, who were just going to work with
him, had left him, at the surprise of our first fire, and fled, in
a terrible fright, to the sea-side, and had jumped into a
?
ItKEJUUSDTG THK SbSXTARB
canoe, and three more of the rest made the same way. I
turned to Friday, and bade him step forwards, and fire at
them, he understood me immediately, and, running about
forty yards to be near them, he shot at them, and I thought
he had killed them all; for I saw them all fall on a heap in
the boat; though I saw two of them up again quickly: how-
ever; he killed two of them, and wounded the third, so that
he laid down in the bottom of the boat, as if he had been
dead.
While my man Friday fired at them, I pulled out my
knife, and cut the flags that bound the poor victim; and, loos-
ing his hands and feet, I lifted him up, and asked him, in
the Portuguese tongue, what he was. He answered, in
Latin, ' Christianus;' but was so weak and faint, that he it
could scarce stand, or speak. I took my bottle out of my
pocket, and gave it him, makmg signs that he should drink,
which he did; and I gave him a piece of bread, which he eat.
Then I asked him what countryman he was; and he said,
' Espagnole;' and, being a little recovered, let me know, by
all the' signs he could possibly make, how much he was in my
debt for his deliverance. ' Seignior/ said I, with as much
Spanish as I could make up, ' we will talk afterwards, but
we must fight now: if you have any strength left, take this
pistol and sword, and lay about you.' He took them very
thankfully, and no sooner.had he the arms in his hands, but,
as if they had put new vigour into him, he flew upon his mur-
derers, like a fury, and had cut two of them in pieces in an in-
stant; for the truth is, as the whole was a surprise to them,
so the poor creatures were so much frighted with the noise of
our pieces, that they fell down for mere amazement and fear,
and bad no more power to attempt their own escape, than
their flesh had to resist our shot; and that was the case of
those five that Friday shot at in the boat; for as three of
them fell with the hurt they received, so the other two fell
with the fright.
I kept my piece in my hand still, without firing, being wil-
ling to keep my charge ready, because I had given the
Spaniard my pistol and sword; so I called to Friday, and bade
him run up to the tree from whence we first fired, and fetch
the arms which lay there, that had been discharged, which
'he did with great swiftness, and then giving him my mus-
ket, I sat down myself to load all the rest again, and bade
them come to me when they wanted. While I was loading
these pieces, tuere happened a fierce engagement between
the Spaniard and one of the savages, who made at him with
one of their great wooden swords, the same weapon that was
to kill him before, if I had not prevented it. The Spaniard,
who was as bold and as brave as could be imagined, though
weak, had fought this Indian a good while, and had cut him
two great wounds on his head: but the savage being a stout,
lusty fellow, closing in with him, had thrown him down (be-
ing faint), and was wringing my sword out of his hand, when
the Spaniard, though nndermost, wisely quitting the sword,
drew the pistol from his girdle, shot the savage though the
body, and killed him upon the spot, before I, who was running
to help, could come uear him.
Friday, being now left at his liberty, pursued the flying
wretches with no weapon in his hand but his hatchet; and with
that he dispatched those three who, as I said before, were
wounded at first and fallen, and all the rest be could come up
with; and the Spaniard coming to me for a gun, I gave him
one of the fowling-pieces, with which he pursued two of the
savages, and wounded them both; but as he was not able to run,
they both got from him into the wood, where Friday pursu-
ed them, and killed one of them; but the other was too nim-
ble for him; and though he was wounded, yet bad plunged in-
to the sea, and swam, with all his might, off to those two who
were left in the canoe, which three in the canoe, with one
wounded, we know not whether he died or no, were all that
escaped our hands, of one-aud-twenty. The account of the
rest is as follows:
y
3 Killed at our shot from the tree.
2 Killed at the next shot.
2 Killed by Friday in the boat.
2 Killed by ditto, of those at first wounded.
1 Killed by ditto, in the wood.
3 Killed by the Spaniard
4 Killed, being found dropped here and there, of their
wounds, or killed by Friday in his chase of them.
4 Escaped in the boat, whereof one wounded, if not dead-
21 la an.
Those that were in the canoe, worked hard to get out of
gun-shot; and though Friday made two or three shots at them,
1 did not find that he hit any of them. Friday would fain
have had me take one of their canoes, and pursue them; and
indeed I was very anxious about their escape, lest, carrying
the news home to their people, they should come back, per-
haps, with two or three hundred of their canoes, and devour
us by mere multitude; so I consented to pursue them by sea,
and running to one of their canoes, I jumped in, and bade
Friday follow me; but when I was in the canoe, I was surpri-
sed to find another poor creature lie there alive, bound hand
and foot, as the Spaniard was. for the slaughter, and almost
dead with fear, not knowing what the matter was, for he had
not been able to look up over the side of the boat; he was tied
so hard, neck aud heels, and had been tied so long, that he
had really little life in him.
I immediately cut the twisted flags, or rushes, which they
had bound him with, and would have helped him up, but he
could not stand, or speak, but groaned most piteouslv, believ-
ing, it seems, still that he was only unbound in order to be
killed.
When Friday came to him, I bade him speak to him, and
tell him of his deliverance; and pulling out my bottle, made
him give the poor wretch a dram, which, with the news of his
being delivered, revived him, and he sat up in tne boat; but
when Friday came to hear him speak, and looked m his face,
it would have moved any one to tears, to have seen how Fri.
day kissed him, embraced him, hugged him, cried, laughed,
hallooed, jumped about, danced, sung, then cried again, wilmg
his hands, beat his own face and head, and then sungand jump-
ed about again, like a distracted creature It was a good while
before I could make him speak to me, or tell me what was
the matter; but when he came a little to himself, he told me
that it was his father-
It is not easy for me to express how it moved me, to see
what ecstasy and filial affection had worked in this poor savage,
at the sight of his father, and of his being delivered from death;
nor indeed can I describe half the extravagances of his affection
after this. fur he went into the boat, and out of the boat, a great
many times. When he went in to him, he would sit down
by him, open his breast, aud hold his father's head close to
his bosom, half an hour together, to nourish it; then he took
his arms and ancles, which were numbed and stiff with the
binding, and chaffed and rubbed them with his hands; and I,
perceiving what the case was, gave him some rum out of my
bottle to rub them with, which did them a great deal of good.
This action put an end to our pursuit of the canoe with the
other savages, who were now gotten almost out of sight; and
it was happy for us that we did not, for it blew so hard within
two hours after, and before they could be gotten a quarter of
their way, and continued blowing so hard all night, and that
from the north-west, which was against them, that I could not
suppose their boat could live, or that they ever reached to
their own coast.
But to return to Friday: he was so busy about his father,
that I could not find in my heart to take him off, for some
time; but after I thought he could leave him a little, I called
him to me, and he came jumping and laughing, and pleased
to the highest extreme. Then I asked him, if he had given
liis father any bread. He shook his head, and said, ' None:
ugly dog eat all up self.' So I gave him a cake of bread out
of a little pouch 1 carried on purpose; I also gave him a dram
for himself, but he would not taste it, but carried it to his fa-
ther. I had in my pocket also two or three bunches of my
raisins, so I gave him a handful of them for his father. He
had no sooner given bis father these raisins; but 1 saw him
come out of the boat and run away, as if he had been bewitch-
ed. He ran at such a rate (for he was the swiftest fellow of
his foot that ever I saw), I say, he ran at such a rate, that he
was out of sight, as it were, in an instant; and though I called
and hallooed too after him, it was all one: away he went, and,
in a quarter of an hour, I saw him come back again, though
not so fast as he went; and as he came nearer, I found his pace
was slacker, because- he had something in his hand.
When he came up to me, 1 found he had been quite home
for an earthen jug, or pot, to bring his father, some fresh wa-
ter; and that he had got two more cakes, or loaves of bread.
The bread he gave me, but the water he carried to his father;
however, as I was very thirsty too, I took a little sup of it. This
water revived his father more than all the rum or spirits 1 had
given him; for he was just fainting with thirst.
When his father had drunk, I called to him to know if there
was my water left: he said, ' Yes;' and I bade him give it to
flic poor Spaniard, who was in as much want of it as his f»-
thcr; and I sent one of the cakes, that Friday brought, to the
Spaniard too, who was indeed very weak, and was reposing
himself npon a green place, under the shade of a tree, and
whose limbs were also very stiff, and very much swelled with
the rude bandage he had been tied with. When I saw that
upon Friday's coming to him with the water, he sat up, and
drank, and took the bread, and began to eat, I went to him^
and gave him a handful of raisins. He looked up in my face
with all the tokens of gratitude and thankfulness that could
appear in any countenance; but was so weak,notwithstanding
he had so exerted himself in the fight, that he could not stand
up upon his feet: he tried to do it two or three times, but was
really not able, his ancles were so swelled, and so painful to
him, so 1 bade him sit still, and caused Friday to rub his an-
cles, and bathe them with rum, as he had done his father's.
I observed the poor affectionate creature every two minutes,
or perhaps less, all the while he was here, turned his head
about, to see if his father was in the same place and posture as
he left him sitting, and at last he found he was not to be seen,
at which, he started up, and, without speaking a word, flew
with that swiftness to him, that one could scarce perceive his
feet to touch the ground as he went: but when he came, he
only found he had laid himself down to ease his limbs. So
Friday came back to me presently, and I then spoke to the
Spaniard to let Friday help him up, if he could, and lead him
to the boat, and then he should carry him to our dwelling,
where I would take care of him: but Friday, a lusty young
fellow, took the Spaniard quite up upon his back, and carried
him away to the boat, and set him down softly upon the side
or gunnel of the conoe, with his feet in the inside of it, and then
lifted him quite in, and set him close to his father, ami pre-
sently stepping out again, lanched the boat off, and paddled it
along the shore faster than I could walk, though the wind blew
pretty hard too; so be brooght them both safe into our creek,
and leaving them in the boat, runs away to fetch the other ca-
noe. \a he passed me, I spoke to him, and asked him whither
he went. He told me, ' Go fetch more boat.' So away he
-went, like the wind, for sure never man or horse ran like
him, and he had the other canoe in the creek, almost as soon
as I got to it by land: so he wafted me over, and then went
to kelp our new guests out of the boatj which he did: but they
S2
were neither of tliem able to walk, so that poor Friday knew
not what to do.
To remedy this I went to work in my thought, and calling
to Friday to bid them sit down on the bank while he cmc to
me, I soon made a kind of hand-barrow to lay them on, and
Friday and I carried them up both together upon it between
us. But when we got them to the outside of our wall, or
fortification, we were at a worse loss than before, for it was
impossible to get them over; and I was resolved not to break
it down. So I set to work again: and Friday and I, in about
two hours' time, made a very handsome tent, covered with
old sails, and above that with boughs of trees, being in the
space without our outward fence, and between that and the
grove of young wood which 1 had planted: and here we made
them two beds of such things as I had; viz. of good|rice straw,
with blankets laid upon it to lie on, and another to cover them
on each bed.
My island was now peopled, and I thought myself very
rich in subjects; and it was a merry reflection which I fre-
quently made, how like a king 1 looked. First of all, the
whole country was my own mere property, so that I had au
undoubted right of dominion. Secondly, my people were
perfectly subjected: I was the absolute lord and lawgiver;
• they all owed their lives to me, and were ready to lay down
their lives, if there had been occasion of it, for me. It waa
remarkable too, I had but three subjects, and they were of
three different religions: my man Friday was a protestant;
his father was a pagan and a cannibal, and the Spaniard was
a papist. However, I allowed liberty of conscience through-
out my dominions. But this is by the way.
As soon as I had secured my two weak, rescued prisoners,
and given them shelter, and a place to rest them upon, 1
began to think of making some provision for them: and the
first thing I did, I ordered Friday to take a yearling goat,
betwixt a kid and a goat, out of my particular flock, to be
killed. Then 1 cut off the hinder quarter, and chopping it
into small pieces, I set Friday to work to boiling and stewing,
and made them a very good dish, I assure you, of flesh and
broth, having put some barley and rice also into the broth;
and as I cooked it without doors, for I made no fire within my
mner wall, so I carried ^ all into the new tent: and having;
set a table there for them, I sat down and eat my dinner also
with them; and, as well I could, cheered them and encour-
aged ihem, Friday being my interpreter, especially to his
father, and indeed to the Spaniard too; for the Spaniard spoke
the language of the savages pretty well.
After we had dined, or rather supped, I ordered Friday to
take one of the canoes, and go and fetch our muskets and
other fire-arms, which, for want of time, we had left upon the
place of battle; and the next day I ordered him to go and
bury the dead bodies of the savages, which lay open to the
sun, and would presently be offensive; and I also ordered him
to bury the horrid remains of their barbarous feast, which I
knew were pretty much, and which I could not think of
doing myself: nay, I could not hear to see them, if I went
that way. All which he punctually performed, and defaced
the very appearance of the savages being there; so that when I
went again, I could scarce know where it was, otherwise than
by the corner of the wood, pointing to the place.
I then began to enter into a little conversation with my two
new subjects; and first I set Friday to inquire of his father
what he thought of the escape of the savages in that canoe;
and whether we might expect a return of them with a power
too great for us to resist. His first opinion was, that the savages
in the boat never could live out the storm which blew that
night they went off, but must of necessity be drowned or driven
south to those other shores, where they were as sure.to be
devoured as they were to be drowned, if they were castaways
but as to what they would do. if they came safe on shore, he
said, he knew not; but it was his opinion that they were so
dreadfully frighted with the manner of their being attacked,
the noise, and the fire, that he believed they would tell their
people they were all killed by thunder and lightening, and
not by the hand of man; and that the two which appeared
(viz Friday and I) were two heavenly spirits or furies come
down to destroy them, and not men with weapons. This, he
said, he knew, because he heard them all cry out so in their
language to one another: for it was impossible to them to
conceive that a man could dart fire, and speak thunder, and
kill at a distance, without lifting up the hand, as was done
now. And this old savage was in the right: for, as I under-
stood since by other hands, the savages of that part ne*er at'
tempted to go over to the island afterwards. They were so
terrified with the accounts given by those four men (for it
seems they did escape the sea), that they believed, who
ever went to that enchanted island, would be destroyed with
fire from the gods.
This, however, I knew not, and therefore was under con-
tinual apprehensions for a good while, and kept alwiys upon
my guard, 1 and all my army: for as we were now four of us,
I would have ventured upon a hundred of them fairly, in the
open field, at any time.
In a little time, however, no more onnoes appearing, the
fear of their coming wore off, and I began to take my former
thoughts of a voyage to the main into consideration, being
likewise assured by Friday's father, that I might depend upon
good usage from their nation, on his account, if I would go.
But my thoughts were a little suspended, when I had a
aerious discourse with the Spaniard, and when I understood
that there were sixteen more of his countrymen and Portu-
guese, who having been cast away, and made their escape to
that side, lived there at peace indeed with the savages, but
-were very sore put to it for necessaries, and indeed for life.
I asked him all the -particulars of their voyage. and found
they were a Spanish ship, bound from Bio de la Plata, to the
Havanna, being directed to leave their loading there, which
-was chiefly hides and silver, and to bring back what European
goods they could meet with there; that they had five Portu-
guese seamen on board, whom they took out of another wreck;
that five of their own men were drowned when first the ship
was lost; and that these escaped through mfinite dangers and
hnaards, and arrived almost starved on the cannibal coast,
-where they expected to have been devoured every moment.
He told me thev had some arms with them, but they were
perfectly useless, for that they had neither powder nor ball,
the wattling of the sea having spoiled all their powder, but a
little wflSch they used at their first landing to provide them-
selves some food.
I asked him what he thr-jght would become of them there:
and if they had formed no design of making any escape. He
aaid, they had many consultations about it; but that having
neither vessel, nor tools to build one, nor provisions of any
kmd, their counsels always ended in tears and despair.
1 asked him how he thought they would receive a proposal
from me, which might tend towards an escape; and whether,
if they were all here, it might not be done. I told him, with
freedom, I feared mostly their treachery and ill Usage of me,
if I put my life into their hands; for that gratitude was no in-
herent virtue in the nature of man; nor did men always square
their dealings by the obligations they had received, so much
as they did by the advantages they expected. I told him it
would be very hard, (hat I should be the instrument of their
deliverance, and that they should afterwards make me their
prisoner in New Spain, where an Englishman was certain to
be made a sacrifice, what necessity, or what accident soever,
brought him thither: and that 1 had rather be delivered up
to the savages, and be devoured alive, than fall into the mer-
ciless claws of the priests, and be carried into the Inquisition.
I added, that otherwise I was persuaded, if they were all here,
we might, with so many hands, build a bark large enough to
carry us all away, either to the Brasils, southward, or to the
islands, or Spanish coast, northward: but that if, in requital,
they should, when I had put weapons into their hands, carry
me, by force, among their own people, I might be ill used foe1
my kindness to them, and make my case v/orse than it was
before.
He answered with a great deal of candour and ingenuity,
that their condition was so miserable, and they were so sensi-
ble of it, that he believed they would abhor the thought of
using any man unkindly, that should contribute to their de-
liverance, and that, if I pleased, he would go to them with
the old man, and discourse with them about it, and return
again, and bring me their answer: that he would make condi-
tions with them, upon their solemn oath, that.>they should be
absolutely under my leading, as their commander and captain;
and that they should swear upon the holy sacraments and the
gospel, to be true to me, and to go to such Christian country
as I should agree to, and no other; and to be directed wholly
and absolutely by my orders, till they were landed safely in
such country as I intended; and that he would brirfg a con*
tract from them, under their hands, for (hat purpose.
Then he told me, he would first stveav to me himself, that
he would never stir from me as long as he lived, till I gave
him orders; and that he would take my side to the last drop
of blood, if there should happen the least breach of faith among
Ins countrymen-
He told me they were all of them very c'wil, honest men*
and they were under the greatest distress imaginable, having;
neither weapons nor clothes, nor any food, but at the merey
and discretion of the savages, out of all hopes of ever return-
ing to their own country; and that he was sure, if I would
undertake their relief, they would live and die by me.
Upon these assurances, I resolved to venture to relieve
them, if possible, and to send the old savage and this
Spaniard over to them to treat. But when he had gotten all
things in readiness to go, the Spaniard himself started an ob-
jection, which had so much prudence in it on one hand, and
so much sincerity on the other hand, that I could not but be
very well satisfied in it; and, by his advice, put off the de-
liverance of his comrades for at least half a year. The case
was thus:
He had been with us now about a month, during which
timt-1 had let him see in what manner I had provided, with
the assistance of Providence, for my support; and he saw evi-
dently what siock of corn and rice I had laid up, which, as it
Was more than sufficient for myself, so it was not sufficient,
at least, without good husbandry, for my family, now it was
increased to number four: but much less would it be sufficient,
if his countrymen, who were, as he said, fourteen, still alive,
should come over; and, least of all. would it be sufficient to
victual our vessel, if we should build one, for a voyage to any
of the Christian colonies of V merica. So he told me, he
thought it would be more advisable to let him, and the two
others, dig and cultivate some more land, as-much as 1 could
spare s^ed to sow; and that we should wait another harvest,
thai we might hf>ve a supply of corn for his counlry men. when
they should come; for want might be a temptation to them to
disagree, or not to think themselves delivered; otherwise than
out of one difficulty into another. ' You know,' says he, ' the
child mi of Israel, though they rejoiced at first at their being
delivered out ol Egypt, yet rebelled even against God him-
self, that delivered them, when they came to want bread in
the wilderness.'
His caution was so seasonable, and his advice so good, that
I cnuld not but be very well pleased with his proposal, as well
as I was satisfied with his fidelity. So we fell to digging all
four of us, as well as the wooden tools we were furnished
with permitted; and in about a month's time, by the end of
which it was seed time, we had gotten as much land cured
and inmmed up as we sowed twenty-two bushels of barley
on, and sixteen jars of rice, which was, in short, all the seed
we had to spare; nor indeed did we leave ourselves bailey
sufficient for our own food, for the six months that we had to
expect our crop, that is to say, reckoning from the time we
set our seed aside for sowing; for it is not to be supposed it is
six months in the ground in that country
Having now society enough, and our number being suffi-
cient to put us out of fear of the savages; if they had come,
unless their number had been very great, we went freely all
over the island, whereever we found occasion; and as here
we had our escape or deliverance upon our thoughts, it wag
impossible, at least for me, to have the means of it out of
mine. To this purpose, I marked out several trees, which
I thought fit for our work, and I set Friday and his father to
cutting them down; and then I caused the Spaniard, to whom
I imparted my thoughts on that affair, to oversee and direct
their work. I showed them with what indefatigable pains I
had hewed a large tree into single planks, and I caused them
to do the like, till they bad made about a dozen large planks
of good oak, near two feet broad, thirty-five feet long,1 and
from two inches to four inches thick. What prodigious labour
it took up, any one may imagine.
At the same time, I contrived to increase my little flock of
tame goats as much as I could; and to this purpose I made
Friday and the Spaniard go out one day, and myself with
Friday the next day; for we took our turns: and, by this
means, we got about twenty young kids to breed up with the
rest; for whenever we shpt the dam, we saved the kids, and
added them to our flock. But, above all, the season for
curing the grapes coming on, I caused such a prodigious
quantity to be hung up in the sun, that I believe, hs.d wc been
-»t Alicant, where the raisins of the sun are cured, we should
have filled sixty or eighty barrels; and these, with our bread,
was a great part of our food, and very good living too, I assure
you; for it is an exceeding nourishing food.
It was now harvest, and our crop in good order It was
not the most plentiful increase I had seen in the island, but,
however, it was enough to answer our end; for from our
twenty-two bushels of barley, we brought in and threshed out
about two hundred and twenty bushels, and the like in pro-
portion of the rice, which was store enough for our food to
the next harvest, though all the sixteen Spaniards had been
on shore with me; or, if we had been ready for a voyage, ft
would very plentifully have victualled our ship, to have car-
ried us to any part of the world, that is to say, of America.
When we had thus housed and secured our magazine of corn,
we fell to work to make more wicker-work; viz great bas-
kets, in which we kept it: and the Spaniard was very handy
and dexterous at this part, and often blamed me, that I
did not make some things for defence, of this kind of work;
but I saw no need of it.
And now having a full supply of food for all the guests I
expected, I gave the Spaniard leave to go over to the main,
to see what he could do with those he had left behind him
there. I gave him a striot charge in writing not to bring any
man with him, who would not first swear in the presence of
himself, and of the old savage, that he would no way injure,
fight with, or attack the person he should find in the island,
who was so kind as to send for them, in order to their deliver-
anee; but that they would stand by and defend him against
all such attempts; and, wherever they went, would be entirely
under, and subjected to, his command; and that this should
be put in writing, and signed with their hands. How wo
were to have this done, when I knew they had neither
pen nor ink, that indeed was a question which we never
asked.
Under these instructions, the Spaniard, and the old sav-
age (the father of Friday,) went away in one of the canoes,
which they might be said to come in, or rather were brought
in, when they came as prisoners to be devoured by the
savages.
I gave each of them a musket, with a firelock on it, and
about eight charges of powder and ball, charging them to be
very good husbands of both, and not to use either of them
but upon urgent occasion.
This was a cheerful work, being the first measures used by
me, in view of my deliverance, for now twenty-seven years
and some days. I gave them provisions of bread, and of dried
grapes, sufficient for themselves for many days, and sufficient
fbr all their countrymen for about eight days time; and
wishing them a good voyage, I let them go, agreeing with
them about a signal they should hang out at their return, by
which I should know them again, when they came back, at a
distance, before they came on shore.
IFhey went away, with a fair gale, on the day that the moon.
was at the fall; by my account, in the month of October: •
but as for the exact reckoning of days, after I had once lost
it, I could never recover it again; nor had I even kept the
number of.years so punctually as to be sure that I was right,
though, as it proved, when I afterwards examined my account,
I found I had kept a true reckoning of years.
It was no less than eight days I wai^d for them, when a.
strange and unforeseen accident intervened, of which the like
has not, perhaps, been heard of in history. I was fast asleep
in my hutch one morning, when my man Friday came run-
ning in to me, and called aloud, ' Master, master, they are
come, they are come!'
I jumped up, and, regardless of danger, I went out, as
soon as I could get my clothes on, through my little grove,
which (by the way) was by this time grown to be a very
thick wood; I say, regardless of danger, I went without my
arms, which was not my custom to do; but I was surprised,
when, turning my eyes to the sea, I presently saw a boat, at
about a league and a half's distance, standing in for the shore,
with a shoulder-of-mutton sail, as they call it, and the wind
blowing pretty fair to bring them in. Also I observed pre-
sently, that they did not come from that side which the shore.
lay on, but from the southcrmost end of the island. Upon
this, I called Friday in, and bade him lie close, for these were
not the people we looked for, and that we did not know yet
whether they were friends or enemies.
In the next place, I went in to fetch my perspective glass,
to see what I could make of them; and having taken the.
ladder out, I climed up to the top of the hill, as I used to do
when I was apprehensive of any thing, and to take my view
the plainer, without being discovered.
I had scarce set my foot on the hill, when my eye plainly
discovered a ship lying at an anchor, at about two leagues.
and a half's distance from me, S. S. B. but not above a
league and a half from the shore. By my observation, it ap-
peared plainly to be an English ship, and the boat appeared
to be an English long-boat.
I cannot express the confusion I was in, though the joy of.
seeing a ship, and one which, I had reason to believe, was
manned by my own countrymen, and consequently friends,
was such as I cannot describe; but yet I, bad some ssej^t
T
doubts hung about me, I cannot tell from whence they came,
. biddmg me keep upon my guard. In the first place. it occur,
red to me to consider what business an English ship could
have in that part of the world, since it was not the way to or
from any part of the world where the English had any traffic;
and I knew there had been no storms to drive them in there,
as in distress; and that if they were English really, it was
most probable that they were here upon no good design, and
that I had better continue as I was, than fall into the hands
«(f thieves and murderers.
Let no man despise the seoret hints and notices of danger,
-which sometimes are given him, when he may think there is
no possibility of its being real. That such hints and notices
are given us, 1 believe few, that have made any obsertations of
things, can deny; that they are certain discoveries of an in-
visible world, and a converse of spirils, we cannot doubt; and
if the tendency ot them seems to be to warn us of danger,
why should we not suppose they are from some friendly
agent (whether supreme, or inferior and subordmate, is not
the question,) and that they are given for our good.
The present question abundantly confirms me in the jus-
tice of this reasoning; for had I not been made cautious by
this secret admonition, come it from whence it will, I had
been undone inevitably, and in a far worse condition than be-
fore, as you will see presently. ..
I had not kept my self long in this posture, when I saw
the boat draw near the shore, as if they had looked for a
ereek to thrust in at,for the convenience of landing: however,
as i hey did not come quite far enough, they did not see the
little inlet where- 1 formerly landed my rafts, but rua their
boston shore upon the beach, at about half a mile from me,
which was very happy for me; for otherwise they would have
lauded just, as I may say, at my door, and would soon have
beaten me out of my castle, and, perhaps, have plundered me
of aii I had.
When they were on shore, I «as fully satisfied they were
Englishmen, at least, most of them: one of two I thought were
Dutch, but.it did not prove so. There were in all eleven
men, whereof three I found were unarmed, and (as I thought)
bound; and when the first four or five of them were jumped
on shore, they took those three out of the boat as prisoners.
One of the three i eould perceive using the most passionate
gestures of entreaty, affliction, and despair, even to a kind of
extravagance; the other two I could perceive lifted up their
hands sometimes, and appeared concerned indeed, hut not
to such a degree as the first.
I was perfectly confounded at the sight, and knew not
-what the meaning of it should be. Friday called out to me,
in English, as well as he could, ' O master, you see English
mans eat prisoners as well as savage mans.' ' Why,' said I,
'Friday, do you think they are going to eat them then.' ' Yes,'
says Friday,' they will eat them.' ' No, no,' said I,' Friday;
I am afraid they will murder them indeed, but you may be
sure they will not eat them.'
All this while I had no thought of what the matter really
was, but stood trembli'g with the horror of the sight, expect-
ing every moment, when the three prisoners should be killed;
nay, once I saw one of the villains lift up his arm, with a gieat
cutlass (as the seamen call it) or sword, to strike one of the
poor men; and I expected to see him fall every momenut
which all the blood in my body seemed to run chill in^jpy
veins.
I wished heartily now for my Spaniard, and the savage that
was gone with him; or that I had any way to have come un-
discovered within shot of them, that I might have rescued
the three men; for I saw no fire arms they had among them:
but it fell out to my mind another way.
After I had observed the outrageous usage of the three
men, by the insolent seamen, I observed the fellows ran scat-
tering about the land as if they wanted to see the country* I
observed also, that the three other men had liberty to go
where they pleased; but they sat down all three upon the
ground very pensive, and looked like men in despair
This put me in mind of the first time when I came on
shore, and began to look about me: how I gave myself over
for lost, how wildly I looked around me, what dreadful ap-
prehensions I had, and how I lodged in the tree all night,
for fear of being devoured by wild beasts.
As I knew nothing that night of the supply I was to re-
ceive, by the providential driving of the ship nearer the land*
by the storms fcnd tide, by which I have since been so lung
nourished and supported; so these three poor, desolate men
knew nothing how certain of deliverance and supply thi'y
were, how near it was to them, and how effectually and real- -
Iy they were in a condition of safety, at the same time that
they thought themselves lost, and their case desperate.
So little do we see before us in the world, and so much
reason have we to depend cheerfully upon the great Maker
of the world, that he does not leave his creatures so absolute-
ly destitute, but that in the worst circumstances they have
always something to be thankful for, and sometimes are nearer
their deliverance than they imagine; nay, are even brought to
their deliverance by the means by which they seem to be
brought to their destruction.
It was just at the top of high-water when these people
came on shore, and while partly they stood parlying with the -
prisoners they brought, and partly while they rambled about
to see what kind of place they were in, they had carelessly
staid till the tide was spent, and the water was ebbed consid-
erably away, leaving their boat aground.
They had left two men in the boat, who, as 1 found after-
awards, having drank a little too much brandy, fell asleep,
HoVever, one of them waking sooner than the other, and
finding the boat too fast aground for him to stir it, hallooed
for the rest, who were straggling about, upon which they all
soon came to the boat, but it was past all their strength to
lanch her, the boat being very heavy, and the shore on that
side being a soft, oosy sand, almost like a quicksand.
In this condition, like true seamen, who are, perhaps, the
least of all mankind given to forethought, they gave itover, and
away they strolled about the country again; and I heard one
of them say aloud to another (calling them ofFfrom the boat),
•Why, let her alone, Jack, can't ye? She'll float next tide.' By
Which I was fully confirmed in the main inquiry, of what
countrymen they were.
All this while, I kept myself close, not once daring to stir
out of my castle, any farther than to my place of observation,
near the top of the hill; and very glad I was to think how well
it was fortified. I knew it was no less than ten hours before
the boat could be afloat again, and by that time it would be
dark, and I might be more at liberty to see their motions,
and to hear their discourse if they had any.
In the mean time, I fitted myself up for a battle, as before,
though with more caution, knowing I had to do with another
kind of enemy than I had at first I ordered Friday also,
whom I had made an excellent marksman with his gun, to
THECAPTAUrSrREBISBDBarROBlXSeHJr
load himself with arms. I took myself two fowling-pieces,
and I gave him three muskets. My figure indeed was very
fierce; I had my formidable goat-skin coat on, with the great
cap 1 have mentioned, a naked sword by my side, two p-.siols
in my belt, and a gun upon each shoulder.
It was my design, as I said above, not to have made any
attempt till it was dark; but about two o'clock, being the heat
of the day, I found, that, in short, they were all gone strag-
gling into the woods, and, as I thought, were all laid down to
sleep. The three poor distressed men, too anxious for their
condition to get any sleep, were, however, set down under the
shelter of a great tree, at about a quarter of a mile from me,
and, as I thought, out o>' sight of any of the rest.
Upon this, I resolved to discover myself to them, and learn
something of their condition. Immediate!* I marched, m
the figure above; my man Friday at a good distance behind
me, as formidable for his arms as I, but not making quite so
staring a spectre like figure as I did.
I came as near them undiscovered as I could, and then. be-
fore any of them saw me, I called aloud to them, in Spanish,
' What are ye, gentlemen?'
They started up at the noise, but were ten times more con-
founded when they saw me, and the uncouth figure th*t I
made. They made no answer at all, but I thoughL I per-
ceived them just going to fly from me, when I spoke to them
in English: ' Gentlemen,' said I, do not be surprised at me;
perhaps you may have a friend near you, when you did not
expect it.' ' He must be sent direotly from Heaven then,'
said one of them, very gravely to me, and pullmg oft" his hat
at the same time; ' for our conditiou is past the help of man.'
« All help is from Heaven sir,' said I. ' But can you put a
stranger in the way how to help you; for you seem to me to be
in some great distress? I saw you when you landed; and when
you seemed to make application to the brutes that came with
you, I saw one of them lift up his sword to kill you.'
The poor man, with tears running down his face, and
trembling, looking like one astonished, returned., ' Am 1 talk-
' ing to God or man? Is it a real man, or an angel?' Hie in no
fear about that, sir,' said I. 'If God had sent an angel to re-
lieve you, he would have come better clothed, and armed af-
ter another manner, than you see me. Pray lay aside your
/ears: I am a man, an Englishman, and disposed to assist you,.
T3 .
you see. I have one servant only; we hare arms and am-
munition. Tell us freely: can we serve you? .What is your
case?'
1 Our case,' said he,' sir, is too long to tell yon, while our
murderers are so near; but, in short, sir, I was commander of
that ship; my men having mutinied against me; they have
been hardily prevailed on not to murder me, and, at last,
have set me on shore in this desolate place, with these two
men with me, one my mate, the other a passenger, where we
expected to perish, believing the place to be uninhabited,
and know not yet what to think of it.'
' Where are those brutes, your enemies?' said I. * Do you
know where they are gone'' ' There they are, sir,' said he,
pointing to a thicket of trees. 'My heart trembles for fear
they have seen us, and heard you speak; if they have, they
will certainly murder us all.'
' Have they any fire-arms?' said I. He answered they had
only two pieces, and one which the> left in the boat. 'Well
then,' said I, ' leave the rest to me. I see they are all asleep.
It is an easy thing to kill them all: but shall we rather take
them prisoners!' lie told me there were two desperate vil-
lains among them, that it was scarce safe to show any mercy
to: but if they were secured, he believed all the rest would
return to their duty. I asked him which they were. He
told mi. he could not at that distance describe them; but he
'would obey my orders in any thing I would direct- 'Well,'
said I,' let us retreat out of their view or hearing, lest they
awake; and we will resolve farther. So they willingly went
back with me, till the woods covered us from them.
' Look you sir,' said I, ' if I venture upon your deliverance,
are you willing to make two conditions with me?' He anti-
cipated my proposals, by telling me, that both he and the ship,
if recovered, should be wholly directed and commanded by
me in'every thing; and if the ship was not recovered, he
-would live und die with me, in what part of the world soever
I would send him: and the tno other men said the same.
' Well,' said. I, ' my conditions are but two: first, That
-while you stay on this island with me, you will not pretend
to any authority here; and if I put arras into your hands, \n\x
-will upon all occasions, give them up to me, and do no preju-
dice to me or mine, upon this island} and, in the mean time;
Be governed by my orders.
Secondly, That if the ship is or may be recovered, you will
carry me and niv man to England passage-free.
He gave me all the assurances that the invention and faith
of man could devise, that he would comply with these most
reasonable demands; and, besides, would owe his life to me,
and acknowledge it upon all occasions as long as he lived.
' Well then,' said said I,' here are three muskets for you,
with powder and ball. Tell me next what you think is pro-
per to he done.' He showed all the testimony of his grati-
tude that he was able; but offered to be wholly guided by me.
I told him I thought it was hard venturing any thing, but the
best method I could think of, was to fire upon them at once,
as they lay; and if any were not killed at the first volley, and
offered to submit, we might save them, and so put it wholly
upon God's providence to direct the shot.
He said very modestly, that he was loath to kill them, if he
could help it; but that those two were incorrigible villains,
and had been the authors of all the mutiny in the ship; and if
they escaped, we should be undone still; for they would go
on board, and bring the whole ship's company, and destroy
us all. ' Well then,' said I,' necessity legitimates my advice;
for it is the only way to save our lives.' However, seeing him
still cautious of shedding blood, I told him they should go
themselves, and manage as they found convenient.
In the middle of this discourse, we heard some of them
awake, and soon after we saw two of them on their feet. 1
asked him if either of them were the men, who, he had said,
were the heads of the mutiny. He said,' No.' 'Well then,'
said I, ' you may let them escape; and Providence seems to
have wakened them on purpose to save themselves. Now,'
said I,' if the rest escape you, it is your fault'
Animated with this he took the musket I had given him
in his liand, and a pistol in his belt, and his two comrades
with him, with each man a piece in his hand. The two men,
who were with him, going first, made some noise, at which
one of the seamen, who was awake, turned about, and, seeing
them coming, cried out to the rest; but it was too late then,
for the moment he cried out, they fired, I mean the two men,
the captain wisely reserving his own piece. They had so
Veil aimed their shot at the men they knew, that one of them
was killed on the spot, and the other very much wounded;
but not being dead, he started up upon his feet, and called
eagerly for help to the other: but the captain, stepping to hi in
told him it was too late to cry for help; he should call upon
God to forgive his villain, and, with that word, knocked him
down, with the stock of his musket, so that he never spoke
more. There were three more in the company, and one of
them was also slightly wounded. By this time I was come;
and when they saw their danger, and that it was in vain to
resist, they begged for mercy. The captain told them, he
would spare their lives, if they would give him any assurance
of their abhorrence of the treachery they had been guilty of,
and would swear to be faithful to him in recovering the ship,
and afterwards in carrying her back to Jamaica, from whence
they came. They gave him all the protestations of their
sincerity that could be desired, and he was willing to believe
them, and spare their lives, which I was not against: only I
obliged him to keep them bound, hand and foot, while they
were upon the island.
While this was doing, t sent Friday, with the captain's mate,
to the boat, with orders to secure her, and bring away the
oars and sail, which they did; and, by-and-by, three stragglmg
men, that were (happily for them) parted from the rest,
came back, upon hearing the guns tired; and seeing their cap-
tain, who was before their prisoner, now their conqueror, they
submitted to be bound also; and so our victory was complete.
It now remained that the captain and I should inquire into
one another's circumstances. I began first, and told him my
whole history, which he heard with an attention even to
amazement, and particularly at the wonderful manner of
my being furnished with provisions and ammunition; and in-
deed, as my story is a whole collection of wonders, it affected
him deeply; but when he reflected from thence upon him-
self, and how I seemed to have been preserved there on pur-
pose to save his life, the tears ran dowu his face, and he could
not speak a word more.
After this communication was at an end, I earned him, and
his two men, into my apartment, leading them in just where
I came out, viz. at the top of the house, where I refreshed
them with such provisions as I had, and showed them all the
contrivances 1 had made, during my long, long inhabiting that
place.
All I showed them, all I said to them was perfectly ama-
zmg; but, above all, the captain admired my fortification, and
how perfectly I had concealed my retreat with a grove of
trees, which having been now planted near twenty years, and
the trees growing much faster than in England, was become a
little wood, and so thick that it was impassable in any part
of it, but at that one side where I had reserved my tittle
winding passage into it. This I told him was my castle, and
my residence; but that I had a seat in the country, as most
princes have, whither I could retreat upon occasion, and I
would show him that too another time; but at present our
business was to consider, how to recover the ship. He
agreed with me as to that; but told me, he was perfectly at a
loss what measures to take, for that there were still six-and-
twenty hands on board, who, having entered into a cursed
conspiracy, by which they had all forfeited their lives to the
law, would be hardened in it now by desperation, and would
carry it on, knowing that if they were reduced, they should
he brought to the gallows as soon as they came to England,
or to any of the English colonies; and that therefore there
would be no attacking them with so small a number as we
were.
I mused for some time upon what he had said, and found
it was a very rational conclusion; and that therefore some-
thing was to be resolved on very speedily, as well to draw the
men on board into some snare for their surprise, as to prevent
their landing upon us, and destroying us. Upon this it pre-
sently occurred to me, that, in a little while, the ship's crew,
wondering what was become of their comrades, and of the
boat, would certamly come on shore in their other boat, to
see for them; and that then, perhaps they might come
armed, and be too strong for us: this, he allowed was
rational.
Upon this I told him the first thing we had to do was to
stave the boat, which lay upon the beach, so that they might
not carry her off; and takingevery thing out of her, leave her
so far useless as not to be fit to swim. Accordingly we went
on board, took the arms which were left on board out of her,
-and whatever else we found there, which was a bottle of
brandy, and another of rum, a few biscuit cakes, a horn of
powder, and a great lump of sugar, in a piece of canvass;
the sugar was five or six pounds: all which was very welcome
to me, especially the brandy and sugar, of which I had had
pone left for many years.
When we had carried all these things on shore (the oars,
mast, sail, and rudder of the boat were carried away before,
as above,) we knocked a great hole in her bottom, that
if they had come strong enough to master us, yet they could
not carry off the boat
Indeed it was not much in my thoughts, that we could be
capable to recover the ship; but my view was, that if they
went away without the boat, 1 did not much question to make
her fit again to carry as away to the Leeward Islands, and
call upon our friends, the Spaniards, in my way; for I had
them still in my thoughts.
While we were thus preparing our designs, and bad first,
by main strength, heaved the boat up upon the beach, so high
that the tide would not float her otf at high-water mark; and,
besides, had broken a hole in her bottom too big to be quickly
stopped, and were sat down musing what we should do, we
heard the ship fire a gun, and saw her make a waft with her
ancient, as a signal for the boat to come on board; but no boat
stirred, and they fired several times, making other signals fojr
the boat.
At last, when all their signals and firings proved fruitless,
and they found the boat did not stir, we saw them (by the
help of my glasses) Hoist another boat out, and row towards
the shore; and we found, as they approached, that there
were no less than ten men in her, and that they had fire-arms
with them
As the ship lay almost two leagues from the shore, we had
a full view of them as they came, and a plain sight of the
men, even of their faces; because the tide having set them
a little to the east of the other boat, they rowed up under
shore, to come to the same place where the other boat had
landed, and where the boat lay.
By thte means, I say, we had a full view of them, and the
captain knew the persons and characters of all the men in
the boat, of whom he said that there were three very honest
fellows, who, he was sure, were led into this conspiracy by
the rest, being overpowered and frighted.
But that as for the boatswain, who, it seems, was the chief
officer among them, and all the rest, they were as outrageous
as any of the ship's crew; and were, no doubt, made despe-
rate in their new enterprise: and terribly apprehensive he was,
that they would be too powerful for us.
I smiled at him, and told him that men in our circumstances
-were past the operations of fear: that seeing almost every
condition that could he, was better than that which we were
supposed to be in, we ought to expect that the consequence,
whether death or life, would be sure to be a deliverance. I
asked him what he thought of the circumstances of my life;
and whether a deliverance were not worth venturing for.
' And where, sir,' said I, ' is your belief of my being preserv-
ed hereon purpose to save your life, which elevated you a
little while ago? For my part,' said f, ' there seems to be but
one thing amiss in all the prospect of it.9 ' V\ hat's that?'
said he. ' Why,' said I, ' 'tis that, as you say, there are three
or four honest fellows among them, which should be spared;
bad they been all of the wicked part of the crew, I should
have thought God's providence had singled them out, to de-
liver them into your hands; for, depend upon it, every man
of them that comes ashore are our own, and shall die or live,
as they behave to us.'
As I spoke this with a raised voice and cheerful counte-
nance, I found it greatly encouraged him; so we set vigorously
to our business. We had, upon the 6rst appearance of the
boat's coming from the ship, considered of separating our
prisoners, and had indeed secured them effectually.
Two of them, of whom the captain was less assured than
ordinary, I sent with Friday, and one of the three delivered
men, to my cave, where they were remote enough, and out
of danger of being heard or discovered, or of finding their way
out of the woods, if they could have delivered themselves.
Here they left them bound, but gave them provisions, and
promised them, if they continued there quietly, to give them
their liberty in a day or two; but that if they attempted their
escape, they should be put to death without mercy. They
promised faithfully to bear their confinement with patience,
and were very thankful that they had such good usage as to
have provisions, and a light left them; for Friday gave them
candles (such as we made ourselves) for their comfort: and
they did not know but that he stood centinel over them at the
entrance.
The other prisoners had better usage: two of them were
kept pinioned indeed, because the captain was not free to
trust them; but the other two were taken into my service,
upon their captain's recommendation, and upon their solemn-
ly engaging to live and die with us; so, with them and the
three honest men, we were seven men well armed; and I
made no doubt we should be able to deal well enough with
the ten that were a coming, considering that the captain
had said there were three or four honest men among them
also.
As soon as they got to the place where their other boat
lay, they ran their boat into the beach, and came all on shore,
hauling the boat up after them, which I was glad to see; for
I was afraid they would rather have left the boat at an an-
chor, some distance from the shore, with some hands in
her to guard her; and so we should not be able to seize the
boat.
Being on shore the first thing they did, they ran all to the
other boat and it was easy to sec they were under a great
surprise, to find her stripped, as above, of all that was in her,
and a great hole in her bottom.
After they had mused a while upon this, they set up two
or three great shouts, hallooing with all their might, to 07 if
they could make their companions hear; but it was all to no
purpose: then they came all close in a ring, and fired a volley
of their small arms, which indeed we heard, and the echoes
made the woods ring: but it was all one; those in the cave
we were sure could not hear, and those in our keeping,
though they heard it well enough, yet durst give no answer
to them.
They were so astonished at the surprise of this, that as
they told us afterwards, they resolved to go all on board
agam to their ship,' and let them know there, that the men
were all murdered, and the long-boat staved; accordingly
they immediately lanched their boat again, and got all of
them on board.
The captain was terribly amazed, and even confounded at
this, believing they would go on board the ship again, and set
sail, giving their comrades for lost, and so he should still lose
the ship, which he was in hopes we should have recovered:
but he was quickly as much frighted the other way.
They had not been long put off with the boat, but we per-
ceived them alf coming on shore again; but with this new
measure in their conduct, which, it seems, they consulted to-
gether upon; viz. to leave three men in the boat, and the res":
to go on shore, and go up into the country to look for their
fellows.
This was a great disappointment to us; for now we were at
a loss what to do, for our seizmg those seven men on shore
would be no advantage to us, if we et the boat escape, be-
cause they would then row away to the ship; and then the
rest of them would be sure to weigh, and set sail, and so our
hope of recovering the ship would be lost.
However. we had no remedy but to wait and see what the
issue of things might present. The seven men came on shore,
and the three who remained in the boat, put her off to a
good distance from the shore, and came to an anchor to wait
for them; so that it was impossible for us to come at them in
the boat.
Those that came on shore kept close together, marching
towards the top of the little hill, under which my habitation
lay; and we could see them plainly, though they could not
perceive us. We could have been very glad they would have
come nearer to us, so that we might have fired at them; or
that they would have gone farther off, that we might have
come abroad.
But when they were come to the brow of the hill, where
thev could see a great way into the valleys and woods, which
lay towards the north-east part, and where the island lay
lowest, they shouted and hallooed till they were weary, and
not caring, it seems, to venture far from the shore, nor far
from one another, they sat down together under a tree, to
consider of it. Had they thought fit to have gone to sleep
there, as the other party of them had done, they had done
the job for us; but they were too full of apprehensions of dan-
ger, to venture to go to sleep, though' they could not tell what
the danger was they had to fear neither.
The captain made a verj just proposal to me upon this
consultation of theirs, viz. that perhaps they would all lire a
volley again, to endeavour to make their fellows hear, and
that we should all sallv upon them, just at the juncture when
their pieces were all discharged, and they would certainly
yield, and we should have them without bloodshed. 1 liked
the proposal, provided it was done while we were near
enough to come up to them, before they could load their
pieces again
But this evint did not happen, and we lay still a long time,
U
very irresolute what course to take: at length I told them
there would be nothing to be done in my opinion till night; '
and then, if they did not return to the boat, perhaps we
might find a way to get between them and the shore, and so
might use some stratagem with them in the boat, to get them
en shore.
We waited a great while, though very impatient for their
removing, and were very uneasy; when, after long consulta-
tions, we saw them start all up, and march down toward the
sea. It seems, they had such dreadful apprehensions upon
them of the danger of the place, that they resolved to go
on board the ship again, give their companions over for
lost, and so go on with their intended voyage with the
ship.
As soon as I perceived them go towards the shore, I ima-
gined it to be as it really was, that they had given over their
search, and were for going back again; and the captain,
as soon as I told him my thoughts, was ready to sink at
the apprehensions of it: but I presently thought of a stra-
tagem to fetch them back again, and which answered my end
to a tittle.
I ordered Friday, and the captain's mate, to go over the
little creek westward, towards the place where the savages
tame on shore when Friday was rescued, and as soon as they
came to a little rising ground, at about half a mile's distance,
I bade them halloo as loud as they could, and wait till they
found the seamen heard them; that as soon as ever they
heard the seamen answer them, they should return it agam,
and then keeping out of sight, take a round, always an-
swering when the other hallooed, to draw them as far into
the island and among the woods as possible; and then wheel
about again to me, by such ways as 1 directed.
They were just going into the boat, when Friday and the
mate hallooed, and they presently heard them, and answer-
ing, run along the shore westward, towards the voice they
heard, when they were presently stopped by the creek,
where the water being up, they could not get over, and called
for the boat to come up, and set them over, as indeed I ex-
pected.
When they had set themselves over, I observed that the
boat being gone up a good way into the creek, and, as it
were, in a harbour within the land, they took one of the
three men oat of her to go along with them, and left only two
in the boat, having fastened her to the stump of a little tree
on the shore.
This was what I wished for, and immediately leaving Fri-
day and the captain's mate to their business, 1 took the rest
with me, and crossing the creek out of their sight, we surpri-
sed the two men before they were aware, one of them lying
on shore, and the other being in the boat: the fellow on shore
was between sleeping and waking, and going to start up, the
captain: who was foremost, ran in upon him, And knacked
him down, and then called out to him in the r at to yield, or
he was a dead man-
There needed very few arguments to persuade a single maa
to yield, when he saw five men upon him, and his comrade
knocked down; besides, this was, it seems, one of the three
who were not so hearty in the mutiny as the lest of the crew,
and therefore was easily persuaded not only to yield, but af-
terwards to join very sincerely with us.
In the mean time, Friday and the captain's mate so well
managed their business with the rest, that they drew them,
by hallooing and answering, from one hill to another, and
from one wood to another, till they not only heartily tired
them, but left them where they were very sure they could not
reach back to the boat before it was dark; and indeed they
-were heartily tired themselves also by the time they came
back to us.
We had nothing now to do but watch for them in the dark,
and to fall upon them, so as to make sure work of them.
It was several hours after Friday came back to me; before
they came back to their boHt; and we could hear the foremost of
them, long before they came quite up, calling to those behind
to come along, and could also hear them answer and com-
plain how lame and tired they were, and not able to come any
faster, which was very welcome news to us.
At length they came up to the boat; but it is impossible to
express their confusion when the found the boat fast aground
in the creek, the tide ebbed out, and their two men gone: we
could hear them call to one another, in a most lamentable
manner, telling one another they were gotten into an enchant-
ed island; that either there were inhabitants in it, and they
should all be murdered, or else there were devils or spirits in
it, and they should be all carried away and devoured.
They hallooed again, and called their two comrades by their
names a great many times, but no answer. After sometime
we could see them, by the Utile light there was, run about
wringing their hands, like men in despair; and that sometimes
they would go and sit down in the bo*t to rest ihemselves,
and then come ashore again, aud walk about again, and so the.
same thing over again.
My men would fain have had me given them leave to fall
upon them at once in the dark; but I was willing to takethem
at some advantage;, so to spare them, and kill as few of them
as I could; ant especially I was unwilling to hazard the killing
any of our ow » eft, knowing the other were very well armed.
I resolved to wait to see if they did not separate; and therefore
to make sure of them, I drew my ambuscade nearer, and Or-
dered Friday and the captain to creep upon their hands and
fee^ as close to the ground as they could, that they might uot
be discovered, and get as near them as they possibly cbuld,
before they offered to fire
They had not been ong in that posture, when the boatswain,
who was the principal ringleader of the mutmy, and who had
now shown himself the most dejected and dispirited of all the
rest, came walking towards them, with two more of their crew.
The captain was so eagar at having the principal rogue so
much in his power, that he could hardly have patience to let
him come so near as to be sure of him; for he only heard hiB
tongue before: but when they came nearer, the captain and
Friday, starting up on their feet, let fly at them.
The boatswain was killed upon the spot: the next man was
shot mto the body, and lell just by him, though he did not die
till an hour or two after; and the third ran for it.
At the noise of the fire, I immediately advanced with my
whole army, which was now eight men, viz myself, general-
issimo; Friday, my lientenant general; the captain and his two
men, and the three prisoners of war, whom we had trusted
with arms.
We came upon them indeed in the dark, so that they oould not
pee our number; and 1 made the man they had left m the boat,
who was now one of us, to call them byname, to try if I could
bring them to a parley, and so might perhaps reduce them to
terms, which fell out just as we desired: for indeed it was ea-
sy to think, as their condition then was, they would be very-
filing to capitulate. So he calls out, as loud as he couhlj to>
one of them, ' Tom Smith! Tom Smith!' Tom Smith an-
swered immediately, 'Who's that? Kobinson?'for it seems he
knew his voice. The other answered,' Aye,aye. for God's sake,
Tom Smith, throw down your arms, and yield; or you are all
dead men this moment!'
' Who must we yield to' where are they?' says Smith again.
' Here they are,' says he. ' Here is our captain, and fifty meu
with him, have been hunting you this two hours. The boat-
swain is killed, Will Frye is wounded, and I am a prisoner; and
if you do not yield, you are all lost.'
' Will they give us quarter then?' says Tom Smith, ' and
ve will yield.' 'I'll go and ask, if you'll promise to yield,'
says Kobinson. So he asked the captam, and the captain him-
self then calls out, ' You Smith, you know my voice: if you
lay down your arms immediately, and submit you shall have
your lives, all but Will Atkins.'
Upon this, Will Atkins cried out,' For God's sake, captain,
give me quarter! What have I done? They have been all as
bad asl!' which, by the way, was not true neither, for it seems
this Will Atkins was the first man that laid hold of the cap-
tain, when they first mutinied, and used him barbarously, in
tying his hands, and giving him injurious language. However,
the captain told him lie must lay down his arms at discretion,
and trust to the governor's mercy, by which he meant me: for
they all called mc.- governor.
In a word, they all laid down their arms, and begged their
lives. and I sent i he man that had parleyed with them, and two
more, who bound them all; and then my great army of fifty
men which, particularly with those three, were all but eight,
came up, and seized upon them all, and upon their boat, only
that I kept myself, and one more, out of sight, for reasons of
state.
Our next work was to repair the boat, and to think of seizing
the ship; and as for the captain, now he had leisure to parley
with them, he expostulated with them upon the villany of
their practises with him, and, at length, upon the farther wick-
edness of their design; anil how certainly it must bring them
to misery and distress in the end, and perhaps to the gallows.
They all appeared very penitent, and begged hard for their
lives. As for that, he told them they were none of his pri-
soners, but the commander's of the island; that they thought
thev had set him on shore in a barren, uninhabited island, but
17 3
it had pleased God so to direct them, that the island was in-
habited, and that the governor was an Englishman; th:it he
might hang them all there, if he pleased; but as he had given
them all quarter, he supposed he would send them to En-
gland to be dealt with there as justice required, except At-
kins, whom he was commanded by the governor to advise to
prepare for'death; for that he would be hanged in the morning.
Though this was all a fiction of his own, yet it had its de-
sired effect: Atkins fell upon his knees to beg the captain to
intercede with the governor for his life; and all the rest beg-
ged of him, for God's sake, that they might not be sent to En.
gland.
It now occurred to me that the time of our deliverance
was come, and that it would be a most easy thing to bring
these fellows in, tri be hearty in getting possession of the ship.
So I retired in the dark from them, that they might not see
what kind of a governor they had, and called the captain to
me. When 1 called, as at a good distance, one of the men
"Was ordered to speak again, and say to the captain, 'Captain,
the commander calls for you ' and presently the captain re-
plied, ' Tell his excellency, I am just a coming.' This more
perfectly amused them; and they all believed that the com-
mander was just by, with his fifty men.
Upon the captain's coming to me, I told him my project for
seizing the ship, which he liked of wonderfully well, and re-
solved to put it in execution the next morning.
But in order to execute it with more art, and to be secure of
success, I told him we must divide the prisoners, and that he
should go and take Atkins, and two more of the worst of
them, and send them pinioned to the cave where the oth~ers
lay. This was committed to Friday, and the two men who
came on shore with the captain.
They conveyed them to the cave, as to a prison; and it was
indeed a dismal place, especially to men in their condition.
The other I ordered to tny bower, as I called it, of which I
have given a full description; and as it was feoeed in, and they
pinioned, the place was secure enough, considering they were
upon their behaviour.
To these, in the morning, I sent the captain who was to enter
into a parley with them; in a word to try them, and tell me whe-
ther he thought they might be trusted or no, to go on board and
surprise the ship. lie talked to thera of the injury done him.,
of the condition they were brought to; and that though the
governor had given them quarter for their lives, as to the pre-
sent action, vet that if they were sent to England, they would
all be hanged in chains to be sure; but that if they would join
in so just an attempt, as to recover the ship, he would have
the governor's engagement for their pardon.
Any one may guess how readily such a proposal would be
accepted by men in their condition; they fell down on their
knees to the captain, and promised, with the deepest im-
precations, that thev would be faithful to him to the last'drop,
and that they should owe their lives to him, and would go
with him all over the world; that they would own him for a
father to them as lotjg as they lived.
' Well,' says the captain, * I must go and tell the governor
»hat you say, and see what I can do to bring him to consent
to it. So he bruught me an account of the temper he found
them in; and that he verily believed they would be faithful.
However, that we might be very secure, I told him he should
go back again, and choose out five of them, and tell them that
they should see that thev did not want men; but he would
take out those five to be his assistants, and that the go-
vernor would keep the other two, and the three that were
sent prisoners to the castle (my cave) as hostages, for the
fidelity of those five. and that if they proved unfaithful m the
execution, the five hostages should be hanged in chains alive
upon the shore
This looked severe, and convinced them, that the governor
-was in earnest However, they had no way left them but to
accept it; and it was now the business of the prisoners, as
much as of the captain, to persuade the other five to do their
duty.
Our strength was now thus ordered for the expedition.
First, The captain, his mate, and passenger Second, Then
the two .prisoners of the first gang, to whom, having their
characters from the captain, I had given their liberty, and
trusted them with arms. Third, The other two, whom.
I had kept till now in my bower pinioned; but, upon the
captain's motion, had now released Fourth, These five re-
leased at last; so that there were twelve in all, besides five we
kept prisoners in the cave for hostages.
I asked the captain, if he was willing to venture with these
hands on board the ship; for, as for me and my man Friday,
I did not think it was proper for us to stir, having seven men
left behind; and it was employment enough for us to keep
them'asunder, and supply them with victuals.
As to the five in the cave, 1 resolved to keep them fast;
but Friday went twice a day to them, to supply them with
necessaries; and I made the other two carry provisions to a
certain distance, where Friday was to take it.
When I showed myself to the two hostages, it was with the
captain, who told them I was the person the governor had
ordered to look after them, and that it was the governor's
pleasure they should not stir any where, but by my direction;
that if they did, they should be fetched into the castle, and
be laid in irons: so that as we never suffered them to see me
as governor, so I now appeared as another person, and spoke
of the governor, the garrison, the castle, and the like, upon
all occasions-
The captain now had no difficulty before him, but to fur-
nish his two boats, stop the breach of one, and man them.
He made his passenger captain of one, with four other men;
and himself, and his mate, and five more, went in the other.
And they contrived their business very well; for they came
up to the ship about midnight. As soon as they came within
call of the ship, he made Robinson hail them, and tell them
he had brought off the men and the boat, but that it was a
long time before they had found them, and the like,.holding
them in a chat, till they came to the ship's side: wfien^jhe
captam and the mate, entering first with their arms, imme-
diately knocked down the second mate and carpenter with
the butt-end of their muskets, being very faithfully seconded
by their men. They secured all the rest that were upon the
main and quarter-decks, and began to fasten the hatches to
keep them down who were below, when the other boat,
and their men entermg at the fore chains, secured the
forecastle of the ship, and the skuttle which went down
into the cook-room, making three men they found there
prisoners.
When this was done, and all safe upon the deck, the cap-
tain ordeied the mate, with three men, to break into the
round-house, where the new rebel captain lay, and, hating
taken the alarm, was gotten up, and, with two men and a boy,
had gotten fire arms in their hands; and when the mate, with
a crow, split open the door, the new captain and his men
253 '*
IXTERVIKW WITHTHBCAIilAUf
fired boldly among ihem, and wounded the mate with a muB'
ket ball, which broke his arm, and wounded two more of the
men, but killed nobody.
The mate, calling for help, rushed, however into the
round-house, wounded as he was, and, with his pistol, shot
the new captain through the head, the bullet entering at his
mouth, and came out again behind one of his ears; so that he
never spoke a word: upon which the rest yielded, and the
ship was taken effectually, without any more lives lost.
As soon as the ship was thus secured, the captain ordered
seven guns to be fired, which was the signal agreed upon with
me, to give me notice' of his success, which, you may be sure,
I was very glad to hear, having sat watching upon the shore
for it, till near two of the elock in the morning.
Having thus heard the signal plainly, I laid me down; an!
it having been a day of great fatigue to me, I slept very sound,
till I was something surprised with the noise of a gun: and
presently starting up, I heard a man call me by the name of
' Governor, governor;' and presently I knew the captain's
voice, when climbing up to the top of the hill, there he stood,
and pointing to the ship, he embraced me in his arms. ' My
dear friend and deliverer,' says he, ' there's your ship; for
she is all yours, and so are we, and ;ill that belong to her.' 1
east my eyes to the ship, and there she rode within little
more than half a mile of the shore; for they had weighed her
anchor as soon as they were masters of her, and the weather
being fair, had brought her to an anchor just against the
mouth of a little ereek; and the tide being up, the captain
had brought the pinnace in near the place where I first land-
ed my rafts, and so landed just at my door.
I was, at first, ready to sink down with the surprise; for I
saw my deliverance indeed visibly put into my hands, all
things easy, and a large ship just ready to carry me away,
whither I pleased to go. . At first, for some time, I was
not able to answer one word; but as he had taken me in
his arms, 1 held fast by him, or I should have fallen to the
ground.
He perceived the surprise, and immediately pulls a bottle
out of his pocket, and gave me a dram of cordial, which he
had brought on purpose for me. After I drank it, I sat
down upon the ground, and though it brought me to myself,
yet it was a good while before I could speak a word to him.
AH this while, the poor man was io as great an ecstacy as
I, only not under any surprise, as I was; and he said a thou-
sand kind, tender things to me, to compose and bring me to
myself; but such was the flood of joy in my breast, that it put
all my spirits into confusion: at last, it broke out into tears,
and in a little while after I recovered my speech.
Then I took my turn and embraced him as my deliverer;
and we rejoiced together, I told him, t looked upon him as a
man sent from heaven to deliver me, and that the whole-
transaction seemed to be a chain of wonders; that such
things as these were the testimonies we had of a secret hand
of Providence governing the world, and an evidence that the
eyes of an infinite power could search into the remotest
corner of the world, and send help to the miserable whenever
he pleased.
I forgot not to lift up my heart in thankfulness to Heaven;
and what heart could forbear to bless him; who had not only,
in a miraculous manner, provided for one in such a wilder-
ness, and in such a desolate condition, but from whom every
deliverance must always be acknowledged to proceed!
When we had talked a while, the captain told me he had
brought me some little refreshment, such as the ship afford-
ed, and such as the wretches, who had been so long his mas-
ters, had not plundered him of Upon this, he called aloud
to the boat. and bade his men bring the things ashore, that
were for the governor; and indeed it was a present, as if I
had been one, not that was to be carried away along with
them, but as if I had been to dwell upon the island still, and
they were to go without me.
First, he had brought me a case of bottles full of excellent
cordial waters, six large bottles of Madeira wine, the bottles
held two quarts a piece, two pounds of excellent good to-
bacco, twelve good pieces of the ship's beef, and six pieces of
pork, with a bag of pease, and about a hundred weight of
biscuit.
He brought me also » box of sugar, a box of flour, a bag
full of lemons. and two bottles of lime juice, and abundance
of other things. But, besides these, and what was a thousand
times more useful to rue, he brought me six clean, new shirts,
six very good neckcloths, two pair of gloves, one pair of
shoes, a hat, and one pair of stockings, and a very good
suit of clothes of his own, which had heen worn hut very
little: in a word, he clothed me from head to foot.
It was a very kind and agreeahle present, as any one may
imagine, to one in my circumstances; but never was any
thing; in the world of that kind so unpleasant; awkward, and
uneasy as it was to nte to wear such clothes at their first put-
ting on.
After these ceremonies past, and after all his goad things
were brought into my little apartment, we began to consult
what was to be done with the prisoners we hail; for it was
-worth considering, whether we might venture to take them
away with us or no, especially two of them, whom we knew"
to be incorrigible and refractory to the last degree; and the
aaplain said he knew that they were such rogues, that
there was no obliging them; and if he did carry them away,
it must be in irons, as malefactors. to be delivered over to
justice, at the first English colony he could come at; and I
found that the captain himself was very anxious about it.
Upon this, I told him, that, if he desired it, I durst under-
take to bring the two men he spoke of, to make it their own
request that he should leave them upon the island. ' I
should be very glad of that,' says the captain, ' with ah my
heart.'
' Well,' said I. I will send for them, and talk with them
for you.' So 1 caused Friday and the two hostages, for they
were now discharged, their comrades having performed their
promise; I say, I caused them to go to the cave, and bring up
the five men, pinioned as they were, to the bower, and keep
them there till I came.
After some time, I came thither, dressed in my new
habit, and now I was called governor again. Bemg all met,
and the captain wilb me, I eaused the men to be brought be-
fore me, and 1 told them I had had a full account of their
villanous behaviour to the captain, and how they had run away
with the ship, and were preparing to commit farther robbe-
ries but that Providence had ensnared them in their own
ways, and that they were fallen into the pit which they had
digged for others.
I let them know that, by my direction, the ship had been
seized; that she lay now in the road, and they might see by-
and liv, that their new captain had received the reward of
his villany; for that they might see him hanging at the
yard-arm.
That as to them, I wanted to know what they had to say,
.why I should uot execute them as pirates, taken in the fact,
as by my commission they could not doubt I had authority
to do
One of them answered in the name of the rest, that they
had nothing to say but this, that when they were taken, the
captain promised them their lives, and they humuly implored
my mercy But I told them I knew not what mercy to show
them; for, as for myself, I had resolved to quit the island
with all my men, and had taken passage with the captain to
go for England: and as for the captain, he could not carry
them to England, other than as prisoners in irons, to be tried
for mutiny and running away with the ship; the consequence
of which, they must needs know, would be the gallows: so
that I could not tell which was best for them, unless they had
a mind to take their fate in the island; if they desired that, I
did not care, as I had liberty to leave it. I had some incli-
nation to give them their lives, If they thought they could
shift on shore. They seemed very thankful for it; said they
would much rather venture to stay there, than to be carried
to England to be hanged: so I left it on that issue.
However, the captain seemed to make some difficulty of it,
as if he durst not leave them there. Upon this I seemed a
little angry with the captain, and told him that they were my
prisoners, not his; and that seeing I had offered them so
much favour, I would be as good as my word. and that if he
did not think fit to consent to it, I would set them at liberty
as I found them; and if he did not like that, he might take
them again, if he could catch them
Upon this they appeared very thankful, and I accordingly
set them at liberty, and bade them retire into the woods, to
the place whence they came, and 1 would leave them some
fire-arms, some ammunition, and some directions how they
should live very well, if the> thought fit
Upon this I prepared to go on hoard the ship; hut told the
captain thai I would stay that night to prepare my things,
and desired him to go on board in the mean time, and keep
all right mi the ship, anil send the boat on shore the next day
for me; ordering him in the mean time to cause the new cap-
tain who was killed, to be hanged at the yard-arm, that these
men might see him
When the captam was gone, I sent for the men up to me in
my apartment, and entered seriously into discourse with them
of their circumstances I told them, I thought they had
made a right choice; that if the captain carried them away,
they would certainly be hanged. I showed them the new
captain hanging at the yard-arm of the ship, and told them
they had nothing less to expect.
When they had all declared their willingness to stay, I
then told them, I would let them into the story of my living
there, and put them into the way of making it easy to them.
Accordingly I gave them the whole history of the place, and
of my coming to it; showed them my fortifications, the way
I made my bread, planted my corn, cured my grapes; and in
a word, all that was necessary to make them easy. I told
them the story also of the sixteen Spaniards that were to be
expected; for whom 1 left a letter, and made them promise
to treat them in common with themselves.
I left them my fire-arms; viz. five muskets, three fowling-
pieces, and three swords. I had about a barrel and a half of
powder left; for after the first year or two I used but little,
and wasted none. 1 gave them a description of the way I
managed the goals, and directions to milk and fatten them, to
made both butter and cheese.
In a word, I gave them every part of my own story; and
1 told them I would prevail with the captain to leave them
two barrels of gunpowder more, and some garden-seeds,
.which I told them t would have been very glad of, also I gave
them the bag of pease which the captain had brought me to
eat, and bade them be sure to sow and increase them.
Having done all this, 1 left them the next day, and went
on board the ship. We prepared immediately to sail, hut did
not weigh that night. The next morning early, two of
the five men came swimming to the ship's side, and, making a
most lamentable complaint of the other three, begged to be
taken into the ship, for God's sake, for they should be mur-
dered; and begged the captain to take them on board, though
he hanged them immediately.
Upon this. the captain pretended to have no power without
roe; but after some difficulty, and after their solemn pro-
mises of amendment, they were taken on board, and were
X
, some time after soundly whipped and pickled; after which
they proved very honest and quiet fellows.
Some time after this, I went with the boat on shore, the
tide being up, with the things promised to the men, to which
the captain, at my intercession, caused their chests and
clothes to be added, which they took, and were very thankful
for ) also encouraged them, by telling them that if it lay
in my way to send any vessel to take them in, I would not
forget them.
When I took leave of this island, I carried on board, for
relics, the great goat-skin cap I had made, my umberella,
and one of my parrots; also I forgot not to take the money
I formerly mentioned, which had Iain by me so long useless,
that it was grown rusty, or tarnished, and could hardly
pass for silver, till it bad been a little rubbed and handled;
and also the money I found in the wreck of the Spanish
ship.
.\nd thus I left the island, the nineteenth of December, as
I found, by the ship's account, in the year 1686, after I had
oeen upon it eight-and twenty years, two months, and nine-
teen days; being delivered from the second captivity the same
clay of the month that I first made my escape in the barco-
longo, from among the Moors of Sallee.
In this vessel, after a long voyage, I arrived in England the
eleventh of June, in the year 1687, having been thirty-and-
five years absent.
When I came to England, I was as perfect a stranger to
all the world, as if I had never been known there. My bene-
factor, and faithful steward, whom I had left in trust with my"
money, was alive, but had had great misfortunes in the world,
-was become a widow the second time, and very low in the
world. I made her easy as to what she owed me, assuring
her I would give her no trouble; but, on the contrary, in
gratitude to her former care and faithfulness to me, I reliev-
ed her as mv little stock would afford, which at that time
would indeed allow me to do but little for her; but 1 assured
her I would never forget her former kmdness to me: nor did
I forget her, when I had sufficient to help her, as shall be
observed in its place.
I went down afterwards into Yorkshire; but my father
was dead, and my mother, and all the family extinct, except
thai I found two sisters, and two of the children of one of my
brothers; and asl had been long ago given over for dead, there
had been no provision made for me, so that, in a word, I
found nothing to relieve or assist me; and that the little mo-
ney I had, would not do much for me, as to settling in the
world.
I met with one piece of gratitude, indeed, which I did not
expect; and this was, that the master of the ship, whom I
had so happily delivered, and, by the same means, saved the
ship and cargo, having given a very handsome account to the
owners of the manner how I had saved the lives of the mea
and the ship, they invited me to meet them, and some other
merchants concerned, and all together made me a very hand-
some compliment upon the subject, and a present of almost two
hundred pounds sterling.
But after making several reflections upon the circumstances
of my life, and hnw little way this would go toward settling
me in the world, 1 resolved to go to Lisbon, and see if I might
not come by some information of the slate of my plantation
in the Brasils, and ot what was become of my partner, who I
had reason to suppose, had some years now given me over
for dead.
With this view, I took shipping for Lisbon, where I arrived
in April following: my man Friday accompanying me very
honestly in - all these ramblings, and proving a most faithful
servant upon all occasions.
When I came to Lisbon, I found out by inquiry, and to my
particular satisfaction, my old friend, the captain of the ship,
who first took me up at sea, off the shore of A trie. He was
nou grown old, and had left off the sea, having put his son,
who was far from a young man, into his ship, and who still
used the Brasil trade The old man did not know me, and
indeed I hardily knew him; but I soon brought myself to his
remembrance, when I told him who I was.
\fter some passionate expressions of our old acquaintance,
I inquired, you may be sure, after my plantation and my
partner. The old man told me he had not been in the Bra-
sils for about nine years; but that he could assure me, that
when he came away my partner was living, but the trustees,
whom 1 had joined with him to take cognisance of my part,
were both dead; that, however, he believed that I would have
a very good account of the improvement of the plantation, for
that, upon the general belief of my being cast away and.
drowned, my trustees had given in the account of the pro-
duce of my part of the plantation to the procurator fiscal, who
had appropriated it, in case I never came to claim it, one
third to the king, and two thirds to the monastery of St.
Augustine, to be expended for the benefit of the poor, and
for the conversion of the Indians to the catholic faith; but
that if I appeared, or any one for me, to claim the inheritance,
it would be restored; only that the improvement, or annual
production, being distributed to charitable uses, could not be
restored: but he assured me, that the steward of the king's
revenue (from lands), and the provedore, or steward of the
monastery, had taken great care all along, that the incumbent,
that is to say, my partner, gave every year a faithful account
of the produce, of which they received duly my moiety
I asked him if he knew to what height of improve ment he
had brought the plantation; and whether he thought it might
be worth looking after; or whether, on my going thither, I
should meet with no obstruction to my possessing my just
right in the moiety.
He told me he could not tell exactly to what degree the
plantation was improved; but this he knew, that my partner
was grown exceeding rich upon the enjoying but one half of
it; and that, to the best of his remembrance, he had heard
that the king's third of my part, which was, itseems, granted
away to some other monastery, or religious house, amounted
to above two hundred moidores, a year; that, as to my being
restored to the quiet possession of it, there was no question to
be made of that, my partner being alive to witness my title,
and my name being also enrolled in the register of the coun-
try. Also he told me, that the survivors of my two trustees
were very fair, honest people, and very wealthy; and he be-
lieved I would not only have their assistance for putting me
in possession, but would find a very considerable sum of mo-
ney in their hands, for my account, being the produce of the
farm, while their fathers -held the trust, and before it was
given up, as above, which, as he remembered, was for about
twelve years.
I shewed myself a little concerned and uneasy at this ac-
count, and inquired of the old captain how it came to pass
that the trustees should thus dispose of my effects, when he
knew that I had made my will, and had made him, the Por-
tuguese captain, my universal heir, etc.
He told me that was true, but that as there was no proof of
my being dead, he could not act as executor, until some certain
account should come of my death; and that, besides, he was
not willing to intermeddle with a thing so remote: that it was
true, he had registered my will, and put in his claim; and
could he have given any account of my being dead or alive,
he would have acted by procuration, and taken possession of
the ingenio (so they called the sugar house), and had given his
son, who was now it Brasils, order to do it.
' But,' says the old man. ' I have one piece of news to tell
you, which perhaps may not be so acceptable to you as the
rest, and that is, that, believing you were lost, and all the
world believing so also, your partner and trustees did offer to
account to me, in your name, for six or eight of the first years
of profits, which I received; but there being at that time,' sayi
he, * great disbursements for increasing the works, building
an ingenio, and buying slaves, it did not amount to near so
much as afterwards it produced. However,' says the old man,
' I shall give you a true account of what I have received in all,
and how I have disposed of it.' /
After a few days farther conference with this ancient friend,
he brought me an account of the first six years' income of my
plantation, signed by my partner, and the merchant's trustees,
being always delivered in goods; viz. tobacco in roll, and su-
gar in chests, besides rum, molasses, &e which is the conse-
quence of a sugar work; and I found, by this account, that
every year the income considerably increased. But, as above,
the disbursement being large, the sum at first was small.
However, the old man let me see that he was debtor to me
four hundred and seventy moidores of gold, besides sixty
chests of sugar, and fifteen double rolls of tobacco, which
were lost in bis ship, he having been shipwrecked coming'
home to Lisbon, about eleven years after my leaving the
place.
The good man then began to complain of his misfortunes,
and how he had been obliged to make use of my money to
recover his losses, and buy him a share in a new ship. ' How-
ever, my old friend,' says he,' you shall not want a supply in
your necessity; and as soon as my son returns, you shall be
fully satisfied. ^
Upon this he pulls out an old pouch, and giyf^pe one
hundred and sixty Portugal moidores in gold; and giving me
X2
the writings of his title to the ship which his son was gone to
the Brasils in, of which he was a quarter-part owner, and his
son another, he pats them both into my hands for security of
the rest.
I was too much moved with the honesty and kindness of
the poor man, to be able to bear this; and remembering what
he had done for me, how he had taken me up at sea, and how
generously he had used me on all occasions, and particularly
how sincere a friend he was now to me, I could hardily re-
frain from weeping at what he said to me. Therefore, first
I asked him if his circumstances admitted him to spare so
much money at that time, and if it would not straiten him.
He told me he could not say but it might straiten him a lit-
tle: but, however, it was my money, and I might want it more
than he.
Every thing the good man said was full of affection, and I
could hardly refrain from tears while he spoke. In short, I
took one hundred of the moidores, and called for a pen and
ink to give him a receipt for them; then I returned him the
rest, and told him, if ever I had possession of the plantation,
I would return the other to him also, as indeed I afterwards
did; and that, as to the bill of sale of his part in his son's
ship, I would not take it by any meaus; but that if I wanted
the money, 1 found he was honest enough to pay me; and if I
did not, but came to receive what he gave me reason to expect,
I would never have a penny more from him.
When this was passed, the old man began to ask me, if he
should put me in a method to make my claim to my planta-
tion. I told him, I thought to go over to it myself. He said,
I might do so, if I pleased; but that if I did not, there were
ways enough to secure my right, and immediately to appro-
priate the profits to my use; and as there were ships in the
river of Lisbon, justTeady to 40 away to Brasil, he made me
enter my name in a public register, with his affidavit, affirm-
ing, upon oath, that I was alive, and that 1 was the same per-
son who took up the land for the planting the said plantation
at first.
This being regularly attested by a notary, and a procura-
tion affixed, he directed me to send it with a letter of his
writing, to a merchant of his acquaintance at the place: and
then proposed my slaying with him till an account came of
the return.
Never any thing was more honourable than the procenl-
'fhgs upon this procuration; for in less than seven months I
received a large packet from the survivors of my trustees,
the merchants for whose account I went to sea, in which were
the following particular letters and papers enclose'::
First, There was the account current of the produce of my
farm, or plantation, from the year when their fathers had
balanced with my old Portugal captain, being for six years:
the balance appeared to be one thousand one hundred and
seventy-four moidores in my favour.
Secondly, There was the account of four years more, while
they kept the effects in their hands, before the government
claimed the administration, as being the effects of a person
not to be found, which they call civil death; and the balance
of this, the value of the plantation increasing, was to an
amount in crusadoes, which made three thousand two hun-
dred and forty-one moidores.
Thirdly, There was the prior of the Augustine's account,
who had received the profits for above fourteen years; but
not being able to account for what was disposed to the hos-
pital, very honestly declared he had eight hundred and seven-
ty-two moidores not distributed, which he acknowledged to
my account As to the king's part, that refunded nothing.
There was also a letter of my partner's congratulating mo
very affectionately upon my being alive, giving me an account
how the estate was improved, and what it produced a year,
with a particular of the number of squares or acres that it
contained: how planted; how many slaves there were upon it;
and, making two-and-twenty crosses for blessings, told me he
had said so many ' Ave Marias,' to thank the Blessed Virgin
that I was alive; inviting me very passionately to come over
and take possession of my own; and, in the mean time, to give
him orders to whom he should deliver my effects, if I did not
come myself; concluding with a hearty tender of his friend-
ship, and that of his family: and sent me, as a present, seven
fine leopards' skins, which he had, it seems, received from
Africa, by some other ship, which he had sent thither, and
who, it seems, had made a better voyage than I. He sent me
also five chests of excellent sweatmeats, and a hundred pieces
of gold uncoined; not quite so large as moidores.
By the same fleet, my two merchant-trustees shipped me
twelve hundred chests of sugar, eight hundred rolls of tobacj''
oo, and the rest of the whole account in gold.
I might well say now, indeed, that the latter end of Job
was better than the begmning. It is impossible to express
the flntterings of my very heart, when I looked over these
letters. and especially when I found all my wealth about me;
for as the Brasil ships come all in fleets, the same ships which
brought my letters brought my goods; and the effects were
safe in the Tagus before the letters came to my Tiand. In a
.word, I turned pale, and grew sick; and had not the old man
*un and fetched me a cordial, 1 believe the sudden surprise of
joy had overset nature, and I had died upon the spot.
Nay, after that, I continued very ill, and was so some hours,
till a physician beingsentfor, and something of thereat cause
of my illness being known, tie ordered me to be let blood;
after which I had relief, and grew well, but I verily beiieve,
if it had not been eased by the vent given in that manner to
the spirits, I should have died.
I was now master, all on a sudden, of above five thousand
pounds sterling in money, and had an estate, as 1 might well
eall it, in the Brasils, of above a thousand pounds a year, as
sure as an estate of lands in England; and, in a word, I was
in a condition which I scarce knew how to understand, or
how to compose myself for the enjoyment of.
The first thing I did, was to recompense my original bene-
factor, my good old captain, who had been first charitable to
me in my distress, kind to me in the beginning, and honest
to me at the end. I showed him all that was sent me. I
told him that, next to the providence of Heaven, which dis-
poses all things, it was owing to him; and that it now lay on
me to reward him, which I would do a hundredfold. So I
first returned to him the hundred moidores I had received
from him: then I sent for a notary, and caused him to draw up
a general release, or discharge, for the four hundred and
seventy moidores, which he had acknowledged he owed me,
in the fullest and firmest manner possible; after which I caused
a procuration to be drawn, empowermg him to be my re-
ceiver of the annual profits of my plantation, and appointing
my partner to account to him, and make the returns by the
usual fleets to him in my name. \nd a clause in the end,
heing a grant of one hundred moidores a year to him, during
his life, out of the effects; and fifty moidores a year to his son
after him. for his life: and thus I requited my old man.
I was now to consider which way to steer my course next,
and what to do with the estate that Providence had thus put
iato my hands; and, indeed, I had more care upon my head
now, than I had in my s lem state of life in the island, where
I wanted nothing hut what I had, and had nothing but what
I wanted; "whereas I had now a great charge upon me, and
my business was how to secure it. I had ne'er a cave now to
hide my mtytey in, or a place where it might lie without lock
or key, till it grew mouldy and tarnished before any body
vould meddle with it: on the contrary, I knew not where to
put it,' or whom to trust with it; my old patron the captain
indeed was honest, and that was the only refuge I had.
In the next place, my interest in the Brasils seemed to
summon me thither; but now I could not tell how to think of
gomg thither till I had settled my affairs, and left my effects
in some safe hands behind me. At first, I thought of my old
friend the widow, whom I knew was honest, and would be
just to me. but then she was in years, and but poor, and, tor
aught I knew, might be in debt. so that, in a word, 1 had no
w:!i but to go back to England myself, and take my effects
wiih me
I was some months, however, before I resolved upon this;
and therefore as I had rewarded the old captain fully, and to
his satisfaction, who had been my former benefactor, so I
began to think of my poor widow, whose husband had been
my first benefactor, and she, while it was to her power, my
faithful steward and instructor. So the first thing I did, I got
a merchant in Lisbon to write to his correspondent in Loudon,
not only to pay a bill. but to go find her out, and carry her in
money a hundred pounds from me, and to talk with her, and
oomfort her m her poverty, by telling her, she should, if I
lived, have a further supply. \i the same time, I sent my
two sisters in the country, each of them, a hundred pounds,
they being, though not in want, yet not in very good circum-
stances: one having been married, and left a widow, and-the
other having a husband, not so kind to her as he should be-
But among all my relations or acquaintance I could not yet
pitch upon one, to whom I durst commit the gross of my
stock, that I might go away to the Brasils, and leave things
safe behind me; and this greatly perplexed me.
I had once a mind to have gone to the Brasils, and have
settled myself there: for I was, as it were naturalized to the
place; but I had some little scruple in my mind about reli-
gion, which insensibly drew me back,. ot which 1 shall say
more presently. However, it was not religion that kept me
from going thither for the present; and as I had made no
scruple of being openly of the religion of the country all the
while 1 was among them, so neither did I yet, only that now
and then having of late thought more of it than formerly,
when I began to think of living and dying among them, I
hegan to regret my having professed myself a papist, and
thought it might not be the best religion to die with.
But, as I have said, this was not the main thing that kept
me from going to the Brasils, but that really I did not know
with whom to leave mv effects behind me; so I resolved at
last to gn to England with them, where, if I arrived, I con-
cluded 1 should make some acquaintance, or find some rela-
tions thai would be faithful to me: and accordingly I prepa-
red to go for England with all my wealth.
In order to prepare things for my going home, 1 first (tha
Brasil fleet being just going away) resolved to give anwers
suitable to the just and faithful account of things I had from
thence. \nd first to the prior of St Augustine I wrote a let-
ter full of thanks for his just dealings, and the offer of the
eight hundred and seventy-two moidores, which was undis-
posed of, which I desired might be given, fire hundred to
the monastery, and three hundred and seventy-two to the poor,
as the prior should-direct; desiring the good padre's prayers
fo' me; and the like.
I wrote next a letter of thanks to my two trustees, with
all the acknowledgement that so much justice and honesty
called for; as for sending them any present, they were &r
above having any occasion for it.
Lastly, I wrote to my partner, acknowledging his industry
m the improving the plantation, and his integrity in increasing;
the stock of the works, giving him instructions for his future
government of my part, according to the powers I had left
with my old patron, to whom 1 desired him to send whatever
became due to me, till he should hear from me more particu-
larly; assuring him that it was my intention not only to come
to him, hut to settle myself there for the remainder of ray
life: to this I added a very handsome present of some Italian
silks for his wife and two daughters, for such the captain's
son informed me he had; with two pieces of fine English
broad-cloth, the best I could get m l,:sbon, five pieces oC
black baiie, and some i'landers lace of a good quality.
Haling thus settled my affairs, sold my cargo, and turned
all my effects into good bills of exchange, my next difficulty
was, which way to go to England. I had been accustomed
enough to the sea, and yet I had a strange aversion to go to
England by sea at that time. and though 1 eould'give no rea-
son for it, yet the difficulty increased upon me so much, that
though I bad once shipped my baggage m order to go, yet I
altered my mind, and that not once, but two or three times.
It is true, I had. been very unfortunate by sea, and this
might be one of the reasons' but let no man slight the strong
impulses of his own thoughts in cases of such moment. Two
of the ships which I had singled out to go in, I mean more
particularly singled out than any other, that is to say, so as
in one of them to put my things on board, and in the other to
have agreed with the captain; I say, two of these ships mis-
carried, viz. one was taken by the Algerines, and the other
was cast away on the Start near Torbay, and all the people
drowned except three: so that in either of those vessels I had
been made miserable, and in which most, it was hard to say.
Having been thus harassed in my thoughts, my old pilot,
to whom I communicated every thing, pressed me earnestly
not to go by sea; but either to go by land to the Groyne, and
cross over the bay of Biscay to Rochelle, from whence it was
but an easy and safe journey by land to Paris and so to Calais
and Dover; or to go up to Madrid. and so all the way by land
through France.
In a word, I was so prepossessed against my going by sea
at all, except from Calais to Dover, that I resolved to travel
all the way by laud, which, as I was not in haste, and did not
value the charge, was by much the pleasanter way; and to
make it more so, my old captain brought an English gentle-
man, the son of a merchant in Lisbon, who Was willing to
travel with me: after which, we picked up two more, who
were English, and merchants also, and two young Portuguese
gentlemen, the last going to Paris only; so that we were in
all six of us. and five servants: the two merchants, and the
two Portuguese, contenting themselves with one servant be-
tween two, to save the charge. and as for me, 1 got an En-
glish sailor to travel with me as a servant, besides my man
Friday, who was too much a stranger to be capable of sup-
ply ing the place of a servant upon the road.
In this manner I set out from Lisbon: and our company
being all very well mourned and armed, we made a little
troop, -whereof they did nie the honour to call me Captain*.
as well because I was the oldest man, as because I had twe
servants, and indeed, was the original of the whole journey.
\a I have troubled you withinone of my sea journals, so
shall I trouble you with none of lit> land journal: but some
adventures that happened to us in this tedious and difficult
journey, I must not omit
When we came to Madrid, we being all of us strangers to
Spain, were willing to stay some time to see the court of
Spain, and to see what was worth observing: but it being the
latter part of the summer, we hastened away, and set out
from Madrid about the middle of October Hut when we
came to the edge of Navarre, we were alarmed at several
towns on the way, with an account that so much snow was
fallen on the French side of the mountains that several
travellers were obliged to come hack to Pampeluna, after ha-
ving attempted, at an extreme hazard, to pass on
When we came to Pampeluna, itself, we found it so indeed;
and to me, that had been always used to a hot climate, and
indeed to countries where we could scarce bear any clothes
on, the cold was insufferable. Nor indeed was it more pam-
ful than it was surprising, to come but ten days before out of
the Old Castile, where the weather was not only warm, but
very hot: and immediately to feel a wind from the Pyrenean
mountains, -.oveiy keen, so severely cold, as to be intolerable,
and to endanger benumbing and perishing of our fingers and
toes.
Poor Friday was really frighted when he saw the moun-
tains all covered with snow. and felt cold weather, which he
hat) never seen or felt before in his life
To mend the matter after we came to Pampeluna, it con-
tinued snowmg with so much violence, and so long, that the
people said winter was come before its time, and the roads,
which were difficult before, were now quite impassable; in a
word, the snow lay in some places too thicK for us to travel;
and being not hard frozen, as is the case in northern countries,
there was no going without being in danger of being buried
alivt every step. We staid no less than twenty days at Pam-
peluna, (when seeing the winter coming on, and no likelihood
of its being better, for it was the severest winter all over Eu-
rope that had been known in man; years) I proposed that we
should all go away to Fontarabia, and there take shipping for
Bourdeaux, which was a very little voyage.
But while we were considering this, there came in four
French gentlemen, who, having been stopped on the French
side of the passes, as we were on the Spanish, had found out
a guide, who traversing the country near the head ef Langue-
doc, had brought them over the mountains by such ways, that
they were not much incommoded with the snow; and where
they met with snow in any quantity, they said it was frozen
hard enough to bear them. and their horses.
We sent for this guide, who told us, he would undertake to
carry us the same way, with no hazard from the snow, pro-
vided we were armed sufficiently to protect us from wild
beasts; for he said, upon these great snows, it was frequent
for some wolves to show themselves at the foot of the moun-
tains. being made ravenous for want of food, the ground being
covered with snow. We told him we were well enough pre-
pared for such creatures as they were, if he wonld ensure us
from a kind of two-legged wolves, which we were told we were
in most danger from, especially on the French side of the
mountains
He satisfied us there was no danger of that kind in the way
that we were to go. So we readily agreed to follow him; as
did also twelve other gentlemen, with their servants, some
French, some Spanish, who, as I said, had attempted to go, aud
were obliged to come back again.
Accordingly we all set out from Pampeluna. with our guide,
on the fifteenth of November; and indeed, I was surprised,
when, instead of going forward, he came directly back with
us, on the same road that we came from Madrid, above twenty
miles; when having passed two rivers, and come mto the plain
country, we found ourselves m a warm climate again, where
the country was pleasant, and no snow to be seen; but on a
sudden, turning to the left, he approached the mountains
another way; and though it is true, the hills and the precipices)
looked dreadful, yet he made so many tours, such meanders,
and led us by such windmg ways, we were insensibly passed
the height of the mountains, without being much encumber-
ed with the snow; and, all on a sudden he showed us the
pleasant fruitful provinces of Languedoc and Gascoigne, all
green anil flourishing; though indeed they were at a great
disjunct-, and we had some rough way to pass vet.
We were a little uneasy, however, when we found it snow-
ed one v. hole day, and at night so fast that we could not travel;.
hul he bade us be easy, we should soun be past it all. We
found indeed, that we began to descend every day, and to
come more north than before: and so, depending upon our
guide, we went on.
It was about two hours before night, when our guide being
something before us, and not just in sight, out rushed three
monstrous wolves. and after them a bear, out of a hollow way,
adjoinmg to a thick nood. Two of the wolves flew upon the
guide, and bad he been half a mile before us he had been dc-
voured mdeed, before we could have helped him. One of
them fastened upon his horse, and the other attacked the
mini with that violence, that he had not time, or not presence
of mind enough, to draw his pistol, but hallooed and cried nut
to us most lustily. My man Friday being next to me, I bade
him ride up, and see what was the matter. As soon as Fri-
day came in sight of the man, he hallooed as loud as the
other, ' O master! O master?' but, like a bold fellow, rode
directly up to the man, and, with a pistol, shot the wolf that
attacked him into the head.
It was happy for the poor man that it was my man Friday;
for he, having been used to that kind of creature in lis coun-
try, had no fear upon him, but went close up to him, and shot
him as ahove: whereas any of us would have fired at a farther
distai.ee, anil have, perhaps, either missed the wolf, or en-
dangered shooting the man.
Bui it was enough to have terrified a bolder man than I;
and indeed it alarmed all our company, when, with the noise
of Friday's pistol, wi- heard on both sides the dismalcst howl-
ing of wolves, and the noise redoubled by the echo of the
mountams, that il was to us as if there had been a prodiginui
multitude of them; and perhaps indeed there were not such
a few, as that we had no cause of apprehensions.
However, as Friday had killed this wolf, the other, that had
fastened upon the horse, left him immediately, and fled, hav-
ing happily fastt ned upon his head, where the bosses of the
bridle had stuck in his teeth, so that he had not done him
much hurt. The man, mdeed, was most hurt; for the raging
creature had bit him twice, once on the arm, and the other
time a Tittle above his knee; and he was just, as it were,
tumbling down bv the disorder of his horse, when Friday
nmc up, and shot the wolf.
It is easy to suppose, that at the noise of Friday's pistol we all
mended our pace, and rid up, as fast as the way (which was
ver> difficult) would give us leave, to see what was the matter.
As soon as we came clear of the trees, which blmded us be-
fore, we saw plainly what hud been the case, and how Friday
had disengaged the poor guide; though we did not presently
discern what kind of creature it was he had killed-
Hut never was a fight managed so hardily, and in such a
surprising manner, as that which followed between Friday'
and the bear, which gave us all (though at first we were sur-
prised and afraid for him) the greatest diversion imaginable.
As the bear is a heavy, clumsy creature, and does not gultcp
as the wolf docs, which is swift and light; so he has two par-
ticular qualities, which generally are the rule of his actions.
First, as to men, who are not his proper prey I say, not his
proper prey, because, though I cannot say what excessive
hunger might do, which was now their case, the ground being
all coveted with snow; yet, as to men, he does not usually at"
tempt them, unless they first attack him: on the contrary, if
you meet him in the woods, though if you do not meddle w,th
him, he will not meddle with you, yet then you mus' take
care to be very civil to him, and give him the road; for be is
a very nice gentleman. he will not go a step out of his way for <
a prince; nay, if you are really afraid, your best way is to look
another way, and. keep going on: for sometimes if you stop
and stand still, and look steadfastly at him, he takes it for an
affront; but if you throw or toss any thing at him, arid it hits
him, though it were but a bit of a stick, as big as your finger,
he takes it for an affront, and sets all other business aside to
pursue his revenge, for he will have satisfaction in point of
honour: and this is his first quality. The next is, that if he
be once affronted, he will never leave you, night or day, till
he has his revenge, but follow, at a good round rate, tilt he
overtakes you.
My man Friday had delivered our guide, and when we
came up to him, he was helping him of)- from his horse. for
the man was boil) hurt and frighted, aud indeed the last more
than the first: when, on a sudden, we spied the bear come out
of the wood, and a vast monstrous one it was, the biggest by
But Friday put us out of doubt quickly; for seeing the bear
ding fast to the bough, and that he would not be persuaded to
come any farther, "Well, well,' said Friday,' you no come
farther, me go, me go; you no come to me, me come to you.'
And upon this, he goes out to the smallest end of the bough,
where it should bend with his weight, and gently lets himself
down by it sliding down the bough, till he came near enough
to jump down on his feet, and away he ran to his gun, takes it
up and stands still.
' Well,' said I to him,' Friday what will you do now? Why
don't you shoot him'' ' No shoot,' says Friday, ' no yet, me
shoot now, me no kill: me stay, give you one more laugh.'
And mdeed so he did, as you will see presently; for when the
bear saw his enemy gone, he comes back from the bough
where he stood; but did it mighty leisurely, looking behind
him every step, and coming backward till he got into the bo-
dy of the tree. Then with the same hinderend foremost, he
ijanie down the tree, grasping it with his claws, apd moving
one foot at a time, very leisurely: at this juncture, and just
before he could set his hind feet upon the ground, Friday
Mepped close to him, clapped the muzzle of his piece into his
car, and shot him dead as a stone.
Then the rogue turned about, to see if we did not laugh;
and when he saw we were pleased by our looks, he falls a
laughing himself very loud. ' So we kill bear in my country'
says Friday 'So you kill thecal' said 1: 'why you have no
guns' ' No,'says he;'no gun; but shoot great, much, long
arrow.'
This was, indeed, a good diversion to us; but we were still
m a wild place, and our guide very much hurt, and what to do
we hardly knew; the howling of wolves ran much- in my head;
and mdeed, except the noise I once heard on the shore of
Africa, of which I have said something already, 1 never heard
any thing that tilled me with so much horror.
Thestf things, and the approach of night, called us off,
or else, as Friday would have hail us, we should certainly
have taken the skin of this monstrous creature off, which
was worth saving; but we had three leagues to go, and our
guide hastened us; so we left him, and went forward on our
journey.
1 he ground was still covered with snow, though not so
deep and dangerous as on the mountains; and the ravenous
Frjjiay shootevg theBear
creatures, as we heard afterwards, were come down into the
forest and plam country, pressed by hunger, to seek for food;
end had done a great deal of mischief in the villages, where
they surprised the country people, killed a great many of
their sheep and horses, and some people too.
We had one dangerous place to pass, of which our guide
told us, if there were any more wolves in thi country, we
should find them there; and this was a small plain, surround-
ed with woods on every side, and a long, narrow defile or lane*
which we were to pass, to get through the wood, and then we
should come to the village where we were to lodge
It was within half an hour of sun-set, when we entered the
first wood; and a little after sun-set, when we came into the
plain. We met with nothing1 in the first wood, except that,
in a little plain, within the wood, which was not above two
furlongs over,' we saw five great wolves cross the road, full
speed, one after another, as if they had been in chase of some
prey, and had it in view. They took no notice of us, and
were gone, and out of our sight in a few moments.
Upon this, our guide, who, by the way, was a wretched.
faint hearted fellow, bade us keep in a ready posture; for he
believed there were more wolves a coming.
We kept our arms ready, and our eyes about us; but we
saw no more wolves till we came through that wood, which
was near half a league, and entered the plain. As soon as we
came into the plain, we had occasion enough to look about us.
. The first object we met with, was a dead horse; that is to say,
a poor horse, which the wolves had killed, and at least a
dozen of them at work; we could not say eating of him, but
picking of his bones rather; for they had eaten up all the flesh
before.
We did not think fit to disturb them at their feast, neither
did they take much notice of us. Friday would have let fly
at them, but I would not suffer him by any means; for I found
we were like to have more business upon our hands than we
were awaie of. We were not gone half over the plain, but
we began to hear the wolves howl, in the wood on our left,
in a frightful manner; and, presently after, we saw about a
hundred coming on directly towards us, all in a body,-and
most of them in u line, as regularly as an army drawn up by
experienced officers. I scarce knew in what manner to re*
eeive them: but found to draw ourselves in a close line, was
the only way. So we formed in a moment. But that we
might not have too much mterval, I ordered that only every
other man should fire, and that the others, who had not fired,
should stand ready to give them a second volley immediately,
if they continued to advance upon us; and that then those
who had fired at first should not pretend to load their fusils
again, but stand ready with every one a pistol; for we were
all armed with a fusil, and a pair of pistols, each man: so we
were, by this method, able to fire six volleys, half of us at a
time. However, at present, we had no necessity; for, upon
firing the first volley, the enemy made a full stop, being ter-
rified as well with the noise as with the fire: four of them
bemg shot into the head, dropped; several others were wound-
ed, and went bleeding off, as we could see by the snow. I.
found they stopped, but did not immediately retreat; where-
upon remembering that I had been told, that the fiercest
creatures were terrified at the voice of man, I caused all our
company to halloo as loud as we could: and I found the no-
tion not altogether mistaken; for, upon our shout, they hegan
to retire, and turn about: then I ordered a second volley to be
fired in their rear, which put them to the gallop, and away
they went to the woods.
This gave us leisure to charge our pieces again, and that
we might lose no time, we kept doing. but we had but little
more than loaded our fusils, and put ourselves into a readiness,
when we heard a terrible noise in the same wood on our left;
only that it was farther onward, the same way that we were
to go.
The night was coming on, and the light began to be dusky,
which made it the worse on our side; but the noise increasing,
we could easily perceive that it was the howling and yelling
of those hellish creatures; anil, on a sudden, we perceived two
or three troops of wolves, one on our left, one behind us, and
one in our front: so that we seemed to be surrounded with
them. However, as they did not fall upon us, we kept our
way forward, as fast as we could make our horses go, which, the
way being very rough,~was only a good, large trot; and in this
manner we only came in view of the entrance of the wood,
through which we were to pass, at the farther side of the
plain; but we were greatly surprised, when, coming near the
lane, or p»ss, we saw a confused number of wolves standing
just at the entrance.
Crusoe
On a sudden, at another opening of the wood, we heard
the noise of a gun; and, lookmg that way, out rushed a
horse with a saddle and a bridle on him, flying like the
wind, and sixteen or seventeen wolves after him, full speed.
Indeed, the horse had the heels of them; hut, as we sup-
posed that he could not hold it at that rate, we doubted not
but they would get up with him at last; and no question bat
they did.
Here we had a most horrible sight; for, riding up to the
entrance where the horse came out, we found the carcass of
another horse, and of two men devoured by the ravenous
creatures, and one of the men was no doubt the same whom
we heard fire the gun; for there lay a gun just by him fired
off; but, as to the man, his head, aud the upper part of his
body, were eaten up
This filled us with horror, and we knew not what course to
take. but the. creatures resolved us soon, for they gathered
about us presently, in hopes of prey: and I verily believe
there were three hundred of them. It happened very much
to our advantage, that at the entrauce into the wood, but a
little way from it, there lay some large timber trees, which
had been cut down the summer before, and I suppose lay
therefor carriage. I drew my little troop in among these
trees, and placing ourselves in a line, behind one long tree, I
advised them all to alight, and, keeping that tree before us,
for a breastwork, to stand in a triangle or three fronts; en-
closing our horses in the centre.
We did so. and it was well we did, for never was a more
furious charge than the creatures made upon us in this place:
they came on us with a growling kind of noise, and mounted
the piece of timber (which, as I said, was our breastwork), as
if they were only rushing upon their prey; and this fury of
theirs, it seems, was principally occasioned by their seeing
our horses behind us; which was the prey they aimed at- I
ordered our men to fire as before, every other man. and they
took their aim so sure, that indeed they killed several of the
wolves at the first volley: but there was a necessity to keep a
continual firing, for they came on like devils, those behind
pushing on those before
When we had fired our second volley of our fusils, we
thought they stopped a little, and I hoped they would have
gone off, but it was but a moment, for others came forward
258 ROBINSON CRUSOE.
these four firings, we killed seventeen or eighteen of them,
and lamed twice as many: yet they came on again.
I was Loath to spend our last shot too hastily; so I called
my servant, not my man Friday, for he was better employed;
for, with the greatest dexterity imaginable, he charged my
fusil, and his own, while we were engaged, but, as I said, I
called my other man; and giving him a horn of powder, I
bade him lay a train, all along the piece of timber, and let it
be a large train. He did so, and had but just time to get
away, when the wolves came up to it, and some were got up
upon il, when I, snapping an uncharged pistol, close to
the powder, set it on fire Those that were upon the
timber were scorched with it, and six or seven of them fell,
or rather jumped in among us, with the force and fright of
the fire. We dispatched these m an instant, and the
rest were so frighted with the light, which the night, for now
it was very near dark, made more terrible, that they drew
back a little.
Upon which, I ordered our last pistols to be fired off in
one volley, and after that we gave a shout: upon this, the
wolves turned tail, and we sallied immediately upon near
twenty lame ones, which we found struggling on the ground,
and fell a cutting them with our swords; which answered ouc
expectation; for the crying and howling they made were
better understood by their fellows, so that they all fled, and
left us.
We had, first and last, killed about threescore of them;
and had it been daylight, we had killed many more. The
field of battle being thus cleared, we made forward again; for
we had still near a league to go. We heard the ravenous
creatures howl and yell in the woods as we went, several
times. and sometimes we fancied we saw some of them, but
the snow dazzling our eyes, we were not certain: so in about
an hour more, we came to the town,»where we were to
lodge, which we found in a terrible fright, and all in arms;
for it seems, that, the night before, the wolves and some
bears had broken into the village, and put them in a terrible
fright; and they were obliged to keep guard, night and day,
but especially in the night; to preserve their cattle, and iu.
deed their poeple.
The next morning our guide was so ill, and his limbs so
'swelled with the rankling of his two wounds, that he could
go no farther; so we were obliged to take a new guide there,
and go to Tholouse, where we found a warm climate, a fruit-
ful pleasant country, and no snow, no wolves, or any thing
like them But when we told our story at Tholouse, they
told us it was nothing but what was ordinary in the great
forest, at the foot of the mountains, especially when the
snow lay on the ground But they mquired much what kind
of a guide we had gotten, that would venture to bring us that
way in such a severe season; and told us, it was very much we
were not all devoured. When we told them how we placed our-
selves, and the horses in the middle, they blamed us exceed-
ingly, and told us, it was fifty to one, but we had been all de-
stroyed; for it was the sight of the horses that made the
wolves so furious, seeing their prey, and that at other times
they are really afraid 6i a gun; but they being excessive
hungry, and raging on that account, the eagerness to come
at the horses had made them senseless of danger; and
that if we had not by the continued fire, and at last by the
stratagem of the train of powder, mastered them, it had
been great odds but that we had been torn to pieces; where-
as had we been content to have sat still on horseback, and
fired as horsemen, they would not have taken the horses
so much for their own, when men were on their backs,
as otherwise; and, withal, they told us, that, at last, if we
had stood all together, and left our horses, they would
have been so eager to have devoured them, that wt might
have come off safe, especially having our fire-arms in our
hands, and being so many in number.
For my part I was never so sensible of danger in my life;
for seeing above three hundred devils come roaring and opeu-
mouthed to devour us, and having nothing to shelter us, or
retreat to, I gave myself over for lost; and, as it was, I believe,
I shall never care to cross those mountains again; I think I
would much rather go a thousand leagues by sea, though I
were sure to meet with a storm once a week.
I nave nothing uncommon to take notice of in my passage
through France; nothing but what other travellers have given
an account of, with much more advantage than 1 can I
travelled from I holouse to Paris, and, without any consider-
able stay, came to Calais, ant1. landed safe at Dover, the four-
teeoth of January, after having had a severe cold season to
travel in.
I was now come to the centre of my travels, and had, in
a little time, all my new-discovered estate safe about me; the
bills of exchange which I brought with me having been very
currently paid.
My principal guide, and privy-counsellor, was my good,
ancient widow, who, who in gratitude for the money I bad
sent her, thought no pains too much, er care too great, to"
employ for me; and I trusted her so entirely with every
thing, that I was perfectly easy as to the security of my
effects: and indeed I was very happy from my beginning, and
now to the end, in the unspotted integrity of this good gentle-
woman.
And now I began to think of leaving my effects with this
woman, and setting out for Lisbon, and so to the Brasils.
But now another scruple came in my way, and that was re-
ligion; for as I had entertained some doubts about the Roman
religion, even while I was abroad, especially in my state of
solitude: so I knew there was no going to the Brasils for me,
much less going to settle there, unless I resolved to embrace
the Roman catholic religion, without any reserve; except. on
the other hand, I resolved to be a sacrifice to my prmciples,
be a martyr for religion, and die in the inquisition: so 1 re-
solved to stay at home, and, if I could find means for it, to
dispose of my plantation.
To tltts purpose I wrote to my old friend at Lisbon, who,
in return, gave me notice, that he could easily dispose of it
there; but that, if I thought fit to give him leave to offer it
in my name to the two merchants, the survivors of my trus-
tees, who lived in the Brasds, who must fully understand the
value of it, who lived just upon the spot, and whom t knew
to be very rich; so that he believed they would be fond of
buying it; he did not doubt, but I should make four or five
thousand pieces of eight the more of it.
Accordingly 1 agreed, gave him order to offer it to them,
and he did so; and in about eight months more, the ship
being then returned, he sent me an account, that they had
accepted the offer, and had remitted thirty-three thousand
pieces of eight to a correspondent of theirs at Lisbon, to pay
foe it.
In return, I signed the instrument of sale in the form
which they sent from Lisbon, and sent it to my old man,
-who sent me bills of exchange for thirty-two thousand eight
hundred pieces of eight, for the estate, reserving the payment
of one hundred moidores a year to him, the old man, during
his life, and fifty moidores afterward to his son for his life,
which I had promised them; and which the plantation was to
make good as a rent-charge
And thus I have given the first part of a life of fortune ani
adventure, a life of Providence's checker-work, and of a va-
riety which the world will seldom be able to show the like of.
Beginning foolishly, but closing much more happily J.han any
part of it ever gave me leave so much as to hope..for.
Any one would think, that, in this state of complicated
good fortune, I was past runnmg any more hazards; a'.id so
indeed I had been, if other circumstances had concurred: but
I was inured to a wandering life, had no family, nor many
relations, nor, however rich, had I contracted much acquaint-
ance; and though I had sold my estate in the ISrasils, yet I
could not keep that country out of my head, and had a great
mind to be upon the wing again; especially I could not restst
the strong inclination I had to see my island, and to know if
the poor Spaniards were in being there, and how the rogues
I left there had used them.
My true friend, the -widow, earnestly dissuaded me from
it, and so far prevailed with me, that for almost seven years
she prevented my running abroad: during which time I took
my two nephews, the children of one of my brothers, into
my care. The eldest having something of his own, I bred up
as a gentleman, and gave him a settlement of some addition
to his estate after my disease; the other I put out to a cap-
tain of a ship: and after five years, finding him a sensible,
hold, enterprising young fellow, I put him into a good ship,
and sent him to sea. And this young fellow afterwards drew
jne in, as old as 1 was, to farther adventures myself
In the mean time, I in part settled myself here; for first of
all I married, and that not either to my disadvantage or dis-
satisfaction; and had three children, two sons and one daugh-
ter. But my wife dying, and my nephew coming home, with
good success, from a voyage to Spain, my mclination to go
abroad, and his importunity prevailed, and engaged me to go
Z
in his ship as a private trader to the East Indies. This was
in the year 1694.
In this voyage, I visited my new colony in the Island, saw
my successors, the Spaniards, had the whole story of their
lives, and of the villains I left there, how at first they insulted
the poor Spaniards, how they afterwards agreed, disagreed,
united, separated, and how at last the Spaniards were obliged
to use violence with them; how they were subjected to the
Spaniards; how honestly the Spaniards used them, a history,
if it were entered into, as full of variety and wonderful acci-
dents, as my own part: particularly also as to their battles
with the Caribbeans, who landed several times upon the
island, and as to the improvement they made upon the island
itself; and how five of them made an attempt upon the main
land, and brought away eleven men and five women prisoners,
by which, at my coming, I found about twenty young children
on the island.
Here I staid about twenty days, left them supplies of all
necessary things, and particularly of arms, powder, shot,
clothes, tools, and two workmen, which I brought from Eng-
land with me; viz. a carpenter and a smith-
Besides this, I shared the island into parts with them, re-
served to myself the property of the whole, but gave them
such parts respectively as they agreed on; and having settled
all things with them, and engaged them not to leave the
place, I left them there.
From thence I touched at the Brasils, from whence I sent
a bark, which I bought there, with more people, to the
island; and in it, besides other supplies, I sent seven women,
being such as I found proper for service, or for wives to such
us would take them. As to the Englishmen, I promised
them to send them some women from England, with a good
cargo of necessaries, if they would apply themselves to plant-
ing, which I afterwards could not perform. The fellows
proved very honest and diligent, after they were mastered;
and had their properties set apart for them. I sent them also
from the Brasils five cows, three of them being big with calf,
some sheep, and some hogs, which, when I came again, were
considerably increased.
But all these' things, with an account how three hundred
Canbbees came and invaded them, and ruined their planta-
tions, and how they fought with that whole number twice»
and were at first defeated, and one of them killed; but at last
a storm destroying their enemies canoes, they famished or
destroyed almost all the rest, and renewed and recovered the
possession of their plantation, and still lived upon the island:
All these things, with some very surprising incidents, in
some new adventures of my own, for ten years more, I may,
perhaps, give a farther account of hereafter.

LIFE OF THE AUTHOR. C^
a*.
ism de Foe was born in London about the year 16C3. i^
father was a butcher; and the family name was Foe, un- -^
ur author, for some unknown reason, changed it to De _
. He was probably intended for trade; but very soon af- _
he had received such education as a school at Newington- k
;n afforded, he became a political writer. He afterwards
aged in business as a hosier, and then as a pantile-maker; *
in both was unsuccessful. His head was frequently em-
yed on projects, and he even wrote an essay on that sub-
:; but he was always either unskilful, or unfortunate. It is,
fever, much to his credit that he continued satisfying the
nands of his creditors, as he was able, until they were paid
whole amount of their debts.
rhe first of his peiformances which excited much atten-
a was ' The True-Born Englishman,' published in 1701.
iis was a poetical satire, in defence of King William, who,
that time was blamed for employing foreigners as his friends
court. During the popularity of this piece, he wrote ano-
jr satire, called ' Reformation of Manners,' in which, among
ler topics, appeared one of the first censures on the slave-
ide.
As De Foe was a wit, he often employed an ironical way
writing, which the age was too dull to comprehend. In this
yle, he wrote a pamphlet, entitled ' The Shortest Way with
le Dissenters, or Pioposals for the Establishment of the
hurch.' It was, in fact, a defence of the dissenters, but so
I understood, that the House ofCommons pronounced it to
e a seditious libel; and De Foe suffered fine, imprisonment,
nd the pillory; the latter of which punishments he bore with
reat fortitude, and amused himself by writing ' A Hymn to
le Pillory,' during his confinement. In February, 1703 4,
while in Newgate, he commenced a periodical publication,
called the " Review," which has been supposed, and not with-
out some reason, to have given rise to the Tatler and Spec-
tator. A. t length he was liberated, by the interposition of Mr.
Harley, afterwards Lord Oxford, and resumed his occupation
of political writing. Among his principal productions of this
kind, were ' Jure Divino,' a poetical satire, in twelve books,
against arbitrary government; and ' The History of the Union/
which has lately been reprinted; to promote this, he was sent
to Scotland, where he wrote a poem, in honour of the inhabit-
ants of that country, called 'Caledonia.' He wrote also, 'The
History of Addresses,' and some pamphlets in favour of the
house of Hanover, which, being written in an ironical style,
were unfortunately mistaken for defences of the Pretender,
and the author was again prosecuted and imprisoned. These
misfortunes induced him, about the year 1715, to relinquish
politics altogether, and employ his pen on subjects of morals
or manners.
His performances in this way were chiefly ' The Family
Instructor,' in dialogues, a work to which Richardson in his
novels owes great obligation. He wrote also in the same form
' Religious Courtship,' and the narratives of ' Robinson Cru-
soe,' ' The Life of Captain Singleton,' 'Colonel Jack,' 'Moll
Flanders,' * Duncan Campbell,' and ' The Fortunate Mis-
tress.' The morality of some of these has been justly ques-
tioned, but they have all the fascinations of simplicity of style
and probability of adventure, and all enjoyed a considerable
shave of popularity. In 1722, he wrote a ' Journal of the
Plague in 1665,' which, although a fiction, imposed on Dr.
Mead, who considered it as a book of authority. He publish-
ed also three volumes of ' Travels through England and Scot-
land,' which have been the foundation of all the complete
tours and other publications of that kind since. In this
manner, for several years, he continued to publish treatises,
or pieces of fiction, many of which are no longer read; and
his poetry, it must be confessed, is only valuable as including
hints of the events and political characters of the times.
He died at his house at Islington, in 1751, leaving a daugh-
ter, who was married to Mr. H. Baker, the ingenious natu-
ralist.
Of all his writings, that which is now before the reader has
ever been the most popular. It was first published in 1719;
and perhaps few years have since passed without its being
reprinted in some convenient form. A story has long pre-
vailed that De Foe defrauded a Scotch seaman, of the name of
Selkirk, of his papers or journals, and made them the foun-
dation of this novel. That such a seaman existed, and was
shipwrecked, and afterwards wrote a journal, is probable
enough; but that he contributed more than the mere sugges-
tion of writing Robinson Crusoe, it is impossible to be-
lieve, nor have we any authenticated facts in favour of the
supposition. Robinson Crusoe, in all its essential points, is a
pure fiction, and displays a reach of invention which had never
before appeared in any English work of the kind; a fertility
of fancy and genins which De Foe could have borrowed from
no source but the inexhaustible fund of his own mind. In
adapting his style to the supposed situation and rank of Cru-
soe, he is eminently successful, simplicity and perspicuity be-
ing so uniformly preserved, that, perhaps, it is impossible to
name a work so fascinating to young and unenlightened minds,
or so happily adapted to their comprehension. It has, for
nearly a century, been one of the most popular books in our
language, and translation into most of the European languages
has rendered it the subject of admiration abroad. It has been
-well observed, that it breathes throughout a spirit of piety and
benevolence, and sets in a very striking light the importance
of the mechanic arts: it fixes in the mind a lively idea of the
horrors of solitude, and, consequently, of the sweets of social
life, and of the blessings we derive from conversation and mu-
tual aid.
I was born in the year 1632, in the city of York, of a good
family, though not of that country, my father being a foreigner
of Bremen, who settled first at Hull. He got a good estate
by merchandise, and leaving off his trade, lived afterwards at
York; from whence he married my mother, whose relations
were named Robinson, a very good family in that country,
and from whom 1 was called Robinson Kreutznaer; but, by
the usual corruption of words in England, we are now called,
nay, we call ourselves, and write our name, Crusoe; and so
my companions always called me.
I had two elder brothers; one of whom was lieutenant-
colonel to an English regiment of foot in Flanders, formerly
commanded my the famous colonel Lockhart, and was killed
at the battle near Dunkirk against the Spaniards. What be-
came of my second brother, I never knew, any more than my
father or mother did know what was become of me.
Being the third son of the family, and not bred to any
trade, my head began to be filled very early with rambling
thoughts. My father, who was very ancient, had given me a
competent share of learning, as far as house-education and a
country free-school generally goes, and designed me for the
law; but I would be satisfied with nothing but going to sea:
and my inclination to this led me so strongly against the will,
nay, the commands of my father, and against all the entrea-
ties and persuasions of my mother and other friends, that
there seemed to be something fatal in that propension of na-
ture, tending directly to the life of misery which was to be-
fall me.
My father, a wise and grave man, gave me serious and
excellent counsel against what he foresaw was my design. He
called me one morning into his chamber, where he was con-
fined by the gout, and expostulated very warmly with me up-
on this subject. He asked me what reasons, more than a mere
wandering inclination, I had for leaving my lather's house,
A 2
and my native country; where I might be well introduced,
and have a prospect of raising my fortune by application and
industry, with a life of ease and pleasure. He told me it was
men of desperate fortunes on one hand, or of aspiring superior
fortunes on the other, who went abroad upon adventures, to
rise by enterprise; and make themselves famous in underta.
kings of a nature out of the common road; that these things
were all either too far above me, or too far below me; that
mine was the middle state, or what might be called the upper
station of low life, which he had found, by long experience,
was the best stale in the world; the most suited to human hap-
piness, not exposed to the miseries and hardships, the labour
and sufferings, of the mechanic part of mankind: and not em-
barrassed with the pride, luxury, ambition and envy of the up-
per part of mankind. He told me I might judge of the hap-
piness of this state by this one thing; viz. that this was the state
of life which all other people envied; that kings have frequent-
ly lamented the miserable consequences of being born to great
things, and wished they had been placed in the middle of the
two extremes, between the mean and the great; that the wise
man gave his testimony to this, as the just standard of true
felicity, when he prayed to have neither poverty nor riches.
He bade me observe it, and I should always find, thai the
calamities of life were shared among the upper and lower part
of mankind; but that the middle station had the fewest disas-
ters, and was nol exposed to so many vicissitudes as the high-
er or lower part of mankind; nay, they were not subjected to
so many distempers and uneasinesses, either of body or mind,
as those were, who, by vicious living, luxury, and extravagan-
cies on one hand, or by hard labour, want of necessaries, and
mean or insufficient diet, on the other hand, bring distempers
upon themselves by the natural consequences of their way of
living; that the middle statiou of life was calculated for all kind
of virtues, and all kinds of enjoyments; that peace and plenty
were the handmaids of a middle fortune; that temperance,
moderation, quietness, health, society, all agreeable diver-
sions, and all desirable pleasures, were the blessings attend-
ing the middle station of life; that this way men went silently
Jmd smoothly through the world, and comfortably out of it;
not embarrassed with the labours of the hands, or of the head;
not sold to a life of slavery for daily bread, or harassed with
perplexed circumstances, which rob the soul of peace, and
the body of rest; nor enraged with the passion of envy, or the
secret burning lust of ambition for great things; but, in easy
circumstances, sliding gently through the world, and sensibly
tasting the sweets of living, without the bitter; feeling that
they are happy, and learning by every day's experience to
know it more sensibly.
After this, he pressed me earnestly, and in the most
affectionate manner, not to play the young man, nor to pre-
cipitate myself into miseries, which nature, and the station of
life I was born in, seemed to have provided against; that I
was under no necessity of seeking my bread; that he would
do well for me, and endeavour to enter me fairly into the
station of life which he had. been just recommending to mc;
and that if 1 was not very easy and happy in the world, it
must be my mere fate, or fault, that must hmder it: and that
he should have nothing to answer for, having thus discharged
his duty in warning me against measures which he knew
would be to my hurt. In a word, that as he would do very
kind things for me if I would stay and settle at home as he
directed; so he would not have so much hand in my misfor-
tunes, as to give me any encouragement to go away: and to
close all, he told me, I had my elder brother for an exam-
ple, to whom he had used the same earnest persuasions to
keep him from going into the Low Country wars; but could
not prevail, his young desires prompting him to run into the
army, where he was killed; and though he said he would not
cease to pray for me, yet he would venture to say to me, that
if I did take this foolish step, God would not bless me, and I
would have leisure hereafter to reflect upon having neglect-
ed his counsel, when there might be none to assist in my re-
covery.
I observed in this last part of his discourse, which was
truly prophetie, though I suppose my father did not know it
to be so himself; I say, I observed the tears run down his
face very plentifully, especially when he spoke of my hrother
who was killed: and that when he spoke of my having lei-
sure to repent, and none to assist me, he was so moved, that
he broke off the discourse, and told me, his heart was so full,
he could say no more to me.
1 was sincerely affected with this discourse, as indeed who
could be otherwise' And I resolved not to think of going
abroad any more, but to settle at home according to my fa-
ther's desire. But alas! a few days wore it all off; anil,
in short, to prevent any of my father's farther importunities,
in a few weeks after I resolved to run quite away from him.
However, I did not act so hastily neither, as the first heat of
my resolution prompted; but I took my mother at a time
when I thought her a little pleasanter than ordinary, and told
her, that my thoughts were so entirely bent upon seeing the
world, that I should never settle to any thing with resolution
enough to go through with it; and my father had better give
me his consent, than force me to go without it: that I was now
eighteen years old, which was too late to go apprentice to a
a trade, or clerk to an attorney: that I was sure, if I did, I
should never serve out my time, but I should certainly run
away from my master before my time was out, and go to
sea: and if she would speak to my father to let me go one
voyage abroad, if I came home again and did not like it, I
would go no more, and I would promise, by a double dili-
gence, to recover the time I had lost.
This put my mother into a great passion. She told me,
she knew it would be to no purpose to speak to my father
upon any such subject; that he knew too well what was my
interest, to give his consent to any thing so much for my
hurt; and that she wondered how I could think of any such
thing, after the discourse I had had with my father, and such
kind and tender expressions, as she knew my father had used
to me; and that, in short, if I would ruin myself, there was
no help for me; but I might depend I should never have
their consent to it: that for her part, she would not have so
much hand in my destruction; and I should never have it to
say, that my mother was willing, when my father was not-
Though my mother refused to move it to my father, yet I
heard afterwards that she reported all the discourse to him;
and that my father, after showing a great concern at it, said
to her, with a sigh, ' That the boy might be happy, if he
would stay at home; but if he goes abroad, he will be the
most miserable wretch that ever was born: I can give no con-
sent to it.'
It was not till almost a year after this that I broke loose,
though in the mean time L continued obstinately deaf to all
proposals of settling to business, and frequently expostulating
with my father and mother about their being so positively
determined against what they knew my inclinations prompt-
ed me to. But being one day at Hull, whither I went casu-
ally, and without any purpose of making an elopement that
time; but, 1 say, being there, and one of my companions be-
ing going by sea to London, in his father's ship, and prompt-
ing me to go with them, with the common allurement of a
seafaring man, that it should cost me nothing for my passage,
1 consulted neither father nor mother any more, nor so much
as sent them word of it: but leaving them to hear of it, as
they might, without asking God's blessing, or my father's,
without any consideration of circumstances or consequences,
and in an ill hour, God knows, on the first of September, 1651,
I went on board a ship bound for London. Never any young
adventurer's misfortunes, I believe began sooner or continued
longer, than mine. The ship was no sooner got out of the
Humber, but the wind began to blow, and the sea to rise in a
most frightful manner; and, as I had never been at sea be-
fore, I was most inexpressibly sick in body, and terrified in
mind. I began now seriously to reflect upon what I had done,
and how justly I was overtaken by the judgment of heaven,
for my wicked leaving my father's house, and abandoning my
duty. All the good council of my parents, my father's tears,
and my mother's entreaties, came now fresh into my mind;
and my conscience, which was not yet come to the pitch of
hardness to which it has been since, reproached me with the
•ontempt of advice, and the breach of my duty to God and my
father.
All this while the storm increased, and the sea went very
high, though nothing like what I have seen many times
since; no, nor what I saw a few days after But it was
enough to affect me then, who was but a young sailor, and
had never known any thing of the matter. 1 expected every
wave would have swallowed us up, and that every time the
ship fell down, as I thought it did, in the trough or hollow of
the sea, we should never rise more. In this agony of mind,
I made many vows and resolutions, that if it would please
God to spare my life in this one voyage, if ever I got once
my foot upon dry land again, I would go directly home to my
father, and never set it into a ship again while I lived: that
.I would take his advice, and never run myself into such. mi-
series as these any more. Now I saw plainly the goodness of
his observations about the middle station of life, how easy,
how comfortable, he had lived all his days, and never had
been exposed to tempests at sea, or troubles on shore: and,
in short, I resolved that I would, like a true repenting prodi-
gal, go home to my father.
These wise and sober thoughts continued all the while the
storm continued, and indeed some time after; but the next
day the wind was abated, and the sea calmer, and I began t«
be a little inured to it. However, I was very grave for all
that day, being also a little sea-sick still; but towards night
the weather cleared up, the wind was quite over, and a
charming fine evening followed; the sun went down perfectly
clear, and rose so the next morning; and having little or no
wind, and a smooth sea, the suu shining upon it, the sight
was, as I thought, the most delightful that ever I saw
I had slept well in the night, and was now no more sea-sick,
but very cheerful; looking with wonder upon the sea, that
was so rough and terrible the day before, and could be so
calm and so pleasant in so little a time after. And now, lest
my good resolutions should continue, my companion, who had
indeed, entieed me away, eomes to me, ' Well Bob,' says he,
clapping me upon the shoulder, "how do you do after it? I war-
rant you were frightened, w'an't you, lastnight, when it blew
but a capfull of wind?' ' A capfull d'youcallit?' said I, 'twasa
terrible storm,' ' A storm, you fool you!' replies he; 'do you
call that a storm? Why it was nothing at all; give us but a
good ship and sen-room, and we think nothing of such a squall
of wind as that: but, you're but a fresh-water sailor, Bob.
Come, let us make a bowl of punch, and we'll forget all that.
D'you see what charming weather 'tis now!' To make short
this sad part of my story, we went the way of all sailors; the
punch was made; and 1 was made half drunk with it, and in
that one night's wickedness I drowned all my repen-
tance, all my reflections upon my past conduct, .and all my
resolutions for the future In a word, as the sea was re-
turned to its smoothness of surface, and settled calmness, by
the abatement of that storm, so the hurry of my thoughts be-
ing over, my fears and apprehensions of being swallowed up
by sea being forgotten, and the current of my former desires
returned, I entirely forgot the vows and promises that I made
in my distress. I found indeed some intervals of reflection,
and the serious thoughts did, as it were, endeavour to return
again sometimes; but I shook them off, and roused myself
from them, as it were from a distemper! and applying my-
self to drinking and company, soon mastered the return of
those fits (for so I called them); and I had, in five or six
days, got as complete a victory over conscience, as any young
fellow that resolved not to be troubled with it could desire.
But I was to have another trial for it still; and Providence,
as in such cases generally it does, resolved to leave me en-
tirely without excuse: for, if I would not take this for a deli-
verance, the next was to be such a one, as the worst and
most hardened wretch among us would confess both the dan-
ger and the mercy. .
The sixth day of our being at sea, we came into Yarmouth
Roads: the wind having been contrary, and the weather calm,
we had made but little way since the storm. Here we were
obliged to come to an anchor; and here we lay, the wind con-
tinuing contrary, viz. at south-west for seven or eight days:
during which time a great many ships from New-castle came
into the same roads, as the common harbour where the ships
might wait for a wind for the river.
We had not, however, rid here so long, but we should
have tided it up the river, but that the wind blew too fresh;
and, after we had lain four or five days, blew very hard.
However, the roads being reckoned as good as a harbour, the
anchorage good, and our ground tackle very strong, our men
were unconcerned, and not in the least apprehensive of dan-
ger, but spent the time in rest and mirth, after the manner
of the sea: but the eighth day in the morning, the wind in-
creased, and we had all hands at work to strike our top-
masts, and make every thing snug and close, that the ship
might ride as easy as possible. By noon the sea went very
high indeed, and our ship rid fore-castle in, shipped several
seas, and we thought once or twice our anchor had come
home; upon which our master ordered out the sheet anchor,
so that we rode with two anchors ahead, and the cables veered
out to the better end.
By this time it blew a terrible storm indeed, and now I
began to see terror and amazement in the faces even of the
seamen themselves. The master, though vigilant in the bu-
siness of preserving the ship, yet as he went in and out of his
cabin by me, I could hear him, softly to himself, say several
times; ' Lord be merciful to us! We shall be all lost; we shall
be all undone!' and the like. During these first hurries I was
stupid, lying still in my cabin, which was in the steerage,
and cannot describe my temper. I could ill resume the first
penitence, which I had so apparently trampled upon, and
hardened myself against. I thought the bitterness of death
had been past; and that this would be nothing too, like the
first. But when the master himself came by me, as I said
just now, and said we should be all lost, I was dreadfully
frighted. I got up out of my cabin, and looked out; but such
a dismal sight I never saw; the sea went mountains high, and
broke upon us every three or four minutes. When I could
look about, I could see nothing but distress round us Two
ships that rid near us, we found had cut their masts by the
board, being deep loaden; and our men cried out, that a ship,
which rid about a mile ahead of us, was foundered. Two more
ships, beingdhven from their anchors, were run out of the roads
to sea, at all adventures, and that not with a mast standing.
The light ships fared the best, as not so much labouring in
the sea; but two or three of them drove, and came close by
us, running away, with only their sprit-sail out, before the wind.
Towards the evening the mate and boatswain begged the
master of our ship to let them cut away the fore-mast, which
he was very unwilling to do; but the boatswain protesting to
him that if he did not, the ship would founder, he consented:
and when they had cut away the fore-maM, the main mast
stood so loose, and shook the ship so much, they were obliged
to cut her away also, and make a clear deck.
\ny one may judge what a condition I must be in at all
this, who was but a young sailor, and who had been in such a
fright before at but a little. But, if I can express at this dis-
tance the thoughts! had about me at that time, I was in ten-
fold mbre horror of mind upon account of my former convic-
tions, and the having returned from them to the resolutions I
had wickedly taken at first, than I was at death itself; and
these, added to the terror of the storm, put me into such ft
condition, that I can by no words describe it. But the worst
was not come yet: the storm continued with such fury, that
the seamen themselves acknowledged they had never seen a
worse. We had a good ship, but she was deep loaden, and
wallowed in the sea, that the seamen every row and then
cried out, she would founder. It was my advantage in one
respect, that I did not know what they meant by founder,
till I inquired. However, the storm was so violent, that I
saw what is not often seen, the master, the boatswain, and
some others more sensible than the rest, at their prayers,
and expecting every moment when the ship would go to the
bottom. In the middle of the night, and under all the rest
of our distresses, one of the men that had been down on pur-
pose to see, cried out we had sprung a leak; another said,
there was four feet water in the hold. .Then all hands were
called to the pump. At that very word my heart as I thought,
died within me; and I fell backwards upon the side of the
b-ed where I sat into the cabin. However, the men roused
me, and told me, that I that was able to do nothing before,
was as well able to pump as another: at which I stirred up,
and went to the pump, and worked very heartily. While
this was doing, the master seeing some light colliers, who,
not able to ride out the storm, were obliged to slip and run
away to sea, and would come near us, ordered to fire a gun
as a signal of distress. I who knew nothing what that meant,
was so surprised, that I thought the ship had broke, or some
dreadful thing happened. In a word, I was so surprised, that
I fell down in a swoon. As this was a time when every body
had his own life to think of, nobody minded me, or what was
become of me: but another man stepped up to the pump,
and, thrusting me aside with his foot, let me lie, thinking
I had been dead; and it was a great while before I came to
myself.
We worked on, but the water increasing in the hold, it
was apparent that the ship would founder; and though the
storm began to abate a little, yet as it was not possible she
could swim till we might run into any port, so the master
continued firing guns for help; and a light ship, who had rid it
out just sihead of us, ventured a boat out to help us. It was
with the utmost hazard the boat came near us; but it was im-
possible for us to get on board, or for the boat to lie near the
ship-side, till at last the men rowing very heartily, and ven-
turing tlieir lives to save ours, our men cast them a rope over
the stern with a buoy to it, and then veered it out a great
length, which they, after much labour and hazard, took hold
of; and we hauled them close under our stern, and got all into
their boat. It was to no purpose for them or us. after we
were in the boat, to think of reaching to their own ship; so
all agreed to let her drive, and only to pull her in towards
shore as much as we could; and our master promised them,
B
that if the boat was staved upon shove, he would make it good
to their master. So partly rowing; and partly driving, our
boat went away to the northward, sloping towards the shore,
almost as far as VVintertonness.
We were not much more than a quarter of an hour out of
our ship, but we saw her sink; and then I understood, for the
first time, what was meant by a ship foundering in the sea. I
must acknowledge I had hardly eyes to look up, when the
seamen told me she was sinking; for, from that moment, they
rather put me into the boat, than that I might he said to go
in; my heart was, as it were, dead within me, partly with
fright, partly with horror of mind, and the thoughts of what
was yet before me.
While we were in this condition, the men yet labouring at
the oar to bring the boat near the shore, we could see (when
our boat mounting the waves, we were able to see the shore)
a great many people running along the strand to assist us
when we should come near. But we made but slow way to-
wards the shore; nor were we able to reach the shore, till
being past the light-house at Winterton, the shore falls off to
the westward towards Cromer; and so the land broke off a
little the violence of the wind. Here we got in; and, though
not without much difficulty, got all safe on shore; and walked
afterwards on foot to Yarmouth, where, as unfortunate men,
we were used with great humanity, as -well by the ma-
gistrates of the town, who assigned us good quarters, as by
particular merchants and owners of ships; and had money
given us sufficient to carry us either to London or back to
Hull, as we thought fit.
Had I now had the sense to have gone back to Hull, and
have gone home, I had been happy, and my father, an em-
blem of our blessed Saviour's parable, had even killed the
fatted calf for me; for, hearing the ship I went away in was
cast away in Yarmouth roads, it was a great while before he
had any assurances that I was not drowned
But my ill fate pushed me on now with an obstinacy that
nothing could resist; and though I had several times loud
calls from my reason, and my more composed judgment, to
go home, yet I had no power to do it. I know not what to
call this; nor will I urge, that it is a secret over-ruling decree,
that hurries us on to be the instruments of our own destruc-
tion, even thongh it be before us, and that we push upon it
with our eyes open. Certainly, nothing but some such de-
creed unavoidable misery attending, and which it was impos-
sible tor me to escape, could have pushed me forward against
the calm reasonings and persuasions of my most retired
thoughts, and against two such visible instructions as I had
met with in my first attempt.
My comrade, who had helped to harden me before, and
who was the master's son, was now less forward than I. The
first time he spoke to me after we were at Yarmouth, which
was not till two or three days, for we were separated in the
town to several quarters; 1 say, the first time he saw me, it
appeared his tone was altered; and looking very melancholy,
and shaking his head, asked me how I did; and telling his
father who I was, and how I had come this voyage only for a
trial, in order to go farther abroad; his father turning to me
with a very grave and concerned tone, ' Young man,' says he,
* you ought never to go to sea any more; you ought to take
this for a plain and visible token, that you are not to be a sea-
faring man.' ' Why, sir,' said I,' will you go to sea no more?'
* That is another case,' said he; ' it is my calling, and there-
fore my duty; but, as you made this voyage for a trial, you
see what a taste Heaven has given you of what you are to ex-
pect, if you persist; perhaps all this has befallen us on your
account, like Jonah in the ship of Tarshish. Pray,' continues
he, ' what are you? and on what account did you go to sea?'
Upon that I told him some of my story; at the end of
-which he burst out with a strange kind of passion. ..£ What
had 1 done,' says he, ' that such an unhappy wretch should
come into my ship? 1 would not set my foot in the same ship
with thee again for a thousand pounds!' This mdeed was, as
I said, an excursion of his spirits; which were yet agitated by
the sense of his loss, and Vas further than he could have au-
thorily to go. However, lie afterwards talked very gravely
to me, exhorting me to go back to my father, and not tempt
Providence to my ruin; told me 1 might see a visible hand of
Heaven against me: ' And young man,' said he, ' depend
npon it, if you do not go back, wherever you go, you will meet
with nothing but disasters and disappointments, till your fa-
ther's words are fulfilled upon you.'
We parted soon after; for I made him little answer, and I
saw him no more: which way he went I know not. As for
me, having some money in my pocket, I travelled to London
by land; and there, as well as on the mad, had many struggles
with myself, what course of life I should take, am) whether I
should go home, or go to sea.
As to going home, shame opposed the best motions that of-
fered to my thoughts; and it immediately occurred to me
how I should he laughed at among the neighbours, and should
be ashamed to see, not my father and mother only, but even
every body else. From whence I have since often observed
how incongruous and irrational the common temper of man-
kind is, especially of youth, to that reason that ought to guide
them in such cases, viz. that they are not ashamed to sin, and
yet are ashamed to repent; and not ashamed of the acl ion,
for which they ought justly to be esteemed fools; but are
ashamed of the returning, which only can make them esteem-
ed wise men.
In this state of life, however, I remained some time, un-
certain what measures to take, and what course of lift; to
lead An irresistible reluctance continued to going home;
and, as I stayed awhile, the remembrance of the distress I
hud been in wore of; and as that abated, the little motion I
had in my desires to return, wore off with it, till at last I quite
laid aside the thoughts of it and looked out for a voyage.
That evil influence which carried me first away from
my father's house, which hurried me into the wild and indi-
gested notion of raising mj fortune, and that impressed those
conceits so forcibly upon me, as to make me deaf to all good
advice, and to the entreaties, and even the commands of nay
father; I say, the same influence, whatever it was, presented
the most unfortunate of all enterprises to my view; and I
went on board a vessel bound to the coast of Africa, or, as
our sailors vulgarly call it, u voyage to Guinea.
It was my great misfortnne, that, in all these adventures,
I did not ship myself as a sailor; whereby, though I might
indeed have worked a little harder than ordinary, vet at the
same time I had learned the duty and office of a fore-mast-
man; and in time might have qualified myself tor a mate or
lientenant, if not for a master But as it was always my fate
to choose for the worse, so I did here ; for, having money in
my pocket, and good clothes on my back, I would always go
on board in the habit of a gentleman; and so I neither had
any business in the ship, nor learned to do any.
It was my lot first of all to fall into pretty good company
in London, which does not always happen to such loose and
unguided young fellows as I then was; the devil, generally,
not omitting to lay some snare for them very early: but it
was not so with me. I first fell acquainted with the master
of a ship who had been on the eoast of Guinea, and who,
having had very good success there, was resolved to go again.
This captain taking a fancy to my conversation, which was
not disagreeable at that time, hearing me say I had a
mind to see the world, told me,!if I would go the voyage with
him, I should be at no expense; I should be his messmate,
and his companion; and if 1 could carry any thing with me, I
should have all the advantage of it that the trade would ad-
mit; and perhaps I might meet with some encouragement.
I embraced the offer, and, entering into a strict friendship
with this captain, who was an honest plain-dealing man, went
the voyage with him; and carried a small adventure with me,
which by the disinterested honesty of my friend the captain,
I increased very considerably; for I carried about 401. in such
toys and trifles as the captain directed me to buy. This 401.
1 had mustered together by the assistance of some of my re-
lations whom I corresponded with, and who, I believe got my
father, or at least my mother, to contribute so much as that
to my first adventure.
This was the only voyage which I may say was successful
in all my adventures, and which I owe to the integrity and
honesty of my friend the captain; under whom I also got a
competent knowledge of the mathematics, and the rules of
navigation ; learned how to keep an account of the ship's
course, take an observation, and, in short, to understand some
things that were needful to be understood by a sailor; for, as
he took delight to introduce me, I took delight to learn; and,
in a word, this voyage made me both a sailor and a merchant;
for I brought home five pounds nine ounces of gold-dust for
my adventure, which yielded me in London, at my return,
almost 3001.; and this filled me with those aspiring thoughts
which have since so completed my ruin.
Vet, even in this voyage, I had my misfortunes too; par-
ticularly that I was continually sick, being thrown into a vio-
lent calenture by the excessive heat of the climate, our prin-
cipal trading being upon the coast, from the latitude of 15 de-
grees N. even to the line itself.
n 2
I was now set up for a Guinea trader; and my friend to my
great misfortune, dying soon after his arrival, I resolved to go
the same voyage again; and I embarked in the same vessel
with one who was his mate in the former voyage, and had now
got the command of the ship- This was the unhappiest voy-
age that ever man made; for though I ilid not carry quite
1001 of my new-gained wealth, so that I had 2001. left, and
which I lodged with my friend's widow, who was very just to
me, yet I fell into terrible misfortunes in this voyage; and
the first was this, viz. our ship, making her course towards
the Canary islands, or rather between those islands and the
African shore, was surprised in the gray of the morning by a
Moorish rover of Sallee, who gave chase to us with all the sail
she could make. We crowded also as much canvass as our
yards would spread, or our masts carry, to have got clear; but,
finding the pirate gained upon us, and would certainly come up
with us in a few hours, we prepared to fight; our ship having
twelve guns, and the rogue eighteen. About three in the af-
ternoon he came up with us, and bringing to, by mistake, just
athwart our quarter, instead of athwart our stern, as he in-
tended, we brought eight of our guns to bear on that side, and
poured in a broadside upon him, which made him sheer off
again, after returning our fire, and pouring in also his small
shot from near two hundred men which he had on board.
However, we had not a man touched, all our men keeping
close. He prepared to attack us again, and we to defend
ourselves; but, laying us on board the next time upon our
other quarter, he entered ninety men upon our decks who
immediately fell to cutting and hacking the decks and rig-
ging. We plied them with small shot, half-pikes, puwder
i bests, and such like, and cleared our decks of them twice.
However, to cut short this melancholy part of our story, our
ship being disabled, and three of our men killed, and eight
wounded, we were obliged to yield; and were carried all pri-
soners into Sallee, a port belonged to the Moors.
The usage I had there was not so dreadful as at first t ap-
prehended; nor was I carried up the country, to trie empe-
ror's court, as the rest of our men were, but was loppt by the
captain of the rover as his proper prize, and made his slave,
being young and nimble, and fit for his business. Jit this sur-
prising change of my circumstances, from a merchant to a
miserable slave, I was perfectly overwhelmed; and now I
looked back upon my father's prophetic discourse to me, that
I should be miserable, and have norie.to relieve me, which I
thought was no .1 so effectually brought to pass, that I could
not be worse; that now the hand of Heaven had overtaken
me, and I was undone without redemption. But alas! this
was but a taste of the misery I was to go through, as will ap-
pear in the sequel of this story. '. '
As my new patron or master had taken me home to his
house, sol was in hopes that he would take me with him when
he went to sea again, believing that it would be some time or
other his fate to be taken by a Spanish or Portuguese man of
war; and that then I should be set at liberty. But this hope
of mine was soon taken away, for when he went to sea, he
left me on shore to look after his little garden, and do the
common drudgery of slaves about his house; and when he
came home again from his cruise, he ordered me to lie in the
cabin, to look after the ship.
Here I meditated nothing but my escape, and what me-
thod I might take to effect it; but found no way that bad the
least probability in it. Nothing presented to make the sup-
position of it rational, for I had nobody to communicate it to,
that would embark with me, .no fellow slave, no Englishman,
Irishman or Scotsman there, but myself; so that for two years,
though I often pleased myself with the imagination, yetl never
had the least encouraging prospect of putting it in practice.
After about two years, an odd circumstance presented it-
self, which put the old thought of making some attempt for
my liberty again in my head. My patroa lying at home lon-
ger than usual, without Suing out his ship, which as I heard,
was for want of money, he used, constantly once or twice a
week, sometimes oftener, if the weather was fjir, to take the
ship's pinnace, and go out into the road a fishing; and as he
always took me and a young Maresco with him to row the
boat, we made him very merry, and I proved verv dexterous
in catching fish; inasmuch that sometimes he would send me
with a Moor, one of his kinsmen, and the youth the Mores-
<o, as, they called him, to catch a dish of fish for him.
It happened onetime, that going a fishing with him in a
calm morning, a fog rose so thick, that though we were not
half a league from the shore, we lost sight of it; and, rowing
we knew not whither, or which way, we laboured all day, and
all the next night; and when the morning came, we found
we had pulled oft- to sea, instead of pulling in for the shore,
and that we were at least two leagues from the land. How-
ever, we got well in again, though with a great deal of labour,
and some danger; for the wind began to blow pretty fresh in
the morning: hut particularly we were all very hungry.
But our patron, warned by this disaster, resolved to take
more care of himself for the future; and having lying by him
the long boat of our English ship which he had taken, he re-
solved he would not go a fishing any more without a compass,
and some provision'- so he ordered the carpenter of his ship,
who was also an English slave, to build a little state-room or
cabin in the middle of the long-boat, like that of a barge, with
a place to stand behind it to steer, and haul home the main-
sheet; and room before for a hand or two to stand and work
the sails. She sailed with what we call a shoulder-of-mutton
sail; and the boom jibbed over the top of the cabin, which
lay very suug and low, and had in it room for him to lie, with
a slave or two, and a table to eat on, with some small lockers
to put in some bottles of such liquor as be thought fit to drink;
particularly his bread, rice, and coffee.
We were frequently out with this boat a fishing; and as I
was most dexterous to catch fish for him, he never went
without me. It happened one day, that he had appointed to
go out in this boat, either for pleasure or for fish, with two
or three Moors of some distinction, and for whom he had
provided extraordinarily, and had therefore sent onboard the
boat over night a larger store of provisions than usual; and
had ordered me to get ready three fusils with powder and
shot, which were on board his ship: for that they designed
some sport of fowling as well as fishing.
I got all things ready, as he had directed; and waited the
next morning with the boat washed clean, her ancient and pen-
dants out, and everything to accommodate his guests. when,
by and by, my patron came on board alone, and told me his
guests had put offgoing, upon some business that fell out, and
ordered me with the man and boy, as usual, to go out with
the boat, and catch them some fish, for that his friends were
to sup at his house. He commanded me too, that as soon as
I had got some fish, I should bring it home to his house.
All which I prepared to do.
This moment my former notions of deliverance darted into
my thoughts, for now I found I was like to have a little ship
at my command; and my master being gone, I prepared to
furnish! myself, not for fishing business, but for a voyage:
though I knew not, neither did I so much as consider, whi-
ther I would steer; for any where to get out of that place
was my way.
My first contrivance was to make a pretence to speak to
this Moor, to get something for our subsistence on board;
for I told him we must not presume to eat of our patron's
bread. He said, that was true; so he brought a large basket
of rusk or biscuit, of their kind, and three jars with fresh
water, into the boat. I knew where my patron's case of bot-
tles stood, which, it was evident by the make, were taken
outof some English prize, and I conveyed them into the boat,
while the Moor was on shore, as if they had been there be-
fore for oar master. I conveyed also a great lump of bees-
wax into the boat, which weighed about half a hundred
weight with a parcel of twine and thread, a hatchet, a saw,
and a hammer, all which were of great use to us afterwards:
especially the wax to make candles. Another trick I tried
upon him, which he innocently came into also. His name
was Ismael, whom they call Muley or Moley; so I called to
him, ' Moley,' said I, 'our patron's guns are all on board
the boat: can you not get a little powder and shot? It may be
we may kill some alcamies (a fowl like our curliens) for our-
selves; for I know he keeps the gunner's stores in the ship.'
'Yes,' says he, 'I'll bring some.' Accordingly he brought
a great leather pouch, which held about a pound aud a half
of powder, or rather more; and another with shot, that had
five or six pounds, with some bullets, and put all into the
boat. At the same time time I had found some powder of
my master's in the great cabin, with which I filled one of the
large bottles in the case, which was almost empty, pouring
what was in it into another: and thus furnished with every
thing needful, we sailed out of the port to fish. The castle,
which is at the entrance of the port, knew who we were, and
took no notice of us; and we were not above a mile out of
the port, before we hauled in our sail, and set us down to fish.
The wind blew from the N.N. E. which was contrary to my
desire; for had it blown southerly, I had been sure to have
made the coast of Spain, and at least reached to the bay of
Cadiz; but my resolutions were, blow which way it would, I
.would be gone from thai horrid place where I was, and leave
the rest to fate.
After we had fished some time, and catched nothing (for
-when 1 had fish on my hook, I would not pull them up, that he
might not see them,) 1 said to the Moor, ' This will not do:
our master will not be thus served. We must stand farther
off.' He, thinking no harm, agreed; and being in the head of
the boat, set the sails, and, as I had the helm, I run the boat
out near a league farther, and then brought her to, as if I
would fish; when, giving the boy the helm, I stepped for-
-ward to where the Moor was, and making as if I stooped for
something behind him, I took him by surprise with my arm
under his twist, and tossed him clear overboard into the sea.
He rose immediately, for he swam like a cork, and called to
me, begged to be taken in, told me he would go all over the
world with me He swam so strong after the boat, that he
would have reached me very quickly, there being but little'
wind; upon which I stepped into the cabin, and, fetching one
of the fowling pieces, I presented it at him, and told him I
had done him no hurt, and, if he would be quiet, I would do
him none: ' But,' said I, ' you swim well enough to reach the
shore, and the sea is calm, make the best of your way to
shore, and I will do you no harm: but, if you come near the
boat, I'll shoot you through the head, for 1 am resolved to
have my liberty.' So he turned himself about, and swam for
the shore, and I make no doubt but he reached it with ease,
for he was an excellent swimmer.
I could have been content to have taken this Moor with me,
and have drowned the boy, but there was no venturing to
trust him When he was gone, I turned to the boy, whom
they called Xury, and said to him, ' Xury, if you will be
faithful to me, I'll make you a great man; but if you will not
stroke your face to he true to me, that is, swear by Maho-
met, and his father's beard; I must throw you into the sea
too.' The boy smiled in my face, and spoke so innocently,
that I could not mistrust him; and swore to be faithful to
me, and go all over the world with nie.
While I was in view of the Moor that was swimming, I
stood out directly to sea with the boat, rather stretching to
windward, that they might think me gone towards the Straits
mouth (as indeed any one that had been in their wits must
have been supposed to do; for who would have supposed we
were sailed on to the southward, to the truly barbarian coasts,
.where whole nations of Negroes were sure to surround us,
with their canoes, and destroy us; where we could never
once go on shore, but we should be devoured by savage beasts,
or more merciless savages of human kind?
But, as soon as it grew dusk in the evening, I changed my
course, and steered directly south and by east, bending my
course a little towards the east, that I might keep in with the
shore; and, having a fair fresh gale of wind, and a smooth
quiet sea, I made such sail. that, I believe, by the next day
at three o'clock in the afternoon, when I first made the land,
1 could not be less than 150 miles south of Sallee, quite be-
yond the Emperor of Morocco's dominions, or indeed of any
other king thereabouts, for we saw no people.
Yet such was the fright I had taken at the Moors, and the
dreadful apprehensions I had of falling into their hands, that
I would not stop, or go on shore, or come to an anchor, the
wind continuing fair, till I had sailed in that manner five
days; and then the wind shifting to the southward, I con-
cluded, also that if any of our vessels were in chase of me,
they also would now give over; so 1 ventured to make to
the coast, and came to an anchor in the mouth of a little ri-
ver, I knejW not what or where, neither what latitude, what
eountry, what nation, or what river. I neither saw nor desired
to see any people: the principal thing I wanted was fresh
water. We came into this creek in the evening, resolving to
swim on shore as soon as it was dark, and discover the coun-
try; but as soon as it was quite dark, we heard such dreadful
noises of the barking, roaring, and howling of wild creatures,
of we knew not what kinds, that the poor boy was ready to
die with fear, and begged of me not to go on shore till day.
* Well, Xury', said I, ' then I won't; but it may be we may
see men by day, who will be as bad to us as those lions.'
• Then we may give them the shoot gun,' says Xury, laugh-
ing, ' make them run wey.' Such English Xury spoke by
conversing among the slaves. However, I was glad to see the
boy so cheerful, and I gave him a dram (out of our patron's
case of bottles) to cheer him up. After all, Xury's advice was
good, and I took it: we dropped our little anchor, and lay
still all night; I say stdl, for we slept none; for in two or three
hours we saw vast great creatures, we knew not what to call
them, of many sorts, come down to the sea-shore, and run
into the water, wallowing anil washing themselves for the
pleasure of cooling themselves: and they made such hideous
howlings and veilings, that I never indeed heard the like.
Xury was dreadfully frighted, and indeed so was I too; but
we were both worse frighted when we heard one of the migh-
ty creatures come swimming towards our boat: we could net see
him, but we might hear him by his blowing to be a monstrous
huge and furious beast. Xury said it was a lion, and (hat it
might be for aught I know. Poor Xury cried out to me to
weigh the anchor, and row away. ' No,' says I, Xury, ' we
can slip our cable with a buoy to it, and go to sea; they can-
not follow us far.' I had uo sooner said so, but I perceived
the creature (whatever it was) within two oars length, which
something surprised me; however, I immediately stepped to
the cabin door, and taking up my gun, fired at him, upon
which he immediately turned about, and swam towards
the shore again.
But it was not possible to describe the horrible noises, and
hideous cries and howlings that were raised, as well upon the
edge of the shore as higher within the country, upon the
noise or report of a gun, a thing, I have some reason to be-
lieve those creatures had never heard before. This convin-
ced me that there was no going on shore for us in the night
upon that coast, and how to venture on shore in the day,
was another question too; for, to have fallen into the hands
of any of the savages, had been as bad as to have fallen into
the paws of lions and tigers; at least we were equally appre-
hensive of the danger of it.
Be that as it would, we were obliged to go on shore some-
where or other for water, for we had not a pint left in the
boat: when or where to get to it, was the point. Xury said if I
would let him go on shore with one of the jars, he would
find if there was any water, and bring some to me. I asked
him why he would go, why I should not go, and he stay in
the boat. The boy answered wilh so much affection that
made me love him ever after. Says he, ' If wild mans come,
they eat me; you go wey.' ' Well, Xury,' said I, ' we will
both go, and if the wild mans come, we will kill them: they
shall eat neither of us.' So 1 gave Xury a piece of rusk bread
to eat, and a dram out of our patron's case of bottles, which
I mentioned before, and we hauled the boat in as near the shore
as we thought was proper, and waded on shore, carrying
nothing but our arms, and two jars for water.
I did not care to go out of sight of the boat, fearing the
coming of canoes with savages down the river: but the boy
seeing a low place, about a mile up the country, rambled to
it, and by and by I saw him come running towards me. I
thought he was pursued by some savages, or frightened by
some wild beast, and I ran forward towards him to help him;
but when I came nearer to him, I saw something hanging over
his shoulders, which was a creature that he had shot, like a
hare, butdifferentin colour, and longer legs. However, we were
very glad of it, and it was very good meat; but the great joy that
poor Xury came with, was to tell me he had found good wa-
ter, and seen no wild mans.
But we found afterwards that we need not take such pains
for water, for a little higher up the creek where we were,
we found the water fresh when the tide was out, which flows
but a little way up: so we filled our jars and feasted on the
hare we had killed, and prepared to go on our way, having
seen no footsteps of any human creature in that part of the
country. .
As I had been one voyage to the coast before, I knew
very well that the islands of the Canaries, and the Cape de Verd
islands also, lay not far off from the coast. But as I had no
instruments to take an observation to know what latitude we
were in, and did not exactly know, or at least not remember,
what latitude they were in, I knew not where to look for
them, or when to stand off to sea towards them; otherwise I
might now easily have found some cf these islands. But
my hope was, that if I stood along this coast till 1 came to
that part where. the English traded, I should find some of
their vessels upon their usual design of trade, that would re-
lieve and take us in.
By the best of my calculation, that place where I now
was, must be that country which, lying between the emperor
of Morocco's dominions and the Negroes, lies waste and un-
inhabited, except by wild beasts, the Negroes having aban-
doned it, and gone farther south, for fear of the Moors; and
the Moors not thinking it worth inhabiting, by reason of its
barrenness, and indeed both forsaking it because of the pro-
digious numbers of tigers, lions, leopards, and other furious
creatures which harbour there, so that the Moors use it for
C
their hunting only, where they go like an army, two or three
thousand men at a time; and indeed for near a hundred miles
together upon this coast, we saw nothing but a waste uninha-
bited country by day, and heard nothing but howlings and
roarings of wild beasts by night.
Once or twice in the day-time, I thought I saw the Pico
of Teneriffe, being the high top ot the mountain Teneriffe
in the Canaries, and had a great mind to venture out in hopes
of reaching thither; but having tried twice, I was forced in
again by contrary winds, the sea also going too high for my
little vessel; so I resolved to pursue my first design; and keep
along the shore.
Several times we were obliged to land for fresh water, af-
ter we had left this place; and once in particular, being ear-
ly in the morning, we came to an anchor under a little point
of land, which was pretty high, and the tide beginning to
flow, we lay still to go farther in. Xury, whose eyes were
more about him, than it seems mine were, calls softly to me,
and tells me that we had best go farther off, the shore,
* For,' says he, ' look, yonder lies a dreadful monster on the
side of that hillock, fast asleep.' I looked where he pointed,
and saw a dreadful monster indeed; for it was a terrible great
lion, that lay on the side of the shore, under the shade ot a
piece of the hill, that hung as it were a little over him,
' Xury,' said I, ' you shall go on shove, and kill him.' Xury
looked frighted, and said, ' Me kill! He eat me at one
mouth!' at one mouthful he meant. However I said no more
to the boy, but bade him be still, and took our biggest gun,
•which was almost musket-bore, and loaded it with a good
charge of powder, and with two slugs, and laid it down; then
1 loaded another gun with two bullets, and the third (for we
had three pieces) 1 loaded with five smaller bullets. I took
the best aim I could with the first piece, to have shot him in
the head; hut hclaysowith hislegraised a little above his nose,
that the slug hit his leg about the knee, and broke the bone.
He started up growling at first, but finding his leg broke,
fell down again, and then got upon three legs, and gave he
most hideous roar that ever 1 heard. I was a little surprised
that I had not hit him on the head: however, ! took np the
second piece immediately; and, though he be .an to move off,
fired a^ain, and shot him Into the head, antl had the pleasure
to see him drop, and making very little noise, he lay strug-
ghng for life. Then Xury took heart, and would have me
let him go on shore. ' Well, go,' said I. So. the boy jump*
cd into the water, and taking a little gun in one hand, swam
to shore with the dther hand, and coming close to the crea-
ture, put the muzzle of the piece to his ear, and shot him
into the head again, which despatched him quite >
This was game indeed to us, but this was no food; and I
was very sorry to lose three charges of powder and shot upon
a creature that was good for nothing to us. However, Xury
said he would have some of him: so he comes on board, and
asked me to give him the hatchet. ' For what, Xury?' said I.
' Me cut off his head,' said he. However, Xuiy could nof
cut off his head, but he cut off a foot, and brought it with
him, and it was a monstrous great one.
I bethonght myself, however, that perhaps the skin of him
might one way or other be of some value to us; and 1 resol-
ved to take off his skin if I,could. So Xury and I went to
work with him, but Xury was much the better workman at
it, for I knew very ill how to do it. Indeed it took us up
both the whole day; but at last we got off the hide of him,
and, spreading it on the top of our cabin, the sun effectually
drjed it in two days time, and it afterwards served me to lie upon.
After this stop we made on to the southward continually,
for ten or twelve days. living very sparingly on our provisions,
-which began to abate very much, and going no oftener in to
the shore than we were obliged to, for fresh water. My de-
sign in this was to make the river Gambia or Senegall, that
is to say, any where about the Cape de Verd, where I was
in hopes to meet with some European ship; and if I did not,
I knew not what course I had to take, but to seek for the
islands, or perish there among the Negroes. I knew that all
the ships from Europe, which sailed either to the coast of
Guinea, or to Brasil, or to the East Indies, made this cape
or those islands, and, in a word, I put the whole of my for-
tune upon this single point, either that I must meet with
some ship or must perish.
When I had pursued this resolution about ten days longer,
as I have said, 1 began to see that the land was inhabited;
and in two or three places, as we sailed by, we saw people
stand upon the shore 1o look at us: we could also perceive
they were quite black, and stark naked. 1 was once inclined
to have gone on shore to them, but Xury was my better
counsellor, and said to me. ' No go, no go.' However, I
hauled in nearer the shore that I might talk to them, and 1
{bund they ran along the shore by me a good way. I ob-
served they had no weapons in their hands, except one, who
had a long slender stick, which Xury said was a lance, and
that they would throw them a great way with good aim: so
I kept at a distance, but talked with them by signs as well as I
could, and particularly made signs for something to eat They
beckoned to me to stop my boat, and they would fetch me
some meat. Upon this I lowered the top of my sail, and lay
by, and two of them ran up into the country, and in less than
half an hour came back and brought with them two pieces of
dry flesh, and some corn, such as is the produce of their
country; but we neither knew what the one or the other was:
however, we were willing to accept it. But how to come at
it, was our next dispute, for I was not for venturing on shore
to them, and they were as much afraid of us; but they took a
safe way for us all, for they brought it to the shore, and laid
it down, and went and stood a great way off, till we fetched
it on board, and then came close to us again.
We made signs of thanks to them, for we had nothing to
make them amends; but an opportunity offered that very in-
stant to oblige them wonderfully; for while we were lying by
the shore, came two mighty creatures, one pursuing the other
(as we took it) with great fury, from the mountams towards
the sea: whether it was the male pursuing the female, or
whether they were in sport or in rage, we could not tell any
more than we could tell whether it was usual or strange; but
I believe it was the latter, because, in the first place, those ra-
venous creatures seldom appear but in the night; and, in the
second place we found the people terribly frighted, especially
the women The man that had the lance or dart did not fly
from them, but the rest did. However, as the two oreatures
ran directly into the water, they did not seem to offer to fall
upon the Negroes, but plunged themselves into the sea, and
swam about as if they had come for their diversion; at last
one of them began to come nearer our boat than at first I ex-
pected, but I lay ready for him, for I had loaded my gun
with all possible expedition, and bade Xury load both the
others. As soon as he came fairly within my reach, I fired,
and shot him directly into the head. Immediately he sunk
down into the water, but he rose instantly, and plunged ups
and down as if he was struggling for life; and so indeed he
was He immediately made to the shore; but, between the
wound, which was his mortal hurt, and the strangling of the
water, he died just before he reached the shore
It is impossible to express the astonishment of these poor
creatures at the noise and fire of my gun: some of them were
ready even to die for fear, and fell down as dead with the
very terror. Rut when they saw the creature dead, and sunk
in the water, and that I made signs to them to come to the
shore, they took heart. and came to the shore, and began to
search for the creature. I found him by his blood staining
tiie water, and by the help of a rcpei which I flung round
him, and gave the Negroes to haul, they dragged him on
shore, and found that it was u most curious leopard, spotted
and fine to an admirable degree; and the Negroes held up
their hands with admiration to think what it was I killed
him with
The other creature, frighted with the flash of fire, and the
noiso of the gun, swam to the shore, and ran up directly to
the mountains, from whence they came, nor-could I at that
distance know what it was. 1 found quickly the Ni groes
were for eating the flesh of this creature, so 1 was willing to
have them take-it as a favour from me, which when I made
signs to them that they might take him they were very
thankful for. Immediately they fell to work with him, and
though they had no knife, yet with a sharpened piece of
wood they took off- his skin as readily, nay, much more readi-
ly than we would have done with a knife. They offered me
some of the flesh, which I declined, making as if I would
give it them, but made signs for the skin, which they gave
me very freely, and brought me a great deal more of their
provision, which though I did not understand, yet I accepted.
Then I made signs to them for some water, and held out
one of my jars to them turning it bottom upward, to show
that it was empty, and that I wanted to have it filled. They
called immediately to some of their friends, and there came
two women, and brought a great vessel made of earth, and
burnt, as I suppose, in the sun: this they set down for me, as
before, and I sent Xury on shore with my jars, and filled
them all three. The women were stark naked as the men.
I was now furnished with roots and corn, such as it was,
and water; and, leaving my friendly Negroes, I made for-
02
ward for about eleven days more, without offering to go
near the shore, till I saw the land run out a great length
into the sea, at about the distance of four or five leagues be-
fore me, and, the sea being very calm, I kept a large offmg
to make this point; at length, doubling the point at about two
leagues from the land, I saw plainly land on the other side to
seaward; then I concluded, as it was most certain indeed, that
this was the Cape de Vcrd, and those the islands, called
from thence Cape de Verd Islands. However, they were at
a great distance, and I could not well tell what"! had best to
do; for if I should be taken with a fresh of wind, I might nei-
ther reach one nor the other.
In this dilemma, as I was very pensive, I stepped into the
cabin, and sat me down, Xury having the helm, when on a
sudden the boy cried out' Master master, a ship was a sail!'
and the foolish boy was frighted out of his wits, thinking it must
needs be some of his master's ships sent to pursue us, when I
knew we were gotten far enough out of their reach. I jump-
ed out of the cabin, and immediately saw not only the ship,
but what she was; viz. that it was a Portuguese ship, anil as,
I thought was bound to the coast of Guinea for Negroes.
But when I observed the course she steered, I was soon con-
vinced they were bound some other way, and did not design
to go any nearer to the shore, upon which I stretched out to
sea as much as I could, resolving to speak with them, if pos-
sible.
With all the sail I could make, I found I should not be able
to come in their way, but that they would be gone by before
I could make any. signal to them; but after I had crowded to
the utmost, and began to despair, they, it seems, saw me by
the help of their perspective-glasses, and that it was some
European boat, which they supposed must belong to some
ship that was lost; so they shortened sail to let me come
up. I was encouraged with this, and as I had my patron's
ancient on board, I made a waft of it to them for a signal
of distress, and fired a gun, both which they saw; for they
told me they saw the smoke, though they did not hear the
gun. Upon these signals they very kindly brought to, and
lay by for me, and in about three hours time I came up with
them.
They asked me what I was in Portuguese, and in Spanish,
and in French; but I understood none of them; but at last a
Scots sailor, who was on board, called to me, and I answered
him, and told him I was an Englishman, that I had made
my escape out of slavery from the Moors at Sallee. Then
they bade me come on board, and very kindly took me in,
and all my goods.
It was an inexpressible joy to me, that any one will believe
that I was thus delivered, as I esteemed it, from such a mi-
serable and almost hopeless condition as I was in. 1 imme-
diately offered all I had to the captain of the ship, as a return
for my deliverance; but lie generously told me, he would
take nothing from me, but that all f had should be delivered
safe to me when I came to the Brasils. ' For,' says he, ' I
. have saved your life on no other terms than as I would be
glad to be saved myself; and it may one time or other be my
lot to be taken up in the same condition. ' Besides,' 6ays he,
'when 1 carry you to the Brasils, so great a way from your
own country, if I should take from you what little you have,
you will he starved there, and then I only take away that life
I have given.' 'No; no,' says he, ' Signor Inglese [Mr. En-
glishman], I will carry you thither in charity, and these
things will help you to buy your subsistence there, and your
passage home again.'
As he was charitable in this proposal, so he was just in the
performance to a tittle; for he ordered the seamen that none
should offer to touch any thing I had: then he took every
thing into his own possession, and gave hack me an exact in-
ventory of them, that I might have ihem again, even so much
as my three earthen jars.
As to my boat, it was a very good one, and that he saw,
and told me he would buy it of me for the ship's use, and
asked me what I would have for it. I told him he had been
so generous to me in every thing, that I could not offer to
make any price of the boat, but left it entirely to him; upon
which he told me he would give me a note of his hand to pay
me SO pieces of eight for it at Brasil, aud when it came there,
if any one offered to give more, he would make it up. He
offered me also GO pieces of eight more for my boy, Xury,
which I was loath to take; not that I was not willing to let the
captain have him, but I was very loath to sell the poor boy's
liberty, who had assisted me so faithfully in procuring my
own. However, when I let him know my reason, he owned
it to be just, and offered me this medinm, that he would give
tlie hoy an obligation to set him free in ten years, if he turn-
ed Christian. Upon this, Xury saying he was willmg to go to
him, I let the captain have him
We had a very good voyage to the Brasils, and arrived in
the Bay de todos los Santos, or All-Saints Bay. in about twen-
ty-two days after And now I was once more delivered from
the most miserable of all conditions of life; and what to do
next with myself, I was to consider.
The generous treatment the captain gave me, I can never
enough remember: he would take nothing of me for my pas-
sage, gave me 20 ducats for the leopard's skin and 40 for the
lion's skin, winch I had in the boat, and caused every thing
I had in the ship to be punctually delivered me; and what I
.was willing to sell, he nought, such as the case of bottles, two
of my guns. and a piece of the lump of bees-wax, for I
had made candles of the rest: in a word, I made about 220
pieces of eight of all my cargo, and with this stock I went oh
shore in the Brasiis
I had not been long here, but being recommended to the
house of a good honest man like himself, who had an ingenio,
as they call it, that is, a plantation and a sugar-house, I lived
-with him some time, and acquainted myself by that means
-with the manner of their planting and making of sugar; and
seeing how well the planters lived, and how they grew rich
suddenly, I resolved, if I could get license to settle there, I
would turn planter among them; resolving, in the meantime,
to find out some way to gel my money which I had left in
London remitted to me To this purpose, getting a kind of
a letter of naturalization, I purchased as much land that was
Cmcured as my money would reach, and formed a plan for
my plantation and settlement, and such a one as might be
suitable to the stock which I proposed to myself to receive
from England
I had a neighbour, a Portuguese of Lisbon. but born of En-
glish parents, v. hose name was Wells, and in much such cir-
cumstances as I was I call him neighbour, because his plan-
tation lay nextto mine, and we went on very sociably together:
my slock was but low as well as his, and we rather planted for
food than any thing else for about two years However, we
began to increase, and our land began to come into order, so
that the third -ear we planted some tobacco and made each
of us a large piece of ground ready for planting canes in the
year to come; but we both wanted help, and now I found,
more than before, I had done wrong in parting with my boy,
Xury.
But, alas! for me to do wrong that never did right, was no
great wonder. I had no reme<ly but to go on I was gotten
into an employment quite remote to my genius, and directly
contrary to the life I delighted in, and for which I forsook my
father's house, and broke through all his good advice; nay, I
was coming into the very middle station, or upper degree of
low life, which my father advised me to before, and which if
I resolved to go (m with, I might as well have staid at home,
and never fatigued myself in the world, as I have done: and I
used often to say to myself, I could have done this as well in
England among my friends, as have gone 5000 miles off to do
it among strangers and savages, in a wilderness, and at such a
distance as never to hear from any part of the world that had
the least knowledge of me.
In this manner I used to look upon my condition with the
utmost regret. I had nobody to converse with, but now and
then this neighbour: no work to be done but by the labour of
my hands; and I used to say, I.lived just like a man cast
away upon some desolate island, that had nobody there but
himself. But how just has it been, and bow should all men
reflect, that, when they compare their present condition with
others that are worse, Heaven may oblige them to make the
exchange, and be convinced of their former felicity, by their
experience! I say, how just has it been, that the truly solitary
life I reflected on in an island of mere desolation should be my
lot, who had so often unjustly compared it with the life which
I then led, in which, had I continued, I had, in all probability,
been exceedingly prosperous and rich!
I was in some degree settled in my measures for carrying
on the plantation, before my kind friend, the captain of the
ship that took me up at sea, went back; for the ship remain-
ed there in providing her loading and preparing for her
.voyage, near three months; when tellmg him what little stock
I had left behind me in London, he gave nre this friendly and
smoere advice: 'Signor Inglese,' says he (for so he always
called me), 'if you will give me letters, and a procuration
here in form to me, with orders to the person who has your
money in London, to send your elTccts to Lisbon, to such per-
sons as 1 shall direct, and such goods as are proper for this
country, I will bring you the produce of them, God willing,
at my return* but since human affairs are all subject to Chan-
ges and disasters, I would have you give orders but for 100?.
sterling, which, you say, is half your stock, and let the httzard
be run for the first, so that if it come safe, you may order the
rest the same way, and if it miscarry, you may have the other
half to have recourse to for ycui supply .- //' -*
This was so wholesome advice, and looked so friendly, that
T cnuld not but be convinced it was the best course I could
take: so I accordingly prepared letters to the gentlewoman
with whom 1 had left my money, and a procuration to the
Portuguese captain as he desired.
I wrote the English captain's widow a full account of all
my adventures, my slavery, escape, and how I had met with
the Portugal captain at sea, the humanity of his behaviour,
and what condition I was now in, with all other necessary di-
rections for my supply; and when tins honest captain came
to Lisbon, he found means. by some of the English merchants
there, to send over not the order only, but a full account of
my story, to a merchant at London, who presented it effec-
tually to her, whereupon she not only delivered the-money,
but out of her own pocket se*t the Portugal captain a very
handsome present for his humanity and charity to me
The merchant in London vested this 100/. in English
goods, such as the captain had written for, sent them direct-
ly to him at Lisbon, and he brought them all safe to me to
the Brasils; among which, without my direction (for 1 was
too young in my business to think of them), he had taken
care to have all sorts of tools, iron work, and utensils neces-
sary for my plantation, and which were of great use to me.
When this cargo arrived, I thought- my fortune made, for
I was surprised with the joy of it. and my good stewart, the
captain, had laid out the 5/ which my friend had sent him for
a present for himself, to purchase and bring me over a ser-
vant, under bond for six years' service. and would not ac-
cept of any consideration except a little tobacco, which I
would have him accept, being of my own produce.
Neither was this all. but my goods being all English manu-
factures, such as cloth, stuff, batze, and things particularly
valuable and desirable m the country. I found means to sell
them to a very great advantage; so that I may say, I had
more than low times the value of my first cargo, and was
now infinitely beyond my poor neighbour, I mean in the ad-
vancement of my plantation; for- the first thing I did, I
bought me a Negro slave ajid an European servant also : I
mean another besides that which the captain brought me
from Lisbon.
But as abased prosperity is oftentimes made the very means
of our .greatest adversity, so was it with me 1 went ou the
next year with great success in my plantation: I raised fifty
great rolls of tobacco on my own ground, more than I had
disposed of for necessaries among my neighbours, and these
fifty rolls being each of above 100 lb. weight, were well -cured
and laid by agamst the return of the fleet from Lisbon. And
now increasing in business and wealth, my head began to be
full of projects and undertakings beyond my reach, such as
are indeed often the ruin of the best heads "m business.
had I continued in the station 1 was now in, I had room
for all the happy things to have yet befallen me, for which
my lather so earnestly recommended a quiet retired life, and
which he had so sensibly described the middle station of life
to be full of; but other things attended me, and I was still to
be trie wilful agent of all my own miseries: and particularly
to mcrease my fault, and double the reflections upon myself
which in my future sorrows I should have leisure to make. all
these miscarriages were procured by my apparent obstinate
adhering to my foolish inclination of wandering abroad, and
pursuing that inclination in contradiction to the clearest
views of doing myself good in a fair and plain pursuit of
those prospects, and those measures of life, which Nature
and Providence concurred to present me with, and to make
my duty. " --
As I had once done thus in breaking away from my pa-
rents so 1 could not be content now; but I must go and leave
the happy view I had of being.a rich and thriving man in my
new plantation, and to pursue a rash and immoderate desire
of rismg faster ihan the nature of the thing admitted; and
thus I cast myself down again into the deepest gulf of human.
misery that'ever man fell into, or perhaps could be cousia-
tent with life, and a state of health in the world.
To come then by just degrees to the particulars of this part
of my story. You may suppose that having now lived almost
four years in the lirasils, and beginning to thrive and prosper
very well upon my plantation, I had not only learned the
language, but had contracted acquaintance and friendship
among my fellow-planters, as well as among the merchants at
St. Salvadore, which was our port? and that, in my discourse
among them, 1 had frequently given them an account of my
two voyages to the coast of Guinea, the manner of trading
with the Negroes there, and how easy it wastQ purchase upon.
the coast, for trifles, such as heads, toys, knives, scissars, hat-
chets, bits of glass, and the like, not only gold dust, Guinea-
grains, elephants' teeth, &c. but Negroes for the service of
the Brasils, in great numbers.
They listened always very attentively to my discourses on
these heads, but especially to that part which related to the
buying of Negroes, which was a trade at that time not only
not far entered into, but as far as it was, had been parried on
by the assientos, or permission of the kings of Spain and
Portugal, and engrossed in the public stock, so that few Ne.
groes were bought, and those excessive dear.
It happened, being in company one day with some mer-
chants and planters of my acquaintance, and talking of those
things very earnestly, three of them came to me the next
morning, and told me they had been musing very much upon
what I had discoursed of with them the last night, and they
came to make a secret proposal to mej and, after enjoining
me secrecy, they told me that they had a mind to fit out a
ship to go to Guinea; that they had all plantations as well as
I, and were straitened for nothing so much as servants; that
as it was a trade that could not be carried on, because they
could not publicly sell the Negroes when they came home, so
they desired to make but one voyage, to bring the Negroes
on shore privately, and divide them among their own planta-
tions; and, in a word, the question was, whether I Would go
their supercargo in the ship, to manage the trading part upon
the coast of Guinea? and they offered me that I should have
my equal share of the Negroes without providing any |>art of
the stock.
This was a fair proposal, it must be confessed, had it been
made to any one that had not had a settlement and planta-
tion of his own to look after, which was in a fair way of com-
ing to be very considerablev and with a good stock upon it.
But for me that was thus established, and had nothing to
do but go on as I had begun for three or four years more,
and to have sent for the other lQQl. from England, and who
e
in that time, and with that little addition, could scarce have
failed of being worth 3 or 4O0tW. sterling, and that increasing
too; for me to think of such a voyage, was the most prepos«
terous thing that ever man, in such circumstances could be
guilty of
But I, that was born to be my own destroyer, could no
more resist the offer, than 1 could restrain my first rambling
designs, when my father's good counsel was lost upon me. In
a word, I told them 1 would go with all my heart, if they
would undertake to look after my plantation in my absence,
and would dispose of it to such as I should direct, if I miscar-
ried. This they all engaged to do, and entered into wiytings
or covenants to do so; and I made a formal will, disposing of
iy plantation and effects, in case of my death, making the
iptain of the ship that had saved my life, as before, my uni-
ersal heir, but obliging him to dispose of my effects as t had
directed in my will: one half of the produce being to himself,
and the other to be shipped to England.
In short, I tyiok all possible caution to preserve my effects,
and to keep up my plantation Had I used half as much pru-
dence to have looked mto my own interest, and have made a
judgment of what I ought to have done, and not to have
done, I had certainly never gone away from so prosperous
an undertaking, leaving all the probable views of a thrivmg
circumbtance, and gone upon a voyage to sea, attended with
all its comm^i hazards, to say nothing of the reasons 1 had
to expect particular misfortunes to myself.
But I was hurried on, and obeyed blindly the dictates of
my fancy, rather than my reason; and, accordingly, tho
ship being fitted out, and the cargo furnished, and all things
done as by agreement by my partners in the voyage, I went
ron board in an evil hour again, the 1st of September, 1G59,
being the same day eight years that I went from my father
and mother at Hull, in order to Set the rebel to their autho-
rity, and the fool to my own interest.
Our ship was about 120 tons burden, carried six gaps, and
fourteen men, besides the master, his boy, and myself We
had on board no largi cargo of goods, except of such toys as
were fit for our trade with the negroes, such as beads, bits of
glass, shells, and odd trifles, especially little looking-glasses,
luitvcs, scissars, liattlicts, and the like.
D
The same day I went on board, we set sail, standing away
to the northward upon our own coast, with design to stretch
over for the African coast, when they came into about
ten or twelve degrees of northern latitude, which, it seems,
was the manner of their course in those days. We had very
good weather, only excessive hot all the way upon our own
coast, till we came to the height uf Cape St. Augustino, from
whence keeping farther off at sea, we lost sight of land, and
steered as if we were bound for the Isle of Fernand de No-
ronba, holding our course N.E. by N. and leaving those isles
on the east In this course we passed the line in about twelve
days' time, and were, by our last observation, in 7 degrees
22 minutes, northern latitude, when a violent tornado or hur-
ricane took us quite out of our knowledge: it began from ihe
southeast, came about to the northwest, and then settle*
into the north-east, from whence it blew in such a terribl
manner that for twelve days together we could do nothing
but drive; and scudding away before it, let it carry us where-
ever fate and the fury of the winds directed: and during these
twelve days, 1 need not say that I expected every day to be
swallowed up, nor did any in the ship expect to save their
.lives. . I
In this distress we had, besides the terror of the storm,
one of our men died of the calenture and one man and.
the bov washed overboard. About the twelfth day, the wea.
ther abating a little, the master made an observation as
well as he could, and found that he was in about 11 degrees
of north latitude, but that be was 22 degrees of longitude dif-
ference west iVoiu Cape St. August ino, so that he found he
was gotten upon the coast of Guiaua, or the north part of
Israsil, beyond the river Amazones, towards that of the rive
Oronnoque, commonly called the Great River: and now he1
began to consult wilh me what course he should take, for the
ship was leaky, and very much disabled, and he was for go-
ing directly back to the coast of Brasil.
I was positively against that; and, looking over the charts
of the sea-coast of America with him, we concluded there was
no inhabited country for us to have recourse to, till we came
within the circle of the Caribbee Islands, and therefore resolved
to stand away for Barhadoes, which, by keeping off at sea, to
avoid the in-draugbt of the Bay or Gulf of Mexico, we might
easily perform, as we hoped, in about fifteen days' sail:
whereas we eoulil not possibly make our voyage to the coast
of Africa, without some assistance both to our ship, and to
ourselves.
With this design, we changed our course, and steered
away N.W. by W. in order to reach some of our English
islands, where I hoped for relief; but our voyage was other-
wise determined: for, being in the latitude of V2 degrees, 18
minutes, a second storm came upon us, which carried us
away with the same impetuosity westward, and drove us so
out of the very way of all human commerce, that had all our
lives been saved, as to the sea, we were rather in danger of
being devoured by savages, than ever returning to our own
country.
In this distress, the wind still blowing very hard, one of ouv
men, early one morning cried out, 'Land!' and we had no
sooner run out of the cabin to look out, in hopes of seeing
whereabouts in the world we were, but the ship struck upon
a sand, and, in a moment, her motion being so stopped, the
sea broke over her in such a manner that we expected we
should all have perished immediately; and we were even driven
into our close quarters, to shelter us from the very foam and
spray of the sea.
It is not easy for any one, who has not been in the 'ike
condition, to describe or conceive the consternation of men
,7\ In such circumstances. We knew nothmg where we were,
pr upon what land it was we were driven, whether an island
or the main, whether inhabited or not inhabited; and as the
rage of the wind.was still great, though rather less than at
first, we could not so much as hope to have the ship hold
many minutes without breasing in pieces, unless the winds,
ybt by a kind of miracle, should turn immediately about In a
Jm word, we sat looking one upon another, and expecting death
every moment, and every man acting accordingly, as prepar-
ing for another world, for there was little or nothing more
for us to do in this: that which was our present comfort, and
all the comfort we had, was that, contrary to our expectation,
the ship did not break yet, and that the master said the wind
began to abate.
Now, though we thought that the wind did a little abate,
yet the ship having thus struck upon the sand, and sticking too
fast for us to expect her getting off, we were in a dreadful
condition indeed, and had nothing to do but to think of" saving
our lives as well as we could. We had a boat at our stern,
just before the storm, but she was first staved by dashing
against the ship's rudder, and in the next place she broke
away, and either sunk or was driven off to sea, so there
was -io hope from her. We had another boat on board, but
how to get her off into the sea, was a doubtful thing How.
. ever, there was no room to debate, for we fancied the ship
would break in pieces every minute; and some told us she
Was actually broken already.
In this distress, the mate of our vessel lays hold of the
boat, and with the help of the rest of the men, they got her
flung over the ship's side, and getting all into her, let go, and
committed ourselves, being eleven in number, to God's mer-
cy, and the wild sea; for though the storm was abated consi-
derably, yet the sea went dreadfully high upon the shore, .
and might well be called, ' Den wild zee,' as the Dutch call
the sea in a storm.
And now our case was very dismal indeed, for we all saw
plainly that th^e sea went so high, that the boat could not es-
cape, and that we should be inevitably drowned As to
making sail, we had none; nor if we had, could we have done
any thing with it; so we worked at the oar towards the land,
though with heavy hearts, like men going to execution; for
we all knew, that when the boat came near the shore, she
would be dashed in a thousand pieces, by the breach of
the sea. However, we committed our souls to God in the
most earnest manner, and the wind driving us towards the
shore, we hastened our destruction with our own hands,
pulling, as well as we could, towards land
What the shore was whether rock or sand, whether steep
or sho»l, we knew not; the only hope that could rationally
give us the least shadow of expectation, was, if we might
happen into some bay or gulf, or the mouth of some river,
-where, by great chance, we might have run our boat in, or
got under the lee of the land, and perhaps made smooth
water. But there was nothing of this appeared; but as we
made nearer and nearer the shore, the land looked more
frightful than the sea
After we had rowed or rather driven, about a league and
a half, as we reckoned it, a raging wave, mountain like, came
rolling astern of us, and plainty bade us expect the ' coup de
trace.' Jbri a word, it took us with such a fury, that it over-
-\
set the boat at once, and separating us as well from the boat
as from one another, gave us not time hardly to say,' O God!'
for we were all swallowed up in a moment.
Nothing can describe the confusion of thought which I felt
when I sunk into the water, for though 1 swam very well,
yet I could not deliver myself from the waves so as to draw
breath, till that wave having driven me, or rather carried me
a vast way on towards the shore, and having spent itself,
went back, and left me upon the land almost dry, but half
dead with the water I took in. I had so much presence of
mind, as well as breath left, that seeing myself nearer the
main land than I expected, I got upon my feet, and endea-
voured to make on towards the land, as fast as I could, before
another wave should return, and take me up again. But I
soon found it was impossible to avoid it, for I saw the sea
come after me as high as a great hill, and as furious as an
enemy, which I bad no means or strength to contend with;
my business was to h61d my breath, and raise myself upon
the water, if I could, and so by swimming to preserve my
breathing, and pilot myself towards the shore, if possible; my
greatest concern now being that the wave, as it would carry
me a great way towards the shore when it came on, might
not carry me back again with it, when it gave back towards
the sea
The wave that came upon me again, buried me at once
twenty or thirty feet deep in its own body, and I could feel
myself carried with a mighty force a»d swiftness towards the
shore a very great way; but I held my breath, and assisted
myself to swim still forward with all my might 1 was ready
to burst with holding my breath, when, as I felt myself rising
up, so to my immediate relief, I found my head and hands
shoot out above the surface of the water; and though it was
not two seconds of time that I could keep myself so, yet it
relieved me greatly, gave me breath and new courage 1 was
covered again with water a good while, but not so long but I
held it out, and findmg the water had spent itself, and began
to return, I struck forward against the return of the waves,
and felt ground again with my feet. I stood still a few mo-
ments to recover breath, and till the water went from me,
and then I took to rny heels, and ran witli what strength I
had, farther towards the shore. But neither would this deli-
ver me from the fury of the sea, which came pouring in after
I) 2
me again, and twice more I was lifted up by the waves, and
carriei forwards as before,: the shore being very flat.
The last time of these two had well near been fatal to me;
for the sea having hurried me along as before, landed me, or
rather dashed me, against a piece of a rock, and that with such
force as it left me senseless, and indeed helpless, as to toy
own deliverance; for the blow taking my side and breast,
beat the breath, as it were, quite out of my body, and had it
-returned again immediately, I must have been strangled in
the water; but I recovered a little before the return of the
waves, and seeing I should be covered again with the water,
I resolved to hold fast by a piece of the rock, and so to hold
my breath, if possible, till the wave went back. Now, as
the waves were not so high as at first, being near land, I held
my hold till the wave abated, and then fetched another run,
which brought me so rear the shore, that the next wave, though
it went over me, yet did not so swallow me up as to carry
me away; and the next run I took, I got to the main land,
where to my great comfort, I clambered up the cliffs of the
shore, and sat me down upon the grass, free from danger,
and quite out of the reach of the water
1 was now landed and safe on shore, and began to look up
and thank God that my life was saved, in a case wherein
there was some minutes before scarce any room to hope. . I
believe it is impossible to express to the life, what the ecsta-
sies and transports of the soul are when it is so saved, as I may
' say, out of the very grave: and 1 do not wonder now at lhat
custom, viz. that when a malefactor, who has the halter
about his neck, is tied up, and just going to be turned off, anil
lias a reprieve brought to him; 1 say, I do not wonder that
they bring a surgeon with it, to let him blood that very mo-
ment they tell him of it, that the surprize may not drive the
animal spirits from the heart, and overwhelm him:
For sudden joys, like griefs, confound at first.
I walked about on the shore, lifting up my hands, and my
whole being. as I may say, wrapt up in the contemplation of
my deliverance, making a thousand gestures and motions
which I cannot describe, reflecting upon all my comradesthat
were drowned, and that there should not be one soul saved
hut myself: for, as for litem, I never saw them afterwards, or

«ny sign of them, except three of their hats, one cap, and
tvio shoes that were not fellows.
I cast my eyes to the stranded vessel, when the hreach and
froth of the sea being so big, I eould hardly see it, it lay so
far off: and considered, Lord! how was it possible 1 could get
on shore! *-
After I had solaced my mind with the comfortable part of
my condition, I began to look round me, to see what kind of
place I was in, and what was next to he done, and I soon
found my comforts abate, and that in a word, I had a dread-
ful deliverance for I was wet, had no clothes to shift me,
nnr any thing either to eat or drink to comfort me, neither
did I see any prospect before me, but that of perishing w ith
hunger, or being devoured by wild beasts; and that which
-was particularly afflictmg to me, was, that I had no weapon
either to hunt and kill any creature for my sustenance, or to
defend myself against any other creature that might desire
to kill me for theirs. In a word, I had nothing about me but
. a knife, a tobacco-pipe, and a little tobacco in a box; this was
all my prevision, and this threw me into terrible agouies of
mind| that for a while I ran about like a madman. Night
coming upon me, I began, with a heavy heart, to consider
what would be my lot, if there were any ravenous beasts in
that country, seeing at night they always come abroad for
their prey.
All the remedy that offered to my thoughts at that time-
was, to get up into a thick bushy tree, like a fir, but thorny,
which grew near me, and where I resolved to sit all night,
and consider the next day what death I should die; for, as yet,
I saw no prospect of life. I walked about a furlong from the
shore, to see if I could find any fresh water to drink, which T
did to my great joy; and having drank, and put a little to-
bacco m my mouth, to prevent hunger, I went to the tree,
and getting up into it, endeavoured to place myself so as that
if I should sleep, I might not fall; and having cut me a short
stick like a truncheon, for my defence, I took up my lodg-
ing; and having been excessively fatigued, I fell fast asleep,
and slept as comfortably as I believe few could have done in
my condition; and found myself the most refreshed with it
that 1 think I ever was on such occasion.
When I waked, it was broad day, the weather clear, and
the storm abated, so that the sea did not rage and swell a«
^
before; but that which surprised me most, was, that the ship
-was lifted off, in the night, from the sand where she lay, by
the swelling of the tide, and was driven up almost as far as the
rock, which I first mentioned, where I had been so bruised
by the dashing me against it. This being within about a mile
from the shore where I was, and the ship seeming to stand
upright still, I wished myself onboard, that, at least, I might
save some necessary things for myuse.
When I came down from my apartment in the tree, 1
looked about me again, and the first thing I found was the
boat, which lay as the wind and the sea had tossed her upon
the land, about two miles on my right hand. I walked as far
as I could upon the shore, to have got to her, but found a
neck or inlet of water between me and the boat, which was
about half a mile broad; so I came back for the present, being
more intent upon getting at the ship, where I hoped to find
something for my present subsistence.
A little after noon I found the sea Tery calm, and the tide
ebbed so far out, that I could come within a quarter of a mile '
of the ship; 'and here I found a fresh renewing of my grief;
fori saw evidently that if we had kept on board we bad-been.
all safe, that is to say, we had all got safe on shore, and I had not
been so miserable as to be left entirely destitute of all comfort
and company, as I now was. This forced tears from my
eyes again; but as there was little relief in that, I resolved, if
possible, to get to the ship; sol pulled off my clothes, for the
weather was hot to extremity, and took the water; but,
when I came to the ship, my difficulty was still greater to
know how to get on board; for as she lay aground, and high
out of the water, there was nothing within my reach to lay hold
of. I swam round her twice, and the second time I espied a
small piece of rope, which I wondered I did not see at first,
hang down by the fore-chains, so low as that with great diffi-
culty I got hold of it, and, by the help of that rope, got up into
the forecastle of the ship. Here I found that the ship was
bulged, and had a great deal of water in her hold, but that she
lay so on the side of a bank of hard sand, or rati er eai _h, that
her stern lay lifted up upon the bank, and her head low al-
most to the water; by this means all her quarter was free,
and all that was in that part was dry; for you may be sure my
first work was to search and to see what was spoiled, and
what was free; and first I found that all the ship's provisions
were dry and untouched by the waters and being Terv well
disposed to eat, I went to the bread room, and tilled my
pockets-with biscuit, and eat it as • wrnt about other things,
fori had no time to lose. I also found some rum in the great
cabin, of which I took a large dram, and which I had indeed
need enough of, to spirit me for what was before me. Now
I wanted nothing but a boat to furnish invself with many
things which I foresaw would be very necessary to me.
It was vain to sit still and wish for what was not to be had,
and this extremity roused my application We had several
spare yards, and two or three large spars of wood, and a spare
top-mast or two in the ship; I resolved to fall to work with
these, and flung as many of them overboard as I could
manage for their weight, tying every one with a rope, that
they might not drive away. When this was done, I went
down the ship's side, and pulling them to me, I tied four of
them fast together at both ends, as well as I could, in the
form of a raft, and laying two or three short pieces of plunk
upon them crossways I found I could walk upon it very well,
but that it was not able to bear any great weight, the pieces
being too light; so I went to work, and, with a carpenter's
saw, I cut a spare top-mast into three lengths, and added
them to my raft, with a great deal of labour and pains; but
the hope of furnishing myself with necessaries encouraged
me to go beyond what I should have been able to have done
upon another occasion
My raft was now strong enough to bear any reasonable
weight. My next care was what to load it with, and how to
preserve what I laid upon it from the surf of the sea: but I
was, not long considering this; I first laid all the planks or
boards upon it that I could get, and having considered well
what I most wanted, I first got three of the seamen's chests,
which I had broken open and emptied, and 'lowered them
down upon my raft. The first of these I filled with provi-
sions, viz. bread, rice, three Dutch cheeses, five pieces of
dried goat's flesh, which we lived much upon, and a little re-
mainder of European corn, which had been laid by for some
fowls which we brought to sea with us, but the fowls were
killed: there had been some barley and wheat together, but,
to my great disappointment, I found afterwards that the rats
had eaten or spoiled it all. As tor liquors, I found several
cases of bottles belonging to our skipper, in which were some
cordial waters, and in all about live or six gallons of arrack:
these I stowed by themselves, there being no need to put
them into the chest, nor any room for them. While I was
doing this, I found the tide began to flow, though very calm,
and I had the mortification to see my coat, shirt, and waist-
coat, which I had left on shore upon the sand, swim away:
as for my breeches', which were only linen and open knee'd,
I swam on board in them and my stockings. However, this
put me upon rummaging for clothes, of which I found enough,
but took no more than I wanted for present use, for I had
other things which my eye was more upon: as first, tools to
work with on shore, and it was after long searching that I
found out the carpenter's chest, which was indeed a very
useful prize to me, and much more valuable than a ship-load-
ing of gold would have been at that time. I got it down to
my raft, even whole as it was, without losing time to look into
it, for I knew in general what it contained.
My next care was for some ammunition and arms. There
were two very good fowling pieces in the great cabin, and two
pistols; these I secured first, with some powder horns, a'
small bag of shot, and two old rusty swords. I knew there
were three barrels of powder in the ship, but knew not
where our gunner had stowed them, but with much search I
found them, two of them dry and good, the third had taken
water: those two I got to my raft, with the arms And now
I thought myself pretty well freighted, and began to think
how I should get to shore with them, having neither sail, oar,
or rudder, and the least cap-full of wind would have overset
all my navigation.
I had three encouragements. First, A smooth and calm
sea. Secondly, The tide rising and setting in to the shore.
Thirdly, What little wind there was, blew me towards the
land. And thus, having found two or three broken oars .be-
longing to the boat, and besides the tools which were in the
chest, I found two saws, an ax, and a hammer; and with this
cargo I put to sea. For a mile, or thereabouts, my raft went
very well, only that I found it drive a little distant from the
place where I had landed before, by which I perceived that
there was some indraught of the water, and consequently I
hoped to find some creek or river there, which I might make
use of as a port to get to land with my cargo.
As I imagined, so it was: there appeared before me a little
opening of the land. I found a strong current of the tide set
into it, so I guided my rait as well as I could, to keep in the
middle of the stream. But here I had like to have suffered
a second shipwreck, which, if I had, 1 think verily would
have broken my heart; for knowing nothing of the coast, my
raft run aground at one end of it, upon a shoal, and not being
aground at the other end, it wanted but a little that all my
cargo had slipped off towards that end that was afloat, and so
fallen into the water: I did my utmost by setting my back
against the chests, to keep them in their places, but could not
thrust off the raft with all my strength; neither durst I stir
from the posture I was in, but, holding up the chests with all
my might, stood in that manner near half an hour, in which
time the rising of the water bi ought me a little more upon a
level: and a little after, the water still rising, my raft floated
again, and I thrust her off with the oar I had, into the chan-
nel and then driving up higher, I at length found myself in
the mouth of a little river, with land on both sides, and a
strong current of tide running up. I looked on both sides for
a proper place to get on shore, for I was not willing to be dri-
ven too high up the river, hoping in time to see some ship at
sea, and therefore resolved to place myself as near the coast
as I could.
At length I spied a little cove on the right shore of the
creek, to which with great pain and difficulty I guided my
raft, and at last got so near, as that, reaching ground with my
oar, I could thrust her directly in; bat here 1 had like to have
dipped all my cargo in the sea again; for that shore lying
pretty steep, that is to say, sloping, there was no place to
land, but where one end of the float, if it ran on shore, would
lie so high, and the other sink lower, as before, that it would
endanger my cargo again. All that I could do, was to wait till
the tide was at the highest, keeping the raft with my oar,
like an anchor, to hold the side of it fast to the shore, near a
flat piece of ground, which I expected the water would flow
over; and so it did. As soon as I found water enough (for
my raft drew about a foot of water), I thrust her upon that
flat piece of ground, and there fastened or moored her, by
sticking my two broken oars into the ground, one on one side
near one end, and one on the other side, near the other end;
:
and thus 1 lay till the wftter ebbed away, and left my raft and
all my cargo safe on shore.
My next work was to view the country, and seek a proper
place for my habitation, and where to stow my goods, to se-
cure them from whatever might happen. Where I was, I
yet knew not; whether on the continent, or on an island;
whether inhabited, or not inhabited; whether in danger of
wild beasts or not There was a hill not above a mile from
me, which rose up very steep and high, and which seemed to
overtop some other hills, which lay as in a ridge from it north-
ward. I took out one of the fowling-pieces, and one of the
pistols, and a horn of powder, and, thus armed, I travelled
for discovery up to the top of that hill, where, after I had
with great labour and difficulty got up, I immediately saw
my fate, to my great affliction; viz. that I was in an island,
environed every way with the sea, no land to be seen, except
some rocks, which lay a great way off, and two small islands,
less than this, which lay about three leagues to the west.
I found also that the islam) X was in was barren, and, as I
saw good reason to believe, uninhabited, except by wild
beasts, of which, however, I saw none, yet I saw abundance
of fowls, but knew not their kinds, neither, when I killed
them, could I tell what was fit for food, and what not. ' At
my coming back, I shot at a great bird, which I saw sitting
upon a tree,on the side of a large wood. I believe it was the
first gun that had been fired there, since the creation of the
world. I had no sooner fired, but from all the parts of the
wood there arose an extraordinary number of fowls, of many
sorts, mxking a confused screaming and crying. every one
- according to his U6ual note; but not one of them of any kind that
I knew As for that creature I killed, I took it to be a kind
of a hawk, its colour and beak resembling it, but it had no
talons or claws more than common: its flesh was carrion, and
fit for nothing.
Contented with this discovery, I came back to my raft, and
fell to work to bring my cargo on shore, which took me the
rest of the day What to do with myself at night, I knew not,
nor indeed where to rest, for I was afraid to lie down on the
ground. not knowing but some wild beast might devour me,
though I afterwards found there was really no need for those
fears.
However, as well as i could, I barricadoed myself round
with the chests and boards that I had brought on shore, and
made a kind of a hut for that night's lodging: as for food, I
yet saw not which way to supply myself, except that I hid
seen two or three creatures, like hares, run out of the wood
where I shot the fowl.
I now began to consider that 1 might yet get a great many
tilings out of the ship, which would be useful to me, and par-
ticularh some of the rigging and sails, and such other things
as might come to hand, and I resolved to make another
voyage on board the vessel, if possible; and as I knew that
the first storm that blew must necessarily break her all in
pieces,I resolved to set all other things apart, till i got every
thing out of the ship that I could get: then I called a council-
that is to say, in my thoughts, whether I should take back the
raft, but this appeared impracticable, so 1 resolved to go as
before, when the tide was down, and F did so, only that I
stripped before I went from my hut, havmg nothing on but
a checkered shirt, a pair of linen drawers, and a pair of pumps
on my feet.
I got on board the ship as before, and prepared a second
raft; and having had experience of the first, I neither made
this so unwieldy, nor loaded it so hard; but yet I brought
away several things very usefol to me; as first. in the cai-pen-
ter's store 1 found two or three bags full of nails and spikes,
a great screw jack, a dozen or two of hatchets, and, above
all, that most useful thing called a grindstone: all these I se-
cured, together with several things belonging to the gunner,
particularly two or three iron crows, and two barrels of mus-
ket tmllets, seven muskets, and another fowling-piece, with
some small quantity of powder more; a large bag full of small
shot, and a great roll of sheet lead: but this last was so heavy
1 could not hoist it up to get it over the shjp's side.
Besides these things, 1 took all the men's clothes that I
could find, and a spare fore-top-sail, hammock, and some bed-
ding; and with this I loaded my second raft, and brought them
also all safe on shove, to my very great comfort.
I was under some apprehensions during my absence from
the land, that at least my provisions might be devoured on
shore; but when I came back, I found no sign of any nsiior,
only there sat a creature like a wild cat upon one of the
chests, which, .vlicii I came towards it, ran away to a little di»-
E
tance, and then stood still. She sat very composed and un-
concerned,-and looked full in my face, as if she had a mind to
be acquainted with me. I presented my gun at her, but as
she did not understand it, she was perfectly unconcerned at
it, nor did she offer to stir away; upon which I tossed her a
bit of biscuit, though by the way I was not very free of it,
for my store was not great. However, I spared her a bit, I
say, and she went to it, smelled of it, and eat it, and looked
(as pleased) for more; but I thanked her, and could spare no
more, so she marched off.
Having got my second cargo on shore (though I was fain
to open the barrels of powder, and bring them by parcels, for
they were too heavy, being large casks,) I went to work to
make a little tent with the sail and some poles which I cut for
that purpose; and into this tent I brought every thing that I
knew would spoil, either with rain or sun; and I piled all the
empty chests and casks up in a circle round the tent, to for-
tify it from any sudden attempt, either from man or beast.
When 1 had done this, I blocked up the door of the tent
with some boards within, and an empty chest set up on end
without, and spreading one of the beds upon the ground, lay-
ing my two pistols just at my head, and my gun at length by
me, I went to bed, fur the first time, and slept very quietly
all night, being very weary and heavy, for the night before I
had slept little, and had laboured very hard all day, as
well to fetch those things from the ship, as to get them on shore.
I had the biggest magazine of all kinds now that ever were
laid up, I believe, for one man; but I was not satisfied still,
for while the ship sat upright in that posture, 1 thought I
ought to get every thing out of her that 1 could: so every-
day, at low water, I went on board. and brought away some-
thing or other. But particularly the third time I went, I
brought away as much of the rigging as I could, as also all
the small ropes and rope-twine I could get, with a piece of
spare canvas, which was to mend the sails upon occasion,'and
the barrel of wet gunpowder. In a word, I brought away all
the sails first and last, only that I was fain to cut them in pie-
ces, and bring as much at a time as I could; for they were no
more useful to me for sails, but as mere canvas only.
But that which comforted me more still, was, that at last of all
after I bad made five or six such voyages as these, and thought
I had nothing more to expect from the ship that was worth
my meddling with, I say, after all this, I found a great hogs-
head of bread; three large runlets of rum or spirits, a box of
sugar, and a barrel of tine flour: this was surprising to me,
because 1 had given over expecting any more provisions, ex-
cept what was spoiled by the water. I soon emptied the
hogshead of that bread, and wrapt it up, parcel by parcel, in
pieces of the sails, which I cut out; and, in a word, I got all
this safe on shore also, though at several times.
The next day I made another voyage, and now having
plundered the ship of what was portable, and lit to hand out,
I began with the .cables; and cutting the great cable into pie-
ces, such as I could move, I got two cables and a haulser on
shore, with all the iron-work I could get; and having cut down
the sprit-sail-yard, and the mizen-yard, and every thing I
could to make a large raft, I loaded it with all those heavy
goods, and came away. But my good luck began to leave me,
for this raft was so unwieldy, and so overladen, that after I
was entered the little cove, where I had landed the rest of my
goods, not being able to guide it so handily as I did the other,
it overset, and threw me and all my cargo into the water. As
for myself, it was no great harm, fori was near the shore;
but as to my cargo it was great part of it lost, especially the
iron, which I expected would have been of great use to me.
However, when the tide was out, I got most of the pieces of
cable ashore; and some of the iron, though with infinite la-
bour, for I was fain to dip for it into the water, a work which
fatigued me very much. After this, I went every day on
board, and brought away what I could '.;et.
I had been now thirteen days on shore, and had been
eleven times on board the ship, in which time I had brought
away all that one pair of hands could well be supposed capa-
ble to bring, though I believe verily, had the calm weather
held, I should have brought away the whole ship, piece by
pieee' But preparing the twelfth time to go on board, I
found the wind began to rise: however, at low water, I went
on board; and though I thought I had rummaged the cabin so
effectually, as that nothing more could be found, yet I disco-
vered a locker, with drawers in it, in one of which 1 found
two or three razors, and one pair of large scissors, with
ten or a dozen good knives and forks; in another I found
about thirty-six pounds value in money, some European
coin, some Iirasil, some pieces of eight, some gold, some silver.
I smiled to myself at the sight of this money. «0 drug!'
laid I, aloud, ' what art thou good for? Thou art not -worth
to me, no, not the taking off the ground. One of those knives
is worth all this heap. I have no manner of use for thee:
even remain where thou art, and go to the bottom as a crea-
ture whose life is not worth saving!' However, upon second
thoughts I took it away, and wrapping all this in a piece of
canvas. I began to think of making another raft. hut while I
was preparing [his, I found the sky overcast, and the wind
began to rise, and in a quarter of an hour it blew a fresh gale
from the shore; it presently occurred to me, that it was" in
vain to pretend to make a raft, with the wind off shore, and
that it was my business to be gone before the tide of flood be-
gan, otherwise I might not be able to reach the shore at all:
accordingly, I let myself down into the water, and swam
across the channel, which lay between the ship and the sand,
and even that with difficulty enough, partly with the weight
of the things I had about me, and partly with the roughness
of the water; lor the wind rose very hastily, and before it was
quite high water, it blew a storm.
But I was gotten home to my little tent, where I lay with
all my wealth about me very secure; it blew very hard all
that night; and in the morning, when I looked out, behold,
no more ship was to be seen! I was a little surprised,
but recovered myself with this satisfactory reflection; viz.
thai I had lost no time, nor abated any diligence, to get every
thing out of her tnat could be useful to me; and that indeed
there was little left in her that I was able to bring away, if I
had had more time I now gave over any more thought of
the ship, or of any thing out of her, except what might drive
on shore from her wreck, as indeed divers pieces of her af-
terwards did; but those things were of small use to me.
M> thoughts were now wholly employed about securing
myself against either savages, if any should appear, or wild
beasts if any were in the island: and I had many thoughts of
the method how to do this, and what kind of dwelling fo
make; whether I should make me a cave in the earth, or a
tent upon the earth- and, in short, I resolved upon both; the
manner and description of which it may not be improper to
give an account of
I soon found the place I was in was not for my settlement,
'particularly because it was upon a low moorish ground near
the sea, and I believed would not he wholesome, aad more
particularly because there was no fresh water near it; so I
resolved to hud a more healthy and more convenient spot of
ground.
I consulted several things in my situation, which I found
would be proper for me; first, health and fresh water, as I
just now mentioned; secondly, shelter from the heat of the
sun; thirdly, security from ravenous creatures, whether man
or beast; fourthly, a view to the sea, that if God sent any
ship in sight, I might not lose any advantage for my delive.
ranee, for which I was not willing to banish all my expectation
yet.
In search of a place proper for this, I found a little
plain on the side of a rising hill, whose front towards this lit-
tle plain, was as steep as a house-side, so that nothing could
comedown upon me from the top. On the side of this rock
there was a hollow place, worn a little way in, like the en-
trance or door of a cave, but there was not really any cave or
way into the rock at all.
On the flat of the green, just before this hollow place, I re-
solved to pitch my tent. This plain was not above a hundred
yards broad, and about twice as long, and lay like a green be-
fore my door, and at the end of it descended irregularly
every way down into the low grounds by the sea-side. It was
on the N. N. W. side of the hill, so that it was sheltered from
the heat every day, till it came to a W. and by S sun, or
(hereabouts. which in those countries is near the setting.
Before I set up my tent, I drew a half-circle before the
loJIow place, whieh took in about ten yards in its semi-dia-
meter, from the rock, and twenty yards in its diameter, from.
its beginning and ending.
In this half-circle I pitched (wo rows of strong stakes, dri-
ving them into the ground till they stood very firm, like piles,
the biggest end being out of the ground about five feet and a
half, and sharpened on the top; the two rows did not stand
above six inches from one another.
Then 1 took the pieces of cable which I had cut in the ship;
and laid them in rows upon one another, within the circle be-
tween these two rows of stakes, up to the top, placing other
stakes in the inside, leaning against them about two feet and
a half high, like a spur fo a post; and this fence was so strong,
(hat oeither.man nor beast could get into it, or over it. This
E2
cost me a great deal of time and labour, especially to cut the
piles in the woods, bring them to the place, and drive them
into the earth.
The entrance into this place I made to be, not by a door,
but by a short ladder, to go over the top, which ladder, when
I was in, I lifted over after me, and so I was completely fen-
ced in, and fortified, as I thought, from all the world, and
consequently slept secure in the night, which otherwise I
could not have done; though as it appeared afterwards, there
was no need of all this caution from the enemies I apprehen-
ded danger from.
Into this fence, or fortress, with infinite labour, I carried
all my riches, all my provisions, ammunition and stores; of
which you have the account above; and 1 made me a large
tent also, which, to preserve me from the rains, that in one
part of the year are very violent there, I made double, viz.
one smaller tent within, and one larger tent above it; and
covered the uppermost with a large tarpaulin, which I had
saved among the sails.
And now 1 lay no more for awhile in the bed which I had
brought on shore, but in a hammock, which was indeed a very
good one, and belonged to the mate of the ship.
Into this tent I brought all my provisions, and every thing
that would spoil by the wet; and havmg thus enclosed all my
goods, I made up the entrance. which till now I had left open,
and so passed and repassed, as 1 said, by a short ladder.
When 1 had done this, I began to work my way into the
rock, and bringing all the earth and stones that I dug down,
out through my tent. I laid them up within my fence in the na-
ture of a terrace, so that it raised the ground within about a
foot and a half. and thus 1 made me a cave just behind my
tent, which served me like a cellar to my house.
It cost me much labour, and many days, before all these
things were brought to perfection; and therefore I must go
back to some other things which took up some of my thoughts.
At the same time It happened, after 1 had laid my scheme
for the setting up my tent, and making the cave, that a storm
of rain falling frem a thick dark cloud, a sudden flash of light-
ning happened and after that, a great clap of thunder, as is
naturally the effect of it I was not so much surprised with the
lightning, as I was with the thought which darted into my
jnind as swift sui the lightning itself: O my powder! my very
.J.~ ..ny-wapr
heart sunk within me, when I thought that at one blast all my
powder might he destroyed; on which, not my defence only,
but the providing me food, as I thought, entirely depen-
ded; I was nothing near so anxious about my own danger;
though had the powder took fire, I had never known who had
hurt me.
Such impressions did this make upon me, that after the
storm was over, I laid aside all my works, my building and
fortifying, and applied myself to make bags and boxes to
separate my powder, and to keep it a little and a little in a
parcel, in hopes, that, whatever might come, it might not
all take fire at once, and to keep it so apart, that it should
not be possible to make one part fire another. I finish-
ed this work in about a fortnight, and I think my powder,
-which in all was about 1401b. weight was divided into no less
than a hundred parcels. As to the barrel that had been wet,
I did not apprehend any danger from that, so I placed it in
roy new cave, which in my far.cy I called my kitchen; and the
rest I hid up and down in holes among the rocks, so that no
-vet might come to it, marking very carefully where 1 laid it.
In the interval of time while this was doing, I went out at
least once every day with my gun, as well to divert myself,
as to see if I could kill any thing for food, and as near as I
could, to acquaint myself with what the island produced.
The first time 1 wen tout, I presently discovered that there were
goats in the island, which was a great satisfaction to me; but
then it was attended with this misfortune to me, viz. that
they were so shy, so subtle, and so swift of foot, that it was
the diflicultest thing in the world to eon.e at them; hut I was
not discouraged at this, not doubting but I might now and
then shoot one, as it soon happened; for after I had found
their haunts :i little, I laid wait in this manner fur them: I
observed, if they saw me in the valleys, though ihey were
ttpon the rocks,.they would run away as in a terrible fright; but
if ihey were feeding in the valleys, and I was upon the rocks,
they took no notice of me; from whence I concluded, that
by the position of their optics, their sight was so directed
downward, that they did not readily see objects that were
above them. So afterwards I took this method, I always
climbed the rocks first, to get above them, and then had
frequently a fair mark The first shot I made among these
creatures, I killed a she-goat which had a little kid by her',
which she gave suck to, which grieved me heartily; but when
the old one fell, the kid stood stock still by her till I came and
took her up; and not only so, but when I carried the old one
with me upon my shoulders, the kid followed me quite to my
enclosure; upon which I laid down the dam, and took the kid
in my arms, and earned it over my pale, in hopes to have
bred it up tame; but it would not eat; so I was forced to kill
it, and eat it myself These two supplied me with flesh a
great while; for I eat sparingly, and saved my provisions (my
bread especially) as much as possibly I could
Having now fixed my habitation, I found it absolutely ne-
cessary to provide a place to make a fire in, and fuel to burn;
and what I did for that, as also how I enlarged my cave, and
what conveniences I made, I shall give a full account of in its
place: but I must first give some little account of myself, and
of my thoughts about living, which it may well be supposed
were not a few
I had a dismal prospect of my condition; for as I was not
cast away upon that island without being driven, as is said, by
a violent storm quite out of the course of our intended voy-
age, and a great way, viz. some hundreds of leagues, out of
the ordinary course of the trade of mankind, I had great rea-
son to consider it as a determination of Heaven, that in this
desolate place, and m this desolate manner, I should end my
life. The tears would run plentifully down my face, when I
made these reflections; and sometimes I would expostulate
with myself, why Providence should thus completely rain its
creatures, and render them so absolutely miserable, so with-
out help abandoned, and so entirely depressed, that it could
hardly be rational to be thankful for such a life?
But something always returned swift upon me to check
these thoughts, and to reprove me; and particularly one day,
walking with my gun in my hand by the sea side, 1 was vci-yr
pensive upon the subject of my present condition, when rea-
son, as it were, put in, expostulating with me the other way,
thus: Well, you are in a desolate condition, it is true, hut
pray remember, where are the rest of you? Did not you come
eleven of you into the boat? where are the ten? why were
not they saved,' Snd you lost? why were you singled out? is it
better to be here or there? and then I pointed to the sea- All
evils are to be considered with the good that is in them, and
with what worse attended them-
Tiien it occurred to me again, how well I was furnished for
my subsistence, and what would have been my case, if it had
not happened, which was an hundred thousand to one that
the ship floated from the place where she first struck, and
was driven so near to the shore, that I had time to get all
these things out of her? What would have been my case, if I
had been to have lived in the condition in which I at first
came on shore, without necessaries of life, or any means to
supply and procure them? Particularly, said I aloud (though
to myself), what would I have done, without a gun, without
ammunition, without any tools to make any thing, or to work
with? without clothes, bedding, a tent, or any manner of co-
verings? And that now I had all these to a sufficient quantity,
and was in a fair way to provide myself in such a manner, as
to live without my gun when my ammunition was spent, so
that I had a tolerable view of subsisting without any want as
long as I lived; for I considered from the beginning how I
would provide for the accidents that might happen, and for
the time that was to come, even not only after my ammuni-
tion should be spent, but even after my health or strength
should decay.
I confess I had not then entertained any notion of my am-
munition being destroyed at one blast, I mean my powder
being blown up by lightning; and this made the thoughts of
it so surprising to me, when it lightened and thundered, as I
observed just now.
And now, being to enter into a melancholy relation of a
secne of silent life, such perhaps as was never heard of in the
world before, I shall take it from its beginning, and continue it
iu its order. It was, by my account, the 30th of September,
when, in the manner as abovesaid, I first set foot upon this
Iiorrid island, when the sun being, to us, in its autumnal equi-
nox, was almost just over my head; fori reckoned myself, by
observation, to be in the latitude of 9 degrees, 22 minutes
north of the line.
After I had been there about ten or twelve days, it came
into my thoughts, that I should lose my reckoning of time for
want of books, and pen and ink, and should even forget the
sabbath days from the working days: hut to prevent this, I
cut it with my knife upon a large post, in eapiul letters and,
making it into a great cross, I set it up on the shore, where I
first landed, m. I came on shore here the 30th of Sept. 1653.
Upon the sides of this square post I cut every day a notch
with my knife, and every seventh notch was as long again as
the rest, and every first day of the month as long again as
that long one; and thus 1 kept my calendar, or weekly,
monthly and yearly reckoning of time.
In the next place we are to observe, that among the many
things which 1 brought off the ship in the several voyages,
which, as above-mentioned, I made to it, I got several things
of less value, but not at all less useful to me, which I omitted
setting down before; as in particular, pens, ink, and paper,
several parcels m the captain's, mate's, gunner's, and car-
penter's keeping, three or four compasses, some mathemati-
cal instruments, dials. perspectives, charts, and hooks of na-
vigation, all which 1 huddled together, whether I might
want them or no. also I found three very good Bibles, which
came to me in my cargo from England, and which I had packed
up among my things, some Portuguese books also, and among
them two or three popish prayer-books, and several other books,
all which I carefully secured. And I must not forget that we'had
in the ship a dog and two cats, ot whose eminent history I may
have occasion to say something in its place; for I carried both
the cats with me; and as for the deg, he jumped out of the
ship of himself, and swam on shore to me the day after I went
on shore with my first cargo, and was a trusty servant to me
many years; 1 wanted nothing that he could fetch me, nor
any company that he could make up to me; I only wanted to
have him talk to me, but that he could not do. As I obser-
ved before, 1 found pen, ink, and paper, and 1 husbanded
them to the utmost; and I shall show, that while my ink las-
ted, 1 kept things very exact; but after that was gone, I
could not; for I could not make any ink, by any means that I
could devise.
And this put me in mind that 1 wanted many things, not-
withstanding all that 1 had amassed together; and of these,
this of ink was one, as also a spade, pick-axe, and shovel, to
dig or remove the earth; needles, pins, and thread; as for
linen, I soon learned to want that without much difficulty.
This want of tools made every work I did go on heavily,
and it was near a whole year before I had entirely finished
my little pale, or surrounded habitation: the piles, or stakes,
which were as heavy as 1 could well lift, were a long time in
cutting and preparing in the woods, and more by far ia
bringing home; so that I spent sometimes two days in cutting
and bringing home one of those posts, and a third day in dri-
ving it into the ground: fop which purpose I got a heavy
piece of wood at first, but at last bethought myself of one of
the iron crows, which, however, though 1 found it, yet made
driving those posts or piles very laborious and tedious work.
But what need 1 have been concerned at the tediousness of
any thing I had to do, seeing I had time enough to do it in?
Nor had I any other employment, if that had been over, at
least, that I could foresee, except the ranging the island to
seek for food, which 1 did more or less every day.
I now began to consider seriously my condition, and the cir-
cumstance I was reduced to, and I drew up the state of my
affairs in writing; not so much to leave them to any that
were to come after me, for I was like to have but few heirs,
as to deliver my thoughts from daily poring upon them, and
afflicting my mind; and as my reason began now to master
my despondency, 1 began to comfort myself as well as I
could, and to set the good against the evil, thatI might have
something to distinguish my case from worse; and I stated it
very impartially, like debtor and creditor, the comforts I en-
joyed, against the miseries I suffered, thus:
EVIL. GOOD.

I have no soul to speak to, But God wonderfully sent
or relieve me. the ship in near enough to the
shore, that I have gotten out
so many necessary things as
will either supply my wants,
or enable me to supply my-
self, even as long as I live.
Upon the whole here was an undaubted testimony, that
there was scarce any condition in the world so miserable, but
there was something negative, or something positive, to be
thankful for in it; and let this stand as a direction from the
experience of the most miserable of all conditions in this
world, that we may always find in it something to comfort
ourselves from, and to set, in the description of good ami
evil, on the credit side of the accompt.
Having now brought my mind a little to relisli my condi-
tion, and giving over looking out to sea, to see if I could spy a
ship; 1 say, giving over these things, I began to apply myself
to accommodate my way of living, and to make things as easy
to me as I could.
1 have already described my habitation, which was a tent
under the side of a rock, surrounded with a strong pale of
posts and cables, but I might now ralher call it a wall; for I
raised a kind of wall up against it of turfs, about two feet thick
on the outside; and after some time (I think it was a year and a
half) 1 raised rafters from it, leaning to the rock, and thatch-
ed or covered it with boughs of trees, and such things as I
could get to keep out the rain, which I found at some times
of the year very violent.
I have already observed how I brought all my goods into
fliis pale, and into the. cave which I had made behind me;
but I must observe too, that, at first, this was a confused heap
of goods, which, as they lay in no order, so they took up all
my place: I had no room to turn myself, so I set myself to
enlarge my cave, and worked farther into the earthi for it
was a loose sandy rock, which yielded easily to the labour i
bestowed on it: and so, when I found I was pretty safe as to
beasts of prey, I worked sideways to the right hand into the
rock; and, then turning to the right again, worked quite out,
and made me a door to come out on the outside of my pale or
fortification.
This gave me not only egress and regress, as it was a back
way to my tent, and to my store house, but gave me room to
stow my goods.
And now I began to apply myself to make such necessary
things as I found I most wanted, particularly a chair and a
table; for without these I was not able to enjoy the few com-
forts I had in the world; I could not write or eat, or several
things, with so much pleasure without a table.
So I went to work; and here I must needs observe, that as
reason is the substance and original of the mathematics, so
by stating and squaring every thing by reason, and by making
the most rational judgment of things, every man may be, in
time, master of every mechanic art. 1 had never handled a
tool in my life, and yet, in time, by labour, application, and
contrivance, I found, at last, that I wanted nothing but I could
have made it, especially if I had had tools; however, I made
abundance of things, even without tools, and some with no
more tools than an adz and a hatchet, which perhaps were
never made that way before, and that with infinite labour. For
example, if I wanted a board, I had no other way but to cut
down a tree, set it on an edge before me, and hew it flat on
either side with my ax, till I had brought it to be as thin as a
plank, and then dub it smoothe with my adz. It is true, by
this method I could make but one board out of a whole tree,
but this I had no remedy for, but patience, any more than I
had for the prodigious deal of time and labour which it took
me up to make a plank or board: but my time or labour was
little worth, and so it was as well employed one way as ano-
ther.
However, I made me a table and a chair, as I observed
above, in the first place, and this I did out of the short pieces
of boards that I brought on my raft from the ship; but when
I had wrought out some boards, as above, I made large
, shelves of the breadth of a foot and a half, one over another,
all along one side of my cave, to lay all my tools, nails, and
iron-work. and in a word, to separate every thing at large in
their places, that I might easily come at them: also.J knock-
F
ed pieces into the wall of the rock to hang my guns, and all
things that would hang up
So that had my cave been to be seen, it looked like a gene-
ral magazine of all necessary things; and I had every thing so
ready at my hand, that it was a great pleasure to me to see
all my goods in such order, and especially to find my stock of
all necessaries so great.
And now it was when I began to keep a journal of every
day's employment; for indeed at first I was in too much hur-
ry, and not only a hurry as to labour, but in too much dis-
composure of mind, and my journal would have been full of
many dull things. For example, 1 must have said thus: Sep-
tember the 30th, After I got to shore, and had escaped
drowning, instead of being thankful to God for my deliverance,
having first vomited with the great quantity of salt water
which was gotten into my stomach, and recovering myself a
little, I ran about the shore, wringing my hands and beating
my head and face, exclaiming at my misery, and crying out,
I was undone! undone! till, tired and faint, 1 was forced to lie
down on the ground to repose, but durst not sleep for fear
of being devoured
Some days after this, and after I had been on board the
ship, and had got all I could out of her, yet I could not for-
bear getting up to the top of a little mountain, and looking
out to sea, in hopes of seeing a ship, thenlfancy, at a vast dis-
tance, I spied a sail, please myself with the hopes of it, and
then, after looking steadily, till, I was almost blind, lose
it quite, and set down and weep like a child, and thus increase
my misery by my folly.
But having gotten over these things, in some measure, and
having settled my household-stuff and habitation, made me a
table and a chair, and all as handsome about me as I could, I
began, I say, to keep my journal, of which I shall here give
you the copy (though in it will be told all these particulars
over again), as long as it lasted; for at last having no more
ink, I was forced to leave it off.
THE JOURNAL.
September 30,1659, 1, poor miserable Robinson Cru-
soe, being shipwrecked during a dreadful storm in the offing,
came on shore on this dismal unfortunate island, which I cal-
led the Island of Despair; all the rest of the ship's company
being drowned, and mysell almost dead.
All the rest of the day 1 spent in afflicting myself at the
dismal circumstances I was brought to, viz. I had neither
food, house, clothes, weapon, or place to fly to, and in des-
pair of any relief, saw nothing but death before me, either
th..t I should be devoured by wild beasts, murdered by sava-
ges, or starved to death for want of food At the approach
of night, I slept in a tree, for fear of wild creatures; but slept
soundly, though it rained all night-
October 1 In the morning I saw, to my great surprise,
the ship had floated with the high tide, and was driven on
shore again much nearer the island, which, as it was some
comfort on one hand (for seeing her set upright, and not bro-
ken lo pieces, I hoped, if the wind abated, I might get on
board, and get some food and necessaries out of her for my
relief), so on the other hand, it renewed my grief at the loss
of my comrades, who, I imagined, if we had all staid on board,
might have saved the ship, or at least that they would not
have been all drowned, as they were; and that, had the men
been saved, we might perhaps have built us a boat out of the
ruins of the ship, to have carried us to some other part of the
world. I spent great part of this day in perplexing myself
on these things; but at length seeing the ship almost dry, I
went upon the sand as near as I could, and then swam on
board. This day also continued raining, though with no
wind at all.
From the 1st of October to the 24th. All these days en-
tirely spent in making several voyages to get all I could out
of the ship, which I brought on shore every tide of flood upon
rafts. Much rain also in these days, though with some inter-
vals of fair weather; but, it seems, this was the rainy season.
October 24 I overset my raft, and all the goods I had
got upon it; but being in shoal water, and the things being
chiefly heavy, I recovered many of them when the tide was
out.
October 25. It rained all night, and all day, with some gusts
of wind, during which time the ship broke in pieces, the wind
blowing a little harder than before, and was no more to be
seen, except the wreck of her, and that only at low water. I
spent this day in covering and securing the goods which I sa-
ved, that the rain might not spoil them.
October 2G. I walked about the shore almost all clay to
find out a place to fix my habitation, greatly concerned to
secure myself from any attack, in the night, either from wild
beasts or men. Towards night I fixed upon a proper place
under a rock, and marked out a semicircle for my encamp-
ment, which I resolved to strengthen with a work, wall, or
fortification, made of double piles, lined within with cable,
and without with turf.
From the 26th to the 30th, I worked very hard in carrying
all my goods to my new habitation, though some part of the
time it rained exceeding hard.
The 31st, in the morning, I went out into the island with
my gun, to see for some food, and discover the country;
-when I killed a she-goat, and her kid followed me home,
-which I afterwards killed also, because it would not feed.
November 1. I set up my tent under a rock, and lay
there for the first night, making it as large as I could, with
stakes driven in to swing my hammock upon
November 2. I set up all my chests and boards, and the
pieces of timber which made my rafts. and with them formed
a fence round me, a little within the place I had marked out
for my fortification.
November 3. I went out with my gun, and killed two
fowls like ducks, which were very good food. In the after-
noon went to work to make me a table
November 4. This morning I began to order my times of
work, of going out with my gun, time of sleep, and time of
diversion; viz. every morning I walked out with my gun, for
two or three hours, if it did not rain; then employed myself
to work till about eleven o'clock; then eat what I had to live
nn; and, from twelve to two; I lay down to sleep, the weather
being excessive hot, and then in the evening to work again.
The working part of this day and the next were wholly em-
ployed in making my table, for I was yet but a very sorry
workman, though time and necessity made me a complete
natural mechanic soon after, as I believe it would do any one
else.
November 5. This day I went abroad with my gun and
my dog, and killed a wild cat; her skin pretty soft, but her
flesh good for nothing. Every creature I killed, I took off the
skins and preserved them. Coming back, by the sea shore, I
saw many sorts of sea-fowls which I did not understand; hut
was surprised, and almost frighted, with two or three seals,
which, while I was gazing at, not well knowing what they
were, got into the sea, and escaped me for that time.
November 6. After my morning walk, 1 went to work with
my table again, and finished it, though not to my liking; nor
was it long before 1 learned to mend it.
November 7. Now it began to be settled fair weather.
The 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, and part of the 12th (for the Uth
was Sunday, according to my reckoning), I took wholly up
to make me a ehair, and with much ado, brought it to a to-
lerable shape, but never to please me; and even in the mak-
ing I pulled it to pieces several times Note, I soon neglec-
ted keeping my Sundays; for, omitting my mark for them on
my post, I forgot which was which.
November IS. This day it rained, which refreshed me ex-
ceedingly, and cooled the earth; but it was accompanied with
terrible thunder and lightning, which frighted me dreadfully,
for fear of my powder. As soon as it was over, I resolved
to separate my stock of powder into as many little parcels as
possible, that it might not be in danger
November 14, 15, 16. These three days I spent in mak-,
ing little square chests or boxes, which might hold about a
pound, or two pounds at most, of powder; and so putting the
powder in, I stowed it in places as secure and remote from
one another as possible- On one of these three days I killed
a large bird that was good to eat, but I knew not what to call
it.
November 17. This day I began to dig behind my tent into
the rock, to make room for my farther conveniency. Note,
Three things I wanted exceedingly for this work; viz. a pick
axe, a shovel, and a wheelbarrow or basket: so I desisted
from my work, and began to consider how to supply that
want, and make me some tools. As for the pick-axe, I made
use of the iron crows, which were proper enough, though
heavy, but the next thing was a shovel or spade; this was so
absolutely necessary, that indeed I could do nothing effectual-
ly without it; but what kind of one to make, I knew not.
November 18. The next day, in searching the woods, I
found a tree of that wood, or like it, which in the lirasils,
they call the iron-tree, for its exceeding hardness: of this,
with great labour, and almost spoiling my axe, I cut a piece,
F2
/
and brought it home too with difficult; enough, for it was ex-
ceeding heavy.
The excessive hardness of the wood, and having no other
way, made me a long while upon this machine; for I worked
it effectually, by little and little, into the form of a shovel or
apade, the handle exactly shaped like ours in England, only that
the broad part having no iron shod upon it at bottom, it would
not last me so long: however, it served well enough for the
uses which I had occasion to put it to; but never was a sho-
vel, I believe made after that fashion, or so long a making.
I was still deficient, for I wanted a basket, or a wheelbar-
row: a basket I could not make by any means, having no
such things as twigs that would bend to make wicker-ware,
or at least none yet found out; and, as to the wheelbarrow, I
fancied I could make all but the wheel; but that I had no no-
tion of, neither did I know how to go about it: besides I had
no possible way to make iron gudgeons, for the spindle or
axis of the wheel to run in, so I gave it over; and so, for car-
rying away the earth which I dug out of the cave, I made me
a thing like a hod which the labourers carry mortar in, when
they serve the bricklayers.
This was not so difficult to me as the making the shovel;
and yet this, and the shovel, and the attempt which I made in
vain to make a wheelbarrow, took me no less than four days:
I mean, always excepting my morning walk with my gun,
which I seldom failed, and very seldom failed also of bringing
home something fit to eat.
November 23. My other work having stood still, because
of my making these tools, when they were fmished I went
on; and working every day as my strength and time allowed,
1 spent eighteen days entirely in widening and deepening my
cave, that it might hold my goods commodiously.
Note. During all this time, I worked to make this room,
or cave, spacious enough to accommodate me as a warehouse
or magazine, a kitchen, a dining room, and a cellar; as for a
lodging, I kept to the tent, except that sometimes in the wet
season of the year it rained so hard, that I could not keep
myself dry; which caused me afterwards to coverall my place
-within my pale, with long poles, in the form of rafters, lean-
ing against the rock, and load them with flags, and large leaves
of trees, like a thatch.
December 10. I began now to think my cave or vault
finished, when, on a sudden (it seems Ihad made it too large),
a great quantity of earth fell down from the top and on one
side, so much that, in short, it frighted me, and not without
reason too; for if I had been under it, I bad never wanted a
grave-digger. Upon this disaster, I had a great deal of work
to do over again; for I had the loose earth to carry out, and,
which was of more importance, I had the ceiling to prop up,
so that I might be sure no more would come down.
December ll. This day I went to work with it according-
ly, and got two shores, or posts, pitched upright to the top
with two pieces of boards across over each post. This I
finished the next day;. and setting more posts up with boards,
in about a week more I had the roof secured; and the posts,
standing in rows, served-me for partitions to part off my
house.
December 17. From this day to the 20th, I placed shelves,
and knocked up nails on the posts, to hang every thing up
that could be hung up; and now I began to be in some order
within doors.
December 20. Now I carried every thing into the cave,
and began to furnish my house, and set up some pieces of
boards, like a dresser, to order my victuals upon; but boards
began to be very scarce with me. Also I made me another
table.
December 24. Much rain all night and all day; no stirring
out.
December 25. Rain all day.
December 26. No rain, and the earth much cooler than
before, and pleasanter.
December. 27. Killed a young goat, and lamed another, so
that I catched it, and led it home in a string; when 1 had it
home I bound and splintered up its leg, which was broke.
N. B. I took such care of it, that it lived, and the leg grew
well, and as strong as ever; but by nursing it so long it
grew tame, and fed upon the little green at my door, and
would not go away. 1'his was the first time that I enter-
tained a thought of breeding up some tame creatures, that I
might have food when my powder and shot was all spent-
December 2S, 29, 30. Great heats and no breeze; so that
there was no stirring abroad, except in the evening for food.
This time I spent in putting all my things in order within
doors.
January 1. Very hot still; but I went abroad, early and
late, with my gun, and lay still in the middle of the day.
This evening, going farther into the valleys, which lay to the
centre of the island, I found there was plenty of goats, though
exceeding shy, and hard to come at; however, I resolved to
try if I could not bring my dog to hunt them down.
January 2. Accordingly, the next day, I went out with
my dog and set him upon the goats; but I was mistaken, for
they all faced about upon the dog, and he knew his danger top
well, for he would not come near them.
January 3. I began my fence or wall, which, being still
jealous of my being attacked by somebody, I resolved to make
very thick and strong
[N. B. This wall being described before, I purposely omit
what was said in the journal; ii is sufficient to observe, that I
was no less time than from the 3d of January to the 14th of
April, workiug, finishing, and perfecting this wall, though it
it was no more than about twenty-four yards in length, being
a half circle, from one place in the roek, to another place
about eighty yards from it, the door of the cave being in the
centre behind it.]
All this time I worked very hard, the rains hindering me
many ctoys, nay, sometimes weeks, together; but 1 thought I
should never be perfectly secure till this wall was finished:
and it is scarce credible what inexpressible labour every thing
was done with, especially the bringing piles out of the woods,
and driving them into the ground; for 1 made them much
bigger than I needed to have done.
W hen this wall was finished, and the outside double fenced,
villi a turf wall raised up close to it, 1 persuaded myself, that
if »n people were to come on shore there, they would not
perceive any thing like a habitation: and it was very well I
did so, as may be observed hereafter, upon a very remarkable
occasion.
During this time, I made my rounds in the woods for game
every day, when the rain admitted me, and made frequent
discoveries in these walks of something or other to my advan-
tage; particularly I found a kind of wild pigeons, which
build not as wood pigeons in a tree, but rather as house-pi-
geons, iu the holes of the rocks; and taking some young
ones, I endeavoured to breed them up tame, and did so; but
when they grew older, they flew all away, which perhaps
was at first for want of feeding them, for I had nothing to
give them: however, I frequently found their nests, and got
their young ones, which were very good meat.
And now, in the managing my household affairs, I found
myself wanting in many things, which I thought at first it was
impossible for me to make, as indeed as to some of them it
was: for instance, I could never make a cask to be hooped.
I had a>small runlet or two, as I observed before, but I could
never arrive to the capacity of making one by them, though
I spent many weeks about it; I could neither put in the heads,
or join the staves so true to one another, as to make them
hold water; so I gave that also over.
In the next place, I was at a great loss for candles; so that
as soon as it was dark, which was generally by seven o'clock,
I was obliged to go to bed. I remembered the lump of bees-
wax, with which I made candles in my African adventure;
but I had none of that now: the only remedy I had, was, that
when I had killed a goat, I saved the tallow, and with a little
dish made of clay, which 1 baked in the sun, to which I added
a wick of some oakum, I made me a lamp: and this gave me
light, though not a clear stead; light, like a candle. In the
middle of all my labours it happened that, rummaging my
things, I found a little bag, which, as I hinted before, had
been filled with corn, for the feeding of poultry, not for this
voy age, but before, as I suppose, when the ship came from
Lisbon: what little remainder of corn had been in the bag,
was all devoured by the rats, and I saw nothing in the bag but
husks and dust; and being willing to have the bag for some
other use (I think it was to put powder in, when I divi-
ded it for fear of the lightning, or some such use), I shook the
husks of corn out of it, oo one side of my fortification, under
the rnck.
It was a little before the great rains, just now mentioned,
that i threw this stuff away, taking no notice of any thing,
and not so much as remembering that I had thrown any thing
there; when, about a month after, or thereabouts, I saw
aome few stalks of something green shooting up on the ground,
which I fancied might he some plant I had not seen, but 1 was
aorpiised, and perfectly astonished, when, after a little lon-
ger time, I saw about ten or twelve ears come out, which
-were perfect green barley, of the same kind as our European,
nay, as our English barley. . .
It is impossible to express the astonishment and contusion
of my thoughts on this occasion. I had hitherto acted upon no
religious foundation at all; indeed I had very few notions of
religion in my head, nor had entertained any sense of any
thmg that had befallen me. otherwise than as a chance, or as
,e lightly say, what pleases God: without so much as mquir-
ing into the end of Providence in these thmgs. or his order m
governing events in the world: but after I saw barley grow
{here. in a climate which I knew was not proper for corn,
and especially that I knew not how it came there, it startled
me strangely, and I began to suggest, that God had miracu-
louslv caused this grain to grow, without any help of seed
sown, and that it was so directed purely for my suste-
nance in that wild miserable place
This touched my heartalittle, and brought tears out of my
eyes, and I began to bless myself, that such a prodigy of na-
ture should happen upon my account; and this was the more
stra..ge to me, because I saw near it still, all along by the s,de
of the rock, some other st- aggling stalks, which proved to be
stalks of rice, and which I knew, because I had seen it grow
in Africa, when I was ashore there.
I »ot only thought these the pure productions of Provi-
dence for my support; but not doubting but that there was
more in the place, I went all over that part of the island
where I had been before, peering in every corner, and under
every rock, to see for more of it, but I could not find any. at
last it occurred to my thoughts, that I had shaken the bag ot
chicken's meat out in that place, and then the wonder began.
to cease: and I must confess, my religious thankfulness to
God's providence began to abate too, upon the discovermg
that all this was nothing but what was common, though I
ought to have been as thankful for so strange and unforeseen
Providence, as if it had been miraculous; for it was really the
work of Providence as to me, that should order or appomt,
that ten or twelve grains of corn should remain unspoiled
(when the rats had destroyed all the rest), as if it had been
dropped from Heaven: as also that I should throw it out in
th»t particular place, where. it being in the shade of a high
rock, it sprang up immediately, whereas, if I had thrown it any
where else, at that time, it had been burnt up and destroyed.
I carefully saved the ears of this corn, you may be sure, in
their season, which was about the end of June; and laying up
every corn, I resolved to sow them all again, hoping in time.
to have some nuantity sufficient to supply me with bread;
but it was not till the fourth year that I would allow mvself.
the least grain of this corn to eat, and even then but sparing-
ly, as I shall say afterwards in its order; for I lost all lhat I
sowed the first season, by not observing the proper time, for
I sowed it just before the dry season, so that it never came
tip at all, at least, not as it would have done: of which, in its
place.
Besides this barley, there were, as above, twenty or thirty
stalks of rice, which I preserved with the same care, and
whose use was of the same kind, or to the same purpose,
viz. to make me bread, or rather food; for I found ways to
cook it up without baking, though I did that also, after some
time. But to return to my journal.
I worked excessive hard these three or four months, to
get my wall done; and the 14th of April, I closed it up, con-
triving to go into it, not by a door, but over the wall, by a
ladder, that there might be no sign on the outside of my ha-
bitation.
April 16 I finished the ladder, so I went up with the lad-
der to the top, and then pulled it up after me, and let it down
on the inside. This was a complete enclosure to me; for
within I had room enough, and nothing could come at me
from without, unless it could first mount my wall. ' >
The very next day after this wall was finished, I had al-
most had all my labour overthrown at once, and myself kil-
led. The case was thus: as I was busy in the inside of it,
behind my tent, just in the entrance into my cave, I was ter-
ribly frighted with a most dreadful surprising thing indeed;
for, all on a sudden. I found the earth came tumbling down
from the roof of my cave, and from the edge of the hill, over
my head, and two of the posts I had set up in the cave,
cracked in a frightful manner. I was heartily scared, but
thought nothing of what really was the cause; only thinking
that the top of my cave was falling in, as some of it had done
before, and, for fear t should be buried in it, 1 ran forwards
to my ladder: and, not thinking myself safe there neither, t
got over my wall. for fear of the pieces of the hill, which I
expected might roll down upon me. I was no sooner stepped
down upon the firm ground, but I plainly saw it was a terri-
ble earthquake; for the ground I stood on shook three times,
at about eight minutes distance, with three such shocks as
would have overturned the strongest building that could be
supposed to have stood upon the earth; and a great piece
of the top of a rock, which stood about half a mile from me
next the sea, fell down with such a terrible noise, as I never
heard in all my life. I perceived also the very sea was
put into a violent motion by it; and, I believe the shocks were
stronger under the water than on the island.
I was so amazed with the thing itself, having never felt the
like, or discoursed with any one that had, that I was like one
dead or stupified; and the motion of the earth made my
stomach sick, like one that was tossed at sea; but the noise of
the falling of the rock awaked me, as it were, and rousing
jne from the stupified condition I was in, filled me with hor-
ror; and I thought of nothing then but the hill falling upon
my tent, and all my household goods, and burying all at
once; and this sunk my very soul within me a second time.
After the third shock was over, and f felt no more for
some time, I began to take courage, and yet I had not heart
enough to get over my wall again, for fear of being buried
alive; but still sat upon the ground greatly cast down, and
disconsolate, not knowing what to do. All this while, I had
not the least serious religious thought, nothing but the com-
mon 'Lord, have mercy upon rne.1' and when it was over,
that went away too
While I sat thus, I found the air overcast, and it grew
cloudy, as if it would rain; and, in less than half an hour, it
blew a most dreadful hurricane of wind. The sea was all on.
a sudden covered with foam and froth, the shore was cover-
ed with the breach of the water, the trees were torn up by
the roots, and a terrible storm it was; and this held about
three hours, and then began to abate; and then in two hours
more it was calm, and began to rain very hard.
All this while, I sat upon the ground, very much terrified
and dejected; when, on a sudden, it came into my thoughts,
that these winds and rain, being the consequence of the earth-
quake, the earthquake itself was spent and over, and 1 might
venture into my cave again. With this thought my spirits began
to revive, and the rain helping also to persuade me, I went
in, and sat me down in my tent; hut the rain was so violent,
that my tent was ready to be beaten down with it, and I was
forced to go into my cave, though very much atraid and unea-
sy, for fear it should fall on my head.
This violent rain forced me to a new work, viz. toeut a
hole through my new fortification, like a sink, to let the wa-
ter go out, which would else have drowned my cave. After
1 had been in my cave some time, and found still no more
shocks of the earthquake follow, I began to be more com-
nosed; and now, to support my spirits, which mdeed wanted
it very much. I went to my little store, and took a small sup
of rum, which, however, I did then, and always very sparmg.
lv, knowing I conld have no more when that was gone.
It continued raining all that night, and great part of the
next day, so that t could not stir abroad; but, myf mmd bemg
more composed, I began to think of what 1 bad best do; con.
eludmg that if the island was subject to these earthquakes,
there would be no living for me in a cave, but 1 must consider
of building me some little hut, in an open place, which I
might surround with a wall, as I had done here, and so make
myself secure from wild beasts or men; but concluded, ill
staid where I was, 1 should certainly, one time or other, be
buried alive. ,
With these thoughts. I resolved to move my tent trom the
place where it stood, which was just under the hanging pre-
cipice of the hill, and which, if it should be shaken again,
would certainly fall upon my tent. And I spent the two next
days. being the 19th and 20th of April, in contriving where
and how to remove my habitation.
The fear of being swallowed up alive, made me that I ne-
ver slept in quiet; and yet the apprehension of lying abroad,
withoufan, fence, was almost equal to it: but still, when I
looked about, and saw how every thmg was put ,n order how
pleasantly concealed I was, and how safe from danger, it made
me very loath to remove. •
In-the mean time it occurred to me, that it would require
a vast deal of time for me to do this, and thai I must be con-
tented to run the venture where 1 was, till t had formed a
camp for myself, and had secured it so as to remove to it. So,
-with this resolution, I composed myself for a time, and re-
solved that I would go to work, with all speed, to build me a
wall, with piles and cables, &c in a circle, as before, ami set
my tent up in it, when it was finished! but that I would Ten-
ture to stay where I was, till it was finished, and fit to remove
to. This was the 21st I
April 22. The next morning I hegan to consider of means
to put this resolve in execution; but I was at a great loss about
my tools. I had three large axes, and abundance of hatchets^
(for we carried the hatchets for traffic with the Indians); but,
-with much chopping and cutting knotty hard wood, they
were all full of notches, and dull; and though I had a grind-
stone, I could not turn it, and grind my tools too. This cost
me as much thought as a statesman would have bestowed
upon a grand point of politics, or a judge upon the life and
death of a man. At length, I contrived a wheel, with a
string, to turn it with my foot, that I might have both my
hands at liberty. Note. I had not seen any such thing in
England, or at Least not to take notice how it was done, though
since I have observed it is very common there; besides that,
my grindstone was very large and heavy. This machine cost
me a full week's work, to bring it to perfection.
Aprl 28, 29. These two whole days I took up in grinding
my tools; my machine for turning my grindstone performing
very well.
April.SO. Having perceived my bread had been low a
great while, I now took a survey of it, and reduced myself to
one biscuit-cuke a day, which made my heart very heavy.
May 1 In the morning, looking towards the sea-side, the
tide being low, I saw something lie on the shore, bigger than
ordinary, and it looked like a cask; when I came to it, I
found a small barrel, and two or three pieces of the wreck of
the ship, which were driven on shove hy the late hurricane;
and, looking towards the wreck itself, I thought it seemed to
lie higher out of the water than it used to do I examined
the barrel which was driven on shore, and soon found it was
a barrel- of gunpowder, but it had taken-water, and the pow-
der was caked as hard as a stone; however, I rolled it farther
on s'iore for the present, and went on upon the sands a's near
as I could to the wreck of the ship to look for more.
When I came down to the ship, I found it strangely remo-
ved; the forecastle, which lay before buried in the sand, was
heaved up at least six feet; and the stern, which was broken
to pieces, and parted from the re&J by the foice of the sea,
soon alter I had left rummaging of her, was tossed, as it were,
np, and cast on one side; and the sand was thrown so high
on that side next the stern, that whereas there was a great
place of water before,. so that I could not come within a
quarter of a mile of the wreck without swimming, I could now
walk quite up to her when the tide was out. I was surprised
wilh this at first, but soon concluded that it must be done by
the earthquake; and as by this violence the ship-was more
broken open than formerly, so many things came daily on
shore, which the sea had loosened, and which the winds and
water rolled by degrees to the land.
This wholly diverted my thoughts from the design of re*-
moving my habitation; and I busied myself mightily, that day
especially, in searching whether I could make any way into'
into the ship; but I found nothing was to be expected of that
kind, for that all the inside of the ship was choaked up with
sand. However, as I had learnt not to despair of any thing,
I resolved to pull every thing to pieces that I could of the ship,
concluding that every thing I could get from her would be of
some use or other to me.
May 3. I began with my saw, and cut a piece of a beam
through, which -I thought held some of the upper part, or
quarter deck, - together; and when I had cut it through, I
cleared away the sand as well as I could, from the side which
lay highest; but the tide coming in, I was obliged to give over
for that time.
May 4 I went a fishing, but caught not one fish that I
durst eat of. till 1 was weary of my sport, when, just going to
leave off, I caught.a young dolphin. I had made me a long
line of some rope yarn, but I had no hooks; yet I frequently
caught fish enough, as much as I cared to eat; all which I
dried in the sun, and eat them dry.
May 5. Worked on the wreck, cut another beam asunder,
and brought three great fir-planks off from the decks, which
I tied together, and made swjm on shore, when the tide
of flood came on
May 6. Worked on the wreck, got several iron bolts out
of her, and other pieces of iron work: worked very hard, and
came home very much tired, and had thoughts of giving it
over.
May 7. Went to the wreck again, but with an intent not
to work; but found the weight of the wreckhad broken it-
self down, the beams being cut, that several pieces of the
ship seemed to lie loose, and the inside of the hold lay so
open, that I could see into it, but almost full of water and
sand.
May 8. Went to the wreck, and carried an iron crow to
wrench up the deck, which lay now quite clear of the water
or sand. I wrenched open two planks, and brought them on
shore also with the tide. I left the iron crow in the wreck
for next day.
May 9. Went to the wreck, and, with the crow, made
way into the body of the wreck, and felt several casks, and
loosened them with the crow; but could not break them up.
I felt also the roll of English lead, and could stir it; but it was
too heavy to move.
May 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. Went every dav to the wreck,
and got a great deal of pieces of timber, and boards, or planks,
and two or three hundred weight of iron.
May 15. I carried two hatchets, to try if I could not cut a
piece off the roll of lead, by placing the edge of one hatchet,
and driving it with the other; but as it lay about a foot and
a half in the water, 1 could not make any blow to drive the
hatchet.
May 16 It had Mowed hard in the night, and the wreck
appeared more broken by the force of the water: but I staid so
long in the woods, to gel pigeons for food, that the tide pre-
vented me going to the wreck that day. ,
May 17. I saw some pieces of the wreck blown on shore.
at a great distance, two miles off me: but resolved to see
what they » ere. and found it was a pieoe of the head; but
too heavy for me to bring away.
May 24. Every dav, to this day I worked on the wreck,
and, »iih hard labour, I loosened some things so much
.with the crow, that, the first Honing tide, several casks float-
ed out, and two of the seamen's chests; but the wind blowing
from the shore, nothing came to land that day, but pieces of
timber and a hogshead which had some Brasil pork in it;
hut the salt water and the sand had spoiled it.
I continued this work every day to the 15th of June, ex-
cept the time necessary to get food, which I always appointed
during this part of my employment, to be when the tide was
up. that I might be ready when it was ebbed out; and by 'his
time. I duo gotten timber and plank, and iron-work enough
(o have built a good boat, if I had known how; and also I got
at several times, and in several pieces, near one hundred
weight of the sheet-lead.
June 16. Going (iu-wu to the sea-side, 1 found a large tortoise
or turtle; this was the first I had seen, and which, it seems,
was only my misfortune, not any defect of the place, or scar-
city; for, had I happened to be on the other side of the
islandi I might have had hundreds of them.. every day, as I
found afterwards; but, perhaps, had paid dear enough for ihem.
June 17. I spent in cooking the turtle. I found in her
threescore eggs; and her flesh was to me at that time the
most savoury and pleasant that ever I tasted in my life, hav-
ing had no flesh but of goats and fowls, since I landed in this
horrible place.
June 18. Rained all the day,.and I staid within. I thought,
at this time, the rain felt cold, and I was something chilly,
which I knew was not usual in that latitude.
. June 19. Very ill, and shivering, as if the weather had
been cold. ;-...-.
June 20 No rest all night, violent pains in my head, and
feverish.
June 21. Very ill, frighted almost to death with the ap-
prehensions of my sad condition, to he sick, and no help.
Prayed to God,.for the first time since the storm off Hull;
but scarce knew what 1 said; or why: my thoughts being all
confused.
June 22. A little better; but under dreadful apprehen-
sions of sickness
June 23. Very bad again, cold and shivering, and then a
violent head-ach.
June 24. Much better.
June 25. An ague very violent; the fit held me seven
hours, cold fit and hot, with faint sweats after it.
June 26. Better; and having no victuals to eat, took my
gun, but found myself very weak: however, I killed a she-
goat, and with much difficulty, got it home, and broiled some
of it, and eat: I would fain have stewed it, and made some
broth, but had no pot.
June 27. The ague again so violent, that I lay abed all
day, and neither eat nor drank. I was ready to perish for
thirst, but so weak, I had not strength to stand up, or to get
myself any water to drink: prayed to God again, but was
light-headed; and when I was not, I was so ignorant, that I
G2
knew not what to say; only 1 lay, and cried, ' Lord, look
upon me! Lord pity me! Lord have mercy upon me! I sup-
pose I did nothing else for two or three hours, till the At
wearing off, I fell asleep, and did not awake till far in the
night. When I awaked, 1 found myself much refreshed, but
weak, and exceedingly thirsty; however, as I had no water in
my whole habitation', I was forced to lie mill morning. and
went to sleep again. In this second sleep, I had this terrible
dream:
I thought that I was sitting on the ground, on the outside
of my «all, where I sat when the storm blew after the earth-
quake, and that I saw a man descend from a great black
cloud, in a bright flame of fire, and light upon the ground.
He was all over as bright as a Same, so that I could but just
bear to look towards him: his countenance was most inex-
pressibly dreadful, impossible for words to describe-: when he
Stepped upon the ground with his feet, I thought the earth
trembled, just as it had done before in the earthquake: and
all the ait looked, to my apprehension, as if it had been filled
with flashes of fire.
He was no sooner landed upon the earth; but he moved
forward towards me, with a long spear or weapon in his hand,
to kill me; and when he came to a rising ground, at some
distance, he spoke to me, or I heard a voice so terrible, that
it is impossible to express the terror of it; all that I can say
I understood was this, ' Seeing all these things have not
-brought thee to repentance, now shalt thou die.' At which
fords, I thought he lifted up the spear that was in his hand,
to kill me.
No one that shall ever read this account, will expect that
I should be able to describe the horrors of my soul at this
terrible vision; I mean, that even while it was a dream. I
even dreamed of those horrors: nor is it any more possible
to describe the impression that remained upon my mind,
when 1 awaked, and found it was but a dream.
I had, alas! no divine knowledge- what I had received by
the good instruction of my father, was then worn out by an
uninterrupted series, for eight years, of seafaring wickedness,
and a constant conversation with none but such as were like my-
self, wicked and profane to the last degree. Ido not remember,
that I hart, m all ihat time, one thought that so much as
tended either to looking upwards toward God, or inwards tt><-
wards a reflection upon my own ways; but a certain stupidity
of soul, without desire of good, or conscience of evil, had en-
tire! -- overwhelmed me, and I was all that the most hardened,
un.limiting, wicked creature among our common sailors can
be supposed to be, not havmg the least sense either of the
fear of God in dangers^ or of thankfulness to God in delive-
rances
In the relatmg what is already past of my story, this will be
the more easily believed, when I shall add, that, through all
the variety of miseries that had to this day befallen me, X
never bad so much as one thought of its being the hand of
God, or that it was a just punishment for my sin, my rebel-
lious behaviour against my father; or my present sins, which.
were great; or so much as a punishment for the general
course of my wicked life. When I was on the desperate ex-
pedition, on the desert shores of \frica, I never had so much
as one thought of what would become of me, or one wish to
God to direct me whither I should go, or to keep me from dan-
ger, which apparently surrounded me, as well from voracious
creatures as cruel savages: but I was merely thoughtless of
God or a Providences I acted like a mere brute from the
principles of nature, and by the dictates of common sense
only, and indeed hardly that.
When I was delivered and taken up at sea by the Portugal
eaptain. well used, and dealt justly and honourably with, as
well as charitably, I had not the least thankfulness in my
thoughts: when again 1 was shipwrecked, ruined, and in dan-
ger of drowning on this island, I was as far from remorse, or
looking on il as a judgment; I only said to myself often, that
I was an unfortunate dog, and horn to be always miserable.
It is true, when I got on shore first here, and found all my
ship's crew drowned, and myself spared, I was surprised with
ft kind of extacy and some transports of soul, which, had the
grace of God assisted, might have come up to true thank-
fulness: but it ended where it began, in a mere common
flight of joy, or, as I may say, being glad I was alive, without
the least reflection upon the distinguishmg goodness of the
hand which had preserved me, and had singled me out to be
preserved, when all the rest were destroyed; or an inquiry
why Providence had been thus merciful to me; even just the
same common sort of joy which seamen generally have, af-
ter they have got safe ashore from a shipwreck, which they
drown ajl in the next bowl of punch, and forget almost m
soon as it is over; and all the rest of my life was like it..
Even when I was afterwards, on due consideration, made
sensible of my condition, how I was cast on this dreadful
place, out of the reach of human kind, out of all hope of re-
lief, or prospect of redemption, as soon as I saw n proba-
bility of living, and that I should not starve and perish for hun-
ger, all the sense of my affliction wore off, and I began to
be very easy, applied myself to the works proper for my
preservation and supply, and was far enough from being af-
flicted at my condition, as a judgment from Heaven, or as
the hand of God against me: these were thoughts which very
seldom entered into my head.
The growing up of the corn, as is hinted in my journal, had
at first some little influence upon me, and began to affect me
with seriousness, as long as I thought it had something mira-
culous in it; but as soon as ever that part of the thought was
removed, all the impression which was raised from it wore
oft- also, as I have noticed already.
Even the earthquake, though nothing could be more ter-
rible in its nature, or more immediately directing to the in-
visible l'ower which alone directs such things, yet no sooner
was the first fright over, but the impression it had madu
went off also. I had no more sense of God, or his judgments,
much less of the present affliction of my circumstances being
from his hand, than if I had been in the most prosperous con.
dition of life.
But now -when I began to be sick, and a leisurely view of
the miseries of death came to place itself before me;
when my spirits began to sink under the burden of a strong
distemper, and nature was exhausted with the violence of
the fever; conscience, that had slept so long, began to awake,
and I began to reproach myself with my past life, in which I
had so evidently, by uncommon wickedness, provoked the
justice of God to lay me under uncommon strokes, and to
deal with me in so vindictive a manner.
These reflections oppressed me from the second or third
day of my distemper, and in the violence, as well of the fever
as of the dreadful reproaches of my conscience, extorted
some words from me, like praying to God, though I cannot
say they were either a prayer attended with desires, or with
hopes; it was rather the voice of mere fright and distress:
my thoughts were contused, the convictions great upon my
mind, and the horror of dying in such a miserable condition,
raised vapours into my head, with the mere apprehensions;
and in these hurries of my soul, I knew not what my tongue
might express: but it was rather exclamation, such as,
* Lord! what a miserable creature am I' If I should be sick,
I shall certainly die for want of help, and what will be-
come of meH Then the tears burst out of my eyes, and I could
say no more for a good while.
In this interval, the good advice of my father came to my
mind, and presently his prediction. which I mentioned at the
beginning of this story: viz. That, if I did lake this foolish
step, God would not bless me, and I would have leisure here-
after to reflect upon having neglected his counsel, when.
there might be none to assist me in my recovery. ' Now,'
said I, aloud, ' my dear father's words are come to pass:
God's justice has overtaken me, and I have none to help or
hear me. 1 rejected the voice of Providence, which had
mercifully put me in a posture or station of life wherein I
might have been happy and easy; but 1 would neither see it
myself, uor learn to know the blessing of it from my parents:
I left them to mourn over my folly, and now I am left to
mourn under the consequences of it. I refused their help
and assistance, who would have lifted me into the world, and
would have made every thing easy to me: and now I have
difficulties to struggle with, too great for even nature itself to
support, and no assistance, no help, no comfort, no advice-
Then I cried out, ' Lord, be my help, for 1 am in great dis-
tress!'
This was the first prayer, if I might call it so, that I had
made for many years. Ilut I return to my journal.
June 28. Having been somewhat refreshed with the sleep
I had had, and the fit being entirely off, 1 got upi and though
the fright and terror of my dream was very great, yet 1 con-
sidered, that the fit of the ague would return again the next
day, and now was my time to get something to refresh and
support myself when 1 should be ill; and the first thing I
did, I filled a large square case bottle with water, and set it
upon my table, m reach of my bed: and, to take off the chill
or aguish disposition of the water, I put about a quarter of a
pint of rum into it, and mixed them together; then I got me
a piece of the goat's flesh, and broiled it on the coals, but
could eat very little; I walked about, but was very weak,
and withal, very sad and heavy-hearted in the sense of my
miserable condition, dreading. the return of my distemper
the next day; at night I made my supper of three of the tur-
tle's eggs, which I roasted in the ashes, and eat, as we call it,
in the shell; .and this was the first bit of meat 1 had ever
asked God's blessing to, even, as I could remember, in my
whole life.
After I had eaten, I tried to walk; but found myself so
weak, that I could hardly cany the gun (for I never went
out without that); so I went but a little way, and sat down
upon the ground, looking out upon the sea, which was just
before me, and very calm and smooth. As I sat here, some
such thoughts as these occurred to me.
What is this earth and sea, of which I have seen so much?
Whence is it produced? And what am I, and all the other
creatures, wild and tame, human and brutal, whence are we?
Sure we are all made by some secret power, who formed
the earth and sea, the air and sky; and who is that?
Then it followed most naturally: It is God that has made
it all. Well, but then it came on strongly: If God has made
all these things; he guides and governs them all, and all
things that concern them; for the Being that could make
all things, must certainly have power to guide and direct
them.
If so, nothing can happen in the great circuit of his works,
either without bis knowledge or appointment.
And if nothing happens without his knowledge, he knows
that I am here, and am in this dreadful condition; aud if
nothing happens without his appointment, he has appointed
all this to befall me.
Nothing occurred to my thoughts to contradict any of these
conclusions; and therefore it rested upon me with the greater
force, that it must needs be, that God has appointed all this
to befall me; that I was brought to this miserable circum-
stance by his direction, he having the sole power, not of me
only, but of every thing that happened in the world. Imme-
diately it followed,
Why has God done this to me? What have I done to be
thus used?
My conscience presently checked me in that inquiry, as if
I had blasphemed; and, methought it spoke to me like a
voice, Wretch! dost thou ask what thou hast done? Look
hack upon a dreadful mispent life, and ask thyself what thou
hast not done? Ask, Why is it that thou wert not long ago de-
stroyed? Why wert thou not drowned in Yarmouth roads?
killed in the fight, when the ship was taken by the Sallee man
of war? devoured by wild beasts on the coast of Africa? or,
drowned here, when all the crew perished but thyself?
Dost thou ask, What have I done?
I was struck dumb with these reflections, as one astonish-
ed, and had not a word to say, no, not to answer to myself;
but rose up, pensive and sad; walked back to my retreat, and
went up over my wall, as if I had been going to bed; but my
thoughts were sadly disturbed, and I had no inclination to
sleep; so I sat down in my chair, and lighted my lamp, for it
began to be dark. Now, as the apprehensions of the return
of my distemper terrified me very much, it occurred to my
thought that the Brasillians take no physic but their tobacco,
for almost all distempers; and I had a piece of a roll of tobac-
co m one of the chests, which was quite cured, and some also
that was green, and not quite cured.
I went, directed by Heaven, no doubt; for in this chest I
found a cure both for soul and body. I opened the chest and
found what I looked for, viz. the tobacco; and as the few books
1 had saved lay there too, I took out one of the Bibles whioh
I mentioned before, and which, to this time, I had not found
leisure, or so much as inclination, to look into: I say I took
it out, and brought both that and the tobacco with me to the
table.
What use to make of the tobacco I knew not, as to my dis-
temper, or whether it was good for me or no; but I tried se-
veral experiments with it, as if I was resolved it should hit one
way or other. I first took a piece of a leaf, and chewed it in
my mouth, which indeed, at first, almost stupified my brain;
the tobacco being green and strong, and that I had not been
much used to it: then I took some, and steeped it an hour or
two in rum, and resolved to take a dose of it when I lay down;
and lastly, 1 burnt some upon a pan of coals, and held my nose
close over the smoke of it, as long as I could bear it, as well
for the heat as the virtue of it, ar.d I held it almost to suffo-
cation.
In the interval of this operation, I took up the Bible, and
began to read, but my head was too much disturbed with the
tobacco to bear reading, at least at that time; only, having
opened the book casually, the first words that occurred to me
were these, ' Call on me in the day of trouble, and I will de-
liver, and thou shalt glorify me."
The words were very apt to my case, and made tome im-
pression upon my thoughts at the time of reading them,
though not so much as they did afterwards; for, as for being
delivered, the word had no sound, as I may say to me; the
thing was so remote, so impossible in my apprehension of
things, that I began to say as the children of Israel did, when
they were promised flesh to eat, ' Can God spread a table in
the wilderness?' Sol began to say, Can God himself deliver me
from this place? Vndasit was not for many years that any hope
appeared, this prevailed very often upon my thoughts. But,
however, the words made a great impression upon me, and I
mused upon them very often. It grew now late, and the to-
bacco had, as I said, dozed my head so much, that I inclined
to sleep; so Heft my lamp burning in the cave, lest I should
"want any thing in the night, and went to bed; but before I
lay down, I did what I never had done in all my life, I kneel-
ed dowD, and prayed to God to fulfil the promise to me, that,
if I called upon him in the day of trouble, he would deliver
me. After my broken and imperfect prayer was over, I
drank the rum in which I had steeped the tobacco, which
was so strong and rank of the tobacco, that indeed I could
scarce get it down. Immediately upon this I went to bed,
and I found precently it flew up into my head violently; but
I fell into a sound sleep and waked no more, till, by the sun,
it must necessarily be near three o'clock in the afternoon the
ne.it day; nay, to this hour, I am partly of the opinion that I
slept all the next day and night. and till almost three the day
after; for otherwise I knew not how I should lose a day out
df my reckoning in the days of the week, as it appeared some
years after I had done; for if I had lost it by crossmg and
re-crossing the line, I should have lost more than one day;
but certainly I lost a day in my account, and I never knew
which way.
Be that, however, one way or other, when I awaked, I
found myself exceedingly refreshed, and my spirits livel* and
cheerful. When I got up, I uas stronger than I was the day
before, and my stomach better; for I was hungry, and, in
'
-I
short, I had no fit the next day, but continued much altered
for the better. This was the 29th.
The 30th was my well day, of coarse, and I went abroad
with my gun, but did not care to travel too far. I killed a
sea-fowl or two, something like a brand-goose, and brought
them home, but was not very forward to eat them; so I eat
some more of the turtles eggs, which were very good. This
evening I renewed the medicine, which I had supposed did
me good the day before, viz. the tobacco steeped in rum,
only I did not take so much as before, nor did I chew any
of the leaf, or hold my head over the smoke. However, I
was not so well the next day, which was the 1st of July as I
hoped I should have been; for I had a little spice of the
cold fit, but it was not much.
July 2. I renewed the medicine all the three ways, and
dosed myself with it as at first, and doubled the quantity
which 1 drank.
July 3. I missed the fit for good and all, though I did not
recover my full strength for some weeks after. While 1 was
thus gathering strength, my thoughts ran exceedingly upon
the Scripture. ' I will deliver thee;' and the impossibility of
my deliverance lay much upon my mind, in bar of my ever ex-
pecting it. But as 1 was discouraging my self with such
thoughts, it occurred to my mind, that I pored so much upon
my deliverance from the main affliction, that I disregarded
the deliverance I had received; and I was, as it were, made
to ask myself such questions as these: viz Havel not been
delivered, and wonderfully too, from sickness; from the most
distressed condition that could be, and that was so frightful
to me? And what notice had I taken of it? Had I done my
part? God had delivered me: but I had not glorified him;
that is to say, I had not owned and been thankful for that
as a deliverance, and how could I expect greater delive-
rance !
This touched my heart very much, and immediately I
kneeled down, and gave God thanks aloud, for my recovery
from sickness.
July 4. In the morning, I took the Bible; and beginning
at the New Testament, I began seriously to read it, and im-
posed upon myself to read a while every morning and every
night, not tying myself to a number of chapters, but as long
as my thoughts should engage me. It was not long after T
H
set seriously to this work, but I found my heart more deeply
and sincerely affected with the wickedness of my past life.
The impression of my dream revived, and the words, ' All
these things have not brought thee to repentance,' ran se.
riously in my thoughts. I was earnestly begging of God to
give me repentance, when it happened providentially, the
very day, that readmg the Scripture, I came to these words,
" He is exalted a Prince, and a Saviour to give repentance,
and to give remission ! I threw down the book, and, with
my heart, as well as my hands, lifted up to Heaven, in a kind
of extaoy of joy, I cried.out aloud, 'Jesus, thou Son of Da-
vid, Jesus, thou exalted Prince and Saviour, give me repen-
tance!'
This was the first time that I could say, in the true sense
of the words, that I prayed in all my life; for now I prayed
with a sense of my condition, arid with a true Scripture view
of hope, founded on the encouragement of the word of God;
and from this time, I may say, I began to have hope that
God would hear me.
Now I began to construe the words mentioned above,
* Call on me, and I will deliver you;' in a different sense from
what I had ever done before; for then I had no notion of any
thing being called deliverance, but my being delivered from
the captivity I was in, for though I was indeed at large in
the place, yet the island was certainly a prison to me, and
that in the worst sense in the world, but now 1 learned to
take it in another sense. Now, I looked back upon my past
life with such horror, and my sins appeared so dreadful, that
my soul sought nothing of God but deliverance from the load
of guilt that bore down all my comfort. As for my solitary
life, it was nothing; I did not so much as pray to be deliver-
ed from it, or thiek of it! it was all of no consideration in
comparison of this; and I add this part here, to hint to who-
ever shall read it, that whenever they come to a true sense of
things, they will find deliverance from 'Sin a much greater.
blessing, than deliverance from affliction.
But, leaving this part, I return to my journal
My condition began now to be, though not less miserable
as to my way of living, yet much easier to my mind; and my
thoughts being directed, by a constant reading the Scripture,
and praying to God, to things of higher nature, I had a great
deal of comfort within, which, till now, I knew nothing of.
Aiso, as my health and strength returned, I bestirred myself
to furnish myself with every thing that I wanted, and make
my way of living as regular as I could.
From the 4th of July to the 14th, I was chiefly employed
in walking about with my gun in my hand, a little and a little
at a time, as a man that waa gathering up his strength after
a fit of sickness: for it is hardly to be imagined how low I
was, and to what weakness I was reduced. The application
which I made use of, was perfectly new, and perhaps what
had never cured an ague before; neither can I recommend
it to any one to practise, by this experiment; and though it
did carry off the fit, yet it rather contributed to weaken me:
tur I had frequent convulsions in my nerves and limbs for
some time.
1 learnt from it also, this in particular, that being abroad
in the rainy season was the most pernicious thing to my
health that could be, especially in those rains which came at-
tended with storms, and hurricanes of wind; for as the rain
which came in a dry season, was always most accompanied
with sucli storms, so I found this rain was much more dan-
gerous than the rain which fell in September and October.
I had been now in this unhappy island above ten months:
all possibility of deliverance from this condition seemed to be
entirely taken from me; and I firmly believed that no human
shape had ever set font upon that place. Having now secur-
ed my habitation, as I thought, fully to my mind, I had a
great desire to make a more perfect discovery of the island,
and to see what other productions I might find, which yet I
knew nothing of.
It was the 15th of July that I began to take a more parti-
cular survey of the island itself 1 went up the creek first,
where, as 1 hinted, I brought my rafts on shore. I found, af-
ter I came about two miles up, that the tide did not flow any
higher; and that it was no more than a little brook of run-
ning water, and very fresh and good; but this being the dry
season, there was hardly any water in some parts of it, at
least not enough to run in any stream, so as it could be per-
ceived.
On the bank of this brook, I found many pleasant savannaa
or meadows, plain, smooth, and covered with grass; and, on
the rising parts of them, next to the higher grounds, where
the water, as it might be supposed, never overflowed, I found
a great ileal of tobacco, green, and growing to a great and
very strong stalk. There were divers other plants, which I
had no notion of, or understanding about. and might, per-
haps, have virtues of their own, which I could not find out.
I searched for the Cassava root, which the Indians, in all
that climate, make their bread off; but I could find none. I
saw large plants of aloes, but did not then understand them.
I saw several sugar canes, but wild, and, for want of cultiva-
tion, imperfect. I contented myself with these discoveries
for this time, and came back musing with myself what course
I might take to know the virtue anil goodness of any of the
fruits or plants which 1 should discover, but could bring it to
no conclusion; for, in short, I had made so little observation
while I was in the Brasils, that I knew little of the plants of
the field, at least very little that might serve me to any pur-
pose now in my distress
The next day, the 16th, I went up the same way again;
and, after going something farther than I had gone the
day before, I found the brook and the savannas began to
cease, and the country became more woody than before la
this part I found different fruits, and particularly I found
melons upon the ground in great abundance, and grapes upon
the trees: the vines had spread indeed over the trees, and the
clusters of grapes were just now in theii prime, very ripe and
rich. This was a surprising discovery, and I was exceeding
glad of them; but I was warned by my experience, to eat
sparingly of them, remembering that when I was ashore in
Bar .ary, the eating of grapes killed several of our English-
men who were slaves there, by throwing them into fluxes and
fevers: but I found an excellent use for these grapes, and
that was to cure or dry them in the sun, and keep them as
dried grapes or raisins are kept, which 1 thought would be,
as indeed they were, as wholesome, and as agreeable to eat,
when no grapes might be had.
I spent all that evening there, and went not back to my ha-
bitation. whieh by the way, was the first night, as I might
say. I had lain from home. In the night I took my first con-
trivance, and got up into a tree; where I slept well, and the
next morning proceeded upon my discovery, travelling near
four miles, as I might judge by the length of the valley,
keeping still due north, with a ridge of hills on the south and
north side of me.
At the end of this march, I came to an opening, where
the country seemed to descend to the west; and a little spring
of fresh water, which issued out of the side of the hill by me,
ran the other way, that is, due east; and the country appear-
ed so fresh, so green, so flourishing, every thing being in a
constant verdure or flourish of spring, that it looked like a
planted garden.
I descended a little on the side of that delicious valley,
surveying it with a secret kind of pleasure (though mixed
with other afflicting thoughts,) to think that this was all
my own, that I was king and lord of all this country indefea-
sibly, and had a right of possession; and, if I could convey
it, I might have it in inheritance, as completely as any lord
of a manor in England. I saw here abundance of cocoa-
trees, orange and lemon, and citron-trees; but all wild, and
few bearing any fruit, at least not then. However, the green
times that I gathered were not only pleasant to eat, but very
wholesome; and I mixed their juice afterwards wiih water,
which made it very wholesome, and very cool and refresh-
ings
I found now I had business enough to gather and carry
home; and I resolved to lay up a store, as well of grapes as
Ernes and lemons, to furnish myself for the wet season, which
1 knew was approaching. ~
In order to this, I gathered a great heap of grapes in
one place, and a lesser heap in another place, and a great
parcel cf limes and lemons in another place, and, taking a
few of each with me, I travelled homeward, and resolved to
come again, and bring a bag or sack, or what I could make,
to carry the rest home.
Accordingly, having spent three days in this journey, I
came home (sol must now call my tent and my cave); .but,
before I got thither, the grapes were spoiled: the richness
of the fruit, and the weight of the juice, having broken them
and bruised them, they were good for little or nothing; as to
the limes, they were good, but I could bring but a few.
The next day, being the 18th, I went baek, having made
me two small bags to bring home my harvest; but I was sur-
prised, when coming to my heap of grapes, which were so
rich and fine when I gathered them, 1 found them all spread
abroad, trod to pieces, and dragged about, some here,
some there, and abundance eaten and devoured. By this, I
1H
concluded, there were some wild creatures thereabouts,
which had done this; hut what they were, I knew not
However, as I found there was no laying them up on heaps,
and no carrying them away in a sack, but that one way they
would be destroyed, and the other way they would be crush,
ed by their own weight, I took another course; for I gathered
a large quantity of the grapes, and hung them upon the out-
branches of the trees, that they might cure and dry in the sun;
and as for the limes and lemons, I carried as many back as I
could well stand under.
When I came home from this journey, I contemplated
with great pleasure, the fruitfulness of that valley, and the
pleasantness of the situation, the security from storms on that
side of the water, and the wood; and concluded that I had
pitched upon a place to fix my abode, which was, by far, the
worst part of the country. Upon the whole, I began to con-
sider of removing my habitation, and to look out for a place
equally safe as where 1 now was situate, if possible, in that
pleasant fruitful part of the island.
This thought run long in my head, and X was exceeding
fond of it for some time, the pleasantness of the place temp-
ting me; but when I came to a nearer view of it, and to con-
sider that I was now by the sea-side, where it was at least
possible that something might happen to my advantage, and
'that the same ill fate that brought me hither, might bring
some other unhappy wretches to the same place; and though
it was scarce probable, that any such thing should ever hap-
pen, yet, to enclose myself among the hills and woods in the
centre of the island, was to anticipate my bondage, and to
render such an affair not only improbable, but impossible;
and that therefore I ought not, by any means, to remove.
However, I was so enamoured with this place, that I spent
much of my time there, for the whole remaining part of the
month of July; and though, upon second thoughts, I resolved
as above, not to remove, yet I built me a little kind of a
bower, and surrounded it, at a distance, with a strong fence,
being a double hedge, as high as I could reach, well staked
and filled between with brush-wood; and here I lay very se-
cure, sometimes two or three nights together, always going
over it with a ladder, as before, so that I fancied now I had
my country house, and my sea coast house; and this work
took me up to the beginning of August,
I had but newly finished my fence, ami began to enjoy my
labour when the rains came on, and made me stick close to
my first habitation; for though I had made me a tent like the
other, with a piece of a sail, and spread it very well, yet I
bad not the shelter of a hill to keep me from storms, nor a
care behind me to retreat into, when the rains were extraor-
dinary.
About the beginning of August, as I said, I had finished
»y bower, and began to enjoy myself. The 3d of August, I
found the grapes I had hung np were perfectly dried, and
indeed were excellent good raisins of the sun; so I began to
take them down from the trees, and it was very happy that
I did so, for the rains which followed would have spoiled them,
and I had lost the best part of my winter food; for I had
above two hundred large bunches of them. No sooner had
I taken them all down, and carried most of them home to my
caw, bnt it began to rain; and from hence, which was the
14th of August, it rained more or less every day, till the mic-
elle of October; and sometimes so violently that I could not
stir out of my cay for several days.
In this seasonal was much surprised with the increase of
my family. I had been concerned for the loss of one of my
cats, who ran away from me, or, as I thought had been dead;
and I heard no more tale or tidings of her, till, to my asto-
nishment, she came home about the end of August, with
three kittens. This was the more strange to me, because,
•hough I had killed a wild cat, as I called it, with my gun,
yet I thought it was a quite different kind from our European
cats; yet the young cats were the same kind of house-breed,
Eke the old one; and both my cats being females, I thought
it very strange. Rut from these three cats, I afterwards
came to be so pestered with cats, that I was forced to kill
them like vermin, or wild beasts, and to drive them from my
Louse as much as possible.
From the 14th of August to the 26th, incessant rain, so
that I could not stir, and was now very careful not to he
much wet. In this confinement I began to be straitened for
food; kut venturing out twice, I one day killed a goat; and
the last day, which was the 26i|i, found a very large tortoise,
aihicb was a treat to me, and my food was regulated thus: I
eat a bunch of raisms for my breakfast, a piece of the goat's
flesh, or of the turtle, for my dinner, broiled (for, to my great
/
misfortune, I had no vessel to boil or stew any thing), and
two or three of the turtle's eggs for supper.
Durmg this confinement m my cover by the rain, I worked
daily two or three hours at enlarging my cave; and by de-
grees, worked it on towards one side, till I came to the out-
side of the hill, and made a door or way out, which came
beyond my fence or wall, and so I came in and out this way.
But I was not perfectly easy at lying so open; for, as 1 had
managed myself before, I wasin a perfect enclosure, whereas
now I thought I lay exposed: and yet I could not perceive
that there was any living thing to fear, the biggest creature
that I had yet seen upon the island being a goat.
September the 30th. I was now come to the unhappy an-
niversary of my landing least up the notches on my post,
and found that I had been on shore three hundred and sixty-
five days. I kept this day as a solemn fast, setting it a part
to religious exercise, prostrating myself on the ground with
the most serious humiliation, confessing my sins to God, ac-
knowledging his righteous judgments upon me, and praying
to him to have mercy on me, through Jesus Christ; and
having not tasted the least refreshment for twelve hours, even
till the gomg down of the sun, I then eat a biseuit-cake, and
a bunch of grapes, and went to bed, finishing the day as I be-
gan it.
I had all this time observed no Sabbath day; for as at first
I had no sense of religion upon my mind, I had after some
time omitted to distinguish the weeks, by making a longer
notch than ordinary for the Sabbath-day, and so did not real-
ly know what any of the days were; but now having east up
the days as above, 1 found 1 had been there a year, sol divi-
ded it into Veeks, and set apart every seventh day for a Sab-
hath; though 1 found at the end of my account, I had lost a
day or two m my reckoning.
A little after this, my ink began to fail me, and so I con-
tented myself to use it more sparingly, and to writedown
only the most remarkable events of my life, without contmu-
ing a daily memorandum of other things
The rainy season, and the dry season, began now to appear
regular to me, and I learned to divide them so as to provide
for them accordingly. But I bought all my experience be-
fore I had it: and this I am going to relate, was one of the
most discouraging experiments that I made at all. I have
mentioned, that I had saved the few ears of barley and rice '
which I had so surprisingly found spring up, as I thought, of
themselves, and believe there were about thirty stalks of rice,
and about twenty of barley; and now I thought it a proper
time to sow it after the rains, the sun being in its southern
position, going from me.
Accordingly, I dug up a piece of ground, as Well as I could,
with my wooden spade, and dividing it into two parts, I sow-
ed my grain; but, as I was sowing, it casually occurred to
my thoughts, that I would not sow it all at first, because I
<hd not know when was the proper time for it; so I sowed
about two-thirds of the seed, leaving about a handful of each.
It was a great comfort to me afterwards that I did so, for
not one grain of that I sowed this time came to any thing;
for the dry months following, the earth having had no rain
after the seed was sown, it had no moisture to assist its
growth, and never came up at all, till the wet season had
come again, and then it grew as if it had been but newly
sown.
Finding my first seed did rot grow, which I easily imagined
was by the draught, I sought for a moister pieee of ground to
make another trial in; and I dug up a piece of ground near
my new bower, and sowed the rest of my seed in February, a
little before the vernal equinox; and this, having the rainy
months of March and April to water it, sprung up very plea-
santly, and yielded a very good crop; but having part of the
teed left only, and not daring to sow all that I had yet, I had but
a small quantity at last, my whole crop not amounting to
above half a peck of each kind.
But, by this experiment, I was made master of my busi-
ness, and knew exactly when the proper season was to sow;
and that I might expect two seed-times, and two harvests,
every year.
While this earn was growing, I made a little discovery,
-which was of use to me afterwards. As soon as the rains
-were over, and the weather began to settle, which was about
the month of November, I made a visit up the country to my
bower, where, though I had not been some months, jet I found
all things just as I left them The circle, or double hedge,
that I had made, was not only firm and entire, but the stakes
ithich I had cut off of some trees that grew thereabouts, were
all shot out, and grown with long branches, as much as a
willow-tree usually shoots the first year after lopping its head.
I could not tell what tree to call it that these stakes were cut
from. I was surprised, and yet very well pleased, to see the
young trees grow and I pruned them, and led them up to
grow as much alike as I could: and it is scarce credible how
beautiful a figure they grew into in three years, so that though
the hedge made a circle of about twenty-five yards, in diame-
ter, yet the trees, for such 1 might now call them, soon co-
vered it, and it was a complete shade, sufficient to lodge un-
der all the dry season.
This made me resolve to cut some more stakes, and make
me a hedge, like this, in a semicircle, round my wall, I mean.
that of my first dwelling, which I did, and placing the trees
or stakes in a double row, at about eight yards' distance from
my first fence, they grew presently, and were at first, a fine
cover to my habitation, and afterwards served for a defence
also, as I shall observe in its order.
I found now that the seasons of the year might generally
he divided, not into summer and winter, as in Europe; but
into the rainy season, and the dry season, which were gene-
rally thus:

The rainy season sometimes held longer or shorter, as the
winds happen to blow; but this was the general onservation
I made. Alter I had found, by experience, the ill consequence
of being abroad in the rain, I took care to famish my.
self with provisions before-hand, that I might not be obliged
to go out; and I sat within doors, as much as possible, during
the wet months.
In this time I found much employment (and very suitable
also to the time); for 1 found great occasion of many things
-which I had no way to furnish myself with, but by hard labour,
and constant application: particularly, I tried many ways to
make myself a basket; but all the twigs I could get for the
purpose proved so brittle, that they would do nothing. It
proved of excellent advantage to me now, that, when I was a
boy, I used to take great delight in standing at a basket-ma-
ker's, in the town where my father lived, to see them make
their wicker-ware; and being, as boys usually are, very offi-
cious to help, and a great observer of the manner how they
-worked those things, and sometimes lending a hand, I had,
by this means, so full knowledge of the methods of it, that I
wanted nothing but the materials: when it came into my mind,
that the twigs of that tree, from whence I cut my stakes that
grew, might possibly be as tough as the sallows and w Hows,
and osiers in England; and I resolved to try.
Accordingly, the next day; I went to my country house, as
I called it, and cutting some of the smaller twigs, I found
them to my purpose as much as I could desire: wherenpon
I came the next time prepared with a hatchet to cut down a
quantity, which I soon found, for there was great plenty of
them. These I set up to dry within my circle or hedge, and
when they were fit for, use, I carried them to my cave; and
here, during the next season, I employed myself in making,
as well as I could, a great many baskets, both to carry earth,
or to carry or lay up any thing, as I had occasion; and
though I did not finish them very handsomely, yet I made
them sufficiently serviceable for my purpose: and thus, after-
wards, 1 took care never to be without theni. and, as my
wicker-ware decayed, I made more; especially I made strong
deep baskets to place my corn in, instead of sacks, when I
should come to have any quantity of it.
Having mastered this difficulty, and employed a world of
time about it, I bestirred myself to see, if possible, how to
supply two wants I had no vessels to hold any thing that was
liquid, except two runlets, which were almost full of rum, and
some glass bottles, some of the common size, and others
which were case hotlles square, for the holding of water,
spirits, &c. I had not so much as a pot to boil any thing in,
except a great kettle which 1 saved out of the ship, and which
was too big for such uses as I desired it lor, viz. to make broth,
and stew a bit of meat by itself. The second thing I would
fain have had, was a tobacco-pipe, but it was impossible lor
me to make one: however, 1 found a contrivance for that too
at last.
I employed myself in planting my second rows of stakes or
piles; and in this wicker-work, all the summer, or dry season;
when another business took me up more time than it could
be imagined 1 could spare.
I mentioned before, that I had a great mind to see the
whole island, and that I had travelled up the brook, and so
on to where I built my bower, and where I had an opening
Suite to the sea, on the other side of the island. I now re-
solved to travel quite across to the sea-shore on that side; so
taking my gun, a hatchet, and my dog, and a larger quantity
of powder and shot than usual, with two biscuit cakes, and a
large bunch of raisins in my pouch, for my store, i began my
journey When I had passed the vale where my bower
stood, as above, I came within view of the sea, to the west;
and it being a very clear day, I fairly descried land, whether
an island or a continent, I could not; tell; but it lay very high, .
extending from the west, to the W S. W. at a very great
distance: by my guess, it could not be less than fifteen or
twenty leagues off.
I could not tell what part of the world this might be, other-
wise than that I knew it must be part of America; and, as I
concluded, by all my observations, must be near the Spanish
dominions, and perhaps was all inhabited by savages, where,
if I should have landed, I had been in a worse condition than
I was now; and therefore 1 acquiesced in the dispositions of
Providence, which I began now to own, and to believe, or-
dered every thing for the best; I say, I quieted my mind withv
this, and left afflictmg myself with fruitless wishes of being
there.
Besides, after some pause upon this affair, I considered,
that if this land was the Spanish coast, I should certainly, one
time or other, see some vessels pass or repass one way or
other; but if not, then it was the savage coast between the
Spanish country and Brasils, which were indeed the worst oV
savages, for they are cannibals, or men -eaters, and fail not to
murder and devour all the human bodies that fall into their
hands.
With these considerations I "walked very leisurely forward.
I found that side of the island where I now was much pleasan-
ter than mine, the open or savanna fields sweet, adorned with
flowers and grass, and full of Very fine woods. I saw abun-
dance of parrots, and fain would I have caught one, if possi-
ble; to have kept it to be tame, and taught it to speak to me.
I did, after some pains-taking, catch a young parrot; for I
knocked it down with a stick, and having recovered it, I
brought it home, but it was some years before I could make
him speak. However, at last I taught him to call me by my
name very familiarly. But the accident that followed, though
it be a trifle, will be vei-y diverting in its place.
I was exceedingly diverted with this journey. I found in
the low grounds; hares, as I thought them to be, and foxes,
but they differed greatly from all the other kinds I had met
with; nor could 1 satisfy myself to eat them, though I killed
several. But I had no need to be venturous, for I had no
want of food, and of that which was very good too; especial-
ly these three sorts, viz. goats, pigeons, and turtle or tortoise,
which, added to my grapes, Leadenhall market could not
have furnished a table better than I, in proportion to the com-
pany. And though my case was deplorable enough, yet I
had great cause for thankfulness, that I was not driven to
any extremities for food; but had rather plenty even to dain-
ties.
I never travelled in this journey above two miles outright
in a day, or thereabouts; but I took so many turns and re.
turns to see what discoveries I could make, that I came
weary enough to the place where I resolved to sit down for
all night; and then 1 either reposed myself in a tree, or sur-
rounded myself with a row of stakes set uprightin the ground,
either from one tree to another, or so as no wild creature
could come at me, without waking me.
As soon as I came to the sea-shore, I was surprised to see
that I had taken up my lot on the worst side of the island;
for here indeed the shore was covered with innumerable tur-
tles; whereas on the other side I had found but three in a
year and a half. Here was also an infinite number of fowls,
of many kinds, some of which I had seen, and some of
I
which I had not seen before, and many of them very good
meat; bat such as I knew not the names of, except those cal-
led penguins.
I could have shot as many as I pleased, but was very sparing
of my powder and shot; and therefore had more mind to kill
a she-goat, if I could, which I could better feed on. And
though there were many goats here more than on my side of
the island, yet it was with much more difficulty that I could
come near them, the country being flat and even, and they
saw me much sooner than when I was on the hills.
I confess this side of the country was much pleasanter
than mine, but yet I had not the least inclination to remove;
for as I was fixed in my habitation, it became natural to me;
and I seemed all the while I was here, to be, as it were, upon a
journey, and from home. However, I travelled along the
shore of the sea, towards the east, I suppose about twelve
miles; and then setting up a great pole upon the shore. for a
mark, I concluded I would go home again; and that the next
journey I took should be on the other side of the island, east
from my dwelling, and so round, till I came to my post again:
of which in its place.
I took another way to come back than that I went, think-
ing I could easily keep all the island so much in my view,
that I could not miss fmding my first dwelling, by viewing the
country: but 1 found myself mistaken; for being come about
two or three miles, I found myself descended into a very
large valley, but so surrounded with hills, and those hills
covered with woods, that I could not see which was my way
by any direction but that of the sun, nor even then, unless I
knew very well the position of the sun at that time of the
day
It happened to my farther misfortune, that the weather
proved hazy for three or four days, while I was in this valley;
and not being able to see the sun, 1 wandered about very un-
comfortably, and at last was obliged to find out the sea-side,
look for my post, and come back the same way I went; and
then, by easy journeys, I turned homeward, the weather being
exceeding hot: and my gun, ammunition, hatchet, and other
things, very heavy.
In this journey my dog surprised a young kid, and seized
upon it; and I running in to take hold of it, caught it, and
saved it alive from the dog. I had a great mind to bring it
home, if I could; for 1 had often been musing whether it
might not be possible to get a kid or two, and so raise a breed
of tame goats, which might supply me when my powder and
shot should be all spent.
I made a collar to this little creature, and with a string
which 1 made of some rope-yarn, which I always carried about
me, I led him along, though with some difficulty, till I came
to my bower, and there I enclosed him, and left him; for I
was very impatient to he at home, from whence 1 had been
absent above a month.
I cannot express what a satisfaction it was to me to come
into my old hutch, and lie down in my hammock-bed. This
little wandering journey, without any settled place of abode,
had been so unpleasant to me, that my own house, as I called
it to myself, was a perfect settlement to me, compared to that;
and it rendered every thing about me so comfortable, that I
resolved 1 would never go a great way from it again, while it
should be my lot to stay on the island.
I reposed myself here a week, to rest and regale myself
after my long journey, during which, most of thetime was
taken up in the weighty affair of making a cage for my poll,
who began now to be a mere domestie, and to be mighty well
acquainted with me Then I began to think of the poor kid,
which I had pent within my little circle, and resolved to go
and fetch it home, or give it some food: accordingly I went,
and found it where I left it, for indeed it could not get out,
but was almost starved for want of food I went and cut
boughs of trees, and branches of such shrubs as I could find,
and threw it over; and having fed it, I tied it as I did before,
to lead it away; but it was so tame with being" hungry, that I
had no need to have tied it, for it followed me like a dog:
and as I continually fed it, the creature became so loving, so
gentle, and so fond, that it became, from that time, one of
my domestics also, and would never leave me afterwards.
The rainy season of the autumnal equinox was now come,
and I kept the 30th of September in the same solemn man-
ner as before, being the anniversary of my landing on the
island, having now been there two years, and no more pros-
pect of being delivered than the first clay I came there. I
spent the whole day in humble and thankful acknowledgments
of the many wonderful mercies which my solitary condition
was attended with, and without which it might have been in-
finitely more miserable. I gave humble and hearty thanks,
that God had been pleased to discover to me, even that it was
possible I might be more happy in this solitary condition,
than I should have been in a liberty of society, and in all the
pleasures of the world; that he could fully make up to me the
deficiencies of my solitary state, and the want of human so-
ciety, by his presence, and the communications of his grace
to my soul, supporting, comforting, and encouraging me to
depend upon his providence here, and hope for his eternal
presence hereafter.;'
It was now that I began sensibly to feel how much more
happy the life I now led was, with all its miserable circum-
stances, than the wicked, cursed, abominable life I led all the
past part of my days; and now having changed both my sor-
rows and my joys, my very desires altered, my affections
changed their gusts, and. my delights were perfectly new,
from what they were at my first coming, or indeed for the
two years past .
Before, as I walked about, either on my hunting, or for
viewing the country, the anguish of my soul at my condition
would break out upon me on a sudden, and my very heart
would die within me, to think of the woods, the mountains,
the desarts I was in; and how I was a prisoner locked up,
with the eternal bars and bolts of the ocean, in an uninhabited
wilderness, without redemption. In the midst of the greatest
composures of my mind, this would break out upon me, like
a storm, and make me wring my hands, and weep like a child.
Sometimes it would take me in the middle of my work, and
I would immediately sit down and sigh, and look upon the
ground for an hour or two together, and this was still worse
to me; for if I could burst out into tears, or vent myself by
words, it would go off, and the grief, having exhausted itself,
would abate.
But now I began to exercise myself with new thoughts. I
daily read the word of God, and applied all the comforts of it
to mv present state. One morning,' being very sad, I opened
the Bible upon these words, 'I will never, never leave thee, nor
forsake thee!' Immediately it occurred, that these words
were to me; why else should they be directed in such a man-
ner, just at the moment when I was mourning over my con-
dition, as one forsaken of God and man? 'Well then,' said I,
•if God does not forsake me, of what ill consequence can it
be, or what matters it, though the world should all forsake me,
seeing, on the other hand, if I hid all the world, and should
lose the favour and blessing of God, there would be no
comparison in the loss?
From this moment I began to conclude in my mind that it
was possible for me to be more happy in this forsaken, solita-
ry condition, than it was probable I should have ever been in
any other particular state in the world; and, with this thought,
I was going to give thanks to God for bringing me to this
place.
I know not what it was, but somethmg shocked my mind at
that thought, and I durst not speak the words ' How canst thou
be such a hypocrite (said I, even audibly), to pretend to be
thankful for a condition which, however thou mayest endea-
vour to be contented with, thou wouldst rather pray heartily
to be delivered from?' So I stopped there. But though I
could not say, 1 thanked God for being there; yet I sincerely
gave thanks to God for opening my eyes, by whatever afflic-
ting providences, to see the former condition of my life, and
to mourn for my wickedness, and repent. I never opened the
Bible, or shut it, btft my very soul within me blessed God for
directing my friend in England, without any order of mine, to
pack it up among my goods, and for assisting mc afterwards
to save it out of the wreck of the ship.
Thus, and in this disposition of mind, I began my third
yean and though I have not given the reader the trouble of so
particular an account of my works this year as the first; yet
in general it may be observed, that I was very seldom idle,
having regularly divided my time according to the several
daily employments that were before me; such as, First, My
duty to God, and reading the Scriptures, which I constantly
set apart some time for, thrice every day. Secondly, The
going abroad with my gun for food, which generally took me
up three hours in every morning, when it did not ram.
Thirdly, The ordering, curing, preserving, and cooking what
I had killed or catched for my supply, these took up great
part of the day Also it is to be considered, that the middle
of the day, when the sun was in the zenith, the violence of
the heat was too great to stir out, so that about four hours in
the evening was all the time I could be supposed to work in;
with this exception, that sometimes I changed my hours of
12
hunting and working, and went to work in the morning, and
abroad with my gun in the afternoon.
Tn this short time allowed for labour, I desire may be ad-
ded the exceeding laboriousness of my work, the many hours
which, for the want of tools, want of help, and want of skill,
every thin;; that I did, took up out of my time. For example,
I was full twoand-forty days making me a board for a long
shelf, which I wanted in my cave; whereas two sawyers, with
their tools and a sawpit, would have cut six of them, out of
the same tree, in half a day.
My case was this: it was to be a large tree which was to
be cut down, because my board was to be a broad one. This
tree I was three days a cutting down, and two more cutting off
the boughs, and reducing it to a log or piece of timber. With
inexpressible hacking and hewing, I reduced both the sides
of it into chips, till it began to be light enough to move; then
I turned it, and made one side of it smooth and flat as a
board, from end to end; then turning that side downward, cut
the other side, till I brought the plank to be about three in-
ches thick, nd smooth on both sides. Any one may judge
the labour of my hands in such a piece of work; but labour
and patience carried me through that, and many other things.
I only observe this in particular, to show the reason wby so
much of my time went away with so little work, viz. that
what might be a little to be done with help and tools, was a
vast labour, and required a prodigious time to do alone, and
by hand.
But, notwithstanding this, with patience and labour I went
through many things, and indeed every thing that my cir-
cumstances made necessary for me to do, as will appear by
what follows.
I was now in the months of November and December, ex.
pecting my crop of barley and rice. The ground I had
manured or dug tip for them was not great; for, as I obser-
ved, my seed of each was not above the quantity of half a
peck, for I had lost one whole crop by sowing in the dry sea-
son, but now my crop promised very well, when, on a sud-
den I found I was in danger of losing' it all again, by enemies
of several sorts, which it was scarce possible to keep from it;
as first, the goats, and wild creatures which I called hares, - ~
who, tasting the sweetness of the blades, lay in it night ami
day, as soon as it came up, anil eat it so close, that it could
get no time to shoot up into stalk.
This I saw no remedy for, but my making an enclosure
about it with a hedge, which I did with a great deal of toil,
and the more because it required speed, the creatures daily
spoiling my corn- However, as my arable land- was but small,
suited to my crop, I got it totally well fenced in about three
week's time; and shooting some of ihe creatures in the day
time, 1 set my dug to guard it in the night, tying him up to a
stake at the gate, where he would stand and bark all night
long; so, in a little time, the enemies forsook the place, and
the corn grew very strong and well, and began to ripen
apace.
Hut, as the beasts ruined me before, while my corn was
in the blade, so the birds were as likely to ruin me now, when it
was in the ear, for going along by the place to see how it
throve, I saw my little cTop surrounded with fowls. of I know
not how many sorts, who stood, as it were, watching till I
should be gone. I immediately let fly among them (for 1 al-
ways had my gun with me). I had no sooner shot, but there
rose up a little cloud of fowls, which I had not seen at all,
from among the corn itself.
This touched me sensibly; for I foresaw that, in a few
days, they would devour all my hopes; that I should be star-
ved, and never be able to raise a Clop at all; and what to do,
I could not tell However, I resolved not to lose my corn, if
possible, though I should watch it night and day. In the first
place, I went among it to see what damage was already done,
and found they had spoiled a good deal of it; but that, as it
was yet too green for them, the loss was not so great, but
that the remainder was like to be a good crop, if it could be
saved.
I staid by it to load my gun, and then coming away, I could
easily see the thieves sitting upon all the trees about me, as if
they only waited till I was gone away, and the event proved
it to be so; for as I walked offas if I was gone, I was no sooner
out of their sight, hut they dropped down one by one, into
the corn again. I was so provoked, that I could not have
patience to stay till more came on, knowing that every grain
that they eat now. was, as it might be said, a peck loaf to me
in the consequence; but, coming up to the hedge, I fii-ed
again, and killed three of them. This was what I wished
for' so I took them up, and served them as we serve noto-
rious thieves in England, viz. hanged {.hum in chains for a
terror to others. It is impossible to imagine almost that this
should have such an effect as it it had for the fowls would
not only not come at the corn, but in short, they forsook all
that part of the island, and I could never see a bird near the
place as long as my scarecrows hung there.
Thi.s I was very glad of, you may be sure; and about the
latter end of December, which was our second harvest of the
year, I reaped my crop. *
I was sadly put to it for a scythe, or a sickle, to cut it down,
and all 1 could do was to make one as well as I could,
out of one of the broad swords, or cutlasses, which I saved
among the arms out of the ship. However, as my crop was"
but small, I had no great difficulty to cut it down. In short,
I reaped it my way; for I cut nothing off but the ears, and
carried it away in a great basket which I had made, and so
rubbed it out with my hands. And at the end of all my har-
vesting, I found thnt, out of my half peck of seed, I had near
two bushels of rice and above two bushels and a half of bar-
ley; that is to say, by my guess, for I had no measure at that
time
However, this was a great encouragement to me; and I
foresaw that, in time, it would please dod to supply me with
bread. And yet here I was perplexed again, for I neither
knew how to-giind or make meal of my corn, or indeed how
to clean it, and part it; nor, if made into meal, how to make
bread of it; and if how to make it, yet I knew not how- to
bake it These things being added to my desire of having a
good quantity for store, and to secure a constant supply, I
resolved not to taste any of this crop, but to preserve it all for
seed against the next" season, and, in the mean time, to em-
ploy all my study and hours of working to accomplish this
great work of providing myself with corn and bread
Ii might be truly said, that now I worked for my bread.
It is a little wonderful, and what I believe few people have
thought much upon; viz the strange multitude of little things
necessary in the providing, producing, curing, dressing,
making, and finishing this one article of bread-
I, that was reduced to a mere stale of nature, found this to
be my dady discouragement, and was made more and more
sensible of it every hour, even after I had got the first handful
of seed-corn, which, as I have said, came up unexpectedly,
and indeed to a surprise.
First, I had no plough to turn up the earth, no spade or
shovel to dig it. Well, this I conquered by making a wooden
spade, asl observed before; but this did my work but in a wooden
manner: and though it cost me a great many days to make
it, yet for want of iron it not only wore out the sooner. but
made my work the harder, and made it be performed much
worse.
However, this I bore with, and was content to work it out
with patience, and bear with the badness of the performance.
When the corn was sowed, I had no harrow: but was forced
to go over it myself, and drag a great heavy bow of a tree over
it, to scratch the earth, as it may be called, rather than
rake or harrow it.
When it was growing and grown, I have observed already
how many things I wanted, to fence it, secure it. mow or reap
it, cure and carry it home, thresh, part it from the chaff, and
save it. Then I wanted a mill to grind it, sieves to dress it,
yeast and salt to make it into bread, and an oven to bake it
in; and yet all these things I did without, as shall be observed;
and yet the corn was an inestimable comfort and advantage
to me too. All this, as I said, made every thing laborious
and tedious to me, but that there was no help for: neither
was my time so much loss to me, because as I had divided it,
a certain part of it was every day appointed to these works;
and, as I resolved to use none of the corn for bread, till I
had a greater quantity by me, 1 had the next six months to
apply myself wholly by labour and mvention to furnish myself
with utensils proper for the performing all the operations
necessary for the making the corn, when I had it fit for my
use.
But, first, I was to prepare more land, for I had now seed
enough to sow above an acre of ground. Before I did this, I
had a week's work at least to make me a spade, which, when
it was done, was but a sorry one indeed, and very heavy, and re-
quirer! double labour to work with it. However,! went through
that, and sowed my seed in two large flat pieces of ground, as
near my house as I could find them to my mind, and fenced them
in with a good hedge, the stakes of which were all cut of that
wood, which I had set before, which I knew would grow; so that
in one year's time, I knew I shoukl have a quick or living hedge,
that would want but little repair. This work was not so lit-
tle as to take me up less than three months because great
part of that time was of the wet season, when I could not go
abroad.
Within doors, that is, when it rained, and I could not go
Out, I found employment on the following occasions; always
observing, that all the while I was at work, I diverted myself
with talking to my parrot, and teaching him to speak; and
I quickly learned him to know his own name, at last, to speak
it out pretty loud, 'Poll;' which was the first word I ever
heard spoken in the island by any mouth but my own. This
therefore was not my work, but an assistant to my work; for
now, as I said, I had a great employment upon my hands, as
follows, viz I had long studied, bv some means or other, to
make myself some earthen vessel, which indeed I wanted
sorely, but knew not where to come at them. However,con-
sidering the heat of the climate, I did not doubt but, if I could
find out any such clay, I might botch up some such pot. as
might, being dried in the sun, be hard enough, and strong
enough, to hear handling, and to hold any thing that was dry,
and required to be kept so; and as this was necessary in pre-
paring corn, meal, &c. which was the thing I was upon, i
resolved to make some as large as I could, and fit only to
stand like jars to hold what should be put into them.
Ii would make the reader pity me, or rather laugh at me,
to tell how many awkward ways 1 took to raise this paste;
what odd, mishapen, ugly things I made; how many of them
fell in, and how many fell out, the clay not being stiff enough
to bear its own weight; how many cracked by the over vio-
lent heat of the sun, being set out too hastily; and how many
fell to pieces with only removing, as well before as after they
were dried: and, in a word, how, after having laboured hard
to find the clay to dig it, to temper it, to bring it home, and
work it, I could not make above two large, earthen, ugly-
things, 1 cannot call them jars, in about two months labour.
However, as the sun baked these two very dry and hard, I
lifted them very genllc up, and set them down again in two
great wicker-baskets, which I had made on purpose for them,
that they might not break- and as between the pot and the
basket there was little room to spare. I stuffed it full of rice
and barley-straw; and these two pots, being to stand always
dry, I thought would hold my dry corn, and perhaps the meal
when the corn was bruised
Though I miscarried so much in my design for large
pots, yet I made several smaller things with better success;
such as little round pots, flat dishes, pitchers, and pipkins, and
any thing my hand turned to; and the heat of the sun baked
them strangely hard.
But all this would not answer my end, which was to get an
earthen pot to hold what was liquid, and bear the fire, which
none of these could do. It happened after some time, making
a pretty large fire for cooking my meat, when I went to put
it out, after 1 had done with it, I found a broken piece of one.
of my earthen ware vessels in the fire, burnt as hard as a
stone, and red as a tile. I was agreeably surprised to see it,
and said to myself, that certainly they might be made to burn
whole, if they would burn broken.
This set me to study how to order my fire, so as to make it
burn me some pots. I had no notion of a kiln, such as the
potters burn in. or of glazing them with lend, though 1 had
some lead to do it with; hut I placed three large pipkins, and
two or three pots, in a pile one upon another, and placed my
fire wood all round it with a great heap of embers under them.
I plied the fire with fresh fuel round the outside, and upon.
the top, till I saw the pots in the inside red-hot quite through,
and observed that they did not crack at all. When I saw
them clear red, I let them stand in that heat about five or six
hours, till I found one of them, though it did not crack, did
melt or run; for the sand which was mixed with the clay
melted by the violence of the heat, and would have run into
glass, if I hud gone on; so I slacked my fire gradually, till the
pots began to abate of the red colour, and watching them all
night, that I might not let the fire abate too fast, in the morn-
ing I bad three very good, I will not say handsome, pipkins,
and two other earthen pots, as hard burnt as could be desir-
ed; and one of them perfectly glazed with the running of the
sand.
After this experiment, I need not say that I wanted no
sort of earthen-ware for my use; but I must needs say, as to
the shapes of them, (hey were very indifferent, as any one
may suppose, when I had no way of making them, but as chc
children make dirt-pies, or as a woman would make pies that
never learnt to raise paste.
No joy at a thing of so mean a nature was ever equal to
jftine, when I found I had made an earthen pot that would
heai- the fire; anil I had hardly patience to stay till they were
cold. before 1 set one upon the fire again, with some water in
it, to boil me some meat, which it did admirably well; and,
wilh the piece of a kid, I made some very good broth, though
I wanted oatmeal, and several other ingredients requisite to
make it as good as I would have had it.
My next concern was to get me a stone mortar to stamp
or beat some corn in; for as to the mill, there was no thought
of arriving to that perfection of art, with one pair of hands.
To supply this want I was at a great loss; for, of all trades in
tht world, I was as perfectly unqualified for a stonecutter, as
for any whatever: neither had I any tools to go about it with.
1 spent many a day to find out a great stone big enough to
cut hollow, and make fit for a mortar, and could find none at
all, except what was in the solid rock, and which I had no
wav to dig or cut out, nor indeed were the rocks in the island
of hardness sufficient, but were all of asandy crumbling stone,
which would neither bear the weight of a heavy pestle, nor
would break the corn without fillmg it with sand. So, after
a great deal of time lost in searching for a stone, I gave it
over, and resolved to look out a great block of hard wood,
which I found indeed much easier; and getting one as big
as I had strength to stir, I rounded it, and formed it on the
outside with my axe and hatchet; and then, wilh the help of
fire, and infinite labour, made a hollow place in it, as the
Indians in Brasil make their canoes. After this, I made a
great heavy pestle or heater, of thle wood called the iron-
wood, and this I prepared and laid by against I had my
next crop of corn, when I proposed to myself to grim! or
rather pound, my corn into meal to make my bread.
My next difficulty was to make a sieve, or senrce, to
dress my meal, and o part it from the bran and the husk,
without which I did not see it possible I could have. any
Dread. This was a most difficult thing, so much as hut to
think on; for, to be sure, I had nothing like the necessary
thing to make it with, I mean fine thin canvas, or stuff to
scarce the meal through. And here I was at a full stop for
many mouths; nor did I really know what to do: linen I
had none left but what was mere rags. I had goats' hair,
but neither knew I how to weave or spin it; and had I known
how, here were no'ools te work it with: all the remedy that
I found for this, was, that at best I did remember I had,
among the seamen's clothes, which were saved out "of the
ship, some neckcloths of calico or muslin; and with some
pieces of these I made three small sieves, but proper enough
for the work: and thus I made shift for some years. How I
I did afterwards, I shall show in its place
The baking part was the next thing to be considered, and
how I should make bread when I came to have corn; for,
first, I had no yeast. As to that part, as there was no sup-
plying the want, so I did not concern myself much about it;
but for an oven, I was indeed in great pain. \*. length, I
found out an expedient for that also, which was this: I made
some earthen vessels very broad, but not deep; that is to say,
about two feet diameter, and not above nine inches deep:
these I burnt in the fire, as I had done the other, and laid
them by, and when I wanttd to bake, I made a great fire
upon my hearth, which I had paved with some square tiles,
of my own making and burning also: but I should not call
them square-
When the fire wood was burnt pretty much into embers,
or live coals, 1 drew them forward upon this hearth, so as to
cover it all over: and there I let them lie, till the hearth was
very hot, then sweeping away all the embers, I set down my
loaf or loaves, and, whelming down the earthen pot upon
them, drew the embers all round the outside of the pot, to
keep in, aud add to the heat and thus, as well as in the best
oven in the world, I baked my barley .loaves, and became, in
a little time, a mere pastry-cook into the bargain; for I made
myself several cakes of the rice, and puddings: indeed I made
no pies, neither had I any thing to put into them, supposing
I had, except the flesh either of fowls or goats.
It need not be wondered at, if all these things took me up
most part of the third year of my abode here; for it is to be
observed, that in the intervals of these things, I had my new
harvest and husbandry to manage, for I reaped my corn in its
season, and carried it home as well as I could, and laid it up
in the ear, in my large baskets, till I had time to rub it out;
for I had no floor to thresh it on, or instrument to thresh it
with.
And now indeed my stock of corn increasing, I really wan-
ted to build mv barns bigger. I wanted a place to lay it up
K
f
in; for the increase of the corn now yielded me sa much, that
I had of the barley about twenty bushel?, and of the rice S3
much more; insomuch that now I resolved to begin to use it
freely, for my bread had been quite gone a great while; also
I resolved to see what quantity would be sufficient for me a
whole year, and to sow but once a year.
Upon the whole, I found that the forty bushels of barley
and rice were much more than I could consume in a year; so
1 resolved to sow just the same quantity every year that I
sowed the last, in hopes that such a quantity would fully pro-
vide me with bread, Sec.
All the while these things were doing, you may be sure
my thoughts ran many times upon the prospect of land,
which I had seen from the olher side of the island; and I was
not without secret wishes that I were on shore there, fancy-
ing that, seemg the main land, and an inhabited country, I
might find some way or other to convey myself farther, and
perhaps at last find some means of escape.
But all this while I made no allowance for the dangers of
such a condition, and how I might fall mto the hands of sava-
ges, and perhaps such as I might have rtason to think far
worse than the lions and tigers of Africa; that if I once came
into their power, 1 should run a hazard more than a thousand
to one of being killed, and perhaps of being eaten; for I had
heard, that the people of the Caribbean coast were cannibals,
or men eaters; and I knew by the latitude, that I could not
Tie far off from that shore; that suppose they were not canni-
bals, yet they might kill me, as many Europeans who had
fallen into their hands had been served, even when they had
been ten or twenty together; much more I that was but one,
and could make little or no defence. All these things, I say,
which 1 ought to have considered well of, and did cast up in
mv thoughts afterwards, yet took up none of my apprehen-
sions at first; and my head ran mightily upon the thought of
getting over to that shore.
Now I wished for my boy Xury, and the long-boat, with
the shoulder-of mutton sail, with which I sailed above a thou-
sand miles on the coast of Africa; but this was in vain. Then
I thought I would go and look at our ship's boat, which, as I
hare said, was blown up upon the shore, a great way. in the
storm, when we were first cast away She lay almost where she
did at first, but not quia-; and was turned, by the force of the
waves and the -winds, almost bottom upwards, against a high
ridge of beaehy rough sand, but no water about her, as before-
If I had had hands to have refitted her, and to have lun-
ched her into the water, the boat would have done well enough,
and I might gave gone back into the Brasils with her easily
enough; but I might have easily foreseen that I could no more
turn her, and set her upright upon her bottom, than I could
remove the island. However, I went to tilie woods, and cut
levers and rollers, and brought them to the boat, resolved to
try what I could do, suggesting to myself, that if I could but
turn her dowu, I might easily repair the damage she had re-
ceived, and she would be a very good boat, and I might go
to sea in her very easily.
I spared no pains indeed in this piece of fruitless toil, and
spent, I think, three or four weeks aoout it; at last, finding
it impossible to heave it up with my little strength, I fell to
digging away the sand to undermine it, and so to make it fall
down, setting pieces of wood to thrust and guide it right in
the fall
But when I had done this, I was unable to stir it up again,
or to get under it, much less to move it forward towards the
water; so I was forced to give it over: and yet, though I gave
over the hopes of the boat, my desire to venture over for the
main increased, rather than decreased, as the means for it
seemed impossible.
This at length set me upon th.nking, whether it was not pos-
sible to make myself a canoe, or periagua, such as the natives
of those climates make, even without tools, or, as I might say,
without hands, viz. of the trunk of a great tree. This I not
only thought possible, but easy; and pleased myself extreme-
ly with the thoughts of making it, and with my having much
more convenience for it than any of the Negroes or Indians,
but not at all considering the particular inconveniences which
I lay under more than the Indians did, viz. want of hands to
move it into the water, when it was made: a difficulty much
harder for me to surmount, than all the consequences of want
of tools could be to them; for what was it to me, that when I
had chosen a vast tree in the woods, I might with great trou-
ble cut it down; if after I might be able with my tools to hew
and dub the outside into the proper shape of a boat, and b^rn
or cut out the inside to make it hollow, so to make a boat cf
it, if, after all this, I must leave it just where I found it, and
was not able to laneh it into the water?
One would have thought, I could not have had the least
reflection upon my mind of my circumstance, while I was
makmg this boat, but I should have immediately thought how
I should get it into the sea; but my thoughts were so intent
upon my voyage over the sea in it, that I never once consi-
dered how I -liould get it off the land; and it was really, in
its own nature, more easy for me to guide it over forty-five
milts of sea than about forty-five fathom of land, where it lay,
to set it afloat in the water.
I went to work upon this boat the most like a fool that ever
man did, who had any of his senses awake I pleased myself
with the design, without determming whether I wis ever able
to undertake it: not hut that the difficulty of lanching my
boat came often into my head; but I put a stop to my own
inquiries into it, by this foolish answer, which I gave myself:
•Let me first make it; I'll warrant I'll find some way or other
to get it along, when it is done.'
This was a most preposterous method; but the eagerness
of my fancy prevailed, and to work I went, and felled a cedar
tree. I question much whether Solomon ever had such a
one for the building the temple atJerusalem: it was five feet
ten inches diameter, at the lower part next the stump, and
four feet eleven inches diameter, at the end of twenty-two
feet; after which, it lessened for a while, and then parted
into branches, It was not without infinite labour that I felled
this tree I was twenty days hacking and hewing at it at the
"bottom: 1 was fourteen more getting the branches and limbs,
and the vast spreading head of it cut off, which 1 hacked and
hewed through with my axe and hatchet, and inexpressible
labour. After this it cost me a month to shape it, and dub
it to a proportion, and to something like the bottom of a boat,
that it might swim upright asit ought to do It cost me near
three months more to clear the inside, and work it out so as
to make an exact boat of it. This I did indeed without fire,
hy mere mallet and chisel, and by the dint of hard labour,
till I had brought it to be a very handsome pcriagua, arid big
enough to have carried six and twenty men, and consequently
big enough to have carried me and all my cargo
VV lien I had gone through this work, I « as extremely de-
lighted with it. The boat was really much bigger than I ever
^$&m^>na4totp>Q %^z/
saw a canoe, or periagua, that was made of one tree, in
my life; many a weary stroke it had cost, you may be sure,
and there remamed nothing but to get it into the water; and
had I gotten it into the water, I make no question, but I
should have begun the maddest voyage, and the most unlikely
to be performed, that ever was undertaken.
But all my devices to get it into the water failed me, though
they cost me infinite labour too: it lay about one hundred
yards from the water, and not more; but the first inconve-
nience was, it was up hill towards the creek. Well, to take
away this discouragement, I resolved to dig into the surface
of the earth, and so make a declivity. This I began, and it
cost me a prodigious deal of pains: but who grudge pains,
that have their deliverance in view? Hut when this was worked
through, and this difficulty managed, it was still much at one;
for I could no more stir the canoe, than 1 could the other boat.
Then I measured the distance of ground, and resolved to
cut a dock, or canal, to bring the water up to the canoe,
seeing I could not bring the canoe down to the water. Well, I
began this work, and when 1 began to enter into it, and cal-
culated how deep it was to be dug, how broad, how the stuff
was to be thrown out, I found that, bv the number of hands I
had, being none but my own, it must have been ten or twelve
years before I should have gone through wilh it; for the shore
lay high, so that at the upper end it must have been at least
twenty feet deep; so at length, though wilh great reluctaucy,
I gave this attempt over also.
This grieved me heartily; and now I saw, though too
late, the foily of beginning a work before we count the cost,
and before we judge rightly of our own strenglh to go through
with it.
In the middle of this work, I finished my fourth year in
this place, and kept my anniversary with the same devotion,
and with as much comfort as ever before; for by a constant
study, and serious application of the word of God; and by the
assistance of his Grace, 1 gained a different knowledge from
what 1 had belore. I entertained different notions of things.
I looked now upon the world as a thmg remote, which i had
nothing to do wilh, no expectation from, and indeed no de-
sires about; in a word, 1 had nothing mdeed to do wilh it, nor
was ever like to have; so 1 thought it looked, as we may per-
haps look upon it hereafter, viz. as a place I had lived in,
K2
tut was come out of it; and well might I say, as father Abra-
ham to Dives, ' Between me and thee is a great gulf fixed.'
In the first place, I was removed from all the wickedness
of the world here. I had neither the ' lust of the flesh, the
lust of the eye, nor the pride of life'.' I had nothing to coveti
for I had all I was now capable of enjoying: I was lord of the
whole manor, on if I pleased, I might call myself king or em-
peror over the whole country which I had possession of.
There were no rivals. I had no competitor, none to dispute
sovereignty or command with me. I mighi have raised ship-
loadings of corn, but I had no use for it; so I let as little grow
as I thought enough for my occasion. I had tortoises or tur-
tles enough; but now and then one was as much as I could
put to anv use. I had timber enough to have built a fleet of
ships. I had grapes enough to have made wine, or to have
cured into raisins, to have loaded that fleet when they had been
built.
But all I could make use of was all that was valuable- I
had enough to eat, and to supply my wants, and what was nil
the rest to me! If I killed more flesh than I could eat, the
dog must eat it, or the vermin; if 1 sowed more corn than I
could eat, it must be spoiled. The trees that I cat down
were lying to rot on the ground; I could make no more use of
them than for fuel; and that I had no occasion for, but to
dress my food.
In a word, the nature and experience of things dictated to
me, upon just reflection, that all the good things of this world
are no farther good to us, than they are for our use; and that
whatever we may heap up indeed to give others, we enjoy as
much as we can use, and no more. The most covetous,
gripuig miser in the world would have been cured of the vice
of covetousness, if he had been in m> case; for I possessed
infinitely more than I knew what to do with. I had no room
for desire, except it was of things which I had not, and they
were but trifles, though indeed of great use to me. I had, as
I hinted before. a parcel of money, as well gold as silver,
above thirty six pounds sterling Alas' there the nasty, sorry,
useless stuff lay: I had no manner of business for it; and I
often thought with myself, that I would have given a handful
of it for a groce of tobacco pipes, or for a hand-mill to giind
my corn; nay, I would have given it all for six-pennyworth of
turnip and carrot seed out of England, or for a handful of
peas and beans, and a bottle of ink. As it was, I had not the
least advantage by it, or benefit from it; but there it lay in a
drawer and grew mouldy with the damp of the cave, in the
wet season: and if I had had the drawer full of diamonds, it
had been the same case: and they had been of no manner of
value to me, because of no use
I had new brought my state of life to be much easier in it-
self than it was at first, and much easier to my mind, as well
as to my body I frequently sat down to my meat with thank-
fulness, and admired the hand of God's providence, which
had thus spread my table in the wilderness. I learned to
look more upon the bright side of my condition, and less upon
the dark side, and to consider what I enjoyed rather than
what 1 wanted; and this gave me sometimes such secret com-
forts, that I cannot express them, and which I take notice of
here to put those discontented people in mind of it, who can-
not enjoy comfortably what God has given them, because
they see and covet something that he has not given them.
All our discontents about what we want, appeared to me to
spring from the want of thankfulness for what we have.
Another reflection was of great use to me, and doubtless
would be so to any one that should fall into such distress as
mine was; and this was to compare my present condition
with what I at first expected it should be; nay, with what it
-would certainly have been, if the good providence of God had
not wonderfully ordered the ship to be cast up nearer to the
shore, where I not only could corneal her, but could bring what
I got out of her to the shore, for my relief and comfort, with-
out which I had wanted tools to work, weapons for defence,
or gunpowder and shot for getting my food.
I spent whole hours, I may say, whole days, in representing
to myself, in the most lively colours, how I must have acted,
if I had got nothing out of the ship; how 1 could not have
so much as got any food, except fish and turtles; and that,
as it was long before I found any of them, I must have pe-
rished first; that 1 should have lived, if I had not perished,
like a mere savage; that if I had killed a goat or a fowl, by
any contrivance, I had no way to flay or open them, or part
the flesh from the skin and the bowels, or to cut it up, but
must gnaw it with my teeth, and pull it with my claws like a
beast-
These reflections made me very sensible of the goodness ot
Providence to me, and very thankful for my present con-
dition, with all its hardships and misfortunes: and (his part
also I cannot but recommend to the reflection of those who
are apt in their misery to say, Ms any affliction like mine?'
Let tliem consider how much worse the cases of some people
are, and their case might have been, if Providence had
thought fit.
I had another reflection which assisted me also to comfort
my mind with hopes; and this was comparing my present
condition with what I had deserved, and had therefore rea-
son to expect from the hand of Providence. I had lived 8
dreadful life, perfectly destitute of the knowledge and fear
cf God. I had been well instructed by father and mother;
neither had they been wanting to me in their early endea-
vours to infuse a religious awe of God into my mind, a sense
of my duty, and of what the nature and end of my being re-
quired of ;ae. Hut, alas! falling early into the sea-faring life,
which, of all lives, is the most destitute of the fear of God,
though his terrors are always before them; I say, falling early
into the sea-faring life, and into sea faring company, all that
little sense of religion which I had entertamed, was laughed
out of me by my messmates; by a hardened despising of dan-
gers, and the views of death, which grew habitual to me; by
my long absence from all manner of opportunities to converse
with any thing but what was like myself, or to hear any thing
that was good, or tended towards it.
So void was 1 of every thing that was good, or of the least
sense of what I was, or was to be, that in the greatest deli-
verances I enjoyed, such as my escape from Sullee, my being
taken up by the Portuguese master of the ship, my being
planted so well in the Mrasils, my receiving the cargo from
Engiaud, and the like, I never once had the words ' Thank
God,' so much as otrmy mind, or in my mouth; nor in the
greatest distress had 1 so much thought as to pray to him;
nor so much as to say, 'Lord, have mercy upon me!' no, nor
to mention the name of God, unless it was to swear by, and
L!n4pheme it.
I had terrible reflections upon my mind for many months,
as I have already observed, on the account of my wicked and
hardened life past; and when I looked about mc, and cousi-
dered what particular providences had attended me since my
coming into this place, and how God had dealt bountifully
with me; had not only punished me less than my iniquity de-
served, but had so plentifully provided forme: this gave me
great hopes, that my repentance was accepted, and that God
had yet mercies in store for me.
With these reflections I worked my mind up, not only to
resignation to the will of God, in the present disposition of my
circumstances, but even to a sincere thankfulness for my con-
dition, and that I, who was yet a living man, ought not to
complain, seeing I had not the due punishment of my sins;
that I enjoyed so many mercies which I had no reason to have
expected in that place, that I ought never more to repine at
my condition, but to rejoice, and to give daily thanks, for that
daily bread, which nothing but a crowd of wonders could have
brought; that I ought to consider I had been fed even by a
miracle, even as great as that of leeding Elijah by ravens, nay,
by a long series of miracles; and that I could hardly have
named a place in the uninhabited part of the world where I
could have been cast more to my advantage: a place where,
as I had no society, which was my affliction on one hand, so
I found no ravenous beasts, no furious waives or tigers,
to threaten my life; no venomous creatures or poisonous,
which I might have fed on to my hurt; no savages to murder
and devour me.
In a word, as my life was a life of sorrow one way, so it
was a life of mercy another: and I wanted nothing to make
it a life of comfort, but to be able to make my sense of God's
goodness to me, and care over me in this condition, my daily
consolation: and after I made a just improvement of these
things, I went away, and was no more sad.
I had now been here so long, that many things which I
brought on shore for my help were either quite gone, or very
much wasted, and near spent.
My ink, as I observed, had been gone for some time, all
but a very little, which I eked out with water a little and a
little, till it was so pale it scarce left any appearance of black
upon the paper. As long as it lasted, I made use of it to
minute down the days of the month on which any remarkable
thing happened to me: and first, by casting up times past, I
remember that there was a strange concurrence of days, in
the various providences w hich befell me, and which if I had
i
been superstitiously inclined to observe days as fatal or fortu-
nate, I might have had reason to have looked upon with a
great deal of curiosity.
First, I had observed that the same day that I broke away
from my father and my friends, and ran away to Hull, in or-
der to go to sea, the same day afterwards I was taken by the
Sallee man of war, and made a slave.
The same day of the year that I escaped out of the wreck
of that ship in Yarmouth roads, that same day of the year af-
terwards I made my escape from Sallee in the boat.
The same day of the year I was born on, viz. the 30th of
September, the same day I had my life so miraculously saved
twenty-six years after, when I was cast on shore on this island:
so that my wicked life, and solitary life, began both on a day.
The next thing to my ink's being wasted, was that of my
bread, I mean the biscuit which I brought out of the ship.
This I had husbanded to the last degree, allowing myself but
one cake of bread a day, for above a year; and yet I was
quite without bread, for near a year, before 1 got any corn of
my own: and great reason I had to be thankful that 1 had any
at all; the getting it being, as has been already observed, next
to miraculous.
My clothes too began to decay mightily. As to linen, I
had none a good while, except some check shirts which I
found in the chests of the other seamen, and which I careful-
ly preserved, because many times I could bear no other
clothes on but a shirt; and it was a very great help to me
that I had among all the men's clothes of the ship almost
three dozen of shirts. There were also several thick watch-
coats of the seamen, which were left indeed, but they were
too hot to wear; and though it is true, that the weather was
so violent hot, that there was no need of clothes, yet I could
not go quite naked, no, though 1 had been inclined to it, which
I was not, nor could 1 abide the thoughts of it, though I was
all alone.
One reason why I could not go quite naked, was, I could
not bear the heat of the sun so well when quite naked, as
with some clothes on; nay, the very heat frequently blistered
my skin; whereas, with a shirt on, the air itself made some
motion, and whistling under that shirt, was twofold cooler
than without it. No more could I ever bring myself to go
out in the heat of the sun without a cap or a hat, the heat
of the sun beating with such violence as it does in that place,
would give me the head-ache presently, by darting so directly
on my head, without a cap or a hat on, so that I coidd not
bear it; whereas, if I put on my hat, it would presently go
away.
Upon these views I began to consider about putting the few
rags I had, which I called clothes, into some order. 1 had
worn out all the waistcoats I had, and my business was now
to try if I could not make jackets out of the great watch-
coats which I had by me, and with such other materials as I
had; so I set to work a tailoring, or rather indeed a botching,
for I made most piteous work of it. However, I made shift
to make two or three new waistcoats, which I hoped would
serve me a great while; as for breeches or drawers, I made
hut very sorry shift indeed, till afterwards
I have mentioned that I saved the skins of all the Crea-
tures that I killed, I mean the four-footed ones; and I had
hung them up stretched out with sticks in the sun, by which
means some of them were so dry and hard, that they were
fit for little, but others were very useful. The first thing I
made of these was a great cap for my head, with the hair on
the outside to shoot off the rain; and this 1 performed so well
that, after this, 1 made me a suit of clothes, wholly of those
skins; that is to say, a waistcoat and breeches, open at knees,
and both loose; for they were rather wanting to keep me cool,
than to keep me warm I must not omit to acknowledge,
that they were wretchedly made; for if I was a bad carpen-
ter, I was a worse tailor. However, they were such as I
made a very good shift with, and when I was abroad, if it hap-
pened to rain, the hair of the waistcoat and cap being out-
most, I was kept very dry.
After this I spent a great deal of time and pains to make
me an umbrella: I was indeed in great want of one, and had a
great mind to make one. 1 had seen them made in the Bra-
sils, where they are very useful in the great heats which arc
there; and I felt the heats every jot as great here, and great-
er too, being nearer the equinox; besides, as I was obliged
to be much abroad, it was a most useful thing to me, as well
for the rains as the heats. I took a world of pains at it, and
was a great while before I could make any thing likely to
hold; nay, after I thought I had hit the way, 1 spoiled two or
three before I made one to my mind: but, at last, I made
one that answered indifferently well. The main difficulty.I
found was to make it to let down. I could make it to spread;
but if it did not let down too, and draw in, it would not be
portable for me any way but just over my head, which would
not do. However, at last, as I said, I made one to answer: I
covered it with skins, the hair upwards, so that it cast off the
ram like a penthouse, and kept off the sun so effectually, that
I could walk out in the hottest of the weather, with greater
advantage than I could before in the coolest; and when I had
no need of it, I could close it, and carry it under my arm.
Thus I lived mighty comfortably, my mind being entirely
composed, by resigning to the will of God, and throwing my-
self wholly upon the disposal of his providence. This made
my life better than sociable; for when I began to regret the
want of conversation, I would ask myself, whether thus con-
versing mutually with my own thoughts, and, as I hope I may
say, with even my Maker, by ejaculations and petitions, was
not better than the utmost enjoyment of human society in
the world?
I cannot say that after this, for five years, any extraordina-
ry thing happened to me; but I lived on in the same course,
in the same posture and place, just as before. The chief
thing I was employed in, besides my yearly labour and plant-
ing my barley and rice, and curing my raisins, of both which
I always kept up just enough to have sufficient stock of one
year's provisions before-hand; I say, besides thisyearly labour,
and my daily labour of going out with my gun, I had one
labour to make me a canoe, which at last I finished. So that
by digging a canal to it six feet wide, and four feet deep, I
brought it into the creek, almost half a mile. As for the first,
that was so vastly big, as I made it without considering before-
hand, as I ought to do, how I should be able to lanch it; so
never being able to bring it to the water, or bring the water
to it, I was obliged to let it lie where it was, as a memoran-
dum to teach me to be wiser the next time. Indeed the next
time, though I could not get a tree proper for it, and was in
a place where I could not get the water to it, at any less dis-
tance than, as 1 have said, of near half a mile, yet as I saw it
was practicable at last, I never gave it over; and though I was
near two y ears about it, yet I never grudged my labour, in
hopes of having a boat to go oft" to sea in at last.
However, though my little periagua was finished, yet the
size of it was not at all answerable to the design which I had
in view, when I made the first; I mean of venturing over to
the terra firma, where it was above forty miles broad: accor-
dingly, the small ncss of my boat assisted to put an end to that
design, and now I thought no more of it. But as I had a boat,
my next design was to make a tour round the island. for as I
had been on the other side, in one place, crossing, as I have
already described it, over the land, so the discoveries I made
in that journey, made me very eager to see other parts of the
coast, and now I had a beat, I thought of nothing but sailing
round the island.
For this purpose, and that I might do every thing with dis-
cretion and consideration, I fitted up a little mast to my boat,
and made a sail to it out of some of the pieces of the ship's
sails, which lay in store, and of which I had a great stock by
me.
Having fitted my mast and sail, and tried the boat, I found
she would sail very well. Then I made little lockers or
boxes at either end of my boat, to put provisions, necessaries,
and ammunition, &o. into, to be kept dry, either from rain,
or the spray of the sea, and a little long hollow place I cut in
the inside of the boat, where I could lay my gun, making a
flap to hang down over it to keep it dry
1 fixed my umbrella also in a step at the stern, like a mast,
to stand over my head, and keep the heat of the sun off me,
like an awning; and thus I every now and then took a little
voyage upon the sea, but never went far out, nor far from the
little creek; but at last, being eager to view the circumference
of my little kingdom, I resolved upon my tour, and accord-
ingly I victualled my ship for the voyage, putting in two
dozen of my loaves (cakes I should rather call themj of bar-
ley bread, an earthen pot full of parched rice, a food I eat
a great deal of, a little bottle of rum, half a goat, and powder
and shot for killing more, and two large watch coats, of those
which, as I mentioned before, I had saved out of the seamen's
chests; these I took, one to lie upon, and the other to cover
me in the night.
Ii was the 6th of November, in the sixth year of my reign,
or my captivity, which you please, that I set out on this
voyage, and I found it much longer than I expected; for
though the island itself was not very large, yet when I came
L
to the east side of it, I found a great ledge of rocks lie out
above two leagues into the sea, some above water, some un-
der it; and beyond that a shoal of sand, lying dry, half a
league more, so that 1 was obliged to go a great way out to
sea to double that point.
When I first discovered them, I was going to give over my
enterprise, and come back, not knowing how far it might
oblige me to go out to sea, and, above all, doubting how I
should get back again; so I came to anchor, for I had made
me a kind of an anchor, with a piece of a broken grappling
which I got out of the ship.
Having secured my boat, I took my gun, and went on
shore, climbing upon a hill, which seemed to overlook that
point, where I saw the full extent of it, and resolved to ven-
ture.
In my viewing the sea from that hill where I stood, I per-
ceived a strong, and, indeed, a most furious current, which
ran to the east, and even came close to the point; and I took
the more notice of it, because 1 saw there might be some dan-
ger, that when I came into it, I might be carried out to sea by
the strength of it, and not be able to make the island again.
And indeed, had I not gotten first up upon this hill, I believe
It would have been so; for there was the same current on the
other side of the island, only that it set off" at a farther dis-
tance, and I saw there was a strong eddy under the shore; so
I had nothing to do but to get in out of the first current, and
I should presently be in an eddy.
I lay here, however, two days; because the wind, blowing
pretty fresh (at E S. E. and that being just contrary to the
said current), made a great breach of the sea upon the point;
so that it was not safe for me to keep too close to the shore
for the breach, nor to go too far off because of the stream.
The third day in the morning, the wind having abated
over night, the sea was calm, and I ventured; but I am a
warning-piece again to all rash and ignorant pilots; for no
sooner was I come to the point, when even 1 was not my
boat's length from the shore, but I found myself in a great
depth of water, and a current like the sluice of a mill. It
carried my boat along with it with such violence, that all I
could do, could not keep her so much as on the edge of it;
but I found it hurried me farther and farther out from the
eddy, which was on the left hand. There was no wind stir-
ring to help me, and all that I could do with my paddles sig-
nified nothing: and now I began to give mi self over for lost;
for, as the current was on both sides the island, 1 knew in a
few leagues distance they must join again, and then I was irre-
coverably gone, nor did I see any possibility of avoiding it; so
that I had no prospect before me but of perishing, not by the
sea, for that was calm enough, but of starving for hunger. I
had indeed found a tortoise on the shore, as big almost as I
could lift, and had tossed it into the boat; and I had a great
jar of fresh water, that is to say, one of my earthen pots: but
what was all this to being driven into the vast ocean, where,
to be sure, there was no shore, no main land or island, for a
thousand leagues at least?
And now I saw how easy it was for the providence of God
to make the most miserable condition that mankind could be
in, worse. Now 1 looked back upon my desolate solitary
island, as the most pleasant place in the world; and all the
happiness my heart could wish for, was to be but there again.
I stretched out my hands to it with eager wishes. * O happy
desert,' said I, ' I shall never see thee more! O miserable
creature,' said I, ' whither am I going?' Then I reproach-
ed myself with my unthankful temper, and how I had repin-
ed at my solitary condition, and now what would I give to be
on shore there again' Thus we never see the true state of
our condition, till it is illustrated to us by its contraries;
nor know how to value what we enjoy, but by the want of it.
It is scarce possible to imagine the consternation I was now
in, being driven from my beloved island (for so it appeared
to me now to be) into the wide ocean, almost two leagues,
and in the utmost despair of ever recovering it agam. Howe-
ver, I worked hard, till indeed my strength was almost ex-
hausted, and kept my boat as much to the northward, that is,
towards the side of the current which the eddy lay on, as
possibly I could. When about noon, as the sun passed the
meridian, I thought I felt a little breeze of wind in my face,
springing up from the S. S. E. This cheered my heart a little,
and especially when in about half an hour more it blew a
pretty small gentle gale. By this time I was gotten a fright-
ful distance from the island, and had the least cloud or hazy
weather intervened, I had been undone another way too; for
1 had do compass on board, and should never have known
how to have steered towards the island, if 1 had but once lost
sight of it: bat the weather continuing clear, I applied my-
self to get up my mast again, and spread my sail, standing
away to the north, as much as possible, to get oat of the cur-
rent
Just as I had set my mast and sail, and the boat began to
stretch avay. I saw, even by the clearness of the water, some
alteration of the current was near; for where the currant was
so strong, the water was foul; but perceiving the water clear,
I found the current abate, and presently I found to the east,
at about half a mile, a breach of the sea upon some rocks;
these rocks 1 found caused the current to part again, and as
the main stress of it ran away more southerly, leaving the
rocks to the north east, so the other returned by the repulse
of this rock, and made a strong eddy, which ran back again.
to the north-west, with a very sharp stream.
They who know what it is to have a reprieve brought to
them upon the ladder, or to be rescued from thieves just
going to murder them, or who have been in such-like extre-
mities, may guess what my present surprise of joy was, and
how gladly I put my boat into the stream of this eddy; and,
the wind also freshening, how gladly I spread my sail to it,
running cheerfully before the wind, and with a strong tide or
eddy under foot
This eddy carried be about a league in my way back again,
directly towards the island, but about two leagues more to-
wards the northward than the current lay, which carried me
away at first; so that when I came near the island, I found
myself open to the northern shore of it, that is to say, the
other end of the island, opposite to that which I went out
from.
When I had made something more than a league of way,
by the help of this current or eddy. I found it was spent, and
served me no farther However, I found that being between
the two gi cat currents, viz that on the south side, which had
hurried me away, and that on the north, which lay about tyvo
leagues on the other side; I say, between these two, in the
west of the island, I found the water at least still, and running
no way; and having still a breeze of wind fair for me, I kept
on steering directly for the island, though not making such
fresh way as I did before
About four o'clock in the evening, being then within about
a league of the island, I found the point of the rocks which
occasioned this disaster stretching out, as is described before,
to the southward, and casting off the current more south-
wardly, had, of course, made another eddy to the north, and
this I found very strong, but not directly setting the way my
course lay, which was due west, but almost full north. How-
ever, having a fresh gale, I stretched across this eddy, slant-
ing north-west, and in about an hour came within a mile of
the shore, where, it being smooth water, I soon got to land.
When I was on shore I fell on my knees, and gave God
thanks for my escape, resolving to lay aside all thoughts of
my deliverance by my boat; and refreshing myself with such
things as I had, I brought my boat close to the shore, m a.
little cove that I had espied under some trees, and laid me
down to slet,), being quite spent with the labour and fatigue of
the voyage.
I was now at a great loss which way to get home with my
boat. I had run so much hazard, and knew too much the
case, to think of attempting it by the way I went out; and
what might be at the other side (X mean the west side), I
knew not, nor had I any mind to run any more ventures: so
I only resolved in the morning to make my way westward
along the shore, and to see if there was no creek, where I
might lay up my frigate in safety, so as to have her again, if I
wanted her. In about three miles, or thereabouts, coasting
the shore, I came to a very good inlet, or bay, about a mile
over, which narrowed till it came to a very little rivulet or
brook, where I found a convenient harbour for my boat, and
where she lay as if she had been in a little dock made on
purpose for her: here I put in, and having stowed my boat
very safe, I went on shore to look about me, and see where
1 was.
I soon found I had but a little passed by the place where I
had been before, when I travelled on foot to that shore: so
taking nothing out of my boat, but my gun and my umbrella,
for it was exceeding hot, I began my march. The way was
comfortable enough after such a voyage as I had been upon,
and I reached my old bower in the evening, where I found
every thing standing as I left it; for I always kept it in good
order, bemg, as I said before, my country bouse.
I got over the fence, and laid me down in the shade to rest
my limbs; for 1 was very weary, and fell asleep. But judge
you, if you can, that read my story, what surprise I must be
La
in, when t was awaked out of my sleep, by a voice calling tne
by my name several times, 'Robin, Robin, Robin Crusoe!
poor Robin Crusoe! Where are you, Robin Crusoe? Where
are you? Where have you been?*
I was so dead asleep at firs., being fatigued with rowing, or
paddling as it is called. the first part of the day, and with
walking the latter part, that I did not awake thoroughly, and
dozing, between sleeping and waking, thought I dreamed
that somebody spoke to me. But as the voice continued to
repeat ' Robin Crusoe! Robin Crusoe!' at last I began to
awake more perfectly, and was at first dreadfully frighted,
and started up in the utmost consternation. But no sooner
were my eyes open, but I saw my Poll sitting on the top of
the hedge, and immediately knew that it was he that spoke to
me; for just m such bemoaning language I had used to talk to
him, and teach him; and he had learned it so perfectly, that
he would sit upon my finger, and lay his bill close to my face,
and cry, ' Poor Robin Crusoe! Where are you? Where
have you been? How came you here?' and such things as I
had taught him.
However, even though I knew it was the parrot, and that
indeed it could be nobody else, it was a good while before I
could compose myself First, I was amazed how the crea-
ture got thither, and then how he should just keep about
the place, and no where el«e. But as I was well satisfied it
could be nobody but honest Poll, I got over it; and holding
out my hand, and calling him by his name, ' Poll,' the socia-
ble creature came to me, and sat upon my thumb, as he used
to do, and continued talking to me, ' Poor Robin Crusoe!'
and how did I come here, and where had I been, just as if he
had been overjoyed to see me again; and so I carried him
home along with me.
I had now had enough of rambling to sea for some time,
and had enough to dolor many days to sit still, and reflect
upon the danger I had been in. 1 would have been very glad
to have had my boat again on my side of the island; but I
knew not how it was practicable to get it about. As to the
east side of the island, which 1 had gone round, I knew well
enough there was no venturing that way: my very heart
would shrink, and my very blood run chill, but to think of it.
And as to the other side of the island, I did not know how it
might be there; but supposing the current ran with the same
Against the shore at the east, as it passed by it on the other, I
might run the same risk of being driven down the stream, and
carried by the island, as 1 had been before of being carried
away from it; so with these thoughts I contented myself to
be without any boat, though it had been the product of so
many months' labour to make it, and of so many more to get
it into the sea.
^ In this government of my temper I remained near a year,
lived a very sedate, retired life, as you may well suppose: and
my thoughts being vi^vy much composed as to my condition,
and fully comforted in resigning myself to the dispositions of
Providence, I thought I lived really very happily in all things,
except that of society.
I improved myself in this time in all the mechanic exerci-
ses which my necessities put me upon applying myself to; and,
I believe, could, upon occasion, have made a very good car-
penter, especially considering how few tools I had.
Besides this, I arrived at an unexpected perfection in my
earthen ware, and contrived well enough to make them with
a wheel, which I found infmitely easier a id better; because I
made things round and shapeable, which before were filthy
^fengsindeed to look on. But I think I never was more vain
of my own performance, or more. joyful for any thing I found
out, than for my being able to make n tobacco-pipe; and though
it was a very ugly, clumsy thing, when it was done, and only
burnt red like other earthen ware, yet, as it was hard and
firm, and would draw the smoke, I was exceedingly comfort-
able with it; for I had been always used to smoke, and there
were pipes in the ship, but I forgot them at first, not knowing
that there was tobacco in the island; and afterwards, when I
searched the ship again, I could not come at any pipes at all.
In my wicker-ware I also improved much, and made abun-
dance of necessary baskets as well as my invention showed
me, though not very handsome, yet they were such as were
very handy and convenient for my laying things up in, or
fetching things home in. For example, If I killed a goat
abroad, I could hang it up in a tree, flay it, and dress it, and
cut it in pieces, and bring it home in a basket; and the like by
a turtle, I could cut it up, take out the eggs, and a piece or two
of the flesh, which was enough for me, and bring them home
in a basket, and leave the rest behind me. Also large deep
baskets were my receivers for my corn, which I always rub-
bed out as soon as it was dry and cured; and kept in great
baskets, instead of a granary.
1 began now to perceive my powder abated considerably,
and this was a want which it was impossible for me to supply,
and I began seriously to consider what I must do when I should
have no more powder; that is to say, how I should do to kill
any goats. I had, as I observed in the third year of my being
here, kept a young kid, and bred her up tame. 1 was in
hopes of getting a he-kid; but I could not, by any means,
bring it to pass, till my kid grew an old goat, and I could ne-
ver find in my heart to kill her, till she died at last of mere
age
But, being now in the eleventh year of my residence, and
as I have said my ammunition growing low, 1 set myself to
study some art to trap and snare the goats, to see whether I
could not catch some of them alive; and particularly I wan-
ted a she-goat great with young.
To this purpose I made snares to hamper them, and I do
believe they were more than once taken in them; hut my
tackle was not good, for I had no wire, and I always found
them broken, and my bait devoured.
At length I resolved to try a pit-fall; so I dug several large
pits in the earth, in places where I had observed the goats
used to feed, and over these pits I placed hurdles of my own
making too, with a great weight upon them; and several times
I put ears of barley and dry rice, without setting the trap,
and I could easily perceive that the goats had gone in, ami
eaten up the corn; for I could see the mark of their feet At
length, I set three traps in one night, and, going the next
morning, I found them all standing, and yet the bait eaten
and gone. This was very discouraging: however, I altered
my traps; and, not to trouble you with particulars, going one
morning to sec my traps, I found in one of them a large old
he goat, and, in one of the others, three kids; a male and two
females.
As to the old one, I knew not what to do with him: he was
so fierce 1 durst not go into the pit to him; that is to say, to
go about to bring htm away alive, which was what I wanted.
1 could have killed him, but that was not my business, nor
would it answer my end; so I even let him out, and he ran
away as if he had been flighted out of his wits; but I had for-
got then what I learned afterwards, that hunger will tame a
lion. If I had let him stay there three or four days without
food, and then have carried him some water to drink, and then
a little corn, he would have been as tame as one of the kids;
for they are mighty sagacious, tractable creatures, when they
are well used.
However, for the present I let him go, knowing no better
at that timet then I went to the three kids, and, taking them
one by one, I tied them with strings together, and with some
difficulty brought them all home.
It was a good while before they would feed; but throwing
them some sweet corn, it tempted them, and they began to
be tame. And now I found, that if I expected to supply
myself with goat-flesh, when I had no powder or shot left,
breeding some up tame was my only way, when perhaps I
might have them about my house like a flock of sheep.
But then it presently occurred to me, that I must keep the
tame from the wild, or else they would always run wild when
they grew up; and the only way for this was to have some
enclosed piece of ground, well fenced either with hedge or
pale, to keep them up so effectually, that those within might
not break out, or those without break in.
This was a great undertaking for one pair of hands; yet, as
I saw there was an absolute necessity of doing it, my first
piece of work was to find out a proper piece of ground, viz.
where there was likely to be herbage for them to eat, water
for them to drink, and cover to keep them from the sun.
Those who understand such enclosures will think I had very
little contrivance, when I pitched upon a place very proper
for all these, being a plain open piece of meadow land, or
savanna (as our people call it in the western colonies), which
had two or three little drills of fresh water in it, and at one
end was very woody; I say, they will smile at my forecast,
when I shall tell them 1 began my enclosing of this piece of
ground in such a manner, that my hedge or pale must have
been at least two miles about: nor was the madness of it so
great as to the compass; for if it was ten miles about, I was
like to have time enough to do it in; but 1 did not consider
that my goats would be as wild in so much compass, as if they
had had the whole island, and I should have so much room
to chase them in, that I should never catch them.
My hedge was begun and carried on, I believe about fifty
yards, when this thought occurred to me; so I presently stop-
peil short, and, for the first beginning, I resolved to enclose
a piece of about one hundred and fifty yards in length, and
one hundred yards in breadth, which as it would maintain as
many as I should have in any reasonable time, so, as my flock
increased, I could add more ground to my enclosure.
This was acting with some prudence, and I went to work
with courage. I was about three months hedging in the first
piece, and, till I had done it, I tethered the three kids in the
best part of it, and used them to feed as near me as possible,
to make them familiar, and very often 1 would go and carry
them some ears of barley, or a handful of rice, and feed them
out of my hand, so that, after my enclosure was finished and
I let them loose, they would follow me up and down, bleating
after me for a handful of corn.
This answered my end, and in about a year and a half I
had a flock of about twelve goats, kids and all; and in two
years more I had three-and-forty, besides several that I took
and killed for my food; and after that I enclosed five several
pieces of ground to feed them in, with little pens to drive them
into, to take them as I wanted them; and gates out of one
piece of ground into another.
Hut this was not all; for now I not only had goat's flesh to
feed on when 1 pleased, but milk too; a thing which indeed
in the beginning I did not so much as think of, and which,
when it came into my thoughts, was really an agreeable sur-
prise: for now I set up my dairy, and had sometimes a gallon
or two of milk m a day. And as nature, who gives supplies of
food to every creature, dictates even naturally how to make
use of it; so I, that never milked a cow, much less a goat, or
saw butter or cheese made, very readily and handily, though
after a great many essays and miscarriages, made me both
butter and cheese at last, and never wanted it afterwards.
How mercifully can our great Creator treat his creatures,
even in those conditions in which they seem to be over-
whelmed in destruction! How can he sweeten the bitterest
providences, and give us cause to praise him for dungeons and
prisons! What a table was here spread for me in a wilderness,
where I saw nothing at first but to perish for hunger.
It would have made a Stoic smile to have seen me and my
little family sit down to dinner. There was my majesty, the
prince and lord of the whole island. I had the lives of all my
subjects at my absolute command: I could hang, draw, give
liberty, anil take it away, and no rebels among all my sub-
jects.
Then to see how like a king I dined too, all alone, attended
by my servants! Poll, as if he had been my favourite, was the
only person permitted to talk to me: my dog, who was now
grown very old aud crazy, and had found no species to mul-
tiply his kind upon, sat always at my right hand; and two cats,
one on one side the table, and one on the other, expecting
now and then a bit from my hand, as a mark of special
favour.
But these were not the two cats which I brought on shore at
first; for thev were both of them dead, and had been interred
near my habitation by my own hands; but one of them having
multiplied by I know not what kind of creature, these were
two which I had preserved tame, whereas the rest ran wild in
the woods, and became indeed troublesome to me at last; for
they would often come into my house, and plunder me too,
till at last I was obliged to shoot them, and kill a great many;
at length they left me with this attendance. And in this plen-
tiful manner 1 lived; neither could I be said to want any thing
but society and of that, in some time alter this, 1 was like
to have too much.
I was something impatient, as I before observed, to have
the use of my boat, though very loath to run any more ha-
zards; and therefore sometimes I sat contriving ways to get
her about the island, and at other times I sat myself down
contented enough without her But I had a strange uneasiness
in my mind to go down to the point of the island, where, as
I have said, in my last ramble, I went up the hill to see how
the shore lay, and how the current set, that 1 might see what
I had to do. This inclination increased upon me every day,
and at length I resolved to travel th'ther by land; and follow-
ing the edge of the shore, I did so; but had any one in England
been to meet such a man as I was, it must have either frighted
him, or raised a great deal of laughier; and as I frequently
stood still to look at myself, I could not but smile at the notion
of my travelling through Yorkshire with such an equipage,
and in such a dress. Be pleased to take a sketch of my
figure as follows:
I had a great, high, shapeless cap, made of a goat's skin,
with a flap hanging down behind, as well to keep the sun from
me, as to ilioot the rain off from'running into my neck; nothing
being so hurtful in these climates, as the rain upon the flesh
under the clothes.
I had a short jacket of goat's skin, the sktrts coming down
to about the middle of my thighs; and a pair of open-knee'd
breeches of the same: the breeches were made of the skin of
of an old he goat, whose hair hung down such a length on ei-
ther side, that, like pantaloons, it reached to the middle of
my legs. Stockings and shoes 1 had none; hut I had made a
pair of something, I scarce know what to call them, like bus-
kins, to flap over my legs, and lace on either side like spatter-
dashes, but of a most barbarous shape, as indeed were all the
rest of my clothes.
I had on a broad belt of goat's skin dried, which I drew to-
-gether with two thongs of the same, instead of buckles; and,
in a kind of a frog, on either side of this, instead of a sword
and a dagger, hung a little saw and a hatchet, one on one side,
one on the other. I had another belt not so broad, and fast-
ened in the same manner, which hung over my shoulder; and
at the end of it, under my left arm, hung two pouches, both
made of goat's skin too: in one of which hung my powder,
in the other my shot. At my back I carried my basket, ou
my shoulder my gun, and over my head a great, clumsy, ugly,
goat-skin umbrella, but which, after all, was the most neces-
sary thing I had about me, next to my gun, As for my face,
the colour of it was really not so Mulatto like as one might
expect from a man not at all careful of It, and living within
nine or ten degrees of the eqainox. My beard I had once
suffered to grow till it was about a quarter of a yard long; but
as I hart both scissars and razors sufficient, I hail cut it pretty
Aort, except what grew on my upper lip, which I had trim-
med into a large pair of Mahometan whiskers, such as I had
seen worn by some Turks, whom I saw at Sallee; for the
Moors did not wear such, though the Turks did. Of these
mustachioes, or whiskers, I will not say they were long enough
to hang my hat upon them; but they were of a length and
shape monstrous enough, and such as in England would have
passed for frightful.
But all this is by the bye: for as to my figure, I had so few
to observe me, that it was of no manner of consequence; so 1
say no more to that part. In this kind of figure I went my
new journey, and was out five or six days. I travelled first
along the sea-shore, directly to the place where I first brought
my boat to anchor, to get up upon the rocks; and, having no
boat now to take care of, 1 went over the-land a nearer way,
to the same height that I was upon before, when looking for-
ward to the point of the rocks which lay out, and which I was
to double with my boat, as I said above, I was surprised to
see the sea all smooth and quiet: no rippling, no motion, no
current, any more there than in other places.
I was at a strange loss to understand this, and resolved to
spend some time in observing it, to see if nothing from the
sets of the tide had occasioned it. But I was presently con-
vinced how it was, viz. that the tide of ebb setting from the
west, and joining with the current of waters from some great
river on the shore, must be the occasion of this current; and
that, according as the wind blew more forcibly from the west,
or from the north, this current came near, or went farther
from the shore; for, waiting thereabouts till evening, I went
up to the rock again, and then the tide of ebb being made, I
plainly saw the current again as before, only that it ran far-
ther off, being near half a league from the shore; whereas, in
my case, it set close upon the shore, and hurried me in my
canoe along with it, which at another time it would not have
done.
This observation convinced me, that I had nothing to do
but to observe the ebbing anil flowing of the tide, and I might
very easily bring my boat about the island again: but when I
began to think of putting it in practice, I had such a terror
upon my spirits at the remembrance of the danger I had been
in, that I could not think of it again with any patience; but,
on the contrary, I took up another resolution, which was more
safe, though more laborious, and this was, that 1 would build,
or rather make me another periagua, or canoe, and so have
one for one side of the island, and one for the other.
You are to understand that now I had, as I may call it, two
plantations in the island; one, my little fortification or tent,
with the wall about it under the rock, with the cave behind
me, which, by this time I had enlarged into several apartments
or caves, one within another. One of these, which was (Jie
driest and largest, and had a door out beyond my wall or lfir-
tification, that is to say, beyond where my wall joined to the
rock. was all filled up with large earthen pots, of which I have
given an account, and with fouiteen or fifteen great baskets,
which would hold five or six bushels each, where I laid up my
M
stores of prevision, especially my corn, some in the ear cut
off short from the straw, and the other rubbed out with my
hand.
A» for my wall made, as before, with long stakes or piles,
those piles grew all like trees, and were by this time grown
so big, and spread so very much, that there was not the least
appearance, to any one's view, of any habitation behind them.
Near this dwelling of mine, but a little farther within the
land, and upon lower ground, lay my two pieces of corn-
ground, which I kept duly cultivated and sowed, and which
duly yielded me their harvest in its season; and whenever I
had occasion for more corn, I had more land adjoining as fit
as that.
Besides this, I had my country seat, and I had now a tole .
rable plantation there also. For, first, I had my little bower,
as I called it, which I kept in repair; that is to say, I kept
the hedge which circled it in, constantly fitted up to its usual
height, the ladder standing always in the inside I kept the
trees, whioh at first were no more than my stakes, but were
now grown very firm and tall I kept them always so cut, that
they might spread and grow thick and wild, and make the
more agreeable shade. which they did effectually to my mind.
In the middle of this, I had my tent always standing, being a
piece of a sail spread over poles set up for that purpose, and
which never wanted any repair or renewing; and under this I
had made mc a squab or couch, with the skins of the creatures
I had killed, and with other soft things, and a blanket laid on
them, such as belonged to our sea-bedding, which I had saved,
and a great watch-coat to cover me: and here, whenever I
had occasion to be absent from my chief seat, I took up my
country habitation-
Adjoining to this, I had my enclosures for my cattle, that
is to say, my goats: and as I had taken an inconceivable deal
of pains to fence and enclose this ground, I was so uneasy to
see it kept entire lest the goats should break through, that I
nev«r left off, till, with infinite labour, I had stuck the outside
of the hedge so full of small stakes, and so near to one ano-
ther, that it was rather a pale than a hedge, and there was
scarce room to put a hand through between them: which
afterwards, when those stakes grew, as they all did in the
next rainy season, made the enclosure strong, like a wall,
indeed stronger than any wall.
This will testify for me that I was not idle, and that I
spared no pains to bring to pass whatever appeared necessary
for my comfortable support' for I considered the keeping up
a breed of tame creatures thus at my hand, would be a living
magazine of flesh, milk, butter, and cheese, for me as long as
I lived in the place, if it were to be forty years; and that
keeping them within my reach depended entirely upon my
perfecting my enclosures to such a degree, that I might be
sure of keeping them together; which by this method indeed
I so effectually secured, that when these little stakes began
to grow, I had planted them so very thick, I was forced to
pull some of them up again.
In this place also I had my grapes growing, which I prin-
cipally depended on for my winter-store of raisins, and which
I never failed to preserve very carefully, as the best and most
agreeable dainty of my whole diet; and indeed they were not
agreeable only, but physical, wholesome, nourishing, and
refreshing to the last degree-
As this was also about half way between my other habitation
and the place where I had laid up my boat, I generally staid
and lay here in my way thither; for I used frequently to visit
my boat, and I kept all things about or belonging to her ia
very good order. Sometimes I went out in her to divert my-
self; but no more hazardous voyages would I go, nor scarce
ever above a stone's cast or two from the shore; I was so
apprehensive of being hurried out of my knowledge again by
the currents, or winds, or any other accident- But now I
come to a new scene of my life.
/ft happened one day about noon, going towards my boat,
I was exceedingly surprised with the print of a man's naked
foot on the shore, which was very plain to be seen in the sand.
I stood like one thunderstruck, or as if I had seen an appari-
tion. I listened, I looked round me; I could hear nothing,
nor see any thing. I went up to a rising ground to look far-
ther. I went up the shore, and down the shore, but it was
all one; I could see no other impression but that one I went
to it again to see if there were any more, and to observe if it
might not be my fancy; but there was no room for that, for
there was exactly the very print of a foot, toes, heel and every
part of a foot: how it came thither, 1 knew not, nor could in
the least imagine. But after innumerable fluttering thoughts,
like a man perfectly confused and out of myself, I came home.
to my fortification, not feeling, as we say, the ground I went
on, but terrified to the last ('egree, looking behind me at every
two or three steps, mistaking every bush and tree, and fan-
cying every stump at a distance to be a man. Nor is it pos-
sible to describe how many various shapes an affrighted ima-
gination represented things to me in; how many wild ideas
were formed every moment in my fancy, aud what strange
Unaccountable whimsies came into my thoughts by the way.
When I came to my castle, for so I think I called it ever
after this, I fled into it like one pursued: whether I went over
by the ladder, as first contrived, or went in at the hole in the
rock, which I called a door, 1 cannot remember; for never
frighted hare fled to cover, or fox to earth, with more terror
of mind than I to this retreat.
I had no sleep that night. The farther I was from the
occasion of my fright, the greater my apprehensions were;
which is something contrary to the nature of such things, and
especially to the usual practice of all creatures in fear. But
I was so embarrassed with my own frightful ideas of the thing,
that I formed nothing but dismal imaginations to myself, even.
though I was now a great way off it. Sometimes I fancied it
must be the devil; and reason joined in with me upon this
supposition: for how should any other thing, in human shape,
come into the place? Where was the vessel that brought
them? What marks were there of any other footsteps? And
how was it possible a man should come there? But then to
think that Satan should take human shape upon him in such a
place, where there could be uo manner of occasion for it, but
to leave the print of his foot behind him, and that even fo" no
purpose too (for he could not be sure I should see it), this
was an amazement the other way. I considered that the devil
might have found out abundance of other ways to have terri-
fied me, than this of the single print of a foot: that as I lived
quite on the other side of the island, he would never have
been so simple to leave a mark in a place where it was ten
thousand to one whether I should ever sec it or not, and in the
sand too, which the first surge of the sea, upon a high wind,
would have defaced entirely. All this seemed inconsistent
with the thing itself, and with all notions we usually entertain
of the subtilty of the devil.
Abundance of such things as these assisted to argue me out
of all apprehensions of its being the devil: and I presently
concluded then, that it must be some more dangerous crea-
ture; viz. that it must be some of the savages of the main
land over against me, who had wandered out to sea in their
canoes, and, either driven by the currents, or by contrary
winds, had made the island; anil had been on shore, but were
gone away again to sea, being as loath, perhaps, to have staid
in this desolate island, as I would have been to have had
them.
While these reflections were rolling upon my mind, I wa*
very thankful in my thoughts, that I was so happy as not to
be thereabouts at that time, or that they did not see my boat,
by which they would have concluded, that some inhabitants
had been in the place, and perhaps have searched farther for
me. Then terrible thoughts racked my imagination about
their having found my boat, and that there were people here;
and that, if so, I should certainly have them come again in
greater numbers, and devour me; that if it should happen so
that they should not find me, yet they would find my enclo-
sure, destroy all my corn, carry away all my flock of tame
goats, and I should perish at last for mere want.
Thus my fear banished all my religious hope; all that for-
mer confidence in God, which was founded upon such won-
derful experience as I had had of his goodness, now vanished;
as if he that had fed me by miracle hitherto, could not pre-
serve by hit1 power the provision which he had made for me
by his goodness. I reproached myself with my easiness, that
would not sow any more corn one year than would just serve
me till the next season, as if no accident could intervene to
prevent my enjoying the crop that was upon the ground; and
this I thought so just a reproof, that I resolved for the future
to have two or three years' corn beforehand; so that whatever
might come, I might not perish for want of bread.
How strange a checker-work of Providence is the life of
man! and by what secret different springs are the affections
hurried about, as differing circumstances present! To day we
love what to-morrow we hate: to day we seek what to-morrow
-we shun: to day we desire what to morrow we fear; nay, even
tremMe at the apprehensions of. This was exemplified in me,
at this time, in the most lively manner imaginable; for I,
whose only affliction was, that I seemed banished from human
society, that I was all alone, circumscribed by the boundlert
ocean, cut off from mankind, and condemned to what I call
M2 ,
silent life; that I was as one whom Heaven thought not worthy
to be numbered among the living, or to appear among the rest
of his creatures; that to have seen one of my own species,
would have seemed to me a raising me from death to life, and
the greatest blessing that Heaven itself, next to the supreme
blessing of salvation could bestow; I say, that I should now
tremble at the very apprehensions of seeing a man, and was
ready to sink into the ground at but the shadow, or silent
appearance of a man's having set his foot on the island.
Such is the uneven state of human life; and it afforded me
a great many curious speculations afterwards, when I had a
little recovered my first surprise. I considered that this was
the station of life, the infinitely wise and good providence of
God had determined for me; that as I could not foresee what
the ends of divine wisdom might be in all this, so I was
not to dispute his sovereignty, who, as I was his creature, had
an undoubted right, by creation, to govern and dispose of me
absolutely as he thought fit; and who, as I was a creature who
had offended him, had likewise a judicial right to condemn
me to what punishment he thought fit; and that it was my part
to submit to bear his indignation, because I had sinned against
him. ^
I then reflected that God, who was not only righteous, but
omnipotent, as he bad thought fit thus to punish and afflict
me, so he was able to deliver me; that if he did not think fit
to do it, it was my unquestioned duty to resign myself abso-
lutely and entirely to his will: and, on the other hand, it was
my duty aUo to hope in him, pray to him, and quietly to attend
the dictates and directions of his daily providence.
These thoughts took me up many hours, days, nay, I may-
say, weeks and months: and one particular effect of my cogi-
tations on this occasion, I cannot omit; viz. one morning early,
lying in my bed, and filled with thoughts about my danger
from the appearance of savages, 1 found it decomposed me
very much; upon which those words of the Scripture came
into my thoughts; ' Call upon me in the day of trouble, and
I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me.'
Upon this, rising cheerfully out of my bed, my heart was
not only comforted, but I was guided and encouraged to pray
earnestly to God for deliverance. When 1 had done praying,
I took up my Bible, and opening it to read, the first words
that presented to me were • Wait on the Lord, and be of good
cheer, and he shall strengthen thy heart; wait, I say, on the
Lord.' It is impossible to express the comfort this gave me:
and in return 1 thankfully laid down the book, and *as no
more sad, at least not on that occasion.
In the middle of these cogitations, apprehensions, and
reflections, it came into my thoughts one day, that all this
might be a mere chimera of my own, and that this foot might
be the print of my own foot, when 1 came on shore from my
boat. This cheered me up a little too, and I began to persuade
myself it was all a delusion; that it was nothing else but my
own foot; and why might not I come that way from the boat,
as well as I was going that way to the boat? Again, I consi-
dered also, that I could by no means tell for certain where I
had trod, and where I had not; and that if at last this was
only the print of my own foot, I had played the part of those
fools, who strive to make stories of spectres and apparitions,
and then are themselves frighted at them more than any body
else.
Now 1 began to take courage, and to peep abroad again;
for I had not stirred out of my castle for three days and nights,
so that I began to starve for provision, for I had little or nothing
within doors, but some barley cakes and water. Then I knew
that my goats wanted to be milked too, which usually was my
evening diversion, and the poor creatures were in great pain
and inconvenience for want of it, and indeed it almost spoiled
some of them, and almost dried up their milk.
Heartening myself therefore with the belief, that this was
nothing but the print of one of my own feet (and so I might
be truly said to start at my own shadow), I began to go abroad
again, and went to my country house to milk my Sock; but to
see with what fear I went forward, how often I looked behind
me, how I was ready, every now and then, to lay down my
basket. and run for my life, it would have made any one have
thought I was haunted with an evil conscience, or that I had
been lately most terribly frighted- and so indeed I had.
However, as I went on thus two or three days, and had
seen nothing, I began to be a little bolder, and to think there
was ready nothing in it but my own imagination; but I could
not persuade myself fully of this, till I should go down to the
shore again, and see this print of a foot, and measure it by my
own, and see if there was any similitude or fitness, that I might
be assured it was my own foot. But when I came to the place
first, it appeared evidently to me, that when I laid up my
boat, I could not possibly be on shore any where thereabouts.
Secondly, when I came to measure the mark with my own
foot, I found my foot not so large by a great deal: both these
things Slled my head with new imaginations, and gave me the
vapours again to the highest degree, so that I shook with cold,
like one in an ague, and I went home again, filled with the
belief that some man or men had been on shore there; or, in
short, that the island was inhabited, and I might be surprised
before I was aware; and what course to take for my security,
I knew not.
O what ridiculous resolutions men take, when possessed with
fear! It deprives them of the use of those means which reason
offers for their relief. The first thing I proposed to myself
was, to throw down my enclosures, and turn all my tame cattle
wild into the woods, that the enemy might not find them, and
then frequent the island in prospect of the same, or the like
booty; then the simple thing of digging up my two corn fields,
that they might not find such a grain there, and still be
prompted to frequent the island; then to demolish my bower
and tent. that they might not see any vestiges of habitation,
and be tempted to look farther, in order to find out the per-
sons mhabiting.
These were the subjects of the first night's cogitation, after
I was come home again, while the apprehensions which had
so over run my mind were fresh upon me, and my head was
full of vapours, as above. Thus fear of danger is ten thousand
times more ternfy ing than danger itself, when apparent to the
eyes; and we find the burden of anxiety greater by much, than
the evil which we are anxious about; but, which was worse
than alt this. I had not that relief in this trouble from the
resignation I used to practise, that I hoped to have. I looked,
I thought, like Saul, who complained not only that the Phi-
listines were upon him, but that God had forsaken him; for
I did not now take due ways to compose my mind, by crying
to God in my distress, and resting upon his providence, as I
had done before, for my defence and deliverance; which if I
had done. I had, at least, been more cheerfully supported
under this new surprise, and perhaps carried through it with
more resolution.
This cnfusinn of my thoughts kept me waking all night;
but, in the morning, I fell asleep, and having, by the amuse-
ment of my mind, been, as,it were, tired, and my spirits
exhausted, I slept very soundly, and awaked much better
composed than ever L had been before. And now I began to
think sedately; and, upon the utmost debate with myself, I
concluded, that this island, which was so exceeding pleasant,
fruitful, and no farther from the main land than as I had seen,
was not so entirely abandoned as I might imagine: that although
there were no stated inhabitants who lived on the spot, yet
that there might sometimes come boats off from the shore,
who either with design, or perhaps never but when they were
driven by cross winds, might come to this place: that I had
lived 6fteen years now, and had not met with the least shadow
or figure of any people before; and that if at any time they
should be driven here, it was probable they went away again
as soon as ever they could, seeing they had never thought fit
to fix there, upon any occasion, to this time; that the most I
could suggest any danger from, was, from any such casual
accidental landing of straggling people from the main; who,
as it was likely, if they were driven hither, were here against
their wills, so they made no stay here, but went off again with
all possible speed, seldom staying one night on shore, lest they
should not have the help of the tides and daylight back again;
and that therefore I had nothing to do but to consider of some
safe retreat, in case I should see any savages land upon the
spot.
Now I began sorely to repent, that I had dug my cave so
large as to bring a door through again, which door, as 1 said,
came out beyond where my fortification joined to the rock.
Upon maturely considering this, therefore. I resolved to draw
me a second fortification, in the same manner of a semicircle,
at a distance from my wall, just where I had planted a double
row of trees, about twelve years before, of which I made
mention These trees having been planted so thick before,
there. wanted but a few piles to be driven between them, that
they should be thicker and stronger, and my wall would be
soon finished.
So that I had now a double wall, and my outer wall was
thickened with pieces of timber, old cable, and every thing
I could think of to make it strong; having in it seven little
holes, about as big as I might put my aim out at I the
inside of this I thickened my wall to about ten feet thick,
continually bringing earth out of my cave, and laying it at the
foot of the wall, and walking upon it and through the seven
holes I contrived to plant the muskets, of which I took notice
that I gat seven on shore out of the ship; these, I say I
planted like my cannon, and fitted them into frames that held
them like a carriage, that so I could fire all the seven guns in
two minutes' time. This wall I was many a weary month in
finishing, and yet never thought myself safe till it was done.
When this was done, I stuck all V e ground without my
wall, for a great way every way, as full with stakes or sticks
of the osier like wood, which I found so apt to grow, as they
could well stand; insomuch that I believe I might set in near
twenty thousand of them, leaving a pretty large space between
them and my wall, that I might have room to see an enemy,
and they might have no shelter from the young trees, if they
attempted to approach my outer wall
Thus, in two years' time, X had a thick grove; and, in five
br six years' time, I had a wood before my dwelling grown so
monstrous thick and strong, that it was indeed perfectly im -
passable: and no man, of what kind soever, would ever ima-
gine.that there was any thing beyond it, much less a habitation.
As for the way I proposed to myself to go in and oat (for I
lefl no avenue), it was by setting two ladders; one to a part
of the rock whjch was low, and then broke in, and left room
to place another ladder upon that: so when the two ladders
were taken down, no man living could come down to me
without mischiefing himself; and if they had come down, they
were still on the outside of my outer wall.
Thus I took all the measures human prudence could suggest
for my own preservation. and it will be seen, at length. that
they were not altogether without just reason, though I fore-
saw nothing at that time, more than my mere fear suggested
to me.
While this was doing, I was n->t altogether careless of my
other affairs; for I had a great concern upon me'for my little
herd of goats: they were not only a present supply to me upon
every occasion, and began to be sufficient to me, without the
expense of powder and shot, but also abated the fatigue of my
burning after the wild ones; and I was loath to lose the ad-
vantage of them, and to have them all to nurse up over again.
To this purpose, after long consideration, I could think. of
hut two ways to preserve them: one was to find another con-
venient place to dig a cave under ground, and to drive them
into it every night; and the other was to enclose two or three
little bits of land, remote from one another, and as much
concealed as I could, where I might keep about half a dozen
young goats in each place, so that if any disaster happened to
the flock in general, I might be able to raise them again with
little trouble and time: and this, though it would require a
great deal of time and labour, I thought was the most rational
design.
Accordingly I spent some time to find out the most retired
parts of the island; and I pitched upon one which was as pri-
vate indeed as my heart could wish; for it was a little damp
piece of ground in the middle of the hollow and thick woods,
where, as is observed, I almost lost myself once before, en-
deavouring to come back that way from the eastern part of
the island Here I found a clear piece of land, near three acres,
so surrounded with woods, that it was almost an enclosure by
nature; at least it did not want near so much labour to make
it so, as the other pieces of ground I had worked so hard at.
1 immediately went to work with this piece of ground; and,
in less than a month's time, I had so fenced it round, that my
flock or herd, call it which you please, which were not so
wild now as at first they might be supposed to be, were well
enough secured in it So, without any farther delay, I re-
moved ten she-goats and two he-goats to this piece, and when
they were there, I continued to perfect the fence, till I had
made it as secure as the other, which, however, I did at more
leisure, and it took me up more time by a great deal.
All this labour I was at the expense of, purely from my
apprehensions on the account of the print of a man's foot
which I had seen; for as yet I never saw any human creature
come near the island; and I had now lived two years under
these uneasinesses, which indeed made my life much less
comfortable than it was before, as may well be imagined by
any who know what it is to live in the constant snare of the
fear of man: and this I must observe with grief too, that the
discomposure of my mind had too great impressions also upon
the religious part of my thoughts; for the dread and terror of
falling into the hands of savages and cannibals lay so upon my
spirits, that I seldom found myself in a due temper for appli-
cation to my Maker, at least not with the sedate calmness and
resignation of soul which I was wont to do. I rather prayed
to God a3 under great affliction and pressure of mind, sur-
rounded with danger, and in expectation every night of being
murdered and devoured before morning; and I must testify,
from my experience, that a temper of peace, thankfulness,
love, and affection, is much the more proper frame tor prayer,
than that of terror and discomposure; and that under the
dread of mischief impending, a man is no more fit for a com-
forting performance of the duty of praying to God, than he is
for repentance on a sick bed; for these discomposures affect
the mind as the others do the body; and the discomposure of
the mind must necessarily he as great a disability as that of the
body, and much greater, praying to God bcing properly an.
act of the mind, not of the body.
But to go on: after I had thus secured one part of my little
living stock, I went about the whole island, searching for ano-
ther private place, to make such another deposit; when wander-
ing more to the west point of the island than I had ever done
yet, and looking out to sea, I thought I saw a boat upon the
sea, at a great distance. I had found a perspective glass or two,
in one of the seamen's chests which 1 saved out of our ship,
but I had it not about me, and this was so remote that I could
not tell what to make of it, though I looked at it till my eyes
were not able to hold to look any longer Whether it was a
boat or not, I do not know; but as I descended from the hill,
I could see no more of it, so I gave it over; only I resolved
to go no more v. illiout a perspective glass in my pocket.
When I was come down the hill, to the end of the island,
where indeed I had never been before, I was presently con-
vinced that the seeing the print of a man's foot was not such
a strange thing in the island as I imagined; and, but that it
was a special providence that 1 was cast upon the side of the
island where the savages never came, I should easily have
known that nothing was more frequent than for the canoes
from the main, when. they happened to be a little too far out
to sea, to shoot over to that side of the island for harbour;
likewise, as they often met, and fought in their canoes, the
victors, havmg taken any prisoners, would bring them over to
this shore, where, according to their dreadful customs, being
all cannibals, they would kill and eat them. Of which here-
after.
When I was come down the hill to the shore, as I said
above, being the S. W point of the island, I was perfectly
confounded and amazed; nor is it possible for me to express
the horror of my mind, at seemg the shoiv spread with skulls,
hands. feet, and other bones of human bodies; and particu-
larly I observed a place where there had been a fire made,
and a circle dug in the earth. like a cockpit, v.-here it'is
supposed the savage "wretches had sat down to their mhumatL
feastmgs upon the bodies of their fellow creatures.
X was so astonished with the sight of these things, that X
entertained no notions of any danger to myself from it for a
long while: all my apprehensions were buried in the thoughts
of such a pitch of inhuman, hellish brutality, and the horror
of the degeneracy of human nature. which, though I had
heard of often, yet I never had so near a view of before; in
short. I turned away my face from the horrid spectacle my
stomach grew sick, and I was just at the point of fainting,
when nature discharged the disorder from my stomach. and,
having vomited with an uncommon violence, I was a little
relieved, but could not bear to stay in the place a moment^
so I got me up the hill again, with all the speed I could, and
walked on towards my own habitation.
When I came a little out ot that part of the island, I stood
still a while as amazed; and then recovering myself I looked
tip with the utmost affection of my soul, and, with a flood of
tears in my eyes, gave God thanks, that had cast my hrst lot
in a part of the world where I was distinguished from such
dreadful creatures as these; and that though I had esteemed
my present condition very miserable, had yet given me so
many comforts in it, that I had still more to give thanks for,
than to complain of; and this, above all, that I had, even in
this miserable condition, been comforted with the knowledge
of Himself. and the hope of his blessing, which was a felicity1
more than sufficiently equivalent to all the misery which I had
Buffered, or could suffer
In this frame of thankfulness, I went home to my castle,
and began to be much easier now, as to the safety of my
circumstances, than ever I was before; for 1 observed that
these wretches never came to this island in search of what;
thev could get; perhaps not seeking, not wanting, or not
expecting any thing here; and having often, no doubt, been
up in the covered woody part of it, without finding any thing
to their purpose. I knew 1 had been here now almost eighteen,
years, and never saw the least footsteps of human creature
there before; and might be here eighteen more as entirely
N
concealed as I was *iow, if I did not discover myself to theiny
which I had no manner of occasion to do; it being my only
business- to keep myself entirely concealed where I was, unless
I found a better sort of creatures than cannibals to make my-
self known to.
Yet I entertained such an abhorrence of the savage wretches
that I have been speaking of, and of the wretched inhuman
custom of 'heir devouring and eating one auother up, that t
contmued pensive and sad, and kept close within my own
circle for almost two years after this When I say my own
circle, I mean by it my three plantations, viz. my castle, niy
country seat, which I called my bower, and my enclosure in
the woods: nor did I look after this for any other use than as
an enclosure for my goats: tor the aversion which nature gave
me to these hellish wretches was such,- that 1 was as fearful
of seeing them, as of seeing the devil himself. Nor did I so
much as g© to look after my boat in all this time, but began
gather to think of making me another; for I could not think
of ever making any more attempts to bring the other boat
round the island to me, lest I should meet with some of those
creatures at sea, in which, if I had happened to have fallen
into their hands, I knew what would have been my lot.
Time, however, and the satisfaction I had that I was in no
danger of being discovered by these peX)ple, began to wear off
my uneasmess about them; and I began to live just in .the
£ame composed manner as before; only with this difference,
th«t 1 used more caution, and kept my eyes more about me
than I did before, lest I should happen to be seen by any of
tbem. and particularly I was more cautious in firing my gun,
lest any of them being on the island should happen te hear it;
and it was therefore a very good providence to me that I had
furnished myself with a tame breed of goats, that I needed
not hunt any move about the woods, or shoot at them; and
if I did catch any of them after this, it was by traps and snares,
as l had done before: so that for two years after this, I believe
1 never fired my gun once off though 1 never went out without
it; and, which was more, as I had saved three pistols out of
the ship, I always carried them out with me, or at least two
of them, sticking them in my goat-skin belt: 1 likewise fur-
bished up one of the great cutlasses that ' had out of the ship,
ar.d made me a belt to put it on also; so that I was now a
aost formidable fellow to look at, when 1 went abroad, if yot*
add to the former description of myself the particular of two
pistols, and a great broad sword, hanging at my side in a belt,
but without a scabbard. i
Things going on thus, as I have said, for some time, I
6eemed, excepting these cautions, to be reduced to my former
calm, sedate way of living. Ml these things tended to showing
me, more and more, how far my condition was from being
miserable, compared to some others, nay, to manv other
particulars of life, which it might have pleased God to have
made my lot. It put me upon reflecting how little repinmg
there would be among mankind, at any condition of life, if
people would rather compare their condition with those that
are worse, In order to be thankful, than be always comparmg
them with those which are better, to assist their murmuring*
and complainings.
As in my present condition there were not really many
things which I wanted, so indeed I thought that the frights
X had been in about these savage wretches, ami the concern.
I had been in for my own preservation, had taken off the
edge of my invention for my own conveniences; and 1 bad
dropped a good design, which I had once bent.my thoughts
upon, and that was, to try if I could not make some of my
barley into malt, and then try to brew myself some beer.
This was really a whimsical thought, au-J I reproved myself
often for the simplicity of it; for I presently saw there would!
be the want of several things necessary to the making my beer
that it would be impossible for me to supply: as, first, casks
to preserve it in, which was a thing that. as I have observed
already, I could never compass;'no, though I spent not many
days, but weeks, nay, months, in attempting it, but to no
purpose. In the next place, I had no hops to make it keep,
no yeast to make it work, no copper or kettle to make it boil;
and yet, had not all these things intervened, I mean the frights
and terrors I was in about the savages, I had undertaken it,
and perhaps brought it to pass too; for I seldom gave any
thing over without accomplishing it, when 1 once had it in.
my head enough to begin it. ,.-.
But my Invention now ran quite another way; for night and
day I could think of nothing but how I might destroy some of
these monsters in their cruel bloody entertainment, and, if
possible, save the victim they should bring hither to des/roy*
jt would take up a larger volume than this whole work. H
intended to be, to set down all the contrivances I hatched, or
rather brooded upon, in m> thoughts, tor the destroying these
creatures, .or at least frighting ihem, so as to prevent their
coming hither any more; but all whs abortive, nothmg could
be possible to take effect, unless I was to be there to do it
toy bell': and what could one man do among them, when per-
haps there might be twenty or thirtv of them together, with
their darts. or their bows and arrows, with which they could
shoot as true to a mark, as I could with my gun?
, Some times 1 contrived to dig a hole under the place where
they made their fire, and put in five or six pounds t,f gun-
powder, which, when they kindled their fire, would conse-
quently take fire, and blow up all that was near it. But as,
in the first place, I should be very loath to waste so much
powder upon them, my btOVe bemg imw within the quantity
of one barrel. so neither could I he sure of its going oft-, at
any certain time, when it might surprise ihem, and at best
that it would do little more than just blow the fire about their
ears, and fright them, but not sufficient to make them forsake
the place; so I laid it aside, and then proposed that I would
place myself m ambush, m some convenient place, with my
three guns, all double loaded, and, in the middle of their
bloody ceremony, let fly at them, when. I should be sure to
-kill or wound perhaps two or three at every shot, and then
falling in upon them with my three pistols, and my sword,
1 made no doubt but that if there were twenty I should kill
them all. This fancy pleased my thoughts for some weeks,
an- 1 was so full of it that I often dreamt of it, and sometimes
thai I was just going to let fly at them in my sleep
I went so far with it in my imagination, that t employed
m> M;lf several days to find out proper places to put myself in
ambu-cade, as I said, to watch for them. and I went fre-
quently to the place itself, winch was now grown more fami-
liar to me and especially while my mind was thus filled with
thoughts of revenge, and of a bloody putting twenty or thirty
of them to the sword, as I may call it. but the horror I had
at the place. and at the- signals of the barbarous wretches
devouring one another, abated my malice
W ell. at length 1 found a place in the side of the hill, where
I was satisfied 1 might securely wait till I saw any of their
boat« coming, and might then, even before they "would be
i-'judy to come on ahore, convey myself unseen into thicket*
of the frees, in one of which there was a hollow large enough
to conceal me entirely, and where I might sit. and observe all
their bloody doings, and take my full aim at their heads, when
they were so close together as that it would be next to impos-
sible that I should miss my shot, or tnat I could fail wounding
three or four of them at the first shot.
In this place then I resolved to fix my design, and accord-
ingly I prepared two muskets, and my ordinary fowling-piece.
The two muskets I loaded with a brace of slugs each, and four
or fire smaller bullets, about the size of pistol bullets; and the
fowling-piece I loaded with nearaliandl'd of swan-shot, of the
largest size. I also loaded my pistols with about four bullets
each: and irt this posture, well provided with ammunition for
a second and third charge, I prepared myself for my expe*
dttion.
(-After I had thus laid the scheme for my design, and, in mf
imagination, put it in practice, I continually made my tour
every morning up to the top of the hill, which was from my
castle, as I called it, about three miles, or more, to see if I
could observe any boats upon the sea, coming near the island,
or standing over towards it; but I began to tire of this hard
duty, after I had for two or three months constantly kept my
watch, and come always back without any discovery, there
having not in all that time been the least appearance, not only
on or near the shore, but not on the whole ocean, so far as
my eyes or glasses could reach every way
As long as I kept up my daily tour to the hill to look out,
so long also I kept up the vigour of my desigu. and my spirits
seemed to be all the while in a suitable frame, for so outrage-
ous an execution as the killing twenty or thirty naked savages
for an offence whioh I had not at all entered into a discussioa
of in my thoughts, any further than my passions were at first
fired by the horror I conceived at the unnatural custom ol the
people of that country; who, it seems, had been suffered by
Providence, in his wise disposition of the world, to have no
other guide than that of their own abominable and vitiated!
passions; and consequently were left, and perhaps had been.
so for some ages, to act such horrid things, and receive suchi
dreadful customs, as nothing but nature, entirely abandoned
of Heaven, and actuated by some hellish degeneracy could
have run them into But now, when, as I have said, I began.
Iq be weary of the fruitless excursion which I had made-so
N3
long, and so far, every morning in vain, so my opinion of the
action itself began to alter, and I began, with cooler and
calmer thoughts, to consider what it was I was gomg to en-
gage in; what anthority or call I had, to pretend to be judge
and executioner npon these men as criminals, whom Heaven
had thought fit, for so many ages, to suffer, unpunished, to go
on, and to be, as it were, the executioners of his judgments
upon one another; also how far these people were offenders
against me, and what light I had to engage in the quarrel of
that blood, which they shed promiscuously one upon another.
I debated this very often with myself thus: How do I know
-what God himself judges in this particular case? It is certain
these people do not commit this as a crime: it is not against
their own consciences reproving, or their light reproaching
them. They do not know it to be an offence, and then com-
mit it in defiance of divine justice, as we do in almost all the
sins we commit. They think it no more a crime to kill a
captive taken in war. than we do to kill an ox; nor to eat
human flesh, than we do to eat mutton.
When I had considered this a Utile, it followed necessarily
rlhat I was certainly in the wrong i.i it; that these people were
not murderers in the sense that I had before condemned them
in my thoughts, any more than those Christians weVe mur-
derers who often put to death the prisoners taken in battle,
or more frequently, upon many occasions, put whole troopsj
of men to the sword, without giving quarter, though they
threw down their arms, and submitted.
In the next place it occurred to me, that albeit the usage
they gave one another was thus brutish and inhuman, yet it
-was really nothing to me; that these people had done me no
injury; that if they attempted me, or I saw it necessary for
my immediate preservation to fall upon them, something
might be said for it; but that I was yet out of their power,
and thev had really no knowledge of me, and consequently
no desgn upon me; and therefore it could not be just for me
to fall upon them: that this would justify the conduct of the
Spaniards, in all their barbarities practised in Amerca, where
they destroyed millions of these people, who, however they
were idolaters and barbarians, and had several bloody and
barbarous rites in their customs, such as sacrificing human
.bod is to their idols, were yet, as to the Spaniards, very
Ujnqcent people; and that the "rooting them. out of the country
)a spoken of with the utmost abhorrence and detestation, even
b* the Spaniards themselves, at this time, and by all other
Christian nations' of Europe, as a mere butchery, and a
bloody and unnatural Ijiece of cruelty, unjustifiable either to
God or man; and such' as for which the very name of a
Spaniard is reckoned to be frightful and terrible to all people
of humanity, or of Christian compassion; as if the kingdom
of Spain were particularly eminent for the product of a race
of men who were without principles of tenderness, or the
common bowels of pity to the miserable, which is reckoned
to be a mark of generous temper in the mind.
These considerations really put me to a pause, and to a kind
of full stop and I began, by little and little, to be off my
design, and to conclude I bad taken wroug measures in my
resolutions to attack the savages; that it was not my business
to meddle with them,' unless they first attacked me, and this
it was my business, if possible, to prevent; but that if 1 were
discovered, atid attacked, then I knew my duty.
On the other hand, I argued with myself that this really
was the way not to deliver myself, but entirely to ruin and
destroy myself; for unless I was sure to kill every one that
not only should be on shore at that time, hut that should ever
come on shore afterwards, if but one of them escaped to tell
their country people what had happened, they would come
over again, by thousands, to revenge the death of their fellows;
and I should only bring upon myself a certain destruction,
which at present I had no manner of occasion for.
Upon the whole, 1 concluded that neither in principles nor
in policy 1 ought, one way or other, to concern myself in this
affair. that my business was, by all possible means, to conceal
myself from them,' and not to leave the least signal to them;
to gue^s bv that there were any living creatures upon the
island; 1 mean of human shape.
Religion joined in with this prudential resolution; and I was
convinced now many ways, that I was perfectly out oi my
duty, when I was laying all my bloody schemes for the de-
struction of innocent creatures; I mean innocent as to me. Aft
to the crimes they were guilty of towards one another, I had
nothing to do with them: they were national, and I ought to
leave them to the justice of God, who is the governor of na-
tions. and knows how to bring public judgments upon those
who offend in a public manner, by such ways as best please hiplc
This appeared so clear to me.nov, that nothing was a
greater satisfaction to me than that I had not been suffered to
do a thing which I now saw so much reason to believe would
have been no less a sin, than that of wilful murder, if I bad
committed it; and I gave most hunble thanks on my knees
to God, that had thus delivered me from blood-guiltiness,
beseeching him to grant me the protection of his providence,
that I might not fall into the hands of barbarians, or that I
might not lay my hands upon them, unless 1 had a more clear
call from Heaven to do it, in defence of my own life.
In this disposition I continued for near a year after this; and
so far was I from desiring an occasion for falling upon these
wretches, that in all that time I never once went up the hill
to see whether there were any of them in sight, or to know
whether any of them had been on shore there or not, that I
might not be tempted to renew any of my contrivances against
them, or be provoked by any advantage which might present
itself to fall upon them; only this I did, 1 went and removed
my boat, which 1 had on the other side of the island, and
carried it down to the east end of the whole island, where I
ran it into a little cove, which I found under some high rocks,
and where I knew, by reason of the currents, the savages
durst not, at least would not, come with their boats, upon
any account whatsoever.
With my boat, I carried away every thing that I had left
there belonging to her, though not necessary for the bare go-
ing thither, viz. a mast and sail, which I had made for her,
and a thing like an anchor, but indeed which could not be
called either anchor or grappling: however, it was the best I
could make of its kind. All these I removed, that there
.might not be the least shadow of any discovery, or any ap-
pearance of any boat, or of any human habitation upon the
island.
Besides this, I kept myself, as I said, more retired than
ever, and seldom went from my cell, other than upon rr.y
constant employment, viz. to milk my she goats, and manage
my little flock in the wood, which as it was on the other part
of the island, was quite out of danger; for certain it is, that
these savage people, who sometimes haunted this island, never
came with any thoughts of finding any thing here, and conse-
quently never wandered off from the coast; anil I doubt not,
hut they might have been several times on shore, after toy
apprehensions of them had made me cautious* as well as
before: and indeed I looked back with some horror upon the
thoughts of what my condition would have been if I had
chopped upon them, and been discovered before thft, when
naked ond unarmed, except with one gun, and that loaded
often only with small shot. I walked every where peeping
and peering about the island, to see what I could get: what
a surprise should I have been in, if, when I discovered the
print of a man's foot, I had, instead of that seen fifteen or
twenty savages, and found them pursufng me, and, by the
swiftness of their running, no possibility of my escaping them!
The thoughts of this sometimes sunk my very soul within
me, and distressed my mind so much that I could not soon
recover it; to think what I should have done, and how I not
only should not have been able to resist them, but even should
not have had presence of mind enough to do what I might have
done, much less what now, after so much consideration and
preparation, I might be able to do Indeed, after serious
thinking of these things, I would be very melancholy, and
sometimes it would last a great while; but I resolved it at last
all into thankfulness to that Providence which had delivered
me from so many unseen dangers, and had kept me from
tli sc misclnets, which I could no way have been the agent in
delivering myself from: because I hail not the least notion of
any such thing depending, or the least supposition of its being
possible.
This renewed a contemplation which often had come to
my thoughts in former time, when first 1 began to see the
mereiful dispositions of Heaven, in the dangers w< run through
in this life: how wonderfully we are delivered, when we know
nothing of it: how.when we are in (a quandary, as we call it)
a doubt or hesitation, whether to go this way, or that way, a
secret hint should direct us this way, when we intended to go
that way; nay, when sense, our own inclination, and perhaps
business, has called to go the other way, yet a strange impres-
sion upon the mind, from we know not what springs, and by
we know not what power, shall over-rule us to go this way;
and it shall afterwards appear, that had we gone that way
which we would have gone, and even to our imagination
ought to have gone, we should have been ruined and lost.
Upo< these, and many like reflections, I afterwards made it
a certain rule with me, that whenever I found those secret
hints, or pressings of my mind, to doing or not doing any
thing that presented, or to going this way or that way, I never
failed to obey the secret dictate, though I knew no other rea-
son for it, than that such a pressure or such a hint, hung upon
my mind. I could give many examples of the success of this
conduct, in the course of my life; but more especially in the
Tatter part of my inhabiting this unhappy island: besides many
occasions which it is very likely I might have taken notice of,
if I had seen with the same eyes then, that I saw with now.
But it is never too late to be wise; and I cannot but advise all
considering men, whose lives are attended with such extraor-
dinary incidents as mine, or even though not so extraordinary,
not to slight such secret intimations of Providence, let them
come from what invisible intelligence they will, that I shall
not discuss, and perhaps cannot account for; but certainly they
are a proof of the converse of spirits, and the secret commu-
nication between those unbodied, and those unimbodied, and
such a proof as can never be withstood: of which I shall have
occasion to give some very remarkable instances in the re-
mainder of my solitary residence in this dismal place.
I believe the reader of this will not think it strange if I con-
fess that these anxieties, these constant dangers I lived in,
and the concern that was now upon me, put an end to all in-
vention, and to all the contrivances that 1 had laid for my fu-
ture accommodations and conveniences. I had the care of
my safety more now upon my hands, than that of my food.
I cared not to drive a nail, or chop.a stick of wood now, for
fear the noise I should make should be heard, much less would
I fire » gun for the same reason; and above all I was very uneasy
at making any lire, lest the smoke, which is visible at a jreat
distance in the day, should betray me; and for this reason I re-
moved that part of my business which required fire, such as
burning of pots and pipes, &c. into my new apartment in the
woods, where, after I had been some time, I found, to my un-
speakable consolation, a mere natural cave in the earth, which
went in a vast way, and where, I dare say, no savage, had he
been at the mouth of it, would be so hardy as to ven-
ture in; nor indeed would any man else, but one who, like me,
wanted nothing so much as a safe retreat.
The mouth of this hollow was at the bottom of a great rock,
where, by mere accident (I would say, if I did not see abun-
dant reason to ascribe all such things how to Providence), t
was cutting down some thick branches of trees, to make char-
coal; and before I go so, I must observe the reason of my
making this charcoal, which was this:
I was afraid of making a smoke about my habitation, as I
said before; and yet I could not live there without baking my
bread, Cooking my meat, &c; so I contrived to burn some
wood here, as I had seen done in England under turf, till it
became chark, or dry coal; and then putting the fire out, I
preserved the coal to carry home, and perform the other ser-
vices which fire was wanting for at home, without danger
of smoke.
But this by the bye, while I was cutting down some wood
here, I perceived that, behind a very thick branch of low
brushwood, or underwood, there was a kind of hollow place. I
was carious to look into it, and getting with difficulty into the
mouth of it, I found it was pretty large, that isto say, sufficient
for me to stand upright in it, and perhaps another with me; but
I must confess to you, I made more haste out than I did in,
when looking further into the place, which was perfectly
dark, I saw two broad shining eyes of some creature, whether
devil or man I knew not, which twinkled like two stars; the
dim light from the cave's mouth shining directly in, and mak-
ing the reflexion.
However, after some pause, I recovered myself, and began
to call myself a thousand fools, and tell myself, that he that
was afraid to see the devil, was not fit to live twenty years in
an island all alone, and that I durst to believe there was no-
thing in this cave that was more frightful than myself. Upon
this, plucking up my courage, I took up a great fire brand, and
in I rushed again,with the stick flaming in my hand. I had
not gone three steps in, but I was almost as much frightened
as I was before; for I heard a very loud sigh, like that of a
man in some pain, and it was followed by a broken noise, as if
of words half expressed, and then a deep sigh again. I step-
ped back, and was indeed struck with such a surprise, that it
put me into a cold sweat; and if I had had a hat on my head,
I will not answer for it, that my hair might not have lifted it
off. But still pluckmg up my spirits as well as I could, and
encouraging myself a little, with considering that the power
and presence of God was every where, and was able to pro-
tect me, I stepped forward again, and, by the light of the fire-
brand, holding it up a little over my head, I saw, lying on the
ground, a most monstrous frightful old he-goat, just making;
his will, as we say, gasping for life, and dying indeed of mere
old age
I stirred him a little, to see if I could get him out, aud he es-
sayed to get up, but was not able to raise himself: and I thought
with myself he might even lie there; for if he had frightened
me so, he would certainly fright any of the savages, if any of
them should be so hardy as to come in there, while he had
any life in him.
I was now recovered from my surprise, and began to look
round me, when I found the cave was bill very small; that is
to say, it might be about twelve feet over, but in no manner
of shape either round or square, no hands having ever been.
employed in making it except those of mere uature. I ob-
served also, that there was a place at the farthest side of it,
that went in farther, but was so low that it required me to
creep upon my hands and knees to go into it, and whither it
went, I knew not; so having no candle, I gave it over for some
time, hut resolved to come again the next day, provided with
candles and a timterbox, which I had made of the lock of
one of the muskets, with some wildfire in the pan
Accordingly, the next day, I came provided with six large
candles of my own making, for I made very good candles now
of goal's tallow: and, going into this low place, 1 was obliged
to creep upon all fours, as I have said. almost ten yards, which,
by the way, I thought was a venture bold enough, consider-
ing that I knew not how far it might go, or what was beyond
it. When I was got through the strait, I found the roof rose
higher up, I believe near twenty feet; but never was such a
glorious sight seen in the island, I dare say, as it was, to look
round the sii'es and roof of this vault or cave The walls re-
flected a hundred thousand lights to me from my two candles:
what it was in the rock, whether diamonds, or any other pre-
cious stones, or gold, which I rather supposed it to be, I knew
not.
The place I was in, was a most delightful cavity, or grotto,
of its kind, as could be expected (hough perfectly dark: the
floor was dry and level, and had a sort of small loose gravel
upon it, so that there was no nauseous or venemous creature,
to be seen; neither was there any damp or wet on the sides
or roof. The only difficulty in it was the entrance, wliich,
however, as it was a place of security, and such a retreat as I
-
Ths Old G oat ijv theGrotto
iranted, I thought that was a convenience; so that 1 was real-
ly rejoiced at the discovery, and resolved, without any delay,
to bring some of those things which I was most anxious about
to this place; particularly I resolved to bring hither my maga-
zine of powder, and all my spare arms, viz. two fowling pie-
ces (for I had three in all), aud three muskets for of them I
had eight in all; so I kept at my castle only live, which stood
ready mounted, like pieces of cannon, on my outmost fence,
and were ready also to take out upon any expedition.
Upon this occasion of removing my ammunition, I was
obliged to open the barrel of powder which I tookup out of the
sea and which had been wet; and I found that the water had
penetrated about three or four inches into the powder on
every side, which, caking and growmg hard, had preserved
the inside like a kernel in a shell, so that I had near sixty
pounds of very good powder in the centre of the cask; and
this was an agreeable discovery to me at that time: so I
carried all away thither, never keeping above two or three
pounds of powder with me in my castle, for fear of surprise of
any kind. I also carried thitherall thelead (had left for bullets.
I fancied myself now like one of the ancient giants, which
-were said to live in caves and holes in the rocks, where none
could come at them; fori persuaded myself, while I was here,
if five hundred savages were to hunt me, they could never
find me out; or if they did, they would not venture to attack
me here.
The old goat whom I found expiring, died in the mouth of
the cave, the next day after 1 made this discovery; and I found
it much easier to dig a great hole there and throw him in,
and cover him with earth, than to drag him out, so I interred
him there, to prevent offence to my nose.
I was now in my twenty-third year of residence in this
island, and was so naturalized to the place, and to the man-
ner of living that could I have but enjoyed the certainty that no
•avages would come to the place to disturb me, I could have
been content to have capitulated for spending the rest of
my time there, even to the last moment, till I had laid me
down and died, like the old goat in the cave. I had also ar-
rived to some little diversions and amusements, which made
the time pass more pleasantly with mc a great deal than it
did before; as, first, I had taught my Poll as I noted before, to
(peak, and he did It so familiarlv, and talked so articulately
O '
and plain, that it was very pleasant to me; and he lived wifii,
pie no less than six and tweDty years. How long he might
live afterwards I know not; though I know they have a notion,
in the Brasils, that they live a hundred years. Perhaps poor
Poll may be alive there still, calling after' poor Iiobin Crusoe*
to this day. I wish no Englishman the ill luck to come there
and hear him; but if he did, he would certainly believe it
was the devil. My dog was a very pleasant and loving
companion to me for no less than sixteen years of my time,
and then died of mere old age. As for my cats, they multi-
plied, as I have observed, to that degree, that I was obliged
to shoot several of them at first to keep them from devouring
me, and all I had; but at length when the two old ones I
brought with me were gone, and after sometime continually
driving them from me, and letting them have no provision
with me, they all ran wild into the woods, except two oc
three favourites, which I kept tame, and whose young, whea
they had any, I always drowned; and these were part of my
family. Besides these, I always kept two or three household
kids about me which I taught to feed out of my hand; and 1
had some more parrots, which talked pretty well; and would
all call • Robin Crusoe," but none like my first; nor, indeed,
did I take the pains with any of them that I had done with
him. I had also several tame sea fowls, whose names I know
uot, which I caught upon the shore, and cut their wings; and
the little stakes, which I had planted before my castle wall,
being now grown up to a good thick grove, these fowls all
lived among these low trees, and bred there, which was very
agreeable to me; so that, as I said above, I began to be very
well contented with the life I led, if it might but have been
secured from the dread of the savages.
But it was otherwise directed; and it may not lie amiss for
all people who shall meet with my story, to make this just
observation from it; viz. how frequently, in the course of our
lives, the evil, which in itself we seek most to shun, and
which, when we are fallen into, is the most dreadful to us, ist
oftentimes the very means or door of our deliverance, by
which alone we can be raised again from the affliction we arc
falling into. I could give many examples of this in the course
of my unaccountable life; hut In nothing was it more particu-
larly remarkable than in the circumstances of the last vest's
of my solitary residence in this island.
It was now in the month of December, as I said above, in
my twenty-third year; and this being the southern solstice,
for winter I cannot call it, was the particular time of my har-
vest, and required my being pretty much abroad in the fields;
when going out pretty early in the morning, even before it
was thorough day light, I was surprised with seeing a light of
snnic fire upon the shore, at a distance from me of about two
miles, towards the end of the island where I had observed
some savages had been, as before) but not on the other side,
tut to my great affliction, it was on my side of the island.
I was indeed terribly surprised at the sight, and stopped
short within my grove, not daring to go out, lest I might be
surprised; and yet I had no more peace within from the ap-
prehensions I had that if these savages in rambling over the
bland, should find my torn standing, or cut, or any of my
Works and improvements, they would immediately conclude,
that there were people in the place, and would then never
give over till they found me out. In this extremity I went
back directly to my castle, pulled up the ladder after me,
having made all things without look as wild and natural as I
eould.
Then I prepared myself within, putting myself in a pos-
tare of defence. I loaded all my cannon, as I called them,
that is to say my muskets, which were mounted upon my new
fortification, and all my pistols, and resolved to defend myself
to the last gasp; not forgetting seriously to recommend my-
self to the Divine Protection, and earnestly to pray to God to
deliver me out of the hands of the barbarians; and in this pos-
ture I continued about two hours, but began to be mighty im-
patient fur intelligence abroad, for I had no spies to send out.
After sitting awhile longer, and musing what I should do
in this case, 1 was not able to bear sitting in ignorance longer;
so setting up my ladder to the side of the hill, where there
was a flat place, as I observed before, and then pulling the
ladder up after me, I set it up again and so mounted to the top
of the hill; and pulling out my perspective glass, which I had
taken on purpose, I laid me down flat on my belly on the
ground, and began to look for the place. I presently found
there were no less than nine naked savages sitting round a
small fire they had made; not to warm them, for they had
no need of that, the weather being extreme hot, but, as I sup-
posed, to dress some of their barbarous diet of human flesh,
which they had brought with them, -whether alive or dead,
I could not know;
They had two canoes -with them, -which they had hauled up
upon the shore; and as it was then tide of ebb, they seemed
to me to wait the return of the flood to go away again. It
is not easy to imagine what confusion this sight put me into,
especially seeing them come on my side of the island, and so
near me too; but when I observed their coming must be al-
ways with the current of the ebb, I began afterwards to be
more sedate in my mind,'being satisfied that I might go
abroad with safety, all the time of tide of flood, if they were
not on shore before; and having made this observation I went
abroad about my harvest-work with the more composure.
As I expected, so it proved; for as soon as the tide made to
the westward, I saw them all take boat and row (or paddle,
as we call it) all away. I should have observed, that for an
hour and more before they went off, they went to dancing,
and I could easily discern their postures and gestures by my
glasses: I could not perceive, by my nicest observation, but
that they were stark naked, and had not the least cover-
ing upon them; hut whether they were men or women, that
I could not distinguish.
As soon as I saw them shipped and gone, I took two guns
upon my shoulders, and two pistols at my girdle, and my
great sword by my side, without a scabbard, and with all the
speed I was able to make, I went away to the hill, where I
had discovered the first appearance of all. As soon as I got
thither, which was not less than two hours (for I could not
go apace being so loaden with arms as I was), I perceived
there had been three canoes more of savages on that place;
and looking out further, I saw they were all at sea together
making over for the main.
This was a dreadful sight to me; especially when going
down to the shore, I could see the marks of horror which the
dismal work they had been about had left behind it, viz. the
blood, the bones, and part of the flesh of human bodies, eaten
and devoured by those wretches with merriment and sport.
I was so filled with indignation at the sight, that I began now
10 premeditate the destruction of the next that I saw there,
let them be who or how many soever.
It seemed evident to me, that the visits which they thus
made to this islaud, were not very frequent; for it was above
fifteen months before any more of them came on shore there
again; that is to say, I never saw them, or any footsteps or
signals of them, in all that time: for, as to the rainy seasons,
then they are sure not to come abroad, at least not so fari yet
all this while I lived uncomfortably, by reason of the constant
apprehensions I was in of their comirfg upon me by surprise:
from whence I observe, that the expectation of evil is more
bitter than the suffering, especially if there is no room to
shake off that expectation, or those apprehensions.
During all this time, I was in a murdering humour; and took
np most of my hours, which should have been better employed,
in contriving how to circumvent and fall upon them the very
next time I should see them, especially if they should be
divided, as they were the last time, into two parties: nor did
I consider at all, that if I killed one party, suppose ten or a
clnzen, I was still the next day, or week, or month, to kill
another, even ad infinitum, till I should be at length no less
a murderer than they were in being man eaters, aud perhaps
much more so.
I spent my days now in great perplexity and anxiety of
mind, expecting that I should one day or other fall into the
hands of these merciless creatures. If I did at any time ven-
ture abroad, it was not without looking round me with the
greatest care and caution imaginable; and now 1 found, to my
great comfort, how happy it was that I had provided a tame
ilock or herd of goats; for J durst not, upon any account,
lire my gun, especially near that side of the island where
they usually came, lest 1 should alarm the savages; audit-
'hey had lied from me now, I was sure to have them come
back again, with perhaps two or three hundred canoes with
them in a few days, and then 1 knew what to expect.
However, I wore out a year and three months more, be-
fore I ever saw any more of the savages; and then I found
them~again, as I shall soon observe. It is true they might
have been there once or twice; but either they made no stay,
or at least I did not hear them: but in the month of May, as
near as I could calculate, and in my four-and-twentieth year,
I had a very strange encounter with them, of which in its
place.
The perturbation of my mind during this fifteen or sixteen
months' interval, was very great I slept unquiet, dreamed
always frightful dreams, and often started put of my sleep in
0 3
the night: in the Jay great troubles overwhelmed my mind;
in the night I dreamed often of killing savages, and the rea-
sons why I might justify the doing of it. But, to wave all
this for a while, it was in the middle of May, on the sixteenth
day, I think, as well as my poor wooden calender would reck-
on; for I marked all upon the post still: I nay, it was on the
sixteenth of May, that it blew a very great storm of wind alt
day, with a great deal of lightning aud thunder, and a very
foul night was after it. 1 know not what was the particular
occasion of it, but as I was reading in the Bible, and taken up
with serious thoughts about my present condition, I was sur-
prised with the noise of a gun, as I thought fired at sea.
This was, to be sure, a surprise of a quite different nature
from any I had met mifh before; for the notions this put
into my thoughts were quite of another kind. I started up in
the greatest haste imaginable; and, in a trice, clapped up my
ladder to the middle place of the rock, and pulled it after me,
and, mounting it the second time, got to the top of the hill:
that very moment a flash of fire bade me listen for a second
gun, which accordingly, in about half a minute, I heard; and
by the sound knew that it was from that part of the sea where
1 was driven out wilh the current in my boat
I immediately considered, that this must be some ship in dis-
tress, and that they had some comrade, or some other ship
in company, and fired these guns for signals of distress, and
to obtain help. I had this presence of mind at that mmute,
as to think that though I could not help tlicm, it may be they
might help me; so I brought together all the dry wood I conl«l
get at hand, aud making a good handsome pile, I set it on fire
opon the hill. The wood was dry, aud blazed freeiy; and
though the wind blew very hard, yet it burnt fairly out, ao
th-it I was certain, if there was any such thing as a ship, they
must needs see it, and no doubt they did; for as soon as ever
my fire blazed up, I heard another gun, aud after that seve-
ral others, all from the same quarter. I plied my fire all night
long, till day broke; and when it was broad day, and the air
cleared up, I saw something at a great distance at sea, fu'.l
east of the island, whether a sail, or a hull, I could not distin-
guish; no, not with my glasses, the distance was so great, and
the weather still something hazy also; at least it was so out at
sea.
I looked frequently at it all that day, and soon pcrceiveu' tiA\
it did not move; so I presently concluded that it was a ship
at anchor; and being eager, you may be sine, to be satisfied,
I took my gun in my hand, and ran towards the south-east
side of the island, to the rocks where I had been formerly
carried away with the current; and getting up there, the
-weather by this time being perfectly clear, I could plainly see,
to my great sorrow, the wreck of a ship cast away in the night
upon those concealed rocks, which I found when I was out in
my boat; and which rocks, as they checked the violence of the
stream, and made a kind of counter-stream, or eddy, were
the occasion of my recovering then from the most desperate,
hopeless condition that ever'I had been in, all my life
Thus, what is one man's safety is another man's destruc-
tion; for it seems these men, whoever they were, being out
of their knowledge, and the rocks being wholly under water,
had been driven upon them in the night, the wind blowing
hard at E. and E. N. E. Had they seen the island, as I must
necessarily suppose they did not, they must, as I thought,
have endeavoured to have saved themselves on shore by the.
help of their boat; but their firing of their guns for help, espe-
cially when they saw, as 1 imagined, my fiVe, filled me with
many thoughts. First.I imagined that, upon seeing my light,
they might have put themselves into their boat, and have en-
deavoured to make the shore; but that the sea going very
high, they might have been caBt away. Other times I ima-
gined that they might have lost their boat before, as might
be the case many ways; as particularly by the breaking of the
sea upon their ship, which many times obliges men to stave,
or take in pieces their boat; and sometimes to throw it over-
board with their own hands Other times I imagined they
had some other ship or ships in company, who, upon the sig-
nals of distress they had made, had taken them up, and car-
ried them off". Other while? I fancied they were all gone off
to sea in their bottf, and, being hurried away by the current
that I had been formerly in, were carried out into the great
ocean, where there was nothing but misery and perishing; and
that perhaps they might, by this time, think of starving, and
of being in a condition to eat one another.
As all these were hut conjectures at best, so, in the condi-
tion I was in, I oould do no more than look upon the misery
of the poor men, and pity them, which had still this good ef-
fect on my side, that it gave me more and more cause to give
thanks to God, -who had so happily and comfortably provided
for me in my desolate condition! and that of two ships' com-
panies, who were now cast away upon this part of the world,
not one life should be spared but mine. I learnt here again
to observe that it is very rare that the providence of God
casts us into any condition of life so low, or any misery so
great, but we may see something or other to be thankful for,
and may see others in worse circumstances than our own.
Such certainly was the case of these men, of whom I could
not so much as see room to suppose any of them were sav-
ed; nothing could make it rational, so much as to wish or ex-
pect that they did not all perish there, except the possibility
only of their being taken up by another ship in company: and
this was but mere possibility indeed) for 1 saw not the least
signal or appearance of any such thing.
1 cannot explain, by any possible energy of words, what a
strange longing or hankering of desires I felt in my soul upon
this sight, breaking out sometimes thus: ' O that there had
been but one or two, nay, or but one soul saved out of the
ship, to have escaped to me, that I might but have had one
companion, one fellow creature, to have spoken to me, ami
to have conversed with!' In all the time of my solitary life,
1 never felt so earnest so strong a desire after the society of
my fellow creatures, or so deep a regret at the want of it '
There are some secret moving springs in the affections,
which, when they are set agoing by some object in view, or
be it some object, though not in view, yet rendered present
to the mind by the power of imagination, whose motion car-
ries out the soul by its impetuosity to such violent, eager em-
liracings of the object, that the absence of it is insupportable.
Sncb. were these earnest vishings, that but one man had
been saved. O that it had been but one! I believe I repeated
»he words, 'O that it had been but one!' a thousand times;
and my desires were so moved by it that when 1 spoke the
words, my hands would clinch together, and my fingers press
the palms of my hands, that if I had any soft thing in my
hand it would have crushed it involuntarily; and my teeth in
my head would strike together, and set against one another
so strong, that for some time I could not part them again.
Let the naturalists explain these things and the reason and
manner of them: all I can say is to describe the fact, which

frbm what it should proceed; it was doubtless the effect of
ardent wishes, and of strong ideas formed in my mind, realiz-
ing the comfort which the conversation. of one of my fellow1
Christians would hive been to me.
But it w as not to be; either their fate, or mine, or both, for-
bade it: for till, the last year of my being on this island, I never
knew whether any were saved out of that ship or no; and had
only the affliction, some days after, to see the corpse of a
drowned boy come on shore at the end of the island, which
-was next the shipwreck. He had on no clothes but a sea-
roan's waistcoat, a pair of open-knee'd linen drawers, and a
blue linen shirt; but nothing to direct me so much as to guess
.what nation he was of. He had nothing in his pocket but two
pieces of eight, and a tohaoco-pipe; the last was to me often
times more value than the first.
It was now calm, and I had a great mind to venture out in
my boat to this wreck, not doubting but I might find some-
thing on board that might be useful to me; but that did not
altogether press me so much, as the possibility that there
might be yet some living creature on board whose life I might
not only save, but might, by saving that life, comfort my own
to the last degree; and this thought clung so to my heart,
that I could not be quiet, night nor day, but I must venture
out in my boat on board this wreck; and committing the rest
to God's providence, I thought the impression was so strong
upon mind, that it could not be resisted, that it must come
from some invisible direction, and that I should be wanting
to myself, if I did not go.
Under the power of this impression, I hastened back to my
castle, prepared every thing for my voyage, took a quantity
of bread, a great pot for fresh water, a compass to steer by,
a bottle of rum (for I had still a great deal of that left), a
basket full of raisins: and thus loading myself with every thing
necessary, I went down to my boat, got the water out of her,
and got her afloat, loaded all my cargo in her, and then went
home again for more. My second cargo was a great bag full
. of rice, the umbrella to set up over my head for shade, another
large pot full of fresh water, and about two dozen of my
small loaves, or barley cakes, more than before, with a bot-
tle of goat's milk, and a cheese; all which with great la-
bour anil sweat, I brought to my boat, and praying to <*od to
direct my voyage, I put out, and rowing or paddling the caf
i
noe along the shore, I came at last to the utmost point of the
island, on that side, viz N. E. And now I was to lanch out
into the ocean; and either to Tenture, or not to venture. I
looked on the rapid currents which ran constantly- on both
sides of the island, at a distance, and which were very terri-
ble to me, from the remembrance of the hazard I had been in
before, and my heart began to fail me; for I foresaw, that if I
was driven into either of those currents, I should be carried a
vast way out to sea, and perhaps out of my reach, or sight of
the island again; and that then, as my boat was but small, if
any little gale of wind should rise, I should be inevitably
lost
These thoughts ss oppressed my mind, that I began to give>
over my enterprise, and having hauled my boat into a little
creek on the shore, I stepped out, and sat me down upon a
little spot of rising ground, very pensive and anxious, between . .
fear and desire about my voyage; when, as I was musing, X
could perceive that the tide was turned and the flood came on,
upon which my going was for so many hours impracticable.
Upon this it presently occurred to me, that I should go up t»
the highest piece of ground 1 could find, and observe, if I
could, how the sets of the tide or currents lay, when the flood
came in, that I might judge .whether, If I was driven one way
out, I might not expect to be driven another way home, with
the same rapidness of the currents. This thought was no-
sooner in my head, but I cast my eye upon a little hill which.
sufficiently overlooked the sea both ways, and from whence
I had a clear view of the currents, or sets of the tide, and
which way I was to guide myself in my return. Here X
found that as the current of the ebb set out close by the south
point of the island, so the current of the flood set in close by
the shore of the north side; and that 1 had nothing to do but
to keep to the north of the island in my return, and I should
do well enough.
Encouraged with this observation, I resolved the next
morning to set out with the first of the tide; and reposing my-
self for that night in the casoe, under the great watch-coat I
mentioned. I laoched out. I made first a little out to sea,
full north, till I began to feel the benefit of the current, which
set eastward, and which carried me at a great rate, and yet
did not so hurry me as the southern side current had done
before, and so as to take from me the government of the boat*'
Tiut, having a strong steerage with my paddle, I went, I say, at
a great rate, directly for the wreck, and in less than two
hours I came up to it.
It was a dismal sight to look at: the ship, which by its
huMing was Spanish, stuck fast, jamhed in between two
rocks; all the stern and quarter of her was beaten to pieces
-with the sea; and as her forecastle, which stuck in the rocks,
had run on with great violence, her main-mast and fore-mast
were brought by the board, that is to say, broken short off;
hut her bowsprit was sound, and the head and bow appeared
firm. When I came close to her, a dog appeared upon her,
who, seeing me coming, yelped, and cried; and as soon as I
called him, jumped into the sea, to come to me; and I took
him into the boat, but found him almost dead for hunger and
thirst. I gave him a cake of my bread, and he eat like a
ravenous wolf, that had been starving a fortnight in the snow.
I then gave the poor creature some fresh water, with which,
if I would have let him, he would have burst himself.
After this I went on board. The first sightl met with waa
two men drowned in the cook-room, or forecastle ofthe ship,
with their arms fast about one another. I concluded, as is in-
deed probable, that when the ship struck, it being in a storm,
the sea broke so high, and so continually over her, that the
men were not able to bear it, and were strangled with the
constant lushing in of the water, as much as if they had been
Tmder water. Besides the dog there was nothing left in the
ship that had life, nor any goods that I could see but what
were spoiled by the water. There were some casks of li-
quor, whether wine or brandy, I knew not, which lay lower-
in the hold, and which the water being ebbed out, I could
see; but they were too big to meddle with. I saw several
chests, which 1 believed belonged to some of the seamen, and
I got two of them into the boat, without examining what wag
in them.
Had the stern of the ship been fixed, and the fore port
broken off, I am persuaded that I might have made a good
voyage: for, by what I found in these two chests, I had room
to suppose the ship had a great deal of wealth on board: and,
if I may guess by the course she steered, she must have been
bound from Buenos Ay res, or the Rio de la Plata, in the
south part of America, beyond the Brasils, to the llavanna,
in the Gulf of Mexico, and so pet haps to Spain. She had,
no doubt, a great treasure in her, but of no use at that time
to any body; and what became of the rest of her people, I then.
knew not.
I found, besides these chests, a little cask full of liquor, of
about twenty gallons, which I got into my boat with much dif-
ficulty. There were several muskets in a cabin, and a great
powder-horn, with about four pounds of powder in it: as for
the muskets I had no occasion for them, so I left them, but took
the powder-horn. I took a fire-shovel and tongs which I
wanted extremely; as also two little brass kettles, a copper
pot to make chocolate, and a gridiron, and with this cargo,
and the dog, I came away, the tide beginning to make home
again: and the same evening about an hour within night, I
reached the island again, weary and fatigued to the last de-
gree.
I reposed that night in the boat, and in the morning I re-
solved to harbour what I had gotten in my new cave, and not
to carry it home to my castle. After refreshing myself, I got
all my cargo on shore, and began to examine the particulars'.
The cask of liquor I found to be a kind of rum, but not such
as we had at the Urasils; and, in a word, not at all good. Hot
when I came to open the chests, I found several things which
I wanted: for example, I found in one a fine case of bottles, of
an extraordinary kind, and filled with cordial waters, fine and!
very good: the bottles held about three pints each, and were
tipped with silver- 1 found two pots of very good succades,
or sweetmeats, so fastened also on top, that the salt watce
had not hurt them; and two more of the same, which the wa-
ter had spoiled. I found some very good shins, which were
very welcome to me, and about a dozen and a half of white
linen handkerchiefs, and coloured neckcloths; the former
were also very welcome, being exceeding refreshing to
wipe my face in a hot day. Besides this, when I came to
the till in the chests, 1 found there three great bags of pieces
of eight, which held about eleven hundred pieces in all; ami
in one of them, wrapt up in a paper, six doubloons of gold, and
some small bars of wedges of gold; I suppose they might all
weigh near a pound.
The other chest I found had some clothes in it, but of little
value; but by the circumstances it must have belonged to the
gunner s mate, though there was no powder in it, but about
two pounds of glazed powder, in three 'small flasks, kept, 1
suppose, for charging their fowling-pieces on occasion. Upon
the whole I got very little by this voyage, that was of much
use to me; for, as to the money, I had no manner of occasion
for it, it was to me as the dirt under my feet, and I would
have given it all for three or four pair of English shoes and
stockings which were things I greatly wanted, but had not
had on my feet now for many years. I had, indeed, gotten
two pair of shoes now, which I (ook off the feet of the two
drowned men whom I saw in the wreck; and I found two pair
more in one of the chests, whioh were very welcome to me;
but they were not like our English shoes, either for ease or
service, being rather what we call pumps than shoes. I found
in this seaman's chest about fifty pieces of eight in royals, but
no gold: I suppose this belonged to a poorer man than the
other, which seemed to belong to some officer.
Well, however, 1 lugged this money home to my cave, and
laid it up, as I had done that before, which 1 brought from
our own ship; but it was a great pity, as I said, that the other
part of the ship had not come to my share, for I am satisfied
I might have loaded my canoe several times over with mo-
ney, which, if I bad ever escaped to England, would have lien
here safe enough till I might have come again and fetched it.
Having now brought all my things on shore, and secured
them, I -went back to my boat and rowed or paddled her
along the shore to her old harbour, where I laid her up, and
made the best of my way to my old habitation, where I found
every thing safe and quiet; so I began to repose myself, live
after my old fashion, and take care of my family affairs; and
for a while I lived easy enough, only that I was more vigilant
than I used to be, looked out oftener, and did not go abroad
so much; and if at any time I did stir with any freedom, it
was always to the east part of the island, where I was pretty
well satisfied the savages never came, and where I could go
without so many precautious, and such a load of arms and
ammunition as I always carried with me, if I went the other
way •
1 lived in this condition near two years more; but my un-
lucky head, that was always to let me know it was born to
make my body miserable, was all those two years filled with
projects and designs, how, if it were possible, I might get
away from this island; for sometimes 1 was for making another -
Voyage to the wreck, though my reason told me, that there
. P
-was nothing left there worth the hazard of my voyage; some-
times for a ramble one way, sometimes another; and I be-
lieve verily, if I had had the boat that I went from Sallee tn, I
should have ventured to sea, bound any where, I knew not
whither.
I have been, in all my circumstances, a memento to those
-who are touched vith that general plague of mankind, whence,
for aught I know, one half of their miseries flow; I mean,
that of not being satisfied with the station wherein God and
nature hath placed them For, not to look back upon my
primitive condition, and the excellent advice of my father, the
opposition to which was, as I may call it, my original sin, my
subsequent mistakes of the same kind have been the
means of my coming into this miserable condition; for had
that Providence, which so happily had seated me at the Bra-
sils, as a planter, blessed me with confined desires, and could
I have been contented to have gone on gradually, I might
have been by this time, I mean of the time of my being in this
island, one of the most considerable planters in the Urasiis; nay,
I am persuaded that, by the improvements I had made in that
little time I lived there and the increase I should probably
have made, if I had staid, I might have been worth a hundred
thousand moidores. And what business had I to leave a set-
tle:! fortune, a well stocked plantation, improving and increas-
ing, to turn supercargo to Guinea to fetch Vegroes, wWfen pa-
tience and time would have so increased our stock at home,
that we could have bought them at our own doors, from those
whose business it was to fetch them? and though it had cost
us something more, yet the difference of that price was by no
means w orth saving, at so great a hazard
But as this is ordinarily the fate of young heads, so reflec-
tion upon the folly of it, is as ordinarily the exercise of more
years, or of the dear-bought experience of time; and so it was
with me now: and yet so deep had the mistake taken root
in my temper, that I could not satisfy myself in my station,
but was continually poring upon the means and possibility of
my escape from this place. And that I may, with the great-
er pleasure to the reader, bring on the remaining part of my
story, it may not be improper to give some account of my first
conceptions on the subect of this foolish scheme for my es-
cape, and how and upon what foundation I acted.
I Am now to he supposed to be retired into my castle, af.
ter mv late voyage to the wreck, my frigate laid up and se-
cured under water as usual, and my condition restored to
•what it was before I had more wealth, indeed, than I had
before, but was not at all the richer, for I had no more use
for it than the Indians of Peru had before the Spaniards came
thither.
It was one of the nights, in the rainy season, in March, the
four-and-twentieth year of my first setting foot in this island of
solitariness, I was lying in my bed, or hammock, awake, very
well in health, had no pain, no distemper, no uneasiness of
body, no, nor any nneasiness of mind more than ordi-
nary; but could by no means close my eyes; that is, so as
t» sleep, no not a wink all night long, otherwise than as fol-
lows?
It is as impossible as needless to set down the innumerable
crowd of thoughts that whirled through that great thorough-
fare of the brain, the memory, in this night's time: I ran
over the whole history of my life in miniature, or by abridg-
ment, as I may call it, to my coming to this island; and also
of that part of my life since I came to this island. In my re-
flections upon the state of my case, since I came on shore
on this island, I was comparing the happy posture of my af-
fairs, in the first years of my habitation here, to that course of
anxiety, fear, and care, which I had lived in ever since I had
seen the print of a foot in the sand. Not that I did not be-
lieve the savages had frequented the island even all the while,
and might have been several hundreds of them at times on
shore there; bot as I had never known it, and was incapable
of any apprehensions about it, my satisfaction was perfect,
though my danger was the same; and I was as happy in not
knowing my danger, as if I had never really been exposed to
it. This furnished my thoughts with many very profitable
reflections, and particularly this one, How infinitely good that
Providence is. which has settled in its government of man-
kind such narrow bounds to his sight and knowledge of
things; and though he walks in the midst of so many thousand
dangers, the sight of which, if discovered to him would dis-
tract his mind, and sink his spirits, he is kept serene and
cai.n, by having the events of thingafhid from hise yes, and
knowing nothing of the dangers which surround him.
After these thoughts had for some time entertained me, I
came to reflect seriously upon the real danger I had been in
for so. many years in this very island; and how I had walked
about in the greatest security, and with all possible tran-
quillity, even when perhaps nothing but the brow of a hill,
a great tree, or the casual approach of night, had been be-
tween me and the worst kind of destruction; viz. that of fal-
ling into the hands of cannibals and savages, who would-have
seized on me with the same view as I did on a|goat or a turtle,
and have thought it no more a crime to kill and devour me,
than I did of a pigeon or a curlien: I should unjustly slander
myself, ifl should say I was not sincerely thankfid to my great
Preserver, to whose singular protection I acknowledged, with
great humility. that all these unknown deliverances were due,
and without which I should inevitably have fallen into their
merciless hands-
When these thoughts were over, my head was for some
time taken up in considering the nature of these wretched
,Creatures, I mean, the savages; and how it came to pass in the
world, that the wise Governor of all things should give op any
of his creatures to such inhumanity, nay, to something so
much below even brutality itself. as to devour its own kind.
But as this ended in some (at that time fruitless) specula-
tions, it occurred to me to inquire what part of the world
these wretches lived in; how far off the coast was from
whence they came; what thev ventured over »o far from
home for; what kind of boats they had; and why I might
not order myself, and my business so, that I might be
as able to go over thither, as they were to come to me.
I never so much as troubled myself to consider what I
should do with myself when I came thither; what should be-
come of me, if I fell into the hands of the savages; or how I
should escape from them, if they attempted me; no, nor so
much as how it was possible for me to reach the coast, and
not be attempted by some one or other of them, without any
possibility of delivering myself, and if I should not fall into
their hands, what I should do for provision, or whither I
should bend my course, none of these thoughts, 1 say, so much
as came in my way; but my mind was wholly bent upon the
notion of my passing over in my boat to the main land. I
looked back upon my present condition, as the moot misera-
ble that could possibly be; thatlwus not able to throw my.
self into any thing but death that could be called worse; thatj
if I reached the shore of the main, I might perhaps meet
.with relief. or I might coast along as I did on the shore of
Africa, till 1 came to some inhabited country, and where I
might find some relief; and after all, perhaps I might fall in
with some Christian ship that might take me in, and if the
worst came to the worst I could but die, which would put an
end to all these miseries at once. Pray note, all this was the
fruit of a disturbed mind, an impatient temper, made, as it
were, desperate by the long continuance of my troubles, and
the disappointments I had met with in the wreck I had been on
hoard of, and where I had been so near the obtaining what I
so earnestly longed for, viz. somebody to speak to, and to learn
some knowledge from, of the place where I was, and of the
probable means of my deliverance; I say, I was agitated
wholly by these thoughts. All my calm of mind, in my re-
signation to Providence, and waiting the issue of the disposi-
tions of Heaven, seemed to be suspended; and I had, as it
were, no power to turn my thoughts to any thing, hut the
project of a voyage to the main, which came upon me with
such force, and such an Impetuosity of desire, that it was not
to be resisted.
When this had agitated my thoughts, for two hours or
more, with such violence, that it set my very blood into a
ferment. and my pulse beat as high as if I had been in a fe-
ver, merely with the extraordinary fervour of my mind about
it; nature, as if I had been fatigued and exhausted with the
very thought of it, threw me into a sound sleep. One would
have thought I should have dreamed of it; but I did not, nor
of any thing relating to ic: but I 'dreamed that as 1 was going
out in the morning as usual, from my castle, I saw upon the
shore two canoes, and eleven savages coming to land, and
that they brought with them another savage, whom they
were going to kill, in order to eat him, when, on a sudden,
the savage that they were going to kill, jumped away, and
ran for his life: then I thought in my sleep, that he came run-
ning into my little thick grove, before my fortification, to
hide himself; and that 1 seeing him alone, and not perceiving
that the others sought him that way, showed myself to him,
and smiling upon him, encouraged him: that he kneeled down
to me seeming to pray to me to assist him; upon which I
showed him my ladder, made him go upon it and carried him
into my cave, and he became my servant; and that as soon as I
P2
liad gotten this man. 1 said to myself, ' Now I may certainly
venture to the main land: for this fellow will serve me as a pilot,
and will tell me what to do. and whither to go for provisions,
and whither not to go for fear of being devoured, what places to
venture into, and what to escape.' I waked with this thought,
and was undersuch inexpressible impressions of joy at the
prospect of mv escape in my dream, that the disappointments
which I felt upon coming to myself, and finding it was no more
than a dream, were equally extravagant the other way, and
threw me into a very great dejection of spirit.
Upon this, however, I made this conclusion, that my only
way to go about an attempt for an escape, was if possible, to
get a savage in my possession and, if possible, it should be
one of their prisoners, whom they had condemned to be eat-
en, and should bring hither to kill; but these thoughts still
were attended with this difficulty, that it was impossible to
effect this without attacking a whole caravan of them, and kil-
ling them all; and this was not only a very desperate attempt,
and might miscarry, but, on the other hand, I had greatly scru-
pled the lawfulness of it to me, and my heart trembled at
the thoughts of shedding so much blood, though it was for
my deliverance. I need not repeat the arguments which oc-
curred to me against this, they being the same mentioned be-
fore, but though I had other reasons to offer now; viz. that
those men were enemies to my life, and would devour me, if
they could; that it was self-preservation, in the highest degree
to deliver myself from this death of a life, and was acting in.
my own defence, as much as if they were actually assaulting
me, and the like, I say, though these things argued for it, yet
the thoughts of shedding buman blood for my deliverance,
were very terrible to me, and such its I could by no means re-
concile myself to a great while.
However, at last, after many secret disputes with myself,
and after great perplexities about it (lor all these arguments
one way and another, struggled in my head a long time), the
eager prevailing desire of deliverance at length mastered all
the rest, and I resolved, if possible, to get one of these savages
into my hands, cost what it would. My next thing then was
to contrive how to do it; and this indeed was Very difficult to
resolve or.: but as I could pitch upon no probable means for it,
so I resolved to put myself upon the watch, to see them when
they came on shore, and leave the rest to the event, taking
fuch measures as the opportunity should present, let be what
would be
With these resolutions in my thoughts, I set myself upon.
the scout, as often as possible, and indeed so often, ttll I was
heartily tired of it; for it was above a year and a half that I
waited, and for a great part of that time went out to the west
end, and to the south-west corner of the island, almost every
day, to see the canoes but none appeared. This was very
discouraging, and began to trouble me much: though I cannot
say that it did in this case, as it had done some time before
that, viz. wear off the edge of my desire to the thing, but the'
longer it seemed to be delayed, the more eager.I was for it.
In a word, I was not at first more careful to shun the sight of
these savages, and avoid being seen by them, than I was now
eager to be upon them
Besides, I fancied myself able to manage one, nay. two ot
or three savages, if I had them, so as to make them eutirely
slaves to me, to do whateverl should direct them, and to pre-
vent their being able at any time to do me any hurt It was
a great while that I pleased myself with this affair: but nothing
still presented; all my fancies and schemes came to nothmg,
for no savages came near me for a great while.
About a year and a halt after I had entertained these no-
tions, and, by long musing, had, as it were, resolved them all
into nothing, for want of an occasion to put them into execu-
tion, I was surprized one morning early, with seeing no less
than five canoes, all on shore together, on my side the island,
and the people who belonged to them all landed and out of
my sight. The number of them broke all my measures; for
seeing so many, and knowing thnt they always came four or six',
or sometimes more, in a boat, I could not tell what to think of
it, or how to take my measures to at.rick twenty or thirtv men
single-handed; so I lay still in my castle, perplexed and dis-
comforted. However, I put myself into all the same posrures
for an attack, that I had formerly provided, and was just rea-
dy for action if any thing had presented. Having waited a
good while, listening to hear if they made any noise,-at length,
being very impatient, I set my guns at the foot of my ladder,
and clambered up to the top of the hill by my two stages, as
ysual. standing so however, that my head did not appear
above the hill; so that they could not perceive me, by any
means. Here 1 observed, by the help of my perspective
glass, that they were no less than thirty in number, that they
had a fire kindled, and that they had meat dressed how they
cooked it, that I knew not, or what it was; but they wire all
dancing, in 1 know not how many barbarous gestures and fi-
gures, their own way, round the fire
While I was thus looking on them, I perceived by my
perspective, two miserable wretches dragged from the boats,
-where, it seems, they were laid by, and were now brought
out for the slaughter I perceived one of them immediately
fell, being knocked down, I suppose, with a club or woodea
tfwnrd for that was their way; and two or three others were
at work immediately, cutting him open for theii' cookery,
-while the other victim was left standing by himself, till they
should be ready for him. ' In that very moment this poor
wretch seeing himself a little at liberty, nature inspired him
with hopes of life, and he started away from them, and ran
-willi incredible swiftness along the sands, directly towards me,
I mean, toward that part of the coast where my habitation
was.
I was dreadfully frighted (that I must acknowledge), when
I perceived him to run nn way; and especially when, as I
thought, 1 saw him pursued by the whole body; and now I ex*
pected that part of my dream was coming to pass, and that he
would certainly take shelter in my grove; but I could not de-
pend, by any means, upon my dream for the rest of it, viz.
that the other savages would not pursue him thither, and find
him there.- However. I kept my station, and my spirits be-
gat to recover, when I found that there were nut above three
men that followed him; and still more was I encouraged,
when I found that he outstripped them exceedingly in run-
ning, and gamed ground of them, so that if he could but hold
it out for half an hour, I saw easily he would fairly get away
from them all.
There was between them and my castle the creek, which
I mentioned often at the first part of my story, when I land-
ed my cargoes out of the ship, and this I knew he must ne-
cessarily swim over, or the poor wretch would be taken there:
but when the savage escaping came thither, he made noth-
mg of it, though the tide was then up, but plunging in, swam.
through in about thirty strokes, or thereabouts. landed, and
ran on with exceeding stivngth and swiftness. When the
three pursuers came to the creek, I found that two of them
could swim, but that the third could not, and that he, standing
on the other side, looked at the others, but went no farther;
and soon after went softly back again, which, as it happened,
Has very well for hirn in the main.
I observed that the two who swam, were yet more than
twice as longswimmiog over the creek, than the fellow was
that fled from them. It came now very warmly upon my
thoughts, and indeed irresistibly, that now was my time to get
me a servant, and perhaps a companion or assistant, and that
I was called plainly, by Providence, to save this poor crea-
ture's life. I immediately got down the ladders, with all
possible expedition, fetched my two guns, for they were both
at the foot of the ladders, as I observed above; and getting up
again with the same haste to the top of the hill, I crossed to-
wards the sea; and having a very short cut, and all down hill,
clapped myself in the way, between the pursuers and the
pursued, hollowing aloud to him that fled, who, looking back,
-was at firs* perhaps as much frighted at me, as at them; but
I beckoned with my hand to him to come back, and, in the
mean time, I slowly advanced towards the two that followed;
then rushing at once upon the foremost, I knocked him down
with the stuck of my piece: I was loath to fire, because I
would not have the rest hear. though at that distance it would
not have been easily heard; and being out of sight of ihe
smoke too, they would not have easily known what to make
of it. Having knocked this fellow down, the other who pur-
sued him stopped, as if he had been frightened, and I ad-
vanced apace towards him; but as I came nearer, I perceived
presently he had a bow and arrow, and was fitting it to shoot-
at roe; so I was then necessitated to shoot at him first, wl,:ch
I did, and killed him at the first shot. The poor savage who
fled, but had stopped, though he saw both his enemies falien,
and killed (as he thought), yet was so frighted with the lire
and noise of my piece, that he stooil stock-still, and neither
came forward, nor went backward, though he seemed rather
inclined to fly still, than to come on I hollowed again to him,
and made signs lo come forward, which he easily understood,
and came a little way, then stopped again, and then a little
farther, and stopped again, and I could then perceive that he
stood trembling, as if he had been taken prisoner. and had
just been to be killed, as his two enemies were I beckoned
him again to come to me, and gave him all the signs of en-
cooragement that I ciinlt) think of; and he came nearer and
nearer, kneeling down ever) ten or twelve steps in token of
acknowledgement tor saving his life. I smiled at him, and
looked pleasantly, and beckoned him to come still nearer.
At length he came close to me, and then he kneeled di.wa
again, kissed the ground, and laid his head upon the ground,
and taking me by the foot, set mj foot upon his head: this, it
seems, was in token of swearing to be my slave for ever X
took him up, and made much of him, and encouraged him all!
Gould But there was more v/ork to do yel; for I perceived the
savage whom I had knocked down j»as not killed, but stunned
-with the blow, and began to com; to himself. So I pointed to
him, and showing him the savage, that he was not'dead; upon
this he spoke someWoi ds to me, and though I could not under-
staid them, yet I thought they were pleasant to hear, for they
-were the first sound of a1 man's voice, that I had heard, my
own excepted, for above five and-twenty years. But there
Was no time for such reflections now. The savage who was
knocked down recovered himself so far as to sit upon the.
ground; and I perceived that my savage begat, to be afraid: but
ivhei. I saw that, I presented my other piece at the man as if
I would shoot him; upon this my savage, fer so loll him now,
made a motion to me to lend him my sword, which hung
naked in a belt by my side; so I did. He no sooner had it but
he runs to his enemy, and, at one ' blow, cut offhis head as
Cleverly, no executioner in Germany could have done it
soulier or better; which 11 bought very strange for one, who,
I had reason to believe. never saw a sword in his life before,
except their own wooden swords. However, it seems, as I
learned afterwards, they make iheir wooden swords so 9harp,
so heavy, aid the wood is so hard, that they will cut off heads
even with them, ay, and arms, and that at one blow too.
When he had done this, he comes laughing to me in sign of
trinmph, and brought me the sword again, and with abun-
dance of gestures, which I did not understand, laid it down,
with the head of the savage that he had killed, just before me.
But that which astonished him most was to know how 1 had
killed the other Indian so far off; so pointing to bin, he made
signs to me to let him go to him; so I bade him go, as well as
I could. When he came to him, he stood like one amazed,
lookmg at him; turned him first on one side, then on the other;
•ooked at the wound the bullet had made, wliioh, it seem\
was just in his breast, where it had made a hole, and no great
quantity of blood had followed, hut he had bled inwardly. fur he
was quite dead Then he took up his bow and arrows, and
came back, so I turned to go away, and beckoned to him to fol-
low me, makmgsigns to him that more might come after them.
Upon this, he signed to me that he should bury them with
sand, that they might uot be seen by the rest, if they follow-
ed, and so I made signs, again to him to do so: he fell to work, -
and, in an instant, he scraped a hole in the sand wiih his
hands. big enough to bury the first in, and then dragged him
into it, and covered him; and did so also, by the other I be-
lieve he had buried them both in a quarter of an hour; then
calling him away, I carried him not to my castle, but quite
away to my eave, on the farther part of the island: so I did.
not let my dream come to pass in that part; viz. that he come;
into my grove for shelter.
Here 1 gave him bread, and a bunch of raisins to eat, and
tk draught of water, which I found he was indeed in great dis-
tress for by his running. and having refreshed him, I made
signs for him to go lie down and sleep, pointing to a place
.where I had laid a great parcel of rice straw, and a blanket
upon it, which I used to sleep upon myself sometimes: so the
j>oor creature lay down, and went to sleep.
He was a comely, handsome fellow; perfectly well made,
with straight, long limbs, not too large; tall, and well shaped;
and, as I reckon, about twenty-six years of age. He had a
very good countenance. not a fierce and surly aspect, but
seemed to have something very manly in his face, and yet he
had all the sweetness and softness of an European in his coun-
tenance too, especially when he smiled. His hair was long and
black, not curled like wool; his forehead very high, and large,
and a great vivacity and sparkling sharpness in his ev es. The
colour of his skin was not quite black, but very tawny, and let
not of an ugly, yellow, nauseous tawny, as the Brasilians, and
Virginians, and other natives of America are, but of a bright
kind of a dun olive colour, that had in it so'methingvery agree-
able, though not very easy to describe. His face was round,
and plump, his nose small, not flat like the negroes, a very
good mouth, thin lips, and his teeth fine, well set, and white
a* ivory After he had slumbered, rather than slept, about
half an hour; he waked again, and conies out of the cave to
me, fov I had been milking my goats which I had in the enclp.
sure just by. When lie espied me, lie came running to me,
laying himself down upon the ground with all the possible
signs of a humble thankful disposition, making many antio.
gestures to show it. At last he lays his head flat upon the
ground, close to my foot, and sets my other foot upon his
head, as he had done before; and after this, made all the
signs to me of subjection, servitude, and submission imagina-
ble. to let me know how much he would serve me as long as
he lived. I'understood him in many things, and let him
know I was very well pleased with him. In a little time I be-
gan to speak to him, and teach him to speak to me; and firat
I made him know his name should be Friday, which was (he
da' I saved his life; and I called him so for the memory of
the time: I likewise taught him to say,'Master,'and then
let hini know that was tc be my nam^j; 1 likewise taught
him to sav, ' Yes'and 'No,' and to kijosc the meaning of
them. I gave him some milk in an earthed pot, and let him
see me drmk it before him, ami sop my bread in it; and I
gave him a cake of bread to do the like; which he quickly
complied with, and made signs that it was very good for
him.
I kept there with him all that night; but as soon as it was
dni, 1 beckoned him to come with me, and let him know I
would give him some clothes; at which he seemed very glad,
for he was stark naked. As we went by the place where we
had buried the two men, he pointed exactly to the spot, and
showed me the marks that he had made to find them again,
making signs to me that we should dig them up again, and
eat them: at this I appeared very angry, expressed my abhor-
rence of it, made as if 1 would vomit at the thoughts of it, and
beckoned with my hand to him to come away, which he did
immediately, with great submission. I then led him up to the
top of the hill to sec if his enemies were gone, and pulling
out my glass, I looked, and saw plainly the place where they
h:ul been, but no appearance of them, or of their canoes; so
that it was plain that they were gone, and had left their two
comrades behmd them, without any search after them.
Hut I was not content with this discovery; hut, having now
more courage, and consequently more curiosity, 1 took my
man Friday with me, giving him the swtird in his hand, with
the bow and arrows at his back, which I found he could use
very dextorouslv, making him carry one gun for me, and
"\
t two for myself, and away we marched to the place where
these creatures had been; for I had a mind now to get some
fuller intelligence of them. When I came to the place, my
Very blood ran chill in my veins, and my heart sunk within
me at the horror of the spectacle. Indeed it was a dreadful
sight, at least it was so to me, though Friday made nothing
of it: the place was covered witli human bones, the ground
dyed with the blood, great pieces of flesh left here and there,
half eaten, mangled, and scorched; and, in short, all the tokens
of the trinmphant feast the* had been making there, after a
victory over the enemies. I saw three skulls, five hands, and
the bones of three or four legs and feet, and abundance of other
parts of the bodies: and Friday, by his signs, made me under-
stand, that they brought over four prisoners to feast upon: that
three of them were eaten up, and that he pointing to himself
was the fourth; that there had been a great battle between,
them and their next king, whose subject, it seems, he had
been one of; and that they had taken a great number of pri-
soners, all which were carried to several places by those that
had taken them in the fight, in order to feast upon them,as
was done here by these wretches upon those they brought
hither.
I caused Friday to gather all the skulls, bones, flesh, and
whatever remained, and lay them together on a heap, and
make a great fire upon it, and burn them all to ashes. 1
found Friday had still a hankering stomach after some of the
flesh, and was still a cannibal in his nature; but I discovered
so much abhorrence at the very thoughts of it, and at the
least appearance of it, that he durst not discover it; for I had
by some means, let him know, that I would kill him if he of-
fered it.
When we had done this, we came back to our castle, and
there I fell to work for my man Friday. And first of all, {
gave him a pair of linen drawers, which I had out of the poor
gunner's chest, I mentioned, and which I found in the wreck;
and which, with a little alteration, fitted him very well: then
I made him a jerkin of goat's skin, as well as my skill would
allow, and I was now grown a tolerable good tailor; and I gave
him a cap, which I had made of hare-skin, very convenient,
and fashionable enough: and thus he was dressed, for the pre-
sent, tolerably well; and mighty well pleased was he to see
hjmsejf almost as well clothed as his master. It is true, he
« J
went awkwardly in these things at first; wearing the drawer?
Was very awkwaid to him; and the sleeves of the waisicoat
galled his shoulder and the inside of his arms: but a little eas-
ing, them where he complained they hurt him, and using
himself to them, at length he took to them very well.
The next day after 1 came home to my hutch with him, I
iiegan to consider where I should lodge him, and that I might
do well for him, and yet be perfectly easy myself, I made a little
tent for him, in the vacant place netween my two fortifica-
tions, in the inside of the last, and the outside of the first: and
as there was a door or entrance there into my cave, I made
a formal framed door-case, and a door to it of boards, mm] set
it up in the passage, a little within the entrance; and causing
the door to open on the inside, 1 barred it up in the night,
vking in my ladders too, so thai Friday oould no way come
at me in the inside of my innermost wall, without making so
much noise in getting over, that it must needs awaken me; for
my first wall had now a complete roof over it of long poles,
covering all my tent, and leaning up to the side of the hill,
Which was again laid cross with small sticks instead of laths,
and then thatched over a great thickness with the rice straw,
-winch was strong like reeds; and at the hule or place which
Ivti" left to go in or out by the ladder, I had placed a kind of
trap-door, which, if it had been attempted on the outside,
Would not have opened at all, but would have fallen down,
and made a great noise: and as to weapons, I took them all in
to, my side every night.
But I needed none of all this precaution; for never man
iiad a more faithful, loving, sincere servant than Friday was to
me, without passion, sullenuess, or designs; perfectly obliged
and engaged: his very affections were tied to me, like those
of a child to afatlier; and I dare say, he would have sacrificed
his life for the saving mine, upon any occasion whatsoever.
The many testimonies he gave me of this, put it out of doubt;
and soon convinced me, that I needed to use no precautions
as to my safety on his account.
This frequently gave me occasion to observe, and that with
Wonder, that, however it had pleased God in his providence,
and in the government of the works of his hands, to take from
so great a part of the world of his creatures, the best uses to
winch their faculties, and the powers of t heir souls, are adapt-
•I; yet that he has bestowed upon them the same powers,
the same reason, the same affections, the same sentiments of
kindness and obligation, the same passions and resentments
of wrongs, the same sense of gratitude, sincerity, fidelity. and
ail the capacities of domg good, and receiving good, that he
has given to us; and; and that when he pleases to offer them'
occasions of exerting these, they are as ready, nay, more rea-
dy to apply them to the right uses for which they were be-
stowed, than we are. And this made me very melancholy
sometimes, in reflecting, as the several occasions presented,
how mean a use we make of all these, .even though we have
these powers enlightened by the great lamp of instruction,
the Spirit of God, and by the knowledge of his word, added to
our understanding, and why it has pleased God to hide the like
saving knowledge from so many millions of souls, who, if I
might judge by this poor savage, would make a much belief
use of it than we did. i
From hence I sometimes was led too far to invade the sove-
reignty of Providence, and as it were, arraign the justice of so
arbitrary a disposition of things that should hide that light
from some, and reveal it to others, and yet expect a like du-
ty from both. But I shut it up, and checked my thoughts
with this conclusion; first, That we did not know by what
light and law these would be condemned; but that as God was.
necessarily, and by the nature of his being, infinitely holy
and just so it could not be, but that if these creatures were all
sentenced to absence from himself, it was on account of sin-
ning against that light, which, as the scripture says. was a
law to themselves, and by such rules, as their consciences
would acknowledge to be just, though the foundation was not
discovered to us: and, secondly, That still as we are all 'he
clay in the hand of the potter, no vessel could say to hinjj
' Why hast thou formed me thus?'
But to return to my new companion: I was greatly delight-
ed with him and made it my business to teach him every
thing that was proper to make him useful, handy, and helpful;
but especially to make him speak and understand me when
I spake; and he was the uptest scholar that ever was, and par-
ticularly was so merry, so constantly diligent and so pleased
when he could but understand me, or make me understand
him, that it was very pleasant to me to talk to him. And
now my life began to be so easy, that I began to say to my-
sjelf, that could I but have been safe from more savages, I
tared dot if I was never to remove from the place where I
lived.
After I had been two or three days.returned to my castle,
1 thought, that, in order to bring Friday off from his horrid
way of feeding, and from the relish of a cannibal's stomach, I
ought to let him taste other flesh So I took him out with
me one morning to the woods. I went, indeed, intending to
kill a kid out of my own flock, and bring it home and dress it:
hut as I was going, I saw a she.goat, lying down in the shade,
and two young kids sitting by her. I catched hold of Friday;
'Hold,' said I ' stand still;' and made signs to him not to stir:
immediately I presented my piece, shot, and killed one of the
4ids The poor creature who had, at a distance, indeed,
seen me kill the savage, his enemy, but did not know, nor
could imagine how it was done, was sensibly surprised, trem-
lied, and shook, and looked so amazed, that 1 thought he
Would have sunk down. He did not see the kid I had shot
at, nor perceive I had killed it, but ripped up his waistcoat
to feel if he was not wounded; and, as I found, presently
thought I was resolved to kill him; for he came and kneeled
dewn to me, and, embracing my knees, said a great many
things I did not understand, but I could easily see, that his
meaning was to pray me not to kill him.
I sooh found a way to convince him, that I would do him
no harm; and taking him up by the hand, laughed at him,
and pointing to the kid which I had killed, beckoned to him
to run and fetch it, which he didj and while he was wonder-
ing and looking to see how the creature was killed, I loaded
my gun again, and by-and-by I saw a great fowl, like
a hswk, sit upon a tree within shot, so, to let Friday un-
derstand a little what I would do, I called him to me again,
pomting at the fowl, which was indeed a parrot, though I
thought it had been a hawk; I say pointing to the par-
rot, and to my gun, and to the ground under the parrot,
to let him see I would make him fall, I made him understand
thai I Would shoot and kill that bird: accordingly I tired and
bade him look, and immediately he saw the parrot fall. He
stood like one frighted again, notwithstanding all that I had
said to him; and I found he was the more amazed, because he
did not see me put any thing into the gun; but thought there
must be some wonderful fund of death and destruction in
that thmg, able to kill man, beast, bird, or any thing near oj.-
far off; for the astonishment this created in him was such as
could not wear off for a long time; and 1 believe/ if I would
have let him, he would have worshipped me and my gun: as
for the gun itself, he would not so much as touch it for seve-
ral days after; but would speak to it, and talk to it, as if it had
answered him, when lie was by himself, which, as I afterwards
learned was to desire it not to kill him.
Well, after his astonishment was a little over at this, I
pointed to him to run and fetch the bird I had shot, which he
did, but staid some time, for the parrot, not being quite dead,
was fluttered a good way oif from the place where she fell.
However, he found her, took her up, and brought her to
me: and as 1 had perceived his ignorance about the gun be-
fore, I took this advantage to charge the gun again, and not
let him see me do it, that I might be ready for any othei»
mark that might present; but nothing more offered at that
time. So I brought home the kid, and the same evening
I took the skin oil', and cut it out as well as I could; and
having a pot for that purpose, I boiled or stewed some of
the flesh, and made some very good broth after I had begun
to eat some, I gave some to my man, who seemed very glad of
it, and liked it very well, but that which was strangest to him
was to see me eat salt with it- He made a sign to me that
the salt was not good to eat, and putting a little into his own
mouth, he seemed to nauseate it, and would spit and sputter at
it. washing his mouth with fresh water after it; on the other
hand, I took some meat in my mouth without salt, and I pre-
tended to spit and sputter for want of salt, as fast is he had
done at the salt; but it would not do, he would never care for
salt with meat .or in his broth, at least, not a gi eat while, and
then hut a very little
Having thus fed him with boiled meat and broth, I was re-
solved to feast him the next day with roasting a piece of the
kid: this I did by hanging it before the fire in a string, as I had
seen many people do in England, setting two poles up, one oni
eaeh side the fire, and one cross on the top, and tying the
string to the cross stick, letting the meat turn continually.
This Friday admired very much: but when he came to taste
the flesh, he took so many ways to tell me how well he liked
it, that I could not but understand him: and, at last,' he told
me he would never cat man's flesh any more, which 1 was
very glad to hear.
The next clay I set him to work to beating some corn out,
and sifting it in the manner I used to do, as I observed before;
and he soon understood how to do it as well as I, especially
after he had seen what the meaning of it was, and that it was
to make bread of, for after that I let him see me make
my breads and bake it too: and in a little time Friday
-was able to do all the work for me, as "well as I could do it
myself.
I began to consider that having two mouths to feed instead
of one, I must provide more ground for my harvest, and plant
h larger quantity of corn than I used to do; so I marked out
a larger piece of land, and began the fence in the same man-
ner as before, in which Friday not only worked very willingly
and very hard, but did it very cheerfully, and I told him wbat
it was for, that it was for corn to make more bread, because
lie was now with me, and that I might have enough for him
and myself too. He appeared very sensible of that part, and
let me know that he thought 1 had much more labour upon
me on his account, than 1 had for myself, and that he would
Vork the harder for me, if I would tell him what to do.
This was the pleasantest year of all theMife I led in this
place. Friday began to talk pretty well, and understand the
names of almost every thing I had occasion to call for, and of
every place I had to send him to, and talk a great deal to
me; so that, in short, 1 began now to have some use for
my tongue again, which indeed I had very little occasion for
before; that is too say, about speech. Besides the pleasure of
talking to him, I had a singular satisfaction in the fellow him-
self: his simple, unfeigned honesty appeared to me more and
more every day, and I began really to love the creature; and
on his side, I believe he loved me more than it was possible
for him ever to love any thing before.
I had a mind once to try if he had any hankering inclination
to his own country again; and having learned him English so
.well, that he could answer me almost any questions, 1 asked
him whether the nation that he belonged to never conquered
in battle At which he smiled, and said, 'Yes, yes; we al-
™> fight the betteiv' that is, he meant, always gel the better
in fight- and so we began the following discourse. 'You al-
wnvs fight the better!' said I: ' How came you to be taken
prisoner then, Friday?'
Tritiny. My nation beat jnuch for all that,
Master. How teat? If your nation beat them, how came
yon to be taken? .
Friday. They more than my nation in the plaoe where me
was: they take one, two, three, and me. my nation Over-
heat them in yonder place, where me no was: there my nation
take one, two, great thousand.
Master. But why did not your side recover you from the-
hands of your enemies then?
Fritlay. They ran one, two, three, and me, and make
go in the canoe; my nation have no canoe that time.
Mclster. Well, Friday, and what does your nation do with
the men they take? Do they carry them away, and eat them,
as these did?
Friday. Yes, my nation eat mans too, eat all up.
Matter. Where do they carry them?
Friday. Go to other place where they think.
Master. Do they come hither?
Friday. Yes, yes, they come hither; come other else place.
Master. Have you been here with them?
Friday. Yes, I been here. (Points to the N. W. side of
the island, which it seems was their side.)
By this I understood that my man Friday had formerly
been among the savages, who used to come on shore, on the
farther part of the island, on the said man-eating occasions
that he was now brought for; and some time after, when I
took courage to carry him to that side, being the same I
formerly mentioned, he presently knew the place, and told
me, he was there once when they eat up twenty men, two
women, and one child: he could not tell twenty in English,
but he numbered them by laying so many stones in a row,
and pointing to me to tell them over.
I have told this passage, because it introduces what follows:
that, after I had had this discourse with him, I asked him
how far it was from our island to the shore, and whether the
canoes were not often lost He told me there was no danger,
no canoes ever lost, but that, after a little way out to sea,
there was a current, and a wind always one way in the morn-
ing, the other in the afternoon.
This I understood to be no more than the sets of the tide, as
going out, or coming in; but I afterwards understood it was occa-
sioned by the great draught and reflux of the mighty river Oroo-
noque) in the mouth of which river, as I thought afterwards
oar island lay; and that this land, which I perceived to the W.
. and N. XV. was the great island of Trinidad, on the north
point of the mouth of the river. I asked Friday a thousand
questions about the country, the inhabitants, the sea, the
coast, and what nations were near: he told me all he knew,
with the greatest openness imaginable. I asked him the
names of the several nations of his sort of people, but could
get no other name than Caribs; from whence I easily under-
stood, that these were the Caribbees, which our maps place
on that part of America which reaches from the mouth of
the river Oroonoque to Guiana, and onwards to St. Martha.
He told me that up a great way beyond the moon, that was,
beyond the setting 01 the moon, which must be west from
their country, there dwelt white, bearded men, like me, and
pointed to my great whiskers, which I mentioned before;
and that they had killed much mans', that was his word.
By all which I understood he meant the Spaniards, whose
cruelties in America had been spread over the whole coun-
tries, and were remembered by all nations from father to son.
I inquired if he could tell me how I might come from this
island, and get among those white men; he told me, yes, yes,
I might go in ' two canoe ' I could not understand what he
meant by ' two canoe/ till at last, with great difficulty. I found
he meant, that it must be in a large, great boat, as big as two
canoes.
This part of. Friday's discourse began to relish with me
very well; and from this time I entertained some hopes. that,
one time or other, I might find an opportunity to make my
escape from this place, and that this poor savage might be a
means to help me to do it
During the long time that Friday had now been with me,
and that he began to speak to me, and understand me, I was
not wanting to lay a foundation of religious knowledge in his
mind; particularly 1 asked him one time, who made him.
The poor creature did not understand me at all, but thought
1 had asked him who was his father. But I took it by ano-
ther handle, and'asked him, who made the sea, the ground
lie walked on, and the hills and woods. He told me, it was
one old Benamuckee, that lived beyond all. He could describe
nothing of this great person, but that he was very old; much.
older, he said, than the sea or the land, than (he moon or the
atars. 1 asked him then, if this old person had made all.
things, why did not all things worship him. He looked very
grave, and with a perfect look of innocence, said, 'All things
said O to him.' I asked him if the people who die in his
country went away any where. He said, yes, they all went
to Benamuckee. Then I asked him, whether those they eat
up went thither too: he said, 'Yes.'
From these things I began to instruct him in the knowledge
of the trae God, I told him, that the great Maker of all
things lived up there, pointing up towards heaven: that he
governs the world by the same power and providence by
which he had made it: that he was omnipotent, could do
every thing for us, give every thing to us, take every thing
from us; and thus, by degrees I opened his eyes. He listen-
ed with great attention, and received with pleasure the no-
tion of Jesus Christ being sent to redeem us, and of the
manner of making our prayers to God, and his being able to
hear us, even into heaven. He told me one day, that if our
God could hear us up beyond the sun, he must needs be a
greater God than their Benamuckee, who lived but a little
way off, and yet could not hear, till they went up to the
great mountains where he dwelt, to speak to him. I asked
him, if ever he went thither to speak to him: he said, no;
they never went that were young men; none went thither
but the old men, whom he called their Oowokakee, that is,
as I made him explain it to me, their religious, or clergy;
and that they went to say O (so he called saying prayers),
and (hen came back, and told them what Benamuckee said.
By this I observed, that there is priestcraft even amongst
the most blinded ignorant Pagans in the world; and the poli-
ty of making a secret religion, in order to preserve the vene-
ration of the people to the clergy, is not only to be found in
the Roman, but perhaps among all l'eligions in the world,
even among the most brutish and barbarous savages.
I endeavoured to clear up this fraud to my man Friday,
and told him, that the pretence of their old men going up to
the mountains to say O to their god Benamuckee, was a cheat;
and their bringing word from thence what he said, was much
'.more so; that if they met with any answer, or spoke with any
one there, it must be with an evil spirit: and then I entered
into a long discourse with him about the devil, the original ot
him; his rebellion against God, his enmity to man, the reason
of it, his setting himself up in the dark parts of the world to.
be worshipped instead of- God, and as God, and the many
stratagems he made use of, to delude mankind to their ruin;
how he had a secret access to our passions, and to our affec-
tions, to adapt his snares so to our inclinations, as to cause us
even to be our own tempters, and to run upon our own de-
struction, by our own choice.
I found it was not so easy to imprint right notions in his
mind about the devil, as it was about the being of a God.
Nature assisted all my arguments to evidence to him even
the necessity of a great First Cause, and over-ruling, gov-
erning power, a secret, directing providence, and of the equity
and justice of paying homage to him that made us, and the
like: but there appeared nothing of all this in the notion of an
evil spirit, of his original, his being, his nature, and, above
all, of his inclination to do evil, and to draw us in to do so too.
And the poor creature puzzled me once in such a manner,
by a question merely natural and mnocent, that I scarce knew
what to say to him. I had been talking a great deal to him
of the power of God; his omnipotence, his dreadful aversion
to sin, his being a consuming fire to the workers of iniquity;
how, as he had made us all, he could destroy us, and all the
world, in a moment: and he listened with great seriousness
to me all the while.
After this, I had been telling him how the devil was God's
enemy in the hearts of men, and used all his malice and skill
to defeat the good designs of Providence. and to ruin the
kingdom of Christ in ihe world, and the like: * Well,' says
Friday, 'but you say, God is so strong, so great, is he not
much strong, much might, as the devil?' ' Yes, yes,' said I,
' Friday, God is stronger than the devil, God is above the
devil, and therefore we pray to God to tread him under our
feet, and enable us to resist his temptations, and quench his
fiery darts,'' Hut,' says he again, 'if God much strong, much
might, as the devil, why God not kill the devil so make him
no more wicked.
I was strangely surprised at his question, and after all,
though I was now an old man, yet I was but a young doctor,
and ill enough qualified for a casuist, or a solver of difficul-
ties: and, at first, I could not tell what to say; so I pretend-
ed not to hear him, and asked him what he said. But he
was too earnest for an answer to forget his question, so that
he repeated it in the very same broken words as above. By
this time I had recovered myself a little, and I said,' God will
at last punish him severely, he is reserved for the judgment,
and is to be cast into the bottomless pit, to dwell with ever-
lasting tire.' This did not satisfy Friday; but he returns upon
me, repeating'my words,' Reserve at last! me no understand.
But why not kill the devil now, not kill great ago?' ' You
may as well ask me,' said I, ' why God does not kill you and
me, when we do wicked things here that offend him; we are
preserved to repent and be pardoned' He muses awhile
at this: ' Well, well,' sayshe, mighty affectionately,' that well,
so you, I, devil, all wicked, all preserve, repent, God pardon
all.' Here I was run down again by him to the last degree,
and it was a testimony to me, how the mere notions of nature,
though they will guide reasonable creatures to the knowledge
of a God, and of a worship or homage due to the supreme
1 being of God, as the consequence of our nature; yet nothing
but divine revelation can form the knowledge of Jesus Christ,
and of a redemption purchased for us, of a mediator, of a new
covenant, and of an intercessor at the footstool of God's throne;
I say, nothing but a revelation from heaven can form these in
the soul; and that therefore the Gospel of our Lor-d and Sa-
viour Jesus Christ, 1 mean, the word of God, and the Spirit
of God, promised for the guide and sanctifier of his people,.
and the absolutely necessary instructors of the souls of men
in the saving knowledge of God, and the means of salvation.
I therefore diverted the^re'ient discourse between me and
my man, raising up hastily, as upon some sudden occasion of
going out; then sending him for something a great way off, I
seriously prayed to God that he would enable me to instruct
savingly this poor savage, assisting by his Spirit the heart of
the poor ignorant creature to receive the light ofthe know-
ledge of God in Christ, reconciling hint to himself, and would
guide me to speak so to him from the word of God, as his
conscience might be convinced, his eyes opened, and his soul
saved. When he came again to me, I entered into a long
discourse with him upon the subject of the redemption of man
by the Saviour of the world, and of the doctrine of the Gospel
preached from heaven, viz. of repentance towards God, and
faith in our blessed Lord Jesus. I then explained to him, as
well h> I could, why our blessed Redeemer took not on him
the nature of angels, but the seed of Abraham, and how, for
that reason, the fallen angels had no share in the redemption;
that he came only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel,
and the like.
I had, God knows, more sincerity than knowledge, in all
the methods I took for this poor creature's instruction; and
must acknowledge what I believe all that act upon the same
principle will find, that, in laying things open to him, I really
informed and instructed myself in many things that either I
did not know, or had not fully considered before; but which
occurred naturally to my mind, upon my searching into them
for the information of this poor savage; and I had more affec-
tion in my inquiry after things upon this occasion, than ever
I felt before; so that whether this poor wild wretch was the
better for me or no, I had great reason to be thankful that
ever he came to me; my grief sat lighter upon me, my habi-
tation grew comfortable to me beyond measure; and when I
reflected, that, in this solitary life, which I had been confined
to, I had not only been moved myself to look up to heaven,
and to seek the Hand that brought me thither, but was now
to me made an instrument, under Providence, to save the
life, and for aught I knew, the soul, of a poor savage, and bring
him to the true knowledge of religion, and of the Christian
doctrine, that he might know Christ Jesus, 'to know whom
is life eternal;' I say, when I reflected upon all these things, a
secret joy ran through every part of my soul, and I frequent-
ly rejoiced that ever I was brought to th'is place, which I had
often thought the most dreadful of all afflictions that could
possibly have befallen me.
In this thankful frame I continued all the remainder of my
time; and the conversation which employed the hours between
Friday and me was such as made the three years, which we
lived there together perfectly and completely happy, if any
such thing as complete happiness can be found in a sublunary
state. The savage was now a good Christian; a much better
than I: though 1 have reason to hope, and bless God for it,
that we were equally penitent, and comforted restored peni-
tents. We had here the word of God to read, and no farther
off from his Spirit to instruct than if we had been in England.
I always applied myself to reading the Scripture, and to
let him know, as well as I could, the meaning of what I read,
and he again, by bis serious inquiries and questions, made me,
as I said before, a much better scholar in the scripture-
knowledge than I should ever have been by my own mere
private reading. Another thing I cannot refrain from ob-
serving here also, from experience, in this retired part of my
life; viz. how infinite and inexpressible a ble9sing it is, that
the knowledge of God, and of the doctrine of salvation by
Christ Jesus, is so plainly laid down in the word of God, so
easy to be received and understood, that as the bare reading
the Scripture made me capable of understanding enough of
my duty to carry me directly on to the great work of sincere
repentance for my sins, and laying hold of a Saviour for life
and salvation, to a stated reformation in practice, and obedi-
ence to all God's commands, and this without any teacher
or instructor (I mean human); so the same plain instruction
sufficiently served to the enlightening this savage creature,
and bringing him to become such a Christian, as I have
known few equal to him in my life.
As to the disputes, wranglings, strife, and contention,
which has happened in the world about religion, whether
niceties in doctrines, or schemes of Cliurch government. they
were all perfectly useless to us, as, for aught I can yet see,
they have been to all the rest in the world. We had the
sure guide to heaven, viz. the word of God; and we had, bles-
sed be God! comfortable views of the Spirit of God, teaching
and instructing us by his word, leading us into all truth, and
making us both willing and obedient to the instruction of his
word; and I cannot see the least use that the greatest know-
ledge of the disputed points in religion, which have made such
confusion in the world, would have been to us, if wc could
have obtained it. but I must go on with the historical part
of things, and take every part in its order
After Friday and 1 became more intimately acquainted,
and that he could understand almost all I said to him, and
speak fluently, though in broken English, to me, 1 acquainted
him with my own story, or at le:ist as much of it as related to
my coming into the place. how I had lived there, and how
long. I let him into the mystery (for such it was to him) of
gunpowder and bullet, and taught him how to shoot I gave
him a knife, which he was wonderfully delighted with, and I
made him a belt with a frog hanging to it, such as in England
xwe wear hangers in; and, in the frog instead of a hanger, I
gave him a hatchet, which was not only as good a weapon in
some cases, but much more useful upon many occasions.
I described to him the countries of Europe, and particulav-
It
1y England, which I came from, how we lived, how we wbfe
shipped God, how we behaved to one another, and how we
traded in ships to all parts of the world. I gave him an ac-
count of the wreck which I had been on board of, and showed
him, as near as I could, the place where she lay, but she was
all beaten in pieces long before, and quite gone.
I showed him the ruins of our boat, which we lost when I
escaped, and which I could not stir with my whole strength
then, but was now fallen almost to pieces. Upon seeing this
boat, Friday stood musing a great while, and said nothing.
I asked him what it was he studied upon; at last, says he,
• Me see such boat like come to place at my nation.'
I did not understand him a good while; but, at last, when I
had examined further into it, I understood by him, that a boat,
such as that had been, came on shore upon the country wher6
he lived; that is, as he explained it, was driven thither by
stress of weather. I presently imagined, that some European
ship must have been cast away upon their coast, and the boat
might get loose, and drive ashore; but was so dull that I ne-
ver once thought of men making escape from a wreck thither,
much less whence they might come; so 1 only inquired after
ft description of the boat-
Friday described the boat to me well enough; but brought
me better to understand him, when he added, with some
-warmth, ' We save the white mans from drown.' Then I
presently asked him, if there were any white mans, as he
called theiu, in the boat: ' Yes,'he said,' the boat full of
white mans.' I asked him, ' How many?' He told upon his
fingers seventeen I asked him then, ' What became of
them?' He told me,' They live, they dwell at my nation.'
This put new thoughts into my head again; for I presently
imagined, that these might be the men belonging to the ship
that was cast away in sight of my island, as I now call it; and
who, after the ship was struck on the rock, and they saw
her inevitably lost, had saved themselves in their boat, and
were landed upon that wild shore, among the savages.
Upon this, 1 inquired of him more critically, what was be-
come of them' he assured me they lived still there: that they
had been there about four years; that the savages let them
alone, and gave them victuals to live. I asked him, how it
came to pass they did not kill them, and eat them He said,
* No, they make brother with them;' that is, as I understood
him; a truce: and then he added, ' They no eat mans, hut
-when make the war fight;' that is to say, they never eat any
men, but such as come to fight with them, and are taken in
battle.
It was after this some considerable time, that being on the
top of the hill, at the east side of the island, from whence, as
I have said, I had, in a clear day, discovered the main or con-
tinent of America; Friday, the weather being very serene,
looks very earnestly towards the main land, and, in a kind of
surprise, falls ajnmping and dancing, and calls out to me, for
I was at some distance from him: I asked him what was the
matter. ' O joy !' says he,' O glad! There see my country!
there my nation!'
I observed an extraordinary sense of pleasure appeared in
Jiisface, and his eyes sparkled, and his countenance diseoyer-
ed a strange eagerpess, as if he had a mind to be in his own
country again; and this observation of mine put a great muny
thoughts into me, which made me at first not so easy about my
new man Friday, as I was before; and I made no doubt, but
that if Friday could get back to disown nation again, he would
not only forget all die religion; but all his obligation to me; and
would be forward enough to give his countrymen an account
of me, and come back, perhaps, with a hundred or two of
them, and make a feast upon me, at which he might be as
merry as he used to be with those of his enemies, when they
were taken in war.
But I wronged the poor honest creature very much, for
which I was very sorry afterwards: however, as my jealousy
increased, and held me some weeks, I was a little more cir-
cumspect, and not so familiar and kind to him as before, in
which I was certainly in the wrong too, the honest, grateful
ererture having no thought about it, but what consisted of
the best principles, both as a religious Christian, and as a
grateful friend, as appeared afterwards to my full satisfaction.
Whilst my jealousy of him lasted, you may be sure I was
every day pumping him to see if he would discover any of
the new thoughts, which I suspected were in bim; but I found
every thing he said was honest, and so innocent, that I could
find nothing to nourish my suspicion; and, in spite of all my
uneasiness, he made me at last entirely dis own again; nor
did he in tde least perceive, that I was uneasy; and therefore
I could not suspect him of deceit.-
One day walking up the same hill, but the weather being
hazy at sea, so thai we could not see the continent, I called
to him, and said, 'Friday, do not you wish yourself in your
owu country, your own nation'' 'Yes', he said, 1 be much
0 glad to be at my own nation.' 'What would you do
there', said I: 'would you turn wild again, eat man's flesh
again, and be a savage as you were before? He looked full
of concern, and shaking his head, said, 'No, no; Friday tell,
ihem to live good, tell them to pray God, tell them to eat
corn-bread, cattle flesh, milk: no eat man again.' 'Why
then,' said I to him, 'they will kill you' He looked
grave at that. and then said, 'No, they no kill me; they wil-
ling, love learn.' He meant by this, they would be willing to
learn: he added, they learned much of the bearded mans that
came in the bont. Then I asked him if he would go back to
them He smiled at that, and told me he could not swim so
far I told him I would make a canoe for him. He told me
he would go, if 1 would go with him. I go!' said I, 'why
they will eat me, if I come there.' 'No, no,'says he,'me
make them no eat you: me make they much love you.' He
meant he would tell them how I had killed his enemies, and
saved his life, and so he would make them love me. Then he
told me, as well as he could, how kind they were to seven"
teen white men, or bearded men, as he called them, who
came on shore there in distress.
From this time, I confess, I had a mind to venture over,
and see if I could possibly jom with these bearded men, who,
1 made no doubt, were Spaniards or Portuguese; not doubting
but, if I could, we might find some method to escape from
thence, being upon the continent, and a good company to-
gether, belter than I could from an island, forty miles off the
shore, and alone without help. So, after some days, 1 took
Friday to work agam, by way of discourse; and told him, I
would give hmj a boat to go back ti his own nation: and ac-
cordingly I carried him to my frigate, which lay on the other
side of the island, and having cleared it of water I for I always
kept it sunk m the water) I brought it out, showed it him,
and we both went into it.
I found he was a most dexterous follow at managing it,
would make it p., almost as swift and fast again as I could; so
when he was in I said to him, 'Well, now, Friday, shall we
go to your nation?' He looked very dull at my" saying so.
which, it seems, was because he thought the boat too small
to go so far. I told him then I had a bigger; so the next
day, I went to the place where the first boat lay which I
had made, but which I could not get into the water. tie
said that was big enough; but then, as ( had taken no care of
it, and it had lain two or three and-twenty years there, the
sun had split and dried it, that it was in a manner rotten.
-Friday told me that sucli a boat would do very well, and
would carry ' much enough vitile, drink, bread;' that was his
way of talking
Upon the whole, I was by this time so fixed upon my de-
sign of going over with him to the continent; that I told him
we would go and make one as big as that, and he should go
home in it. He answered not one word, but looked very
grave and sad. I asked him what was the matter with him.
He asked me agam thus, ' Why you angry mad with Friday.''
* What me done?' I asked him what he meant: I told him I was
not angry with him at all. • No angry! no angry!' says he, re-
peatingthe words several times; 'Why send Friday homeaway
to my nation?' ' Why,' said I, ' Friday did you not say you
wished you were there?'' Yes, yes,' sa) s he,' wish be both there;
no wish Friday there, no master there.' In a word he would
not think of going there without me. ' I go there, Friday!' said
I: ' what should i do there?* He turned very quick upon me at
this;' You do great deal much good,' says he; ' you teach wild
mans be good, sober, tame mans. you tell them know God, pray
God, and live new life.' ' Alas, Friday,'said I,' thou knowest
not what thou sayest. I am but an ignorant man myself.'' Yes,
yes, says he,' you teachee me good, you teachee them good.'
' No, no, Friday,' said I, ' you shall go without me; leave me
here to live by myself, as I did before. He looked confused
again at that word; and, running to one of the hatchets which
he used to wear, he takes it up hastily, and gives it me.
• What must I do with this?' said I to him. ' You take kill
Friday,' says he. ' What must I kill you for?' said I again.
He returns very qnick, * What you send Friday away for?
Take kill Friday. no send Friday away.' This he spoke so
earnestly, that I saw tears stand in his eyes. In a word, I so
plainly discovered the utmost affectiou in him to me, and a
firm resolution in him, that I told him then, and often after,
that I would never send him away from me, if he wa9 willmg
4o stay with me. ,

\
Upon the -whole, as I found, by all his discourse, a settled
affection to me, and that nothing should part him from mc,
so 1 found all the foundation of his desire to go to his own
country was laid in his ardent affection to the people, and his
hopes of my doing them good; a thing, which as I had no no-
tion of myself, so I had not the least thought, or intention, or
desire of undertaking it But still I found a strong inclination
to my attempting an escape,. as above, founded on the suppo-
sition gathered from the former discourse; viz. that there
were seventeen bearded men there; and, therefore, without
any more delay, I went to work with Friday, to find out a
great tree proper to fell, and make a large periagua, or canoe,
to undertake the voyage. There were trees enough in the
island to have built a little fleet, not of periagnas and canoes
only, but even of good large vessels; but the main thing I looked
at, was to get one so near the water, that we might lanch it in
when it was made, to avoid the mistake 1 committed at first.
At last Friday pitched upon a tree;.for I found he knew
much better than 1 what Kind of wood was fittest for it; nor
can I tell, to this day, what wood to call the tree we cut
down, except that it was very like the tree we call fustie, or
between that and the Nicaragua wood, for it was much of the
same colour and smell. Friday was for burning the hollow or
cavity of this tree but, to make it into a boat: bull showed him
how rather to cut it out with tools, which after 1 showed him
how to use, he did it very handily; and, in about a month's
hard labour, we finished it, and made it very handsome, es-
pecially when with our axes, which I showed him how to
handle, we cut and hewed the outside into the true shape of
a boat. \fter this, however, it cost us near a fortnight's
time to get her along, as it were, inch by inch, upon great
rollers, into the water; but when she was in, she would have
carried twenty men with great ease.
When she was in the water, and though she Was so big, it
amazed me to see with what dexterity and how swift my
man Friday would manage - her, turn her, and paddle her
along So I asked him if he would, and if we might, venture
over in her; 'Yes,' he said, 'me venture over in her very well,
though great blow wind.' However, I had a farther design.
that he knew nothing of, and that was to make a mast and.
a sail, and to fit her with an anchor and cable. As to a mast,
that was easy enough to get; sn I pitched upon a straight
joung cedar-tree, which I found near the place, and which
there was great plenty of in the island; and I set Friday to
work to cut it down, and gave him directions how to shape
and order it; lmt as to the sail, that was my particular care.
I knew I had old sails, or rather pieces of old sails enough,
tmt as I hail had them now twenty-six years by me, and
Itad not been very careful to preserve them, not imagining
that 1 should ever have this kind of use for them, I did not
doubt but they were all rotten; and mdeed most of them
were so. However, I found two pieces which appeared
pretty good, and with those I went to work; and with a
great deal of pains, and awkward tedious stitching (you may
lie. sure) for want of needles, I at length made a three-cor-
nered ugly thing, like what we call in England a shoulder-of-
jautton sail, to go with a boom at bottom, and a little short
sprit at the top, such as usually our ships' long-boats sail with,
and such as 1 best knew how to manage, because it was such
a one as I used in the boat in which I made my escape from
Barbary, as related in the first part of my story.
I was near two months performing this last work; viz. rig-
ging and fitting my mast and sails; for I finished them very
complete, making a small stay, and a sail or foresail to
it, to assist, if we should turn to windward: and, which
.was more than all, I fixed a rudder to the stern of her, to
steer with; and though I was but a bungling shipwright, yet
as I knew the usefulness and even necessity of such a thing,
I applied myself with so much pains to do it, that at last I
Brought it to pass; though, considering the many dull con-
trivances I had for it that failed, I think it cost me almost as
much labour as making the boat.
After all this was done, I had my man Friday to teach as
to what belonged to the navigation of my boat; for though he?
knew very well how to paddle the canoe, he knew nothing
what belonged to a sail and a rudder, and was the most
amazed when he saw me work the boat toand-agiiin in the
sea, by the rudder, and how the sail gibbed, aad filled this
way or that way, as the;course we sailed changed; I say, when
he saw this, he stood like one astonished and amazed. How-
ever, with a little use, I made all these'things familiar to him,
and he became an expert sailor, except that as to the compass,
I could make him understand very little; of that; on the
other hand, as there was very little cloudy weather, and seV
dom or never any fogs in those parts. there was the less oc-
casion for a compass, seeing the stars were always to be seen
by night, and the shore by day, except in the rainy seasons;
and then noboch cared to stir abroad, either by land or sea.
I was now entered on the seven-and twentieth year of my
captivity in this place; though the three last years that I had
this creature with me ought rather to be left out of the ac-
count, my habitation being quite of another kind, than in all
the rest of the time. I kept the aniversary of my landing
here, with the same thankfulness to God for his mercies as
at first; and if I had such cause of acknowledgment at first,
I had much more so now, having such. additional testimonies
of the oare of Providence over me, and the great hopes I had
of being effectually and speedily delivered: for I had an in-
vincible impression upon my thoughts, that my deliverance
was at hand, and that I should not be another year in
this place However, I went on with my husbandry, dig-
ging, planting, fencing, as usual; I gathered and cured my
grapes, and did every necessary thing, as before.
The ramy season was in the mean time upon me, when I
kept more within doors than at other times; so I had stowed
qur new vessel as secure as we could, bringing her up into
the creek, where, as I said in the beginning, I landed my
rafts from the ship: and hauling her up to the shore, at high-
water mark, I made my man Friday dig a little dock, just
big enough to hold her, and just deep enough to give her
water enough to float in; and then when the tide was out, we
made a strong dam cross the end of it, to keep the water
out; and so she lay dry, as to the tide from the sea; and
to keep the rain off, we laid a great many boughs of trees
so thick, that she was as well thatched as a house: and thus
we wailed for the months of November and December in
which I designed to make my adventure.
When the settled season began to come in, as the thought
of my design returned with the fair weather, I was preparing
daily for the voyage; and the lirst thing I did was to lay by a
certain quantity of provisions, being the stores for our voyage;
and intended, in a week or a fortnight's time, to open the
dock, and lanch out our boat. I was busy one morning upon
something of this kind, when I called to Friday, and bade
him go to the sea-shore, and see if he could find a turtle, or
tortoise, a thing which we generally got once a week, for the
suit: of the eggs, as well as the flesh. Friday had not been
long gone, when he cajne running back, and flew over my
outward wall, or fence, like one that felt not the ground, or
the steps he set his feet on; and before I had time to speak
to liim, he cried out to me,' O master! O master1. O sorrow!
Obad!' 'What's the matter, Friday?' saidl. 'O yonder
there,' says he, ' one, two, three canoe! one, two, three!' By
this way of speaking, I concluded there were six; but, on
inquiry, I found there were hut three. ' Well, Friday,' said
J, ' do not be frighted:' so I heartened him up as well as 1
could. However, I saw the poor fellow was most terribly
scared; for nothing ran in his head but that they were come
to look for him, and would cut him in pieces, and eat him;
and the poor fellow trembled so, that I scarce knew what to
do with him. I comforted him as well as I could, and told
Iiim I was in as much danger as he, and that they would eat
me as well as him. ' But,' said I, ' Friday, we must resolve
to fight them. Can you fight, Friday?' ' Me shoot,' says he;
' but there come many great number.' ' No matter for that,'
said I again, ' our guns will fright them that we do not kill,'
So I asked him, whether, if I resolved to defend him, he
would defend me, and stand by me, and do just as 1 bade
him. lie said. ' Me die, when you bid die Masterj' So I
went and fetched a good dram of rum, and gave him; for I
had been so good a husband »f my rum, that 1 had a great
deal left. When he had drank it, I made him take the two
fowling-pieces, which we always carried, and load them with
large swan-shot, as big as small pistol-bullets: then I took
four muskets, and loaded them with two slugs, and five
small bullets each; and my two pistols I loaded with a brace
of bullets each. I hung my great sword, as usual, naked
by niy side, and gave Friday his hatchet.
When f had thus prepared myself, I took my perspective
glass, and went up to the side of the hill, to sec what I eould
discover, and I found quickly, by my glass, that there were
©ne-and-twenty savages, three prisoners, and three canoes;
and that their whole business seemed to be the trinmphant
banquet upon these three human bodies (a barbarous feast in-
deed!); hut nothing more than as I had observed was usual
with them.
I observed also, that they were landed, not where they had
done when Friday made his escape, but nearer to my creek,
where the shore was low, and where a thick wood came close
almost down to the sea. This, with the abhorrence of the
inhuman errand these wretches came about, so filled me with
indignation, that I came down again to Friday, and told him
I was resolved to go down to them, and kill them all; and
asked him if he would stand by me He had now gotten over
his fright, and his spirits being a little raised with the dram I
had given him, he was very cheerful; and told me, as before,
' he would die, when I bid die'
In this fit of fury, I took first and divided the arms which.
I had charged, as before, between us: I gave Friday one pis-
tol to stick in his girdle, and three guns upon his shoulder;
and I took one pistol, and the other three myself; and in this
posture we marched out. I took a small bottle of rum in my
pocket, and gave Friday a large bag with more powder and
bullet: and as to orders, I charged him to keep close behind
me, and not to stir, or shoot, or do any thing till I bade him;
and, in the meantime, not to speak a word. In this posture
I fetched a compass to my right hand of near a mile, as well
to get over the creek as to get into the wood; so that I might
come within shot of them, before I should be discovered,
which I had seen by my glass it was easy to do.
While I was making this march, my former thoughts re-
turning, I began to abate my resolution. I do not mean that
I entertained any fear of their number: for as they were
naked, unarmed wretches, it if certain I was superior to
them; nay, though I had been alone: but it occurred to my
thoughts, what call, what occasion, much less what necessity
I was in to go and dip my hands in blood, to attack people
who had neither done nor intended me any wrong; who,
as to me, were innocent, and whose barbarous customs were
their own disaster, being in them a token indeed of God's
having left them, with the other nations of that part of
the world, to such stupidity, and to such inhuman courses;
but did not call me to take upon me to be a judge of their ac-
tions, much less an executioner of his justice: that whenever-
he thought fit, he would take the cause into his own hands,
and, by national vengeance, punish them for national crimes;
hut that in the mean time, it was none of my business: that it
was true, Friday might justify it, because he was a declared
enemy, and in a state of war with those very particular
people, and it was lawful for him to attack them; but I
could not say the same with respect to me. These things
.were so warmly pressed upon my thoughts all the way »»
I went, that I resolved I would only go and place myself near
them, that I might observe their barbarous feast, and that I
would act then as God should direct; but that, unless some-
thing offered that was more a call to me than yet I knew of, I
would not meddle with them.
With this resolution I entered the wood, and with all pos-
sible wariness aud silence (Friday following close at my
heels,) I marched till I came to the skirt of the wood, on
the side which was next to them; only that one corner of the
wood lay between me and them. Here I called softly to Fri-
day, and showing him a great tree, which was just at the cor-
ner of the wood, I bade him go to the tree, and bring me
word if he could see there plainly what they were doiug.
He did so. and came immediately back to me, and told me
they might be plainly viewed there; that they were all about
the fire, eating the flesh of one of their prisoners; and
that another lay bound upon the sand, a little from them,
whom, he said, they would kill next, and which fired the
very soul within me. He told me it was not one of their
nation, but one of the bearded men whom he had told
me of, that came to their country in the boat. I was filled
with horror at the very naming the white, bearded man; and,
going to the tree, 1 saw plainly, by my glass, a white man,
who lay upon the beach of the sea, with his hands and his
fret tied with flags, or things like rushes: and that he was an
European, and had clothes on.
There was another tree, and a little thicket beyond it,
about fifty yards nearer to them than the place where I was,
which, by going a little way about. I saw I might come at un-
discovered, and that then 1 should be within half shot of
them. So I withheld my passion; though I was indeed en-
raged to the highest degree; and. going back about twenty
paces, I got behind some bushes, which held all the way till
I came to the other tree, and then I came to a little rising
ground, which gave me a full view of them, at the distance
of about eighty yards.
I had now not a moment to lose; for nineteen of Ihe dread-
ful wretches sat upon the ground, all close huddled together,
and had just sent the other two to butcher the poor Christian,
aud bring him, perhaps, limb by limb, to their fire, and they
\
were stooped down to untie the bands at his feet. I turned
to Friday: ' Now, Friday,' said I, ' do as I bid thee. Friday
said he would. ' Then, Friday,' said I, ' do exactly as you
see me do; fail in nothing.' So I set down one of the mus-
kets, and the fowling-piece, upon the ground, and Friday
did the like by his; and with the other musket I took my aim
at the savages, bidding him to do the like: then asking him if
he was ready, he said,' Yes.' ' Then fire at them,' said I;
and the same moment I fired also.
Friday took his aim so much better than I, that, on the
side that he shot, he killed two of them, and wounded three
more;. and, on my side, I killed one, and wounded two.
They were, you may be sure, in a dreadful consternation;
and all of them, who were not hurt, jumped up upon their
feet immediately, but did not know which way to run, or
which way to look; for they knew not from whence their des-
truction came. Friday kept his eyes close upon me, that, as
I had bid him, he might observe what I did: so, as soon as
the first shot was made, I threw down the piece, and took up
the fowling-piece, and Friday did the like: he sees me cock
and present: he did the same again. ' Are you ready, Fri-
day?' said I. * Yes,' said he. ' Let fly, then,' said 1, ' in the
name of God;' and with that I fired again among the amazed
wretches, and so did Friday; and as our pieces were now
loaded with what I called swan-shot, or small pistol bullets, we
found only~iwo drop; but so many were wounded, that they
ran about yelling and screaming like mad creatures, all bloody
and miserably wounded, most of them; whereof three more
fell quickly after, though not quite dead.
' Now, Friday,' said I, laying down the discharged pieces,
and taking up the musket, which was yet loaded, * follow
me,' said I; which he did, with a deal of courage; upon
which 1 rushed out of the wood, and showed myself, anil
Friday close at my foot. As soon as I perceived they saw me,
I shouted as loud as 1 could, and bade Friday do so too; and
running as fast as I could, which, by the way, was not very
fast, being loaded with arms as I was, I made directly to-
wards the poor victim, who was, as I said, lying upon the
beach or shore, between the place where they sat, and the
sea. The two butchers, who were just going to work with
him, had left him, at the surprise of our first fire, and fled, in
a terrible fright, to the sea-side, and had jumped into a
?
canoe, and three more of the rest made the same way. I
turned to Friday, and bade him step forwards, and fire at
them, he understood me immediately, and, running about
forty yards to be near them, he shot at them, and I thought
he had killed them all; for I saw them all fall on a heap in
the boat; though I saw two of them up again quickly: how-
ever; he killed two of them, and wounded the third, so that
he laid down in the bottom of the boat, as if he had been
dead.
While my man Friday fired at them, I pulled out my
knife, and cut the flags that bound the poor victim; and, loos-
ing his hands and feet, I lifted him up, and asked him, in
the Portuguese tongue, what he was. He answered, in
Latin, ' Christianus;' but was so weak and faint, that he it
could scarce stand, or speak. I took my bottle out of my
pocket, and gave it him, makmg signs that he should drink,
which he did; and I gave him a piece of bread, which he eat.
Then I asked him what countryman he was; and he said,
' Espagnole;' and, being a little recovered, let me know, by
all the' signs he could possibly make, how much he was in my
debt for his deliverance. ' Seignior/ said I, with as much
Spanish as I could make up, ' we will talk afterwards, but
we must fight now: if you have any strength left, take this
pistol and sword, and lay about you.' He took them very
thankfully, and no sooner.had he the arms in his hands, but,
as if they had put new vigour into him, he flew upon his mur-
derers, like a fury, and had cut two of them in pieces in an in-
stant; for the truth is, as the whole was a surprise to them,
so the poor creatures were so much frighted with the noise of
our pieces, that they fell down for mere amazement and fear,
and bad no more power to attempt their own escape, than
their flesh had to resist our shot; and that was the case of
those five that Friday shot at in the boat; for as three of
them fell with the hurt they received, so the other two fell
with the fright.
I kept my piece in my hand still, without firing, being wil-
ling to keep my charge ready, because I had given the
Spaniard my pistol and sword; so I called to Friday, and bade
him run up to the tree from whence we first fired, and fetch
the arms which lay there, that had been discharged, which
'he did with great swiftness, and then giving him my mus-
ket, I sat down myself to load all the rest again, and bade
them come to me when they wanted. While I was loading
these pieces, tuere happened a fierce engagement between
the Spaniard and one of the savages, who made at him with
one of their great wooden swords, the same weapon that was
to kill him before, if I had not prevented it. The Spaniard,
who was as bold and as brave as could be imagined, though
weak, had fought this Indian a good while, and had cut him
two great wounds on his head: but the savage being a stout,
lusty fellow, closing in with him, had thrown him down (be-
ing faint), and was wringing my sword out of his hand, when
the Spaniard, though nndermost, wisely quitting the sword,
drew the pistol from his girdle, shot the savage though the
body, and killed him upon the spot, before I, who was running
to help, could come uear him.
Friday, being now left at his liberty, pursued the flying
wretches with no weapon in his hand but his hatchet; and with
that he dispatched those three who, as I said before, were
wounded at first and fallen, and all the rest be could come up
with; and the Spaniard coming to me for a gun, I gave him
one of the fowling-pieces, with which he pursued two of the
savages, and wounded them both; but as he was not able to run,
they both got from him into the wood, where Friday pursu-
ed them, and killed one of them; but the other was too nim-
ble for him; and though he was wounded, yet bad plunged in-
to the sea, and swam, with all his might, off to those two who
were left in the canoe, which three in the canoe, with one
wounded, we know not whether he died or no, were all that
escaped our hands, of one-aud-twenty. The account of the
rest is as follows:
y
3 Killed at our shot from the tree.
2 Killed at the next shot.
2 Killed by Friday in the boat.
2 Killed by ditto, of those at first wounded.
1 Killed by ditto, in the wood.
3 Killed by the Spaniard
4 Killed, being found dropped here and there, of their
wounds, or killed by Friday in his chase of them.
4 Escaped in the boat, whereof one wounded, if not dead-
21 la an.
Those that were in the canoe, worked hard to get out of
gun-shot; and though Friday made two or three shots at them,
1 did not find that he hit any of them. Friday would fain
have had me take one of their canoes, and pursue them; and
indeed I was very anxious about their escape, lest, carrying
the news home to their people, they should come back, per-
haps, with two or three hundred of their canoes, and devour
us by mere multitude; so I consented to pursue them by sea,
and running to one of their canoes, I jumped in, and bade
Friday follow me; but when I was in the canoe, I was surpri-
sed to find another poor creature lie there alive, bound hand
and foot, as the Spaniard was. for the slaughter, and almost
dead with fear, not knowing what the matter was, for he had
not been able to look up over the side of the boat; he was tied
so hard, neck aud heels, and had been tied so long, that he
had really little life in him.
I immediately cut the twisted flags, or rushes, which they
had bound him with, and would have helped him up, but he
could not stand, or speak, but groaned most piteouslv, believ-
ing, it seems, still that he was only unbound in order to be
killed.
When Friday came to him, I bade him speak to him, and
tell him of his deliverance; and pulling out my bottle, made
him give the poor wretch a dram, which, with the news of his
being delivered, revived him, and he sat up in tne boat; but
when Friday came to hear him speak, and looked m his face,
it would have moved any one to tears, to have seen how Fri.
day kissed him, embraced him, hugged him, cried, laughed,
hallooed, jumped about, danced, sung, then cried again, wilmg
his hands, beat his own face and head, and then sungand jump-
ed about again, like a distracted creature It was a good while
before I could make him speak to me, or tell me what was
the matter; but when he came a little to himself, he told me
that it was his father-
It is not easy for me to express how it moved me, to see
what ecstasy and filial affection had worked in this poor savage,
at the sight of his father, and of his being delivered from death;
nor indeed can I describe half the extravagances of his affection
after this. fur he went into the boat, and out of the boat, a great
many times. When he went in to him, he would sit down
by him, open his breast, aud hold his father's head close to
his bosom, half an hour together, to nourish it; then he took
his arms and ancles, which were numbed and stiff with the
binding, and chaffed and rubbed them with his hands; and I,
perceiving what the case was, gave him some rum out of my
bottle to rub them with, which did them a great deal of good.
This action put an end to our pursuit of the canoe with the
other savages, who were now gotten almost out of sight; and
it was happy for us that we did not, for it blew so hard within
two hours after, and before they could be gotten a quarter of
their way, and continued blowing so hard all night, and that
from the north-west, which was against them, that I could not
suppose their boat could live, or that they ever reached to
their own coast.
But to return to Friday: he was so busy about his father,
that I could not find in my heart to take him off, for some
time; but after I thought he could leave him a little, I called
him to me, and he came jumping and laughing, and pleased
to the highest extreme. Then I asked him, if he had given
liis father any bread. He shook his head, and said, ' None:
ugly dog eat all up self.' So I gave him a cake of bread out
of a little pouch 1 carried on purpose; I also gave him a dram
for himself, but he would not taste it, but carried it to his fa-
ther. I had in my pocket also two or three bunches of my
raisins, so I gave him a handful of them for his father. He
had no sooner given bis father these raisins; but 1 saw him
come out of the boat and run away, as if he had been bewitch-
ed. He ran at such a rate (for he was the swiftest fellow of
his foot that ever I saw), I say, he ran at such a rate, that he
was out of sight, as it were, in an instant; and though I called
and hallooed too after him, it was all one: away he went, and,
in a quarter of an hour, I saw him come back again, though
not so fast as he went; and as he came nearer, I found his pace
was slacker, because- he had something in his hand.
When he came up to me, 1 found he had been quite home
for an earthen jug, or pot, to bring his father, some fresh wa-
ter; and that he had got two more cakes, or loaves of bread.
The bread he gave me, but the water he carried to his father;
however, as I was very thirsty too, I took a little sup of it. This
water revived his father more than all the rum or spirits 1 had
given him; for he was just fainting with thirst.
When his father had drunk, I called to him to know if there
was my water left: he said, ' Yes;' and I bade him give it to
flic poor Spaniard, who was in as much want of it as his f»-
thcr; and I sent one of the cakes, that Friday brought, to the
Spaniard too, who was indeed very weak, and was reposing
himself npon a green place, under the shade of a tree, and
whose limbs were also very stiff, and very much swelled with
the rude bandage he had been tied with. When I saw that
upon Friday's coming to him with the water, he sat up, and
drank, and took the bread, and began to eat, I went to him^
and gave him a handful of raisins. He looked up in my face
with all the tokens of gratitude and thankfulness that could
appear in any countenance; but was so weak,notwithstanding
he had so exerted himself in the fight, that he could not stand
up upon his feet: he tried to do it two or three times, but was
really not able, his ancles were so swelled, and so painful to
him, so 1 bade him sit still, and caused Friday to rub his an-
cles, and bathe them with rum, as he had done his father's.
I observed the poor affectionate creature every two minutes,
or perhaps less, all the while he was here, turned his head
about, to see if his father was in the same place and posture as
he left him sitting, and at last he found he was not to be seen,
at which, he started up, and, without speaking a word, flew
with that swiftness to him, that one could scarce perceive his
feet to touch the ground as he went: but when he came, he
only found he had laid himself down to ease his limbs. So
Friday came back to me presently, and I then spoke to the
Spaniard to let Friday help him up, if he could, and lead him
to the boat, and then he should carry him to our dwelling,
where I would take care of him: but Friday, a lusty young
fellow, took the Spaniard quite up upon his back, and carried
him away to the boat, and set him down softly upon the side
or gunnel of the conoe, with his feet in the inside of it, and then
lifted him quite in, and set him close to his father, ami pre-
sently stepping out again, lanched the boat off, and paddled it
along the shore faster than I could walk, though the wind blew
pretty hard too; so be brooght them both safe into our creek,
and leaving them in the boat, runs away to fetch the other ca-
noe. \a he passed me, I spoke to him, and asked him whither
he went. He told me, ' Go fetch more boat.' So away he
-went, like the wind, for sure never man or horse ran like
him, and he had the other canoe in the creek, almost as soon
as I got to it by land: so he wafted me over, and then went
to kelp our new guests out of the boatj which he did: but they
S2
were neither of tliem able to walk, so that poor Friday knew
not what to do.
To remedy this I went to work in my thought, and calling
to Friday to bid them sit down on the bank while he cmc to
me, I soon made a kind of hand-barrow to lay them on, and
Friday and I carried them up both together upon it between
us. But when we got them to the outside of our wall, or
fortification, we were at a worse loss than before, for it was
impossible to get them over; and I was resolved not to break
it down. So I set to work again: and Friday and I, in about
two hours' time, made a very handsome tent, covered with
old sails, and above that with boughs of trees, being in the
space without our outward fence, and between that and the
grove of young wood which 1 had planted: and here we made
them two beds of such things as I had; viz. of good|rice straw,
with blankets laid upon it to lie on, and another to cover them
on each bed.
My island was now peopled, and I thought myself very
rich in subjects; and it was a merry reflection which I fre-
quently made, how like a king 1 looked. First of all, the
whole country was my own mere property, so that I had au
undoubted right of dominion. Secondly, my people were
perfectly subjected: I was the absolute lord and lawgiver;
• they all owed their lives to me, and were ready to lay down
their lives, if there had been occasion of it, for me. It waa
remarkable too, I had but three subjects, and they were of
three different religions: my man Friday was a protestant;
his father was a pagan and a cannibal, and the Spaniard was
a papist. However, I allowed liberty of conscience through-
out my dominions. But this is by the way.
As soon as I had secured my two weak, rescued prisoners,
and given them shelter, and a place to rest them upon, 1
began to think of making some provision for them: and the
first thing I did, I ordered Friday to take a yearling goat,
betwixt a kid and a goat, out of my particular flock, to be
killed. Then 1 cut off the hinder quarter, and chopping it
into small pieces, I set Friday to work to boiling and stewing,
and made them a very good dish, I assure you, of flesh and
broth, having put some barley and rice also into the broth;
and as I cooked it without doors, for I made no fire within my
mner wall, so I carried ^ all into the new tent: and having;
set a table there for them, I sat down and eat my dinner also
with them; and, as well I could, cheered them and encour-
aged ihem, Friday being my interpreter, especially to his
father, and indeed to the Spaniard too; for the Spaniard spoke
the language of the savages pretty well.
After we had dined, or rather supped, I ordered Friday to
take one of the canoes, and go and fetch our muskets and
other fire-arms, which, for want of time, we had left upon the
place of battle; and the next day I ordered him to go and
bury the dead bodies of the savages, which lay open to the
sun, and would presently be offensive; and I also ordered him
to bury the horrid remains of their barbarous feast, which I
knew were pretty much, and which I could not think of
doing myself: nay, I could not hear to see them, if I went
that way. All which he punctually performed, and defaced
the very appearance of the savages being there; so that when I
went again, I could scarce know where it was, otherwise than
by the corner of the wood, pointing to the place.
I then began to enter into a little conversation with my two
new subjects; and first I set Friday to inquire of his father
what he thought of the escape of the savages in that canoe;
and whether we might expect a return of them with a power
too great for us to resist. His first opinion was, that the savages
in the boat never could live out the storm which blew that
night they went off, but must of necessity be drowned or driven
south to those other shores, where they were as sure.to be
devoured as they were to be drowned, if they were castaways
but as to what they would do. if they came safe on shore, he
said, he knew not; but it was his opinion that they were so
dreadfully frighted with the manner of their being attacked,
the noise, and the fire, that he believed they would tell their
people they were all killed by thunder and lightening, and
not by the hand of man; and that the two which appeared
(viz Friday and I) were two heavenly spirits or furies come
down to destroy them, and not men with weapons. This, he
said, he knew, because he heard them all cry out so in their
language to one another: for it was impossible to them to
conceive that a man could dart fire, and speak thunder, and
kill at a distance, without lifting up the hand, as was done
now. And this old savage was in the right: for, as I under-
stood since by other hands, the savages of that part ne*er at'
tempted to go over to the island afterwards. They were so
terrified with the accounts given by those four men (for it
seems they did escape the sea), that they believed, who
ever went to that enchanted island, would be destroyed with
fire from the gods.
This, however, I knew not, and therefore was under con-
tinual apprehensions for a good while, and kept alwiys upon
my guard, 1 and all my army: for as we were now four of us,
I would have ventured upon a hundred of them fairly, in the
open field, at any time.
In a little time, however, no more onnoes appearing, the
fear of their coming wore off, and I began to take my former
thoughts of a voyage to the main into consideration, being
likewise assured by Friday's father, that I might depend upon
good usage from their nation, on his account, if I would go.
But my thoughts were a little suspended, when I had a
aerious discourse with the Spaniard, and when I understood
that there were sixteen more of his countrymen and Portu-
guese, who having been cast away, and made their escape to
that side, lived there at peace indeed with the savages, but
-were very sore put to it for necessaries, and indeed for life.
I asked him all the -particulars of their voyage. and found
they were a Spanish ship, bound from Bio de la Plata, to the
Havanna, being directed to leave their loading there, which
-was chiefly hides and silver, and to bring back what European
goods they could meet with there; that they had five Portu-
guese seamen on board, whom they took out of another wreck;
that five of their own men were drowned when first the ship
was lost; and that these escaped through mfinite dangers and
hnaards, and arrived almost starved on the cannibal coast,
-where they expected to have been devoured every moment.
He told me thev had some arms with them, but they were
perfectly useless, for that they had neither powder nor ball,
the wattling of the sea having spoiled all their powder, but a
little wflSch they used at their first landing to provide them-
selves some food.
I asked him what he thr-jght would become of them there:
and if they had formed no design of making any escape. He
aaid, they had many consultations about it; but that having
neither vessel, nor tools to build one, nor provisions of any
kmd, their counsels always ended in tears and despair.
1 asked him how he thought they would receive a proposal
from me, which might tend towards an escape; and whether,
if they were all here, it might not be done. I told him, with
freedom, I feared mostly their treachery and ill Usage of me,
if I put my life into their hands; for that gratitude was no in-
herent virtue in the nature of man; nor did men always square
their dealings by the obligations they had received, so much
as they did by the advantages they expected. I told him it
would be very hard, (hat I should be the instrument of their
deliverance, and that they should afterwards make me their
prisoner in New Spain, where an Englishman was certain to
be made a sacrifice, what necessity, or what accident soever,
brought him thither: and that 1 had rather be delivered up
to the savages, and be devoured alive, than fall into the mer-
ciless claws of the priests, and be carried into the Inquisition.
I added, that otherwise I was persuaded, if they were all here,
we might, with so many hands, build a bark large enough to
carry us all away, either to the Brasils, southward, or to the
islands, or Spanish coast, northward: but that if, in requital,
they should, when I had put weapons into their hands, carry
me, by force, among their own people, I might be ill used foe1
my kindness to them, and make my case v/orse than it was
before.
He answered with a great deal of candour and ingenuity,
that their condition was so miserable, and they were so sensi-
ble of it, that he believed they would abhor the thought of
using any man unkindly, that should contribute to their de-
liverance, and that, if I pleased, he would go to them with
the old man, and discourse with them about it, and return
again, and bring me their answer: that he would make condi-
tions with them, upon their solemn oath, that.>they should be
absolutely under my leading, as their commander and captain;
and that they should swear upon the holy sacraments and the
gospel, to be true to me, and to go to such Christian country
as I should agree to, and no other; and to be directed wholly
and absolutely by my orders, till they were landed safely in
such country as I intended; and that he would brirfg a con*
tract from them, under their hands, for (hat purpose.
Then he told me, he would first stveav to me himself, that
he would never stir from me as long as he lived, till I gave
him orders; and that he would take my side to the last drop
of blood, if there should happen the least breach of faith among
Ins countrymen-
He told me they were all of them very c'wil, honest men*
and they were under the greatest distress imaginable, having;
neither weapons nor clothes, nor any food, but at the merey
and discretion of the savages, out of all hopes of ever return-
ing to their own country; and that he was sure, if I would
undertake their relief, they would live and die by me.
Upon these assurances, I resolved to venture to relieve
them, if possible, and to send the old savage and this
Spaniard over to them to treat. But when he had gotten all
things in readiness to go, the Spaniard himself started an ob-
jection, which had so much prudence in it on one hand, and
so much sincerity on the other hand, that I could not but be
very well satisfied in it; and, by his advice, put off the de-
liverance of his comrades for at least half a year. The case
was thus:
He had been with us now about a month, during which
timt-1 had let him see in what manner I had provided, with
the assistance of Providence, for my support; and he saw evi-
dently what siock of corn and rice I had laid up, which, as it
Was more than sufficient for myself, so it was not sufficient,
at least, without good husbandry, for my family, now it was
increased to number four: but much less would it be sufficient,
if his countrymen, who were, as he said, fourteen, still alive,
should come over; and, least of all. would it be sufficient to
victual our vessel, if we should build one, for a voyage to any
of the Christian colonies of V merica. So he told me, he
thought it would be more advisable to let him, and the two
others, dig and cultivate some more land, as-much as 1 could
spare s^ed to sow; and that we should wait another harvest,
thai we might hf>ve a supply of corn for his counlry men. when
they should come; for want might be a temptation to them to
disagree, or not to think themselves delivered; otherwise than
out of one difficulty into another. ' You know,' says he, ' the
child mi of Israel, though they rejoiced at first at their being
delivered out ol Egypt, yet rebelled even against God him-
self, that delivered them, when they came to want bread in
the wilderness.'
His caution was so seasonable, and his advice so good, that
I cnuld not but be very well pleased with his proposal, as well
as I was satisfied with his fidelity. So we fell to digging all
four of us, as well as the wooden tools we were furnished
with permitted; and in about a month's time, by the end of
which it was seed time, we had gotten as much land cured
and inmmed up as we sowed twenty-two bushels of barley
on, and sixteen jars of rice, which was, in short, all the seed
we had to spare; nor indeed did we leave ourselves bailey
sufficient for our own food, for the six months that we had to
expect our crop, that is to say, reckoning from the time we
set our seed aside for sowing; for it is not to be supposed it is
six months in the ground in that country
Having now society enough, and our number being suffi-
cient to put us out of fear of the savages; if they had come,
unless their number had been very great, we went freely all
over the island, whereever we found occasion; and as here
we had our escape or deliverance upon our thoughts, it wag
impossible, at least for me, to have the means of it out of
mine. To this purpose, I marked out several trees, which
I thought fit for our work, and I set Friday and his father to
cutting them down; and then I caused the Spaniard, to whom
I imparted my thoughts on that affair, to oversee and direct
their work. I showed them with what indefatigable pains I
had hewed a large tree into single planks, and I caused them
to do the like, till they bad made about a dozen large planks
of good oak, near two feet broad, thirty-five feet long,1 and
from two inches to four inches thick. What prodigious labour
it took up, any one may imagine.
At the same time, I contrived to increase my little flock of
tame goats as much as I could; and to this purpose I made
Friday and the Spaniard go out one day, and myself with
Friday the next day; for we took our turns: and, by this
means, we got about twenty young kids to breed up with the
rest; for whenever we shpt the dam, we saved the kids, and
added them to our flock. But, above all, the season for
curing the grapes coming on, I caused such a prodigious
quantity to be hung up in the sun, that I believe, hs.d wc been
-»t Alicant, where the raisins of the sun are cured, we should
have filled sixty or eighty barrels; and these, with our bread,
was a great part of our food, and very good living too, I assure
you; for it is an exceeding nourishing food.
It was now harvest, and our crop in good order It was
not the most plentiful increase I had seen in the island, but,
however, it was enough to answer our end; for from our
twenty-two bushels of barley, we brought in and threshed out
about two hundred and twenty bushels, and the like in pro-
portion of the rice, which was store enough for our food to
the next harvest, though all the sixteen Spaniards had been
on shore with me; or, if we had been ready for a voyage, ft
would very plentifully have victualled our ship, to have car-
ried us to any part of the world, that is to say, of America.
When we had thus housed and secured our magazine of corn,
we fell to work to make more wicker-work; viz great bas-
kets, in which we kept it: and the Spaniard was very handy
and dexterous at this part, and often blamed me, that I
did not make some things for defence, of this kind of work;
but I saw no need of it.
And now having a full supply of food for all the guests I
expected, I gave the Spaniard leave to go over to the main,
to see what he could do with those he had left behind him
there. I gave him a striot charge in writing not to bring any
man with him, who would not first swear in the presence of
himself, and of the old savage, that he would no way injure,
fight with, or attack the person he should find in the island,
who was so kind as to send for them, in order to their deliver-
anee; but that they would stand by and defend him against
all such attempts; and, wherever they went, would be entirely
under, and subjected to, his command; and that this should
be put in writing, and signed with their hands. How wo
were to have this done, when I knew they had neither
pen nor ink, that indeed was a question which we never
asked.
Under these instructions, the Spaniard, and the old sav-
age (the father of Friday,) went away in one of the canoes,
which they might be said to come in, or rather were brought
in, when they came as prisoners to be devoured by the
savages.
I gave each of them a musket, with a firelock on it, and
about eight charges of powder and ball, charging them to be
very good husbands of both, and not to use either of them
but upon urgent occasion.
This was a cheerful work, being the first measures used by
me, in view of my deliverance, for now twenty-seven years
and some days. I gave them provisions of bread, and of dried
grapes, sufficient for themselves for many days, and sufficient
fbr all their countrymen for about eight days time; and
wishing them a good voyage, I let them go, agreeing with
them about a signal they should hang out at their return, by
which I should know them again, when they came back, at a
distance, before they came on shore.
IFhey went away, with a fair gale, on the day that the moon.
was at the fall; by my account, in the month of October: •
but as for the exact reckoning of days, after I had once lost
it, I could never recover it again; nor had I even kept the
number of.years so punctually as to be sure that I was right,
though, as it proved, when I afterwards examined my account,
I found I had kept a true reckoning of years.
It was no less than eight days I wai^d for them, when a.
strange and unforeseen accident intervened, of which the like
has not, perhaps, been heard of in history. I was fast asleep
in my hutch one morning, when my man Friday came run-
ning in to me, and called aloud, ' Master, master, they are
come, they are come!'
I jumped up, and, regardless of danger, I went out, as
soon as I could get my clothes on, through my little grove,
which (by the way) was by this time grown to be a very
thick wood; I say, regardless of danger, I went without my
arms, which was not my custom to do; but I was surprised,
when, turning my eyes to the sea, I presently saw a boat, at
about a league and a half's distance, standing in for the shore,
with a shoulder-of-mutton sail, as they call it, and the wind
blowing pretty fair to bring them in. Also I observed pre-
sently, that they did not come from that side which the shore.
lay on, but from the southcrmost end of the island. Upon
this, I called Friday in, and bade him lie close, for these were
not the people we looked for, and that we did not know yet
whether they were friends or enemies.
In the next place, I went in to fetch my perspective glass,
to see what I could make of them; and having taken the.
ladder out, I climed up to the top of the hill, as I used to do
when I was apprehensive of any thing, and to take my view
the plainer, without being discovered.
I had scarce set my foot on the hill, when my eye plainly
discovered a ship lying at an anchor, at about two leagues.
and a half's distance from me, S. S. B. but not above a
league and a half from the shore. By my observation, it ap-
peared plainly to be an English ship, and the boat appeared
to be an English long-boat.
I cannot express the confusion I was in, though the joy of.
seeing a ship, and one which, I had reason to believe, was
manned by my own countrymen, and consequently friends,
was such as I cannot describe; but yet I, bad some ssej^t
T
doubts hung about me, I cannot tell from whence they came,
. biddmg me keep upon my guard. In the first place. it occur,
red to me to consider what business an English ship could
have in that part of the world, since it was not the way to or
from any part of the world where the English had any traffic;
and I knew there had been no storms to drive them in there,
as in distress; and that if they were English really, it was
most probable that they were here upon no good design, and
that I had better continue as I was, than fall into the hands
«(f thieves and murderers.
Let no man despise the seoret hints and notices of danger,
-which sometimes are given him, when he may think there is
no possibility of its being real. That such hints and notices
are given us, 1 believe few, that have made any obsertations of
things, can deny; that they are certain discoveries of an in-
visible world, and a converse of spirils, we cannot doubt; and
if the tendency ot them seems to be to warn us of danger,
why should we not suppose they are from some friendly
agent (whether supreme, or inferior and subordmate, is not
the question,) and that they are given for our good.
The present question abundantly confirms me in the jus-
tice of this reasoning; for had I not been made cautious by
this secret admonition, come it from whence it will, I had
been undone inevitably, and in a far worse condition than be-
fore, as you will see presently. ..
I had not kept my self long in this posture, when I saw
the boat draw near the shore, as if they had looked for a
ereek to thrust in at,for the convenience of landing: however,
as i hey did not come quite far enough, they did not see the
little inlet where- 1 formerly landed my rafts, but rua their
boston shore upon the beach, at about half a mile from me,
which was very happy for me; for otherwise they would have
lauded just, as I may say, at my door, and would soon have
beaten me out of my castle, and, perhaps, have plundered me
of aii I had.
When they were on shore, I «as fully satisfied they were
Englishmen, at least, most of them: one of two I thought were
Dutch, but.it did not prove so. There were in all eleven
men, whereof three I found were unarmed, and (as I thought)
bound; and when the first four or five of them were jumped
on shore, they took those three out of the boat as prisoners.
One of the three i eould perceive using the most passionate
gestures of entreaty, affliction, and despair, even to a kind of
extravagance; the other two I could perceive lifted up their
hands sometimes, and appeared concerned indeed, hut not
to such a degree as the first.
I was perfectly confounded at the sight, and knew not
-what the meaning of it should be. Friday called out to me,
in English, as well as he could, ' O master, you see English
mans eat prisoners as well as savage mans.' ' Why,' said I,
'Friday, do you think they are going to eat them then.' ' Yes,'
says Friday,' they will eat them.' ' No, no,' said I,' Friday;
I am afraid they will murder them indeed, but you may be
sure they will not eat them.'
All this while I had no thought of what the matter really
was, but stood trembli'g with the horror of the sight, expect-
ing every moment, when the three prisoners should be killed;
nay, once I saw one of the villains lift up his arm, with a gieat
cutlass (as the seamen call it) or sword, to strike one of the
poor men; and I expected to see him fall every momenut
which all the blood in my body seemed to run chill in^jpy
veins.
I wished heartily now for my Spaniard, and the savage that
was gone with him; or that I had any way to have come un-
discovered within shot of them, that I might have rescued
the three men; for I saw no fire arms they had among them:
but it fell out to my mind another way.
After I had observed the outrageous usage of the three
men, by the insolent seamen, I observed the fellows ran scat-
tering about the land as if they wanted to see the country* I
observed also, that the three other men had liberty to go
where they pleased; but they sat down all three upon the
ground very pensive, and looked like men in despair
This put me in mind of the first time when I came on
shore, and began to look about me: how I gave myself over
for lost, how wildly I looked around me, what dreadful ap-
prehensions I had, and how I lodged in the tree all night,
for fear of being devoured by wild beasts.
As I knew nothing that night of the supply I was to re-
ceive, by the providential driving of the ship nearer the land*
by the storms fcnd tide, by which I have since been so lung
nourished and supported; so these three poor, desolate men
knew nothing how certain of deliverance and supply thi'y
were, how near it was to them, and how effectually and real- -
Iy they were in a condition of safety, at the same time that
they thought themselves lost, and their case desperate.
So little do we see before us in the world, and so much
reason have we to depend cheerfully upon the great Maker
of the world, that he does not leave his creatures so absolute-
ly destitute, but that in the worst circumstances they have
always something to be thankful for, and sometimes are nearer
their deliverance than they imagine; nay, are even brought to
their deliverance by the means by which they seem to be
brought to their destruction.
It was just at the top of high-water when these people
came on shore, and while partly they stood parlying with the -
prisoners they brought, and partly while they rambled about
to see what kind of place they were in, they had carelessly
staid till the tide was spent, and the water was ebbed consid-
erably away, leaving their boat aground.
They had left two men in the boat, who, as 1 found after-
awards, having drank a little too much brandy, fell asleep,
HoVever, one of them waking sooner than the other, and
finding the boat too fast aground for him to stir it, hallooed
for the rest, who were straggling about, upon which they all
soon came to the boat, but it was past all their strength to
lanch her, the boat being very heavy, and the shore on that
side being a soft, oosy sand, almost like a quicksand.
In this condition, like true seamen, who are, perhaps, the
least of all mankind given to forethought, they gave itover, and
away they strolled about the country again; and I heard one
of them say aloud to another (calling them ofFfrom the boat),
•Why, let her alone, Jack, can't ye? She'll float next tide.' By
Which I was fully confirmed in the main inquiry, of what
countrymen they were.
All this while, I kept myself close, not once daring to stir
out of my castle, any farther than to my place of observation,
near the top of the hill; and very glad I was to think how well
it was fortified. I knew it was no less than ten hours before
the boat could be afloat again, and by that time it would be
dark, and I might be more at liberty to see their motions,
and to hear their discourse if they had any.
In the mean time, I fitted myself up for a battle, as before,
though with more caution, knowing I had to do with another
kind of enemy than I had at first I ordered Friday also,
whom I had made an excellent marksman with his gun, to
load himself with arms. I took myself two fowling-pieces,
and I gave him three muskets. My figure indeed was very
fierce; I had my formidable goat-skin coat on, with the great
cap 1 have mentioned, a naked sword by my side, two p-.siols
in my belt, and a gun upon each shoulder.
It was my design, as I said above, not to have made any
attempt till it was dark; but about two o'clock, being the heat
of the day, I found, that, in short, they were all gone strag-
gling into the woods, and, as I thought, were all laid down to
sleep. The three poor distressed men, too anxious for their
condition to get any sleep, were, however, set down under the
shelter of a great tree, at about a quarter of a mile from me,
and, as I thought, out o>' sight of any of the rest.
Upon this, I resolved to discover myself to them, and learn
something of their condition. Immediate!* I marched, m
the figure above; my man Friday at a good distance behind
me, as formidable for his arms as I, but not making quite so
staring a spectre like figure as I did.
I came as near them undiscovered as I could, and then. be-
fore any of them saw me, I called aloud to them, in Spanish,
' What are ye, gentlemen?'
They started up at the noise, but were ten times more con-
founded when they saw me, and the uncouth figure th*t I
made. They made no answer at all, but I thoughL I per-
ceived them just going to fly from me, when I spoke to them
in English: ' Gentlemen,' said I, do not be surprised at me;
perhaps you may have a friend near you, when you did not
expect it.' ' He must be sent direotly from Heaven then,'
said one of them, very gravely to me, and pullmg oft" his hat
at the same time; ' for our conditiou is past the help of man.'
« All help is from Heaven sir,' said I. ' But can you put a
stranger in the way how to help you; for you seem to me to be
in some great distress? I saw you when you landed; and when
you seemed to make application to the brutes that came with
you, I saw one of them lift up his sword to kill you.'
The poor man, with tears running down his face, and
trembling, looking like one astonished, returned., ' Am 1 talk-
' ing to God or man? Is it a real man, or an angel?' Hie in no
fear about that, sir,' said I. 'If God had sent an angel to re-
lieve you, he would have come better clothed, and armed af-
ter another manner, than you see me. Pray lay aside your
/ears: I am a man, an Englishman, and disposed to assist you,.
T3 .
you see. I have one servant only; we hare arms and am-
munition. Tell us freely: can we serve you? .What is your
case?'
1 Our case,' said he,' sir, is too long to tell yon, while our
murderers are so near; but, in short, sir, I was commander of
that ship; my men having mutinied against me; they have
been hardily prevailed on not to murder me, and, at last,
have set me on shore in this desolate place, with these two
men with me, one my mate, the other a passenger, where we
expected to perish, believing the place to be uninhabited,
and know not yet what to think of it.'
' Where are those brutes, your enemies?' said I. * Do you
know where they are gone'' ' There they are, sir,' said he,
pointing to a thicket of trees. 'My heart trembles for fear
they have seen us, and heard you speak; if they have, they
will certainly murder us all.'
' Have they any fire-arms?' said I. He answered they had
only two pieces, and one which the> left in the boat. 'Well
then,' said I, ' leave the rest to me. I see they are all asleep.
It is an easy thing to kill them all: but shall we rather take
them prisoners!' lie told me there were two desperate vil-
lains among them, that it was scarce safe to show any mercy
to: but if they were secured, he believed all the rest would
return to their duty. I asked him which they were. He
told mi. he could not at that distance describe them; but he
'would obey my orders in any thing I would direct- 'Well,'
said I,' let us retreat out of their view or hearing, lest they
awake; and we will resolve farther. So they willingly went
back with me, till the woods covered us from them.
' Look you sir,' said I, ' if I venture upon your deliverance,
are you willing to make two conditions with me?' He anti-
cipated my proposals, by telling me, that both he and the ship,
if recovered, should be wholly directed and commanded by
me in'every thing; and if the ship was not recovered, he
-would live und die with me, in what part of the world soever
I would send him: and the tno other men said the same.
' Well,' said. I, ' my conditions are but two: first, That
-while you stay on this island with me, you will not pretend
to any authority here; and if I put arras into your hands, \n\x
-will upon all occasions, give them up to me, and do no preju-
dice to me or mine, upon this island} and, in the mean time;
Be governed by my orders.
Secondly, That if the ship is or may be recovered, you will
carry me and niv man to England passage-free.
He gave me all the assurances that the invention and faith
of man could devise, that he would comply with these most
reasonable demands; and, besides, would owe his life to me,
and acknowledge it upon all occasions as long as he lived.
' Well then,' said said I,' here are three muskets for you,
with powder and ball. Tell me next what you think is pro-
per to he done.' He showed all the testimony of his grati-
tude that he was able; but offered to be wholly guided by me.
I told him I thought it was hard venturing any thing, but the
best method I could think of, was to fire upon them at once,
as they lay; and if any were not killed at the first volley, and
offered to submit, we might save them, and so put it wholly
upon God's providence to direct the shot.
He said very modestly, that he was loath to kill them, if he
could help it; but that those two were incorrigible villains,
and had been the authors of all the mutiny in the ship; and if
they escaped, we should be undone still; for they would go
on board, and bring the whole ship's company, and destroy
us all. ' Well then,' said I,' necessity legitimates my advice;
for it is the only way to save our lives.' However, seeing him
still cautious of shedding blood, I told him they should go
themselves, and manage as they found convenient.
In the middle of this discourse, we heard some of them
awake, and soon after we saw two of them on their feet. 1
asked him if either of them were the men, who, he had said,
were the heads of the mutiny. He said,' No.' 'Well then,'
said I, ' you may let them escape; and Providence seems to
have wakened them on purpose to save themselves. Now,'
said I,' if the rest escape you, it is your fault'
Animated with this he took the musket I had given him
in his liand, and a pistol in his belt, and his two comrades
with him, with each man a piece in his hand. The two men,
who were with him, going first, made some noise, at which
one of the seamen, who was awake, turned about, and, seeing
them coming, cried out to the rest; but it was too late then,
for the moment he cried out, they fired, I mean the two men,
the captain wisely reserving his own piece. They had so
Veil aimed their shot at the men they knew, that one of them
was killed on the spot, and the other very much wounded;
but not being dead, he started up upon his feet, and called
eagerly for help to the other: but the captain, stepping to hi in
told him it was too late to cry for help; he should call upon
God to forgive his villain, and, with that word, knocked him
down, with the stock of his musket, so that he never spoke
more. There were three more in the company, and one of
them was also slightly wounded. By this time I was come;
and when they saw their danger, and that it was in vain to
resist, they begged for mercy. The captain told them, he
would spare their lives, if they would give him any assurance
of their abhorrence of the treachery they had been guilty of,
and would swear to be faithful to him in recovering the ship,
and afterwards in carrying her back to Jamaica, from whence
they came. They gave him all the protestations of their
sincerity that could be desired, and he was willing to believe
them, and spare their lives, which I was not against: only I
obliged him to keep them bound, hand and foot, while they
were upon the island.
While this was doing, t sent Friday, with the captain's mate,
to the boat, with orders to secure her, and bring away the
oars and sail, which they did; and, by-and-by, three stragglmg
men, that were (happily for them) parted from the rest,
came back, upon hearing the guns tired; and seeing their cap-
tain, who was before their prisoner, now their conqueror, they
submitted to be bound also; and so our victory was complete.
It now remained that the captain and I should inquire into
one another's circumstances. I began first, and told him my
whole history, which he heard with an attention even to
amazement, and particularly at the wonderful manner of
my being furnished with provisions and ammunition; and in-
deed, as my story is a whole collection of wonders, it affected
him deeply; but when he reflected from thence upon him-
self, and how I seemed to have been preserved there on pur-
pose to save his life, the tears ran dowu his face, and he could
not speak a word more.
After this communication was at an end, I earned him, and
his two men, into my apartment, leading them in just where
I came out, viz. at the top of the house, where I refreshed
them with such provisions as I had, and showed them all the
contrivances 1 had made, during my long, long inhabiting that
place.
All I showed them, all I said to them was perfectly ama-
zmg; but, above all, the captain admired my fortification, and
how perfectly I had concealed my retreat with a grove of
trees, which having been now planted near twenty years, and
the trees growing much faster than in England, was become a
little wood, and so thick that it was impassable in any part
of it, but at that one side where I had reserved my tittle
winding passage into it. This I told him was my castle, and
my residence; but that I had a seat in the country, as most
princes have, whither I could retreat upon occasion, and I
would show him that too another time; but at present our
business was to consider, how to recover the ship. He
agreed with me as to that; but told me, he was perfectly at a
loss what measures to take, for that there were still six-and-
twenty hands on board, who, having entered into a cursed
conspiracy, by which they had all forfeited their lives to the
law, would be hardened in it now by desperation, and would
carry it on, knowing that if they were reduced, they should
he brought to the gallows as soon as they came to England,
or to any of the English colonies; and that therefore there
would be no attacking them with so small a number as we
were.
I mused for some time upon what he had said, and found
it was a very rational conclusion; and that therefore some-
thing was to be resolved on very speedily, as well to draw the
men on board into some snare for their surprise, as to prevent
their landing upon us, and destroying us. Upon this it pre-
sently occurred to me, that, in a little while, the ship's crew,
wondering what was become of their comrades, and of the
boat, would certamly come on shore in their other boat, to
see for them; and that then, perhaps they might come
armed, and be too strong for us: this, he allowed was
rational.
Upon this I told him the first thing we had to do was to
stave the boat, which lay upon the beach, so that they might
not carry her off; and takingevery thing out of her, leave her
so far useless as not to be fit to swim. Accordingly we went
on board, took the arms which were left on board out of her,
-and whatever else we found there, which was a bottle of
brandy, and another of rum, a few biscuit cakes, a horn of
powder, and a great lump of sugar, in a piece of canvass;
the sugar was five or six pounds: all which was very welcome
to me, especially the brandy and sugar, of which I had had
pone left for many years.
When we had carried all these things on shore (the oars,
mast, sail, and rudder of the boat were carried away before,
as above,) we knocked a great hole in her bottom, that
if they had come strong enough to master us, yet they could
not carry off the boat
Indeed it was not much in my thoughts, that we could be
capable to recover the ship; but my view was, that if they
went away without the boat, 1 did not much question to make
her fit again to carry as away to the Leeward Islands, and
call upon our friends, the Spaniards, in my way; for I had
them still in my thoughts.
While we were thus preparing our designs, and bad first,
by main strength, heaved the boat up upon the beach, so high
that the tide would not float her otf at high-water mark; and,
besides, had broken a hole in her bottom too big to be quickly
stopped, and were sat down musing what we should do, we
heard the ship fire a gun, and saw her make a waft with her
ancient, as a signal for the boat to come on board; but no boat
stirred, and they fired several times, making other signals fojr
the boat.
At last, when all their signals and firings proved fruitless,
and they found the boat did not stir, we saw them (by the
help of my glasses) Hoist another boat out, and row towards
the shore; and we found, as they approached, that there
were no less than ten men in her, and that they had fire-arms
with them
As the ship lay almost two leagues from the shore, we had
a full view of them as they came, and a plain sight of the
men, even of their faces; because the tide having set them
a little to the east of the other boat, they rowed up under
shore, to come to the same place where the other boat had
landed, and where the boat lay.
By thte means, I say, we had a full view of them, and the
captain knew the persons and characters of all the men in
the boat, of whom he said that there were three very honest
fellows, who, he was sure, were led into this conspiracy by
the rest, being overpowered and frighted.
But that as for the boatswain, who, it seems, was the chief
officer among them, and all the rest, they were as outrageous
as any of the ship's crew; and were, no doubt, made despe-
rate in their new enterprise: and terribly apprehensive he was,
that they would be too powerful for us.
I smiled at him, and told him that men in our circumstances
-were past the operations of fear: that seeing almost every
condition that could he, was better than that which we were
supposed to be in, we ought to expect that the consequence,
whether death or life, would be sure to be a deliverance. I
asked him what he thought of the circumstances of my life;
and whether a deliverance were not worth venturing for.
' And where, sir,' said I, ' is your belief of my being preserv-
ed hereon purpose to save your life, which elevated you a
little while ago? For my part,' said f, ' there seems to be but
one thing amiss in all the prospect of it.9 ' V\ hat's that?'
said he. ' Why,' said I, ' 'tis that, as you say, there are three
or four honest fellows among them, which should be spared;
bad they been all of the wicked part of the crew, I should
have thought God's providence had singled them out, to de-
liver them into your hands; for, depend upon it, every man
of them that comes ashore are our own, and shall die or live,
as they behave to us.'
As I spoke this with a raised voice and cheerful counte-
nance, I found it greatly encouraged him; so we set vigorously
to our business. We had, upon the 6rst appearance of the
boat's coming from the ship, considered of separating our
prisoners, and had indeed secured them effectually.
Two of them, of whom the captain was less assured than
ordinary, I sent with Friday, and one of the three delivered
men, to my cave, where they were remote enough, and out
of danger of being heard or discovered, or of finding their way
out of the woods, if they could have delivered themselves.
Here they left them bound, but gave them provisions, and
promised them, if they continued there quietly, to give them
their liberty in a day or two; but that if they attempted their
escape, they should be put to death without mercy. They
promised faithfully to bear their confinement with patience,
and were very thankful that they had such good usage as to
have provisions, and a light left them; for Friday gave them
candles (such as we made ourselves) for their comfort: and
they did not know but that he stood centinel over them at the
entrance.
The other prisoners had better usage: two of them were
kept pinioned indeed, because the captain was not free to
trust them; but the other two were taken into my service,
upon their captain's recommendation, and upon their solemn-
ly engaging to live and die with us; so, with them and the
three honest men, we were seven men well armed; and I
made no doubt we should be able to deal well enough with
the ten that were a coming, considering that the captain
had said there were three or four honest men among them
also.
As soon as they got to the place where their other boat
lay, they ran their boat into the beach, and came all on shore,
hauling the boat up after them, which I was glad to see; for
I was afraid they would rather have left the boat at an an-
chor, some distance from the shore, with some hands in
her to guard her; and so we should not be able to seize the
boat.
Being on shore the first thing they did, they ran all to the
other boat and it was easy to sec they were under a great
surprise, to find her stripped, as above, of all that was in her,
and a great hole in her bottom.
After they had mused a while upon this, they set up two
or three great shouts, hallooing with all their might, to 07 if
they could make their companions hear; but it was all to no
purpose: then they came all close in a ring, and fired a volley
of their small arms, which indeed we heard, and the echoes
made the woods ring: but it was all one; those in the cave
we were sure could not hear, and those in our keeping,
though they heard it well enough, yet durst give no answer
to them.
They were so astonished at the surprise of this, that as
they told us afterwards, they resolved to go all on board
agam to their ship,' and let them know there, that the men
were all murdered, and the long-boat staved; accordingly
they immediately lanched their boat again, and got all of
them on board.
The captain was terribly amazed, and even confounded at
this, believing they would go on board the ship again, and set
sail, giving their comrades for lost, and so he should still lose
the ship, which he was in hopes we should have recovered:
but he was quickly as much frighted the other way.
They had not been long put off with the boat, but we per-
ceived them alf coming on shore again; but with this new
measure in their conduct, which, it seems, they consulted to-
gether upon; viz. to leave three men in the boat, and the res":
to go on shore, and go up into the country to look for their
fellows.
This was a great disappointment to us; for now we were at
a loss what to do, for our seizmg those seven men on shore
would be no advantage to us, if we et the boat escape, be-
cause they would then row away to the ship; and then the
rest of them would be sure to weigh, and set sail, and so our
hope of recovering the ship would be lost.
However. we had no remedy but to wait and see what the
issue of things might present. The seven men came on shore,
and the three who remained in the boat, put her off to a
good distance from the shore, and came to an anchor to wait
for them; so that it was impossible for us to come at them in
the boat.
Those that came on shore kept close together, marching
towards the top of the little hill, under which my habitation
lay; and we could see them plainly, though they could not
perceive us. We could have been very glad they would have
come nearer to us, so that we might have fired at them; or
that they would have gone farther off, that we might have
come abroad.
But when they were come to the brow of the hill, where
thev could see a great way into the valleys and woods, which
lay towards the north-east part, and where the island lay
lowest, they shouted and hallooed till they were weary, and
not caring, it seems, to venture far from the shore, nor far
from one another, they sat down together under a tree, to
consider of it. Had they thought fit to have gone to sleep
there, as the other party of them had done, they had done
the job for us; but they were too full of apprehensions of dan-
ger, to venture to go to sleep, though' they could not tell what
the danger was they had to fear neither.
The captain made a verj just proposal to me upon this
consultation of theirs, viz. that perhaps they would all lire a
volley again, to endeavour to make their fellows hear, and
that we should all sallv upon them, just at the juncture when
their pieces were all discharged, and they would certainly
yield, and we should have them without bloodshed. 1 liked
the proposal, provided it was done while we were near
enough to come up to them, before they could load their
pieces again
But this evint did not happen, and we lay still a long time,
U
very irresolute what course to take: at length I told them
there would be nothing to be done in my opinion till night; '
and then, if they did not return to the boat, perhaps we
might find a way to get between them and the shore, and so
might use some stratagem with them in the boat, to get them
en shore.
We waited a great while, though very impatient for their
removing, and were very uneasy; when, after long consulta-
tions, we saw them start all up, and march down toward the
sea. It seems, they had such dreadful apprehensions upon
them of the danger of the place, that they resolved to go
on board the ship again, give their companions over for
lost, and so go on with their intended voyage with the
ship.
As soon as I perceived them go towards the shore, I ima-
gined it to be as it really was, that they had given over their
search, and were for going back again; and the captain,
as soon as I told him my thoughts, was ready to sink at
the apprehensions of it: but I presently thought of a stra-
tagem to fetch them back again, and which answered my end
to a tittle.
I ordered Friday, and the captain's mate, to go over the
little creek westward, towards the place where the savages
tame on shore when Friday was rescued, and as soon as they
came to a little rising ground, at about half a mile's distance,
I bade them halloo as loud as they could, and wait till they
found the seamen heard them; that as soon as ever they
heard the seamen answer them, they should return it agam,
and then keeping out of sight, take a round, always an-
swering when the other hallooed, to draw them as far into
the island and among the woods as possible; and then wheel
about again to me, by such ways as 1 directed.
They were just going into the boat, when Friday and the
mate hallooed, and they presently heard them, and answer-
ing, run along the shore westward, towards the voice they
heard, when they were presently stopped by the creek,
where the water being up, they could not get over, and called
for the boat to come up, and set them over, as indeed I ex-
pected.
When they had set themselves over, I observed that the
boat being gone up a good way into the creek, and, as it
were, in a harbour within the land, they took one of the
three men oat of her to go along with them, and left only two
in the boat, having fastened her to the stump of a little tree
on the shore.
This was what I wished for, and immediately leaving Fri-
day and the captain's mate to their business, 1 took the rest
with me, and crossing the creek out of their sight, we surpri-
sed the two men before they were aware, one of them lying
on shore, and the other being in the boat: the fellow on shore
was between sleeping and waking, and going to start up, the
captain: who was foremost, ran in upon him, And knacked
him down, and then called out to him in the r at to yield, or
he was a dead man-
There needed very few arguments to persuade a single maa
to yield, when he saw five men upon him, and his comrade
knocked down; besides, this was, it seems, one of the three
who were not so hearty in the mutiny as the lest of the crew,
and therefore was easily persuaded not only to yield, but af-
terwards to join very sincerely with us.
In the mean time, Friday and the captain's mate so well
managed their business with the rest, that they drew them,
by hallooing and answering, from one hill to another, and
from one wood to another, till they not only heartily tired
them, but left them where they were very sure they could not
reach back to the boat before it was dark; and indeed they
-were heartily tired themselves also by the time they came
back to us.
We had nothing now to do but watch for them in the dark,
and to fall upon them, so as to make sure work of them.
It was several hours after Friday came back to me; before
they came back to their boHt; and we could hear the foremost of
them, long before they came quite up, calling to those behind
to come along, and could also hear them answer and com-
plain how lame and tired they were, and not able to come any
faster, which was very welcome news to us.
At length they came up to the boat; but it is impossible to
express their confusion when the found the boat fast aground
in the creek, the tide ebbed out, and their two men gone: we
could hear them call to one another, in a most lamentable
manner, telling one another they were gotten into an enchant-
ed island; that either there were inhabitants in it, and they
should all be murdered, or else there were devils or spirits in
it, and they should be all carried away and devoured.
They hallooed again, and called their two comrades by their
names a great many times, but no answer. After sometime
we could see them, by the Utile light there was, run about
wringing their hands, like men in despair; and that sometimes
they would go and sit down in the bo*t to rest ihemselves,
and then come ashore again, aud walk about again, and so the.
same thing over again.
My men would fain have had me given them leave to fall
upon them at once in the dark; but I was willing to takethem
at some advantage;, so to spare them, and kill as few of them
as I could; ant especially I was unwilling to hazard the killing
any of our ow » eft, knowing the other were very well armed.
I resolved to wait to see if they did not separate; and therefore
to make sure of them, I drew my ambuscade nearer, and Or-
dered Friday and the captain to creep upon their hands and
fee^ as close to the ground as they could, that they might uot
be discovered, and get as near them as they possibly cbuld,
before they offered to fire
They had not been ong in that posture, when the boatswain,
who was the principal ringleader of the mutmy, and who had
now shown himself the most dejected and dispirited of all the
rest, came walking towards them, with two more of their crew.
The captain was so eagar at having the principal rogue so
much in his power, that he could hardly have patience to let
him come so near as to be sure of him; for he only heard hiB
tongue before: but when they came nearer, the captain and
Friday, starting up on their feet, let fly at them.
The boatswain was killed upon the spot: the next man was
shot mto the body, and lell just by him, though he did not die
till an hour or two after; and the third ran for it.
At the noise of the fire, I immediately advanced with my
whole army, which was now eight men, viz myself, general-
issimo; Friday, my lientenant general; the captain and his two
men, and the three prisoners of war, whom we had trusted
with arms.
We came upon them indeed in the dark, so that they oould not
pee our number; and 1 made the man they had left m the boat,
who was now one of us, to call them byname, to try if I could
bring them to a parley, and so might perhaps reduce them to
terms, which fell out just as we desired: for indeed it was ea-
sy to think, as their condition then was, they would be very-
filing to capitulate. So he calls out, as loud as he couhlj to>
one of them, ' Tom Smith! Tom Smith!' Tom Smith an-
swered immediately, 'Who's that? Kobinson?'for it seems he
knew his voice. The other answered,' Aye,aye. for God's sake,
Tom Smith, throw down your arms, and yield; or you are all
dead men this moment!'
' Who must we yield to' where are they?' says Smith again.
' Here they are,' says he. ' Here is our captain, and fifty meu
with him, have been hunting you this two hours. The boat-
swain is killed, Will Frye is wounded, and I am a prisoner; and
if you do not yield, you are all lost.'
' Will they give us quarter then?' says Tom Smith, ' and
ve will yield.' 'I'll go and ask, if you'll promise to yield,'
says Kobinson. So he asked the captam, and the captain him-
self then calls out, ' You Smith, you know my voice: if you
lay down your arms immediately, and submit you shall have
your lives, all but Will Atkins.'
Upon this, Will Atkins cried out,' For God's sake, captain,
give me quarter! What have I done? They have been all as
bad asl!' which, by the way, was not true neither, for it seems
this Will Atkins was the first man that laid hold of the cap-
tain, when they first mutinied, and used him barbarously, in
tying his hands, and giving him injurious language. However,
the captain told him lie must lay down his arms at discretion,
and trust to the governor's mercy, by which he meant me: for
they all called mc.- governor.
In a word, they all laid down their arms, and begged their
lives. and I sent i he man that had parleyed with them, and two
more, who bound them all; and then my great army of fifty
men which, particularly with those three, were all but eight,
came up, and seized upon them all, and upon their boat, only
that I kept myself, and one more, out of sight, for reasons of
state.
Our next work was to repair the boat, and to think of seizing
the ship; and as for the captain, now he had leisure to parley
with them, he expostulated with them upon the villany of
their practises with him, and, at length, upon the farther wick-
edness of their design; anil how certainly it must bring them
to misery and distress in the end, and perhaps to the gallows.
They all appeared very penitent, and begged hard for their
lives. As for that, he told them they were none of his pri-
soners, but the commander's of the island; that they thought
thev had set him on shore in a barren, uninhabited island, but
17 3
it had pleased God so to direct them, that the island was in-
habited, and that the governor was an Englishman; th:it he
might hang them all there, if he pleased; but as he had given
them all quarter, he supposed he would send them to En-
gland to be dealt with there as justice required, except At-
kins, whom he was commanded by the governor to advise to
prepare for'death; for that he would be hanged in the morning.
Though this was all a fiction of his own, yet it had its de-
sired effect: Atkins fell upon his knees to beg the captain to
intercede with the governor for his life; and all the rest beg-
ged of him, for God's sake, that they might not be sent to En.
gland.
It now occurred to me that the time of our deliverance
was come, and that it would be a most easy thing to bring
these fellows in, tri be hearty in getting possession of the ship.
So I retired in the dark from them, that they might not see
what kind of a governor they had, and called the captain to
me. When 1 called, as at a good distance, one of the men
"Was ordered to speak again, and say to the captain, 'Captain,
the commander calls for you ' and presently the captain re-
plied, ' Tell his excellency, I am just a coming.' This more
perfectly amused them; and they all believed that the com-
mander was just by, with his fifty men.
Upon the captain's coming to me, I told him my project for
seizing the ship, which he liked of wonderfully well, and re-
solved to put it in execution the next morning.
But in order to execute it with more art, and to be secure of
success, I told him we must divide the prisoners, and that he
should go and take Atkins, and two more of the worst of
them, and send them pinioned to the cave where the oth~ers
lay. This was committed to Friday, and the two men who
came on shore with the captain.
They conveyed them to the cave, as to a prison; and it was
indeed a dismal place, especially to men in their condition.
The other I ordered to tny bower, as I called it, of which I
have given a full description; and as it was feoeed in, and they
pinioned, the place was secure enough, considering they were
upon their behaviour.
To these, in the morning, I sent the captain who was to enter
into a parley with them; in a word to try them, and tell me whe-
ther he thought they might be trusted or no, to go on board and
surprise the ship. lie talked to thera of the injury done him.,
of the condition they were brought to; and that though the
governor had given them quarter for their lives, as to the pre-
sent action, vet that if they were sent to England, they would
all be hanged in chains to be sure; but that if they would join
in so just an attempt, as to recover the ship, he would have
the governor's engagement for their pardon.
Any one may guess how readily such a proposal would be
accepted by men in their condition; they fell down on their
knees to the captain, and promised, with the deepest im-
precations, that thev would be faithful to him to the last'drop,
and that they should owe their lives to him, and would go
with him all over the world; that they would own him for a
father to them as lotjg as they lived.
' Well,' says the captain, * I must go and tell the governor
»hat you say, and see what I can do to bring him to consent
to it. So he bruught me an account of the temper he found
them in; and that he verily believed they would be faithful.
However, that we might be very secure, I told him he should
go back again, and choose out five of them, and tell them that
they should see that thev did not want men; but he would
take out those five to be his assistants, and that the go-
vernor would keep the other two, and the three that were
sent prisoners to the castle (my cave) as hostages, for the
fidelity of those five. and that if they proved unfaithful m the
execution, the five hostages should be hanged in chains alive
upon the shore
This looked severe, and convinced them, that the governor
-was in earnest However, they had no way left them but to
accept it; and it was now the business of the prisoners, as
much as of the captain, to persuade the other five to do their
duty.
Our strength was now thus ordered for the expedition.
First, The captain, his mate, and passenger Second, Then
the two .prisoners of the first gang, to whom, having their
characters from the captain, I had given their liberty, and
trusted them with arms. Third, The other two, whom.
I had kept till now in my bower pinioned; but, upon the
captain's motion, had now released Fourth, These five re-
leased at last; so that there were twelve in all, besides five we
kept prisoners in the cave for hostages.
I asked the captain, if he was willing to venture with these
hands on board the ship; for, as for me and my man Friday,
I did not think it was proper for us to stir, having seven men
left behind; and it was employment enough for us to keep
them'asunder, and supply them with victuals.
As to the five in the cave, 1 resolved to keep them fast;
but Friday went twice a day to them, to supply them with
necessaries; and I made the other two carry provisions to a
certain distance, where Friday was to take it.
When I showed myself to the two hostages, it was with the
captain, who told them I was the person the governor had
ordered to look after them, and that it was the governor's
pleasure they should not stir any where, but by my direction;
that if they did, they should be fetched into the castle, and
be laid in irons: so that as we never suffered them to see me
as governor, so I now appeared as another person, and spoke
of the governor, the garrison, the castle, and the like, upon
all occasions-
The captain now had no difficulty before him, but to fur-
nish his two boats, stop the breach of one, and man them.
He made his passenger captain of one, with four other men;
and himself, and his mate, and five more, went in the other.
And they contrived their business very well; for they came
up to the ship about midnight. As soon as they came within
call of the ship, he made Robinson hail them, and tell them
he had brought off the men and the boat, but that it was a
long time before they had found them, and the like,.holding
them in a chat, till they came to the ship's side: wfien^jhe
captam and the mate, entering first with their arms, imme-
diately knocked down the second mate and carpenter with
the butt-end of their muskets, being very faithfully seconded
by their men. They secured all the rest that were upon the
main and quarter-decks, and began to fasten the hatches to
keep them down who were below, when the other boat,
and their men entermg at the fore chains, secured the
forecastle of the ship, and the skuttle which went down
into the cook-room, making three men they found there
prisoners.
When this was done, and all safe upon the deck, the cap-
tain ordeied the mate, with three men, to break into the
round-house, where the new rebel captain lay, and, hating
taken the alarm, was gotten up, and, with two men and a boy,
had gotten fire arms in their hands; and when the mate, with
a crow, split open the door, the new captain and his men
IXTERVIKW WITHTHBCAIilAUf
fired boldly among ihem, and wounded the mate with a muB'
ket ball, which broke his arm, and wounded two more of the
men, but killed nobody.
The mate, calling for help, rushed, however into the
round-house, wounded as he was, and, with his pistol, shot
the new captain through the head, the bullet entering at his
mouth, and came out again behind one of his ears; so that he
never spoke a word: upon which the rest yielded, and the
ship was taken effectually, without any more lives lost.
As soon as the ship was thus secured, the captain ordered
seven guns to be fired, which was the signal agreed upon with
me, to give me notice' of his success, which, you may be sure,
I was very glad to hear, having sat watching upon the shore
for it, till near two of the elock in the morning.
Having thus heard the signal plainly, I laid me down; an!
it having been a day of great fatigue to me, I slept very sound,
till I was something surprised with the noise of a gun: and
presently starting up, I heard a man call me by the name of
' Governor, governor;' and presently I knew the captain's
voice, when climbing up to the top of the hill, there he stood,
and pointing to the ship, he embraced me in his arms. ' My
dear friend and deliverer,' says he, ' there's your ship; for
she is all yours, and so are we, and ;ill that belong to her.' 1
east my eyes to the ship, and there she rode within little
more than half a mile of the shore; for they had weighed her
anchor as soon as they were masters of her, and the weather
being fair, had brought her to an anchor just against the
mouth of a little ereek; and the tide being up, the captain
had brought the pinnace in near the place where I first land-
ed my rafts, and so landed just at my door.
I was, at first, ready to sink down with the surprise; for I
saw my deliverance indeed visibly put into my hands, all
things easy, and a large ship just ready to carry me away,
whither I pleased to go. . At first, for some time, I was
not able to answer one word; but as he had taken me in
his arms, 1 held fast by him, or I should have fallen to the
ground.
He perceived the surprise, and immediately pulls a bottle
out of his pocket, and gave me a dram of cordial, which he
had brought on purpose for me. After I drank it, I sat
down upon the ground, and though it brought me to myself,
yet it was a good while before I could speak a word to him.
AH this while, the poor man was io as great an ecstacy as
I, only not under any surprise, as I was; and he said a thou-
sand kind, tender things to me, to compose and bring me to
myself; but such was the flood of joy in my breast, that it put
all my spirits into confusion: at last, it broke out into tears,
and in a little while after I recovered my speech.
Then I took my turn and embraced him as my deliverer;
and we rejoiced together, I told him, t looked upon him as a
man sent from heaven to deliver me, and that the whole-
transaction seemed to be a chain of wonders; that such
things as these were the testimonies we had of a secret hand
of Providence governing the world, and an evidence that the
eyes of an infinite power could search into the remotest
corner of the world, and send help to the miserable whenever
he pleased.
I forgot not to lift up my heart in thankfulness to Heaven;
and what heart could forbear to bless him; who had not only,
in a miraculous manner, provided for one in such a wilder-
ness, and in such a desolate condition, but from whom every
deliverance must always be acknowledged to proceed!
When we had talked a while, the captain told me he had
brought me some little refreshment, such as the ship afford-
ed, and such as the wretches, who had been so long his mas-
ters, had not plundered him of Upon this, he called aloud
to the boat. and bade his men bring the things ashore, that
were for the governor; and indeed it was a present, as if I
had been one, not that was to be carried away along with
them, but as if I had been to dwell upon the island still, and
they were to go without me.
First, he had brought me a case of bottles full of excellent
cordial waters, six large bottles of Madeira wine, the bottles
held two quarts a piece, two pounds of excellent good to-
bacco, twelve good pieces of the ship's beef, and six pieces of
pork, with a bag of pease, and about a hundred weight of
biscuit.
He brought me also » box of sugar, a box of flour, a bag
full of lemons. and two bottles of lime juice, and abundance
of other things. But, besides these, and what was a thousand
times more useful to rue, he brought me six clean, new shirts,
six very good neckcloths, two pair of gloves, one pair of
shoes, a hat, and one pair of stockings, and a very good
suit of clothes of his own, which had heen worn hut very
little: in a word, he clothed me from head to foot.
It was a very kind and agreeahle present, as any one may
imagine, to one in my circumstances; but never was any
thing; in the world of that kind so unpleasant; awkward, and
uneasy as it was to nte to wear such clothes at their first put-
ting on.
After these ceremonies past, and after all his goad things
were brought into my little apartment, we began to consult
what was to be done with the prisoners we hail; for it was
-worth considering, whether we might venture to take them
away with us or no, especially two of them, whom we knew"
to be incorrigible and refractory to the last degree; and the
aaplain said he knew that they were such rogues, that
there was no obliging them; and if he did carry them away,
it must be in irons, as malefactors. to be delivered over to
justice, at the first English colony he could come at; and I
found that the captain himself was very anxious about it.
Upon this, I told him, that, if he desired it, I durst under-
take to bring the two men he spoke of, to make it their own
request that he should leave them upon the island. ' I
should be very glad of that,' says the captain, ' with ah my
heart.'
' Well,' said I. I will send for them, and talk with them
for you.' So 1 caused Friday and the two hostages, for they
were now discharged, their comrades having performed their
promise; I say, I caused them to go to the cave, and bring up
the five men, pinioned as they were, to the bower, and keep
them there till I came.
After some time, I came thither, dressed in my new
habit, and now I was called governor again. Bemg all met,
and the captain wilb me, I eaused the men to be brought be-
fore me, and 1 told them I had had a full account of their
villanous behaviour to the captain, and how they had run away
with the ship, and were preparing to commit farther robbe-
ries but that Providence had ensnared them in their own
ways, and that they were fallen into the pit which they had
digged for others.
I let them know that, by my direction, the ship had been
seized; that she lay now in the road, and they might see by-
and liv, that their new captain had received the reward of
his villany; for that they might see him hanging at the
yard-arm.
That as to them, I wanted to know what they had to say,
.why I should uot execute them as pirates, taken in the fact,
as by my commission they could not doubt I had authority
to do
One of them answered in the name of the rest, that they
had nothing to say but this, that when they were taken, the
captain promised them their lives, and they humuly implored
my mercy But I told them I knew not what mercy to show
them; for, as for myself, I had resolved to quit the island
with all my men, and had taken passage with the captain to
go for England: and as for the captain, he could not carry
them to England, other than as prisoners in irons, to be tried
for mutiny and running away with the ship; the consequence
of which, they must needs know, would be the gallows: so
that I could not tell which was best for them, unless they had
a mind to take their fate in the island; if they desired that, I
did not care, as I had liberty to leave it. I had some incli-
nation to give them their lives, If they thought they could
shift on shore. They seemed very thankful for it; said they
would much rather venture to stay there, than to be carried
to England to be hanged: so I left it on that issue.
However, the captain seemed to make some difficulty of it,
as if he durst not leave them there. Upon this I seemed a
little angry with the captain, and told him that they were my
prisoners, not his; and that seeing I had offered them so
much favour, I would be as good as my word. and that if he
did not think fit to consent to it, I would set them at liberty
as I found them; and if he did not like that, he might take
them again, if he could catch them
Upon this they appeared very thankful, and I accordingly
set them at liberty, and bade them retire into the woods, to
the place whence they came, and 1 would leave them some
fire-arms, some ammunition, and some directions how they
should live very well, if the> thought fit
Upon this I prepared to go on hoard the ship; hut told the
captain thai I would stay that night to prepare my things,
and desired him to go on board in the mean time, and keep
all right mi the ship, anil send the boat on shore the next day
for me; ordering him in the mean time to cause the new cap-
tain who was killed, to be hanged at the yard-arm, that these
men might see him
When the captam was gone, I sent for the men up to me in
my apartment, and entered seriously into discourse with them
of their circumstances I told them, I thought they had
made a right choice; that if the captain carried them away,
they would certainly be hanged. I showed them the new
captain hanging at the yard-arm of the ship, and told them
they had nothing less to expect.
When they had all declared their willingness to stay, I
then told them, I would let them into the story of my living
there, and put them into the way of making it easy to them.
Accordingly I gave them the whole history of the place, and
of my coming to it; showed them my fortifications, the way
I made my bread, planted my corn, cured my grapes; and in
a word, all that was necessary to make them easy. I told
them the story also of the sixteen Spaniards that were to be
expected; for whom 1 left a letter, and made them promise
to treat them in common with themselves.
I left them my fire-arms; viz. five muskets, three fowling-
pieces, and three swords. I had about a barrel and a half of
powder left; for after the first year or two I used but little,
and wasted none. 1 gave them a description of the way I
managed the goals, and directions to milk and fatten them, to
made both butter and cheese.
In a word, I gave them every part of my own story; and
1 told them I would prevail with the captain to leave them
two barrels of gunpowder more, and some garden-seeds,
.which I told them t would have been very glad of, also I gave
them the bag of pease which the captain had brought me to
eat, and bade them be sure to sow and increase them.
Having done all this, 1 left them the next day, and went
on board the ship. We prepared immediately to sail, hut did
not weigh that night. The next morning early, two of
the five men came swimming to the ship's side, and, making a
most lamentable complaint of the other three, begged to be
taken into the ship, for God's sake, for they should be mur-
dered; and begged the captain to take them on board, though
he hanged them immediately.
Upon this. the captain pretended to have no power without
roe; but after some difficulty, and after their solemn pro-
mises of amendment, they were taken on board, and were
X
, some time after soundly whipped and pickled; after which
they proved very honest and quiet fellows.
Some time after this, I went with the boat on shore, the
tide being up, with the things promised to the men, to which
the captain, at my intercession, caused their chests and
clothes to be added, which they took, and were very thankful
for ) also encouraged them, by telling them that if it lay
in my way to send any vessel to take them in, I would not
forget them.
When I took leave of this island, I carried on board, for
relics, the great goat-skin cap I had made, my umberella,
and one of my parrots; also I forgot not to take the money
I formerly mentioned, which had Iain by me so long useless,
that it was grown rusty, or tarnished, and could hardly
pass for silver, till it bad been a little rubbed and handled;
and also the money I found in the wreck of the Spanish
ship.
.\nd thus I left the island, the nineteenth of December, as
I found, by the ship's account, in the year 1686, after I had
oeen upon it eight-and twenty years, two months, and nine-
teen days; being delivered from the second captivity the same
clay of the month that I first made my escape in the barco-
longo, from among the Moors of Sallee.
In this vessel, after a long voyage, I arrived in England the
eleventh of June, in the year 1687, having been thirty-and-
five years absent.
When I came to England, I was as perfect a stranger to
all the world, as if I had never been known there. My bene-
factor, and faithful steward, whom I had left in trust with my"
money, was alive, but had had great misfortunes in the world,
-was become a widow the second time, and very low in the
world. I made her easy as to what she owed me, assuring
her I would give her no trouble; but, on the contrary, in
gratitude to her former care and faithfulness to me, I reliev-
ed her as mv little stock would afford, which at that time
would indeed allow me to do but little for her; but 1 assured
her I would never forget her former kmdness to me: nor did
I forget her, when I had sufficient to help her, as shall be
observed in its place.
I went down afterwards into Yorkshire; but my father
was dead, and my mother, and all the family extinct, except
thai I found two sisters, and two of the children of one of my
brothers; and asl had been long ago given over for dead, there
had been no provision made for me, so that, in a word, I
found nothing to relieve or assist me; and that the little mo-
ney I had, would not do much for me, as to settling in the
world.
I met with one piece of gratitude, indeed, which I did not
expect; and this was, that the master of the ship, whom I
had so happily delivered, and, by the same means, saved the
ship and cargo, having given a very handsome account to the
owners of the manner how I had saved the lives of the mea
and the ship, they invited me to meet them, and some other
merchants concerned, and all together made me a very hand-
some compliment upon the subject, and a present of almost two
hundred pounds sterling.
But after making several reflections upon the circumstances
of my life, and hnw little way this would go toward settling
me in the world, 1 resolved to go to Lisbon, and see if I might
not come by some information of the slate of my plantation
in the Brasils, and ot what was become of my partner, who I
had reason to suppose, had some years now given me over
for dead.
With this view, I took shipping for Lisbon, where I arrived
in April following: my man Friday accompanying me very
honestly in - all these ramblings, and proving a most faithful
servant upon all occasions.
When I came to Lisbon, I found out by inquiry, and to my
particular satisfaction, my old friend, the captain of the ship,
who first took me up at sea, off the shore of A trie. He was
nou grown old, and had left off the sea, having put his son,
who was far from a young man, into his ship, and who still
used the Brasil trade The old man did not know me, and
indeed I hardily knew him; but I soon brought myself to his
remembrance, when I told him who I was.
\fter some passionate expressions of our old acquaintance,
I inquired, you may be sure, after my plantation and my
partner. The old man told me he had not been in the Bra-
sils for about nine years; but that he could assure me, that
when he came away my partner was living, but the trustees,
whom 1 had joined with him to take cognisance of my part,
were both dead; that, however, he believed that I would have
a very good account of the improvement of the plantation, for
that, upon the general belief of my being cast away and.
drowned, my trustees had given in the account of the pro-
duce of my part of the plantation to the procurator fiscal, who
had appropriated it, in case I never came to claim it, one
third to the king, and two thirds to the monastery of St.
Augustine, to be expended for the benefit of the poor, and
for the conversion of the Indians to the catholic faith; but
that if I appeared, or any one for me, to claim the inheritance,
it would be restored; only that the improvement, or annual
production, being distributed to charitable uses, could not be
restored: but he assured me, that the steward of the king's
revenue (from lands), and the provedore, or steward of the
monastery, had taken great care all along, that the incumbent,
that is to say, my partner, gave every year a faithful account
of the produce, of which they received duly my moiety
I asked him if he knew to what height of improve ment he
had brought the plantation; and whether he thought it might
be worth looking after; or whether, on my going thither, I
should meet with no obstruction to my possessing my just
right in the moiety.
He told me he could not tell exactly to what degree the
plantation was improved; but this he knew, that my partner
was grown exceeding rich upon the enjoying but one half of
it; and that, to the best of his remembrance, he had heard
that the king's third of my part, which was, itseems, granted
away to some other monastery, or religious house, amounted
to above two hundred moidores, a year; that, as to my being
restored to the quiet possession of it, there was no question to
be made of that, my partner being alive to witness my title,
and my name being also enrolled in the register of the coun-
try. Also he told me, that the survivors of my two trustees
were very fair, honest people, and very wealthy; and he be-
lieved I would not only have their assistance for putting me
in possession, but would find a very considerable sum of mo-
ney in their hands, for my account, being the produce of the
farm, while their fathers -held the trust, and before it was
given up, as above, which, as he remembered, was for about
twelve years.
I shewed myself a little concerned and uneasy at this ac-
count, and inquired of the old captain how it came to pass
that the trustees should thus dispose of my effects, when he
knew that I had made my will, and had made him, the Por-
tuguese captain, my universal heir, etc.
He told me that was true, but that as there was no proof of
my being dead, he could not act as executor, until some certain
account should come of my death; and that, besides, he was
not willing to intermeddle with a thing so remote: that it was
true, he had registered my will, and put in his claim; and
could he have given any account of my being dead or alive,
he would have acted by procuration, and taken possession of
the ingenio (so they called the sugar house), and had given his
son, who was now it Brasils, order to do it.
' But,' says the old man. ' I have one piece of news to tell
you, which perhaps may not be so acceptable to you as the
rest, and that is, that, believing you were lost, and all the
world believing so also, your partner and trustees did offer to
account to me, in your name, for six or eight of the first years
of profits, which I received; but there being at that time,' sayi
he, * great disbursements for increasing the works, building
an ingenio, and buying slaves, it did not amount to near so
much as afterwards it produced. However,' says the old man,
' I shall give you a true account of what I have received in all,
and how I have disposed of it.' /
After a few days farther conference with this ancient friend,
he brought me an account of the first six years' income of my
plantation, signed by my partner, and the merchant's trustees,
being always delivered in goods; viz. tobacco in roll, and su-
gar in chests, besides rum, molasses, &e which is the conse-
quence of a sugar work; and I found, by this account, that
every year the income considerably increased. But, as above,
the disbursement being large, the sum at first was small.
However, the old man let me see that he was debtor to me
four hundred and seventy moidores of gold, besides sixty
chests of sugar, and fifteen double rolls of tobacco, which
were lost in bis ship, he having been shipwrecked coming'
home to Lisbon, about eleven years after my leaving the
place.
The good man then began to complain of his misfortunes,
and how he had been obliged to make use of my money to
recover his losses, and buy him a share in a new ship. ' How-
ever, my old friend,' says he,' you shall not want a supply in
your necessity; and as soon as my son returns, you shall be
fully satisfied. ^
Upon this he pulls out an old pouch, and giyf^pe one
hundred and sixty Portugal moidores in gold; and giving me
X2
the writings of his title to the ship which his son was gone to
the Brasils in, of which he was a quarter-part owner, and his
son another, he pats them both into my hands for security of
the rest.
I was too much moved with the honesty and kindness of
the poor man, to be able to bear this; and remembering what
he had done for me, how he had taken me up at sea, and how
generously he had used me on all occasions, and particularly
how sincere a friend he was now to me, I could hardily re-
frain from weeping at what he said to me. Therefore, first
I asked him if his circumstances admitted him to spare so
much money at that time, and if it would not straiten him.
He told me he could not say but it might straiten him a lit-
tle: but, however, it was my money, and I might want it more
than he.
Every thing the good man said was full of affection, and I
could hardly refrain from tears while he spoke. In short, I
took one hundred of the moidores, and called for a pen and
ink to give him a receipt for them; then I returned him the
rest, and told him, if ever I had possession of the plantation,
I would return the other to him also, as indeed I afterwards
did; and that, as to the bill of sale of his part in his son's
ship, I would not take it by any meaus; but that if I wanted
the money, 1 found he was honest enough to pay me; and if I
did not, but came to receive what he gave me reason to expect,
I would never have a penny more from him.
When this was passed, the old man began to ask me, if he
should put me in a method to make my claim to my planta-
tion. I told him, I thought to go over to it myself. He said,
I might do so, if I pleased; but that if I did not, there were
ways enough to secure my right, and immediately to appro-
priate the profits to my use; and as there were ships in the
river of Lisbon, justTeady to 40 away to Brasil, he made me
enter my name in a public register, with his affidavit, affirm-
ing, upon oath, that I was alive, and that 1 was the same per-
son who took up the land for the planting the said plantation
at first.
This being regularly attested by a notary, and a procura-
tion affixed, he directed me to send it with a letter of his
writing, to a merchant of his acquaintance at the place: and
then proposed my slaying with him till an account came of
the return.
Never any thing was more honourable than the procenl-
'fhgs upon this procuration; for in less than seven months I
received a large packet from the survivors of my trustees,
the merchants for whose account I went to sea, in which were
the following particular letters and papers enclose'::
First, There was the account current of the produce of my
farm, or plantation, from the year when their fathers had
balanced with my old Portugal captain, being for six years:
the balance appeared to be one thousand one hundred and
seventy-four moidores in my favour.
Secondly, There was the account of four years more, while
they kept the effects in their hands, before the government
claimed the administration, as being the effects of a person
not to be found, which they call civil death; and the balance
of this, the value of the plantation increasing, was to an
amount in crusadoes, which made three thousand two hun-
dred and forty-one moidores.
Thirdly, There was the prior of the Augustine's account,
who had received the profits for above fourteen years; but
not being able to account for what was disposed to the hos-
pital, very honestly declared he had eight hundred and seven-
ty-two moidores not distributed, which he acknowledged to
my account As to the king's part, that refunded nothing.
There was also a letter of my partner's congratulating mo
very affectionately upon my being alive, giving me an account
how the estate was improved, and what it produced a year,
with a particular of the number of squares or acres that it
contained: how planted; how many slaves there were upon it;
and, making two-and-twenty crosses for blessings, told me he
had said so many ' Ave Marias,' to thank the Blessed Virgin
that I was alive; inviting me very passionately to come over
and take possession of my own; and, in the mean time, to give
him orders to whom he should deliver my effects, if I did not
come myself; concluding with a hearty tender of his friend-
ship, and that of his family: and sent me, as a present, seven
fine leopards' skins, which he had, it seems, received from
Africa, by some other ship, which he had sent thither, and
who, it seems, had made a better voyage than I. He sent me
also five chests of excellent sweatmeats, and a hundred pieces
of gold uncoined; not quite so large as moidores.
By the same fleet, my two merchant-trustees shipped me
twelve hundred chests of sugar, eight hundred rolls of tobacj''
oo, and the rest of the whole account in gold.
I might well say now, indeed, that the latter end of Job
was better than the begmning. It is impossible to express
the flntterings of my very heart, when I looked over these
letters. and especially when I found all my wealth about me;
for as the Brasil ships come all in fleets, the same ships which
brought my letters brought my goods; and the effects were
safe in the Tagus before the letters came to my Tiand. In a
.word, I turned pale, and grew sick; and had not the old man
*un and fetched me a cordial, 1 believe the sudden surprise of
joy had overset nature, and I had died upon the spot.
Nay, after that, I continued very ill, and was so some hours,
till a physician beingsentfor, and something of thereat cause
of my illness being known, tie ordered me to be let blood;
after which I had relief, and grew well, but I verily beiieve,
if it had not been eased by the vent given in that manner to
the spirits, I should have died.
I was now master, all on a sudden, of above five thousand
pounds sterling in money, and had an estate, as 1 might well
eall it, in the Brasils, of above a thousand pounds a year, as
sure as an estate of lands in England; and, in a word, I was
in a condition which I scarce knew how to understand, or
how to compose myself for the enjoyment of.
The first thing I did, was to recompense my original bene-
factor, my good old captain, who had been first charitable to
me in my distress, kind to me in the beginning, and honest
to me at the end. I showed him all that was sent me. I
told him that, next to the providence of Heaven, which dis-
poses all things, it was owing to him; and that it now lay on
me to reward him, which I would do a hundredfold. So I
first returned to him the hundred moidores I had received
from him: then I sent for a notary, and caused him to draw up
a general release, or discharge, for the four hundred and
seventy moidores, which he had acknowledged he owed me,
in the fullest and firmest manner possible; after which I caused
a procuration to be drawn, empowermg him to be my re-
ceiver of the annual profits of my plantation, and appointing
my partner to account to him, and make the returns by the
usual fleets to him in my name. \nd a clause in the end,
heing a grant of one hundred moidores a year to him, during
his life, out of the effects; and fifty moidores a year to his son
after him. for his life: and thus I requited my old man.
I was now to consider which way to steer my course next,
and what to do with the estate that Providence had thus put
iato my hands; and, indeed, I had more care upon my head
now, than I had in my s lem state of life in the island, where
I wanted nothing hut what I had, and had nothing but what
I wanted; "whereas I had now a great charge upon me, and
my business was how to secure it. I had ne'er a cave now to
hide my mtytey in, or a place where it might lie without lock
or key, till it grew mouldy and tarnished before any body
vould meddle with it: on the contrary, I knew not where to
put it,' or whom to trust with it; my old patron the captain
indeed was honest, and that was the only refuge I had.
In the next place, my interest in the Brasils seemed to
summon me thither; but now I could not tell how to think of
gomg thither till I had settled my affairs, and left my effects
in some safe hands behind me. At first, I thought of my old
friend the widow, whom I knew was honest, and would be
just to me. but then she was in years, and but poor, and, tor
aught I knew, might be in debt. so that, in a word, 1 had no
w:!i but to go back to England myself, and take my effects
wiih me
I was some months, however, before I resolved upon this;
and therefore as I had rewarded the old captain fully, and to
his satisfaction, who had been my former benefactor, so I
began to think of my poor widow, whose husband had been
my first benefactor, and she, while it was to her power, my
faithful steward and instructor. So the first thing I did, I got
a merchant in Lisbon to write to his correspondent in Loudon,
not only to pay a bill. but to go find her out, and carry her in
money a hundred pounds from me, and to talk with her, and
oomfort her m her poverty, by telling her, she should, if I
lived, have a further supply. \i the same time, I sent my
two sisters in the country, each of them, a hundred pounds,
they being, though not in want, yet not in very good circum-
stances: one having been married, and left a widow, and-the
other having a husband, not so kind to her as he should be-
But among all my relations or acquaintance I could not yet
pitch upon one, to whom I durst commit the gross of my
stock, that I might go away to the Brasils, and leave things
safe behind me; and this greatly perplexed me.
I had once a mind to have gone to the Brasils, and have
settled myself there: for I was, as it were naturalized to the
place; but I had some little scruple in my mind about reli-
gion, which insensibly drew me back,. ot which 1 shall say
more presently. However, it was not religion that kept me
from going thither for the present; and as I had made no
scruple of being openly of the religion of the country all the
while 1 was among them, so neither did I yet, only that now
and then having of late thought more of it than formerly,
when I began to think of living and dying among them, I
hegan to regret my having professed myself a papist, and
thought it might not be the best religion to die with.
But, as I have said, this was not the main thing that kept
me from going to the Brasils, but that really I did not know
with whom to leave mv effects behind me; so I resolved at
last to gn to England with them, where, if I arrived, I con-
cluded 1 should make some acquaintance, or find some rela-
tions thai would be faithful to me: and accordingly I prepa-
red to go for England with all my wealth.
In order to prepare things for my going home, 1 first (tha
Brasil fleet being just going away) resolved to give anwers
suitable to the just and faithful account of things I had from
thence. \nd first to the prior of St Augustine I wrote a let-
ter full of thanks for his just dealings, and the offer of the
eight hundred and seventy-two moidores, which was undis-
posed of, which I desired might be given, fire hundred to
the monastery, and three hundred and seventy-two to the poor,
as the prior should-direct; desiring the good padre's prayers
fo' me; and the like.
I wrote next a letter of thanks to my two trustees, with
all the acknowledgement that so much justice and honesty
called for; as for sending them any present, they were &r
above having any occasion for it.
Lastly, I wrote to my partner, acknowledging his industry
m the improving the plantation, and his integrity in increasing;
the stock of the works, giving him instructions for his future
government of my part, according to the powers I had left
with my old patron, to whom 1 desired him to send whatever
became due to me, till he should hear from me more particu-
larly; assuring him that it was my intention not only to come
to him, hut to settle myself there for the remainder of ray
life: to this I added a very handsome present of some Italian
silks for his wife and two daughters, for such the captain's
son informed me he had; with two pieces of fine English
broad-cloth, the best I could get m l,:sbon, five pieces oC
black baiie, and some i'landers lace of a good quality.
Haling thus settled my affairs, sold my cargo, and turned
all my effects into good bills of exchange, my next difficulty
was, which way to go to England. I had been accustomed
enough to the sea, and yet I had a strange aversion to go to
England by sea at that time. and though 1 eould'give no rea-
son for it, yet the difficulty increased upon me so much, that
though I bad once shipped my baggage m order to go, yet I
altered my mind, and that not once, but two or three times.
It is true, I had. been very unfortunate by sea, and this
might be one of the reasons' but let no man slight the strong
impulses of his own thoughts in cases of such moment. Two
of the ships which I had singled out to go in, I mean more
particularly singled out than any other, that is to say, so as
in one of them to put my things on board, and in the other to
have agreed with the captain; I say, two of these ships mis-
carried, viz. one was taken by the Algerines, and the other
was cast away on the Start near Torbay, and all the people
drowned except three: so that in either of those vessels I had
been made miserable, and in which most, it was hard to say.
Having been thus harassed in my thoughts, my old pilot,
to whom I communicated every thing, pressed me earnestly
not to go by sea; but either to go by land to the Groyne, and
cross over the bay of Biscay to Rochelle, from whence it was
but an easy and safe journey by land to Paris and so to Calais
and Dover; or to go up to Madrid. and so all the way by land
through France.
In a word, I was so prepossessed against my going by sea
at all, except from Calais to Dover, that I resolved to travel
all the way by laud, which, as I was not in haste, and did not
value the charge, was by much the pleasanter way; and to
make it more so, my old captain brought an English gentle-
man, the son of a merchant in Lisbon, who Was willing to
travel with me: after which, we picked up two more, who
were English, and merchants also, and two young Portuguese
gentlemen, the last going to Paris only; so that we were in
all six of us. and five servants: the two merchants, and the
two Portuguese, contenting themselves with one servant be-
tween two, to save the charge. and as for me, 1 got an En-
glish sailor to travel with me as a servant, besides my man
Friday, who was too much a stranger to be capable of sup-
ply ing the place of a servant upon the road.
In this manner I set out from Lisbon: and our company
being all very well mourned and armed, we made a little
troop, -whereof they did nie the honour to call me Captain*.
as well because I was the oldest man, as because I had twe
servants, and indeed, was the original of the whole journey.
\a I have troubled you withinone of my sea journals, so
shall I trouble you with none of lit> land journal: but some
adventures that happened to us in this tedious and difficult
journey, I must not omit
When we came to Madrid, we being all of us strangers to
Spain, were willing to stay some time to see the court of
Spain, and to see what was worth observing: but it being the
latter part of the summer, we hastened away, and set out
from Madrid about the middle of October Hut when we
came to the edge of Navarre, we were alarmed at several
towns on the way, with an account that so much snow was
fallen on the French side of the mountains that several
travellers were obliged to come hack to Pampeluna, after ha-
ving attempted, at an extreme hazard, to pass on
When we came to Pampeluna, itself, we found it so indeed;
and to me, that had been always used to a hot climate, and
indeed to countries where we could scarce bear any clothes
on, the cold was insufferable. Nor indeed was it more pam-
ful than it was surprising, to come but ten days before out of
the Old Castile, where the weather was not only warm, but
very hot: and immediately to feel a wind from the Pyrenean
mountains, -.oveiy keen, so severely cold, as to be intolerable,
and to endanger benumbing and perishing of our fingers and
toes.
Poor Friday was really frighted when he saw the moun-
tains all covered with snow. and felt cold weather, which he
hat) never seen or felt before in his life
To mend the matter after we came to Pampeluna, it con-
tinued snowmg with so much violence, and so long, that the
people said winter was come before its time, and the roads,
which were difficult before, were now quite impassable; in a
word, the snow lay in some places too thicK for us to travel;
and being not hard frozen, as is the case in northern countries,
there was no going without being in danger of being buried
alivt every step. We staid no less than twenty days at Pam-
peluna, (when seeing the winter coming on, and no likelihood
of its being better, for it was the severest winter all over Eu-
rope that had been known in man; years) I proposed that we
should all go away to Fontarabia, and there take shipping for
Bourdeaux, which was a very little voyage.
But while we were considering this, there came in four
French gentlemen, who, having been stopped on the French
side of the passes, as we were on the Spanish, had found out
a guide, who traversing the country near the head ef Langue-
doc, had brought them over the mountains by such ways, that
they were not much incommoded with the snow; and where
they met with snow in any quantity, they said it was frozen
hard enough to bear them. and their horses.
We sent for this guide, who told us, he would undertake to
carry us the same way, with no hazard from the snow, pro-
vided we were armed sufficiently to protect us from wild
beasts; for he said, upon these great snows, it was frequent
for some wolves to show themselves at the foot of the moun-
tains. being made ravenous for want of food, the ground being
covered with snow. We told him we were well enough pre-
pared for such creatures as they were, if he wonld ensure us
from a kind of two-legged wolves, which we were told we were
in most danger from, especially on the French side of the
mountains
He satisfied us there was no danger of that kind in the way
that we were to go. So we readily agreed to follow him; as
did also twelve other gentlemen, with their servants, some
French, some Spanish, who, as I said, had attempted to go, aud
were obliged to come back again.
Accordingly we all set out from Pampeluna. with our guide,
on the fifteenth of November; and indeed, I was surprised,
when, instead of going forward, he came directly back with
us, on the same road that we came from Madrid, above twenty
miles; when having passed two rivers, and come mto the plain
country, we found ourselves m a warm climate again, where
the country was pleasant, and no snow to be seen; but on a
sudden, turning to the left, he approached the mountains
another way; and though it is true, the hills and the precipices)
looked dreadful, yet he made so many tours, such meanders,
and led us by such windmg ways, we were insensibly passed
the height of the mountains, without being much encumber-
ed with the snow; and, all on a sudden he showed us the
pleasant fruitful provinces of Languedoc and Gascoigne, all
green anil flourishing; though indeed they were at a great
disjunct-, and we had some rough way to pass vet.
We were a little uneasy, however, when we found it snow-
ed one v. hole day, and at night so fast that we could not travel;.
hul he bade us be easy, we should soun be past it all. We
found indeed, that we began to descend every day, and to
come more north than before: and so, depending upon our
guide, we went on.
It was about two hours before night, when our guide being
something before us, and not just in sight, out rushed three
monstrous wolves. and after them a bear, out of a hollow way,
adjoinmg to a thick nood. Two of the wolves flew upon the
guide, and bad he been half a mile before us he had been dc-
voured mdeed, before we could have helped him. One of
them fastened upon his horse, and the other attacked the
mini with that violence, that he had not time, or not presence
of mind enough, to draw his pistol, but hallooed and cried nut
to us most lustily. My man Friday being next to me, I bade
him ride up, and see what was the matter. As soon as Fri-
day came in sight of the man, he hallooed as loud as the
other, ' O master! O master?' but, like a bold fellow, rode
directly up to the man, and, with a pistol, shot the wolf that
attacked him into the head.
It was happy for the poor man that it was my man Friday;
for he, having been used to that kind of creature in lis coun-
try, had no fear upon him, but went close up to him, and shot
him as ahove: whereas any of us would have fired at a farther
distai.ee, anil have, perhaps, either missed the wolf, or en-
dangered shooting the man.
Bui it was enough to have terrified a bolder man than I;
and indeed it alarmed all our company, when, with the noise
of Friday's pistol, wi- heard on both sides the dismalcst howl-
ing of wolves, and the noise redoubled by the echo of the
mountams, that il was to us as if there had been a prodiginui
multitude of them; and perhaps indeed there were not such
a few, as that we had no cause of apprehensions.
However, as Friday had killed this wolf, the other, that had
fastened upon the horse, left him immediately, and fled, hav-
ing happily fastt ned upon his head, where the bosses of the
bridle had stuck in his teeth, so that he had not done him
much hurt. The man, mdeed, was most hurt; for the raging
creature had bit him twice, once on the arm, and the other
time a Tittle above his knee; and he was just, as it were,
tumbling down bv the disorder of his horse, when Friday
nmc up, and shot the wolf.
It is easy to suppose, that at the noise of Friday's pistol we all
mended our pace, and rid up, as fast as the way (which was
ver> difficult) would give us leave, to see what was the matter.
As soon as we came clear of the trees, which blmded us be-
fore, we saw plainly what hud been the case, and how Friday
had disengaged the poor guide; though we did not presently
discern what kind of creature it was he had killed-
Hut never was a fight managed so hardily, and in such a
surprising manner, as that which followed between Friday'
and the bear, which gave us all (though at first we were sur-
prised and afraid for him) the greatest diversion imaginable.
As the bear is a heavy, clumsy creature, and does not gultcp
as the wolf docs, which is swift and light; so he has two par-
ticular qualities, which generally are the rule of his actions.
First, as to men, who are not his proper prey I say, not his
proper prey, because, though I cannot say what excessive
hunger might do, which was now their case, the ground being
all coveted with snow; yet, as to men, he does not usually at"
tempt them, unless they first attack him: on the contrary, if
you meet him in the woods, though if you do not meddle w,th
him, he will not meddle with you, yet then you mus' take
care to be very civil to him, and give him the road; for be is
a very nice gentleman. he will not go a step out of his way for <
a prince; nay, if you are really afraid, your best way is to look
another way, and. keep going on: for sometimes if you stop
and stand still, and look steadfastly at him, he takes it for an
affront; but if you throw or toss any thing at him, arid it hits
him, though it were but a bit of a stick, as big as your finger,
he takes it for an affront, and sets all other business aside to
pursue his revenge, for he will have satisfaction in point of
honour: and this is his first quality. The next is, that if he
be once affronted, he will never leave you, night or day, till
he has his revenge, but follow, at a good round rate, tilt he
overtakes you.
My man Friday had delivered our guide, and when we
came up to him, he was helping him of)- from his horse. for
the man was boil) hurt and frighted, aud indeed the last more
than the first: when, on a sudden, we spied the bear come out
of the wood, and a vast monstrous one it was, the biggest by
But Friday put us out of doubt quickly; for seeing the bear
ding fast to the bough, and that he would not be persuaded to
come any farther, "Well, well,' said Friday,' you no come
farther, me go, me go; you no come to me, me come to you.'
And upon this, he goes out to the smallest end of the bough,
where it should bend with his weight, and gently lets himself
down by it sliding down the bough, till he came near enough
to jump down on his feet, and away he ran to his gun, takes it
up and stands still.
' Well,' said I to him,' Friday what will you do now? Why
don't you shoot him'' ' No shoot,' says Friday, ' no yet, me
shoot now, me no kill: me stay, give you one more laugh.'
And mdeed so he did, as you will see presently; for when the
bear saw his enemy gone, he comes back from the bough
where he stood; but did it mighty leisurely, looking behind
him every step, and coming backward till he got into the bo-
dy of the tree. Then with the same hinderend foremost, he
ijanie down the tree, grasping it with his claws, apd moving
one foot at a time, very leisurely: at this juncture, and just
before he could set his hind feet upon the ground, Friday
Mepped close to him, clapped the muzzle of his piece into his
car, and shot him dead as a stone.
Then the rogue turned about, to see if we did not laugh;
and when he saw we were pleased by our looks, he falls a
laughing himself very loud. ' So we kill bear in my country'
says Friday 'So you kill thecal' said 1: 'why you have no
guns' ' No,'says he;'no gun; but shoot great, much, long
arrow.'
This was, indeed, a good diversion to us; but we were still
m a wild place, and our guide very much hurt, and what to do
we hardly knew; the howling of wolves ran much- in my head;
and mdeed, except the noise I once heard on the shore of
Africa, of which I have said something already, 1 never heard
any thing that tilled me with so much horror.
Thestf things, and the approach of night, called us off,
or else, as Friday would have hail us, we should certainly
have taken the skin of this monstrous creature off, which
was worth saving; but we had three leagues to go, and our
guide hastened us; so we left him, and went forward on our
journey.
1 he ground was still covered with snow, though not so
deep and dangerous as on the mountains; and the ravenous
creatures, as we heard afterwards, were come down into the
forest and plam country, pressed by hunger, to seek for food;
end had done a great deal of mischief in the villages, where
they surprised the country people, killed a great many of
their sheep and horses, and some people too.
We had one dangerous place to pass, of which our guide
told us, if there were any more wolves in thi country, we
should find them there; and this was a small plain, surround-
ed with woods on every side, and a long, narrow defile or lane*
which we were to pass, to get through the wood, and then we
should come to the village where we were to lodge
It was within half an hour of sun-set, when we entered the
first wood; and a little after sun-set, when we came into the
plain. We met with nothing1 in the first wood, except that,
in a little plain, within the wood, which was not above two
furlongs over,' we saw five great wolves cross the road, full
speed, one after another, as if they had been in chase of some
prey, and had it in view. They took no notice of us, and
were gone, and out of our sight in a few moments.
Upon this, our guide, who, by the way, was a wretched.
faint hearted fellow, bade us keep in a ready posture; for he
believed there were more wolves a coming.
We kept our arms ready, and our eyes about us; but we
saw no more wolves till we came through that wood, which
was near half a league, and entered the plain. As soon as we
came into the plain, we had occasion enough to look about us.
. The first object we met with, was a dead horse; that is to say,
a poor horse, which the wolves had killed, and at least a
dozen of them at work; we could not say eating of him, but
picking of his bones rather; for they had eaten up all the flesh
before.
We did not think fit to disturb them at their feast, neither
did they take much notice of us. Friday would have let fly
at them, but I would not suffer him by any means; for I found
we were like to have more business upon our hands than we
were awaie of. We were not gone half over the plain, but
we began to hear the wolves howl, in the wood on our left,
in a frightful manner; and, presently after, we saw about a
hundred coming on directly towards us, all in a body,-and
most of them in u line, as regularly as an army drawn up by
experienced officers. I scarce knew in what manner to re*
eeive them: but found to draw ourselves in a close line, was
the only way. So we formed in a moment. But that we
might not have too much mterval, I ordered that only every
other man should fire, and that the others, who had not fired,
should stand ready to give them a second volley immediately,
if they continued to advance upon us; and that then those
who had fired at first should not pretend to load their fusils
again, but stand ready with every one a pistol; for we were
all armed with a fusil, and a pair of pistols, each man: so we
were, by this method, able to fire six volleys, half of us at a
time. However, at present, we had no necessity; for, upon
firing the first volley, the enemy made a full stop, being ter-
rified as well with the noise as with the fire: four of them
bemg shot into the head, dropped; several others were wound-
ed, and went bleeding off, as we could see by the snow. I.
found they stopped, but did not immediately retreat; where-
upon remembering that I had been told, that the fiercest
creatures were terrified at the voice of man, I caused all our
company to halloo as loud as we could: and I found the no-
tion not altogether mistaken; for, upon our shout, they hegan
to retire, and turn about: then I ordered a second volley to be
fired in their rear, which put them to the gallop, and away
they went to the woods.
This gave us leisure to charge our pieces again, and that
we might lose no time, we kept doing. but we had but little
more than loaded our fusils, and put ourselves into a readiness,
when we heard a terrible noise in the same wood on our left;
only that it was farther onward, the same way that we were
to go.
The night was coming on, and the light began to be dusky,
which made it the worse on our side; but the noise increasing,
we could easily perceive that it was the howling and yelling
of those hellish creatures; anil, on a sudden, we perceived two
or three troops of wolves, one on our left, one behind us, and
one in our front: so that we seemed to be surrounded with
them. However, as they did not fall upon us, we kept our
way forward, as fast as we could make our horses go, which, the
way being very rough,~was only a good, large trot; and in this
manner we only came in view of the entrance of the wood,
through which we were to pass, at the farther side of the
plain; but we were greatly surprised, when, coming near the
lane, or p»ss, we saw a confused number of wolves standing
just at the entrance.
On a sudden, at another opening of the wood, we heard
the noise of a gun; and, lookmg that way, out rushed a
horse with a saddle and a bridle on him, flying like the
wind, and sixteen or seventeen wolves after him, full speed.
Indeed, the horse had the heels of them; hut, as we sup-
posed that he could not hold it at that rate, we doubted not
but they would get up with him at last; and no question bat
they did.
Here we had a most horrible sight; for, riding up to the
entrance where the horse came out, we found the carcass of
another horse, and of two men devoured by the ravenous
creatures, and one of the men was no doubt the same whom
we heard fire the gun; for there lay a gun just by him fired
off; but, as to the man, his head, aud the upper part of his
body, were eaten up
This filled us with horror, and we knew not what course to
take. but the. creatures resolved us soon, for they gathered
about us presently, in hopes of prey: and I verily believe
there were three hundred of them. It happened very much
to our advantage, that at the entrauce into the wood, but a
little way from it, there lay some large timber trees, which
had been cut down the summer before, and I suppose lay
therefor carriage. I drew my little troop in among these
trees, and placing ourselves in a line, behind one long tree, I
advised them all to alight, and, keeping that tree before us,
for a breastwork, to stand in a triangle or three fronts; en-
closing our horses in the centre.
We did so. and it was well we did, for never was a more
furious charge than the creatures made upon us in this place:
they came on us with a growling kind of noise, and mounted
the piece of timber (which, as I said, was our breastwork), as
if they were only rushing upon their prey; and this fury of
theirs, it seems, was principally occasioned by their seeing
our horses behind us; which was the prey they aimed at- I
ordered our men to fire as before, every other man. and they
took their aim so sure, that indeed they killed several of the
wolves at the first volley: but there was a necessity to keep a
continual firing, for they came on like devils, those behind
pushing on those before
When we had fired our second volley of our fusils, we
thought they stopped a little, and I hoped they would have
gone off, but it was but a moment, for others came forward
258 ROBINSON CRUSOE.
these four firings, we killed seventeen or eighteen of them,
and lamed twice as many: yet they came on again.
I was Loath to spend our last shot too hastily; so I called
my servant, not my man Friday, for he was better employed;
for, with the greatest dexterity imaginable, he charged my
fusil, and his own, while we were engaged, but, as I said, I
called my other man; and giving him a horn of powder, I
bade him lay a train, all along the piece of timber, and let it
be a large train. He did so, and had but just time to get
away, when the wolves came up to it, and some were got up
upon il, when I, snapping an uncharged pistol, close to
the powder, set it on fire Those that were upon the
timber were scorched with it, and six or seven of them fell,
or rather jumped in among us, with the force and fright of
the fire. We dispatched these m an instant, and the
rest were so frighted with the light, which the night, for now
it was very near dark, made more terrible, that they drew
back a little.
Upon which, I ordered our last pistols to be fired off in
one volley, and after that we gave a shout: upon this, the
wolves turned tail, and we sallied immediately upon near
twenty lame ones, which we found struggling on the ground,
and fell a cutting them with our swords; which answered ouc
expectation; for the crying and howling they made were
better understood by their fellows, so that they all fled, and
left us.
We had, first and last, killed about threescore of them;
and had it been daylight, we had killed many more. The
field of battle being thus cleared, we made forward again; for
we had still near a league to go. We heard the ravenous
creatures howl and yell in the woods as we went, several
times. and sometimes we fancied we saw some of them, but
the snow dazzling our eyes, we were not certain: so in about
an hour more, we came to the town,»where we were to
lodge, which we found in a terrible fright, and all in arms;
for it seems, that, the night before, the wolves and some
bears had broken into the village, and put them in a terrible
fright; and they were obliged to keep guard, night and day,
but especially in the night; to preserve their cattle, and iu.
deed their poeple.
The next morning our guide was so ill, and his limbs so
'swelled with the rankling of his two wounds, that he could
go no farther; so we were obliged to take a new guide there,
and go to Tholouse, where we found a warm climate, a fruit-
ful pleasant country, and no snow, no wolves, or any thing
like them But when we told our story at Tholouse, they
told us it was nothing but what was ordinary in the great
forest, at the foot of the mountains, especially when the
snow lay on the ground But they mquired much what kind
of a guide we had gotten, that would venture to bring us that
way in such a severe season; and told us, it was very much we
were not all devoured. When we told them how we placed our-
selves, and the horses in the middle, they blamed us exceed-
ingly, and told us, it was fifty to one, but we had been all de-
stroyed; for it was the sight of the horses that made the
wolves so furious, seeing their prey, and that at other times
they are really afraid 6i a gun; but they being excessive
hungry, and raging on that account, the eagerness to come
at the horses had made them senseless of danger; and
that if we had not by the continued fire, and at last by the
stratagem of the train of powder, mastered them, it had
been great odds but that we had been torn to pieces; where-
as had we been content to have sat still on horseback, and
fired as horsemen, they would not have taken the horses
so much for their own, when men were on their backs,
as otherwise; and, withal, they told us, that, at last, if we
had stood all together, and left our horses, they would
have been so eager to have devoured them, that wt might
have come off safe, especially having our fire-arms in our
hands, and being so many in number.
For my part I was never so sensible of danger in my life;
for seeing above three hundred devils come roaring and opeu-
mouthed to devour us, and having nothing to shelter us, or
retreat to, I gave myself over for lost; and, as it was, I believe,
I shall never care to cross those mountains again; I think I
would much rather go a thousand leagues by sea, though I
were sure to meet with a storm once a week.
I nave nothing uncommon to take notice of in my passage
through France; nothing but what other travellers have given
an account of, with much more advantage than 1 can I
travelled from I holouse to Paris, and, without any consider-
able stay, came to Calais, ant1. landed safe at Dover, the four-
teeoth of January, after having had a severe cold season to
travel in.
I was now come to the centre of my travels, and had, in
a little time, all my new-discovered estate safe about me; the
bills of exchange which I brought with me having been very
currently paid.
My principal guide, and privy-counsellor, was my good,
ancient widow, who, who in gratitude for the money I bad
sent her, thought no pains too much, er care too great, to"
employ for me; and I trusted her so entirely with every
thing, that I was perfectly easy as to the security of my
effects: and indeed I was very happy from my beginning, and
now to the end, in the unspotted integrity of this good gentle-
woman.
And now I began to think of leaving my effects with this
woman, and setting out for Lisbon, and so to the Brasils.
But now another scruple came in my way, and that was re-
ligion; for as I had entertained some doubts about the Roman
religion, even while I was abroad, especially in my state of
solitude: so I knew there was no going to the Brasils for me,
much less going to settle there, unless I resolved to embrace
the Roman catholic religion, without any reserve; except. on
the other hand, I resolved to be a sacrifice to my prmciples,
be a martyr for religion, and die in the inquisition: so 1 re-
solved to stay at home, and, if I could find means for it, to
dispose of my plantation.
To tltts purpose I wrote to my old friend at Lisbon, who,
in return, gave me notice, that he could easily dispose of it
there; but that, if I thought fit to give him leave to offer it
in my name to the two merchants, the survivors of my trus-
tees, who lived in the Brasds, who must fully understand the
value of it, who lived just upon the spot, and whom t knew
to be very rich; so that he believed they would be fond of
buying it; he did not doubt, but I should make four or five
thousand pieces of eight the more of it.
Accordingly 1 agreed, gave him order to offer it to them,
and he did so; and in about eight months more, the ship
being then returned, he sent me an account, that they had
accepted the offer, and had remitted thirty-three thousand
pieces of eight to a correspondent of theirs at Lisbon, to pay
foe it.
In return, I signed the instrument of sale in the form
which they sent from Lisbon, and sent it to my old man,
-who sent me bills of exchange for thirty-two thousand eight
hundred pieces of eight, for the estate, reserving the payment
of one hundred moidores a year to him, the old man, during
his life, and fifty moidores afterward to his son for his life,
which I had promised them; and which the plantation was to
make good as a rent-charge
And thus I have given the first part of a life of fortune ani
adventure, a life of Providence's checker-work, and of a va-
riety which the world will seldom be able to show the like of.
Beginning foolishly, but closing much more happily J.han any
part of it ever gave me leave so much as to hope..for.
Any one would think, that, in this state of complicated
good fortune, I was past runnmg any more hazards; a'.id so
indeed I had been, if other circumstances had concurred: but
I was inured to a wandering life, had no family, nor many
relations, nor, however rich, had I contracted much acquaint-
ance; and though I had sold my estate in the ISrasils, yet I
could not keep that country out of my head, and had a great
mind to be upon the wing again; especially I could not restst
the strong inclination I had to see my island, and to know if
the poor Spaniards were in being there, and how the rogues
I left there had used them.
My true friend, the -widow, earnestly dissuaded me from
it, and so far prevailed with me, that for almost seven years
she prevented my running abroad: during which time I took
my two nephews, the children of one of my brothers, into
my care. The eldest having something of his own, I bred up
as a gentleman, and gave him a settlement of some addition
to his estate after my disease; the other I put out to a cap-
tain of a ship: and after five years, finding him a sensible,
hold, enterprising young fellow, I put him into a good ship,
and sent him to sea. And this young fellow afterwards drew
jne in, as old as 1 was, to farther adventures myself
In the mean time, I in part settled myself here; for first of
all I married, and that not either to my disadvantage or dis-
satisfaction; and had three children, two sons and one daugh-
ter. But my wife dying, and my nephew coming home, with
good success, from a voyage to Spain, my mclination to go
abroad, and his importunity prevailed, and engaged me to go
Z
in his ship as a private trader to the East Indies. This was
in the year 1694.
In this voyage, I visited my new colony in the Island, saw
my successors, the Spaniards, had the whole story of their
lives, and of the villains I left there, how at first they insulted
the poor Spaniards, how they afterwards agreed, disagreed,
united, separated, and how at last the Spaniards were obliged
to use violence with them; how they were subjected to the
Spaniards; how honestly the Spaniards used them, a history,
if it were entered into, as full of variety and wonderful acci-
dents, as my own part: particularly also as to their battles
with the Caribbeans, who landed several times upon the
island, and as to the improvement they made upon the island
itself; and how five of them made an attempt upon the main
land, and brought away eleven men and five women prisoners,
by which, at my coming, I found about twenty young children
on the island.
Here I staid about twenty days, left them supplies of all
necessary things, and particularly of arms, powder, shot,
clothes, tools, and two workmen, which I brought from Eng-
land with me; viz. a carpenter and a smith-
Besides this, I shared the island into parts with them, re-
served to myself the property of the whole, but gave them
such parts respectively as they agreed on; and having settled
all things with them, and engaged them not to leave the
place, I left them there.
From thence I touched at the Brasils, from whence I sent
a bark, which I bought there, with more people, to the
island; and in it, besides other supplies, I sent seven women,
being such as I found proper for service, or for wives to such
us would take them. As to the Englishmen, I promised
them to send them some women from England, with a good
cargo of necessaries, if they would apply themselves to plant-
ing, which I afterwards could not perform. The fellows
proved very honest and diligent, after they were mastered;
and had their properties set apart for them. I sent them also
from the Brasils five cows, three of them being big with calf,
some sheep, and some hogs, which, when I came again, were
considerably increased.
But all these' things, with an account how three hundred
Canbbees came and invaded them, and ruined their planta-
tions, and how they fought with that whole number twice»
and were at first defeated, and one of them killed; but at last
a storm destroying their enemies canoes, they famished or
destroyed almost all the rest, and renewed and recovered the
possession of their plantation, and still lived upon the island:
All these things, with some very surprising incidents, in
some new adventures of my own, for ten years more, I may,
perhaps, give a farther account of hereafter.
