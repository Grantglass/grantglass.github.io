THE
PREFACE.
HE Success the former Part of this
Work has met with in the Worlds
has yet been no other, than is ac-
knowledgd to be due to the surprising
Variety of the Subject, and to th?
agreeable Manner of the Performance.
ALL the Endeavours of envious People tore-
f roach it vcith being a Romance, to starch it for
Errors in Geography, Inconsistency in the Relation,
ami Contradictions in the Fast, have proved abor-
tive, and as impotent U6 malicious.
"THE just Application of every Incident, the
religious and useful Inferences drawn from every
Part, are so many 'Testimonies to the good Design
of making it pnblick, and muft legitimate all the
Part that may be call'd Invention, or Parable in
the Story.
THE Second Part, if the Editor's Opinion
may pass, is (contrary to the Usage of Second
Parts,) every Way as entertaining as the Firf?>
contains cw strange and surprising Incidents, and

as great a Variety of them-, nor is the Application
less fa ions, or suitable; and doubtless will, to the
sober, as well as ingenious Reader, be every way as
profitable and diverting; and this makes the a-
bridging this Work, as scandalous, as it is
hnavijh and ridiculous ; feeing, while to storten
the Bock, that they may seem to reduce the Value,
they strip it of all those Refieftions, as xvell religi-
ous as moral, which fire not only the greatest
Beauties of the Work, but are calculated for
the infinite Advantage of the Reader.
B Y this they leave the Work naked of its
brightest Ornaments; and yet they would, at the
j ame time pretend, that the Author has supply d
the Story out of his Invention, they take from it
the Improvement, which alone recommends that In-
vention to wife and good Men,
If HE Injury these Men do to the Proprietor
of this Work, is a PraSlice all honest Men
abhor; and he believes he may challenge them to
fttw the Difference between that and Robbing on the
Highway, or Breaking open a House,
IF they cant shew any Difference in the Crime,
thy will find it hard to shew why there should fa
any Dff-renco in the Punistment: And he will
anjwer for it, that nothing shall be wanting on
his Part, to do them Justice,

before, and after near seven Years
of Peace and Enjoyment in the Fulness of ail Things; grown
old, and when, if ever> it might be allowed me to have
had Experience of every State of .middle Life, and to know
which was moil adapted to make a Man compka'ly hap-

count of in my first Setting out into the World, to have

inclined
(6)
Snclin'd lo stay at Home, and have done venturing Life
and Fortune any more,
Nay farther, the common Motive of foreign Adven-
tures was taken away in me; for I had no Fortune to
make, I had nothing to seek: If I had gained ten thousand
Pound, I had been no richer j for I had already sufficient
tor me, and for those I had to leave it to; and that I had was
visibly increasing; for having no great Family, I could no?
spend the Income of what I had, unless I would set up for
an expensive Way of Living, such as a great Family, Servants,
Equipage, Gayety, and the like, which were Tningsl had
no Notion of, or Inclination to \ so that I had nothing
indeed to do, but to fit still, and fully enjoy what I had
got, and fee it increase daily upon my Hands.
Y e t all these Things had no effect upon me, or at least
not enough to resist the strong Inclination I had to go A-
broad again, which hung about me like a chronical Di-
stempers particularly the Desire of seeing my new Planta-
tion in the Island, and the Colony I left there, run in my
Head continually. I dream'd of it all Night, and my
Imagination run upon it all Day j it was uppermost in all
my Thoughts, and my Fancy work'd so steadily and strong-
ly upon it, that I talk'd of it in my Sleep; in short, no-
thing could remove it out of my Mind 5 it even broke so
violently into all my Discourses, that it made my Conver-
sation tiresome * for I could talk of nothing else, all my
Discourse run into it, even to Impertinence, and I saw it
my self.
I have often heard Persons of good Judgment fay,
That all the Stir People make in the World about Ghosts
•and Apparitions,is owing to the Strength of Imagination,
and the powerful Operation of Fancy in their Minds > that
there is no such Thing as a Spirit appealing, or a Ghost
walking, and the like: That Peoples poring affectionately
upon the past Conversation of their deceas'd Friends, io
realizes it to tliem, that they are capable of fancying up-
on some extraordinary Circumstances, that they see them}
talk to them, and are answered by them, when, in Truth,
there is nothing but Shadow and Vapour in the Thing j
and they really know nothing of the Matter.
For my Part, I know not to this Hour, whether there
are any such Things as real Apparitions, Spectres, or walk-
ing
Thing in the Stories they tell us of that kind, more than
the Product: of Vapours, sick Minds, and wandring Fan-
cies; But this I know, that my Imagination work'd up
to such a Height, and brought. me into such Exccefs of
Vapours, or what else I may call it, that I actually sup-
pbs'd my self, oftentimes upon the Spot, at my old Castle
behind tie Trees; saw my old Spaniard, Friday's Father,
and the reprobate Sailors who I left upon the Island nay, I
fancy'd I talk'd with them, and look'd at them so steadi-
ly, thoJ I was broad awake, as. at Persons just before me;
and this I did, till I often frighted my serf with the Images
my Fancy represented to me: One Time in my Sleep I had
the Villany of the three Pyrate Sailors, ib lively related to me
by the first Spaniard and Friday's Father, that it was surpriz-
ing they told me how they barbarously attempted to murder
all the Spaniards, and that they set Fire to the Provisions they
had laid up, on purpose to distress and starve them 5 Things
that I had never heard of, and that yet were all of them
true in fact • And it was so warm in my Imagination,
and so realized to me, that to the Hour I law them,
I could not be persuaded, but that it was or would be
true i also how I resented it, when the Spaniards com-
plain'd to me, and how I brought them. to Justice, try'd
them before me, and ordered them all three to be hang'd:
What there was really in this, stall be seen in its Place:
For however, I came to form such things in my Dream,
and what secret Converse of Spirits injected it, yet thpe
was, J fay, very much of it true. I own, that this Dream
had nothing in it literally and specifically true 5 but the ge-
neral Part was so true, the bale and villanous Behaviour
of these three harden'd Rogues was such, and had been so
much worse than all I can describe, that the Dream had
too much Similitude of the Fact, and as I would after-
them all, I had been much in the Right, and stould ha*
been justified both by the Laws of God and Man.
, B u t to return to my Story; in this kind of Temper
I had liv'd some Years, I had no Enjoyment of my Life,
no pleasant Hours, no agreeable Diversion, but what had
something or other of this in it,- so that my Wife,
who saw my mind so wholly bent upon it, told me very
 
A 4
seriously
seriously one Night, That she believ'd there was some fe-
ed powerful Impulse of Providence upon me, which had
determin'd me to go thither again; and that she found no-
thing hindered my going;, but my being engag'd to a Wife
said Children. She tofd me, that it was true, she could
not think of parting with me; but as she was assur'd, that
if lie was dead, it would be the fiist thing I would do:
So as it seem'd to her, that the thing was determin'd a-
bove, she would not be the only Obstruction: For if I
thought fit, and resolv'd to go Here she found me
very intent upon her Words, and that I look'd very ear-
nestly at her; so that it a little disorders her, and she
stopp'd. I ask'd her, Why she did not go on, and la/
out what she was going to fay? But I perceiv'd her Heart-
was too full, and some Tears stood in her Eyes 5 Speak out
my Dear, laid I, Are you willing I ihould go? No, says
foe, very mffettionately, I am far from willing: But if you
are resolv'd to go, lays ste, and rather than I will be the
only Hindi ance, I will go with you j for tho' I think it
a most preposterous thing for one of your Years, and in
your Condition, yet if it must be, said she again weeping,
I,won't leave you > for if it be of Heaven, you must jo
it, there is no relisting it y and if Heaven makes it your
Duty to go, he will allo make it mine to go with you,
or otherwise dispose of me, that I may not obstruct it.
This affectionate Behaviour of my Wife's bi ought me a
little out of the Vapours, and I began to consider what I
was a doing j I corrected my wandeiing Fancy, and began
to argue with my self sedately, what business I had alter
threescore Tears, and after Inch a Life of tedious Suffer-
ings and Disasters, and closed in so happy and easy a Man-
, ner, I say, what Business had I to rush into new Hazards,
and put my self upon Adventures, fit only for Youth and
. Poverty to run into,.
With those Thoughts, I considered my new Engage-
ment, that I had a Wife, one Child born, and my Wise
then great with Child of another j that J had all the World
eould give me, and had no need to leek Hazards for Gain j
that I was declining in Years, and ought to think rather
of leaving what I had gain'd, than of seeking to increase
it j. that as to what my Wife had said, of its being an Im-
pulse fiom Heaven, and that it should be my Duty to go,
I had
I had no Notion of that; so after many of these. Cogita-
tions, I struggled with the Power of my Imagination,
reasoned my ieif out of it, as J believe People may always
do in like Cafe, if they will; and, in a Word, I conquered
\t; compos'd my self with such Arguments as occur5d to
my Thoughts, and which my present Condition furninYd
me plentifully with, aud particularly, as die most effectual
Method, I reiblv'd to divert my self with other Things,
and to engage in some Business that might effectually tie
me up from any more Excursions of this Kind j for I
found the Thing, returned upon me chiefly when I was
idle, had nothing to do, or any tiling of Moment imme-
diately before me,
To this Purpose I bought a little Farm in the County
of Bedford, and refolv\] to remove my self thither, shad
a little convenient House upon it, and the Land about it I
found was capable of great Improvement, and that it was
many ways suited to my Inclination, which delighted in
Cultivating, Managing, Planting, and Improving of Land 5
and particularly, being an Inland Country, I was removed si am
conversing among Ship?, Sailors, and Things relating to
the remote Parts of the Woiki.
In a Word, I went down to my Farm, settled my Fa-
mily, bought me Ploughs, Harrcws, a Cart, Waggon,-Hor-
ses, Cows, Sheep j and letting-seriously to Work, became
in one half Year, a mecr Country Gentleman; my Thoughts-
were intirely taken up in managing my Servants, cultivat-
ing the Ground, Enclosing, Planting, and I liv'd, as I
thought, the most agreeable Lite that Nature was capable
of directing, or that a Man always bied to Misfoi tunes
was capable of being retieated to.
I farm'd upon my own Land, I had no Rent to par,
was limited by no Articles-; I could pull up or cut down
as I plcaicd: What I planted, was for my self, and what I
improved, was for my Family j and having thus left oif
the Thoughts of Wandering, I had not the least Discom-
fort in any pait of my Lite, as to this World. Now
I thought indeed, that I enjoy cl that Middle State of Life,
which my Father so earnestly recommended to me: A
kind of heavenly Life, something like what is defer sled by
the Poet upon the Subject of a Country Life.
A f Tree
Cro)
Tree from Vices, free from Care,
Age has no Pain, and Touth no Snare^
But in the Middle of all this Felicity, one Blow fron*
pnleen Providence unhing'd me at once; and not only made
a Breach upon me inevitable, and incurable; but drove me,
by its Consequence, upon a deep Relapse into the wander-
ing Disposition, which, as I may fay, being born in my
"Very Blood, soon recovers its Hold of me, and like the
Returns of a violent Distemper, came on with an irresi-
fcstible Force upon me > so that nothing could make any
more Impression upon me^ This Blow was the Loss of
my Wife-
I t is not my Business here to write an Elegy upon my
Wife, give a Character of her particular Virtues, and make
any Court to the Sex by the Flattery of a Funeral Ser-
jmon~ She wasy in a few Words, the Stay of all my Af-
fairs,, the Center of all my Enterprises j the Engine, that
fry her Prudence reduc'd me to that happy Compass I was
ih„ from the most extravagant and ruinous Project that
^hitter'd: in my Head, as above; and did more to guide my
rambling Genius, than a Mother's Tears, a Father's In-
structions, a Friend's Counsel, or all my own reasoning
Towers' could do. I was happy in listening to her Tears,
and in being moved by her Entreaties, and to the last degree
desolate and dislocated in the World by the Loss of her.
Whe:n she was gone, the Work! look'd aukwardly
round me1 was as much a Stranger in it, in my Thoughts,
as I was in the Brafils, when I went first on Shore there s
and as much alone, except as to the Assistance of Servants,
as I was in my Island. I knew neither what to do, or
what not to do. I saw the World busy round me, one
Part labouring for Bread, and the other squandering it, ir*
vile Excesses or empty Pleasures; equally miserable, be-
cause the End they propos'd still sled from them for the
Men of Pleasure every Day surfeited of their Vice, and
Heaped up Work for Sorrow and Repentance,; and the Men
of Labour spent their Strength in daily Smugglings for
Bread to maintain the* vital Strength they laboured with;
so living in a daily Circulation of Sorrow, living but to
woj k?. and working but to live, as if daily Bread were the
only
only End of wearisome Life, and a wearisome Life the on-
ly Occasion of daily Bread.
Ttns put me in mind of the Life I lived in my King-
dom, the Island $ where I soffer'd no more Corn to grow*
because I did not want it 5 and bred no more Goats, be-
cause I had no more Use for them: Where the Money
lay in the Drawer till it grew mill-dew'd, and had scarce
the Favour to be look'd upon in 20 Years.
All these Things, had I improv'd them as I ought to
have done, and as Reason and Religion had dictated to me,
would have taught me to search farther than human En-
joyments for a Rill Felicity, and that there was something
which certainly was the Reason and End of Life, superior
to all these Things, and which was either to be posiefs'd,
or at least hop'd for on tliis side the Grave,
But my sage Counsellor was gone ^ I was like a Ship
without a Pilot, that could only run apre the Wind,: My
Thoughts run all away again into the old Affair 5 my Head
was quite turn'd with the Whimsies of foreign Adventures,
and ail the pleasing innocent Amusements or my Farm, and
my Garden, my Cattle, and my Family, which before en~
tii ely poslest me, were nothing to me 5 had no Relish, and
were like Musick to one that has no Ear, or Food to one
that has no Taste: In a Word, Iresolv'd to leave off House- *
keeping, lett my Farm, and return to London and in a-
few Months after, I did so.
When I came to London-, I was still as uneasy as I was-
before; I had no Relish to the Place, no Employment irt
it, nothing to do but to saunter about like an idle Personr
of whom it may be said, he i* perfectly useless in God's
Creation, and it is not one Farthing matter to the rest of
his Kind, whether he be dead or alive. This also was
the Thing, which of all Circumstances of Life was the
most my Aversion, who had been all my Days used to an
active Life 5 and I would often fay to my self, A State
of Idleness is the 'very Dregs of Life > and indeed I thought
I was much more suitably employ'd, when I was 26
Days a making me a Deal Board.
It was now the Beginnidg of the Year 1693* when
my Nephew, who as J have observed before, I had brought
up to the Sea, and had made him Commander of a Ship,
was come -Home from a short Voyage to BiWoa, being
the
t I* j
the first he had made: He came to me, and told me, that
some Merchants of his Acquaintance had been proposing
to him, to go a Voyage for them to the East-Indies, and
to China, as private Traders: And now Uncle, fays he, if
you,-will go to, Sea with me, V11 engage to land you upon your
old Habitation in the Island, for we are to touch at the Brafiis.
Nothing can be a greater Demonstration of a fu-
ture State, and of the Existence of an invisible Woi Id, than
the Concurrence of second Causes, with the Ideas of
Tilings, which, we form in-our Minds, perfectly reserv'd,
and not communicated to any, in the Woild.
M y Nephew knew nothing how far my Distemper of
wandering was returned upon me, and I knew nothing of
what he had in his Thoughts to fay when that very
Morning before he came to me, I had in a great deal of
Con^uiion of Thought, and revolving every Part of my
Cb cumstances in my Mind, come tc* this Resolution, t/æ.
TMt I. would go to Lisbon, and consult with my old Sea-
Cap tain; and so if it was rational and pi acticable, I would
go aad ice the I/land again, and see what was become of my
People there: I had pleas'd my self also with the Thought s
of peopling.the Place, and carrying Inhabitants from hence,
getting a. Patent for the Posseifiorv, and I know not
* what} when in the Middle of all this, in comes my Ne-
jjjjpw^as I haye said, , with his Project of carrying me thi-
* ther, in his Way to the East-Indies.
I f aits-'d awhile at his Words, and looking steadily
at him, Pf-^at Devil, laid I, sent you of this unlucky Errand?
My Nephew staitl'd as if he had been flight eel at first;
but perceiving I was not much displeased with the Pro-
posal, he recover'd himself. I-hope it may not be an un-
lucky Proposal,. Sir, fays he, I dare say you would, be
pleaAi. to see- your new Colony there, where you once
reigned with more Felicity, than most of your Brother
Monarchs in the World,
In a Word, the Scheme hit fb exactly with my Tem-
per,, that] is. to fay, with the Prepossession I was under, and
of which I have laid so much, that I told him in few
Words, if he agi'red-with the Merchants, I would go with
him: But I told hint, I would not promise to go any far-
ther than my own Island: Why, Sir, lays he, you dout
if mt ta he id't there again, l.hopei. Why, said I, can you .not
takfte
C n )
not tako mt us again in your Return? He told me, it
could not be possible to do ib, that the Merchants would
never allow him to come that Way with a loaden Ship of
such Value, it being a Month's Sail out of his Way, and
might be. three or tour: Best ties, Sir, if I should miscarry,
said he, and not return at all, then you would he just re-
duced to the Condition you were in before.
This was very rational * but we both found out a Rer
medy for it, which was to carry, a tram ed Sloop on board
the Ship, which being taken in. Pieces, and fhipp'd on
board the Ship, might by the Help, of some Carpenters
who we agreed to carry . with us, be iet up again in the
Island, and siniiVd, sit to go to Sea in a few Days.
1 was not long resolving5 for indeed the Importunities
of my Nephew join'd in, so effectually with my Inclina-
tion, that nothing could oppose me: On the other hand,
my Wife being dead, I had no body that concein'd them-
selves ib much .for me, as jto persuade me one way or
other, except my ancient good Friend the Widow, who
earnestly struggled with me to consider my Years, my ea-
sy Circumstances, and .the needless Hazard of a long Voy-
age j and above all my young Children: But it was all to
no Purpose, I had an irresistible Desire to the Voyage-;
and I told her, I thought there was something ib uncom-
mon in the Impressions I had upon my Mind for the
Voyage, that it would be a kind of resisting Providence,
if I should attempt to stay at Home; after which,, she
ccas'd her Expostulations, and join'd with me,, not on-
. ly in making Piovision for my Voyage, but also in fet>
tling my Family Affairs for my Absence, and providing
for the Education of my Children.
I n Order to this, I raada my Will, and settled the E-
state I had, in such a Manner for my Children, and pla-
ced in such Hands, that I was peifcctly easy and fcrisfy'd
they would have justice done them, whatever might be-
ta! me and for their Education, I kit it wholly to my
Widow, with a sufficient Maintenance to her self for her
Care: All wjiich ire richly defer v'dj for no Mother could
have taken more Care in their Education, or understood
it better; and as ffc liv'd ull I came Home, I alib liv'd
to thank her for it.
My Nephew was ready to fail about the Beginning of
January
C*4)
J armory 1694-5% and I with my Man Friday went on
board in the Downs the 2th, having besides that Sloop
which I mentions above, a very considerable Cargo off
all Kinds of neceslary Things for my Colony, which if I
did not find in good Condition I resolv'd to leave so.
First, I carried with me some Servants, who I purpos'd
to place there, as Inhabitants, or at least to set on Work
there upon my own Account while I stay'd, and either
to leave them there, or carry them forward as they should ap-
pear willing j particularly, I carry'd two Carpenters, a Smiths
and a very handy ingenious Fellow, who was a Cooper
by trade, but was also a general Mechanics for he was
dextrous at making Wheels, and Hand-Mills to grind
Corn, was a good Turner, and a good Pot-Maker 3 he
also made any Thing that was proper to make of Earth,
or of Wood j in a Word, we call'd him Our Jack of all
Trades.
With these I carry'd a Taylor, who had offer'd himself
to go Passenger to the East-Indies with my Nephew, but
afterwards consented to stay on our New Plantation, and
prov'd a most necessary handy Fellow, as could be desir'd,
in many other Businesses, besides that of this Trade j for as
I observ'd formerly, Necessity arms us for all Employments.
M y Cargo, as near as I can collect, for I have not kept
an Account of Particulars, consisted of a sufficient Quan-
tity of Linnen, and some thin JEngUJJy Stuffs for cloating
the Spaniards that I expected to find there 5 and enough of
them, as by my Calculation might comfortably supply
them for,seven Years > if I remember right, the Materi-
als which I carry'd for cloathing them, with Gloves,
Hats, Shoes, Stockings, and all suen Things as they could
want for wearing, amounted to above 2.00 Pounds, in-
cluding some Beds, Bedding, and Houfnold - Stuff, par-
ticularly Kitchen-Utensils, with Pots, Kettles, Peuter,
Brass, &c. besides, near a hundred Pounds more in Iron-
Work, Nails, Tools of every Kind, Staples, Hooks Hinges,
and every neceslary Thing I could think of.
I caery'd also an hundred spare Arms, Muskets and Fu-
sees, besides some Pistols, a considerable Quantity of Shot
of all $izes5 three or four Ton of Lead, and two Pieces
of Biass Cannon; and because I knew not what Time,
and what Ext emtties I was providing for, I carry'd an
hunched
(15)
hundred Barrels of Powder, besides Swords, and CutlaflesV
and the Iron Part of some Pikes, and Halberts, so that ia
short, we had a large Magazine of all Sorts of Stores; and
I made my Nephew carry two small Quarter-Deck Guns
more than he wanted for his Ship, to leave behind, if
there was Occasion j that when we came there, we might
build a Fort, and man it against all Sorts of Enemies: And
indeed, I at first thought there would be Need enough for
it all, and much more, if we hop'd to maintain our Pos-
session of the Island, as shall be seen in the Course of the
Story.
I had not sich bad Luck in this Voyage, as I had been
used to meet with ; and therefore shall have the less Occa-
sion to interrupt the Reader, who prehaps may be impai-
ent to hear how Matters went with my Colony 5 yet
some odd Accidents r cross Winds, and bad Weather hap-
pen'd, on this first setting out, which made the Voyage
Jonger than I expected it at first j and I who had never
made but one Voyage, (viz.) my first Voyag* to Guinea, in
which I might be said to come back again, as the Voyage
was at first design'd, began to think the fame ill Fate still
attended me j and that I was born to be never contented
with my own Shore, and yet to be always unfortunate
at Sea.
Contrary Winds first put us to the Northward, and we
were oblig'd to put in at Galway in Ireland^ where we lay
Win<i-bound two and twenty Days; but we had this Sa?
tisfaction with the Disaster, that Provisions were here ex-
ceeding cheap, and in the utmost Plenty; so that whrle
we lay here, we never touchM the Ship's Stores, but
rather added to them> here also I took several live Hogs,
and two Cows with their Calves, which I resolv'd, if I
had a good Pailage, to put on Shore in my Island, but we
found Occasion to dispose otherwise of them.
W e set out the fth of February from Ireland and had
a very fair Gale of Wind for some Days; as I remember,
it might be about the loth of February in the Evening
late, when the Mate having the Watch, came into the
Round-house, and told us, he saw a Flash of Fire, and
heard a Gun fiYd, and while he was telling us of it, a Boy
came in, and told us the Boatswain heard another. This
made us all run out upon the Quarter-Deck* where for a
while
while we heard nothing, but in a sew Minutes we fiw a
very great Light, and found that there was some very ter-
rible Fire at a Distance 5 immediately we had recourse to
our Reckonings, in which we all agreed, that there could
be no Land that Way, in which the Fire ihew'd it self,
no not for 5*00 Leagues, for it appear'd at W. VN. W.
Upon this we concluded, it must be some Ship on Fire at
Sea j and as by our hearing the Noise of Guns just before,
we concluded it could not be far off: We stood directly
towards it, and were presently fatisfy'd we should discover
it, because the farther we iail'd, the greater the Light ap-
pears, tho' the Weather being haizy, we could not per-
ceive any Thing but the Light for a while: In about half
an Horn's Sailing, the Wind being fair for us, tho'not much
of it.and'the Weather clearing up a little, we could plainly dis-
cern that it was a great Ship on fire in the Middle of the Sea.
I was most sensibly touch'd with this Disaster tho' not
at all acquainted with the Personsengag'd in it; I present-
ly recollected my formed Circumstances, in what Condi-
tion I was in, when taken up by the Portugal Captain \
and how much more deplorable the Circumstances of the-
poor Creatures belonging to this Ship must be, if they
had no other Ship in Company with them: Upon this,
I immediatly order'd, that five Guns should be hVd, one
soon after another, that, if possible, we might give No-
tice to them, that there was Help for them at hand, and
that they might endeavour to lave themselves in their
Boat 3 for tho' we could see the Flame of the Ship, yet
they, it being Night, could see nothing of us.
W e lay by some Time upon this, only diiving as the
-burning Ship drove, wniting for Day-light; when on a
sudden, to our great Terror, though we had Reason to
expect it, the Ship blew up in the Air; and immediatly,
that is to fay, in a few Minutes, all the Fire was out, •
that is to fay, the rest of the Ship funk: This was
a Terrible, and indeed an afflicting Sight, for the Sake of
the poor Men, who, I concluded, must be either all de-
stroys in the Ship, or be in the utmost Disticfs in their
Boats in the Middle of the Ocean, which at present, by
Reason it was dark, I could not sec; However, to dii'ecfc
them as well as I cculd, I caused Lights to be hung out
in all the Parts of the Ship whee we. could, and which
we
( *7 )
we had Lantiiorns for, and kept firing Guns all the Night
long, letting them know by this, tliat there was a Ship
not far off.
About S a-Clock in the Morning we di&roverM the
Ship's Boats, by the Help of our Perspective Glasses, found
there were two of them, both throng'd with People, and
deep in the Water: We peceived they row'd, the Wind
being against them, that they law our Ship, and did the
utmost to make us lee them.
W e immediately spread cur Ancient, to let them know
we:saw them, and hung a Waft out as a Signal for them
to come on Board, and then made more Sail, standing di-
rectly to them. In little more than half an Hour we
came irp with them, and in a word, took them all in,
being no less than iixty. four Men, Women, and Children >
ior there were a great many Pastengers.
Upon the whole, We found it was a French Mer-
chant Ship of 300 Tun, homeward bound from ^uebeck^
in the River of Canada, The Master gave us a long Ac-
count of the Distress of his Ship, how the Fire began in
the Steerage, T>y the Negligence of the Steersman j. but on
his crying out for Help, was, as every Body thought,
entirely put out : But they soon found, that some Sparks
of the first Fire had gotten into some Part of the Ship,
so difficult to come at, that they could not effectually
quench ir ; and afterwards getting in between the Tim-
bers, and within the Ceiling of the Ship, it proceeded into
•the Hold, and jfcaster'd all the Skill, and all the Application
. they were able to exert, >
They had no more to do then, but to get into- their
Boats, which to their great Comfort were pretty fo'ge>
- being their Long-Boat, and a great Shalfoup, besides a
small Skiss which was of no great Service, to them* other
than to get !bme fresh Water and Provisions into h&\
after they had fecuVd there Lives from the F&e. They
had indeed small Hope of their Lives by getting into thele
Boats at that Distance from any Land, only, as they laid
• well, that they were escap'd from .the Fire, and had a Po£
, libility that ibme Ship might happen to be at Sea, and
- might take them in, -.They had Sails, ;Oars, and a Com-
; pate and were prepajing; tojnaafce the best of tbm.M^r:
back to Nmfo^rl^,:the.Wmd blowing pretty star, rory
it blew an easy Gale at S. E. by E. They had as much
Provisions and Water, as with sparing it so as to be next
door to starving, might support them about 12 Days 3 in
Which, if they had no bad Weather, and no contrary
Winds, the Captain said, he hop'd he might get the Banks
of Newfound-land, and might perhaps take some Fish to
sustain them till they might go on Shore. But there were
so many Chances against them in all these Cases; such as
Storms to overset and founder them > Rains and Cold to be-
numb and perisli their Limbs 5 contrary Winds to keep
them out and starve them j that it must have been next
to miraculous, if they had escaped.
In the midst of their Consultations, every one being
hopeless, and ready to despair, the Captain with Tears in
his Eyes told me, they were on a sudden furpriz/d with
the Joy of hearing a Gun fire, and after that four more >
these were the five Guns, which I caused to be sired at
first feeing the Light : this revived their Hearts, and gave
them the Notice, which, as above, I desiVd it sliould,
{viz,.) that there was a Ship at hand for their Help.
I t was upon the hearing these Guns, that they took
down their Masts and Sails j and the Sound coming from the
Windward, they resolv'd to lie by till Morning. Some
Time after tins, hearing no more Guns, they hrd three
Muskets, one a considerable while after another > but
these, the Wind being contrary, we never heard.
Some Time after that again, they were still more
Agreeably siirpriz'd with feeing our Lights, and hearing
the Guns, which as I have said, I caus'd to be nVd all
the rest of the Night5 this set them to work with their
Oars to keep their Boats a-hcad, at least, (that we might
the sooner come up with them j and at last, to their in-
expressible Joy, they found we saw them.
I t is impossible for me to express the several Gestures,
the strange Extasies, the Variety of Postures which these
poor delivered People run into, to express the Joy of their
Souls at so unexpected a Deliverance $ Grief and Fear are
easily described 5 Sighs, Tears, Groans, and a very few
Motions of Head and Hands make up the Sum of its
Variety: But an Excess of Joy, a Surprize of Joy has a
Thousand Extravagances in it; there were some m Tears ->
^ some raging and tearing themselves, as if they had been
in the greatest Agonies of Sorrow some stark-raving and
down-right Lunatick; some ran about the Ship stamping
with their Feet, others wringing their Hands 5 some were
dancing, some singing, some laughing, more crying; many
quite dumb, not able to speak a Word j others sick and
vomiting 5 several swooning, and ready to faint; and a
sew, were Crossing themselves, and giving God Thanks.
I would not wrong them neither 3 there might be
many that were thankful afterward, but the Passion was
too strong for them at first, and they were not able to
master it, they were thrown into Ex tastes and a kind of
Frenzy, and so there we e but a very few who were com-
pos'd and serious in their Joy.
Perhaps also the Caie may have some Addition to it,
from the particular Circumstance of the Nation they be-
longed to, I mean the Trench; whole Temper is allow'd
to be more volatile, more passionate, and more sprightly,
and their Spirits more fluid than in other Nations. I am
not Philosopher enough to determine the Cause, but no-
thing I had ever seen "before came up to it: The Extasies
poor Friday, my trusty Savage, was in when he found his
Father in the Beat, came the nearest to it, and the Sur-
prize of the Master and his two Companions, who I de-
livered fiom the Villains that set them on Shore in the
Island, came a little Way towards it, but nothing was to;
compare to this, either that I law in Friday, or anywhere
elle in my Life.
I t is farther oblervable, 3hat these Extravagancies did
not stew themselves in that different Manner I have men-
tions, in different Persons only: But all the Variety
would appear in a short Succession of Moments, in one
and the sime Person. A Man that we saw this Minute
dumb, and as it were stupid and confounded, should the
next Minute be dancing and hallowing like an Antick j
and the next Moment be tearing his Hair, op pulling his
Clothes to Pieces, and stamping? them under his Feet, like
a Madman; a few Moments after that, we should have
him all in Tears, then sick, then swooning; and had not
immediate Help been had, would, in a few Moments
more., have been dead j and thus it was not with one or
two, or ten or twenty, but with the greatest Part of
them*
(ao)
them 5 and if I remember right, our Surgeon was oblig'd
to let above thirty of them blood,
• Ther e were two Priests among them, one an old
Man, and the other a young Man-, and that which was
strangest was, that the oldest Man was the worst.
A s soon as he set his Foot on board our Ship, and saw
himself Me, he dropt down stone-dead, to all Appearance,
not the least Sign ot Life could be perceiv'd in him j our
Surgeon immediately apply'd proper Remedies to recover
him, and was the only Man in the Ship that believ'd he
was not dead j at length he open'd a Vrin in his Ann,
having first chaPd and rubb'd the Part so as to warm it
as much as possible: Upon this the Blood, which only
dropp'd at first, fiow'd something freely; in three Minutes
after, the Man open'd his Eyes, and about a quarter of an
Hour after that he spoke, grew better, and in a little
time quite well j- after the Blood was stopp'd he walk'd
about, told us lie was perfectly well, took a Dram of
Cordial which the Surgeon gave him, and was what we
call'd, Come to himself > about a quarter of an Hour after
this, they came running into the Cabin to the Su geen,
who was bleeding a French Woman, that had fainted j and
told him, the Priest was gone stark-mad 5 it teems he had
begun to revolve the Change of his Circumstance in his
Mind, and this put him into an Extaiy of Joy, his Spi-
rits whirsd about faster than the Vessels could convey
them, j the Blood grew hot and feverish, and the Man was as
fit for Bedlam, as any Oeature that ever was in it: The
Surgeon would not bleed him again in that Condition, but
give him something to dose and put him to sleep, which
after some Time operated upon him, and he wak'd next
Morning perfectly composes, and well.
The younger Priest behav'd himself with great Command
of his Passion, and was really an Example of a serious
well-govern'd Mind; at his first coming on board the Ship,
he threw himiclf slat on his Face, prostrating himself in
Thankfulness for his Deliverancej in which I unhappily
and unseasonably disturbs] him, really thinking he had been
in.a Swoons but he spake calmly, thank'd me j told me,
he was giving God Thanks for his Diliveraricc; begs^d
.me to leave him a few Moments, and that* next to liis
Maker, he would give me Thanks also.
I WAS
I was heartily sorry, that I disturbs him, and not only-
left him, but kept otfiers from interrupting him also; he
continued in that Posture about three Minutes, or a little
more, after I left him, then came to me, as he had said
he would, and with a great deal of Seriousness and Affec-
tion, but with Tears in his Eyes thankJd me that had, un-
der God, given him and so many miserable Creatures their
Lives: I told him, I had no Room to move him to thank
God for it, rather than me: For I had seen that he had
done that al read}': But I added, That it was nothing but
what Reason and Humanity dictated to all Men, and that
we had as much Reason as he to give Thanks to God, who
had bless'd us ib far as to make us the Instruments of his
Mercy to so many of his Creatures.
After this, the young-Priest apply'd himself to his
Country-Folks, laboured to compose them 5 persuaded, en-
treated, argued, reason'd, with them, and did his utmost to
keep them within the Exercise of their Reason; and with
some he had Success, tho* others were for a Time out of
all Government of themselves.
I cannot help committing this to Writting, as per-
haps it may be useful to those into whose Hands it may
fail, in the guiding themselves in all the Extravagances of
their Passions 5 for if an Excess of Joy can carry Men out
to such a Length beyond the Reach of their Reason, * what
will not the Extravagances of Anger, Rage, and a provok'd
Mind carry us to? and indeed here I law Reason for keeping *
an exceeding Watch over our Pafiipns of every Kind, as
well tlipse of Joy and Satisfaction, as those of Sorrow and
Anger.
We were something disorders by these Extravagances
among our new Guests for the first Day; but when they
had been retired, Lodgings provided for them as well as our
Ship would allow, and they had slept heai tily, as most of
them did, being fatigu'd and frighted, they were quite
another Sort of People the next Day.
Nothing of good Manners or civil Acknowledgments
for the Kindness shewn them was wanting; the French,
'tis known, are naturally apt enough to exceed that Way:
The Captain and one of the Priests came to me the next
Day, and desiring to speak with me and my Nephew, the
Commander, began to consult with us what should be
done
done with them; and first they told us, that as we ha'd
saved their Lives, so all they had was little enongh for a
Return to us for the Kindness received. The Captain said,
they had saved some Money and some Things os' Value in
their Boats, catch'd hastily out of the Flames, and if we
would accept it, they were ordered to make an Offer of it
our Way, where if possible they might get Pasiage to Trance.
My Nephew was foT accepting their Money at first
Word, and to consider what to do with them afterwards;
but I over-rul'd him in that Part, for I knew what it was
to be set on Shore in a strange Country; and if the Por-
tugal Captain, that took me up at Sea had serv'd me so,
and took all I had for my Deliverance, I must have starv'd,
or have been as much a Slave at the Brasihy as I had been
in Barhary> the being fold to a Mahometan only excepted j
and perhaps a Portuguese is not much a better Master than a
Turk, if not in some Cafes a much worse.
Itherefore told the French Captain that we had ta-
ken them up in their Distress, it was true j but that it was
our Duty to do so, as we were Fellow-Creatures, and as
we would desire to be so delivered if we were in the like
or any other Extremity; that we had done nothing for
them but what we believed they would have done for us,
if we had been in their Case, and they in ours j but that
we took them up to save them, not to plunder them j and it
would be a most barbarous Thing to take that little from
them which they had saved out of the Fire, and then set
them on Shore and leave them; that this would be first to
save them from Death, and then kill them ourselves; save
them from drowning, and abandon them to starving; and
therefore I would not let the least Thing be taken from
them: As to setting them on Shore, I told them indeed,
that was an exceeding Difficulty to us, for that the Ship
was bound to the Eaft-Indies; and tho' we were driven out
of our Course to the Westward a very great Way, which
perhaps was directed by Heaven on purpose for their De-
liverance, yet it was impossible for us wilfully to change
our Voyage on this particular .Account; nor could my Ne-
phew, the Captain, answer it to the Freighters, with whom
he was under Charter-Party to pur siie his Voyage by the Way
of Brafil, and all I knew we could do for them, was to
 
Shore somewhere in
put
put our selves in the Way of meeting with other ShipS
homeward bound from tne West-Indies, and get them Pas-
sage, if possible, to England or Trance.
The first Part of the Proposal was so generous and kind,
they could not but be very thankful for it j but they were
in a very great Consternation, especially the Pastengers, at
the Notion of being carry*d away to the East-Indies-, they
then in treated me, that feeing I was driven so far to the
Westward, before I met with them, I would at least keep
on the fame Course to the Banks of Newfound - Land,
where it was probable I might meet with some Ship or
Sloop that they might hire to carry them back to Cana'
da, from whence they came.
I thought this was but a reasonable Request on their
Part* and therefore I inclin'd to agree to it j for indeed I
considers, tliat to carry this whole Company to the East-
Indiesy would not only be an intolerable Severity to the
poor People, but would be ruining our whole Voyage by
devouring all our Provisions > so I thought it no Breach of
Charter-Party, but what an unforeseen Accident made ab-
solutely neceslary to us, and in which no one could fay we
were to blame; for the Laws of God and Nature would
have forbid, that we should refuse to take up two Boats
full of People in soch a distress^ Condition, and the Nature
of the Thing as well respecting our selves as the poor Peo-
ple, obliged us to set them on Shore some where or other,
for their Deliverance; ib I consented that we would carry
them to Newfound-Land, if Wind and Weather would per-
mit, and if not, that I would carfy them to Martinico in
the West-Indies.
The Wind continued fresh Easterly, but the Weather pret-
ty good, and as it had blowed continually in die Points be-
tween N. E. and S.E. a long time, we misted several Op-
portunities of sending them to France j for we met several
Ships bound to Europe, whereof two were French from St.
Christopher's, but they had been so long beating up against
the Wind, that they durst take in no Pastengers for fear of
wanting Provisions for the Voyage, as well for themselves
as for those they should take in j so we were oblig'd to go
on. It was about a Week after this that we made tie
Banks of Newfound-Land, where, to shorten my Story, we
J>ut ail our French People on board a Bark, which they
hir'd at Sea there, to put them on Shore, and afterwards 
to carry them to France, if they could get Provision to.
victual themselves with: When, I fay, French wenton
Shore, I -should remember that the young Priest I spoke of,
hearing we were bound to the Easi-Indies, deiir'd to go the
Voyage with us, and to be set on Shore on the Coast ofCo-
romandel: I readily agreed to that, for I wonderfully lik'd
the Man, and had very good Reason, as will appeal after-
wards j allb four of the Seamen en ter'd themselves on our
Ship, and prov'd very useful Fellows.
Fro m hence we directed our Course for the West-Indies,
steeriagaway S.and S.by E. for about 20 Days together,some-
times little or no Wind at all, when we met with another
Subject for our Humanity to work pon, almost as deplo-
rable as that before.
It was in the Latitude of 27 Degrees f Minutes N.
and the 19th Day of March 16^ ^-5*, when we Tpy'd a
Sail, our Course S. E. and by S. We soon perceiv'd it was
a large Vellel, and that she bore up to us, but could not at first
know what to make of her, till after coming a little nearer,
we found she had lost her Main Top-mast, Fore-mast and Bolt-
iprit, and presently she fires a Gun as a Signal of Distress j
the Weather was pretty good, Wind at N. N. W. a fresh-
Gale, and we soon came to speak with her.
W e found her a Ship of Bristol, bound home from Bar-
badoesy but had been blown out of the Road at Barbadoes
a tew Days before she was ready to fail, by a terrible Hur-
ricane, while the Captain and Chief-Mate were both gone'
on Shore; so that, belide the Terror of the Storm, they
were but in an indifferent Cafe for good Artists to bring;
the Ship home: They had been already nine Weeks at Sea,
and had met with another terrible Srorm after the Hun>;
cane was over, which had blown them quite out of their;
Knowledge to the Westward, and in which they lost their
Masts, as above; they told us they expected to have seen,
the Bahama I stands, but were then driven away again •
to the South-East, by a strong Gale of Wind at N, N.;
the fame that blew now, and having no Sails to work the \
Ship with, but a Main-Course, and a kind of square- .Sail 1
upon a Jury-Forc-Mast, which they had set up, they cquW j
not lie near the Wind, but were endeavouring to stand 4- \ ^
way for the Canaries. ''
J But
But that which was worst of all, was, that they were
almost starv'd for want of Provisions, besides the Fatigues
they had undergone; their .Bread and Flefli was quite gone,
they had not one Ounce left in the Ship, and had had none tor
11 Days 5 the only Relief they had, was, their Water was
not all spent, and they had about half a Barrel of Flower
lefti they had Sugar enoughs some Succades or Sweet-
Meats they had at first, but they were devour'd, and they
had seven Casks of Rum.
There was a Youth and his Mother and a Maid-Ser-
vant on board, who were going Passengers, and thinking
the Ship was ready to fail, unhappily came on board the E-
vening before the Hurricane began, and having no Provisions
of their own Ieft,they v,-?rein a moredepIorablcCondition than
the rest; for the Seamen, being redued to such an extreme
Necessity themselves, had no Compassion, we may be sure,
for the poor Passengers it id they *were indeed in a Condi-
. tion that their Misery is very hard to describe.
I ha d, perhaps, not known this Part, if my Curiosity had
not led me, the Weather being fair and the Wiod abated, to
go onboard the Ship: The Second Mate who upon this Oc-
casion commanded the Ship, had been on board our Ship*
and he told me indeed, that they had three Passengers in
the great Cabin, that they were in a deplorable Condition;
nay, fays he, I believe they are dead, for I have heard no-
thing of them for above two Days* and I was afraid to en-
quire after them, laid he, for I had nothing to relieve them
with.
W e immediately apply'd our selves to give them what
Relief he could spare j and indeed I had io far over-ruled
Things with my Nephew, that I would have victualed
them, tho* we had gone away to Vh-gmta, or any Pa» t of
the Coast of America, to have mpply'd our selves 5 but there
was no Necessity for that.
B u now they were in a ,new Danger -y for they were
# afraid of eating too much, even of that little we gave them;
the Mate or Commander brought six Men with him in his
Boat, but these jX)or Wretches look'd like Skeletons, and
were so weak, they could hardly sit to their Oars; The
Mate himself was very ill, and half starved * for he de-
clared he had reserv'd nothing from the Men3 and went
B Shai e
•Share and Share alike with them, in every Bit they
eat.
I caution'd him to eat sparingly, but set Meat be-
fore him immediately, and he had not eaten three Mouth-
fuls before he began to be sick, and out of order 5 so he
stopt a while, and our Surgeon mix'd him up something
with some Broath, which he said would be to him both
Food and Phyiick 3 and after he had taken it he grew bet-
ter: In the mean Time, I forgot not the Men; I order'd
Victuals to be given them, and the poor Creatures rather
devour'd than eat it 3 they were Ib-exceeding hungry, that
they were in a kind ravenous, and had no Command of
themselves $ and two of them eat with so much Greedi-
ness, that they were in Danger of their Lives the next
Morning.
The Sight of these People's Distress was very moving
to me, and brought to mind what I had a terrible Prospect
of at my first coming on Shore in my Island, where I had
not the least Mouthful of Food, or any Prospect of pro-
curing any 3 besides the hourly Apprehension I had of being
made the Food of other Creatures: But all the while the
Mate was thus relating to me the miserable Condition of
the Ship's Company, I could not put out of my Thought
the Story he had told me of the three poor Creatures in
the great Cabin, ('viz..) the Mother, her Son, and the Maid-
servant, who he had heard nothing of for two or three
Days j and who he seem'd to confess they had wholly neg-
lected, their own Extremities being so great; by which I
understood, that they had really given them no Food at all,
and that therefore they must be per ifVd, and be all lying
dead perhaps on the Floor, or Deck of the Cabin.
A s I therefore kept the Mate, who we then culled Cap-
tain, on board with his Men to refiesh them, ib I also for-
cpt not the starving Crew that were left on board, but or-
der'd my own Boat to go on.board the Ship, and with my
Mate and twelve Men to carry them a Sack of Bread, and
four or five Pieces of Beef to boil. Our Surgeon charg e!
the Men to cause the Meat to be boil*d while they stayed, and
to keep Gaurd in the Cook-Room, to prevent the Men
taking it to eat raw, or taking it out of the Pot before it
was weil-boird, and then to give every Man but a little at
a time > and by this Caution he prescrv'd the Men, who
would
would otherwise ha' kill'd themseves, with that very Food'
that was given them on Purpose to save their Lives.
A t the lame Time, I ordered the Mate to go into the
great Cabin, and see what Condition the poor Passengers
were in, and if they were alive, to comfort them, and give
them what Refreshment was proper; and the Surgeon gave
him a large Pitcher with some of the prepared Broth which
he had given the Mate that was on Board, and which he
did not question would restore them gradually.
I was not satisfied with this, but, as I said above, hav-
ing a great Mind to see the Scene of Misery, which I knew
the Snip it self would present me with, in a more lively
Manner than I could have it by Report, I took the Captain
of the Ship, as we nowcall'd him, with me, and went my
iidf a little after in their Boat.
Ifound the poor Men on board almost in a Tumult
to get the Victuals out of the Boiler before it was ready:
But my Mate observ'd his Order, and kept a good Guard at
the Cook-Room Door, and the Man he plac d there, after
using ail possible Persuasion to have Patience, kept them o£f
by Force: However, he caused some Bisket Cakes to be
dipp'd in the Pot, and soften'd them with the Liquor of the
Meat, which they call Brewes, and gave them every one
One, to stay their Stomachs, and told them it was for their
own Safety that he was oblig'd to give them but a little at
a time: But it was all in vain, and had I not comeon board,
and their own Commander and Officers with me, and with
good Words, and some Threats also of giving them no more,
I believe they would have broke into the Cook-Room by
Force, and tore the Meat out of the Furnace: For Words
are indeed of very small Force to a hungry Belly: However
we pacify d them, and fed them gradually and cautiously for
the first Time, and the next Time gave them more, and at
last fill'd their Bellies, and the Men did well enough.
But the Misery of the poor Passengers in the Cabin .was
of another Nature, and far beyond the rest,- for assirjh the
Ship's Company had so little for themselves, it was but too
true that they had at first kept them very low, and at last
totally neglected them, so that for six or seven Days, ic
might be said, they had really had no Food at all, and for
several Days before, very little. The poor Mother, who, as
the, first Mate reported, was a Woman of good Scn.ee and
B, 2, good
C>8)
good Breeding, had spar'd all she could get'so affectionately
for her Son, that at last she entirely sunk under it : And
when the Mate of Ship went'in, (lie sat upon the Floor cr
Deck, with her Back up against the Sides, between two
Chairs, which were lafh'd fast, and-her Head funk in be-
tween her Shoulders, like a Corpse, tho' not quite dead.
My Mate said all he could to revive and encourage her, and
with a Spoon put some Broth into her Mouth; she. open-
ed her Lips, and lifted up one Hand, but could not speak;
yet si e udnevstood what he jSJd, and made Signs to him,
intimating, that it was too late for her, but pointed to her
Child, as if she would have said, they should take Care of
him.
However the Mate, who was exceedingly mov'd
with the Sight, endeavour'd to get some of the Broth in-
'to her Mouth ; and, as he said, got two or three Spoonfuls
€0\vn, tho' I question whether he could be fine of it or
not: But it was too late, and she dy'd the same Night,
The Youth, who was prcferv'd at the Price of his most
astectionate Mother's Life, was not so far gone, yet he lay
in a Cabin-bed as one stretch'd out, with hardly any Life
left in him, he had a Piece of an old Glove in his Mouth,
having eaten up the rest of it; however, being young, and
having more Strength than his Mother, the Mate got some-
thing down his Throat, and he began sensibly to revive,
though by giving him some time after but two or three
Spoonfuls extraordinary, he was very lick, and brought it
up again.
But the next Care was the poor Maid, fie lay all along
upon the Deck, hard by her Mistress, and just like one that
bad fallen down with an Apoplexy, and struggled for Life:
Her Limbs were distorted, one of her Hands was clasp d
round the Frame of the Chair, and she grip'd it so haid,
that we could not easily make her let gp; her other Arm
hy over her Head, and her Feet lay both together, set fast
against the Frame of the Cabin-table j in fhovt, ste lay just
like one in the last Agonies of Death, and yet {he was
alive toe.
The poor Creature was not only starv'd with Hunger,
and terrify d with the Thoughts of Death, but, as the Men
toid ns afterwards, was bioken-heaited for her Mistress,
who
who she saw dying two of three Days before, and who flit
• lGV'd"most tenderly.
\V e knew not what to do with this poor Girl, for
when our Suigeon, who was a Man of ver-y great Know-
ledge and Experience, had with great Application recover'd
her, as to Life; he had her upon"his Hand as to her Senses,
for she was, little less than distracted for a confides able Time
Writer, as shall appear presently.
W hoever si all read these Memorandums must be de-
siVd to 'consider, that Visits at Sea are not like a Journey
• into the. Country, where sometimes People stay a Week or
a Fortnight ar a Place. Ou~ Business was to relieve this
distressed Ship's Crew, but not lie by for them > and thoJ
they were willing to fleer the fame Course with us for
some Days, yet we could carry no Sail to keep Pace with
a Ship that had no Masts j however, as their Captain beg-
fd of us to help him to let up a Main-Top-Mast, and "a
ind of Top-Mast to his Juj y-Fore-Mast. We did, as it.
were lie by him for three or four Days, and then having
given him five Barrels of Beef, a Barrel of Pork, two Hog-
H eads of Bisket, and a Porponion of Peas, Flowr, and what
other Things we could ipa-ej and taking three Cask's of
Sugar, some Rum, and some Pieces of Eight of them for
Satisfaction, we left them, taking on board-with us, at their
own earnest Request, the Youth, and the Maid, and all their
Goods.
The young Lad was about seventeen Years of Age, a
pretty, well-bred, modest, and sensible Youth 5 greatly de-
jected with the Loss of his Mother, and, as it ieems, had
lost his Father but a few Months before at Barbatloes, He
beggd of the Surgeon to speak to me, to take him out of
the Ship, for he laid the cruel Fellows had murther'd his
Mother; and indeed so they hid, that is to fay f.iiji ic'.y; for
they might ha' spar'd a small Sustenance to the poor help-
less Widow, that might have prefer v'd her Life, tho irhad
9 been but just to keep her alive. But Hunger knows no
Friend, no Relation, no Justice, no Right, and theierbrcis
remorseless, and capable of no Compassion,
The Surgeon told him how far we were going, and
how it would car ry him away from all his Friends, and put
him perhaps in as bad Circumstances almost as we found
them in 5 that is to fay, starving in the World. He said hi
B 3 rnar-
frtartertl not whether he went, if he was but deliver'd from
the terrible Crew, that he was among: That the Captain
(by which he meant me, for he could know nothing of
my Nephew) had iav'd his Life, and he was sure would
iiot hurt him j and as for the Maid, he was fin e if she
came to her self, she would he very thankful for it, let
us cany them where we would. The Surgeon represent-
-ed the Case so affectionately to me, that I yielded, and we
took them both on board with all their Goods, except eleven
Hogsheads of Sugar, which could not be removed or come
ar, and as the Youth had a Bill of Ladirg for them, I
made his Commander sign a "Writing, obliging himself to
go as soon as he came to Bristol, to one Mr. Rogers a Mer-
chant there, to whom the Youth said he was related, and
to deliver a Letter which I wrote to him, and all the
Goods he had belonging to the deceased Widow; which I
suppose was not done, for I could never learn that the Ship
came to Bristol^ but was, as is most probable, lost at Sea,
feeing in so disabled a Condition, and so far from any Land,
that lam of Opinion, the first Storm she met with after-
wards, she might founder in the Sea, for she was leaky,
and had Damage in her Hold when we met with her.
I w«A s now in the Latitude of 19 Dcg. 32 Min. and
had hitherto had a tolerable Voyage as to Weather, though
at first the Winds had been contrary. I shall trouble no
body with the little Incidents of Wind, Weather, Currents,
&e. on the rest of our Voyage,- but (hortning my Story
for the fake of what is to follow, shall observe that I came
to my old Habitation, the Island, on 10th of April, 1695-.
It was with no small Difficulty that I found the Place;
for as I came to it, and went from it before, on the South
now coming in between the Main and the I stand, and hav-
ing no Chart for the Coast, nor any Land-Mark, I did
not know it when I law it, or know whether I saw it
or no.
W e beat about a great while, and went on Shore on se-
veral Islands in the Mouth of the great River Qronooque,
but none for my Purpose. Only this I learn'd by my
Coasting the Shore, that I was under one great Mistake be-
fore, viz. that the Continent which I thought I saw, from
Vfce Island I livd in, was really no Continent, but a long
and East Side of the Island,
 
Island,
I/land, or rather a Ridge of Islands, reaching from one to
the other Side of the extended Mouth of that great River,
and that the Savages who came to my Island, were not
properly those which we call Caribbees, but Islanders and
other Barbarians'of the fame Kind, who inhabited some-
thing nearer to our Side than the rest.
I n short, I visited several of these Islands to no Purpose j
some 1 found were inhabited, and seme were not. On one
or them I found some S{awards, and thought they hadLVd
there, but speaking with them, found they had a Sloop lay
in a small Creek hard by, and they came thither to make
Salt, and to catch some Pearl Muscles if they could, but
that they bclcng'd to the Isle dt Trinidad, which lay farther
North, in the Latitude of i o and 11 Degrees.
Thus coasting from one Island to another, sometimes
with the Ship, sometimes with the French Man's Shalloup,
(which we had found a convenient Boat, and therefore kept
her with their very good Will -y) at length I came fair on
the South Side of my Island, and I presently knew the ve-
ry Countenance of the Place,- so I brought the Ship safe to
an Anchor, Broadside with the little Creek where was my
old Habitation.
As soon as I saw the Place, I call'd for Friday, and ark d
him if he knew where he was? He look d about a liide,
and presently, clapping his Hands, cry'd O yes, O there,
O yes, O there, pointing to our old Habitation, and fell a
dancing and capering like a mad Fellow, and I had muck
ado to keep him from jumping into the Sea, to swim a-
sliore to the Place.
Well, Friday, fays I, do you think we shall find any bo-
dy here or no? And what do you think, (hall we sec vour
Father? The Fellow stood mute as a Stock a good while*
but when I nam'd his Father, the poor affectionate Creature
look'd dejected, and I could see the Tears run down his
Face very plentifully. What is the matter, Friday, lays I?
Are you troubled oecause you may see your Father? No,
no, Jays he, shaking his Head, no see him more, no ever
more see again 5 Why so, said I, Friday, ho\v do you know
that? O no, O no, lays Friday, he long ago die; long ago,
he much old Man. Well, well, fays I, Friday, you don t
know j but shall we see any one else then? The Fellow, it
seems, had better Eyes than I, and he points just to the Hill
B 4. above
al ove my old Houses and tho' we lay half a League off, h«
cries out,, me see! me fee! yes, yes, me see much Man there,
and there, and there. I look'd, but I could see no body,
no not with a Perspective Glass; which was, I suppose,
because I could not hit the Place, for the Fellow was right,
as I found upon Enquiry the next Day, and there was five
or svx Men altogether, stood to look at the Ship, not know-
ing what to think of us.
A s soon as Friday had told me he saw People, I caus'd
the English Ancient to be spread, and hVd three Guns, to
give them notice we were Friends, and in about half a
Quarter of an Hour after, we perceived a Smoak rile fi om
the Side of the Creek, so I immediately ordered a Boat out,
taking Friday with me, and hanging out a white Flag, or
a Flag of Truce, I went directly on Shore, taking with me
the young Fryer I mention'd, to whom I had told the
whole Story of my living there, and the Manner of it, and
every Particular both of my self, and those that I left there;
and who was on that Account extremely desirous to go
with me. We had besides about sixteen Men very well
arm d, if we had found any new Guests there which we
^id not know of, but we had no need of Weapons.
A s we went on Shore upon the Tide of Flood, near
high Water, we row'd directly into the Creek, and the first
Man, I fix'd my Eye upon, was the Ssmixrd whose Life I
had sav'd, and who I knew by his Face perfectly well 3 as
to his Habit I st all describe it afterwards. I order'd no bo-
dy to go on Shore at first but my self, but there was no
keeping Friday in the Boat; for the affectionate Creature
had Ipy'd his Father at a Distance, a good way off of the
Spaniards, where indeed I law nothing of him j and if they
had not let him go on Shore, he would have jump d into
the Sea. He was no sooner on Shore, but he flew away
to his Father like an Arrow out of a Bow. It would have
made any Man have Ihed Tears in spight of the firmest Re-
solution, to have seen the first Transports of this poor Fel-
low's Joy when he came to his Father j how he embrac d
him, kiss him,, strok d his Face, took him up in his Arms,
set him down upon a Tree,v and lay down by him then
stood and look'd at him, as anyone would look ata strange
/ Picture* for a Quarter of an Hour together; rJbenlye down
OB
(33)
on the Ground, and stroke his Legs, and kiss them, and
then get up again, and stare at him; one would ha' thought
the Fellow bewitch'd: But it would have made a
Dog laugh to lee how the next Day his Passion run
out another Way: In the Morning he walk'd along the
Shore, to and again, with his Father several Hoars, always
leading him by the Hand, as if he had been a Lady; and
every now and then would come to fetch something or
other for him to the Boat, either a Lump of Sugar, or a
Dram, a Bisket, or something or other that was good.
In the Afternoon his Frclicks run another Way j for then
he would set the old Man down upon the Ground, and
dance about him, and made a Thousand antick Posnucs
and Gestures} and all the while he did this, he would be
talking to him, and telling him one Story or another of
his Travel, and of what had happen'd to him Abroad, to
divert him. In short, if the lame filial Affection was to
be found in Christians to their Parents, in our Paits of the
World, one would be tempted to fay, there would hardly
ha1 been any Need of the fiftth Commandment.
But this is a Digression j I return to my Landing.
Ir would be endless to ake Notice of all the Ceremonies
and Civilities that the Spaniards receiv'd me with. The
first- Spaniard, who, as I laid, I knew very well, was
he whole Life I had lav'd j he ame towards the Boat,
attended by one more, carryings Flag of Truce also; and he
did not only not know me at first, but he had no Thoughts,
no Notion of its being me that was come, till I spoke to
him: Seignior* laid I, in Portuguese, Do you nor know
me? At which he spoke not a Woidj but giving his Mu-
sket to the Man that was wirh him, threw his Arms a-
broad, andfaying something in SpaniJI), that I did not p:rfecl>
Jy hear, came forward, and embraced me, telling me he
was inexcusable, not to know that Face again, that he had
once seen, as of an Angel fsom Heaven* lent to save his
^ Life: He laid Abundance of very handsome Things, as 3
well-bred Sp v/tard always knows how j and then beckon-
ing to the Per ion that attended him, bad him go and call
out his Comcrades. He then ask'd me, if I would ^Tilk
to ray old Habitation, where he would give me Pi iTnK ri
of my own House again, and wbec T iVould see fh.rehad
been but mean Improvements j so I walk'd Lien ^ with
B j* w him ,
but alas! I could no more find the Place again, than if I
had never been there > for they had planted so many Trees,
and plac'd them in such a Posture, so thick and close to
one anotherand in ten Year's Time they were grown so
big, that in short the Place was inaccessible, except by such
Windings and blind Ways, as they themselves only, who
made them, could find.
I ask'd them what put them upon all these Fortifica-
tions? He told me, I would fay there was need enough
of it, when they had given me an Account how they had
pass'd their Time since there Arriving in the Island, espe-
cially after they had the Misfortune to find that I was
gone; He told me, he could not but have some Satisfacti-
on in my good Fortune, when he heard that I was gone
in a good Ship, and to my Satisfaction; and that he had
often-timcs a strong Persuasion, that one Time or other he
should sec me again: But nothing that ever befel him in
his Life, he said, was so surprising and afflicting to him at
first, as the Disappointment he was under when he came
back to the Island, and found I was not there.
A s to the three Barbarians (so he call'd them) that were
left behind, and of whom he said he had a long Story to
tell me 5 the Spaniards all thought themselves much better
among the Savages, only that their Number was so small.
And, lays he, had they been strong enough, we had been
all long ago in Purgatory; and with that he cross'd him-
vsclf on the Breast: But, Sir, says he, I hope you will not
he displeased, when I shall tell you how, fore'd by Neces-
sity, we were oblig'd, for our own Preservation, to diiarm
them, and making them our Subjects, who would not be
content with being moderately our Masters, but would be
our Murtherers. I answered, I was heartily afraid of it
'when I left them there j and nothing troubled me at my
parting from the Istand, but that they were not come
back, that I might have put them in Postession of every •
Thing first, and*" left the other in a State of Subjection as
they defer v'd : But if they had redue'd them to it, I N»
was very glad, and should be very far from finding any
Fault with it $ for I knew they were a Parcel of refrac-
tory, unpovern'd Villains, and were sit for any Manner of
MifchW?
While
While I was laying this, came the Man whom lie
had sent back, and with him eleven Men more: In the
Dress they were in, it was impossible to guess what
Nation they are of: But he made all clear both to them
and to me. First he turn'd to me, and pointing to them,
said, These, Sir, are some of the Gent lemen who owe their
Lives to you j and then turningto them, and pointing to
me, he let them know who I was; upon which they all
came up one by one, not as if they had been Sailors and
ordinary Fellows, and I the like, but really, as if they had
been Ambassadors of Noblemen, and I a Monarch or a
great Conqueror 5 their Behaviour was to the lost .Degree
obliging and courteous, and yet mix'd with a manly, ma-
jestick Gravity, which very well became them; and in
short, they had so much more Manners than I, that I scarce
.knew how to receive their Civiltjes, much less how to re-
turn them in kind.
The History of their coming to, and Conduct in the
Island, after my going away, is so very remarkable, and
has so many Incidents, which the former Part of my Re-
lation will help to understand, and which, will, in most of
the Particulars, refer to that Account I haye already given,
that I cannot but commit them with great Delight to the
reading of those that come after me.
I stall no longer trouble the Story with a Relation in
the first Person, which will put me to the Expence often
Thousand said Vs, and said he's, and he told tm's and I told
bim's, and the like, but I stall collect the. Facts fiistoricalry,
as near as I can gather them out of my Memory from
what they related to me, and from what I met with in
my conversing with them, and with the Place.
J n order to do this succinctly, and as intelligibly as 1
can, I must go back to the Circumstance in which I left:
the Island, and which the Persons were in, of whom I am
to speak. And sii st it is necestary to repeats that I had sent
away Friday $ Father and the Spaniard, the two whose
Lives I had rescued from the Savages 5 I lay, I had sent
them away in a large Canoe to the Main, as Ithen thought
it, to letch over the Spaniard's Companions whom he had
left behind him, in order to save them from the like Ca-
lamity that he had been in; and in order to succour them for
the p/esent, and that if possible, we might together find
some Way for our Deliverance aftei waid, When
Whek I 4ent them away, I had no visible Appearance;
of, or the least Room to hope for my own Deliverance
any more than I had twenty Year before, much less had
I any Fore-knowledge of what after happened, I mean of an
EnglifiShvp coming on Shore there to fetch me off; and it
could not but be a very great Surprize to them when they
came back, not only to find, that I was gone, but to find
three Strangers left on the Spot, posse/s'd of all that I had
left behind me, which would otherwise have been their
CWfl.
The first Thing, however, which I enquir'd into, that
I might begin wheTe I left off, was of their own Part 5
and I desird he would give me a particular Account of
his Voyage back to his Countrymen with the Boat, when
I sent him to fetch them over. He told me there was
little Variety in that Part, for nothing remarkable happen'd
to them on the Way, they having very calm Weather, and
a smooth Sea $ for1 his Countrymen it could not be doubted
he said, but that they were over joy'd to ice him: It seems
he Was the principal Man among them, the Captain of the
Vessel they had: been Shipwrecked in (having been Dead
feme Time) they were, be said, the more Surprized to lee1
Jb»m, because they knew that he v/as fallen into the Hands of
the Savages, who, they were setisfy'd, would devour hint
as they did all the rest of their Prisoners j that when they told
them the Story of his Deliverance, and in what Manner
he was furaifh'd' for carrying them away, it was like
a Dream tia them; and their Astonishment, they /aid, was*
something like that of y^^'s Brethren, when he tokkhem1
who he was, and told them the Story of his Exaltation
in Tharoatis Court; But when he Ax:wed them the Arms,
the Powder, the Ball, and the Provisions that he brought
them for their Journey or Voyage, they were ]estor\i to
themselves, took a just Share of the Joy of their Delive-
rance,, and immediately prepared to come away with him.
Their first Business was to get Canoes; and in this
they were obliged not to stick so much upon the honest
Part of it, but to trespass upon their friendly Savages, and to
borrow two lai ge Canoes or Periagua's, on pretence of go-
Bog out a Fifliing, or for Pleasure,
wanted no Time'to get themselves ready, for they had no
Baggage, neitheir Clothes or Provisions, or any Thing in
the World, but what they had on them, and a few Roots-
to eat, of which they used to make their Bread.
They were in all three Weeks absents and in that
Time, unluckily for them, I had the Occasion offer'd for
my Escape, as I mentions in my other Part, and to get off
from the Island j leaving three of the most: impudent,
hardened, ungovern'd, difag. eeaHe Villains behind me, that
any Man could desire to meet with, to the poor Spaniards.
great Grief and Disappointment, you may be sure.
The only just Tiring the Rogues did, was, That when
the Spaniards came on Snore, they gave my Letter to them r
and gave them Provisions and other Relief, as I had or-
dered them to do al ib they gave them the long Paper of
Directions which I had left with them, containing the
Particular Methods which I took for managing every Part
of my Life theie, the Way how T baked my Bread,
bied up my tame Goats, and planted my Corn, how I
an'd my Giapes, made my Pots and, in a Word, every
Thing I did, all this being Written down, they g^ve
to the Spaniards, two of whom understand Ixgtijh well
enough; nor did they refuse to aeeomodate the Spaninnls
with any Thing else, for they agreed veiy well tor some
Time; they gave them an equal Admission into the House;
or Cave, and they began to live very sociably j and the Head
Spaniard* who had seen pretty much cf my Method, and
Friday's Father together, manag'd all their Affairs; for, as
the Island, shoot Parrots, and catch To toises, and when
they came Home at Night, the Spaniards provided their
Suppers for them.
The Spaniards would have been satifsy'd with this,
would the other but have let 'em alone, which, however.they
t could not find in their Hearts to do long; but,like the Dog in
the Manger, they would not eat themselves, and would
not let others eat neither: The Differences, nevertheless,
were at first but trivial, and such as are not worth relating;
but at last it broke out into open War, and it begun with
all the Rudeness and Iniblence that can be imagin'd, with-
out Reason,, without Provocation, contrary to Natuie,ar.d in-
deed*
 
they did nothing but Ramble about
deed, to common Sense j and tho* it is true the first Re-
lation of it came from the Spaniards themselves, who I
may call the Accusers, yet when I came to examine the
Fellows, they could not deny a Word of it.
But before I come to the Particulars of this Part. I
must supply a Defect in my former Relation, and this was,
that I forgot to set down among the rest, that just as we
were weighing the Anchor to let Sail, there, happened a
little Quarrel on hoard our Ship, which I was afraid once
would have turned to a second Mutiny j nor was it ap-
peased, till the Captain routing up his Courage, and taking
us all to his Assistance, parted them by Force, and making
two of the most refactoi y Fellows Prisoners, he laid them
in Irons, and as they had been active in the former Disor-
ders, and let fall some ugly dangerous Words the second
Time, he threatn'd to carry them in Irons to England and
have them hang'd there for Mutiny, and running away
with the Ship.
T h 1 s, it seems, tho' rhe Captain did not intend to do
it, frighted some other Men in the Ship, and some of
them had put it into the Heads of the rest, that the Cap-
tain only gave them good Words for the present, till they
should come to some Engl'tfo Port, and that then they
should be all put into a Jay], and try'd for their Lives.
The Mate got Intelligence of this, and acquainted us
with it j upon which it was dehVd, that I, who still paiVd
for a great Man among them, should go down with the
Mate, and satisfy the Men, and tell them, that they might
be assured, if they behav'd well the rest of the Voyage, all
they had done for the Time past should be pardon'd. So
I went, and after passing my Honour's Word to them, they
appeared easy 3 and the more so, when I caused the two
Men, who were in Irons, to be released and forgiven.
But this Mutiny had brought us to an Anchor for that
Night, the Wind also falling calm, next Morning we
found, that our two Men who had been laid in.Irons, had
stele each of them a Musket, and some other Weapons, \
what Powder or Shot they had, we know not; and had
taken the Ship's Pinnace, which was not yet haPd up,and
ran away with her to their Companions, in Rogury, on
Shore.
As
A s soon as we found this, I order'd the Long-Boat on
Shore, with twelve Men and the Mate, and away they
went to seek the Rogues, hut they could neither find them,
or any of the rest for they all fled into the Woods when
they saw the Boat coming on Shore. The Mate was once
resolv'd in Justice to their Rogery, to have destroyed their
Plantations, burnt all their Housliold-Stuff and Furniture,
and left them to shift without it j but having no Order,
he let all alone, left every Thing as they found it, and
bringing the Pinnace away, came on Board without
them.
These two Men made their Number five, but the o-
ther three Villains were so much wickeder than these, that
after they had been 2 or 3 Days together, they turned
their two New-Comers out of Doors to shift for them-
selves, and would have nothing to do with them, nor
could they for a good while be persuaded to give them
any Food; as for trie Spaniards they were not yet come.
When the Spaniards came first on Shore, the Bufinels
began to go forward j the Spaniards would have persuad-
ed the three Englistj Brutes to have taken in their two
Countrymen again, that, as they laid, they might be all
one Family ; but they would not hear of it : So the two
poor Fellows liv'd by themselves, and finding nothing but
Industry and Application would make them live comfort-
ably, they pitch'd their Tents on the Nortb-fcorc of the
Island, but a little more to the West, to be out of the
Danger of the Savages, who always landed on the Baft
Parts of the Island.
Here they built them two Huts, one to lodge in, and
the other to lay up their Magazines and Stores in, and the
Spaniards having given them some Corn for Seed, and es-
pecially some of the Peas which I had left them, they dug
and planted, and enclosed; after the Pattern I had set for
them all, and began to live pretty well j their first Crop of
Corn was on the Ground, and tho' it was but a link bit
of Land which they had dug up at first, having had but a
little Time, yet it was enough to relieve them, and find
them with Bread and other Eatables j and one of the Fel-
lows being the Cook's Mate of the Ship, was vc y ready
at making Soup, Puddings, and such other Preparations,
as
c 4o
as the Rice, and the Milk, and such little Flesh as they
got, fumisiYd him to do.
They were going on in a little thriving Posture, when
the three unnatural Rogues, their own Countrymen too,
in mere Humour, and to insult them, came and bully'd
them, and told them, the Island was theirs; that the Go-
vernour, meaning me, had given them Possession of it,
and no Body else had any right to it, and damn 'em, they
should build no Houses upon their Ground, unless they
would pay them Rent for them.
T h e two Men thought they had jested at first \
ask'd them to come and lit down, and sec what fine
Houses they were, that they had built, and tell them what
Rent they demanded, and one of them merrily told them,
if they were Ground-Land lords, he hoped, if they built
Tenements upon the Land, and made Improvements, they
would, according to the Custom of all Landlords, grant
them a long Lease, and bid them go fetch a Sciivener to
draw the Wiitings. One of the three damning and rage-
ing, told them, they stould fee the}' weic not in Jell,
and going to a little Place at a Distance, where the honest
Men had made a Fire to dress their Victuals, he takes a
Fire-biand, and claps it to the Out-lide of their Hut, and
very fairly set it on Fire, and it would have been all burnt
down in a few Minutes, if one of the two had not run to
the Fellow, thrust him away, and trod the Fire out with
liis Feet, and that not without some Difficulty too.
T ii e Fellow was in such a Rage at the honest Man's
thrusting him away, that he turn'd upon him with a Pole
he had in his Hand, and had not the Man avoided the Blow
very nimbly, and run into the Hut, he had ended his Days
at once 5 his Comrade seeing the Danger they were both
in, run in after him, and immediately they came both
out with their Muskets, and the Man that was fust struck
at with the Pole, knock'd the Feilow down, who begun
the Quarrel, with the Stock of the Musket, and that be-
fore the other two could come to help him, and then see*
ing the rest come at them, they stood together, and pre-
senting the other Ends of their Pieces to them, bad them
stand off.
The other had Fit e-Arms with them too, but one of
the two honest Men, L older than his Comrade, and made
( 4') .
desperate by his Danger, told them, if they offer'd to
move Hand or Foot they were dead Men, boldly com-
manded them to lay down their Arms. They did not
indeed lay down their Arms, but seeing him resolute, it
brought them to a Parley, and they consented to take their
wounded Man with them, and be gone; and indeed it seems
the Fellow was wounded sufficiently with the Blow;
however, they wee much in the wrong, since they had
the Ad/anrage, that they did not disarm them effectually, as
they might have dore, and have~gone immediately to the
Spaniards, and given them an Account how the Rogues had
treated them tor the three Villains studied nothing but
Revenge, and every Day gave them some intimation that
they did so.
But not to crow'd this Part with an Account of the
lesler Part of their Roguries, such as treading down their
Corn, mooting three young Kids, and a She-Goat, which
the poor Men had got to breed up Tame for their Store;
and, in a Word, plaguing them Night and Day in this
Manner, it forced the two Men to sticn a Desperation, that
they resolv'd to tight them all three the first Time they
had a fair Opportunity,- in order to this they resolv'd
to go to the Castle, as they called it, that was my old
Dwelling where the three Rogues and the Spaniards all
liv'd together, at that Time 5- intending to have a fair Bat-
tle, and xhc Spaniards should stand by to fee fair Play j- so they
got up in the Morning before Day, and came to the Place,
and calFd the Engkfomen by their Names, telling a Spani-
ard that answer'd, that they wanted to speak with them.
I t happen'd that the Day before two of the Spaniards
having been in the Woods, had seen one of the two Eng~
liftmen, who, for Distinction, I call the Honest Men; and
he had made a fad Complaint to the Spatiiards, of the
barbarous Uiage they had met with from their three Country-
men, and how they had ruin'd their Plantation, and destroy'd
their Corn, that they had labour'd so hard to bring for-
ward, and kilTd the Miltch-Goat, and their tfree Kids,
which was all they had provided for their Sustenance, and
that if he and his Friends, meaning the Spaniards, did not
assist them again, they should be starved. When the Spa-
niards came Home at Night, and they were all at Supper,'
he took the Freedom to reprove the three EnjiiJhweK, tlio'
<4» )
in gentle and mannerly Terms, and ask'd them, How they
could be so cruel, they being harmless inoffensive Fellows,
and that they were putting themselves in a Way to subsist
by their Labour, and that "it had cost them a great deal: of
Pains to bring Things to such a Perfection as they had?
One of the Englishmen returns very briskly, what had
they to do thei e? That they came on Shore without
Leave, and they should not Plant or Build upon the Hland,
it was none of their Ground. Why, fays the Spaniard
very calmly, Seignior Inglese, they must not starve f The
Englishmen reply d like a true rough-hewn Tarpaulin, they
might starve and be damn'd, they should not Plant nor
Build in that Place. But what must they do then, Seig-
nor, fays the Spaniard .? Another of the Brutes returned,
do! D—~m 'em, they should be Servants and work for
them. But how can you expect that of them, they are
not bought with your Money; you have no Right to
make them Servants? The Englishmen answer'd, the Island
was theirs, the Govemour had given it to them, and no
Man had any thing to do there but themselves $ and with
that swore by his Maker, that they would go and burn
all their new Huts> they should build none upon their
Land.
Why, Seignior, fays the Spaniard, by the fame Rule
we must be your Servants too? Ay, fays the bold Dog,
and so you shall too, before we have done with you, mix-
ing two or three G—d Damme s in the proper Intervals of
his Speech the Spaniard only smil d at that, and made him
no Answer: However, this little Discourse had heated them,
and starting up, one siys to the other, I think it was he
they call d Will. Atkins, Come Jack, let us go and have the
t'other Brush with them; well demolish their Castle,
111 warrant you, they shall plant no Colony in our Domi-
nions.
Upon this, they went all Trooping away, with every
Man a Gun, a Pistol, and a Sword, ana1 mutter'd some in-
solent Things among themselves, of what they would do
to the Spaniards too, when Opportunity .offer'd j but the
Spaniards, it seems, did not so perfectly understand them,
as to .know all the Particulars, only, that in general, they
thjeatned them Iwd for taking the two Englishmen* Part.
Whether
Whether they went, or how they bestow'd their
Time that Evening, the Spaniards laid, they did not know;
but it seems they wander'd about the Country, pai t of the
Night, and then lying down in the Place which / used to
call my Bower, they were weary, and over-slept them-
selves. The Cafe was -this, they had rcsolv'd to flay till
Mid-night, and so to take the poor Men when they were
asleep, and as they acknowledged it afterwards, intended
to set Fire to their Huts while they were in them, and ei-
ther burn them in them, or murder them as they came
out: and as Malice seldom sleeps very sound, it was very
Change they fhculd not have been kept waking.
However, as the two Men had also a Design upon
them, as J have said, tho' a much fairer one than that of
Burning and Murdering, it happen d, and very luckily for
them all, that they were up and gone abroad, before the
bloody-minded Rogues came to their Huts.
When they came there and found the Men gone, At*
k'msy who it ieems was the forwarded: Man, call d out to
his Comrades, ha' Jack, here s the Nest, but, D—n 'em,
the Birds are flown: They mused a while to think what
should be the Occasion of their being gone abroad so soon,
and suggested presently that the Spaniards had given them
Notice of it, and with that they .shook Hands, and swore
to one another that they would be reveng'd of the Sfam-
ards. As soon as they had made this bloody Bargain, they
fell to work with the poor Mens Habitation, they did not
set Fire indeed to any Thing, but they pulTd down both
their Houses, and pull d them so Limb from Limb, that
they left not the least Stick standing, or scarce any Sign on
the Ground where they stood; they tore all their little col-
lected Housliold Stuff in pieces, and threw every thing a-
bout in such a Manner, that the poor Men found afterward s
some of their Things a Mile off from their Habitation.
When they had done this, they pull d up all the young
, Trees which the poor Men had planted; puH'd up the En-
closure they had made to secure their Cattie and their Corn j
and, in a Word, seck'd and plunder'd every thing, as com-
pleatly as a Hoard of Tartars would have done.
The two Men were at this Juncture gone to find them
out, and had resolv'd to fight them where-ever they had
been, tho* they were but two to three: So that had they
met,
met, thcic certainly would have been Blood "shed among
them, for they were all very stout lcsolute Fellows, to give
them their due.
But Providence took more Care to keep them asunder,
then they themselves could do to meet; for, a.: if they had
degg'd one another, when the three were goae thither,
the two were here; and aftei wards wh-m the two went
back to find them, thethice were come to the old Habi-
tation again; we shall see their differing Conduct p;esenr]y.
When the three came back, like fuiicus Creatures, flush d
with the Rage which the Wor-k they had teen about put
them into, they came up to the Spaniards* and told them
what they had done, by way of Scoff and Biavado; and
one of them stepping up to one of the Spaniards, as if they
had letn a couple of Boys at play, takes hold of his Hat, as
it was upon his Head, and giving it a Twirl about, fleer-
in his Face, fays he to him, And you, Seignior, Jack Spani-
ard, fliall have the fame Sauce, if you do not mend your Man-
ners: The Spaniard, who tho' a quiet civil Man, was as
brave, as a Man could be desired to be, and withal a strong
well-made Man, look d steadily at him for a good while,
and then, having no Weapon in his Hand, stept gravely up
to him, and with one Blow of his Fistknock'd him down,
as an Ox is fell d with a Pole-Ax; at which one of the
Rogues, insolent at the first, fir'd his Pistol at the Spaniard
immediately5 he missd his Body indeed, for the Bullets
went thro* his Hair, but one of them touclVd the tip of his
Ear, and he bled pretty much. The Blood made the Spa-
niard believe, he was more hurt than he really was, and
that put him into some Heat, for before, he acted all in a
perfect Calm; but now resolving to go thro' his with Work,
he stoop d and tooktheFellow's Musket whom he had knock d
down, and was just going to shoot the Man who had fir'd
at him, when the rest of the Spaniards being in the Cave
come out, and calling to him not to ikoot, they stept in,
secur'd the other two, and took their Arms from them.
When they we e thus dismarm'd, and found they had
made all the Spaniards their Enemies, as well as their own
Countrymen, they began to cool, and giving the Spaniards
better Words, would have had their Arms again; but the
Spaniards considering the Feud that was between them and the
other two EnglifJimen, and that it would be the best Method!
they
they could take, to keep them from one another, told them
they would do them no harm, raid if they would live
peaceably, they would be very willing to assist: and sociate
with them, as they did before, but that they could not
think of giving them their Arms again, while they appear'd
so rcsolv'd to do Milchicf with them to their own Country-
men, and had even threatned them all, to make them their
Servants.
The Rogues were now more capable to hear Reason,
than to act Reason, but being refus'd their Arms, they went
raving away, and raging like Madmen, threatning what
they would do, tho' they had no Fire-Ai ms: But the Spa-
niards despihng their Threatning, told them they should
take caie how they ofjer'd any Injury to their Plantation
or Cattle, for if they did, they would moot them as they
woidd do ravenous Beasts, where-ever they found them;
and if they fell into their Hands alive, they mould certainly
be hangd. However, this was far from cooling them;
but away they went raging and swearing like Furies of Hell.
As soon as they were gone, came back the two Men in
Passion and Rage enough also, tho' of another kind; for
having been at their Plantation, and rinding it all demolish'd
and destroy d, as above, it will easily be suppose! they had
Provocation enoughthey could scarce have room to tell
their Tale, the Spaniards were so eager to tell them theirs?
and it was strange enough to find that Three Men mould
thus bully Nineteen, and receive no Punishment at all.
T h f. Spaniards indeed despised them, and especially hav-
ing thus disarm d them, made light of all their Threat-
nine;* $ but the two Englishmen relolv'd to have their Re-
medy against them., what Pains soever it cost to find them
out.
But the Spaniards interpos'd here too, and told them,
that as they were already disarm d, they could riot consent
that they (the Two) should pursue them with Fire-Arms,
• and perhaps kill them; but, laid the grave Spaniard, who
was their Govemour, we will endeavour to make them do
you justice, if you will leave it to us,* for as there is no
doubt but they will come to us again when their Passion
is over, being not able to subsist without our Assistance ^
we promise you to make no Peace with them, without
having a full Satisfaction for you i and upon this Condi-
tion we hope you will premise, to use no Violence with
them, other than in your own Defence.
The two Englifomen yielded to this very awkardly, and
with great Reluctance, but the Spaniards protested, they
did it only to keep them from blood shed, and to make all
easy at last, for, said they, we are not so many of us, here
is Room enough for us all, and it is great Pity we should
not be all good Friends; at length they did consent, and
Waited for the Issue of the Thing, living for some Days
with the Spaniards, for their own Habitation was de»
stroyed.
I n about five Days Time the th< ee Vagrants, tir'd with
wandring, and almost staiv'd with Hunger, having chiefly
liv'd on Turtles Eggs all that while, came back to the
Grove; and finding my Sp^rJarf, who, as I have said,
was the Governour, and two more with him walking by
the Side of the Creek; they came up in a very submissive
humble Manner, and begg'd to be receiv'd again into the
Family. The Spaniards used them civilly* but told them,
they had acted lo unnaturally by their Countrymen, and so
very grossly by them (the Spaniards) that they could
not come to any Conclusion, without consulting the two
'Enghfoment and the rest; but however, they would go to
them and discourse about it, and they should know in half
an Hour, It may be guessVh that they were very hard
put to it, for it seems, as they were to wait this halt Hour
for an Answer, they begg'd he would send them out some
Bread in the mean Time, which he did, and sent them at
the same Time a large Piece of Goat's Flesh, and a boisd
Parrot, which they eat very heartily, for they were hungry
enough.
After half an Hour's Consultation they were call'd in,
and a long Debate had about them, their two Countrymen
charging them with the Ruin of all their Labour, and a
Design to murther them; all which they own'd before,
and therefore could not deny now 5 upon the whole, the
Spaniards acted the Moderators between them, and as they
had oblig'd the two Englifomen not to hurt the three while
they were naked and unarm'd, so they now oblig'd the
three to go and rebuild their Fellows two Huts, one to be
of the fame pimeniions, and the other larger than they
were before 5 also to fence their Ground again, where
they had pull'd up the Fences, plant Trees in the Room,
of those pulTd up, dig up tJie Land again for planting
Corn,, where they had IpoiFd it5 and in a Word, to re-
store every Thing in the lame State as they found it, as
near as they could, for entirely it could not be, the Season
for the Corn, and the Growth of the Trees and Hedges,,
not being possible to be recove-ul,
Well, they submitted to ail this; and as they had
Plenty of Pioviscns given them aif the while, they grew
very orderly, and ch>: whole Society began to live pleasant-
ly, and agreeably together again; only that these three Fel-
lows could never be persuaded to work > I mean not for
themselves, except now and then a little, just as they plea-
sed j however, the Spaniards told them plainly, that if they
would but live sociably and friendly together, and study in
the whole the Good of the Plantation,* they would be con-
tent to work for them, and let them walk about and be
as idle as they pleas'd j and thus having liv'd pretty well
together for a Month or two, the Spaniards gave them
Arms again, and gave them Liberty to go abroad with
them as before.
I t was not above a WTeek after they had these Arms,
and went abroad, but the ungrateful Creatures began to
be as insolent and troublesome as before; but however,
an Accident happening presently upon this, which endan-
gered the Safety of them all, they were oblig'd to lay by
all private Rcientments, and look to the Preservation of
their Lives.
I t happen'd one Night, that the Spariard Governnour,
as I call him, that is to fay, the Spaniard whose Lire I had
siv'd, who was now the Captain, or Leader, or Govern-
ngur of the rest, found himself very uneasy in the Night,
and could by no Means get any Sleep: He was perfectly
weil in Body, as he told me the Story, onlv found his
Thoughts tumultuous; his Mind run upon Men fighting*
t and killing one another, but was broad awake, and
and could not by any Means get any Sleep > in short, he
re&Iv'd to rise; As they lay, (being fb many of them, upon
Goat-skins, laid thick upon such Couches, and Pads, as they
made for themselves j and not in Hammocks and Ship-
Beds, as I did, who was but one, so they had little to do^
lay a great while, but
 
and more uneasy, he
wktt
whei they were willing to rise, but to get up upon their
Feet, and perhaps put on a Coat, fiich as it was, and then-
Pumps, and they were ready for going any Way that their
Thoughts guided them.
Being thus gotten up, he look'd out, but being dark,
he could lee little or nothing, and besides, the Trees which
I had planted, as in my former Account is described, and
which were now grown tall, intercepted his Sight, so that
he could only lock up, and fee that it wes a clear Star-
light Night, and hearing no Noise, he return'd and laid
him down again; but it was all one, he could not sleep,
nor could he compose himself to any thing like Rest, hut
his Thoughts were to the last Degree uncaiy, and yet he
knew not for what.
Having made some Noise with rising and walking
about, going out and coming in, another of them wak'd,
and calling, ask'd. Who it was that was up? The Governour
told him, how it had been with him: Say you so, fays,
the other Spaniard, such Things are not to be slighted, I
allure you; there is certainly some Mischief working, fays
he, near us, and presently he asked him, where are the
Englijhmen? They are all in their Huts, says he, safe enough.
It seems, the Spaniards had kept Possession of the main
Apartment, and had made a Place, where the three Zng-
lifJnnen, since their last Mutiny, always quarter'd by them-
selves, and could not come at the rest. Well, lays the Spa-
niard, there is something in It, I am persuaded from my
own Experience j I am iatisfy'd our Spirits embodied have
a Converse with, and receive Intelligence from, the Spi-
rits unembodied, and inhabiting the invisible World, and
this friendly Notice is given for our Advantage, if we know
how to make use of it. Come, fays be, let us go out and
look abroad, and if we find nothing at all in it to justify
the Trouble, I'll tell you a Story to the Purpose, that shall
convince you of the Justice of my proposing it.
In a Word, they went out to go to the Top of the
Hill, where I u$y to go, but they being strong and in
good Company, not alone, as I was, us3d none of my
Cautions, to go up by the Ladder, and then pulling it
up after them, to go up a second Stage to the Top, but
were going round through the Grove unconcerns and un-
wary, when they wereYurpriz/d with seeing a Light, as^
Up)
<t>f Fire a very little Way off from them, and hearing tha
Voices of Men, not of one, or two, but of a great Num-
ber.
In all the Discoveries I had made of the Savages land-
ing on the Island, it was my constant Care to prevent
them making the least Discovery of there being any Inha-
bitant upon the Place ,• and when by any Necessity they
came to know it, they felt it so effectually, that they that
got away, were scarce able to give any Account of it j
for we disappears as soon as possible, nor did ever any
that had seen me, escape to tell any one else, except it was
the three Savages in our last Encounter, who jump'd into
the Boat, of whom I mention'd, that I was afraid they
fliould go Home and bring more Help.
Whether it was the Consequence of the Escape of
those Men, that so great a Number came now together;
or whether they came ignorantly and by Accident on their
usual bloody Errand, the Spaniards could not it seems un-
derstand ,• but whatever it was, it had been their Business,
either to have conceaTd themselves, and not to have seen
them at all j much less to have let the Savages have seen
that there were any Inhabitants in the Place: But to have
fallen upon them so effectually, as that not a Man of them
should have escap'd, which could only have been by get-
ting in between them and their Boats ,* but this Pi esencc
of Mind was wanting to them, which was the Ruin of
their Tranquility for a great while. #
W e need not doubt, but that the Governour and the
Man with him, surpnVd with this Sight, ran back im-
mediately, and rais'd their Fellows, giving them an Account
of the imminent Danger they were all in; and they again
as readily took the Alarm, but it was impossible to per-
suade them to stay close within where they were, but that
they must run all out to see how Things stood.
While it was dark indeed, they were well enough,
and they had Opportunity enough for some Hours to view
them by the Light of three Fires they had made at some
Distance from one another, what they were doing they
knew not, and what ro do themselves they knew not j
for, first, the Enemy were too many,* and secondly, they
did not keep together, but were divided into seveial Par-
ties, and were on Shore in several Places.
C The
(50 >:
The Spaniards were in no small Consternation at this
Sight -y and as they found that the Fellows ran straggling
all over the Shore, they made no Doubt, but first or last,
some of them would chop in upon their Habitation, or
upon some other Place, where they would fee the Tokens
of Inhabitants, and they were in great Perplexity also for
fear of their Flock of Goats, which would have been lit-
tle less than starving them, if thev should have been de-
stroy d j so the first Thing they retolv'd upon, was to di£
patch three Men away before it was light, viz. two Spa-
niards and one Englifiman, to drive all the Goats away to
the great Valley where the Cave was, and if Need were,
to diive them into the very Cave it self.
Could they have seen the Savages altogether in one
Body, and at any Distance from their Canoes, they resolv'd,
if tney had been an hundred of them, to have attacked
them i but that could not be obtain'd, for they were some
of them two Miles off from the other, and, as it appear'd
afterwards, were of two different Nations.
After having mused a great while on the Course
they should take, and beaten their Brains in considering
their present Circumstances j they refolv'd at last, while it
was dark, to fend the old Savage, (Friday's Father) out, as
a Spy, to learn if possible, something concerning them, as
what they came for, and what they intended to do, and
the Iske; the old Man readily undertook it, and stripping
himself quite naked, as most of the Savages were, away
he went: After he had been gone an Hour or two, he
brings Word, that he had been among them undiscovered,
that he found they were two Parties, and of two several
Naticns who had War with one another, and had had
a great Battle in their own Country, and that both
Sides having had several Prisoners taken in the Fight, they
were by nicer Chance landed all in the fame 1 stand, tor the
devouring their Prisoners, and making merry j but their
coming ib by Chance to the fame Place had spoil'd all their
MiiihTihat they wave in a g eat Rage atone another, and
that so near, that he Lelicv'd they would sight again,
as soon as Day-light began to appear,- but he did not per-
ceive that they had any Notion of any body's being on the
Island but themselves. H<?, had hardly made an End of tel-
lino- His Story, when they could perceive,- by the unusual
"b Noise
(*I)
Noise they made, that the two little Armies were engag'd
in a bloody Fight.
Friday's Father used all the Arguments he could to per-
suade our People to lie close, and not be seen j he told them
their Safety consisted in it, and that they had nothing to
do but to lie still, and the Savages would kill one another
to their Hands, and the rest would go away j and it was
so to a Tittle. But it was impossible to prevail, especially
upon the Englijlimen> their Curiosity was so importunate
upon their Prudentials, that they must run out and see the
Battle: However, they used some Caution too, (viz.)
they did not go openly, just by their own Dwelling, but
went farther into the Woods, and plac'd themselves to Ad-
vantage, where they might securely see them manage the
Fight, and, as they thought, not be seen by them j but it
seems the Savages did iee them, as we {hall find here-
after.
The Battle was very fierce, and if I might believe the
~EngUJhmen, one of them laid, he could perceive, that some
of them were Men of great Bravery, or invincible SpiritSj
and of great Policy in guiding the Fight. The Battle,
they faia, held two Hours, before they could guess which
Party would be beaten; but then that Party which was
nearest our People's Habitation began to appear weakest, and
after some Time more, some of them began to fly ,- and
this put our Men again into a great Consternation, lest any
of those that fled mould run into the Grove* before their
Dwelling, for Shelter, and thereby involuntarily discover
the Place $ and that by Consequence the Pursuers Ihould do
the like in Search for them. Upon this they reiolv'd that
they would stand arm'd within the Wall, and whoever came
into the Grove, they mould {ally out over the Wall and
kill them ,• Ib that, if possible, not one should return to
give an Account of it 5 they order'd also, that it should be
done with their Swords, or by knocking them down with
the Stock of the Musket, but not by shooting them, for
fear of railing an Alerm by the Noiie.
A s they expected, it fell out,- three of the routed Army
fled for Life, and, crossing the Creek, ran directly into
the Place, not in the least knowing whether they" went,
but running as into a thick Wood for Shelter j the Scout
C 1 they
they kept to look Abroad, gave Notice of this within,
with this Addition, to our Mens great Satisfaction, (viz.)
That the Conquerors had not pursued them, or seen which
"Way they were gone 5 upon this, the Spaniard Governour,
a Man or Humanity, would not suffer them to kill die
three Fugitives, but fending three Men out by the Top of
the Hill, order'd them to go round and come in behind
them, surprise and take 'em Prisoners, which was done; the
Residue of the conquer'd People fled to their Canoes and
got off to Sea; the Victors retir'd, and made no Pursuit,
or very little, but drawing themselves into a Body toge-
ther, gave two great skrcaming Shouts, which they sup-
posed was by Way of Triumph, and so the Fight ended:
And the fame Day, about three a Clock in the Afternoon,
they also marched to their Canoes. And thus the Spani-
ards had their Island again free to themselves, their Fright
was over, and they saw no Savages in several Years
after.
After they were all gone, the Spaniards came out of
their Den, and viewing the Field of Battle, they found
about two and thirty dead Men upon the Spot > some
were kill'd with great long Arrows, some of which were
found sticking in their Bodies; but most of them were
kiird with their great wooden Swords, sixteen or seven-
teen of which they found in the Field of Battle, and as
many Bows, with a great many Arrows: These Swords
were stiange great unweildy Things, and they must be
very strong Men that used them: Most of thole Mai that
were kilTd with them, had their Heads masli'd to pieces,
as we may fay, or, as we call it in Englijh, their Brains
knock'd out, and several their Arms and Legs broken;
so that 'tis evident they fight with inexpressible Rage and
Fury: They found not one wounded Man that was not
stone-dead; for either they stay by their Enemy till they
have quite kill'd him, or they carry all the wounded Men,
that aie not qute dead, away with them.
This Deliverance tairsd our Engtifomen for a great
while y the Sight had sill'd them with Horror, and the
Consequences appeared terrible to the last Degree, especi-
ally upon supposing that some Time or other they should
fail into the Hands of those Creatures, who would not on 
ly kill them as Enemies, but kill them for Food, as we
kill
kill our Cattle. And they profess'd to me, that the
Thoughts of being eaten up like Beef or Mutton, though
it was supposed it was not to be, till they were dead, had
something in it so horrible, that it nauseated their very
Stomachs, made them sick when they thought of it, and
fill'd their Minds with such unusual Terror, that they were
not themselves for some Weeks after.
T h t s, as I said, ram'd even the three Englifi Brutes, I
have been speaking of; and for a great while after, they
were very tractable, and went about the common Busi-
ness of the whole Society well enough: planted, ibwd,
reapd, and began to be all naturaliz d to the Country >
But sometime after this, they fell all into siich simple
Measures again as brought them into a great deal o£
Trouble.
They had taken three Prisoners, as I had obsorv.d, and
theso three being lusty stout young Fellows, they made
them Servants, and taught them to work for them j and,
as Slaves, they did weS enough; but they did not take
their Measures with them, as I did by my Man Friday*
viz,, to begin with them upon the Principle of having sa-
ved their Lives, and then instruct them in the ratioral
Principles of Life, much less of Religion, civilizing 3.0 J
reducing them by kind Usage and affectionate Arguirgs;
but as they gave them their Food ever y Day, so they >rtve.
them their Work too, and kept them fully employ--sl in
Drudgery enough* but they fxl d in this, by it, that they
never had them to assist them and fight for them, as I had
my Man Friday, who was as true to me as the very Flesh
upon my Bones.
B u t to come to the Family Part, being all now good
Friends; for common Danger, as I laid above, had effectu-
ally reconcil'd them, they oegan to consider their general
Circumstances and the first Thing that came under their
Consideration was, Whether, feeing the Savages particularly
haunted that Side of the Island, and that there were more
remote and retir'd Parts of it equally adapted to their Way
of Living, and manifestly to their Advantage, they should
not rather remove their Habitation, and plant in some more
proper Place for their Safety, and especially for the Secu-
rity of their Cattle and Corn?
Upon
Upon this, after long Debate, it was concluded, That
they would not remove their Habitation because that some
Time or other, they thought they might hear from their
Governour again, meaning me and if I should send any one
to seek them, I should be sure to direct them to that Side,
where if they should find the. Place demolinYd, they would
conclude the Savages had kill'd us all, and we were gone,,
and so our Supply would go away too.
But as to their Corn and Cattle, they agreed to remove
them into the Valley where my Cave was, where the
Land was as proper to both, and where indeed there was
Land enough: However, upon second Thoughts, they
altered one Part of their Resolution too, and resolv'd
only to remove Part of their Cattle thither, and plant
Part of their Corn there, and so if one Part was desti oyJd
the other might be sev'd: And one Part of Prudence they
used, which it was very well they did, viz. That they
never trusted these three Savages, which they had taken
Prisoners, with knowing any Thing of the Plantation they
had made in that Valley, or of any Cattle they had there
much less of the Cave there, which they kept in Case of
Necessity, as a safe Retreat, and thither they carried also
the two Barrels of Powder, which I had sent them at
my coming away.
u t however they resolv'd not to change their Habi-
tativ-mjyet they agreed, that as I had carefully cover'd it first
witii a Wall or Fortification, and then with a Grove of
Trees j so, seeing their Safety consisted entirely in their be-
ing conceal'd, of which they were now fully convince! 5 they
set to work to cover and conceal the Place yet more ef-
fectually than before: To this Purpose, as I had planted
Trees, (or rather thrust in Stakes, which in Time all grew
up to lie Trees) for some good Distance before the En-
trance into my Apartment, they went on in the seme Man-
ner, and filPd up the rest of that whole Space of Ground,,
from the Trees I had set, quite down to the Side of the
Creek, where, as I said, I landed my Floats, and even in-
to the very Ouze where the Tide flow'd, not so much as
leaving any Place to land, or any Sign that there had been
any landing thereabout: These Stakes also, being of a Wood
very forward to grow, as I have noted formerly, they took
Care to have generally very much larger and taller than-
those which I had planted, and placed them so very . thick
and close that when they had been three or four Years
grown, there was no piercing with the Eye any conside-
rable Way into the Plantation: As for that Part which
shad planted, the Trees were grown as thick as a Man's
Thigh; and among them they placed so many other short
ones, and so thick, that, in a Word, it stood like a Pallisa-
do, a quarter of a Mile thick, and it was next to impos-
sible to penetrate it, but with a little Army to cut it all
down; for a little Dog could hardly get between the Trees,
they stood so close.
But this was not all? for they did the fame by all the
Ground to the right Hand, and to the Left, and round e-
ven to the Top of the Hill} leaving no Way, not so much
as for themselves to come out, but by the Ladder placed
up to the Side of the Hill, and then lifted up, and placed
again from the first Stage up to the Top j which Ladder,
when it was taken down, nothing but what had Wings'
or Witchcraft to assist it, could come at them.
This was excellently well contriv'd: Nor was it less
than what they afterwards found Occasion for; which
serv'd to convince me, that as human Prudence has Au-
thority of Providence to justify it, so it has, doubtless, the
Direction of Providence to let it to Work j and would we
listen carefully to the Voice of it, I am fully persuaded we
might prevent many of the Disasters which our Lives are
now, by our own Ncligence, subjected to. But this by
the Way.
I return to the Story. They livM two Years after this
in perfect Retirement, and had no more Visits from the
Savages: They had, indeed, an Alarm given them one
Morning which put them into a great Consternation; for
some of the Spaniards being out early one Morning on the
West Side, or rather End of the Island,which by the Way, was
that End where I never went, for fear of being discovers,
they were surpriz'd with seeing above twenty Canoes of
Indians, just coming on Shore.
They made the best of their Way Home, in Hurry
enough j and giving the Alarm to their Comrades, they
kept close all that Day and the next, going out only at
Night, to make Observation: But they had the good Luck
C -^ t*
C 56)
to be mistaken j for, where-ever the Savages went, they
did not Land at that Time on the Island, but pursued
ibme other Design.
And now they had another Broil with the three Eng-
liftmen j one of which, a most turbulent Fellow, being in
a Rage atone of the three Slaves, which I mentioned they
had taken, because the Fellow had not done something right
which he bid them do, and seem'd a little untractable in his,
showing him, drew a Hatchet out of a Frog-Belt, in which
he wore it by his Side, and fell upon the poor Savage, not
to correct him, but to kill him, One of the Spaniards*
who was by, seeing him give the Fellow a barbarous Cut
with the Hatchet, which he am'd at his Head but struck
into his Shoulder, so that he thought he had cut the poor
Creature's Arm off, ran to him, and Entreating him not
to Murder the poor Man, clapt in between him and the
Savage, to prevent the Michief.
The Fellow being enrag'd the more at this, struck at
the Spaniard with his Hatchet, and swore he would serve
him as he intended to serve the Savage j which the Spa-
ward perceiving, avoided the Blow, and with a Shovel
which he had in his Hand, (for they were working ia
the Field about their Corn-Land) knocked the Brute down:
Another of the Engliftmen running at the fame Time to
help his Comrode, knock'd the Spaniard down > and then
two Spaniards more came to help their Man, and a
third Englishman fell upon them. They had none of them
any Fire-Arms, or any other Weapons but Hatchets and
other Tools, except tnis third Engtiftman j he had one of
my old rusty Cutlashes, with which he made at the last Sparit*
ards, and wounded them both: This Fray set the whole
Family in an Uproar, and more Help coming in, they
took the three Englishmen Prisoners. The next Question
was, What should be done with them? they had been so
often mutinous, and were so furious, so desperate, and ib
idle whithal, that they knew not what Course to take
with them 5 for they were mischievous to the heighest
Degree, and valued not what Hurt they did any Man }
ib that, in short, it was not safe to live with them.
The Spaniard, who was Governour, told them in fb
^iany Words, That if they had been his own Country he
,iyould have hang'd -.them. all. 5 for all Laws and all Gover-
npurs.
nours were to preserve Society; and those who were dan-
gerous to the Society, ought to be expelPd out of it > but
as they were Englishmen, and that it was to the generous
Kindness of an Englifloman that they all ow'd their Pre-
servation and Deliverance, he would use them with all pos-
sible Lenity, and would leave them to the Judgment of
the other two Englishmen, who were their Countrymen.
One of the two honest: Englishmen stood up, and said,
they dehYd it might not be left to them ; for, fays he, I
am sure we ought to Sentence them to the Gallows > and
the three, Trad proposed to have all the five Engliflimen
join together, andMurther all the Spaniards, when they were
in their Sleep.
When the Spanijli Governour heard this, he calls to Will.
Ackins, How, Seignior Atkins, fays he, would you Mur-
ther us all? What nave you to fay to that? That hardened
Villian was so far from denying, it, that he said it was
true, and G--d d-mn him they would do it stil before they
had done with them. Well, but Seignior Atkins, fays
the Spaniard, What have we done to you, that you will
kill us? And what would you get by killing us ? And
what must we do to prevent your killing us? Must we
kill you, or you will kill us? Why will you put us to the
Necessity of this, Seignior Atkins f fays the Spaniard very
calmly, and smiling.
Seignior Atkins was in such a Rage at the Spani-
ard's making a Jest of it, that had he not been held by
three Men, and withal had no Weapons with him, it was
thought he would have attempted to have kiil'd the Spa*
niard in the middle of all the Company.
This hair-brain'd Carriage obljg'd them to consider
seriously what was to be done. The two Englishmen and
the Spaniard who sav'd the poor Savage, was of the O-
pinion, that they should hang one of the three for an Ex-
ample to the rest, and that, Particularly, it should be he that
had twice attempted to commit Murder with his Hatchet;
and indeed there was some Reason to believe he had done*
it, for the poor Savage was in such a miserable Conditi-
on with the Wound he had received, that it was thought
Us:, could not live.

But the Governour Spaniard still safes No, it was m
Englishman that had &v'd all their Lives, and he would
never Consent to put an Engliftmarijfio Death,, tho* he had-
murther'd haif of them > nay , he said, if he had been kilTd
himself by an Englishman, and had Time left to Speak, it
should be, that they should pardon him.
This was so positively insisted on by the Governour
Spaniard, that there was no gainsaying it? and as merci-
ful Councils are most apt to prevail where they are so
earnestly pressed* so they all came into it 5 but then it was to
be considers, what should be done to keep them from doing,
the Mischief they design'djfor all agreed, Governour and a£
that Means were to be used for preserving the Society
from Danger 5 after a long Debate it was agreed, First,.
That they should be disarm'd, and not permitted to have
either Gun* or Powder, or Shot, or Sword, or any Wea-
pon* and should be turn'd out of the Society, and left to
five where they would, and how they would by them-
Mves £ but that none of the rest, either Sprniards or Eng~
should! converse with them, speak with them, or have
ittf TMng to do with them > that they should be forbid
to come 'within a eertain Distance of the Place where the
jest dwelt j and that if they offer'd to commit any Disor-
der, so as to spoils burn, kill, or destroy any of the Corn,.
FfentihgSr. Buildings,. Fences, or Cattle belonging to the So-
ciety, that they should die without Mercy, and they should
0ioot them where-ever they could find them.
The Governour, a Man of great Humanity, musing
upon the Sentence, considered a little upon it, and turning
to the two honest Englishmen slid, Hold you must reflect,
that it will be long e'er they can raise Corn and Cattle of
their own. and they must not starve; We must therefore
allow them Provisions, so he caus'd to be added. That they
Ihould have a Proportion of Corn given them to last them
tight Months, and for Seed to sow, by which Time they
might be soppos'd to raise some of their own-,- that they
should have six Milch-Goats, four He-Goats, and six Kids
given them, as well for present Subsistence, as for a Store;
and that they should have Tools given them for their Work
in the Fields&ch as, six Hatchets, an Ax, a Saw, and the
like: But they should have none of these Tools or Piovi-
4Lons3 unleis thej would swear solemnly, that they would
not
not* hurt or injure any of the Spaniards with them, or of
their Fellow 'EngVijlomm.
Thus they dismiss^ them the Society, and turn'd them
out to shift for themselves. They went away sullen and
refractory, as neither contented to go away, or to stay $
but, as there was no Remedy, they went, pretending to
go and chuse a Place where they would settle them-
selves to plant and live by themselves; and some Pro-
visions were given them, but no Weapons,
About four or five Days after, they came again for
some Victuals, and gave the Goveriiour an Account where
they had pitched their Tents, and mark'd themselves out
an Habitation and Plantation; and it was a very conveni-
ent Place indeed, on the remotest Part of the Island, N. E.
much about the Place where I providentially landed in my
first Voyage, when I was driven out to Sea, the Lord
alone knows whether, in my foolish Attempt to surround
the Island.
Here they built themselves two handsome Hu% and
contrived them, in a Manner, like my first Habitation,
being close under the Side of a Hill, having some Trees
growing already on the three Sides of it, so that by plant-
ing others, it would be very easily covev'd from the Sight,
unless narrowly search'd for; they deftVd somedry'd Goats-
skins for Beds and Covering, which were given them >
and upon giving their Words, that they would not disturb
the rest, or injure any of their Plantations, they gave them
Hatchets, and what other Tools they could spare; some
Peas, Barley, and Rice, for sowing, and, in a Word, any
Thing they wanted, but Arms and Ammunition.
They liv'din this seperate Condition about fix Months*'
and had gotten in theit first Harvest, tho' the Quantity Was
but small, the Parcel of Land they had phnre3 being hut
little j for indeed, having all their Plantation to form, they
had a great deal of Work upon their Hands'; and when
they came to make Boards, and Pots, and such Tilings
they were quite out of their Element, and could make
nothing of it; and when the rainy Season came on, for
want of a Cave in the: Earth, they could not keep their
Grain dry, and it was in great Danger of spoiling: And
this humbled them much; so they came and beeg'd the
Spaniards to help them, which they very readily did j and
5i four Days work'd a great Hole in the Sicfe of trte- HUt
for them, big enough to kcure their Corn, and other Things
from the Rain; but it was but a poor Place, at best, com-
pared to mine; and especially as mine was then, for the
Spaniards had greatly enlarg'd it, and made several new
Apai tments in it..
A bout three Quarters of a Year after this Separati-
on, a new Frolick took these Rogues,.which, together with
the former Viflany they had committed, brought Mischief
fiiough.. upon them, and had very near been the Ruin of
the whole Colony: The three newSociates began, it seems
to be weary of the. laborious Life they led, and that
without Hope of bettering their Circumstances; and a
Whin) took them, that they would make a Voyage to the
Continent rrom whence the Savages came, and would
try if they could not seize upon some Prisoners among the
Natives there,, and bring them Home, so to make them
do the laloribus Part of their Work for them,

j*a-fartKet r but they did nothing, and propos'd nothing,
bq&hajj.either Mischief in the Design, or Mischief in the
EyssitAnd if I may give my Opinion, they seem'd to
under a Blast from Heaven; for if we will.not allow
'vtwdir * Curse to pursue visible Crimes, how stall we rer
«^<yie the Events of Things with the Divine Justice ? It
oertafaly art apparent vengeance oa their Crime of
Mutiny and. Piracy, that brought them to the Slate they were

dime,-, but added new Villanies- to it, such as, particular-
ly, that Piece of mostrous Cruelty of wounding a poor
Slave,.because he did not, or perhaps could not, understand
to do what he. was directed; and to wound him in such
a Manner, as, no Question, made him a Cripple all his Life-;
and in a^ Place where no Surgeon or Medicine could be

rous Intent, Qr, to do Justice.to the Crimc>,the intentio-
nal Murther, for iuchi to be sure it was, as was after-
v;ards.the fornYd Design they all laid, to murder the Sp%-
njardiii]i Col& Blood',,and in their Sleep;,
But I fear/e observing, and return, to the Story: The
three Fellows came down to the Spaniards one Morning,
ist very kuiubte. Tei S5$ desir'd. to be, admitted to speak.
with.
with them: The Spaniards very readily heard what they
had to fay, which was this, That they were tir'd of li-
ving in the Manner they did ; that they were not handy
enough to make the Necesiaries they wanted j and that
having no Help,, they found they should be starv'd: But
if the Sponiards would give them Leave to take one
of the Canoes which they came over in, and give them
Arms and Ammunition, proportioned for their Defence,
they would go over to the Main, and seek their Fortune,
and so deliver them from the Trouble of supplying them
with any other Provisions.
The Spaniards were glad enough to be rid of them,
but yet very honestly represented to them the certain De-
struction they wTere running into j told them, they had
suffer M such Hardships upon that very Spot, that they
could, without any Spirit of Prophesy, ttll them, that
they would be starv'd, or murther'd, and bad them con-
sider of it.
The Men reply'd audaciously, they should be starved if
they stay'd here, for they could not work, and would not.
work j and they could but be starv'd Abroad, and if
they were murther'd, there was an End of them, they had
no Wives or Chileren to cry after them; and in short,
insisted importunately upon tjieir Demand, declaring, that
they would go, whether they would give them any Arms
or no,
The Spaniards told them, with great Kindness, that if
they were resolvM to go, they should not go like naked
Men, and be in no Condition to defend themselves $ and that-
though they could ill spare their Fire-Arms, having not
enough for them Hives, yet they would let them have two
Muskets, a Pistol, and a Cutlalh, and each Man a Hatchet,,
which they thought was sufficient for them.
In a Word, they accepted the Offer, and having baked
them.Bread enough to.serve them a Month, and given them
as much Goats-Flesh as they could eat while it was sweets,
and a great Basket full of dry'd Grapes, a Pot full of ficih
Water, and a young Kid alivre to kill, they boldly let out
in a Canoe for a Voyage over the Sea, where it was al-
least 40 Miles broad.
The Boat was indeed a large one, and would have-
very welLcarry'd fifteen .ox twenty Men 5 and,. therefore,
c 6i y
was rather too big for them to manage: But as they had
a fair Breeze, and the Flood-Tide with them, they did
well enough: They had made a Mast of a long Pole, and
a Sail of four large Goat-skins dry'd, which they had ibw'd
or lac'd together: and away they went merrily enough >
the Spaniards call'd after them, Bon Veyajo j and no Man
ever thought of feeing them any more.
The Spaniards would often fay one to another, and
the two honest Englishmen who remain'd behind, how
quietly and comfortably they hVd now those three tur-
bulent Fellows were gone j as for their ever coming again,
that was the remotest Thing from their Thoughts that
could be imagin'd; when behold, after two and twenty
Days Absence, one of the Englishmen being abroad upon his
Planting-Work, sees three strange Men coming toward him
at a Distance, two of them with Guns upon their Shoulders.
Away runs the Englrflrman, as if he was bewitched,
and came frighted and amaz/d to the Governour Spaniard,
and tells him they were all-undone, for there were Strangers
landen upon the Island, he could not tell who : The Spa-
niard, pausing a while, says to him, How do you mean,,
you cannot tell who ? They are the Savages to be sure;
No, no, fays the Englifliman, they are Men in Cloaths
with Arms: Nay, then, fays the Spaniards why are you
concern'd ? If they are not Savages they must be Friends*
for there is no Christian Nation upon Earth but will do
us Good rather than Harm.
While they* were debating thus, comes the three Eng-
lishmen, and standing without the Wood, which was new
planted, hallo'd to them; they presently knew their Voiees,
and fb all the wonder of that kind ceas'd. But now the
Admiration was turn'd upon another Question, (viz) what
could be the Matter, and what made them come back
.again?
I t was not long before they brought the Men in, and
enquiring where they had been, and what they had been
doing, they gave them a full Account of their Voyage in
a few Words, (viz,) That they reach'd the Land in two
Days, or something less, but finding the People alarm'd at
their coming, and preparing with Bows and Arrows to-
right them, they durst not go on Shore, but lail'd on to the
Korthwaid fix or sevea Hours, till they came to a great
Opening,
opening, by which they perceiv'd, that the Land they saw
from our Island was not the Main, but an Island j that en-
tring that Opening of the Sea, they saw another Island on
the Right Hand. North, and several more West 5 and being
refblv'd to land ibmewherer they put over to one of the
Islands which lay West, and went boldly on Shore; that
they found the People very courteous and friendly to them,
and they gave them several Roots and ibme dry'd Fish,
and appear'd very sociable y and the Women, as well as the
Men, were very forward to supply them with any thing
they could get tor them to eat, and brought it to them a
great Way upon their Heads.
They continued here four Days, and enquir'd, as well
as they could of them, by Signs, what Nations were this
Way, and that Way and were told of leveral fierce and
terrible People that kVd almost every Way who, as they
made known by Signs to them, used to eat Men j but as
for themselves, they said that they never eat Men or Wo-
men, except only inch as they took in the Wars, and
then they own'd that they made a great Feast, and eat
their Prisoners.
The Englishmen enquir'd when they had a Feast of
that Kind, and they told them two Moons ago, pointing
to the Moon, and then to two Fingers j and that their
great King had two hundred Prisoners now, which he had
taken in his War; and they were feeding them to make
them fat, for the next Feast. The Englishmen feem'd
mighty desirous to fee those Prisoners, but the other mi-
staking them, thought they were desirous to have some of
them, to carry away for their own eating. So they
beckon'd to them, pointing to the Setting of the Sun, and
then to the Rising, which was to signify, that the next
Morning at Sun-rising they would bring some for them,
and accordingly the next Morning they brought down five
Women and eleven Men, and gave them to the Englishmen*
to carry with them on their Voyage, just as we would
bring lb many Cows and Oxen down to a Sea-Port Townr
to victual a Ship.
A s brutish and barbarous as these Fellows were at home,
their Stomachs turn d at this Sight, and they did not know
what to do j to refuse the Prisoners, would have been the
highest Affront to the savage Gentry that oster'd them 4
dad
and what to do with them, they knew hot j howeveiv
upon some Debates, they resolved to accept of them, and
in Return, they gave the Savages that brought them, one
of their Hatchets, an old Key, a Knife, and six or seven
of their Bullets, which, though they did not understand,
they seem'd extreamly pleas'dwith: And then, tying the
poor Creatures Hands behind them, they ( the People )
dragg'd the Prisoners into the Boat for our Men.
The Englishmen were oblig'd to come away as soon
as they had them, or else they that gave them this noble
Present, would certainly have expected that they should
have gone to work with them, have kilTd two or three
of them the next Morning, and perhaps have Invited the
Donors to Dinner.
But having taken their Leave with all the Respects,
and Thanks that could well pass between People, where
en either Side they understood not one Word they could
fay, they put off with their Boat, and came back, towards
the first LUand i where when they arrived, they set eight of
their Prisoners at Liberty, there being too many of them
for theii Occasions.
In their Voyage, they endeavour'd to have some Com-
munication with their Prisoners, but it was impossible to
make them understand any Thing; Nothing they could
fay to them, or give them, or do for them, but waslook'd
upon as going about to murrher them : They first of all un-
bound them, but the poor Creatures skream'd at that,
especially the Women, as if they had just felt the Knife at
their Throats; for they immediately concluded, they were
unbound on Purpose to be kiJJ'd.
If they gave them any Tiling to eat, it was the fame
Thing; then they concluded it was for Fear they should
sink in Flesh, and so not be fat enough to kill: If they
look'd at one of them more particularly, the Party pre-
sently concluded, it was to fee whether he or she was saf-
est, and fittest to kill first ; Nay, after they had brought
them qui^e over, and began to uie them kindly, and treat'
them well, still they expected every Day, to. make a Din-
ner or Supper for their new Masters.
When the three Wanderers had given this unaccounta-
ble History, or Journal of their Voyage, the Sf award ask'd
them,.
them, Where their new Family was? And being told that
they had brought them on Shore, and put them into one of
their Huts, and were come up to beg some Victiials for them
they (the Spaniards) and the other two Englishmen, that is
to fay, the whole Colony, resolv'd to go all down to thfi
Place and soe them, and did so, and Friday s Father with
them.
When they came into the Hut, there they fate all
bound} for when they had brought them on Shore, they
bound their Hands that they might not take the Boat and
make their Escape > .there, I £y, they late, all of them
stark naked: First, There were three Men, lusty comely
Fellows, well-shap'd, strait and fair Limbs, about 30 to thirty
five Years of Age j. and five Women, whereof two might
be from thirty to forty, two more not above four or five
and twenty, and the fifth, a tall comely Maiden about six-
teen or seventeen: The Women were well-favoured agree-
ble Persons, both in Shape and Features, only tawny, and
two of them, had they been perfect White, would have
pa&'d for very handsome Women, even in London it self j
having very pleasant agreeable Countenances, and of a very
modest Behaviour, especially when they came afterwards
to be cloath'd, and dress'd, as they call d it, tho' that Dress
was very indifferent it must be confess:d -} of which here*
after.
The Sight, you may be fore, was something uncouth
to our Spaniards r who wo e (to give them a just Character)
Men of the best Behaviour -} of the most calm, sedate Ten>
pers, and perfect Good-humour that ever I met with >
and in particular, of the most Modesty, as will presently ap-
pear: I say, the Sight was very uncouth, to fee two naked
Men, and five naked Women, all together bound, and in the
most miserable Circumstances that human Nature could be
fcppos'd to be> viz... to be expecting every Moment to be
dragg'd out, and have their Brains knock'd out, and
then to be eaten up like a Calf that is kilPd for a
Dainty.
The first Thing they did, was to cause the old Indian^
Friday's Father, to go in and fee fir/? if he knew any
of them; and then , if he understood any of their
Speech: As soon as tire old Man came in, he look'd
sejioully at thern, but knew none of them i neither could
any
( 66) •
any of them understand a Word he said, or a Sign he couM
make, except one of the Women.
Howe ver, this was enough to answer the End, which
was to satisfy them, that the Men into whose Hands they
were fallen, were Christians; that they abhorr'd eating of
Men or Women, and that they might be sure they would
not be kill'd :. As soon as they were aflur'd of this, they
discover'd such a Joy, and by such aukward, and several
ways, as is hard to describe; for it seems they were of se-
veral Nations.
The Woman, who was their Interpreter, was bid iri
the next Place to ask them, If they were willing to be
Servants, and to work for the Men who had brought them
away, to save their Lives ? at which they all fell a Danc-
ing $ and presently one fell to taking up this, and another
that, any Thing that lay next, to carry on their Shoulders,
to intimate that they were willing to work.
The Governour, who found, that the having Women
among them would presently be attended with lbme In-
convenience, and might occasion some Strife, and perhaps
Blood j ask'd- the three Men, what they intended to do
with these Women, and how they intended to use them j
whether as Servants, or as Women? One of the Englift-
men answer'd very boldly and readily, That they would
use them as both. To which the Governour said, I am
not going to restrain you from it, you are your own
Masters as to that: But this I think is but just, for avoid-
ing Disorders and Quarrels among you 5 and I desire it of
you, for that Reason only, viz. That you will all engage,
that if any of you take any of thelc Women, as a Wo-
man or Wife, that he shall take but one j and that having
taken one, none else should touch her; for tho* we cannot
marry any of you, yet 'tis but reasonable, that while you
stay here, the Women any of you takes, st ould be mainrain'd
by the Man that takes her, and should be his Wife 5 I mean,
lays he, while he continues here, and that none else should
have any thing to do with her; All this appear'd Ib just,
that every one agreed to it without any Difficulty.
Then the EngltJJjmen ask'd the Spaniards, If they de-
signed to take any of them? But every one anlwer'd
NO: Some of them said, they had Wives in Spain, arid
and the others did not lilye Women that were not Christi-
ans j.
ans 5 and altogether declar'd, that they would not touefi
one of them 5 which was an Instance of such Virtue, us
I have not met with in all my Travels: On the other
Hand, to be short, the five Englishmen took them every
one a Wife, that is to fay, a temporary Wife and so they
set up a new Form of Living 5 for the Spaniard? and Friday's
Father Iiv'd in my old Habitation, which they hadenlarg'd ex-
ceedingly within j the three Servants which they had taken
in the late Battle of the Savages, liv'd with them 5 and
these carried on the main Part of the Colony, supplying
all the rest with Food, and assisting them in any Thing as
they could, or as they found Necessity requir'd.
But the Wonder of this Story was, how five such re*
fractory ill-matched Fellows should agree about these Wo-
men, and that two of them should not pitch: upon the
£me Woman, especially seeing two or three of them were,
without Comparison, more agreeable than the other: But
they took a good Way enough to prevent quarrelling among
themselves for they set the five Women by themselves in
one of their Huts, and they went all into the other Hut*
and drew Lots among them, who should chuse first.
H e that drew to chuse first, went away by hiniself to>
the Hut where the poor naked Creatures were, and fetchs&
out her he chose> and it was worth observing, that he
that chose first took her that was reckons the homeliest,
and the oldest of the five, which made Mirth enough
among the rest; and even the Spaniards laugh'd at it: but
the Fellow considered Better than any of them, that it was
Application and Business that they were to expect: Assistance
in, as much as any Thing else; and she prov'd the belt
Wife of all the Parcel,
W he n the poor Women saw themselves set in a Row-
thus, and fetch'd out one by one-, the Terrors of their Con-
dition return'd upon them again> and they firmly believ'd
that they were now a going to be devoured : Accordingly,
when the English Sailor came in and fetcli'd but one of
them, the rest let up a most lamentable Cry, and hung
about her, and took their Leave of her with fiich Agonies
and such A (section, as would have griev'd the hardest Heart
in the World > nor was it possible for the Englishmen to sa-
tisfy them, that they were not to be immediately mur-
thjer'd, till they fetch'd the old Man, Friday's Father* who
immediately let them know, that the five Men, who had
ferch'd them out one by one* had chosen them for their
Wives,
When they had done this, and the Fright the Women were
in was a little over, the Men went to work, and the Spa-
niards came and help'd them; and in a few Hours they had
built them every one a new Hut or Tent for their Lodging
apart; for those they had already, were crowded with their
Tools, Houshold-StufT, and Provisions: The three wicked
Ones had pitch'd farthest off, and the two honest Ones
nearer, but both on the North Shore of the Island, so that
they continued separate as before: And thus my Island was
peopled in three Places 5 and as I might fay, Three Towns
were begun to be planted.
And here 'tis very well worth observing, That as it
often happens in the World (what the wife Ends of God's
Providence are in such a Dispoiition of Things, I cannot
lay) the two honest Fellows had the two worst Wives,
and the three Reprobates, that were scarce worth hanging,
that were fit for nothing, and neither seem'd born to do
themselves Good, or any one else, had three clever, dili-
gent, careful, and ingenious Wives5 not that the mo first
were ill Wives, as to their Temper or Humour; for all the
five were most willing, quiet, passive, and subjected Crea-
tures, rather like Slaves than Wives 3 but my Meaning is,
they were not alike capable, ingenious, or industrious, or
alike cleanly and neat.
Another Observation I must make, to the Honour of
a diligent Application on one Hand, and to the Disgrace of
a slothful, negligent, idle Temper, on the other, that when
I came to the Place, and viewed the several Improvements,
Plantings, and Management of the several little Colonies;
the two Men had so far out-gone the three, that there was
no Comparison; they had- indeed both of them as much
Ground laid out for Corn as they wanted; and the Reason
was, because, according to my Rule, Nature dictated, that
it was to no Purpose to sow more Corn than they want-
ed, but the Difference of the Cultivation, of the Planting,
of the Fences, and indeed every Thing else was easy to be
seen at first Viw.
The two Men had innumerable young Trees planted
about their Huts, that when you came to the Place, no-
thing,
thing was to be seen but a Wood, and tho1 they had
twice their Plantation demolish'd, once by their own
Countrymen and once by the Enemy, as shall be shewn
in its Place j yet they had vestoi'd ail again, and every
Thing was thiiving and flourishing about them) they
had Grapes planted in Order and manag'd like a Vine-
yard, tho' they had themselves never seen any Thing of
that Kind j and by their good ordering their Vines, their
Grapes were as good again as any of the others. They
had also found themselves out a Retreat in the thicken:
Part of the Woods, where, though there was not a natu-
ral Cave, as I had found, yet they made one with incei-
fint Labour of their Hands, and where when the Mischief
which follow'd happen d, they secur'd their Wives and
Children, ib as they could never be found; they having by
sticking innumeiable Stakes and Poles of the Wood, which
as I said, grew so easily, made the Grove unpayable, except
in ome Places, where they climb'd up to get ove r the out-
side Parti and then went in by Ways of their own leaving.
A s to the three Reprobates, as I justly call them, tho*
they were much civiliz/d by their new Settlement, com-
par'd to what they were before, and were not se> quarel-
lbme, having not the fame Opportunity Yet one of the
certain Companions of a proflagate Mind never left them,
and that was their Idleness: It is true, they planted. Corn,
and made Fences •> but Solomon's Words were never better
verified than in them: I went by the Vineyard of the Sloath-
ful* and it teas all over-gronm with Thorns for when the
Spaniards came to view their Crop, they could not fee it
in some Places for Weeds; the Hedge had several Gaps
in it, where the wild Goats had gotten in, and eaten up
the Com, j perhaps, here and there, a dead Bush was
crammM in, to stop them out for the present, but it was
only shutting the Stable Door after the Steed was stoln.
Whereas, widen they look'd on the Colony of the other
two, there was jthe very Face of Industry and Success
upon all they did; there was not a Weed to be seen in all
their Corn, or a Gap in any of their Hedges j And they
on the other Hand verify d Solomon's Words in another
Place, That the diligent Hand makes rich j for every Thing
grew and thriv'd, and they had Plenty within and with-
out j they had more tame Cattle than the other, more
Utensils
Utensils and Neceftaries within Doors* and yet more
Pleasure and Diversion too.
I t it true, the Wives of the three, were very handy
and cleanly within Doors, and having learn'd the English
Ways t)f Dressing and Cooking from one of the other
Englifljmm, who, as I said, was Cook's-Mate on board
the Ship, they dress'd their Husbands Victuals very nicely
and well; whereas the other could not be brought to
understand it j but then the Husband, who, as I said, had
been Cook's-Mate, did it himself j but as for the Husbands of
the three Wives> they loiter'd about, fetch'd Turtcls Eggs,
and caught Ftfh and Birds 5 in a Word, any Thing but La-
bour, and they far'd accordingly. The Diligent liv'd well
and comfortably, and the Slothful liv'd hard and beggarly.;
and so I believe, generally speaking, it is all over the
World.
But now I come to a Scene, different from all that
had happen'd before, either to them, or to me* and the
Original of the Story was this:
Early one Morning there came on Shore five or six
Canoes of Indians* or Sa vages, call them which you please;
and there is no room to doubt that they came upon the
old Errand of feeding upon their Slaves: But that Part was
now so familiar to the Spaniards, and to our Men too,
that they did not concern themselves about it, as I did >
but having been made sensible by their Experiences, that
their only, Business was to lie conceaTd, and that if they
were not seen by any of the Savages, they would go off
again quietly when their Business was done, having as yet
not the least Notion of there being any Inhabitants in the
Island 5 I fay, having been made iensible of this, they had
nothing to do but to give Notice to all the three Planta-
tions, to keep within Doors, and not shew themselves,
only placing a Scout in a .proper Place, to give Notice
when the Boats-went off to Sea again.
This was without Doubt very right? but a Disaster
spoiPd all these Measures, and made it known among the
Savages, that there were Inhabitants there, which" was
in the End the Desolation of almost the whole Colony, aftej
[the Canoes with the Savages were gone off, the Spaniard:
peep'd abroad again, and some of them had the Ciiriositj
to go to the Place where they had been, to sec what the)
had been doing: Here, to their great Surpize, they found
three Savages left behind, and lying fast asleep upon the
Ground j it was soppos'd, they had either been so gorg*d
with their inhuman Feast, that, like Beasts, they were a*
sleep, and would not stir when the others went, or they
were wander'd into the Woods, and did not come back
in Time to be taken in,
The Spaniards were greatly furpriz'd at this Sight,
and perfectly at a Loss what to do 5 the Spaniard Gover-
nour, as it happened, was with them, and his Advice was
ask'd, but he profess'd he knew not what to do; as for
Slaves, they had enough already, and as to killing them,
they were none of them inclin'dto that: The Spaniard Go
vernour told me, they could not think of shedding inno-
cent Blood, for as to them, the poor Creatures had done no
Wrong, invaded none of their Property, and they thought
they had no just Quarrel against them, to take away their
Lives.
And here I must, in Justice to these Spaniards, ob-
serve, that let the Accounts of Sfantfo Cruelty in Mexico
and Peru, be what they will, I never met with seventeen
Men of any Nation whatsoever, 'in any Foreign Country,
who were so universally Modest, Temparate, Virtuous,
so very good Humour'd, and so Courteous as these Spa-
niards:, and as to Cruelty they had nothing of it in their
very Nature no Inhumanity, no Barbarity, no outraga-
ous Passions, and yet all of them Men of great Courage
and Spirit.
Their Temper and Calmness had appear'd, in their
bearing the uniufferable Usage of the three EnglifJjmcn;
and their Justice and Humanity appear'd now in the Case
of the Savages, as above: After some Consultation, they
resolvd upon this, that they would lie still a while longer,
'till, if possible, these three Men might be gone 5 but then
the Governour Spaniard recollected, that the three Savages
 had no Boat, and tint if they were left to rove about the
I Hand, they would certainly discover that there were In-
habitants in it, and so they should be undone that Way.
Upon this, they went back again, and there lay the
Fellows fast asleep still, so they resolv'd -to waken them,
and take them Prisoners, and they did so $ the poor Fel-
lows were strangely flighted when they were seiz/d upon
and
and bound, and afraid, like the Women, that they should
be murther'd and eaten; for it seems those People think all
the World do as they do, eating Mens Flesh j but they
were soon made easy as to that, and away they carry'd
them.
It was very happy to them that they did not carry
them Home to their Castle. I mean to my Palace under
the Hill j but they carry d them first to the Bower, where
was the chief of their Country-work, such as the keep-
ing the Goats} the planting the Corn, &c. and afterwards,
they carried them to the Habitation of the two Englist^
men.
Here they were set to work, tho* it was not much
they had for them to do: and whether it was by Negli-
gence in guarding them, or that they thought the Fel-
lows could not mend themselves, I know *not, but one
of them run away, and taking into the Woods, they could
never hear of him more, ^
They had good Reason to believe he got Home again
soon after, in some other Boats or Canoes of Savages,
who came on Shore three or four Weeks afterwards, and
who, carrying on their Revels as usual, went off again in
two Days time: This Thought terrify'd them exceed-
ingly i for they concluded, and that not without good
Cause indeed, that if this Fellow came safe Home among
his Comrades , he would certainly give them an Ac-
count that there were People in the Island, as also how
few and weak they were; for this Savage, as I observ'd
before, had never been told, and it was verry happy he
had not, how many they were, or where they liv'd; nor
had he ever seen or heard the Fire of any of their Guns,
much less had they sliewn him any of their other retir'd
Places, such as the Cave in the Valley, or the new Re-
treat which the two Englishmen had made, and the like.
The first Testimony they had that this Fellow had gi-
ven Intelligence of them, was, that about two Months-
after this, fix Canoes of Savages, with about seven, or
eight, or ten Men in a Canoe, came rowing along the
North-side of the Island, where they never used to come
before, and landed about an Hour after Sun-rise, at a con-
venient Place, about a Mile from the Habitation of the two
Ertglijhmen,whcrc this escap'd Man had been kept: As the
Spaniards
Spaniard Govefnour (aid, had they been all there, the Da*
mage would not have been fb much, for not a Man of
them would have escaped, but the Case difser'd now very
much, for two Men to fifty were too much Odds: The
two Men had the Happiness to discover them about a
League off, £o that it was above an Hour before they
landed, and as they landed about a Mile from their Hut$,
it was some time before they could come at them: Now
having great Reason to believe that they were betray'd,
the first Thing they did, was to bind the Slaves which
were left, and cause two of the three Men, who they
brought with the Women>who it seems prov'd very faithful
to them, to lead them with theirtwo Wives, and whatever
they could carry away with them, to their retir'd Place
in the Woods, which I have spoken of above, and there
to bind the two Fellows, Hand and Foot, till they heard
•farther.
I n the next Place, seeing the Savages were all come on
Shore, and that they bent their Course directly that Way,
they open'd the Fences where their Milch-Goats were
kept, and drove them all out, leaving their Goats to strag-
gle into the Wood, whither they pleas'd, that the Sava-
ges might think they were all bred wild j but the Rogue
who came with them was too cunning for that, and gave
them an Account of it all 5 for they went directly to the
Place.
When the two poor frighted Men had-secur'd their
Wives and Goods, they sent the other Slave they had of
the three, who came with the Women, and who was?
at their Place by Accident, away to the Spaniards, with
all Speed, to give them the Alarm, and desire speedy Help $
and in the mean Time they took their Arms, and what
Ammunition they had, and retreated towards the Place in
the Wood, where their Wives were sent, keeping at a
Distance, yet so that they might see, if possible, which
,way the Savages took.
T11E y had not gone far, but that, from a rising Ground
they could fee the little Army of their Enemies "come on
directly to their Habitation, and in a Moment more, could
fe all their Huts and Houihold Stuff flaming up toge-
ther, to their great Grief and Mortification; for they had
a very great Loss, and to them irretrievable, at least for ftroe
1> Timd
Time. They kept their Station for a while, 'till they
found the Savages, like wild Beasts, spread themselves all
ovct the Place, rumaging every Way, and every Place they
could think of, in search for Prey, and in particular for the
People, of whom it now plainly appears they had Intelli-
gence.
The two Englistmen feeing this, thinking themselves
not secure where they stood, because as it was likely some
of the wild People might come that Way, so they might
come too many together, thought it proper to make ano-
ther Retreat about half a Mile rarther, believing, as it af-
terwards happens, that the farther they stroll'd, the few-
er would be together.
The next Halt was at the Entrance into a very thick
grown Part of the Woods, and where an old Trunck of
a Tree stood, which was hollow and vastly large j and in
this Tree they both took their standing, resolving to see
there what might offer.
They had not stood there long, but two of the Sa-
vages appear'd running directly that Way, as if they had
already'had Notice where they stood, and were coming up to
attack them 5 and a little Way farther, they ipy'd three more
com in garter them, and five more beyond them, all coming the
lame Way besides Which, they saw seven or eight more at a
Distance, running another Way for in a Word, they ran
every Way like Sportsmen beating for their Game.
The poor Men were now in great Perplexity, whether
they should stand and keep their Posture, or fly: But af-
ter a very short Debate with themselves, they considerM,
that if the Savoges rang'd the Country thus before Help
came, they might perhaps find out their Retreat in the
Woods, and thai all would be lost j se> they reiblv'd to
stand them there j and if there were too many to deal with,
then they would get up to the Top of the Tree, from
whence they doubted not to defend themselves, Fire except-
ed, as long as their Ammunition lasted, tho' all the Sava-
ges that were landed, which was near fifty, were to at- -
tack them.
Having rcfblv'd upon this, they next consider'd, whe-
ther they should fire at the first two, or wait for the three,
and so take middle Party, by which the two and the five
that follows would be separated $ at length they risolv'd
to
to let the two first pass by, unless they should spy them
in the Tree, and come to attack them. The two first
Savages also confirm'd them in this Resolution, by turn-
ing a little from them towards another Part of the Wood;
but the three, and the five after them, came forwards di-
rectly to the Tree, as if they had known the Englifime*
were there.
Seeing them come so strait towards them, they re^
iblv'd to take them in a Line, as they came j and as the?
resolv d to fire but one at a Time, perhaps the first Shot
might hit them all three} to which Purpose, the Man
Who was to fire, put three or four Bullets into his Piec«*
tnd having a fair Loop-hole, as it were, from a broken
Hole in the Tree, he took a sure Aim, without beings
seen, waiting till they were within about thirty Yards of
the Tree, so that he could not miss.
While they were thus waiting, and the Savages
came on, they plainly saw, that one of the three was th«
Run-away Savage that had escap'd from them, and they
both knew him distinctly, and resblv'd, that if possible, h«
should not escape, tho' tney should both firej to the other
stood ready with his Piece, that if he did not drop at the
first Shot, he should be sure to have a second.
But the first was too good a Marksman to miss his
Aim j for as the Savages kept near one another, a little be-
hind in a Line; in a Word, he fiVd, and hit two of 'em
directly: The foremost was kill'd outright, being shot m
die Head: The second, which was the run-away Indian*
was shot thro' the Body, and fell, but was not quite
dead: And the third had a little Scratch in the Shoulder,
perhaps by the fame Ball that went thro* the Body of the
second, and being dreadfully frighted, tho* not much hurt,
sit down upon the Ground, skreaming and yelling in a
hideous manner.
The five that were behind, more frighted with the
Noise, than sensible of the Danger, stood still at first; for
the Woods made the Sound a Thousand Times bigger
than it really was j the Eccho's rattling from one Side to
another, and the Fowls riling from all Parts, streaming
and making, every Sort, a several kind of Noise, according,
their Kind, just as it was when I fir'd the first Gun,
D 2 tkt
that perhaps was ever shot off in that Place since it was
an Island.
However, all being silent again, and they not know-
ing what the Matter was, came on unconcern'd, till they
came to the Place where their Companions lay in a Con-
dition miseiable enough: And here the poor ignorant Crea-
tures, not sensible that they were within Reach of the
same Mischief, stood all ot a Huddle over the wounded
Man, talking, and, as may be fuppos'd, enquiring of him
how he came to be hurt j and who, 'tis very rational to
believe, told them, that a Flash of Fire first, and imme-
diately after that, Thunder from their Gods, had killed
those two, and wounded him: This I fay, is rational
for nothing is more certain than that, as they saw no Man
near them, fb they had never heard a Gun in all their Lives,
or so much as heard of a Gun j neither knew they any thing
of killing or wounding, at a Distance, with Fire and Bul-
lets -y if they had, one might reasonably believe, they would
not have stood fb unconcern'd, in viewing the Fate of
their Fellows, without some Apprehension ot their own.
Our two Men, tho* as they confefs'd to me, it grieved
5em to be cblig'd to kill fb many poor Creatures, who, at the
fame Time, had no Notion or their Danger j yet having
them all thus in their Power, and the first having loaded
his Piece again > resolved to let fly both together among
them j and singling out, by Agreement, which to aim
at, they shot together, and kill'd or very much wounded
four of them; the fifth, frighted even to Death, though
not hurt, fell with the rest j so that our Men seeing them
all fall together, thought they had kill'd them all.
T n e Belief that the Savages were aU kill'd, made our
two Men come boldly out from the Tree before they
had chavg'd their Guns again, which was a wrong Step;
and they were under some surprize when they came to the
Place, and found no less than four of the Men alive, and
of them two very little hurt, and one not at all: This
oblig'd them to fall upon them with the Stocks of their
Muskets j and first they made sure of the run-away Sa-
vage, that had been the Cause of all the Mischief, and
of mother that was hurt in his Knee, and put them out
of their Pain j then the Man that was not hurt at all*
came and kneel'd down to them, with his two Hands
held
field up, and made piteous Moan to them by Gestures and
Signs, for his Life j but could not*fay one Word to them
that they could understand.
However, they signd to him to sit down at the
Foot of a Tree thereby > and one of the Fngltfimen, with
a-Piece of Rope Twine which he had, by great Chance,
in liir Pocket, ty*d his two Feet fast together, and his
two Hands behind him, and there they left him 5 and>
with what Speed they could, made after the other two,
which were gone before, fearing they, or any more of
them, mould find the Way to their cover'd Place in the
Woods, where their Wives, and the few Goods they had
left, lay: They came once in Sight of the two Men,
but it was a great Distance j however, they had the Sa-
tisfaction to fee them cross over a Valley towards the Sea,
the quite contrary Way from that which led to their Re-
treat, which they were afraid of j and being fatisfycl with
that, they went back to the Tree, where they left their
Prisoner, who, as they fuppos'd,' was deliver d by his
Comrades; for he was gone, and the two Pieces of Rope
Yam, with which they had bound him, lay just at the
Foot of the Tree.
They were now in as great a Concern as before, nofc
knowing* what Course to take, or how near the Enemy
might be, or in what Numbers; so they resolv'd to go
away to the Place where their Wives were, to fee if all
was well Jthere, and to make them easy, who were in
Fright enough to be stire 5 for tho* the Savages were their
own Country Folk, yet they were most terribly afiaid
of them, and perhaps the more, for the Knowledge they
had of them,
When they come there, they found the Savages had
been in the Wood, and very near that Place, but had not
found it; for it was indeed inaccessible, by the Trees
standing £0 thick, as before, unless the Persons seeking it
had been directed by those that knew it, which these did
not; they found therefore every Thing very safe, only
the Women in a terrible fright: While they were here,
they had the Comfort of seven of the Spaniards comeing to
their Assistance; the other ten, with their Servants, and
old Friday* I mean Friday's Father were gone in a Body
t;o defend their Bower, and the Corn, and" Cattle that was
D 3 kept
fcept there, in Case the Savages should have rov'd over fb
that Side of the Country, but they did not spread so far:
"With the seven Spaniards came one of the Savages, who,
as I said, were their Prisoners formerly j and with them
aHb came the Savage, who the EngUJlimen had left bound
Hand and Foot at the Tree; for it seems they came that
Way, saw the Slaughter of the seven Men, and unbound
the eighth, and brought him along with them j where
however, they were oblig'd to bind him again, as they
had the two others, who were left when the third run
away.
T u e Prisoners began now to be a Burthen to them;
.and they were so afraid of their escaping, that they
thought they were under an absolute Necessity to kill
them, for their own Preservation: However, the Spa-
ward Governour would not consent to it, but order Jd
that they should be sent out of the Way, to my old Cave
in the Valley, and be kept there with two Spaniards to
guard them, and give them Food, which was done; and
they were bound there Hand and Foot for that Night.
When the Spaniards came, the two Englishmen [were
fb encourag'd, that they could not satisfy themselves to
flay any longer there$ but taking five of the Spaniards,
and themselves, with four Muskets and a Pistol among
them, and two /lout Quarter-Starves, away they went in
quest; of the Savages; And first they came to the Tree
where the Men lay that had been kill'd j but it was easy to
see, thatfsome more of the Savages had been there 3 for they
had attempted to carry their dead Men away, and had
dragg d two of them a good Way, but had given it over:
From thence they advane'd to the first riling Ground,
where they had stood, and seen their Camp destroyed,
and where they had the Mortification still to see some of the
Smoakj but neither could they here see any of the Savages:
They then resolvM, thoJ with all possible Caution, to go
forward towards their ruin'd Plantation: But a little before
they came thither, coming in Sight of the Sea Shore,
they law plainly the Savages all embraking again in their
Canoes, in order to be gone.
They scem'd sorry at first that there was no Way to
come at them, to give them a parting Blow: But upon
the whole, were very well satisfy'd to be rid of them.
The poor Englishmen being now twice ruin!d, and afi
their Improvements destroy'd, the rest all agreed to "come
and help them rebuild, and to assist them with needful
Supplies. Their three Countrymen, who were not yet
noted for having the least Inclination to do any Good, yet
as soon as they heard of it ( for they living remote East-
ward, knew nothing of the Matter 'till all was over J
came and offer'd their Help &nd Assistance, and did very
friendly work for several Days, to restore their Habita-
tion, and make Neceslaries for them: and thus, in a littk
Time, they were set upon their Legs again.
About two Days after this, they^had the farther Sa-
tisfaction of feeing three of the Savages Canoes corn*
driving on Shore, and at some Distance from them,
two drown'd Men -, by which they had reason to believe,
that they had met with a Storm at Sea, and had overset
some of them 5 for it had blown very hard the very Night
after they went off.
However, as some might miscarry, so on the other
Hand, enough of them efcap'd to inform the rest, as well
of what they had done, as of w^hat happen'd to them;
and to whet them on to another Enterprizeof the fame Ka-,-*
sure, which they, it seems, resolv'd to attempt, with suf-
ficient Force to carry all before them, for except what the
first Man had told them of Inhabitants, they could fay lit-
tle to it of their own Knowledge j for they never law
one Man, and the Fellow being kilPd that had afrirm'd it,
they had no other Witness to confirm it to them.
I t was rl ve or six Months after this, before they heard
any more of the Savages 5 in which Time our Men wer«
in Hopes they had either forgot their former bad Luck,
or given over the Hopes of better; when on a sudden
they were invaded with a most formidable Fleet, of no
less than eight and twenty Canoes full of Savages, arm'd
with Bows and Arrows, great Clubs, wooden Swords, and
such like Engines of War, and they brought such Num-
bers with them, that, in short, it put all our People into
the utmost Consternation.
A 5 they came on Shore in the Evening, and at the
Easter-most Side of the Island, our Men had that Night
to consult and consider what to do^ and, in the first P ace,
knowing that their being entirely conceal'd, was their onr
D4 ly
ly Safety before and would much more be so now, whilt
the Number of their Enemies was so great, they therefore
resolv'd first of all to take down the Huts which were
built for the two Engliftjmen, and drive away their Goats
to the old Cave j because they supposed the Savages would
go directly thither, as soon as it was Day, to play the old
Game over again, though they did not now land within
two Leagues of it.
I n the next Place, they drove away all the Flock of
Goats they had at the old Bower, as I calPd it, which
fcelong'd to the Spaniards; and, in ihort, left as little Ap-
pearance of Inhabitants any where as was possible j and
the next Morning early they posted themselves with all
their Force at the Plantation of the two Men, waiting
for their coming: As they guess'd, so it happens; theS
new Invaders leaving their'Canoes at the East End of the
Island, came ranging along the Shore directly tow-^ds the
Place, to the Number of two hundred and fifty, as near as
our Men could judge. Our Army was but small indeed*
but that which was worse, they had not Arms for all
their Number neither; The whole Account it seems* stoo{|
*hus; First, as to Merji,
17 Spaniards,
f Engliftmen.
j Old Friday, or Friday's Father.
3 The three Slaves taken with the Women, wife
prov'd very faithful.
3 Other Slaves who liv'd with the Spaniards,
To Arm these they had,
*5i Muskets,
jf Pistols.
3 Fowling-Pieces.
£ Muskets or Fowling-Pieces, which were taken*
by me from the mutunous Seamen, who I re*
duc'd.
%> Swords.
j Old Halberds.
To their Slaves they did not give either Musket or Fir
zee, but they had every one a Halberd, or a long Staffjike
a Quarter-Staff, with a great Spike of Iron fasten'd into each
End of it, and by his Side a Hatchet; also every one of
our Men had Hatchets: Twp of the Women could not
be prevaiPd upon, but they would come into the Fight,
and they had Bows and Arrows, which the Spaniards had
taken from the Savages, when the first Action happen'd,
which I have spoken of, where the Indians fought with
one another, and the Women had Hatchets too.
The Spaniard Governour, who I have describe so of-
ten, commanded the whole i and William Atkins; who,
tho' a dreadful Fellow for Wickedness, was a most da-
ring bold Fellow, commanded under him. The Savages
came forward like Lyons, and our Men, which was the
worst of their Fate, had no Advantage in then- Situation j
only that Will. Atkins, who now prov'd a most useful
Fellow, with six Men, was planted just behind a small
Thicket of Bushes, as an advanced Guard, with Orders to
let the first of them pass by, and then fire into the mid-
dle of them; and, as soon as he had fird, to make his Re-
treat as nimbly as he could round a Part of the Wood, and
so come in behind the Spaniards where they stood, having-
a Thicket of Trees all before them.
When the Savages came on, they run straggling about
every way in Heaps, out of all manner of Order, and Wd-
liam Atkins let about fifty of them pass by him, then fee-
ing the rest com6 in a very thick Throng, he orders three
ofhis Men to fire, having loaded their Muiquels with fix
or seven Bullets a-piece, about as big as large Pistol Bullets..
How many they kilFd or wounded, they knew not, but
the Consternation and Surprize was inexpressible among-
the Savages; they were frighted to the last Degree, to hear
such a dreadful Noife, and iec their Men kiHVC and others
hurt, but fee no Body that did hi when in the middle of
their Fright, William At tens, and his other three, let fiy
again among the thickest of them j and in less than a Mi-
nute the first three, being loaded again, gave them a third
Volley.
Had William Atkins and his Men rctir'd immediately,
as soon as they had fiYd, as they were order'd to do: or
tad the rest of the Body been at Hand to have pour'd in
D S. thein
their Shot continually, the Savages had been effectually
routed j for the Terror that was among them, came prin-
cipally from this, (viz..) That they were kill'd by the Gods
wi'h Thunder and Lightning, and could fee no Body that
hurt them -y but William Atkins staying to load again, dis-
covers the Cheat: Some of the Savages who were at a
Distance, spying them, came upon them behind, and tho*
Atkins and his Men fir'd at them also, two or three times,,
tnd kill'd above twenty, retiring as fast as they could, yet
they wounded Atkins himself, and kill'd one of his Fel-
low Englishmen with their Arrows, as they did afterwards
one Spaniard, and one of the Indian Slaves who came with
the Women; this Slave was a most gallant Fellow, and
fought most desperately, killing five of them with his
own. Hand> having no Weapon, but one of the arm'd
Staves and a Hatchet.
Our Men being thus hard laid at, Atkins wounded, and
two other Men kill d, retreated to a riling Ground in the
Wood j and the Spaniards, after firing three Vol lies upon
them retreated also j for their Number was so great, and
they were so desperate, that tho' above fifty of tfiem were
kill'd, and more than so many wounded, yet they came
• on in the Teeth of our Men, fearless of Danger, and shot
their Arrows like a Cloud 5 and it was observ'd, that their
wounded Men, who were not quite disabled, were made
outiagious by their Wounds, and fought like Madmen.
When our Men retreated, they left the Spaniard and
the JLnglifaman that were kill'd behind them > and the Sa-
vages, when they came up to them, kill d them over again
.in a wretched manner, breaking their Arms, Legs and Heads,
with their Clubs and wooden Swords, like true Savages:
But finding our Men were gone, they did not seem to
pursue them, but drew themselves up in a kind of a Ring,
which is> it seems, their Custom, and shouted twice m
Token of their Victory: After which, they had the Mor-
•lification to see several of their wounded Men fall, dying
:with the jm ere Loss of Blood.
The Spaniard Governour having drawn his little Body
ap together upon a rising Giound, Atkins, thoJ he was
wounded, would have had him march d and charg'd them
again altogether at once: But the Spaniards reply d, Seig-
nior ^ta,you fee how their wounded Men fight, let "em
alone
(sr)
alone tiU Morning; all these wounded Men will be stiff and
lore with their Wounds, and faint with the Lois of Blood;
and so we shall have the fewer to engage.
The Advice was good: But Will. Atkins reply'd mer-
rily, That's true, Seignior, and so shall I too j and that's
the Reason I would go on while I am warm. Well,
Seignior Atkins, fays the Spaniards, you have behav'd gal-
lantly, and done your Part j we will fight for you, if you
cannot come on, but I think it best to stay 'till .Morning
so they waited.
But as it was a clear Moon-light Night, and they
found the Savages in great Disorder about their dead and
wounded Men, and a great Hurry and Noise among them
where they lay, they afterwards resolv'd to fall upon them
in the Night, especially if they could came to give them
but one Volley before they were discovers: This they
had a fair Opportunity to do, for one of the two Eng-r
liftmen, in whose Quarter it was where the Fight began,
led them round between the Woods, and the Sea-tide West-
ward, and then turning short South, they came so near where
the thickest of them lay, that before they were seen or
heard, eight of them frVd in among them, and did dread-
ful Execution upon them 5 in halt a Minute mo?e, eight
others fir'd after them, pouring in rheir small Shot in such
a Quantity, that abundance were kill'd and wounded j and
all this while they were not able to fee who hurt them,
or which Way to fly.
The Spaniards chargM again with the utmost Expedi-
tion, and then divided themselves into three Bodies, and
resolv'd to fall in among them altogether: They had in
each Body eight Persons, that is to lay, 24, whereof were
11 Men, and the 2 Women, w]*o> by the Way, sought de-
sperately.
They divided the Fire-Arms equally in each Party,
and so of the Halberds and Staves: They would have had
the Women keep back, but they said they were resolv\l
to die with their Husbands, Having thus form'd their lit-
tle Army, they march'd out from among the Trees, and
came up to the Teeth of the ]£«emy, shouting and
hollowing as loud as they could 5 thp Savages stood altoge-
ther, but were .-in the utmost Confusion, hearing the Noise
of our Men {houting from three Quarters together j t hev
would
 
*ftrould have fought if they had seen us: And as soon as vfje
eame near enough to be seen, some Arrows were {hot;
and. poor ©Id- Friday was wounded, tho* not dangerously:.
But our Men gave them no Time y but running up to
them, hVd among- them three Ways, and then fell in with
the But'-ends of their Muskets, their Swords, arm'd Staves-,
and Hatchets; andlaad about them so well, that, in a Word
tsJicy fet up a, dismal Skreaming and- Howling, flying to'
j£ve their Lives, which way soever they could.
O u r Men: were- t-irU with the Execution; and kilTd
UT. mortally wounded^ in- the two Fights, about 180 of
ttem-fc rhoreffc, being frighted out of their Wits, scour'd
throj thej Woodsy, aad over the Hills, with all the Speed and
Eea.v that ni'rnbte Feet;could< help them to do j and as we
did: notr trouble- ourselves much to pursue them, they got
altogetherto, the. Sea-fide^ where they landed, and where
their" Canoes lay:-. But their Disaster was not at an End
y^t y. for it blew a terrible- Storm of Wind that Evening
fiom the. Sea-ward; so that it was impossible for them to
go, off* nay> the Storm; continuing- all Night, when the
Iftde came up, tlieir Canoes were most of them driven by
the_Surge- ot the Sea so high upon the Shore, that it re-
pair 'd: infinite Toil to get them off: and seme of them
were; even dalh'd to Pieces against the Beach, or against
. one.another..
Our- Men, thb? glad of their Victory, yet got little
Resti that Night* but having refresh'd. themselves as well
as they could, they resolv'd to march to- that Part of the
Island where-the Savages were sled, and fee what Posture
they were in. This necestarily led them over the Place
where the Fight had been, and where they found several
of the poor Creatures not quite dead, and yet past recover-
ing-Life* a Sight disagreeable enough to -generous Mindss
for a truly great Man, t!roJ oblig e! by the Law of Bat-
tle to- destroy his Enemy, takes no Delight in his Mi---
However, there was no need to- give any Orders
in this Cafe; for their own Savages, who were their
Servants* dispatches those- poor Creatures-, with their
Hatchets-.
A t length they came in View of the Place where the
£K>rc miserable Remains of. the Savages Army lay, where
there-
tsiere appear'd about an hundred still > their Posture was g&
nerally fitting upon the Ground, with their Knees up to-
wards their Mouth, and the Head put between the two
Hands, leaning down upon the Knees.
When our Men came within two Musket-Shot of
them, the Spaniard Governors order'd two Muskets to be
fir'd without Ball, to alarm them; this he did, that by their
Countenance he might know what to expect:, viz.. Whe-
ther they were still in Heart to fight, or were so heartily-
beaten, as to be dispirited and discourage and ib he might
manage accordingly.
This Stratagem took 5 for, as soon as the Savages heard
the first Gun, and law the.Flash of the second, they started
up upon their Feet in the greatest Consternation imagina-
ble; and as our Men advanc'd swiftly towards them* they
all ran skreamihg aud yawling away, with a kind of a
howling Noise, which our Men did not understand, and
had never heard before 5. and thus they ran up the Hills in-
to the Country.
A t first, our Men had much rather the Weather had.
been calm, and they had all gone away to Sea: But they
did not then consider, that this might probably have been
the Occasion of their coming again in inch Multitudes, as
not to be resisted, or, at least, to come so many., and so-
often, as would quite deiblate the Island, and starve theni: *
WilL Atkins therefore, who, notwithstanding his" Wound,
kept always with them, prov'd the best Counsellor in this
Cafe: His Advice was,, to take the Advantage that ofFer'd,
and clap in between them and their Boats,. and so deprive
them of the Capacity of ever returning any more to plague
"the Island.;
T h e y consulted long about this, and some were against
it, for, fear of making the Wretches fly to the Woods, and
live there desperatei and ib they should have them to hunt .
like wild Beasts, be afraid to stir out about their Business,
and have their Plantations continually uned, all their tame
Goats destroys, and, in -short* be redue'd to a Life of con-
tinual Distress.
WilL Atkins told them, they had better have to do with
an hundred Men, than with an hundred Nations: That as
^hey must" destroy their Boats, so they must destroy the
Men,
r C )
Men, or be all of them destroyed themselves. In a Word,
he sliew'd them the Necessity of it so plainly, that they all
came into it; so they went to work immediately with
the Boats, and getting' some dry Wood together from a
dead Tree, they try'd to set some of them on foe, but they
were so wet, that they would not burn: however, the Fire
so burn'd the upper Part, that it soon made them unfit for
swimming in the Sea as Boats. When the Indians saw
what they were about, some of them came running out
of the Woods, and coming as near as they could to our
Men, kneel'd down and cry'd, Oa, Oa, IVammokoa, and
some other Words of their Language, which none of the
others understood any thing of; but as they made pitiful
Gestures, and strange Noiies, it was easy to understand,
they beggd to have their Boats spard, and that they would
be gone, and never come there again.
But our Men were now (at is tied, that they had no Way
to preserve themselves, or to (ave their Colony, but effec-
tually to prevent any of these People from ever going home
again j depending upon this, that if ever so much as one of
them got back "into their Country to tell the Story, the
Colony was undone j so that letting them know that they
should not have any Mercy, they fell to work with their
Canoes, and destroyed them every one, that the Storm had
not destroy'd before; at the Sight of which, the Savages
rais'd a hedious Cry in the Woods, which our People heard
plain enough; after which they ran about the Island like
distracted Men j so that, in a Word, our Men did not reak
ly know at first what to do with them.
Nor did the Spaniards, with all their Prudence, conl>
der, that while they made those People thus desperate,
they ought to have kept good Guard at the same Time
upon their Plantations > for tho' it is true, they had driven
away their Cattle, and the Indians did not find out their
main Retreat, I mean my old Castle at the Hill, nor the
Cave in the Valley, yet they found out my Plantation at the
Bower ,and pull'd it all to Pieces, and all the Fences and Planting
about it 5 trode all the Corn under Foot 3 tore up the Vines
and Grapes, being just then almost ripe, and did our Men an
inestimable Damage, tho' to themselves, not one Far tiling V
worth of Service,
Tho*
T h o' our Men were able to fight them upon all Oo
casions, yet they were in no Condition to pursue them, or
hunt them up and down $ for as they were too nimble of
Foot for our Men, when they found them single, so, our
Men durst not go about single, for fear of being iurrounded
with their Numbers: The best was, they had no Weapons,
for tho' they had Bows, they had no Arrows left, nor any
Materials to make any, nor had they any edg'd Tool or
Weapon among them.
The Extremity and Distress they were reducd to was
freat, and indeed deplorable j but at the fame Time, our
len were also brought to very bad Circumstances by
them j for tho' their Retreats were preserved, yet their Pro-
vision was destroyed, and their Harvest spoiled, and what
to do, or which Way to turn themselves, they knew not:
The only Refuge they had now, was the Stock of Cattle
they had in the Valley by the Cave, and some little Com
which grew there: The three Englishmen, William At-
kins and his Comrades, were now reduc'd to two,
one of them being kill d by an Arrow which struck him
on the Side of his Head, just under the Temple, so that
he never spoke move, and it was very remarkable, that
this was the fame barbarous Fellow who cut the poor Sa-
vage Slave with Iris Hatchet, and who afterwards intend-
ed ,to have murther'd the Spaniards.
I look'd upon their Case to have been worse at this
Time, than mine was at any Time, after I first discovered
the Grains of, Barley and Rice, and got into the Method
of planting and railing my Corm, and my tame Cattle 5
for now they had, as I may fay, a hundred Wolves upon
the Island, which would devour every Thing they could
'come at, yet could very hardly be come at themselves.
The nrst Thing they concluded, when they law what
their Circumstances were, was, that they would, if posil^
ble, drive them up to the farther Part of the Island, South-
east, that if any more Savages came on Shore, they might
not find one another: Then, that they would daily hunt
and harass them, and kill as many of them as they could
come at, till they had redue'd their Number; and if they
could at last tame them and bring them to any Thing,
they would give them Corn, and teach them how to plant
and live upon their daily labour.
I n order to this, they fb follows them, and so terrify'd
them with their Guns, that in a few Days, if any of them
fired a Gun at an Indian, if he did not hit him, yet he
would tall down for Fear; and fb dreadfully frighted they
were, that they kept out of Sight farther and farther, till
at last our Men following them, and every Day almost
killing and wounding some of them, they kept up in the
Woods and hollow Places so much, that it reduc'd them to
the utmost Misery for want of Food 5 and many were af-
terwards found dead in the Woods, without any Hurt, but
mecrly starved to Death.
When our Men found this, it made their Hearts re-
lent, and Pity mov'd them j especially the Spaniard Gover-
nour, who was the most Gentleman-like generous-minded
Man that ever I met with in my Life; and he propos'd, if
possible, to take one of them alive, and bring him to un-
derstand what they meant, so far as to be able to act z\
Intel pretes and to go among them, and fee if they might be
brought to some Conditions, that might be depended up-
on, to lave then- Lives, and to do us no Spoil.
It v/ai lorn e while before any of them could be taken;
but being weak and hal- staiVd, one of them was at last
fiirpriz d and made a r 1 isoner; he was sullen at first, and
would neiiher eat nor drink, but finding himself kindly
used, and Victuals given him, and noViolence ofFer'd him,
•he at last g -ew tiadaHe, and came to himself.
They bi ought old rridad to him, who talked often
with him, and told him how kind the other would be to
them all: that they would not only lave their Lives, but
'would £!ve them a Par: of the' Island to live in, provided
they would give Satisfaction, that they would keep
in their own bounds, and not come beyond them, to in-
jure 01 prejudice others 3 and that they mould have Corn
given them, to plant and make it grow for their Bread,
and ibme P^ead given them for their present Subfi.stance 5
and old Friday Lad the Fellow go and talk with the rest of
his Countrymen, and see what they laid to it, assuring'
them, that if they did not agree immediately they should
fee all destioyU
The poor Wrefche", throughly humbled, and reduc'd
in Number to about thiity seven., dos'd with the Pioposal
at the first Offer, and begg'd to have, some Food given
them*
them upon which, twelve Spaniards, and two ~EngVifhmw
well arm'd, and three Indian Slaves, and old Friday, march-
ed to the Place where they were5 the three Indian Slaves
carried them a large Quantity of Bread, and some Rice
boiled up to Cakes, and dry'd in the Sun, and three live
Goats j and they were ordered to go to the Side of a Hill,
where they fat down, eat the Provisions, very thankfully,
and were the most faithful Fellows to their Words that
could be thought of j for except when they came to beg
Victuals and Directions, they never came out of their
Bounds; and there they lived when I came to the Island,
tad I went to fee them.
They had taught them both to plant Corn, make
Bread, breed tame Goats, and milk them they wanted no*-
thing but Wives, and they soon would have been a Na-
tion: They were confined to a Neck of Land, surround-
ed with high Rocks behind them, and lying plain towards
the Sea before them, on the South-East Corner of the
Island: They had Land enough, and it was very good and
fruitful, for they had a Piece of land about a Mile, and
half broad, three or four Mile in Length.
Our Men taught them to make wooden Spades, fiich
ts I made for my self, and gave them among them twelve
Hatchets and three or four Knives 5 and there they liv'd
the most subjected innocent Creatures, that ever were
heard of.
After this, the Colony enjoy'd a perfect Tranquility
with respect to the Savages, till I came to revisit them,
which was in about two Years: Not, but that now and
then, some Canoes of Savages came on Shore for their tri-
umphal unnatural Feasts, %but as they were of several Na-
tions, and perhaps liad never heard of those that came be-
fore, or the Reason of it, they did not make any Search
or Enquiry after their Countrymen 5 and if they had,
it would have been very hard for them to have found
. them out.
Thus, I think, I have given a full Account of all that
happened to them, to my Return* at least, that was worrit
Notice. The Indians or Savages were wonderfully civi-
Kfc'd by them, and they frequently went among them, but
forbid* on Pain of Death, any one of the Indians coming to
them,,
them, because they would not have their Settlement be-
tray'd again.
One Thing was very remarkable, viz. that they taught
the Savages to make Wicker-work, or Baskets; but they
loon out-did their Masters 5 for they made abundance of
most ingenious Tilings in Wicker-work j particularly, all
Sorts of Baskets, Sieves, Bird-Cages, Cup-boards, &c. as
also Chairs to fit on, Stools, Beds, Couches, and abundance
of other Things, being very ingenious at such Work, when
they were once put in the Way of it.
M y coming was a particular Relief to these People, be-
cause we furnish'd them with Knives, Sollars, Spades, Sho-
vels, Pick-axes, and all Tilings of that Kind which they
could want.
With the Help of these Tools they were so very han-
dy, that they came at last to build up tneir Huts, or Hou-
ses, very handsomely j raddling or working it up like Ba-
sket-work all the Way round, which was a veiy extraor-
dinary Piece of Ingenuity, and look'd very odd, but was an
exceeding good Fence, as well against Heat, as against all
Sorts of Ver mine 5 and our Men were so taken with it,
that they got the wild Savages to come and do the like for
them j so that when I came to see the two Englishmen's
Colonies, they look'd, at a Distance, as if theylivd all like
Bees, in a Hive; and as for Wilt. Atkins, who was now be-
come a very industrious, neceilary and sober Fellow, he
had made himself such a Tent of Basket-work, as I be-
lieve was never seen} it was 120 Paces round in the out-
• fide, as I measur'd by my Steps; the Walls were as close
work'd as a Basket in Panncls, or Squares of 32 in Num-
ber, and very strong, standing about seven Foot high j in
the middle was another not above 22 Paces round, but
built stronger, being Eight-square in its Form, and in the
eight Corners stood eight very strong Posts, round the top
or which he laid strong Pieces' piiin'd together with woo-
_den Pins, from which he raised a Piramid for the Roof of
eight Rafters, very handsome, I assure you, and join'd to-
gether very Well, tho' he had no Nails, and only a few
Iron-Spikes, which he had made himself top, out of the
old Iron that I had left there j and indeed this Fellow Ibew'd
abundance of Ingenuity in several Things, which, he had
UP Knowlede of j he made himself a Forge, with a Pair
©T wooden Bellows to blow the Fire; he made himself
Charcoal for his Work, and he form'd out of one of the
Iron-Crows, a middling good Anvil to hammer upon; in
this Manner he made many Things, but especially Hooks,
Staples and Spikes, Bolts and Hinges: But to return to the
House after he had pitch'd the Roof of his innermost:
Tent, he work'd it up between the Rafters with Basket-
work, so firm, and thatch'd that over again so ingenioaily
with Rice-straw, and over that a large Leaf of a Tree, whica
cover'd the Top, that his House was as dry as if it had been
til'd or slated. Indeed he own'd that the Savages made the
Basket-work for him.
The outer Circuit was cover'd, as a Lean-too, all round
this inner Apartment, and long Rafters lay from the two
and thirty Angles to the top Posts of the inner House, be-
ing about twenty Foot distant so that there was a Spac«
like & Walk, within the outer Wicker-wall, and without
the inner, near twenty Foot wide.
The inner Place he partitions off with the fame Wick-
cr-work, but much fairer, and divided it into six Apart-
ments, so that he had six Rooms on a Floor; and out of evfr-
ry one of these there was a Door, first into the Entry or
Coming into the main Tent, and another Door into the
Space or Walk that was round it; so that Walk was ajft.
divided into six equal Parts, which serv'd not only for R^
treat, but to store up any Necessaries which the Family had
occasion for. These six Spaces not taking up the whole
Circumference, what other Apartments the outer Circle
had, were thus order'd: As soon you were in at the Door
of the outer Circle, you had a ss.ort Passage strait before
you to the Door of the inner House, but on either Side
was a Wicker-Partition, and a Dcor in it, by which you
went, first, into a large Room or Store-house, twenty Foot
wide, and about thirty Foot long, and thro* that 'into an-
other not quite so long; so that in the outer Circle was
ten handsome Rooms, "six of which were only to be come
at thro* the Apartments of the inner Tent, and serv d as
Closets or retired Rooms to the respective Chambers of
the inner Circle j and four large Ware-houses or Bams, or
what you please to call them, which went in thro5 one an-
other, two on either Hand of the Passage, that led thro' the
outer Door to the inner Tent.
Such
CpO
Such a Piece of Basket-work, I believe, was- never fe&i
in the World j nor a House, or Tent, so neatly contriv'd,
much less, so built: In this great Bee-hive liv'd the three
Families, that is to fay, Will. Atkins and his Companion;
the third was kill'd, but his Wife remain'd with three
Children j for she was, it seems, big with Child when he
dy'd, and the other two were not at all backward to give
the Widow her full Share of every Thing, I mean, as to
their Corn, Milk, Grapes, &c. and when they kilTdaKid,
or found a Turtle on the Shore; so that they all liv'd well
enough, tho' it was true, they were not so industrious as
the other two, as has been observed already.
One Thing, however, cannot be omitted, viz,. That as
for Religion, I don't know that there was any Thing of
that kind among them; they pretty often indeed put one
another in Mind that there was a God, by the very com-
mon Method of Seamen, viz. Swearing by his Name:
Nor were their poor ignorant Savage Wives much the better
for having been marry'd tc^phriflians, as we must call them 5
for as they knew very little of God themselves, so they were
utterly uncapable of entring into any Discourse with their
Wives about a God, oe^io talk any thing to them concern-
ing Religion.
The utmost of all the Improvement which I can fay
*e WTives had made for them, was, that they had taught
,ncm to speak Engliflj pretty well, and ail the Children they
had, which was near 20 in all, were taught to speak Eng-
liflj too, from their first learning to speak, tho' they at first
spoke it in a very broken Manner, like their Mothers.
There were none of these Children above fix Years old
when I came thither, for it was not much above seven
Years that they had fetch'd these five Savage Ladies over,
but they had all been pretty fruitful, for they had all Chil-
dren, more or less: I think the Cook's Mate's Wife was
big of her sixth Child; and the Mothers were all a good
Sort of well-govern'd, quiet, laborious Women, modest and •
decent, helpful to one another, mighty observant and sub-
ject to their Masters, I cannot call them Husbands 5 and
wanted nothing but to be well instructed in the. Christian
Religion, and to be legally marry 5d; both which were hap-
pily brought about afterwards by my Means, or, at least,
dj the Consequence of my coming among them.
Having
 
<9i )
Having thus given an Account of the Colony in ge-
neral, and pretty much of my five Runagate Englijlmen> I
must fay something of the Spaniards, who were the main
Body or the Family; and in whose Story there are some
Incidents also remarkable enough.
I h a d a great many Discourses with them about their
Circumstances, when they were among the Savages: They
told me readily, that they had no Instances to give of their
Application or Ingenuity in that Country; that they were
a poor miserable dejected Handful of People; that if Means
had been put into their Hands, they had yet fb abandoned
themselves to Despair, and so funk under the Weight of
their Misfortunes, that they thought of nothing but Star*
ving: One of them, a grave and very sensible Man, told
me, he was convine'd they were in the wrong; that it
was not the Part of wife Men, to give up themselves to
their Misery, but always to take hold of the Helps which
Reason offer'd, as well for present Support, as for future
Deliverance: He told me, that Grief was the most senseless
insignificant Pastion in the World; for that it regarded only
Things past, which were generally impossible to be recalPd,
or to be remedy "d, but had no View to Things to come,
and had no Share in any Thing that looked like Deliverance,
but rather added to the Affliction, than proposed a Reme-
dy: And upon this, he repeated a Sfamflj Proverb; which
though I cannot repeat in just the lame Words that he
spoke it, yet I remember I made it into an Englifi Pro-
verb of my own, thus:
In Trouble to be troubFd,
Is to have your Trouble doubled,
H e ran on then, in Remarks upon all the little Improve
ments I had made in my Solitude ; my unweary'd Appli-
cation, as he called it, and how I had made a Condition,
which in its Circumstances, was at first, much worse than
theirs, a thousand Times more happy than theirs was, even
now, when they were all together: He told me, it was
remarkable, that Engllpwen had a greater Presence of Mind
in their Distress, than any People that ever he met with j
that their unhappy Nation, and the Portuguese, were the.
worst
( S>4 >
worst Men in the World to struggle with Misfortunes i for
that their first Step in Dangers, after common Efforts arc
over, was always to despair, lie down under it, and die,
without rousing their Thoughts up to proper Remedies
for Escape*
I told him, their Case and mine difler'd exceedingly, that
they were cast upon the Shove without Necessaries, with-
out Supply of Food, or of present Sustenance, 'till they
could provide : That it is true, I had this Disadvantage
and Discomfort, that I was alone; but then the Supplies I
had providentially thrown into my Hands, by the unex-
pected driving of the Ship on Shore, was sucii a Help as
would have encourag'd any Creature in the World to have
apply'd himself as I have done: Seignior, fays the Spaniard,
had we poor Spaniards been in your Case, we should ne-
ver have gotten half those Things out of the Ship as
you did : Nay fays he, we should never have found Means
to have gotten a Raft to carry them, or to have gotten a
Raft on Shore without Boat or Sail j and how much less
should we have done, said he, if any of us had been alone?
Well, I dehVd him to abate his Compliment, and go on
with the History of their coming on Shore, where they
landed j he told me, they unhappily landed at a Place where
there were People without Provisions; whereas had they
had the common Sense to have put off to Sea again, and
g6ne to another Island a little farther, they had found Pro-
visions, tho' without People , there being an Island that
Way, as they have been^told, where there was Provisions,
tho* no People; that is to fay, that the Spaniards of Tri-
nidad had frequently been there, and had rill'd the Island
with Goats and Hogs at several Times; where they have
bred in such Multitude, and where Turtle and Sea-Fowls
were in such Plenty, that they could have been in no w ant
of Flesh, tho' they had found no Bread whereas here,
they were only Aistain'd with a few Roots and Herbs,
which they understood not, and which had no Substance
in them, and which the Inhabitants gave them sparingly
enough, and who could treat them no better, unless they
would turn Canibals, and eat Mens Flesh, which was the
great Dainty of their Country.
They gave me an Account how many Ways thev
ftrove to civilize the Savages they were with, and to teach
theu>
as
them rational Customs in the ordinary Way of Living, but
in vain j and how they' retorted it upon them, as unjust, -
that they who came there for Assistance and Support, should
attempt to set up for Instructors of those that gave them
Bread; intimating, it seems, that none should set up for
the Instructors of others, but those who could live with-
out them.
They gave me dismal Accounts of the Extremities
they were driven to j how sometimes they were many
Days without any Food at all j the Wand they were upon
being inhabited by a Sort of Savages that lived more indo-
lent, and for that Reason were less supplied with the Ne-
cessaries of Life, than they had Reason to believe others
were in the fame Part of the World; and yet they found,
that these Savages were less ravenous and voracious, than those
who had better Supplies of Food.
Also they added, That they could not but see with
what Demonstrations of WifHom and Goodness the gover-
ning Providence of God directs the Event of Things in
the World i* which, they said, appears in their Circum-
stance for if presied by the Hardships they were under,
and the Barrenness of the Country where they were, they
had search'd after a better Place to live in 5 they had then
been out of the Way of the Relief that happened to them
by my Means.
Then they gave me an Account, how the Savages, who*
they hVd among, expected them to go out with them in-
to their Wars i And it was true, that, as they had Fire-
Arms with them, had they not had the Disaster to lose
their Ammunition, }hey should not have been serviceable
only'to their Friends, but have made themselves terrible
both to Friends and Enemies; but being without Powder
and Shot, and yet in a Condition, that they could not in
Reason deny to go out with their Landlords to their Wars 5
when they came into the Field of Battle, they w*re in a
worse Condition than the Savages themselves ; for they
• neither had Bows nor Arrows, nor could they use those
the Savages gave them so that they could do nothing but
stand still, and be wounded with Arrows, till they came up to
the Teeth of their Enemy ; and then indeed the three Hal-
bards they had, were of Use to them * and they would of-
ten drive a whole little Army before them, with those
 
fialbards and sharpned Sticks put into the Muzzles of thctr
Muskets : But that for all this they were sometimes
surrounded with Multitudes, and in great Danger from
their Arrows $ till at last they found the Way to make
themselves large Targets of Wood, which they covered
with Skins of wild Beasts, whose Names they knew not;
and these covered them from the Arrows of the Savages ->
that notwithstanding these, they were sometimes in great
Danger, and were once five of them knock'd down toge-
ther with the Clubs of the Savages, which was the Time
when one of Jem was taken Prisoner 5 that is to fay, -the
Spaniard, whom I had relieved: That at first they thought
had been killed, But when afterwards they heard he was
taken Prisoner, they were under the greatest Grief ima-
ginable, and would willingly have all ventur'd their Lives
to have rescued him.
They told me, That when they were so knock'd down,
the rest of their Company rescu'd them, and stood over
them, fighting till they were come to themselves, all but
him who they thought had been dead j and then they made
their Way with their Halbards and Pieces, standing close
together in a Line, thro' a Body of above a thousand Sa-
vages, beating down all that came in their Way, got the
Victory over their Enemies, but to their great Sorrow, be-
cause it was with the loss of their Friend who, the other
Party rinding him alive, carry'd off with some others, as I
gave an Account in my former,
They describ'd most affectionately, how they were
surpriz'd with Joy at the Return of their Friend and Com-
panion in Misery, who they thought load been devour'd
by wild Beasts of the worst Kind, (viz.,^ by wild Men j
and yet how more and more they were lurpriz'd with the
Account he gave them of his;Errand, and that there was
a Christian in any Place, near* much, more one that was
able, and had Humanity enough to contribute to their De-
liverance.
They describ'd how they were astoniuVd at the ^Ight
of the Relief I sent them, and at the Appearance of Loaves
pf Bread, Things they had not seen lince their coming to
that miserable Place 3 how often they croued it, and bkfled
it as Bread sent* from Heaven j and what a reviving Cor*
dial it was to their Spirits to taste it j as also of the other
Things
Things I had sent for their Supply. And after all, they would
have told me something of the Joy they were in, at the
Sight of a Boat and Pilots to carry them away to the Person
and Place from whence all these new Comforts came j but
they told me it was impossible to express it by Words, for
their excessive Joy, naturally driving them to unbecoming
Extravagancies, they had no Way to describe them, but by
telling me that they bordered upon Lunacy, having no
Way to give Vent to their Passion, suitable to the Sense
that was upon them; that in f. some it worked one Way,
and m some another ; and that some of them, thro* a Sur-
prize of Joy, would burst: out into Tears 5 others be half
mad, ancs others immediately faint, This Discourse ex-
treamly affected me, and call'd to my mind Friday's Ex-
tacy, when he met his Father, and the poor People's Ex-
tacy, when I took them up at Sea, after their Ship was
on fire: The Mate of the Ship's Joy, when he found him-
self delivered in the Place where he expected to perish 5
and my own Joy when after 28 Years Captivity, I round •
a good Ship ready to carry me to my own Country: All
these Things made me more sensible of the Relation of
those poor Men., and more affected with it.
Having thus given a View of the State of Things,
as I found them, I must relate the Heads of what I
did for these People, and the Condition in which I left
them. It was their Opinion and mine too, that they
would be troubled no more with the Savages \ or that if
they were, they would be able to cut them off, if they
were twice as many as before; so they had no Concern a^
bout that: Then I entred into a serious Discourse with
the Spaniard whom I call'd Governour, about their Stay in
the Iiland j for as I was not come to carry any of them
off, so it would not be just to carry off some, and leave
others, who perhaps would be unwilling to stay, if their
Strength was diminished.
# O n the other Hand, I told them, I came to establish
them there, not to remove them j and then I let them
know, that I had brought witfr me Relief of sundry Kinds
for them \ That I had been at a great Charge to supply them,
with all Things necessary, as well for their Convenience,
as their Defence j and that I had such and such particular
Persons with me, as well to (increase and recruit their
E Number,
Number, as by the particular neceslary Employments which
they were bred to, being Artificers, to assist them in those
Things, in which, at present, they were to seek.
They were altogether when I taik/d thus to them;
and before I delivered to 'em the Stores I had brought, I ask'd
them one by one Jf they had entirely forgot,and bury'd the first
'Animosities i-hat had been among therm and could shake hands
with one another, and engage in a strict Friendship and Union
of Interest, that sp there might be no more Misunderstandings
or Jealousies.
William Atkins, with abundance of Frankness and good
Humour, said, They had met with Afflictions enough to
make them all sober, and Enemies enough to make them
all Friends j that for his Part he would live and die
with them; and was so far from designing any Thing
against the Spaniards, that he own'd they had done nothing
to him, but what his own mad Humour.made necessary*
and what he would have done, and perhaps much worse
in their Case j and that he would ask them Faidon, if I
desired it, for the foolish and brutish Things he had done
to them j and was very willing and desirous of living in
Terms of entire Friendship and Union with them -y and
would do any Thing that lay in his Power to convince
them of it $ and as for going to England, he car'd not if
he did not go thither these twenty Years.
The Spaniards {aid, They had indeed at first disarm 5d
and excluded WilL Atkins and his two Countrymen for
their ill Conduct, as they had let me know 5 and they ap-
peals to me. for the Necessity they were under to do so:
But that William Atkins had behav'd himself so bravely in
the gicat Fight they had with the Savage?, and on several
Occasions since ,• and had skew'd himself so faithfulto,and con-
cerns for, the genei al Interest of them all, that they had
so? gotten all that was past, and thought he merited as much
to vbe trusted with Aims, and supply'd with Necessaries
as any of them > find that they had testify'd their Satis-
faction in him, by committing the Command to him, •
next to the/Goverpour himself; And as they had an entire
Confidence -in Mm and all his Countrymen, ib they ac-
know Iedge'd they had merited that Confidence by all the
Methods that honest Men could merit to be valued, and
trusted; and they most heartily embrae'd the Occasi-
on
on of giving me this Assurance* that they would never
have any Interest seperate from one another.
Upon these frank and open Declarations of Friend-
fhip, we appointed the next Day to dine all together; and
indeed we made a splendid Feast ; I caused the Ship's Cook
and his Mate to come on Shore, and dress our Dinner j
and  the old Cook's Mate we had on Shore, assist-
ed: We brought on Shore six Pieces of good Beef, and
four Pieces of Pork out of the Ship's Provision, with our
Punch-Bowl, and Materials to sill it; and in particular, I
gave them ten Bottles of French Claret, and ten Bottles of
Englifc Beer; Things that neither the Spaniards, or the
Engfiflmen had tasted tor many Years; and which, it may
be supposed, theywere exceeding glad of.
The Spaniards added to our Feast five whole Kids,
which the Cooks roasted; and three of them were sent
cover'd up close, on Board the Ship, to the-Seamen, that
they might Feast on fresh Meat from on .Shore, as we did
with their Salt Meat from on Board.
After this Feast, at which we were very innocently
merry, I brought out my Cargo of Goods, wherein, that
there might be no Dispute about dividing, I shew'd them
there was sufficient for them all 5 and desir'd that they might
all take an equal Quantity of the Goods that were for
wearing j that is to fay, equal when made up ,• as first, I
distributed Linnen sufficient to make every one of them
four Shirts; and at the Spaniards Request afterwards, made
them up fix 5 these were exceeding comfortable to them,
having been what, as I may fay, they had long since for-
got the Use of, or what it was to wear them.
I allotted the thin Englifl) Stuffs, which I mention'd be-
fore, to make every one a light Coat, like a Frock, which
I judged fittest for the Heat of the Season; cool and loose,
and orders, that whenever they decayed, they should
make more, as they thought fit: The like for Pumps, Shoes,
Stockings and Hats, &c%
I cannot express what Pleasure, what Satisfaction, fat
upon the Countenances of all these poor Men, when they
saw the Care I had taken of them, and how well I had
furnistYd them * they told me, I was a Father to then!, and
that havine such a Correspondent as I was, in ib remote
a Part of the World, it would make them forget that they
E x were
were left in a desolate Place; and they all voluntarily en-
gag'd to me not to leave the Place without my Consent,
Then I presented to them the People I had brought
with me, paiticukuly the Taylor, the Smith, and the two
Carpenters, all of them most necessary People; but a-
bove all, my general Artificer, than whom they could not
Name any Thing that was more useful to them j and
the Taylor, to shew his Concern for them, went to work
immediately, and, with my Leave, made them every one
a Shiit the first Thing he did 5 and which was still more,
he taught the Women, not only how to sow and stitch,
and use the Needle, but made them assist to make die
Shirts for their Husbands, and for all the rest.
As to the Carpenters, I scarce need mention, how use-
ful they were, for they took in Pieces all my clumsy, un-
handy Things, and made them clever convenient Tables,
Stools, Bed-steads, Cup-boards, Lockers, Shelves, and every
thing they wanted of that ICind.
B u t to let them fee how Nature made Artificers at
first, I carried the Carpenters to fee William Atkinis Ba-
sket-house, as I calPd it, and they both own'd they never
saw an Instance of such natural Ingenuity before \ nor any
Thing so regular, and so handily built, at least of its Kind:
And one of them, when he saw it, after muling a good
while, turning about to me, I am sure, says he, that Man
has no need ot us, you need do nothing but give him Tools.
T h en I brought them out all my Store of Tools, and
gave every Man a Digging Spade, a Shovel, and a Rake,
for we had no Harrows or Plows j and to every seperate
Piece, a Pick-ax, a Crow, a bioad-Ax, and a Saw 5 always
appointing, that as often as any were broken, or worn out,
they stouid be supply'd without grudging, out of the ge-
neial Stores that I left behind.
Nails, Staples, Hinges, Hammers, Chislels, Knives,
Scisliirs, and all ibrts of Tools, and Iron-work, they had
without Tale, as they requir'd, for no Man would care to
take more than they wanted, and he must be a Fool that would
wast or spoil them, on any Account whatever> and for
the Use of the Smith, I left two Ton of unwrought Iron for
a Supply.
M y Magazine of Powder and Arms, which I brought
them, was such, even to Profusion, that they could not
but
c ioi r
but rcjoyce at them, for now they could march as I used
to do, with a Musket jupon each Shoulder, if there was
Occasion, and were able to fight a Thousand Savages, if
they had but some little Advantages of Situation, which
also they could not miss of, if they had Occasion.
I carry d on Shore with me the young Man, whose
Mother was starved to Death,, and the Maid also5 she was
a sober well Educated Religious young Woman, and be-
hav'dso inoffensively* that every one gave her a good Word \
she had indeed an unhappy Life with us, there being no
Woman in the Ship but herself; but six bore it with Pa-
tience: After a while seeing Things so well order\i, and
in so fine a Way of thriving upon my Island, and consi-
dering that they had neither Business or Acquaintance in the
East-Indies, or Reason for taking so long a Voyage: I fay, con-
sidering all this, both of them came to me, and desired 1
would give them Leave to remain on the Island, and be
enter"d among my Family, as they calTd it.
I agreed to it readily, and they had, a little Plat of
Ground allotted to them, where they" had three Tents or
Houses set up, surrounded with a Basket-work, Palli&do'd likes
Atkins's, and adjoining to his Plantation: Their Tents were
contriv d, so that they had each of them a Room apart
to lodge in, and a middle Tent like a great Store-house to
lay all their Goods in, and, to eat and drink in; and now
the other two Englishmen remov'd their Habitation to the
fame Place, and so the Island was divided into three Colo-
nies and no more, iiz, the Spaniards with old Friday, and
the first Servants, at my old Habitation under the Hill;
which was; in a Word, the capital City j and where they
had so enlarg'd and extended their Works, as well undo.*
as on the outside of the Hill, that they liv'd, thos perfectly
conceal'd, yet full at large -: Never was there suca a little
City in a Wood, and so hid, I believe, hi any Part of the
World j for I verily believe, a thousand Men might have
* rang'd the Island a Month, and if they had not known theie
was such a Thing, and look'd on purpose for it, they
would not have found it; for the Trees stood so thick and
so close, and grew so fast: matte'd into one another, that
nothing but cutting them down first, could discover the
Place j except the two narrow Entrances, where they went
in and out, could be sound, which was not very easy* one
Ej of
of them was just down at the Water's Edge on the Side
of the Creek, and it was afterwards above two hundred
Yards to the Place; and the other was up the Ladder at
twice, as I have already formerly described it5 and they had
a large Wood thick planted also, on the Top of the Hill,
which contained above an Acre, which grew apace, and
cover d the Place fiom all Discovery there, with only one
narrow Place between two Trees not easy to be discovers
to enter on that Side.
The other Colony was that of Will. Atkins's, where
there were four Families of Englifomen, I mean those I had
left there, with their Wives ancl Children} three Savages
that were Slaves j the Widow and Children of the English-
man that was kill'd 5 the young Man and the Maid -> and
by the Way, we made a Wife of her also, before we went
away: There were also the two Carpenters and the Tay-
lor, who I brought with me for them j also the Smith*
who was a very neceslary Man to them, especially as %
Gunsmith, to take care of their Armsj and my other Man,
who I call'd, Jack of all Trades; who was in himself as
good, almost as twenty Men, for he was not only a very-
ingenious Fellow, but a very merry Fellow, and before I
went away, we marry'd him to the honest Maid that came,
with the Youth in the Ship, who I mention'd before.
And now I speak of Marrying, it brings me naturally
to lay something of the French Ecclesiastic that I had brought
with me out or the Ship's Crew, who I took up at Sea.
It is true, this Man was a Roman, and perhaps it may give
Offence to some hereafter, if I leave any Thing extraordinary
upon Record, of a Man, who, before I begin, I must, (to set
him out in just Colours) represent in Terms very much to his
Disadvantage, in the Account of Protestants as first, that
he was a Papist -y secondly, a Popish Priest j and thirdly, a
Trench Popish Priest.
But justice demands of me to give him a due-Charac-
ter j and I must fay, he was a grave, sober, pious, and most
religious Person; exact; in his Life, extensive in his Chari-
ty, and exemplar in almost every Thing he did \ what
then can any one fay, against my being very sensible of the
Value of such a Man, notwithstanding his Profession?
Though it may be my Opinion, perhaps, as well as the
Opinion of others, who shall read this, that he was mi-
iiaken. L The
The first Hour tliat I began to converse with him,
ter he had agreed to go with me to the East-Indie j 3 I found
Reason to delight exceedingly in his Conversation i and he
first began with me about Religion in the most obliging"
Manner imaginable.
Si r, says he, you have not only, under God, (and at
that he crofs'd his Breast) sav'd my Li fe, but you have ad-
mitted me to go this Voyage in your Ship, and by your
obliging Civility have taken me into you Family, giving
me an Opportunity of free Conversation . Now Sir, says
he, you lee by my Habit, what my Profession is, and I
gucls by your Nation what yours is: I may think it is my
Duty, and doubtless it is so, to use my utmost Endeavours,
on all Occasions, to bring all the Souls I can to the Know-
ledge of the Truth, and to embrace the Catholick Doctrine;
but as I am here under your Permission, and in your Fa-
mily, I am bound in Justice to your Kindness, as well as
in Decency and good Manners, to be under your Govern-
ment; and therefore I shall nor, without your Leave, enter
into any Debates on the Points of Religion, in which we
may not agree, farther than you shall give me Leave.
I t o l d him, his Carriage was so modest, that I could
not but acknowledge it j that it was true, we were such
People as they call'd Hereticks j but that he was not the
first Catholick that I had conversed with, without falling;
into any Inconveniencies, or carrying the Questions to any
Height in Debate; That he should not find himself the
the worse us'd for being of a different Opinion from us,
and if we did not converse without any Dislike on cither
Side upon that Score, it would be his Fault, not ours.
He reply*d, that he thought our Conversation might
be easily separated from Disputes: That it was not his Bu-
siness to cap Principles with every Man he discourse with;
and that he rather desir'd me to converse with him as a
Gentleman, than as a Religieuse,- that if I would give him
Leave at any Time to discourse upon religious Subjects,,
he would readily comply with it, and that then, he did
not doubt but I would allow him also to defend his own
Opinions, as well as he could; but that without my
Leave, he would not break in upon me with any such
Thing,
F*4 *U
Hi told me farther, that he would not ceaic to do afl
that became him in his Office, as a Priest, as well as a
private Christian, to procure the good of the Ship, and the
Safety of all that was in her -y and though peihars we
would not join with him, and he could not pi ay vritb us,
he hop'd he might pray for us, which he would do upen
all Occasions: In tJiis Manner we convers'd, and as he
was of a most obliging Gentleman-like Behaviovr ,• so he
was, if I may be allow'd to siy Ib, a Man of good Sense,
and as Fbclieve, of great Learning.
H e gave me a most diverting Account of his Life, and
of the many extraordinary Events of it of many Adven-
tures which had befallen him in the few Years that he had
been abroad in the World, and particularly this was very
remarkable, '(viz.) That during the Voyage he was now
en gag d in, he had the Misfortune to be five Times ship'd
and unship'd, and never to go to the Place whither any of
the Ships, he was in, were at first design'd: That his first
Intent was to have gone to Martinico, and that he went
on board a Ship bound thither, at St. Malo j but being
forced into Lisbon, by bad Weather, the Ship receivM some
Damage, by running a-ground in the Mouth of the River
Tagusy and was oblig'd to unload her Cargo there 5 that
finding a Portuguese Ship there bound to the Maderas, and
ready to fail, and supposing he should easily meet with
a .Vessel there bound to Martinico; he went on board, in
order to sail to the Maderas >, but the Master of the Portu-
guese Ship being but an indifferent Mariner, had been out
in his Reckoning, and they drove to F/al; where, howe-
ver he happened to find a very good Market for his Car-
go, which was Coi n, and therefore refblv'd not to go to
the Maderas, but to load Salt at the Ifle of May, and to go
away to Newfoundland; He had no Remedy in this Exi-
fence, but to go with the Ship, and had a pretty good
royage as far as the Banks, fb they call the Place where
they catch the Fish, where meeting with a French Ship,
bound from France to fghiebeck, in the River of Canada,
and from thence to Martinico, to carry Provisions, he
thought he should have an Opportunity to compleat his
first Design: But when he came to Jduebeck, the Master of
the Ship dy'd, and the Ship proceeded no farther; so the
jaext Voyage he si ip'd himself for France, in the Ship
that-
r 105)
that Was burnt, when we took them up at Sea, and then
fhip'd them with us for the East-Indies, as I have already
said: Thus he had been disappointed in five Voyages, all,
as I may call it, in one Voyage, besides what I shall have
Occasion to mention farther of the fame Person.
But, I shall not make Digressions into other Mcns Sto-
ries, which have no Relation to my own. I return to
what concerns our Affair in the Island: He came to me
one Morning, for he lodg'd among us, all the while we
were upon the Island j and it happen d to be just: when I
was going to visit the Englishmen's Colony, at the farthest
Part of the Island; I fay, he came to me and told me,
with a very grave Countenance, that he had for two or
three Days desir'd an Opportunity of some Discourse wixh
me, which he hop'd should not be displeasing to me, because
he thought it might in some Measure correspond with my
general Design, which was the Prosperity or my new Co-
lony, and perhaps might put it, at least more than he yet
thought it was, in the Way of God's Blessing.
I look'o a little surpriz'd at the last Part of his Dis-
course, and turning a little short, How Sir ! said I, can it
be said, that we are not in the Way of God's Blessing, af-
ter such visible Assistances, and wonderful Deliverances as
we have seen here, and of which I have given you a large
Account?
I f you had pleas'd Sir, said he (with a World of Modesty,
and yet with great Readiness) to have heard me, you would
have found no room to have been displeased, much less to
think so hard of me, that I should suggest, that you have
not had wonderful Assistances and Deliverances j and I
hope, on your Behalf, chat you are in the Way of God's
Blessing, and your Design is exceeding good, and will pros-
per: But Sir, said he, tho* it were more so, than is even
possible to you, yet there may be some among you that
are not equally right in their Actions-: And you know,
that in the Story of Israel, one Achan in the Camp re-
mov'd God's Blessing from them, and turn'd his Hand so
against them, that sk and thirty of them, though not con-
ceiisdin the Crime, were the Objects of Divine Vengeance,
and bore the Weight of that Punishment".
I was sensibly touchd with his Discourse, and toil
him his Inference was so just, and the whole Design seem d
E 5 so
fb sincere, and was really so religious in its own Nature,
that I was very sorry I had interrupted him, and begg'd
him to go on; and in the mean Time, because it seem'dr
that what we had both to say, might take up some Time>
I told him, I was going to the Enghflimoris Plantations,
and ask'd him to go with me, and we might discourse of
it. by the Way: He told me, he would more willingly
wait on me thither, because there partly the Thing was
acted, which he dehr'd to ipeak to me about; so we walk'd
on, and I prels'd him to be free and plain with me, in
what he had to iay.
W h y then Sir, fays he, be pleas'd to give me Leave to.
lay down a few Propositions, as the Foundation of what I
have to fay, that we may not dife in the general Principles^
t ho> we may be of some differing Opinions in the Pi ac-
rice of Particulars. First:, Sir, tho' we differ in some of
the Doctrinal' Articles of Religion j and it is very unhappy
that it is so, especially in the Cafe before us, as I shall shew
afterwards: Yet there are some general Principles in which
we both agree, (viz.) first, That there is- a God j and* that
this God having given us some stated general Rules for our
Service and Obedience, we ought not willingly and know-
ingly to offend him either by neglecting to dowhat he
has commanded, or by doing what he has exprefly forbid-
den: And. let our different Religions be what they will*
this general Principle is readily own'd by us all,. That the
Bl'fling of God does not ordinarily follow a presumptuous
snning against his Command and every good' Christian,
will be affectionately concerned to prevent any that are un-
der his Care, living in a rotas Neglect of God and his
Com mm and s.. It is not your Men being Pro!*fiantst what-
ever my Opinion may be of such; that discharges me from
being concerns! for their Souls, and from endeavouring, if
it lies befoi e me,, that they mould live in as. little Distance-
from and Enmity with their Maker, as possible espe-
cially, if you give me Leave to meddle so far in your Cir-
cuit.
I -co-u l d not yet imagine what he aim*d at, and told
him, I g! anted all he had said, and chank'd him, that he^
v;ould so far concern himself for us,- and tegg'd he would'
t-pbin the Particulars of wliat he had observ'd, that like
Josh***
Joshua, to take his own Parable, I might put away the
accuried Thing from us.
Why then, Sir, fays he, I will take the Liberty you
give me j and there are three Things, which, if I amrightv
must stand in the Way of God's Blessing upon your En-
deavours here, and which I should rejoice for your Sake,
and their own, to lee remov'd. And, Sir, fays he, I pro^
mife myieif, that you will fully agree with me in them
all, as soon as I name them; especially, because I shall con-
vince you, that every one of them may, with great Eaie^
and very much to your Satisfiction, be remedy'd.
H e gave me no Leave to put in any more Civilities^
but went on. Firs, Sir, fays he, you have here four 'Eng-
ilfhmen, who have fetch'd Women from among die Sava-
ges, and have taken them as their Wives, and have had
many Children by them all, and yet are not marry'd to
them after any stated legal Manner, as the Laws of God
and Man requires and therefore are yet, in the Scale of
both, no less than Adulterers, and living in Adultery. To>-
no Clergyman or Priest of any Kind, or of any Profession,
to perform the Ceremony; nor any Pen and Ink, or Pa-
per, or write down a Contract of Marriage, andiiave it
sgn'd between them. - And I know also, Sir, wMat the
Spaniard Governour has told you ; I mean of the Agree-
ment that heohlig'd them to make, when they took thelfi
Women, (ziz. ) That they should chuse them out by Cont
lent, and keep separately to them 5 which,, by the Way,
is nothing of a Marriage, no Agreement with the Women,
as Wives, but only an Agreement among themselves, to
keep them from quarrelling.
But, Sir, the Essence of the Sacrament of Matrimony
(so he calPd it, being a Reman) consists not only in the-
mutual Conient of the Parties to take one another, as Mm
and Wife, but in the formal and legal .Obligation, that t here
is in the Contract, to compel the Man and Womr.n at-all
Times,, to own and acknowledge each other; obliging the
Man to abstain fom all other Women, to. engage in no
other Contract while these subsist j and on all "Occasions,
as Ability allows, to provide honestly for- them and rheir
Children5 and to oblige the Woman to the fume, or like
Conditions, mktatls mutandis, on their Side.
this, Sir, fays he, I know
 
ill object j that there was
Now, Sir, says be, these Men may, when they please,
or when Occahon presents, abandon these Women, dis-
own their Children,, leave them to perish, and take other
Women, and marry them whilst these arc living. And
here he added, with some Wannth, How, Sir, is God ho-
nour d in this unlawful Liberty? And how flail a Blessing
succeed your Endeavours in this Place, However good in
themselves, and however smeere in your Design, while these
Men, who at present are your Subjects, under your abso-
lute Gover nment and Dominion, areallow'd by you to live
in open Adultery?
I confess, I was struck at the Thing it self, but
much more with the convincing Aigumcnts he supported
it with; for it was certainly true, that though they had
no Clergyman upon the Spot, yet a formal Contiact on
both Sides, made before Witnctfles, and confirm \i by any
Token, which they had all agreed to be bound by, though
it had been but die breaking a Stick between them, en-
gaging the Men to own these Women for their Wives,
upon all Occasions; and never to abandon them or their
Childien, and the Women to the fame with their Ruf-
Kands, had been an effectual lawful Marriage in the
Sight of God > and it was a great Neglect that it was not
done.
But I thought to have gotten off with my young Priest,
by telling him, that all that Part was done when I was
not here, and they had liv'd so many Years with them
now, that if it was an Adultery, it was past Remedy*
t hey could do nothing in it now.»
Sir, says he, asking your Far don for such F r E e -
d o m, you are right in this, that it being done in
your Absence, you could not be charged with that Part
of the Crime: But I beseech you, flatter not your
ihlf3 that you are not therefore under an Obligation
to do your utmost now, to put an End to it: How
can you think, but that, let the Time past lie on
who it will, all the Guilt, for the Future, will lie
entirely upon you? Because it is certainly in your
Power now to put an End to it, and in no Body's
Power bit yours.
I was so dull ili L that I did not take him right,- but I
imagined, that- by putting an End to it, he meant that I
flxuid
should part them, and not suffer them to live together any
longer: And I said to him, I could not do that by any
Means, for that it would put the whole Island into Con-
fuhon-. He seem'd surpriz'd that I should so far mistake
him. No, Sir, says foe, I do not mean, that you stould
now sepaiate them, but legally and effectually marry them
now 5 and as, Sir, my Way of marrying them may not be
so easy to reconcile them to, tho' it will be as effectual,
even by your own Laws, so your Way may be as well be-
fore God, and as valid among Men; 1 mean, by a written
Contract, fign'd by both Man and WToman, and by all the
Witnesses present, which all the Laws of Europe would de-
cree to be valid.
I was amaz/d to see so much true Piety, and so much
Sincerity of Zeal, besides the unusual Impartiality in his
Diiccuiie, as to his own Party or Church j and such a true
Warmth for the preserving People that he had no Know-
ledge of, or Relation to; I say, for preserving them from
transgressing the Laws of God 5 the like of which, I had
indeed not met with any where: But recollecting what he
had said, of marrying them by a written Contract, which
1 knew would stand too; I return d it back upon him, and
told him, I granted all that he had J&id to be just, and on
his Part very kind, that I would discourse with the Men upon
the Point now, when I came to them: And I knew no
Reason why they st:ou'd scruple to let him marry them all,
which I knew well enough would be granted to be as au-
thentick and valid in England*, as if they were marry'd by
one of our own Clergymen : What was afterwards done
in this Matter, I shall lpeak of it by it sols.
I then press'd him to tell me what was the second Com-
plaint which he had to make, acknowledging, that I was
very much his Debtor for the first, and thank d him heartk
ly for it. He told me, he wocild use the same Freedom
and Plainness in the second, and hop'd I would take it as
well: And this was, that notwithstanding these Englifo
Subjects of mine, as he caU'd them, had lived with those
Women for almost seven Years, and had taught them to
lpeak English, and even to read it; and that they were, as
he perceiv'd, Women of tolerable Understanding, andcapa-
ble of Instruction j yet they had not to this Hour taught them
any tiling of the Christian Religion 5 no, not so mueh as to
know
know that there was a God, ora Worship, or in what Man-
ner God was to be served, or that their own Idolatry, and;
w or flapping they knew not who,, was false and absurd.
This, he laid, was an unaccountable Neglect, and what r
God would certainly call them to account for, and perhaps-
at last take the Work out of their Hands:' He spoke this
very affectionately and warmlv j I am perfwaded, fays he0.
had those Men lived in the savage Country, whence their
Wives came, the Savages would nave taken more Pains to-
have brought them to be Idolaters, and to worship the De-
vil, than any of these Men, fa far as he could fee, had taken •
with them to teach .them the Knowledge or the true God:'
Now> Sir, said he> tho' I do not acknowledge your Reli-
gion, or you mine, yet we should be all glad to lee the De-
vil s Servants, and the Subjects of his Kingdom, taught to
know the general Principles of the Christian Religion that
they might, at least, hear of God, and of a Redeemer, and
of the Resurrection, and of a future State, Things 'which
we all believe j they had at least been Ib much nearer com-
ing into the Bosom of the true Church, than they are now
in the publick Profession of Idolatry, and Devil-worship.
I could hold no longer) I took him in my Arms, and
embraced him with an Excess, of Passion: How far, said I
to him, have I been from understanding the most eslential
Part of a Christian, (viz.) to love the Interest of the Chri-
stian Church, and the good of other Mens Souls? I Icarce
have known.what belongs to being-, a Christian: O, Sir,
do not, fay so, reply*d he, this Thing is not your Fault: No,
fays I, btit why did'I never lay. it to Heart as well as you? "Tis
not too late yet; said be, be not too forward to condemn
join- Iclf: But what can be done now, faid I3 you fee I
am going, away? Will-you give me Insure, said "'he, to talk
with thole poor Men about it? Yes, with all my Heart,

cy of Christ} but 'sis our Dullness to assist them, encouv «

''; Thanks
Thanks for it 5 What followed on this Account, I shaft
mention also again in i^s Place.
I now pressed him for the third Article, in which we
wci e to blame; Why really, says he, it is or the lame Na-
ture, and I will proceed, asking ymr Leave, with the feme
Plainness as before 3 it is about your poor Savages yonder,
who are, as I may say, your conquered Subjects: It is a
Maxim, Sir, that is, or ought to be received among all Chri-
stians, of what Church, or pretended Church soever, (viziy
That Christian Knowledge ought to be propagated by all -pos-
sible Means, and on all pojpble Oreasons: Tis on this Prin-
ciple that our Church fends Missionaries into Persia, India,
and China, and that our Clergy, even of the superior Sort,
willingly engage in the molt hazardous Voyages, and the-
moil dangerous Residence among Mui there:s and Barbari-
ans, to teach them the Knowledge of the true God, and to
bring them over to embiace the Christian Faith: Now,.
Sir, you have such an Oppo: tunity here, to have six or se-
ven and Thiity poor Savages brought over horn Idolatry
to the Knowledge of God, their Maker and Redeemer, that
I wonder how you can pass such an Occasion of doing Good,
which is really worth die Expence of a Man's whole Life.
I was now struck Dumb indeed, and had not one Word-
to fay: I had here a Spirit of true Christian Zeal for God
and Religion before- me, let his pa; ticular Principles be of
what kind soever as for me, I had not ib much as enter-
tain d a Thought of this in my Heart before, and I believe-
should not have thought of it; for I look'd upon these Sa-
vages as Slaves, and People, who, had we any Work for
them to do> we would ha' used as such, or would have
been glad to have transported them to any other Part of
the World for our Business was to get rid of them, and*
we would all have seen satisfy'd* if they had been sent to
any Country, so they had'never seen their own: But to the
Cafe, I say, I was confounded at his Discourse, and knew,
0 not what Answer to make him: He look'd earnestly at:
me, seeing me in some Disorder j Sir, fays he, I stall be
veiy sorry, rf, what I have said gives you any Offence:-
No, no„ jays I, I am of ended with no Body but my
self i but I am perfectly onfounded, not only to think
that I should never take any Notice of- this before, but
with reflecting what Notice, I am able ta take of it.
now 3,
now ; You know, Sir, said 7, what Circumstances I am
in, I am bound to the Eajl-Inrfies, in a Ship freighted by
Merchants, and to whom it would be an unsufferable piece
of Injustice to detain their Ship here, the Men lying all this
while at Victuals and Wages upon the Owner's Account}
It is true, I agreed to be allow'd twelve Days here, and if
I stay more, I must pay 3 /. Sterling per Diem Demorage,
nor can I stay upon Demorage above eight Days more,
and I have been here thirteen Days already, so that I am
perfectly unable to engage in this Work, unless I would
suficr my self to be left behind here again, in which Case,
if this single Ship should miscarry in any part of her Voy-
age, I should be just in the same Condition that I was left
in here at first, and from which I have been so wonder-
fully delivered.
H e own d the Cafe was very hard upon me, as to my
Voyage j but laid it home upon my Conscience, whether
the Blessing of saving seven and.thii ty Souls, was not worth
my venturing all 1 had in the World for? I was not so
sensible of that as he was, and I return'd upon him thus;
Why, Sir, it is a valuable Thing indeed, to be an Instru-
ment in God's Hand to convert seven and thirty Heathens
to the Knowledge of Chiist, but as you are an Ecclesta-
ssick, and are given over to that Work, so that it seems
naturally to fall into the Way of your Profession 5 how is
it then, that you do not rather ofter your self to undertake
it, than press me to it?
Upon this he faed about, just before me, aswewalk'd
along, and putting me to a full Stop, made me a very low
Bow $ I most heartily thank God and you, Sir, fays he,
for giving me so evident a Call to so blessed a Work 5 and
if you think your self discharge from it, and desire me
to undertake it, I will most readily do it, and think it a
happy Reward for all the Hazards and Difficulties of such
a broken, disappointed Voyage as I have met with, that I
have dr opt at last into so glorious a Work.
I discover'd a kind of Rapture in his Face while he
spoke this to me j his Eyes sparkcld like Fire, his Face
glow'd, and his Colour came and went, as if lie had been
falling into Fits; in a Word, he was fir'd with the Joy of
being embark'd in such a Work: I paus'd a considerable
while, before I could tell what to say to him, for I was
really surpriz/d to find a Man of such Sincerity and Zeal,
and carry'd out in his Zeal, beyend the ordinary Rare of
of Men, not of his Profession only, but even of any Pro-
fession whatsoever: But after I had considered it a while,
I ask'd him seriously if he was in earnest, and that he
would venture on the single Consideration of an Attempt
on those poor People, to Ire lock'd up in an implanted I-
sland for, perhaps, his Life j and at last might not know
whether he should be able to do them any good, or not?
si e tiii n d st ort upon me, and ask'd me what I call d a Ven-
ture? Pray, Sir, said'he, what do you think I consented
to go in your Ship to the East-Indies for? Nay, said I, that
I know not, unless it was to preach to the Indians: Doubt-
less it was, said he; and do you think if I can convert these
seven and thirty Men to the Faith of Christ, it is not worth
my time, tho* I fliould never be fetch'd off the Island a-
gain? Nay, is it not infinitely of more Worth to save so
many Souls, than my Life is, or the Life of twenty more
of the fame Profession? Yes, Sir, says he, I would give
Christ and the blessed Virgin Thanks all my Days, if I
could be made the tleast happy Instrument of saving the
Souls of these poor Men, tho* I was never to set my Foot
off this Island, or see my native Country any more: :Bdt
since you will honour me, fays he, "with putting me into
this Work, for which I will pray for you all the Days of my
Life i I have one humble Petition to you, sasd he, besides.
What is that, JW I.? Why, fays he, it is, that you will leave
your Man Friday with me, to be my Interpreter to them,
and to assist me j for without some Help I cannot speak
to them, or they to me.
I was sensibly troubled at his requesting Friday, because
I could not think of parting with him, and that for many
Reasons j he had been the Companion of my Travels j he
was not only faithful to me, but sincerely Affectionate to
the last degree j and I had resolv'd to do something conli-
, derable for him, if he out-liv'd me, as it was probable he
would : Then I knew that, as I had bred Friday up to be
a Protestant, it would quite confound him to bring him to
embrace another Profeflion; and he would never, while his
Eyes were open, believe that his old Master was an Here-
tick, and would be damn'd; and this might in the End
ruin the poor Fellows Principles, and ib turn him back
again to his first Idolatry. How-
However, a sudden Thought reliev'd me in this Strait,
and it was this j I told him I could not fay that I was
willing to part with Friday on any Account whatever?
tho' a Wo; k that to him was of more Value than his
Life, ought to be to me of much more Value than the
keeping or parting with a Servant: But on the other hand,
I was perswaded that Friday would by no Means consent
to part with me, and then to force him to it with-
out his Consent, would be manifest: Injustice; because I had
promised I would never put him away, and he had pro-
mis'd and engag'd to me that he would never leave me,
H e ieem'd very much concerns at it, for he had no
rational Access to these poor People, seeing he did not un-
derstand one Word of their Language, nor they one Word
of his. To remove this Difficulty, I told him Fridays Fa-
ther had learn \d SpanifJ?, which I found he also understood,
and he floould serve him for an Interpreter j so he was
much better satisfied, and nothing could perfwadc him but
he would stay to endeavour to convert them; but Provi-
dence gave another, and very happy Turn to all this.
I come back now to the first Part of his Objections^
When we came to the Englishmen, I sent for them all to-
gether, and after some Account jgiven them of what I had
done for them> viz. what necessity Things I had provid-
ed for them, and how they were distributed, which they
were sensible of, and very thankful for j I began to talk to
them of the scandalous Life they led, and gave them a full
Account of the Notice the Clergyman had already taken
of it, and arguing how unchristian and irreligious a Life it
was : I first ask'dthemif they were married Men or Batche-
lors? They soon explain'd their Condition to me, andlhew'd
me that two of them were Widowers, and the other three
were single Men, or Batchelors : I ask'd them with what
Consciences they could take these Women and lie with
them, as they had done, call them their Wives, and have
so many Children by them, and not be marry'd lawfully
to them?
They all gave me the Answer that I expected, viz.
that there was no Body to marry them j that they agreed
before the Governour to keep them as their Wives) and
to keep them and own them as their Wives,- and they
'unless I
 
thought,
thought, as Things stood with them, they were as legally
man led as if they had been mamed by a Paison, and with
all the Formalities in the Woild.
I told them, that no doubt they were married in the
Sight of God, and were bound in Conscience to keep them
as their Wives, nut that the Laws of Men being otherwise,
they might pretend they were not married, and ib desert
the poor Women and Children hereafter j and that their
Wives being poor desolate Women, friendless and money-
less, would have no Way to help themselves: I therefore
told them, that unless I was aflur'd of their honest Intent, I
could do nothing for them j but wonld take core that what
I did .should'be For the Women and their Childrdn without
them; and that unless they would give some Assurances
that they would marry the Women, I could not think it
was convenient they should continue together as Man and
Wife, for that it was both scandalous to Men, and offen-
sive to God, who they could not think would bless them, if
they went on thus.
All this went on as I expected, and they told me, e-
specially Witt. Atkins, who seem'd now to speak for the
rest, that they lov'd their Wives as well, as if they had- been
born in their own Native Country, and would not leave
them uponany Account whatever; and they did verily believer
their Wives were as viituous and as modest, and did to the
utmost of their Skill, as much for them and for their Children*
as any Women could possibly do, and they would not part
with them on any Account: And Will. Atkins for his own
particular added, if any Man would take him away, and
offer to carry him home to England, and make him Cap*
rain of the best Man of War in the Navy, he would not
go with him, if he might not carry his Wife and Children
with Mm 5 and if there was a Clergyman in the Ship, he-
would be married to her now, with all his Heart.
This was just as I would have it; the Priest was not
* with me at that Moment, but was not far off: So to try
him farther, I told him I had a Clergyman with me, and"
if he was sincere, I would have him married the next
Morning, and bid him consider of it, and talk with the rest >.
he said, as for himself, he need not consider of it at all, for
with me> and he believ'd they would be all willing also: I
he was very ready to do it, and
 
rlad I had a Minister
then
(-lid)
then told h«m, that my Friend the Minister was a Trench-
man, and could not speak Evghfl), but that I would act the
Clerk between them: He never so much as ask'd me whe-
ther he was a Papist or Protestant, which was indeed what
I was afraid of: But, I lay, they never enquired about it.
So we paired, I went back to my Clergyman, and Will,
Atkins went in to talk with his Companions: I dchVd
the Trench Gentleman not to fay any thing .to them, till
the Business was thorough ripe, and I told him what An-
swer the Men had given me.
Before I went from their Quarter, they ail came to
me, and told me, they had been considering what I had
said j that they were very glad to hear I had a Clergyman
in my Company, and they were very willing to give me
the Satisfaction I desir'd, and to be formally married as
soon as I pleas'd, for they were far fiom deliring to pare
with their Wives, and that they meant nothing out what
was very honest when they chose them •> so I appointed
them to meet me the next Morning, and that in the mean
time they mould let their Wives know the meaning of
the Marriage-Law 5 and that it was not only to prevent
any Scandal, but also to oblige them, that they should not
forsake them, whatever might happen.
The Women weie easily made sensible of the Meaning
of the Thing, and were very well satisfied with it, as, in-
deed, they had Reason to be; so they fail d not to attend
all together at my Apartment the next Morning, where I
brought out my Clergyman ; and tho' he had not on a Mi-
nister's Gown, after the Manner of England, or the Habit
of a Priest, after the Manner of France j yet having a black
Vest something like a Caslbck, with a Sash round it, he
did not look very unlike a Minister j and as for his Lan-
guage, I was his Intei pret er.
B u t the Seriousness of his Behaviour to them, and the
Scruples he made of marrying the Women, because they
were not baptize!, and profeis'd Christians, gave them an (
exceeding Reverence for his Person > and there was no need
after that to enquire whether he was a Cleigyman or no.
Indeed, I was afraid his Scruple would have been
carry'd so far, as that he would not have many'd them at
all 5 nay, notwithstanding all I was able to fay to him, he
relisted me, though modestly, yet very steadily, and at last
refused
refused absolutely to marry them, unleis he had first talk'd
with the Men, and the V. omen too j and though at first I
was a little backward to it, yet at last I agreed to it with
a good Will, perceiving the Sincerity of his Design.
When he came to them, he let them know, that I
had acarainted him with their Circumstances, and with
the preient Design : That he was very willing to perform
that Part of his Function, and marry them as I had dehYd;
but that before he could do it, he must take the Liberty
to talk with then: He told them, That in the Sight of
all indifferent Men, and in the Sense of the Laws of Socie-
ty, they had liv'd all this while in an open Adultery ; and
that it was true, that nothing but the Contenting to mar-
ry, or effectually separating them from one another now,
could put an End to it ,• but there was a Difficulty in it
too, with respect to the Laws of Christian Matrimony,
which he was not fully fatisfy'd about, viz,. That of marry-
ing one that is a profeis'd Christian, to a Savage, an Idolater,
and a Heathen, one that is not baptiz/d 5 and yet that he
did not see that there was Time left for it, to endeavour
to perstiade the Women to be baptiz/d, or to profess the
Name of Christ, whom they had, he doubted, heard no-
thing of, and without which they could not be baptiz/d.
He told them, He doubted they were but indifferent
Christians themselves that they had but little Knowledge
of God, or of his Ways: and therefore he could not ex-
pect that they had said much to their Wives on that Head
yet j but that unless they would promise him to use their
Endeavours with their Wives, to persuade them to become
Christians, and would as well as they could instruct them
in the Knowledge and Belief of God that made them, and
to worship Jesus Christ that redeem'd them, he could not
marry them 5 for he would have no Hand injoyning Chri-
stians with Savages j nor was it consistent with the Princi-
dies of the Christian Religion,- and was indeed expresty
^forbidden in God's Law.
They heard all this very attentively, and Tdeliver'd it
very faithfully to them, from his Mouth, as near his ovyn
Words as I could, only sometimes adding something of
my own to convince, them how just it was, and how I
was of his Mind and I always very faithfully distinguist/d
between what I said from my self, and what were the
Clergy-
Clergyman's Words. They told me, it was very true,
what the Gentleman had said, that they were but very in-
difFeicnt Christians themselves, and that they had never
talk d to their Wives about Religion: Lord, Sir! fays
Will. Atkins, How should we teach them Religion?
Why we know nothing our selves ; and besides, Sir, said
he, should we go to talk to them of God, and Jesus Christ,
and Heaven and Hell, 'twould be to make them laugh at
us, and ask us, What we believe our selves ? And if we
should tell them we believe all the Things that we speak
of to them, such as of good People going to Heaven, and
wicked People to the Devil, they would ask us, Where
we intended to go our selves, who believe all this, and yet are
such wicked Fellows, as we indeed are? Why, Sir, said,
Mill, 'tis enough to give them a Surfeit of Religion at
first Hearing, Folks must have some Religion themselves,
before they pretend to teach other People : Will. Atkhis,
said I to him; though I am afraid what you fay has too
much Truth in it, yet can you not tell your Wife that
she's in the wrong? That there is a God and a Religion
better than her own; that her Gods are Idols, that they
can neither hear nor speak j that there is a great Being that
made all Things, and that can defbroy all that he had made;
that he rewards the Good, and punishes the Bad; that we are
to be judg'd by him at last for all we do here : You arc
not so ignorant, but even Nature it self will teach you
that all this is true, and I am satisfy'd you know it all to
be true, and believe it your self.
That's true, Sir, said Atkins; but with what Face
can I say any thing to my Wife of all this, when she will
tell me immediately it cannot be true?
Not true ! said I, What do you mean by that? Why
Sir, said he, She will tell me it cannot be true-, rhat this
God (1 fl ail tell her of) can be just, or-can punish, or re-
ward, since I am not punish'd, and sent to the Devil, that
have been such a wicked Creature as she knows I have
been, even to her, and to every Budy else and that I
should be suffer d to live, that nave been always acting so
contrary to what I must tell her is "Good, and to what I
ought to have done,
Why, truly, Atkins, said I, I am afraid thou speak'st
too much Truth j and with that I let the Clergyman know
what
what Atkins had said, for he was impatient to know : O!
said the Priest; tell him there is one Thing will make him
the bell Minister in the World to his Wife, and that is,
Repentance; for none teach Repentance like true Penitents j
He wants nothing but to repent, and then he will be fb
much the better qualify'd to instruct his Wife; He will be
then able to tell her, that there is not only a God, and that
he is the just Rewarder of Good and Evil, but that he is
a merciful Being, and with infinite Goodness and Long-
fullering forbears to punish those that offend ; waiting to
be gracious, and willing not the Death of a Sinner, but
rather that he stiould return and live j that he oftentimes suf-
fers wicked Men to go on a long Time, and even reserves
Damnation to the general Day of Retribution $ that it is
a clear Evidence of God, and of a future State, that righte-
ous Men receive not their Reward, or wicked Men their
Punishment, till they come into another World; and this
will lead him to teach his Wife the Doctrine of the Re-
sunection, and of the last Judgment; let him but repent
for himself, he will be an excellent Preacher of Repentance
to his Wife.
I repeated all this to Athns, who look'd very serious all
the while, and who, we could easily perceive, was more
than ordinarily affected with it: When being eager, and
hardly suffering me to make an End, I knew all this, Ma-
ster, lays he, and a great deal more ; but I han't the Im-
pudence to talk thus to my Wife; when God, and my
own Conscience knows, and my Wife will be an undeni-
able Evidence against me, that I have liv'd, as if I had ne-
ver heard of a God, or a future State, or any Thing about
it ; and to talk of my repenting, ALAS! (And with that
be fetch'4 a dees Sigh; and I could fee, that Tears stood
in his Eyes;) *Tis past all that with me. Past it! AT-
KIN S, said 7, What do st thou mean by that ? I know
well enough what I mean, Sir, fays he, J mean 3th too
late, and that is too true.
 I told my Clergyman Word for Word what he (aid;
the poor zealous Priest (I must; call him fb, for, be his
Opinion what it will, he had certainly a most singular Af-
fection for che Good of other Mens Souls, and it would
be hard to think he had not the like for his own 3) I fay,
this fcealous affectionate Man, could not refrain Tears also;
But,
But, recovering himself, he sakl to me, ask him but
one Question, Is he easy that it is too late, or is he
troubled, and wishes it were not so? I put the Question
fairly to Atkms, and he ansvvered with a great deal of Pas-
sion, How could any Man be easy in a Condition that cer-
tainly must end in eternal Destruction? that he was far
from being easy, but that on the contrary, he beliey'd it
would one Time or other ruin him.
W h a t do you mean by that ? laid I, Why, lie said he
believe! he should, one Time or other, cut his ownThioat
to put an End to the Terror of it.
The Clergyman stook his Head with a great Con-
cern in his Face, when I told him all this: but turning
quick to me upon it, fays he, If that be his Cafe, you may
astiirc him, it is not too late; Christ will give him Repentance;
But pray, fays he, explain this to him, That as no Man is
fav'd but by Christ and the Merit of his Passion, procu-
ring divine Mercy for him, how can it be too late for any
Man to receive Mercy? Dees he think he is able to sin
beyond the Power or Reach of Divine Mercy ? Pray tell
him, there may be a Time when provok'd Mercy will no
longer strive, and when God may refuse to hear, but that
'tis never too late for Men to ask Mercy; and we that are
Christ's Servants are commanded to preach Mercy at all
times, in the Name of Jesus Christ* to all those that sincere-
ly repent 5 so that 'tis never too late to repent.
I told Atk'ms all this, and he heard me with §reat Earn-
estness but it icem'd as- if he turn'd off the Discourse to
the rest ^ for he said to me, he would go and have some
Talk with his Wife 5 so he went out awhile, and we t alk'd
to the rest. I pereeiv'd they were all stupidly ignorant as
to Matters of Religion j much as I was when I went
rambling away from my Father >; and: yet that there were
none ot them backward to hear, wrAt had been! {aid j and
all of them seriously promiYd that they>..would talk with
their Wives about it, and $9 their Endeavour to persuade,
them to turn Christians. y 7,
The Clergyman smiles upon me, when-I reported
what Answer they gave, but said nothing a good while j
but, at last, shaking his Head, We that are Christ's Ser-
vants, says he, can go no further than to exhort and in-
struct j and when Men comply, submit, to the* Reproof,
and
and promise what we ask, 'tis all we can do; we are
bound to accept their good Words: But believe me. Sir,
said he, whatever you may have known of the Life of
that Man you call William Atkins, I believe he is the only
sincere Convert among them > I take that Man to be a
true Penitent; I won't despair ot the rest:, but that Man is
perfectly struck with the Sense of his past Life, and I
doubt not, but when he comes to talk Religion to his
Wife, he will talk himself effectually into it ; for attempt-
ing to teach others, is sometimes the best way of teaching
our selves: I knew a Man, added he, who having nothing
but a summary Notion of Religion himself, and being
wicked and profligate to the last Degree in his Life, made
a thorough Reformation in himself, by labouring to con-
vert a J-<ra>; and if that poor Atk'ms begins but once to talk
seriously of Jesus Christ to his Wife, my Life for it, he
talks himself into a through Convert, makes himself a Pe-
nitent: And who knows what may follow?
Upon this Discourse however, and their promising,
as above, to endeavour to persuade their Wives to embrace
Christianity, he many'd the other three Couple, but Wdl
Atkins and his Wife were not yet come in: After this,
my Clergy man, waiting a while, was curious to know where
Atkins was gone ,• and, turning to me, fays he, I inti eat you*
Sir, let us walk out of your Labyrinth here, and look I dare
fay, we shall find this poor Man somewhere or other,
talking seriously to his Wife, and teaching her already some-
thing of Religion. I began to be of the same Mind j so
we went out together, and I carry'd him a Way which
none knew but my self, and where the Trees were ib
thick set, as that it was not easy-to see thro* the Thicket
of Leaves, and far harder to fee in, than to fee out; when
coming to the Edge of the Wood, I few Atkins and his
tawny Savage Wife sitting under the Shade of a Bush, ve-
ry eager in Discourse j I stop'd short till my Clergyman
came'up to me j and then having sliow'd him where they
were, we stood and look'd very steadily at them a good
while,
W F. observ'd him very earnest with her, pointing up to
the Sim, and to every Quarter of the Heavens then down
to the Earth, then out to the Sea, then to himself, then to
her, to the Woods, to the Trees $ Now, feys my Clergy-
P man a
man, you see my Words ane made good, the Man preaches
to her j mark him, now he is telling her, that our God has
made him, and her, and the Heavens,, the Earth, the Sea, the
Woods, the Trees, &t. I believe he is, said 7; immediate-
ly we perceiv'd Will Atkins start up upon his Feet, fall
down on his Knees, and lift up both his Hands: We sup-
pose he said something, but we could not hear him, it was
too far for that; he did not continue kneeling half a Minute,
Lut comes and sits down again by his Wire, and talks to
her again: We perceived then the Woman vc y attentive,
but whether she said any thing or no we could not tell,
while the poor Fellow was upon his Knees, I could fee the
Tears run plentifully down my Clergyman's Cheeks, and I
could hardly forbear my self; but it was a great* Affliction
to us bothv that we were not near enough to hear any
thing that pass'd between them.
W f. l l, however, we could come no nearer for fear of
disturbing them, so we resolv'd to see an End of this Piece
of fill Conversation, and it spoke loud enough to us, with-
out the Help of Voice: He fat down again, as I have said,
close by her; and talk'd again earnestly to her; and two or
three times we could fee him embrace her passi6natcly; an-
other time we saw him take out his Handkerchief and
wipe her Eyes, and then kiss her again, with a kind of
Transport very unusual ; and after several of these Things
we fee him, on a sudden, jump up'again and lend her his
Hand to help her up, when immediately, leading her by
the Hand a Step or two, they bothkneel'd down together,
and continu'd so about two Minutes,
My Fijend could bear it'no longer, but cries out aloud,
St. PAUL, St. P AUL! behold he frayetb} I was afraid
Atkins would hear him, therefore I eh treated him to
with-hold himself a while, that we might see an end of
the Scene, which to me, I must confess, was the most af-
fecting, and yet the most agreeable that ever I saw in mY
Li fe: Well, he strove with himself, and con tain-d: himself
for a while, but was in such Raptures of Joy, to think
that the poor Heathen Woman was become a* Chri-
stian, that he was-not able to contain himself/ he wept se-
veral Times, then throwing up his Hands and crossing'his
Breast, said over several Things'Ejaculatory and by way of
giving God Thanks for so miraculous a Testimony of the
Success
<i*3)
Success of our Endeavours some he spoke softly, and I
could not well hear; others audably, some in Latin, some
in French j then two or three times the Tears of Joy would
interrupt him, that he could not speak at all: But I beg'd
that he would compose himself, and let us more narrowly
and fully observe what was before us, which he did for a
Time, and the Scene was not ended there yet; for after
the poor Man and his Wife were risen again from their
Knees, we observ'd he stood talking still eageily to her 5
and we observ'd by her Motion, that she was greatly af-
fected with what he said, by her frequent lifting up her
Hands, laying her Hand to her Breast, and such other Pq-
stures, as usually express the greatest Seriousness and Atten-
tion: This continu'd about half a Quarter of an Hour, and
and then they walk'd away too j so that we could see no
more of them in that Situation.
I took tins Interval to talk with my Clergyman; and
first, I told him, I was glad to sec the Particulars we had
both been Witnesses to; that tho' I was hard enough of
Belief in such Cases, yet that I began to think it was all
very sincere here, both in the Man and his Wife, however
ignorant they might both be; and I hop'd such a Begin-
ning would have a yet more happy End; and who knows,
jam J, but these two may in time, by Instruction and Ex-
ample, work upon some of the others? Some of them,
laid he, turning quick upon me, ay, upon all of them j de-
pend upon it, if those two Savages, for he has been but
little better, as you relate it, should embrace Jeso§ Christ,
they will never leave till they work upon all the rest; for
true Religion is naturally communicative, and he that is
once made a Christian, will never leave a Pagan behind
him, if he can help it: I own'd it was a most Christian
Principle to think so, and a Testimony of a true Zeal, as
well as a generous Heart in him: But, my Friend, said I, will
^yoti give me Leave to start one Difficulty here? I cannot
"tell how to object the least Thing against that affectionate
Concern, which you shew for the turning the poor People
from their Paganism to the Christian Religion: But how
does this comfort you, while these People are in your Ac-
count out of the Pale of the Catholick Church, without
which you believe there is no Salvation 5 so that you esteem
F z the&
these but Hercticks still, and for other Reasons as effectually
loll as the Pagans themselves.
T o this he aniwer'd with abundance of Candor and
Christian Charity thus: Sir, I am a Catholick of the Ro-
man Church, and a Priest of the Order of St. Benedict> and
I embrace all the Principles of the Roman FaithBut yet
if you will believe me, and that I do not speak in Compli-
rnent to you, or in respeel to my Circumstances and your Ci-
vilities j I fay, nevertheless, I do not look upon you, who
-call your selves refoim'd, without some Charity: I dare
not fay, tho3 I know it is our Opinion in general; I fay, I
daie not fay that you cannot be lav'd: I will by no means
limit the Mercy of Christ so far, as to think that he can-
not receive you into the Bosom of his Church, in a man-
ner to us unperccivalle, and which it is impolhble for us
to know 5 and I hope you have the seme Charity for us; Y
pray daily for your being all restor'd to Christ's Church, by
whatsoever Methods he, who is All-wife, is picas cl to di-
rect: In the mean .time, sure you will allow it to consist
with me, as a Roman, to distinguish far hetween a Prote-
stant and a Pagan j between one that calls cn Jesus Christ,
tho' in a Way which I do not think is according to the
.true Faith: and a Savage, a Barbarian, that knows no God,
•no Christ, no Redeemer at all; and if you are not within
.the Pale of the Catholick Church, we hope you. arc nearer
being restor'd to it, thin those that know nothing at all, of
God or his Church: I rejoice therefore when I see this
poor Man, who you fay has been a Profligate, and almost
a Murtherer, kneel down and pray to Jenis Christ, as we
suppose he did, tho' not fully enlightens; believing that
God, fiom whom every such Work proceeds, will sensibly
touch his Heart, and bring him to the further Knowledge
of the Tiuth in his own Time; and if God shall influence
this pcor Man to convert and instruct the ignorant Savage
his Wise, I can never believe that he shall be castaway
himself, and have I not Reason then to rejoice, the nearer*
any aie b* ought to the Knowledge of Christ, tho* they may
not be bi ought quite home into the Bosom of the Catho-
lick Church, just at the Time when I may delii e it? leaving
it to the GoodneCs of Christ to perfect his Work in his
own Time, and his own Way: Certainly I would rejoice
if all the Savages in America were brought like this poor
Woman,
Woman to pray to God, tho' they were to be all Prote-
stants at first, rather than they should continue Pagans and
Heathens j firmly believing, that he who had bestow >d that
first Light upon them, would further illuminate them with
a Beam of his heavenly Grace, and. bring them into the
Pale of his Church when he ftould fee good.
I was astoniftYd at the Sincerity and Temper of this tru-
ly pious Papist, as much as I was oppressW by the Power
of his Reasoning; and it presently occur \fto my Thoughts,
that if such a Temper was universal, we might be all Gi-
tholick Christians, whatever Church or particular Profes-
sion we join'd to, or join'd in $ that a- Spirit of Charity
would soon work us all.up into right Principles,* and, in a
Word, as he thought that the like Charity would make us
all Catholicks, so I told him I believ'd, had all the Mem-
bers of his Charch the like Moderation, they would soon
be all Protestants ,* And there we left that Part, for we
never disputed at ail.
However, I talk'd to him another way, and taking hHn>
by the JHand, my Friend, says I, I wiih all the Clergy of
the Roman Church were blest with fiich Moderation, and
an equal Sliare of your Charity j I am entixly of your
Opinion , but I must tell you, that if you should preach
such Doctrine in Spain* or Italy* they would put you into
the Inquisition*
I t may be so, said he, I know not what they might
do in Spain and Italy, but I will not fay they would he
the better Christians for that Severity, for I am sure there
is no Heresy in too much Charity.
Well, as Will Atkins and his Wife were gone, our Busi-
ness there was over; so we went back our own "^ray; and
when we came back, we found them waiting to be cali'd
in: Observing this, I ask'd my Clergyman if we sl.ould
discover to him that we had ieen him under the Bust;,
or no and it was his Opinion we should not j but that
we should talk to him first, and hear what he would say
to us j so we calld him in alone, no Body being in the
Place but our selves, and I began with him thus:
Will Atkins, said I, prithee what Education had you?
What was your Father?
m a.
W. A. A better Man than ever I shall be. Sir, my Fa-
ther -was a Clergy mm.
\R.C. What Education did he give you?
IV. A. He would have taught me well, Sir ^ but I de-
spised all Education, Instruction, or Correction, like a Beast
as I was,
R. C. It's true, Solomon fays, he that despises Res rocs if
brutish.
W. A. Ay, Sir, I was brutish, indeed, I murther'd my
Father \ for God's fake, Sir, talk no more about that, Suk
\ murther'd my poor Father.
iY, Ha 1 a Murtherer! *
* Here the Vriefi started (for I interpreted every Word
as he spoke it) and look'd pale } It seems he believ'd
that Will had really kill'd his own Father.
R. C, No, no, Sir, I do not understand him so; Will
\dtkins, explain your self, you did not kill your Father, did
you, with your own Hands?
W. A. No, Sir, I did not cut his Throat j but I cut
the Thread of all his Comforts, and shorten'd his Days I
broke his Heart by the most ungrateful unnatural Return-,
for the most tender affectionate Treatment that ever Father
gave, or Child could receive.
R. C. 'Well,. I did not ask you about your Father to
extort this Confession I pray God give you Repentance-
for it, and forgive you that, and all your other Sins; but I
$sk'd you, because I fee, that tho* you have not much
Learning, yet you are not so ignorant as some arc, in Things
that are good $ that you have known more of Religion a
gieat deal than you have practised.
W. A. Tho' you, Sir, did not extort the Confession*
that I make about my Father, Conscience does $ and when
ever we come to look back upon our Lives, the Sins a-
gainst our indulgent Parents are certainly the first that
touches us 5 the Wounds they make lie deepest, and the
Weight they leave will lie heaviest upon the Mind, of all
the Sins we can commit.
R. C. You talk too feelingly and sensibly for me Atkins;
I cannot bear it,,
W.A>
W. A. You bear it, Master! I dare say you know no-
thing of it.
R. C. Yes, Atkins, every Shore, every Hill, nay, T may.
iay, every Tree in this Bland is witness to the Anguish of
my Soul, for my Ingratitude and base Usage or a good
tender Father 5 a Father much like yours, by your Descrip-
tion j and I murther'd my Father as well as you, Will At-
kins j but think, for all that, my Repentance is short of
yours too * by a great deal.
* I would have said more* if I could have restrained
my Bastions, but I thought this poor Man's Repent-
ance was fi much sheerer than mine, that I was go-
ing to have off the I>ifcourse and retire, for I was
surprized with what he said*, and thought, that instead
of my going about to teach and instruct him, the Man
. . was made a Teacher and Instructor to me, in a moft
surprizing and unexpected manner.
I laid all this before the young Clergyman, who was
greatly affected with it, and said to me, Did I not fay, Sir,
that when this Man was converted, he would preach to ui
all? I tell you, Sir, if this one Man be made a true Peni*
lent, here will be no need of me, he will make Christians
of all in the Island: But having a little composed my self,
I renew'd my Discourse with Will Atkins.
But W1L L, said I, How comes the Sense of this Mat-
ter to touch you just now?
W. A. Sir, you have set me about a Work that has
struck a Dart thro'^my very Soul I have been talking a-
bout God and Religion to my Wife, in order, as you di7
rected me, to make a Christian of her, and ihe haspreacjsd
such a Sermon to me, as I shall never forget while I
live.
R. C. No, no, it is not your Wife has preach'd to you;
but when you were moving religious Arguments to her,
Conscience has flung them back upon you.
A. W. Ay, Sir, with such a Force as is not to be re-
sisted.
R. C. Pray- WM, let us know what pafrd between^
you and your Wife, for I kgow something of it al-
ready^
F 4 mJ.
A. Sir, it is impossible to give you a Full Accormt
©f it j I am too full to hold it, and yet have no Tongue
to express it but Jet her have iaid what il c will, andtho'
1 cannot give you an Account of it, this I can tell you of
it, that I resolve to amend and reform my Life.
R, C. But tell us some of it. How did you begin
Will i For this has been an extraordinary Caie, that's cer-
tain 5 she has preach'd a Sermon, indeed, if (he ha*
wrought this upon you.
W. A. Why, I hrst told her the Nature of our Laws
about Marriage, and what the Reasons were, that Men
•and Women were oblig'd to enter into soch Compacts, as
it was neirlier in tjoe Power of one or other to break
that otherwise, Order and Justice could not be maintain'd,
^nd Men would run from their Wives, and abandon their
'Children, mix confusedly with one another, and neither
Families be kept entire, or Inheritances be fettled by legal
Pescent.
R. C. You talk like a Civilian, fVilh could you make
her understand what you meant by Inheritance and Fami-
lies ? they know no such thing among the Savages, but
marry any how, without Regard to Relation, Consangui-
nity, or Family j Brother and Sister,- nay, as I have been-
told, even the Father and Daughter, and the Son and the Mo-
ther.
IV. A, I believe, Sir, you are misinformed, and my
Wife allures me of the contrary, and that they abhor it j
peihaps, for any farther Relations, they may not be so ex^
*ct as we are j but she tells me they never touch one an-
other in the near Relations you speak of.
R. C. Well,, what did she say,, to what you told
Ijer.
W. A. She said, (he lik'dit very well* and- it was much
better than in her Country.
R, C. But did you tell her what Marriage was?
W. A. Ay, ay, there began all our Dialogue, I ask'd- ,
her if floe would be marry d to me our Way? She ask'd
me what Way that was? I told her, Marriage was ap-
pointed of Godand here we had a strange Talk together,
^Kjeed, as ever Man and Wife had, I believe..
N. B. This Dialogue between W. Atkins and his
Wife, as I took it down in Writing, just after he told
it me, was as follows.
Wife. Appointed by your God! why have you a God in
your Country? .
W. A. Yes, my Dear, God is in every Country. •
Wife. No, your God in my Country? my Country
have the great old Benamuckee God.
W. A. Child, I am very unfit to {hew you who God.
ii 5 God is in Heaven, and made the Heaven and die Earth,
the Sea, and all that in them is.
Wife. No makee dc Earth; no, you God makee dc
Earth, no make my Country. *
* W. A. laugh'd A little at her "Expression of G<kl r.tf
making her Country.
Wife. No laugh, why laugh me £ This no Thing to
laugh, f
f He was justly reprov'd by his Wife, for she was more
serious than he at first.
W. A. That's true indeed, I will not laugh any more
my Dear.
Wife. Why you iay, you God make all?
W. A. Yes, Child, our God made the whole World,
and you, and I, and all Things j for he is the only true
God, there is no God but him, he lives for ever in Hea-
ven.
Wife. Why you no tell me long ago?
W. A. That s true indeed, but I have been a wicked
Wretch, and have not only forgotten to acquaint thee with
any Thing before, but have lived without God in the
• World my self. -
Wife. What have you de great God in you Country*
you no kno"'him,? No fay O to him? No do good
Thing for him? That no impossible!
W. A* It is too true tho, for all that, we live as. if
F j rker*
there was no God in Heaven, or that he Kad'no Power
on Earth?
Wife. But why, God let you do fb ? Why he no ma-
kee } ou gcod live?
W. A. It is all our own Fault.
Wife. But you fay me, he.is Great, much, Great, have-
much great Power; can makee kill, when he will>-why'
he nb makee kill when you no serve him ^ No say O to
him? No be good Mans?
W. A. That' is true he might strike me Dead, and I;
ought to expect it, for I have been a wicked Wretch, that
is true; but God is merciful, and does not deal with us as\
we deserve.
Wife. But then, do no you tell God Tankee for that
too?
W. A, No, indeed, I have ndt thank'd God for hh
Mercy, any more than I have fear'd God for his Power.
wife. Then you God no Godfj me no think, believe,
he be such one, great much Power, Strong; no makee kill
you tho1 you makee him much Angry?
fe A, What.? Will my wicked Life hinder youf rom
believing in God! What a dreadful Creature am I! And
what a sad Truth is it, that the horrid Lives of Christians-
hinders the Conversions of Heathens?
Wife.^ How me tink you have great much God f up
there, and yet no do well, no do good Ting? Can ha
tell? Sure he no.tell what you do?
f She points us to Heaven,,
W. A. Yes, yes, he knows and fees all Things he
hears us speak, sees what we do, knows what we think,
iho' we do not speak..
Wife. What! he no hear you swear, curse^ speak the.
great Damn?
IV. A. Yes, yes, he hears it all..
Wife. Where be then the muchee great Power strong? •
W. A. He is merciful, that's all we can fay for it;
and;this proves h'rn to le the true God j he is God and
not Man j and therefore w.c are not. consumed. *

* Here Will. Atkins told us he was struck with Horror,
to think how he could tell his Wife so clearly, that
God fees, and hears, and knows the secret Thoughts
of the Heart, and all that we do and yet that he
had darsd to do all the vile Th'mgs he had done.
Wife. Merciful! What you call dat?
W. A. He is our Father and Maker, and he pities and
spares us.
- Wife, So then he never makee kill, never angry when,
you do wicked > then he fto good himielfi or no great
able.
W. A. Tes, yes, my Dear, he is infinitely good, and
infinitely great, and able to punifli too ; and iometimes to
sl ew his Justice and Vengeance, he lets fly his Anger to
destroy Sinners, and make Examples 5 many are cut oif in
their Sins.
Wife. But no makee kill you yet, than he tell-you way
be that he no make you kill, so you make de Bargain with
him, you do bad Thing, he no be angry at you/ when he
be angry at other Mans?
W. A. No indeed, my Sins are all Presumptions upon
his Goodness $ and he would be infinitely just if he de-
stroys me as he has done other Men,
Wife. Well, and yet no kill, no makee you dead, what
you fay to him for that, you no tell him Tankee for all
that too?
W. A. I am an unthankful, ucgrateful Dog, that's
true.
Wife. Why he no makee you much good better, you.
fay he makee you.
W. A. He made me as he made all the World 'tis
I have deform'd my sel£ and abus d his Goodness, and
have* made my ielf an abominable Wretch.
Wife. I wish you makee God know me, I no makee
him angry, 1 no do bad wicked Thing.
Here Will. Atkins said his Heart funk within him, to
hear a -poor untaught Creature desire to be taught to
know Gody and he such a wicked Wretch, that he
could not fay one Word to her about God, but what
the
the Reproach of his own Carriage would make mop
\ irrational to her to believe; nay, that already /he-
- could not believe in God, because he that was.so wick--
ed was not destrey'd.
W. A. My Dear, you mean, you wish I could teach
^ou to know God, not God to know you; for he know*;
you already, and every Thought in your Heart.
Wife. Why- then ne know what I say to you now?
He know me wish to know him.5 how shall me know
who makee me?
W. A. Poor Creature, he must teach' thee, I cannot
teach thee; I'll pray to him to teach thee to know him,
and *o. forgive; me that I. arri. unworthy to teach
thoe..
The poor Fellow was in-such an Agony at her desiring
him to make her know God, and her wistjing to know
Um,^that, he said, he fell down on* his Knees before
her,- and, pray'd. to God to (.nlighten her Mind with
th.efavi\ig Knowledge of Jesus Clyrist, and to pardon
his,Sins, and accept of his being the- unworthy Instru-
ment of instructing her in the Principles of Religion;
Ms ter which he fate down by her again,, and their
JDialogue went on. N. B. This was the Time
when we frw him kneel.down, and" lift up his
Hands.,
Wife. What you put down the Knee-for? What you
liold tip the Hand for? What you fay? Who you speak
to? What i$.that?
W. A.. My Dear, I bow my Knees in Token of my
Submission to him that, made me; I said Q to him, as you
call it, and as you fay, your. old Men do to. their Idol
pmckee5 that is, I pray'd to him..
Wife, What you lay O to. him for?
W. A. I pray'd to him to open your Eyes, and your*
Under standing, that you may know him, and be accepted
by him-.
Wife. Can he do that too-?'
"4< Yes, he can, he can dp all Things*-.
Jfjfi,. But no he hear what you lay?
IK «4£<
c 133 y
W. A. Yes, he has bid us pray to Kim, and promi'd to
Hear us.
Wife. Bid you pray? When he bid you? How he bid:
you? What! You hear him speak?
W. A. No, we do nor hear him speak, but he has re-
Teal'd himself many Ways to us.
Here he was at a great Loss to make her understand,
that God has reveal*d himself to us by his Word^
and -what his Wdrd -was But at last he told it her-
thus,
W. A. God has spoken to some good Men in former
Ehys, <?ven from Heaven, by plain Words; and God has
inipir'd good Men by his Spirit \ and they have written ail
his Laws down in a Book.
Wife. Me no understand that, where is Book?
W. A. Alas! my poor Creature, I'have not this Books
but I hope I {ball one Time or other get it for you to
read it. ,
Here he embraced her with great Affection } but with,
inexfeffMe Grief, that he had not a Bible.
Wife. But how you makee me know, that God teachee -
them to wi itethat Book?
W. A* By the fame Rule that> we know him to be
God.
Wife. What Rule, what Way you know?
W. A. Becau'e he teaches and commands nothing but
what is good, righteous, and holy j and tends to make
us perfectly good, as well as perfectly happy \ and be-
cause he forbids aid commands us to avoid all that is
wicked, that is BfiL in it self, or Evil in its Conse-
quences.
Wife. That me would understand, that me fain fee j
if he teachee alt gooc1 Thing, forbid all wicked Tiling,
he reward all good Ihing, punish all wicked Thing,
he make all Thing, he ^ive all Thing, he hear me when
I say O to him, as you go do just now* he makee roe
good, if I wish be gooA\ he spare me, no makee kill
Hie, when I.no be good5 ill this you fay he do^ yes he
be great God -7 me take, think, believe Kim be great GcS
me say O to him too with you, my Dear.
Here the poor Man, said he, could forbear 110 longer; but
raising her up, made her kneel by him, and he pray'd to
God, aloud, to instruct her in the Knowledge of himself
by his Spirit, and that by some good Providence, if pos-
sible, she might sometime or other come to have a Bible,
that she might read the Word of God, and be taught by
it to know him.
This was the Time that we law him lift her up
by the Hand, " and saw him kneel down by her, as
above.
They had several other Discourses it seems after this,
too long to set down here j and particularly she made iim
promise, that since he confessed his own Life had been a
wicked abominable Course of Provocation against God,
that he would reform it, and not make God angry .any
more, lest he should make him dead, as ste cail'd it, and
then she should be left alone, and never be taught to know
this God better j and lest he should be miserable, as he had
told her wicked Men should be after Death..
This was a strange Account, and very afecting to us
both, but particularly to the young Clergyman; he was
indeed wonderfully surpnVd with it, but under the great-
est Affliction imaginable that he could not tylk to her, that
he could not speak English to make her understand him;
and as she spoke but very broken English, le could not un-
derstand her: However he turn'd himself to me, and told
me, that he belicvU there must be moifc to do with this
Woman than to marry her: I did not understand htm at
first, but at length he explain'd him$f, .(w.J that fte
ought to be Baptiz/d.
I agreed with him in that Part readily, and was for
foing about it presently: No, no, b61d Sir, said he, tho*
would have her be baptiz/d by p& Means, yet I mull:
observe,, that Will. Atkins, her Hustyind, has indeed brought
Jber in a wonderful Manner to be filling to embrace a re-
ligious Life, and has given her jm Ideas of the Being of
a God, of his Power, Justice,* Mercv 5 yet I dellre to
know of him, if he had said #iy Thing to her of Jesu&
Christ, and of die Salvation of Sinners, of the Nature of
. ( Faith
 
Faitfi in him, and Redemption by him; of the Holy Spi-
rit, the Resurrection, the last Judgdment, and a future
State.
I call'd Will. Atkins again, and ask'd him; but the
poor Fellow fell immediately into Tears,, and told us he
had said something to her of all those Things, but that
he was himself so wicked a Creature, and his own Con-
seience so reproach'd him with his horrid ungodly Life,
that he trembled at the Apprehensions, that her Know-
ledge of* him, should lessen the Attention she should give
to those Things, and make her rather contemn Religion,
than receive it : But he was assured he said that her Mind:
was se dispos'd to receive due Impressions of all those
Things, that if I would but discourse with her she would
make it appear to my Satisfaction, that my Labour would4
not be lost upon her.
Accordingly I call'd her in* and placing my self
as Interpreter between my religious Priest and the Woman,
I entreated him to begin with her; but sere sech a Ser-
mon was never preaend by a Popish Priest in these latter
Ages of the World , and, as, I told him, I thought he had
all the Zeal, all the Knowledge, all the Sincerity of a:
Christian, without the Errors of a Roman Catholick; and
Bishops were, before the Church of Rome assum'd spiri-
tual Sovereignty over the Consciences of Men:
I n a Word, he brought the poor Woman to embrace-
the Knowledge of Christ, and of Redemption Jby him,,
not with Wonder and Astonishment only, as she did the-
first Notions of a God, but with Joy and Faith, with
an Affection and a surprising Degree of Understanding,
scarce to be imagin'd, much less to be express d j and" at
her own Request she was baptiz'd.
When he was. preparing to baptize her, I entreated
him that he would perform that Office with seme Cau-
tion, that the Man might not perceive he was of the Romm
* Church, if possible j because of other ill Consequences which
might attend a Difference among us in that very Religion,,
which we were instructing the other in: He told me, that
as he had no consecrated Chappel, no proper Things for
the Office, I should see he would do it in a Manner, that I:
ihould not know by it, that he was a Raman Catholick
that I took him to be such a Cleri
 
my
my" self, if I Had not known it before: And ib'he did $~
for saying only some Words over to himself in Latin,
which I could not understand, he pour'd a whole Dishful
of Water'upon the Woman's Head, pronouncing in French,
4 very loud, MARY, which was the Name, her Husband*
desir'd ?ne to give her j for I was her Godfather, 1 baptize
thee in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the
Holy Ghost , so that none could know any Thing by it,,
what Religion he was of: He gave the Benediction after-
wards in Latin j but either WrtL JLtk'ms did not know but'
it. was in French, or else did not take Noticej of it, at
that Time- ' \
As. Ibon as this was over we marry'd them; and after
the Marriage was over, he turn'd himself to Will. Atkins,
and in a very affectionate. Manner exhorted him, not on-
ly to persevere in that good Disposition he was in, but to
lupport the Convictions that were upon him by a Resolu-
tion to reform his Life; told him, it was in vain to fay*
he repented, if he did not forsake, his Crimes-: Represent-
ed to him, how God had honoui'd^him- with being the
Instrument of bringing his Wife to the Knowledge of the
Christian Religion, and that he should be carerul he did x
not dishonour the Grace of God, and that if - he did, he
would see the Heathen a better Christian than himself,' the-
Savage converted, and the Instrument cast away.
H e said a great many good Things to them both, and
-then recommended them in a.feVv Words to God's, Good-
ness, gave them the Benediction again, I repeating every
Thing to them in English, and thus ended the Ceremony:
I think it was the most piealant agreeable Day to me that
ever I pasted in' my whole Life. . ,
But my Clergyman had not done yet* nis Thoughts
hung continually upon the Conversion of-the seven and
thirty Savages,' and fain he- would have stay'd upon the
Island to have undertaken it; but I con vine cl him, first,
that his Undertaking was impracticable in it self j and Je-
cmdly, that perhaps Lyvoiild mf itjnto a WTay' of being
done, in his Absence,- to his Satisfaction 5 - of which, 4>y
and .by.
H-aning thus brought the A ihk of the Island'to >£p
narrow Compass, I'was preparing l0go onbo.rJ die Ship;
when the young Man who I had taken out of the fa- •
inishcL
Fnish'd Ship's Company came to me, aed told me, he mr-
undej stood I had a Clergyman with me, and that I had
caused the Englifomen to be married to the Savages, whom
they, called W aves j that he had a Match too, which he
delired might be finish'd before I went, between two
Christians, which he hopd would not be disagreeable to
me.
I k new this must be the young Woman who was his-
Mother's Servant, for there was no other Christian Woman
on the Island * so I began to persuade him not (to do any Thing,
of that Kind rashly, or because he found himself in this sola-
tary Circumstance: I represented' that he had some consi-
derable Substance in the Word, and good Friends as I un-
stood by himself, and by his Maid also; that the Maid was
not only poor, and a Servant, but was unequal to him,
she being six or seven and" twenty Years old, and he not
above seventeen or eighteen, that he might very probablyy
with my Assistance, make a Remove from this Wilder-
ness, and come into his own Country again, and that-
then it would be a thousand to one but he would repent
his Choice j and the Dislike of that Circumstance might
be disadvantageous to both: I was going to fay more but
he inteiTupted me, smiling, and told me, with a great
deal of Modesty, that I mistook in my Guesses, that he
had nothing of that Kind in his Thoughts, his present
Circumstance being melancholly and disconsolate enough >.
and he was very glkd to hear that I had Thoughts of pitt-
ing them in a Way to see their own Country again, and'
that nothing should have put him upon staying tnere,. but
that the Voyage f was going was- ib exceeding long and
hazardous, and would carry nim quite out of- the Reach
of all his Friends; that he had nothing to desire of me,,
but that I would settle him in some little Property in the
Island where he was, give him a Servant or two and'
some few Neceslarics, and he would settle himself here,
like a Painter, waiting the good Time, when, if ever T
returned to England, I would redeem him, and hopld I
would not be unmindful of him when I came to England's
that he would give me some Letters to his Friends in L6n*.
don, to let them know how good I had been to him, and'
i& wjjat Part of th$. World,, and what Circumstance 1 had'
left him in j that he promised me, that when ever I re^
•deem'd him, the Plantation and all the Improvements lie
had made upon it, let the Value be what it would, should
be wholly mine.
His Discourse was very prettily delivers, considering,
his Youth, and was the more agreeable to me, becauie
he told me positively the Match was not for himself: I
gave him all possible Assurances, that, if I liv'd to come
iafe to England^ I would deliver his Letters, and do his
Business t-^t>uÆy, and that he might depend I would
never forget the Circumstance I had Test him in but still
I was impatient to know, who was the Person to be mar-
ried, upon which he told me, it was my sack of all Traces*
and his Maid Susan.
I was most agreeably ftrprrz'd, when he nam'd th$
Match, for indeed! had thought it very futablej the Cha-
racter of that Man I have given already j and as for the
Maid, flie was a very honest, modest, sober and religious
young Woman, had a very good Share of Sense, was
agreeable enough in her Person, spoke very handibmly and
to the Purpose, always with Decency and good Manners*
and not backward to ipeak when any Thing requir'd it,
or impertinently forward to ipeak when it was riot her Bu-
siness very handy and housewifely in any^fcig that was
before her j an excellent Manager, and fit indeed to have
been Governess to the whole Island 5 she knew very well
how to behave herself to all kind of Folks she had about
her, and to better, if she had found any there.
The Match being propos'd in this Manner, we mar-
ried them the seme Day, and as I was Father at, the Altar,
as I may sey, and gave her away, se I gave her a Por-
tion 3 for I appointed her and her Husband a handsome
large Space of Ground for their Plantation; and indeed
this Match, and the Propose! the young Gentleman
made to me, to give him a small Property in the
Island, put me upon parcelling it out amongst them, that. o
they might not quarrel afterwards about their Situa-
tion.
This Sharing out the Land to them, I left to Will. At^
kins, who indeed was now grown a most sober, grave*
managing Fellow j perfectly reformed, exceeding pious
aud religious, and as far as I may be allow'd to (peak po-
sitively
uiivcly in such a Case, I verily believe, was a true sincere
Penitent.
He divided Things Co justly, and Co much to every
one's Satisfaction, that they only desired one general Writ-
ing under my Hand for the Whole, which I caused to be
drawn up, and signed and sealed to them, setting out the
Bounds and Situation of every Man's Plantation, and testi-
fying, that I gave them thereby, severally a Right to the
whole Possession and Inheritance of the respective Planta-
tions or Farms, with their Improvements,, to them and
their Heirs, reserving all the rest of the Island as my own
Property, and a certain Rent for every particular Plantation
after eleven Years, if I, or any one from me, or in my
Name, came to demand it, producing an attested Copy of
the lame Writing.
As to the Governmeat and Laws among them, I told
them I was not capable of giving them better Rules, than
they were able to give themselves only made them pro-
mise me to live in Love and good Neighbourhood with
one another j and Co I prepared to leave them.
One Thing I must not omit, and this is, that being
now settled in a kind of Common-wealth among them-
selves, and having much Business in Hand, it was but odd
to have seven and thirty Indians live in a Nook of the
Island, independent, and indeed unemploy'd; for except-
ing the providing themselves Food,, which they had Di£»
ficuky enough, in too, sometimes, they had no manner of
Business or Property to manage: I propos'd therefore to
the Governour Sfmiard, that Jie should go to them with
Friday's Father, and propose to them to remove, and ei-
ther plant for themselves, or take them into their several
Families as Servants to be maintains for their Labour, but
without being absolute Slaves, for I would not admit
them to make them Slaves by Force,-by any Means, be-
cause they had their Liberty given by Capitulation, and as
t it were Articles of Surrender, which they ought not to>
* break.
They most willingly embrae'd the Proposil, and came
all very chearfully along with him ; so we allotted then!
Land, and "Plantations, which three or four accepted of,
but all. the rest chose to be employ'd as Servants in the se-
veral
TcraTFamiRcs we had fettled; and thus my Colony wrs~
in a Manner fettled, as follows 5 The Spaniards possess d
my original Habitation, which was the Capital City, and
extended their Plantations all along the Side of the Brook,
which made the Creek that I have £0 often describ'd, as
far as my Bower 5 and as they encreas'd their Culture;
it went always Eastward 5 the English liv'd in the
North-East Part, where Will. Atkins and his Comrades be-
gan, and came on Southward, and South-West, towards
the back Part of the Spaniards, and every Plantation had
a great Addition of Land to take in, if they found Occa-
sion, £0 that they need not jostle one another for want of
Room.
All the West End of the Island was left uninhabited j
that if any of the Savages siiould come on Shore therej
only for their usual customary Barbarities, they might
come and go j if they disturbs no Body, no- Body
would disturb them 5 and no doubt but they were often
ashore, and went away again 5 for I never heard that the
Planters were ever attack'? or disturb'd any more.
I t now came into my Thoughts, that I nad hinted to my
.Friend the Clergyman, that the Work of' converting the
Savages, might perhaps be let on foot: in his Absence, to-
his Satisfaction i and I told him, that now I thought it
was put in a fair Way j for the Savages being thus divided
among the Christians, if they would but every one of
them do their Part with thole which came under their
Hands, I hop'd it might have a very good Effect.
H e agreed presently in that, I£ faid he, they will do*
their Part 3 but how, fays he, shall we obtain that of them?
I told him, we would call them all together, and leave it
in Charge with them, or go to them one by one, which
he thought best, so we divided it; he to speak te the Spa-
niards, who were all Papists, and I to the Englist?, who
were all Protestants; and we recommended it earnestly to
them, and made them promise* that they never Would #
make any Distinction of Papist or Protestant, in their exhort-
ing the Savages to turn Christians-; out teach them the
general Knowledge of the true God, and of their Savi-
our Jesus Christ, and they likewise promisd us, that they
would never have any Differences or Disputes one with
another, about Religion.
W EHN
When I came to W. Atkins's House, (I may call itsso,
for such .a Mouse or such a piece of Basket-Work, I believe,
was not Handing in the Woild again j ) I la/, when I came
-there, I found the young Woman I have mention'd a-
bove, and W. Atkins's Wife, were become Intimates; and
.this prudent religious young Woman, had perfected the
Work IV. Atkins had .begun j and tho' it was not above
four Days after what I have related, yet the new baptiz'd
Savage Woman was made such a Christian, as I have sel-
dom*" heat d of any like her, in all my Observation, or Con-
versation in the World.
It came next into my Mind in the Morning before I went
to them, that amongst all the needful Things I had to Leave
with them, I had not left a Bible, in which, I ibew'd my
self less considering for them, than my good Friend the
Widow was for me, when <he sent me the Cirgo of an
hundred Pounds from Lisbon, where ste pack'd up three
Bibles and a Prayer-Book: However, the good Woman's
Charity had a greats Extent than ever she imagined >
for they were reserv'd for the Comfort and Instruction
of thole, that made much better Use of them than I had
done.
I took one of the Bibles in my Pocket, and when I
came to Will Atkins's Tent or House, and found the young
Woman, and Atkins's baptiz'd Wife, had been discoursing
of Religion together j for Will Atkins told me, rcith a, great
Mai of Joy : I ask'd if they were together now, and he
iaid, Yes; ib I went into the House, and he, with me,
and we found them together very earnest in Discourse j
O Sir, lays WilL Atkins, when God has Sinners to recon-
cile to himself, and Aliens to bring Home, He never wants
a Messenger; my Wife has got a new Instructor; I knew
J was unworthy, as I was uncapable of that Work j that
young Woman has been sent hither from Heaven; sl:e is
enough to convert a whole Island of Savages j the young
Woman blustsd, and rose up to go away, but I de-
sired her to sit still j I told her, she had a good
Work upon her Hands, and I hop'd God would blefi
her in it.
W e talk'd a little, and I did not perceive they had any Book
among them, though I did not ask; but I put my Handia
jny Pocket, and pulTd out my Bible, hcic3Jhys I, to Atkins,
I have
fore; the Man was so confounded, that he was not able to
speak for some Time j but recovering himself, he takes it with
"both his Hands, and turning to his Wife, hcTe, my Dear, fays
he; did not I teli you, our God, tho' He lives above, could
hear what we {aid? Here's the Book I pray'd for, when
you and I kneel'd down under the Bush; now God has
heard us, and sent it; when he had said so, the Man fell
into such Transports of a passionate Joy, that between the
Joy of having it and giving God Thanks for it, the Tears
run down his Face like a Child that was Crying.
The Woman was surprised, and was like to have run
into a Mistake,. that none of us were aware of; for she
firmly bcliev'd God had sent the Book upon her Husband's
Petition; It is true, that providentially it was so, and might
be taken ib in a consequent Sense; but I bcliev'd, it would
have been no difficult Matter at that Time to have per-
suaded the poor Woman to have believ'd, that an express
Messenger came from Heaven, on purpose to bring that
individual Book; but it was too serious a Matter,to suffer
any Delusion to take Place; so I turn'd to the young Wo-
man and told her, we did not deiire to impose upon the
new Convert, in her first, and more ignorant understand-
ing of Things; mid begg'd her to explain to her, that God
may be very properly Slid to answer our Petitions, when
in the Course of his Providence, such Things are in a par-
ticular Manner brought to pais, as we petitioned for; but
we do not expect returns from Heaven, in a miraculous
and particular Manner, and that it is our Mercy, that it is
not so.
so that thete was, I assure you, no Priestcraft used here;
and I stiould have thought it one of the most unjustifiable
Frauds in the World, to have had it so; but the Surprise
of Joy upon Will. Atkins, is really not to be expresied>
and there we may be fore, there was no Delusion: Sure,
no Man was ever more thankful in the World for any
Thing of its Kind, than he was for this Bible; nor I be-
lieve, never any Man was glad of a Bible from a better
Principle; and though he had been a most profligate Creature,
desperate, headstrong, outragious, furious, and wicked to a
great Degree j yet this Man is a standing Rule to us all
This the
 
for the well instructing Children, (viz,.) that Parents should
never give over to teach and instruct;, or ever despair of
the Success of their Endeavours, let the Children be ever so
obstinate, refractory, or to Appearance, insensible of instruct-
ion j for if ever God in his Providence, touches the Con-
sciences of such, the Force of their Education returns up-
on them, and the early Instruction of Parents is not lost ,
though if may have been many Years laid asleep; but some
Time or other, they mav find the Benefit of it.
Thus it was with this poor Man; However ignorant
he was, or divested of Religion and Christian Knowledge;
He found he had some to do with now, move ignorant
than himself; and that the least Part of the Instruction of
his good Father that could now come to his Mind, was
of Use to him.
A m ong the rest it occurr'd to him, he said, how his
Father us'd to insist much upon the inexpressible Value of
the' Bible; the Privilege and Blessing of it to Nations, Fa-
milies, and Persons j but he never entertain'd the least No-
tion of the Worth of it, till now 5 when being to talk to
Heathens, Savages, and Barbarians, he wanted the Help of
the written Oracle for his Assistance.
The young Woman was very glad of it also for the
present Occasion, tho* she had one, and so had the Youth
on board our Ship among their Goods, which were not
yet brought on Shore $ and now having said so many
Things of this young Woman, I cannot omit of telling
one Story more of her, and my self, which has something
in it very informing and remarkable.
I have related, to what Extremity the poor young Wo-
man was reduced j how her Mistseis was starv d to Death,
and did die on board that unhappy Ship we met at Sea >
and how the whole Ship's Company being reduced to the
last Extremity j the Gentlewoman, and her Son, and this
Maid, were first hardly used, 4s" to Provisions; and at last
totally neglected arid starv'drihat Is'to lay, brought to the
last Extremity of Hunger.
On e Day being Discoursing with her upon the Extrer
mities they suffer'd, I ask'd her if she could describe by
what {he had - felt, what it was to staTve, and how it ap-
pealed; {he told me, she believ'd slie could j and {he told
her Tale very distinctly thus c
"First,
"F i n s t, Sir, said she, we had for some Days fhr'd
"exceeding hard, and suffered very-great Hunger •> but
"now at last, we were wholly without Food of any Kind,
<£ -except Sugar, and a little Wine, and a little Water. The
u first Day, after I had receiv'd no Food at all, I found
"my self towards Evening, first empty and fickish at my
"Stomach, and nearer Night mightily incliiVd to yawn-
"ing .and ileepy I laid down on a Couch in the great
"Cabin to sleep, and slept about three Hours, and awak'd
*f a little refreftYd 5 having taken a Glass of Wine when I
ft lay down j afrer being about three Hours awake, it be-
"ing about five a-Clock in the Morning, I found my self
"empty and my Stomach sickilh again,and lay'd down again,
"but could not steep at all, being very faint, and ill j and
w thus I continu'd all the second Day, with a strange Va-
"riety, first Hungry, then fick again, with Reachings to
<4 vomit} the second Night being oblige! to go to Bed a-
s< gain, without any Food, more than a Draught of fair
"Water j and beingj asteep, I dream'd I was at Barbadoes,
<c and that the Market was mightily stockJd with Proviit-
"onsj that I brought some for my Mistress, and went
"and din'd very heartily.
"I Thought my Stomach was as full after this, as
e< it would have been after, or at a good Dinner; but
4< when I awak'd, I was exceedingly iiink in my Spirits,
c' to find my self in the extremity of Famine: The last
"Glass of Wine we had, I drank, and put Sugar in it,
<£ because, of its having some Spirit to supply Nouristi-
"mentj but there being no Substance in the Stomach for the
"digesting Office to work upon, I found the only ctfcct
"of the w ine was, to raise disagreeable Fumes from the
"Stomach, into the Head j and I lay, as they told me,
"stupid, and senseless, as one Drunk for some Time. ,
"The third Day in the Morning, after a Night of
strange and confus'd inconsistent Dreams; and rather
"dozing than sleeping, I wak'd, ravenous and furious*
"with Hunger j and I question, had not my Understand-
*' ingreturn'd and eonquer'd it; I fay, I question whether,
u if I had been a Mother, and had had a little Child with
*' me, its Life would have been safe or not?
y This
"This lasted about three Hours* during which Time
I was twice raging Mad as any Creature in Bedlam, as
my young Master told me, and as he can now inform
"I n one of these Fits of Lunacy or Distraction* whe-
ther by the Motion of the Ship, or some Slip of my
Foot, I know not; I fell down, and struck my Face
against the Corner of a Palat Bed in which my Mistress
lay ,• and with the Blow the Blood gufh'd out of my
Nose j and the Cabin Boy bringing me a little Bason, I
sat down and bled into it a great deaij and as the Blood
'run from me, I came to my self ,* and the Violence of
'the Flame, or the Fever, I was in abated, and so did
'the ravenous Part of the Hunger.
"Then I grew sick, and reach'd to Vomit, but could
{ not i for I had nothing in my Stomach to bring up:
* After I had bled some Time, I swoon'd, and they all
* bclicv'd I was dead; but I came to my self soon af-
"ter, and then had a mpst dreadful Pain in my Sto-
"mach, not to be describe \ not like* the Cholick, but a
"gnawing eager Pain for Food j and towards Night it
"went ott with a kind of earnest Wishing or Longing
"for Food > something like, as / suppose, the Longing
"of a Woman with Child: I took another Draught of
et Water with Sugar in it, but my Stomach loathed the
"Sugar, and brought it all up again > then I-took a Draught
"of Water without Sugar, and that stayed with me > and
<f / laid me dowa upon the Bed, praying most heartily,
"that it would please God to take me away; and com*
Cl poling my Mind in Hopes of it, I slumber'd a while,
c< and then waking, thought my self dying, being light
"with Vapours from an empty Stomach, J: recommend-
"ed my Soul to God, and earnestly wifh'd that some Bo-
"dy would throw me into the Sea*
"All this while my Mistress lay by me, just, as I,
"though<xpa?tngi but bore it with much riiore Patience
u thanl^and gave the last Bit of Bread she had left to her
." •Child, my young Master, who would not have taken
"it, but she oblig'd him to eat it j and I believe it fav'd
« his Life.
"T o w a r ds the Morning I slept again, and first, when
"I wak'd, I fell into a violent Pastion of Crying, and as-
G "ter
C'i4* )'
ff ter that had a second Fit of yiolent Hunger, so that / got
<c up ravenous, and in a most, dreadful Condition; had my
"Mistress been dead, as, £nuck as J" lov'd her, I am certain,
€t I should have eaten a Piece of her Flesh, with as much
*u Relish, and as unconcerned as ever /did the Ficslr of
c< any Creature appointed for' Food, and once or twice I
V was going to bite my own Arm: At last, / saw the
"Bason, in which was the Blood I had bled at my Nose

*c Haste, and such a greedy. Appetite, as if: 7 had won-

"be taken from me now, ', i.
"Tho.' after it was down, the Thoughts of it fili'd
"me with Horror, yet it check'd the Fit of Hunger,
«' and I drank a Draught of fair Water, and was com-
(i pos'd and, refresh'd for someHours after it,* This was
"the 4th Day,;and thus I held it, till towards Night,
"when Within the Compass of three Hours, I had all
"these several Circumstances oyer again, one after ano-

*' Stomach* then ravenous again, then sick^gam, then lu-
"natick, then crying, then ravenous again, and ib every
"Quarter of an Hour; and my strength wasted excecd-

<( I w as not able to get off from the Bed, and my
«* Mistress much less 'and my Master was so lick,
"that I thought he had been expiring 5 so we could not
*• open the Cabin-Door, or get any Account what it was
« that occasions fiich a Combustion, nor had we any
"Conversation with the Ship's Company for two Days;
<c they having told us they had not a Mouthful of any thing
"to eat in the Ship ; and they told us afterwards, they
ec thought we had been dead.
"It was this dreadful Condition we were in when you
u were sent to iave our Lives j and how you found us,
"Sir, you know as well as I, and better too.
This was her own Relation, and is stich a distinct Ac-
count of starving to Death, as J confess I never met with,
and was exceeding entertaining to me; / am the rather
apt to believe it to be a true Account, because the Youth
gave me an Account of a good Part of it, though I must
own, not so distinct and so feelingly as, his Maid 5 and the
rather, because it seems his Mother fed him at the Price
of her own Life: But the poor Maid, tho5 her Constitu-
tion being stronger than that of her Mistress, who was in
Years, and a weakly Woman too, {he might struggle
harder with it; I fay, the poor Maid might be supposed
to feel the Extremity something sooner than her Mistress,
who might be allowed to keep the last Bits something
longer than slie parted with any to relieve the Maid. No
Question, as the Caie is here related, if our Ship or some
other, had not so providentially met them, a few Days
more would have ended all their Lives, unlels they hid
prevented it by eating one, another > and even that as, their
Cafe stood, would have serv'd them but a little while, they
befng 5-00 Leagues from any Land ,\ or any Possibility of
Relief, other than in the miraculous Manner it happen Jd:
But this is by the Way,* /return to my Disposition of
Things among the People,
• And, First, It is to be observe here, That for many
Reasons I did not think fit to let them .know any Thing
of the Sloop I had fram'd, and which I thought of sotting'
up among them; for I found, at least at my first commg%
such Seeds of Divisions among them, that I law it plain-
ly, had I set up the Sloop, and left it among them, they
G z would
would upon every light Disgust have seperated, and gone
away from one another, or perhaps have turn'd Pirates,
and so made the Island a Den ot Thieves, instead of a
Plantation of sober and religious People, as I intended it
to be j nor did I leave the two Pieces of Brass Cannon that I
had on Board, or the two Quarter-Deck Guns, that my
Nephew took extraordinary, for the fame Reason: I thought
they had enough to qualify them for a defensive War a-
gainst any that should invade them $ but I was not to set
them tip for an offensive War, or to encourage them to
go Abroad to attaque others, which in the End would on-
ly bring Ruin and Destruction upon themselves and all their
Undertakings: I reserved the Sloop therefore, and the Guns,
for their Service another Way, as I shall observe in its
Place.
I H a v e now done with the Island: I left them all in
good Circumstances, and in a flourishing Condition, and
went on board my Ship again the Day of ,
having been five and twenty Days among them > and
as they were all resolv'd to stay upon the Island 'till I
came to remove them, I promis'd to fend some further
Relief from the Brasils9 if I could possibly find an Op-
portunity j and particularly I promis'd to fend them some
Cattle, such as Sheep, Hogs and Cows: For as to the two
Cows and Calves, which I brought from England, we
had been oblig'd, by the Length of our Voyage, to kill
them at Sea, for want of Hay to feed them.
The iiext Day> giving them a Salute of five Guns at
Parting, we set Sail, and arriv'd at the Bay of All-Saints,
in the Brafils, in about- ix Days* meeting nothing re-
markable in our Passage, but this, That about three Days
after we failed, being becalm'd, and the Current setting
strong to the E:N.E» running, as it were, into a Bay or
Gulph on the Land-fide, we were driven something out
of our Course, and once or twice our Men cry'd, Land
to the Westward; but whether it was the Continent or#
. Islands, we could -not tell by any Means.
But the third Day towards Evening, the Sea smooth, and
the Weather calm , we law the Sea, as it were, covered to-
wards the Land with something very black, not being abie^
to discover what it was; but after some Time, our chief
• Mate going up the main Shrowds a little Way, and look-
ing
hig at them with a Perspective, cry'd out it was an Ar-
my i 1 could not imagine what he meant by an Army,
and spoke a little hastily, calling the Fellow a Fool, or
some such Word: Nay, Sir, says he> don't be angry, for ir
is an Army, and a Fleet too; for I believe there are a thou-
iand Canoes, you may see them paddle along, and they are
coming towards us too, apace, and full of Men..
I w as a little lurpriz'd then indeed, and ib was my
Nephew, the Captain j for he had heard such terrible Stories
of them in the Island, and having never been in those Seas
before, that he could not tell what to think of it, but
iaid two or three Times, we should all be devours. I
must confess, considering we were becalm'd, and the Cur-
rent let strong towards the Shore, I lik'd it the worse: How-
ever, I bad him not be afraid, but bring the Ship to an
Anchor, as soon as we came so near as to know that we
must engage them.
The Weather continu'd calm, and they came on apace
towards us j so I gave Order to come to an Anchor, and
fioi le all our Sails . As for the Savages, I told them they
had nothing to fear but Fire; and therefore they should
get their Boats out, and fasten them, one close by the
Head, and the other by the Stern, and Man them both
well, and wait the Iffiie in that Posture: This I did, that
the Men in the Boats might be ready with Sheets and Buc-
kets to put out any Fire, these Savages might endeavour
to fix upon the Outlide of the Ship.
In this Posture we lay by for them, and in a little
while they came up with us; but never was such a hor-
rid Sight seen by Christians: My Mate was much mista-
ken in his Calculation of their Number, I mean of a
thousand Canoes -> the most we could make df them when
they came up,, being about a hundred and six and twenty,
and a great many of them too •* for- some of than had
sixteen or seventeen Men in them, some more j and the
• least six or seven.
When they came-nearer to us they seenVd to be struck
with Wonder and Astonishment, as at a Sight which they
had doubtless never seen before 5 nor could they at first,
as we afterwards understood, know what to make of us:
They #ame boldly up however very near to us, andseem'd
G % to
C*5°>
to go about, to row round us; but we call'd to our Men
in the Boats, not to let them come too near them.
T h i s very Order brought us to an Engagement with
them, without our deiiging it j for five or fix of their
large Canoes came so near our Long-Boat, that our Men
fcecjkon'd with their Hands to them to keep back, which
they understood Very well, and went back $ but at their
Ren cat, about so Arrows came on board us from those
* Beats 5 and one of our Men in the Long-Boat was very
much wounded.
However, I call'd to them not to fire by any Means j
but we handed down some Deal-Boards into the Boat,
and the Carpenter presently set up a kind of a Fence like
.waste Boards, to cover them fiom the Arrows of the
Savages, if they should shoot again.
About halt an Hour afterwards they came all up m
a Body a-stern of us, and pretty near^ £o near that we
could easily discern what they we're, tho' we could not
tell their Design: I easily found they were some of my
oki Friends, the fame Sort of Savages that I had been ti-
led to engage with j and in a little Time more they row'd
a link farther out to Sea, ''till they came dht€t\y Broad*
side with us, and then row'd down strait upon us, 'rill
they came so near that they could hear us' speak: Upon
this I order'd all my Men to keep close, lest they should
shoot any more Arrows, and made ail our Guns ready $
but being so near as to be within hearing, I made Friday
so out upon the-Deck, and call out aloud to them in his
.anguage, to know what they meant,* which accordingly
he did , whether they understood him or not, that I knew
jiot: But as ibon as he had railed .to-them, fix of them,
who were m the foremost or • nighest Boat to us, nuns
their Canoes from us > and stooping down j st.ew;d us their
naked Back-sides, just as if in Engliflh saving your Pre-
sence, they had bid us kiss- ;whether this was a
Defiance or Challenge, we know not j or whether it was
done in meer Contempt, or as a Signal to the rest j but im-
miediateiy Friday cry'd out, they were going to fi>oot,
and unhappily for him (poor Fellow) they let fly about
.300 of their Arrows, and, to my inexpressible Griefs kill'd
poor Friday, no other Man being in their Sight. The
poor Fcltew was shot with no less thanthiee Anows, and
about
about three more" fell very near him; such unl acky Marks-
men they were.
I w a s ib enrag'd with the Loss of my old Servant,
the Companion of all my Sorrows and Solitudes, that I
immediately, order'd five Guns to be loaded with small
Shot, and four with great, and gave them such a Broad-
side, as they had never heard in their Lives before, to be
sure.
They were not above naif a Cable's Length off when
we ftVd, and our Gunners took their Aim so well, that
three or four of their Canoes were overset, (as we had
Reason to believe) by one Shot, only.
T r»e ill Manners of turning up their- bare Back-fides to
us, gave us. no great. Ostence^ neither did I know for
certain, whether that which would pass for the greatest
Contempt among us, might be understood so by them,
or not j therefore in Return, I had only refolv'd to have
fir'd four or five Guns with Powder only, which I knew-
would fright them sufficiently: But when they shot at us
directly with all the Fury they were capable 6f, and efpe^
daily as they had kill'd my poor Friday* who I so entirely
lov'd and valu'd, and who indeed so well deserv'd it 5" I
not only had been justify'd before God and Man, but
would have been very glad, if I could, to have over*
set every Canoe there, and drown'd every one t>f
them.
I can neither tell, how many we kill'd, or how many
we wounded, at this Broad-fide j but surefiich a Fright and
Hurry never was seen among such a Multitude; there were
13 or 14. of their Canoes iplit and overset in all, arid the
Men all set a swimming 5 the rest, frighted out of their
Wits, seour'd away as fast as they couM; taking but little;
Care to save those whose Baits were split or ipbil'd with
our Shot: So, I suppose, that they Were many of them
lost: And our Men took up one poor Fellow swirr>'
• ming for his Life, above an Hour after they were all
gone.
Our small Shot from our Cannon must needs kill and
wound a great many 3 but, in fliort, we never knew any
Thing how it went with them $ for they fled ib fast, that
in three Hours, or thereabouts, we could not sec 'above,
three or four straggling Canoes 5 nor did we ever see the -
G 4 rest
rest any more; for a Breeze of Wind springing up- the
same Evening, we weighed and let Sail for the Brajils^
We had a Prisoner indeed j but the Creature was so
sullen, that he would neither eat or speak; and we all fansied
Jie would starve himself to Death: But I took a Way to cure
him j for I made them take him and turn him into, the Long-
Boat, and make him believe they would to£s him into the
Sea again, and Ib leave him where, they found him, if he
would notipeak; Nor would that do, but they really did
throw him into the Sea, and came away from him; and
then he follow'd them; for he swam like a Cork, and
calTd to them in his Tongue, tho* they knew not one
Word of what he laid: However, at last they took him
in again, and then he began to be more tractabley nor did
I ever design they Ihould drown him.
W e were now under Sail again ; but I was the moft
disconsolate Creature alive, for want of my Man Friday,
and would have been very glad to have gone back to the
Island, to have taken one ot the rest from thence for my
Occasion, but it could not be; so we went on: We had
one Priioner, as I have said j and 'twas a long while before
twc could make him understand any thing, but, in time,
our Men taught him lome UngUfli, and Se began to be a
.little tractable; afterwards* we enquir'd what Country he
came from, but could make nothing of what he laid; for
his Speccli was Ib odd, all Gutturals, aud spoken in the
Throat, in such an hollow and odd Mariner, that we could
never form a Word fiom him; and we were all of Opi-
nion that they might speak that Language as well, if they
were gaggd,, as other wile; Nor could we pei'ceiv^e rhat
they had any Occasion, either for Teeth, Tongue, Lips,
or Palate ; but form'd their Wotds just as a hunting Horn
forms a Tune with "an open Throat,- he teid us however,
some time after, when we had taught him to speak a
little English, that they were going with their Kings to
iight a great Battle. When he laid Kings, we ask'd him *
how many^ Kings? He said, they were Five Nation,.
(•we could not make him understand the Plurals) and that
they all join'd to go against Two Nation*. We ask'd him
what made them come up to us? He laid, to rmkee te
great Wonder look : Where it is to be observed, That ail
tho& Natives, as also those of Africa, when they learn
Englifl?, they always add two Es at the end of the Words
where we use one, and place the Accent upon the last of
them, as makee. takee, and , the like j and we could not
break them of it 5 nay, I could hardly make Friday leave it
off, tho' at last he did.
Akd now I name the poor Fellow once more, I must
take my last Leave of him j poor honest Friday I We bu-
ried him with all the Decency and Solemnity possible, by
putting him into a Coffin, aud throwing him into the Sea:
And I caused 'em to fire eleven Guns for him; and so
ended the Life of the most grateful, faithful, honest, and
most affectionate Servant that ever Man had.
. W e went now away with a fair Wind for JBrasih and
in about twelve Days time we made Land in the Latitude
of five Degrees South of the Line, being the North-Easter-
most Land of all that Part of America: We kept on S.
by E. in light of the Shore four Days, when we made
Cafe St. uiugujiine9 and in three Days came to an Anchor off
of the Bay of Æ-Samu, the old Place of my Deliverance,
from whence came both my good and evil Fate.
Never Ship came to this Part that had less Business
than I had j and yet it was with, great Difficulty that we
were admitted'to hold the least Correspondence on Shore,
not my Partner himielf, who was alive, and, made a great
Figure among them.} not my two Merchants Trustees,
nor the Fame of my wonderful Preservation in. the Island*
could obtain me that Favour: But my Partner remember*
ing, that I had given 5-00 Motdores to the Prior of the
Monastry of the jUtgustines, and- 37a to the Poor, went to
the Monastry, and obliged; the Prior that then was, to go
to the Governor, and get leave for me personally, with
the Captain, and one more, besides eight. Seamen, to come
on Shore, and. no more-; arid this upon Condition abso-
lutely capitulated fbr, that we should not offer to land any
Goods out of the Ship, or tp carry any Peison away with-
out. Licence. ,
They were so strict with us, as. to landing any Goods,
that it was, with extream Difficulty that I got on Shore
'three Bales of Engtijh Goods, such as sine broad Cloaths,
Stuffs, and some Linnen,. which I had brought for. a Pre-
sent to my Partner,.
He was a very generous broad hearted Man, tho' (lite
me) he came from little at first j and tho' he knew not
that I had the least Design of giving him any thing, he
sent me on Board a Present of fresh Provisions, Wine, and
Sweet-meats, worth above 30 Moidores, including some
Tobacco, andthree or four fine Medals in Gold: But I was
even with him in my Present, which, as I have laid, con-
fisted of sine broad Cloath, Englifl? Stuffs, Lace, and fine
Hollands: Also I delivers him about the Value of 100
Sterl. in the fame Goods for other Uses; and I oblig d
him to set up the Sloop which I had brought with me
from England, as I have said, for the Use ot my Colony,
in order to send the Refreshments I intended: to my Plan-
tation.
Accordingly, he got Hands, and finished the Sloop
m a very few Days, for she was already fiam'd, and I
gave the Master of her such Instructions, as he could not
miss the Place, nor did he miss them, as J bad an Account
from my Partner afterwards. I got him soon loaded with
the small Cargo I had sent them j and one of our Seamen
that had been on Shore with me there, offers to go with
the Sloop, and fettle there upon my Letter to the Gover-
nour Stanford, to allot him a sufficient Quantity of Land
for a Plantation j and giving him some Cloaths, and Tools
for his Planting-work, which he said he understood, hav-
ing been an old Planter at Maryland, and a Buckaneer into
the Bargain.
I encouraged the Fellow, by granting all he desired *
and as an Addition, I gave him the Savage, which we had
Taken Prisoner of War, to be his Slave, and order'd the Go-
yernour Spaniard to give him his Share of every thing
he wanted with the rest.
When we came to fit this Man out, my old Partner
told me, there was a certain very honest Fellow, a JBrafiiL
Planter of his Acquaintance, who had fallen into the Dis-
pleasure of the Church j I know not what the Matter is #
with him, fays he* but on my Conscience, I think he is an
Heretick in his Heart, and he has been oblig'd to conceal
himself for fear of the Inquisition 5 that he would be very
glad of £ieh an Opportunity to make his Escape with his-
*VVne and two Daughters j and if I would let them go to
jny Island, and allot them a Plantation* he would give
them
On)
them a small Stock to begin with > for the Officer? of the
Inquisition had seiz'd all his Effects and Estate, and he had
nothing left but a little Houfliold Stuff and two Slaves.
And, adds he, tho* I hate his Principles, yet I would not
have him fall into their Hands $ for he would assuredly be
burnt alive if he does. -
I granted this presently, and join'd my YngYijlmtm
with them, and we concealed the Man, and his "Wife and
Daughters on Board our Ship, till the Sloop put out, to go
to Sea j and then (having; put all their Goods on board the
Sloop, some time before) we put them oil board the SLoop*
after he was got out of the Bay.
Our Seaman was mightily pleasM with this new Part*
ncr i and their Stock indeed was much alike rich in Tools*
in Preparations, and a Farm, but nothing to begin with
but as above: However, they carried ovet with them
(which was worth all the rest)*ibme Materials for planting
Sugar Canes, with ibme Plants of Canes; which he, I
mean the Portugal Man; understood very welL
, Among the rest of the Supplies sent my Tenaqts m
the Island, I sent thenv by this Sloop, three Milch Cows,
and five Calves, about Twenty two Hogs among 'm% three
Sows big with Pig, two Mares, and a Stone4iotse.
F or my Spaniards, according to my Prorftfse, I engaged
three Portugal Women to go, and recommended it tdtilem
to marry them, and use them kindly. 1 could, have pro^
"cured more Women, but I remembered, that the poor per-
secuted Man had two Daughters; and there was but five
of the Spnmrds that wanted; -the rest had Wives of their
own, tho* in another Country. t; ;"
A ll this Cargo arriv'd safe, ind as you may easily sup-
pose, very welcome to my old Inhabitants, who were now
(with this Addition) between sixty and seventy People, be-
sides little Children; of which, there was a great many. I
found Letters at London from them all by Way of Lisbon,
, when I came back to England; being sent back tetheBra--
fits by this Sloop, of which .I shall take some Notice in its
Place.
I have now done with my Island, and all manlier of
Discourse about it; and whoever reads the rest of my Me-
morandums, would do well to turn his Thoughts entirely
from it, and expect to read only of the Tollies of an old
Man,
C *s* >
Man* not wam'd by his own Harms, much less by those,
of other Men, to beware of the like j not cool'd by almost
forty Years Misery and Disappointments, notsitisfy'd with.
Prosperity, beyond Expectation, not made cautious by Af-
fliction and Distress beyond. Imitation.
I had no more Business to go to the East-Indies, than
a Man at full Liberty, and having commuted no Crime,
has to go to the. Turn-key at Newgate, and deine him to
lock him up among the Prisoners there, and staivehim:
Had. I taken a small Vessel, from England, and went di-
rectly to the Island 5 had I loaded her, as I did the other
Vessel, with all the Neceslaries for the Plantation, and for
my.> People, took a Patent from the Government here, to
haveiecur'd my Property, in subjection only to that of
England* which to be sure I might have obtain'd j had I carried

went..
I SHOULD
I should only add here, that my honest: and truly pi-
ous Clergyman left me here; a Ship being ready to go to
Lisbon, he ask'd me Leave to go thither ; being still, as he
observed, bound never to finish any Voyage he began y how
happy had it been for me, if I had gone with him!
B u t it was too late now > all Things Heaven appoints
are best j had I gone with him, I had never had fb many
Things to be thankful for, and you had never heard of the
second Pait of the Travels and Adventures of Robin-
son Crusoe \ so I must leave here the fruitless exclaiming at
my self, and go on with my Voyage.
From the Brafils, we made directly away over the^r-
lantick Sea, to the Cape de ton Efperance, or as we call it,
the Cape os Good Hope; and had a tolerable good Voyage,
our Course generally South-East; now and then a Storm,
and seme contrary Winds, but my Disasters at Sea were
at an End j my future Rubs and cross Events were to
befal me on Shore j that it might appear, the Land was as
well prepar'd to < be our Scourge, as the Sea) when Hea-
ven, who directs the Circumstances of Things, pleases to
appoint it to be To.
Our Ship was on a Trading Voyage, and had a Supra
Cargo on board, who was to direct alt her Motions after
she arriv'd at the Cape $ only being limited to certain Num-
bers of Days, for stay, by Charter-party, at the several
Ports slie was to go to: This was none of my Business,
neither did I meddle with it at all j my Nephew, the Cap-
tain, and the Supra Cargo, adjusting all those~ Things be-
tween them, as they .thought fit,
\V £ made no slay at the Cape, longer than was needful,
to take in fresh Water $ but made the best of our way,
for the Coast of Coromandel; we were indeed informed,
that a Trench Man of War of fifty Guns, and two large
Merchant Ships, were gone for the Indies, and as I knew
we were at Wacwith France, I had some Apprehensions
•of them j but they went their own Way, and we heard no #
more of them.
I shall not pester my Account, or the Reader, with
Descriptions of Places, Journals of our Voyages, Variati-
ons of the Compass, Latitudes, Meridian Distances, Trade
..Winds,. Situation of Ports, and the like; such-as almost all
the Histories of long Navigation {are full of, and which
make
make the reading tiresome enough, and are perfectly un-
profitable to all that read, except only to those, who are
to go to those Places themselves.
I t is enough to name the Ports and Places, which we
touch'd at, and what occur'd to us upon our passing from
one to another: We touch'd first at the Island of Mada-
gascar j where, tho* the People^tre fierce and treacherous,
and in particular, very well arm'd^ith Launces and Bows,
which they use with inconceivable Dexterity, yet we fared
very well with them a while j they treated us very civil-
ly, and for sonic Trifles, which we gave them, iuch as
Knives, Scislars, they brought us eleven good fat
Bullocks5 middling in Size, but very good in Flesh > which
we took iiu partly for fresh Frovihons for our present
spending, and the rest to &k for the Ship's Use.
W e were obliged to stay here some time, after we had
furnish'd our selves with Provisions 5 and I, that was al-
ways too curious, to look into every Nook of the Woild
where-ever I came, was for going on Shore as often as I
could: It was on the East-side of the Island that we went
on Shore one Evening, and the People, who by the Way
are 'very numerous, came thronging about us, and stood
gating at us at a Distance: As we had traded freely with
them, and had been kindly used, we thought our selves in
no Danger 5 but when we law the People, we cut three
Boughs out of a Tree, and stuck them up at a Distance
from us, which it seems, is a Mark in the Country, not
only of Truce and Friendship, but when it is accepted, the
other Side set up three Poles or Boughs also, which is a
Signal, that they aceejt the Truce too \ but then, this is a
known Condition or the Truce, that you are not to pass
beyond their three Poles towards them, nor they come pail
your three Poles or Boughs, towards you 5 so that you are
perfectly secure within the three Poles, and all the Space
between your Poles and theirs, is allow'd like a Market,
# for free Converse, TrafHck and Commerce : When you go
there, you must not carry your Weapons with you 5 and if
they come into that Space, they stick up their JaveMnes and
Launces, all at the first Poles, and come on unarms
but if any Violence is offer'd them, and the Truce thereby
broken, away they run to the Poles, and lay hold of thek
Weapons* and thaa the Truce is at an End*
I*
It happen'd one Evening when we went on Shore, that
a greater Number of their People came down than usual,
but all was. very friendly and civil: They bi ought with them
several Kinds of Provisions, for which we satisfied them,
with such Toys as we had j their Women also brought us
Milk, aud Roots, and several Things very acceptable to us,
and all was quiet; and we made us a little Tent or Hut,
of some Boughs and Wrees, and lay on Shore all: that
Night. >
I'KNOw not what was thcr Occasion, but I was not so
- well satisfied to lie on Shore as the rest,- and the Boat ly->
ing at an Anchor, about a Stone's Cast from the Land? with
two Men in her to take Care of her* I made one of them
come on Shore, and getting some Boughs of Trees to co-
ver us also in the Boat, I spread the Sail on the Bottom of
the Boat, and Jay under the Cover on board of the Branches
of the Trees all Night.
About two a Clock in the M&rning, we heard one of
our Men- make a terrible Noile on the Shore, calling ou|
for God's Sake, to bring; the Boat in, and come and help
them, for they were all like to murther'd; at the fame
Time, I heard the firing of five Muskets, which was the
Number of the Guns they had, and that, three Times o-
ver , for it ieems, the Natives here were not fb easily
frighted with Guns, as the Savages were in America, where
I. had to do wkh them..
All this while, I knew not what wastheMatter,* but
rouzing immediately from Sleep with-the Noise, I caus'd
the Boat to be, thrust in, and resolved, with three Fusils we
had on, board, to land, and assist our Men.
W e got the Boat soon to the Shore, but our Men were
in two much haste: For being come to the Shore, they
plung'd into the Water, to get to the Boat, with all the
Expedition they could, being pursued by between three and
four hundred Men: Our Men. were but nine in all, aud
only five of them had Fusils with them j the rest indeed
had Pistols and Swords, but they .were of small. Use to *
them.
We took up seven of our Men, and with Difficulty
enough too, three of them being very ill wounded j and that
which was still worse, was, that while we stood in the Boat
to take our Men. in, we. were in as much Danger as they
were:
were in on Shore-j for they pour'd rheir Arrows in upon usfb
thick, that we were fain to barricade the Side of the Boat
tap with the Benches, and two or three loose Boards, which
to our great Satisfaction we had by meie. Accident, or
Providence mtker, in the Boat.
And yet, had it been Day-light, they are, it seems,
such exact Maiksinen, that if they could have ieen but the
least: Part of any of us, they would have been sure of us,
we had by the Light of the Moon a little Sight of them,
as they stood pelting us fiom the Shore with Darts and
Arrows j and having got ready our Fire-Arms,, we gave
them a Volley, and we could hear by the Cries of some
of them, that we had wounded several i however, they
stood thus in Battle-Array on the Shore 'till Break of Day*
which we suppose was, that they might; ice the better to
fcike their Aim at us.
I m this Condition we lay, and could not tell how to
weigh our Anchor, or iet up our Sail, because we must
needs stand up in the Eo^t, and they weic as sure to hit
us, as we we: e to hit a Bird in a Tree with small Shot s
we made Signals of Dress to the Ship, which, though we
rode a League off, yet my Nephew, the Captain, hearing
our Filing, and by Glasses,,perceiving the Postuie we lay
in, and that we fir'd towards the Shore, pretty well un-
derstood us; and weighing Anchor, wirhall Speeds he stood
as near the Shore as he durst with the Ship, and then
sent another Boat, with ten Hands in her, to assist us j but
we call d to them not to ceme too near, telling them what
Condition we were in; However, they stood in nearer tc*
us * and one of the Men, taking the End of a Tow-Line,
in his Hand, and- keeping our Boat between him and the.
Enemy, ib that they could not perfectly fee him, swam on.
board us, and Hi ade the Line raft to the Boat 5 upon which,
we stipp'd our little Cable, and'leaving our Anchor behind,
they tow d us out of the Reach of tire ^vrrows, we all
• the while lying close behind the Banicado we had
made.
As soon as we were-got from between the Ship and
the Shore, that she could lay her Side to the Shore, fha
run along just by them, and we pour'd in a Broad-side a-
mong them, loaden with Pieces qf hon and Lead, small
Bullets*
Bullets, and such Stuff, besides the great Shot;' which made
a terriblvc Havock among them.:
When we were got on board, and out of Danger, we
had Time to examine into the Occasion of this Fray r and
indeed our Supra-Cargo, who had been often in thplc Parts.,
put me upon it j -for he said, he was sure the Inhabitants
would not-have touch'd us, after we had made a Truce,
if we had not done something to provoke them to it: At
length it came out,-.(viz.) that an old Woman, who had
come to sell us some Milk, had brought it withhTour
Poles, with a young Woman with her, who also brought
some Roots or Herbs; and while the old Woman, whe-
ther she was Mother to the young Woman or* no, they
could not tell, was. setting us the Milk, one of our Men
ofTer'd some Rudeness to the Wench that was with her,
&t which the old Woman made a great Noise:. However,
the Seaman would not quit his Prize, but carried her out
of trie old Woman's Sight, among the Trees, it being al-
most: dark > the old Woman went away without her, and
as we suppose, made an Out-cry among the People fl.e
came from j who upon Notice, rais'd this great Army up-
on us in three or four Hours 5 and it was great Odds> but
we had been all destroy'd, 5
One of our Men was killed, with a Launce that was
thrown at him, just "at the Beginning of she Attack, as he
ialley'd out of the Tent we liad made 5 the rest came off
free, all but the Fellow who was the Occasion of all the
Mischief, who paid dear enough for his black Mistress$ for
we could not hear what became of him, a -great while,* we
lay upon the Shore two Days after, though tire Wind -pre-,
jfented, and made Signals for him 5 made our Boat fail up
Shore and down Shore,' several Leagues, but in vain; io
we were oblig'd to give him over, and if he alone had suf-
fers for it, the Loss had been* the Jess*
I could not satisfy my felt) however, without ven-
turing on Shore once more, to try if I could learn any •
Thing of him, or them; it was the third Night after the
Action, that I had a great Mind to learn, if I could by any
Means, what Mischief we had done, aud how the Game
stood on the Indians Side: I was. careful to do it in the
dark, lest we should be attaqu'd again > but I ought indeed ,
to have been sure, that the Men I went with, had been un-
- j
der my Command, before I cngag'd in a Thing so hazar-
dous and mischievous, as I was Drought into by it, without
my Knowledge or Design.
We took twenty stout Fellows.with us as any in the
Ship, besides the Supra-Cargo and my self, and we landed
two Hours before Midnight, at the lame Place where the
Indians stood drawn up the Evening before* I landed here,
1- ecu se my Design, as I have said, was chiefly to see if
they had quitted the Field, and if they had left any Marks
behind them of the Mischief we had done them ; and I
thought, if we could surprize one or two of them,
perhaps we might get our Man again by Way of Ex-
change.
V/ e landed without any Noise, and divided our Men in-
to two Companies, whereof, the JBoatswain commanded
one, and I the other : We neither could hear nor see any
body stir when we landed, so we marched up, one Body at
a Distance from the other, to the Field of Battle: At first
we could see nothing, it being very dark j but by and by,
our Boatswain, that led the first Party, stumbled and fell
over a dead Boy > this made them halt a while, for know-
ing by the Circumstances that they were at the Place where
the Indians had stood, they waited for my" coming up ,*
here we concluded to halt 'till the Moon began to rise,
which we knew would be in less than an Hour -> and then
we could easily diseern the Havock we had made among
them 5 we told two and thirty Bodies upon the Ground,,
whereof two were not quite dead: Some had an Aim,
and some a Leg shot off, and one his Head $ those
that were wounded we supposed, they had carried a-
way. * -
When we had made, as I thought, a full Discovery of
of all we could come at the Knowledge oft I was for go-
ing on Board again; but the Boatswain and his Party of
ten, sent me Word, that they were relblv'd to make a Vi-
• fit to the Indian Town, where these Dogs, as they calFd
them, dwelt, and desiVd me to go along with them j and
if they could find them, as still they fansied they should,
they did not doubt, they said, getting a good Booty, and
it might be, they might find Tho. jeffry there, that was
the Man's Name we had loft.
Had
Had 'they sent to ask my Leave to go, I knew well
enough what Answer to have given them j for I would
have commanded them instantly on board, knowing it was
not a Hazard fit for us to run; who had a Ship, and Ship's
Loading in our Charge, and a Voyage to make, which de-
pended very much upon the Lives of the Men i but as they
sent me Word they were resolved to go, and only ask'd me
and my Company to go along with them I positively re-
fus'd. it, and rose up, for J -was fitting on the Ground* m
order to go to the Boat,- one or two of the Men, began to
importune me to go, and when I still refus'd positively, be-
gan to grumble, and fay they were not under my Com-
mand, and they would go: Come sack, fays one of the
Men, will you go with me? Fll go for one j Jack laid he
would, and another followed, and then another and in a
Word, they all left me but one, who, with much Difficul-
ty too, I persuaded to stay; so thcSupra-Cargc and I, with
the third Man, went back to the Boat, where, I told them,
we would stay for them, and take Care to take in as many
of them as should be left j for / told 3em it was a mad Thing
they were going about, and supposed most of 'em would
imi the Fate of Tho, Jeffry*
They told me, like Seamen, they'd warrant it they
would come off again, and they would take care, &c So
away they went: I entreated 'em to consider the Ship and
the Voyage that their Lives were not their own, and
that they were entrusted with the Voyage in some mea-
sure y that if they miscarry'i the Ship might be lost for
want of their Help, and that they could not answer it to
God or Man:: 1 laid a great deal- more to 'era on that
Head, buM might as well have talk'd to the Main-Mast of the
Ship, they were mad upon- their Journey, only they gave
me good Words, and begg'd- I would not be angry j laid,
they would be very cautious* and they did not doubt but
they would be back again in about an Hour at farthest
for the Indian Town, they laid, was not above half a Mile •
*>fF: Tho' they found it above two Miles before they got ta
it.
Well, they all went away, as above j and tho'the
Attempt was, desperate, and such, as none but Madmen
would have gone about, yet to give 'em their due, they
went
went about it warily as well as boldly >; They were galant-
]y armed, that's true; for they had every Man a Fuzee or
Musket, a Bayonet, and every Man a Pistoi ,* some of them
had broad Cutlasses, some of them Hangers and the Boat-
swain and two more had^ Pole-Axes: Belides all which,
they had among them Thirteen Hand-Grenadoes : Bolder
Fellows, and better provided, never went about any wick-
ed Work in the World.
W wen they went out, their chief Design was Plunder,
and rhey were in mighty hopes of finding Gold there j but a
Circumstance which none of them were aware of, set
them on fire with Revenge, and made Devils of them all:
When they came to the few Indian Houses, which they
thought had been the Town, which was not above half a
Mile off, they were under a great Disappointment, for
there were not above i z or thirteen Houses,, and where
the Town was, or how big, they knew not : They con-
sulted therefore what to do, and were some time before
they could reiblve; For if they fell upon these, they must
cut all their Throats, and it was- ten to one but some
of them might escape, it being in the Night, tho' the
Moon was up > and if one escaped, he would run away,
and raise all the Towns, so they should havea whole Army
upon them : Again, on the other baud, if they went a-
way and left those untouch'd (for the People were all
ajleep) they could not tell which Way to look for the
Town.
H o w e v e r, , the last was the best Advice 5 so they re-
solved to leave those Houses, and look for the Town as
well as they could ; They went on a little way, and found a
Cow tied to a Tree; this they preseutly concluded, would
be a good Guide to them j for they laid, the Cow certain-
ly belonged to the Town before them, or the Town be-
hind them ,, and, if they untied her, they should see which
Way she went j if she went back they liad nothing to lay
, to her j but if she went forward, they had nothing to do
but to follow her, so they cut the Cord, which was made
of twisted Flags, and the Cow went on before them ; in
. a Word, the Cow led them directly to the Town, which
as they reported, consisted of above 200 Houses, or Huts;
and in some of these, they found several Families living
together.
Here
Here they found all Silent j as profoundly secure, as
Sleep, and a Country that had never seen an Enemy of
that Kind, could make them j upon this, they caU'd another
Council to consider what they had to do ; and in a Word,
they resolve! to divide themselves into three Bodies, and to
set three Houses cn Fire in three" Parts of the Town > and
as the Men came out, to sciz,e them and bind them 5 if any re-
fisted, they need not be ask'd what to do then, and ib to
search the rest of the Houses for Plunder j but they re-
scind to march silently first, thro* the Town, and see what
Demenfions it was oft and Consider if they might ventu t
upon it, or no.
They did so, and desperately resolv'd that they would
venture upon them; but while they were animating one
another to the Work, three of them that were a little be-
fore the rest, call out aloud, and told them they had found
Thorn. Jeffry; they all ran up to the Place, and so it was
indeed, for there they found the poor Fellow, Jiang'd up
naked by one Arm, and his Throat cut; there was an In-
dian House just by the Tree, where they found sixteen or
seventeen of the principal Indians who nad been conceiisd
in the Fray with us before, and two or three of them
wounded with our Shot j and our Men found they were
awake, and talking one to another in that House, but knew
not their Number.
The Sight of their poor mangled Comrade so enrag'd
Jem, as before, that they swore to one another they would
be reveng'd, and that not an Indian who came into their
Hands should have Quarter, and to work they went imme-
diately; and yet not so madly as by the Rage and Fury
they were in, might be expected: Their first Care was to
get something that would soon take Fire, but after a little
search, they found that would be to no purpose, for most
•of the Houses were low, and Thatchwith Flags or Rushes,
of which the Country is full s so they presently made some
wild Fire, as we call it, by wetting a little Powder in the »
Palms of their Hands, and in a quarter of an Hour they
set the' Town on Fire in spur or five Places; and particu-
larly that House where the Indians were not gone to Bed.
As soon as the Fire began to blaze, the poor frighted Crea-
tures began to rusti out to {ave their Lives >• but met with
their Fate in the Attempt, and especially at the Door, where
they drove them back, the Boatswain himself killing one
or two with his Pole-Ax; The House being large, and
many in it, he did not care to go in, but calTdfor aHand-
Grenado, and threw it among 'em, which at first frighted
'cm ; but when it burst, made such Havock among ,em,
that they cried out in a hideous manner.
I n short most of the Indians who were in the open Part
of the House, were kill'd or hurt with the Grenado, except
two or three more who prefs'd to the Door,which theBoat-
swa'n and two more kept with their Bayonets in the Muzzles
of their Pieces, and difpatch'd all who came that Way. But
there was another Apartment in the House where the Prince
or King, or whatsoever he was, and several others were,
and these they kept in till the House, which was by this
time all of a light Flame, fell in upon them, and they were
fmother'd or burnt together.
All this while they hYd not a Gun, because they
would not waken the People faster than they could master
them i but the Fire began to waken them fast enough,
and our Fellows were glad to keep a little together in bo-
dies; for the Fire grew foraging, all the Houses being made
of light combustible Stuff, that they could hardly bear the
Street between them, and their Business was to follow the
Fire for the stirer Execution: As fast as the Fire either fore'd
the People out of those Houses which were burning, or
frighted them out of others, our People were ready at their
Doors to knock them on the Head, still calling and hol-
lowing to one another to remember Tho. Jjffrjs.
While this was ,doing, I must confess I was very un-
easy, and especially when I &w the Flames of the Town,
which, it being Night, seem'd to be just by me.
M y Nephew, the Captain, who was rouzJd by his Men
too, seeing such a Fire was very uneasy, not knowing
what the Matter was, or what Danger I Was in; especi-
ally hearing the Guns- too, for by this: time they began to
• use "their Fire-Arms $ a thousand Thoughts opprest Ms
Mind concerning me, and the Supra-Cargo, what should
become of us r^Atid at last, though he could ill spare any
mbre Men, yet not knowing what Exigence we might be
in, he takes another Boat, and with 13 Men and himself*
comes on: Shore to rne.
 
Ha
H e was furpriz'd to see me and the Supar-Cargo in the
Boat with no more than two Men, for one had been left
to kcepthe Boat; and tho* he was glad rhat we were well,
yet he was in the fame Impatience with us to know what
was doing; for the Noise continifd and the Flame en-
creas'd: I Confess, it was next to an Impossibility for any
Men in the World to restrain their Curiosity of knowing,
what had happen'd, or their Concern for the Safety of the
Men : In a Word, the Captain told me, he would go and
help his Men, let what would come: I argu'd with him
as I did before with the Men, the Safety of the Ship, and
the Danger of the Voyage, the Interest of the Owners and
Merchants, &c. and tokl him, I would go and the two
Men, and only fee if we could at a Distance learn what
was like to be the Event, and come back and tell him.
I t 'was all one, to talk to my Nephew, as it was to
talk to the rest before > he would go, he said, and he only
wifh'd he had left but ten Men in the Ship; for he could
not think of having his Men lost for want of Help, he had
rather, he said> loose the Ship, the Voyage, and his Life
and all; and so away went he.
Nor was I any more able to stay behind now, than I
was to persuade them not to go before; so in short, the
Captain order'd two Men to row back the Pinnance, and
fetch twelve Men more from the Ship, leaving the Long-
Boat at an Anchor, and that when they came back, iix
Men should keep the two Boats and fix more come after
us 5 so that he left only 16 Men in the Ship; for the whole
Ship's Company consisted of 6y Men, whereof two were
lost in the first Quarrel, which brought this Mischief on.
Being now on the march, you may be lure we felt
little of the Ground we trode on; and being guided by the
Fire, we kept no Path, but went directly to the Place of
the Flame: If the Noise of the Guns was surprizing to us
before, the Cries of the poor People were now of quite
another Nature, and filPd us with Horror: I must con- •
fefs I never was at the lacking of a City, or at the taking
of a Town, by Storm, I have heard of Oliver Cromwell
taking Drogheda in Ireland, and killing Man, Woman and
Child : And I load read of Count Tilly, sacking of the City
of Magdeburgh, and cutting the Throats of 2,2000 of all
Sexes:
Sexes: But I never had an Idea of the Thing itself before,
nor "is it possible to describe it, or the Horror which was
upon our Minds at hearing it.
However, we went on, and at length came to the
Town, tW there was no entring the Streets of it for the
Fire: The first Object we met with, was the Ruins of a
Hut or House, or rather the A<hes of it, for the House was
consiim'dj and just before it, plain now to be seen by the
Light of the Fire, lay four Men and three Women kill d i
and as we thought, one or two more lay in the Heap a-
mong the Fire: In short, there were such Instances of a
Rage altogether barbarous, and of a Fury, something be*
yond what was human, that we thought it impossible our
Men could be guilty of it j or if they were the Authors of
it, we thought that every one of 'em ought to be put to
the worst of Deaths: But this was not all, we saw the
Fire encreasd forward, and the Cry went on just as the
Fire went on, Ib that we were in the utmost Confusion i
We advane'd a little Way farther, and beheid, to our Asto-
nishment, three Women naked, crying in a most dread-
ful Manner, and flying, as if they had indeed had Wiugs,
and after them sixteen or seventeen Men, Natives, in the
lame Terror and Consternation, with three of our Engltfo
Butchers, for I can call them no better, in their Rear j who,
when they could not overtake them, sir'd in among them,
and one that was kill'd by their Shot fell down in our
Sight j when the rest law us, believing us to be their Ene-
mies, and that we would murther them as, well as those
that pursued them, they set up a most dreadful Shreik, e-
specially the Women j and two of them fell down as if
already dead with the Fright. * 
M y very Soul shrunk within me, and my Blood run
chil in my Veins, when I law this; and I believe, had the
three English Sailors, that pursued them, come on, I had
made our Men kill them all; However, we took/ome Ways
• to let the poor flying Creatures know, thas we would not
hiirtthem, and immediately they came up to us, and kneel-
ing down, with their Hands lifted up, made pitious La-
mentation to us to save them, which we let them know
we would do j whereupon they kept altogether in a Huddle
close behind us for Protection: I left my Men drawn up
together* and charg'd them to hurt no body, but if possible
H to
to get at some of our People, and fee what Devil it was
poJlefs-d them, and what they intended to do and, in a
Word, to command them oft; assuring ,them, that if they
stay'd till Day-light they would have an hundred thousand'
Men about their Ears: I fay, I left them, and went among
thole flying People,' taking only two of our Men with
me j and there was indeed a pitious Spectacle amongthem:
Some of them had their Feet terribly burnt with trampling
and running thro' the Fire, others their Hands burnt, one
of the Women had fallen down in"'the Fire, and was al-
most burnt to Death before she could get out again; two
or three of the Men had Cuts in their-1 Backs and Thighs
from our Men pursuing 5 and another was shot thro' the
Body, and died while 1 was there.
I would fain have learned what the Occasion of all
this was, but I could not understand one Word they said j
tho' by Signs I perceieved that some of them knew not
what was the Occasion themselves: I was so terrified in
my Thoughts at this outrageous Attempt, that I could not
flay there, but went back to my own Men; I told them
my Resolution, and commanded them to follow me, when
in. the very Moment came four of our Men with the Boat-
swain at their Head, roving over the Heaps of Bodies they
had kill'd, all cover'd with Blood and Dust, as if they want-
ed more People to maslacre, when our Men hallow'd to
them as loud as they could hallow, and with much ado
one of them made them hear; lb that they knew who we
were, and came up to us.
As soon as the'Boatswain saw us, he set up, a Hallow
like a Shout of Triumph, for having, as he thought, more
I fclp come, and without bearing to hear me, Captain, fays
he, Noble Captain, I am glad you are come j we have not
half done yet j Villains'! Hell-hound Dogs! I'll kill as many
of them as poor Tom. has Hairs upon his Head. We have
sworn to spare none of them, we'll root out the very Na-
tion of 'em from the Earth; and thus he run on, out of •
Breath too with Action, and would riot give u$ Leave to
ipcak a Word. • /' (
A t last, raising my Voice; that t might' silence him a *
little 5 Barbarous Dog\ fatd Jf, what are you doing? I won't
have one Creature touch'd. more, upon Pain of Death: I"
charge
t
(171 >
charge you upon your Life, to stop your Hands, and stand
still here, or yon are a dead Man this Minute,
Wh y9 Sir, fays he, Do you know what you do, or rrbat
they have done? If you want a Reason for what we have
done, come hither \ and with that he shew'd me the
poor Fellow hanging upon the Tree with his Throat cut.
1 confess, I was urg'd then my self, and at another
Time should hare been forward enough but I thought
they had carried their Rage too far, and thought of Jacob s
Words to his Sons Simeon and Levi ,* Cursed be their. Anger,
for it was fierce , and their Wrath> for it was cruel: But
I had now a new Task upon my Hands; for when the
Men I carried with me saw the Sight as I had done, I had
as much to do to restrain them, as I should have had with
the other,- nay, my Nephew himself fell-in with them, and
- told me in their hearing, that he was only concerned for
fear of the Men being overpower'd, for as to the People,
he thought not one of 'em ought to lire 5 for they had
all glutted themselves with the Murther of the poor Man,
and that they ought to be used like Murtherers : Upon
these Words, away run eight of my Men with the Boat-
swain and his Crew, to compleat their bloody Work j and
I seeing it quite out of my Power to restrain them, came
away pensive and. fad j for I, could not bear the Sights much
leis the horrible Noise and Cries of the poor Wretches that
fell into their Hands.
I g o t no body to come back with me but the Supra*
Cargo and two Men 5 and with these I walk d baclc to
the Boats: It was a very great Piece of Folly in- me*
I confess, to venture back, as it were alone ,* for as it
began now to be almost Day, and the Alarm had run'
over the Country, there stood about 40 Men arm'd with
Launces and Bows at rhelrttle Place where the 12 or 15*
Houses stood mention'd before; but by Accident I mifs'cf
. the Place, and came directly to the Sea-side, and by the
Time T got to the Sea-side it was broad Day; immediately*
I took the Pinnace, and went a-board, and sent her back to>
assist the Men in what might happen.
I ob-serv'd that about the Time I came to the Boat*-:
fide, the Fire was pretty well out, and the Noise a*-
bated; but in about half an Hour after I got on board, £
heard a Volley of our Men's Fire-Arms, and law a great
Hi Smoakg
Smoak; this, as I understood afterwards was our Men fal-
ling upon the forty Men, who, as I said, stood at the few
Houses on the Way; of whom they kiil'd sixteen or seven-
teen, and set all those Houses on Fire, but did not meddle
with the Women or Children.
B y that Time the Men got to the Shore again with
the Pinnace, our Men began to appear j they came drop-
ping in, some and some j not in two Bodies, and in Form
as they went out, but all in Heaps, straggling here, and
there, in such a Manner, that a small force of resolute
Men might have cut them all off.
But the Dicad of them was upon the whole Country:
The People were arnaz'd, and surpriz'd, and so flighted,
that I believe a hundred of 'em would have fled at the
Sight of but five of our Men. Nor in all this terrible Ac-
tion was there a Man who made any considerable De-
fence j they were so surpriz'd between the Terror of the
Five, and the sudden Attaque of our Men in the Dark, that
they knew not which Way to turn themselves , for if
they fled one Way, they were met by one Party, if back
again, by another; Ib that they were every where knock'd
down: Nor did any of our Men receive the least Hurt,
except one who strains his Foot, and another had one of
his Hands very much burnt.
I was very angry with my Nephew the Captain, and
indeed with all the Men, in my Mind, but with him in par-
ticular 5 as well for his acting so out of his Duty, as Com-
mander .of the Ship, and having the Charge of the Voy-
age upbn him, as m his prompting, rather than cooling,
the Rage of his Men, in so bloody and cruel an Enterprize:
My Nephew anfwcr'd me very respectfully, but told me,
that when he iay the Body of the poor Seaman, whom
they had mui ther'd in such' a cruel and barbarous Manner,
he was not Master of himself, neither could he govern his
Passion: Hc? o.wn'd, he (liquid not have done ib, as he
was Commander of the Ship; but as he was a Man, and *
Nature mov'd him, he could not bear it: As for the rest
of the Men, they were not subject to me at all, and they
knew it well enough; fb they took no notice of my Di£
like, " l~
The next Day we set sail, Co we never heard any more
of it: Our Men dister'd in the Account of the Number
they
t
they kill'd: Some said one Thing, some another; but ac-
cording to the best of their Accounts put altogether,
they kill'd or destroy*d about iso People, Mcn^ Wo-
men, and Children, and left not a House standing in she
Town.
As for the poor Fellow, Tho. Jejfrys, as he was quite
dead, for his Throat was ib cut, that his Head was half
oft," it would do him no Service to bring him away, so
they left him where they found him, only took him
down from the Tree where he was hang'd by one
Hand.
However just our Men thought this Action to be, I was
against them in it; and I always after that Time, told
them, God would blast the Voyage, for I look'd upon all
the Blood they shed that Night to be Murther in them:
For tho' it is true, that they nad kilTd Tho. J-eflrys, yet it
was as true, that feffrys was the Aggressor, had broken
the Truce, and had violated or debauch'd a young Woman
of theirs, who came to our Camp innocently j and on the
Faith of their publick Capitulation.
The Boatswain defended this Quarrel when we were after-
wards on board: He said, It was true, that wefap'd to break
the Truce, but reaHy had not, and that the War was begun
the Night before by the Natives themselves, who had shot at
us, andkill'd one of pur Men without any just Provocation;
so that as we were in a Capacity to fight them, we might
also be in a Capacity to do our selves Justice upon them, in
an extraordinary Manner -} that tho' the poor Man had taken
a li tele Liberty with a Wench, he ought not to have been mur-
ther'd, and that in such a villainous Manner: And that they
did nothing but what was, just, and what the Laws of
God allow 3 to be done to Murthercrs.
One would think this should have been enough to have
warn'd us, against going on Shore among Hear hens and
Barbadians; But it is impossible to make Mankind wiie,
• but at their own Expence,* and their Expedience seems
to be always of most Use to them, when it is dexest
bought.
We were now bound to the GiriphofP<?r/£t, and from
thence to the Coast of CoromandeU only to touch at Sur-
ras: But the chief of the Sufrit-Cargfs Deiign lay at the
Bay of Bengale, where, if he miss'd of his Bufjies- out-
H i ward
ward bound, he wss to go up to China, and return to the
Coast as he came Home.
The first Disaster that befel us, was in the Gulph of
Terfia, where five of our Men venturing on Shore, on the
Arabian Side of the Gulph, were surrounded by the Arabs,
and either all kill'd, or carried away into Slavery 5 the rest
.of the Boat's Crew were not able to rescue them, and had
but just Time to get off their Boat . I began to upbraid
them with the just Retribution of Heaven in this Case,
Sbut the Boatswain very warmly told me, he thought I
went farther in my Censures, than I could shew any War-
rant for in Scripture, and referr'd to the 13th St. Lttke,
Verse 4th, where our Saviour intimates, that those Men,
on whom the Tower of Si loam fell, were not Sinners a-
hove all the Galileans 5 but that which indeed put me to
Silence in the Case, was that none of these five Men, who
were now lost, were of the Number of those who went
on Shore to the Massacre of Madagascar > (so I always call'a*
it, thc> our Men could net bear the Word MaiTacre with any
patience;) And indeed, this last: Circumstance, as I have
laid, put me to Silence for the present.
Bdt my frequent preaching to them on this Subject,
,had worse Consequences than I expected 5 and the Boat-
swain, who had been the Head of the Attempt, came up
boldly to me one Time, and told me, he found, that I
continually breught that Afiair upon the Stage, that I made
unjust Reflections upon it, and had used the Men very ill
on that Account, and himself in particular; that as I
was but .a Pallenger, and had no Command in the Ship,
or Concern in the Voyage, they were not oblig'd to bear
ir j that they did not know, but I might nave some
ill Design in my Head, and perhaps to call them to Ac-
count for it, when they came to England} and that there-
fore, unless-1 would resolve to have done with it j and al-
also, not to concern my self any farther with him, or
any of his Affairs, he would leave the Ship; for he •
did not think it was safe to sail with me among
them.
I heard him patiently enough till he had done, and
tl en told him, that I did confess I had all along oppos'd
the MaJJacree of Madagascar, for such I would always call
it i and that I had on all Occasions spoken my Mind free-
ly about it, tho' not more upon him than any of the rest,
that as to my having no Command in the Ship, that
was true: nor did I exercise any Authority, only took my
Liberty of speaking my Mind in Things which publickly
concern'd us all, as to what Concern I had in the Voyage,
that was none of his Business; I was a considerable Owner
of the Ship; and in that Claim I conceived I had a Right
to speak, even farther than I had yet done, and would not
be accountable to him or any one else, and begun to be a
little warm with him: He made but little Reply to me at
that Time, and I thought that Affair had been over: We
were at this, Time in the Road of BengaU, and being wil-
ling to see the. Place, I went on Shore with the Supra-Cargo
in the Ship's Boat, to divert my self, and towards Even-
ing, was preparing to go on Board, when one of tlie
Men came to me, and told me, he would not have me
trouble my self to come down to the Boat, for they had
Orders not to carry me oh Board ,' any one may guess
what a Surprize- I was in* at ib iniblent a Menage 5 and I
ask'd the Man, Who bad him deliver that Errand to me •?
He told me, the Cockswain: I (kid no more £0 the Fel-
low, but bad him let them know he had deliver'd his Mes-
sage, and that I had given him no Answer to it,
I immediately went and found out the Supra-Cargo, and
told him the Story, adding what I presently foresaw,
That there would certainly be a Mutiny in the Ship, and
intreated him to go immediately on Board c|ie Ship in an
Indian Boat, and acquaint the Captain of it; but I might
ha' spar'd this Intelligence, for before I had spoken to
him on Shore, the Matter was effected on Board, the
Boatswain, the Gunner, the Carpenter j and, in a Word,
all the Inferior Officers, as soon as I was gone, off in the
Boat, came up to the Quarter-Deck, and dehVd to speak
with, the Captain, and there the Boatswain making a long
Harangue, for the Fellow ralk'd very well, and repeating
all he had said to me, t^i the Captain in few Words,
that as I was now gone peaceably on; Shojie, they were
loath to use any.Violenf9'\witl;;jn^f\cwiiie'h,'if I had not
gone on Shore, they would otherwise }iavedone3 to oblige
me to have gone: They therefore tho^ht fit.*o tell him,
that as they lhipp'd themselves to serve in the Ship under
H 4 his
his Com mane?, they would perform it faithfully, But i£ I
would not quit trie Ship, or the Captain oblige me to
quit it, they would all leave the Ship, and sail no farther
with him > and at that Word ALL, he turn'd his Face
about towards the Main-mast, which was it seems the
Signal agreed on between them j at which all the Seamen
bein^ got together, they cry'd out, One and ALL, One
and ALL.
My Nephew, the Captain, was a Man of Spirit, and of
great Presence of Mind, and tho' he was surpriz'd, you
may be sure, at the Thing, yet he told them calmly, that
he would consider of the Thing, but that he could do no-
thing in it, till he had spoken to me about it,- He usrd
ib ne Arguments with them, to shew them the Unreason-
ableness and Injustice of the Thing, but it was all in vain,
they swore and shook Hands round, before his Face, that
they would go all on Shore, unless he would engage to
them, not to iuffer me to come onboard the Ship.
This was a ha'd Article upon him, who knew his Q-
bligation to me, and did not know how I might take it.,*
so he began-to talk cavalierly to them, told them that I
was a very considerable Owner of the Ship, and that in
Justice he could not put me out of my own House; that
this was next Door to serving me, as the famous Pirate
Kid had done, who made the Mutiny in a Ship, set the
Captain on Shore in an uninhabited Island, and ruo away
v/irh the Sh'p; that let them go into what Ship they
v on Id, if ever they came to England again, it would cost
them dear j that the Ship was mine, and that he would not
put me out of it \ and that he would rather, lose the Ship
and the Voyage too, than disoblige me ib muefrj io they
might do as they pleased: However, he would go on Shore,
and* talk with me on Shore, and invited the Boatswain to
so with him, and perhaps they might accommodate the
lattter with me.
But they all rejected the Proposals and said, they would #
hove nothing to do with me any more, neither on boaref,
nor on Shore," and if I came on board, they would go on
Shore j Well, said the .Captain, if you are all on this Mind,
let me go on Shore and talk with him ; io away he came
to me with this Account, a little after the Meslage had been
brought to me from the CQckswain.
T w as
I was very glad to see my.Nephew, I must confess;
for I was not without Apprehensions, that they would
confine him by Violence, set fail, and run away with the
Ship, and then I had been strip'd naked in a remote Conn-
try, and nothing to help my self: In short, I had been in
in a worse Case, than when I was all alone in the Island.
But they had not come that length, it seems, to my
great Satisfaction; and when my Nephew told me what
they had said to him, and how they had sworn, and shook
Hands, that they would one and all leave the Ship, if I was
suffer'd to come on board, I told him, he mould not be
concerns at it at all, for I would stay on Shore *, I only
dehYd he would take Care and send me all my necessary
Things on Shore, and leave me a sufficient Sum of Mo-
ney, and I would find my Way to England^ as well as I
could.
. This was a heavy Piece of News to my Nephew * bit
there was no Way to help it, but to comply with it; So,
in short, he went on board the Ship again, and satisfy d
the Men, that his Uncle had yielded to their Importunity,
and had sent for his Goods from on board the Ship * lo
the Matter was over in a very few Hours, the M<*n re-
turns to their Duty, and I began to consider what Course
Ishould steer.
r w a s-now alone in the remotest Part of the World,
as I think I may call it; for I was near three thousand
Leagues by Sea farther off from England, than I was at my
Island j only it is true, I might travel hei e by Land over
the Great Moguls Country to Sur art e> might go from
thence to Baffora by Sea, up the Gulph of Perj<a, and from
thence might take the Way of the Caravans, over the Desarts
of Arabia to Aleppo and Seandarocn; from thence by Sea again
to Italy, and so over Land into Francs, and this pin together
might be at least a. full Diameter of the Globe; but" if it
were to be measur d, I suppose it would appear to be a
great deal more.
I had another Way before me, which was to wait for
seme English Ships, which were coming to Bengal ftom
Achm on the Island of Sum/tfra, and get Paiftge on board
them for England: But as I'eame hither without any Con-
cern with the English Eaft-bidid Comym^ji so it would be
difficult to go from hence without their License, unless
H f 'with
with great Favour of the Captains of the Ships, or o
the Company's- Factors, and to both, I was an utt
Stranger.
H e r e I had the particular Pleasure, speaking by Con-
traries, to fee the Ship set sail without me; a Treatment,
I think, a Man in my Circumstances scarce ever met witJ\
except fiom Pirates running away with a Ship, and letting
those that would not agree with their Villany on Shore,
indeed this was next Door to- it,, both Ways however,
my Nephew left me two Servants, or rather, one Compa-
ssion, and one Servant, the first: was Clerk to the Purser,
who he engag'd to go with me, and the other was his
own Servant; I took me also a goodLodging in the House
of an English Woman, where several Merchants lodg'd j some
Erench, two Italians, or rather Jews, and one Englipiman:
Here I was handsomely enough entertained; and that I
might not be said to run rastily upon any Thing, I stay'd
here above nine Months, considering what Course to take,
and how to manage my self: I had some Englifi Goods
with me of Value, and a considerable Sum of Money,
my Nephew furnishing me with a thousend Pieces of
Fight, and a Letter of Credit for more, if I had Occa-
sion, that 1 might not be straiten'd whatever might hap-
pen.
I qjo ickly dispos'd of my Goods, and'to Advantage
too i and, as I originally intended, I bought here some ve-
ry good Diamonds whiG&, of, all other Things-, was the
most proper for me, in my Circumstances, because I might
always carry my whole Estate about me..
After a long Stay here, and many Proposals made for
my Return to England, but none falling to my Mind, the
English Merchant who lodged with me, and with whom
I had contracted' an intimate Acquaintance, came to me
one Morning ;: Countryman, says he, I have a Project to:
communicate to. you, which, as it. sorts with my Thoughts,
may, for ought I know, suit with yours also, when you.
toll have thoroughly considered it.
Here we are posted, fays he,, you by Accident, and I'
bv my owa Choice, in a Part of the World very remote
fiom our own Country , but it is in a Country, where*,
by us who understand Trade and Business, a great deal o£
irtoncy is, tQ be got :,if you will gut a. thousand,Pounds to*
my
my thouiaud Pounds, we will hire a Ship here, the first'we
can get to pur Minds j you shall be Captain, I'll be Mer-
chant, and we will go a Trading Voyage to China $ for
what should we-stand still for? The whole World is in
Motion, rowling round and round j ail the Creatures of
God, heavenly Bodies and earthly, are busy and diligent,
Why should we be idle? There are no Drones, says he, liv-
ing in the World but Men, Why should we be of that
Number? ,:
I li k\ t> his, Proposal very well, and the.more, '.because
it seem'd -to be express d with* so much good Will, and in
so friendly a Manner: I will not -fay,, but that I might, by
my loose and unhing'd Circumstances, be the fitter to em-
brace a Proposal for Trade, and indeed for any Thing else;
or, otherwise, Trade was none of my Element: However,
I might perhaps lay with some Truth, "that if Trade was not
my Element, Rambling was; and no Proposal for seeing any
Part of the World which I had never seen before, coul.l
postibly come amiss to me.
I t. was, however, Ibme time before we could get a Ship
to our Minds;, and when we had got a Veflei, it was noc
ealy to get Znglifl} Sailors that is to lay, lo many as
were neceslary to govern the Voyage, and manage the Sai-
lors which we mould pick up there: After some time we
got a Mate, a Boatswain, and a Gunner, Engliflj j'a Dutch1 Car-
jpenter, and three Portuguese Fore-mast Men \ with these,
we found, we couki flo well enough,! having Indian Sea-
men, such as they-are,'to make up. -.
T h ere are so .nVariy Travellers' who have written the
History of their Voyages and Travels this Way, that it
.would be but very littie Diversion to any body, to give
a long Account of the Places we went to, and the People
who inhabit there: Those Things 1 leave to others, and
refer the Reader to those journals and Travels of Englifi-
mm, of which, many -1 find are publistid, and more pro-
jmVd every Day j *tis enough fa me io tell you* that we
made the Voyage to Athin* in the Iflaad' of Sumatra first,
^nd from thence to Siam, where we exchang'd some of
our Wares for Opium, and for some Arrack* the first, a
Commodity which bears .a great Price among the Chinese,
and which at that Time, was very much wanted there j in a
"Word* we went up to Su/Jian, made a very great Voyage,
was
 
was eight Mounths out, and returns to Bengate3and I was
ve y well'fatisfy'd with my Adventure: I obfervethat our Peo-
ple in England, often admire how the Officers which
the Company said into India, and the Merchants
which gene ally stay there, get such very great Estates as
they do, and sometimes come Home worth 6 a, to. 70 and
100 thouiand Pounds* at a Time^.
But it is.no Wonder, or at least we shall see so much
farther intetit^ whea we-consider the innumerable Ports
and Places where they have a free Commerce, that it will
then be rto* Wonder ^ and' much lefL will, it^ be* so, when
we conild&v th%t at all those Places and Ports, where the
"Engli^y Shiest come, there is so much, and such constant
Bemandifbi, the- Growth of all other Countries, that there is
Sk c&w'it, Vent* for the Returns, as well as a Market-abroad,

ftoist- whence* I, came,* as*?to a Home > whereas, my Eye,
which Hfce-that which Stlomon, fftaks of,-'mt never satis*
fied^with Seewgy was still^more desirous of - Wand'ring and
Seeing * T was come into a-Part of the*,:V^vld, which I
was never in befoie y and that Part 'in particular, which I
hoard ..much of j and was re&lv'd tp fee as. much of it
as
as I could.; and then I thought, I might iay, I had ieeif
all the World, that was worth feeing.
But my Fellow Traveller and I, had different Noti*
ons 5 I do not name this*, to insist upon my own, for 1
acknowledge his was the most just and the most suited to
the End ot a Merchant's Life j who, when he is abroad
upon Adventures, 'tis his Wisdom to stick to that, as the
best Thing for him, which he is like to get the most Mo-
ney by: My new Friend kept himself to the Nature of
the Thing, and would have been content to have gone like
a Carrier's Horse, always to the iame Inn, backward and
forward, provided he could, as he. cai&l-it-, find his Accoimt
in it > on the other Hmd> mine as old as I was, was the
Notion of a mad rambling Boy, that never cares to fee a
Thing twice over.
But this was not all; I had a Kind of Impatience
upon me to be nearer Home, and yet, the most unsettled
Resolution imaginable,. which Way to go > in the Interval
of these. Consultations, my Friend* who was- always upon
the Search for Business, propos'd another Voyage, to me^
(viz.) among the Spice. Islands j and to bring Home a
Loading of Cloves from, the Manillas, or thereabouts 5
Places where indeed the Dutch do Trade, but the Islands,
belong partly to, the Spaniards $ tho* we went not so
far, but to some other, where they havcL: not the whole
Power as they have at Batavia, Ceylon, &c. We were not
long in preparing for this, Voyage > the-chief Difficulty
was in bringing^ me ta come into it >: however, at last no-
thing el£ offering; and finding'that-really stirring about
and Trading, . fcKq, Profit beingso,great,_cand as I may fay
certain, had more Pleaiuie-in it> and m^e Satisfaction to
the Mind, than sitting still* which,*? me especially, was the
unhappiest Part of Life: I rcsolv'd on this Voyage too, which
we* made very successfully, touching at Bprnea^. and several
Islands* whose Names I do not remember* and came Home
in about five Months 5 we sold our Spice, which was chiesly
Cloves, and some Nutmegs, to the ftrstan Merchants, who
carried them away for the. QulpJi r and making near five
of one, we re§Uy got a great deal of Money.
My Friend, when we made up th^s Account finil'd
at me 5,well now, said he,, with a sort of an agreeable in'-
siilt upon my indolent Temper 5 is not this-better than
walkings
Walking about here, like a Man of nothing u do, and
spending our Time in staring at the Nonsense and Ig-
norance of the Pagans? Why truly, lays I my Friend, I
think it is; and I begin to be a Convert to the Principles
of Merchandizing 5 but I must tell'you, laid I, by the Way,
you do not know what I am a doing, for if once I con-
quer my Backwardness, andimbark hartilyj as old as lam,
I shall harrass you up and down the World, 'till I tire you j
for I shall pursue it £0 eagerly, I shall never let you lie
still." <
But to be short with my Speculations* alittle while after
this, there came in a Dutch Ship front JQattayia ,* Ihe wa3
a Coaster, not an European Trader, and of about two hun-
dred Tun Burthen: The Men, as they freten(led having
been Ib sickly, that the Captain had not Men enough to go
to Sea with, he lay by at Bengalee and as if having got
Money enough, or being willing for other Reasons, to go
ifbr Europe, he gave puofick Nbtice, that he would fell his
Ship : This came to my Ears before rhy neW Partner heard
of it i and I had a greatf Mind to buy it, so ! goes Home
to him, and told him of it j he considers a' while, for he
,was no. rash'Man neither; but musing lome Time, he re-
plyfd, /he :is a little too big, but however, we will have her;
Accordingly we bought the Ship^ and agreeing with the
blaster, we paid for her, and took Pessessjon j when we
had done Ib, we refolv'd to entertain the Men if we could,
to join them with thole we hid, for the jurliiing bur
Business; but on a sudden, they'hiving received nbt their
Wages, but their'(hare of the Money,- as, 'w£ afterwards
learnt, not-*)ne^f/-^eJhi'':w^r'ie6 .be founts j We enqnir'd
much about then*/ 'anil at .length .were told, that they, were
all gone together by Land to Agra, the great City of the
.Moguls Residence and from thence were to travel to
Suratte, and Ib by Sea, to the Gulph of FerJIa.
Nothing had lo heartily troubled me a gobd while,
as that I m'iss'd the Opportunity of going with them sot
such a1Ramble I drought, and in Inch Company as would
both have guarded me, and diverted me, would have suited
mightily with my great Design; and I fluould both have
leen the World, and gone homewards too; but I was much
better satisfied a few Da^s after, when I came to know
what lort of Fellows they were j for in fiort} their Histo-
ry
fy was, that this Man they call'd Captain was the Cannes
only, not the Commander -> that they had been a Trading
Voyage, in which, they were attaqu'd on Shore, by some
of the Malayans, who had kill'd the Captain and three of
his Men > and that after the Captain was kill'd, these Men,
Eleven in Number, had resolv'd to run away with the
Ship, which they did j and had brought her in at the Bay
of Bengale, leaving the Mate and five Men more oa
Shore, of whom, we shall hear farther.
Well, let them come by the Ship how they would,
we came honestly by her, as we thought j tho' we did not,
I confess examine into Things so exactly as we ought, for
we never enquired any Thing of the Seamen j who, if we
had examin'd, would certainly have faulter'd in their Ac-
counts, contradicted one another, and perhaps contradicted
themselves; or one how or other, we should have seen
Reason to have- suspected them j but the Man shew'd us a.
Bill of Sale for the Ship, to one *Emcmuel Closterflioven, or
some such Names for I suppose it was all a Forgery, and
call'd himself by that Name, and we could not contradict- ,
him j and being withal, a little too unwary, or at least,
having no Suspicion of the Thing, we went through with
our Bargain.
However we picked up some EngUsij Seamen here after
this, and some Dutch, and now we resolved for a second
Voyage to the South-East for Cloves, that is to fay,,
among the Thiliptfne and Mollucco Isles j and, in short,
not to fill this P^rt of my Story with Trirles, when what
is yet to come, is so remarkable j I spent from first to last,
fix Years in this Country, trading from Port to Port, back-
ward and forward, and with very good Success j and wa$
now the last Year with my Partner, going in the Ship a-
bovemention'd, on a Voyage to China, but designing fir&
to Si am to buy Rice
I n this Voyage, being by contrary Winds oblig'd to
beat up and down a great while in the Straits of Mauacca*
and among the Islands j we were no sooner got clear ofc
those difficult Seas,, but we found our Ship had sprung a*
Leak, and we were not able by all our Industry to find our
where it was: This rbre'd us to make for some Port, and
my Partner, who knew the Country better than.I did, di-
rected;
i
fce&ed the Captain to put into the River of Cambodia, for
I had made the English Mate, one Mr. Thomson, Captain,
not being willing to take the Charge of the Ship upon my. self t
This River lies on the North-fide of the great Bay or,
Gulph, which goes up to Si am.
While we weie here, and going often on Shore fae
Refreshment, there comes to me one Day an Engliflyman,
and he. was it; seems a Gunner's Mate on board an Englifl)
East-India Ship, which rode in the fame River, up at, or
near the City of Cambodia 5 what brought him hither we
knew not 5 but he comes up to me, and speaking Engliflo:
.Sir, jfoys he, you are a Stranger to me, and I to you j but
I have something to tell you, that very nearly concerns
you.
I lookd steadily at him a good while, and he thought
at first I had known him, but I did not 5 if it very nearly
concerns me, said I, and not your sols, what moves you to
tcll.it me? I am moved, fays he, by the eminent Danger
you are in, aud for ought I soe, you have no Knowledge
of it 5 I know no Danger I am in, slid I, but that my Ship
is leaky, , and I cannot find it out 5 but I propose to lay her
a-Ground to Morrow, to fee if I can find it j but, Sir,
fays he, leaky, or not leaky, find it or not find it, you will
.be wiier than to lay your Ship on Shore to Morrow, when
you hear what I have to fay to you 5 do you know, Sir>
laid lie, the Town of Cambodia lies about fifteen Leagues
up this. River? and there are two large English Ships about
five Leagues on this Side, and three Dutch*, well, said I,
and what is that to me? Why, Sir, fays he, is it for a Man
that is upon such Adventures as you are upon, to come
into a Port, and not examine first what Ships there are
there, and whether he is able to deal with them? I sup-
pose ^ou don't think cyou. are a Match for them: I waa
amused very much at his Discourse,.but not araax'd at it,
for I could not conceive what he meant j and I turn'd
short upon him, and (aid, Sir, I wish, vou would explain
your self I cannot imagine what Reason I have to be •
fraid of any of t lie Company-'s Ships, or Dutch Ships j lam
no Interloper, What can they have to iay to me?
He lookd like a Man half angry, half pleas d, and pau-
sing awhile, but smiling j well, Sir, fays he, if you think
your self secure, you must take your Chance j. I am sorry
your
jour Fate should blind you against good5 Advice,- but astute
your self, if you do not put to Sea immediately, you will
the very next Tide be attaqu'd by five Long-Boats full of
Men, and perhaps, if you are taken, you'll be hang'd son a
Pirate, and the Particulars be ex am in'd afterwards: I thought
Sir, added he, I should have met with a better Reception
than this, for doing you a piece of Service of such Impor-
tance: I can never be ungrateful, said I, for any Service,
or to any Man that offers me any Kindness, but it is past
my Comprehension,//*/*/ J, what they should have such a
Dciign upon me for; however, face you say, there is no
Time to be lost, and that there is some villainous Design
in Hand against me, I'll go on board this Minute, and put
to Sea immediately* if my Men can stop the Leak, or iF
we can (wim without stopping it; But, Sir, said I, (hall I
go away ignorant of the Reason of all this? Can you give
me no farther Light into it?
I c a n tell you but Part of the Story, Sir, lays he, but I
have a Dutch Seamen here with' me, and I believe I couH
persuade him to tell you the rest j but there is scarce Time
tor it; But the (hort of the Story is this, the first Part of
which, I suppose, you know well enougK (Wr.) that you
was with this Ship at Sumatra r that there your Captain was
murther'd by the Mallayans, with three of his Men; and
that you, or some of those that were on board with you,
ran away with the Ship, and are since turn'd P IRuiTES$
this is the Sum of the Story, and you will be all seiz-'d as
Pirates, I can assure you ,• and executed with- very little Ce-
remony; for you know, Merchants Ships (hew but little
• Law to Pirates, if they get them in their Power.,
Now you speak plain English, said I, and I* thank you;
and tho' I know nothing, that we have done,- like what
you talk of, but am sure we came honestly and fairly by
the Ship, yet seeing such Work is a doing as you (ay, and
that you seem to mean honestly, III be upon my Guard;
# my, Sir, fays he, do not talk of being upon your Guard ,*
the best Defence is to be out of the Danger; if you have any
Regard to your Life, and the Life of all your Men, put
out to Sea without fail at High-Water, and as you have a
whole Tide before you, you will be gone too far out before
they can come down, for they will come away at High-
Water , and as they have twenty Miles to come, you ge€
near
near two Hours of them, by the Difference of the Tide»
not reckoning the Length of the Way besides, as they are
only Boats, and not Ships, they will not venture to follow
you far out to Sea, especialiy if it blows.
Well, says I, you have been very kind in this, what
shall I do for you, to make you Amends? Sir, fays he,
you may not be so willing to make me any amends, be-
cause you may not be convinced of the Truth of it: I'll
make an Offer to you I have nineteen Months Pay due
to me, on board the Ship——, which I came out of
'England in > and the Dutchman, that is with me, has seven
Months Pay due to him > if you will make good our Pay
to us, we will go along with you; if you find nothing
more in it, we will desire no more j but if we do con-
vince you, that we have {kv'd your Lives, and the Ship,
and the lives of all the -Men in her, we will leave the rest
to you.
I consented to this readily, and wens immediately
on board, and the two Men with me j as soon as I came
to the Ship-side, my Partner, who was on board, came out
on the Quarter-Deck, and cali'd to me with a great deal of
Joy, Oho / Oho! we have stopp'd the leak! rot have stops d
'the leak I Say you so, said I, thank God, but weigh the
.Anchor then immediately: Weigh! Say he: What do you
mean by that? What is the Matter, says he? Ask noQue-
ilions, fays I, but all Hands to work, and weigh, without
losing a Minute: He was iiirpriz'd, but however, he colYd
the Captain, and he immediately order'd the Anchor to be
got up j and tho' the Tide was not quite done, yet a little
Land-Breeze blowing, we stood out to Sea; then I cali'd
him into the Cabin, and told him the Story at large, and
we cali'd in the Men, and they told us the rest of it but
as it took us up a great deal of Time, so before we had done,
a Seaman comes to the Cabin Door, and calls out to us, that
the Captain bad him tell us, we were chas'd 5 chas'd, fays
J, By who, and by what? By five Sloops or Boats, fays •
the Fellov>> full of Men j Very well, said I, then it is ap-
parent there is something in it: In the next Place I or-
dered all our Men to be cali'd up, and toidrthem, that there
was a Design to seize the Ship, and to take us 'for'Pirates,
and ask'd them, if they would stand by us, and by one
smother? The Men answers chearfully, that one and all,
they would live and die with us: Then I ask'd the Captain,
what Way he thought best for us to manage a Fight with
them? For relist them I rcsolv'd we would, and that to
the last Drop; he said readily, That the Way was to keep
them off with our great Shot, as long as we could, and
then to fire at them with our small Arms to keep them
from boarding us j but when neither of these would da
any longer, we should retire to our close Quarters; per-
haps they had not Materials to break open our Bulk-Heads,
or get in upon us.
T h e Gunner had in the mean Time Order, to bring
two Guns to bear foreand aft, out of the Steerage, to clear
the Deck, and to load them with Musquit-Bullets and small
Pieces of old Iron, and what next came to hand, and thus
we made ready for Fight j but all this while kept out to
Sea, with Wind enough, and could see the Boats at a Di-
stance being five large Long-Boats, following us, with a3
the Sail they could make.
Two or these Boats, which by our Glasses we could
fee, were Englifi, had out-failed tie rest, were near twa
Leagues a-head of them, and gain'd upon us considerably?
so that we found they would come up with us $ upon
which we fired a Gun without a Shot, to intimate, that
they should bring too, and we put out a Flag of Truce, as
a Signal for Parley j but they kept crowding after us, tul
they came within Shot: Upon this we teok m our white
Flag, they having made no Answer to it, hung out a red
Flag, and fired at them with a Shot ; notwithstanding this,
they came on, till they were near enough to call to them
with a speaking Trumpet, which we had on board; so.
we caird to them, and bid them keep off at their Peril.
I t was all one, they crowded after us, and endeavour-
ed to come under our Stern, so to board us on our Quar*
ter; upon which, seeing they were resolute for Mischief*
and depended upon the Strength that followed them, I or-
dered to brirg the Ship too, so that they lay upon our Broad-
side, when immediately we fired five Guns at them 5 one
of which, had been levelled so true, as to carry away the
Stern of the hindermost Boat, and bring them to the Ne-
cessity of taking down theirSail, and running all to the
Head of the Boat to keep her from finking, so Hie lay
by, and had enough of it > but seeing the foremost Boat
crowd
crowd still on after us, we made ready to fire at her in par-
ticular.
While this was doing, one of the three- Boats that
was behind, being forwarder than the other two, made np
to the Boat which we had dilabied, to relieve her, and we
could afterwards lee her take out the Men j we call cl again
to the foremost. Boa*-, and offer:d. a Truce to parley again,
and to know what was her Business with us; but had no
Answer, only she crowded close under our Stern , upon
this, our Gunner, who was a very dexterous Fellow, run
out his two Chase-Guns, and fired again at her j but the
Shot miffing, the Men in the Boat shouted, wav'd their
Caps, and came on; but the Gunner getting quickly rea-
dy again, nVd among them the second Time one Shot
of which, thoJ it muVd the Boat it self, yet fell in among
the Men, and we could eahly see, had done a great deal of
Mischief among them $, but we taking no notice of that,
war'd the Ship again, and brought our Quarter to bear up-
on them-, and firing three Guns more, we found the Boat
was split almost to Pieces 5 in particular, her Rudder, and
a Piece of her Stern was shot quite away, so they handed
their Sail immediately, and were in great Disorder $ but to
com pleat their Misfortune, our Gunner let fly two Guns
at them again 5 where he hit them we could not tell, but
we found the Boat was linking, and some of the Men al-
ready in the Water $ upon this, I immediately man'd out
our Pinnace, which we had kept close by our Side, with
Orders to pick up seme of the Men if they could, and
save them from drowning, and immediately to come on
board with them j because we sew the rest of the Boats
began to come up j our Men in the Pinnace follow d their
Orders, and took up three Men j one of which was just
drowning, and it was a good while before we could reco-
ver him 4 as soon as they were on board, we crowded ail
the Sail we could make, and stood farther out to Sea, and
we found that when the other three Boats came up to the •
first two, they gave over their Chace.
Being thus delivers from a Danger, which though I
knew- not the Reason of it, yet seem'd to be much greater
than I apprehended j I took Care that we would change
our Course, and not let any one imagine whither we were
going j so we stood oux to Sea Eastward, quite out of the
Course
Course of all European Ships, whether they were bound to
China, or any where else, within the Commerce of the
European Nations.
When we were now at Sea, we began to consult with
the two Seamen, and enquire first, What the Meaning of
all this should be: The Dutchman let us into the Secret
of it at once j telling us, that the Fellow that fold us the
Ship, as we said, was no more than a Thief, that had run
away with her: Then he told us, how the Captain, whole
Name too he told us, tho' I do not remember it now,
was treacherously murther'd by the Natives on the Coast
ot'Mallaca, with three of his Men j and that he, this Dutch-
man, and four more got into the Woods, where they wan-
dered about a great while j till at length, he in particular,
in a miraculous Manner, made his Escape, and swam off
to a Dutch Ship, which failing near the Shore, in its Way
from China, had sent their Boat on Shore for fresh Water j
that he durst not come to that Part of die Shore where
the Boat was, but made shift in the Night, to take into
the Water farther off, and swimming a great while, at last
the Ship's Boat took him up.
H e then told us, that he went to Battavia, where two
of; the Seamen belonging to the Ship had arriv'd, having de-
serted the rest in their Travels, and gave an Account, that
the Fellow, who had run away with the Ship, ibid her at
Bepgale, to a Set of Pirates, which were gone a Cruising
in her j and that they had already taken an Engtifo Ship and
tw;o Dutch Ships very richly laden,
-This latter Part, we found to concern us directly, and
tho' we knew it to be false; yet, as my Partner said very
well, if we had fallen into their Hands, and they had had
such a Preposlcslion against us before-hand, it had been in
vain for us to have defended ourselves, or to hope for any-
good Quarters at their Hands; especially considering that our
Accusers had been our Judges, and that we could have ex-
* pected' nothing from them, but what Rage would have
dictated, and ungoverned Passion have executed* arid there-
fore it was his Opinion, we should go directly back to
Bengale, from whence we came, without putting in at a-
ny Port whatever j because there, we could give an Ac-
count of our selves, and could prove where we were when
the
the Ship put in, who we bought her of, and the like;
and, which was more than all the rest, if we were put to
the Necessity of bringing it before the proper Judges, we
should be sure to have some Justice, and not be hang'd first,
and judg'd afterward.
I was sometime of my Partner's Opinion j but after a
little more serious thinking, I told him, I thought it was
a very great Hazard for us to attempt returning to Ben-
gale, for that we were on the wrong Side of the Straits
of Malacca^ and that if the Alarm was given, we should
be sure to be Way-laid on every side, as well by the Dutch
of Battavia, as the English else-where; that if we should
be taken, as it were, running away, we should even con-
demn our, selves, and there would want no more Evidence
to destroy us ^ I also asked the Englifl) Sailor's Opinion,
who said, he was of my Mind, and that we should cer-
tainly be taken.
This Danger, a little startled my Partner and all the
Ship's Company; and we immediately resolved to go a-
way to the Coast of Tonquin, and so on to China, and
from thence pursuing the first Design, as to Trade, find
some Way or other to dispose of the Ship, and come back
get: This was approved of as the best Method for our Se-
curity i and accordingly we steered away N.N.E. keeping
-above fifty Leagues oft from the usual Course to the East-
ward.
This however put us to some Inconveniences; for first
the -Winds, when we came to that Distance from the
Shore, seem'd to be more steadily against us, blowing al-
most Trade, as we call it, from the East, and E. N.E. so
that we were a long while upon our Voyage, and we were
but ill provided with Victuals for so long a Run and,
which was still worse, there was some Danger, that those
Englsjhfjfcd Dutch Ships, whose Boats pursued us, whereof
some were bound that Way, might be got in before us;
and if not, some other Ship, bound to China, might have
Information of us from them, and pursue us with the
fame Vigour.:
I must confess, I was now very uneasy, and thought
my self, including' the late Escape from the Long-Boats,
to have been in the most dangerous Condition that ever I
in some of the Vessels
 
was
was in, thro* all my past Life; for whatever ill Circum-
stances I had been in, I was never pui sued for a Thief be-
fore j nor had I ever done any Thing that merited the Name
of Dishonest or Fraudulent, much less Thievish: I had
chkRy been mine own Enemy, or, as I may rightly lay,
I had been no body's Enemy but my own: But now I
was embarrass'd in the worst Condition imaginable j for
tho' I was perfectly innocent, I was in no Condition to
make that Innocence appear: And if I had been taken
it had been under a supposed Guilt of the worst Kind j
at least, a Crime esteem'd £0 among the People I had to do
with.
This made me very anxious to make an Escape, tho',
which Way to do it, I knew notor what Port or Place
we mould go to: My Partner seeing me thus dejected,
tho* he was the most concerns at first, began to encourage
me and describing to me the several Ports of that Coast,
told me he would put hi, on the Coast of Choch'mchma^ or
the Bay of Tonquin j intending to go afterwards to Macao*
a Town once in the Possession of tnePortugueze, and where
still a great many European Families resided, and particu-
larly the Missionary Priests; usually went thither, in order
to their going forward to China.
: Hither then we resolved to go,> and accordingly, tho*
!after a tedious and irregular Course, and very much straitr
;ncd for Provisions, we came within Sight of the Coast ve-
ry early in the Morning > and upon Reflection, upon the
past Circumstances we were in, and the Danger if we had
not escaped, we resolved to put into a small River, which,
however, had a Depth enough of Water for us, and to see
if we could, either over Land; -or by the Ship's Pinnace,
come to know what Ships were in any Port thereabouts.
This happy Srep I was indeed, our Deliverance , for tho1
we did not immediately see any European Ships fn the J|ay
of Tonquin, yet the next Morning, there came into the my
two Dutch Ships, and a third without any Colours spread
out, but which we heliev'd to be a Dutchman, pass'd by at
about two Leagues Distance, steering for the Coast of Chi-
na*; and in the Afternoon went by two Englifl) Ships,
steering the lame Course j and thus, we thought, we law
our selves beset with Enemies, both one Way and the o-
ther. The Place we. were in was wild and barbarous, the
People
People Thieves, even by Occupation or Profession ; "and
tho' it is true, we had not much to seek of them, and ex-
cept getting a few Provilions, car'd not how little we had
to do with them, yet it was. with much Difficulty, that
we kept our selves from being insulted by them several
Ways.
W f. were in a small River of this Country, within a
few Leagues of its utmost Limits Northward* and by our
Boat we coasted North-East to the Point of Land, which
opens the great Bay of Tor/quin; and it was in this Beating
up along the Shore, that we discover'd as above, that, in a
Word, we were surrounded with Enemies. The People we
were among, were the most barbarous of all the Inhabi-
tants of the Coast; having no Correspondence with anyo-
ther Nation, and dealing only in fish, and Oil, and such
gross Commodities and it -may be particularly seen, that
t hey are, as I said, the most barbarous of any of the Inha-
bitants, {viz..) that among other Customs they have this as
one, That if any Vestel have the Misfortune to be Ship-
wreck'd upon their Coast, they presently make the Men
all Prisoners, that is to [ay* Slaves i and it was not long be-
fore we found a Spice or their Kindness this Way; on the
Occasion following.
I have observed above, that our Ship sprung a Leak at
Sea, and that we could not find it out; and however, it hap-
pen d, that as I have said, it wasstop'd unexpectedly, in the
happy Minute of our being to be seiz/d, by the Dutch and
Engli/Jj Ships, near the Bay of Siam; yet as we did not find
the Ship so perfectly tight and sound as we deuYd, we re-
solv'd, while we were in this Place, to lay her on Shore,
take out what heavy Things we had on board, which
were not many, and to wash, and clean her Bot-
tom i and, if possible, to find out where the Leaks
were.
Accordingly, having lightned the Ship, and brought
all our Guns, and other moveable Things to one Side, we
try'd to bring her down, that we might come at" her Bot-
tom j for on second Thoughts, we did not care to lay her
dry, a-ground, neither could we find out a proper Place
for it.
The Inhabitants, who had never been acquainted with
such a Sight, came wondering do wn to the Shore, to look at
us j
us; and feeing the Ship lie down on one Side in such a
Manner, and heeling towards the Shore, and not feeing
our Men, who were at work on her Bottom with Stages,
and with their.Boats on the off "Side, they presently con-
cluded, that the Ship was cast away, and lay so very fast
on the Ground.
O n this Supposition, they came all about us in two or
three Hours Time, with ten or twelve large Boats, having
some of them eight, some ten Men in a Boat, intending,
no doubt, to have come on board, and plunder'd the Ship,
and if they had found us there, to have carry'd us
away for Slaves to their King; or whatever they call
him, for we knew nothing, who was their Gover-
nour.
When they came up to the Ship, and began to row
round her, they discovers us all hard at work, on the
Out-fide of the Ship's Bottom and Side, washing, and
graving, and stopping, as every Sea-faring Man knows
now.
They stood for a while gazing at us, and we, who
were a little surpriz'd, could not imagine what their De-
.sign was i but being willing to 6e sure, we took this Op-
portunity, to get some of us into the Ship, and others to
hand down Arms and Ammunition to those that were at
work, to defend themselves with, if there should be Occa-
sion i and it was no more than need for, in less than
a Quarter of an Hour's Consultation, they agreed, it seems,
that the Ship was really a Wreck, that we were all at
work, endeavouring to save her, or to lave our Lives by
the Help of our Boats, and when we handed our Arms in-
to the Boats, they concluded, by that Motion, that we
were endeavouring to save some of our Goods; upon this
they took it for granted, we all belonged to them 5 and a-
way they came directly upon our Men, as if it had been ill
a Line of Battle.
Our Men, seeing so many of them, began to be fright-
ed j for we lay but in an ill Posture to fight, and cry \i out
to us, to know what they should do? I immediately calsd
to the Men, who work'd upon the Stages, to Hip them
down, and get up the Side into the Ship; and bad those
in the Boat to row round and come on board; and those
few of us, who wexe on board, work d with all the Strength
1 &4
and Hands we had, to bring the Ship to rights; but how-
ever, neither the Men upon the Stage, nor those in the
Boats, could do ?.s they were order'd, before the Coch'mchi-
nejfes were upon them 5 and with two of their Boats boarded
our Long-Boat, and began to lay hold of the Men as their
Prisoners.
The first: Man they laid hold of, was an Pnglislj Sea-
man, a stout strong Fellow, who having a Musket in his
Hand, never offer \d to fire it, but laid it down in the
Boat, like a Tool, as I thought: But he understood his Bu-
siness better than I could teach him, for he grappled the
Pagan, and dragged him by main Force, out of their own
Boat into ours > where, taking him by the two Ears, he
beat his Head so against the Boats Gunnel, that the Fellow
dy VI instantly in his Hands; and in the mean Time, a 'Dutch-
man, who stood next, took up the Musket, and with the
But-end of it, so laid about him, that he knock'd down
five of them, who attempted to enter the Beat, but this~
was doing little towards resisting thirty or forty Men,
who fearless, because ignorant of their Danger, began to
throw themselves into the Long-Boat, where we had but
five Men to defend it; But one Accident gave our Men a
compleat Victory, which deserv'd our Laughter rather than
any thing else, and that was this:
Our Carpenter, being preparing to grave the Out-side
of the Ship, as well as to pay the Seams, where he had
caulk'd her ro stop the Leaks, had got two Kettles just let
down into the Boat; one fill d with boiling Pitch, and the
other with Rosin, Tallow, and Oil, and such Stuff, as the
Ship- Wi ights use for that Work j and the Man that tend-
ed the Carper ter, had a great Iron Ladle in his Hand, with
•which he supply'd the Men that were at work with that
hot Stuff j two of the Enemy's Men entred the Boat just
where this Fellow stood, being in the Fore-fhects he im-
mediately saluted them with a Ladleful of the Stuff, boil-
ing hot, which so burnt and scalded them, being half na-
ked, that they roar'd out like two Bulls, and, enrag'd with
the Fire, leap'd both into the Sea: The Carpenter saw it,
and cry'd out, Well done, Jack* give them some more of
it ; when stepping forward himself, he takes one of their
Mops, and dipping it in the Pitch-Pot, he and his Man
threw it among them so plentifully, that, in short, of all
the Men in three Boats, there was not one thrrt was not
scalded, and burnt with it in a most frightful pitiful Man-
ner, and made such a Howling and crying, that I never
heard a worse Noise, and indeed nothing-like it; for it is
worth observing, That tho Pain naturally makes all Peo-
ple cry out, yet every Nation have a particular Way of
Exclamation, and make Noises as different from one ano-
ther, as their Speech,- I cannot give the Noise, these Crea-
tures made, a belter Name than Howling, nor a Name more
proper to the Tone of it j for I never heard any Thing
move like the Noise of the: Wolves, which, as I have
said, I heard howl in the Forest on the Frontiers of Lm-
guedoc.
I was never pleas'd with a Victory better in my Life;
not only as it was a perfect Surprize to me, and that our
Danger was imminent before: But as we got this Victory
without any Blood-shed, except of that Man the Fellow
kill d with his naked Hands, and which I was very much
concerned at j for I was lick of killing such poor Savage
Wretches, even tho' it was in my own Defence, knowing
they came on Errands, whicli they thought j list, and knew
no better ,• and that tho' it may be a just Thing, because
neceslary, for there is no necestary Wickedness in Nature;
yet I thought it was a fad Life when We must be always
oblig'd to be killing our Fellow-Creatures to preserve our
selves, and indeed, I think fo still; and I would even now suf-
fer a great deal, rather than I would take away the Lite,
even of the worst Person injuring me: I believe alib, all
considering People, who know the Value of Life, would
be of my Opinion, if they entred seriously into the Consi-
deration of it.
But to return to my Story; all the while this was do-
ing, my Partner and I, who manag'd the rest of the Men
on board, had with great Dexterity brought the Ship al-
most to rights j and having gotten the Guns into their
Places 3gain, the Gunner call'd to me, to bid our Boat get
out of the Way, for he would let fly among them: I call'd
'back again to him, and bid him not offer to fire, for the
Carpenter would7 do the Work without him j but bad him
heat another Pitch-Kettle,* which our Cook, who was oh
board, took Gare of: But the Enemy wis Cq terrified with
I 2 what
what they met with in their first Attaque, that they would
not come on again ; and some of them that were farthest
off, seeing tHe Ship swim, as it were upright, begun> as
we supposed, to see their Mistake, and give over the En-
tel prize, finding it was not as they expected : Thus we
-got dear of this merry Fight j and having gotten some
Rice, and some Roots, and Bread, with about iixteen good
big Hogs on board, two Days before; we resolv'd to stay
here no longer, but go forward whatever came of it j for
we made no Doubt but we should be surrounded the next
Day with Rogues enough, perhaps more than our Pitch-
Kittle would dispose of for us.
W e thei efore got all our Things on board the fame E-
vening, and the next Morning was ready to fail \ in the
mean Time, lying at an Anchor some Distance from the
Shoie, we were not so much concerns, being now in a
fighting Posture, as well as in a failing Posture, if any E-
nemy had presented: The next Day having finisiVd our
Work within board, and finding our Ship was perfectly
heal'd of all her Leaks, we set fail j we would have gone
into the Bay of Tonquin j for we wanted to inform our ielves
pf what was to be known concerning the Dutch Ships that
had been, there; but we durst not'stand in there, because
we had seen several Sliips go inj as we iuppos'd, but a lit-
tle before; so we kept on N.E. towards the Isle of Tor-
mesa, as much afraid of being seen by a Dutch or English
Merchant Ship, as a Dutch or English Merchant Ship in the
Mediteranean is of an Alger'me Man of War.
Wh e n we were thus got to Sea, we kept on N. E.
as if we would go to the Manillas or the Philippine Islands;
and this we did that we might'not fall into the Way of
any of the European Ships; and then we steer'd North a-
*gain, till we came to the Latitude of 22 Degrees, 20 Mi-
nutes 5 by ^ which Means we made the Islana of For mesa
directly, where we came to an Anchor, in order to get
Water, and fiesli Provisions, which the People there, who •
are very courteous and civil in their Manners, supply'd us
with willingly, and. dealt very fairly and punctually with
us in all their Agreements and Bargains; which is what we
did not find among other People; and may be owing to
the Remains of Christianity, which was once planted here
by a Diit/k Missionary of Protestants, and is a Testimony
 
of what I have often observd, riz. That the ChristianRe- 4
ligion always civilizes the People, and reforms their Man- -
ners, where it is receiv'd, whether it works saving Effects
upon them or no
Fro m hence we saiPd still North., keeping the Coast of
China at an cqualDistance, till we knew we were bevond
aJJ the Ports of China, where oar European Ships usually
come; being resolv'd, if possible, not to fall into any of
their Hands, especially in this Country, where, as our Cir-
cumstances were, we could not fail of being entirely ruin-
ed} nay, ib great was my Fear in particular, as to my be-
ing taken by them, that I believe firmly, I would much
rather have chosen to fall into the Hands of the Spanish
Inquisition.
Being now come to the Latitude of 30 Deg-ees, w«
resolv'd to put into the first Trading Port we flSbuld come
at j and standing in for the Shore, a Boat came off two
Leagues to us, with an old Vortugueze Pilot on board, who-
knowing us to be an Europe fin Ship, came to offer his Ser-
vice, which indeed we were very glad of,'and took him
on board 5 upon- which,- without asking us, whither we;
would go, he dismiss'd the Boat he came iir, and sent it
back. "*
I thought it was now so much in our Choice, to
make the old Man carry us whither we would, that I be-
gan to talk with him about carrying of us to the 'Gulph
of Nanquin, which is the most Northern Part of the Coast
of China: The old M3n said he knew the Gulph of Nan--
quin very well ; but, smiling ask'd us, what we would do
there?
I told him, we would sell our Cargo, and purchase
China-Wares, Callicoes, Raw-Silks, Tea, Wrought-Silks,
&>c. and so would return by the lame Course we came;
He told us our best Port had been to have put in at Ma-
cao, where we could not fail of a Market for our Opium,
to our Satisfaction, and might for our Money have pur-
• chas'd all Sorts of China-Goods, as cheap as we could at
Nanquin.
Not being able to put the old Man out of his Talk, of
which he was very opinionated, or conceited, I told him,
we were Gentlemen, as well as Merchants, and that we
had a Mind to go and see the great City of E eking and th?
I 3 famous
( tp8 >
famous Court of the Monarch of China. Why then, fays
the old, Man, you should go to Ningpe, where, by the Ri-
ver which runs into the Sea there, you may go up within
five Leagues of the Great Canal: This Canal is a naviga*.
ble made. Stream, which goes thorough the Heart of that
vast Empire of China, crosses all the Rivers, passes somecon>-
fiderable Hills, by the Help of Sluices and Gates, and goes
up to the City of Peking, being in Length near zjo
Leagues.
Well, said I, Seignior Portuguese, "but that is not our
Business now: The great Question is, If you can carry us
up to-.the City of Nanquin, from whence we can travel to
pecking afterwards?, Yes, he said,.he could do so very weHj
and there was a great Dutch Ship gone up that.Way just
before: This gave me a little Shock j a Ship was
now our Terror, and we had much rather have met the
Devil j at least, if he had not come in too frightful a Fi^
gurej we depended upon it, that a Dutch Ship would b&
our Destruction, for we were in no Condition to fight them *
aJJ the Ships they trade with in those Parts being of
great Burthen, and of much - greater Force than we
were. .,
The old Man found me a little confus'd, and under
some Concern, when he nam'd a Dutch Ship, and faki to
me, Sir, you need be under no Apprehension of the Dutch,
I suppose they are not now at War with your Nation:
No, says I, that's true 5 but I know not what Liberties
Men may take, when they are out of the Reach of the
Laws of their own ,Country j Why, fays he, you are no
Pirates, what need your fear? They will not meddle with
peaceable Merchants sure.
I f I had any Bipod in my Body that did not fly np into
my Face at that Word, it was hinder'd by some Stop' in
the Vessels, appointed b) Nature to circulate it; for it i>ut
me into the greatest Disorder and Confusion imaginable >
Nor was it possible for me to conceal it so, but that the
old Man easily perceiy'd it.
Sir, lays he, I find you are in seme Disorder in your
* Thoughts at my talk, pray be pleas d to go which Way
you think fit, and depend upon it, I'll do you all the Ser-
vice I can: Why> Seignior, said I, it is true, I am a little
unsettled
unsettled in my Resolution at this Time, whither to go fh
particular, and I am something more so, for what you
laid about Tirates> I hope there are no Pirates in these Seas;
we are but in an ill Condition to meet with them, for you
see we have but & small Force, and but very weakly
-mann'd.
O, Sir, fays hey do not be concerns, I dd not know
that there has been any Pirates in these Seas these fifteen
Years, except one which was seen> as I hear, in the Bay of
Siam, about a Month since; but you may be assured she is
•gone to the Southward; nor was she a Ship of any great
.Force,'or fit for the Work ,• ike was not built for a Pri-
vateer, but was run away whk by a Reprobate Crew that
were ion Board, after the Captain and some of his Men had
been murther'd by the Malayans, at or near the Island of
Sumatra.
What! SA ID I, fitemingto know nothing of the Mat-
tery Did they murther the Captain? No, said ke. I do not
understand that they murther d him ; but as they afterwards
;run away with the Ship, it is generally bdiev'd they be-
trayed him into the Hands of the Malayans* who did mur-
ther him, and perhaps they proeur d them to do it: Why
then, said I, they deserve Death as much as if they hid
done it themselves: Nay, fry$ tkæ dd. Mœn, they do deleave
it, and they will certainly have it, if they light upon my
Englifi or Dutch Ship $ for they have all agieed to-ether,
that if they meet that Rogue, they will give him no
Quarter.
But, said I to him, you lay the Pirate is gone out of
these Seas, how can they meet with him then? Why, that
is true, lays he, they do lay so; but he was, as I tell you,
in the Bay of Siam, in the River Cam&odia, and was dii-
Ship, and who were left on Shore when they run away
with her j and some Engli/Jj and Dutch Tradeis being in the
Riva*, they were within a little of taking him: Nay,/?/*/
Æe, if the foremost: Boats had been well seconded by the
rest, they had certainly taken him; but he finding only two
Boats within Reach of him, tackM about and fVd at these
•two, and disabled them, before the other came up, and
then standing off to Sea, the other weie not able to follow
him, and ib he got away: But they have all so exact a
 
Dutch Men who belcng'drto the
it
Description
Description of the Ship, that they will be sure to knovr
him; and wherc-ever they find him, they have vow'd to
give no Quaiter to either the Captain, or the Seamen, but
to hang them all up at the Yard-Arm.
What! says I, will they execute them right or wrong,
hang them first, and judge them afterwards? O, Sir! fays
the old Pilot, there's no need to make a formal Business of
it with such Rogues as those, let them tie them Back to
Back, and set them a diving $ *tis no more than they right-
ly deserve.
I knew I had my old Man fail a-board, and that he
could do me no Harm, so that I turn'd short upon him:
Well, now Seignior, said I, and this is the very Reason,
why I would nave you carry us up to Nanquin, and not
to put back to Macao, or tq any other Part of the Coun-
try, where the English or Butch Ships come; for be it
known to you, Seignior, those Captains of tlie English and
Dutch Ships, are a Parcel of rash, proud, insolent Fellows,
that neither know what belongs to Justice, or how to
behave themselves, as the Laws of God and Nature direct;
but being proud of their Offices, and not understanding
their Power, they would act the Murtherers to punish
Robbers; would take upon them to insult Men falsly ac-
cused, and determine them guilty without due Enquiry;
and perhaps I may live to call some of them to an Ac-
count for it, where they may be taught how Justice is to
be executed, and that no Man ought to be treated as a Cri-
minal, till some Evidence may be had of the Crime, and
that he is the Man.
With this I told him, that this was the very Ship they
had attacks, and gave him a full Account of the Skirmish we
had with their Boats, and how foolishly and coward-like
they behav'd: I told him all the Story of our buving the
Ship, and how the Dutchmen served us: I told him the
Reasons I had to believe that this Story of killing the Ma-
ster by the Malayans was true ; as also the running away
with the Ship; but that it was all a Fiction of their own,
to suggest that the Men were turn'd Pirates; and they
ought to have been sure it was so, before they had ven-
tured to attaque us by Surprize, and oblige us to resist "em;
adding that they would have the Blood of those Men, who
we kill d there in our just Defence, to answer for.
The old Man was amaz/d at this Relation, and told
us, we were very much in the right to go away to the
North, and that if he might advise us, it should be to sell
the Ship in China, which we might very well do, and buy
or build another in the Country; and, said he, tho* you
will not get so good a Ship, yet you may get one able e-
nough txTcarry you and all your Goods back again to. Ben-
gale, or any where else.
I told him, 7 would take his Advice, when I came
to any Port where I could find a Ship for my Turn, or
get any Customer to buy this: He reply'd, I should meet'
with Customers enough for the Ship at Nanquin, and that
a Chinese Junk would serve me very well to go back a-
gain j and that he would procure me People, both to buy
one, and fell the other.
Well, but Seignior, fays I, as you fay they know the
Ship lo well, I may perhaps, if I follow your Measures,
be instrumental to bring some honest innocent Men into a
terrible Broil, and perhaps to be murther'd in cold Blood >
for where-ever they find the Ship, they will prove the
Guilt upon the Men, by proving this was the Ship, and so
jnnecent Men may probably be overpowers and murther'd:
Why, says the old Man, I'll find out a Way to prevent that-
also j for as T know all those Commanders you {peak of very
well, and shall see them all as they pass by, I will be sure
to set them to rights in the Thing, and let them know*
that they had been so much in the wrong; that tho' the
People,1 who were on board at sirir, might run away with
the Ship, yet it was not true that they had turned Pirates
and that in particular, these were not the Men that first
went orf with the Ship, but innocently bought her for
their Trade j and I am persuaded they will so far believe
me, as at least to act more cautiously for the time to comeV
Well, says I, and will you deliver one Message to them
"from trie? Yes, I will, fays ^ if yoti wilF give it under
# your Hand in Writing, that I may-be able so prove it came
from you, iand not out of my own Head : I answered,
that I would readily give it him binder my Hand; so I
took; a Pen, and Ink, and Paper, and Wrote at-large-the
Story of assaulting me with the'Long-Boats, &c; the pre-
tended Reason of it, and the unjust cruel Design cf it,- and
concluded to the. Commanders that they had done wha
1 f' ihv\t
they not only should have been afham'd of, but also, frht
if ever they came to England, andlliv'd to see them there,
they should all pay dearly for it, if the Laws of my Coun-
try were not grown out of Use before I arriv'd there.
M y old Pilot read this over and over again, and ask'd
me several Times if I would stand to it? I answer'd, I
would stand to it as long as I had any thing left in the
World, being sensible that I sliould one time or other find
an Opportunity, to put it' home to them: But we had 'no-\
occasion ever to let,the PjQot carry.,this Letter;, for he ne4-
ver went bac£ again: While thol^ things were passing be-1
tween us, j?y way of Dilconfrse, we went forward-, direct-
ly for Nar^um., and in about thirteen Days Sail came to an
Anchor at the South-West Point of the great Gulph of
Hœnquin; where, by the Way, I came by Accident to un--
derstand, that the two Dntfh Ships were gone that length be-
fore me, and; that I should certainly fall into their Hands j.
I consul te*l my Partner again- in this Exigency, and he was.
as mu;cji at.a.JLoss as I was, and would very gladly have
been iafe, on Sjior.e almost any where; however, I was not
in luck Pfirpjex«ity neither > but I ask'd the'old-Pilot, if there
was no Creek, or Harbour, which I might put into, and
puisue my Business with the Chenise privately, and be in
no Danger of the Enemy: He told me if I would fail to
the Southward about two and forty Leagues, there was a
little Port call'd ^umchang, where the Fathers of the
Mission usually landed from Mtum), on their Progress to
teach the Christian- Religion to the Chinese*, and where n&
Enro^an Ships, ever put in and if I thought to put irt
there, I migiit consider what farther Course to take when
I was on Shore: He confess'd, he said, it was not a Place
tor Merchants, except that at ibme certain Times, they
had a kind of a Fair there, when the Merchants from
Jflpun came over thither to buy the Chines* Merchandizes.
W b all' agreed to. go hick to this Place 5 the Narrie of
the Port, as he cali'd:it, I may perhaps ipell wrong,- for I
do not particularly remember it, having lost this, together
witli the Names of many other Places, set down in a lit-
tle Pocket-Book, which was ipoil'd by the Water, on an.
Accident, which I <ball relate in it's Order but this I re-
member, that the Chinese, or J-afonese Merchants we cor-
related with, aUl'd it by a differing Name from that
, whkht
which our Portuguese Pilot gave it, and* pronounced it as-
above, Jguinchang.
A s we were unanimous in our Resolutions, to go to'
this Place, we weigh'd the next Day, having only gone
twice on Shore, where we were to get fresh Water; on
both which Occasions, the People of the Country were
very civil to us, and brought us abundance or* Things to
fell to us -7 I mean*, of Provisions, Plants, Rcors, Tea, Rice,
jaud some Fowls j but nothing without Money.
';Wje came to the other Port, (the Wind being contrary)
not till five Days, but it was very much to our Satisfacti-
on j and I was joyful, and I may By thankful, when I let
my Foot &fe on Shore j resolving, and my Partner too,
that if it was possible to dispose of .our selves and Effects,
any other Way, tho' not every Wyay to our Satisfaction,
we would never set one Foot on board that unhappy Ves-
sel more j and indeed I must acknowledge, that of all t he
Circumstances of Life, that ever I had any Experience
 of, nothing makes Mankind so compleatly miserable as
that, of being in constant Fear: Well does the Scripture
sey, the Fear of Man brings a Sn%re j it is a Life of Death,
and the Mind is so entirely suppress by it, that it is ca-
pable of no Relief \ the animal Spirits link, and all" tire Vi-
gour of Nature, which usually supports Men under other
Afflictions, and is present to them in the greatest Exigen-
cies, fails them here.
Nor did it fail of its ufnal Operations upon the Fancy,
by heightening every Danger, representing the English aud
Dutch Captains, to be Men (incapable or hearing Reason,
or of distinguishing between honest Men and Rogues j ot
between a Story calculated for our own Turn, made out
of nothing, on purpose to deceive j and a true genuine Ac-
count of our whole Voyage, Progress and Design j for we
might many Ways have convinced any reasonable Crea*
ture, that we were not Pirates $ the Goods we had on
board, the Course we steer'd, our frankly mewing our
.selves, and entring into such and such Ports; even our ve-
ry Manner, the Force we had, the Number of Men, the
few Arms, little Ammunition, short Pioviiions; all these
would have ferv'd to convince any Men, that we were no
Pirates j the Opium and other Goods we had on board,
would make it appear the Ship had been at Bengalee the
Dutchmen,
Dutchmen, who it was slid, had the Names of all thcMerr
that was in the Ship, might easily fee that we was a Mix-
tin e of English Portuguese, and Indians, and but two 'Dutch-
men en Board: These, and many other particular Ciicum-
stances, might have mrde it evident to the Understanding
of any Commander, whose Hands we might fall into, that,
we were no Pirates.
But Fear, that blind useless Pa/Hon, workd another
Way, and threw us into the Vapours; it bewildied our
Under landings, and set the Imagination at work, to form
a thouiand terrible Things, that peihaps might never hap-
pen j we mfr. suppos d, as indeed eveiy Body had related
to us, that the Seamen on board the English and Dutch,
Ships, but especially the Dutch, were Ib em aged at the
Name of a- Pirate, and especially at our beating of their
Boats, and escaping, that they would not give themselves
Leave to enquire, whether we were Pirates or no j but
would execute us off Hand, as we call it, without giving
us any Rooms for a Defence; we reflected, that there was
really ib much apparent Evidence before them, that they
would scarce enquire after any more; as fir ft, that theSh^
was certainly the fame, and that seme of the Seamen a-
meng them knew her, and had been on board her j and,,
secondly* That when we had Intelligence at the River
Cambodia, that they were coming down to examine us,
we fought their Boats and fled i lo that we made no doubt
but they were fully satisfy'd of our being Pirates, as wc-
were satisfy'd of the contrary; and I as often said, I knew
not but I should have been apt to have taken the like Cir-
cumstances for Evidence, if the Tables were turn'd, and
my Cafe was theirs, and have made no Scruple of cutting
all the Crew to pieces, without believing; or perhaps con-
sidering, what they might have to offer in their Defence. -
B u t let that be how it will, those were our Apprehen-
sions, and both my Partner and I too, scarce slept a Night,
without dreaming of Halters, and Yard-Aims j that is to
fay, Gibbets; cf fighting, and being taken j of killing, and
and being kili'd; and- one Night I was in such a Fury in*
my Dream, fancying the Dutchmen had boarded us, and I"
was knocking one of their Seamen down, that I struck my
double fist against the hde of the Cabin May in with such
a FokCj as wounded my Hand most gnevousiy, broke my
Knuckles,
Knuckles, and cut and bruised the Flesh; so that it not on--
ly wak'd me out of my Sleep, but I was once afraid I
should ha\'e lost two of my Fingers.
Another Appreheniion I had, was of the cruel Uiage
we should meet with from them, if we fell into their Hands y
then the Story of Amboyna came into my Head, and how
the Dutch might perhaps torture us, as they did our Coun-
trymen there j and make some of our Men by Extremity
of Toiture, confess those Crimes they never were guilty
of j own themielves, and all of us to be Pirates, and io
they would put us to Death, with a formal Appearance o£
justice j and that they might be tempted *o do this, for
the Gain of our Ship and Cargo, which was worth four
or five thousind Pounds, put altogether.
These Things tormented me and my Partner too,
Night and Day j nor did we consider that the Captains of
Ships have no Authority to act thus j and if we had fur-
render d Prisoners to them, they could not answer the de-
stroying us, 01* torturing us, but would be accountable for
k, when they came into their own "Country: This I fay,
gave me no Satisfaction; for if they will act thus with
us, what Advantage would it be to us, that they would be
call d to an Account for it; or if we were first to be mur-
theied, what Satisfaction would it be to us, to have them
punished when they came Home?
I cannot refrain taking Notice here, what Reflections I
now had upon the past Variety of my particular Circum-
stances i how hard I thought it was, that I who had spent
forty Years in a Life of continu'd Difficulties, and was at
last come as it were to the Port or Haven, which all Men
drive at, (vizJ) to have Rest and Plenty, should be a Vo-
luntier in new Sorrows, by my own unhappy Choice j.
and that T, who had escapedib many Dangers in my Youth,
should now come to be hang'd in my old Age, and in so
remote a Place, for a Crime I was not in the least inclin'd
to, much less guilty of; and in a Place and Circumstance,
where Innocence was not like to be any Protection at aU
to me.
After these Thoughts, fcmethmg of Religion would
come in j and I should be considering, that this ieem'd to
me to be a Disposition of immediate Providence, and I
©ught torlook upon it, and submit to it as such $ that air
.tho*
tho" I was innocent as to Men; I was far from being in-
nocent as to my Maker 5 and I ought to look in and ex-
amine, what other Crimes in my Life, were most obvi-
ous to me$ and for which, Providence might justly inflict:
this Punishment, as a Retribution, and that I ought to sub-
mit to this, just as I would to a Ship-wreck, if it had
pleased God to have brought such a Disaster upon
me.
In its Turn, Natural Courage would sometimes takes its
Place j- and then I wouid be talking my self up to vigorous Re-
solutions, that I would not be taken, to be barbarousty used
by a Parcel of merciless Wretches, in cold Bloodj that it
were much better to have fallen into the Hands of the Sa-
vages, who were Men-Eaters, and who, I was sure, would
feast upon me, when they had taken me; than by those,
who would perhaps glut their Rage upon me, by inhuman
Toiturcs and Barbarities , that in the Cafe of the Savages,
I always resolv d to die fighting, to the last Gasp, and why
should I not do so now, seeing it was much more dread-
ful to me at least, to think of tailing into these Mens Hands,
than ever it was to think of being eaten by Men j for the
Savages, give them their due, would not eat a Man till he
was dead, and kill'd them first, as we do a Bullock ; but
that these Men had many Arts beyond the Cruelty of
Death; Whenever these Thoughts prevaisd, I was sure to
fut my self in a kind of seven with the Agitations of a
supposed Fight3 my Blood would b«il, and my Eyes sparkle
as it* I was engag'd j and I always resolved that I would
take no Quarter at their Hands, but even at last, if I could
resist no longer, I would blow up the Ship and all that
Was in her, and leave them but little Booty to boast of.
B y how much the greater Weight the Anxieties and
Perplexities of these Things we to our Thoughts while we
were at Sea, by so much the greater was our Satisfaction,
when-we saw our selves on Shore * and my Partner toid
me he dream'd, that he had a very heavy Load upon his
Back, which he was to carry -up a Hill, and found that he
was not able to stand long under it j but that the Portuguese
Pilot came and took it off his Back, and the Hill diiap-
pcar'd, the Ground before him shewing all smooth and
plain j and truly it was so, we were all like Men, who had
a Lead taken off their Backs*
For
- Foft my Part, I had a Weight taken ofT from my Heart}
that I was not able any longer to bear,- and, as I md above,
we resolv'd to go no more to Sea in that Ship: When we
came on Shore, the old Pilot, who was now our Friend,
sot us a Lodging and a Warehouse for our Goods, which
y the Way, was much- the fame; it was a little House or
Hut, with a Jaige House joining to it, all built with Canes,
and palliladoed round with large Canes, to keep out pil-
fering Thieves, of which, it seems, tliere were not a. few
m that Country j however, the Magistrates ailowM us alfa
a little Guard, and we had a Soldier with a kind of Halbert,
er Half-pike, who stood Sentinel at our Door,- to whom
we allow'd a Pint of Rice, and a little Piece of Money
about the Value of three Pence per Day, so that our Goods
were kept very fare.
Th e Fair or Mart, usually kept in this Place, had been
over some Time > however, we found tliat there were three
or four Junks in the River, and two Japanners 5 I mean,
Ships from firpnn, with Goods which they had bought in
Chinx, and were not gone away, having Japanese Mer-
chants ort Shore.
The first Thing our old Portuguese Pilot did for us,
was to bring us acquainted with three missionary Komislr
Priests, who were m the Town, and who had been there
some time, converting the People to Christiany .5 but we
thought they made but poor Work of it, and made then*
but sorry Christians wlien they had done; however, that
was none of our Business : One of these was a Frenchman^.
who they calPd Father Simon; he was a Jolly well condi-
tioned Man, very free in his Conversation, not seeming sex
serious and grave as the other two did; one of whom was
a Portuguese, and the other a Genoese but Father Simon
was courteous, easy in his Manner, and very agreeable
Company 5 the other two were more referv'd, seemed ri-
gid and austere-, and apply'd seriously to the Work they
 came about, (viz.) to talk with, and insinuate themselves
among the Inhabitants, where-ever they had Opportunity
we often eat and drank with those Men, and thoJ I mull
confess, the Conversion us they call />, of the Chinese* to
Christianity, is so far from the true Conversion, reqyrir'd^
to briirg Heathen People to the Faith of Christ, that it seems
to
to amount to little more, than letting them know the
Name of Christ, lay some Prayers to the Virgin Mary, and
her Son, in a Tongue which they understand not, and
to cross themselves and the like; yet it must be confess'd
that these Religious, who we call Missionaries, have a firm
Belief that these People stall besav'd, and that they are the
Instruments of it j and on this Account, they undergo not
only the Fatigue of the Voyage, and Hazards of living in
such Places, but oftentimes Death itself, with the most vio-
lent Tortures, for the Sake of this Work > and it would be
a great want of Charity in us, whatever Opinion we have of
the Work itself, and the Manner of their doing it, if we should
not have a good Opinion of their Zeal, who undertake it
with so many Hazai ds, and who have no Prospect of die
least Temporal Advantage to themselves.
B ut to return to my Story >• this French Priest, Father
Simon, was appointed it seems, by Order of the Chief of
the Mission, to go up to .Peking, the Royal Seat of the
Chinese Emperor, and waited only for another Priest, who
was order'd to come to him from Macao, to go along with
him 5 and we scarce ever met together, but he was invi-
ting me to go that Journey with him, telling me, how he
would shew me all the glorious Things of that mighty
Empire j and among the rest, the greatest City in the
World 5 a City, laid he, that your London and our Paris
put together cannot be equal to; This was the City of
Peking^ which I confess is very great, and infinitely full
of People; but as I look'd on those Things with different*
Eyes from other Men, so I shall 'give my Opinion of them,
in few Words, when I come in the Course of my Tra-
vels, to speak more particulaily of them.
But first, F come to my Fry ar, or Missionary ; dining
with him one Day, and being very merry together, I shew a*
some little Inclination to go with him, and he press'd me
and my Partner Very hard, and with a great many Persua-t
iions to consent; why'Father Simon, says my Partner,
why mould you desire our Company so much; You know
we are Hercticks, and you do not love us, nor, cannot keep
'us Company with any Pleasure , O ! fays he, you may
perhaps be good"Carholicks in time; my Business here is
to convert Heathens, and who knows but I may convert
you too s Very well Fatlier sud I, so you will'preach to
us
us all the Way; I won't be troublesome to jcu, says he,
our Religion does not divest us of good Manners $ besides,
fays he, we are here J ike Countrymen, and so we arc,
compared to the Place we are in ; and if you are Hugo-
nots, and I a Catholick, we may be all Chnstians at lair j
at least, said he, we are all Gentlemen, and we may con-
vex se so, without being uneasy to one anorher: I lik'd
that Part of his Discourse very well, and it began to put
me in Mind of my Priest, that I hs:d left in the Brash;
but this Father Simon did not come up to his Chiiacter,
by a great deal -y for tho' Father Simon had no appcaance
of a Criminal Levity in him neither, yet he had not that
Fund of Christian Zeal, strict Piety, and sincere A flection
to Religion, that my other good Eccleflastick had, of whom
I have laid so much.
B u t to leave him a little, tho' he never left us, nor So-
liciting us to go with him > but we had something else
before us at that time 5 for we had zilthis while our Ship,
and our Merchandize to dispose of, and we began to be
very doubtful what we should do, for we were now in a
Place of very little Business and once I was about to ven-
ture toiai! for the River of Kiiam, and the City of Narzqum:
But Providence seem'd now more visibly, as I thought, than
ever, to concern itself in our Affair and I was encou-
raged from this very Time, to think, I should one Way
or or her, get out of this tangled Circumstance, and be brought
Home to my own Country again; tho* I had not the least
View of the Manner, and when I began sometimes to
think of it, could not imagine by what Method it was to
be done : Providence, / fay, began here to clear up our Way4
a little ; and the sirst Thing that ofsered was, that our old
Porru<Tu*z.e Pilot brought a tfapr>n Merchant to us, who-
be^nn to enquire wfnt Goods we had, and in the first
Place, he bought all our Opiu n, and gave us a very good
Price for it paying us in Gold by Weight, some in small,
Pieces, of their own Coin, and some in small Wedges, of
about ten or eleven Ounces each: While we were dealing
with him for our Opium, it came into my Head, that
he miejht perhaps deal with us for the Ship too, and I*
order eel the Interpreter to propose it to him; he shrunk*
up his Shoulders at it, when it was first propos'd to
him 5 but in a few Days after, he came to me with one
of the Missionary Priests for his Interpreter, and told me,
he had a Proposal to make to me, and that was this he
had bought a great Quantity of Goods of us, when he had
no Thoughts (or Propoiais made to him) of buying the
Ship, and that therefore, he had not Money enough to
pay for the Ship; but if I would let the lame Men who
were in the Ship navigate her, he would hire the Ship to
go to Japan) and would fend them from thence to the
Philippine Islands with another Loading, which he would
pay the Freight of, before they went from Japan; and
that at their Return he would buy the Ship; 1 began to
listen to his Proposal, and so eager did my Head still rua
upon Rambling, that I could not but begin to entertain a
Notion myself of going with him, and so to fail from the
Philippine Islands, away to the South-Seas ; and according-
ly I ask'd the Japanese Merchant, if he would not hire us to
the Philippine Islands, and discharge us there; he said, no
,he could not do that, for then he could not have the Re-
turn of his Cargo j but he would discharge us in Japan,
he said* at the Ship's Return i Well, still I was for taking
him at that Proposal, and going myself; but my Partner,
wiser than myself, persuaded me fiom it, representing the
Dangers, as well of the Seas, as of the Japimses, who are
a false, cruel, and treacherous People 5 and then of the Spa-
niards at the Philippines, more false, more cruel, more trea-
cherous than they.
B u t to bring this long Turn of our Affairs to a Con-
clusion , die first Thing we had to do, was to consult with
the Captain of the Ship, and with his Men, and know if
they were willing to go to Japan j and while I was do-
ing this, the young Man, who, as I said, my Nephew had
left with me as my Companion for my^ Travels, came to
me, and told me, that he thought that Voyage promised very
fair, and that there was a great Prospect ot Advantage, and
he would be very glad if I undertook it 5 but that if I
Would not, and would give him leave, he would go as a
Merchant, or how I pleas'd to order him j that if ever he
came to England, and I was there, and alive, he would
render me a faithful Account of his Success, and it should
be as much mine as I pleas'd,
I was really loth to part with him, but considering the
Prospect of Advantage which was really coniiderable, and
that
r*» )
that he was a young Fellow, as likely to do well in it, as
any I knew, linclin'd to let him go; but first I told him, f
would consult my Partner, and give him an Answer the
next Day ,• my Partner and I dilconrs'd about it, and my
Partner made a most generous Offer; he told me, you know
k has been an unlucky Ship, and we both resolve not to
go to Sea in it again if your Steward, so he caWd my Mm,
will venture the Voyage, 111 leave my Share of the Vessel
to him and let him make the best of it 3 and if we live to
meet in England^ and he meets with Success abroad, he
fl- all account for one half of the Profits of the Ship's Fright
to us, the other shall be his- own.
I f my Partner, who was no Way concerned with my
young Man, made Mm &ich fan Offer, F could do no less than
offer him the lame; and all the Ship's Company being
willing to go with him, we made over half the Ship to
him in Property, and took a Writing from him, obliging
him to account for the other, and away he went to Ja-
son: The Japm Merchant prov'd a very .punctual hurreffc
Man to Mm* protected him at J atom, and got him a Li-
cense to come on Shore, which the Europeans in generai
have not lately obtained ; pay'd him his Freight Very
punctually* sent him to the Philippines, loaded with fas mt
and ChmA-Wkres, and a Supra-Cargo of their own, who
trafficking with the Spaniards, brought back European
Goods again, and a great Quart tiy of Cloves, and other Spice •>
and there he was not only pay'd his Freight very well, and
at a very good Price, but being not willing to sell the Ship
then, the Merchant furni/h'd him with Goods, on his own
Account j' that for seme Money, and seine Spices of his
own, which he brought with him, he went back to the
Manillas, to the Spaniards, where he fold his Cargo very
well : Here having gotten a good Acquaintance at Manilla,
he got his Ship made a free Ship 5 and the Govcrnour of
Manilla hired him, to go to Accapulco, in America, on the-
Coact of Mexico, and gave him a License to. Land there,
and travel to Mexico, and to pass in any Spanifo Ship to
Europe, with all his Men.
He made the Voyage to Accqptdco very happily, and
there he Ibid his Ship; and having ther^ also obtained Al-
lowance to travel by Land to Forto Bello, he found Means
ibme how or other, to get to Jamaica, with all his Trea-
sury
sure 5 and about eight Years after came to England
exceeding rich : Of which, 1 shall take Notice iri its
Place i in the mean Time* I return to our particular Af-
fairs.
Being now to part with the Ship, and Ship's Compa-
ny j it came before, us of Course, to consider whatRecom-
pence we should give to the two Men, that gave us such
timely Notice of the Design against us in the River of
Cambodia: The Truth was, they had done us a confide-
ble Service, and defer v'd well at our Hands j though, by the.
Way, they were a Couple of Rogues too; for as they l-e-
lievd the Story of our beingPirates, and that we had really run
away with the Ship, they came down to us, not only to
betray the Design that was form'd against us, but-to go to
Sea with us as Pirates j and one of them confess'd after-
wards, that nothing else but the Hopes of going a Rogu-
ing, brought him to do it: However, the Service they did
us was not the less; and therefore, as I had promised to be
grateful to them, I first1 order'd the Money to be pay'd to
them, which they said was due to them,on, board their
respective Ships; that is to fay, the Engltfoman nineteen
Months Pay, and to the Dutchman seven j and over and a-
bove that, I gave them, each of them, a small Sum of
Money in Gold, and which contented them very well;
then I made the Engliftman Gunner in the Ship, trie Gun-
ner being now made Second-^Mate, and Purser 4 the Dutch-
man I made Boatswain j so they were both very well
pieas'd, and prov'd very serviceable, being both able Sea-
men, and very stout Fellows.
W e were now on Shore in China; if I thought my
self banish'd, and remote from my own Country at Ben-
gale, where I had many Ways to get home for my Mo-
ney 5 what could I think cf my self now? When I was
gotten about a thousand Leagues farther off from Home,
and perfectly destitute of all manner of Piofpect of Re-
turn.
All we had-for it wa-s this, that in about four Months
Time, there was to be another Fair at the Place wheie we
were, and then we might be able to purchase all Sorts of
the Manufactures of the Country, and withal, might pos-
sibly find some Chinese Junks or Vessels from Nanqu:n,
that would be to be fold, and would carry us. and our
Goods,
Goods, whither we pleas'd this I likM very well, and re-
Mv\] ro wait; beiides, as our particular Persons were not
obnoxious, ib if any Englifli or Dutch Ships came thither,
peihaps we might have an Opportunity to load our Goods,
and get Passage to some other Piace in India, nearer
Home.
U pon these Hopes we resolv'd to continue here; but
to divert our selves we took two or three Journeys into
the Country j first we went ten Days journey to fee the
City of Nauqain, a City well worth seeing indeed 5 they
lay it has a Million of People in it; which, however, I do
not believe i it is regularly built, the Streets all exactly strait,
and cross one another, in direct Lines, which gives the Fi-
gure of it great Advantage.
But when I came to compare the miserable People of
these Countries with ours j their Fabricks, their Manner of
Living, their Government, their Religion, their Wealth,
and their Glory, (as ibme call it) I must confeis, I do
not so much as think it worth naming, or worth my
while to write of, or any that shall come after me to
read.
I t is very observeable that we wonder at the Grandeur,
the Riches, the Pomp, the Ceremonies, the Government,
the Manufactures, the Commerce, and the Conduct of these
People; not that it is to be wonder'd at, or indeed in the
least to be regarded j but because, having first a Notion of
the Barbarity of those Countries, the Rudeness and the Ig-
norance that prevails there, we do not expect to End any
such Things 10 far off.
Otherwise, what are their Buildings to the Palaces
and Royal Buildings of Europe i What' their Trade, to the
universal Commerce of England, Holland, France and Spain?
What their Cities to ours, for Wealth, Strength, Gaity of
Apparael, rich Furniture, and an infinite Variety? What
are their Ports, supply'd with a few Junks and Barks, to
 our Navigation, our Merchants Fleets, our large and pow-
erful Navys? Our City of London has more Trade than all
their mighty Empire: One Englifi?, or Dutch, or French
Man of War of 80 Guns, would fight with, and destroy
all the Shipping of China: But the Greatness of their Wealth,
their Trade, the Power of their Government, and Strength
of their Armies, is stirpising to us, because, as I have {aid,
con-
them 5 and this indeed is the Advantage with which all
their Greatness and Power is jepreiented to us; .otherwise
it is in it self nothing at all j for as I have said of their
Ships, so may be laid of their Armies and Troops; all the
Forces of their Empire, tho' they were to bring two Mil-
lions of Men into the Field together, would be able to do
nothing but ruin the Count) y, and starve themselves: If
they were tobeiiege a strong Town in Flanders, or to fight
a disciplin'd Army, one Line of German Curialfiers, or a
French Cavalry, would overthrow all the Horse of China;
a Million of their Foot could not stand before one em-
battled Body of our Infantry, posted so as not to be fur-
rounded, though they were not to be one to twenty in
Number; nay, I do not boast, if I fay, that 30000 Ger-
man or Englipj Foot, and looco French Horse, would fair-
ly beat all the Forces of China: And so of our fortified
defending Towns j there's not a fortified Town in China,
could hold out one Month against the Batteries and At-
taques of an European Army; and at the fame Time, all
the Armies of China >could never take such-a Town as
Dunkirk, provided it was not starv'd; no, not in ten Years
Siege. They have Fire*Arms, 'tis true, but they are awk-
ward, clumsy, and uncertain in going off; They have Pow-
der, but it is of no Strength; They have neither Discipline
in the Field, Exercise to their Arms, Skill to attaque, or
Temper to retreat j and therefore, I must confess, it seem'd
strange to me, when I came home, and heard our People
fay, iuch fine Things of the Power, Riches, Glory, Magni-
ficence, and Trade of the Chinese 3 because I saw and knew, that
they were a contemptible Herd, or Crowd of ignorant sor-
did Slaves, subjected to a Government qualified only to rule
iuch a People 5 and, in a Word, for I am now launched quite
beside my Design, I say, in a Word, were not its Distance •
inconceiveably great from Muscovy, and was'not rhe Musco-
vite Empire almost as rude, impotent, andrill govern'd a
Crowd of Slaves as they, the Cx,ar of Muscovy might with
much Ease drive them all out of their Country, and conquer
them in one Campaign j and had the Czar, who I since
hear is a growing Prince, and begins to appear formidable
Towns, and of the Art of our Engii
 
allaulting and
in
in the World, fallen this Way, instead of attaching the
Warlike Swedes, in which Attempt none of the Powers of
Europe would have envy'd or interrupted him ; he might
by this Time have been Emperor of China, instead of be-
ing beaten by the King of Sweden at Narva, when the
latter was not one to iix in Number: As their Strength
and their Grandeur, so their Navigation, Commerce and
Husbandry, is imperfect: and impotent, com par d to the
fame Things in Europe j also in their Knowledge, their
Learning, their Skill in the Sciences,- they have Globes and
Spheres, and a Smatch of the Knowledge of the Mathema-
ticks j but when you come to enquire into their Know-
ledge, how short-lighted ate the wisest of their Students!
they know nothing of the Motion of the Heavenly Bodies;
and so groily absurdly ignorant, that when the Sun is e-
clips'd, they think 'tis a great Dragon has assaulted and run
away with it, and they fall a clattering with all the Drums
and Kettles in the Country, to f ight the Monster away,
just as we do to hive a Swarm of Bees.
A s this is the only Excursion of this kind which I have
made in all the Acount I have given of my Travels, so I
shall make no more Descriptions of Countries and People,
'tis none of my Business, or any Part of my Design; but
giving an Account of my own Adventures, through a
Life of inimitable Wandiings, and a long Variety of Chan-
ges, which perhaps few have heard the like of, I shall iay
nothing of the mighty Places, delart Countries, and
numerous People, 1 have yet to pass through, more than
relates to my own Story, and which my Concern among
them will make necessary: I was now, as near as I can
compute, in the Heart of China, about the Latitude of
thirty Degrees North of the Line, for we were returned
from Nanquin I had indeed a Mind to see the City of
Feking, which I had heard so much of, and Father Simon
importun'd me daily to do it 5 at length his Time of go-
ing away being set, and the other Missionary, who was
to go with him, being zrriv'd from Macao, it wasnecesiary
that we st»ould resolve, either to go^ or not to go j sol re-
ferr'd him to my Partner, andlert it wholly to his Choice,
who at length resolv?d it in the Affirmative, and we pre-
paid for our Journey: We set out with very good Ad-
vantage, as to finding the Way, for we got Leave to travel
in
in the Retinue of one of their Mandarins, a kind of Vice-
roy, or piincipai Magistiate in the Province where they
reiide, and who take great State upon them, travelling
with great Attendance, and with gicat Homage from the
People, who are sometimes greatly impoverished by them,
because all the Countries they pass thio' are oblig'd to fur-
nish Provisions for them and all their Attendants : That
which I particularly obierv d, as to our travelling with his
Baggage, was this, that tho' we received surricient Provi-
sions, both tor our selves and our Horses, from the Coun-
uu "vb'"6^ >j-- ^ . .
for every Thing we had, after the Market-Price of the
Country, and the Madarin Steward, or Commiflary of
the Pjovilions, collected it duly siom us j so that our tia-
veiling in the Retinue of the Mandarin, tho'it was a very
fieat Kindness to us, was not such a mighty Favour in
im, but was indeed a gieat Advantage to him, considering
there were about thirty other People travelsd in the same
Manner besides us, under the Protection of his Retinue, or
as we may call it, under his Convoy; This, I fay, was a
great Advantage to him, for the Country furniAYd all
the Provisions Tor nothing, and he took all our Money for
them.
W e were five and twenty Days travelling to Peking,
through a Country infinitely populous, but miserably cul-
tivated j the Husbandry, Oeconomy, and the Way of living,
all very miserable, tho' they boast so much of the Industry
of the People; I say, miserable; and so it is, if we who
understand how to Jive were to endure it, or to compare
it with our own, but not so to these poor Wretches who
know no othet: The Pride of these People is infinitely
great, and exceeded by nothing, but their Poverty, which
adds to that which I call their Misory: I must needs think"
the naked Savages of America live much more happy, be-
cause, as they have nothing, so they desire nothing; where-
as these are proud and insolent, and in the main are meer
Begars and Drudges -} their Ostentation is inexpressible, and
is chiefly shew'd in their Cloaths and Buildings, and in the
keeping Multitudes of Servants or Slaves, and, which is to
the last Degree rediculous, their Contempt of all the World
but themselves.

I must confess, I travelPd more pleasantly afterwards in
the De&rts and vast Wildernesses of Grand Tartary, than
here j and yet the Roads here are well pav'd, and well kept,
and very convenient for Travellers j but nothing was more
aukward to me, than to fee such a haughty, imperious, in-
solent People, in the midst of the grossest Simplicity and
Ignorance, for all their fam'd Ingenuity is no more; My
Friend Father Simon and Ius'd to be very merry upon these
Occasions, to fee the beggarly Pride of those People ; for
Example, coming by the House of a Country Gentleman,
as Father Simon cÆ 6. him, about ten Leagues orr of the City
of Nanquin, we had first of all the Honour to ride with
the Master of the House, about two Miles; the State he
rode in, was a perfect Don Ghiickotism, being a Mixture of
Pomp and Poverty.
T n f. Habit or this greasy Don wa£ very proper for a
Scaramouch, or Merry-Andrew; being a dirty Callicoe, with
all the tawdry Trappings of a Fool's Coat, such as Hang-
ing-Sieves, Toslels, ana Cuts and Slashes almost on every
Side; it cover'd a richTastaty Vest, as greasy as a Butcher,
and which testify'd, that his Honour must needs be a most
exquisite Sloven.
H i s Horse was a poor, lean, starv'd, hobbling Creature,
such as in England might sell for about 3 o or 40 Shillings,
and he had two Slaves fbllow'd him on Foot, to drive the
poor Creature along; he had a Whip in his Hand, and he
belabours the Beast as fast about the Head, as his Slaves
did about the Tail, and thus he rode by us with about
ten or twelve Servants* and we were told he was going
from the City to his Country-Seat, about half a League
before us: We travelTd on gently, but this Figure of a
Gentleman rode away before us, and as we stop'd at a Vil-
lage about an Hour to refresti us, when we came by the
Country-Seat of this great Man, we saw him in a little
Place, before his Door, eating his Repast; it was a kind
of a Garden^but he was easy to be seen, and we were gi-
ven to understand, that the more we look'd on him, the
better he would be pkas'd.
H e fat under a Tree, something like the Palmetto Tree,
which effectually (haded him over the Head, and on the
South Side j but under the Tree allb, wasplac'da large Um-
brella, which made that Part look well enough i he fat
lolling back in a great Elbow-Chair, being a heavy corpu-
K * lent
sent Man, and his Meat being brought him by two Women
Slaves; he had two more, whole Office, I think, few
Gentlemen in Es/rope would accept of their Service in (via.)
One fed the Squire with a Spoon, and the other held the
Dish with one Hand, and scrap'd off what he let fall upon
his Worship's Beard and Tafiaty Vest, with the other;
while the great fat Brute thought it below him to employ
his own Hands in any of those familiar Offices, which
Kings and Monrachs would rather do, than be troubled
with the clumsy Fingers of their Servants.
I took this Time to think what Pain Mens Pride
puts them to : and how troublesome a haughty Temper, thus
ill-manag'd, must be to a Man of common Sense j and
leaving the poor Wretch to please himself v/ith our look-
ing at him, as if we admir'd his Pomp, whereas we really
pity'd and contemn'd him, we pursued our Journey; only
Father Simon had the Curiosity to stay to inform himself
what Dainties the Country Justice had to feed on, in all
his State j which he said he had the Honour to taste of,
and which was, I think, a Dose that an English Hound
would scarce have eaten, if it had been oster'd him, (viz.,)
a Mess of boil'd Rice, with a great piece of Garlick in it,
and a little Bag filTd with Green Pepper, and another Plant
which they have there, something like our Ginger but
smelling like Musk, and tasting like Mustard all this was
put together, and a small Lump or Piece of lean Mutton
boiPd in it; and this was his Worship's Repast, four or
five Servants more attending at a Distance. If he fed them
meaner than he was fed himself, the Spice excepted, they
must fare very coarsely indeed.
A s for our Mandarin, with whom we travel!'d, he was
respected like a King > surrounded always with his Gentle-
men, and attended in all his Appearances with such Pomp,
that J saw little of him but at a Distance; but this I ob-
lerv'd, that there Was not a Horse in his Retime, but that
our Can iers Pack-Horses in England seem to me to look
much better, but they were st> cover'd with Equipage,
Mantles, Trappings and such-like Trumpery, that you can-
not see whether they are fat or lean j in a Word, we
could see searoe any thing but their Feet and their
Heads.
I W a s now light-hearted, and all my Trouble and Per-
plexity that I have given an Account of being over, I had
no
*io Anxious Thoughts about me, which made this Jour-
ney much the pleaSriter to me; nor had I any ill Acci-
dent attended me, only in the passing or fording a small
River* my Horse sett, and rtfSde me Free of the Country,
as they call it; that is to fay; threw me in; the Place was
not deep, but it wetted me all over VI mention it because
it fpoiPd my Pocket-Book, wherein I had set down the
Names of several People and Places which I had Occasion
to remember, and which, not taking due kCare of, the
Leaves rotted, and the Words were never after to be read,
to my great Loss, as to the Names of some Places which
I touch d at in this Voyage.
At length we arriv'df at PekingI had no Body with
me but the Youth, who my Nephew, the Captain, had
given me to attend me as a Servant, and who proved very
trusty and diligent j and my Partner had no Body with
him but one Servant, who was a Kinsman; As for the
Portugeze Pilot, he being desirous to see the Court, we
gave him his Passage, that is to fay, bore his Charges, for
his Company; and to trie Mm as an Interpreter, for he un-
derstood the Language of theCountry, and spoke good French,
and a little English; and indeed, this old Man was a most use-
ful Impliment to us every where,- for we had not been a~
bove a Week at Peking, when he came laughing, Ah, Seig-
nior Inglise, &ys he, I have something to teU you, will make
your Heart glad : My Heart glad, fays I, What can that
be l I don't know any thing in this Country can either give
?ne Joy or Grief* to any great Degree: Tes, yes, said the old
Man, m broken Englfa, make yoii glad, me sorrow ; sorry
he would have said. This made me more inquisitive. Wm
said I, will it make ym sorry t Because, {aid he,^0f* have
Sr ought me here if DayJ journey, and will leave me to g9
back alone, and which way pall I get to my Tort afterwards
without a Ship, without a Horse, without Pecune? So he
called Money, being his broken Latin, of which he had a-
bundance to make us merry with,
In short, he told us there was a great Caravan of Mus-
covite and Polish Merchants in the City, and they were
preparing to set out on their Journey by Land to Muscovy*
within four or five Weeks, and he was lure we would take
the Opportunity to go with them, and leave him behind to
go back all alone: I confess, I was surpriz'd with his News^i
a secret Joy spread it self over my whole Soul, which I
 
^ z cannot
cannot describe, and never felt before or since, and I had no
Power for a good while to ipcak a Word to the old Man
but at last I turn'd to him; How do you know this, laid
'I, are you sure it is true? Yes, fays he, I met this Morn-
ing, in the Street, an old Acquaintance of mine, an Arme-
nian, or one you call a Grecian, who is among them ; he
came last fiwn Ajlracan, and was designing to go to Ton-
quin, where I formerly knew him, but has alter'd his Mind,
and is now resolved to go back with the Caravan to Muscow,
and ib down the River of Wolga to Asiracan: Well, Siegnior,
Jays I, do not be uneasy about being left to go back alone,
if this be a Method for my Return to England, it shall be
5 our Fault, if you go back to Macao at all: We then went
to consulting together what was to be dorje, and I ask'd
my Partner what he thought of the Pilot's News, and
whether it would suit with his Aflairs? He told me lie
would do just as I would, for he had setled all his Aflairs
so well at Bengale, and left his Effects in such good Hand s,
that as we had made a good Voyage here, if he could vest
it in China Silks, wrought and raw, such as might be
worth the Carriage, he would be content to go to England,
and then make his Voyage back to Bengale, by the Com*
pany's Ships.
Having resolv'd upon this, we agreed, that if our
Portugal Pilot would go with us, we would bear his Char-
ges to Muscow, or to England if he pleas'd; nor indeed were
we to be esteem'd over generous in that Part neither, if
we had not rewarded him farther, for the Service he had
done us was really worth all that, and more,- for he had
not only been a Pilot to us at Sea, but he had been also like a
Broker for us on Shore; and his procuring for us t\\tjapan
Merchant, was some Hundreds of Pounds in our Pockets:
So we cousuited together about it, and being willing to gra-
tify him, which was indeed but doing him Justice, and ve-
ry willing also to have him with us Desides, for he was a
most neceilary Man on all Occasions, we agreed to give
him a Quantity of coin'd Gold, which, as I compute it,
came to about 17s Pounds Sterling between us, and to bear
all his Charges, both for himself and Horse, except only a
Horse to carry his Goods.
Having settled this among our selves, we calTd him
to let him know what we had resolv'dj I told him, he
had complain'd of our being like to letliim goback alone, and
I was
I was now to tell him we was resolve! he should not go
back at all: That as we had refblv'd to go to Europe with
the Caravan, we refblv'd also he should go with us> and
that we call'd him to know his Mind: He shook his Head,
and said, it was a long Journey, and he had no Pecune to car-
ry him thither, or to siibsist himself when he came there:
We told him, we behev'd it was so, and therefore we had
resolvd to do something for him, that should let him see
how sensible we were of the Service he had done us, and al-
so how agreeable he was to us j and then I told him what
we hadrelblv'd to give him here, which he might layout as
we would do our own j and that as for his Charges, if he
would go with us, we would sot him fare a-lhore, (Life
and Casualties excepted) either in Muscovy or England,
which he would, at our own Charge, except only the Car-
riage of his Goods.
H e receiv'd the Proposal like a Man transported, and
fold us he would go with us over the whole World ,• and
so, in short, we all prepar'd our solves for the Journey:
However, as it was with us, so it was with tie other
Merchants, they had many Things to do, and instead of
being ready in five Weeks, it was four Months and some
odd Days before all Things were got together.
I t was the Beginning of February, our Stile, when we
sot out from Peking; my Partner and the old Pilot had gone
express back to the Port where we had first put in, to
dispose of some Goods which we had left there; and I
with a Chinese Merchant, who I had some Knowledge
of at Nanquin, arid who came to Peking on his own Af-
fairs, went to Nanquin, where I bought ninety Pieces of
fine Damasks, with about two hundred Pieces of other
very fine Silks, of several sorts, some mix'd with Gold,
and had all these brought to Peking against my Partner's Re-
turn j besides this, we bought a very large Quantity of
Raw Silk, and some other Goods, our Cargo amounting
in these Goods only, to about three thousand five hundred
Pounds Sterling, which, together with Tea, and some fine
Callicoes, and three Camel Loads of Nutmegs and Cloves,"
loaded in all eighteen Camels for our Share, besides those
we rode upon 5 which with two or three spare Horses,
and two Horses loaded with Provisions, made us in stort
16 Camels and Horses in our Retinue.
The Company was very great, and, as near as I can re-
K 3 member
member, made between 3 and 400 Horse and Camels, and
upwards of a hundred and twenty Men, very well armed"
and provided for all 'Events: For as the Eastern Caravans
awe subject to be attacked by the Arabsy so are these by the
Tartars-, but they arc not altogether so dangerous as the
Arabs, nor so barbarous when they prevail.
The Company consisted of People of several Nations*
such us, Muscovites chiefly, for there were above Sixty of
them who were Merchants or Inhabitants of Muscowy tip*
of them some were Livonians, and to our particular Satis-
faction, Five of them were Scots, who appeared also to be
Men of great Experience in Business, and Men of very good
-Substance.
When we had travelled one Days Tonrney, the Guides,
*vho were Five in Number, called all the Gentlemen and
Merchants, that is to fay, all the Passengers, except ;t£e Ser-
vants, to a great Council, as they call d it: At tjiis great
Council every one deposited a certain Quantity of Money
to 3 common Stock, for the neecstary Expence of buying
Forage on the Way, where it was not otherwise to be
had, and for satisfying the Guides, getting Horses, and the
like: And here they constituted the Journey, as theycalfd
it, (*;/*.) They named Captains andOfficers, to draw us
all up, and give the Command in case of an Attack., and
gave every one their Turn of Command; Nor was this
•forming us into Order, any more'than what we found
seed fill upon the Way, as (hall be observed in its Place.
Th e-. Road all on this fide of the Country is very po-
pulous aad is full of Potters, and Earth-makers, that
is to lay, People that tampered the Earth for the China-
Ware $ and as I was coming along, our Portugal Pilot, who
had always something or other to fay to make us merry,
came sheering to me, and told me he would show me the
greatest Rarity in all the Country, and that I should have
Siis to say or Ctyinpi, after aH the fll-humour'd Things £
 had laid" of it, that ! had seen one Thing which was not
to fe seen in aH the World- beside: t was very importu-
nate to know what ir was, at last fie told me it was a
Gentleman's House Built all with China-Wan•; Well, iays
1,- are not* the Materials os' their Building the Product of
their own Country j and so it is all China-War e> is it not?
No, no, &yi lie, I mean, it is a House all made of China-
Ware, such £$ you call fom^nglatyi qx as.it. is caU'd in
our Country, ForceUain ; .Well, fays I, such a thing may
be; how big is it? Can we carry it in a Box upon a Ca-
mel? If we can, we will buy it: Upon a Camel J fays the
old Pilot, holding up both his Hands, why there is a Fami-
ly of Thirty Veofle lives in it.
I was then curious indeed to fee it, and when I came
to it, it was nothing but this; it was a Timber Houie,
or a House built, as we call it in England, with Lath and
Tlaister, but all the Plaistering was really Ch'mor-Ware^ that
is to sey, it was plaister'd with the Earth that makes China-
Ware.
The Outside, which the Sun shone hot upon, was gla-
ired, and look'd very well, perfect white* and painted with
blue Figures, as the large China-Ware in England is faint-
ed, and hard, as if it had been burnt: As to the Inside, all
the Walls, instead of Wainscot, were lined up with har-
dens and painted Tiles, like the little square Tiles we call
Galley-Tiles in England, all made of the finest China, and
the Figures exceeding fine indeed, with extraordinary Va-
riety of Colours mix'd with Gold, many Tiles making but
one Figure, but join'd so artificially, the Morter being made
of the iame Earth, that it was very hard to fee where the
Tiles met: The Floors of the Rooms were of the fame
Composition, and as hard as the earthen Floors we have in
life in several Parts of England, especially Lmcoktstvre, Not-
tinghamshire, Leicestershire, &c. as hard as Stone, and
smooth, but not burnt and painted, except some smaller
Rooms, like Closets, which were all as it were paved with-
the fame Tilej the Cielings, and, in a Word, all the Po-
stering-Work in the whole House were of the fame Earth i
and, alter all, the Roof was co ver'd with Tiles of the fame,
but of a deep shining black,
T h i s was a China Ware-house indeed, truly and literal-
ly to be call'd se j and had I not been upon the Journey, I
could have staid seme pays to sec and examine the Parti-
culars of it: They told me there were Fountains and Fish-
ponds hi the Garden, all paved at the bottom and sides
with the fame, and fine Statutes set up in Rows on the
Walks, entirely fprm'd of the ForcelUn Earth, and burnt
whole-
As this is one of the Singularities of China, so they may
be allow'd to excel in it > but 1 am very sure they excel in
in their Accounts of it i for they told me such incredible
& 4. Things
Things of their Performance in Crockery-Ware, for such it
is, that I care not to relate, as knowing it could not be
true j they told me in particular of one Workman that
made a Ship with all its Tackle, and Masts, and Sails, m
Earthen-Ware, big enough to carry Fifty Men: If he had
told me he launched it, and made a Voyage to Japan in it,
I might have said something to it indeed;; but as it was, I
knew the whole Story, which was in short, asking Par-
don for the Word, that the Fellow lied j so I smiled, and
This ocsd Sight kept me two Hours behind the Cara-
van, for which, the Leader of it for the Day, fined me a-
bout the Value of three Shillings, and told me, if it had been
tliree Days Journey without the Wall, as it was three Days
within, he must nave fined me four times as much, and
made me ask Pardon the next Council Day; so I promi-
sed to be more orderly \ for indeed I found afterward the
Orders made for keeping altogether, were absolutely neces-
sary for our common Safety.
I n two Days more, we pass'd the great China WaD,
made for a Fortification against the Tartars; and a very
great Work it is, going over Hills and Mountains in a
needless Track, where the Rocks are impassible, and the
Precipices such as no Enemy could possibly enter, or indeed
climb up, or where if they did, no Wall could hinder
them: They tell us, its Length is near a Thousand Engli/b
Miles, but that the Country is five Hundred in a strait
jnealured Line, which the Wall bounds, without meafur*
ing the Windings and Turnings it takes; 'tis about four
Fathom high, and as many thick in some Places.
I stood still an Hour or thereabout; wishout trespass
Hng out;-Orders, for Jo long the Caravan was m fajpng the
Gfitti I 'fay, I stood still an}Hour I fay to lopk at it on every
Ssde, near, itnd" far ofi\, I mean, what was withm my View j
and the <5mde'6f our Caravan, w&> had been extolling it
for ^he ; Wonder of the World, was mighty eager to hear
my Opinion of it 5 I told him it . was a most excellent thing
ro keep off the Tartars, j which he happen d not to under-
ftend as I meant it, and so took it for a Compliment > but the
old Pilot hugh'd: O Seignior.Inglese, fays he, you speak in
Colours: In Colours,/^ I„ what do you, mean by that} Why,
you speak what looks white this way, and black that -bay $
gay one way, and dull another wayy you tell him it is a good

Wall to keep out Tartars; you tell me by that, it is good
for nothing but to keep out Tartars* or it will keep out
none but Tartars \ I understand you, Seignior higkfa I un-
derstand you, lays he Joking, but Seignior Chinese under-
stand you his own way.
Well, fiys I, Seignior, do you think it would stand
out an Army of our Country People, with a good Train
of Artillery 5 or our Engineers, with two Companies of
Miners ;> would not they batter it down in ten Days, that
an Army might enter in Battalia, or blow it up in the Air,
Foundation and all, that there should be no sign of it left?
Ay, ay, fays he, I know that. The Chinese wanted mighti-
ly to know what I said, and I gave him leave to tell him
a few Days after, for we was then almost out of their
Country, and he was to leave us in a little time afterward 5
but when he knew what I had fiid, he was dumb all the
rest of the Way, and we heard no more of his fine Story,
of the Chinese Power and Greifneis, while he stay'd.
A f t e r we had pass'd this mighty Nothing, cali'd a Wall,
something like the Pifts Wall, £o famous in TZorthumher-
land, and ouilt by the Romans, we began to find the Coun-
try thinly inhabited, and the People rather confined to live
in fortified Towns and Cities, as being subject to the In-
roads and Depredations of the Tartars, who rob in great
Armies, and therefore are not to be resisted by the naked
Inhabitants of an open Country,
And here I began to find the Necessity of keeping to-
gether in a Caravan as we travelled > for we saw several
Troops of Tartars rovfng about j but when I came to lee
them distinctly, 1 wonder'd more that the Clme/e Emyir£
could be conquers by sticH contemptible .Fellows> for tfctey
are a meer Hoord or Crowd of wild Fellows, keeping no
Orders and under {fonding no Discipline, or Manner of Fight,
Th feiR Horses are poor lean starved Creatures, taught
nothing, and are fit stir noticing; and this we found the
first Day we law them, which was after we entred the
wilder Part of the Countryour Leader for the Day, gave
Leave for about sixteen of us to go a hunting, as they call
irj and what'was this but h$ttin£j' of $ieep *. however, it
may be call^if'u^tiiig^tpb'V for tne Creatures are the wild-
est and swiftest ' of Foot that ever I saw of their Kind; on-
ly they wiH not Tun a great way; and you are iure of
Sport when you begin the Chaxrc; for they appear genera!
ly thirty or forty in a Flock, and like- tmp Shreep> a] way
£eep together when they fly.
Ik Pursuit of thiip pdfj fort of Game, it was our Hap to
ipect with-about forty Tartan^ whether they were hunt-,
mg Mutton as we were/ or whether they lopk'd for an^.
Other, kind, of Prey, I know not j but as soon as they saw
t*s, one. of them blew a kini of a, Horn very loud, but
with a barbarous Sound, that I had never heard ;befbre, and by
the way, never care to hear again: We all soppos'd this-
was;, to call their Friends about them, and* so it was* for
iti less than half a Quarter of an Hour, a;Troop pf forty or
^fry more appear'd, at about a Mile du'vapce, but Qur Work,
was over first, as it happen'd*
Ok e of the Scots Merchants of Mttfcop,- happen'd to
be;amongstus, arid as soon as he rjueard the Horn, he told
tisk in short, that we had nothing to do, but to charge them
immediately, without loss of Time > and drawing us up in .
a fcinej he ask'd if-we were resolv'd? We told him we
were ready to follow him; so he rode directly up to them:
They stood :gaz\ng at us like a meer Crowd* drawn up in
Tip Order, nor shewing the Face of any Order at all; but
as soon as they saw us advance, they let fly their Arrows,
which however missM us, very happily; it soems they mi-,
.stook not their Aim, but their Distance; for their Arrows
all fell a little short of/us, but with so true ap-Aim, that
liad we. been about twenty Yards nearer, we must have had'
s£vcra].Men wounded, if not kill'd.
* Immed i a tel y we halted* and-tho* it-wa§. at a great

offKis Horse, kili'd the second -yvith his Pistol, and the
third ran away, and thus ended our Fight j but we had this
Misfortune attending it, (viz.) that all our Mutton that we
had in chace, got away: We had not a Man kili'd or hurt; but
as for the Tartars, there was about five of them kili'd;
how many were wounded, we knew not but this we
knew, that the other Party was so frighted with the Noise
of our Guns, that they made off, and never made any At-
tempt upon us.
We were all this while in the Chinese Dominion, and
therefore the Tarter s were not so bold as afterwards; bur
in about five Days we enter'd a vast great wild Delarr,
which held us three Days and Nights March j and we were
obliged to carry our Water with us in great Leather-Bot-
tles, and to encamp all Night* just as I have heard they do
in the Defarts of Arabia,
I ask'd out Guides, Whose Dominion this wa"s in?
and they told me, this was a kind of Border, that might
be caird No Man's Land; being a Part of the Great Kara-
katbajy or Grand Tartary, but that however it was recko-
ned, to China j that there was no Care taken here, to pre-
serve it from the Inroards of Thieves, and therefore it was
teckon'd the worst Delart in the whole March,; tho' we
were to go over some much larger*
. In pasting this Wilderness, which* I confess, was at the
first View very frightful to me, we law two or three times
little Parties of the Tartars^ but they seem'd to be upon
their own'Affairs, and to have no Design upon usj and ib,
Jike the Man who met the "Devil, if they had nothing to
lay to us, we had nothing to fay to them i we let them go.
Once however, a Party of them came so near, as to
ifond and gaze at us; whether it was to consider what
they should do, (viz,.) to attack, us, or not attack us, that
we knew not j but when we were pass'd at some distance
By them, we made a Rear-Guard of sen tv. Men, and stood
ready for themi letting the Caravan pals half a Mile, or
thereabouts, before us, after a while they rqarcVd;off, on-
ly we found they aslaulted us with five Arrows at their
parting j one of which, wounded a Horse, & that it dis-
abled him j and we left him the next t^ty, popr Creature,
in great need of a good Farrier ,* we suppose they $r*ight
{hoot more Arrows, which might fall short of us, but we
4aw no.more.Arrows ox Tartars, that time.
 
W h traveled near a Month after this, the Ways Being not
so good as at first, tho* still in the Dominions of the Em-
peror of China, but lay, for .the most Part in Villages, feme
of which were fortified, because of the Incursions of the
Tartars; When we came to one of these Towns, (it was
about two Days and a half*s Journey before we were to:
come to tie City of Naum) I wanted to buy a Camel; of
which' there, are plenty to be sold ail the Way upon that.
Road, and of Horses also, such as they arc, because so ma-
ny Caravans coming that way, they are often wanted: The
Person that I "/poke to to get me a Camel, would have gone
and fetch'd it for me, but I like a Fool must be officious,
»nd go my self along with him: The Place was about two
Miles out of the Village, where> it seems, they kept the
Camels and Horses feeding under a Guard.
I w a lk'd it on Foot with my old Pilot in Company,
and a, Chinese, being very desirous, forsooth, of a little V;*-
riety :• When we came to this Place* it was a low marshy
Ground, wall'd round with a stone Wall, piled up dry,
without Morter or Earth among it, like a Park, with a
little Q uard of Chinese Soldiers at the Door. Having bought
a Camel, and agreed for the Price, I came away, and th*
Chinese Man that went with me, led the Camel; when on
a sodden-came up stye Tartan on Horse-back,- two of 'em
seiz'd the Fellow, and took the Camel from him> while
tfye other three step'd up £o me, and my old Klot: Seeing
us as-it were unarm'd, for I had no Weapon about, me bur
my Sword, which could but ill defend me against three
Horsemen; the first; .that came up, stop'd stiort upon my
drawing my Sword >. (for they ave errant Cowards) but a
second coming upon my kit> gave me a Blow on the
Jftead, winch I never felt till afterward, and wondered when
I came to my self* what was the matter with me, and
where I was, for he laid me flat on the Grounds but my
never-Failing old Pijot, the TortugniK* (so Providence un-
locked for directs Deliverances fÆm Dangers, which to us
are unforeseen) had a Piftol in his Pocket, which I knew
nothing of, nor the Tartars neither; if they had, I sop-
pose they would not have attacks us l But Cowards are
always widest when there is no. Danger. i - >
T h l old Man seeing me down, with a bold Heart step'd

Force., a little toward Mm* witft tht other he {Btothim
 
iatc*
into*thc Head, and laid him dead upon the Spot; he then
immediately step'd up to Mm who had stop'd us, as I &id,
and before he could come forward again, (for it was all
done as it were in a Moment) made a Blow at Mm with
a Sey meter which he always wore, but missing the Man,
cut his Horse into the side of his Head, cut one of Ms
Ears off by the Root, and a great Slice down the side of
Ms Face; the poor Beast enraged with the Wounds, was no
more to be governed by Ms Rider, tho' the Fellow &t
well enough too > but away he flew, and carry d him quite
out of the Pilot's Reach, and at some distance riling upon
Ms hind Legs, tMew down the Tartar, and fell upon him.
I n this Interval the poor Chinese came in, who had loft
the Camel, but he had no Weapon j however, seeing the
Tartar down, and Ms Horse fallen upon him* he runs to
Mm, and seizing upon an ugly ill-favour'd Weapon he had
by his side, something like a Pole-ax, but not a Pole-ax
neither j hewrench'd it from Mm, and made (hist to knock
Ms Tartarian Brains out with it: But my old Man had
the third Tartar to deal with still, and seeing he did not
fly, as he expected, nor come on to fight him, as he ap-
prehended, but stood stock still, the old Man stood still too,
and falls to work with Ms Tackle to charge his Pistol a-
gain $ but as soon as the Tartar saw the Pistol, whether h£
iupposed it to be the fame or another, I know not; but
away he seowered, and left my Pilots my Champion I cal-
led him afterward, a com pleat Victory."'
B y tins, time I was a little awake, for I thought
when I &st began to awake, that I had been in a
sweet Sleep, but, as. I laid above, I wondered where! was,
how I came upon the Ground, and what wa§ the Matter:
In a Word, a few Moments after, as Sense returned, I felt
Pain, tho' I did not know where y I dap'd my Hand tb
my Head, and took it away bloody j then I selt my' HeaS
ach, and then in another Moment, Memory returned, and
every thing was present to me again. *'
I jumpJd up upon my Feet instantly, and got hold of
my Sword, but no Enemies in view: I found a Tartar lie
boking farther, \ &w my Champion and' Deliverer, who
had been to see what the Ohimfi had done, coming nack
with his Hanger in his Hand } the old Man seeing me on
any Feet, came running to me, and embraced me with>
great deal of joy, being afraid-before that L had been kil-
 
led,
Mi and seeing me bloody, would see how I was hurt, btie
it was not much, only what we call a broken Head; nei-
ther did I afterwards find any great Inconvenience from
the Blow, other than the Place which was Hurt, and which
was well again in two or three Days.
W e made no great Gain however by this Victory, for
we lost a Camel, and gained a Horse j but that which was
remarkable, when we came back to the Village, the Man
demanded to be paid for the Camel; I disputed it, and it
was brought to a Hearing before'the Chines* Judge of the
Place i that is to fay, in English, we went before a Justice
•of the Peace: Give him his due, he acted with a great deal
of Prudence and Impartiality j and having heard both Sides,
he gravely ask'd the Chinese Man, that went with me to
buy the Camel, whose Servant he was? I am no Servant,
fays he, but went with the Stranger: At whose Request,
fays the Justice? At the Stranger s Request, fays he j why
then, fays the Justice, you were the Stranger's Servant for
the Time, and the Camel being delivers to his Servant, it
was delivered to him, and he must pay for it.
I confess, the thing was so clear, that I had not a
'Word to lay,- but admirino; to see such just Reaibning
upon the Consequence, and io accurate stating the Cause, 1
pay d willingly for the Camel, and sent for another 5 but
you may observe, I sent for it, I did not go to fetch it
my self any more, I had enough of that.
The City of Naum is a Frontier of the Chinese Empire;
they call it fortified, and so it is, as Fortifications go there.;
for this I will venture to affirm, that all the Tartars inKa-
mk^thetie, which I believe are some Millions, could not batter
down the Walls with their Bows and Arrows,* but to call
it strong, if it were attacked with Cannon, would.be to
make those who understand it, laugh at you.
W b wanted, as I have said, above two Days Journey of
this City, when Messengers were sent express to every
Part of the Road, to tell all Travellers and Caravans, to
halt till they had a Guard sent to them; for that* an unu*
sal Body of Tartars, making ten Thousand in all, had ap^
pear d in the Way, about thirty Miles beyond the City.
This was very bad News to Travellers \ however, it wa«.
carefully done of theGovernour,and we were very glad to hear
we should have a Guard ,* accordingly two Days after, we had
2&& Soldiers sent us from a Garrison of tm Ckweses, oti
«ur left, and three hundred more from the City of Kaunr,
and with those we advanced boldly; the three hundred Sol-
diers from Naum, march'd in our Front, the two hundred1
in our Rear, and our Men on each Side of our Camels with
pur Baggage, and the whole Caravan in the Center j in this
Order, and wejl prepared for Battle, we thought our selves
a Match for the whqle ren thousand Mongul Tartars, if they
had appear'di, but the next Day when they did-appear, it
was quite another Thing.
I t was early in the Morning, when marching from a
little well situated-Town called Changu, we had . a River to
pass, where we wereoblig'd to.ferry \ and had the Tartars had:
any Intelligence, then had been the Time to have attak'd
us, when the Caravan being over, the Rear Gaurd was
behind j but they did "not appear there,
About^ three Hours after, when we were entered up-
on a Defart of about fifteen or iixteen Miles over, behold,
by a Cloud of Dust they rais'd, we saw an Enemy was at:
Hand, and they were at Hand indeed* for they came on
upon the Spur.
The Cfrineses> our Guard on the Front, who had talk'd
& big the Da/ before, began to stagger, and the Soldiers
&equently look'd behind them, which is a certain Sign in
^Soldier, .that he is just ready to run away; my old Pilot was
o£ my Mind, and being near me, he call'd out, Seignior
IngUfa siys he, those Fellows must be encourag'd, or they
will -ruin us all; for if the Tartars come on, they wilL
never stand it j 1 am: of -your Mind, said J, but what Course
must be. done? Done ! say In* let fifty of our Man advance
and stank them on each Wing, and encourage them, anch
they will fight like brave Fellows in brave Company > but'
without it, they will every Man turn his back i immedi-
ately I rod up to our Leader, and told him, who was ex-
ajctly of cur mind and accordingly, fifty of us marchM*
to the right; Wing, an J fifty to the left, and the rest made
a Line or Reserve j and fo we march^d^ leaving the last two^
hundred Men to malce another Body, by themselves* and to
guard the Camels j only , that if need were, they sliould
fitid-a/hundeed Men, to assist the last fifty.
<v,£*r a, wordy: ths T&rtats came on, and-an innumerable-
•Company? they were j how many, we could not tell, but
ten Thouifond .we thought was the least: A Party of them
sa^e first^anduview dpur Posture, .traversing theGround
„ in
in the Front of our Line > and as we found them withit*
Gun-mot, our Leader ordered the two Wings to advance
iwiftly, and give them a Salvo on each Wing with their
Shot, which was done j but they went off, and I suppose
went back to give an Accout of trie Reception they were like
to meet with: Aud indeed that Salute clogg'd their Sto-
machs, for they immediately halted, stood a while to con-
sider of it, and wheeling off to the left, they gave over the
Design, and said no more to us for that time » whkh was
very agreeable to our Circumstances, which were but very
indifferent for a Battle with such a Number.
Two Days after this, we came to the City Namm, or
TSaurn j we thank'd the Governour for his Care for us, and
collected to the Value of a hundred Crowns, or thereabouts
which we gave to the Soldiers sent to guard us j and here
we rested one Day: This is a Garriibn indeed, and there were
nine hundred Soldiers kept here $ but the Reason of itwas>
that formerly the Muscovite Frontiers lay nearer to them
than they do now, the Muscovites having abandon'd that
Part of the County (which lies from this City West, for
about two hundred Miles) as desolate and unfit for Use $
and more especially, being ib very remote* and Co difficult
to send Troops thither for its Defence; for we had yet a-
bove two thousand Miles to Muscovy % properly Co calTd.
After this, we paft'd several great Rivers, and two
dreadful Delarts, one of which we were sixteen D&ys passing
over, and which, as I seid, was to becall'd No mm's Lmdi
and on the 13 th of April we came to the Frontiers of the
Muscovite dominions : I think the first Cky, or Town,
or Fortress, whatever itjmight be call'd* that belong'd to
the Czar of Muscovy, was call'd Argun, being on the West
Side 6f tbe;.. ft/Ver' Argun.'. •
I ctould n6r, but discover an infinite Satisfaction, that I
was now airtvU in, as I call'd it, a Christian Country, or
at least in a "Country governed by Christians, 5 for tho' the
Muscovites., do, in my Qpmim, but inst deserve the Name of
Christians, vet such they pretend to be, and are very de-
vout in their Way: It would certainly occur to any Man
who travels the World as 1 have done, and wha hsA mf
Power of Rejection V t sey, it would occur to him, to-
reflect what a Blessing it is to be brought into the World,
where the Name of God, and of a Redeemer is known,
worstrip'd and adord j and not where the People given pp
by Heaven to strong Delusions, worship the Devils and
prostrate themselves to Stocks and Stones j worship Mon-
sters, Elements, horrible shaped Animals, and Statues, or
Images of Monsters: Not a Town or City we pafs'dthro',
but had their Pagods, their Idols, and their Temples, and
ignorant People worshipping even the Works of their own
Hands.
Now we came where at least a Face of the Christian
Worship appeared, where the Knee was bow'd to Jesus}
and whether ignorantly or not, yet the Christian Religion
was own'd, and the Name of the true God was calFd up-
on, and adored j and it made the very Recestes of my Soul
rejoice to fee it: I saluted the brave Scots Merchant I men-
tioned above, with my first Acknowledgment of this -> and
taking him by the Hand, I said to him, blesied be God, we
are once again come among Christians: He smiled, and an-
swered, do not rejoice too sbon Countryman, these Mus-
covites are but an odd sort of Christians 5 and but for the
Name of it, you may fee very little of the Substance, for
some Months farther of our Journey.
Well, fays I, but still 'tis better than Paganism, and
wor Clipping of Devils. Why, 1 11 tell you, fays he, except
the Ruffian Soldiers in Garrisons,, and a few of the Inhabi-
tants of the Cities upon the Road, all the fest of this Coun-
try, for above a thousand Miles farther, is inhabited by the,
worst, and most ignorant of Pagans j and so indeed we
found it. ,
W e were now launch'd into the greatest Piece of foK4
Earth, if I understand any thing of the Surface of the Globe,
that is to be found in any Part of the World j we had at
least twelve hundred Miles to tke Sea, Eastward ^ ,we had
at least two thousand to the Bottom of the BaJrJck Sea,
Westward; and almost three thousand Miles, if we left that
Sea, and went on West to the British and French Channels:
We had full five thousand Miles to the Indian, or Persia*
Sea, Souths and about eight hundred Miles to the Frozen
Sea, North j nay, rf some People may be believed, tkcre
might be no Sea North-East, 'till we came round the Pole,
and consequently into the North-West, and so had a Con-
tinent of Land into America ?> no Mortal knows where,
tho' I could give ibine Reaspns, why I believe that to be
a Mistake too.
A s we entered into the Muscovite pbznmions, a good
whik
while Before we came to any considerable Town, we hats
nothing to observe there but this; first, That all the Rivers
run to the East: As I understood by the Charts which
some in our Caravan had with them, it was plain, that all
.those Rivers ran into the Great River Yamour, or Gam-
itnour: This River, by the natural Course of it must run
into the East Sea, or Chinese Ocean: The Story they tell
us, that the Mouth of this River is choak'd up with Bull-
ruihes of a monstruous Growth, (viz.) three Foot about
and twenty or thirty Foot high, I must be allow'd to fay,
I believe nothing or; but as its Navigation is of no Uie,
.because there is no Trade that way, the Tartars, to whom
•alone it belongs, dealing in nothing but Cattle, Co no Body
that ever I heard of, has been curious enough, either to go
down to the Mouth of it in Boats, or come up from the
Mouth of it in Ships j but this is certain, that this River
-running due East, in the Latitude of 60 Degrees, carries a
.vast Concourse of Rivers along with it, and finds an Ocean,
to empty itself in that Latitude} fb we are sure of Sea
there.
Some Leagues to the North of this River, there are se-
veral considerable Rivers, whose Streams run as due North
as the Tumour runs East, and these are all found to join
their Waters with the Great River Tartarus, nam'd so,
from- the northernmost Nations of the Mongtd Tartars,
>,who the Chinese fay, were the first Tartars in the World;
and who, as our Geographers alledge are the Gog and Ma-
gog, mentions in sacred Story.
TiiES E Rivers running an Northward, as well as all
the other Rivers, I am yet to speak of, make it evident,
that the Northern Ocean bounds the Land also on that
fide 5 fb that it does not seem rational in the least to think,
that the Land can extend itself to join with America on
that Side, or that there is not a Communication between
the Northern and the Eastern Ocean 5 but of this I shall
fay no more, it was my Observation at that Time, and
therefore I take Notice of it in this Place. We now ad-
vanced from the River Arguna by easy and moderate Jour-
•neys, and were very visibly oblig'd to the Care the Cfcar of
Muscovy has taken to have Cities and Towns built in as
many Places as are possible to place them, where his Sol-
diers keep Garrison something like the Stationary Soldiers
glac'd by the Romans ist: the -remotest Countries of their
Em-
Empire, fcmc of which I had read were particularly plac'il
in Britain for the Security of Commerce, and for the lodg-
ing of Travellers $ and thus it was here j for where-ever we
came, tho* at these Towns and Stations, the Garrisons and
tjbvernour were Ruffians, and professU Christians, yet the
Inhabitants of the Country were meer Pagans, sacrificing
to Idols, and: worshipping the Sun, Moon, and Stars, or all
the Host of Heaven, and not only so, but were of all the
Heathens m&¥agans that ever I met with, the most bar-
barous, except only that they did not eat Man's Flesh, a*
our Savages of j4mmc& did.
Some Instances of this we met with in the Country
between Argtma, where we enter the Muscovite Domini-
ons, and a City ofTartArs aniRuJ/tans together, call'd Nort-
kius6w; in which Space is a continu'd Desart or Forest,
which cost us twenty Days to travel over it: In a Village
near the last of those Places I had the Curiosity to go and
see their Way of Living, which \s most brutilh and unsuf-
Jerable,- they hajd- I suppose a great Sacrifice that Day, for
there stood out upon an old Stump of a Tree, an Idol
made of Wood, frightful as the Devil 5 at least as any Thing
we can think of to represent the Devil, can be made j it
had a Head certainly not Co much as resembling any Crea-
ture that the World ever saw; Ears as big as Goats Horns,
and as high; Eyes as big as a Crown-Pieces a Nose like a
a-ooked stands Horn, and a Mouth extended four cprrierM,
tike that of a Lion, with horrible Teeth, hooked like a
PaiTot's under Bill 3 it was drested up in the filthiest Man-
ner that you could suppose j its upper Garment was of
Sheep-Skins, with the Wool outward, a great Tartar Bon-
net on the Head, with two Horns growing throngh its
it was about eight Foot high, yet had no Feet or Legs, or
any other Proportion of Parts,
This Scare-crow was setup at the outer Side of the
Village, and when I came near to it, there were sixteen or
seventeen Creatures, whether Men or Women I could not
tell, for they make no Distinction by their Habits, either of
Body or Head , these lay all flat on the Ground* round
this formidable Block of shapeless Wood : I saw no Motion a-
mong them any more,than if they had been LogsofW ood like
t-tair Idol j at first, I really thought they had been so > but when
I came a little nearer, they started up upon their Feet, and
nis'6 a howling Cry,, as if it had been so many deep-mouth'd:
Hounds,
Hounds, and walked away as if they were difpleas'd at our
disturbing them: A little Way off from this Monster, and
at the Door of a Tent or Hut, made all of Sheep^Skins'
and Cow-Skins, dry'd, stood three Butchers, / thought they
v»ere s#ch; for when I came nearer to them, I found they
had long Knives in their Hands, and in the Middle of the
Tent appears three Sheep kuTd, and one young Bullock or
Steer: These, it seems, were Sacrifices to that senseless Log
of an Idol, and these three Men, Priests, belonging to it j
and the seventeen prostrated Wretches, were the People who
brought the Offering, and were making their Prayers to
that Stock.
I confess, I was more mov'd at their Stupidity and
this bruitifh Worship of a Hobgoblin, than ever I was at any
Thing in my Life j to see God's most glorious and best
Creature, to whom he had granted so many Advantanges,
even by Creation, above the rest of the Works of his Hands,
vested with a reasonable Soul, and that Soul, adorn'd with
Faculties and Capacities, adapted both to honour his Maker,
and be honoured by him, / say> to see it funk and degene-
rated to a Degree so more thin stupid, as 10 prostrate it
self to a frightful Nothing, a meer imaginary Object,
dress'd up by themselves, and made terrible to themselves
by their own Contrivance j adorn'd only with Clouts and
Rags j and that this sliould be the Effect of meer Igno-
rance, wrought up into hellish Devotion by the Devil him-
self*; who envying ^to his Maker) the Homage and Ado-
ration of his Creatures, had deluded them into such gross,
surfeiting, sordid and bruitim Things, as one would think
should shock Nature it selfv
B u t what, signified all the Astonishment and Reflection
of Thoughts y thus it was, and I fcw it before iriy Eyes,
and there, was no room to wonder at it, or think it ira*p©£
iibtei aP niy Admiration turn'd to Rage, and I rid up to
the rm%e,; ofMo^ster^ calj ft what you will, and with my
Sword .cut, the Bonnet fhftt was on its Head in two in the
Middle, Ib that it^ung iiown by one of the Horns 5 and
oni of our Men,, that was, with me, took hold of the Sheep-
Skin that cover'? it, and pull'd at it, when behold a most
hedious Outcry and Howling run thro' the Village, and two
or three Hundred People came about my Ears, so that I
was glad to scour for it j for we few some had Bows and
Arrows j but I resolved from that Moment to visit them
again* Our
Our Caravan rested three Nights at the Town, which
was about four Miles off, in order to provide lome Horses
which they wanted, several of the Horses having beenlam'd
and jaded, with the Badness of the Way and our long March
over the last Defart $ Ib we had some Leisure here to put
my Design in Execution: I communicated my Project to
the Scots Merchant of Mufcow, of whose Courage I had
had sufficient Testimony, as above: I told him what I had
seen, and with what Indignation I had since thought that
human Nature could be so degenerate: I told him, I was
resolv'd, if I could get but four or five Men well arm'd to
go with me, to go and destroy that vile, abominable Idol;
to let them fee that it had no Power to help it sols, and
consequently could not be an Object of Worship, or to be
pray'd to, much kfs help them that ofser'd Sacrifices to
it.
H e laugh'd at me fays he, Your Zeal may be good,
but what do you propote to your self by it? Propose!
(aid I> to vindicate the Honour of God, which is insulted
by this Devil Worship: But how will it vindicate the
Honour of God, said he? While the People will not be
able to know what you mean by it, unleis you could speak
to them too, and tell them so, and then they will fight
you too, 1 11 assure you, for they are desperate Fellows, and
that especially in Defence of their Idolatry: Can we not,
said J, do it in the Night, and then leave them the Rea-
sons and Causes in Writing in their own Language? Writing!
said he j why there is nor in five Nations of them one Man
that knows any thing of a Letter, or how to read a Word
in any Language, or in their own: Wretched Ignorance!
said I to him j however, I have a great Mind to do it i
perhaps Nature may draw Inferences from it to theni, to
let them fee how brutish they are, to worship soch hor-
rid Things: Look yott, Sir, fcudht% if your Zeal prompts you
to it jo warmly, you must do it; but in the next rkee I
would have you consider, theso wild Nations of People are
subjected by Force to the Czar of Muscozy's Dominions, and
if you do this, 'tis ten to one but they will come byThou-
lands to the Governour of' NertzJnskay, and complain, and
demand Satisfaction y and if he cannot give them Satisfac-
tion, *tis ten to one but they revolt, and it will occasion a
new War with all the Tarters-in the Country.
This, I confess, put new Thoughts into my Head for
a while j but I harp'd upon the fame String still, and all
that
WO
that Day I was uneasy to put my Project in Execution;
towards the Evening the Scots Merchant met me by Ac-
cident in our Walk about the Town, and desir'd to fpeakr
with me j I believe, said he, I Have put you off of your:
good Design ; I have been a little concerns about it since,*
for I abhor the Idol and Idolatry as much as you can do -
Truly fays I, you nave put it ot? a little as, to the Execu-
tion of it, but you have not put if at all out of my Thoughts
and I believe I shall do it still before I quit this Place; tho*
I were to be delivered up to them for, Satisfaction: No,
no, fays he, God forbid they should deliver you up to such
a Crew of Monsters j they shall not do that neither, that
would be murtheting you indeed: VTby,fays I, how would
they use me? Use you ! fays he I'll tell you how they
iervM a poor Ruffian, who anronted them in their Wor-
ship just as you did, and who they took Prisoner * after
they had lam'd him with an Arrow that he could not run
away, they took him and strip'd him stavk naked, and set
him upon the Top of the Idol-Monster, and stood all round
him, and shot as many Arrows into him as, would stick
over his whole body, and then they burnt him and all the
Arrows sticking in him as a Sacrifice to the Idol: And was
this the fame Idol, said P. Yes, Jays he, fhevery iame: Well,
fays I, 111 tell you a Story, so I related the Story of our
Men at Madagascar, and how they burnt and iack'd the
Village there, and kill'cl Man, Woman and Child, for their
murthering one of our Men, just as it is related before j and
when I had done, I added, that I tnought we ought to do
so to this Village.
He listens very attentively to the Story but when I
talk'd of doing so to that Village; fays he, You ,mistake ve-
ry much, it was not this Village, it was almost a hundred
Miles from this Place, but it was the fame Idol, for they
carry him about in Procession all over the Country: Well,
fays I, then that Idol ought to be punish\J for it, and it shall*
fays h if I live this NigKt out.
I n a Word, finding me resolute, he lik'd the Design, and
told me I should not go alone, but he would go with me,
but he would go first, and bring a stout Fellow, one
of his Countrymen, to go also with us j and one, fays he,
as famous for his Zeal as you can desire any one to be,
against filch devilish Things as these; In a Word, hebroughe
me his Comrade, a Sots-man, who he call'd Captain Ri-
chardson, and I gave him a foil Account of what I had
seen; and also of what I intended j and he told me readily*
he would go with me if it cost him his Life; so we agreed
to go only us three: I had indeed propos'd it to my Part-
ner, but he declin'd it/ he said, he was ready to assist me
to the utmost, and upon all Occasions for my [Defences
but that this was an Adventure quite out of his Way > so,
I fay, we resolv'd upon our Work, only us three, and my
Man-Servant, and to put it in Execution that Night about
Midnight, with all the Secrecy imaginable.
However, upon second Thoughts, we were willing
to delay it ti]l the next Night because the Caravan being to
set forward in the Morning, we suppos'd the Gover-
nour could not pretend to give them any Satisfaction
upon us when we were out of his Power: The Scets
Merchant, as steady in his Resolution to enfrerprize it, as
bold in executing, brought me a Tartar's Robe or Gown
of Sheep-Skins, and a Bonnet, with a Bow and Arrows;
and had provided the fame for himself and his Country-
man, that the People, if they saw us, mould not be able to
determine who we were.
A l l the first Night we spent in mixing up seme com-
bustible Matter with Aqua-vitse, Gun-powder, and such o-
ther Materials as we could get, and having a good Quan-
tity of Tar in a little Pot, about an Hour after Night we
set out upon our Expedition.
W e came to the Place about eleven a-Clock at Night,
and found that the People had not the least Jealousy erf
Dangerattending their Idol,- the Night was cloudy, yet the
Moon gave us Light enough to see that the Idol stood just in
the seme Posture and Place that it did before: The People
seemed to be all at their Rest, only, tliat in the great Hut,
or Tent, as we call'd it, where we saw the three Priests,
who we mistook for Butchers, we saw a Light, and go-
ing up close to the Door, we heard People talking, as if
there were five or six of them y we. concluded therefore,
that if we set Wild-fire to the Idol, these Men would come
out immediately, and run up to the Place to rescue it rrom
the Destruction that we intended for it, and what to do
with them we knew not > once we thought of carry-
ing it away and setting Fire to it at a Distance j but
when we came to handle it, we found it too bulky so*
our Carriage, so we were at a Loss again: The second
Scots-man was for setting Fire to the Tent or Hut, and
knocking the Creatures that were there on the Head when
they came out; but I could not join with that \ I was
against killing them, if it was possible to be avoided: Well
then, laid the Scots Merchant, 111 tell you what we will
do, we will try to take them Prisoners, tie their Hands
and make them stand, -and see their Idol destroys.
A s it happen'd, we had Twine or Packthread enough
about us, which Was used to tie our Fire-Works together
with; fo we resolved to attaque these People first, and with
as little Noise as we could: The first Thing we did, we
knock'd at the Door, when one of the Priests coming to
the Door, we immediately seized upon him, stop'd his
Mouth, and ty'd his Hands behind him, and led him to
the Idol, where we gag'd him, that he might not make a
Noise i ty'd his Feet also together* and left him on the
Ground.
Two of us then waited at the Door, expecting that
another would come out to see what the matter was j but
we waited so long till the third Man came back to us;
and then no body coming out, we knock'd again gently,
and immediately out came two more, and we serv'd them
just in the lame Manner, but was oblig'd to go all with,
them, and lay them down by the Idol some Distance from
one another; when going back, we found two more were
come out to the Door, and a third stood behind them with-
in the Door: We seized the two, and immediately ty'd
them, when the third stepping back, and crying out, my
'Scots Merchant went in after him, and taking out a Com-
position we had made, that would only smoak and stink,
he set Fire to it, and threw it in among them; by that
time the other Scotsman and my Man, taxing Charge of
the two Men already bound, and ty'd together also by the
Arm, led them away to the Idol, and left them there, to
see if their Idol would relieve them, making haste back to
us.
When the Fuze we had thrown in had fill'd the Hut
with so much Smoak, that they were almost suffocated,
we then threw in a small Leather Bag of another kind,
which flam'd like a Candle, and following it in, we found
there was but four People left, who, it leems, were two
Men and two Women, and, as weluppos'd, had been about
some of their Diabolick Sacrifices: They aopear'd, in short,
frighted to Death, at least so as to fit trembling and stupid,
and not able to speak neither, for the Smoak.
I n a Word, we took them, bound them as we had the
other*
other, and all without any Noise: I should have said, we
brought them out of the House or Hut first j for indeed
we were not able to bear the Smoak any more than they
were: When we had done this, we carr/d them alltoge*
ther to the Idol: When we came there, we fell to work
with him j and first we daub'd him all over, and his Robes
also, with Tar, and fiich other Stuff as we had, which was
Tallow mix'd with Brimstone j then we stop'd his Eyes*
and Ears, and Mouth full of Gun-powder, then we wrapped
\ip a great Piece of Wild-fire in his Bonnet, and then
sticking all the Combustibles we had brought with us upon
him, *ve look'd about to fee if we could find any thing
else to help to bum him -y when my Scotsman remembred,
that by the Tent or Hutt where the Men were, there lay a
Heap of dry Forage, whether Straw or Rushes I do not
remember i away he and the other Scotsman run, and
fetch'd their Arms full of that: When we had done this,
we took all our Prisoners, and brought them, haying mi-
ty'd their Feet, and ungagg'd their Mouths, and made them
stand up, and set them just before their monstrous Idol, and
then set Fire to the whole.
We stay'd by it a Quarter of an Hour, or thereabouts,
"•till the Powder in the Eyes, and Mouth, and Ears of the
Idol blew up, and as we could perceive had split and do
formed the Shape of it j and in a Word, 'till we law it burn
into a meer Block or Log or Wood, and then setting the
dry Forage to it, we found it would be soon quite con-
iu m'd, so we began to think of going away > but the Scotsman
iaidno, we niust not go, for these poor deluded Wretches wiii
all throw themselves into the Fire, and burn themselves with
the Idol,* so we resolved to stay till the Forage was burnt
down too, an^v|hen we came away and left them.
In the ftMEiipg we. appears among our Fellow Tra-
vellers, exceeding oufy, in getting ready-for our Journey?
nor could any Man suggest that we had been any where
but in our Beds, as Travellers might be ihppos'd to be, to
•fit themselves for the Fatigues of that Day's Journey.
B u t it did not end ib 5 for the next Day came a great
^Multitude of the Country People, not only of this Village,
T>ut of a hundred;>more, for ought I know, to the Town-
"Gates, and in a most outrageous Manner, demanded Satis-
faction of the RuJJkn Governour, for the insulting their
Priests, and burning their Great Ch&m-Chi-Thxtmguy such a
hard Name they gave the monstrous Creature they vvor-
L 'fhip'd;
 
fhip'd; the People of Nertf/mkay, were at fy:st in a great
Consternation, for, they said, the Tartars were no less than
thirty thousand, and that in a few Days more, they would
be one hundred thousand strong.
- T h e RujpanGovernour sent out Messengers to. appease
them rand gave them all the good Words imaginable: He
assured them, he knew nothing of it, and that there had
not a Soul of his Garrisen been abroad: That it could not
be from any body there, and if they Would let him know
who it was, they should be examplarily punished: They
return'd haughtily, that all the Country reverenced the
Great Cham-Chi-Thaungu> who dwelt in the Sun, and no
Mortal would have decreed to offer Violence to his Image,
but some Christian Miscreant, so they call'd them, it seems,*
and they therefore denoune'd War against him, and all the
Rujjvws, who, they said, were Miscreants and Christians.
The Govcrnour still patient, and unwilling to make a
Breach, or to have any Cause of War alledged to be given
by him 5 The Czar having straitly charged them to treat
the conquer'd Country with Gentleness and Civility, gave
them still all the good Words he could ,• at last he told
them, there was a Caravan gone towards RnJ/ra that Morn-
ing, and perhaps it was some of them, who had done them
this Injury j and that if they would be satisfy'd with that,
he would fend after them, to enquire into it: This seetrsd
to appease them a little, and accordingly the Governour
sent after us, and gave us a particular Account how the
Thing was j intimating wirhaj, that if any in our Caravan
had cjpne it, they should make their Escape) but that, whe-
ther^hey had done it or no, we mould make all the Haste
forward that was possible and that, in the mean Time,
he would keep them in Play as long as he could.
This was very friendly in the Governour; however,
when it came to the Caravan, there was no body knew
any Thing of the Matter, and, as for us that were guilty,
we were the least of all suspected; none se much as ask d
us the Question; however, the Captain of the Caravan for
the Time, took the Hint that the Governour gave us, and
we marched or travelled two Pays and two Nights, with-
out any considerable Stop, and then we lay at a Village
r call'd Vlotbus \- nor did we make^ny long Stop here, but
hasten'd on towards faraivenay another of the Czar of Mtjf-
covy's Colonies, and where we expected we should be safe;
but it is to be observed, that here we began for two or
three
three Days March," to enter upon a vast nameless T)e6rr, of
which I shall say more in its Place; and which, if we had
now been upon it, 'tis more than probable, we had been al
destroys : It was the second Days March from Tlotfats^
that by the Clouds of Dust behind us at a great Distance,
•feme of our People began to be sensible we were pursued *
we had enter'd the Desart, and had pass'd by a great Lake,
cali'd Schaks Ofer, when we perceived a very great Body ot
Horse appear on the other Side of the Lake to the North,
we travelling West: We obser'd they went away West as
we did, but^ had supposed we would have taken that Side
of the Lake, whereas, we very happily took the South-
Side j and in two Days more we law them not, for they
believing., we were still before them, puflYd on, till they
came to the River Udda $ this is a very great River when
it panes farther North, but where we came to it* we found
it narrow, and fordable.
The third Day they either found their Mistake, or had
Intelligence of us, and came pouring in upon us, towards
the Dusk of the Evening: We had, to our great Satisfac-
tion, just pitch'd upon a Place for our Camp, which was
very convenient for the Night; for as we were upon a
Deiart, tho' but at the Beginning of it, that was above
five hundred Miles over, we had no Towns to lodge at*
and indeed -expected none but the City farawena, which
we had yet two Days March to; the Desart, however,
had some few Woods m it on this Side, and little Rivers*
which ran all into the great River Udda: It was in a nar-
row Strait between two little, but very thick, Woods, that,
we pitch'd our little Camp for that Night, expecting to be
attack'd in the Night.
N o body "knew but our selves, what we were pursued
for; but as it was usoal for the Mongul Tartars to go about
in Troops in that Desart, so the Caravans always fortify
themselves every Night against them, as against Armies of
Robbers; and it was Therefore rio new Thing to be pursued.
But we had this Night, of all the Nights or our Tni>
vels, a most advantageous Camp j for we lay between two
Woods, with a little Rivulet running just before our Front;
so that we could not be surrounded, or attack'd any way*
but in our Front or Rear; we took care also to make our
Front as strong as we could, by placing our Packs, with
our Camels and Horses, all in a Line on the Inilde of the
River, and we felTd some Trees in our Rear*
L2 U
In.this Posture we encamp'd for the Night, but the
Enemy was upon us before we had finiih'd our Situations
They did not come on us like Thieves as we expected,
but sent three Messengers to us, to demand the Men to be
delivered to them, that had abus'd their 'Priests, and burnt
their God Cham - Chi-Jhatmga that they might burn
them with Fire; and upon this, they laid, they would
so away, and dousjio further Harm, otherwise they would
urn us all with Fire: Qur. Men-Jook'd very blank-at this
Meslage,. and began to stare at one another, to see who
look'd with most Guilt in their Faces j but no. Bofy was
the Word, no body did it: The Leader of the Caravan
sent Word, , he was well assur'd, it was nat^done by .any of
our Camp * that we were peaceable Merehants, travelling
on our Buiineisj that we Jiad done no harm to them, or
to any one else; and that therefore they must look farther
-for tjieir Enemies, who had injur'd them. for we were
not the People j £o deilr'd them not to disturb us, for if
they did, we should defend our selves.
They were far from being satisfy'd with this for an
Answer, and a great Crowd of them came down in the
Morning by Break of Day to our Camp j but seeing us in
iuch an advantageous Situation, they durst come no far-
ther than the Brook in our Front, where they stood aiid
-fhew'd us such a Number, that indeed terrifyM us very
much, for those that spoke least of them, spoke of ten
thousand: Herefhey stood and look'd at us a while, and
then setting up a great Howl, they let sty a Cloud of Ar-
rows .among us; T>ut we were well enough fortify'd for
that y for we shelter *d under our Baggage, and I do not re*
member that- one Man of us was hurt,
Some Time..after this, we see them move a little to
our Right, and expected them on the Rear, when a cun-
ning FcDoWja Cajfock, as they call them, of Jarawena, in
the Pay of the Muscovites, -calling to the Leader of the Ca-
ravan, said to him, 1 11 go send all these People away to 57-
Splka; this was a City, four or five Days Journey, at least,
to. the-'South, and rather behind us: So he takes his Bow
and Arrows^acd getting on Horse-bask, he rides away from
our Rear directly, as it.were, back to Nertsinskay j af-
ter this, he takes a great Circuit about, and comes to the
Army of the Tartars, as if he had been sent Express to tell
them a long Story; that the People, who had burnt the
'Ckm-Gk't-TkftmgH) were gone to Sibidka, with a Caravan
of Miscreants, as he called them, that is to &y> Christians
and that they werere&lv'd to burn the God Schal-Isar, be
longing to the Tongueses.
A s this Fellow was himself a meer Tartar, and perfectly
ipoke their Language, he counterfeited so well, that they
all took it from him, and away they drove, in arrfost vio-
lent Hurry, to- Stbeilka> whicn, it seemv was five Day£
Journey to the South, and in less than three Hours, they
were entirely out of our Sight, and we never'heard any
more of them j nor ever knew whether they went to that-
other Place cali'd Sibeilka, or no.
S o we pass'd safely on to the~City of Jaranen^ where
there was a Garrison of Muscouttesy and there we rested five
Days, the Caravan being exceedingly fatigued with the last
Days hard March, and with want or Rest in the Night.
From this City we had a frightful Deiarr, whicrrheH
us three and twenty Days March: We furninVd our selves
with some Tents here, for the better accommodating our
selves in the Night j and the Leader of the Caravan, pro*
cured sixteen Carriages or Waggons of -the Country, for
carrying our Water and Provisions, and these Caniageswa*
our Defence every Night round our little Camp 5 so that
had the Tartars appeared, unless they had been very nume-
rous indeed, they would not have been able to hurt us.
We may well be fuppos'd to want Rest again after this
long Journey , for in this Deiart we saw neither House or
Tree, or scarce a Buih j we (aw indeed abundance of the
Sable-Hunters, as they cali'd them, these are all Tartars of the
Mongol Tartary, of which this Country is a Part, and they
frequently attack small Caravans, but we iaw no Num-
bers of them together: I was curious to see the Sable*
Skins the^ catch% but could never ipeak with any of?
them, for they durst not come near us, neither durst we
straggle from our Company, to go near them.
After we had passd this Desert, we came into or
Country pretty well inhabited 5 that is to &y,. we foun(fc
Towns and Castles, settled by- the Czar of Muscovy; with
Garrisons of Stationary ^ Soldiers to protect the Caravans,
and defend the Country against the Tartars, who would
otherwise make it very dangerous travelling,* and hisC£*~-
ri/h Majesty has given &ch strict Orders for the well guard-
ing the Caravans and Merchants, that if there are any Tar-
tars heard of in the Country, Detachments of the Garrisons
axe always sent to fee Travellers &fe from Station to Station.
L 3 And
A'N n thus the. Governour of M'mskoy9 who I had Op-
portunity to make a Visit to, by Meansof the Scots Merchant
who was acquainted with him,ofTer'd us a Guardof fifty Men,
# we thought there was any Danger to the next Station.
I thou ght long before this, that as we came nearer
to Europe, we stiould find tbe Country better peopled, and
the People more civilized, but I found myself mistaken in
both, for we had yet the Nation of the Tonguefes to .pass
through; where we saw the same Tokens of Paganism,
and Barbarity, or worse,, than before j only as they were
conquered by the Muscovites, and entirely redue'd, they
were not io dangerous j but for Rudeness of Man-
sers, Idolatry, and Muitklieism, no People in the World
sver went beyond themThey are cloathed all in Skins of
Beasts, and their Houses are built of the fame; You know
not a Man. from a Woman> neither by the Ruggedncss of
their Countenances or their Cioaths; and in the Winter,
when die Ground is covered with Snow, they live under
Ground in Houses like Vaults, which have Cavities or Caves
going from one to another.
*F tlje Tartan had their ChAm-Cki'Thamgu for a whole
V ihage or Country, the/e had Idols in every Hut and every
Cave 5 beiides they Worship the Stars, the Sun, the Water, the
Snow, and, in a Word,every thing that they do not understand,
and they understand but very little* spthat almost every Ele-
every uncommon Thing, lets them a iacrificiag.
But I am no more to -describe People than Countries,
any farther than my own Story comes to be concerned in,
H) them: J met with nothing, peculiar to my self in all t his
Country, which I reckon was, from the Desart, which I spoke
of last, at least 4pQ.M3lesJialf of it being another Dejart, which
took us up twelve Pays severe traveling, without House, or
Tree, or Bum, but were obJig'd again to carry our own
Provisions, as well Water as Bread: After we were out of
this Beiaj t, and had naveird two Bays, we came to Jam-
azy, a Muscovite City or; Station, on the great River jW-
z>#y.; This River they told us parted 'Europe &om^ tho'
•pur Map-makers, as I am told, do not agree to it; how-
ever % is certainly the Eastern Boundary of the ancient $j*
berta^ which, now makes up a Province only of the vast
Muscovite Empire, bus is itself equalin Bigness to the whole
Empire of Germaim
JVnd yet here J observM Ignorance and Paganism Ml
3*ev41ed, except i& the MvsfWt^Gmifons} all the Coun-
ts
fry between the River Qby, and the River J-amzay is as
entirely Pagan, and the People as barbarous, as the remotest
of the Tartars, nay. as any Nation for ought I know m
Asia or America: I also found, which I observd to the
Muscovite Governours who I had Opportunity to converse
with, that the poor Pagans are not much the wiser or the
nearer Christianity for being under the Muscovite Govern-
ment; which they acknowledged was true enough, but,
they said, it was none of their Business: That if the Cz,ar
expected to convert his Siberian, or Tonguese, or Tartar
Subjects, it should be done by sending Clergymen among
them, not Soldiers j and"they added, with more Sincer ity than
I expected, that they found it was not so much the Con-
cern of their Monarch to make the People Christians, as it
Was to make them Subjects.
From this River to the great River Oby, we cross'd a
Wild uncultivated Country -r I cannot sey 'tis a barbarous
Soil '9 *tis only barren of People, and' good Management,
otherwise it is in itself a most pleasant, fruitful and agree-
able Country i What Inhabitants we found in it are all Pa-
gans, except such as are sent among them from Rujpa 5
for this is the Country I mean on both sides the River Q6y,
whither the' Muscovite Criminals, that are not put to Death,
are baniih'd, and from whence it is next to impossible the/
should ever come away.
Tha ve nothing Material to fay of my particular Af-
fairs, till I ctme to To&olski, the Capital City of Si&eria,
where I continued some time on the following Occasion.
W e had been now almost seven Months on our Journey,
and Winter began to come on apace, whereupon my Part-
ner and I calm a Council about our particular Affairs, in
Which we found it proper, considering that we were bound
for England, and not for Mufcow, to consider how to dis-
pose of our selves: They told us of Sledges and Rain-Deer
to carry us over the Snow in the Winter time; and in*
deed they have such Things, that it would be incredible to
relate the Particulars of, by which Means the Ruffians tra-
vel more in the Winter than they can in Summer, because
in these Sleds they are able to run Night and Bay* the Snow
being frozen, is oneuniver&l Covering ti? Nature, by which
the Hills, the Vales-, the. Rivers, the Lakesr-sH are smooth,
and hard as a Stone, and they run upon the Surface, with-
out any Regard to what is underneath.
B u t I had no occasion to push at a Winter Journey of
L 4 this
 
this kind, I was bound to England, not to Muscoto, and
my Rout lay two Ways j either I must go on as the Ca-
ravan went till I came to Jerofiaw, and then go off West
for Narva and the Gulph of Finland ', and so either by Sea
or Land to Dantxick, where I might possibly fell my China
Cargo to gcod Advantage, or I must leave the Caravan at
a little Town on the Dwma, from whence I had but six Days
by Water to Arch-Angel, and from thence might be sure
of Shipping, either to 'England, Holland, or Ha?nburgh.
Now to go any of these Journeys in the Winter, would
Jiave been preposterous : for as to DantzJek, thcBaltick would
be frozen up, and I could not get Pailage, and to go by
Land in those Countries, was far less safe than among the
Mongul Tartars; likewise to go to Arch-Angel in October,
all the Ships would be gone from thence, and even the
Merchants whp dwell there in Summer, retire South to
MnfcoTV in the Winter when the Ships are gone* so that I
'should have nothing but Extremity of CoS to encounter,
with a Scarcity of Provisions, and must lie there in an
empty Town all the Winter: So that upon the whole I
thought it much my Better way to let the Caravan go,
and to make Provision ta Winter where I was, (*vi&«} at
Tobclski in Siberia, in the Latitude of Sixty Degrees, where
I was sure of three Things to wear out a cold- Winter
"with, (viz.) Plenty of Provision, luch as the Country af-
forded j a. warm House, with Fuel enough, and excellent Com-
pany j of all: whicji I shall give a full Account of in its Place.
J w a? now in a quite different Climate from my be-
lev'd Island, where I never si^t Cold, except when I had
my Ague s on the contrary*. I had much to do to bear
any Qcaths on my Back, and never made any Fire but
without Doors, and for my Necessity?, in dressing my Food,
(fye. Now I made me three good Vests, with large Robes or
. Gowns over them to hang down to the Feet, and: button
elole to the Wrists, and aS these Jin'd with. Furs to maka
them sufficiently warm.
As to a warm House, I must confess I greatly dislike
our way in England; of making Fires- in every Room in
the House, in open Chimneys, which when the Fire was
out, always kept the Air in the Room cold as the Climate:
But taking an Apartment in a good House in the Town,
I order'd a Chimney to be built Tike a Furnace, in the Cen-
ter of six several Rooms; like a Stove, the Funnel to carry
the Smoak went up one Way, the Door to come at the Fire
went
went in another, and all the Rooms were kept equally: warm,
but no Fire seen; like as they heat the Bagnio's in England*
By this Means we haSalways the fameClimate in all the
Rooms, and an equal Heat was preserve > and how cold so-
ever it was without, it was always warm within, and yet we
saw no Fire, nor was ever incommoded with any Smoak.
The most wonderful Thing of all was, that it should
be possible to meet with good Company here, in a Coun-
try so barbarous as that ot the most Northerly Parts of
rope, near the frozen Ocean, and within but a very few
Degrees of Nova Zembla.
But this being the Country where the State Criminals
of Musc<yvyy as I observ'd before, are all banish'd, this City
was full of Noblemen, Princes, Gentlemen, Colonels, and
in short all Degrees of the Nobility, Gentry, Soldiery ami
Courtiers of Muscovy.: Here was the famous Prince Galilf-
ken, or Galojsken and his Son the old; General Ro&osiiski, and
several other Persons of Note, and some Ladies,
By means of my Scots Merchant, who nevertheless I
parted with here, I made an Acquaintance here with seve-
ral of these Gentlemeu, and some of them of the first Rank,and
from these, in the long Winter Nights in which I'staid here,
I receiv'd several agreeable VisitsIt was talking one Night
with a certain Prince, one of thebanihYd Ministers of State
belonging to the Czar of Muscovy, that my Talk of my par-
ticular Case began: He had been telling me abundance 6f firie
Things of the Greatness, the Magnificence, the Dominions,
and the absolute Power of the Emperor of fe Rtissdns :. Tin-
terruptedhim, andtoldhirolwasagreater and more power-
ful Prince than ever the Cæar of Muscovy was, tho* my Do-
minions were not so large, or m y People so many: TheRttf-
fian Grandee hok'd a little furpriz, d, and fixing his Eyes sted-
dily upon me, began to wonder what I meant.
I told him, his Wonder would cease when I had explains
my self: First, I told himy I had the absolute Disposal of the
Lives and Fortunes of all my Subjects: That nomirhfrandfog
my absolute Power,. I had not one Person disaffected to my
Government* or to my Person, in all my Dominions: He
shook his Head at that, and" said, there indeed I outdid the
Czar of Muscovy: J fold him, That aH the Lands in my
Kingdom were my own, and all my Subjects were not
only my Tenants, but Tenants at wilt That they would all
fight for me to the last Drop 5 artd that never Tyrant,J$r such
I acknowledged my seJsto6e,vns ever so. universally beloves
and yet so Horribly Feared by his Subjects. Ae-
At*tei* amusing them with these Riddtes in Government*
$>r a while, I open'd the Case, and told them the Story at
J^rge of my living in the Inland* , and how I managed both
myself and the People there thaj were under me, just as I
Ijaye since minuted it down: They were exceedingly ta-
ien with-; the Story, and especially the Prince, who told
ine with-a Sigh, that the true Greatness-of Life was to be
Master of ourselves;, That he would not have exchanged
ftdx 3 State of Life as mine, to have been C^ar of Musco-.
iy; and that he found more Felkity in the Retirement he
feeni'd to be banifh'd; to therei than ever he -found in the
highest Authority he enjoy'd in the Court of his Master the
C&ar.: That the Heighm of human Wiseiom was to bring
Our Tempers, down to our Circumstances* and to make a.
CJalm within, under the Weight of the greatest Storm, with-,

and Power that they (the BanistVd) had left behind them.
Nor, Sir, says be, do I bring my Mind to this political-
ly, by the Neceslity of my Circumstances, which som-
call miserable; but if I know any thing of my self, I would
not go back, no not tho' my Master, theCzar, should coil me,

B u t, my Lord, said £> perhaps you not only are banishU'
from the Pleasures of the Court, and from the Power, and
Authority, and Wealth you enjoy'd before; but you may
£e absent too from some of the Conveniences of Life, your

Ay, fays he, that is 35 you suppose me to be a Lord, or
a Prince, &c. So indeed ?am,* but you are now to consi-
der me only as a Man,* a human Creature, not at aH di-
fiinguifh'd from another j and so 1 can suffer no Wanti
unless I should« be visited with Sickness and Distempers:
However, to put- the Question out of Dispute ,• you see
our Manner; we are in this Place five Persons of Rank",
we live perfectly retir'd, as suited to a State of Banishment?
we have something resou'd from the Shipwreck of our
Fortunes, which keeps us' from the meer Necessity of
hunting for our Food j but the poor Soldiers who are nere,*
without that Help, live in as much Plenty as-we : They go
into the Woods and catch Sables and Foxes $ the Labour
of a Month will maintain them a Year j and as the Way
of living is not expensive, so it is not hard to get sufficient
to ourselves; So that Objection is out of Doors.
J have not*-room to give a full Account of the most a-
grceable Cpnversation- s had ,wkh tftia-truly great Man *
tn aH which she fhew'd^ that his Mind was so inspir'd with
a superior Knowledge of Things,- so supported by- Religi-
on, as well as by a vait Shsre-of Wisdonfr j that Ms Con*
tempt of the World was really as much, as-he> had ex-
press^, and that tc was always the fame to the as wit
appear in the Story I am going to- tell.
I had been here 8 Months, and a-dark dreadful Winter
J thou^bt ittobe-5 the C6ld was so intense, that I could not
ib much as look abroad, without being wrapt in Furs, and
a Mask of Fur< before* my Face, or rather a Hoodi with on-
ly a Hole for Breath,-and two for Sight: The little Day-
lig] t we had, was, as we reckon'd, for three-Months, not
ate ve Hours a Day, and six^atmofo only that the Snovr
lying on the Ground continually, and .the Weather clear* it
was never quite daikj Our Horses were kept; (or rather
jSaiv'd;) under Ground* and as for our Serves, &r wehir'd j
. . ;.... • - Ssr*
Servants here to look after our Horses and selves, we had eve-
ry now and then their Fingers and Toes to thaw and take
care of, lest: they should mortify and fall off.
It is true, within'Doors we were warm, the Houses
feeing close, the Walk thkk, the Lights small, and theGkse
all double ; Our Food was chiefly the Flesh of Deer dry*d
and cur'd in the Season { good Bread enough, but bak'd as
Biskets,- diyd Fish of several forts, and some Flesh of Mut-
ton, and of the Buffeloes, which is pretty good Beef: All
the Stores of Provision for the Winter are laid up in the
Summer, and well cur'd our Drink was Water, mix'd
with Aqua-vitæ instead of Brandy, and- for a Treat, Mead
instead of Wine, which-, however, they have excellent good:
The Hunters, who venture abroad all Weathers, frequently
brought us in fresh Venison, very fat and goods and some-
times Bears Flesh,- but we did not much care for the lash
We had a good Stock of Tea, with which we treated our
Friends, as above5 and, in a Word, we kVd very chearfully
and well, all Things considered.
It was now March, and the Days grown considerably
longer, and the Weather, at least, tolerable 5 so other Tra-
vellers began to prepare Sleds to carry them over the Snow,
and to get Things ready to be going 5 but my Measures
being fbe'd, as I have mid, for Ar a?-Angel, and not for
Muscovy or the Baltitk, V made no Motion j knowing very
weU that the Ships from the South, do not set out for
that Part of the Work! t&May or June, and that if I was
there by the beginning of August, it would be as soon as
any Ships would-be ready to go awav; and therefore, I
fay, I made no haste to be gone, as ©triers did*j fnaWordx
I £w a great many People* hay, all the Travellers go a*
way before me: It seems*every Year they go from thence
to Mufitw for Trade, to carry Furs, and buy Ne-
cessaries with them, which they bring back to furnish their
Shops; also others, went of the{#me ^rtmdi^ ArcfAAiigd,,
but then they also being to come back again* abio^e 800
fMiles, went all out before me*.
In4 fliort, about the latter end of May I began to "make
sll ready to pack up j and a s I was doing this, it occurs
to me, that seeittg all. these' Pcopb were banish'I by the
Czaf of Mufctky to SiUriœ> andyet when they came there,
twere leftist«liberty.'to go- whitfeer the f would* why did
they not then go away to any Part of the World when-
ever they thought fit? and I began to examine what should,
leader tbeca-from, making such aa Attempt;- By£
B ut my Wonder was over,, when I enter'd upon that
Subject with the Person I have mention'd, who answers
me thus : Consider, first, Sir,, fays he, the Place where we
are; and, secondly, the Condition we are in j especially,
&id he, the Generality of the People who are banish'd hi-
ther: We are sorrounded,. Bid: he, with stronger Things
than Bais and Bolts j on the North-side, is- an unnavi-
gable Ocean,, where Ship never failed, and Boat never swam;
neither, if we had both, could we know where to go with-
them Every other way, said he, we have above a thou-
sand Miles to pass thro' the Czar's own Dominions, and
By-ways utterly unpayable, except by the Roads made by
the Government, and thro' the Towns garrison'd by
his Troops j ib that we could neither pass undiscover'd by
the Road* or subsist any other Way; ib that it is in vain
to attempt it.
I was silenc'd indeed at once, and found that they were
in a Prison, every Jot as secure as if they had been Iock'd
up in the Castle of Muscow however, it came into my
Thoughts, that I might certainly be made an Instrument
to procure the Escape of this excellent Person, and that-
whatever Hazard I run; I would: ceitainly try if I could
carry him off: Upon this I took an Occasion one Even-
ing to tell him my Thoughts: I represented to him, that
it was very easy for me to carry him away, there being no
Guard over him in the Country; and as I was not going
to Muscovy,but to Arch~,A#gek and that I v/ent in the na-
ture of a Caravan, by which I was not obliged to lie in.
,the stationary Towns in the Defart, but could • encamp eve-
ry Night where I wouldwe might easily pals uninterup-
ted to Afch-Angtly where I would immediately secure him
on board an English or Butch Ship, and carry hkji off fate-
along, with me j and as to his Subsistence and other Patr
.ticukr^, that ihould be my Care, till he could better supply
&msclf. . 'm \ #.
He heard me very attentively, and look-d earnestly on me
all the while Iipokei nay, I could see in his very Face, that
what I said put his. Spirits into an exceeding Ferment j his
Colour frequently changed, his Eyes look'd red* and his Heart
flutter'd, tnatit might be even perceived in his Countenance s
nor could he immediately afrswer me: When hbsA dpne,nnd
as it were expected what he would sey to it j and after he
had paus'da little, he embrae'd me, and said, how unhappy
,are we! unguided Creatures as wears, that even jour greateil
Acts
Æcts of Friendship are made Snares to us, and we are made^
Tempters of one another! My dear Friend, said he y your Of-
fer is so sincere, has such Kindness in it, is so disinterested-
if) itself, and is so calculated for my Advantage, that 1 must
have very little Knowledge of the World, if I did not both:
wonder at ir, and acknowledge the Obligation I have upon
me to you for it: But did you believe I was sincere in what
3; have so often said to you of my. Contempt of the World T
Did you believe I spoke my very Soul to^you, and that I:
had really obtain'd that Degree of Felicity here, that had plac'd-.
me above all that the World could give me, or do for me?
Did you believe,I was sincere, when I told you I'would
not go back, if I was rccall'd even to be all, that once I was,
in the Court and with the Favour of the Czar my Master?
Did you believe me,, my Friend* to be an honest Man, or did
you think me to be a boaMing Hypocrite? Here heu stopped,
as if he would bear what I would fay; but indeed, I soon,
after perceiv'd, that he stopp'd because his Spirits were in
Motion, his great Heart was full of Struggles, and he could
not go on: Iwas, I confess, astonifh'd at the Thing_as well:
as at the Man, and I us'd some Arguments with-him to urge
him to set. himself free: That he ought to-look upon this-,
as a Door openM by Heaven for his Deliverance, and a Sum-
mons by Providence, who has the Care and Disposition of
all Events, to do himself good, and to render himself use-
ful in the World.
He had by, this Time recovers himself: How do you
know Sir, says he warmly, that instead of a Summons from
Heaven, it may be a Feint of another Instrument? Repre-
senting in all the alluring Colours to-me the Shew of Feli-
city as a Deliverance, which may in itself be my Snare, and .
tend directly to my Ruim Here I am free from the Temp-
tation of returning to my former- miserable Greatness j there
I am not furcybut that alltheSeedsof Pride, Ambition, Ava-
rice and .Luxury, which I know remain in Nature, may re-
vive and take-Root, and in a Wordy again overwhelm me,
and then th&happy Prisoner, who you lee now Master of his
Soul's Liberty, mall be the miserable Slave of his own Senses,
in the Full of all personal Liberty: Dear Sir, let me remain in
this blessed Confinement, banisiYd from the Crimes of Life*
rather-than purchase a Shew of Freedom* at the Expence of
the Liberty of my Reason* and at the Expence of the future
Happiness which now I have in my View, but stall then^
f*M) quickly lose Sight of j for I am but Fleih, a.Man, ameer
Man, have Passions and Affections as likely to posiefs and
overthrow me as any Man: O be not my Friend, and myr
Tempter_both together!
If I was sirrpviz'd before, I was quite dumb now, and
stood silent, looking at him, and indeed admir'd at what I
few y the Struggle in his Soul was Ib great, that tho' the Wea-
ther was extreamly cold y it put him into a most violent
Sweat, and I found he wanted to give Vent to his Mind $ so
I said a Word or two, that I would leave him to consider
of it, and wait on him again, and then. I withdrew to my
own Apartment.
About two Hours after I heard some Body at, or near,
the Door of my Room, and I wa« going to open the Door,
but he had ©pen'd it, and came in: My dear Friend, says he,
you had almost overset me, but I am recover'd,- do not take
it ill that I do not close with your Offer, I assure you, 'tis
not for want of a Sense of the Kindness of it in you, and
I came to make the most sincere. Acknowledgment of it to
you j but I hope I Live got the Victory over myself.
My hoid, said J, I hope you are fully satisfy'd that you
do not resist the Call of Heaven: Sir, said he, if it had been
from Heaven, theiame Power would have influene'd me to
accept it} but I hope, and am fully satisfy'd, that it is from
Heavjen that I decline it, and I have an infinite Satisfaction
in the Parting, that you shall leave me an honest Man still,
tho' not a. free Man.
I had nothing to do but to acquiesce, and make Professions
to him of my having no End in it, but a sincere Desire to
serve him: Heembrac'd me very passionately, and assur'd me,
he was sensible of that, and siiould always acknowledge it,
and with that he oster'd me a very fine Present of Sables,
too much indeed for me to accept, from a Man in his Cir-
cumstances* and I would have avoided, them, but he would
not be refus'd.
The next Morning T sent my Servant to his Lordship,
with a small Present of Tea, two- Pieces of China DamasK,
and four little Wedges of Japa&Go\d> whkh did not all weigh
above six Ounces, or thereabout, but were far short of the Va-
lue, of Ms Sables, which, indeed, when I came to'England, I
found worth near 2 00 /. He accepted the Tea, and oncPiece
of the Damask, and one of the Pieces of Gold, which had' a
sine Stamp upon it, ofthej^f^ Coinage, which I found he
took for the Rariety of it, but would not take any more; and
feat Word by my Servant that he desired to speak with me.
Whem
When I came to him, he told me, I knew what? ha<i
pass'd between us, and hop'd I would not move him any
more in that Affair 5 but that since I made such a generous
Offer to him, he ask'd me, if I had Kindness enough toof-
fer the fame to another Person that he would name to Hie,
in whom he had a great Share of Concern 5 I told him, that T
could not fay I iuclin'd to do fb much for any one but
himself, for whom I had a particular Value, and should have
been glad to have been the Instrument of his Deliverance *
however, if"he would please to name the Person to me, I
would give him my Answer, and hop'd he would not be
displeased with me, if he was w ith my Answer: Hetoldme,
it was only his Son, who, tho* I had not seen, yet was in
the fame Condition with himself, and above two hundred
Miles from him, on the other Side the Qty > but that if I
consented, he would fend for him*
I made no Hesitation, but told him I would do it: I
made ibme Ceremony in letting him understand that it was
wholly on his Account, and that feeing T could not prevail
on him, I would shew my Respect: to him, by my Con.^
cern for his Son, but these Things are to tedicus to repeat
liere: He sent away the next Day for his Son, and in about
Twenty Days he came back with the Messenger, bringing
fix or seven Horses, loaded with very rich Furs, aadwMca
in the whole, amounted to a very great Value.
His Servants brought the Horses into the Town, but left
the young Lord at a Distance, till Night, when he earner
incognito into our Apartment, and his father presented him:
to me? and in short, we concerted there the Manner of our
Travelling, and every Thing proper for the Journey.
I had bought a considerable Quantity-of Sables, black Fox
Skins,, fine Ermines, and such other Furs as are very rich}
I* fay, I had bought them in that City in Exchange for
some of the Goods brought from China; in particular for
the Cloves and Nutmegs, of which, I fold the greatest Part
here , and the rest afterwards at Arch*Angel y for a much
better Price than I could have done at London, and my
Partner who was sensible of the Profit, and whose Business
more particularly than mine was Merchandise, was mightily
pleas'd with our Stay, on Account of tJieTraffick we made
here.
I t was the Beginning of sum* when I left this remote
Place, a City, I believe, little heard of in the World; and
indeed it is so far out of the Road of Commerce, that I
know
 
Know not how it should be much talk'd of: We were
now come to a very small Caravan, being only thirty two
Horlesr and Camels in all, and all of them pafs'd for mine,
tho* my new Guest was Proprietor of eleven of themit
was most natural also that I should take more Servants-
with me than I had^ before, and the young Lord pafs'd for
my Steward j what great Man I pafs'd for my self, I know
not, neither did it concern me to enquirey we had here,
the worst and the largest Defart to pass over that we met
with in all the Journey,- indeed I call it the worst; because
the Way was very deep in some Places, and very uneven
in others j the best we had to fay for it, * was, that we
thought we had no Troops of Tartars and Robbers to fear,
and that they never came on this Side the River Oby, or
at least, but very seldom j but we found it otherwise.
My youBg Lord had with him, a faithful Muscovite Ser-
vant, or rather a, Siberian Servant , who was perfectly ac-
quainted with the Countryand who, led us by private
Roads, that we avoided' coming into the principal Towns
and Cities, upon the great Road, such as Tumen, Soloy-
Kamaskoy, and several others; because the Muscovite Garri-
sons which are kept there, are very curious and strict in
their Observation upon Travellers; and searching lest any
of the banifh'd Persons of Note should make their Escape
that Way into Muscovy $ but by this Means as we were
kept out of the Cities, so our whole Journey was a De-
sert, and we were oblig'd to encamp and He in our Tents,
when we might have had very good Accommodation in
the Cities on the Way: This the young Lord was so sen-
sible of, that he would not allow us to lie abroad, when
we came to several Cities, on the Way, but lay abroad him-
Jets with his Servant in the Woods, and met us always at
the appointed Places.
* Wi TSi were / ehter'd Europe, having pafs'd the River
Kama, which* in these Parts, .is the Boundary between
rope and jtfia, and the first City on the European Side was
call'd Soloy-Kamaskoy, which- is as much as to fay, the great-
City, on the River Kama j and here we thought to nave*
seen some evident Alteration in the People, their Manner,
their Habit, their Religion, and their Business; but we were
mistaken, for as we had a vast Defart to pass, which, by
llelatiou, is near seven hundred Miles long in some Places^
but not above two hundred Miles over where we pafs'd it;
so till we came past, that horrible Place, we found very lit-
tie Difference between that Cotmtry and the MonpdTartarfi
the People, mostly Pagans, and little better than the Savages
of America; their Houses and Towns full of Idols, and
their Way of Living wholly barbarous, except in the Cities
as above, and the Villages near them j where they are Chri-
stians as they call them selves, of the Greek Church; but c-
vea these have their Religion mingled with ib many Rc-
Hques o£ Superstition, that it is fctree to be known in some
Places from meer Sorcery and Witchcraft.
I n pasting this Forrest, I thought indeed we must, after
all our Dangers were in our Imagination eseap'd,. as before,
have been plunders and rob'd, and perhaps murther'd by a
Troop of Thieves j of what Country they were, whether
the roving Bands of theOstiachi, a kind of Tartars, or wild
People on the Bank of the Oby, had rang'd thus far, or
whether they were the Sable-Hunters of Siberia, I am yet
at a Loss to know j but they were all on Horse-back, car-
ry'd Bows and Arrows, and were at fist: about five and
forty in Number; they came fb near to us, as within about
two Musouet-Shot, and askingno Questions, they surround-
ed us with their Horse, andlook'd very earnestly upon us
twice j at length they plac'd themselves just in our Way,
upon which, we drew up in a little Line before our Camels,
being not above sixteen Men in all j and being drawn up
thus, we. halted and-sent out the Siberian Servant, who. at-
tended his Lord, to see who they were j his Master war
the more willing to let him go, because he was not aJittk
apprehensive, that they were a Siberian Troop sent out af-
ter him: The Man came up near them with a Flag of
Truce, and call'd to them , but tho' he {poke several of
their Languages or Dialects of Languages rather, he could
not understand a Word they said j however, after som*
Signs to him, not to come nearer to them at his Peril j ib
he &id> he understood them to. mean, offering to shoot at
him if he advane'd j the Fellow camehack no wiserthaahe
went, only that by their Dress, he said, he belie v'd them to be
feme Tartars of Ka(muck,ov of the Circajsfian Hoords; and that
there must be more of them-on the great Desart, tho' he neve?
heard that any of them ever were seen se far North before.
This was small Comfort to us > however* we had no
Remedy; there was on our left Hand, at about a Quarter
of a Mile's Distance, a little Grove or Clump of Tree* which
stood close together, and vay near the Road > I immedi-
ately rcsolv'd we would advance to those Trees, and fortify
c?ur-
our selves as well as we could there; for first I considers
that the Trees would in great Measure cover us from their
Arrows, and in the next-Place, they could not come to
charge us in a Body; it was indeed my old Portuguese Pi-
lot who proposed it j and who had this Excellency attend--
ihg him, namely, that he was always readiest and most apt
to direct and encourage us, in Cafes of the most Danger »
we advane'd immediately with what Speed we could, and
gain'd that little Wood, the Tartars or Thieves, for we
knew not what to caH them, keeping their Stand, and not
attempting to hinder us; When we came thither, we found
to our great Satisfaction, that it was a swampy springy
Piece of Ground, and on the one Side, a very great Spring
of Water, which running out in a little Rill or Brook, was
a little farther, jjoin'd by another of the like Bigness, and
was in ihort, the Head or Source of a considerable River,
calTd afterwards the Wirtska; the Trees which grew about
this Spring, were not in all above two hundred, bat were
very large, and stood pretty thick > so that as "soon we got
in, we law our lelves perfectly safe from the Enemy, un-
less they alighted and attack'd us on Foot.
But to make this more difficult, our Portuguz,eT with in-i
defatigable Application, cat down great Arms of theTrees,and
Bid them hanging not cut quire bjs from one Tree to anotheivfo
tjjat he made a con tinued Fence almost round us.
W e staid here waiting the Motion of the Enemy soms
Hours, without perceiving they madeany Offer to stir $ whea
about-two Hours before Night, they came down directly
upon us, and tho' we had not perceiVd it, we found they
had been join'd by lome more of the fame, so that they
were near fouricore Horse, whereof however, we fancy'd
ibme were Women: They came on till they were within
half Shot of our little Wdod, when We fir'd one Musquet
without Ball, and call'd^to them in the RuJpMn Tongue, to
know what they wanted, and bid them keep oif j but as
if they knew nothing of what We said they came on with
a double Fury directly up to the Wood-fide, not imagining
we were Ib barricado'd that they could not break in j our old
Pilot was our Captain, as well as he had been our Engi-
neer j and dehVd of us, not to fire upon them till.they came
within Pistol-Shot, and that we might be sure to kill, and
that when we did fire, we should be sure to take good
Aim j we bad him give the Word of Command j whicii
he delay'd so long, that they were some of them within
two Pikes Length of us when we fir'd.
We aim'd so true, (or Providence directed our Shot so sure)
that we kill'd fourteen of them, at the first Volley, and wound-
ed several others,as also several of their Horsesj for we had all of
us loaded our Pieces with two or three Bullets a piece, at least.
They were terribly surpriz'd without Fire, and retreated
immediately about one hundred Rods from us 5 in which
Time, we loaded our Pieces again, and seeing them keep
that Distance, we seUy'd out and catch'd four or five of
their Horses, whose Riders, we suppos'd were kill'd, and
coming up to the Dead, we could easily perceive they were
Tartars, but knew not from what Country, or how they
came to make an Excursion soch an unusual Length,
About an Hour after they made a Motion to attack us again,
and rode round our little Wood, to see where else they might
break b but finding us always ready to face them^hey went off
again,, and we resolv'd not to stir from the Place for that Night.
We slept little, you may be sure, but spent the most Part
of the Night in strengthening our Situation, and barricado-
ing the Entrances into the Wood, and keeping a strict
Watch, we waited for Day-Light, and when it came, it
gave us a very unwelcome Discovery indeed, > for the En*-
my, who we thought were difcouragM with the Recep-
tion they had met with, were nowencreas'd to no lessthaa
three hundred, and had set up eleven or twelve Huts and
Tents, as if they we resolv'd to besiege us; and this little
Gamp they had pitch'd, was upon the open Plain, at about
three Quarters of a Mile from us. We were indeed forpriz/d
at this Discovery; and now I confess, I gave mj' self over
for lost, and all that 1 had: The Loss of my Effects did not
lieso near me, (tho* they were very considerable) as the Thoughts
of falling Into the Hands of such Barbarians, at the latter
End of my Journey, after so mariy Difficulties and Hazards
as* I had gone thro1 j and even in Sight of our Port, where
we expected Safety and Delivefence ; as for my Partner,
he was raging he declar'd, that to lose his Goods would
be his Rum; and he would rather die than be starved,- and
he was for righting to the last Drop.
The young Lord, as gallant as ever Flesh fhew'd it self,
was for fighting to the last also > and my old Pilot was of
the Opinion we were able to resist them all, in the Situa-
tion we then were in j and thus we spent the Day in De-
bates of what we should do j but towards Evening, we
found
found that the Number of our Enemies still encreas'd, per-
haps a$ they were abroad in several Parties for Prey; the
first hail sent out Scouts to call for Help, and to acquaint
them of the Booty, and we did not know, but by the Morn*
ing they might still be a greater Number j so I began to en-
quire of those People we had brought from Tobolskt, if there
was no other, or more private Ways by which we might a-
void them in the Night, and periiaps either retreat to some
Town, or get Help to guard us over the Deiart.
Tkf. Siberian, who was Servant to the young Lord, told
us, if we design'd to avoid them and not fight, he would
engage to carry us off in the Night, to a Way that went
Noith towards the River Petraz,, by which he made no
question, but we might get away^and the Tartars never the wi-
ier; but he laid, his Lord had told him, he would not return but
wouid rather chuse to sight: I told him, he mistook his Loi#,
for that he was too wise a Man to love fighting for the fake
of it i that I knew his Lord was brave enough by what he
had shew'd already; but that his Lord knew better, than
to desire to have seventeen or eighteen Men fight five hun-
dred, unless ail unavoidable Necessity forcM them to it j and
that if he thought it possible for us to escape in the Night,
we had nothing else to do but to attempt it: He answers,
If his Lord gave him such Orders, he would lose his Lire
if he did not perform it j we soon brought his Lord to
give that Order, tho' privately, and we immediately pre-
pared for the putting it in Practice.
And first, as soon as it began to be dark, we kindled a
Fire in our little Camp, which we kept burning, and pre-
paid so as to make it burn all Night, that the Tartars might
conclude we were still there; but as soon as it was dark,
(that is to lay) so as we could fee the Stars (for our Guide
would not stir before) having all our Horses and Camels
ready loader we followed our new Guide, who, I soon
'found, steer'd himself by the Pole, or North Star, all the
Country being level for a long Way.
After we had traveli'd two Hours very hard, it began
to be lighter still, not that it was quite dark all Night, but
the Moon began to rife, so that in short, it was rather light-*
er than we wiflVd it to be; but by six a-Clock next Morn-
ing we were gotten near forty Miles, tho1 the Truth is,
we amlost spoil d our Horses: Here we found a Kujftan
Village named Kirmazimkoy, where we rested, and heard
nothing of the Calmuck Tartars that Day j about two Hours
before
K ?4b }
before Tfight we set out again, and tr-ayeird till eight, the
teext Morning, thb* riot quite {b 'hastily is before, and-about
feven aÆfocK we pafs*ci ^little "River called $frtz,a, and*
came to a good large Town khabited by Ruffians, and very
l^bildus; called Oxomoys} tnere we' heard that several Troops
orHaords of Cdmucks had been abroad upon the Defart,
but that we Were now compleatly out' of Danger of them,
which was to bur great Satisfaction you may be sure: Here
we'were obiig'dto get fbrne fresh Horses, andjiaving need
enough of Reft, we staid five t>a^s; aritT my Partner and
i agreed-to givethe honest Sybermn, who brought us thi-
ther, the Value of ten Pistoles, for his conducting us.
-x In five Days more we-came to Yeupmal upon" the River
Wttz,ogday which running into the Dwma, we were there
very happily near the End of our Travels by Land, that
River being navigable in seven DaysPaslage to Arch-Angela
From hence we came tp Lawrenskoy* where the River
join/, the 3d of fal), and provided'our selves with two
Luggage Boats, and a Barge'fgr our Convenience,-we em-
barked the 7 th/and arriv'd all' fife at Arch-Angel the 18 th,
having Jbeen a Year, five Months and three Days on the
Journey, including our Stay of eight Months and odd
Days at Tobolski.
W e were oblig'd to stay at this Place six Weeks for the
Arrival of the Ships, and mug hajve tarry'd longer, had not
a Hamburgher come in above a Month sooner than any of
the Engltfo Ships? when after lome Consideration, that the
City of Hamburgh might happen to be as good a Market
for our Goods as London, we all took Freight with him,
and having put our Goods on board, it was most natural
for me to put my Steward on board to take care of them,
by which means my^youngXordhad a^siirBcient Oppor-
tunity to conceal ha^fHf,, never cording xm Shore again
in all the Time we staid there; aai:riu$ he dja\that ha
might npt be sees «i fhs £fty,/wherei#me of£fie Mftfioiv
Merchants would^certainly haye seen iad Æseoyer'd him,
We sail'd from ^r^-^»^/ the *oth q£.Af^u0hQ fame
Year, and aftetjno ^^aorjdinary Bad ^ya^ arriv'd in the
Elbe the 13 th oflSefoemfer; Here my Farmer and I found
a very good Sale for our Goods, as well those of Ghwa, as
the Sables, &c. of Siberia 5 -and dividing the Produce of
our Effects, my Share amouted to 347//» 17 $d. not-
withstanding so many Losses we hadiustain'd, and Charges

we had been at; only remembring that I had included m
this, about six hundred Pounds worth -of Diamonds whidi
I had purchas'd at Bengale.
Here the young Lord took his Leave of us, and went
up the El6e, in order to go to the Court of Vienna, where
he refblvd to seek Protection, and where he could cor-
respond with those of his Father's Friends, who were
left alive: He did not part without all the Testimo-
nies he could give me, of Gratitude for the Service I had
done him, and his Sence of . my Kindness to the Prince
his Father.
T o conclude, having staid near four Months in Ham-
hurgh I came from thence over Land to the Hague> where
I embark'd in the Paoquet, and arriv'd in London* the ioth
of January > 17 oj% having been gone from England ten
Years and nine Months.
And here, resolving to harrass my self no more, I am
preparing for a longer Journey than all these, having liv'd
72, Years, a Life of infinite Variety, and learn'd sufficiently
to know the Value of Retirement, and the Blessing of
ending our Days in Peace,
FINIS.
