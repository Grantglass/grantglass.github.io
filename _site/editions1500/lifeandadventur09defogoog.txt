THAT hdflacJy pWvfcrB, iiftd on f<5 matiy dccafioni ' 
in EngMntl, viz. That what is bred jn the bone 
trill not go out of the fleih, was never more verified than 
in the ftory of my life. — Any one would think, that 
iftcr thirfy-fivc years affliftion, and a variety of un- 

t happy ^ircuraftances, which few men, if ever any, went 
through before ; and after near'feven years of peace and 
fc enjoyment in the fuJnefs of all t&ings ; grown old, and 
iK^hen, if ever it might be allowed me to have had ex- 
ptrience of every ftate of middle life, and to know which 
was mod adapted to make a man completely happy ; I 
fay, after all this, any one would have thought that the 
native propenfityto rambling, which I gave an account 
of in my firft fetting out into the world, to have been lb 
predoniinant in my thoughts, fhould be worn out, thfc 
volatile part be fully evaporated, or at leaft eondenfed^ 
and I might, at fixty-one years of age, have been a little 
^ inclined to (lay at home, and have done venturing litfe 
^ and fortune any more. 

te Nay, farther, the common motive of foreign a(K'en- 

• tnres was taken away in me ; for I had no tbrtune to 

maker-I had nothing to feek. — 111 bad gained ten thou-

fand pounds, I had been no richer ; for I had already 
fnfficient for me, and for thofe I had to leave it to ; and 
that I had was vilibly incrcaiing ; for having no great 
family, I cculd not fpend the income of what I had, 
unlcfs 1 would fet up for an expcniive way of living, 
fuch as a great family, fervants, equipage, gaiety, and 
the like, which were things I had no notion of, or incli- 
nation to, fo that I had nothing indeed to do, hot to lit 
ftil), and fully enjoy what I had got, and fee it increafe 
daily upon my hands. 

Yet all thefe things had no effeft upon me, or at leail 
not enough to relift the ftrong inclination I bad to go 
abroad again, which hung about me like a chronical dif- 
ftemper ; particularly the defire of feeing my new plan- 
tation in the iiland,,and the colony 1 left there, run in 
my head continually.— I dreamed of it all night, and 
my imagination iran upon it all day ; it was uppermoil 
in all my thought?, and my fancy worked fo fteadily 
and (Irongly upon it, that I talked of it in my fleep ; 
in (hort, nothing could remove it out of my mind.— It 
even broke fo violently into all my difcourfes, that it 
made my converfation tirefome ; for I could talk of no- 
thing ehc ; all my difcourle ran into it, even to imper-» 
tinence ; and I faw it myfelf. 

I have often heard perfons of gootl judgment fay, that 
all the (lir people make in the world about gholts an^ 
apparitions, is owing to the ilrength of imagination « 
and the powerful operation of fancy in their minds ; 
that there is no fuch thing as a fpirit appearing, or a 
ghoil walking, and the like : that people's pouring affec- 
tionately upon the paft cpnverfation of their deceafed 
friends, fo realizes it to them, that they are capable of 
fancying, -upon lome extraordinary circumflances, that 
they fee them, talk to them, and are anfwcred by them, 
when, in truth, there is nothing but ihadow and vapour 
in the thing, and they really know nothing of the matter. 

P'or my part, 1 know not to this hour, whether 
there are any fuch things as real apparitions, i'pedtres, 
, or walking of people after they are dead, or whether 
there is any thing in the ftories they tell us of that kmd, 
more than the produdl o^' vapours, lick minds, and 
. Wiuiilering fancies. — But this I know, that my imagina- 
tion

tion worked mc up to fuch a height, and brought me into 
fuch exccfs of vapouvs, or what clfe I may call it, that 
1 adkually fuppofed myfelf oftentimes upon the fpot, at 
my old caftle behin^ the trees ; 1 faw my old Spaniard, 
Friday's father, and the reprobate failors, whom I left 
upon the ifland. Nay, I fancied I talked with them,^ 
and looked at them fo fteaddy, tho' I was broad awake, 
as the perfons juit before me ; and this I did till I often 
frightened myfelf with the images my fancy reprefented 
to nae.— One time, in my deep, I had the villainy of 
the three pirate failors to lively related to me by the 
firft Spaniard and Friday *s father, that it was ibrprifixx^r • 
they told me how they barbarouily attempted to murder 
all the Spaniards, and that they let Rre to the proviliqns 
they had laid up, on purpofe to didrefs and ilaive them ; 
things t||at I had never heard of, and yet they were all 
of them true in fa<5l ; and it was fo warm in , my ima- 
gination, and fo realized to me, that to the hour I 
, faw them, I could not be perfuaded but that it was, oc 
would be true ; alfo how I r^ented it, when the Spa- 
niards complained to me ; and how I brought them to 
juftice, tried them before me, aiid ordered them all three 
to be hanged.— What there was really in all this (hall 
be fcen in its place ;' for however I came to form' fuch 
things in my dream, and what fecret converfe of ipirits 
injeSed it, yet there was, I fay, very much of it true, 
I ow^ that this dream had nothing in it literally and 
fpeclfically true ; but the general part was fo true, the 
bafc and villanous behaviour of thefe three hardened 
rogues was fuch, and had been fo much worle than all I 
can defcribe, that the dream had too much fimilitude 
ofthefaft; and as I would afterwards have punifhed 
them \ I'evcrcly, fo if I had hanged them all, I had been 
much in the right, and ihould have been juiliiied both 
by the laws of God and man. 

But to return to my liory : in this kind of temper 
I had lived fome years ; I had no enjoyment of my 
life, no plcafant hours, no agreeable? diverllon, but 
what bad fomething or other of this in it ; fo that my 
wile, who faw my mind fo wholly bent upon it, told 
roe very feriouily one njght, that (he believed there was 
iorae iecret powerful impulle of Providence upon me,

which had determined me to go thither again; and that 
ihe found nothing hindered my going, but my being en- 
gaged to a wife and children. — She told me, that it was 
true, fhe could not think of parting with me ; but as fhe 
was^affurecl, that if ihe was dead, it would be the firft 
thing I would do ; i'o, as it fcemed to her, that the thing 
was determined above, fhe would not b^ the only ob- 
ftruaion ; for, rf J thought fit, and refolved to go- — ^ 
Here fhe found me very intent upon her words, and that 

1 looked very,earneftly at her ; fo that it a little difor- 
dered her, and l^.^ tropped. J aflied her why flie did not 
5^ Cr., «na fay out what fhe was going to fay. But I per- 
ceived her heart was too full, and Tome tears flood in 
her eyes.— Speak out, my dear, fays I, arc you willing 
1 fhodld go ? No, fays flie, very affectionately, I am far 
from willing; but if you are refolved to go, ftys fiic, 
rather than^ I will be the only hindrance, 1 wilFgo with 
you ; for though 1 think it a prepofterous thing for ene 
©f your years, and in your concUtion, yet if it mufl be, 
laid fhe again, weeping", I will not leave yon ; for if it be 
of heaven, you mult do it, there is no refiftug it — and 

if heaven makes it your duty to go, he will alfo make 
it mine to go with you, or otherwiie difpof<i^of me, that 
J may not obflrud^ it. 

This affectionate behaviouT of my wife, brought me 
a little out of the vapours, and I began to coniider what 
1 was doing — 1 corrected my wandering fapcj^ and be- 
gan to argue with myfelf fedately, what buiincfs I had, 
after three fcore years, and after fuch a life of tedious 
fufFerings and difalters, and clofed in lb happy and eafy 
a manner, I Cstyy what bufmefs had I to r^fh into new 
hazards, and put myfelf upon adventures, fife only for 
youth and poverty to run into. 

With thofe thoughts, 1 eonfidered my new engage-- 
mcnts — that I had a wife, one child born, and my wife 
then great with child of another ; and that I had all the 
world could give me, and had no need to feek hazards 
for gain r-that I was declining in years, and ought to 
think ratherof leaving what 1 had gained, than of feek- 
ino- to increafe it ; that as to what mf wife had faid, of 
its being an impulfe from hcUven, and that it fhould 
be my duty to go, I had no notion of that ; fo after

many of thefe cogitations, I. ilrugrglec} with the power 
of my imagination, reafoned myfelfout of it, asl believe 
people may always clo in like cafes, if they will, and, in 
a word, I conquered it : compofed myielf with fuch arga- 
raents as occurred to my thoughts, and which my prefent 
condition furnifhed me plentifully with ; and particular- 
ly, as the moft effcdiual metjiod, I refolved to divert my- 
felf with other things, and to engage in fome bufinefs 
. that might effedtu'ally tie me up from any more cxcur- 
iions of this kind ; for I found the thing returned upon , 
me chiefly when I was idle, had nothing to do, or any 
thing of moment immediately before me. 

To this purpofe 1 bought a little farm in "the county 
of Bedford, and refolved to remove myfelf thither. I had 
a little convenient houfe upon it, and the land about it 
I found was capable of great improvement, and thj\t it 
was many ways fuited to my inclination,Avhi9h 1 delight- 
ed in cultivating, managing, planting, and improving; 
and particularly, being an inland county, I was removed 
from converting among (hips, I'ailors, and things relating 
to the remote parts of the world. 

In a word, I went down to my farm, fettled my fa- 
mily, bought me ploughs-, harrows, a cart, waggon, 
horfes, cows, fheep ; and, letting ferioufly to work, 
became in one half year a mere country gentleman : 
my thoughts w^ere entirely taken up in managing my- 
fervants, cultivating the ground, encloiing, planting,: 
?cc. and 1 lived, as I thought, the moft agreeable life 
that nature was capable of directing, or that a man, 
always bred to mistbrtunes, was capable of being re- 
treated to. 

1 farmed upon my own land ; I had no rent to pay, 
was limited by no articles ; 1 could pull up, or cut 
down, as 1 plea fed ; what I planted was for myfelf, 
and what I improved was for my family ; and having 
thus left off the thoughts of wandering, I had not 
the leail difcomfort in any part of my life, as to this 
world. Now 1 thought, indeed, that I enjoyed that 
middle {late of life which my -father fo earneftly re- 
commended to me ; a kind of heavenly life, fomething 
like what is defcribed by the poet, upon the fubjedl of a 
country life.

10 AbVENTUHES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE* 

Free from vices, free from care. 

Age has' no pains, and youth no fnare. 

But in the middle of all this felicity, one blow frpm 
unforefeen Providence unhinged me at once, and not only 
jncide a breach upon me inevitable and incurable, but 
drove me by its confequence, upon a deep relapfe info 
the wandering difpofitipn, which, as I may fay, iJeing 
born in my very bipod, foon recovered its hold of me, 
atid, like the returns of a violent dillemper, came on 
with an irrefiftible force upon me ; fo that nothing could 
make any more impreflion upon me; This blow was 
the lofs of my wife. 

It is not ray buiinefs here to write an elegy upon my 
wife, to give a churadler of her particular Virtues, and 
make my court to the fex by the flattery of a funeral 
fermon. She wr.s, in a few words, the fVay of all my 
affairs, the centre of all my enterprifes ; the engine, 
that by her prudence reduced me to that happy compafs 
I was in, from the moft extravagant and ruinous projedl 
that fluttered in my head, as above ; and did more to 
guide my rambling genius, than a mother's tears, a 
lather's inftrudions, a friend's counfel, or all my own 
reafoning powers could do. I was happy in liftening to 
her tears, and in being moved by, her intreaties, and to 
the lall degree defolate and diflocated in the world by 
the lofe of her. 

When (he was gone, the world looked aukwardly 
round roe ; I was as much a Granger in it, in my 
thoughts, as i was in the Bratils, when ifirft went on 
Ihore there ; and as much alone, except as to the aflift- 
ance of fervants, as I was in my ifland. 1 knew neither

and repentance: and the men of labour fpend their

rculation of forrow, living but to work, and working 
t to live ; as if daHy bread were the gnly end of a 
earifome life, and a wearifome life the only occallon 
f daily bread. 
|- This put me in mind of the life I lived in my king- 
dom, the ifland, where I fuffered no more corn to grow, 
becaufe I did not want it ; and bred no more goats, be* 
caufe 1 bad no more ufe for them : where the money 
lay in the drawer till it grew mildewed, and had fcarce 
the favor to be looked upon in 20 years. 

All thefe things, had 1 improved them as I ought to 
have dqne, and as reafon and, religion had dictated to 
me, would have taught me to fearch further than human 
enjoyments for a full felicity, and that there was fome- 
thing which certainly was the reafon and end of life, 
fuperior to all thefe things, which was either to be pof- 
fcfled, or at Icaft hoped for on this iTde the grave. 

But ray fage counfellor was gone; I was like a (hip 
without a pilot, that could only run before the wind : 
my thoughts run all away again into the old affair, my 
head was quite tui^ned with the whimfies of foreign 
adventures, and all the plcaiing innocent amulements 
of my farm, and my garden, my cattle, and my family, 
which before entirely pofleflTed me, where nothing to me, 
had no reliih, and where like mufic to one that has no 
ear, or food to one that has no talle : in a word, I refolved 
to leave off houfekeeping, let my farm, and return to 
London ; and in a few months after I did fo. 

When 1 came to London, 1 was dill as uneafy as be^ 
fore ; I had no reli(h to the place, no employment in it, 
nothing to do but to faunter about like an idle peribn, 
of whom it may be faid, he is perfeAly ufelefs in God*» 
creation, and it is not one farthing matter to the red 
of bis kind whether he be dead or alive; This alfo was 
the thing,, which of all circumdances o( life was the 
mod my averiion, who had been all my days ufed to an 
a(5live life ; and 1 would 6ften fay to myfelf, a date of 
idlencfs is the very dregs of liie ; and indeed I thought I 
was much more fuitably employed, when I was 26 days 
making a deal board. 

It was now the beginning of the year 1693, when 
my nephew, whom, as I have obierved before, 1 had 

A 6 \i\^\i^ 






12 ACV£NTUR£a OF ROBIKSON CRUSOB>« 

brought up to the fea, and had made him commander of 
a {hip, was come home from a (hort voyage to Bilboa^ 
being the firft he had made ; he came to me, and told 
me, that fome merchants of his acquaintance had been 
propofing to him to go a voyage for them to the Eail- 
Indies and to China, as private-iraders : and now, uncle, 
^ys he, if you will go to fca with me, 1 will engage to 
land, you upon your old habitation in the ifland, for we 
are to touch at the Bradls. 

Nothing can be a greater demonftration of a future. 

Hate, and of the exillence of an-4nviiible world, than 

the concurrence of lecond caufes with the ideas of things, 

' which we form in our minds, perfcdlly feferved, and not 

ccmmunicated to any in the world. 

My nephew knew nothing how far my dillemper of 
wandering was returned upon me, and 1 knew nothing v 
of what he had in>his thoughts to fay ; when that very 
morning before he came to me, 1 had, in a great deal of 
confuiion of thought, and revolving every part of my 
** circumltances in my mind, come to this refolution, viz, 
that 1 would ^o to Lilbon, and confult with my old fea- 
captain, and fo, if it was 'rational and pra<5ticable, I 
would go and fee the ifland again, and feie what Was be^ 
come of my people there. I had pleafed myfelf alfo with 
the thoughts of peopling the place, and carrying inha- 
bitants from hence, getting a patent for the poireffion, 
mnd. 1 know not ^hat ; when in the middle of all this, in 
comes my nephew, as I have faid, with his projcdt of 
carrying me thither, in his way to the Eait-lndies. 
^ . I paufcd a while at his words, and looking iteadily a^ 
tim. What devil, faid I, fent you on this unlucky er- 
Kind'? My nephew ftartled, as if he had been 'frighted 
at firft ; but perceiving I was not much difpleafed witlv 
Ae propofal, he recovered himlelf ; 1 hope it may not be 
an unlucky propofal, fir, fays he ; I dare fay you would 
be pltafcd to fee your new colony there, where^you odc6 
reigned with more felicity than moft of your brother 
monarchs in the world. 

In a> word the fchemc hil; fo exaAly with my tem- 
per, that is to fay, with the prepoireffion 1 was under, 
and of which. I have laid fo much, that I told hir\i in 
jtw woi4s, if. he; agreed, wkh the n^crcbants, I woijd 



ADVENTURES OF HOBIH^ON CHUSOBb 15 

go withhin* : but 1 told him, I would riot proraife to go 
any fwtKcr than my owniiland. Why, Sir, fays hc^ you 
do not Want to be left there again, I hdj)e ? Why,.faitl I, 
can you not take me up again in 3'our return ? He told 
me it would not be poflible to do To ,; that the merchants 
would nevcr^ allow him t6 come that way with a loaden 
ihip of luch value, it being a month's fail out of his way, 
and might be tht'ee or four : Beiides, Sir, if I fhould mil- 
carry, faid he, and not return at all, then you would be 
Jull reduced to the condition you were in before. 

This was very rational; but we both found out a 
remedy for it, which was to carry a framed {loop on 
board the ihip, which, being taken in pieces, and 
ihipped on board the ihip, might, by the help of fome 
carpenters, whom we agreed to carry with us, be fet up 
again in the iiland, and iiniihed,, fit to go tq fea-in a few 
days. 

I was not long refolving ; for indeed the importuni- 
ties of my nephew, joined in fo efl^ic^ually with my irt- 
clinatioit, that nothing eould oppofe me*; on the other 
hand, my wife being de^d, I had nobody that concerned 
themlelves fo much for me, as^to perfuade me one 
way or other, except niy ancient good friend the wi- 
dow, who earnellly ftruggled with me to coniider my 
yearsj my eafy circumltanccs, and the needlefs hazard 
of a long voyage ; and, above all, my young children: 
but it was all to uo purpofe, I had an irrefiftible deiire 
to o-Q the voyage ; and 1 told her, 1 thought -there was 
Ibmethino- fo uncommon in the imj)reffions I had upon 
my mind for the voyage, that it would be a kind of 
relilting Providence, if 1 ihould attempt tp (lay at home ; 
after which ihe ceafed her expoilulations, and joined 
with me, not only in making prov^fion for my voyage, 
but alfo in fettling my family- affairs in my abfence, and 
providing for the education of my children. 

In order to this, 1 made my will, and fettled the 
cilate I had in fuch a manner for my children^ and 
placed it in fuch' hands, that I was perfedly eafy and 
fatisfied they would have juftice done them, whatever 
might befal me; and for their ' education, I left it 
wholly to my widow, wuth a fufficient maintenance to 
hcrfelf for her care; all which ihc richly deferved : for

no mother could have taken more, care in their educa- 
tion, or underftood it better ; and as fhe lived till I came 
home, 1 alio lived to thank her for it. 

My nephew was ready to fail about the beginning 
of January, 1694-5^ and 1, with my man Friday, went 
on board in the Downs the 8th, having, befides that 
iloop which I mentioned above, a very coniiderable 
cargo of all kinds of neceflary things for my colony, 
which, if I did not find in good condition, I refolved to 
leave fo. 

Firil, I carrried with me fome fervants, whom t 
purpofed to place there, as inhabitants, or at leaft, to 
let on work there upon my own*^ account whrlfe I {laid, 
and^ither to leave them there, or carry them forward; 
as they fhould appear willing, particularly I carried two- 
carpenters, a fmith, and a very handy ingenious fellow^ 
•who was a cooper by trade, but was alio a general me- 
chanic, for he was dextrous^ at making wheels, and 
hand-mills to gfind corn, was a good turner, and a 
good pot- maker; he alfo made any thing that was proper 
to make of earth, ©r wood* in a word, we call him. 
pur Jack of all trades. 

With thefe I carried a taylor, who.had offered himfelf 
to go palTenger to the Eaft Indies with my nephew, but 
afterwards conlented to flaj^ on our new plantation, and 
proved a molt necelfary handy fellow as could be deiired, 
in many other bufinelTes befides that of his trade ; for as 
I obferved formerly, neceffity arms us for all employ- 
ments. 

My cargo, as near as I can recoiled, for I have not 
kept an account of particulars, confining of a fufficient 
quantity of linen, and fome thin EngUfli fluffs for clothinor 
the Spaniards that I expelled to find there, and -enoucrh 
of them, as by my calculation might comfortably fupply 
them for feven years ; if 1 remember right, the materials 
which I carried for clothing them> with gloves, hats,

every kind, flaples, hooks, hinges, and every neceflTary 
thing I could think of. 

I carried alfo a hundred fpare arms, mufquets and 
fufils, heiides fome piltols, a confiderable quantity of 
Ihotofall fizes, three or four tons of lead, and two 
pieces of brafs cannon ; and becaufe I knew not what 
time, and what extremities, 1 was.providincr for, I car- 
ried an hundred barrels of powder, beiides Iwords, and 
cutlafles, and the iron part of fome pikes and halberts, 
fo that, in fhort, we had a large magazine of all forta 
of ftores ; and I made my nephew carry two fmall 
quarter-deck guns more than he wanted for his ihi(>, to 
leave behind, if there was occalion, that when they 
came there, we might build a fort, and man it againll 
all forts of enemies ; and indeed at lirft I thought there 
would be need enough of it all, and much more, if we 
hoped to maintain our poflellion of the iiland, as (hall be 
feen in the courfe of the llory. 

I had not fuch bad luck in this voyage, as I had 
heen ufed to meet with, and therefore ihall have the left 
occaiion to interrupt the reader, who perhaps may be 
impatient to hear how matters went with my colony ; 
yet lome odd accidents, crofs-winds, and bad weather 
happened, on thisfirft fetting out, which made the voyage 
longer than I expelled it at fivft ; and I, who had never 
made but one voyage, viz. ray lirft vojage to Guinea, 
in which I mi^ht be fa id to come back again, as the 
voyage was at nrft defigned, began to thitik the fame ill 
fate itiU attended me ; and that 1 was born to be never 
contented with my o>vn Ihore, and yfet to be always un- 
fortunate at fea. 

Contrary winds firil put us to the northward, and 
we were obliged to put in at Gal way, in Ireland, where 
we lay windbound two-and- thirty days ; but we had this 
fatisfad^ion with the difalter, that provilions were here 
exceeding cheap, and in the utmoft plenty ; fo thut while 
we lay here, we never touched the Ihip's ttores, but rather 
added to them; here alfo T took feveral hogs, and two 
cows with their calves, which 1 refolved, if 1 hi^d a good 
palTage, to p.ut aihore in. my iiland, but we found occafion 
to diipofe other wife of them.

16 iHJVENTURES OF ftOBINSON* CRUSaE. 

We fet out the 5th of February from Ireland,, and had 
a very fair gale of wind, for fome days ; as I renicni- 
bcr, it might be about the 20th of February, in the even- 
ing late, when the mate, having the watch, came ifvt^ 
the round-houfe, and told us he faw a flafh of fire, and 
heard a gun fired ; and while he was telling us- of it, a 
boy came in, and told us the boatfwain heard axiother. 
This made us all run out upon the quarter declc, where 
for a while we heard nothing, but in a few minutes we 
fawavcry great light, and found that tliere wa« fome 
very terrible fire at a diltance ; immediately we had re- 
coCirfe to our reckonings, in which we all agreed, that 
there could be no land, that way in which the fire 
Ihewed itfelf, no, not for 500 leagues, for it appeared 
at W. N. W. Upon tliis we concluded it maft be fom^ 
ihip on fire at fea; and ashy our hearing the noife 
of guns jult before, we concluded it could not be far 
off, we ftood di really towards it, and were prefently fa- 
tisficid we (hould difcover it, becaufethe farther we failed. 
the greater the light appeared, though the weather being 
hazy, we could not perceive any thing but ^the light ^ 
for a while: in about half an hour's failing, the wind 
being fair for us, though not much of it, and the weather 
^clearing up a little," we CQuld plainly difcern, that it was 
a great (hip on tire in the middle of the fea. I was 
tnoit feniibly touched with this difafter, though not at all 
acquainted with the perlons engaged in it. 1 prefently^ 
recolle(5led my former circumftances, in what condition 
I was in when taken up by. the Portuguefe captain ; and 
how much more deplorable the circumftances of the poor 
creatures- belonging to the fhip muft be, if they had no 
other (hip in company with them; upon this 1 im- 
mediately ordered tpat five guns ihould be fired, oine 
foon after another, that, if po{rible,.\ve might give notice 
to them, that there was help for them at hand, and that 
they might endeavour to fave themfelves in their boat ; 
for though we could fee the flame in the (hip, yet they^ 
it being: night, could fee nothihjj of us. 

,We lay by fome time upon this, only driving as the 
burning fhip drove, waiting for day-light'; when on a 
fudden, to our great terror, though we had reafon 
to exped it, the Ihip blew up in the air, and imme-

tliatcly funk! This was terrible, and indeed an affliAing 
fighf, for the lake of the poor men, who, I concluded, 
muft be either all deftroyed, in the ftip, or be in the ut- 
moft diftrefs in their boats in the middle of the ocean, 
which at prcfent, by reafon it was dark, I could not 
iee ; however, to dire6l them as well as I could, I caufed 
lights to be hung out in all parts of the (hip where 
we couldj and which we had lanthoms for, and kept 
firing guns all the night long, letting them know bf 
this, that there was a ihip not far off. 

About eight o'clock in the morning, we difcovered 
the (hip's boats, by the help of our perfpetftive-glafl^s, 
and found there were two of them, both thronged with 
people, and deep in the water ; we perceived they 
rowcd^ the wind being againll them ; that they faw our 
ibip, and did the utmoil to rrake us fee them. 

Wc immediately fpread our ancient, to let them know 
we faw them ; aiid hung a waft out, as a iignal for them 
to come on board, and then made more fail, flarfding 
<dire<5ily to them. In a little more than half an hour we 
^ came up with them, and, in a word, took them all in,, 
being no lefs than iixty-four men, women and children ; 
for there were a great many palTengers. 

Upon the whole, we found it was a French merchant- 
ihip of 300 tons, homeward bound from Quebec, in 
the river of Canada. The matter gave us a long ac- 
count of the difirefs of his (hip, how the fire began in the 
ileerage by the negligence of the iteerfman ; but, on his 
crying out for help, was, as every body thought, entirely 
put out ; but they foon found that fome fparks of the 
iirft fire had gotten into fome part of the (hip, fo difficult 
to come at, that they could not effeAually quench it ; and 
afterwards getting in between the timbers, and withia 
the cieling of the (hip, it proceeded into the hold, and 
mattered all the (kill and "all the application they were 
able to exert. 

They had no more to do then but to get into their 
boats, which, to their great comfort, were pretty large; 
being their long-boat, and a great (ballop, beiides a 
fraail (kiff, which was of no great fervicc to them, 
other than to get fome frcfh water and provittons mto

bcr, after they had fccured themfclves from the fire. 
They had indeed fmall hope of their lives by getting 
into thefe boats, at, that diflance from any land ; only, 
as they faid well, that they were cfcaped from the fire, 
and had a pQiTibility that fome (hip might happen to 
be at fca, and might take .them in. They had fails^ 
oars, and a compafs, and were preparing to make the 
bell of their way to Newfoundland, the wind blowing 
pretty fair, for it blew an eafy gale at S. E. by E. They 
Had as much provifions and water, as, with fparing it 
lb as to be next door to ftarving, might fupport them" 
about 12 days, in which, if they had no bad weather, 
and no contrary winds, the captain faid he hoped he 
miaht get to the banks of Newfoundland, and might 
perhaps take fome fifti to fuftain them till they might go 
on ihore. But there. were fo many chances againft 
them in all thefe cafes; fuch as florms to overfet and 
founder them, rains and cold to timumb.and peri(h 
thei^ limbs ; contrary winds to keep them out and liarvc 
them, that it muft have been next to miraculous if they 
had efcaped. 

In the midd of their confult^tions, etery one being 
hoi>clef8,. and ready to dtfpair^ the captain, with tearj 
in his eycl told me, they were on a fudden furprifed with 
the joy of hearing a gun fire, and after that four more ; 
thefe were the five guns which I caufed to be fired at firft 
feeing the light ; this revived their hearts, and gave 
them the notice, which, as above, I deligned it ihould, 
"VIZ. thnt there ^as a (hip at hand for their help. 

It was upon the hearing thefe guns, that they! took 
down their mails and fails, the found coming from 
the windward, th?y refolyed to lie by till morning. 
Some time after this, hearing no ^lore gAins, they fired 
three mufquets, one a coufiderable while after another ; 
butlhefe, the wind being contrary, we never heard. 

Some time at\er that again, they were ftill more 
agreeably furprift^d with feeing our lights, and hear-^ 
ing the guns, which, as 1 nave faia, I caufed to 
be fired all the reil of the night; this fet them to 
work with their oars to keep their boat's a-head,^ at 
lead that wc might the fooaer come up with them, ;

ami at laft, to their incxpreffible joy, they found we faw 
thera. V 

It is impoflible for me to cxprefs the Cevcral' gefturcs, 
thcftrange ecftacics, the variety of poftures, \i/hich thefc 
poor delivered people run into,, to cxpreisthejoy of tbeiy 
fouls at fo unexpe6le<J a deliverance ; grief and fear ar^ 
eafily dcfcribed; iighs, tears, groans, and a very few rnoti- 
onsof the head and hands, making up the fum of its vari^ 
ety: but an excefs of joy, a furprile of joy , has a thoufand ' 
cxtraragancies in it ; there were fome in tears, fome 
raging and tearing themfclves, as if they had been in the 
^eateft agonies of forrow ; fome dark raving aiid down- 
right lunatic ; fome ran » about the (hip llamprng with 
their feet, others wringinjr their hands : fome were 
oancmg, feveral tinging, fome laughing, more crying, 
many quite dumb, not able to fpeak a word, others lick 
and vomiting, feveral fwooning, and, ready to faint, and 
a few were croffing themfelves and giving God thanks. 

I would not wrong them neither ; there tnight be many 
that were thankful afterwards ; but the pattion was too 
ilrong for them at firft, and they were not able to mailer 
it; they were thrown into ccftacies and a kind of frenzy, 
and fo there were but a very few vrh:^ were compofed 
and feripus in their joy. 

Perhaps alfo the cafe may have fome addition to it, 
frpm the particular circuraftances of the nation they be* 
Jonged to ; I mean the French, whofc temper is allowed 
to be more volatile, more paliionate, and more fprightly, 
and their fpirits more fluid than of other nations. 1 
am not philofopher enough to determine the caufe, but 
nothing I had ever feen before came up to it: the ec- 
llacies poor Friday, my trully favage, was in, when he 
found his father in the boat, came the neareU to it ; and 
the furprile of the mailer and his two companions, whom 
1 delivered from the two villains that fet ihcm on (hore 
in the iiland, came a little way towards it ; but nothing 
was to compare to this, either that I faw in Friday, or 
any where elie in my life. 

it is farther obfervable, that thefe extravagancies did , 
not {hew themfelves in that different manner I have 
mentioned, in different pcrfons only ; but all ,the va- 
riety would 'appear in a fhort fucccifion of xnoments.

in one and the fame perfon, A man that ^^e fa\^ this 
minute dumb, and, as it were, ftupjd and confounded, 
ihould the next minute be dancing and hallooihg like 
an antick, and the next ipoment tearing his hair, or 
pulling his cloaths to pieces, and (lamping them undei 
his feet like a madman; a few minutes after that, we 
fhould have him all in tears, then iick, then fwooning ; 
and had not immediate help been had, would, in a fev^ 
moments more, have been dead ; and thus it was, not 
with one or two, or ten or twent3% but with the greateft 
part of them ; and, if 1 remember right, our furgeon was 
obliged to let above thirty of them blood. 

There were two priefls among them, one an old tlian, 
and the other a young man ; and that which was ftrangcll 
tvas, that the oldcft roan was the worft. 

As foon as he fet his foot on board our (hip, and 
few himfelf fafe, he dropped down ftonc dead, to all 
appearance ; not the leaft fign of life conld be perceived 
in him ; 'our furgeon immediately appliecf ptoper reme- 
dies to recover him, and was the only ittan in the Ihip 
that believed he was not dead ; and at length he opened 
t vein in his arm^ having firft chafed and' rubbed thb 
part, fo as to warm it as mach as pofRble ; upon this the 
blood, which only drop{>ed at firft, flowed fomething 
freely ; in three minutes after the man bpened his eyes, 
and about a quarter of an hour after that &e fpoke ; 
grew better, and, in a little time, quite well ; after the 
blood was ftopped, he walked about, told us he was per- 
fectly well, took a dram of cordial which the furgeon 
gave him, and was, what we called, come to himfelf. 
About a quarter of an hour after this, they came pun*

and well, - • 

The younger prieft behaved bimfelf with great com- 
mand of his pafiion, and was really an example 'ot a 
ferious well^ovemed mind ; at his fim coming on boaid 
the Ihip, he threw himfelf flat on his face, proftraiing 
himlclt' in thankftilnefs tor his deliverance, in which 1 
unhappily and unfeafonably dilturbed him, really think* 
ing he had been in a fwoon; but he Ipake calmly, 
thanked me, told me he was giving God thanks for his 
V deliverance, begged me to leave him a few moments, 
and that, next to his Maker, he would give me thanks 
alfo. ^ 

1 was heartily forry that I difturbed him, and not only 
left him, but kept others from interrupting him alfo ; 
he continued in that poilure about three minutes, or 
a little more, after 1 left him ; then came to me, as he 
faid he would, and, with a great deal of lerioufneTs. 
and affection, but with tears in his eyes, thanked me,_ 
that had, under God, givea him, and lo many miferable 
creatures their lives. 1 told him 1 had no room to 
move him to thank God for it, rather than me; for I 
had feen, that he had done that already : but J added, 
that it was nothing but what reafon and humanity^ dic- 
tated to all men, and that we had as much reafon as he 
to give thanks to God, who had blefled^ us fo far as to 
make us the iniiruments of his mercy to fo many of his 
creatures. 

After this, the young prieil applied himfelf to his 
country-folks, laboured to compote them, perfuaded, 
intreated, argued, reafoned with them, and did nis utmoft 
to keep them within the exercile of their reafon ; and 
with fome he had fuccefs, though others were, for a 
Ume^ out of all government of themfelves. 

1 cannot help committing this to writing, as perhaps 
it may be ufefal to thofe into whofe hands it may fall, 
in the guiding themfelves in all the extravagancies of 
their paffions; for if an excefs of joy can carry men 
out to fuch a length beyond the reach of their reafon, 
what will not the extravagancies of anger, rage, and 
a provoked mind, carry us to ? And indeed, here I faw

paffions of every kind, as well thofe of joy and fatis- 
I'adlion, as tb,ofe of forrow and anger. 

We were (bmething difordered by thefe extravaganices 
among our new guefts for the iirft day ; but when they 
had been refrefliedi lodgings provided fpr them as well 
as our (hip would allow, ami they had flept heartily, as 
molt of tbem did, being fatigued arfd frightened, they 
"^ere quite another fort of people the next day. 

Nothing of good manners, or civil acknowledgments 
for the kindnefs (hewn them was wanting; the French,^ 
'tis known, are naturally apt enough to exceed that way. 
The captain, and one of the priells, came to me the 
next day, and, defiring to fpeak with me and my ne- 
phew, the commander, began to confult with us what 
Should be done with them ; and firft they told us, that, as 
we had faved their lives, fo all they had was little, 
enough for a return to us for the kindnefs received. The 
•captain faid, they had faved fome money, and fome 
things of value in their boats, catched haftily out of the 
ilames ; and if we would accept it, they were ordered to 
•make an offer of it all to us ; they only deiired to be fet 
■on (hore foinewherc in our way, where, if polliblc, they 
might get a paflageto France. 

My nephew was for accepting their money at firft 
word, and to coniider what to do with them afterwards; 
but I over-ruled him in that part, for 1 knew what it 
was to be fet on Ihore in a Ihange country ; and if the 
Portugal captain, that took' me up at fea, had ferved me 
fo, and took all 1 had for ray deliverance, I mud have 
itarved, or have been as much a (lave at the Brafils, as I 
had been at Barbary, the being ibid to a Mahometan 
only ex-ceptcd ; and perhaps a Portuguefe is not a much 
better malter than a Turk, if not in lome cafes, a m^ich 
worfe. 

' I therefore told the French captain, that we had taken 
them up in their diftrefs, it was true, but that it was 
our duty to do fo, as we were fellow-creatures, and a» 
we would delire to be fo delivered, if we were in the 
like or any other extremity ; that we had done nothing 
for them, but what we believed they would have done 
for us if we had been in their cafe, and they in ours; 
but that we took them up to fcrvc them not to plunder

them ; and that it would be a moil barbarous ffalng, to 
take that little from them which they had faved out of 
the fire, and then fet them on ihore, and leave them; 
that this would be firft to fave them from death, and 
then kill them ourfelves ; f»ve them from drowing, and 
then abandon them to fiarvinjc; and therefore I would

them on lliore, I told them, indeed, that was an exceed- 
ing great difficulty to us, for that the (hip was bound to the 
Eaft Indies, and thousch we were driven out of our 
courfc to the weftward a very great way, which perhaps 
was direfted by heaven on purpoic for their deliverance, 
yet it was impoffible for us wilfully to change our voyage 
on this particular account ; nor could my nephew, the 
captain, anfwer it to the freighters, with whom he was 
under charter-party to purfue his voyage by the way 
of Brafil ; and all I knew he could do for them was, 
to put ourfelves in the way of meeting with other (hips 
homeward-bound from the Well Indies, and get them 
paflage, if poffibk, to England or France, 

The firtl part of the propofal was fo generous and 
kind, they ^ould not but be very thankful for it ; but 
they were in a great conflemation , especially the paf- 
^gers, at the notion of being carried awav to the Eaft 
indies; they then entreated me, that, teeing 1 was driven 
fo far to the wellward before I met with them, I would 
at leatt keep on the fame courie to the banks of New- 
foundland, where it was poffible I might meet with fomc 
fti|) or floop that they^might hire to carry them back to 
Canada, from whence they came. 

1 thought this was but a reafonab?e requeft on their 
part ; and therefore i inclined to a scree to it ; for indeed 
coniidered, that to carry this whole company to the 
Eaft Indies, would not only be an intolerable feverity to 
the poor people, ''but would be ruining our whole voy- 
age by devouring all our provifions ; fo I thought it no 
breach of charter-party, but what an unforefeen acci- 
dent made abfolutely necelTary to us, and in which no 
one CQuld fay we were to blame ; for the laws of God 
and Nature would have forbid, that we Ihould rcfufe 
t3 take up two boats full of people in fuch a diftrelfed 
condition; and the nature of the thing as well re-

fpefting ourfelves, as the poor people, obliged us to fee 
them on Hiore fomewhere* or other, for their deliver- 
ance ; fo I confented that we would carr)rthem to New- 
foundland, if wind and weather would permit ; and, if 
not, that I would carry them to Martinico in the Weft 
Indies. 

The wind contintted frefh eaflerly, but the weather 
pretty good, and as it had blowed continually in the 
points between N. E. and S. E. a long time, we miffed 
feveral opportunities offending them to France ; for 
we met feveral fliips bound to Europe, whereof two 
were French, from St. Chriftopher's ; but they had b^en 
fo long beating up againil the wind, that they durft take 
in no paflengers for fear of wanting provifions for the 
voyage, as well, for themfelves as for thofe they Ihould > 
take in : fo we were obli«:ed to ^o on. It 'was about a 
week after this, that we made the Banks of Newfound- 
land, where, to fhorten my ftor}'-, we put lall our French 
j)eople on board a bark, which they hired at fea there 
Xo put them on fhore, and afterwards to carrj'^ them to 
France, if they could get provifion to vicflual themfelves 
with; when, 1 fay, all the French went on (hore, I 
ihould remember, that the young priell I fpoke of, 
hearing: we were bound to the Eaft Indies, defired to 
go the voyage with us, and to be fet on (hore on thq 
CO aft of Coromandel ; I readily agreed to that, for I 
wonderfully liked the man, and had very good reafon, 
«8 will appear afterwards; alfo four of the leamen 

•• entered themfelves in our ihip, aaj^ proved very ufeful 
fellows. 

From hence we diredted our courfe for the Well 
Indies, (leering away S. and S. by E. foriibout 20 days 
together, fo'metimes little or no wind at all, when we 
met with another fubjed: for our humanity to work 
upon, almoft as deplorable as that before.

good, wind at N. N. W. a frcOi gale, and wc foon came 
to f(>cEL with her. 

We found her a (hip of Briftol, bound home from 
Barbadoes, but had been blown out of the road at Bar- 
badoes, a few days before (he was ready to iail, by a 
terrible hurricane, while the captain and chief mate 
were both gone on ihore ; fo that befides the terror of the 
ftorm, they were but in an indifferent cafe for good 
artifts to bring the (hip home : they had been already 
nine weeks at fea, and had met with another terrible 
ftorm after the hurricane was over, which had blown 
them quite out of their knowledge, to the weftward, 
and in which they loft their mafts, as above ; they told 
us, tbey expeded to have feen the Bahama Iflands, but 
were then driven away again to the fouth-eaft,. by a 
ftrong gale of wind at N. N. W. the fame that blew 
now, and having no fails to work the (hip with, but a 
naain-courfe, and a kind of fquare-fail upon a jury fore- 
raaft, which they had fet up, they could not lie near the 
wind, but were endeavouring to ftand away for the 
Canaries, 

But that which was worft of all, was, that they were 
almoft ftarved for want of proviiions, befides the fatigues 
they had undergone : their bread and fleQi was quite 
gone, they had not an ounce left in the (hip, and had had 
none for eleven days : the only relief they had was, 
their water was not all fpent, and they had about half a 
barrel of flour left ; they had fugar enough ; forae 
fuccades or fweetmeats they had at firft, but they were 
devoured, and they had feven cafks of rum, 

I'here was a youth and his mother, and a maid-fer- 
vant, on board, who were going pafiengers, and think- 
ing the ftip was ready to fail, unhappily came on board 
the eveninor before the hurricane begran : and havinoj no 
proviiions of their own left, they were in a more de- 
plorable condition than the reft; for the feamen, being 
reduced to fuch an extreme neceftity therafelves, had no

liad ndtf led me, the weather ]?eing fair, snd the wind 
abated, to go on board the ifhip ; the fecond mate, who, 
upon this occcafion commanded the (hip, had been on 
>oard our (hip : and he told me indeed, that they had 
three pafiengers in the great cabin, that they were in a 
c'eplorable condition ; nay, fays he, 1 believe they arc 
-dead, for I have heard nothing of them for above two 
days; and I was afraid to enquire after them, faid he, 
for I had nothing to relieve them with. 

We immediately applied ourfelves to give them what 
relief we could fpare ; and indeed I haH fo far over-ruled 
things with my nephew, that I would have victualled 
them, though we-^a'd gone away to Virginia, or any 
part of the coall of America, to have fupplied ourfelves; 
but there was no neceffity for that. 

But now they w ere in a new danger ; for they were 
afraid of eating too mu\h,even of that little we gave them; 
the mate or commander hi ought lix men with him in his 
boat ; but thcfe poor wretches looked like Skeletons, and 
were fo weak, Ihey could hardly lit to their oars : the 
mate himfelfwas very ill, and h»ilf fta^rv^d ; for he de- 
clared he had referved nothing from the men, and. went 
Ihare and (hare alike with them in every bit they eat. 

I cautioned him to eat fparingly, but fet meat before 
bim immediately, and he had not eaten three moutbfuls 
before he began to be tick, and out of order : fo he fto]>ped 
awhile, and our furgeon mixed him up fomething with 
fome broth, which he faid 'would be to him both food 
and phyfic ; and after he had taken it, he grew better : 
in the mean time, 1 forgot not the men ; I ordered 
■viftuals to be given them, and the poor creatures rather 
devoured than eat it ;• they were fo exceeding hungry, 
that they were in a manner ravenous, and had no com- 
mand of themfelves ; and two of them eat with fo much 
greedinefs, that they were in danger of their lives the 
next morning. 

The fight of thefe people's diftrefs was very moving 

to me, and brought to mind what I had a terrible prof- 

ped: of at my iiril conning on fhore in my ifiand, where 

I had not the lead mouthful of food, or any hopes of 

|)rocuring it; befides the hourly apprehenlieai 1 bad

of being made the food of other creatores.' Bat all the 
while the mate \ras thus rclatins: to me the miferable 
tondition of the ihip*s company, I could not put out 
of my thought the itory. he had told me of the three 
poor creatures in the great cabin (vii.) the mother, her 
ion, and the maid fenrant, whom he had heard nothing 
offer ^.wo or three days; and whom he feemed to con- 
fefs they had wholly negleifted, their own extremities 
being fo great ; by which I underftood^ that they had 
really given them no food at all ; and that therefore they 
mud be perifhed, and be all lying dead perhaps on the 
floor or de{k of the cabin. 

As I therefore kept the mate, whom we then called 
captain, on board with his men to refrefli them, fo I alio 
forsjot not the ftarvinsj crew that were left on board, but 
ordered my own boat to go on board the ffiip, and with 
my mate and twelve men to carry them a fack of bread, 
aiul four or five pieces of beef to boil. Our i urgeon charged 
the men to caufe- the meat to be boiled while they itayed, 
and to keep guard in the cook-room, to prevent the men's 
taking it to eat raw, or taking it out of the pot before it 
was well boiled, and then to give every man but a little 
at a time ; and by this caution he preferved the men, who 
would otherwife have killed themfelves with that very 
food that was given them on purpofe to fave their lives. 
At the fame time I ordered the mate to go into the 
great cabin, and fee what condition the poor paflen- 
gers were in, and if they were alive, to comfort them, and 
give them what refrefhment was proper; and the furgeon 
gave him a large pitcher with fome of the prepared broth 
which he had given the mate that was on board, and 
which he did not queftion would rcftore them gradually. 
I was not fatisfied with this ; but, as I faid above, 
havirfg a great mind to fee the fcene of miiery, which I 
knew the fhip itfelf would prefent me with, in a more 
lively manner tjian I could have it by report, I took the 
captain of the fhip, as we now called him, with me, and 
went myfelf a little after in their boat. 

1 found the poor men on board almoil in a tumult 

o get the vidtuals out of the boiler before it was ready : 

but my mate obferved his orderj and kept a good 

guard at the cook-room door j and the man he

placed there, after ufing all poflible perfuafion to liave 
patience, kept them off* by force : however, he caufed 
ibme bifcuit cakefe to be dip])ed in the pot, and foftened 
them with the licfuor of the meat, which they call 
brewis, and gave them every one one, to flay their ftom- 
achs, and told them it was for their own fafety that 
he was obliged to give them but little at a time. But 
it tvas all in vain, and had I not come on board, and 
their own commander and officers with me> and with 
good words, and fome threats alfo of givifig them no 
more, 1 believe thev would have broke into the cot)k- 
room by force, and tore the meat out of the furnace; 
for words indeed are of a very fmall force to an hungry 
belly : however T^e pacified them, and fed them gradu- 
ally and cautioufly for the firft time, and the next time 
gave them more, and at laft filled their bellies, and the 
men did well enougfh. 

But the rtiifery of the poop pafTengers in the cabin was 
of another nature, and far beyond the reft ; for as, firll, 
the (hip's company had I'o little for themfelves, it was 
but too true, that they had at firlt kept them very low, 
and at laft totally neglected them ; fo that for fix or 
feven days, it might be faid, they had really had no. 
food at all, and for feveral days before very little. 

The poor mother, who, as the firft mate reported, was 
a "woman of good fenfe, and good breeding, had (|)ared 
all ihe could get lb atFedtionately for her fon, that at laft 
ihe entirely funk under it ; and when the mate of our 
Ihip went in, fhe fat upon the floor or deck, with her 
back up againft the fides, between two chairs, which 
■were lafhed fall, and her head funk in between her fhoul- 
ders, like a corpfe, though not quite fo dead. My mate 
faid all he could to revive and encourage her, and with 
a fpoon put fome, broth into her mouth ; {he opened her 
lips, and lifted up one hand, but could not fpeak ; yet 
ihe underftood what he laid, and made figns to him, in- 
timating, that it was too late for her ; but pointing to 
her child, as if fhe would have faid, they fhould take 
care of him. 

However the mate, who was exceedingly moved with 
the fight, endeavoured to get fome of the broth into her 
mouth ; and, as he faid, got two or three fpoonfuls down, 



ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 2^ 

though I queftion whether he could be fure of it or not : 
but it was too late, and fhe died the fame night. 

The youth, who was prcferved at the price of his mod 
afFedlionate mother*s life, was not lb far gone ; yet he lay 
in a cabin-bed as one ftretched out, with hardly any life 
left in him ; he had a piece of an old glove in his mouth, 
having eaten up the rcll of it ; however being young, 
and having more flrength than his mother, the mate got 
fomething down his throat, and he began fenfibly to re- 
vive, though by giving him fome time after but two or 
three fpoonfuls extraordinary, he w;as very lick, and 
brought it up again. 

But the next care was the poor maid ; (he lay all along 
upon the deck hard by her miilrefs, and juft like one that 
had fallen down with an apoplexy, and flruggled for 
life; her limbs were deflorted, one of her hands was 
clafped round the frame of one chair, and {he griped it 
fo hard, that we could not eafily make her let it go ; her 
other arm lay over her head, and her feet lay both to- 
getherj^ fet fall againft the frame of the cabin-table ; in 
fliort, fhe lay juix like one in the lall agonies of death ; 
and yet Ihe was alive too. 

The poor creature was not only flarved with hunger, 
and terrified with the thoughts of death, but, as the men 
told us afterwards, was bioken-heart6d for her miilrefs, 
whom fhe faw dying two or three days before, and 
whom (he loved moll tenderly. 

We knew not what to do with this poor girl ; for when 
our furgeon, who was a man of very great knowledge 
and experience, and with great application recovered her 
as to life, he had her upon his hands as to her fenfes, for 
(he was little lefs than diftradled for a confiderable time 
after ; as fliall appear prefently. 

Whoever Ihall read thefe memorandums, mull be de- 
fired to conlider, that vilits at fea are not like a jour- 
ney into the country, where fometimes people Itay a 
week or_a fortnight at a place. Our bufinefs was to 
relieve this dillrelTed fhip*s crew, but not lie by for 
them ; and though they were willing to lleer the fame 
cburfe with us for fome days, yet we could carry no 
fail to keep pace with a Ihip that had no mads ; how- 
ever, as their captain begged of us to help him. to fet utj

a miiin-top-rnad, and a kind of top-maft to his jury-- 
fore-mait, we did, as it were, lie by him for three or 
four days, and then having given him five barrels of beef 
and pork, two hogiheads of bifcuit, and a proportion of 
peas, flour, and what other things we could fpare ; and 
taking three cafks of fugar and fome rum, and fome 
pieces of eight of them for fatisfa<5lion, we left them, 
taking on board with us, at their own earneil requeft', 
theyouth, and the maid, and all their goods. 

The young lad was about feventeen years of age, a 
pretty, well bred, modelt, and fenfible youth ; greatly 
dejefted with the lofs of his mother, and as it feems, 
had loft his father but a few months before at Bkr- 
badoes. He begged of the furgeon to fpeak to me, to 
take him out of the fliip ; for he faid, the cruel fellows 
had murdered his mother; and indeed. fo they had, that 
is to fay, pafTively ; for they might have fpared a fmall 
fultenance to the poor helplefs widow, that might have 
preferved her life, though it had been jull to keep her 
alive. But hunger knows no friend, no relation, no juf- 
tice, no right ; and therefore is remorfelefs, and capable 
of no companion. 

The furgeon told him how far we were going, and how 
it would carry him away from all his friends, and put 
him perhaps in as bad circumllances almoft as we 
found them in ; that is to fay, ftarving in the world. 
He faid it mattered not whither lie went, if he was but 
delivered from the terrible crew that he was among : 
that the captain (by which he meant me, for he could 
know nothing of my nephew) had faved his life, and 
he was fure would not hurt him ; and as for the maid, he 
"^Vas fure, if fhe came to herfelf, fhe would be very thank- 
ful for it, let us carry them whither we would. The fur- 
geon reprefented the cafe fo affe6iicnately to me, that I 
yielded, and we took them both on board with all their 
goods, except eleven hogflieads of fugar, which could 
not be removed, or come at ; and as the youth had a 
bill of lading for them, I made his commandei' fign a 
writing, obliging him to go, as foon as he came to Brif- 
tol, to one Mr. Rogers, a nverchant there, to whom the 

/outh faid he was related, and to deliver a letter which 
wrote to him, and all the ^oods\ie\v3Ldbdoii^viv^ to the

deceaied widow ; which T fuppofe was not done ; for I 
couhl never learn that the Ihip came to Briltol ; but 
was, as is moil probable, loll at fea, being in fo di fabled 
a condition, and fo far from any land, that I am of opi- 
nion, the firll florm fhe met with afterwards, (he might 
founder in the fea ; for (he was leaky, and had damage 
in her hold, when 1 met with her. 

I was now in the latitu<ie of I J) deg. 32 min. and had 
hitherto had a tolerable voyage as to weather, though at 
firll the winds had been contrary. I fliall trouble no- 
body with the jittle incidents of winds, weather, cur- 
rents, &c. on the rcil of our voyage ; but (hortening 
my (lory for the fake of what is to follow, (hall oblerve 
that^ came to my old habitation, the ifland, on the 1 0th 
of April, 1695. It was with no fmall diihculty that I 
found the place: for as l^ame to it, and went from it 
before, on the fouth and eaft fide of the illand, as com- 
ing from the Brazils, fo now comino: in between the main 
and the ifland, and having no chart for the coall, nor 
any land ratark, 1 did i>ot know it when I faw it, Or 
know whether 1 faw it or no. , 

We beat about a great while, and went on fhore on 
feveral iflands in Jthe mouth of the great river Oroonoque 
but none for my purpofe ; only this 1 learned by my 
coafting the (hore, that 1 was under one great millake 
before, viz. that the continent which I thought I faw, 
from the ifland I lived in, was really no C9ntinent, but 
a long ifland, or rather a ridge of iflands. reaching from 
one to the oj;her fide of the extended mouth of that 
great river ; and that the favages who came to my ifland, 
were not properly thofe which we call Caribees, but 
iflanders, and other Barbarians of the fame kind, who 
inhabited fomething nearer to our fide than the rell. 

In fliort, 1 vilited feveral of the iflands to no purpofe ; 
fome 1 found were inhabited, and fome were not. On 
one of them I found fome Spaniards, and thought they 
had lived- there ; but, fpeaking with them, found they 
had a floop lay in a fmail creek hard by, Hnd that they 
came thither to make fait, and catch fome pearl-mufcks 
if they could; but they belonged to the ifle de Trini- 
dad, which lay further Jiorth, in the latitude of 10 and 
11 degrees.

Thus coafting from one id and to an other, fometimrt 
with the {hip, fometimes with the P'renchman's ihallop, 
which we had found a convenient boat, and therefore 
kept her with their very good will, at length I came fair 
on the fouth-fide of my ifland, and I prelently knew the 
very countenance of the place ; fo I brought the (hip 
fafe to an anchor, broadfide with the little creek where 
was my old habitatioii. 

As foon as I faw the place, I called for Friday and 
afked him, if he knew where he was } He looked about a 
little, and prefenily clapping his hands, cried ; O yes, O 
there, O yes, O there, pointing to our old habitation, and 
fell a dancing and capering like a mad fellow, and I -had 
much ado to keep him from jumping into the fea, to 
fwim alhore to the place. v 

Well, Friday, faid.I, do you think welhall find any 
body here or no? And what do you think, fhall we fee 
your father? The fellow ftood mute as a Hock a good 
while.^ but when I named his father, the poor affcdlionate 
creature looked dejeded ; and I could fee the tears run 
down his face very plentifully. What is the matter Fri- 
day, faid I ? Are you troubled becaufc you may fee your 
father? No> nd, fays he, ihaking his head, no fee him 
more, no ever more fee again. Why fo, faid I Friday ? 
How do you know that? O no, O no, fays Friday, he 
long ago die ! long ago he much old man 1 Well, well 
iaid I, Vriday, you don't know : but fhall we fee any one 
clfe then : the fellow,*it feems, had better eyes than I, 
and he points juft to the hill above my old houfe; and 
though we lay half a league off, he cries out. Me fee ! me 
fee ! yes, yes, me fee much man there, and there, and 
there! I looked, but I could fee nobody, no, not with a 
perfpedlive glafs ; which was, I fuppofe, becaufe I could 
not hit the place ; for the fellow was right, as 1 found 
upon enquiry the next day, and, there were fiv^ or fix 
men altogether flood to look at the fhip, not knowing" 
what to think of us. 

As foon as Friday had told me he faw people, I caufed 
the Englifh ancient to be fpread, and fired three guns, 
to give them notice we wei^e friends ; and about half 
a quarter of an hour after, we perceived a fmoke rife • 
from the £de of the creek; fo 1 immediately ordered 

a boat

a boat out, taking Friday with* me ; and, hanging out » 
white flag* or a flag of truce, I went dircAly on Ihore ; 
takino- with me the young friar I mentioned, to whom I 
had told the whole flory of my living there, and the ^ 
manner of it, and every particular, both of my myfelf 
and thofe that 1 left there, and who was on that account 
extremely deiirous to go with me, We had befides about 
iixteen men very well armed, if we had found any new 
guell there which we did not know of ; but we had no 
need of weapons. 

As we went on (hore upon the tide of flood, near high 
water, we rowed diredtly into the creek ; and the firfl 
man I fixed my eye upon, was the Spaniard whofe life I 
had faved, and whom I knew by his face perfe6tly well ; 
as to his habit, I (hall defcribe it; afterwards. I ordered 
nobody to go on fhore at firft but myfelf, but there was 
no keeping Friday in the boat, for the afliedtionate crea- 
ture had fpied his father a.t a diftance, a good way off' of 
the Spaniards, where indeed I faw nothing of him ; and 
if they had not let him go on fliore, he would have 
jumped into the fea. He was no fooner on fhore, but 
he flew away to his father, like an arrow out of a bow. 
It would have made ai^y man fhed tears, in fpite of the 
firmed refolution, to have feen the firft tranfports of this 
poor fellow's joy, when he came to his faiher ; how he 
embraced him, kilTed him, ilrokcd his face, took him 
up in his arms, fet him down upon a tree, and lay down 
by him; theft ftood and looked at him, as any one 
would look at a flrange picture, for a quarter of an hour 
together ; then lay down upon the ground, andftroked 
his legs, and kiffed them, and then got up again, and- 
flared at him ; one would have thought the fellow 
bewitched ; but it would have made a dog laugh to {t^ 
-how the next day his paflion ran out anorfier way : in the 
morning he walked along the fhore, to and again, with 
his father fcveral hours, always leading him by the hand; 
as if he had been a l&dy ; and every now and then would 
come to fetch fomething or other for him to the boat, 
cither a lump of fugar, or a dram, a bifcuit, or fome- 
thing or other that was good In the afternoon his fro- 
lics run another way, for then be would fet the old

itiade a thoufand antic poftures and geftures ; and all tht 
■while he did this, he would he talking to him, and 
telling hip one (lory or another of his travels, and of 
•what had happened to hira abroad, to divert him. In 
fhort, if the fame filial affedlion was to be found in chrif- 
tians to their parents, in our parts of the world, one 
would be tempted to fay, there hardly would have been 
any need of the fifth commandment, 

iut this is a digreffion : I return to my landing. It 
would be endlefs to take notice of all the ceremonies and 
civilities that the Spaniards received nie with. The firft 
Spaniard, whom, as I faid, I knew very well, was he 
, / whofe life I faved ; he came towards the boat, attended 

by one more, carrying a flag of truce alfo ; and he did 
not only not know me at firft, but he had no thoughts, no 
ijotion of its beingme that was come, till I fpoke to him : 
Seignior, faid I, in rortuguefe, do you not know me ? At 
which he fpoke not a word; but giving his raufket to 
the m'^n that was with him, threw his arms abroad, and 
faying fomething in Spanifh that I did not perfedlly hear, 
came forward, and embraced me, telling me he was inex- 
cufable, not lo know that face again that he had once 
feen, as of an angel from heaven, fent to fave his life. He 
laid abundance of very handfome things, as a well-bred 
Spaniard always knows how ; and then beckoning to 
^he perfon that attended him, bade him go and call out 
his comrades. He then afked me, if I would walk to 
my old habitation, where he would give me pofleffion of 
C ' my own houfe again, and where 1 fhould fee there had 
"" .-.been but mean improvements ; fo I walked along with 
him ; but alas ! 1 could no more find the place ao-ain, 
than if I had never been there ; for they had planted fo 
many trees, and placed them in fuch a pofture, fo thick 
and clofe to one another, in ten years time .they were* 
grown fo big, that, in fhort, the place was inacceftible, 
except by fuch windings and blind ways, as they them- 
felves only who made them could find. 

I afked them, what put them upon all thefe^ fortifica- 
tions ? He told me, 1 would fay there was need enough 
of it, when they had given an account how they had 
pafTed their time fince their arriving in the ifland, efpe-

fTon^ : he told me he could not have but fome fatisfac'- 
tion in my good fortune, when he heard that I was gone 
in a good fhip, and to my fatisfa6):ion ; and that he had 
oftentimes a ilrong aerfuaVion, that one time or other he 
fhould fee me again: but nothing that ever befel him 
in his life, he laid, was fo furpriling and afilidling to him 
at firft, as the difappointment he was under when he 
came back to the ifland, and found I was not there. 

As to the three Barbarians (fo he called them) that 
were left behind, and of whom he faid,hehad a long 
ftory to tell me ; the Spaniards all thought themfelves 
much better among the favages, only that their number 
was fo fniall. And, fays he, had they been ilrong 
enough, -we had been all long ago in purgatory ; anki 
with that he crofled himfelf upon the bread. But, Sir, 
fays he, 1 hope you will not be difpleafed, when 1 ihaH 
tell you how, forced by neceffity, xVe were obliged, for our, 
own preiervation, to difarm theni, and making them oiir 
fubjedts, who would not be content with being moderately 
our mailers, but would be our murderers. I anfwered, I 
was heartily afraid of it when I left them there ; and no- 
thing troubled me at my parting from the ifland, but that 
they were not come back, thjit 1 might have put them^n 
pofleflion of every thing firll, and left the other in aftate 
of fubje<5lion, as they deferved : but if they had reduced 
them to it, I was very glad, and ihould be very far from 
finding any fault with it ; for 1 knew they were a parcei 
of refractory ungovernable villains, and were fit for any 
manner of mifchief. 

While I was faying this, came the man whom he had 
fent back, ' and with him eleven men more:: in the 
drefs they were in, it was impoffible to'guefs. what na- 
tion they w^re of^T" but he made all clear both to them 
and to me. Firft he turned to me, and pointing to them-^ 
faid, Thefe, Sir, are fome of the gentlemen who owe 
their lives to you ; and then turning to them, and point- 
ing to me, he let them know who I was ; upon which 
they all came up one by one, not as if they had been 
failors, and ordinary fellows, and 1 the Uke, but really, 
as if they had been ambaffadors or npbkmen, and | 
a monarch, or a great conqueror : their behaviour was

mixed with a manly, majeftic gravity, which very well 
became them ; and, in Aort, they had fo much more 
manners than I, that I fcarce knew how to receive their 
civilitiea, much' lefs how to return them in kind! 

The hiitory of their coming to, and condu6l in the 
ifland, after my going away, is fo remarkable, and has 
fo many incidents, which the former part of my relation 
will help to underftand, and which will, in mod of the 
particulars, refer to that account I have already given, 
that 1 cannot but commit them, with great delight, to the 
Teadihff of thofe that come after me. 

I fhall no longer trouble the ftory with a relation in 
the firft perfon, which will put me to the expence of 
ten thoufand faid I's, and faid he's, and he told me*s, 
and I told him's, and the like ; but I (hall colle6t the 
fadts hiftorically, as near as 1 can gather them out of my 
memory from what they related to me, and from what I 
met with in my converfirig with them, and with th© 
place. 

Ip order to do this fuccin(5lly, and as intelligibly as I 
can, I muft go back to the circumftanee in which I left 
the ifland, a^d which the perfons were in, of whom I 
am to fpeak. At firft it is necelTary to repeat, that I had 
fent away Friday's father and the Spaniard, the two 
whofe lives i bad refcued from the favages ; I fay, i 
had fent them a\yay iri a large canoe to the main, as I 
, then thought it, to fetch over the Spaniard's companions, 
whom he had left behind him, in order to fave them 
from the like calamity that he had been in : and in order 
to fuccour them for the prefent, and that, if poffible 
tve might together find fome Way for our deliverance 
afterward. J^ 

When 1 fent them away,' I had na viiible appearance 
of, or the leaft room to hope for, my own deliveranccj, 
any more than I had twenty years before ; much lefs had 
1 any foreknowledge of what after happened, 1 mean of 
an Lnglifli (hip coming oi^ fhore there to fetch them off, 
and it could not but be a very great furprife to them, 
when they came back, not only to .find that I was gone, 
but to find three llrangers left on the fpot, pofleflTed of 
all that I had left behind mc, which would otherwife 
have been their own*

The firft thing, however, which I enquired into, 
that I might begin where I left off, was of their own 
part : and I defired he would give me a particular ac- 
count of his voyage back to his countrymen with the 
boat, when I fent him to ifetch them over. He told 
me there was little variety in that part ; for nothing re- 
markable happened to them on the wa^, they having 
,very calm weather, and a fmooth fea ; for his coun- 
trymen, it could not be doubted, he faid, but that they 
were overjoyed to fee him : (it feeras he was the prin- 
cipal man among them, the captain -of the veffel they 
had been ihipwrecked in, having been dead fome time). 
They were, he4aid, the more furprifed to fee him, be- 
caufe they knew that he was fallen into the hands of 
favages, who, they were fatisfied, would devour him, 
as they did all the reft of their prifoners ; that when he 
told them the ftory of the deliverance, and in what 
manner he was furniihed for carrying them away, it 
was like a dream to them : and their aftonifliment, they 
faid, was fomcthing like that of Jofeph's brethren, 
when he told them who he was, and told them the 
ftory of his exaltation in Pharaoh's court : but when 
he (hewed them their arms, the powder, the ball, and 
the provifions that he brought them for their journey 
or voyage, they were reftored to themfelves, took a 
juft (hare of the joy of their deliverance, and immediately 
prepared to come away with him. 

Their firft bulinefs was to get canoes; and in this 
they were obliged not to ftick lo much upon the honei): 
part of it, but to trefpais upon their friendly favages, 
and to borrow two large canoes or periagua's on pre- 
tence of going out a filhing, or for pleafure. 

In thefe they came \ away the next nnorning; it feems 
they wanted no time to get themfelves ready, for they 
had no baggage, neither cloths, or provifions, or any 
thing in the world, but what they had on them, and a 
few roots to eat, of which they ufed to make their bres^d. 

They were in all three weeks abfent, and in that 
time, unluckily for them, I had the occaiion offered 
for my efcape, as I ij)entioned in my other part, and 
to get off frpm the ifland ; leaving three of the moft 
impudent, hardened, ungoverned, difagreeable villabs

behind me, that any rtian could deiire to mtet with, to 
the poor Spaniard's great grief and difappointmcnt, 
you may be fure. 

The only juft thing the rogues did, was, that when 
the Spaniards came on (hore, they gave my letter to 
them, an^l gave them provifions, and other relief, as I 
'had ordered them to do; alfo they gave them the long 
paper of directions, which I had left with them, con- 
taining the particular methods which! took for managing 
every part of my life there ; the way how I baked my 
bread, bred up my tame goats, and planted my corn; 
how I cured my grapes, made my pots, and, in a word, 
every thing I did ; all this being written down, they, 
^ave to the Spaniards, two of whom underflood Englifh 
Well enough ; ngr did they refufe to accommodate the 
Spaniards with any thing elfe, for they agreed very well 
for fom« time, they gave them aa equal admiffion into 
the houfe, or cave, and they began to live very fociably ; 
and the head Spaniard, who had feen pretty much of my 
•method, and Friday's father together, managed all their 
affairs ; for, as for the £,iiglifhmen, they did nothino- 
but ramble about the ifland, (hoot parrots, and catch 
tortoifes, and when they came home at night, the Spa- 
niards provided their fuppers for them. 

The Spaniards would have been fatisfied with this,- 
Would the others but have let them alone ; which, how- 
ever, they could not find in, their hearts to' do long: 
but, like the dog in the manger, they would not eat 
thetnfeives, and would not let others eat neither : the 
tlifferences, neverthelefs, were at firft but trivial, and 
luch as are not worth relating : but at iall it broke out 
into open war, and it began with ^all the rudenefs and 
infolenCe that can be imagined, without reafon, without 
provocation, contrary to nature, and indeed, to com- 
mon fenfe ; and though it is true, the firft relation of it 
came from the Spaniards themfelves, whom I may call 
the i.ccufers, yet, when 1 came to examine th^ fellows, 
they could not deny a word of it. • 

Bat before I come to the particulars of this part, I 

mud fupply a defcdl in my former relation ; and this 

^as, that I forgot to fet down among the reft, that,

happened a little quarrel on board our (hip, which I was , 
afraid once would turn to a fecond mutiny ; nor was it 
appeafed, till the captain, roufing^ up his courage, and 
taking us all to his aflidance, parted them by force, 
and making two of the moft refractory fellows prifon- 
ers, he laid them in irons ; and as they had been adtive 
in the fornix diforders, and let fall fome ugly danger- 
ous words the fecond time, he threatened to carry them 
in irons to England, and have them hanged there for 
mutiny, and running away with the fhip. 

This, it feemS, though the civ)tain did not intend to 
do it, frighted fome other men in the fhip ; and fome 
of them had put it in the heads of the rell, that the cap- 
tain only gave them good words for the prefent, till they 
fliould come to fome Englifh pott ; and that then they 
Ihould be all put into a gaol, and tried for their lives. 

The mate got intelligence of this, and acquainted us 
with it; 'upon which it was defired, that I, who flill 
pafled for a great man among them, {hould go down 
with the mate, and fatisfy the men, and tell them, that 
they might be afTured, if they behaved well the reft of 
the voyage, all they had done for the time pail, fhoukl 
be pardoned. So 1 went, and after paffing rtiy honour's 
word to them, they appeared eafy, and the more fo, 
when I caufed the two men, who were, in irons, to be 
releafed and forgiven. 

But this mutiny had brought us to an a&chor for that 
night, the wind alfo falling^ calm : next mornincr we 
found, that our two men who had been laid in irons 
had Hole each of them a mufket, and fome other wea- 
pons, (what powder or fhot they had, we knew not) 
and had taken the fhip's pinnace, which was not yet 
hauled up, and run away with her to their companions 
in roguery on (liore. 

As foon as we found this, I ordered the long-boat on 
fhore, with twelve men and the mate, and. away they 
went to feek the rogues ; but they could neither find 
them nor any of the reft ; for they all fled into the woods, 
when they faw the boat coming on fhore. I'he mate 
was once refolved, in juitice to their roguery, to haVe 
deilroyed their pkmtations, burnt all their houlhold-ftuff 
and farnituYe^ and left them to fliift without it ; but

having no order he let all alone, left every thing as 
they found it, and, bringing the pinnace away, ca;ne 
on board without them\. 

Thefe two men made their number five ; but the 
other three villains were fo much widkeder than thefe, 
that after they had been two or three days together, 
they turned their two new-comers out of doors to fhift 
for therafelves, and would have nothing to do with 
them ; nor could they for a good while be perfuaded 
to give them any food ; as for the Spaniards, they were 
not yet come. 

Vv hen the Spaniards came, firfl on ihore, the budnefs 
began to go forward ; the Spaniards would have per- 
fuaded the three Englifh brutes to have taken in their 
two couptrymen again, that, as they faid, they might 
be all one family ; but they would not hear of it : fo 
the two poor fellows lived by themfelves, and finding 
nothing but induftry and application would make them 
live comfortable, they pitched their tents on the north 
(hore of the ifland, but a little more to the weft, to be 
out of the danger xjf the favages, who ^always landed 
on the eaft parts of the ifland. 

Here they built two huts, one to lodge in, and th« 
other to lay up their magazines and ftores in ; and the 
Spaniards having given them fome corn for feed., and 
cfpecially fome of the peas which 1 had left fhem, they 
dug and planted, and iuclofed, after the pattern I had 
fet for them all, and began to live pretty well ; their firft 
crop of corn was on the ground, and though it was 
but a little bit of land which they had dug up at firft, 
having had but a little time, yet it was enough to re- 
lieve them, and find them with bread and other eatables ; 
and one of the fellows, being the cook's mate of the 
iliip, was very ready at making foup, puddings, and 
fuch otl^er preparations as the rice, and the milk, and 
fuch little flefli as they got, furniftied him to do. 

They were going on in a little thriving pofture, when 
the three unnatural rogues, their own countrymen too, 
in mere humour, and to infult them, came and bullied 
them, and told them the ifland was theirs ; that the go- 
vernor, meaning me, had given them poflTefllon of it, 
and nohody elfe had any right to it ; and damn them

they (hould build no houfes upon their ground, unlefs 
they would pay them rent for them. 

The two men thought they had jefted at firft ; and 
afked them to come and fit down, and fee what fine 
houfes they were that they had bqilt, and tell them what 
rent, they demanded : and one of them merrily told them, 
if they were ground-landlords, he hoped, if they built 
tenements upon the land, and made improvements, they 
would, according to the cullom of all landlords, grant 
them a long leafe, and bid them go fetch a fcrivener to 
draw the writings. One of the three, damning and raging, 
told them, they fhould fee they were not in a jefl; and 
going to a little place at adiflance, where the honefl men 
nad made a fire to drefs their vidluals, he takes a fire- 
brand, and clafps it to the outfide of their hut, and very 
fairly fet it on fire; ^nd it would have been all burnt 
down in a few minutes, if one of the two had not run to 
the fellow, thruft him away, and trod the fire out with 
his feet, and that not without fome difficulty too. 

The fellow was in fuch a rage at the honell man's 
thrufting him away, that he turned upon him with a pole 
he had in his hand ; and had not the man avoided the 
blow very nimbly, and run into the hut, he had ended 
his days at once. His comrade, feeing the danger they 
were both in, ran in after him, and immediately they 
came both out with their mufquets ; aad the man that 
was firft ftruck at with the pole, knocked the fellow 
down, who began the quarrel, with the (lock of their 
mufquet, and that before the other two could come to 
help him ; and then feeing the reft come at them, they 
flood together, and prefenting the other ends of their 
pieces to them, bade them ftand off. 

The other had fire-arms with them too ; but one of 
the two honeft men, bolder than his comrade, and made 
defperate by his danger, told them, if they offered to 
move hand or foo^, they .were a]), dead men ; and boldly 
commanded them to lay down their arms. They did 
not indeed lay down their arms ; but, feeing him re- 
folute, it brought them to a parley, and they confented 
to take their wounded man with them, and be gone ; 
and indeed, it feems the fellow was wounded fufficiently 
with the blow ; however, they were much in the 



43 ADVENTURES OP ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

"wrong, fmce they had the advantage, that they did not 
difarm them effe^ually, as they might have done, and 
have gone immediately to the Spaniards, and given them 
an account how the rogues had treated theni ; for the 
three villains itudied nothing: but revenue, and every 
day gave them Ibme intimation that they did fo. 

But not to croud this part with an, account of the lef- 
fer part of their rogueries, I'uch as treading down their 
corn, {hooting three young kids, and a (he-goat, which 
the poor men had got to breed up tame for theFr'flore; 
and, in a word, plaguing them nighr and day in this 
manner, it forced the two men to fuch a defperation, 
that they refolved to fight them all three the firft time 
they had a fair opportunity. In order to this they re- 
folved to go to the caftle, as they called it, that Was my 
old dwelling, where the three rogues and the Spaniards 
all lived together at that time, intending to have a fair 
battle, and the Spaniards fhould Hand by to fee fair 
play. So they got up in the morning before day, and 
came to the place, and called the Engliftimen by their 
name's, telling a Spaniard that anfwered, that they 
TVanted to fp^ak with them. 

It happened that the day before two of the Spaniards, 
having been in the woodfe, ^had feen one of the two 
Englithmen, whom, for diftindion, I call the honeft men, 
sjnd he had made a fad complaint to the Spaniards, of 
the barbarous ufage they had met with from their three 
countrymen, and how they had ruined their plantation, 
and deftroyed their corn, that they had laboured fo hard 
to bring forward, and killed the milch-goat, and their 
three kids, which was all they had provided for their 
fuilenancc; and-thAt if he and his friends, meaning 
the Spaniards, did not affift them again, they fhould be 
ftarved. When the Spaniards came home at night, and 
they were all at fupper, he took the freedom to reprove 
the three Englilhmen, though in gentle and mannerly 
terms, and afked them, how they could be fo cruel, they 
being harmlefs inoffenilve fellows, and that they were 
putting themfelves in a way to fubfill by their labour, 
and that it had coil them a great deal of pains to bring 
things to fuch perfedion as they had. 

Our

One of the Englifhmen returned -very briflsly. What 
had they to do there ? That they came on fliore without 
leave, and that they fliould not plant or build upon the 
iflancj ; it was none of their ground. Why, fays the 
Spaniard, very calmly. Seignior Inglefe, they mull not 
ftar\'e. The Engliihman replied, like a true rough-hewn 
tarpaulin, they might ftarve and be damn'd, they (hould 
not plant nor build in that place. But what mud they 
do then. Seignior, fays the Spaniard? Another of the 
brutes returned, do! d — n them, they ihould be fervants, 
and work for theml But how can you expect that of 
them? They are not bought with you^" money; you 
have no right to make them fervants. The fcngUihmea 
anfwered, the ifland was theirs, the Gos'ernor had given 
it to them, ^nd no man had any thing to do there but 
themfelves ; and with that fwore by his Maker, that he 
would go and burn all their new huts ; they Ihould 
build none upon their land. 

Why, Seignor, fays the Spaniard, by the fame rule. 
We muil be your fervants too. Ay, fays the bold dog, 
and fo you fhall too, before we have done with you, 
mixing two or three G*— d d — mme's in the proper in- 
tervals of his fpeech. The Spaniard only fmiled at 
that, and made him no ahfwer. However this little dif- 
courfe had heated them ; and darting up, one fays to the 
other, I think it was he they called Will Atkins, come 
Jack, let us go atid have the Other brufti with them : 
we will demolifli their caftle, I will Warrant you ; they 
Ihall plant no colony in our doininions. 

Upon this they were all troopiilg away, with every' 
man a guii, a piftol, and a fword, and muttered fome 
indolent things among themfelves of what they would 
do to the Spaniards too, when opportunity offered ; but 
the Spaniards, it feems, did not fo perfectly underiland 
them as to know all the particulars ; only, that, in ge- 
neral, they threatened' them hard for taking the two 
Englifhmen's part. 

Whither they went, or how they beftowed their time 
that evening, the Spaiiiards faid, they did not know ; 
but it feemed they wandered about the country, part of ' 
the night ; and then lying down in the place which I 
ufed to call my bower, they were weary, and overllept

themfelves. The cafe was this : they had rcfolved to 
ftay till midnight, and fo take the poor men when they 
were alleep ; and they acknowledged it afterwards, in- 
tending to fet fire to the huts while they were in them 
and either burn them in them, of murder them as they 
came out ; and as malice feldom lleeps very found, it 
was very llrange they would not have been kept waking. 

However, as the two men had alfo a defign upon 
them, as I have faid, though a much fairer one than that 
of burning and murdering, it happened, and very luckily 
for them all, that they were up and gone abroad, before 
the bloody-minded rogues came to their huts. 

When .they came thither and found the men gone, 
Atkins, who it feems was the forwarded man, called out 
to his Comrades, ha, JackJ here's the neft I but d — n 
them, the birds are flown ! They mufed awhile to think 
what fhould be the occafion of their being gone abroad 
fo foon, and fuggefted prefently, that the Spaniards had 
given them notice of it ; and with that they (hook 
hands, and fwore to one another that they would be 
revenged of the Spaniards. As foon as they had made 
this bloody bargain, they fell to work with the poor 
men's habitation; they didinot fet fire indeed to any 
thing, but they pulled down bot\i their houfes, and pul- 
led them fo limb from limb, that they left not the leaft 
flick Handing, or fcarce any figii on the ground where 
they Hood ; they tore all their little colle(5ied houfehold- 
lluff in piejCes, and threw every thing about in fuch a 
manner, that the poor men found, afterwards, fome of 
their things a mile off from their habitation. 

When they had done this, they pulled up all the young 
trees which the poor men had planted ; pulled up the 
inclofu're they had made to fecure their cattle and their 
corn ; and, in a "word, facked and plundered every thing 
as completely as a herd of I'artars would have done. 

The two men were at this jundture gone to find thera 
out, 6nd had refolved to fight them wherever they had been, 
though they were but two to three : 16 that, had they 
met, there certainly 'would have been bloodlhed among 
them ; for they were all very ilout, refolute fellows to 
give them their due. . ' 

But providence took more care to keep them afunder 

than

they themfelvcs could do to meet ; for as they 

ad dodged one another, when the three were gone 

i^ither, the two were here; and afterwards, when the 

p went back to find them, the three were come to' the 

a habitation again: we (haimee their different con- 

prefently. When the three dlime back, like furious 

atures, flufhed with the rage which the work they - 

id be^n about put them into, they came up to the 

paniards, and told them what they had done, by way 

feoff and bravado ; and one of them.flepping up to 

c of the Spaniards, as if they had been a couple of 

ys at play, takes hold of his hat, as it was upon his 

ad, and giving it a twirl about, fleering in his face, 

ys he to him— And you Seignior Jack Spaniard, fhall 

ve the farae fauce, if you do not mend your manners. 

e Spaniard, who, though quite a civil man, was a^ 

' bjrave as a man could defire to b^, and withal a i^rong 

vwell-made man, looked fteadily at him for a good 

* while; and then, having no weapon in his hand, ftepped 

. , 'gravely up to him, and with one blow of his fid, knock- 

'}^id him down, as an ox is felled with a pole-ax, at which 

^Jlofie of the rogues, infolcnt as the firft, fired his piftol at 

^■- llhe Spaniard immediately ; he miffed his body indeed, 

s'Ifor the bullets went through his hair, but one of them 

^touched the tip of his ear, and he bled pretty much. 

^'^he blood made the Spaniard believe he was more hurt 

J than he really was, and that put him into fome heat, 

X^OT before he atSled all in a pertedl calm; but now re- 

i 'Solving to go through with his work, he Hooped and 

took the feliow*s mufquet whom he had knocked down, 

\ and was juil going to flioot the man who had fired at 

him, when the reft of the Spaniards, being in the cave, 

came out, and calling him not to ihoot, they ftepped in, 

Secured the other two, and took their arms from them. 

r When they were thus difarmed, and found they had 

iinade all the Spaniards their enemies, as well as their 

own countrymen, they began to cool; and giving the 

'Spaniards better words, would have had their arms 

again ; but the Spaniards confidering the feud that was 

between them and the other two Englilhmen, and that 

it would be the beft method they could take to keep 

them from obc another, told them ihey viouXd ^o \^5\'e.^Kv

no harm; and if they would live peaceably they would 
be very willing to affift and aflbciate with them, as they 
did before ; but that they could not think of giving them 
their arms again, while they appeared fo relolved to do 
mifchief with them to their own countrymen, and had 
even threatened them all to make them their fervant's. 

The rogues were now more capable to hear reafon 
than to aft reafon ; but being refufed their arms, they 
went raving away, a»d raging like madmen, threaten- 
ing what they would do, though they had no fire-arms : 
but the fpaniards, defpifing their threatening, told thera 
they fhould take care how they offered any injury to tbtir 
plantation or cattle; for if they did, they would {hoot 
them, as they would do ravenous beafts, wherever 
they found them ; and if they fell into* their hands 
alive, they would certainly be hanged. However this 
was far from cooling them; but away they went, fwear* 
ing and raging like furies of hell. As foon as they 
were gone, came back the two men in pallion-and rage 
enough alfo, though of another kind; for having been 
at their plantation, and finding it all dcmolifhed and de- 
ftroyed, as above, it will eafily be fuppofed they had 
provocation enough : they could fcarce have room to 
tell the tale, the Spaniards were fo eager to tell them 
theirs,; and it was ftrange enough to find, that three 
men fliould thus bully nineteen, and receive no punifh- 
ment at all. 

The Spaniards indeed defpifed^ them, and efpecially 
having thus difarmed them^ made light of their threat- 
eninojs ; but the two Englifhmen refolved to have theii 
remedy agai nil them, what pains foever it cofl to find 
them out. 

But the Spanirds interpofed here too, and told thera. 
that they were already difarnied ; they could not confeni 
that they (the two) ihould purfue them with fire-arms, 
and perhaps kill them; but, faid the grave Spaniard 
who was their Governor, we will endeavour to mak< 
them do you juftice, if you will Uave it tp us; for, ai 
there is no doubt but they will come, to us again wh^i 
their paflion is over, being not ^ble to fubfill withoi* 
our affiilance, we promifc you to make no peace wi<l 
tbcm, without having a JuVV tilVsife^QT^ n'^qx ^^^j^v aw 



A.DVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 47 

Upon this condition we hope you will promifc to ufe no 
violence with them, other than in your defence. 

The two Englilhmen yielded to this very aukwardly, 
and with great relui^ance ; but the Spaniards protefted 
they did it only to keep them from bloodshed, and to 
make all eafy at lall ; for, laid they, we are not fo many 
of us, here is room enough for us all, and it is a great pity 
we fhould not be all good friends. At leng^th they did 
confent, and waited for the, ilTue of the thing,' living for 
fome days with the Spaniards, for their own habitation 
was deftroyed. ' . 

In about five days after the three ;iragrants, tired 
with wandering, and almoft ftarved with hunger, having 
chiefly lived on turtles' eggs all that while, came back 
to the grove ,; and finding my Spaniard, who, as 1 have 
faid, was the governor, and two more with him, 
walking by the fide of the creek, they came up in a very 
fubmiflive humble manner, and begged to be received 
a[,ain into the family. The Spaniards ufed them 
civilly, but told them, they had adled fo unnaturally by 
their countrymen j and fo very grofsly by them, (the 
Spaniards), that they could not come to any concla- 
iion without confulting the two Englifhraen, and the 
reft; but, however, they would go to them, and dif- 
courfe about it, and they fhould^know in half an hour. 
It may be gueflcd, that they were very hard put to it ; 
for it feems, as they were to wait this half hour for an 
anfwer, they begged he would fend them out fome bread 
in the mean, time ; which he did, and fent them at the 
fame time a large piece of goat's flefli, and a broiled 
parrot; which they ate very heartily, for they were 
hungry enough. 

. After half an hour's confultation they were called in, 
and a long debcate had about them, their two countr}^- 
men charging them with the ruin of all their labour, 
.and a defign to murder, them ; all which they owned 
before, and therefore could not deny now ; upon the 
whole, the Spaniards a6led the moderators between 
them ; and as they had obliged the two Engliflimen not ' 
to hurt the three, whde they were naked and unarmed, 
fo they now obliged the three to go and rebuild their 
idlows two huts^ one to be of the lame dimenfions. 



48 ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

and the other larger than they were before ; alfo to fence 
their ground again, where they had pulled up the fences, 
plant trees in the room of thofe pulled up, dig up the 
land again for planting corn, where they had fpoilcd it; 
and, in a wo,rd, to reflore every thing in the fame ftatc 
as they found it, as near as they could ; for entirely it 
could not be, t]>c feafon for the corn, and the growth of 
the trees and hedges, not being poffible to be recovered. 

Well, they all fubmitted to this ; and as they had 
plenty of proviiions given them all the while, they 
grew very orderly, and the whole fociety began to live 
pleafantly and agreeably together again ; only that thefc 
three fellows could never be perfuaded to work ; I mean 
not for thefmfelvesj except now and then a little, juft as 
they pleafed : however, the Spaniards told them plainly, 
that if they would but live fociably and friendly together, 
and ftudy in the whole the good of the plantation, they 
would be content to work for them, and let them walk 
about and be as idle as they pleafed ; and thus having 
lived pretty well together for a month or two, the Spa- 
niards gave them their arms again, and gave them liberty 
to go abroad with them as before. 

It was not above a week after they had thefc arms, 
and went abroad, but the ungrateful creatures began to 
be as infolent and troublefome as before ; but, however, 
an accident happened prefently upon this, which en- 
dangered the fafety of them all; they were obliged to 
lay by all private refcntments, and look to the preferva- 
tion of their lives. 

It happened one night; that the Spaniard governor, 
as I call him, that is to fay, the Spaniard whofe life I 
had laved, who was now the captain, or leader, or 
governor of the reft, found himfelf very uneafy in the 
night, and could by no means get any fleep : he was 
perfectly well in body, as he told me '^thc ftory, only 
found his thoughts tumultuous ; his mind ran upon men 
lighting, and killing one another, but was broad awake^ 
and could not by any means get any fleep ; in ihort, 
he lay a great while ; but growing more and more 
uneafy, he refolved to rife : as they lay, being fo many 
of them, upon goat {kins, laid thick upon fuch couches 
and pads as they made for themfelves^ and not in ham- 
mocks

ttiocks and (hip-beds, as 1 did, wlro was but one ; (o 
they had little to do, when they were willing to rife, bat 
to get up on their feet, and perhaps pu|.^on a coat> 
fbch as it was, and their pumps, and they w^p ready for 
going any way that their thoucrhts guided them. 

Beinor thus gotten up, ht looked out ; but, being dark> 
he Gould fee little or nothing ; and befldes, the treeif 
which I had -planted, as in rtiy fotmer account is de- 
fcribed, and which were i\pw grown tall, intercepted his 
fight, fo that he could only look up, and fee that it was 
a clear ftar-liglit ftight^ afid, hearing no noif^, he re- 
turned and laid hbn'*doWn again ; but it was all one, he 
could not ileep, nor cpuld he compofe himfelf to any 
thing like reft, but his thoughts were to the laft degree 
uneafy, and yet he knew not for what. 

Having made fomc noife with rifing and walking 
ahout, going out and coming in, another of them waked, 
aind, calling, a(ked wlio it was that was up ? The go- 
vernor told him how it had been with him. Say you 
fo ? fays the other Spaniard ^ fuch things are not to be 
flighted, I aiTure you ; there is -Certamly fome mifchief 
working, fays he, near us ; and prefently he afked him. 
Where are the Engliihmen ? The arc all in their huts> 
fays he, fafc enough. It feems, the Spaniards had kept 
poffcffion of the main apartment, and had made a place, 
where the thtee Etiglilhmen, iince their laft mutiny, al* 
"ways quartered by themfclves, and could not come at the 
Jtft. Well, fays the Spaniard^ there is fomething in it> 
I am perfuaded from my owtt experience ; 1 am fatisfied 
our fpirits embodied have converfe with, and receive in* 
telligence from, the fpirits unembodied, and inhabiting 
the invifible world:; arid this. friendly notice is given for 
our advantage, if we know how to make ule of it.

we find nothing at all in it to juftify our trouble, 1*11 tell 
you a ftbry to the purpofe, that fhali convince you of

In a word, they went out to go to the top of the 
hill, where I ufed to go ; but they, being ftrong, and in 
good ^company, nor alone, as I was, ufed none of my 
cautions to go up by the latter, and then pulling it 
up after them, to go up a fecond ftagc to the tpp, hut

were going round tHrfegh the grove unconcerned and 
unwary, when theywfeTre furprifed with feeing a light, 
as of a fire, a very little way off from them, and hearing 
the voices 9f men, riot of one, -or two, but of ^ great 
^number. 

In all the difcoveries I had made of the favages land*- 
ang on the ifland, it was my 'connant care to prevent 
ihem making the leall difcovery of their being any in- 
liabitant upon the place; and when by any neceffity 
^hey came to know h, they felt it fo effedually, that 
they who got away were fcarce able to give any account 
of it, for we difappeafcd as foon as^ poflible, nor did 
ever any that had fcen me, efcape t<Miell any one elfe, 
except it were th^ three favages in ,o«r lafl encounter, 
"who jumped into the boat, of whom 1 mentioned, 
that I was afraid they ihould go home, and brin^ more 
lieln. 

Whether it was in conTequeDce of the efcape of thofe 
men, that fo great a number came now together ; or 
"whether they came ignprantly and by accident on their 
ufual bloody errand, the Spqaiards could not, it feems, 
"underftand: but whatever it was, it had been their 
bufincfs either to have concealed themfelves, and not 
have feenthem at all ; much Icfs to have let the favages 
have feen,, that there were ajiy mhabitants in the place; 
fbut to have fallen upon them fo effe(5lually, as that not a 
man of them fhoiild have efcaj)ed, which could only 
have been by getting in between them aaid their 
"toats ; but this prefence of mind was wanting to them, 
-which was the ruin of their tranquillity for a great 
while. 

We need not doubt, but that the goyernor, and the 
man with him, furprifed with this light, ran back imme- 
diately, and raifed their fellows, giving them an account 
of the imminent danger they were all in ; and tjiey again 
.as readily took the alarm, but it was impoflible to per- 
suade them to Hay clofe within where they were, but 
4hat they mud all runout to fee how things ftood. 

While it was dark, indeed, they were well, enough, 

and they had opportunity enough for fome hours to 

view them by the light of three fires they had made

doing they knew not, and what to do thcmlelvcs they 
knew not ; for, firft, the enemy were too many ; att»^ 
fccondly, they did not keep together, but were divided 
into feveral parties, and Were on (hore ih 'civeral places. 

The Spaniards were in no fihill'cdtiRernation at thft 

'fight ; and, as they found that thfefctloWs ran draggling 

all over the fhore, they made no ilbtibt but, firft or laft, 

fomc of them would chop in •b[ibn their habitation, or 

•upon fame other place, where*they could fee the tokens 

of inhabitants ; and*'they Were in great perplexity alfo 

for fear of thfcir flock 'df^oats, which would have bel^n 

little lefs than llarving them, ifchey (hould have been 

deftroyed ; fo the firft thing they refolved upon, was to 

difpatch three men aWay before it was light, Viz. two 

Spaniards and one Elngliihman, to drive ftll the goats 

away to the great valley where the cave Ivas, and, if need 

were, to drive them into the very cave itfelf. 

Could they have feen the favages altogether in ohe 
body, and at a diftance from their calnoes, they refdlved, 
if there had been an hundred of 'them, to have attacked 
them ; but that could not be obtained, for, they were 
Tome of them two miles off from thfe other, and, 
as it appeared afterwards, Wcfe of two different 
^nations. 

After having tnufed a g#eat while on th'e'courfe they 
^ihoald take, and beaten their brains in confide ring their 
JprefentcircumftancCs,' they refolved at la(^ while it was 
dark, to fend 4he old favage (Friday's father) out as a 
•Ipy, to learn, if pofllible, fomething ^concerning them^ 
as what they 'eame for, atid.what they intended' to 
'do, and the like-2 the old itian readily undertook it, 
and, Gripping himfelf quite naked, as moil of the 
favagcis were, tiway he went. After he liad been gone 
an hour ' cJr two, he brings word, that he had been 
among them undifcovered, that he fotrml they were 
'two parties, and of two feveral nations, who harf war 
with one another, and had had a great battle in their 
'own country, and .that both fides having hail feveral 
prifoners taKen' JA the fight, they were by mere chance

that they were in a great rage at one another, and were 
fo near, that he believed they would fight again, as foon 
as day -light began to api>ear ; but he did not perceive 
that they had no notion of any body's being on the 
ifland but theraielves. He had l^ardly made an end of 
telling the flory, when they could perceive, by the un- 
tifual noife they made, that the two little armies were 
engaged in a bloody fight. 

Friday's father ufed all the argutpents he could to per- 
fiiade our people to lie clofe, and not be feen : he told 
♦hem their fafety contifted in it, and that they had 
nothing: to do but to lie flill, and the favages would kill 
one another to their hands, and the reft would go away ; 
and Lt was fo to a tittle. But it was impoffible to pre- 
vail, efpecially upon the Engliihmen ; their curiofitjr 
•was fo importunate upon their prudentials, that they 
muft run out and fee the battle : however, they ufed 
fome caution, viz. they did not go openly, juft by their 
own dwelling;,) but went farther into the woo(^s, and 
placed themldves to advantage, where they might fe- 
curelj fee them manage -the fight, and, as they thought, 
not to be feen by thjpm ; but, it feems, the favages did 
fee' them, as we fhall find hereafter. 

The battle was very fierce, and, if I might believe the 
EngUihmcn, one of them faid, he could perceive that 
fome of them were men of great bravery, of invincible 
ipirits, and of great policy in guiding the fight. 
The feattle, they faid, held two hours, before they 
-could gucis which party would be beaten ; but then 
that party which was neareft our people's habitation, 
began to appear weake(l> and after fome 'time more, 
fome of the ra,began to fly ; and this put our men again 
into a great confterQation, left any of thofe that fled 
ihouM run into the grove, before their dwelling, for 
ihelter, and therd:>y involuntarily difcover the place ; 
and that by confexjuence the purfuers fliould do the 
like m feardi for them. Upon this they refolved, that 
they would ftand armed within the wall, and whoever 
came into the grove, theyihould fally out over the 
wail, and kill them ; fo that, if poflible, not one fliould 
return to give an account of it ; they ordered alCo, that 
it ihould be douc with their fwords, or by knocking

111 em down with the ftock of the mufket, not by (hoot-- 
ing them, for fear of railing an alarm by the noife. 

As they expedtec}, it fell out ; three of the routed 
army fled for lite, and eroding the Creek, ran di redly 
into the place, not in the leaft knowing whither they 
•went, but running as into a thick wood for (helrer : the 
fcout they kept to look abroad, gave notice of this" 
within, with this addition, to our men*s great fatif-^ 
fa6i:ion,viz. That the conquerors had not purfued them^ 
or feen which way they \Yere gone. Upon this, the^ 
Spaniard Gm'ernor, a man of hunianity, would not fuf- 
fer them to kill the three fugitives ; but, fending out three- 
men hy the top of the hill, ordered them to go rpund^ 
and come in behind them, furprife and take ih&d pri-. 
foners, which was done ; the refidue of the conquer^dr 
people fled to their canoes, and got off to fea ; the vic-^ 
tors retired, and madt no purfuit, or very little ; but,- - 
drawing them fclves into a body together, ga^e two great 
fcrcaraing ihouts, whicn they fuppoied were byway o£^ 
triumph, and fo the fight ended ; and the fame day^ 
about three o*clock in the atternoon, they alfo marched' 
to their canoes, and thus the Spaniards had their ifland 
again free to themfelves, their frighrt was over, and they 
faw no ravages in feveral years afterwards. 

After they were all gone, the Sj/aniards came out oF 
their den; and, viewing the lield of battle, they found 
about two-and-tbirty dead men upon the fpot ; fome 
were killed with great long arrows, feveral of which 
were found fl:icking in their bodies ; but moft ofi 
them were killed with, their great wooden fwords, (ixteeiv 
or feventeen of which they found in the field of battle, 
and as many bows, with a great many arrows ; thefe 
fwords were great unweildy things, and they muit be 
very ftrong men that ufed them ; moft of thofe men that 
were killed with them, had their heads malhed to pieces, 
as we may fay, or, as we call it in Engli^ j their brains- 
knocked out, and feveral of their arms and legs broken ; 
fo that it is evident they fight with infexpreffible rage ^nd^ 
fury ; they found not one wounded man that was-hot^ 
ftone dead ; for either they Hay by their eneiriy lill they 
have quite- kiUed them, or they carry all the wounded' 
ioen^ that are not quite dead^ away with them. 



5^' ▲DVSMT.UR^ OF ROBINSON CRV^O^* 

Thi* deJiveranoe tamed our Engliihmen for a great 
, -while : the fight had filled them with horror, and the 
confequence appeared terrible to the lail degree, cfpeci- 
ally upon fuppoiing thatfome time or other theyihould 
fall into the hands of thofe creatures ; who< would not 
only kill- them as enemies, but'kill them fpvfoodas we 
kill, our cattle. And they profefTed to mc> that tho 
thoughts of being eaten up Uke beef or mutton, though 
it was fuppofed it was not to be till they were dead, had 
fomethihg in it fo horrible, that it; naufeated their very, 
i^oraachsj.made them iick wh^n they thought.of it, and 
filled their minds with unufual terror, that they were. not. 
t{\emfelves for fome weeks after. 

This, as 1 faid, tamed even,thc three Englifli brutes I 
have been fpeaking of; and for a greet while after- they 
were very tractable, and went about the comn^on bufi-* 
nefsoftbe whole fociety well enough ; planted, (owed,, 
reaped, and began to be all naturalized to the country ^ 
but fome time after this, they fell all into fuch fimple 
meafures again, as brought them ipto a great deaji of 
trouble. . 

Thqr had taken three prifoners, aft I had obfenrcdl; 
and thefe three being lufty ftout young fellows, they made 
them fervants, and taught them to work for them, and, 
as flay^s th(?y did well cnp.ugh ; but. they did not. take- 
their meafures with them aa 1 di^l by my man, Friday, 
viz. to liegin with thenrv. upon the principle of having^ 
faved their lives, and then indrudied them in the rational 
principles of life,^ much lefs of religion, civilizing^ and 
reducing them by. kind ufage, and aifediioi^ate acguings \^ 
but as they gave them. their, fpod ^vcry day, fo they 
gave them tfeeif worjc too,.^and kepttthcm fully employed^ 
in drudgery enough ; but they failed in this by it, that; 
they nevejTf had thtm to afiift them and fight\for them, as .

liefh upoo my bones.. 

But to come to the family part; being all pow good 
fiends (for common danger,, as. I faid above, had ef-« 
fedually reconciled them,) they began to conlider their 
general circumfiances ; and the fini thing that came 
under their confideration was, whether feeing the 
^ya^es partiQularly hi^u|>t^.thaj;., fidc^ of th,c ifland„ 







ADVBKTtniES OF ROBINSON CUtSO?. 88 

iind[ tb at there were more remote and retired parts of it 
equally adapted to their way of^living, and manifefily tO' 
fbeir advantage, they ihould not rather remove their ha^ 
Imitation, and plant in fome more pro|)er place for their 
fafety^ and especially for the fecurity of their cattle and^ 
com. 

Upon this, after long debate, it was conceived, that 
they (hould not remove their habitation ; becaufe that 
fome time or other jtey thought they might hear from' 
their governor again, meaning me : and if 1 jfhould fend' 
any one X-o feek tbeni, I would be fure to diredi them on' 
tbat (ide, where, if they fhouldiind the place demolifhed,- 
they would conclude the favages had killed us all, and 
yit were gone, and lb our fupply would go away too. 

But as to their corn and cattle, they agreed to remove 
them into the vanley where my cave was, where thp 
land was as proper to bi)th, and where indeed there was^ 
laodenough ; howcvc-, upon fecond thoughts, they al- 
tered one part of that refolution to, and refolved only 
to remove part of their cattle thither, and plant part of 
Aeir com there ; and fb if one part was deitrv)yed, the' 
<ydier might be faved : and one piece of prudence they 
ufcd, which it was very well they did, viz. That they 
sever trufted thefe three favages, which they had taken 
prifoners, with knowing any thing of the plantation fhey 
bad made in that valley, or of any cattle they had there ; 
muchlefs of the cave there, which they kept in cafe of 
neceflity, as a fa^l retreat; and thither they carried alfo 
the two barrels c^^powder, which- 1 had left them at my 
coming away. 

But, however^ they refolved not to change their ha- 
bitation ; yet they agreed, that as I had carefully co- 
vered itfirft with a wall or fortification, and then with 
a grove of trees; fo, feeing their fafety coniifted en- 
tirely in their being concealed, of whioh they were now 
fully convinced, they fet to work to cover and conceal 
the place yet more effeftually than before : to this piir- 
pofe^ a^ had planted trees, (or rather thrull in flakes, 
which in time all grew ,to be trees) for fofne good 
diftance before the entrance into my apartment, they 
went/ on in the fame manner^ and filled up the red of 
tiutt. whole fftace pf ground, from the trees I bad fet,

quite down to the iidc of (he crceki where, as 1 faid, f 
landed my floats, and' even in the very ouzc whcrfe 
the tide flawed, not fo much as leaving any place to 
land, or any fign that there had been any landing 
thereaboHt* ;• thefc ftakes alfo, being of a wood veiy 
forward to grow, a^ I have noted formerly, they took 
care to have generally very much larger and taller than 
thofe which 1 had planted, and placed them fo very thick 
^nd clofe, that when they had been three or four years 
grown, there was no piercing with the eye any 'confide- 
rable way into the plantation ; as for that part which* I 
liad planted, the trees were grown as thick as a man's 
thigh ; and among them they placed fp many other fhort 
ones, and fo thick, that, iq a word, it ftood like a pali- 
fado a quarter of a mile thick, and it was next to im- 
poflible to penetrate* it, but with a little army, to cut i 
all down ; f r a little dog could hardly get between the 
trees, they flood fo clofe. 

But this was not all ;• for they did the fame by all the 
ground to the right h#nd, and to- the left, and round 
even to the top of the hill ; leaving no way, not fo 
much as for themfelves to come out, but oy the ladder 
placed up to the f>de of the hill, and then liAed up^ 
and placed again from the firfl flage up to the top; 
which ladder, when it wa» taken down*, nothing But 
what had wings of witchcraft to aflid it could come at 
them. 

This was excellently well contrived'^ nor was it lefs 
than what they afterwards ' found oc'c^on for ; which 
ferved to convince me, that as human prudence has the 
authority of Providence to juftify it, fo it has, doybtlefs, 
the direction of Providence to fet it to wbrk ; and, would 
wc liftcn carefully to the voke of it, I am fully per- 
fuaded we might prevent many of the difafters which 
our lives are now by ouc own negligence fubjedled to» 
But this by the way. , 

I return to the ftory :- ^ey lived two years after this 
in perfed^ retirement, and had no more viiits'f^om the 
favages; they had indeed, an alarm given them one 
morning, which put them in a great confternation ;.

Aeway^ was that end where I never wei^t, for fear of 
"being difcovered, they were furprifed with feeing above 
twenty canoesof Indians jufl coming on (hore. 

They made the heft of their way honie» in hurry 
enough J and giving the alarm to their comrades, they 
kept cliofe all that day and the next, going out only at 
night, to make obft-rvation ;, but they had the good luck 
to be miftaken ; for "vvherever the favages went, they did 
not land at that time in the ifland, but purfued forae oth^ 
defign. 

And now they had another broil with tHe three Eng-- 
Fiflimen ; one of which,, a moft turbulent fellow, being ia 
a rage. at one of the three flavesy which 1 mentioned they^ 
had tak«n, bccaufe the fellow had not done fomething. 
right which he bid him do, and fcemed a little untrac- 
table in his ihewing him, drew a hatchet out of a frog-, 
belt, in which he wore it by his fide, and Ml upon thc^ 
poorfavage, not tocorreft him, but to kill him*. 

One of the Spaniards, who was by, feeing him give 
the fellow a baivbarous cut witkthe hatchet, which he 
aimed at his head, but flruck into his (houlder, fo that he 
thought he had cut the poor creature's arm off, raa 
to him, and intreatingbim not to murder the poor man,, 
elapt in between him and the favage, to prevent the- 
mifchief. ^ 

The fellow,, being enraged the more at this, flruck 
at the Spaniard with his hatchet, and fwore he would 
ferve him. as he intended to ferve the favage ; which the 
Spaniard perceiving, avoided the blow, and with a 
ihovel, which he had in his hand (for they were work-' 
ing in the field about the corn-land) knocked the brute, 
down: Another of the Englifhnien, running at the 
iame time to help his comrade,, knocked the Spaniard^ 
down ; and then two Spaniards more came to help their^ 
man, and a third Englilhman fell upon them. Theyr 
had none of them any fire-arms, or any other weapons but 
hatchets and other tools, except the third Engliftiman ;, 
he had one of my old rufty cutlafles, with whicK he 
made at the lafl Spaniard^J, and wounded them both,.

chievous to tlfe laft degree, and valued not what hurt they 
did any man,; , fo thiat, ixk Ihort, it was notfafe to live

The Spaniard who was goveijnorj teld them in fo many

would have hang^d.them all ; for all laws, and all govern** 
ors, were. to prefervc fociety ; and thofe who were dan- 
gerous to fociety, ought to be expelled out of it ; but as 
ithey were Englifhmen, and that it was -to the generous 
kindncfs^^ an^ Englifhman that they all o«Ked their pre* 
fervation and deliverance, he would uie them with all 
poffible lenity, and would leave them to the judgment of 
the other two Engliihmen, who were their countrymen.

they defired it might not be left to them ; for, fays he, , 
Ijam fure we ought^to fentence them to the gallows; and. 
with that gives an account how Will Atkins, one of the 
three, had propofed to have all the five ^Engliihmcn join > 
together, ^nd murder all the Spaniards, .w4ien th«y were.; 
in their fleep;' 

When the Spanifli GovcrBon heard this^ he calls tO/ 
Will Atkins : Hov/, Seignior Atkins, fays he, will you : 
murder us all ?- What have you to fay to that ? 1 hat - 
hardened villain was fo far frdm denying it, that he faid

killing us? And what muft we do to prevent . your .

iKid done i% for the poor favage was in fuch a miferable 
condition, with the wound he had reot^ved^r that it was-

But the governor Spaniard ftill faid;- Noj it was aa-^

never confent to put an Engliihthan to death, though he-' 
had murdered half of them; nay, he faid, if he had

This -was fo poiitively inlifted on by the governor Spa* -

councild are- moll apt to prevail where ^ they arc fo ear- 
neftly prcflcdi- fo they all came into it ^ but ^ then it was 
to be confidered, what ihould be done.to keep them from

all, that means- were to be Hied for preferving the fo*- 
cfety from- danger. After a long debate* it was agreed, 
ftrff, Thattthfey ihould be difarmed, and not permitted • 
to have eitbep gun, or powtler, or ihot, orfword,. or any 
weapon, and (hould 'betorncd out of the fociety, and 
left to live where they would j and how they could, by 
themfelves; but that -none of the reft,- either Spaniarda 
or-Eli^liih, fliouM convcrfe with them, fpeak with them, 
or have any thing to do with them ; that they flionld be 
forbid to comenvrthin a certain diilance of the place 
where the refl dwelt ; and that if they offered to com- 
mit any diforder, fo as to fpoi4, bbm, kill, or deftroy any 
of the corn,^ pkmttng,^ buildings, fences^ or cattle belong- 
iag to the fociety, riiat they ihould die* without, mercy, 
anu would ihoot'them- wherever they could find them. 

The governor, a rh an of great bumanityyintiiing up- 
on the ientenee,' coniidered a little uponrit ; ^nd, turn- •

r<Se6fc, that it will be long ere they can raife corn and 
cattle of their own, and they mijlV not llarve;' we mud 
therefore allow them provilions. So he caufed to be 
added, that they ihonld have a pToportion of corn givea

fiftencc, as for a ftore ; and that* they ihould have tools 
given them for their- work in the nekl ; fuch as, fix 
hatchets, an axe, afaw; and the like:- But they ihoukl 
have /none of their toolsi or. provifions, unlefs they would' 
fwear folemnly, that they would not hurt or injure any of 
the Spaniards with them, or of their fellow £ngU(hmen« 

Thus they difmifled them the fociety, and turned' 
them out to (hift for themfelves* They went away 
lullen and refradlory, as> neither contented to go away, 
or to ftay ; hut, as there was- no remedy, they went pre-* 
tending to go and chufc a place where they fhouhl fet- 
tle themfelvcs, to phint and live by themfelves;.and 
fome prov^on were given, but no weapons. . 

About four or five,' 4ays- after, they came agaiii for/ 
fome vi6luals, and* gave the governor an account were- 
they had pitched their tents, and marked themfelves out-^ 
an habitation or plantation^; it was a very convenient 
place indeed, ontheremoteft part of the ifland, N. E. 
much about the place where I providentially landed in 
my firft voyage, when T was driven out to fea^ the Lord 
«iIone knows whither, in my fooUih attempt to fi^round 
the ifland. 

Here they buik themfelves; two haadlbme huts, and 
contrived them in a manner- like my, firft habitation,, 
being clofe under the fide of a hill, having fome trees 
growing already to the three fides of it ; fo that by 
planting others, it would be very, eafily covered from 
the fight^ unleis narrowly feardied for ; they xdefiredv 
fome dry goat-ikins, for beds- and covering, which were . 
given them-; and upon their giving theip words^ that 
they would not difturb the reft, of injure any of their 
plantations^ they gave them hatchets^ and what, other, 
^ools they could fpare ; fome peafe, . barleys andrice^.

QiingSf tbey were quite out of their element^ and ooulct 
make nothing of it ; and when the rainy feaibn came 
on, for want of a cave in the earth,, they, could not keep^ 
their grain dry, and it was in great danger of fpoiling i, 
and this humbled theni.^much, fo they came and begged 
the Spaniards to help them, which they very readily did ;. 
and in four days worked a great hole in the fide of the 
hill for them, big enough to fecure their corn, and 
other things- from the rain ; butit was but ar poor place 
at bed, compared to mine ; and efpecially as mine wa& 
then ; f6t> the Spaniards had greatly enlarged it^ and 
made feveral new apartments in it. 

About three quarters- of a year after this feparation,. 
a new frolic took thefe rogues, which » together with, 
the former vUlany they had committed, brought. mif- 
chief enough upon them,, and had very near been the 
ruin of the whole colony ; the three new ailbciatea 
began, it feems, to be weary di the laborious life they. 
J^, and that without hope of bettering their circum- 
ftances-; and a whim took them, that th^y would make 
a voyage to the Continent, from whence the favages 
came, and would try if they could not feize uponfome 
pHfoners- among the natives there, and bring thenx 
home, fo as to make them. do. the laborious part of the 
work for them. 

The projeA was not fo prepoftcrous,, if they had gone! 
no further ; ^ut they did nothing, and propofed nothing; • 
but had either mifchlef in the defign, or mifchief in the 
event; and; if I? may give my opinion,, they feemedto^ 
be under- a blaft from heaven j for, if we will not allow 
a viiible ourfti to purfue vifible crimes, how Ihairwe re-^ 
concile- the events of things with. divine juilice ? It waaj 
Gerteinly an apparent* vengeance of their crime of mu*- 
tiny and piracy.^ that brought them to the ilate they 
were in.;, and, as they (hewed not the leaft remorfe fori 
the crime^ but added new villanies to it, fuch as, par-* 
ticu^arly, that' piece of monitrous cruelty of wounding, 
a poor H^ve, becauie he did not, or perhaps could not,^ 
iinderiland to. do what he was direfted; and to wpund

the crime,- the intentional murder, for fuch to be fiire 
if was^ as was afterwards the formed deiign they all 
laid,', ta murder ' the Spaniards in cool bk)od, and j&t 
their-fleep. 

But I Heave obferving, and return to the ftbry : .The" 
l)ire^ fello^ came down to the Spaniards one-morning 
and, in very humble terms, defired to be admitted to 
fpeak with them: the Spaniards very readily beard 
"What they had to fay, which was this : that they were 
tired of living ia the manner they did ; that theyiwere 
not handy enough to make the neceflaries they wanted ;^ 
and that, having no help, thisy found they, fhould be 
ftarved ; but if the Spaniards would giv^ them, leave ta 
take one- of the canoes which they came over in,, and ' 
give them arms and ammunition, proportioned for theit^ 
defence^ . they would go over to the main, and feek their 
fortune, apd fo deliver them from the trouble of fup-^ 
plying them with any other provifions. 

The Spaniards were glad enough to be rid of them,, 
but yet very honeftly reprefented to th^ra the certain- 
dellrudlion they were running into ;.told them, they had ' 
fufFcrcd fuch Ii^rdihips upoii. that; very fpotj that they 
could, without' any fpirit of prophecy, tclJ them, that- 
they . would . be- flarved or murdered ; and b^e- them ^ 
coniider pf it» ' 

The men replied audaciouily, they fhould beflarved^ 
if they (laid here, for theyxould not work; and would 
n6t work : and they could but * be ftarved abroad ; and 
that if they were murdered,, there was>an end of them'^ . 
th^y had no wives or children to cry after them; and,, 
in fliort, iniilled importunately upon their demand, de- 
claring that they would go, whether they would give^ 
them any arms or no. 

The . Spaniards told them, with great kindnefs, that' 
if they wer^ refolved to gOj^hey fhould not go like naked 
men, and be ixL no condition to defend themfelves; and 
that though they could ill fpare their: fire-arms, .having 
not enough for themfelves, yet they would \tt them have 
two mufquets, apiflol,,and acutlafsy and each man ^. 
hatchet, which' they thought fufficient for t^iem.

of freih water, and a young kid alive to kill, they bold- 
lyofet out IB a^anoe fova voyage over the fea, where it; 
was at lead forty miles -broad. 

The boat -was indeed a large ono^ and would have 
very well carried 15 or 20 men; and therefore was ra- 
tlier too big for them to manage; but as they had a fair 
breeze, and the fit)od-tide with them, they did well 
N enough: they had made a mad of a Idng; pole, and a 
fidl of four large goat-ikins dried, wJiich they had fewed. 
oi*laced together; and away they .went merrily enough ; 
the Spaniards called .after them,. Bon-Veajo; and nd 
man ever thought of feeing them any nvore. 

The Spaniards would often fay to one another^ and 
tile two honed £ngli(hmcn, who remained behind, how 
quiet and comfortably they lived, no wthofe three tur- 
bulent fellows were gone ; as for their ever -coming again: 
that was the remoted thing from their thoughts that 
could be imagined ; when behold, after -22 days ab-^ - 
fence, one of the £ngli(hmen being abroad upon his 
planting-work, fees three drange men coming towards . 
him at a didance, two of them with guns upon their 
ihoalders* 

Away runs the Englifhman,. aa if he was^ bewitched, , 
and became frighted and amazed to the governor Spa- 
niard, and tells them they were all undone, for ther^ 
Tvere flrangers landed upon the idand, he could not tell 
Tvho :.the Spaniard paufing a while, lays to him, how 
do you- meaa, you cannot tell who? They are favages 
to be fure. No, no,, fays the Engli(hman, they arc men - 
in clothes, with arms : Nay .then,, .lays the Spaniard, 
"why are you concerned?- If they are not favages, they*. 
mud.be iriends ; ,for ther^ is no Chridian nation upoa. 
earth, but will do us good rather than harmi- 

. Wfiile they were debating thus,- came the three Eng-- 
li&men, andy danding without the wood, which was • 
new planted, hallooed ,to them; they prefently knew 
their voices, and fo all the wonder of that kind ceafed.. 
But now the admiration was. turned upon another ques- 
tion, viz. What could be the jnatter, and what made: 
them come back again. 

It was not long before they brought the men in ; and

doing? They gave tbem a fiiH account of their voya«T,» 
in a few words, viz. That they reached the land in two 
days, or fomething Icfs ; but, finding the people alarmed 
at their coming, and preparing with bows and arrows, 
to fight them, they durft not go on.fliore,, but failed on 
' to the northward 6 or 7 hours, till they came to a great 
opening, by which they perceived that the land they 
few from our iflahd was not the main, but an illand ;. 
that -entering that opening of the fea, they faw another 
iiland on the right hand north, and feveral more weft ;. 
and, being r^folved to land fomewhere,,. they put over 
to one of the iflands which lay weft^ and went boldly on 
fhore ; that they found tiie people were courteous and 
friendly to them, and they gave them feveral roots, and 
fbme dried fifli, and appeared very fociable ; and the. 
women, as well as the men, were very forward to lupply 
them with any thing they could get for them to eat, and. 
brought it to them a great way upon their heads. 

They continued, here four days, and eimnired, as 
well as they could of them by figps, what nations Wer•^ 
this way, and that way. ; and were told of feveral fierce 
and terrible people, that lived almoft everyway ; who, 
as they made known by figns to them, ufed to eat men ;. 
but as for themfelves, they faid that they never eat men 
or women, except only fuch as they took in the wars ;. 
and then. they owned, that they made a great feaft, and* 
eat their prifoner«. ^ , 

The Englilhmen enquired, when they hada feaiiof 
that kind ; and they told them, two moons ago,, pointing^ 
to the moon, and then to two fingers;- and that their 
great king had 200 prifoners now, which he had taken- 
in his war ; and they, were feeding them to make thenv 
fat for the next feaft. The EngliJhmen feemed mighty 
defirous to fee thofe prifoners ;Jbut the others miftaking^ 
them, thought they were defirous to have Ibme or' 
them, to ^carry away for their own eatii^. So they: 
beckoned to them, pointing to the fetting of the fun,, 
and then to the rifing ; which was to fignify^ that the 
next morning, at fun rifing, they woidd bring fome for 
them ; and accordingly, the next morning, they brought, 
down five women, and eleven men ; a^^d gave thengi

voyage, juft as we would bring fo many cows and oxen 
down to a fea-port town, to viftual a fliip. 

As brutifh and barbarous as thefe fellows were at 
home, their ftomaclis turned at this fight, and they did 
not know what to do ; to refufe the prifoners, would have 
been the higheft aifront to the favage gentry ^hat offered 
them ; and what to do with them they knew not ; how- 
ever, upon (bme debate, they refolve<l to accept of them ; 
and in return, they gave the favages- that brought them, 
one of their hatchets, an old key, a knife, and fix of 
kven of their bullets, which, though they did not under- 
Itand they feemed extremely pleafed with ; and then, ty- 
ing the poor creatures hands behind them, they (the 
people) dragged theprifoners into the boat for our mem 
The Englifiimen were obliged to come away as fooa 
as they had them, or elfethey that gave them this noble 
. prclent, would certainly have expefted that they ihould 
have gone to work with them, have killed two or three 
of them, the next morning, and perhaps, have invited the 
donors to dinner. ^ 

But, having taken their leave with all the refpefts and 
thanks that could well pafs between people, where on 
one fide, -they underflood not one word they could fay^ 
they pjut oflF with their boat, and came back towards 
the firft ifland, where, when they arrived, they fet eighfe 
of their prifoners at liberty, there being too many of 
them for their occafion^ 

In their voyages they endeavoured to. have fome com* 
mu^ication with their prifonters, b.ut it was impoflible 
to make them underfi;and any thing ; nothing they could 
-fay to them, or give them, or do for them> but was 
looked upon as going about to murder them ; they firft 
of all unbound them, but the poor creatures fcreamed 
at that, efpecially the women, as if they had juft felt the 
Icnife at their throats ; for they immediately concluded 
they were unbound on purpofe to be killed. 

If they gave them any thing to eat, it was the fame 
thing ; then they concluded it was for fear they ihould 
fink in flefh, and fo not be fat enough to kill : if the;^ 
looked at one of them more particularly, the party pre* 
{ently concludid, it was to fee whether he or (he was

them quite over^j3EMii>egan to ufe them kindly, amf j 
treat them well, mff they exne(5led every day to make»| 
dinner or flipper for their new mailers. 

When the three wanderer* had given this unaccount«| 
able hiftory or journal of their voyage, the Spaniard»|] 
a(ked them, where their new family was. And beinp 
told tliat they had brought them on (hore,.andput thcia*!

Engliihmen, that is to fay, the whole colony refolvcd^ 
to go all down to the place, and fee them, and did fo, 
and Friday V father with them. 

W hen they came into the h»t, there they fat all t^ound ^- 
for when they had brought therti on Ihore, they bound' 
tkeir hands,, that they might not take the boat and^ 
make their efcape ; there, I fay, they fat, all of them^ 
ftark-nakdd ; firft, there were three men,, lully comely 
fellows, well (haped, iirait and fair limbsr about 30 or 
S5 years of age, and 5 women, whereof two nnght be- 
from 30 t^4(>, two more not above -24- or 25, and the 
£flh a tall comely maiden, about 16 or 17 : the« women 
were well-favoure^ agreeable^perfons^ bothan^iKape and'

Fritlay's father, to go in, and ifee firft if he knew any of 

them ; and then, if he und^rftood any of their fpeech : 

as soon as the old man: came in, he looked ferioufly at 

them, but knew none of tjicm, neither could any of 

them undcrftand a word lie faid, or a figo, he could. 

make, except one of the women. 

However, this was enough to anfwcr the end, whicl|r 
was to fatisfy them^ that the men into whofe hands they, 
were fallen were Chriftians, that they abhorred eating of 
men or women, and that they might be fare they would; 
not be killed ; asioonas they were afliired of thi», they 
difcovered fuch a J9y> and by fuch aukward and feveral 
ways, as is hard to defcribe;. for it feems they were o£ 
federal nations. 

The woman, who was their interpreter, was bid^ liL 
the next place, to aOt them if they were willing to be 
fervants, and to work for the men who had brought 
them away,, to iave their lives ? ,At which they all fell- 
a dancing ; and prefently one fell to taking up this, and 
another that, any thing that lay next, to cari^. on their 
ihoulders^ to iotinaate that they.were willing to work.. 

The governor, who found that the having wom'eai 
among them would pre(ently be attended with fom'e 
i)iconveniency, and might occaiion fbme drife, and per« 
baps Mood, aiked the three men, what they intendodto 
do with thefe women, and hpw they intended to ufe 
thent, whether as fervai^ts, or as women. One of the. 
Engliihmen anfwered very boldly and readily, that they, 
would ufe them as both. To which the governor faid,. 
I am not going to rcftrain you from it;, you arc your 
own maders as to that ;, but this 1 think is but juil, for 
avoiding diforders and quarrels among you ^. and! de(ire 
it of you for that reafon only, viz. that -you will all en-» 
gage, that if any of you take any of thefe women, as a 
woman, or wife, he (hall take but one ; and that having 
taken one, none elfe ihould touch her ; for though wo 
cannot marry any of you, . yet it is but reafonable, that 
while you Aay here, the woman any of you take, 
&ould be maintained by the man that takes her, and 
ihould ^be his wife ; I mean, fays he, while he continues 
here ; and that none dfe ihoukl have any thing to do . 
with her. All this appeared Co }aft|^ that every one

Then the Engliihmen afked the Spaniards, if they djs** 
figncd to take any of them ? But every one anfwered^ 
no : fome of thenri faid they bad wives in Spain, and 
the others did not like women that were B«t Chriftians : 
and altogether declared, that they would not touch one 
of them ; which was an indance of fuch virtue, as I 
have not met with in all my travels : on the other hand, 
to be (hort, the rtve Engliflimen took them every one a 
wife ;' that is to fay, a temporary wife ; and fo they fet 
up a new form of living ; for the Spaniards and Friday's 
father lived in my old habitation, which they had en- 
larged exceedingly within ; the three fcrvants, which 
they had taken in the late Ijattle of the favages, lived 
with them, and thele carried on the main part of the 
colony, fapplying all the reft with food, and affiiling 
them in any thing as they could, or as they found ne- 
ceffity required* 

But the wonder of thFs ftory was, how five fuch re- 
fraftory ill-matched fellows fliould agree about thefe 
women, and that two of them fhould not pitch upon 
the fame woman, efpecially iceing two or three of them 
were, without com»|)arifon, more agreeable than the 
Qthers ; but they took a good way enough to prevent 
quarrelling among thcmfeives ; for they fet the five wo- 
men by themfelves in one of their huts, and they went 
all into the other hut, and drew lots anaong them who 
ihould chuCe firft. 

He that drew to chufe firft went away by himfelf to- 
the hut where the poor naked creatures were, and fetch- 
ed out her he chofe ; and i» was worth obferving, that 
he that chofe firft, took her that was reckoned the home- 
lied, and the oldeft of the five, which made mirth enough 
among the reft ; and even the Spaniards- laughed at it t 
but the fellow confidered better than any of them, that: 
it was application and bufmefs that they were to cxpeft 
aHidance in, as ipuch as any thing die ; and (he proved' 
the beft wife in the parcel. 

When the poor, womien faw themfelves fet in. a row 
thus, and fetched out oncf by one, the terrors of their 
condition returned upon them again^ and they firmly- 
believed, that they were now going to be devoured : ao^ 
€OJtdmgly^ when th^ Englilh lailoc came in and fetched- 

\. ... out 



ADVENTURES OP ROBINSON CRUSOE* S$ 

"Out one of them, the reft fet up a mott lamentable cry, 
amd hung about her, and took their leave of her with 
foch agonies and luch afFe6Uon, as would have grieved 
the hardett' heart in the world ; nor was it poffible for 
the Englifhmen to fatisfy them that they were not to be 
immediately murdered, till they fetched the old man, 
Friday's father, who inftantly let them know, that the 
five men who had fetched them out one by one, had 
<:horen them for their wives. 

V\ hen tifey had done this, and the fright the women 
•were in was a little over, the men went to work, and 
the SpaniaKls came and helped them ; and, in a few 
hours they had Jjuiit them every one a new hut or tent 
for their lodging apart : for thofe they had already, were 
crouded with their tools, houlhold-ftuff and provilions ; 
Thethree wicked ones had pitched fartheft off, and the 
two honcft ones nearer, but both on the north-ihore of 
the ifland. To that they continued feparate as before ; and 
thus my iilaod peopled in three places, and, as I might 
lay, three towns were began to be planted. 

And here it is very well worth obferving, that, as it 
•often happens in the world (what the wiie ends of God's 
providences are m fuch a diipofition of things, I cannot 
fay), the two hbneft fellows had the two worft wives: 
and the three reprobates, that were fcarce worth hang- 
ing, that were fit for nothing, and neither feemed born 
to do themfelves good, nor any oneelfe, had three clever, 
diligent, careful, and ingenious wives ; not that the two 
iirft were ill, wives as to their temper or humour ; for all 
the five were moft willing, quiet, paifiye, and fubjedted 
creatures, rather like flavesthan wives ; but my meaning 
is, they were not alike capable, or ingenious, or indus- 
trious, or alike cleanly neat. 

Another obfervation I muft make, to the honour of 
a diligent application on the one hand, and to the dif- 
grace of a llothful, negligent, idle temper on the other, 
that when I came to the place, and viewed the feveral 
improvements, planting, and management of the feveral 
little colonies, the two men had lb far outgone tjie 
three, that there was no comparifon : they had indeed 
both of them as much ground laid out for cora as they 
wanted ; aad the leafon was^ becaufe^ according to nxy

fow more corn than they wanted ; but the difference of 
the cultivation, of the planting, of the fences, and indeed 
every thing elfe, was eafyto be feen «f firft view. 

The two tnen had innumerable young trees planted 
, about their huts, that when you came to the place, no- 
thing was to be feen but a Wood ; and though they had 
their plantation quite demoliihed, once by their own 
countrymen, and once by the enemy, asihall be (hewa 
in its place, yet 'they*bad reftored all again, and every 
thing was flouri(hing and thriving about them ; they had 
grapes planted in drder, and managed like a vineyard, 
though they had themfelves never feen any thing of that 
%nd ; and by their good ordering their vines, theit 
Sgrapes were as good again as any of the others. They 
had alfo formed themfelves a retreat in the thickeil part 
of the woods, ^h^e, though there was not a natural 
xave, as I had found, yet they made one with incelTapt 
labour of their hands, and where, when the mifchief 
which followed happened^ they fecut^d their wives and 
children, fo as tbey^could never be found: they having 
i)y (licking inn umeralble (lakes and poles of the wood, 
which, as I faid, 'grew fo eaiily, made a grove impaifa- 
ble, except in one place, where they climbed up to g€t 
over the out(ide part ; and then went in by ways o€ 
their own leavinor. 

As to the three Teprobates, as Ijiiilly<:allthem, tho 
they were much civilized by their new fettlenient, com- 
pared to what they were before, and were not 4b quair* 
relfome, having not the fame opportunity, yet One ot 
the certain companions of a profligate mind, never left 
them, and that was their idlenefs ; it is true, they plant*^ 
cd corn, and made fences ; but Solomon 'is Words were 
ue^er better verrified than in them ; • 1 went by the 
vineyard of the (lotbful, and it was overgrown with 
thorn ; * for when the Spaniards came to view their crop, 
they could not lee it in lome places for weeds ; the hedge 
had feveral gaps in it, where the wild goats had gotten 
in, and eaten up the corn; perhaps here and there a 
dead buih was crammed in, to dop them out for the 
prefent, but it was only (hutting the liable door after 
the ile^d was ftolcn : whereas^ when they looked on the

»colony of tbe other twQ, there was the very face of in- 
duftry and faccefs upon all they did ; there was not a 
weed to be fcen in all their corn, or a gap in any of their 
hedges : and they, on the othe** hand, verrified Solomon's 
words in another place : * The diligent hand raaketh 
lich ;' for every thing grew and thrived, and they had 
plenty within and without ; they had mor^ tame cat- 
tle than the others, more utenfils and neceffaries withia 
doors, and yet ra^'re plearnre and diveriion too. 

It is true, the wives of the three were very handy and 
^cleanly within doors ; and, having learned ihe En^lifli 
way of drefiing and ^cooking from one of the other Eng- 
lifemen, who, as 1 fid, was a cook's mate on board 
the (hip, they drcfled their hofbMnd's viduals very nice- 
ly; whereas the other could not he brought to under- 
ftand it ; but then the hufband, who, as I faid, had been 
cook's mate, did k himlelf ; but, as for the hufbands 
of the t>irec wives, «thcy Voitered a^out, fetched turtles* 
eggs, and caught' Hih and birds : in a word, any thing 
but labour ; and they fared accordingly. The diligent 
lived well and 'comfortably, and the flothful lived hard 
and beggarly; and fo I bdicve, generally fpeaklng, it is 
all over the world. 

But now 1 come to a fccnc, different from all that had 
happened before, either to them or roe, and the origin of 
the ttory was ^his ;: 

Early one morning there came on (horc five or ITx 
•canoes of Indians, or favages, call them which you 
pleafe ; and there is no^room to doubt that they came 
upon the old errand of "feeding upon their (laves ; bur 
that part Was now fo familiar to the Spaniards, and to 
our men too, that they did not concern themfelves about 
it, as I did; but, having been made fen(ible by their 
experience, that their only buiinefs was to lie concealed, 
and that, if they were not feen by any of the lavages, 
they would go off again quietly, when their bufinefs was 
done, having as yet not the lead notion of there being 
any inhabitants in the idand; I fay; having been made 
fenfible of this, they had nothing to do but to give no- 
tice to alV the three plantations to keep within doors, 
and not to (hew themfelvts ; only placing a fcout in a 

4 proper 



7t '^ ADVENTURES OF ROBIMSOK CRUSOK* 

proper place, to give notice when the boats went off to 
it2L again. 

This was, without doubt, very right ; but a difailcr 
fpoiled all thefe yneafures, and made it known among 
the favBges, that there were inhabitants there ; which 
was, in the end, the defolation of almoil the whole co« 
lony. After the canoes with the favagfes were gone off, 
the Spaniards peeped abroad again, and fome of them 
•had the curiofity to go to the place where they had been, 
to fee what they had been doing. Here, to their great 
furprife, they found three favages left behind, and lying 
fail afleep upon the ground ; it was fuppofed, they had 
cither been fo goi;ged with their inhuman feafti that like 
beads, they were adeep, and would not ftir when the 
others went, or they wandered into the woods, and did 
not come back in time to be taken in. 

The Spaniards were greatly furprifed at this fight, and 
perfeftly at a lofs what to do ; the Spaniard governor as 
It happened, was with them, and his advice was aflced, 
but he profefled he knew not what to do ; as for ilaves 
they had enough already ;' and as to killing them, they 
were none of them inclined to that ; the Spaniard gover- 
nor told me, they could not think of (bedding innocent 
^lood; for, as to them, the poor creatures had done 
no wrong, invaded none of their property, and they 
thought they had no juft quarrel with them, to take 
away their lives. 

And here I mud, in juftice to thefe Spaniards, obferve, 
that let all the accounts of Spaniih cruelty in Mexico and 
Peru be what they will, 1 never met with feventeen men, . 
of any nation whatfoever, in any foreign country, 
who were fo univerfally modcft, temperate, virtuous, 
fo very good-humoured, and fo courteous, as thefe Spa- 
niards ; and as to cruelty, they had nothing of it in their 
very nature; no inhumanity, no barbarity, no out- 
rageous paffions, and yet all of them men of great cou- 
rage and fpirit^ 

I'heir temper and calmnefs had apj>eared in their 
bearing the unfutFerable ufage of the three Engliflimen, 
and their juftice and humanity appeared now in the 
cafe of the favages, as above : after fome confultation, 

they

ihtj refolved upon this, that they would He ftill awhile 
longer, till, if poffible, thdfe three men might be gone; 
l)ut then the governor Spaniard recollc<fted, that the 
'three lavages had no boat*; and thatj/ if they were left 
to rove about theifjand, they would certainly difcovcr 
that there were iijhabitants ki it, and fo they fhould be 
undone that way. 

Upon this they Werit back again, and there lay the 
fellows fail afleep ftill ; fo they refolved to awaken them, 
and take them prifoners, and they did fo : the poof 
fellows were ftrangcly frighted when they were feized 
upon and bound, and afraid, like the women, that they 
Ihould be mfurdered and eaten ; for, it feem»» thole peo* 
pic think all the world do as they do, eating men's 
flefti ; but they were foon made 6afy as to th^t, and 
away they carried them. 

It was very happy to them, that they <!id not carry 
them home to their caftle^ I mean to my palace under the 
hill ; but they carried them firli to the bowet*, where was 
the chief of theiV country work ^ fitch as the keeping the 
goats, the planting the corn, Stc, and afterwards they 
xarried them to the habitation of the two Engliflxmen. 

Here they were fetto work, though it was not nnuck 
they had for them to do ; and whether it was by neg- 
igence in guarding^ them, or that they thought the fel* 
Jows conld not mend themfelves, I know not, bat one 
of them ran away-: and, taking into the woods, they 
could never hear of him more. 

They had good reafon to believe he got home agaia 
foon after in fome other boats or canoes of favages, 
who came on fhore three or four weeks afterwards, and 
who, carrying on their revels as ufual, went off again in 
two days lime : this thought terrified them exceedingly ; 
for they concluded, and that not without goodcaufe in- 
<leed, that if this fellow got fafe home anaong his com-* 
rades, he would certainly give them jn account that there 
were people in the iiland, as alfo how weak and few they 
were ; tor this favage, as I obfcrved before^ had never 
been told, as it was very happy he had not, how many 
they were, or where they lived, nor had he ever feen or 
heard the fire of any of their guns,- much lefs had they 
ihewn him any other of their retired places, fuch as the

cave in the valley, or the new retreat lYhich the twa 
EnjrUfhmen had ma^le, and the like. 

The firft teftimony they had, that this fellow had 
given intelligence of them was, that aboot two months 
iifter this, (ix canoes of lavages, with about feven, or 
eight, or ten men in a canoe, canie rowing along the 
north-fide of the ifland, where they never ufed to come 
before, and landed about an hour after fun-rife, at a 
convenient pllace, about a mile ffom the habitation of 
the two Englifnrnen, where this efcaped man had been 
kept : as the Spaniard governor faid, had they been 
all there, the damage would not have been fo much, 
for not a man *of them would have efcaped; but, the 
cafe differed now very much ; for two men to fifty were 
too much odds : the two men had the happinefs to dif- 
cover them about a league ctt, fo that it was above an 
hour before they landed ; and as they landed about a , 
mile from their huts, it was fome time before they could ' 
Come at them. Now having great reafon to believe that 
they were betrayed, the firfi thing they did, was to bind 
the flayes which were left, and caufe two of the three 
men, whom they brought with the women, who, it 
feems, proved very faithful to them, to lead them with 
their two wives, and Whatever, they could carry away 
with them, to their retired place in the woods, which I 
have fpoken of above, and there to bind the two fellows 
hand and foot till tiiey heard farther. 

In the next place, feeing the favages were all come on 
Ihore, and that they bent their courfe diredtly that 
("way, they opened the fences where their milch-goats 
•were kept, and drove them all out, leaving their goats 
to draggle into the wood, whither they pleafed, that 
the favages might think they were all bred wild ; but 
the rogue who came with them was too cunning for that, 
and gave them an account of it all ; for they went di- 
reiftly to the place. 

When the two poor frighted men had fecured their 
wives and goods, they lent the other flave they had 
of the three, who came with the women, and who was 
at their place by accident, away to the Spaniards, with 
all fpeed, to give them the alarm, and deiire fpeedy 
help; and in the mean time they took their arm's, 

and 



afltl what ammunition they had, and retreated toward the 
place in the wood, where their wives were fent, keeping 
at a di fiance, yet fo that they might fee, if poifiblc^ 
which way the Tavagcs took. 

They had not gone far, but that, from a rifing 
ground, they could fee the little army of their enemies 
tome oft diredlly to their. Iraibitation, and in a moment 
more could fee all their huts and hovihold-ilufF flaming 
lip together, to their great grief and mortification ; fof 
they had a very great lofs ; and to them irretrievable, at 
leaft for fome time. Tl^ey kept their ftation for awhile^ 
till they found the favages, like wild beaib, fprcad them* 
felves all over the place, rummaging every way, and 
every place they could think of, in fearch for prey ; and 
in particular for the people of whom, it plainly appeared, 
they had intelligence. 

The two Englifhmen feeing this, thinking ttemfelves 
ftot fec^ite where they flood, becaufe, as it was hkely 
fome of the wild people might come that wfty» (b they 
might come too many together, thought it proper to 
make another retreat about half a mile farther, believing, 
as it afterwards happened, that the farther they ftrolled, 
the fewer would be together. 

The atit hall was at the entrance into a very thick 
grown part: of the woods, and where an old trunk of a 
tree ftood> which was hollow, and vaftly large, and in 
this tree they both took their ftafldiflg, refolving to fee 
what might offer. • 

They had not ftood tWelohg, Wt two of the favages 
appeared running direftly that way, as if they had already 
notice where they ftood, and were coming up to attack 
them ; and a little way further they efpied three more 
coming after them, and ^vt more beyond them, all com- 
ing the fame way ; beiides which, they faw 7 or 8 more at 
B'diftance, running another way ; for, in a word, they 
ran every way, like fportfmen beating for their game. , 

The poor men w^re now in great perplexity, whether 
they fhould (land, and keep their pofturC) or fly ; but after 
a very iliort debate with themfelvcs> they confidered, that 
if the favages ranged the country thus, before help came, 
they might, perhaps, find out their retreat in the woods, 
and then all would be loft ; fo they rcfolvcd to Hand them

there ; and if there were too many to deal with, then they> 
would get to the top of the tree, from whence they doubt- 
cd*not to defend them felvcs, fire excepted, as long as their 
ammunition lafted, tho* alt the favagcsthat were landed, 
which were near fifty, were to attack them. 

Having rcfolved upon this, they next conCidered whether . 
they fhould fire at the two firlt, or wait for the three, and fo 
take tbe midiUe party ; by which the two and the five that 
followed would be feparated ; at length they refolved tolet"^ 
thOk t\\p firft pafs.by, unlefs they fhould. fpy them in the 
tree, and come to attack them. The two firll favages alfo 
confirtned them in this refolution, by turning a little from 
them towards another part of the wood ; but the three, 
and the five after them, came forwards directly to the 
tree, as if they had known the Englifhmen were there. 

Seeing them come fo ftrait towards them, they refolved 
to take, them in a line as they came ; and as they refolved 
to fire but one at a time, perhaps the firft fhot might hit 
them all three ; to which purpofe, the man who was to 
fire, put three or four bullets into his piece, and having 
a fair loop-hole, as it were, from a broken hole in the 
tree, he took ar fure aim, without being feen, waiting 
till they were within about thirty yards of the tree, lo 
that ht could not tnifs. , 

While they were thus waiting, and the favages came 
on, they plamly faw, that one of the three was the run- 
away favage that had efcaped from them, and they both' 
knew him dillindly, and refolved that, if poffible, he 
fhould not elcape, though they fnould both fire; fo the 
other flood ready with his pic:ce, that if he did not drop 
at the firft fhot, he fhould *be fure to have a fecond.' 

• 

But the firlt was too good a markfman to mifs his aim : 
for the favages kept near one another a little behind 
in a line ; in a word, he fired, and hit two of them di- 
re6lly : the foremoft was killed outright, being fhot in 
the head ; the fecond, which was the run-a'way Indian, 
was fhot through the body, and fcU, but wa> not quite 
dead ; and the third had a little fcratch in the flioulder, 
perhaps by the fame ball J:hat went through the body of 
the fecond ; and, being dreadfully frighted, though not 
Thuch hurt, fat down upon the ground, fcreaming and 
yelling 1n a hideous manner. 

The 



ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE, 77 

The five that were behind, more frighted with the 
noife than fenfible of their danger, flood (till at firll ; ibr 
the woods made the found a thoufand times bigger than 
It really was ; the echoes rattling from one fide to ano- 
ther, and the fowls riling from all parts, fcreaming and 
making, every fort, a leveral kin<l of noife, ' according 
to their kind, juit as it was when I fired the firft cruh 
that, perhaps, was ever (hot off in that place fince il 
was an ifland. ^ • 

However, all being filent again^ and they not knowing 
what the matter was, came on, unconcerned, till they" 
came to that place where their companions lay in a 
condition miferable enough : and here the poor ignorant 
creatures, not fenfible that tl>ey were within reach of the 
fame mifchief, ftood all of a huddle over the wounded 
man, talking, ^d, as may bfe fuppofed, enquiring of 
him how he came to be hurt ; and who, 'tis very ratio- 
nal to believe, told them that a fialh of fire firfl, and 
immediately after that, thunder from their gods, had 
killed thofe two, and wounded him : this, I lay, is ra- 
tional ; for nothing is more certain than that, as they 
faw no man near them, fo they had never heard a gun 
in all their lives, or fo much as heard of a gun ; neither 
knew they any thing of killing or wounding at a diftance, 
with fire and bullets ; if they had, one might reafpnably 
believe, that they would not have flood fo unconcerned, 
in viewing the fate of their fellows, without fome appre- 
henfion of their own. 

Our two men, though, as they confefled to- me, it 
grieved them to be obliged to kill fo many poor crea- 
tures, who at the fame time had no notion of their dan- 
ger ; yet, having them all thus in their power, and the 
firft having loaded his piece • again, refolved to let fly 
both together among them ; and tingling out by agreife- 
meitt which to aim at, they fhot together, an<J killed, or 
very much wounded, four of them; the fifth, frighted 
even to death, though not hurt, fell with therell; fo 
that our men, feeing them all fall together, thought they 
had killed them all. 

The belief that the favages were all killed, made oi|r 
two men come boldly out from the trep before they 
bad charged . their guns again ; which, was a wron^

ftep ; and they were under fome furprife, when t^ty 
came to the place, and found no lels than four of the 
men alive, and of them, two very little hurt, and one 
not at all ; this obliged them to fall Upon them with the 
frocks of their mufquets ; and firft, they made fure of 
the runaway favage, that had been the caufe of all the 
inifchief ; and of another that was hurt in his knee, and 
put them out of their pairv ; then the man that was not 
hurt at all came and kneeled down to them, with his 
two h amis held up, and made piteous moan to them by 
geftures and figns, for his life; but could not fay one 
word to them th^t they could underftand. 

However, they fignified to him to fit down at the foot 
©f a tree thereby ; and one of the Engliflimei*, with a 
piece of rope twine, which he had by great chance in his- 
pocket, tied his feet fall together, and his hands behind 
him, and there they left him ; and with what fpeed they 
could, made after the other two which were gone before 
fearing they, or aiiy more of them, (hould find, the way 
to their covered place m the woods, where their wives,, 
and the few goods they bad kf t ky : they came oneeint 
fight of the two men, but it wasa great diitance; how* 
ever, they had the fatisfadkion to fee them crofs over & 
Yalley, towards the fea, the quite contrary way from that 
which led to tl>eir retreat, which they were afraid of; 
andy being fatisfi^ with that, they went back to the tree 
where they left their prifoner, who, as they fuppofed, 
was delivered by his comrades ; for he was gone, ahd 
the two pieces of rope-yarn, with which they had bound 
]iim» lay juil at the foot of the tree. 

They were now in as great concern as before, not 
knowing what courfe to take, or how near the enemy 
might be, or in what numbers ; fo they refolved to go 
away to the place where their wives were, to fee if all 
was well there, and to make them eafy, .who were in 
fright enough to be fure ; for though the favages were 
their own country folks, yet they were mod terribly a- 
fraid^of them, and perhaps the more,^ for jthe knowledge 
they had of them. 

When they came thither, thcj^ f6und the favages had 
been in the wood, and very near the place, but had not 
£oiuid it; for indeed, it was inaccefilblej by the trees

■ftanding fo thick, as before, uqlefs the perfons feeking it 
had been direfted by thofe that knew it, which thefe wcrfe 
not ; they found, therefore, every thing very fafe, only 
the women in a terrible fright : while they were here, 
they had the comfort of fevcn of the Spaniards coming to 
their ailiftance ; the other ten, with their fervants, and 
old Friday, 1 mean Friday's father, were gone in a body 
to defend their bower, and the corn and cattle that wefe 
kept there, in cafe the favages ihould have roved over to 
that lide of the country ; but they did not fpread fo far r 
with tlae feven Spaniards came one of the favages, who^ 
as I faid, were their prifoners formerly, and with them 
alfo canie the favage whom the £ngli(hmen had left 
bound hand and foot at the tree : for it feems they came 
that way, faw the {laughter of the feven men, and 
unbound the eighth, and brought him along with them ; 
where, however, they were obliged to bind him again, 
as they had done the two others, who were left when 
the third ran away. 

The prifoners began now to be a burden to them, and 
they were fo afraid of their efcaping, that they thouglit 
they were under an abfolute necefiity to kill them for their 
own prcfervation ; however, the Spaniard governor would 
not confent to it ; but ordered, that they (hould be fent 
out of the way, to my old cave in the valley, and be kept 
there with two Spaniards to guard tnem and give them 
food, which was done, and they were bound^ there 
hand and foot for that night. , 

When the Spaniards came, the twa Englifhmen were 
fo encouraged, that they could not fatisfy themfelves to 
ilay any longer there ; but taking five of the Spaniards 
and themfelves, with four mufqujcts and a piftol among 
them, and two flout quarter Haves, away they went' in 
quefl of the favages; and firfl, they came to the tree 
where the men lay that had been killed ; but it was 
eafy to fee, that fome more of the {a v ages had been there ; 
for they attempted to carry their dead ntien away, and 
had dragged two of them a good way, but had given it 
over : ^om thence they advanced to the firfl riling ground, 
where they had flood and feen their canip dellroyed, and 
where they had the mortification flilFta fee fome of 
thefnioke; but neither could they here Tee any of the

favawes : they then refolved^ though ^th all poffiblc 
cautioo, to go forward towards their ruimfd plantaUon; \ 
' but a little before they came thither, comnlg in fight of 
• the fea-fhore, they favv plainly all the favagos eoibarked 
again in their canoes, in order to be gone. 

They feemed lorry at firft that there was no way to 
come at them, Vo give them a parting blow : but 
upon the whole, were very well fatisfied to be rid of 
them. 

The poor Engliflimett being now twice ruined, and 
all their improve raent-s deftroyed, the reft all agreed 
to come and help them to rebuild,^ and to aflift them- 
with needful fuppUes, Their three countrymen, who 
were not yefc noted for having "th€ leaft inclination to do. 
any good, yet, as foon as they heard of it (for they, 
living remote eaftward, Icnew nothing of the matter 
till all w^ over), came and offered ^hei? help^ and affift-^ 
ance, and did very friendly work foe feveral days, to- 
reftore their habitations, and make ne6eflaries for them.;, 
and thus ia a little, time they were fet wpoi% their 
legs again. 

V Abo at two days after this, they had the fiartber fatis* 
faftion of feeing three of the favages' canoes come driv;- 
ing on ihofe, and, at fome diiiance from* them, witii 
two drowned men ; by which they had reafon to 
believe,, that the/ had met with a itorm at fea, and 
had overfefri fonae of them; for it bleV veiy hard the 
night after they went off. 

However, as fome might mifcarry, fo, on the other \ 
hand, enough of them efcaped to inform the reft, as 
well of what they had done, as of what happened to 
them. ; and to whet them on to another enterprife of 
the fame nature, which they, it feems, refolved to at- 
tempt, with fufiicient force to carry all; before them ; 
for, except what the firft man had told them of inhabi- 
tants, they could fay little to it of their own knowledge ;, 
for they never faw one mail, and the fellow beicg killed 
that had aihrmed it, they had no other witnefs to con- 
firm it tojthem. 

It was five or fix months after this, before they heard 
any more of the favagcs, in which time our ,raea

hick, or had given over the hopes of better; when, on 
afudden, they werfe invaded with a molt formidable fleet, 
of no lefe than twenty-eight canoes full of favages armed 
with bows and arrows, great clubs, wooden fwords, and 
fuch like engines of war ; and they brought fuch num- 
bers with them, that, in (hort, it put all our people into 
the ntmoft confternation. 

As they came on (bore in the evening, and at the 
eaflermoli fide of the iiland, our men had that night 
to confult and coniider what to do ; and, in the nrfl 
place, knowing that their being entirely concealed was 
their only fafety before, and would much more bcfonow, 
while the number of their enemies was lb great, they 
therefore refolved, firfl of aTl, to take down the huts, 
which were built for the two Engliihmen, and drive 
away their goats to the old cave ; becaufc they fuppofed

(lay^ to play the old game over again, though they did 
not now land within two leagues of it. 

Jn the next place, ttey drove away all the flock of 
goats they had at the old bower, as 1 called it, which 
belonged to the Spaniards ; and, in (hort, left as little 
appearance of inhabitants any wber^ as poflible ; and the 
next morning early they pofted themfelves with all their 
force, at the plantation of the two men, waiting for their 
coming. As they gueflfed, fo it happened ; thefe new- 
invaders, leaving their canoes at the eall-end of the ifland,. 
came ranging along the fliore direAly towards the place, 
to the number of two hundred and fifty, as near as our 
men could judge. Our army was but fmall indeed ; 
but, that which was worfe, they had not arms for all 
their number neither : The whole account, , it fcems,,

To their flakes they did not give either m?u(quet or fa— • 
ill, but they had every one ati halbert, or a long ftaff, like 
a quarter-llaff,. with a great fpike of iron faflened into- 
each end of it, and by his fide a hatchet ; alfo every one- 
of our men had hatchets. Two of thd women could not 
be prevailed upon, but they would some into the fight i 
and they had bows and arrows, which the Spaniards had.' 
taken from the favages, when the fir ft adiion happened,., 
which 1 have fpoken of, where the Indians fought withi 
one another, a^d the women had hatchets too. 

Tlie Spaniar^l governor, whom I have defcribed fovof—

of trees all before them.

with iix or fcvcn bullets a-piece, about as big as larore 
piiiol-bulljets. How many they killed or wounded, they 
knew not ; but the contlcrnation and furprife was incx- 
prcffible among the favages, wha were frighted, to the 
laft degree, to hear luch a dreadful noife, and Tee their 
men killed, and others hurt, but fee nobody that did it ; 
when in the middle of their fright,. William Atkins, and 
his other three, let fly again among the thickeft of them ; 
and in lefs than a minute, the firll three, being loaded 
again, gave tbem a third volley, ^^Ji--^' 

Had William Atkins and his men rekired immediately, • 
as foon as they had fired, as they were ordered to do ; 
or had the relt of the body been at hand, to have poured 
in their Ihot continually, the favages had been efFe6bualIy 
routed ; for the terror that was among them came prin- 
cipally from this, viz. That they were killed by the Gods 
with thunder and lighfning, and could fee nobody that 
hurt them ; but William Atkins, flaying to load again, 
dlfcovered the cheat ; fome of the favages, who were at 
a diftance, fpying them, came upon them behind ; and 
tho' Atkins and his men fired at them alfo two or three 
times, and killed above twenty, retiring as fail as they 
Gould, yet they wounded Atkins hirafelf, and killed one 
of his fellow Engliflimen with their arrows, as they did 
afterwards one^Spaniard, and one of the Indian ilaves who 
came with the women ; this ilave was a moll gallant 
fellow, and fought mofi defperately, killing five of them 
with his own hand, having no weappn but one of the 
armed itaves, and an hatchet. 

Our men being thqs hard laid at^ Atkins wounded, 
and two other men killed, retreated to a riling ground in 
the wood ; and the Spaniards, after firing three vollies 
upon them, retreated aUb, for^eir number was fo great, 
and they were fo defperate, that tho' above fifty of them 
were killed, and more than fo many wounded, yet they 
came on. in the teeth of our men, fearlefs of danger, and 
ihot their arrows like a cloud ; and it was obferved, that 
their wounded men, who were not quite difabled, were 
made outrageous by their wounds, and' fought like 
nadmen.

filvages, wbcn they carae tip to them, killed them over 
again in a wretched manner, breaking their a^ms, legs^ 
and heads, with their clubs^. and' wooden^ fwords, like 
true favages^: but, finding avtt men were gone^ they did^ 
npt feem to purfue them, but drew themielves up in a 
kind of a ring, which is, it feems^ their cuilom, and 
fhouted twice, in token of their victory r after which, 
they had the r^ortiiication to fee feveral of their wounded 
men fall,, dying with the mere lofs of blood. 

The Spaniard governor having drawn his- Rttlc body 
^P together upon a riiing ground, Atkins, though he 
was wounded, would have had him- marched, dnd charg- 
ed frhera again all together at once ;, but the Spaniard: 
replied, Seignior Atkins, you fee how their wounded^ 
men fight ; let them alone, till morning : all thefe wound- 
ed men will be ^iff and fore with their wounds, and- 
faint with the lofs of bloody and fo \9t ihall' have the- 
fewer to engage* 

The advice^was good ; but Will Atkins replied mer- 
xily, That's true. Seignior, and fo ihall I too ; and that's: 
the reafoh I would go on, while I am warm. Well,, 
SeigniCff Atldns, fays the Spaniard,, yoii have behaved* 
gallp.ntly, and done your part; we will fight for you,«. 
if you cannot come on ; but I; think it beft to flay till:

[ But as it was adear- moonlight night, and they found! 
the favages in great diforder abovtt their dead and wound-

The Spaniards charged again, with the utraoft expcdfti^ 
«n, and then divided therafelves into 3 bodies and relblvc^T 

, to fall in among them altogether : they had ip- each body 
8 perfons ; that is to fay i^*, whereof were 22;.mcn, ancf; 
the 2 women, who, by the* way, fought defperately. 

They divided the fire-arms equaily in each party,, 
and fo of the balbert* and ftaves* They would have 
had the women keep back ; but they faid, they were re- 
iblved to die with their hufbands. Having thus formed 
their little army, they marched out /roncv among the 
trees, and ean^e up to the teeth of the enemy, ihouting* 
and hallooing as loud as they coufd ; the favages ftood 
all together, but where in the utmoft confufion, hearinor 
the noife of our mea ihouting from- three quarters toge- 
ther ; they would have fought if diey had feen.us ; and 
as foon as we came near enough to be feen, fomc arrows^^ 
were (hot, and poor old Friday was wounded, tho' not 
dangeroufly. But our men gave them no time; but, 
runni/g up to them, fired' among them three ways, and^ 
then fell in with the butt-ends of their mufquets, their 
fword's, armed ilaves, and hatchets ; and laid about thctw 
fo well, that, in a word, they fet up a difmal fcreaming, 
and howling," flying to fave their lives which way foevcr- 

'they could. ' 

Our men were tired with the- execution ;, and killed,, 
or mortally wounded, in the two fights, about 1 80 of 
them ; the reft, being frighted out of their wits, fcoured 
thro* the woods, and over the hills, with aU the f]>eed' 
that fear and nimble feet could help them to do ; andi 
as we did iK)t trouble ourfelves much to pnrfue them,. 

^ they got altogether to the fea-fide,, where they landed,, 
and where their canoes lay. But their difafter was not 
at aa end yet ; for it blew a terrible ftorm of wind that 
evening from the fea-ward;^ fo that it was impoffible for- 
them to put off ; nay, the ftorqfi continuing all nighty 
when the tide came up, their canoes were moft of thena 
driven by the furge of the fea fo high upon, the fhore^' 
that it required infinite toil to get them off; and fome of' 
ihem were even dadied to pieces againfi the beach, or 
agaiaft one another* 

Our menj, tho' glad of their vi<5iory> yet got little ref&

they could, they refolvcd to march to that part of th^ 
iflantl where the favages were fled, and fee what pofturc 
they were in. This neccflarily led them over the place 
where the fight had been, and where they found feveral 
of the poor creatures not quite dead, and yet paft reco- 
vering life-^a iight difagreeable enough to generous ipinds; 
for a truly great man, tho' obliged by the law of battle 
to deitroy his enemy, takes no delight in his mifery. 

However, there was no need to give any order in this- 
ca(e ; for their own favages who were their fervants^ 
difpatched thofe poor creatures with their hatchets. 

At length they came in view of the place where the 
more milerable remains of the favages' army lay, where 
there appeared about 100 dill ; their pofture was gene- 
rally fitting upon the ground; with their knees up to«^ 
wards their mouth, and the head pat between the hands,, 
leaning down upon the knees. 

When our men came within two mulquel-ftiot of 
them, the Spaniard governor ordered two mufqu^ts to- 
be fired without ball, to alarm them ; this he did, that,, 
by their countenance, be might know what to expedk, 
viz. Whether they were ftill in heart to fight, or were fo- 
heartily beaten, as to be difpirited aiui dilcouraged, and 
fo be might manage accordingly. 

This Itratagem took ; for, as foon as the fav^es heard 
the firfl gun,, and faw the flafli of the fecond, they . 
ftarted up upon their feet in the greatefl condernation. 
imaginable ; and as our men advanced fwiftly towards^ 
them, they all ran .fcreaming and yawlin^ away, witb< 
a kind of an howling noife, which our men did not 
underfland, and had never heard before ; and thus they . 
ran up the hills into the country. . 

At firft, our men had ^ucK rather the weather ha^ 
been calm, and they had all gone away to fea t but they 
did not then eonfider, that this might probably have beer*, 
the occafion of their coming again in fuch multitudes as^ 
not to be refilled ; or,, at leaft, to come fo many and fa 
o(ten« as would quite defoiatetheiilanci, and flarvethem r 
W^iil Atkins therefore,, who, notwiihftandiiig kia.wound» 
kept always with them, proved the bei^ counfdlor in this 
ca& : his advice was, to take the advantage that.of-^ 
fercd^ and clap in between them and their boats ; and

fo deprive them of the capacity of ever returning any 
more to plague the idand. 

They coniulted long about this* and feme were againil 
it, for fear of making the wretches fly into the woods^ 
and live there defperate ; and fo they (hould have them 
to hunt . like wild beads, be afraid to ftir about their 
buiinefsy and have their plantation continually rifled, all 
their tame goats deiiroyed, and,, in (hort, be reduced 
to a life of continual diHrefs. 

Will Atkins told them, they had better have to do 
with 100 men, than with 100 nations ; that as they mud 
dedroy their boatSy fo they mud dedroy the men, or be 
all of them, dedroyed tbemfelves* In a word, he (hewed 
them the neeedity of it fo plainly, that they all cameinta 
it ; £> they went to work inunediately with the boats, 
and, getting fome dry wood together from a dead trec^ 
they tried to fet fome of them on fire ; but they were fo 
wet that they would fcarce bum. However, the fire fo 
burned the upper part^ that it foon. made them unfit for 
fwimming in the fea as boats. When the Indians faw 
what they were about, fome of them came running out of 
the woods ; and» coming as near as they eould to our 
men> kneeled down and cried^ Oa, Oa, Waramokoa, and 
fome other words of their language, which none of Uie 
ethers underdood anything of; but as they made pitiful 
gedur^s and drange noiles, it waseafy to underiiand they 
begged to have their boats fpared^ and that they would 
be gone, an..', never come thither again. 

but our men were now fatisfied that they had no way 
to preferve themfelvcs, or to fave their colony, but d^ 
feftually to prevent any of thefe- people from ever going, 
home again ; dependmg upon this, that if ever fo mucU^ 
as one of them got back into their country to tell the 
dory, the colony was undone : (6 that, letting then^ 
know that they diould not have any mercy, they fell to 
work with their canoes, and dedroyed them every one 
that the dorm had not dedroyed be^re ^ at the fight of 
which the favages railed a hideous cry in the woods, 
which our people heard plain enough ; after which they 
lan about the ifland like didradied men ; fo that, in a 
word, our men did not really know at firii what to do 
mth them«

Nor did the Spaniards, with all their prudence, con®-^ 
der, that while tl^ey made thofe people th us defperate^ 
they ought to have kept good guard at the fame time 
upon their plantations.; for though it is true they had 
dHven away their cattle, and tne Indians did not find 
their main retreat, I mean ray old caflle at the hill, not 
the cave in the valley, yet they found out my pliantatioa 
St the bower, and pulled it alF to pieces, and all the 
fences and pla(nting about it, trod all the com under foot^ 
tore up the vines and grapes, being juft then almoft ripe^ 
and did our men an ineltimable damage, tiio' to them-^ 
felves, not one farthing's worth of fervicc. 

Though our men were able to fight them upon all oc- 
jcafions, yet they were in no condition to purfue them, or 
hpnt them up and down ; for as they were too nimble 
ef foot for OUT men when they found them fingle, fo our 
men durft not go about fingle, for fear of being furround- 
ed with their numbers : the beft was, they had no wea- 
pons ; for tho* they had bows, they had ho arrows left, 
nor any materials to make any, nor had they any edged* 
tool or weapon among them. 

The extremity and diftrefs tBey were reduced to was 
great, and indeed deplorable, but at the fanie time our 
men were alio brought to very hard cireumftances by 
^ them ;. for though their retreats were prcferved, yet their 
pfoviiioft was deilroycd, and their harvcft fpoiled ; and' 
what to do, or which way to turn themfelves, they knew 
not ; the only refuge they had now, was the flock of 
cattle they had in the valley by the cave, and fome little 
com which grew there. The three Englilhmen, William, 
Atkins, and his comrades,, were now reduced to two,, 
one of them being killed by an arrow, which ftruck him 
on the fidfc of his head, jufl under the temples, fo that he 
never fpoke more ; and it was very remarkable, that this» 
was thp fame barbarous felTow who cut the poor favage- 
ilaye with his hatchet, and who ^tfterwards intended to 
bave murdered the Spaniards. 

I looked upon their caie to have been worfe at this

the grains of barley and rice, and got into the method 
of planting and railing my com, and my tame cattle ; for ^

the iiland, which would devour every thing they could 
come at, yet could be very hardly come at themfelves. 

The firft tking they concluded,, when they faw what 
their circumrliances wer^, was, that they would, if pof- 
lible, drive them up to the. farther part of the ifland^ 
fouth-eaft, that, if any noore favages come on (hore, they 
might not find one another : then, that they woiiJd daily 
hunt and harraf& them, and kUl as manv of them as they 
could come at, till they had reduced tneir number, and 
if they could at kil tame them, and bring them to any 
thing, they would give them carp, and teach them how 
to plant and live upon their daily labour* 

In order to this, they followed them, and fa terrified , 
them with their guns, that ia a few days, if any of thenn 
fired a gun at aa Indian, if he did not hit him, yet he 
would fall down for fear ; and fo dreadfully frighted they 
were, that they kept out of fight fa]?ther and farther^ ^ 
till at laft our men following them, and every day almoR 
killing and wounding foime of them,^ they kept Up in the 
woods and hollow places fo much, that it reduced theoL 
to the utrnoft mifery for want of food ; and many 'were 
afterwards found dead in. the woods, without any liurt> 
but meiely ftarved to death*. 

When our men found this, it made their hearts re- 
lent, and pity moved them ; efpecially the Spaniard 
governor^ who was the moft gentleman-like, generous- 
minded man that ever 1 met with in my life : and hb 
propofed, if pofiibk,. to take one of them alive, and 
bring him to underiiand what they meant, fo far as 
to be able to a6b as interpreter, and to go among them, 
and fee if they might be brought to fome conditions- 
that might be depended ^ upon to ikye their lives, and 
to do\Us no. fpoil. 

It was fcMxie time before any of them, could be taken;, 
but, being weak and half-ftarved, one of them was at \b&. 
furprifed and made a priibner ; he was fullen at firil, and 
would neither eat nor dsink ;. but fin^ling himfelf kindly 
vfed, and viduals given him^ and no violence ofiTered 
him, he at lad grew tradable, and came to himfelf. 

They brought old Friday to him, who talked often 
^ith him, and told him how kind the others would be 
Iq th^m sdi I thdt they would not only fave their lives*

but would give them a part of the iflahd to live in, prtv 
videdthey would give fatisfadion ; that they fhould keep 
in tlieir own bounds, and not come beyond them to in- 
jure or prejudice others ; and that they fhould have corn 
given them, to plant arid make it grow for their breads 
and fome bread given them for their prefent fubfiilence ; 
and old Friday bade the fellow go and talk with the reft 
of his countrymen, and fee what they faid to it, afltiring^ 
them, that if they did not agree immediately, they fliould 
all be deftroyed. 

The pobr wretches thoroughly humbled, and reduced 
in number to about thirty-fcvcn, clofed with the propolal 
at the firft offer, and begged to have fome food given 
them ; upon which, twelve Spaniards and two En^lifli- 
men, well armed, and three Indian Haves, and old Friday ,^ 
inarched to the place where they were, the three Indiaa 
iiaves carried them a large quantity of bread, and fome 
rice boiled up to cakes, and dried in the fun, and .three 
live goats ; and they were ordered to go to the fide of 
a hill, where they fat down, eat the provilions veiy 
thankfully, and were the moft faithful fellows to their 
words that could be thought of; for, Except when thejr 
came to beg viduals and diredtions, they never came out 
of their bounds ; and there they lived when I camr to* 
the iiland, and I went to fee them. 

They had taught them both to plant com, make bread, 
breed tame goats, and milk them ; they wanted nothing 
but wives, and they foon would have been a nation: 
thev were confined to a neck of land, furrounded with 
high rocks behind them, and lying plain towards the fcia 
before them, on the fouth-eaft corner of the iiland : they 
had land enough,, and it was very good and fruitful, for 
they h^d a piece of land about a mile* and a half broad^ 
and three or four miles in length. 

Our men taught them to make wooden fpades, fuch as^ 
I made for myfelf; and gave among them 12 hatchets,. ' 
and three or four knives ; and there they lived the rtioli 
fubjedted innocent creatures that were ever heard of. 

After this, the colony enjoyed a pcrfeft tranquillity,. , 
with refped: to the favages, till I came to reviiit them, 
which was in about two years; not but that now and 
then fome canoes of favages came on ihore for their

triumphal unnatural feafts; but as they were of feveral 
nations, and, perhaps, had never heard of thofe that 
came before, or the reafon of it, they did not make any 
iearch or enquiry after their countrymeii ; and if they 
had, it would have been very hard for them to have 
found them out. 

Thus, I think, I .have given a full account of all that 
happened to them, to my return, at lead, ihat was worth 
notice. The Indians,, or favages, were wonderfully 
civilized by them, and they frequently went among 
them ; but forbid, on pain of death, any of the Indians 
coming to them, becaufe they woii^ld not have their fet- 
tlement betrayed again. 

One thing was yer/ remarkable, viz, that they taught 
the lavages to make wicker-work, or baikets ; but they 
foon out-did their mailers; far they made abundance of 
moft ingenious things in wicker-work ; particularly all , 
forts of baikets, iieves, bird-cages, cupboards, &c. as alfo 
chairs to iit on, ilools, beds, coucnes, and abundance of ^ 
other things, being very ihgenious at fuch work, whea 
they- were once put in the way of it. 

My coming was a particular relief to thefe people, 
becaufe we fiarniihed them with knivesj'fciiTars, fpades, 
ihoyels, pick-axes> and all things of that kind which they 
could want. 

With the help of thefe tools they were fo very han- 
dy, that they came, at lail, to build up their huts, or 
houfes, very handfomely ; raddling, or working it up 
like baiket-work all the way round, which was a very 
extraordinary piece of ingenuity, and looked very odd ; 
but was an exceeding good fence, as well againii heat, 
as againii all forts of vermin ; and our men were fo taken 
with it, that they got the wild favages to come and do 
the like for them ; fo that when I come t6 fee the two* 
£ngliihmen*s colonies, they looked, at a dillanc^, as if 
they lived all like bees in a hive ; and as for Will Atkins, 
who was now become a very indutlrious, neceiTary, and 
Tober fellow, he had made himfelf fuch a tent of baf- 
ket-work, as, I believe, was never feen; it was 120 paces 
round on the outiide, as I meafured by my ileps ; the 
walls were as clofe-worked as a batiket, in pannels or 
iqusiicsg thirty-two ia numbc^i and xtvj ftrong, ftand-

ing about 7 feet high ; in the middle was another not 
above 22 paces round, but built flronger, being eight 
fquare in its form, and in the eight corners ftood eight 
very ftrong pofls, round the top of which he laid flrong 
pieces, joined together with wooden pins, from which he 
railed a p/ramid before the roof of eight rafters, yery 
handlbme, I aflure yoi», and joined together very well,. 
though he bad no nails, and only a few iron fpikes^ 
which he had made himfelf too out of the old iron that 
I had left there ; and, indeed, this fellow Ihewcd abun- 
dance ©f ingenuity in icveral things which he had no 
knowledge (^ : ke made himfdf a forge, with a pair of 
wooden bellows to blow the fire ;- he made himfelf char- ^, 
coal for his work, and he formed out of one of the iroa 
crows a middling good anvil to hammer upon j in this^ 
manner he made many things, but efpecially hooks, Na- 
ples and fpikes, bolts and hinges. But to return to the 
houfe : after he pitched the roof of his inncrmoft tent,. 
he worked it up between the rafters with baflcet-work 
ib firm, and thatched that over again fo "ingenioufly with 
rice-ftraw, and over that a large leaf of a tree, which co- 
vered the top, that his houfe was as dry iasjfit had been. 
, tilecj or flated. Indeed, he owned that the favages made 
the bdiket-work for him. 

The outer circuit was covered, as a lean-to,- all round 
this inner apartment, and long rafters lay from the 32 
angles to the top potts of the inner houfe, being about 
twenty feet dillant ; fo that there was a fpace like a walk,. 
within the outer wicker- wall, and without the inner^ 
neir twenty feet wide. 

The inner {^ace he partitioned off with the fame wick^ 
cr-work, but much fairer, and divided it into fii apart-

m liad a fhort paffage flrait before you to the door of 
kc inner houfe ; but on either lide was a wicker parti- 
on, and a door in it, by which you went, fifft, into a 
iTge room or ftore-houfe, 20 feet wide, and aboi^t 30 
eet long, and through that into another not quite fo 
ong ; fo that in the outer circle were ten handfome 
rooms, fix of which were only to be come at through 
the apartm^its of the inner tent, and ferved as clofcts or - 
retired rooms to the refpeftive chambers of the inner cir- 
cle; and four large w^arehoufcs or bams, or what you 
pleafc tocall them, which went in through one another, 
two on either hand of the paiTage, that led through the 
cruter door to the inner tent. 

Such a piece of baiket-work, T believe, was never feen 
ifl the world ; nor any houfe or tent fo neatly contrived, 
much lefs fo built ; in thi^ great bee-hive lived the three 
families, that is to fay. Will Atkins, and his companion ; 
the third was killed, but his wife remained with three 
children ; for fhe was, it feems, big with child when he 
died ; and the other two were not at all backward to give 
the widow her full {hare of every thing, I mean, as to 
their corn, milk, grapes, girc. and when they killed a kid, 
or found a turtle on the Ihore : fo that they all lived well 
enough, though it was true, that they were not fo indus- 
trious as the other two, as has been already obferved* 

One thing, however, cannot be omitted, viz. that as 
for religion, 1 don't know that there was any thing of 
that kind among them ; they pretty often, indeed, put 
oneanother in mind, that there w£^s a God, by the very 
common method of feamen, viz. fwearing by his name : 
Bor were their poor ignorant favage wives much the bet- 
ter for having been married to Chriftians, as we muft 
call them ,; for as^they knew very little of God themfelves, 
fothey were utterly incapable of entering into any dif- 
courfe with their wives about a God, or to talk any thing 
to them concerning religion. 

The utmoft of all the improvement which I -can fay 
*he wives had made from them, was, that they htid taught 
them to fpeak Englifli pretty well ; and all the children 
they had, which were near twenty in ^ all, were taught 
^o. fpeak Engliih too, from their firit learning to fpeak, 
though they at firft fpoke it in' a V€ry broken manner.

like their mothers. There were none of thofe children 
aboye fix years old when I came thither ; for it was not 
much above feven years that they had fetched thefe five 
favage ladies over, but thjey had all been pretty fruitful, 
for they had all children, more or lefs : I think the 
cook's mate wife was big of her iixth child ; and the 
mothers w6re all a good fort of well-governed, qiiiet, 
laborious women, modell and decent, helpful to one ano* 
Jher, mighty obfervant and fubjedt to their mailers, 1 
cannot call them hufbands, and wanted nothing but to 
be well inftrudled in the Chriftian religion, and to be 
legally married ;'' both which were happily brought about 
afterwards by my mekns, or, at leaft>. by the confequepcc 
of my coming among them. 

Having thus given an account of the. colony in gene- 
ral, and pretty much of my five runagade Engliflimcn, 1 
mud fay fomething of the Spaniards, who were the 
m<ain body of the family ; and in whofe ftory there are 
fome incidents alfo remarkable enough. 

I had a great many difcourfes with them about theif 
circumftances, when they were among the lavages ; they 
told me readily, that they had no inftances to give ol 
their appjication or ingenuity in that country \ that they 
were a poor raiferable dejeded handful of people; that 
if means had been put into their hands, they had yet fo 
abandoned themfelves to defpair, and fo Aink under the 
w^eight of their misfortunes, that they thought of nothing 
but (larving : one of them, a grave and very fenfible 
man, told me, he was convinced they were in the wrong ; 
that it was not the part of wife men to give up them- 
felves to their mifery, but always to take hold of the 
helps which reafon ofFered> as well for prefent fupportj 
as for future deliverance ; he^ told me, that grief was 
the mod fenfelefs iniignificant paffion in the world ; foi 
that it regarded only things pall, which were generally 
impoHible to be recalled or to be remedied, but had nc 
view to things to come, and had no fhare in any thing 
that looked like deliverance, but rather added to th< 
afBidlion than propofed a remedy ; and upon this, h( 
repeated a Spanilh proverb ; which, tho' I cannot repeal 
in jullthe fame words that he fpoke it, yet 1 remembei 
1 made it into an EngUfli proverb of my own, thus :

cation, as he palled it^ and how I had made a condition, 
which, in its'circumftance, .was at lirll much worfe than 
theirs, a thoufand times more happy than theirs was, 
even now, when they were altogether : he told me, it 
T/kiS remarkable, that Engliflimen had a greater prelence 
of mind, in their diftrefs, thap any people that ever he 
met with ; that their unhappy nation, and the Portu- 
guefe, were the word men in the world to ftrugglc with 
nusfortunes ; for that their firft ftep in danger, after com- 
jnon efforts are over, was always to defpair, Jic down 
under it and die, without routing their thoughts up to 
proper remedies for cfcapc. 

I told him their cal'e/and mihe differed exceedingly; 
^that they were call upon the Ihore without neceffaries, 
without fupply of food, or of prefent fuftenance, till 
they could provide it : that it is 'true, I had this dif- 
advantagc and difcomfort, that I was alone ; but then 
the fuppiies I had providentially thrown into my hands, 
by the unexpefted driving of the fhip on (horc, was 
fuch a help as would have encouraged any creature in 
the world to have applied himfelf as J had done : 
Seignior, fays the Spaniard, had we poor Spaniards 
been jn your cafe, we fhould never have gotten half 
thofc things out of the (hip as you did : nny, fays he, 
We ihould never have found hieans to have gotten a 
raft to carry them, or to have gotten a raft on fhore 
without boat or fail ; and how much lefs iliould we 
have done, faid he, if any of us had been^'alone ! Well, 
J dcfired him to ^bate his compliment, and go on with 
the hiftofy of their coming on fhore, where they land- 
ed : he told mc, they unhappily landed at a place 
where there were people without proviiions ; whereas, 
had they had the common fenfe to have put off to lea

that the Spaniards of Trinidad had frequently been there^ 
and filled the iiland with goats and hogs at feveral times ^ 
where they have bred in fuch multitudes, and where 
turtle and fea-fowls where in fuoh plenty^ that they 
could have been in no wattt of flefli, though they had • 
found no bread ; whereas here they were only fuf* 
ttined with a few roots and herbs, wbich they under- 
ilood not, and which had no fub fiance in them, and 
which the inhabitants gave them fparingly enough, and 
•who could treat them no better, uniefs they would tura 
canibals, and eat men's fle(h, which was the great dain- 
ty of the country. 

They gave me all accoiant how many ways they 
iftrovc to civilixe the favages they were with, and to 
teach them rational cuftoms in the ordinary way of liv* 
ing, but in vain ; and how they retorted it upon them„ 
as unjuil, that they, who came thither for affiftance and 
fnpport, fhould attempt to fet up for inftrudlors of thofe 
that gave them bread ; intimating^ it feems, that npne 
ihould fet up for the inftrudlors of others but thofe 
IV ho could live without them* 

They gave me difmal accounts of the extremities they 
were driven to; how fometimes they were many days 
without any food at all, the iiland, they were upon being " 
inhabited by a fort of favages that lived more indolent, 
and, for that reafon, were lefs fupplied with the necef- 
I'aries of life, than they had reafon to believe others were 
an the fame part of the world ; and yet they found that 
thefe favages were lefs ravenous and voracious, than thofe 
%vho had better fupplies of food. 

Alfo they added, that they could iiot but fee with 
what demonft rations of .wifdom and goodnefs, the go- 
vernino: Providence of God directs the events of things in 
the work! ; which, they laid,* appeared in their circum- 
stances ; for, if preffed by the hardlhips they were under, 
arid the.barrennefsof the country where they were^ they 
had fearched after a better place to live in, they had then 
been out .of the way of the relief that happened to them 
by my means. 

Then they gave me an account, how the (kvagesj 
whom they lived among, expeded them to go out with

both to friends and enemies ; but being without powder* 
and ihot, and yet in a condition, that they could not in' 
reafon deny to go ovt with their landlords to their wars* 
when they came in the field- of battle, they were in a ' 
worfe condition than the fav^ges themfelves ; for they ^ 
neither had bows nor arrows, nor could they ufe ihofe 
the favag^s gave them; fo that they could do nothing^ 
but Hand dill, and be wounded with arrows, till they" 
came up to the teeth of their enemy ; and thrn, indeed, * 
the three halbcrts they had, were of ufe to them, and' 
they would often drive a whole little army before tberri \ 
with thofe halberts and iharp^ed (licks put into the 
muzzles of their muikets : but that for all this they were' 
foraetimes furroundcd with multitudes, and in great dan- 
ger Irora their arrows ; till at laft they found the way to ' 
make themfelves large targets of wood, which they 'co- 
hered with (kins of wild beaits, whofe names ihey knew 
«ot; and thefe covered them from the arrows of the far 
vages; that, notwithftanding thefe, they were fometimes* 
in great danger, and were once five of them knocked 
down together with the clubs of the favages, which was' 
the time when one of them was taken priloner ;'that is to

htdfd he was taken prifoncr, they were under the greatelt

Urotibled no more "ivitk the favages; or that. If tliey

twice as macv as before ; fo that they had no concert 
tibout that. Then 1 entered into a ferious difcourfe with 
the Spaniard, whom I called governor, about their (lay 
in the ifland ; for, as I was not come to carry any of 
ihera off, fo it would not be juft to carry oft' fome, and 
have others, who perhaps would be linWiWing to flay, 
if their ftren^h was diminifhed. 

On the other hand^ 1 told them, 1 came to ^feftablifh 
them there, not to remove thetn ; and then I let them 
know, that I had bronorht with me relief of fund ry kinds 
for thena : that I had been at a great charge to fupply 
them with all things neceflary ; as well fof their conve* 
iiience, as their defence; and that I had fuch parti-* 
cular perfons 'with me, as well to increafe and recruit 
theic number, as by the particular neceffary employ* 
nfents which they were 'bred to, ^being Artificers, to 
affift them in thofc things, in which, at prefent, they 
were to (eek. 

They were all together when I talked thus to them ; 
^nd before 1 delivered to them the ftores I had brought, I 
a&edthemj one by one, if ihey had entirely forgot and 
buried the firft animofities that had been among them, •

The Spaniards faid, they had, indeed, at firft, dif-r 
armed and excluded William Atkins, and his two coun- 
trymen for their ill condudt, as they had let me know ; 
and they appealed to me for the neceffity ttiey were 
under to do fo ; but that William Atkins had behaved 
himfelf fo bravely in the great fight they had with the 
favages, and on feveral oqcaiions iince, and had fhewed 
himfelf fo faithful to, and concerned for the general in- 
tereft of them all, that they had forgotten all that was 
pad ; and thought he merited as much to be trulited with 
arms, and fupplied with neceiTaries, as any of them ; 
and that they had teftified tjheir fatisfa(5lion in him, bj 
committing the command to him, next to the governor 
himfelf; and as they had an entire confidence in him^ 
and all his countrymen, fo they acknowledged, they 
had merited that confidence, by all the methods that 
honeil men could merit to be valued and truited : and 
they moft heartily embraced the opcafion of giving me 
this alTu ranee, that they would never have any interell 
feparate fronii dne another. 

Upon thefe frank and open declarations of friend- 
ihip, we appointed the. next day to dine all together : 
and, indeed, we made a fplendid feaft : I caufed the 
Chip's cook, and his mate to come on Ihore, and drefs 
our dinner ; and the old cook's mate we had on fhorc 
ailifled. ' We brought on fhore fix pieces of good beef, 
and four pieces of pork, out of the fhip's provifion, 
with our punch bowl, and materials to fill it ; and, in 
particular, I gave them ten bottles of French claret, 
and ten bottles pf Englifti beer ; things that neither the 
Spaniards or the EngUftimen had tufted for many years ; 
and which it may be fuppofed, they were exceeding 
glad of. 

The Spaniards added to our feail five whole kids, 
which the cook's roafted ; and three of them were fent 
covered up clofe on board our fhip to the feamen, that 
they might fcaft on frefh meat from on fhore, as we did 
with their fait meat from on board. 

After this feaft, at which we were very innocently 
merry,. I brought out my cargo of gopds, wherein, that 
there might be no difpute about dividing, I ihewed them 
there was fufficient for them all ; and defired^ that they

tngfit all take an equal quantity of the goods that were 
for wearing ; that is to lay, equal when made up. As 
firfl, I diflributqd linen fuflficient to ihake every one of 
them four fhirts ; and, at the Spaniard's requett, after- 
wards made them up fix ; thefe were exceedingly comfort- 
able to them, having been what, as I mily fay, they h^^ 
long iince forgot the ufe of, or what it was to wear them. 

1 allotted the thin Englifli fluffs, which I mentioned 
before, to make every one a light coat, like a frock, 
"which I judged fitteft for the heat of the feafon, cool anci 
loofe ; and ordered that, whenever they decayed, they 
fliould make more, as they thought fit : the like for 
pumps, ihoes, flockings, hats, &c. 

I cannot exprels what pleafure, what fatisfadtion, fat 
upon the countenances of all thefe poor men, when they 
faw the care I had taken of them, and how well 1 had 
furnilhed them r they told me that I was a father to them : 
and that, having li^ch a correfpondent as I was, in fo re- 
mote a part of the world,, it would make them forget 
that" they were left in a dclblatc place : and they all vo- 
luntarily engaged to me, not to leave the place without 
my confent. 

Then I prefented to them the preopic 1 had brought with 
me ; particularly the taylor, the fmith, and the two car- 
penters, all of them moft neceflary people ; but, . above 
all, my general artificer, than whom they could not name 
, any thing that was more needful to them ; and the taylor, 
to (hew his concern for them, went to work immediately, 
and, w^ith my leave, made them every one a fhirt the firfl 
thing he did ; and, which was dill more, he taught the 
women not only how to few and flitch, and ufe the nee- 
dle, but made them aflift to make the fhirts for their huf- 
bands, and for all the reft. 

As for the carpenters, I fcarce need mention how ufe- 
ftil they were, for they took in pieces all my clumfy un- 
handy things, and made them clever convenient tables, 
flools. bedfteads, cupboards, lockers, ihelves, and every 
thing th^y wanted of that kind. < 

But, to let them fee how nature made artificers atfirfl, 
I carried the carpenters to fee William Atkins's bafket- 
houfe, as 1 called it ; and they both owned, they never 
faw an indance of fiich natural ingenuity before ; nor

its kind : and one of them, when he faw it, after mtt-» 
ilng a good while, turning about to me, I am fur^, fays 
he, that man has no need of us; you need do nothing 
but give him tools. 

Then I brought them out all my flore of tools, and 
gave every man a digging-fpade, a (hovel, and a rake, 
^r we had no harrows or ploughs ; and to every feparate 
place, a pick-axe, a ciow, a broad- axe, and a faw ; al- 
ways appointing that as often as any were broken, -or 
%vorn out, they fhouid be fupplied, without grudging^ 
out of the general ilores that 1 left behind. 

Nails, liaples, hinges, hammers, jchiflels, kni^'es, fcif- 
fars, and all forts of tools, and iron-work, they had 
without tale, as they required ; for no man would care 
to take more than he waxUed ; and he mud be a fool that 
would wafte or fpoil them, on any account whatfoever i 
and, for the ufe of the fmith, I left two to^s of unwrought 
iron for a fupply. 

My magazine of powder and arms, which I brought 
them, was fuch, even to profufipn» that they could no| 
but rejoice at them ; for now they could march as 1- uled 
to do, with a muiket upon each fhqulder, if there was 
occafion ; and were able to fight 1000 lavages,, if thevr 
had but fome liitie advantages of ^tuation ; which alu> 
they could not mifs,of, if they had occafion. 

I carried on ihore with me the young n^an whofc 
mother was itarvcd to death, and the maid alfo ; ihe was

And now the bther two Enslifhmen removed their hahi-

and where they had fo enlarged and extended their woi-ks, 
as well under, as on the outfide of the hill, that they 
lived, tho' perfedlly concealed, yet full at large. Kever 
was there fu^h a little city in a wood, and fo hid, I be-

1000 men might have ranged the ifland a pionth, arid, 
if they had not known there was fuch^ thing, and looked 
on purpofe for it, they would not have found it ; for the

nrft, could difcover the place ; except the two nairow 
entrances where they went in and out, could be found, 
which was not very eafy : one of them was jufl down at 
the water's edge, on the fide of the creek, and it Was 
afterwards above 200 yards to the place ; and the other

who was hrmfelf as good almofl as twenty men, for lie 
was uot only a very ingenious fellow, but a very merry 
fellow; ami, before I went away,, we married him to 
the honed maid that came with the youth in the {hip;, 
whom I mentioned before. 

And now I fpeak of np*arrying, it brings me naturally 
to fay fomething of the French ecckfiatlic, that 1 had 
brought with me out of the (hip's crew, whom 1 took 
at fe;i. It is true, this man was a Roman, and perhaps, 
it may give oifencc to fome hereafter, if 1 leave any thing 
extraordinary u|X)n record, of a man, whom, before I 
. begin, 1 mutt (to fet him out in juft colours) reprefent in 
terms very much to his difadvamage, in the account of 
Proteftants ; as firlt, that he was a Papift ; fccondly, a 
Popifii Pried ; and thirdly, a French Popiih Pried. 

.But judice demands of me to give him a due charac* 
ter ; and 1 muft Iky, he was a gi'ave, fober^ pious, and 
mod religious perfon ; exadl in his life, extenfive in his 
charity, and exemplary in almod every thing he did : 
What, then, can any one fay, againd my b^ing vefy 
fenfible of the value of fuch a man, notwithftjmding his 
profeffion? Though it may be my opinion » perhaps, 
as well as the opinion of others who (hall lead this^ 
that he was raidaken. 

The fird hour that I began to converfe with him, 
after he had agreed to go with me to the Ead Indies, 
I found reafon to delight exceedingly in his converfatioa : 
and he fird began with me about religion, in the moft 
obliging mamier imaginable. 

Sir, fays he, you have not only, tinder God (and at 
that he eroded his bread) faved my life, but you have 
admitted me to go this voyage in your diip, tnd, by 
your obliging civility, have taken me into your femily, 
giving me an -opportunity of free converfation : Now, 
Sir, lays he, y^u fee by my habit, what my profeffion 
is ; and I guefs by your nation, what your's is: I may 
think it is my duty, and, doubtlels, it is fo, to »fe my 
utmod endeavours, on all occadons, to bring all the 
fouls that' I can to the knowledge of the truths and to 
embrace the Catholic dodrine ; but, as I am here under

I I told him his carriage was fo modeft, that I could 

||r| jiot but, acknowledge it; .that it was true,' we were 

fuch people as they call heretics ; but, that he was not 

the firft Catholic that I had converfed with, without 

falling into any inconveniencies, or carrying the quef- 

tions to any height in debate ; that he fliould not find 

himlelf the worfe ufed for being of a different opinioa 

from us ; and if we did not converfe without any dif- 

like on either iide, upon that fcore, it would be his. 

fault, not ours. 

He replied, that he thought our converlation might 
be eaiily fcparated from difputes ; that it was not his 
bufinefs to cap principles with every man he difcourfed 
with ; and th^at he rather deiired me to converfe with 
him as a gentleqaao, than as a rellgieux ; that if I would 
give him leave, at any time,^ to difcourfe upon religious 
lubjedts, he would readily comply with it ; and that 
then he " did not doubt but I would allow hiri> alfo to 
defend his own opinions, as well as he could ^ but that, 
without my leave,, he would not break in upon me with 
any fuch tning* 

He told me farther,, that he would not ©eaic to do all 
that became him in his office, as a prieft, as well as a 
private Chriftian, to procure the good of the (hip, and 
the fafety of all that was in her : and though, perhaps, 
we would not join with him, and he could not pray with 
us, he hoped he might pray for us, which he would do 
uppn all occalions. In this manner we converfed ; and, 
as he was of a raofl obliging gentleman-like behaviour, 
fo he was, if I may be allowed to fay fo,. a man of good 
fenfe, and, as I believe, of great learning* 

He gave me a molt diverting account of his life, 
and of the many extraordinary events of it ; ,of many 
adventures which had befallea him in the few years 
that he had been abroad in the world, and ])articu- 
larly this was very remarkable, viz. that during the voy- 
age he was now engaged in., he had the misfortune to 
be five times ihipped and uhlhippeda and iievcr to ga

firfl deigned : tbat his firft intent was to have gone ta 
Martinico ; and that he went on hoard a (hip boun<! 
thither, at St»Maloes; but being forced into Lilbon irr 
bad weather, the fhip received fome damage, by running 
agroupd in the mouth of the river Tagus, and was obli- 
ged to unload her cargo there : that finding a Portuguefe 
ihip there, bound to the Madeiras, and ready to fail, and 
fupf)o{ing he Ihould eafily meet with a vefTel there, bound 
to Martinico, he went on board, in order to fail to the 
Madeiras ; but the Mailer of the Portuguefe fhip being 
but an indifferent mariner, had been out in his reckon- 
ing, and they drove to Fial ; where, however, he hap- 
pened to find a very good market for his cargo, whicb 
•was corn ; and therefore refolved not to go to the Ma- 
<leiras, but to load fait at the Ifle of May, to go away to- 
Newfoundland : he had no remedy in the (exigence, but 
to go with the fhip ; and had a pretty good voyage 
as far as the Banks, fo they call the place, where they 
catch the fi(h, 'yvhere meeting with a French ^^ip bound 
from France to Quebec, in the river of Canada, and from 
thence to Martinico, to carry provifions, he thought he 
ihould have an opportunity to complete his firft defign : 
but when he came to Quebec, the mafter of the fhip died, 
and the (hip proceeded no farther : fo the next voyage he 
(hipped himfelf for France, in the (hip that was burnt, 
"when we took them up at fea, and then (hipped them 
wjth us for the Eaft Indies, as J have already faid. Thus 
lie had been difappointed in five voyages, ally as I may 
call it, in one voyage, befides what 1 (hall have occafion 
to mention farther of the fame perfon. 

But I (hall not make digreffions into other men*s 
ftories, which have no relation to ray own. I return 
to what concerns our ??ffair in the ifland : he came to

we were upon the ifland ; and it happened to be jult 
when J was going lo vifit the Engli(hmen;'9 colony, at

"Was the prolperity of my new colony ; and, perhaps,. ,' 
might put it, at lead,, more than he yet thought it was, 
in the way of God's blefling. 

I looked a little furprifed at the laft part of his diH- 
courfe ; and turning a little fhort, how Sir, faid [, can 
it be faid, that we are not in the way of God's blefling, 
after fuch vifiHe afliftance, and wonderful deliverances, 
as we have leen here, and of which I have given you 
a large account ? 

If you had pleafed, Sir, faid he, (with a world of 

modefty,. and yet with great readinefs) to have heard me, 

you would have found no room to have been difpleafed, 

much lefs to think fo hard of me, that I (hould fu^jieft, 

that you have not had wonderful affiilances and delive- 

Tances ;. and, I hope, on your behalf, that you are in the 

wdy of God's blefling^ and your defign is exceeding good, 

and will profper. But, Sir, faid lie, though it were 

more fo, than is even poflible to you, yet there may be 

fome among you, that are not equally right in their 

a6lions : and you know, that in the ftory of Ifrael, one 

Achan, in the camp, removed God's blefling from them, 

and turned his hand fo againft them, that thirty-lix of 

them, though not concerned in the crime, where the 

objedls of divine vengeance, and bore the weight of that 

punifhment. 

I was feniibly touched with this difcourfe, and told 
him his inference was lb juft, and the whole de^gn feem- 
cd fo fincere, and was reall}'- fo religious in its own na- 
ture, that I was very forry I had interrupted him ; and 
begged him to go on : and, in the mean time, becaufe it 
feemed, that what we had both to fay, might take up 
Ibme time, I told him, I was going to the Englifliman's 
plantation, and afked him to go with me, and we might 
difcourfe of it by the way ; he told me, iie would more 
willingly wait on me thither, becaufe there partly the 
thing was afted, which he defired to'fpeak to me about :

] ' neral principles, tho' we may be of fomc differing opv 
nions in the pra6);ice of particulars. Firft, Sir, though: 
we differ in fome of the dodlrinal articles of religion, and 
it is very unhappy that it is fo, efpecially in the cafe 
before us , as 1 (hall (hew afterwards ; yet, there are; 
fome general prin^ioles in which we both agree, vii. 
Firft, that there Is a God ; ^nd that this God, having 
given us fome ftated general rules for our fervice and obe- 
dience, we ought not willingly and knowingly to offend 
him, either by neglectting to do what he has commanded^ 
or by doing what he has exprefsly forbidden ; and let 
our ditferent religions be what they will, this general 
principle is readily owned by us all — that the bleffing 
of God does not ordinarily follow a prefumptuous iin- 
xiing againft his command; and every good Chi^iftiaa 
will be affedbionately concerned to prevent any that are 
under his care living in a total ntgleft of God atid his 
commands. ' It is not your men being proteftants, what- 
ever my opinion may be of fuch, that difcliarges me 
from being concerned for their fouls, and from endea- 
vouring, if it lies before me, that they ihould live in as 
little diftance from, and enmity with their Maker as 
poflible ; efpecially-', if you give me leave ta meddle lb 
far in your circuit* 

I could not yet imagine what he a^med at, and told 
him, I granted all he faid, and thanked him, that he 
■would io for concern himfelf for us ; and begged he 
iwould explain the particulars, erf what he had oblerved,. 
that» like Jofhua, (to take his own parable), I might put 
awav the accurfed thing from us. 

Why then. Sir, lays he, I will take tlic fiberty you; 
^ivc me; and there are three things, which,, if t am 
right, mult fiand in the way of God^s blefllng upon,

me in them all, as^ foon as I name then^-; efpecially, 
becaufe I (hall cpnvinee you-, that every one of thenar 
may, with great eaic, and very much to jojw iatisfao- 
tion, be remedied.

EngKflimen, wbp have fetched women from among the 

favages, and have taken them as their wives, and have 

had many children by them all, and yet arc not married 

to them after any ftated legal manner, as the laws of 

God and man require ; and therefore are yet, in the fenfe 

of both, no lefs than adulterers, and living in adultery. 

To this. Sir, fays he, I know you will objefk, that there 

was no clergyman, or prieft of any kind, or of any 

profefiion, to perform the ceremony; nor any pen ami 

ink, or paper, to write down a contraA of marriage^ 

and have it fighed between them. And I know aUb, 

Sir, what the Spaniard governor has told you ; I mea» 

of the agreement that he obliged them to make when 

they took thefc women, viz.. that they fhould chufe thenn 

out by confent, and keep feparately to them; which, by 

the way, is nothing of a marriage, no agreement with 

the women as wives, but only an agreement amon^ 

themfelves, to keep them from quarrelling. 

But, Sir, the eiTence of the facrament of matrimony 
(fo he called it,, being a Roman), coniiftsnot only in the 
mutual confent of the parties to take one another as man 
and wife, but in the formal and legal obligation that 
there is in the contrail » to compel the man and woman, 
at all times, to own and acknowledge each other ; oblig- 
ing the man to abftain from all other women, to engage 
in no other contradt while thefe fubiift ; and on all occa-^ 
fions, as ability allows,, to provide honeftly for thend and 
their children ; and to oblige the women to do the fame^ 
or li ke conditions, mutatis mutandis, on their lide. 

Now, Sir, fays he, thefe men may, when they pleafe,. 
or when occaiion prefents, abandon thefe women, djf- 
own their children, leave them to perifh, and take other 
women and marry them ' whilft thefe are living. And 
here he added, with fome warmth. How, Sir, is God 
honoured in this unlawful liberty? And how ihall a 
hleijing fucceed your endeavours in this place, however 
good in themfelves, and however fincere in ypur defign^ 
while thefe men, who at prefent are your fubjedts, under 
your abiolute government and dominion, are allowed by 
you tg live in open adultery ? 

I confefs, I was ilruck at the thing itfelf, but much 
vinore with the convincing arguments he iupppcted it 

withi

^Ith ; for it was certainly true, that though they hadnt> 
i:lergyinan on thefpotj-yet a formal contra6t on both 
fides, made before witnefles, and confirmed by any token, 
"which they had all agreed to be bound by, though it had 
been but the breaking; a Itick between them, engragrincr 
the men to own thefe women for their wives upon all 
occaiions, and never to abandon them or their children, 
and the women to the fame with their hufbands, had been 
an etFe6lual lawful marriage in the fight of God ; and it 
was a great neojlecSt that it was not done. 

But I thought to have gotten off with my young prieft^ 
"by telling him, that all that part was done when I was 
not here ; and they had lived fo many years with them 
now, that if it was an adultery, it was pall remedy ; they 
could do nothing in it now. 

Sir, fays he, afking your pardon f6r fach freedom, 
you are right in this ; that it being done in your abfence^ 
you could not be charged with that part of the crime- 
But, I befeech you, flatter not yourfelf, that you are not 
therefore under an obligation to do your uttermoft now 
to put an end to it : how can you think, but that, let 
the time paft lie on whom it will, all the guilt for the 
future will lie entirely upon you ; becaufe it is certainly 
in your power now to put an end to it; and in nobody's 
power but your's. 

I wasfo dull ftill, that I did not take him right ; but I 
imagined, that, by putting an end to it, he meant that I 
fhould part them, and not fuffer them to live together 
any longer; and I faid to hirn, I could not do that by 
any means, for that it would put the whole iiland in con- 
fufion. He feemed furprifed that I fliould fo far mifi;ake 
hijn. No, Sir, fays he, I do not rrieafi that you Ihoukl 
feparate them, but legally and effedtually marry theiia 
now. And, Sir, as my wayW marrying may not be fo 
eafy to reconcile them to, though it will be as effe6lual^ 
even by your owm laws, fo your way may be as w^eii be- 
fore God, and as valid aniong men ; I mean by *b. written,

warmth for the prcferving people that he had no know- 
ledge of, or relation to : 1 fay, for preferving them front 
tranfgreffincr the laws of God, the like of which 1 had, 
indeed, not met with any where. But recoIled:ing what 
he had faid, of marrying them by a written contraft, 
which I knew would Itandtoo, I returned it back upon 
him, and lold him, I granted all that he had faid to be 
juft, and, on his part, very kind : thut I would difcourfe 
with the men upon the point now, when I came to them. 
And I knew no reafon why they ihould fcruple to let 
^him marry them all ; which I knew well enough would 
be granted to be as authentic and valid in England, as 
if they were married by one of our own clergymen.— 
What was afrerwards done in this matter, I (hall fpeak 
of by itfelf. , 

I then preffed him to tell me what was the fecond com* 
plaint which he had to m^ake ; acknowledging that I was- 
very much his debtor for the firft, and thanked hin* 
heartily for it, He told me he would ufe the fame free- 
dom and piainnefs in the fecond, and hoped I would 
take it as well : and this was, that, notwithitanding thefe 
Englilh fubjed:s of mine, as be called them, had lived 
with thefe women for almoft feven years, and "had taught 
them to fpeak Engliih, and even to read it; and that 
they were, as he perceived, women of tolerable under- 
ftanding, and capable of inftruftion; yet they had not 
to this hour taught them any thing of the Chriftian reli- 
gion ; no, not {o much as to know that there was a God, 
or a worihip, or in what manner God was to be ferved ; 
or that their own idolatry, and worftiipping they knew 
not who, was falfe and abfurd. 

This, he faid, was an unaccountable negledt, and 
what God would certainly call them to an amount for j 
and, perhaps, at lall take the work out of their hands. 
He fpoke this very affeclionately and warmly. 1 am per- 
fuaded, fays he, had thofe men lived in the favage coun- 
try, whence their wives came, the favages would have 
taken more pains to have brought them to be idolaters^ 
andto worfhip the devil, than any of thefe men, fo far 
as I can fee, has taken with them, to teach them the

do not acknowledge your religion, or you mine, yet wff 
ihould be all glad to fee the devil's fcrvants, and the fub- 
je6ls of his kingdom, taught to know the general prin- 
ciples of the Chrillian religion ; that they might at lead 
hear of God, and of a Redeemer, and of a Refurredbion, 
and of a future ftate, things which we all believe; they 
had, at leaft, been fo much nearer coming into the bofom 
of the true church, than they are now in the public pro- 
feflion of idolatry and devil- worihip. 

I could hold no longer; I took him in my arms, and 
embraced him with an excefs of palTion : How far, faid 
1 to him, have I been from underftanding the moft eflen- 
tial part of a^Chriftian,. viz. to love the intereft of the 
Ghrifiian church, and the good of other men's fouls. I 
fcarce have known what belongs to being a Chriftian. 
O Sir, do not fay fo, replied he ; this thing is not your 
fault. No ! faid 1, but why did I never lay it to heart 
as well as you ? It is not too late yet, faid he ; be not 
too forward t -> condemn yourfelf. But what can be done 
now ? faid I ; you fee I am going away. Will you give 
me leave, faid he, to talk with thefe poor men about it ? 
Yes, with all my heart, faid I, and will oblige them to 
give heed to what you fay too. As to that, faid he, we 
mu!ft leave them to the mercy of Chrift ; but it is our 
buiinefs to affift them, encourage them, and inftruft them r 
and if you will give me leave, and God his bleffing, I do 
not doubt but the poor ignorant fouls Ihall be brought 
home into the great circle of Chriftianity, if not into the 
jjarticular faith that we all embrace, and that even whilor 
we flay here. Upon this, 1 faid, I (hall not only give 
you leave, but give you a thoufand thanks for it. W hat 
followed on this account 1 fhall mention alfo again in it»

I now prei!ed him for the third article in which we 
-were to blame. Why really, fays he, it is pf the fame 
nature, and I will proceed (aiking your leave) with the 
lame plainnefs as before : it is about your poor fiivagcs 
yonder, who are„ as I may fay, your conquered fubjedls. 
it is a maxim. Sir, that is, or ought to be received 
among all Chriftians, of what church, or pretended 
church foever ; viz. that Chriftian knowledge ought to

the moil hazardous voyages, and the nroft dangerous 

refidence, among murderers and barbarians, to teach 

them the knowledge of the true God, and to bring them 

over to embrace the Chriftian faith. Now, Sir, you 

have ian opportunity here to have fix or feven and 

thirty poor favagcs brought over from idolatry to the 

knowledge of God, their Maker and Redeemer, that 

I wonder how you can pafs fuch an occafion of doing 

good, which is really worth the expence of a man's 

whole life, 

I was now druck dumb indeed, and had not one word 

to fay : I had here a fpirit of true Chriftian zeal for 

God and religion before-me, let his particular principles 

be of what kind foever. As for me, I had not fo much 

as entertained a thought of this in my heart before; 

and, I believe, Ihould not have thought of it ; for I 

looked upon thefe favages as flaves, and people whom, 

had we any work for them to do, we would have \i(ed 

as fuch, or would have been glad to have tranfported 

them to any othier part of the world ; for our bufinefs 

was to get rid of them ; and we would all have been fa-

offended with nobody but my (elf ; but I am perfectly 

confounded, not only to think, that I fhould never take 

any notice of this before, but with reflefting what notice 

I am able to take of it now. You know, Sir, faid I, 

what circuraftances I am in ; I am bound to the Eaft-

it would be an infufterable piece of injuftice to detain

He owned the cafe was very hard upon me as to my 
voyage ; but laid it home upon my confcicncc, whether 
the blefling of faving feven and thirty fouls, was not worth 
my venturing all 1 had in the world for ? I was not fa i 
fenfible of that as he was ; and I returned upon him thus i \ 
Why, Sir, it is a valuable thing indeed, to be an inftru-

fecms naturally to fall into the way of your profcffion, 
how is^ it then, that you do not rather offer yourfelf to

very low bow : I moft heartily thatik God, and you. Sir,

and deiirc me to undertake it, I will moll,readily do it, 
and think : it a happy reward for all the hazards and 
difficulties of fuch a broken difappointed voyage as I 
have met with, that I have dropt at lail into lb gloriotts 
a work. , 

I difcoveped a kind of rapture in his face, while he 
fpoke this to me ; his eyes fparkled like fire, his face 
glowed, and his colour came and went, .aa if he had 
' "been falling into fits : in a word, he was fired with the 
joy of being embarked in fuch a work. I paufed a con- 
fiderable while before I could tell whal to fay to him ; 
jfor 1 was really furprifed to find a man of fuch fincerity 
and zeal, and carried out in his zeal beyond the ordi- 
nary rate of men, notout of his profeffion only, but even 
of any profeffion wbatfoever : bu^ after 1 had coniidered 
it awhile, 1 afked him ferioufly if he was in earneil,

Ml implanted ifland, for, perhaps, his life ; and at laft 
might not know whether he Ihould be able to do theni 
Any good or not. 

He turned fhort upon me, and aflsied nie what T called 

a venture : Pray, Sir, faid be, what do you think 1 eon- 

fented to go in your (hip to the Eajfl Indies for ? Nay, 

faid 1, that I know not, unlefs it was to preach to the 

Indians. Doubtlefs it was, faid he: and do you think, 

if I can convert thefe feven and thirty men to the faith 

of Chriil, it is not worth ray time, though I fhould never 

be fetched ofl' the iflatid again ? Nay, is it not infinitely 

of more worth to fave lb many fouls, than my life is, 

or the life of twenty more of the fame profcffion ? Yes, 

Sir, fays he, I would give Chrift and the blelfed Virghi 

thanks all my days, it I could be made the Icaft happy 

inftrumentof faving the fouls of thcfe poor men, though 

I was never to fet my foot off this idand, or fee my na^ 

tive country* any roore« But fince you will honour me|, 

fays he, with putting me into this work (for which 1 

•will pray^ for you all the days of my life), I .have one 

humble petition to you, fays he, befides.- What is that ? 

faid !• Why, fays he, it is, that you will leave your man 

Friday with nie to be my interpreter to them, aud to alfift 

me ; for, withput fome help, 1 cannot fpeak to them, pr 

they to me. 

I wras fenfibly troubled at bis requefting Friday , becauie 
I could not thinkof parting with him, and that for rhany 
reafons ; he had been the companion of my travels ; he 
was not only faithful to me, but fincercly affediohate to 
the laft degree ; and I had refolved to do fomething con- 
iiderablefbr him, if he outlived me, as it was probable he 
would : then I knew, that as I had bred Friday up to be 
a proteftant, it would quite confound him, to bring hiiu 
to embrace another profeffion ; and he would never^ 
while his eyes were open, believe that his old mafter wa* 
an heretic, and would be damned ;^and this might in the 
end ruin the poor fellow's principlesj^ and fo turn him 
hack again to his originalidolatry. 

However, a fiidden thought relieved me ia this 
ftrait, and it was this : I tbld him I could not lay- 
that 1 was willing to part with Friday on any account 
whatever; though, a work,, tjbiat to him was of more 



116 ADVENtuR£s 6f RaBiNsoR cRtrsoe^ I 

value than his life, ought to me to be of much more 
value than the keeping or parting with a fervant. But, 
on the other hand, I was perfuadecl that Friday would 
b/ no means confent to part with me ; and then to 
force him to it, without his confent, would be a mani- 
feft injuftice; becaufe I had pronrifed I would never 
put him away; anS he had promifed and engaged 
to me, that he woiild never leave me, unlefs I put him 
away. 

lie feemed very much concerned at it ; for he had no 
rational accefs to thefe j>oor people, feeing he did not 
underftand one word of their language, nor they one 
word of his. To remove this difficulty, I told him 
Friday's Father had learned Spanifh, which I found he 
alfo underftood, and he (hould ferve him for an interpre- 
ter ; fo he was rtiuch better fatisfied, and nothing could 
perfuade him but he would ftay to endeavour to convert 
them ; but Providence gave another and very happy turn 
to all this. 

I come back now to the firll part of his obgedHons. 
When we came to the Englilhmen, 1 fent for them all 
together ; and after fome accounts given them of what 
I had done for them, viz. what neceflary things I had 
provided for them, and how they were diftribiited ; 
which they were fenfible of, and very thankful for ; I 
"^eg^n to talk to them of the fcandalous life they led, 
"and gave them a full account of the notice the clergy- 
man had already taken of it ; and arguing bow un- 
chriilian and irreligious a life it was, I nrfl a&ed them 
if they were married men or batchelors } They fbon ex- 
plained their condition to me, and (hewed me that two 
<)f them were widowers, and the other three were fingle 
men or batchelors. I aiked them, with what cpnfcience 
they could take thefe women and lie Ivith them, as 
they had done, call them their wives, and have fo many 
children by them, and not to be lawfully married to 
them ? , ^ 

They all gave me the anfwer that I expefted ; viz* 
that there was nobody to marry them ; that they 
agreed before the governor to keep them as their wives, 
and to keep them, and own them, as their wives ; and 
they thought^ as things ilood with thexn> they were as 



Adventures op robiksqn cruso^. 117 

legally married as if they had been married by a parfon^ 
and with all the formalities in the world, 

I told them, that no doubt they were married in 
the light of God, and were bound in coniclence to 
keep them as their wives ; but that the laws of men 
being bth^rwife, they might pretend they were not mar- 
ried, and lb defert the poor women and children here- 
after^ and that their wives, being poor defolate wo- 
men, friendlefs and moneylefs, would have no way to- 
help th^mfelves. 1 therefore told them, that unlefs I 
was afTured of their honeft intent, I could dp nothing 
for them ; but would take care, that what I did ihould 
be for the women and children, without them ; and 
that unlefs they would give fome aflurances that they 
would marry tne women, 1 could not think it was con- 
yenieat they ihould continue together as man and wife ; 
for that it was both fcandalpus to men, and ofFeniive to 
God, who they could not think would blefs them if they 
went on thus, • / 

All this pafled a6 I expe<9:ed ; and they told mc, efpe- 
cially Will Atkins, who feemed now to fpeak for the 
reft, that they loved their wives as well as if they had 
been born in their own native country, and would not 
leave them upon any account whatever ; and they did 
yerily believe their wives were as virtuous and as modeft, 
and did, to the utmoft of their ikill, as much for them 
and for their children, as any women could poffibly do ; 
and they would not part with them on any account :— 
And Will. Atkins, for his own particular, added, if any 
man would take him away, and offer to carry him home 
to England, and to make him captain of the beft man of 
war in the navy, he would not go with him, if he might 
not cafVy his wife and children with him ; and if there 
was a clergyman in the ^ip^ he would be married ip her 
now, with all his heart. 

This was juft as I would have it ; the prieft was 
not with me at that moment, but was not far off: 
So, to try him farther, 1 told him I had a clergyman 
with me, and if he was fmcere, I would have him 
jnarried the next morning, and bade him coniider of 
it, and talk with the reft : he faid, as for himfclf, he 
-need not coi;ifidcr of it all; for he was very icady to 

do

<Io it, and was glad 1 had a minifler with me ; and he 
believed they would be all willing alfo. 1 then told 
hini, that my friend", the miniiler was a Frenchman^ 
and could not fijeak Englifli ; bot that I would aft the 
clerk between them. He neveif fo much as afked m^ 
whether he was a papitt or a proteftant, which was in- 
deed what I was afraid of; but I fay they never en* 
quired about it ; fo we parted. I went back to my 
clergyman, and Will. Atkins went in^to talk with his 
companions. I defired the French gentleman not to 
fay any thing to thdm till the buiinefi was thoroughly 
ripe; and 1 told him what anfwer.the men had given 
tne. 

Before I went from their quarter, they all came to tre, 
and^told me, they had been confidering what I had 
faid ; that they were very glad to hear 1 had a clergy- | 
man in my ,com[>any ; and they were very willing to 
give me the fa4:isfa6tion I defired, and to be formally 
married as^foon as I. pleafed; for they were far from de- 
■firing -to part with their wives ; and that they meant 
nothing but what' was very honeft when they choie 
them ;, fo I appointed them to meet me the next mornr 
ing ; and that in the mean time they fhould let their 
wives know the meaning of the marriage-law, apd that 
it was not only to prevent any fcandal, but alfo to oblige 
them, that they fhould not forfake them, whatever might 
happen. 

The women were eafily made feniible of the rhean- 
ing of the thing," and were very well fatisfied with it, 
as, indeed, they had reafon to be ; fo they failed not 
to attend all together at ray apartment the next morn- 
ing, where I brought oiit my clergyman ; and though 
he had not on a minifter's gown after the manner of 
England, or the habit of a prieli, after the manner of 
France, yet having a black veft, fomething like a caf- 
fock, with a faflircund it, he did not look very unlike 
a minifter; and as for his language, I was his inter- 
preter. 

But the ferioufncfs of his behaviour to them, and the 
fcruplps he made of marrying the women, becaufe they 
^ere not baptized, and profefTed Chriftians, gave theiH 
an exceeding reverence for his pcrfon ; and there was no 

need 



• ADVENTURES Of ROBINSON CRUSOE. 119 

need after that to enquire whether he was a clergyman 
ot no. 

In^leed I was afraid his fcruple would have been car- 
ried fo far, as that he would not have married them at 
all ; pay, notwithftanding all 1 was atle to fay to him, 
he red fled me, though modeftly, yet very fleadily ; and 
at laft refufed abfolutely to marry them, unlefs he had 
firft talked with the men, and the women too : and 
though at firft I was a little backward to it, yet at laft I 
agreed to it with a good will^ perceiving the fincerity of 
his defiofn". 

When he came to them, he let them know that I had 
acquainted him with their circumftances, and with the ' 
prefent deftcrn ; that he was very willing to perform that 
part of his fundlion, and marry them, as. I had deCred ; 
but that before he could do it, he muft take the liberty 
to talk with thettr. He told them, that in the fight of 
all different men, and in thefeu(/2 of the laws of fOciet}^, 
they had lived ail this while in an open adultery; and 
that it was true, that nothinof but the corifeuting: to 
marry, or efFe(flually feparating them from one another, 
now could put an end to it ; but there was a difficulty 
in it too, with refpe6l to the laws of Chriftian matri- 
mony, which he was not fully fatislied about, viz. that- 
of marrying one that Is a profefled Chriftian, to a favage, 
an idolater, and a heathen, one that is not baptized; and 
yet that he did not fee that, there was time left for it, to 
endeavour to perfuade the women to be baptized, or to 
profefs the name of Chrift, w,hom they had, he doubted, 
heard nothing of, and without which they could not be 
baptized. 

He told me,~ he doubted they were but indifferent 
Chriflians themfelves ; that they had but little know- 
leclge of God or his ways, and therefore he could not 
cxpe<^ that they had faid much to their wives on that 
head yet ; but that unlefs they would promife him to 
nfe their endeavours with their wives, to perfuade them 
to become Chriftians, and would as well as they could, 
inftrudb them in the knowledge and belief of God that 
made them, and to worfhip Jefus Chrift that redeemed 
them, he could not marry them ; for he would have 
&0 hand in joining Chriftians with favages; nor was

it coniiftent with the principles of the Chriilian ne-» 
Tigion; and was indeed cxprefsly forbidden in God*» 
law. . ■ ' ' 

They heard all this very attentively, and I delivered 
it very faithfully to them from his mouth, as near his 
own words as I could, only fometimcs ^ding fome-* 
thing of my own, to convince them how juft it was, 
and how I was of his mind ; and I always very faith- 
fully <!iftinorui{hed between what I faid from myfclf, 
und what were the clergyman's words. They told 
me it was very true what the gentleman had -Yaid, 
that they were but very indifFerent Chriftians them- 
ielves, and that they had never talked to their wives 
about religion. Lord, Sir, fays Will. Atkins, how 
fhouM we teach them religion ? Why, wc know nothing 
ourfelves ; and befides. Sir, faid he fhould we go to talk 
to them of God and Jefus Chrift, and heaven and hell, 
'twould but make them laugh at us, and afk us what we 
believe ourfelves? and if we fliould tell them, we be- 
lieve all the things that we fpeak of to them, fuch as 
of good people going to heaven, and wicked people 
to the devil, they would alk us, where we intended to 
go ourfelves, who believe all this, and yet are fuch 
wicked fellows, as indeed we arc? Why, Sir, {aid Will, 
' 'tis enough to give, them a furfeit of religion at firft 
hearing. Folks muft have fbme religion themfelves 
before they pretend to teach other p£ople.— Will 
Atkins, faid I to him, though I am afraid what you fay 
has too unueh truth in it, 5^et can you not tell your 
wife that ihe is in the wrong ? That there is a God, 
and a religion better than her own ; that her gods are 
idols, that they can neither hear nor ipeak ; that there 
IS a great Being that made all things, and that can de- 
iboy all that he has made ; that he rewards the good, 
and puniflies the bad ; that we are to be judged by him 
at laft for all we do here ; you are not fo ignorant, but 
even nature itfelf will teach you, that all this is true ; 
and I am fatisficd you know it all to be true, and believe 
it yourfetf. 

That's true, Sir, faid Atkins ; but with what face can 
I fay any thing to my wife of all this, when ihe will tell 
xne immediately, it cannot be true ? 

Not 



ADV^MTtJRES Ot RQBTMSOM CRUSOt. \^t 

Not true ! faid I ; what A> you mean by that ? Why 
Sir, faid he, Ihe will tell me it cannot be true that this 
God (I fh all tell her of) can b&juft, or can puni(h, or 
reward, (ince I am not ptiniflied, and fent to the devil^ 
that have been fuch a wicked creature as (he knows I 
have been, even to her, and to every body elfe, and that 
I (hould be fufFered to live, that have been aFways a(9:ing 
^0 contrary to what I mud tell her is good, and to what 
I ou^ht to have done. 

Why truly, Atkins; faid 1, 1 am afraid thou fpeaked 
too RKich truth ; and with that I let the clergyman know 
what Atkins had faid ; for he was impatient tO/ know :— 

! faid the pried, tell hi tt\ there is one thing will make 
him the bed minider in the world to his wite, and that 
is repentance ; for npne t^ach repentance li)ce true peni- 
tents ; he wants nothing, t^^t to,i%pent, and then he will 
be fo much the better qualified to indru^ his wife ; he 
will then be able to tell her, that t\itTt is not only a God, 
and that he is thejud re warder of good and evil; but 
that he is a itiercifui being, and, with infinite good* 
aefs and long-fuif'ering, forbears to punifli thpfe that of- 
fend ; waiting to be gratHous, and willing not the death 
of a (inner, but rather that he (hould return and live ; 
that he often fuffers wicked men to go on a long time, 
and even re(erves damnation to the general day of retri- 
bution ; that it is a clear evidence of God^ and of a 
future itate, that righteous men receive not their reward, 
o^ wicket! men their puni(hment, till they come into 
another world ; and this will lead him to teach his wife 
the do(%nhe of the refurre6Hon, and of the lad judg- 
ment ; let him but repent for himfelf, he will \iQ an es;* 
Cellent preacher of repentance to his wife. • 

I repeated all this to Atkins, who looked yery (ertoiis 
all the while, and Who, we could eaiily perceive, was 
more than ordinarily aife<5ked with it ; when be^ng eager, 
and hardly fuflTerihg me to make an end : I knew all 
this, mafter, fays he, and a great deal more ; but 1 han*t 
the impudence to talk thus to my wife ; when G id, and 
my own cojifcience knows, and my wife w.ll be an 
undeniable evidence againft ^\e, that I have li .ed as if 

1 had never heard of God, pr a future date, or any 
thing about it, and to talk of my repeating, alas ! (and

-with that he fuelled a deepfigh; and I coiild fee that 
tears flood in his eyes) *tis pad all that with me. Paft ' 
it ! Atkins, faid I, What doft thou mean by that ? I know 
well enough what I mean. Sir, fays he ; 1 mean 'tii too 
late ; and that is too true. 

I told my clerg5aTian, word for word, what he faid; 
the poor zealous pried (I muft call him fo ; for be his 
opinion, what it will, he had certainly a molt fingular 
afi'edlion for the good of other men's fouls; and it would 
be hard to think he had not the like for his own ; I fay, 
this zealous affe«5lionate man) could not refrain tears alfo ; 
but, recovering himfelf, he faid to me, Afk him but one 
queftion, Is he eafy, that it is too late, or he is troubled, 
jind wiflies it were not fo ? I put the queftion fairly to 
Atkins ; and he anfwered with a great deal of paffion, 
How could any man be eafy in a condition that cer- 
tainly muil end in eternal deftrudtion ! that* he was far 
from being eafy ; but that, on the contrary, he believed 
it would one time or other ruin him. 

What do you mean by that? faid I. Why, he faid, 
*he believed he (hould, onetime or other, cut his own 
throat, to nut an end to the terror of it- 

The clergyman fhbok hia head^ with great concern 
in his face, when I told him all this ; but, turning quick 
to me upon it, faid, if that be his cafe, you may affure 
him it is not too late ; Chrift will give him repentance ; 
but pray, fays he, explain this to him. That as no man 
is faved but by Chriil, and the merit of his paffion, 
procuring divine mercy for him, how can it be too \Ate 
for any man to receive mercy ? Does he think he is 
able to fin beyond the power or reach of divine mercy ? 
Pfay tell him. There may be a time when provoked 
mercy will no longer firive, and when God may refufe 
to hear, but that *tis never too late for men to afk mer- 
cy ; and we that are C'hrift's fervant's are commanded to 
preaph mercy at all times, in the name, of Jefus Chrid, 
to all thofethat iincerely repent ; fo that 'tis dever too 
late to /cpent. 
' 1 told Atkins all this, and he heard me with great 
carneftnefs ; but it feemed as if he turned off the dif- 
coib-ie to the reft ; for he faid to me, he would go and 
have Ibme talk with his wife ', fo iie, went out awhile 

and

and we walked to the reft. I perceived they were all 
ftupidly ignorant, as to matters of religion ; much as I 
^vas when 1 went rambling away from my father ; and 
yet that there were Hone of them backward to hear what 
Ifad been faid, and all of them ferioully promifed that 
they would talk with their wives about it, and do their 
endeavour to perfuade them to turn Chriftians. 

The clergyman fmiled upon me, when I reported what 
aiafwer they gave, but faid nothing a good while ; but, 
at laft, (haking his head. We that are Chrift's ferVantsj 
fays he, can go no further than to exhort and inftrudl ; 
and when men comply, fubmit to the reproof^ and pro- 
mife what we afk, *tis all we can do ; we are bound to 
accept their good' words : but, believe me. Sir, foid he^ 
whatever yT)u may have known of the life of that man 
you call William Atkins, I believe he is the only,{incere 
convert among them ; I take that man to be a true peni- 
tent; I won't defpair of the reft ; but that man is per- 
fed:ly ftruck with the fenfe of his.paft life ; and I doub£ 
not, but when he comes to talk of religion to his wife, 
he^mll talkhimfelf effedually into it ; for attempting to 
teach others is fometimes the beft way of teaching our- 
felves. I knew a man, added he, who, having nothing 
but a fummary notion of religion himfelf, and being 
wicked and profligate, to the laft degree, in his life, made 
a thorough reformation in himfelf, and being to convert , 
a Jew; and if that poor Atkins begins but once to talk 
ferijoudy of Jefus Chrift to his wife, my life for it, hc- 
talks himfelf into a thorough convert, makes himfelf a 
penitent, and who knows what may :ollow ? , ^ 

Upon this difcpurfe however, and their promifing, as 
above, to endeavour, to perfuade their wives to embrace 
ChrilUanity, he married the other three couple ; but 
Will Atkins and. his wife w^re not yet come in : after 
this, my clergyman, waiting awhile, was curious to 
know where Atkins was gone ; and, turning to me, fays 
he, I intreat you, Sir, let us walk out" of your laby- 
rinth herie and look : 1 dare fay we ihall find this poor 
man fomcwhere or other, talking ferioufly with his wife, 
and teaching her already fomething of religion. I

my Pel f, and where the trees were fo thick fet, as that 
it was not cafy to fee through the thicket of leaves, an4 
far harder to fee in, than to fee out; when coming 
to the edge of the wood, I faw Atkins, and his tawny 
favage wife, fitting under the (hade of a bu(h, very 
eager in difcourfe ; I ftoppcd ihort, till my clergjrman 
came up to me ; and then, having ihewed him where 
they were, we (lood and lookcd'^ery, ftettdily ^ th»cm a 
good while. . '^ / '"' ' ..:> ^"/ ■'' ' r« ■ ) -^ 

We obferved him very earned with her, pointing up 
to the' fun, and to every quarter of the heavens; vthen 
<Jown to the earth, then out to the fea, then to himfdf, 
fhen to her, to the woods, to the trees. Now, fays my 
clergvman, you fee my words are made good ; the man 
preaches to her ; mark him, now he is telling her that 
our God has made him, and her, and the heavens, the 
earth, the lea, the woods, thfi trees. &c. I belfeve he is, 
faid I : immediately we perceived Will Atkins ilart upon 
his feet, fall down upon his knees, and lift up both his 
hands : we fuppofe he faid fomething, but we could not 
he^r him ; it ws^ too far for that : he did not continue 
kneeling half a minute, but comes and lits down again 
by his wife, and talks to her again. We pierccivcd then 
the woman very attentive ^ but whether (he faid any 
thing or no, wc could not tell. While the poor fellow 
was upon his knees, 1 could fee the tears run plentifully 
down my clergyman's cheeks ; and I could hardly for- 
bear myfelf; but it was a great afHiAion to us both, 
that we wefc not near enough to hear any thing that 
pafled between them. 

Well, however,' wc tould come no nearer, for fear of 
difturbing them : fo wc rcfolvcd to fee an end of this 
piece of fiill converfation ; and it fpok^ loud enough 
to us, without the help of voice ; he fat down again, as 
I have faid, clofe by her, and talked again earnedly to 
hfer ; and two or three times we could i'ee him embrace 
her pafTionately : another time we law him take out his 
handkerchief, and wipe her eyes, and then kifs her 
agam with a kind of tranfport very unufual : and after 
feveral of thefe things, we faw him on a fudden jump 
tip again, and lend her his hand to help her up, when 
immediately, leading her by |tlie h^nd a ftep or two, 

they 



they both kneeled down together, and continued ^ abotH 
two minutes. 

. My friend could bear it no longer, but cries out alouJ, 
St, Paul, St. Paul ! behold he prayeth : I was fraid 
Atkins would hear him ; therefore I in treated him to 
withhold himfelf a while, tbat we might fee an end of 
the Icene,- which to me, 1 rouft confeis, was the mo't 
affeAing, and yet the moft agreeable, that ever 1 faw ia 
my life. Well, he drove with himfelf, and containei - 
himfelf for a while, but was in fuch raptures of joy to 
think that the' poor heathen woman was become a cnrif- 
tian, that he was not able to contain himfelf: he wept 
feveral tirhes ; then throwing up his hands and croffing 
his breaft, faid over feveral things ejacuiatory, and by 
way of giving God thanks for fo miraculous a teftimony 
of th^ fuccefs of our endeavours ; fome he fpoke foftly, 
and 1 could not well hear, others audibly, fome in La- 
tin, fome in French ; then two or three times the tears 
of joy would interrupt him, that he could not fpeak 
at all. But I begged that he would compofe himfelf, 
and let us' more narrowly and fully obferve what was 
before us, which he did for a time, and. the fcene was 
not ended there yet ; for,, after the poor man and his 
wife were rifen agaki from their knees, we obferved he 
Hood talking Hill eagerly to her ; and we obferved by her 
motion that ike was greatly afFe6led with what he faid^

It may be fo, faid be, I know not what they might

is no herefy in too much charity. 

Well, as Will Atkips and bi» wife were gone, our 
butinefs there was over ; fo we went back our own 
way ; and when we came back» wc found them wait- 
ing to be called in. Obfer^ing this^, I a(kcd ray clergy-

not ; but that we ihould talk to him firft, and hear 
what he would fay to us ; ' fo we called him in alone, 
nobody being in the place but ourfelves ; and I begun 
with him thus : 

Will Atkins, fjiid I, prithee what education had you I 
What was your father ? \ 

' W. A. A better man than ever I (hall be. Sir, my 
father was a clergyman. 

R. C, What education did he give yon ? 

W^.. A. He would have. taught me well. Sir; but I 
defpifed all education, in(tru6bon, or corre^ton^ like a 
beaft as I was. , , 

R.C It is true^ SoIomoA'&ys, lie that dcQ)iieth re- 
proof is brutiih. 

W. A. Ay, Sir, I was brutiih indeed ; I murdered 
my father ! for God's fake. Sir, talk no mor^ about that» 
Sir ! I murdered my poor father 1 , - 

Priefl. Ha ! a murderer !* 

* Here the priefl fiarted (for I interpreted evciy 
word as he fpoke it) and looked pale. It feems 
he believed that Will had really killed his own 
father. 

H . C. No, no, Sir, I do not uaderfland him £6 ; Will 
Atkins explain yourfelf; you did not kill your t£ather, 
did you, with your own hands? 

W. A. No, Sir; i did not cut his throat; but I

turn for the moil tender afFeftionate treatment that ever 
father gave, or child could receive. 

R. C. Well, I did not a(k you about your father, to 
extort this confefllon; I pray God give you repentance 
for it, and forgive you that, and all your other fins ; but 
I afked you, becauTe I fee that thuu^^h you have not 
much learning, yet you are not fo ignorant as fome are 
in things that are good ; that you have known more of 
religion a great deal than you have pradifed. 

W. A. Though you, Sir, did not extort the confeflion 
that I made about my father, confcience does.; andr 
whenever we i-.orae to look back upon our lives, the iina 
againft our indulgent parents are certainly the firft that 
touch us ; the wounds they make' lie deepeft, and the 
weight they leave will lie heavieft upon the mind of arf 
the fin» we may commit. 

R. C. You talk too feelingly and fenfible for me, At- 
kins ; I cannot hear it* 

W. A. You bear it, mailer I I dare lay you know 
nothing of it. 

R. C. Yes, Atkins, every /hore,. every hill, nay, 1 
may fay, every tree in this ifland is witnefs to the an- 
guifh of my foul, for my ingratitude, and bafe ufage of 
a good tender father ; a father much like four's, by 
your defcription : and I murdered my father as well aa^ 
you. Will Atkins: but think, for all that, my repen- 
tance i& Ihort of your's too* by a great deal* 

* I would have faid more^ if I coi^ld have retrained 
my pafliona; but I thought this poor man's repen- 
tance was fo much iincerer than mine^ that I was 
going to leave off the difcourfe^ and retire ; for I 
was fvM-prifed with what he faid, and thought that» 
indead of my going about ta leach and inftrui^t him,, 
the man was made a teaches and inllruftor to me» 
in a moft furprifing axid unex^Aed manner* ' 

I laid all this before the young clergyman, who was

pbfed myfeif, I renewed my difcourfe with Will Atkins* 

But, Will, faid 1, How comes the fenfe of this matter 
to touch you juft now ? , 

^ W. A. Sir, you have fet me ahout a work that has 
ftruck a dart- through my very foul ; I have been talking 
about God and religion to my wife, in order, as you 
diredled me, to make a chriftian of her ; and {he has 
preached fuch a (ermon to me, as I (hall never forget 
while I live. , 

R. C. No, no, it is not your wife has prfeached to you^ 
but when you were moving religious arguments to her,' 
confcience has flung them back upon you. 
^ W. A. Ay, Sir, with fuch a force as it is not to be 
Kfifted. 

■ R. C. Pray, Will, let us know what pafled between 
you and your wife ; for I know fomething of it aW 
ready. ! • ' 

W. A. Sir, it is impoflible to give you a full account 
of it ; I am too full to hold it ; and yet have no tongue to 
f:3cprefs it; but let her have faid what fhe will, and 
though I cannot give you an account of it, this 1 can 
tell you of it, that I refolve to amend and reform my 
life. 

R. C. But, tell us fomc; of it. How did you begia 
Will ? For this has been in extraordinary cafe^ that is. 
certain ;' ihe has preached a fermoa indeecl,. if ihe has 
wrought this' tipcinyott. ^ r . 

W. A. Why, 1 fir^ told her the nature of onj laws 
about martia^, and .what '\he rfeafons were that men 
and wromen were' Obliged to 'enter into'fudi compads 
is it was Tvfeither in the power of one or other to break ;^

and men would i"un from their wives,* and abandon their 
children, nfiix confiifedljwith one another, and neither 
faihilies be kept entire, or inheritances be fettled by a 
legal defcent. 

R. C. You talk Irkc a Civijian, WiH. ConlA ypn

families^?. They know no fach thing among the favages^ 
but marry any how, without any regard to relation^

wife aifures me of the contrary, and that they, abhor it ; ' 
perhaps, for any further relation.^, the ^uay u t be fo 
e^aft as we are; but Ihe tells me they never touch one 
another in the near relation you fpeak of. 

R. C- Well, what did fhe fay to what you told her ? 

W. A. She faid flie liked it very well, and it wsfs 
much better than in her country, 

R. C. But did you tell her what marriage was ? 

W. A. Ay, ay> there beean all our dialogue. I aflced 
her, if (he would be married to me our way ? She afked 
me. What way that was ? I told her marriage was ap- 
pointed of God ; and here we had a llrange talk together, 
indeed, as ever man and wife had, I believe. 

N. B. This dialogue between W. Atkins and his 
wife, as I took it down in writing, juft after h« 
told it me, was as follows : 

Wife. Appointed by your God I Why, have you a 
Qod in your country ^ 

W. A. Yes^ my dear, God is is in every country. 

Wife. No ; your God in my country : my country

there was no God in heav^en, oi: that he had no power 
on earth. 

Wife. But why God fct you^ db lb ^ Why he no

the reproach of his own carriage would make moil

The poor fellow was in fuch an agony at her deiiring

die nature of faith in him, and the redemption by him : 
of the holy fpirit, the refurre^ion, the laft judgment^ 
and a future (late. 

, I called Will Atkins again, and afked him; but the 
poor fellow fell immediately into tears, and told us, he 
hdd faid foniething to her of all thofe things, but that 
he was himfelf fo wicked a greature, and his own confci- 
ence fo reproached him with his hoi rid ungodly life, that 
he trembled at the apprehenfions, that her knowledge o£ 
him ihould leflen the attention ihe (hould give to thofe. 
things, and make her rather contemn religion, than re- 
ceive it ; but he was afTuredy he faid, that her mind was 
it^ difpoied to receive due impreffions of all thofe things, 
that if I would but difcourfe with her, ihe would makfr^ 
it appear to my fatisfadUon, that my labour would not be 
loft upon her. 

Accordingly I icalled her in, and placing myfelf as in* 
terpreter between rt\y religious prieft and the woman, I 
intreated him to begin with her ; but fure fuch a fermoa 
was never preached by aPopifh prieft in theiie latter age$ 
of the world ; and, as I told him', I thought he had all 
the zeal, all the knowledge, all the fincerity of a Chriftian^ 
without the errors of a Roman Catholic : and that I took 
^im to be fuch a clereyman as the Roman biihop^ were» 
before the church of Home aflunted fpiritu^l fovereigaty

that the man might not perceive he was of the Roman . 
church, if [^offible, becaufc of other ill confequences 
which might attend a difference among us in that very 
religion which we were inftrufting the other in. He told 
me, that as be had no confecratcd chapeK »or proper 
things for the office, I ihould fee he would do it in a 
manner, that I (hould not know by it^ that he was a 
Roman Catholic myfelf, if I had not known it before ; 
and fo he did, for faying only fome words over to him- 
felf in Latin, which I could not underftand, hepoured ^

As foon as this was over, he married them ; and after

goodnefs, gave them the benedidtion again, I repeating 
every thing to them in Engliih : and thus ended the 
ceremony. I think it was the moil pleafant agreeable 
day to me that ever I pafled in my whole life. 

But my clefgyman had not done yet ; his thoughts 
hung continually upon the converfation of the 37 favages ; 
and fain he would have flaid upon the ifland to have un- 
dertaken it ; but I convinced him, Firft, that his under- 
taking was inpradticable in itfelf ; and ^dly, that pcf-*- 
haps, I could put it into a way of being done, in his 
abfence, to hi;? fatisfadlion, of which by and by. 

Haying tl\us brought the affair of the ifland to a nar-» 
row com^afs, I was preparing to go on board the ihip, 
when the young man, whom I had taken out of the 
famiflied (hip's company, canie to me, and told me, he 
underftood I had a clergyman with me ; and that I had 
caufed the Engliflimen to be married to the favages, 
whom they called wives; that he had a match too, which 
he defired might be finilhed before I went, between 
two Chriftians ; which, he hoped, would not be dlf-^ 
agreeable to me. 

I knew this muft be the young woman who was his 
pother's fervant, for there was no other chriltian woman 
on the ifland ; fb I began to perfuade him not to do any 
thing of that kind raflUy» pr becaufe Jie found himlelf 
in this folitary circumllance : 1 reprefented, that he had 
fome confiderablefubftance in the world, and good friends, 
as I underftood by hirnfelf^ and py his maid alfo ; that 
the maid was not qnly poor, and a fervant, but was 
unequal to him, fhe bcmg 26 or 27 years old; an3 
he not above 1? or 18 ; that he might,^' very probably^ 
with my afliilance,. niake a remove frorn this wi^dernefs^ 
and come into his own country again ; and that then it 
ivould be a thoufahd to one but he would repent hi^ 
choice, and the diflike of that circumftance might be 
difadvantageous to both, I v^ras going tp fay rriore, but 
te interrupted me, (milirtg, and tpld me, wi;h a great, 
deal of mpdcfty, thdt I millook in'my gueffes, that he 
had nothing of that kir^d in his thoughts, his prefent 
tircumllances^ being melancholy and difcon folate enough^

and that nothing (hould have fet him upon ftaying there, 
but that the voyage I was going was fp exceeding long 
and hazardous, and would carry him quite out pf the 
reach of all his friends, but he had nothirig to defire of 
me, but that I would fettle him in ibme little property 
in the ifland where he was, give him a fervant or two, 
and fome few necefTaries, and he would fettle himfelf 
^here like a planter, waiting the good time when, if ever 
i returned to England^ I would redeem him, andjjioped 
I would not be unmindful of him when I came to t-ng- 
land, that he would give me fome letters to his friends in 
London,^ to let them know how good I had beeii to him, 
and what part of the world, and what circumftances I 
had left him in ; and he promifed me, that whenever I 
redeemed him, the plantation, and all the improvements 
he had made upon it, let the value be what it would, 
ihould be wholly mine. 

His difcourfe was very prettily delivered, confidering 
his youth, and was the more agreeable to noe, becaufe 
he told me pofitively the match viras not for himfelf. 
J gave him all poffiblc alTurances, that if I lived to come 
fafe to England, I would deliver his letters, and do his 
tufinefs etfe6iually, and that he might depend I would 
never forcret the circumflances 1 left him in : but ftill I 
was impatient to know who was the perfon to he married : 
iipon which he told me, it was iny Jack of all Trades 
and his maid Sufan* 

I was rnoli agreeably furprifed when he named the 
inatch ; for, iiideed, I had thought it very iuitable, The 
charadter of that man I have given already ; and as for 
the maid, (he was a very honeft^ modett, (bber, and 
teligious young woman; had a very good (hare of fcnfc, 
was agreeable enough in her perfon, fpoke very hand- 
fomely, and to the purpofe, always with decency •end 
good manners, and not backward to fpeak whe^ any 
thing required it, or impertinently forward to fpeak when 
it was not her bulinefs ; very bandy and houfe-wifely in 
any thing that was before her ; ^n excellent manager, 
and fit indeed to have been govern efs to the whole iiland; 
fhc knew very well how to behave herfelf to all kind of 
folks {he bad about her, and to better, if ihe had found 
any there.

ABVENTUHES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 141 

The match being propofcd in this manner, wc mar- 
i"ied them the fame day, and as I was father at the ahar, 
as I may fay, and gave her away, fo I gave her a per- 
tion, for t appointed her and her h^fband a handfome 
large fj)acc 6f ground for their plantation ; and, indeed, 
this match and the propofal the young gentleman made 
to me, to give him a fmall property in the iiland, put me 
upon parcelling it out among them,, that they might not 
^aarrel afterwards about their l^tuati on. 

This iharing out the land to them I left to Will At- 
kins, who, indeed, was now grown a mod fober, grave, 
managing fellow, pcrfe^ly reformed, exceeding pious and 
religious, and, as far ad I may be allowed to Ipeak poii- 
tivcly in fuch a cafe, I verily believe, was a true lincere 
penitent. 

He divided things fo juftly, and fo much to every one's 
fatisfadtion, that they only defired one general writing 
under my himd for the whole ; which I caufed to be 
drawn np, and figned and fealed to them, fetting out the 
bounds and Situation of ervery man*s plantation, and teili- 
fying, that I gave them thereby, feverally, a right to 
the whole poffeffion and inheritance of the rcfpedlive 
plantations of farms, with their improvements, to them 
and their heirs ^ referving all the red of the ifland as my 
own properly, and a certain rent for every, particular 
plantation, after eleven }'ears, if 1 or any one from 
me, or in my name, came to demand it^, producing an 
attested copy of the fame writing. 

As to government and laws among them, I told 
them, I was not capable of giving them better rutes 
than they were able to give thcmfelvcs ; only made 
them promife mt to live m loye and good neighbour- 
hood with one another: and fo i prepared^ to leave 
them. 

One thing I mud not omit, and that is : that being 
ROW fettled in a kind of commonwealth among thcrTi* 
felves, and having much butineis in hand, it was but 
odd to have feven and thirty Indians lire in a nook of the 
ifland, independent, and, indeed, unemployed ;f for, 
excej>ting the providing themfelves food, which they 
had difficulty enough in fometimes, they had no manner 
of bufinefs or property to manage. 1 propofed thcfe-

fore to iht governor Spaniard, that he (hould go to tlieiti 
•with Friday's father and propofe to them to remove 
aixl either plant for themfclves, or take them into tlieii 
feveral families as fervants, to be maintained for theii 
labour, but without being abfolute Haves, for I wouk 
not admit them to make them flaves by force, by an] 
means, becaufe they had their liberty given by capitula 
tion, and, as it were articles of fiirrender, which the} 
ought not to break. 

'J'hey mod willingly embraced the propofal, and cami 
all very cheerfully along with him ; fo we allotted then 
land and plantations, which three or four accepted qf 
but all the reft chofe to be employed as fervants in th< 
feveral families we tad fettled ; and thus my colony wa 
in a manner fettled as follows :— the Spaniards pofieflec 
my original habitation, which was the capital city, an( 
extended their plantation all along thelide of thp brook 
"which made the creek that I have fo often defcribed, a 
far as my bower, ,and as they inrreafed their culture, i 
•went always eailward ; the Englifti lived in the north- 
eaft part, where Will Atkins and his comrades began 
and came on fouthward and fouth-wefl, towards th< 
back part of the Spaniards, and every plantation had s 
great addition of land to take in, if they found occa- 
iion^ fp that they need not joftle one another for wan 
of room. 

All the well end of the ifland was left uninhabited 
that if any of the favages (hould come on ihore there onlj 
for their ufual Cuftomary barbarities, they might com< 
and go ; if they difturbed nobody, nobody would diflurl 
them ; and • no doubt, but they were often a(hore, am 
went away agaita ; for 1 never heard that the planter 
were ever attacked and difturbed any more/ 

It now came into my thougnts, that I had hinted t< 
my friend' the clergyinan, that the work of comvertin^ 
the favages might, perhaps, be fet on foot in hi 
ab fence to his fatisfaftion; and I told him, that nov 
I thought it was put in a fair way : for the favage 
being thus divided among the C'hriftians, ifthey w^ouh 
but every one of them dp their part with thofe whicl 
came under their hands, I hoped it might have a vcrj 
^ood cffeft, '

He agreed prefeotly in that, if, faid h6, they will do 
their part. But how^ fays he, how (hall we obtain that 
of them? I told him, we ihoulcfcall them all tbofe- 
ther, and leave it \f\ charge with them, or go to tbenl 
one by- one, which we thought bed; fo we divided i< ; 
lie to fpeak to the Spaniards who were all papifts, and 
I to the Engli(h who were all proteftants ; and we re- 
commended it cameilly to them, and make them pro- 
mife, that they would never make any diftinftion of pa- 
pift or-proceftant, in their exhorting the favages to turn 
Chriftians, but teach them the general kno wtedge of 
the true God, and of their Saviour Jefus Chrili : and 
they like wife promifed us, that they wotild never Have 
any differences or <Urputes, one with another, about 
telioricm. 

When I came to Will Atkins's houfe, (f may call it 
fo, for fuch a houfe, or fuch a piece of balket-work, I 
believe was not ftanding in the world again!) I fay, 
when I came thither, I found the young wonlan I have 
mentioned above and Will Atkins*s wife were become 
intimates, and this prudent, religious young woman, 
had perfected the work Will Atkins had begun ; and 
though it was not above four days after what I have 
related, yet the new baptized fa vagfe woman was made 
fuch a Chriflian, as I have feldom heard of any like 
h^r, in all my obfervation or converfation in the 
"World. 

It came next into my mind, in the morning, before 
I went to them,* that among all the needful things I 
had to .leave with them, 1 had not left a bible : in wHich 
I (hewed, myfelf lefs coniidering for them, than my good 
friend the widow was for me, when fhe fent tne the 
cargo of 1 001. from Lifbon, where (he packed up three 
bibles and a prayer-book. However, the good woman's 
charity had a greater extent than ever Ihe imagined, 
for .they were referved for the comfort and inftru6lioii 
of thofe that made much better ufc of them than I had 
done. . ■ 

I took one of the bibles in niy pocket, and whert 
I came to William Atkins's tent or houfe, I found 
the young woman, and Atkins's baptized wife, had 
teen difeourfing of religion together ; (for W^illiam At-

kins told it tne, with a great deal of joy) I aiked, if 
they were together now? Atid he faid, yes : fo I went 
into the houfe, and he with me, and we found them 
together very earneft in diicourle : O, Sir, fays William 
Atkins, when God has (inn(rs to reconcile to himfelf, 
and aliens to hring home, he never wants a mef- 
fenger: my wife has got a new initm^rr : I knew 
I was unworthy, as I was incapable of that work: 
that young woman has been fent hither from heaven : 
ihe is enough to copvert a whole illand of favagcs. 
The young woman bluflied, and rofe up to go awaj» 
but I defired her to (it dill ; I told her (he had a good 
work upon her hands, and I hoped God would blefs 
her in it. 

We talked a little, and I did not perceive they had 
any book among them, though I did not aik ; but I put 
my hand in my pocket, ?nd pulled out my bible : Here, 
faid I to Atkins, I have brought you an afliilant, that, 
perhaps, you had not before. The man was fo ccn- 
founded, that he was not able to fpeak for fome time ; 
but recovering himfelf, he takes it with both his hands, 
and turning to hLs wife, here, my dear, fays he, did 
not I tell you, our God, though he lives above, could 
hear what he faid ? Here is the book t prayed for, 
when you and 1 kneeled down under the bufh : now 
God has heard us and fent it. When he had faid thus, 
the man fell into fuch tranfports of a paffionate joy^ 
that between the joy of having it, and giving Cod 
thanks for it, the tears- ran down his face Uke a child 
that was crying. 

The woman was furprifed, and was like to have 
run into a miftake, that, none of ns were aware of; 
for ihe firmly belieted Gocl had fent the book upon her 
hufband's |ietition. It is true, that providentially it 
was (b, and might be taken fo in a confequent fenfe : 
but I believed it would have been no difficult mattei;, at 
that time, to have perfoaded the poor ^woman to have 
believed, that an exprefs meflenger came from heaven, 
^n purpofe to bring that individual book : but it was 
too fcrious a matter, to fuffer any delufion to take 
place : So . I turned to the young woman, and told 
her^ VfC did not defire to impofe upon the new con- 
vert.

^ett, in her firft, an^ more ignorant underftanding o^ 
things ; and begged her to explain to her, that God 
may be very properly faid to anfwer our petitions, when 
iii the courfc of his providence, fuch things ^re, in a 
particular manner, brought to pafs, as we petitioned for ; 
but we do not cxpe<5t returns from heaven, in a mira- 
culous and particular manner ; and that it is our mercy- 
it is not fo. 

This the young woman did afterwards efFe(Elually ; fo 
that there was, I alTure you, no pricftcraft ufed here; 
and I fhould have thought it one of the moft unjpftifiable 
frauds in the world, to have had it fo; but the furprife 
of joy upon Will Atkins, is really not to be exprefled ; 
and there, we may be fure, was no delufion : fure no man 
"\vas ever more thankful in the world for any thing of 
its kind, "than he was for this bible; and, I believe, 
never any man was glad of a bible from a better prin- 
ciple ; and though he had been a moft profligate creature, 
dftfperate, headftrong, outrageous, furious, and wicked, . 
to a great degree, yet this man is a (landing rule to us all 
for the well-inftrudling children; viz. that parents 
Should never give over to teach and . inftrudt, or ever 
defpair of the fuccefs of their endeavours, let the chil- 
dren be ever fo obitinate, refractory, or, to appearance, 
infenilble of inftruiflion ; for, if ever God in his provi- 
dence touches the' confciences of fuch, the force of their 
education returns upon them, and the early inftruftion 
of parents is not loft, though it maty have been many 
years laid afleep ; but, fome time or other, they may 
find the benefit of it. 

Thus it was with this poor man, however ignorant 
he was, or divefted of religion and Chriftian knowledge. 
He found he had fome to do with now more ignorant 
than himfelf; and that the leaft part of the indrudtion 
of his good father, that could now come to his inind, 
' was of ufe to him. 

Among the reft it occurred to him, he faid, how his 
father ufed to infiftmuch upon the inexpreflible valu<i of 
the bible— the priyilege and bleffing of it to nations, 
families, and perfons ; bat, be never entertained the

to talk to heathens, favages, and barbarians; he wanted 
the help of the written oracle /or his affiftance. 

The youn^ij woman was very glad of it alfo, for the 
prefent occafion, though (he had one ; and fo had the 
youth on board our (hip, among the goods which were 
not yet brought on fhore. And now, having faid fo 
many things of this young woman, 1 cannot omit telling 
one ftOry more of her and myfelf, which has fomcthing 
in it very informing and remarkable. 

I have related to what extremity the poor young wo- 
man was reduced ; how her miftrefs was Itarved to death 
and did die on board that unhappy fhip we met at fea; 
and how the whole (hip's company being reduced to the 
laft extremity, the gentlewoman, and her fon, and this 
maid, were firft hardly ufed as to provifions ; and, at 
lalt, totaHy neglefted and ftarved, that is to fay, brought 
to the laft extremity of hunger. 

One day, being difcouHing with her upon the extre- 
mities they fufFcred, I afked her if ijie could defcribc, 
by what (he felt, what it was to ftarve, and how it ap- 
peared ? She told me, fhe believed (he could ; and flie 
told her tale very diftinftly thus : ^ 

Firft, Sir,* faid fhe, we had for fome days fared ex- 
ceeding hard, and fufFered very great hunger ; but now, 
at laft, we were wholly without food of any kind, ex- 
cept fugar, and a little wine, and a little water. The 
firft day after I had received no food at all, I found my- 
felf, towards evening, firft empty and ftckifh at my fto- 
mach, and nearer niglit, mightijy inclined to yawning 
and (leepy ; 1 laid down on a couch, in the great cabin, 
to fleep ; and ftept about three hours, and awaked a 
little refreflied, having taken a glafs of wine when I lay 
<iown :- after bein^ about three hours awake, it being 
about five o'clock in the morning, 1 found myfelf empty 
and my ftomach ftckifti again, and laid down again; 
hut' could not Heep at all, being very faint and ill ; and 
thus 1 continued* all the fecond day, with a ftrange va- 
riety, firft hunger, then lick again, with reachings to 
vomit ; the fecond night, being obliged to go to bed 
again, Without any food more thaa a draught of fair 
water, and being adeep^ I dreamed I was at Barbadoes, 
and that the market was mighttily ftocked with provilions ;

ftat I bought feme for my miftrefs, and went and dined 
very heartily. 

I thought my ftomach was full after this, as it would 
bavc {>een after, or at) a good dinner ; but when I awak* 
td, I wa^ exceedingly funk in my fpirits to find myfelf 
in the extreniity of famine; the laft glafs of wine we had 
I drank, and put fugar into it, becaufe of its having 
fome fpirit to fupply nourilhment ; but there being no 
fubftance in the ftomach for the digeltino: ofhce to work 
upoH) I found the only efFedl of the wine was, to raife 
difagreeable fumes from the ftomach into the head ; and 
1 lay, as they told me, ft:upid and fenfelefs, as one drunk, 
for fome time. 

The third day in the morning, after a night of ftrafnge 
and confuied inconftant dreams, and rather dozing< than 
Deeping, 1 awaked, ravenous and furious with hunger ; 
and I queftion, had not my underftanding returned, and 
conquered it, I fay, I queftion whether, if I ha4 been a 
mother, and had a little child with me, its life would 
Have been fafe or no. 

This lafted about three hours, during which time 
1 was twice raging mad, as any creature in Bedlam, as 
my young mafter told me, and as he can now inform 

you. 

In one of thefe fits of lunacy, or diftraflion, whether 
by the motion of the fliip, or fome flip of my foot, 1 
know not ; I fell down, and ftruck my face againft the 
corner of a pallet-bed, in which my miftrefs lay ; and 
with the blow the blood gufhed out of my nofe ; and ^ 
the cabin boy bringing me a little bafon, I fat down, and 
hied into it a great deal ; and as the blood ran from me, 
I came to myfelf ; and in the violence of the flame, or 
the fever I was in, abated, and fo did the ravenous part 
of the hunger. 

Then I grew ftcks and reached to vomit, but could 
not, for I had nothing in my ftomach to bring up : after 
Ihad bled fome time, I fwooried, and they all believed 
I was dead ; but 1 came to myfelf foon after, and then 
had a moft dreadful pain in my ftomach, not to be 
defcribed, not like the cholic, but a, gnawing eager pain 
for food ; and, towards night, it went off with a kind 
of earneft wilhingi^r longing for food ; fomtt.\i\iv^\\ks.»

as I fuppofe, the longing of a woman with child. I ' 
took another draught of water, with fugar in it, but my 
flomach loathed the fugar, and brought it all up again; 
then I took a draught of water, without fugar, and that 
Hayed with me; and laid me down upon the bed, pray- 
ing moft heartily, that It would pleafe God to take me 
away ; and compofmg my mind in hopes of it, I (lum- 
bered awhile ; and then waking, thought myfelf dying, 
being light with vapours from an empty ftomach ; I re- 
commended ray foul to God, and earneilly wiihed that 
fomebody would throw me into the fea. 

All this while my miCtrefs lay by pie, juft, as I 
thought expiring ; but bore it with much more patience 
than r, and gave the lad bit qf bread ihe had to her 
child, my young mafter, who would not have taken 
it, but flie obliged hin;i to eat it ; and, I believe, it 
faved his life. 

Towards the morning Iflept agnin, andiirft, when I 
awaked, I fell into a violent pafiion qf crying ; and 
after that, had a fecond fit of violent hunger, fo that I 
got up ravenous, -and in a moft dreadful condition ; had 
jny miilrefs been dead, ^s much as I loved her, I am 
certain, I (hou.ld have eaten a piece of her fleih with as 
much rclifh^ and as unconcerned, as ever I did the flefli 
of any creature appointed for food ; and once or twice I 
was going to bite my own arm. At laft, I faw the 
bafon, in which was the blood I had bled at my nofe the 
day before; I ran to it, and fwallowed it with fuch hade 
and fuch a greedy appetite, as if I had wondered nobody 
had taken it before^ and afraid it fliould be taken from 
fne now. 

Though after it was down, the thoughts of it filled 
me with horror, yet it checked the fit of hunger ; and I 
drank a draught of fair water, and was compofed and 
lefrefhed for fome hours after it, . This was the fourth 
xlay, and thus I held it till towards night, when, within 
the compafs of three hours, 1 had all thefe feveral cir- 
cumixancespv.er again, one after another, vi?:. fick, flcepy, 
eagerly hungry, pain in the ftomach, then ravenous 
again, then fick again, then lunatic, then crying, then 
ravenous again, and fo every quarter of an hour ; and 
Moy ftrength wafted exceedingly. At night I laid me

clowii, baving no comfort, but that in the hope that 1 
ihould die before morning. 

All this night I had no deep, bi>t the hunger was now 
turned into difeafe, and I had a terrible cholic and gri- 
ping ; wind inftead of food, having found its way into 
the bowels ; . and in this condition 1 lay till morning, 
when I was furprifed a little with the cries and lamenta- 
tions of my young mafter, who called out to me, that 
his mother was dead. I lifted my i elf up a little, for I 
had not ftrength to rife, but found Ae was not dead, 
tho' (he was able to give very little figns of life. 

I had then fuch convulfions in my ftomach for want 
of forae fuftenance, that I caqnot deicribe them, with 
fuch frequent throes and pangs of appetite, that nothing 
but the tortures of death can imitate; and this condition 
I was in, when I heard the feaman above cry out, 
A fail ! a fail 1 dnd halloo and jump about as if they were 
diftradted. 

I Was hot able to get off from the bed, and my mif- 
trefs much lefs ; and my mafter was fo fick, that I 
thought he had been expiring ; fo we could not opea 
the cabin door, or get any j\ccount what it was that oc- 
cafioned fuch a combuftion ; nor had we any con\ erfa- 
tion with the {hip's company for two days, they having 
told us, they had not a mouthful of any thing to eat in 
the ihip ; and they told us afterwards they thought we 
had been dead. 

It was this dreadful condition we were in, when you 
were fent to fave our lives ; and how you found us, Sir, 
you know as well as I, and better top. 

This was her ow^ relation, and iis fuch a diftindl ac- 
count of ftarving to death, as I confefs, I never met 
with, and was exceeding entertaining to me : I am the 
rather apt to believe it to be a true account, becaufe the 
youth gave me an account of a good part of it ; though 
I mult own, not fo diftin6t, and fo feelingly, as his 
maid ; and the rather, becaufe, it feems, his mother 
fed him at the price of her own life : but the poor 
maid, though her conftitution being ftronger than that 
of her miftrefs, who was in years, and a weakly woman 
too, {he might ftruggle harder with it ; 1 fay, the poor 
maid might be fuppofed to feel the extremity fomethin^

fooner than her miftrcfs, who might be allowed to keep 
the lafl bits fomething longer than (he parted with any 
to relieve the maid. No queftion, as the cafe is here re- 
lated, ifourfhip, or fome other, had not fo providenti- 
ally met them, a few days more would have ended all 
their lives, unlefs they had prevented it by eating one 
another; and even that, as their cafe ftood, would have 
ferved them but a little while, they being 50O leagues 
from any land : or any poffibility of relief, other than 
in the .miraculous rnanner it happened ; but this is by 
the way. I return to my difpofition of things among the 
people. 

And firft, it is to be obferved here, that, for many 
xeafons, I did not think fit to let them know any thing 
of the (loop I had framed, and which I thought of fetting 
up among them ; for I found, at leaft at my firft comings 
fuch feeds of divifion among them, that I faw it plainly^ 
had I fet up the floop, and left it among them, they 
would, upon very light difguft, have feparated, and gone 
^way from one another ; or perhaps, have turned pirates^ 
and lb made the ifland a den of thieves, iniiead of a plan- 
> tation of fober and religious people^ as I intended it to 
be ; nor did I leave the two pieces of brafs cannon that 
I had on board, or the two quarter-deck guns, that my 
nephew took extraordinary, for the fame reafon; I thought 
they had enough to qualify them for a defenfive war 
againft any that Ihould invade them ; but I was not to 
fet them up for an ofFeniive war, or to encourage them 
to go abroad to attack others, which in the end, would 
only bring ruin and deilrudiion upon themfelves and all 
their undertakiiigs ; I referved the Hoop, therefore, and 
the guns, for their fervice another way, as I fhall obferve 
in its place. 

I have now done with the ifland: I left them all in 
rv< good circumilances, and in a flouriftiing condition, and 

*- I, went on board my Ihip again the 5th day of May, hav- 
ing been five and twenty days among them; and, as 
they were all refolved to ftay upon the ifland till I came 
to remove them, I promifed to fend fome further relief 
from the Brazils,' if I could poffibly find an opportunity ; 
and particularly, I promiied to fend them fome cattle, 
fuch as* iheep, hogs^ and cows ; for as to the two cows

tnd calves, which I brought from England, we had been 
obliged, by the length, of our voyage, to kill them at fea, 
for want of hay to feed them. 

The next day, giving them a falute af five guns at 
parting, we fet fail, and arrived at the Bay of All Saints, 
in the Brazils, in about 22 days ; meeting nothing re- 
markable in our paflage, but this ; that about,three days 
after wc failed, being becalmed, and the current fetting 
llrong to the N. N. E. running, as it were, into a bay 
or gulpb, on the land iide, we were driven fomcthing 
out of our courfe ; and once or twice our men cried, 
land to the weftward ; but whether it was the continent 
or iflandfl, we could not tell by any means. 

But the third day, towards evening, the fca fmootb, 
and the weather calm, we faw the lea, as it were, co- 
vered towards the land, with foraething very blackjflhot 
being able to difcover what it was ; but after fome time, 
our chief mate going up the main (hrouds a little way, 
and looking at them with a perfpedtive, cried out, it was 
an army. I could not imagine what he meant by an 
army, and fppke a little haftily, calling the fellow a tool, 
or fome fuch word : Nay, Sir, fays he, don't be angry, 
for it is an army, and a fleet too ; for 1 ^ipieve there arc 
a thoufand canoes, and you may fee them paddle along, 
and they are coming towards us too, apace, and full of 
men. 

I was a little furprifed then, indeed, and fo was my" 
, nephew the captain ; for he had heard fuch terrible llories 
of them in the ifland, and having never been in thofc 
fcas before, that he could not tell what to think- of it, 
but faid, ^wo or three times, we (hall all be devoured. 
I muft confefs, confidering we were becalmed, and the 
the current fet flrong towards the (hore, I liked it the 
worfe ; however, 1 bade him not be afraid, l^ut bring the 
ihip to an'anchor, as foon as we came fo near as to know 
that we muft .engage them. 

The weather continued calm, and they came on apace 
towards us ; fo I gave orders to come to an anchor, and 
furl all our fails. As for the favages, 1 told them, they 
had nothing to fear from them but fire ; and therefore 
they fhould get their boats out, and fatten them, one 
clofe by the head^ and the other by the ilern, and maa

them both well, and wait the iflue in that pofture* 
this. I did, that the men in the boats might be ready, 
•with fheet and buckets, to put out any fire thefe fa- 
vac;es might endeavour to fix upon the outfide of the 
fliip. 

in this pofture we layby for them, and in a little while 
they came up with us, but never was fuch a horrid fight 
feen by Chriftians : my mate was much miftaken in his 
calculation of their number, I mean of a thoufand canoes ; 
the moft iXre cotild make of them when they came up, 
being about 126; and a great many of them too ; for 
fome of them had 16 or 17 men in them, fome more, 
and^the lead fix or fcven. 

When they came nearer to us, they (ceraed to be 
ilrudk with wonder and aflonifhment, as at a fight which 
they had, doubtlefs, never leen before, nor could they, 
at firft, as we afterwards underltood, know what to make 
of us. They came boldly up, however, very near to us, 
and feemed to go about to row round us ; but we called to 
our men in the boats, not to let them come too near them. 

This very order brought us to an engagement with 
them, without our defigning it : for five or fix of their 
large canoes came fo near our long-boat, that our men 
beckoned with their hands to them to keep back ; which 
they underftood ^tty well, and went back ; but at their 
retreat about 600 arrows came on board us from thofe 
boats ; and one of our men in the lon^^-boat was very 
much wounded. 

However, L called to them not to fire by any means ; 
but we handed down fome deal boards into the boat, and 
the carpenter prefently fet up a kind of a fence, like wafte- 
boards, to cover them from the arrows of the favages, if 
they fhould ihoot again. 

About half an hour afterwards they came all up in a 
body aftern of us, and pretty near, fo near tha^ we could 
eafily difcern what they were, though we could not tell 
their defign. 1 eafily found they were fome of my old 
friends, the fame fort of favages that I had been ufed 
to engage with ; and in. a little time more they rowed 
fomewhat. farther out to fea, till they came diredtly 
broadfide with us, and then rowed down ftrait upon us, 
till they came fo near^ that they could hear us fpeak ;

tipon this I ordered all my men to keep clofe, left they 
Ihould Ihoot any more arrows, and make all our guns 
ready; but, being fo near as to be within hearing, I 
made Friday go out upon the deck, and calV out aloud 
to them in his language, to know what they meant ; 
which accordingly he did : whether they underftood 
him of not, that I knew not; but as foon as he had 
called to them, fix of them, who were in the forefnoft, 
or nighcft boats to us, turned their canoes from us ; and 
ftooping down, (hewed us their naked backfides ; juft as 
if in Englifli, (faving your prefence) they had bid us 
kifs ■ L ■ ; whether this was a defiance or challenge, 

we know not ; or whether it was done in mere conte;mpt 
or a fignal to the reft ; but immediately Friday cried 
out, 1 hey were going to ihoot ; and unhappily -for 
him, (poor fellow) they let fly about 300 pf their ar- 
rows, and to my inexpreffible grief killed poor Fri- 
day, ho other man being in their iight. The poor fel- 
low was fhot with no lefs than three arrows, and abbut 
three more fell very nigh him ; fbch, unluckily, markfmea 
they were. . 

1 was fo enraged with the lofs of my old fervant, the 
campanion of all my forrows and folitude, that # im- 
mediately ordered five guns to be loaded with fmall Ihot, 
and four with great ; and gave them fuch a broad- 
fide as they had never had in their lives before to be 
fure. 

They were not above half a cable's length off when 
we fired ; and our gunners took their aim fo well that 
three or four of their canoes were overfct, as we had 
' reafon to believe, by one (hot only. 

The ill manners of turning up their bare backficjes 
to us gave us ho great offence; neither did I know for 
certain whether that, which would paf»<for the greateft 
contempt among us, might be underftood fo by them, 
or not; therefore in return, I had only refolved to liAve 
fired four or five gnns with powder only, which I knew 
.would fright them fufficiently : but when they (hot at us 
diredily with all the fury they were capable of, and 
efpecially as they^ had killed my poor Friday, whotA I 
fo entirely loved and valued, and who, indeed, fo well 
deferved it, I not ohly had been juitilied before- God dnd

overfet every canoe tliere> axid drowned every one a

1 can> neither tell bow many we killed, or how many 
we wounded, at this broadiide ; but fure fuch a fright 
and hurry never wasfeen among f^ch a multitude : there 
were 13 or 14 of th^ir canoes f'pUt, and overfet, in all; 
^ and the men all fet a fwtmming ; the rell, frighted 
out of thdr wits, fcoured away as faft b& they could, 
taking but little care to fave thofe whofe boats were fplit 
or fpoiled with our {hot ; fo I fuppofe that there were 
many of them loft ; and our men took up one poor fel- 
low i'wimming for his life, above an hour after they were 
all gone. 

Our fnudl fhot from onr cannon muft needs kilt and 
wound a great many : but, in ihort, we never knew any 
thing how it went with them ; for they fled fo idiiy. that 
in three hours, or thereabouts, we could not iee above ' 
three or foiir ftraggling canoes ; nor did we ev^r fee the 
-left any more : for a breeze of wind fpringing up the 
fame evening, we weighed, and fet fail for the Brazils. 

We had a prifoner indeed, but the creature was fo fullea 
th^ he would neither eajt or fpeak ; and we all fancied 
that he would ftarve himfelf to death : but I took a way 
to cure him : for I made them take him, and tarn him 
into the long boat, and make him believe they would toi^ 
bim into the fea again, and fo leave him where they found 
Jiim, if he would not fpeak ; nor would that do, but they 
really did throw him into the fea, and came away from 
)iim : and then he followed them^, for he fwam tike a 
cork, .and called to them in his tongue, tho' they knew 
not one word of what ke faid. Howeves, at laft, they 
took him iii again, and then he began to be more tra^-

he began to be a little tra6kable : afterwards we enquired 
what country he came from, but could make nothing of 
what he faid ; for his Ipeech was fo odd, all gutturals, 
and fpoken in the throat, in fuch an hollow, and odd 
manner, that we could never form a word from him ; 
and we were all of opinion that they might fpealc 
that language as well, if they were gagged, as other- 
wife ; 'nor could we perceive that they had any occafion 
either for teeth, tongue, lips, or palate; bit formed 
their words juft as a hunting-horn forms a tune, with 
an open throat ; he told us however, fome time after, 
when he- had taught him to Tpeak a little Englifh, 
that they were going, with their kings, to fight a great 
battle. When he faid kings, we afked him how many 
'kings ? He faid, there were five" nation, (we could not 
make him underfland the plural s) and that they all 
joined to go againft two nation. We afked him. What 
made them come up to us ? He faid. To makee te great 
wonder look : where it is to be obferved, that all thofc 
natives, as alfo thofe of Africa, when they learn Engliih, 
they always add two e's at the end of the wprds where 
we ufe.one, and place the accent upon the lail of them, 
as makee ^ takee, and the like; and we could not break 
them of it ; nay, I could hardly make Friday IcSve it 
off*, though at lafl he did. 

And now 1 name the poor fellow once more, I 
mufl take my lafl leave of him ; poor honefl Friday ! 
We buried him with all decency and folemnity poffi- 
ble, by putting him into a cofnn« and throwing him 
into the fea; and I caufed them to fire eleven guns 
for hyn : and fo ended the life of the moft grateful, 
faithful, honed, and mofl afFedionate iervant that ever 
man had.

pl?ce of. my deliverance, from whence came both mf 
good and evil fate. 

Never did a ihip come to this part that had lefs bufi* 
xiefs than I had ; and yet it was with great difHculty that 
"we were admitted to hold the leaft correfpondence on 
Ihore : not my partner himfelf, who was alive, and made 
a great figure among them ; not my two merchant truf- 
tecs, nor the fame of my wonderful prefervation in tbc 
ifland, could obtain me that favour : but my partner, 
Temcmberinof that 1 had given five hundred moidores to 
the prior of the monaftry of the Auguftines, and thuee 
-hundred and feventy-two to the poor, went to the mo- 
naftry, and obliged the prior that then was to go to^ the 
«^overnor, and beg leave for me prefently, with the cap- 
tain, and one more, beiides eight feamen, to come on 
ihore, and no more ; and this upon condition abfolutely 
capitulated for, that we (hould not offer to land any 
goods out of the (hip, or to carry any perfon away with- 
out licence. 

They were fo ftridt with us, as to landing any goods, 
that it was with extreme difficulty that 1 got on (bore 
three bales of Englifh goods, fuch as fine broad clothe, 
iluffs, and fome linen, which I had bought for a prefcnt 
to my partner. 

He was a very generous broad-hearted man, though 
flike me) he came from little at firft; and though he 
knew not that I had th^leall defign of giving him any 
thing, he fent me on board a prefent of frefh proviiions, 
wine, and fweetmeats, worth about thirty raoidores, 
including fome tobacco, and three or four due medals 
in gold. But F was even with him in my prefent, 
which, as I have faid, confided of fine broad cloth, 
Englifh (luffs, lace, and fine Hollands. ^Alfo I deli- 
vered him about the value of lOOl. flerlingf, in the 
fame goods, for other ufes ; and I obliged him to fet 
up the floop which I had brought with me from Eng- 
land, as I have faid, for the ufe of my colony, ia o*"- 
der to fend the refrelhments I intended to my planta- 
don. 

Accordingly he got bands, and finifhed the (loop in 
a very few days, for (he wa» already framed, and I gave 
the mailer of her fuch indruAians as he could not mifs

tlie place ; nor did he mifs it, as I had an account from 
my partner afterwards. 1 got him foon loaded with the 
fmall cargo I had fent them ; and one of ouf feames, 
that had been on ihore with me there, offered to go witii 
the Hoop, and fettle there, upon my letter to the governer 
Spaniard, to allot him a fufficient quantity of land for 
a plantation ; and giving him fome clothes, and toojs 
for his planting work, which, he faid, he underftood, 
having been an old planter in Maryland, and a buccaneer 
into the bargain. 

I encouraged the fellow by granting all he defired ; 
and, as an addition, i gave him the favage which we had 
taken prifoner of war, to be his flave, and ordered the 
governor Spaniard to give him his fhare of every thing 
he wanted with the reft. 

When we came to fit this man out, my old partner 
told me, there was a certain very honeft fellow, a Braiil 
planter of his acquaintance, who had fallen into the dif- 
pleafure of the church ; I know not what the matter 
is with him, fays he; but, on my confcience, I think 
he is an heretic in his heart ; and he has been obliged 
to conceal himfelf for fear of the inquilition ;. that 
he would be very glad of fuch an opportunity to 
make his efcape, with his wife and two daughters^ ; 
and if I would let them go to the idand, and allot them 
a plantation, ' he would giri them a fmall ftock to begin 
with ; for the officers of the inquiiition had feized all 
his eff^dls and eilate, and he had nothing left but a 
Httle houfliold fluff, and two flaves ; and, adds he, 
thoygh I hate his priiiciples, yet I would not have him 
fall into their hands, for he will affuredly be burnt alive 
if he does. 

I granted this preferitly, and joined my Engliihman 
with them ; and we concealed the man, and his wife 
and daughters, on board one fhip, till the floop put out 
to go to fea ; and then (having put all their goods 
on board the floop fome time before) we put them 
on board the floop, after fhe was got out of the 
bay. 

Our' feaman was mightily pleafed with this new 
partner ; and their flock, indeed, was niuch alike rich 
in tools, in, preparations, for a farm; 'but nothing to 

be^in;

begin with, but as above. However, they carried over 
with them (which was worth all tbereil) u>me materiali 
for planting lugar canes, with fome plants of canes ; 
which he, I mean the Foitugal man, underiiood very 
well. ^ 

Among -the reft of the fupplies fent my tenants in 
the xfland, I fent them^ by this (loop, three milch- 
cows, and five calves, about twenty-two hogs among 
them, three fows big with pig, two mares, and a ftone- 
horfe. 

For my Spaniards, according to my promife, I engaged 
thre6 Portugal women to go ; and recommended it to 
them to marry them, and ufe them kindly. I could have 
procured nrore women, but 1 remembered, that the poor 
perfecuted man had two daughters, and there were bat 
live of the Spaniards that wanted ; the reft had wives of 
their own, though in another country. 

All this cargo arrived fafe, and, as you, may cafily 
iuppofe, very welcome to my old inhabitants, wno were 
now, (with this addition) betwixt fixty and feventy 
. people, befides little qhildren, of which there were a 
great many : I found letters at London from them, all 
by way of Lilbon, when I came back to England, being 
fent back to the Brafils by this (loop, of which I fhall 
take fome notice in its place.-^ 

I have now done with m^ idand, and all manner of 
diifcourfe about it; and whoever reads the reft of my 
memorandums, would do well to tucn his thoughts 
entirely from it, and expedi t6 read only of the follies 
of an old man, not warned by his own harms, much 
left by thofe of other men, to beware of the like ; not 
cooled by almoft forty years mifery and difappointments ; 
not fatisfied with profperity beyond expcdtation ; not 
made cautious by a^dtion and diftrel? beyond imita^

done in iix months time, and ordered my friends to 
have fitted her oat again for our fup{>ly ; had 1 done 
this, and flayed there myfelf, I had, at leail, aded like a 
man of common fenfe ; but I was poflefled with a wan«

like an old patriarchal monarch ; providing, for them as

any one nation more than another; nay, I never fo much 
as gave the place a name ; but left it as 1 found it, be-

cnce over them as father and benefa&or, had no authority

160 ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON GRUSOC. 

But I was gone a wUd-goofe chace indeed ; and they 
who will have any more of me, muft be content to 
follow me througn a new variety of follies, hard- 
ihips, and wild adventures ; wherein the juftice of 
Providence may be duly oblcrved, and w^ may fee 
bow eafily heaven can gorge us with our own defircs, 
make the (Irorigcil of our wiflies to be our afflJ«5kioii, 
and puniih us moll feverely with thofe very things which 
vre think it would be our utmofl happinefs to be al^ 
lowed in. 

Let no wife man flatter himfelf with the ftrength of 
his own judgment, as if he was able to chufe any partr- 
cular ilation of life for himfelf. Man is a (hort-fighted 
creature, fees but a very little way before him ; and as 
his paffions are none of his heft friends, fo his particular 
afFeftions are generally his worft counfellors. 

I fay this, with refpeft to the impetuous defire I had 
from a youth, to wander into the world ; and how evih 
dent it now was, that this principle was preferved in me 
for my punifliment. How it came on, the manner, the 
circumftance, and the conclufion of it, it is eafy to give 
you hiftorically, and with its utmoil variety of particu- 
lars. But the fecret ends of Divine Providence, in thus 
permitting us to be hurried down the ftream of our own 
defires, are only to be 4inderilood of thofe who can liften 
'to the voice of Providence, and draw religious confer 
quences from God'sjuftice, and their own mifiakes. 

Be it, had I bufinefs, or no bufinels, away I went : 
it is no time now to enlarge any further upon the rea- 
fon or ab^i^dity of my own conduct : but to come to 
the hiftory, I was embarked for the voyage, and the 
voyage I went. 

1 fhall only add here, that my honed and truly jhous 
clergyman left me here : a ihip being ready to go to 
Lifbon, he afked me leave to go thither ; being ft ill, as 
he obferved, bound never to finifh any voyage he be- 
gan : how happy had it been for me, if I had gone with 
him ! 

Bujk it was too late now : all things heaven appoints 
are bed : had I gone with him, I had never had fo many 
things to be thankful for, and you had never heard of the 
fecond part of the travels and adventures of Robinfbn

Crafoe ; fo I mud leave here the fruitlefs exclaiming at 
Jnyfelf, aiid go on with my Voyage. 

From the Brafils we made direiSlly away over the At- 
lantic fea, to the Cape dc Bonne Efperance, or, as we 
call it, the Cape of Good Hope ; and had a tolerable 
good voyage, our courfe generally foutlv-eaft : now and 
then a ftorm, and fome contrary winds. But my dif- 
ailers ^t fea were at the end, my future rubs and crofs 
events were to befal me on Ihore ; that it might appear 
the land was as well prepared to be our fcourge as the 
fea, when heaven, who diredls the circvimftances of 
thifigs, pleafesto appoint it t6 be Co, 

Our ihip was on a trading voyage, and had a fuper- 
cargo on board, who was to dire<9; all her motions, after 
fhe arrived at the Cape : only being limited to certain 
number of days, for ftay, by charter-party, at the feveral 
ports fhe was to go to ; this was none of my bufinefs, 
neither did I meddle with it at all ; my nephew the cap- 
tain, ai)d the fupercargo, adjufting all thofe things be- 
tween them as they thought fit. 

We made no ilay at the Cape, longer than was needful 
to take in frefh water, bi\t made the beft of our way to 
the coafl of Coromandel ; we were indeed informed, 
that a French man of war of fifty guns', and two large 
merchant fhips, were gone for the Indies : and, as I 
knew we were at war with France, I had Ibme appre- 
henfions of them ; but they went their own way, and we 
heard no more of them. 

1 fhall not pefter my account^ or the reader, ^twith 
defcriptions of places, journals of our voyage variations 
of the compafs, latitudes, meridian diflances, trade- 
winds, fituation of ports, and the like ; fuch as almoft all 
the hiflories of long navigation are full of, and which 
make the reading tirefome enough; and are.perfedlly 
unprofitable to all that read, except only to thole who 
are to go to thofe places themfelves. r 

It is enough to name the ports and places, which we 
touched at ; and what occurred to us upon our pafling 
from one to another. We touched firft at the ifland of 
Madagafcar, where, tho' the people are fierce and treache- 
rous, and in particular, Ytty well armed with lances a^d 
bows, which they ufe with inconceivable dexterity, yet

we fared rcry well with them awhile ; they treated xti 
very civilly ; and for fbme trifles which we gave them, 
fuch as knives, fciifars, &c. they brought us 1 1 good 
fat bullocks, middling in (ize, but very good ii^ileih; 
•which we took in, partly for frefh provifions for our pre- 
fent fpending, and the reft to fait for the (hip's ufe. 

We were obliged to flray here for fome time, after wc 
had furnifhed ourfelves with provifions; and J, that 
was always too curious to look into every nook of the 
World whercVer I came, was for going on (hore as often 
as I could. It was on the eaft fide of the ifland that wc 
went on ,{hore one evening ; and the people, who, by 
the way, are very numerous, came thronging about us, 
and ftood gazing at us, at a diftance : as we bad traded 
freely with them, and had been kindly ufed, wc 
thought ourfelves in no dailger ; but when we faw the 
people, we cut three boughs out of a tree, and ftuck 
them up at a diftance from us, which, it feeras, is a 
mark in the country, not only of truce and friendffiip, 
but, when it is accepted, the other fide fet up- three 
poles or boughs alfo, which is a (ignal that they accept 
the truce too ; but then this is a known condition of the 
truce, that you are not to pafs beyond their three poles 
towards them, nor they come paft your three poles 
or boughs towards you ; fo that you^ are perfedily fecurc 
within the three poles ; and all the fpace between your 
poles and theirs, is allowed like a market, for free con-^ 
vcrfe, traffic, and commerce. When you go thither, 
you muft not carry your weapons with you ; and if they 
come into that fpace, they ftick up their javelins atid 
lances, all at the firfl poles, and come on unarmed ; but 
if any violence is offered to them, and the truce thereby 
broken, away they run to the poles, and lay hold of their 
weapons, and then truce is at an end. 

It happened one evening, when we went on ihore, 
that a greater number of their people came down than 
ufual, but were all very friendly and civil. They 
brought with them feveral kinds of provifions, for 
which we fatisfied them with fuch toys as we had; 
their women alfo brought us milk and roots, and fe* 
^nd things very acceptable to us^ and all was quiet;

and we made us a little tent, or hut, of fome boughs of 
trees, and lay on the (hore all that night. 

I know not what was the occafion, but I was not Co 
yell fatisfied to lie on Ihorc as the reft ; and the boat ly- 
ing at an anchor, about a ftone's caft from the land, 
with two men in her to take care of her, I made one of 
them come on fhore ; and getting fome boughs of trees 
to cover us alfo in the boat, 1 Ipread the fail on the bot- 
tom of the boat, and lay on board, under the cover of 
the branches of the trees, all night. 

About two o'clock in the mornins: we heard one of our 
men make a terrible noife on the fliore, calling out, for 
God's fake, to bring the boat in, and come and help 
them, for they were all like to be murdered ; at the fame 
time I heard the firing of five mufquets, which was the 
number of the guns they had, and that three times over ; 
for, it feems, the natives here were not fo eafily frighted 
with guns as the favages were in America, where 1 had 
to do with them. 

All this while I knew not what was the matter ; but 
Toufing immediately from deep with the noife, I 
caufed the boat to be thruil in, and refolved, with 
three fuiils we had on board, to land, and affifi our 
men. . 

We; got the boat foon to the (hore ; but our men were 
in too much hafte, for, being come to the fhore, 
they plunged into* the water, to get to the boat with all 
the expedition they could, being purfued by between 
three and four hundred men. Our men were but nine in 
all, and only live of them had fufils with them : the reft, 
indeed, had piftols and fwords, but they were of fmall 
ufe to them. 

We took up feven of our men, and with difficulty 
enough too, three of them being very ill wounded ; and 
that which was ftill worfe, was, that while we flood in 
the boat to take our men in, we were in as much 
danger as they were in on fhore, for they poured their 
arrows in^upon us fo thick, that we were fain to barri- 
cade the fide of the boat up with the benches, and two 
or three loofe boards, which, to our great fatisfa<5tien, 
we bad^ by mere accident^ or providence rather;i in the 
boatt

And yet, had it been daylight, they are, it ^ttvtiSf 
fuch exa<5l markfmen, that if they could have feen fcut 
the lead part of any of us, they would have been fure 
of us : we had, by the light of the moon, a little fight 
of them, as they ftood pelting us from the (hore with 
darts and arrows ; and, having got ready our fire-arms,. 
^ we gave them a volley ; and, we could hear by the crie^ 
of fome of them, that we had wounded feveral ; how- 
ever, they flood thus in battle-array on the fhorc till 
break of day, which we fuppofe was,: that they might 
fee the better to take their aim at us. 

In this condition we lay, and could not tell bow to 
•weigh our anchor, or fet up our fail, becauie^we mufl 
needs fland up -in the boat, and they were as fure to hit 
us, as we >vere to hit a bird in a tree with fmall fhot : 
we made fignals of diftrefs to the ihip, which, though 
fhe rode a league ofF, yet my nephew the captain* 
hearing our firing, and by glafTes perceiving the pofture 
we lay in, and that we fired towards the (hore, pretty 
well underflood us; and weighing anchor with all 
fpeed, he flood as near the fhore as he durft with the 
ihip, and then fent another boat, with ten ha;ids in 
her, to aflift us, but we called to theni not to come 
too near, telling them what condition we were in ; how- 
ever, they flood in nearer to us ; and one of the men, 
' taking the end of a tow line in his hand, and keepmg 
our boat between him and the enemy, fo that they 
could not perfectly fee him, fwam on board us, and 
made the line fafl to the boat ; upon which we flipt our 
little cable, and leaving our anchor behind, they towed 
us out of the reach of the arrows, we all the while 
lying clofe behind the barricade we had made. 

As foon as we were got from between the fhjp and 
the fhore, that fhe could lay her fide to the fhore, we 
ran along jufl by them, and we poured in a broadfide 
among themj^, loaded with pieces of iron and lead, imall 
bullets, and fiich fluff, befid^s the great (hot, which 
made a terrible havoc among them. 

When we were got on board, and out of danger, we 
had time to examine into the occafion of this fray : 
and, indeed, our fupercargo, who had been often in

ftofe parts, put me upon it ; for he faid, he was fure 
the inhabitants would not have touched us, after we 
had made a truce, if we had not done fomething to pro- 
voke them to it ; at length it came out, viz. that an 
old woman, who had come to fell us fome milk, had 
brought it within our poles, with a young woman with 
her, who alfo brought him fome roots or herbs ; and while 
the old woman {whether fhe was mother to' the young 
woman or no, they could not tell ) was felling us the 
milk, one of our men offered fome rudenefs to the . 
wench that was with her: at which the old woman 
made a great noife. However, the feaman would not 
quit his prize, but carried her out of the old woman's 
light among the trees, it being almoft dark : the old 
woman went away without her, and, as we fuppofe, 
made an outcry among the people {he' came from, who, 
upoif notice, r^ifed this great army upon us iq three or 
four hours : and it was great odds but we had' teen ^11 
deftroyed. 

One of our men was killed with a lance that was 
thrown at him, juft at the beginning of the attack, as 
he fallied out of the tent we had made: the reft came 
ofFfree^ all but the fellow who was the occaiion of all 
the. mifchief, who paid dear enough for his black mif- 
trefs, for we couki not hear what became of him a 
great while : we lay upon the fhore two days after, 
though the wind prefented, and made lignals for him ; 
made our boat fail up ihore, and down fhore, feveral 
leagues, but in vain : fo we were obliged to give him 
oyer : and if he alone had fuffered for it, the lofs had 
been thelefs. 

1 couldnot fatisfy iTiyfelf, however, without venturing 
on fhore once more, to try if I could learn any thing 
of him or them : it was the third night after the a(5lion» 
that I h'ad a great mind to learn, if ^ I could by any 
raei^ns, wJiat mifchief we had done, "^lohow the game 
Hood on the Indian fide : I. was carefifx to do it in the 
dark, left we fhould be attacked agam : but I ought, 
indeed, to have been fure, that the men I went with had 
been under my command, before I engaged in a thing fo 
hazardous and mifchievous, as I was brought into it 
without any knowledge or defire. 



166 ADVENTURES OF ROblKSON CRUSOE. 

We took twenty ftout fellows with us as any in tlic 
ihip, beiicles the. fupercargo and rtiyfelf; and we landed 
two hours before midnight, at the lame place where the 
Indians flood drawn up the evening before : I landed 
here, becaufe my delign, as I have faid, was chiefly to 
fee if they had quitted the field, and if they had left any 
marks behind them^ or of the mifchief we had done 
them ; and I thought, if we could furprife one or two of 
them, perhaps we might get our man again, by way of 
exchange. 

We landed without any noife, and divided our men 
into two companies, whereof the boatfwain commanded 
one, and I the other. We neither could bear * nor 
fee any body flit when we landed; fo we marched 
up, one body at a diilance from the other, to^ the 
field of battle. Atfirft we could fee nothing, it being 
very dark ; hut by and by, our boatfwain, that led the 
' firft party, (tumbled and fell over a dead body. This 
made them halt there awhile, for knowing by the cir- 
cumllances that they were at the, place where the In- 
dians had flood, they waited for my coming up : Here 
we concluded to halt till the moon began to rife, which 
we knew would be in lefs than an hour; and then 
we would eafily difcern the havoc we had made among 
them. We told two and thirty bodies upon the 
ground, whereof two were not quite dead. Some had 
an arm, and fome a leg (hot ofF; and one had liis head : 
thofe that were wounded, we fuppofed they had carried 
away. 

When we had made, as I thought, a full difcovery 
of all we could come at the knowledge of, I was for 
going on board again, but the boatfwain and his party 
often fent me word, that they were fefolvcd to make, a 
vifit to the Indian town, whererthefe dogs, as they called 
them, dwelt ; aQd defired me to go along with them : 
and if they coiV -find them, as they Hill fancied they 
fhould, they did liot doubt, they faid, getting a good 
booty ; and it might be, they might find Thomas JcfFrys 
there : that was the man's name we had loft.

was not a hazard fit for us to run, lyho had a fhip, 
and a (hip's loading in oikr charge, and a voyage to 
make, which depended very much upon the lives of 
the men ; but as they fent me Word they were refolved 
to go, and only afked mc and my company to go along 
with them, 1 poiitively retufed it, and rofe up (for 
I was fitting on the ground ) in order to go to the 
boat ; one or two of the men began to importune me 
to go, and when I ilill refufed poiitively, began to 
grumble, and fay they were not under my command, 
and they would go. Come, Jack, feys one of the men, « 
will you go with me ? 1 will go for one. Jack faid 
he would ; and another followed, and then another, and, 
in a word, they all left me but one, whom, with much 
difficulty too, I perfuaded to day ; fo the fupcrcargo 
and I, with one man, went back to the boat, where, 
I told them, we would ilay for them, and take care to 
take in as many of them as fhould be left ; for I told 
them, it was a mad thing they were going about, and 
fuppofed moft of them would run the fate of Thomas 
Jdfrys. 

They told me, like feamen, they'd warrant it they 
would come off again ; and they would take care, &c^ 
So away they went. I entreated them to corjiider the 
ihip, and the voyage ; that their Jives were not their 
own ; and that they were eritrufted with the voyage, 
in fome raeafure ; that if thfey niifcarried, the fhip 
might be loft for want of ,their help; and that they' 
could not anfwer it to God and, man. I faid a great 
deal more to them on that head, but I might as well 
have talked to the main-maft of the ihip : they were 
mad upon their journey ; only they gave me good 
words, and begged I would not be angry ; faid, they 
would be very cautious, and they did not doubt but they 
would be back again in about an hour at farthed ; for 
the Indian town, they faid, was not above half a mile off, 
thougK they found it above two miles before they got 
to it. , . 

Well, they all went away, as above ; and though the 
attempt was defperate, and fuch as none but madmen 
would have gone about, yet, to give jhehi their due^. 
they went about it warily, as well as boldly, I'hey were 

X gallantly 



168 ADVENTURES OP ROBINSOlt CRUSOE. 

gallantly armed, that is true : for they had every man a 
fufil or mulkety a bayonet, and every man a piftol : fome 
of them had broad cutlafles, fome of them hangers ; and 
the boatfwain, and two more, had pole-axes : bciides all 
which they had among them .13 hand grenadoes. Bolder 
fellows, and bitter provided, never went about any 
"wicked work in the world. 

When they went out,"thcir chief defign was plunder, 
and they were in mighty hopes of finding gold there : 
but a circumfiance, which none of them were aware of, 
fet them on fire with revenge, and made devils of them 
aU : When they came to the few Indian houfes, which 
they thought had been the town, which were not above 
half a mile ofF, they were under a great difappointment, 
for there were not above twelve or thirteen houfes ; and 
wher^ the town was, or how big, they knew not : they 
confulted, therefore, what to do, and were fometime 
before they Could refolvc : for if they fell upon thefe, 
they mull cut all their throats ; and it was ten to one but 
fome of them might efcape, it being in the night, though 
the moon was up ; ancj if one efcaped, he would run 
away, ana raife all the town, (b they {hould have a whole 
army upon them. Again, on the other hand, if they 
went away, and left thofe untouched (for the people 
were all afleep) they could not teil which way to look for 
the town. 

However, the laft was the beft advice : fo they re- 
folved to leaVe thofe houfes, and look for the town as 
well as they could : they went on a little way, and 
found a cow tied to a tree: this they prefently con- 
cluded would be a good guide to them; for they faid 
the cow certainly belonged to the town before them, 
or the town behind them ; and if they untied her, they 
fhould fee which way fhe Went : if fhe went hack, tfiey 
had nothing to fay to her: but, if fhe went forward, 
they had nothing to do but to follow -her : 'fo they cut 
the coxd, which was made of twifled flags, and 
the cow went on before them: in a word, the, cow 
led them diredWy to the town, which, as they re- 
ported, conMed of above 200 houfes, or huts : and in 
fome of thefe, they found fcveral families living to- 
ecther.

Here they found all filent ; as profoundly fecure, as deep 

*«ind a country that had never feen an enemy of that kind> 

tiould make therti : upon this they called another council; 

to coniider what they had to do ; and in a word they re*- 

folved to divide themfelves into three bodies, and to f^t 

three houfes on fire in three parts of the town : and ai 

the men came out, to feize them and bind them if 

any refifted, they need not to be afked what to do then** 

and fo to fearch the reft of the houfes for plunder ; but 

tefolved to niarch fileritly firft through the town, and 

fee what dimenfions it was of, ancl confider if they might 

venture upon it, or no. - ' ' 

They did fo,.and defperately refolvfed that they, would 
venture ppoii them"; but while they Were animating one 
another to the work, three of them, that were a little 
before the reft, called out aloud, and told them they had 
found Thos. JefFrys, they all ran up to the place, and fd 
it was indeed, for there they found the poor fellow hanged 
up naked by one arm, and his throat cut : there was a A 
Indian houfe juft by the tree, where they found tixteen 
orfeventeen of tte principal Indians, who had Ueen con*"' 
cemed in the fray with us before, and two or three of 
them wounded with our (hot; and our men found they 
were awake, and talking one to another m that houfe^ 
but knew not their number. 

The fight of their poor mangled comradfe ft) enraged 
them as before, that they fwore to one another," they 
would be revenged, and that not an Indian who came 
into their hands ihould have quarter ; and to work they 
went immediately ; ana yet not fo madly as by the rage 
and fury they were in might be, expe<5led. Their firfl 
care was to get fomething that would loon take fire 5 
but after a little fearch, they found that would be to no 
purpofe, for moft of the houfes were low, and thatched 
with flags or ruflies, of which the .country rs full ; fo 
they prefently made fome wild fire, as we call it, by wet- 
ting a little powder in the palms of their hands ; and in 
a quarter of an hour, they fet the town on fire in fout

fwhich the boatfwain and two more kept with the bayo-

who came that way. Bat there was another apartment 
in the houfe, where the prince or king, or whatfoever 
lie was, aod'feveral others, were; and they kept in, till 
<he houfe, which was by this time all of a light flame, 
fell in upon them, and they were fmothered, or burnt

and bur fdlows were glad to keep a little together in

He was furprifed to fee me and the.fitpercargo in the 
boat, with no more than two men, for one had been 
left to keep the boat ; and 'though he was glad that we 
were well, yet he was in the fame impatience with us to 
' know what was doing ; for the noife continued, and the 
flame increafed : I confefs it was next to an impoflibility 
for any men in the world to reftrain their curioiity of 
knowing what had happened, or their concern for the 
fafety of the men. In a word, the captain told me, he 
would go and help his men, let what would come. I 
argued with him, as I did before with the men, the fafe- 
ty of the (hip, and the danger of the voyage, the intereft 
of the owners and merchants, &c. and told him 1 would 
• go, and the two men, and only fee if we could, at a 
dittance learn what was like to be the event, and come 
back and tell him. 

It was all one to talk to my nephew, as it was to talk 
to the reft*before ; he would go, hft faid, and he only 
wifhed he had left but ten men in the (hip ; for he could 
not think of having his men loft for wjint of help : he 
had rather he faid lol'e the ihip, the voyage, and his 
life, and all ; and fo away went he. 

Nor was I any more able to ftay behind now than I 
was to perfuade them not to go before ; fo, in (Jiort, the 
captain ordered two men , to row back the pinnace, and 
fetch twelve men more from the (hip, leaving the long- 
boat at an anchor ; and that when they came back, lix 
men (hould keep the two boats, and lix more come after 
us ; fo that he left only fixteen men in the (hip ; for the 
whole (hip^s company confifted of 65 men, whereof two 
were loli- in the tirft quarrel which brought this mifchief 
on. 

Being now on the inarch, you may be fure we felt 
little of the ground we trod on ; and being guided by 
the fire, we kept no path, but went direcflJy to the 
place of the -flame. If the noife of the guns were 
furpriiing to us before, th? crFes'of the poor people 
were now quite of another nature, and fiUed us with 
horror. I mull confeli^ 1 never was at the fackin<y of

defcribe it, or the^ horror whiph was upon our minds 
at hearinaf it. 

^Ho^\cver we went on, and at length, came to the 
town, thouorh there was no- entering the llreets of it 
for the fire. The firil objeft we met with, was the 
rains of a hut or houfe, or rather the afhes of it, for the 
houfe was cpnfumed; and juft before it, plain now to 
be feen by the light of the lire, lay four men and three 
women killed ; and as we thought, one or two more 
lay in .tlie heap among the fire. In fhort, thefe were 
fuch inftaivces of rage altogether barbarous, and of a 
fury fomething beyond what was human, that we thought 
it impoffible our men could be guilty of it ; or if 
they were the authors of it, we thought that every one 
of them ought to be put to the worft of deaths : but 
this was not all ; we faw the fire increafed forward, and 
the cry went on ju 11 as the fire went on, fo that we were 
in the utmoft confufion. We advanced a little way far- 
ther^ and beheld, to our allonifhment, three women na- 
ked, crying in a mod dreadful manner, and flying as if 
they had, indeed, had wings, and after them, (ixteen or 
feventeen men, natives, in the fame terror and conftema- 
tion, with three of our E^gliih butchers (for I call 
them no better) in the rear; who, when they could not 
overtake them, lir«d in among th$m, and one that was 
killed by tjheir ihpt fell down in our fight ; wncn the

np to us, and kneeling down^ wkh their hands lifted iipy 
ttiade piteous lamentations to u^ to fave them, which we 
let them know we would do ; whereupon they kept all 
together in a huddle, clofe behind us, for protedion. I 
feft my men drawn up together, and charged them tor 
Burt nobody, but, if poflible, to get at fome of out peo- 
ple, and fee what devil it was pofefled them, and What 
tbey intended to do ; and, in a word, to command them 
off; , afluring them, that if they flayed till daylis:ht,c 
they would have a hundred thoufand men about 'their 
ears : I fay I left tVm, and went among thofe flying 
people, taking only two of our men with me ; and there- 
was, indeed, a piteous fpcdtacle among them ; fome of 
them had their feet terribly burnt with trampling and 
runninor through the fire; others their hands burnt, one 
of the women had fallen down in the fire, and was almoir 
burnt to death before (he could g6t out again; two or 
three of the men bad cuts in their backs and thighs, frorn. 
our men pursuing, and another was fllbt through the

will root out the very name of them from the earth ; and 
thus he ran on, out of breath too with adiion, and would 
not give u^ leave to fpeak a word.. 

At laft, raiiing my voice that I might filence him 
a little. Barbarous dog I faid ly what are you doing ? 
1 won't ha^re one creature touched more, upon pain oi

Why Sir, fays he, do yoAi know what you do, 07 U 
what they have done? If you want a reafon for what \n 
we have done, come hither ; and with that he fliewcd 
me the poor fellow hanging upon a tree with his throat 
cut. 

I confefs I was urged then myfelf, and at another 
time {hould have been forward enough : but I thought 
they had carried their rage too far, and thought of 
Jacob's words to his ions Simeon and Levi, * Curfed be 
their anger, for it was fierce ; and their wrath, for it was 
cruel.* But I had now a new .talk upon my hands; for 
when the men 1 cai'ried with me faw the iight, as 1 had 
done, I had as much to do to reftrain them, as I ihould 
have had with the others ; nay, my ^ephew himfelf 
fell in with them, and told me, in their hearing, that 
he was only concerned for fear of the men being over- 
, powered ; for^ as to the people, he thought not one of 
them ought to live; for they had all glutted themfelves 
with the murder of the poor man, and that they oughts 
to be u fed like murderers; ypon thefe words, away 
ran eight of my men with the boatfwain and his crew,, 
to complete their bloody work ; and i, feeing it quite 
out of my power to reilrain them, came aw^y peniive 
and fad ^ for I could not bear the light, mucTi lefs the

confefs, to venture back, as it were alone ; for, as. it

over the coantry, there ftood about forty i;nen armed 
with lances and bows at the little place where the twelve., 
or thirteen houfes Itopd mentioDed before; but- by acci-^ 
dent I mifTed the place, and came diredlly to thp ^<^^- , 
fide ; and by that time T got to the fea-lide it was broad 
day ; immediately I took the pinace, and went aboard^ r 
and fent her back to aflill the men ia^ what might 
Jiappeo. 

I oblerved that about the time I came to the boat- 
fide, the fire was pretty well out, and the noile abated ; 
but in about half an hour after I got on boards I heard 
a volley of our men's fire-arms^ and faw a great fmoke;. 
this, as I underflood afterwards, was our men failing 
upon the forty men, who, as I faid, itood at the few 
houfes on the way ; of whom they killed 16 or 1 7j and 
fet all thole houfes on fire, but did not medJle with the . 
"women or children. 

By that time the men got to the (hore again with the 
pinnace, our men began to appear ; they came drop- 
ping in, fome and forhe ; not in two bodies, and in form, 
as they went out, but all in heaps, ftraggling here and- 
there in fuch a manner, that a I'raall force of relblute men 
might have cut them all oft'. ,. 

But the dread of them was upon the whole country ;; 
the people were amazed, and I'urprifed, and fo frighted, 
that I believe, an hundred of them would have fled at. 
the fight of but five of our rren. Nor in all this, terribly 
a<^on was there a rnan who made any confiderable de^ 
fence; they were fo furprifed, between the terror of the 
fire, and the- fudden atti^ck of our men in the dark, that, 
they knew not which way to turn themidves ; for if they 
fled one way, they were met by one party ; if back again,. 
by another ; fo that they were everjr where knocked dp wn. 
Nor did any of our men i;eceive the leaft hurt, except^ 
one who ilrained his foot, and another had one of hi% 
hands very much burn.t. 

I was very angry with my nephew, the captain, and,, 
indeed, witnalVthe men, in my n^ind, but witl;i'him ii?^

but told me that when he faw the body of the poor fea*

barqus manner^ be was not mafter of himfelf, neither 
could he govern his paflion ; he owned, he Ihould not 
have done fo, as he was commander of the (hip : but, as 
he was a man, and nature moved him, he could not beat 
it^ As for the reft of the men, they were hot fubj eft 
to me at all : and they knew it well enough : fo they 
took no^notice of my diflike. 

■ The next day we fet fail : fo we never heard any 
more of it. Our men differed in the account of the 
number they killed : fome faid ope thing,, fome another ^ 
" but, according to the bell of their accounts put all to- 
gether, they killed, or deftpoyed„ about IbD people,,

half qff, it would do him no fervice to bring him away : 

^ they left him where they found h}m, only took him 

down from the tree where he was hanged by one hand. 

However ]Ull as our men thought this action to ^>c, J\ 
■was againft them in it : and I always, after that time,. 
toW tliem God wopld blaft the voyage : for I looked upf»^ 
on the blood i hey (bed that night to ^e murder in them r 
fcr though it is true that they killed CThomas Jeffrys, yelj 
it was as true that Jeffiys was the aggrelTor, had brol^ea

of theirs, Whp came to our Gan;ip ini^ocently, and on the 
feith of their capitulation. 

' The boatfwain defended this quarrel when we weret 
tifterwards on board. He faid, it was true that w^ 
feemed to b^eal^ the truce, but really had not; and that 
tie war was begun the night before by the natives them-

lowed to be done to murderers. - 

One would think this (hould have been enough to 
have warned us againft going on (hore among heathen»i 
and barbarians ; but it is impoflible to make mankind 
wife, 'but at their own experience ; and their experience 
feems to be always of moft ufe to them, when it is dear-

We were now bound to the gulph of Perfia^ and from* 
thence to the coail of Coromandel, only to touch at 
Surat ; but the chief of the fuperoargo's defign lay at the 
bay of Bengal, where, if he miflTed of the bufineis out- 
ward-bound, be was to go up to China, and return to 
the coall as he came home. 

The firil difafter that befel us was in the Gul'ph of 
Periia, where five of our men-, venturing on (hore on the 
Arabian? iide of the Gulph, were furrdunded by the 
Arabs, and either all killed or carried away into (lavery*;. 
the reft of the boat's crew were not able to refcue them, 
and had but juft time to get oif' their boat*; I began to 
Hpbrakl them with the'juft retribution of heaven in this 
eafe ; but the boatfwain very warmly told me,, he: 
thought i went farther in my cenfu res than I could fhew" 
a&jr warrant for in fcripturc, and referred to the thir- 
teenth of St. Luke, vcr^ 4. where our Saviour intimates,, 
that thoCe men, on whom the Towtr of Siloam fell,, 
were not finners above all the Galileans; but that whicb,. 
inde^dy put rae to filence.in this cafef, was, that none of\ 
thefe five men, who were now loft, were of the number 
of thofe who went On (hore to the maflacre of Mada-- 
gafcor (fo I always called it, thouglrour men could not 
bear the word mafiacre with any patience) ; and, mdeed, 
this laft circumftance, as 1 have faid^ put me to iilence

mand in the (hip, or concern in the voyage, they were- 
not obliged to bear it ; that they did not know but I 
might have fome ill defign in my head, and, perhaps,, 
call them to an account for it, when they came to Eng- 
land ; and that therefore, unlefs- 1 would refolve to "have 
done with it, and alio not to concern myfelf farther 
with him, or any of his affairs, he would leave the 
ibip ; for he did not think it was lafe to fail with me 
among: them. 

I heard him patiently enough till he had done, and 
then told him, that I did confefs I had all along op- 
pofed the maffacre of Madagafcar, for fuch I would al- 
ways call it; and that I had on all occalions fpoken 
my mind freely about it, though not more upon hina 
than any of the reft ; that as to my having -no command 
in. the ihip, that was true, nor did I exercife any aur 
thority,. only took the liberty of ipeaking my mind in 
things which publicly, concerned us all ; as. ta what 
concern I had in the voyage, that was none of his 
buiinefs ; I was a confiderable owner of the (hip, and 
in that claim I conceived I had a right to fpeak, even 
farther than I had yet done, and would not be account- 
able to him, or any oneelfe; and began to be a little 
warm with him : be made* but little reply to me at 
that time, and I thought that affair had been over. 
We were at tij-is time in the road to Bengal : and, being 
willing to fee the place, I went on (hore with the 
fupercargo, in the (hip's boat, to divert myfelf; and- 
towards evening was preparing to go on board, when, 
one of the men came to me, and told me, he would net 
have me trouble myfelf to come down to the boat, for 
they had* orders not to carry me on board. Any one

the captain in a few words, that as I was now gont 
peaceably on ihore, they" were loth to ufe any vio-

they would otherwife have done, to oblige me to have

After a long ftay here, and many propofah made' for

Englifh merchant, who lodge<l with me, and with whom- 
I had contrafted an intimate acquaintance, came to me

thoughts, may, for aught I know, fuit with your' & alfo, 
"V^hen you (hall hsSre thoroughly confidered it.

my own choice, in a part of the world very remote from* 
our own country ; but it is in a country where, by us- 
who underftand trade and buiinefs,- a great deal of money- 
is to be got : if you will put a thoufand pounds to my 
tboufand pounds, we will hire a (hip here, the firft we-

changed fome of our wares for opium, and for fome 
arrack ; the firft, a commodity which bear5 agreat price 
among the Chinele/ and which,, at that time,, was very 
much wanted, there : in a word, we went up to Suiham, 
made a very great voyage, were eight months out^ and 
returned to Bengal ;. and I was very well fatisfied with

get fuch very good ellates as they do, and fometimes

Upon the feareh for bufinefs, propofed another voyage 

tome, viz. among the fpice-iflands, and to bring homo 

a load of cloves, frorp the Manillas, or thereabouts; 

places where, indeed, the Dutch do trade, but the 

iflands^ bel'ong partly to Spaniards ; though we went not 

fofar,'but to Come other, where they have not the whole 

power a« they have at Batavia, Ceylon, &c. We were 

not long in preparing for this voyage ; the chief difficulty 

was in bringing me to come into it ; however, at laft>, 

nothing elfe offering, and finding that really llirring 

aboiTt and trading, the profit being fo great, and^ as^ I 

may fay, certain, had more pleafure in it, and more fa-^ 

tisfaAion to the mind, than fitting ftill ; which, to me 

cipecially, was the unhappieft part of my life,^! refolved 

on this voyage too, which we piade very fuccefefully^ 

touching at Bornea, and feveral ifiands, whofe names I 

do not remember, and came' home in about five months. 

We fold our fpice, whicj* w;as chiefty cloves, and fome 

nutmegs, to the "Perfian merchants, who carried thertk 

away for the Gulph ; and making ne^r five of ope, w© 

leally got a great deal of money. 

My friend, y/hen we niade up this account,, fmiled at 
me : Well now, faid he, with a fort of an agreeable in-* 
fdlt upon rpy indolent tertiper^ is not this better than 
walking aboOt here, like a man of nothing to 4o> ^d 
fpending our time in flaring at the pbnferxie and igno- 
iknce of the Pagans ? Why truly,, ftid I, my friend, I 
think it is, and T begin to be a convert to the principlca 
of merchandizing ; but i muft tell you> faid 1, by the 
way, you do not knbw what I am doing ; for if once I 
conquer my backwardnefs, and embank heartily, as old 
as I am, I fliall harrafs you up and down the world till 
I tire you ; for I ihall purlue it fo eagerly, I ibaU never 
Jet you lie ftill . 

But to be (hort with my fpeculations ; a little while 
after this there came in a DutcJi Ihip from Batavia ; ft^e 
was a coaller, not an European trader, and of about 
two hundred tons burthen : the men, as they pretended^

he would fell his (hip. This came to my ears before ray- 
new partner heard of it ; and I had a great mind to buy 
it : fo 1 went home to him, and told nim of k ;;. he con— 
iiders awhile, for he was no rafti man neither : biit, mii* 
iing fome time, he replied, She is a little too big ; but, 
however, we will have her. Accordingly we bought 
the (hip ; and, agreeing with the naafter, we paid for her^ 
and t ok poiTeflion, When we had done fo, we refolded 
to entertain the men, if we could, to join them with 
•ihofe we had, for the purfiiing our bufinefs : but on. a 
fudder, they having not received their wages, but their 
fhare of the money, as we afterwards learnt, not one of 
them was to be found. We enquired much about them^ 
and at length were told, that they' were all gone together 
by hnd to Agra, the great city of the \Iogurs reiidence; 
and from thence were to travel to Surat, and (b by fea ta 
the Gulph of Periia. 

Nothing had fo heartily troubled me a good while, als- 
that I mifled the opportunity of going with them; for 
iucha ramble, 1 thought, and in fuch company as would 
both have guarded me, ^ and diverted me, would have 
fuited mightily with my great dcfign ; and 1 (hould both 
have feen the world, and gone homewards too t but I 
was much better fatisficd a few days after, when I came 
to know what fort of fellows they were ;. for, in (hort, 
their hiftory was, that this man they called captain 
was the gunner only, not the cdramander ; that they . 
had been a trading voyage, in which they were attacked 
on the fliore by Ibme of the Malaccans, who had. 
killed the captain and three of his men ; and that after 
the captain was killed, thefe men, eleven in number, 
had refolved to run away with the (hip,, which they did ; 
ind had brought her in at the bay of 'Bengal, leavings 
the mate and nve men more on ihore,. of whom we fhall 
hear farther. , 

Well, .let them come by the (hip how. they would, 
we camehoncftly by her, as we thought; though we did 
not, I confefs, examine into things fo ejca(5lly. as

how or other, we fhould have feen reafon to have fuf-r 
pe<5led them ; but the man ihewed us a bill of fale for 
the (hip, to one Emanuel Glofterftioven, or fome fuch 
name (for I fuppofe it was all a forgery), andcallec) him- 
felf by that name ; and we would not contradi(^ him ; 
and being withall a littt too unwary, or at leaft, having 
no fufpicion of the thing, we went through with our 
bargain. 

However, we picked up fome Englifli teamen here 
after this, and fome Dutch ; and we now refolved for a 
fecond voyage to the fouth-eaft, for cloves, &c. that is 
to fay, among the Phillippine and Malacca . ifles ; and 
in fhort, not to fill this part of my flory with trifles, when , 
what is yet to come is fo remarkable, I ipent, from firft 
to laft, fix years in this country, tracing from poft tq 
port, backward and forward, and with very good fuccefs ; 
and was now the laft year with my- partner, going in 
the fhip above-mentioned on a voyage ,to Ghma ; but 
defigning firft to Siam, to buy rice. 

In this voyage, being, by contrary winds, obliged to 
beat up and down a great while in the ftreights of Ma- 
lacca, and among the iflands, were no fooner got clear of 
thofe difficult feas, but we found our (hip had fprung a 
leak, and we were not able, by all our induftry, to find 
out where it was. This forced us to niake for fome port ; 
and my partner, who knew the country better than I did, 
diredled the captain to put into the river of Cambodia ; 
for I had made the Englifti mate, one Mr. Thomlbn, 
eaptain, not being willing to take the charge of the (hip 
upon myfelf, '1 his river lies on the north-fide of the 
great bay orgulph, which goes up to Siam. 

While we were here,, and going often on ftiore for re- 
frefhment, there conifes to me one day an Engliihman^ 
and he was, it feems, a gunner's mate on board an Eng- 
li(h Eaft India (hip, which rode in the fame river, up at, 
or near the city of Cambodia ; what brought him hither

k, or«ot find it, you will be wifer than to lay your ifliip 
on fhore to-morrow, when you htzr what* I have to fay 
to you : Do you know, Sir, faid he, the town of Cam-

are two large Englifb fhips about five leagues on this

to me ?• Why, Sir, fays he^ is it for a man that is upon 
fuch adventures as you are, to come into port, and not 
examine firft \^hat (hips there are there, and whether he id 
able to deal with them ? I fuppofeyou do not think you

fwim without ftopping : But, Sir, faid J, (hall I go 
away ignorant of the reafon of all this ? Can yoa give 
me no further light into it ? 

I can tell you but part of the ftory, Sir, fay« he ; btxt 
I have a Dutch feaman here with me, and, I believe, I 
could perfuade him to tell you the reft; but there is 
fcarce time for it : but the ihort of the ftory is this, the 
firft part of which, 1 fuppofe, you know well enough^ 
viz. That you were with this ihip at Sumatra ; that 
there your captain was murdered by the Malaccans, 
with three of his men ; and that you, or Ibme of thofc 
that were on board with you, ran away with the (hip, 
andarefince turned PIRATES. This is the fum of the 
ilory, and you will all be feized as pirates, I can afture 
jou, and executed with very little ceremony ; for you 
know merchant's ftiips {hew but little law to pirates, if 
they get them in their power, 

No*w you fpeak plain Engliih, faid f, and I thank 
ou ; and though I know nothing that we have done, 
ike yvhat you talk of, but lam fure we' came honeftly 
and fairly by the ftiip, yet, feeing fuch .work is a 
doing, as you fay, and. that you feem to mean honeftly, 
1 will be upon ray guard. Nay, Sir, fays he, do not 
talk of being upon your guard ; the beft defence is to 
be out of the danger; if you have any legard to your 
life, and the lives of all your men, put out to^ fea, 
without fail at high-water ; and as you have a whole tide 
before you, you will be gone too far out before they 
"Can C(^me down ; for they will come away at high- 
water ; and as they have twenty miles to come, you'll 
get near t>vo hours of them by the difference of the 
tide, not reckoning the length of the way. Befides, 
as they are only boats, and not ftiips, they will not 
venture to follow you far out to fea, efpecially if it 
blows. 

Well, faid I, you have been very kind in this ; What 
Ihall 1 do for you, to make you amends ? Sir, fays he, 
you may not be fo willing to make me amends, b'e- 
caufe you rnay not be convinced of the truth of it ; I 
will make an ofter to you : 1 have nineteen months pay

fevcti months pay due to him ; if you will make good 
our pay to us, we will go along with you : if you find 
nothing more in it, we will defire no more; but if wc 
do convince yon that we, have faved your life, and the 
Ihip, and the lives of all the men in her,, we will leave the 
reft to you. 

1 confented to this readily, and went immediately on 
board, and the two men with me. As foon as I came 
to the (hip fide, my partner, who was on board, came 
but on the quarter-deck, and called to me, with a great 
deal of joy, O ho I O ho ! we have (lopped the leak ! 
we have (lopped the leak ! Say you fo ! faid I, thank 
God I but weigh the anchor then immediately : Weigh! 
fays he ; what do you mean by that ? What is the mat- 
ter? fays he. A(k no queftions, faid I, but all hands to 
work and weigh, without loling a minute. He was 
furprifed ; but, howe^rer, he called the captain, and he 
immediately ordered the anchor to be got up ; and 
though the tide was not quite done, yet a little land-breeze 
blowing, we Hood out to fea. Then I called hira 
into the cabin, and told him the (lory at large ; and we 
called in the men, and they told us the reft of it ; but as 
it took us up a great deal of time, fo before we had done, 
a feamen comes to the cabin door, and calls out to us 
that the captain bade him tell us we were- chafed : 
Chafed I faid I, by whom and by what ? By (ivedoops, 
or boats, faid the fellow, full or men. Very well, faid 
1 ; then it is apparent there is fomething in it. In the 
next place, I ordered all our men to be called up, and 
told them, that there was a defign to feize thp (hip, 
and to take us for pirates ; and afked them if they 
would lland by us, and by one another ? The men an- 
fwered, cheerfully, that one and all, they would live aad 
die with us. Then I afked the captain, what way he 
thought beft for us to manage a fight with him ; for, 
tefift them 1 refolved we would, and that to the laft 
drop. He faid readily, that the way was to keep them 
off with our great (hot, as long as we could, and 
then to fire at thc;m with our fmall arms, to keep ihem 
from boarding us ; but when neither of thefe would do 
5tny longer, we would retire to our clofe quarters ; per- 
haps they had not materials to break open our bulk-heads, 
or get in upon us.

Tte gunner had in the mean time, orders to bring two 
guns to bear fore and aft, out of the fteerage, to clear 
the deck, and load them with mtt.(iq\iet-bullets, and I'mall 
pieces of old iron, and what next came to hand ; and thus 
We made ready for fight : but all this while kept out to 
lea, with wind enough, and could fee the boats at a di(^ 
tance, being five large long-boats following us, with all 
the fail they could make. 

Two of thefe boats, which by our glafl!es, we could 
fee, were En^lifh, had out-failed the reft, were near two 
leagues ahead of them, and gained upon us confiderably; 
fo that we found they would come up with us : upon 
which we fired a gun without a (hot, to intimate that 
they fliould bnng to : atid we put out a flag of truce, 
as a fignal for parley : but they kept crowding after us, 
till they came within (hot ; upon this we took in our 
white fl«g, they having made no anfwer to it, hung out 
the reg flao:, and fired at them with ihot : Notwithftand- 
ing this, they came on till they were near enough to call 
to them with a fpeaking trumpet, which we had on 
hoard : fo we called them, and bade them keep off at 
their peril. 

It was all onej they crouded after us, and endeavoured 
to come under our. ftern, fo to board us on our quarter ; 
upon which, feeing they were refolutefor mifchief, and 
depended upon the ftrength that followed them^ 1 ordered 
to bring the fhip to, fo that they lay upon our broad- 
fide, when immediately we fired five guns at them : one 
of them had been levelled fo true as to carry away the 
ftern of the hinJerraoft boat, and bring them to the 
jaeceffity of taking down their fail, and- running all to 
the head of the boat to keep her from finking ; fo fhe lay 
by, apd had enough of it; but, feeing the fore mo ft boit 
ftill crowd on alter us, we made ready to fire at her in 
particular. 

While this was doing, one of three boats that .was 
behind, being forwarder than the otl^er two, made up 
to the boat which we had difabled, to relieve her, and we 
could afterwards fee her take out the men ; we called 
again to the foremoft boat, and offered a truce to par- 
ley again, and to know what was her buiinefs with us ; 
l)ut had no anfwer ; only (he crowded dole under our

quickly ready again, fired among them a fecond time; 
one {ht>t of which, though it mined the boat itfelf, yet 
fell in among the men, and we could eaiily fee, had 
done a great deal of mifchief among them ; but we, 
taking no notice of that, weared the (hip again, and 
brought our quarter to bear upon them ; an J firing three 
guns more, we found the bo^t was fpht almoft to pieces ; 
in: particular, her rudder^ and a piece of her Hern, waS 
ihot quite away ; fo they handed their fail immediately, 
and were in great diforder ; but, to comi)lete their mis- 
fortune, our gunner let fly ^ two guns at them again; 
where he hit them we could not tell, but we found 
the boat was finking, and fome of the men already in 
the water : upon this I immediately manned out our 
pinnace, which we had kept clofe by our fide, with or- 
ders to pick up fome of the men, if they could, and fave 
them from drowning, and immediately to come on board 
. with them ; becaufe we . faw the reil of the boats be- 
gan to come up. ' Our men in the pinnace, followed 
their orders, and took up three men ; one of which was 
jull drowning, and it was a good while before we 
could recover him. As foon as they were on board, we 
crowded all the fail "yye could make, and Itood farther 
out to fea ; and we found, that when the father three 
boatis>" came up to the firft two, they gave over their 
chace. 

Being thus delivered from a danger, which, though I 
Icnew not the reafon of it, yet feemed to be much greater 
than I apprehended ; I took care that we would change 
our courfe, and not let an}*^ one imagine whither we were 
going; fo we flood out to fea eaftward, quite out of the 
courfe of all European fhips, >rhether they were bound 
to China, or any where elfe, within the commerce of the 
European nations. 

When we were now at fea, we began to confult 
with the two feamen, and enquire firfl, what the 
meaning of all this ihould be ? The Dutchman let us

into the fecret of it at once ; telling us. That the fel- 
low that fold us the (hip, as we faid, was no more than 
a thief, that had run away with her. Then he told us 
how the captain, whofe name too he mentioned, though 
I do not remember it now, was treacheroufly murdered 
"by the natives on the'coaft of Malacca, with three of his 
men ; and that he, this Dutchman, and four more, got 
into the woods, where they wandered about a great 
"while^ till at length, he, in particular, in a miraculous 
manner, made his efcape, and fwam off to a Dutch ihip, 
which failing near the fhore, in its way from China, had 
fent their boat on (hore for frelh water ; that he durft 
not come to that part of the (hore where the boat^ was^ 
but made fhift in the night, to take "in the water farther 
off, and fwimming a great while, at laft the ihip's boat 
took him up. 

He then told us, that he went to Batavia, where two 
of the feamen belonging to the fhip had arrived, hav- 
ing deferted the reft in their travels ; and gave an ac- 
count, that the fellow who had run away with the fhip,* 
fold her at Bengal to a fet of pirates, which were gone a 
cruifing in her ; and that they had already taken an Eng- 
lifli fhip, and two Dutch fhips, very richly laden. 

This latter part we found to concern us diredlly, and 
though we kne^y it to be falfe, yet, as^tny partner faid, 
very well, if we had fallen into their hands, and they had 
fuch a prepofleflion againft:«tw' before hand, it had been 
in -^ain for us to have defei^i^f'giiourfelves, or to hope for 
any gopd quarters at thei,r^^„4«iids, efpeCially confidering^ 
that our accufers had been our judges, and that we could 
have cxpefted nothing from them but what rage would 
have didivted, and ungoverned paflion have executed r ' 
and therefore it was his opinion,, we Ihould go diredtly 
hack to Bengal, from whence we came without putting 
in at any port whatever ; becaufe there we could give an 
account of ourfelves, and could prove where we were 
when the fhip put in, whom we bought her of, and the 
like : and which was more than all the reft, if wc were

I was fomc time of my partner's opinion ; but after ft 
little more ferious thinking, I told him, I thought it waj 
a very great hazard for us to attempt returning to Ben- 
gal, for that we were on the wrong fide of the (Iraights 
of Malacca ; and that if the alarm was given, we ihouM 
be fure to be way-laid on every fide, as well by the 
i)utch of Batavia, as the Englifh elfewhere ; that if we 
ihould be taken, as it were, running away, we (hould 
-even condemn ourfclves, and there would want no more 
evidence to deftroy us. I alfo afked the Engliih failor's 
opinion, who faid he was of my mind, and that we fhould 
certainly be taken. 

I'his danger a little ftartled my partner, and all the 
ihip's company ; and we immediately refolved to go 
away to the coaft of Tonquin, and fo on to China ; and 
from thence purfuing the firll defign, as to trade, fini 
ibme way or other to difpofe of the ftiip, and come back 
in fome of the vcflels of the country, fuch as we could 
get. This was approved of as the beft method for out 
fecurity; and accordingljr we fteered away N. N. E. 
keeping above fifty leagues off from the ufual courfe to - 
the eaftward. 

This, however, put us to fome inconveniences ; for 
fofl, the winds, when wc came to that diftance from the 
^ore, feemed to be more fteadily ^gainft us, blowing al- 
inoft trade, as we call it, from the ead, and E. N. £• 
fo that wc were a long whiie upon our voyage ; and we 
were but ill provided wif^fJi^jiAuals for fo long a run ; 
and, which was flill worfe^»*f>v^ was fome danger, that 
thofe EfiglKh and Ihitdi fhips, whofe boats purfued us, 
whereof fome were bound that w<ay , might be got in be- 
fore us ; and if not, fome other fliip, bound to China, 
might have information of us from them, and purfue us 
with the fame rrgoor, 

I mufl confefs, I was.now ve;ry uneafy, and thought 
inyfelf, including the late cfcape from the long boats, 
to have been in rfie moft dangerous condition that ever 
I was in through all my paft life ; for, whatever ill cir- 
cumftances I had been in, 1 was never purfued for a thief 
before ; nor had I ever done any thing that merited the 
name of diihoneil, or fraudulent, much lefs thievilh. ' I 
had ctiiefly been mine owa eneny ; or^ as I may rightly 

fay» 



%) 1 tad been tjobo4y'fi enemy but my own. But 
bow I was embarrafled in the word condition imagina- 
ble ; for though I was perfeftly innocent, I was in no 
Condition to make that innocence appear. And if I had 
teen taken, it had been under a, fuppofed guilt of the 
worll kind ; at lead, a tirime eftetmcd lb among the peo* 
pie 1 had to do with. 

This made me very anxions to Make ian efcape, though 
vrhich way to do it, I knew riot ; or What port or place 
we (hould go to. My partner feeing me 'thus dejeded, 
though he was the moft concerned at firli, began to en- 
tourage me ] and defcribmg to me the feveral ports o£ 
that coaft, told me, he Would put in on the coaH o 
Cochinchina, or the bay of Tonquin ; intending to go 
tifterwards to Macao^ a town once in the poffeffion of the 
Portuguefe, and where flill a great many European fami* 
lies reSded, and particularly the miflionary priefts ufually 
Went thither , in order to their going forward to China, 

Hither then we tefolved to go-; and ^ccordinglj^^ 
though after a tediou^s and irregular cottrfe, and very 
much ftreightened for provifions, we came within fight 
of the coaft very early in the morning-; and \ipbn reflec* 
tion upon the paft circumftances we were in, and the 
ilanger, if we had not efcaped, we Tefolved to put into a 
fmall rivier. Which, however, had depth enough of wa* 
tcr for ITS, and to fee if We could, either over land, ot 
by tht fhip's pinnace, come to know what fhips were 
in any port thereabouts. This happy Hep was, indeed^ 
our deliverance 5 folr though we did 'not immediately fee 
any European {hips in- the bay of Tonquin, yet, the 
next morning, there came into the bay tWo Dutch fhips, 
and U third without a)iy colours fpread oUt, but which 
we beJieved to be a Dutchman, faffed by at about two 
leagues diilance, fleering for the coaft of China ; and ia 
the afternoon we went by two Englifti fhips, fteering 
the fame courfe; and thus we 'thought, we faw ourfelves 
befet with enemies, both one way and the other. The 
place we wefe in waa^wild and barbarous, the people 
thieves, even by occupation or profeflion ; and though 
it is true, we had not much to &ek of them, and ex- 
cept getting a few provilipns, cared not how little we 
'^a!d tQ do with them^ yet it was with much difficulty

that we kept ourfelves from being infulted by them (fevc- 
Tal ways. 

We were in a fmall river of this country, within a 
few leagues of its utmoft limits northward ; and by our 
boat we coafted north-eaft to the point of land which 
■opens to the great bay of Tonquin ; and it was in 
this beating up along the (hore, that we difcovered as 
above, that in a word, v^c were furrounded with ene- 
mies* The people we were among were the moll bar- 
barous of all the inhabitants of the coaft; having no 
correfpondence with any other nation, and dealing only 
in fifh and oil, and fuch grofs commodities ; and it 
may be pai-ticularly feen, that they arc, as 1 faid, the 
jnod barbarous of any of the inhabitants ; viz. that 
among other cuiloms they have this one, that if any 
veiTel had the misfortune to be ihipwrecked upon their 
coaft, they prcfently make the men all prifoners ; that 
is to fay, ftaves ; and it was not long before we found a 
fpice of their kindncfs this way, on the occafion fol- 
lowing:. 

J have obferved above, that our fhip fprung a leak 
at fea^ and that we could not find it out ; and however 
it happened, that as I have faid, it was ftopped unex- 
pcdledly, in the happy minute of our being to be feized 
hy the Dutch and Englifh fhips, hear the bay of Siam; 
yet, as we did not find the fhip fo perfectly tight and 
ibund as we defired, we refolved, while we were in this 
place, to lay her on fhore, take out what heavy things 
we had on board, which were not many, and to wafli 
and clean her bottom ; and, if pofiible, to find out where 
the leaks were. 

Accordingly, Jiaving lightened xhe fhip, and brought 
all our guns, and other moveable things, to one fide, 
we tried to bring her down, that we might come at her 
bottom : for, on fecond thoughts, we did not care to lay 
ber dry aground, neither could we find out a proper 
place for it. 

The inhabitants, who had never been acquainted witt 
fpch a fight, came wondering down to the (hore to look 
at us ; and feeing the fhip lie down on one fide in fuch a 
manner, and heeling towards the fhore, and not feeing 
our men, who we^re at work on her bottom^ with flages, 

and

and \^ith their boats on the off fide, they prefently con- 
cluded that the {hip was caft away, and lay fo very faft 
on the ground. 

On this fuppofition they came all about us in two or 
three hours time, with ten or twelve large boats, having 
fome of them eight, fome ten men in a boat, intending, 
no doubt, to have come on board and plundered the 
fliip, and if they had found us there, to have carried us^ 
away for flaves to their king, or whatever they caU him, 
for we knew not who was their governor. 

When they came up to the fhip, and began to row 
round her, they dilcovered us all hard at work, on the 
outfide of the ihip's bottom and fide, waihing, and 
graving, and flopping, as every feafaring man knows 
how. 

They Hood for a while gazing at us, and we, wha 
were a little furprifed, could not irnaginc what their 
dcfign was ; but, being willing to be fure, we took 
this opportunity to get fome of us into the (hip, and 
others to hand down arms and ammunition^ to thofe 
that were at work to defend themfelves with, if there 
Ihould be occaiion : and it was no more than need : 
for, in lefs than a quarter of an. hour's conl'uUation^ 
they agreed, it feems, that the fliip was really a wreck ;. 
that we were all at work, endeavouring to fave her, or 
to fave our lives by the help of our boats ; and whenr 
we handed our arms into the boats, they concluded, 
by that motion, that we were endeavouring to fave 
fome of our goods. Upon this they took it for granted 
they all belonged to them : and away they came di- 
redly upon our men, as if it had been in a line of 
battle. 

Our men, feeing fo many of them, began to be 
frighted ; for we lay but in an ill poilure to fight,, 
and cried out to us to know what they ihould do. I 
immediately called to the men who worked upon the 
ftage^' to flip them down, and get up the fide into the 
ihip :. and bade thofe in the ooat to row round and 
come on board ; and thofe few of us who were on 
board, worked with all the ftrength and hands we hadf, 
to bring tte fhip to rights: but, however, neither the 
©fin upon the iiage, nor thofe in the boats, could do

as they were ordered, before the Cochinchinefe were u^pon 
them : and» with two of their boats boarded our long- 
boat, and began to lay hold of the men as their prifoners. 

The firft mail they laid hold of was an EngHih feaman, 
a flout ftrong fellow, who having a mufquet in his hand, 
never offered to fire it, but Jaid it down in the boat, like 
a fool, as 1 thought. But he underftood his bufmefs bet- 
ter than 1 Gould teach bin) ; for he grappled the Pagan, 
and dragged hira by main force out of iheir own boat in- 
to ours ; where, taking him by the two ears, he beat his 
head fo againft the boat's gunnel, that the fellow died in- 
llantly in his hands.; and in the mean time, a Dutchman, 
who flood next, took up the mufquet, and with the but- 
end of it, fo laid about them, that he knocked down five 
of them, who attempted to enter the b(pat; but this was 
little towards refiiting thirty or forty men, who fearlefs, 
becaufe ignorant of their danger, began to thfbw thcm- 
lelves into the long-boat, where we had but five men to 
defend it ; but one accident gave our men a complete 
vidlory, which deferved our laughter rather than any 
thing elfe ; and that was this : 

^ Our carpenter being prepared to gr^ve the outfide of 
the ihip, as well as to pay the feams where he had caulk- 
ed her, to flop the leaks, had got two kettles^ jull let 
down into the boat ; one filled with boiling pitch, and 
the other with rofin, tallow, and oil, and fuch itUfF as 
the fliipwrights ufed for that work; and the man that 
attended the carpenter had a great iron ladle in his hand^ 
•with which he fupplied the men that were at work with 
'that hot fluflF; two of the enemy's men entered the 
boat jui^ where this fellow Hood, being in the fore- 
iheets ; he immediately faluted them with a ladleful of 
the fluff, boiling hot, which fo burpt and fcalded them^ 
being half-naked, that they roared out like two bulls, 
and enraged with the fire, leaped both into the fea. 

The carpenter faw it, and cried out, Well done. Jack, 
give them fome more of it; when flepping forward 
himfelf, he takes one of their mops, and dipping it in 
the pitch-pot, he and his man threw it among them fo 
plentifully, that, in fhort, of all the men in three boatSj^ 
there was not ooe that was not ftalded and burnt with

5t In a moft frightful pitiful manner, and made fuch aiu 
' howling and crying, that I never heard a worfe noife,r 
and, indeed, nothing like it ; for it was worth obferving, 
that though pain naturally makes all people cry outi* 
yet every nation have a particular way of exclamation, 
* and make noifes as different from one another as their 
fpeech. I cannot give the noife thefe creatures made 
a better name than howling, nor a name more proper 
to the tone of it ; for I never heard any thing more, 
like the noife of the wolves, which, as I have faid, 
I heard howl in the foreft on the frontiers of Lan*' 
guedoc. ^ 

I was never pYeafed with a vY^ory better in my Fife 5 
not only as it was a perfect furprife to me, and that our 
danger was imminent before ; but as we got this victory 
without any bloodfhed, except of that man the fellow 
killed with his naked hands, and which I was very muck 
concerned at : for I was iick of killing fuch poor favage 
wretches, even though it was in my own defence, know- 
ing, they came'on errands which they thought juft, and 
, knew no better ; and that though it may be a juft thing, 
becaufe neceflary , for there is no neceffary wickednefs in 
nature : yet I thought it was a fad life, when we muft be 
always obliged to he killing our fellow-creatiires to pr&- 
ferve purfelvcs ; and indeed, 1 think fo ftill ; and I would^r. 
even now, fuffer a great deal, rather than 1 would take 
away the life even of the worft perfon injuring me. I 
believe alfo, all confidering people, who knew the value 
of life, would be' of nny opinion, if they entered lerioufly 
into the confideration of it. 

But to return to my dory : all the while this was do-* 
ing, rriy partner and I, who managed the reft of the mei^ 
on board, had with great dexterity, brought the Ihip 
almoft to rights; and having gotten the guns into 
their places again, the gunner called to me, to bid our 
boat get out of the way, for he would let fly among 
them. I called back again to him, and bid him not 
offer to fire, for the carpenter would do the work with- 
out him ; but bid him heat another pitch kettle; which 
our cook, who was on board, took care of. But the 
enemy wa's fo terrified with what they met with in their

fome of them, that were fartheft off feeing the ihip fwitn, 
as it were, upright, began, as we fuppofed, to fee their 
miftake, and gave over the entcrprife, finding it not as 
they expefted. Thus we got clear of thisrnerry fight ; 
and having gotten fome rice, and fome roots and bread, 
"With about iixteen good big hogs, on board, two days 
before, we refolved to ftay here no longer, but go for- 
"ward, whatever came of it; for we made no doubt but 
•we (hould be furrounded the next dav with rojrues enough, 
perhaps more than our pitch-kettle would difpofe of for 
•us. 

VVe, therefore, got all our things on board the fame 
evening, and the next morning, were ready to fail. In 
ihe mean time, lying at an anchoj fome dillancefrom the 
^ftore, we were not fo much concerned, being now in a 
fighting pollure, as well as in a failing pofture, if any 
enemy hacl prefented. The next day, having finifhed our 
twork within board, and finding our Ihip was perfectly 
healed of all her leaks, we fet fail ; we would have gone 
into the bay of Tonquin, for we wanted to inform our- 
S(M^s of what was to be known concerning the Dutch 
fhips that had been there ; but we durft not Hand in there, 
;becaufe we had feen feveral Ihips go in, as we fuppoied, 
•but a little before; fo we kept on N. E. towards the ifle 
of Formofa, as much afraid of being feen by a Dutch 
or Englifh merchant fhip, as a Dutch or Englifh mer- 
chant fhip in the Mediterranean is of an Algerine man 
of war. 

When wc were thus got to fea, we kept on N. E. as 
Jf we would go to the Manillas or the Phillippine iflands, 
and this we did, that we might not fall into the way of 
any oi the European (hips; and then we fleered north 
again, till we came to the latitude of 22 deg. 20 min. by 
which means we made the ifland of Formofa dire6tly, 
■where we came to an anchor, in order to get water and 
frefh provifions, which the people there, who are very 
pourteous and civil in their manners, fupplied us with 
^willingly, and dealt very fairly and pundtually with usin 
all their agreements and bargains ; which is what we did 
not find among* other people, and may be owing to the 
remains of chriflianity, which was once planted here by 
a Dutch milEonary pf.proteftants, and is a telUmony of

wliat I have often obfcrved, viz. that the chriftian rellglcH 
always civilizes the people, and reforms their manners-, 
'where it is received, whether it works faving efFedls uj>- 
on them or no. 

From hence we failed dill north, keeping the ooaft oT 
China at an equal di{lance,*till we knew we were beyond' 
all the ports of China, where our European fliips ufually 
come i being refolved, if poflible, not to fall into any 
of their hands, efpecially in this country, where, as our 
circumftances were, we could not fail of being entirely- 
ruined ; nay, fo great was my fear in particular, as to 
niy being taken by them, that I believe firmly 1 would 
much rather have chofento have fallen into the hands of' 
the Spanifh inquifition; 

Being now come to the latitude of 30 degrees', we re* 
folved to put into the firft trading port we fhoukl come 
at : and flanding in for the (hore, a boat came ofl:* two 
leagues to us, with an old Port uguefe pilot on boards 
who, knowing us to be an European fhip, came to offer 
his fervice, which, indeed, we were very glad of, and 
took him. on board : upon which, without afking us- 
whither we would go, he difmified the* boat he came in^, 
and fent k back. 

1 thought it was- now fo nnich irv. our choice to make 
the old man carry us whither we would, that I began to 
talk with him about carrying of us to the Gulph of Nan^ 
quin, which is the moil northern part of the coaft of 
China. The old maa faid he knew the Gulph of Nan«-

chafed all forts of China goods, as cheap as we couid at 
Nanqiiin. 

Not being able to put the old man out ofhrs talk, of

we were gentlemen, as well as merchants, and that we

famous court of the monai^ch of China. Why theu, 
fays the old man, you (hould go to Ningpo, where, by 
the river that runs into the fea there, you may go up 
within five leagues of the great canal. This canal is a 
Navigable made dream, which goes through the heart of 
all that vail empire of Chinai^ crofles all the rivers, pafles 
feme coniiderable hills by the help of fluices and gates, 
and goes up to the city of Pekin, being in length near 
270 leagues. 

Well, faid I, Seignior Portugucfe, but that is not our 
buiinefs now : the great queftion is. If yon can carry us 
up to the city of Nanquin, from 'whence we can travel 
to Pekin afterwards ? Yes, he faid, he could do fo very 
well, and there was a great Dutch fhip gone up that 
way juft before. This gave me a little fhock ; a Dutch 
ihip was now our terror, and we had much rather have 
met the devil, at leatl if he had not come in too fright- 
ful a figure : we depended upon it, that a Dutch thip 
w^ould be our dellrudlion, for we were in no condition 
to fight them ; all the ihips they trade with in thofe parts 
being k>£ great burden, and of much greater force than 
we were. 

The old man found me a little confufed, and nndev 
fom^ concern, when he named a Dutch fhip ; and faid 
to nie. Sir, you need be under no apprehenfion of the 
Dutch, I iuppofe they are not now at war with your 
nation. No, faid I, that's true ; but I know not what 
liberties men may take, when they are out o{ the reach 
of the laws of the country. Why, faid he, you arena 
pirates, what need you fear ? 1 hey will not meddle 
with peaceable merchants, lure. 

If I had any blood in my body that did not fly up in- 
to my face at that word, it was hindered by fome fiop in 
the veflels appointed by nature to circulate it ; for it put 
me into the greateft diforder and confufion imao-inable. 
nor was it poffible for me to conceal it lb, but that the 
old man cafily perceived it. ' 

Sir, faid he, I find you are in fome diforder in your 
thoughts at my talk ; pray be pleafed to go which way 
you think fit ; and depend upon it, 1*11 do you all the

t^ go in particular; and 1 am fomething more fo, for 
"what you faid about pirates : I hope there are no pirates 
in thcfe feas, we are but in an ill condition to meet with 
them : for you fee w^ have bqt fmall force,- and but very' 
weakly manned. 

O, ctiTy faid he, do not l»e concerned ; J do not know 
that there have been any pirates in thefe feas thefe fifteea 
years, except one, which was feen, as! hear, in the bay 
of Siam, about a month fince ; but you may be afTurcd^ 
Ihe is gone to the fonthward : nor wa* fhe a fhip of any 
great "force, or fit for the work ; (he was not built for a^^ 
privateer, but was run away with by a reprobate crew 
that were on board, after the captain and fome of his» 
men had" been murdered by thc^ Malaccans, at- or near 
the illand of Sumatra. 

What ! faid I, feeming to know nothing of the nrat-- 
ter. Did they murder the captaiah No, faid he, I do 
not underftand that they murdered him ;. but, as they af- 
terwards ran away with the fhip, it is generally believed 
they. betrayed himinto the hands of the Malaccans j who* 
did murder' him : and, perhaps, they procured them to* 
do it. Why then,, faid I,, they deferve death, as much 
as if they had done it themfelves; Nay, faid the old- 
man, they do deferve it : and they will certainly have iff 
if they, light upon any Engliih or Dutch Ihip : for they 
have all agreed together, that, if^ they meet that rogue,, 
they wHl give him no quarter. 

But, faid I to him, you fay the pirate js gone out of^* 
thefe feas; how can they meet with him then ? Why" 
that is true, faid he, they do fay fo : but ^e was, as I 
tell you, in the bay of Siam- in the river Cambodia, and*:! , 
was difcovered there by fome Dutchmen who belonged

will be fure to know him ; and whereever they find 
him, they have vowed to give no quarter to either the 
captain or the feamen, bat to hang them all up at the 
yard-arm ,\ 

What ! faid T, will they execute them right or wrong, 
hang them firft, and judge them afterwards ? O, Sir ! 
faid the old pilot, there is no need to make a formal bu- 
linefs of it with fuch rogues as thofe ; let them tie them 
back to back^ and fet them a diving ; it is no more than 
they rightly dqferve. • 

I knew 1 had my old man fad aboard, and that he 
could do me no harm \ fo that I turned {hort upon him :, 
Well, now. Seignior, faid I, and this is the very reafon 
why I would have you carry us to Nanquin, and not to 
put back to Macao, or to any other part of the country, 
where theEnglifh or Dutch Ihips come : for be it known 
to you. Seignior, thofe captains of the Englifh and Dutch 
Ihips are a parcel of rafh, proud, infolent fellows, that 
neither know what belongs to juftice, or how to behave 
themfelves, as the laws of God and nature dLredi: ; but 
being proud of their offices, arul not underftanding their 
power, they would adt the murderers to pimiih robbers,; 
would take upon them to infult menfallely accufed, and 
determine them guilty without due' erM3[uiry, and per- , 
haps I may live to call fome pf jhem to an account for 
k, where they may be taught how juflice is to be exe- 
cuted ; and that no man ought to be treated as a criminal 
till fom^ evidence may behad of the crime, and that he 
is the man. 

With this I told him, that this was the very fliip they 
had attacked : and gave him a full account of the fkir- 
mifh we had vwth their boats, and how foollflily and 
coward-like they had behaved. I told him all tne ftory 
of our buying the ihip, and how the Dutchmen ferved 
ns. I told him the reafons I had to believe that this ftory 
of killing the mafter by the Malaccans.was not true ; as 
alfo the rurming away with the fhip.; but that it was all ' 
a fi(5lion of their own, to fUorjreit that the men were turnr* 
ied pirates ; and they ought to have been fare it was fo, 
before they had ventured to attack us by furprife, and 
oblige U5 to refift them ; adding^ that they would have

the blood of thofe men, who were killed there, in out 
juft defence,* to anfwer for. 

The old man was ama;ted at this relation, and told us, 
we were very much in the right to go away to the north ;. 
and that if he might adviie us, it fhould be to fell the fhip 
in China, which we might very well \lo, and buy or 
build another in the country : and faid he, tho' you will 
BOt get fo good a fliip, yet you may get one able enough 
to carry you and all your goods back again to Bengal, or , 
any where elfe, 

I told Jiim I would take his advice, when I came to 
any port where 1 could find a fhip for my turn, or get 
any culiomer to buy this. He replied, 1 fhould meet 
with cuftomers enough for the Ihip at Nanquin, and that 
a Chinefejunk would ferve me very well to gO back 
again ; and that he would procure me people both to buy 
one, and fell the other. 

Well, but, Seignior, fays I, as you fay they' know the. 
fhip fo well, I may, perhaps, if I follow your meafures, 
be inflrumental to bring fome honeft innocent men into- 
a terrible broil, and perhaps be murdered in cold bldod ;. 
for wherever they find the fhip they will prove the guilt 
uppn the men, by proving this was the fhip : and fa 
innocent men may probably be overpowered and mur- 
dered. Why, faid the old man, Fli find out a way to 
prevent that alfo : for as 1 know all thofe commanders 
you fpeak of very well, and fhall fee them, all as they 
pafs by, I will be fure to fet them to rights in. the thing, 
and let them know that they had been fo much in the. 
wrong ; that though the people who were on board at 
iirft might run away *with the fhip, yet it was not true 
that they had turned pirates : and that in particular thofe. 
were not the men that firfl went off with the fhip, but 
innocently bought her for their trade :. and I am per- 
fuaded they will fo far believe me, as, at leail, to a<5l , 
more cautioufly for the time to come. Well, faid I, and 
will yoii deliver one meffage to them from me ? Yes> 
1 will, fays he, if you will give it under your hand, in 
writing, that I may be able to prove it came from you, 
and not out of my own head. J anfwered, that I would 
readily give it him under my hand. So J took a pen,, 
and inkp and paper, "and wrote at large the flory of

aflaulting me with the long-boats, &c. the pretended 
reafon of it,' and the unjuft cruel defign of it ; and con^* 
eluded to the commanders that they had done what they:/ 
not only ihould have been alhamed of, but alfo, that if 
ever they came to England, and I lived to fee them there,,. 
they fhould alt pay dearly for it, if the laws of my 
country were not grown out of ufe before f arrived there. 

My old pilot read this over and over again, and afked 
me feveral times if I would fiand to it. I anfwered, I* 
would {land to it as long as 1 had any thing left in the- 
world^ being fenfible that I fhould, one time or other,, 
find an opportunity to put it home to them. But we 
had no occalion ever to let the pilot carry this^ letter •. 
for he never went back again. While thofc things were 
paffing between us, by way of dii'eourfe, we went for- 
ward dire6Uy for Nanquin, and, in about thirteen days- 
fail, came to anchor at the fouth weft point of the 
great gulph of Nanquin : where, by the way, I came by 
accident to underftand, that the two Dutch ihips were' 
gone that length befdre me, and that I fliould oertainly- 
fiall into their hands. I oonfulted my partner again in* 
this exigency, and he was as much at a lofs as- 1 was,, 
and would very gladly have b^en fafe on fhore almoffe. 
any where. However, 1' was not in fuch perplexity, 
neither, but I alked the old pilot if there was no- 
creek or harbour, which I' might put ktp, and purfue 
my bufinefs with the Chinefe privately, and be in na» 
danger pf the enemy ? He told me,, if L would fail to 
the fouthward about two and forty, leagues^ there was a 
little port called Quinchang, where the fathers'^ of the 
miffion ufually landed from Macao,, on their^ progrefs to 
teach the Chriftian religion to the Chinefe, and where* 
no European ihips ever put in ; and, if 1 thought proper, 
to put in there,^. I might confider what farther courfe to 
take when I was on fhore. He oonfeffed, he faid,. it- 
was not a place for merchants, except, that at forae 
certain times they had a kind of a fair there, when the 
merchants from Japaa came over thither to buy the Ghi-^- 
nefe merchandizes. 

We all agreed to go back to this place ; the name of 
the port, as he called it, 1 may, perhaps, fpeli wrong i 
3 for

for I do not particularly remember it, having loft thia^v 
together with the names of many other places fet dovva- 
in a little pocket-book, which was Ipoiled by the water».' 
on an accident which 1 fhall relate m its order : btit this 
1 remember, that the Chinele or Japanefe merchants we 
correipond with, call it by a different n^me from thafe 
"which oar Portuguefe pilot gave it, and pronounced it as 
above, Quinchang. 

As we were unanimous^in our refoluHopsto go to this- 
place, we weighed the next day, having onty gone twice, 
on fhore, where we were to get frefh water ; on both 
which occafions the people of the country were very civiL 
to us, and brought us abundance of things to fell to us; 
I mean of proviiions, plants, roots, tea,, rice, and fome 
fowls*; but nothing without money. 

We came to the other port (the wind being contrary) 
not till five days; but it was very much to our fatisfac-^ 
tion ; and I was joyful, and, I may fay, thankful, when, 
I fet my foot fafe on (bore; refolving, and my partner 
too, that if it was poflible to difpofe of ourfelve» ^nd ef- 
fecSts any other way, though not every way to our fatif* 
fa6lion, we would never fet one foot on board that un-- 
happy veffel again ; and indeed, I mull acknowledge, 
that of all the circumftances of Ufe^ that ever I had any. 
experience of, nothing makes mankind ib completely mi- 
fcrable as that of being in conllant fear. \Vell does the 
fcripture fay, ^ The fear of man brings a fnarc ;.' it is a 
life of death : and the mind is fo entirely fuppreflfed by it,, 
that it is capable of no relief; the animal fpirits (ink, and.^ 
all the vigour of nature, which ufually fupports men un* 
der other afflidions, and is prefent to them in the greateft 
exigencies, fails them here. 

N^or did it fail of its ufual operation^ upon the fancy, 
. by heightening every danger ; reprefenting the Englilh 
and Dutch captaitis to be men incapable ot hearing rca- 
fon, or diliinguifhing between honed men and rogues ; 
or between a llory calculated fbr our own turn, made out 
of nothing, on purpofe to deceive, and a true genuine 
account of our whole voyage, progrefs, and defign ; for 
we might many ways have convinced any realbnable- 
creature that^we were not pirates : the goods we had oa 
board, the courie wc Iteered, our frankly fhewing our-» 

felves*

felves, and enterinsc into ' fuch and fuch ports ; ereii* 
our very manner, the force we had, the number of men',, 
the few arms, little ammunition, and fhort pro\i{ions;. 
all thefe .would have ferved to convince any man that 
■we were no pirates. I'he opium, and other goods we 
had on board, would make it appear the- fhip had 
been at Bengal : the Dutchman, who, it was^ faid, had 
the names of all the men that were in the ihip, might 
eafily fee that we were a mixture of Englifh, Por- 
tuguefe, and Indians, and buf two Dutchmen on board; 
Xhefe, and many othfer particular circumftances, might 
have made it evident to the underftanding of any com- 
mander, whoi^ hands we might fall into, that we weie 
no pirates. 

But fear, that blmd ufelefs paflion, worked another 
way, and threw us into the vapours ; it bewildered our 
imderftandings^ and let the imagination at work, to 
form a thoufand terrible things, that, perhaps, might 
never happen : we firll fuppofed, asj indeed, every body 
had related to us, that thefeamen on board the Engliih 
and Dutch (hips, but efpecially the Dutch, were fo en- 
raged at the name of a pirate, and efpecially at our 
beating off their boats, and efcaping, that they would 
not give themfelves leave to enquire whether we were 
pirates or no ; but would execute us off-band,- as- we caH: 
it, without giviiTg us any room! for a defence. We re- 
flecfled that there was really fo much apparent evidence 
before them, that they would foarce enquire after any 
more ; a&, firfl, that- the {hip was certainly the fame^ 
and that fome of the feamen among them knew hcr^ 
and h^d been on board her ; and fecondly, that when 
we had intelligence at the river Cambodia, that they 
we^re coming down to examine us, we fought their boats, 
and fled ; fb, that we made no doubt but they were as 
fully fatisfied of our being privates, as we were fatisfied 
of the contrary ; and 1 often faid, I knew not- but I- 
ihould have been apt to have taken |he little circum- 
ftances for evidence, if the tables were turned, and my 
^afe was theirs ; and have made no fcruple 'of cutting 
all the crew to pieces, without believing, or, perhaps, 
confidering,, what th«y might have to offer in thei»

But

But let that be how it \yill, thofe were our appre- 
henfions ; and both my partner and I too fcarce flept a 
night without dreaming of halters and yard-arms, that 
is to iay gibbets ; of fighting, and being taken ; of 
killing, and being killed ; and one night I was in 
fuch a fury in my dream, fancying the Dutchmen had 
boarded us, and 1 was knocking one of their feamen 
down, that I ftruck my double fift againft the fide of 
the cabin I lay in, with fuch a force as wounded my 
hand molt grievoufly, broke my knuckles, and cut and 
bruifed the tlefh ; fo that it not only waked me out of 
my fleep, but I was once afraid I Ihould have lofl two of 
my fingers. 

Another apprehcnfion I had, was of the cruel ufage 
we (hould meet with from them, if we fell into their 
hands ; then the llory of Amboyna came into my head, 
and how the Dutch might, perhaps, torture us, as they 
did our countrymen there ; and make fome of our men, 
by extremity of torture, confefs thofe crimes they never 
were guilty of ; own themlelves, and all of us, to be 
pirates; and fo they would put us .to death, with a 
formal appearance of juftice ; and that they might bo 
tempted to do this, for the^ain of our (hip and cargo ; 
which was worth four or five thoufand pounds, put all 
together, 

Thefe thiijgs tormented me, and my partner too, night 
and day ; nor did we conlider that the captains of fhips 
have no authority to a6l. thus ; and if we had furrendered 
priloners to them, they could not anfwer the deftroying 
us, or torturing us, but would be accountable for it when 
they came into their own cot^ntry. This, 1 fay, gave 
me no fatisfa(5t:ion ; for, if they will aft thus with us, 
what advantage would it be to us that they would be 
called to an account for it ; or if we were firft to be mur- 
dered, what fatisfaftion would it be to us to have theni 
punifhed when they came home ? 

■' I cannot refrain taking notice here what reflexions I 
now had upon the paft variety of my >particular circura-* 
ftances ; how hard 1 thought it was, that 1, who had 
fpent forty years in a life of continued difficulties, and 
was, at lail, come, as it were, at the port or haven which,

a volunteer in new forrows, by my own unhappy choice J 
and that I, who had efcaped fo many dangers in my 
youth, {hould now come to be hanged in my old age, 
and in fo remote a place, for a crimfc I was not in the 
leall inclined to, much lefs guilty of ; and in a place and 
circumftance where innocence was not like to be any 
proteftion at all to me. 

After thefe thoughts, fomething of religion would 
come in ; and I would be coniidering that this feemed? 
to me to be a difpoiition of immediate Providence ; and 
I ought to look "Upon it, and fubmit to it, as fuch ; that 
although I was innocent as to men, I was far frorri be-^ 
ing innocent as to my maker ; ^nd I ought to look on, 
and examine what other crimes in my life were moik^ 
obvious to me, and from which Providence might juft* 
ly inflidl this puniihment as a*tetribution; and that I 
ought to lubmit to this, iuft as Pwould to a (hipwreck^ 
if it had plealed God to have brought ^uch a difafter up-^, 
on me. 

In its turn, natural courage wpuld fometimes take it* 
place ; and then I would be talking mylelf up to vi- 

forous refolution, that I would npt be taken to be 
arbaroufly ufed by a parcel of mercilefs. wretches icL 
cold blood ; that it was much better to have fallen, into 

the hands of the favages, who were .-nien-eater^ and 
who, 1 was fure, would feaft upon me, when they had 
taken me, than by thoie, who would, perhaps, glut their 

, lage upon me,^ by inhuman tortures and barbarities ;. 
that, in the cafe of the favages » I always rcfolvcd to die 
fighting, to the la(l gafp.; and why fhould I not do fo 
now, feeing it was much more dreadful, to me at leaft, 
to think of falling isto thefe meti's hands, thaaeverit 
was to think of being eaten by men ? for the favages^ 
give them their- due — would not eat a raan tillhis was 
dead , and killed him firft, as we do a bullock ; but 
that thefe men had many art« beyond the cruelty of 
death. Whenever thefe thoughts prevailed, I was fare 
to put myfelf into a kind of fever, with the agitations 
of a fuppofed fight ; my blood would boil, and my eyes 
fparkle, as if 1 was engaged ; and I always refolvcd 
ihat 1 would take no quarter at their hands : but even

ftip, and all that was in her, and leave them bnt little 
booty to boatt of. 

But how^much the g^rcater weight the anxieties and 
perplexities of thofc things were to our thoughts while 
we were at fea, by fo much the greater was our fatil- 
fadlion when we law ourfelves on ihore; and my part- 
ner told me, he dreamed, that he had a very heavy 
load upori his back, which he was to carry up an hUl, 
and found that he was not able to (land long under it : 
but the Portuguefe pilot came, and took it off his back, 
and the hill difappeared, the ground before him (hewing 
all fmooth and plain. And truly it was fo ; we were aft 
lilce men who had a load taken off their backs. 

For my part, I had a weight taken off from my 
heart that I was not able any longer to bear ; and, as 
I faid above, -we rcfolved to go no more to fea in that 
fhip. When we came on ihore, the old pilot, who was 
now our friend, got us a lodging, and a warehonfe for 
our goods, which, by the way, was much the fame : 
it was a little houfc or hut, with a large houfe joining t6 
it, all built with canes, and pallifadoed round with large 
canes, to keep out pilfering thieves, of which it feems 
there were not a few in the country\ However, the 
magiil rates allowed us all a little guard, and we had 
a IbJdier with a kind of halbert, or half-pike, who 
ftood centinel at our door, to whom we allowed a pint 
of (fice, and a little piece of money, about the value of 
threepence per day, fo that our goods were kept very 
fafe. 

The fair or mart, ufually kept in this place, had been 
over fome time ; however, we found that there were 
three or four junks in the river, and two japanners, I 
mean, ihips from Japan, with goods which they had 
bought in China, and were not gone away, having Ja-» 
panefe merchants on fhore. 

The firft thing our old Portuguefe pilot did for us, 
was to bring us acquainted with three miffionary Roniifh 
priefts, who were in the town, and who had been there 
ibme time converting the people to chriftianity ; but 
we thought they made but poor'work of it ; and made 
them but forry Chriftians when they had done. However, 
Ihat was not our bufiQ^fs, One of thefe was a f rengh**

man, whom they called Father Simon ; he was a jolly 
well-conditioned man, very free in his convcrfatioi^ 
not Teaming fo ferious and grave as the other two did^ 
one of whom was a Portuguefe, and the other a Geno- 
efe ; but Father Simon was courteous, eafy in his man- 
ner, and very agreeable company ; the other two were 
more, referved, feemed rigid and auftcre, and applied 
lerioufly to the work they came about, viz. to talk with 
and in(inuate themfelves among the inhabitants, where- 
ever they had opportunity. We often eat and drank 
with thole men ; and though I mud confefs, the conver- 
fion, as they call it, of the Chinefe to chriftianity, is fo 
far from the true converiion required, to bring heathen 
people to the faith of Chrift, that it feems to amount to 
little more than letting them know the name of Chriflr, 
lay fome prayers to tde Virgin Mary and her fon, in a 
tongue which they underlland not, and to crofs them- 
felves, and the like ; yet it mull be confeffed, that thefe 
religious, whom we call Miffionaries, have a firm belief 
that thefe people Ihould be laved, and that they are the 
inftrument of it ; and, on this account, they undergo 
not only the fatigue of the voyage, and hazards of 
living in I'uch places, but oftent'rmes death itfelf, with 
the moll violent tortures, for the fake of this work ; 
and it would be a great want of charity in us, whatever 
opinion we have of the work itfelf, and the manner of 
their doing it, if we ihould not have a good opinion of 
their zeal, who undertake it with fp many hazards, and 
who have no prolpe^ of the leall temporal advantage t© 
themfelves. 

But to return to my llory : This French prieft, Father 
Simon, was appointed, it leems,. by order of the chief 
of the million, to go up to Pekin, the royal feat of the ^ 
Chinefe Emperor, and waited only for another prieft, 
who was ordered to come to him from Macao, to go 
along with him; and we fcarce ever met together, but 
he was inviting me to go that journey with him, telling 
me, how he would fhew me all the glorious things of 
that mighty empire ; and, among the rell, the greatell city 
in the world— a city, laid he, that your London and 
our Paris put together cannot be e(!)ual to. This was 
the city of Pckix^, which, I coafefs, i$ very great, and

infinitely full of people: but, as 1 looked on thoftj 
things with different eyes from other men, fo 1 fhall 
give my opinion of them in a few words, when I come, 
in the courfe of my travels, to fpeafc more particularly of 
them. 

But firft, i come to my friar or miflionary : Dining 
with him one day, and being very merry together, I 
Ihewed fome little inclination to go with him ; and he 
prefTed me and my partner ve<ry hard, and with a great 
many perfualions to confent. Why, Father Simon, fays 
my partner, why fhould you defire our company fo 
much ? You know we are heretics, and you do not 
love us, nor can keep us company with any pleafure, 
O ! fays he, you may, perhaps, be good catholics in 
time ; my bufinefs here is to convert heathens, and who 
knows but Imay convert you too ? Very well. Father, 
faid I, fo you will preach to us all the way. I won't be 
troublefome to you, faid he ; our religion does not diveft 
us of good manners ; belides, faid he, we are here like 
countrymen, and fo we are, compared to the place we 
are in ; and if you are hugunots, and 1 a Catholic, we 
may be all Chriftians ; at leaft, faid he, we are all gen- 
tlemen, and we may converfe fo without being uneafy 
to one another. 1 liked that part of his difcourle very 
well, and it began to put me in mind of my prieft 
that 1 had left in the Rralils ; but this Father Simon 
did not come up to hischaradler by a great deal ; for 
though Father Simon had no appearance of a criminal 
levity in him neither, yet he had not that fund of Chrif- 
tian zeal, ilridi piety, and iincere afFedl:ion to religion, 
that my other good ecclefiallic had, of whom 1 have faid . 
fo much, 

Byt to leave him a little, though he never left us, nor 
folici ting 419 to go with him, but 'we had fomething 
elfe before us at that time ; for we had, all this while, 
our fhip and our merchandize to difpofe of; and we 
began to be very Moubtful what we ihould do, for we 
were now in a place of very little bufinefs; and once I 
wa» about to venture to fail for the river of Kilam ; and 
y the city of Nanquin :. But Providence feemed ndw more 
vifibly, as 1 thought, than ever, to coipcern itfelf in our 
adTstirs ; aad X was encouraged from this very time to

think, I ftioulcl, one way or other, get out of this cntati* 
gled xircumftahce, and be brought home to my own 
country Sit^ain, though I had iiot the lead view of th6 
manner; and when I begah fometimes to think bf it, 
could not imagine by what method it Was to be done. 
Providence, I fay, begati here to dear up our way a 
little ; and the iirft thing that offered was, that pur old 
Portuguefe pilot brought a Japan merchant to us, who 
fcegan to enquire what goods we h^d j ' and, in the firft 
place, he bought all oUr opium, arid gave uS a v^ry gpod 
price for it, paying us in gold by weight, fome in 
imall pieces of their own poin, and fome in Tmall wedges> 
of about ten or eleven "outlces each. While we wer6 
dealing with him for our opium ^ it came ihto my head^ 
that he might, perhaps, deal with us for the fiiip too ; 
and I ordered the ihtetpreter to propofe it to him. He 
Ihrunk up his (boulders at it, when at iirft pfopofed 
to him ; but in a few days after, he came to itte, with 
one of the miflionary priefts for hiis interpreter,, and 
told me, he had a propofal to make to the^ aiid that was 
this : He had bought a great quantity of goods of us 
•when he had no thoughts (or propofals made to him) 
of buyihg the {hip I and that therefore^ he had not 
money enough to pay for the ihip ; but if I would let 
the fame men who were in the ihip navigate her, he would 
hire the (hip to go to Japan ; and would fend them 
from thence to the Phillippine iilands with Mother 
loading, which he ivould pay the freight of, before 
they went from Japan ; iand that, at their rctuflb^ he 
'wrould btty the ihip. I began to liften to this propofal^ 
ftiKl fo eager did my head run upon rambling, that I 
tcould not 'but begin to entertain a notion myfelf ot 
going with him, and fo to fail from the Phillippine iflands 
^way to the South Seas ; and accordingly I aiked the 
Japaneib merchant, Jf he would not hire us to the 
Phillippine iilands, and difcharge us there» He fAid, nd| 
he could not do that ; for then he could not have the 
return of his cargo ; but he would difcharge Us in Japan^ 
icfaid, at the ihip's I'eturn, Well, ilil. I was for taking 
him at that propofal, and going myfelf; but my partner^ 
^;^rifer than myfelf, perfuaded me from it, reprefenting 
the dangers^ as well of the feas^ as of the Japanefe^ who 

are 



*TC a falfe,crueU^d treacherous people; and then of 
^he Spaniards at the Phlllippines ; mOre falfe, more 
cruel, more treacherous thatt they. 
" But to bring this long turn of otir afFalrs to a conclu- 
fiori : the firft thing we had to do, was to confult ' 
with the captain of the (hip, abd with the men, and 
know if they were willing to go to Japan ; and, while 
I was doing this, the young man whom^ as I faid, my 
liephew had left with me as my companion for my 
travels, came to rat and told'me^ that he thought that 
voyage promifed very fair, and that there waS a great 
profpedl of advantage^ and he would be very glad if I 
undertook it ; but that if I would pot, and would give 
him leave, he would go a^ a merchant, or how I pleafed 
to order him: that if ever he came to England, and I 
was there, and alive, he would render me a faithful ac* 
count of his fuccefs^ aild it fhould be as much mine as I 
pleafed. 

J >^as really loth to part with hiiti ; but, confidering 
the profpedt of advantage^ which \yas really confiderable^ 
and that he was a young fellow as likely to do well in 
it as any 1 ktew, 1 inclined to let him go | but firft I 
told him 1 would confult my partner, and give him an 
anfwer thene^Lt day. My partner and I difcourfed about 
it ; and my partner made a moft generous offer s 
he told me J you know it has been an unlucky fhip, and 
we both refolve not to go to fea in it again ; if your 
lie ward (fo he called my riaan) will venture the voyage^ 
I'll leave my (hare of the veUel to him^ and let hint 
make the belt of it ; and if we live to meet in England^' 
and he meets with fuccefs abroad, he (hall account fot 
one half of the profits of the (hip's freight to us^ thd 
other (hall be his pwn. / 

If my partner, who was no way concerned with mf 
young man, made him fuch an offer, 1 could do no 
lefs than o^er him the fame; and all the (hip's^com^ 
pai)y being, willing to go with himj wc made oyer half 
the (hip to him in property j and took a iVriting from 
him, obliging him to account fdr the other ; and away 
he went to Japan, The Japan merchant proved a very^ 
pun<^ual honed man to him, protedied him at Japan^ 
and got hini a liceafe to come on (hore^ whidi the

Europeans in general have not lately obtained ; paid bim 
his freight very pundtually, fent him to the Phillippines, 
loaded with Japan and China wares, and a fupercargo 
of their own, who, trafficking with the Spaniards*, 
brought back European goods again, and a grea,t quan* 
tity pf cloves and other fpice ; and there he was not only 
paid his freicrht very well, and at a very good price, but 
bHng not willing to fell the fhip then, the merchant fur- 
liiihed him with goods on his own account : that, for 
fome money, and fome fpices of his own, which he 
brought with him, he went back to the Manillas, to the 
Spaniards, where he fold his cargo very well. Here, 
having gotten a good acquaintance at Manilla, he got 
\his Chip made a free fhip ; and the governor of Manilla 
hired him to go to Acapulco in America, on the coail of 
Mexico ; and gave him a licence to land there, and 
travel to Mexico ; and to pafs in any Spanifh fliip to 
Europe, with all his men. 

He made the voyage to Acapulco very happily, and 
there he fold his (hip ; and having there alfo obtained 
allowance to travel by land to Porto Bello, he found 
means, fomehow or other, td go to Jamaica with all his 
treafure ; and about ^eight years after came to England, 
exceeding rich ; of which 1 Ihall take notice in its 
place: in the mean time I return to our particular 
affairs. 

Being now to part with the (hip, and fhip's compan;^, 
it came before us, of courfe, to coniider what recom- 
pence we fliould give to the two men that gave us 
fuch timely notice of the defign againft Us in the river 
of Cambodia.' The tru^h was, they had done us a con- 
fiderable Service, and deferved well at our hands; 
though, by the way, they were a couple of rogues 
too-, for, as they believed the ilory of our being 
pirates, and that we had really run away with the 
fhip,: they came down to us, not only to betray the 
defign thutwas formed againft us, but to go to fea with' 
lis as pirates ; and one of them confeffed afterwards, 
that nothing elfe but the hopes of goino- a 
Toguing, brought him to do it. However, the fer- 
vice they did us was not the lefs ; and therefore, as I 
lad pronaifed to be grateful to them, 1 firft oidered the 

money

Tftottey to be paid to thefn, which they faJd was due to 
them on board their refj>eClive (hips ; that is to fay, the 
Engliihmen nineteen months' pay, and to the Dutch- 
men fe-^en ; and, over and above that, I gave each of 
them a fmall fum of money in gold, which contented 
them very well ; then I made the EnglKhman gun- 
ner of the (hip, the gunner being row being made fecond 
mate and purler; the Dutchman F made boatiwain ; 
fo they were both very well pleafed, and proved very 
ferviceable, feeing 4)oth able feameu, and very ftout 
fellows. 

We were now on ihore in China. If I thought myftif 
banifhed, and remote from my own country ajt Bengal, 
where I had many ways to get home for my money, 
what could "I think of myfelf now, when I was gotten 
about a tboufand leasrues farther off from home, 
and peifedily dellitute of all manner of profped: of 
return ! . '^ 

All we had for it was this ; that in about four months* 
time there was to be another fair at that place where 
we were, and then we might be able to purchafe all 
forts of the manufa<5lures of the country, and withal 
might poflihly.find fbrae Chinefe junks or veflels from 
Nanquin, that would be to be ibid, aftd would carry 
i]s and our goods whither we pleafed. This 1 liked very 
well, and refolved to wait: befides, ffs our particular: 
perfons were not obnoxious, fo if any Etiglifh or Dutch 
(hips came thither, perhaps we might have an oppor- 
tunity to load our goods, and get pafiage to fome 
other place in India, nearer home. 

Upon thefe hopes we telblved to continue here : 
but, to divert ourfelves, we took two or three journies 
into the country firft. We' went ten days' journey 
to fee the city of Nianquin^ a city well worth fee- 
ing indeed; they fay it has a million of people in 
it ; which, howei^er, I do not believe ; it is regularly 
built ; the ftreets are all exactly ftrait, and Crofs one an- 
other in (Jiredt lines, which gives the figure, of it great 
advantaore. 

But when I came^ to compare the miferable people of

It is very ohljervabk, that wc wonder at the gran- 
deur, the riches, the pomp, the ceremonies, the go- 
vernment, the manufactures, the commerce, andthecon- 
dudi: of thefe people, not that they are to be wondered 
at, or indeed, in the leiift to be regarded, but becaufe, 
having firft a notion of the barbarity of thofe coun- 
tries, the rudenefs, and the ignorance that prevail 
there. We do not «xpe(5l to find any fuch things fo far 
ofF. 

Other wife, /what are their buildings to the palaces 
and royal buildings of Europe? What their trade to 
the univerfal commerce of England, Holland, France, 
and Spain ? What their cities to ours, for wealth, 
ilrength, gaiety of apparel, rich furniture, and an in- 
finite variety ? What are their ports,, fupplied with a 
few junks and barks, to our navigation, our mer- 
chants' fleets, our large and powerful navies? Our 
city of London has more trade than all thdr mighty 
■empire. One Englilh, or Dutch, or French man of 
war of 80 guns, 'would fight with and deftroy all 
the ihipping of Chfna. But the greatnefs of their 
wealth, their trade, the power of their government,

as 1 have faid, conlidering them as a barbarous nation of 
3>agans, Jittle better than favages, we did not expedl 
fuch things among them; and this, indeed, is the ad- 
vantage with which all their greatnefs and power is re- 
prefented to us ; otberwife it is in itfeif nothing at all ; 
for, as I have faid of their (hips, fo it may be faid of 
their armies aiid troops ; all the forces of their empire, 
though they were to bring tWo millions of men into 
the field together, would be able to do nothing but ruin 
the country and . fiarve themfelves. If they were to

German or Engliih foot, and 10.000 French horfe, 
would fairly beat . all the forces of China. And fo of 
our fortified towns, and the art of our engineer?, in 
aflaulting and defending towns ; there is not a fortilied 
town in China could hold out one month againft the 
batteries and attacks of an European arniy ; an I at 
the* fame time, all the armies of China could never 
take fuch a town as Dunkirk, provided it was not 
llarved : no, not in ten years* liege. They have fiie- 
arms, it is true, but they are aukvVard, clumfy, and 
uncertain in goirtg off; they have powder, but it is of 
no ftrength ; they have neither difcipline in th^' field, 
excrcife in their arms, (kill to attack, or temper to re- 
treat ; and "therefore I mull confefs it feemed flrange to 
me when I came home, and heard our people fay fuck 
iine things of the 'power, riches, Sjlory, magninctjnce, 
and trade of the Chinefe, becaule I faw and knew; hat 
they were a contemptible herd or crowd of ignorant 
fordid flaves, fubjedled to a government qualihed only

how {hort-fifirbted are the wifeft of their ftudcnts? 
they know nothing of the motion of the heavenly bo- 
-dies, and fo grofsly, abfurdly ignorant, that when the 
fun is eclipfed, they think it is a great dragon has af- 
fauhed and run away with it, and they fall a clattering 
with all the drwns and kettles in the country, to fright 
the monfter away, juft as we do to hive a fwarm of 
l)ees. ' 

As this is the only cxcurfion of this kin4 which I 
liave made, in all the account which I have given of ray 
travels, fo I ihall make no more deicriptions of coun- 
tries and people : it is none of my bufinefs, or any part 
of my deiign ; but giving an account of ray own ad- 
ventures, through a life of infinite wanderings, and 
A long variety of changes-, which, perhaps, few hate 
lieard the like of^: I fliall fay nothing of the mighty- 
places, defert cotmtries, and numerous people, I have 
yet to ])afs through, more than relates to my own 
ilory, and which my concern among them will make 
neceffary- I was now, as near as I can compute, -ia 
the heart of China, about the latitude of thirty de- 
grees north of the line, for we were returned from 
Nanquin : I had indeed a mind to fee the city of Pekin, 
•which I had heard fo much of, and Father Simon impor- 
tuned me daily to do it. At length bis time of going 
away being let, and the other miffionary, .who was to 
go with him, being arrived from Macoa, it was neceffary 
that we {hould refolve either to go or not to go ; 
fo I referred hira to ray partner, and left it wholly to 
liis choice, v^ho, at length, refolved it in the affirma- 
tive ; and we prejiared for our journey. We fet out 
"with very good advantage, as to finding the way ; for 
"we got leave to travel in the retinue of one .of their 
mandarins, a kind of v;ceroy, or principal magiftrate 
in the province where they reiide, and who cake great 
i^ate upon them, travelling with great attendance, and 
with great homage from the people, who are fome- 
times greatly impoverifhed by them, becaufe all |he 
countries they pafs ' through are obliged to fumifli 
provifions for them and all their attendants. That 
which I particularly obfervcd, as to our travelling

with his baggage, was this; that though we received 
fufliciexit provilions, both for ourfelves and our horfes, 
from the country, as belonging to the mandarin ,> yet 
we were obliged to pay for every thing we had atter 
the market price of the country, and the mandarin's 
fleward, or commiffary of the prov4i;ons, colledled it 
duly from us, fo that our travelling in the retinue of 
the mandarin, though it was' a very great kindnefs to 
us, was not fueh a eighty favour in hinv, but wasy 
indeed, a great advantage to h>m,con{idering. there 
were about thirty other people travelling in the fame 
ihanner befides u?,. under the protedlion of his retinue,^ 
or, as we may call it, under his convoy. This, i fay, 
was a great advantage to him, for his country furnifhed 
Itll the provifions for nothing, and he took all our money 
for them. . • 

We were five and twenty days travelling to Pekin^ 
through a country infinitely pupulous, but miferabljr 
cultivated ; the hufbandry, economy, and^ the way x)f 
living, all very milerable, though t!hey boail fo mu^h of 
the induftry 9f the people ; I fay, tnifejable, arid fo 
it is, if we, who underftand how to live. Were to 
endure it, or to compare it with our own, but not fo 
to thcfe poor wretches, who know no other. The pride 
of thefe people is infinitely great, and exceeded by 
nothing but their poverty, which adds to that which 
I call their mifery. 1 muft needs think that the naked 
favages of America live much more happy, becaufe, as 
they have nothing, fo they defire nothing : whereas, 
thefe are proud and infdlent, and, in the main, are mere 
beggars and drudges ; their dflentation is inexprefifible, 
and is chiefly (hewed in their clothes and buildings, and in 
the keeping multitudes of fervants or ilaves, and, which 
is to the laft degree ridiculous, their contempt of all the 
WQj^ld but themfelves. , 

1 mull confefs, J travelled more pleafantly afterwards 
in the deferts and vail wildemefiTes of Grand Tartary 
than here ; and yet, the roads here are well paved,, and 
well kept, and very convenient for travellers ; but no- 
thing was more aukward to me, than to fee fueh ah 
haughty, imperious, inlblent people, in the midft of 
the grofl^il simplicity and ignorance ; for all their famed

ingenuity is no more. ^ My friend, Father Simon, and I, 
ufed to be very merry upon thefe occafions, to fee the 
beggnrly pride of thofe people : for example, coming by 
the houfe of a country gentleman, as Father Simon called 
him, about ten leagues off from the city of Nanquin, we 
had, fird of all, the honour to ride with the matter of 
the houfe about two miles ; the ftate he rode in was a 
perfe6l Don Quixotifm^ being a rai^tture of pomp and 
poverty. 

The habit of this greafy don was very proper for a 
fcaramouch, or merry-andrew ; beiug a dirty callico, 
with all the tawdry trappings of a fool's coat, fuch as 
hanging-ileeves, taffety, and cuts and flafhes almo{{ on 
every fide ; it covered a rich taifety veft, as greafy as a 
butcher, and which teflified that his honour muft needs 
be a mod exquilite floven. 

His horfe was a poor, lean, (I'arved, hobbling crea- 
ture, fuch as in England might fell for about thirty or 
forty (hillings ; and he had two (laves followed him on 
foot, to drive the poor creature along ; he had a whip in 
his hand, and he belaboured the beall as faft about the 
head a^ his (laves did about the tail ; and thus he 
rode by us with about ten or twelve fervants, and we 
wer^ told he was going from the city to his country 
feat, about half a league before us. We travelled on 
gently, but this (igure of a gentleman rode away before 
us ; and as we (lopped at a village about an hour to re- 
fre(b us, when we came by the country feat of this great 
man, we faw him in a little place before his door,' 
eating his repaft ; it w^as a kind of a garden, but he 
was eafy to be ften, and we were given to underftand, 
that the more we looked on him, the better he would be 
pie a fed. 

He fat under a tree, fomething like the palmettotree, 
which effedlu ally (haded him over the head, and on the 
fouth (ide ; but under the tree alfo was placed a large 
umbrella, which made that part look well enough; 
he fat loUng back in a great elbow chair, be- 
ing a heavy corpulent man, and his meat being 
brought him by two women (laves, he had two more 
jwhofe office, I think, few gentlemen in Europe would 
accept of their (ervice in, via. one fed the 'fquire with a 

fpoon.

s 

fpoon, and the other held the difh with one hnnd, and 
fcraped oif what he let fall upon his worlhip's b?ard, 
and taffety veCt, with the other ; while the great fat brute 
thought it below him to employ his own hands in any 
of thofe familiar .offices which kings and monarchs 
would rather do than be troubled with the clumly fingeVs 
of their fervants. 

I took this time to think what pain men's pride puts 
them to, and how troublelbme a haughty temper, thusill- 
managed, muft be to a man of common fenfe ; and, 
leaving the poor wretch to pleafe himfelf with our look- 
ing at hi^n, as if we admired his pomp, whereas we 
really^ pitied and coKtemned him, we purfued our 
journey ; only Father Simon had the curioiity to ftay to 
inform himfelf what dainties the country judice had 
to feed on, in all his itate ; which, he faid, he had the 
honour to tafte of, and which was, I thmk, a dole 
that ^n Engliih hound would fcarce have eaten, if it had 
been offered him, viz. a mefs of boiled riqe, with a great 
piece of garlic in it, and a little bag filled with green 
pepper, and another plant which they have there, fome- 
thing like our gingcj^, but fmelling like mufk, and 
tailing li\e muitard ; all this was put together, and a 
fmall lump or piece of lean mutton boiled in it ; and this 
was his worfhip's repaft, four or live fervants more atr 
tending at a diftance. If he fed them meaner than he 
was fed himfelf, the fpice excepted, they mult fare very 
coarfely indeed. 

As for our mandarin, with whom we travelled, he 
■was refpedted like a king ; furrounded always with his 
gentlemen, and attended in all hjs appearances with fuch 
pomp, that 1 faw little of him but at a diftance ; but this 
I obferved, that^there was not a horfe in his retinue, but < 
that our carrier's pack-hori'es in England feem to me 
to look much better; but they were fo covered with 
equipage, mantles, trappings, and fuch like trumpery, 
that you cannot fee whether they are fat or lean. In a 
word, we could fcarce fee any thing but their fe^t and 
their heads. 

I was now light hearted, and all my trouble and 
perplexity that I had given an account of being over, 
1 had no anxious thoughts about me ; which made this

journey much the pleafanter to me ; nor had I any H^ 
accident attended me, only in the paffing or fording a 
fmall river, my horfe fell, and made me free of the coun-* 
try, as they call it; that, is to lay, threw me in; the 
place was not deep, but it wetted me all over ; I mention 
it, becaufe it fpoiled my pocket-book, wherein I had fet 
down the names of feveral people and places which 1 had 
occafion to remember, ami which not taking due care of, 
the leaves rotted, and the words were never afttr to be 
read, to my great lofs, as to the names of fome places 
which I touched at in this voyage. 

At length we arrived at Pekin ; I had nobody with 
me but the youth, whom my nephew the captain had 
given me to attend me as a fervant, and who proved 
very trufty and diligent; and my partner had nobody 
with him but one fervant, who was a kinfman. As for 
the Portuguefe Pilot, he being defirous to fee the courts 
we gave him his palTage, that is to fay, bore his charges 
for ^is company ; ancfto uie him as an interpreter, for 
he underftood the language of the country, and fpoke 
good French^ and a little Englifh ; and, indeed, this old, 
man was a moft ufeful implement to us cvrty where; 
for we had not been above a week at Pekin, when he 
came laughing. Ah, iSi ignior Inglefe, faid he, 1 have 
fomethin^ to tell you will make your heart glad. My 
heart glad ! faid 1 ; iwhat can that be ? 1 do'nt know 
any thing in this country can cither give me joy or 
grief, to any great degree. Yes, yes, faid the old. man, 
in broken Englifh, make you glad, me forrow ; forry, he 
would have faid. This made me more inquilitive. 
Why, faid, 1 will it make you forry ? Becaufe, faid he,, 
you have brought mchere twenty-five days journey, and 
will leave me to go back alone ; and which way fhall I 

fct to my port afterwards, without a fhip, without a 
orfe, without pecune ? So he* called money ; being: 
llis broken Latin> of which had abundance to make us 
merry with. 

in Ihort, he told us there was a great caravan of 
Mufcovy and Poliih merchants in the city, and they 
were preparing to let out on their journey, by land, ta 
Mufcovy, within four or five weeks, and he was lure- 
•wci: would take the opportunity to go with', them, and

leave him behind to go back all alone. 1 eonfefs, n 
was furprifed with this news : a fecret joy ipread itfel 
over my whole foul, which I cannot defcribe, and never 
felt before or fince ; and I had no power, for a goodi 
while, to (peak a word to the oki man : but at laft ?[ 
turned to him : How do you know this ? i'aid 1 : are 
you fure it is true ? Yes, faid be ; I met this ftiorning, in 
the ftreet,' an old acquaintance of mine, an Arrtieniati, 
or one you call a Grecian, who ig among them ; he came ' 
kft from Altracan, and was diefigning to go to Tonquin, 
where 1 formerly knew him, ,but has altered his mand, 
and is now refolved to go back with the caravaa to 
Mofcow- and fo down the river of Wolsra to Altracan. 
Well, Seignior, faid I, do not be uneaiy about being; 
left to go back alone: if this be a method for my re- 
turn to England, it (hall be- your fault if you go back to 
Macao at all. We then went to conftihing together 
what was to be done, and afked my partner what he 
thought of the pilot's new»^ and whether it wbuld fuit 
with his affairs ? He told me he would do juft as I would, 
fot he had fettled all his affairs fo well at Bengral and 
left his effedls in fuch good hands, that as w« made a 
good voyage here," if he could veil it in China filks, 
wrought or raw, fuch a& might be worth the carriage, 
he would be content to 'go to England, iand then make 
his voyage back to Bengal by the Company's (hips. 

Having refolved upon this, we agreed, 'that if our 
Portugucle pilot woulfd go with Us, we would bear hi» 
charges to Mofcow, or to England^, if he pjeafed ; nor, 
indeed, were we fro be efteemed over gcinefous^ in that 
part neither,, if we had not rewarded him further ; for 
the fervice he had done us was really worth -all that 
and more : for he had» ilot only been a pilot to us at 
fea, but he had been^ alfo^ Kke a broker for us cm 
fhore : and his procuring tor us the .*rpan merchant was 
foihe hundred of pounds in our pockets. So we con- 
fulred together about it : and, being willilig to gratify ' 
him, \)vhich was, indeed, but doing him juitice, andvetyr

Having fettled this among ourfelves, we called , him, 
to let him know what we had refolved ; I told him, he 
Jiad complained of our being like to let him go back 
alone, and 1 was now to tell him we were refolved he 

, Ihould not go back at all : that as we had refolvejl to 
go to Europe with the caravan, we refolved alfo b^ 
Ihould go with us, and that we called him to know his 
mind. He {hook his head, and faid it was a long; 
jotirney, and he had no pecune to carry him thither, 
nor to fubfift himfelf when he came thither. We told 
him, we believed it was fa, and therefore we had re- 
folved to do foraething for him, that fhould let him fee 
how fcnfible we were of the fervice he had done us ; 
and alfo how agreeable he was to us ; and then I 
told him what we had'refolved to give him here, which 
he might lay out as we would do our own ; and that as 
for his charges, if he would go ' with us, we would 

^ fet him fafe afhore, (life and cafualties excepted J 
either in MijfcOvy, or in England, which he would, 
at our own charge, except only the carriage of his 
goods. 

- He xecejved the propofal like a man tranfported, and 
told us, he would go with Us over the. whole world;

the other merchants, they had many things to do; 
and inllead of being ready in five weeks, it was four 

' months and ibme odd days- before all things were got

a very large quantity of raw ,filk, and fbme otiier 
goods : our cargo am(Hinting in thefc goods onJy, 
to about, three thoufand five hundred pounds (ler- 
ling, which, together with tea, and fome fine cal- 
licoes, and three camel loads of nutmegs and cloves, 
loaded in all eighteen camels for our (hare, belides 
thofe we rode upon ; which, with two or three fparc 
horfes, and two horfes loaded with provifions, made 
us, in ihort, twenty-fix camels and horfes in our 
retinue. 

The company was very great, and, as near as I can, 
,Temember, made between three and four hundred horfes 
and camels, and upward of an hundred and twenty men, 
very well armed, and provided for all events. Por, as 
the caftern caravans are fubjedt to be attacked by t he 
Arabs, fo are thefe by the Tartars: but they are not al- 
together fo dangerous as the Arabs, nor fo barbarous 
when they prevail. 

The company coniifted of people of feveral nations, 
fuch as Mufcovites chiefly ; for there were about iixty of 
them who Were merchants or inhabitants of Mofcow, 
though of them fome were Livonians, and to our parti-* 
cular fatisfadion ^vg of them were Scots, who appeared 
alfo to be men of great experience in bulinefs, and very 
good lubftance. 

When we had travelled ope day's journey, the 
guides, who were five in number, called all the gentle- 
men and merchants ; that is to fay, all the pafTengers, 
except the fervants, to a great council, as they termed 
jt. At this great council, every one depoiited a certain 
quantity of money to a common flock, for the necefTarv 
expence of buying forage on the way, where it was not 
otherwiie to be had. ami for fatisfying the guides, gcttino* 
horfes, and the like. And here they conftituted the 
journey, as they call it, viz. They named captains and 
officers to draw us all up, and give the command in cafe 
of an attack, and gave every one their turn of command. 
Nor was this forming us into order any more than what 
Ve found needful upon the way, as fhall be obferved in 
its place.

which was not to be feen in all the world befide. I was*

Tbis was a China warehoufc indeed, truly and lite-

As this is one of the fingularlties of China, fo they

incredible things of their performance in crockery-

great work it is, going over hills and mountains in en 
cndlefs track, where the rocks are impalTable, and the 
precipices fuch as nO enemy could poffibly enter, or, 
indeed, climb up, or where, if they did, no wall could

fand Englijfh miles, but that the country is five hun- 
dred in a ftraight meafured line, which the wall bounds, 
without meafuring the windings and turnings it takes; 
'tis about four fathom high, and as many thick in fome

it on e\rry fide, near, and far off, I mean, what was 
within my view ; and the guide of our caravan, who 
had been extolling it for the wonder of the world, 
was mighty eager to hear my opinion of it. I told 
him it was a mofl excellent thing to keep off the Tar- 
tars, which he happened not to underftand r^s I meant 
it, and i'o took it for a compliment ; but the old pilot 
laughed ; C) Seignior Inglefe, faid he, you fpeak in co-

Why you fpeak what looks white this way, and bla^ck 
that way ; gay one way, and dull another way ; jrou 
tell him it is a good wall to keep out Tartars ; you tell 
me by that, it is good for nothing but to keep out 
Tartars ; or it will keep out none but Tartars : I un-

no more of his fiirc flory of the Chinefe power and great 
nefs while he (laid. 

After we had pafled this mighty nothing, called a wall, 
fomethincr like the Pifts' wall, fo famOu^ in Northumber- 
land, and built by the Romans, we began to find the 
country thinly inhabited, and the people rather confined 
to live in fortified towns and cities, as being fubjeft to 
the inroads atad depredations of the Tartars, who rob in 
great armies, and therefore are not to be refilled by the 
naked inhabitants of an open country. 

And here I began to find the neceflity of keeping to- 
gether in, a caravan, as we travelled ; for we faw feveral 
troops of Tartars roving about ; but when I came to 
fee them diftinAly, I wondered how that the Chinefe 
empire could be conquered by fuch contemptible fellows ; 
for they are a mere herd or croud of wild fellows^ keep- 
ing no order, and underilanding no difcipline, or- manner 
of fight. ^ 

Their horfes are poor, lean, llarved creatures, taught 
nothing, and are fit for nothing ; and this we found 
the firll day we faw them, which was after we entered 
the wilder part of the country ; our leader for the day 
gave leave for about fixteen of us to go a hunting, as 
they call it : and what was* this but hunting of fheep ! 
However, it rafty be called hunting too j for the crea- 
tures are the wildeft, and fwiftefl of foot, that ever I 
faw of their kind ; only they will not tun a great way> 
and yoa are fure of fport when you begin the chace ; 
for they appear generally by thirty or forty in a flock, 
and, like true fheep, always keep together when they 
fly. 

In purfuit of this odd fort of game, it was our hap 
to meet with about forty Tartars ; whether they were 
hunting mutton as we were, or whether they looked 
for another kind of prey, I know not ; but as ibon as 
they faw us, one of them blew a kind of hoi-n very loud, 
but with a barbarous found that I had never heard before ; 
and, by the way, never care to hear again. We all fup- 
pofed this was to call their friends about them ; and fo

forty or fifty more appeared at about a mile didiixK^ 
but our work was over iirll, as it happened. 

One of the Scots merchants of Mufcow happened to 
be amongft us : and as foon ^s he heard the horn, he 
told us, in fhort, that we had iwthing to kIo, but to 
charge them immediately, without lofs of time ; and, 
drawing us up in a line, he afked, if we were refolved ; 
we told him, "We were ready to follow him : £o he rode 
direftly up t4 them. They ftood-gazing. at u& like » 
mere crowd, drawn up in no order, nor ihewing^ the face 
of any order at all; but as foon as they faw us advance^ 
they let fly their arrows: which, however, mifled ui 
very happily ; it feems they miftook not their aim, but 
their diftance : for their arrows all fell a' little fhort of us, 
but with fo trij^ an aim, that had we been about 20 
yards nearer, we muft^ have had feveral men wounded, if 
jiot killed. 

Immediately we halted : and though it was at a greal 
iliftance, we fired, and fent them leaden bullets foP 
wooden arrows, following our fliot full gaUop, rerolvin<» 
to fall in among them fword iii band : for fo our bold 
Scot that led us diredcd. He was, indeed,- but a 
merchant, but he behaved with that vigour and bravery 
on this occa{i<Hi, and yet with fuch a cool courage 
too, that I never faw any man in adbion fitter tor 
eommand* 

As fopn as we canwi.up to them, we fired our piflol^ 
in their faces, and then drew ; but they fied in the 
greateft confuiion imaginable : the only iland any of. 
them made was on our light, where thYee of them' 
Hood, and,, by figns, called the reft to come back ti^ 
them ; having a kind of fcymitar in their- hands, aiid theirr

with his piftol, an^ the third ran away r and thud-

that the other party was fo frighted with the noife of our 
guns, that they fied, and never made any attempt upon 
us» 

We were all tliis while in the Chinefe dominions, and 
therefore the Tartars were not fo bold as afterwards : but 
in about five days we entered a vaiV great wild defert, 
which held us three days and nights mafch ; and we 
"were obliged to carry our water with us in great leather 
bottles, and to encamp all night, juttas I have heird thejr 
do in the deferts of Arabia.' 

I aflced our guides, whofe dominion, this was in ? 
;and they told me, this was a kind of border that 
might be called, No Man's Land ; being part of the 
Great Karakathy, 6r Grand Tartary ; but, that how- 
ever^ it was reckoned to China ; that there was no care 
taken here to preferve it from the inroads of thieves ; 
and therefore it was reckoned the word defert in the 
whole march, though we were gone over fome muc^ 
krcrer/ 

In paffing this wiWcmefs, which I confefs, was at the 
firft view very frightful to me,, we faw two or three tlmo- 
little parties of the Tartars, but they fcemed to be upon 
their own affairs, and to have no defign upon us ; and. 
fo, like the man who met the devil, if they had nothing 
to fay to us, we had nothing to fay to them'; we let 
them go^ 

Once, however, a party of them came fb near a^ to 
ftand and gaze at us ;. whether it was to confider what 
they fhould do, viz. to attack us,, or not attack us, we 
knew not ; but when we were pafTed at fome diftance 
by them, we made a rear-guaid of forty men^ and 
itood ready for them, letting the caravan pais half 
a mile, or thereabouts, before us ; after a while -they 
marched off, only we found they alTaulted us with five 
arrows at their parting ; one of which wounded a horfc, 
fo that it difablcd him ; and we left him the next day,, 
poor creature, in great need of a good farrier ; we fup* 
pofe they might ihoot more arrows,, which might fall; 
fhort of us ; but we faw no more arrows or Tartars at 
that time. 

We travelled near a ntonth after this, the ways beingr

the Emperor of C^ina^ but lay, for the mod part, m 
villages, fortie of which were fortified, becaufe of the 
incuriions of the Tartars. When we^came to one of 
thefe towns (it was about two days and an half's jour- 
ney before we were come to the City of Naum^, 
I wanted to buy a camel, of which there are plenty 
to be fold all the way upon that road, ami of horfes 
alfo, fuch as they are, becaufe fo many caravans coip^ 
ing that way, they are very often wanted. The perfon 
that I fpoke to, to get me a camel, would have gone 
and fetched it for me, but J, like a fool, muft be offi- 
cious, and go myfelf along with him. The place was 
about two miles out of the village, where it feems, 
they kept the camels and horfes feeding under a 
guard. 

I walked it on foot, with my old pilot in company, 
and a Chinefe, being defirous^ forfooth, of a little vari- 
.ety. When we came to this place, it was a low marihy 
ground, walled round with a ftone wall, piled up dry, 
without mortar or earth among it; like a park with 
a little guard of Chinefe foldiers at the doors. Having 
bought a camel, and agreed for the price, 1 came 
away ; and the Chinefe man, that went with the, led 
the camel, when on a fuddencame up five I'arta^ 
on horfebaclc ; two of them feized the fellow,, and took 
the camel from ' him, while the other three fteppcd 
up to me, and my old pilot; feeing U5, as it were, 
unarmed, for 1 had no weapon about me but my fword, 
which could but ill defend me againft three horfe- 
men. The firft that came up, flopped fhort upon my 
drawing my fword (for they are arrant cowards) : but 
a fecond coming upon my left, gave me a blow on the 
head, which 1 never felt till afterwards, and won- 
dered, when 1 came to myfelf, what was the mat- 
ter with me, and where 1 was, for he laid me flat on 
the ground; but ray never-failing old pilot, the Portu- 
guefe (fo Providence uiilooked for diredls deliverances 
from dangers, which to us are unforefeen j , had a pillol 
in his pocket, which 1 knew nothing of, nor the Tartars 
neither; if they had,. I fuppofe they would not have 
attacked us ; but cowards are always boldeil when there 
is no danger.

The old man, feeing me down,- with a bold heart ftep- 
ped up to the fellow that had ftruck me, and laying hold 
of his arm with one han'd, and pulling him down by main 
force a little towards him with the other, he (hot him in- 
to the head, and laid hirti dead on the fpot ; he then im- 
mediately fiepped up to him who had Hopped us, as I 
feid, and before he could oome forward again) for it was 
all done as it were in a moment) made a blow at him 
with a Icymitar, which he always wore ; but, miffing 
the man, cut his horfe into thelide of his head, cut one 
of his ears off by the root, and a great flice down the 
fide of his face. I'he poor beafl, enraged with the wounds, 
was no more to be governed by his rider, though the fel- 
low fat well enough too ; but away he flew, and carried 
him quite out of the pilot's reach, and at fomedillance 
rifing upon his hind legs, threw down the Tartar, a«d 
fell upon him. 

Jn this interval the poor Chinefe cttme in, who had 
loft the camel, but he had no weapon ; however, feeing 
the Tartar down, and his horfe fallen upon him, he runs 
to hhn, andfeizing upon an ugly ill-favoured weapon he 
had by his fide, fomething like a poUrax, but not a pole- 
ax neither, he wrenched it from him, and made fhift to 
Jcnock his Tartarian brains out with it. But my old 
man had the third Tartar to deal with dill ; and, feeing 
he did not fly as he expedied, nor come on to fight, him, 
as he apprehended, but flood ftock-ftill, the old man 
Hood ftill too and falls to work with his tackle to charge 
his pillol again ; but as foon as the Tartar faw the 
piftol, whether he fuppofed it to be the fame or 
another, I know not ; but away he fcoured, and left 
niy pilot, my champion I called him afterwards, a com- 
plete vidtory. 

By this time I was a little awake ; for T thought, 
when I firft began to av^ake, that 1 had been in a fweet 
ileep ; but as I faid above, I wondered where 1 was, 
how I came upon the ground, and what was the^ mat- 
ter ; in a word, a few minutes after, as fenfe returned, 
I felt pain, though I did not know where ; I clapped 
my hand to my head, and took it away bloody ; then 
1 felt my head ache ; and thenji in another moment, me-

again. 

Ijumped up upon my feet inilantly, and got hold of 
my fword, but no enemies in view, 1 found a Tartar 
lie dead, and his horfe Handing very quietly by him ;. 
and, looking farther, I faw my champion and deliverer^ 
who had been to fee what the Chincfe had done, coming 
back with his hanger in his hand ; the old man, fee- 
ding me on my feet,, came running to me, and embraced- 
me with a great deal of joy, being afraid before that 
1 had been killed ; and feeing me bloody, would fee 
how I was hurt ; but it was not much, only what we 
eall a broken head ; neither did I afterwards find any 
great inconvenience from the blow other than the place 
which was hurt, and which was well again in two or 
three days. 

We made no great gain, however, by this victory ; 
for we loil a. canxaf, and gained a horfe ; but that which 
was isemarkable^ when we came back to the village^ 
the man demanded to be paid for the camel : 1; difputed 
it, and it was broiight to a hearing before the Chi- 
neie Judge of, the place; that is to fay, in Engliih,

-unufual body of Tartars, making ten thoufand in all, 
had appeared^in the way, about thirty miles beyond the 
city. 

This was very had news to travellers t^ however, it was 
carefully done of the governor, and we were very glad 
to hear we (hould have a guard. Accordingly two days 
after, we had 200 foldiers fent us from a garrifon of the 
Chinefe on our left, and three hundred more from the city 
of Naum, and with thofe we advanced boldly : the three 
hundred foldiers from Naum marched' in our front, the 
^yfo hundred in our rear, and our men, on each fide of 
our camels with our baggage, and the whole caravan 
in the center ; in this order, and well prepared for battle, 
we thought ourfelves a match for the whole ten thou- 
fand Mogul Tartars, if they had appeared ; but the 
next day, when they did appear, it was quite another 
thing, 

Jt was early in the morning, when marching from a 
little well-iituated town, called Changu, we had a river 
to pafs, where we w^re obliged to ferry ; and had 
the 'J'artats had any intelligence, then had been the 
time to have attacked us, when, the caravan being over, 
the rear guard was behind; but they did not appear 
there. 

About \three hours after, when we were entered upon 
a defert of about 15 or 16 miles over, behpld, by a cloud 
of duft they raifed, we faw an enemy was at hand ; and 
they were at hand indeed, for they came on upon the 
fpur. 

The Chinefe, our guard on the front, who had talked 
fo big the day before, began to ftagger, and the foldiers 
frequently looked behind them ; which is a certain lign 
in a foldier, that he is juil ready to run away. My

old pilot was of my mind ; and, being near me, ,he 
called out. Seignior Ingkfe, faid he, thofe fellows mud 
be encouraged, or they will ruin us all ; for if the Tar- 
tars come on, they will pever ftahd it. I am of your 
mind, faid I ; but what courfe mud be done? Done, 
faid he, let fifty of our men advance, and flank them on 
each wing, and encourage them, and they will fight like 
brave feRows in brave company ; but without it they 
will every man turn his back. Immediately I rode up 
to our leader, and told him, who was exadlly of our 
mind ; and accordingly fifty of us marched to the right 
wing, and fiifty to the left, and the reft made a line of 
referve ; for fo we marched, leavinor the laft two bun- 
dred men to make another body to themfelves, and to 
^uard the camels ; only that, if need were, they (hould 
lend an hundred men to affift the laft fifty. 

In a word, the Tartars came on, and an innumerable 
company they were ; how many, we could not tell, but 
/ten.thoufand we thought was theleaft. Ajjarty of them 
came on firft, and viewed our pofture, traverfing~ the 
ground in the front of our line ; and as wc found them 
within gun-fhot, our leader ordered the two wings to 
advance fwiftly, and give them a f^lvo on each wing with 
their (hot, which was done ; but they went off, and I 
fuppofe went back to give an account of the reception 
they were like to meet with ; and, indeed, that falute 
clogged their ftomachs ; for they immediately -halted, 
flood awhile tp coniider of it, rnd, wheeling off to the 
left, they gave over the deiign, and faid no more to us 
for that lime, which was very agreeable to our circum- 
Itances, which were but very indifferent for a battle with 
fuch a number. 

Two days after this we came to the city of Naum, or 
Naunm ; we thanked the governor for his care for us, 
and coUecled to the value of 100 crowns, or thereabouts, 
which we gave to the foldiers fent to guard us : and here 
we relied one day. This is a garrifon indeed, and there 
•were nine hundred foldiers kept here : but the reafon 
of it was, that formerly the Mufcovite frontiers lay 
nearer to them than they do now, the Mufcovites hav- 
ing abandoned that ])art of the counti;y*( which lies from 
the city weft, for about two hundred miles) as defolatc

find unfit for ufe j and more efpecially, bting fo very 
remote, and fo. difficult to fend troops hither for its 
defence; for" we had yet above two thoufand miles to ' 
Mufcovy, properly fo called. 

After this we pafTed feveral g^reat riv"^rs, and two dread- 
ful deferts, one of which we were fixteen days paffing 
over, and which, as I faid, was to be called No Man's 
Land ; and on the 1 3th of April, we came to frontiers of. 
the Mufcovite dominions. 1 think the firft city, or town, 
or fortrefs, whatever it might be called, that belonged 
to the Czar of Mufcovy, was called Argun, being on the 
well fide of the river Argun. 

, 1 could not but difcovcr an infinite fatisfacSlion, that I 
was now arrived in, as I called it a chriftian country ; 
ot, at leaft, in a country governed by chrifiians ; for 
though the Mufcovites do, in my opinion, but jult dc- 
ferve the name of chrifiians ; yet fuch they pretend to 
be, and are very devout in their way. It would certainly 
occur to any man who travels the world as I have done, 
and who had any power of reflection ; I fay, it would 
occur to him to refledV, what a blefiing it is to be 
brought into the world where the name of God, and of 
a Redeemer, is known, vvorihipped, and adored, and 
not where the people, gkven up by heaven to ilrong 
delufions, worihip the devil, and proftrate theml'elves 
to (locks and ftones ; worfliip monfters, elements, hor- . 
rible fiiaped animals, * and ftatues, or images of mon- 
fters. Not a town or city we palTed through but had 
their pagods, their idols, and their temples, and igno- 
rant people worfhipping even the works of^ their own 
hands. 

Now we came where, at leaft, d face of the chriftian 
worfhip appeared, where "the knee was bowed to Je- 
fus ; and Whether ignorantly or not, yet the chrifi:ian 
religion was owned, and the name of the true God was 
called upon, and adored ; and it made the very recelFes 
of my loul rejoice to fee it, I faluted the brave Scotch 
merchant I menticnsd above, with my firll acknc^wledg- ' 
^ ment of this; and, taking him by the hand, I faid to 
hirh, blefled be God, we are once again come amonsr 
chriftians. He fmiled, and anfwered, do not rejoice too

chriftians; 'and but for the name of it, you may fet 
very little of the fubftancc for fome months farther of our 
journey. - 

Well, faid I, but flill 'tis better than paganifm, and 
worfhippinsc of devils. Why, I*irtell you, faid he; 
•except the Ruffian foldiers in garrifons ; and a few of the 
inhabitants of the cities upon the road, all the reft of 
this country, for above a thoufand miles farther, is inha* 
bited by the worft, and moil ignorant of Pagans; and 
fo indeed we found it. 

We were now launched into the greatefl piece of folid 
earth, if I underftand any thing of the furface of the 
globe, that is fo be found in any part of the world; 
we had at leaft twelve hundred nrules to the fea, eaft- 
ward ; we ha-d at leaft two thonfand to the bottom t)f 
the Baltic fea, weftward; and almoft three thoufand 
miles, if we left that fea, and went on weft to the Bri- 
tifh and French channel^ ; w^ had full ^ve thonfand miles 
to the Indian or Perftan fea, fouth ; and about eight 
hundred miles to the frozen fea, north ; nay, if forae 
people may be believed, there might be no lea north* 
caft till_ we came round the pole, and confequently into 
the north-weft, and fo had a continent 6f land into 
America, no mortal knows where ; though I could 
give fome reafons why I believe that to be a miftakc 
too. ' 

4^8 we entered into the Mufcovite dominions, a good 
while before we came to any conftderable town, we 
had nothing to <]ibfcrve there but this ; firft, that all the 
rivers run to the eaft. As I undertlood by the charts 
which fome of our cjiravans had with them, it was 
plain that all thofe rivers ran into the great river 
Yamour, or GTammour. Tjiis river, by the natural 
courfe of it, muft run into the eaft fea, or Chineie 
ocean. The ftory they tell us, that the mouth of this 
river is choaked up with bulrufhes of a monftroas 
growth, viz. three feet about, and twenty or thirty 
feet high, I muft be allowed to fay, I believe nothing of; 
but as its navigation is of no nfe, becaufe there is 
no trade that way, the Tartars, to whom alone it 
belongs, dealing in nothing but cattle ; {o nobody that 
ever I heard of, has beea curious enough either to 

go

^o down to the motith of it in boats^ or come up from 
the mouth of it in (hips; but this is certain, that this 
river, running due eaft, in the latitude of 60 degrees, car- 
ries a vaft concourfc of rivers along with it, and finds an 
occanto empty itfelf in that latitude ; fo wc are fure oi 
fca^here. 

Some-leagues to the north of this river \hkTt arc feverai 
Confidcrable rivers, whofe dreams run as due north as the 
Yamour runs eaft; and thefe are all found to join their 
waters with the great river Tartarus, named fo from the 
northernmoft nations of the Mogul Tartars, who, the 
Chinefe fay, were the firft Tartars in the world ; and who^ 
as our geographers alledge, are the Gog ami Magog men- 
tioned in facred flory. 

The rivers running all northward, as well as all the 
other rivers I am yet to fpcak of, make it e\'Tdent, that 
the northern ocean bounds the land alfo on that 
fide ; fo that it does not feem rational in the lead to 
think, that the land can extend itfelf to join with Ame- 
rica on that fide, . or that (here is not a communication 
between the northern and the eattern ocean ; but of 
this I (hall fay no more ; it was ray obfervation at that 
time, and therefore I take notice of it in this place. Wc 
now advanced from the river Arguna, by eafy and mo- 
derate journjes, and were very viiibly obliged to the 
'care the czar of Mufcovy has taken to have cities 
and towns built in as many places as ale poflible to 
to place them, where his foldiers keep garrifon, fome- 
thing like the ftationary fokliers placed by the Romans 
in the remoteft corners of their empire, fome of which I 
had read were particularly placed in Britain for the fecu^ 
rity of commerce, and for the lodging of travellers ; and 
thus it was here; for wherever we came, though at thefe 
towns and ftations the garrifon ai\d governor were 
Ruffians, and profeffed mere Pagans, fi^crificing to idols, 
and worfliipping the fun, moon, and flars, or all the 
hoft of heaven : and not only fo, but were, of all the hea- 
thens and pagaiis that ever I met with, the mod barba- 
rous, except only that they did not eat men's flefh, as 
our favages of America did.

"foreil, which coft us twenty days t\) travel over it. In 
a village, near the laft of thofe places, i had the curi- 
oiity to go and fee their ^ay of livir.g ; which is moft 
brutifh aud infu^erable , they had, I fappofe, a great 
Sacrifice that day ; for their ilood-out;, upon an old ftunfip 
of a tree, an idol made of ^wood, tnghtfulas the devil; 
at leall as any thing we can think of to reprefent the 
devil can bemade ; it liad an head certainly not fo much 
relembling any creature that the world ever faw ; ears 
as big as goat's horns, "and as hith; ^-es as big as a 
crown piece ; a nofe like a crooked ram*s horn, and 
a mouth extended four-cornered, like that of a lion,> 
"with-horriMe leelh, hooked like a parrot's under bill"; 
it was drelTcd up in the fxlthieft manner that you c^n 
iuppofe ; its upper garment was of fheep fl^ins, with the 
■wool outward ; a^ great taitar bonnet on the head, with 
two horns growing through it : it was about eight feet 
Tiicvh, yet had^o feet or legs, or any other proportion^ 
of parts 

This fcarecfow was feft up at the out-fide of tlie vil- 
bo^e : ^nd when I came near to it, there were fixteen 
or leventeen creatures, whether men or women I 
could not tell, for they make no diftincflion by their 
habits, either of body or head ; thefe lay all 'fiat on the 
ground, rpund this formidable block of fliapelefs wood; 
1 faw no motion among them, any more than if they 
liad been logs of wood like their idol. At firil 1 really 
thought they had been fo ; but when 1 came a little 
nearer, they Ttarted up upon their feet, and raifed an 
howling cry, as if it had been fo many deep-mouthed 
•>.ounds, and walked avway as if they were difpleaVed at 
our dirt urbing them. A little way off from this mon- 
ger, and at the dooT of a tent or hut, made all of 
fheep-fkins and cow-fkins, dried, ftood three butchers ^ 
I thought they were fuch ; fbr when 1 came nearer to 
them, 1 found they had long knives in their hands, 
and in the middle of the t^nt appeared three fheep

^erfteen proftfated wretches were the people who broujjht

^ock. 

I confefs I was more moved at their ftupidty, and 
this brutifh worfllip of an hobgobUn, than ever 1 wa« 
at any thing in my life ; to fee God's molt glorious 
and bed creature, to whom he had granfted fo many 
a<lvantages, even by creation, above the reft of the 
•works of his hands, vefted with a rcafonable foul, and 
that foul adorned with faculties and capacities adapted 
^oth to honour his Maker, and be honoured by him ; 
J fay, to fee it funk and degenerated to a degree fo 
more than ftupid, as to proftrate itfclf 'to a frightful no* 
thing,^ a mere imaginary obje6l, dreifed up by them- 
felves, and made terrible to themfelves by thfeir own 
^-contrivance, adorned only with clouts and rags ; and 
•that this fhould be the cffedl: of mere ignorance, wrought 
up in helHQi devotion by the devil himfelf ; who, en- 
vying his Maker the homage and adoration of his 
creatures, had deluded them into fuch grofs, furfeiting, / 
fordid, and brutifh things, as one would think Hiould 
ihock nature itfelf, 

Bui what fignified ail 'the aftonifliment and refle<5lion 
of my thoughts/? Thus it was, and 1 faw it before my 
eyes ; and there was no room to wonder at it, or think 
it impoflible-; all my admiration turned to rage ; andf 
I rode up to the image or raonfter, call it what you , 
will, and with my fWord cut the bonnet that was on 
•its head in two in the mixldl^, fo that it hung down by 
one pf the horns ; and one of our men that was with 
me took hold of the (heep (kin that covered it,' and pul- 
led at it, when, behold a moft hideous outcry and 
howling ran through the village, and two or three 
hundred people came about ray ears, fo that I was

ibme leifure here to put ray deiign io execution. I 
communicated my proje6l to the Scots merchant of 
Mofcow, of whofe courage I had a fufficient teftimony, 
^s above. I told him what I had feen, and with what 
indignation I had_ iince thought, that human nature 
•could be fo degenerate,, I told him, I was refolved, if 
I could get but four or five men, well armed, to go with 
me, to go and delkoy that vile abominable idol : to 
let them fee that it had no power to help itfclf, and 
•confequentlj could not be an obje(ft of worfliip, or to be 
tprayed te, m'veh lefe help them that offered facrifices

He laughed at me : faid be. Your zeal may be good ; 
^ut what do you propofe to youdelf by it ? Propofe ! 
ifaid I, to vindicate the honour of God, which is in- 
ifulted by this devil- worfliip. But how will it vindi- 
«cate the honour of God ? faid he, while the people 
will not be able to know what you mean by it, unlefs 
you could fpeak to them too, and tell them fo ; and 
then they will fight you too, I will aflure you ; for 
they are defperate fellows, and that efpecially in de- 
fence ^f their idolatry. Can we not, (aid I, do it in 
the night, and then leave them the reafons in writing, 
in their own language ? Writing I faid he, why there 
is not, in five nations of them, one man that knows an) 
thing of a letter, or how to read a word in any lan- 
V guage, or in their own. Wretched ignorance ! faid I 
to him4 however, I havea^great mind to do it ; perhaps 
nature may draw inferences from it to them, to let thera 
fee how brutifli they are to worfhip fuch horrid things. 
Look you. Sir, liiid he, if your zeal prompts you to it fc 
^warmly, you muft do it; but, in the next place, i 
would have you confider thefe wild nations of peoph 
'are fubje(fted, by force, to the czar of Mufcovy's do-

This,. I confefs,^ put new thoughts into my head for 
a while ; but I harped upon the fame firings ftill ; anc^ 
all that day I was uncafy to put my projeA in execu- 
tion. Towards the eveningr the Scots- merchant met 
me by accident in our walk about the town, and de- 
fired to fpeak with me : I believe, faid he^ 1 have- 
put you off your good deiign ; I have been a little con— 
eemed about it fmce ;. for I abhot the idol and idolatry^ 
as much as you can do. Truly, faid I^ you have 
put it off a little as to the execution of it, but you 
hav6 not put it all out of my thoughts ; and, I believe, I 
fliall do it ftill before 1 quit this place, though I -were 
to be delivered up to them for fatisfaftion. No, no, 
feid he ; God forbid they fhould deliver you up to fuch: 
a crew of monftersl they ihall not do that neither;- 
that would be murderi^ng you indeed.. Why, faid I, 
how would they ufe me ? Ufe you ! faid he ; TU tell 
you how they lervcd a poor Ruiliau who affronted them 
m their worfiiip juft'as you did, and whom- they took 
prifoner ; after they had lamed him with an arrow,, that 
he could net run away, they took him. and flripped hira; 
ftark naked, and fet him upon the top of the idol mon* 
fter, and flood all round him, and ihot as^ many ar— 
sows into him as would f^ick over his^whole body,. and<> 
then they burnt him and all the arrows flicking in* 
him, as a facrifice to the idol. And was thi? the fame^ 
idol ? faid 1. Yes, faid he, the very fame. Well, faid 
I, I will tell you a flory : fo I related the ftory of our men 
at Madagafcar, and how they burnt and facked the vil- 
lage there, and killed, man> woman, and child, for their 
murdering one of our men, juft as it is related before ;, 
and when I had done,. I added^ that 1 thought we ought. 
to do fo to this village. 

He Jiflened very attentively to the ftory ; but when; 
I talked of doing fo to that village, faid he, you millake 
very much ; it was not this village, it was almoft a hun- 
dred miles from this place;: but it was the fame idol,, 
for they carry him about in proceffion all over the 

country. Well, faid I, then that idol ought to bc;

and told me I (hould not go alone, but he would go 
with me; but he would go firft, and bring a ftout 
fellow, one of his countrymen, to go alfo with us ; and 
one, faid he, as famous for his zenl as-3'ou can ilefire 
any one to be againft fuch devilifli things a* thefe. In 
a word, he brought me his Gomrade, a Scotfman, whom 
he called Captain Richardfon; and I gave him a full ac- 
crunt of what 1 had feen, and alfo of what 1 intended ; 
and he told me readily, he would go with me, if it coil 
him his life/ So we agreed to go, only we three. 1 had, 
indeed, propofed it to my partner, but he declined it. We 
faid, he was ready to aflill me to the utmofV, and upon alll

our woik, only we three, and my man-fervnnt, and to put 
it in execution that night about midnight, with all the 
fecrecy imaginable. 

However, upon fecond thoughts, we-were willing to 
delay it till the next nights, bccaufe the caravan being to 
fet forward in the morning, we fuppofed t'he governor 
could not pretend to give them any fatisfaftion upon us 
■">vhen we were out of his power ; the Scots mierchant, as 
Iteady in his refolution to enterprize it, as bold in exe- 
cuting, brought me a Tartar 'strobe or gown of (heep- 
ikins, and a bonnet, >\ith a bow and arrows, and had 
provided the fame for himfelf and his countryman, that 
the people, .if they faw us,fhould not be able to dcterniine

We came to the place about eleven o'clock- at- night, 
and found that the j>eople had not the lead jealoufy of

h-eard people talking, as if there were -five or lix of

to the idol, thefe men vyAuld come out immediately, 
aiid run up to the place to refcue it from the do- 
llrudlion that we Intended for it i and what to do with 
them we knew not. O^ice we thought of carrying it 
away, and fetting fire to it at a diltance '^ but whea 
vrt came to handle it, we found it too bulky for our 
carriage ; fo we were at a lofs acjain» The fecond. 
ScotrnTcm was for fetiinjj fire to the tent or hut, and 
knocking the creaurcs that were there on. the head 
"when they came out ; but 1 could not join with that ; 1 
was againll killing^ihem, if itvvas poliibleto be avoided. 
Well, then, i'aiil the Scots merchant, 1 will tell you what 
wc ^vill do ; we will try to take them prifoners, tie rheir 
Ran s, and make, rheni lland and fee their idol de» 
firoyed. 

As it hiippencd', we had twipe or^packthread enough 
^bout us, which we ufed to tie our fire- works together 
with ; fo we reiolved. to attack thefe people firft, and 
with as little noife as we could. The lirll thing we did,. 
we knocked at the door, when one of the priefts 
coming to, it, we immediately feized upon, him, ftoppcd 
his mouth, and tied his hands^behind him and led him to 
the idol, where we sagged him, that he might not make 
a noife ;, tied his. feet alfo together, and left him on the 
ground. 

Two of us then waited at the door, expe<5ling thatv 
another would come out to. fee what the, matter vyasij ' 
but we waited fo long that the third man ccjmc back t^ 
us; and then, nobody coming out, we knocked again 
gently, and immediately out came two more, and w^ 
lerved them iuft in the fame manner, but were obliged 
to. go all with them, and lay them down by the idol 
fome dillance from one another; when, going bac|{, 
"we found two more were come out to the door, and 
a third ftood behmd them withiq the cloor. We leizcU 
the two, and immediately tied them, when the, third

men already bound, and tied together alfo by the arm^ 
ltd them away to the idol, and left them there, to fee 
if their idol would relieve them, making hafte back to 
us."" 

When the furze we had thrown in had filled the hut 
with fo* much fmoke that they were almoft fufFocated, 
we then threw in a fmall leather bag of another kind, 
which flamed like a candle, and, following it in, we 
found ther^ were but four people left, who, it feems,. were 
two men and two women, and, as we fuppofed, had 
been about fome of their diabolical facrifices. They 
appealed, in (hort, frighted to death, at lead fo as to fit 
trembling anjrl ftupid, and not able to fpeak neither, for 
the fmoke. • - 

Irv a word, we took them, bound them as we had the 
other, a«<l aM without any noife. I Ihould have faid,. 
we brought them out of the houfe, or" hut, firft ; for> 
indeed, we- were not able to bear the fmoke any more 
than they were* When we had done* this, we carried 
thenL altogether to the Idol;, when we cam«- there we 
fell to work with him ; and firil we daubed him all- 
over, aiul his robes alfo, with tar, and fuch, otbeiT 
ItuB as we had, which was tallow mixed with< brim* 
jSone ; then, we flopped his eyes, and ears, and^ mouth 
tfiW of gun-powder ; then we wrapped up a. great 
piece of wild fire in his bonnet ;. and then- flicking 
all the cpmbuflibles we had brought with us upon him, 
wie looked . about to fee if we could fiiid any thing cite 
to help to burn him : when my Scotfman remem- 
bered, that Sy the tent or hut where the men were, 
there lay a heap of dry forage, whether ftraw or rufhejs 
1 do not remember: away he and the other Sootfman 
Tian, and fetched their arms full of that. When we had 
done this, we took all o\xt prifonets, and broughtr them, 
having untied their feet, and ungagged thein mouths, 
9nd made thenv fiand up, and fet them jull before 
their monSrous idpl^ and thea fet. fits, U> the

We (laid by it a quarter of an hour, or thereabouts,, 
till the powder in the eyes, and mouth, and cars of the- 
idol blew up, and, as we eould perceive, had fplit and 
deformed the fliape of it, and, in a word, till we faw,. 
it burnt intb a mere block or log of wood ; and then.? 
letting the dry forage to it^ we found it would' be foon 
quite confumed ; fo we began to think of going away ; 
but the Scotchman faid r r>Jo, we mud not go ; for thele 
poor deluded wretches will all throw themfelves into the 
fire, and burn themfelves with the idol ;. fo we refolved 
to ftay till the forage was- burnt dbwn too,.. and then we- 
' came away and left them. 

In the morning we appeared among' our fellow tra- 
vellers, exceeding bufy in getting ready for our journey;: 
nor could any man fuggeft that we had been any- 
where but in our beds, as travellers might be fuppoiedu 
to be, to fit tbemfelvea^ for the fatigiies ofL that day' s^ 
journey. 

But it did not end £o ; for the next day came a jgreatT 
multitude of the country people, not only of this vil- 
lage, but of an hundred more, for, aught 1 know, to> 
the town gates,. and, in a moil outrageous manner, de- 
manded fatisfa<9:ion of the Ruffian governor, for the in— 
fulting their priefts^ and burning their great Cham— 
€hi-Thaungu; fuch an hard name they gave the mon— 
flrous creature they worfhipped : the people of Nert— 
zinikay were kt firft in a great confternation : for, they; 
faid, the Tartars were no lefs than 30,0P0, and; 
that in a few days more, they would^ be 100,0QO; 
ftrong. 

The Ruffian governor fent out meflengers to appeafc: 
them, and gave them all the good words imaginable. 
He alfured tnem he knew nothing of it, and that there

The orovernor^. ililj jfatient, and unwilling to make a^ 
breach, or'to have any caufe of war alledged to be given 
by him, the Czar having itraightly charged him to treat 
the conquered country with g^entlenefs and civility, gave 
them Itill all the good words he could ; a't lall he told 
them, there was a caravan gone towards Kuffia that 
morniig, aud, perhaps, itvva? Come of them, who had 
done them this injury ; . and that, if they would be fatis-- 
fied with that^ he woufd fend after them, to enquire into, 
it* This feemed to appeafe them a- little ; and accord- 
ingly the governor feht.after us,, and gave, us a particular 
account how the things was ; intimating withal,, that if 

, any in.our. caravan had done it,. they ihould make their 
cfcape;. but that, whether they had done it or no, we 
ihould make all the halle forward that was poflible ; and 
that in the mean time, he would, keep them ia play as. 
long as^ he could; 

This. was very friendly in the governor. However,., 
when it came- to the caravan, there was nrobody knew 
any thing of the matter ; arul, as for us that were guilty,. 
we were the leall of all fu('ped:ed ; none fo much as^ 
a(ked us the queftio^n ; however, the captain of the 
caravan, for the time, took the hint that the governor 
gave us, and .we marched or travelled two days and two 
nights without any coniideFable ftop, and then we lay:

we were ftiU before them, pulhed on, till they came to 
the river Udda ; this is a very great riv:er when it paffes 
farther north ; but when we came to it, wc found it nar- 
row and formidable; 

The third day they either found their miftake, or 
had intelligence of us, and came j>ouring in upon urs, 
towards the dUfic of the evening. We had,., to our great 
fatisfadliouj juft pitched upon a place for- our camp 
which was very >convenient for the night : for as we 
were upon a* defert, though but at the beginning of 
it; that wa« above five hundred miles over, we-, had 
no towns to lodge a^ and, indeed, expefted none but 
the city JarawH , which we had yet two dai s' march- 
to ; the defert, however, had fome few woods in it oa 
this fidfe, and. little rivers, which ran all into the great 
river Udda. Jt was in a narrow, ftreifght between tw«>' 
fmall, but very thick woods, that we pitched our little 
camp for that nighty expeifiing to be attacked iti the 
night. 

Nobody knew but ourielves wKat we were purfuedl. 
for : but as it was ufual for the Mogul Tartars to «ro' 
about in troops in that defert, fo the caravans al ways- 
fortify them felves every night againft them, as againft. 
armies of robbers ; and it was therefore no new thing to/ 
be purfued. 

But we had this night,, of all the nights- of our tra« 
vels, a mod advantageaus camp ; for we lay between 
two wootls, with a little rivulet running jull before our 
front ; fo that we could not be lurrounded or attacked 
any way, but in.our front or rear ; we>took care alia t©^- 
make our front as ftrong as we- could, by jilacing oUr

they might bum them with. fire ; and, npon this, they 
faid, they would go away,, and do us no farther barm,^

looked veiy blank at this meflage, and began ^ to ilare

a Ibng^ilory, that the people who had burnt their Ch^m— 
€hi-Thaungu were gone to Sibeilka, with a caravan of 
mifcreants^ as he- called them ; that is to lay, Chrillians ;- 
and that they w^re refolvcd to burnv thegpd Seal Ifarg^ 
belonging to the Tongueies. 

As this fellbw was a mere Tartar^ and perfeftly fpoke^ 
their language,, he counterfeited fo well, that they all 
took it from him, and away they drove, in.a-moit vio- 
lent hurry^ to Sibeilka, which it feeins, was five days*' 
journey to the fouth^ and iii lefs ih an three hours- they. 
were entirely out of our fight, abd we never heard any 
more of them,, or ever knew whether they went to that- 
other place called Sibeilka, or no. 

So we palTed fafely. on to the Gity of? Jarawenaf, 
where there was a garrifon of Mufcovites-;: ami there Ivc 
reded five day »> the caravan being exceedingly fatigued, 
with the laii day's, march,, and with want ^ of reil in the 
night. 

rrom this city we had a frightful defert,. which heldv 
us three and twenty days' march. .We furnifhedourfelves 
with fome tents here, tor the better/ accommodating our* 
felves in the night ;., and the leader of the caravan pro-- 
€ured fixteen carriages- or waggons, of the country, f or , 
carrying our waters and grovifions ;. and thefc carriages- 
were our defence every night round our little camp ; fb 
that had tfee Tartars appeared, uxilefs they, had been 
very, numerous indeed,, they would not have been able to 
hurt us, 

Wc may well be fuppofed to want reft, again, after- 
this long journey;: for,^ in this defert, we faw neither 
houfe nor tree, nocfcarce abufli; we faw, indeed, abun- 
dance of the fabk-hunters, as-they call them; thefe are 
all Tartars of Mogul. Tartaryi of which this country, 
is a part;: and they frequently attack fmall caravans : ,

otherwife make it vrery dangerous travellinor ; and his 
Czari^h raajefty has oriven fuch llridl orders for- the well

any 'j artars heard of in the country, detnchinents of the 
garrifoa are always fent to fee travellers ia-e from Itatioii

And thus the governor of Adinflcoy, whom I had an 
opportunity to make a vifit to, by means of the ^'cots 
merchant Who was acquainted with him, offered us a 
guard of hfty men, if we thought there was any danger, 
to the next ft ition. 

J thought long before this, that, as we came nearer 
to Europe, we ibouTd find the country better peopled,, 
and the people more civilized ; but 1 found myfelf mil-- 
taken in both, for we had yet the nation of the Tonguefes^ 
to i^ais throL^h : where we faw the fame tokens of pa— 
ganifm and barbarity, or worfe than before ; only as 
they were conijuereil by the Mufcovites, and entire! J- 
reduced, they were not fo .dangerous ; but for the rude— 
nefs of manners, idolatr) , and pplythcifm, no people ia. 
the world ever went beyond them. They arectothed *alV 
in the (k\hs of beafts,,an'i their houfcs are built of the- 
fame. You know not a man from a woman, neither 
hy the nuggednefs of their countenances nor their clothes;: 
and in the winter, when the ground, is covered with^ 
fnow, they live under ground Ja houfes like vaults,, 
which have cavities or caves going from on^ to another. 

If the- Tartars had their C ham-Chi-Thaungu for a^ 
whole village or country, thefe had idol* in every hut, 
and every cave ; befijtles, they Worfliip the ftars, the funV

Tere travelling, without houfe, tree, or bufti ; but were 
obliged again to carry our own proviiions, as well water 
as bread. After we were out of thisdefert, andjiad tra- ' 
veiled two days, we carne to Janezay, a Muicovitc city 
orftation, on the great river Janezay. This river, they 
told us, parted Europe 'from Alia, though aar map- 
raakers, as 1 am told, do not agree to it ; however, it \s 
certamly the eailern boundary of the antient Siberia,, 
which now makes^a province only of the vail Alufcovitc 
empire, but is itleh' equal in bignefs to thewhole empire 
of Germany. 

And yet here lobferved ignorance and paganifm ftill 
J)Fevailed; except in the Mufcovite garrilbns; all the 
country between the riverOby, and the river Janezay,, 
is as rntirely pagan, and the people as barbarous, as the

know, in Alia, or America. 1 alfo found, which J ob-

was true enough, but, they faid, it was none of their 
bufinefs ; that if the Czar expedcd to convert- his Sibe--. 
rianj or Tonguefe, or Tartar fubjedts, it fhodd be done- 
by fending clergymen among them, not foldicrs; and,

I have nothing material to fay of my. particuJaf' 
affairs, till I came to ToboKki* the capital >of Siberia,- 
where I continued fome time om the following ocda*- 
fion. 

We had beennow dmoft-feven months onour journey^ 
and winter began to come on apace : whereupon my 
partner and^I called a council about our particular affairs^. 
in which we found it proper, confidering that we were 
bound for England, and not for Mofcow, to oonfider- 
how to difpofe of ourfelves^ They told us of fledges and 
rein-deer, to carry us over the fnow in the winter-time ; 
and, indeed, they have fuch things,, as it would be in— 
eredible to relate the particulars- of, by which means: the 
Ruflians travel more in the winter thanthey canin fum- 
iner ;:becaufe in thefe fledges they are able to run night 4 
and day : the fnow being frozen, is one univerfal cover*- 
ing to nature,- by which the hills, the vales, the rivers,, 
the lakes, are all fmootfa, and hard as a fione ; and they 
run upon the fucface, without any regard to what is^ 
underneath. 

But I had no ocsafibn to pufli at a winter journey of 
this kind : I was bound to England, hot to Mofcow,, 
and m}' route two ways : either I muft go on as the ca- 
ravan went, till I came to Jariflaw, and then. go off weffc . 
for Narva, and the gulph of Finland, and fo- either by: 
fca or land to Dantzick, where I might poffibly fell my 
China cargo to good advantage, or! muft leave the cara- 
van at a litde town on the Dwina, from, whence I had. 
but fix days by water to Arch- Angel, and from thence- 
might be lure of ihipping,^. either to England, Holland^ 
Qr Hamburgh* 

Now to go any of thefe joumies in the winter would^ 
Bave been prepofterous;. for as to Dantzick, the Baltic- 
would be frozen up, and I could not- get pa^ge :: 
and to go by land in thofe countries, was far lefs fafe: 
than among the Mogul Tartars : likewifeto Arch- Angel,, 
in Odlober all the (hips would* be gone from thence,, and.

there in an empty town all the winter ; fo that, upon the 
whole, I thought it much my better way to let the cara- ' 
van go» and to make provilion to winter where I was, 
vii. at ToboWki, in Siberia, in the latitude of llxty de- ' 
grees, where I was fure of three things to wear out a cold 
winter with, viz. plenty of provifions, fuch as the country 
afforded, a warm boufe, with fuel enough, and excellent 
company ; of all which I will give a full account in it« 
place. 

I was now in a qiilte different cliraate from my be- 
joved ifland, where 1 never felt cold,, except when I 
nad my ague ; on the contrary, I had much to do to 
bear my clothes on my b^ck^ and never made any 
fir« but without doors,, and my neccflity, in drefT- 
ing my- food, &c. Now 1 made me three good vcfts, 
with large robes or gowns over them to hang down 
to the feet, and button clofe to the wrifts, and all 
thefe lizicd with. furs,, to make them . fufiiciently 
warm*. 

As to- a warm boufe, I muft confefs, I greatly dif- 
:c our way in England, of making fires in every 
om in the houfe, in open chimneys, which, when 
the fire was out, always kept the air in the room cold 
as the climate. But taking an apartment in a good 
hpufe in the town, I ordered a chimney to be built 
like a furnace, in the centre of fix feveral rooms, like 
a ftovc ; the funnel to carry the fjnoke went up on6 
way^ the door to come at the fir^ went in^ another,, 
and all the rooms were kept equally warm, but 
no fire fcen; like as they heat the bagnios in Eng.- 
land. ^ ^ ^ , 

By thiB means we had always the fame climate in all 
the rooms, and an equal heat was prelerved ;. and how 
cold foever it was without,, it was always warmv within ;. 
and yet we faw no fire,, nor was ever; incommoded with 
anyimoke. 

The moft wonderful thing, of all was, that it fhould be 
^oflible to meet with, good company here, in a country 
lo barbarous as that of the moil northerly parts of Eu-

Me had been telling me abundance of fine things, of 
the greatiiefs, the magnificence, and dominions, and the 
abfolute power of the emr|)erors of the Ruffians. I anter- 
rupted him, and toW him, 1 was a greater and more 
powerful prince than, ever the Czar of Mufcovy was, 
though my dominions^ were not fo large, or my people 
fo many. . " 

The Ruffian Grandee looked a little furprifed, and 
fixing his eyes fteadily upon me, began to wonder what

would not go back, no, not tho' my mafter,. the Czar,.

1 told him, I once thought myfelf a kind of a mo- 
aarch in my old flation,. of which I had given him an 
account, but tfcat 1 though he was not a monarch only,, 
but a great conqueror;, for that he that has got a 
vi<5iory over his own exorbitant defires, and has the

Hold, faid he, your qiieftion is fubtle,. and requires 
ibmc ferious juil diftindlions to give it a fincerc an- 
fwer ; and 111 give it you from the bpttom of my 
lieart. Nothing that I know of in this world would 
move me to deliver myfelf from the ^ftate of bani(h« 
ment, except thefe two : Firft, the er^oyment of my 
Telations ; and fecondly, A little warmer cliinate ; but 
I proteft to you, that to go back to the pomp of th« 
court, the glory, the power, the hurry of a miniftcr 
of ftate ; the wealth, the gaiety, and the pleafures, that 
is to fay, follies of a courtier; if my matter ihould 
fend me word this moment, that he reftores me 
to all he baniihed me from : 1 proteft, if I know 
myfelf at aM, I would not leave this wildemefs, thefe 
defe rts, and thefe frozen lakes, for the palace of 
Mpfcow, 

But, my Lord, faid I, perhaps you not only are ba- 
5iiihed from the pleafures of the court, and from the 
power, and authority, and wealth, you enjoyed be- 
fore, but you may be abfent too from fome of the con- 
Teniencies of Iffe; your eftate, perhaps, confifcated, 
andyaur effcdls plundered: and the fuppUes left you 
bere may not be fuitable to the ordinary demands of 
life. . 

Ay, faid he, that is as you fuppofe me to be a Lord, 
or a PiinCe, &c. So, indeed, I am ; but you are now 
to condder me only as a man, a human creature, not 
at all dilHnffuifhed from another : and fo I can fuffer no 
want, unlefs 1 fhould be vifited with (icknefs and dif-

I have no room to give a full aeqount of the iftoft 
•agreeable converfation I had with this truly great 
man ; and in aTl which he (hewed, that his mind was 
to infpired with a fuperior knowledge of things, fo fup- 
ported by religion, as- well as by a vafl (hare of wif- 
dom, that his contempt of the world was really AS 
much as he had exprefled, and that he was always the 
■fame to the kft, ^s will appear in the ftdry I am going 
to tell. 

I had been here e^ght months, and a dark dreadful 
winter I thought it to be; the cold w^as fo intenle, 
that I, could nt)t fo much as look abroad without be- 
ing wrapt m furs, and a mafk of fur before my face, 
or rather ^ hood, with only ten lidle forljreath, and 
two for (ight. The little day-light we tad, was, as 
we reckoned, for three months, not above five hours a 
day, and (ix at molt; only that the fnow lying on the 
ground continually, and the weather clear, it was 
never quite dark. Our horfes were kept (or rather 
(larved) under ground ; "and, as for ottr fervatits (for 
we hired fervants here t<) loork after our bor/es and 
felves), we had every now and then their fingers and 
/ toes to thaw, and take care of, left they (hould mortify 
and fall off. 

It is true, within doors we were warm, the houfes 
being clofe, the walls thick, the lights fmall, and thfe 
crlafs all double. Our food was chiefly the iiefh of deer, 
dried and xured in the feafon ; good bread enough, but 
baked as bifcuits ; dried fi(h of feveral forts, and fomc 
flefh of mutton, and of iDnffaloes, which is pretty good 
betf. All the (lore of provifion for the winter are laid 
up in 'the fummer, and well cured i our drink was water 
mixed with aqua vitae, inftead of brandy; and, for a 
treat, mead inilead of wine ; which, however, they 
have excellent good. The hunters, who ventured abroad 
all weathers, frequently brought us in fre(h venifon, 
very fat arid good : and fomerimes bears iiefh, but we 
did not much care for the laft. We had a good flock 
of tea, with which we treated our friends as above ; and 
in a word, we lived very chearfully and well, all things 
confidered'.

It Was now March, and the days grown confider- 
^bly longer, and the weather at lealt tolerable; To 
other travellers begran to prepare fledges to carry them 
•over the fnow, ;ind to get things ready to he going; 
but my meafures being fixed, as I have faid, for A roll- ^. 
Angel, and not for Murcovy or the Baltic, I made no 
motion, knowing very well, that the Ihips from the 
fouth do not let out for that pait of the world till 
May or June : and that if 1 was there at the beginning 
of Aui^utl, it would be as foon as any (liips. would be 
ready to go away ; and therefore, 1 fay, I made no 
hafte to be gone, as others did? in a word, I law a 
great qiany people, nay^ all the- travellers, go away 
"before me. It feems, every year they go from thence 
\o Mufcow for trade, viz. to carry fur?, and buy necef- 
faries with them, which they bring back to furnifli 
their Ihqp? ; alfo others went on the fame errand to 
Arch-Angel ; but then they alfo, being to come back 
tigain above eight hundred miles, went out all before 
me. 

In (hort, about the latter end of May, Ibegan to make 
xiU ready to pack up ; and as f was doing this, it oc- 
curred to me:, that feeing all thefe people were baniflied 
hy the Czar of Mufcovy to Siberia, and yet, when they 
came there, were at liberty to go whither they would ; 
why did they not then go away to any part of 
the world wherever they thought fit ? and I began 
. to examine what fliould hinder them from making fuch 
an attempt. 

But my wonder was over, when I entered upon that 
fabje6l with the perfon I have mentioned, who an- , 
fwered me thus : Confider, firil. Sir, faid he, the 
place where we are ; and, fecondly, the condition we 
are in ; efpecially, faid he, the generality of the people 
who are banilhed hither. We are furrounded, faid he, 
with llronger things than bars and bolts; on the north, 
fide is an unnavigable ocean, where (hip never failed, 
and boat never fwam ; neither, if we had buth, could 

I Ave know whither to^go with them. Every cth^r way, 
aid he, we have above a thoufand miles to.pafs through

fo that we could neither pafs undifcovered by the road, 
or fubfift any other way ; fo that is in vain to attempt 

it. 

I was filenced, indeed, kt offce, and found that they 
were in prifon, every jot as fecurc, as if they had been 
locked up in the caille of Mofcow : however, it came 
into my thoughts, that I might certainly be made an 
inftrument to procure the efcape of this excellent per- 
fon, and that it was very eafy for rtle to carry him 
away, there being no guard over him in the country ; 
and as I was not going to Mofcow, but to Arch-Angel, 
and that I went in the nature cf a caravan, by which 
I was not obliged to lie in the ftationary towns in the 
defert, hut could encamp every night where I would, 
we might caiily pafs uninterrupted to Arch-Angel, 
■where I could immediately fecure him on board an 
Englifh or Dutch (hip, and carry him off fafe along 
"with me ; and as to his fubfiflence, and other particu- 
lars, that fhould be my care, till he ihould better fupply 
Iximfelf. ^ ^ 

H? heardme very attentvely, and looked eameftly 
on me all the while I fpoke ; nay, I could fee in his 
very face, that what I faid put his fpirits into an exceed- 
inor ferment ; his polour frequently- changed, his eyes 
looked red, and his heart fluttered, that it might be 
even perceived in his countenaiice ; nor could he im* 
mediately anfwer me, when I had done, and, as it were, 
expected what he would fay to it ; and after he had 
paufed a little, he embraced me, and faid, how unhappy

If I was furprifed before, I was quite dumb now, and 
ftood illent, looking at him ; and, indeed admired what 
I faw ; the ftruggle in his foul was fo great, that though 
the weather was extremely -cold, it put him into a moll 
violent fwcat, and I found he wanted to give vent to his 
mind ; (b I faid a word or two, that I would leave him 
to coniiderof it, and wait on him again ; and then 1 with- 
-drew to my own apartment. 

About two hours after, I heard ibmebody at or near 
the door of the room, and 1 was going to open the door; 
but he had opejaed it, and come in : My dear friend, 
faid he, you had almoft'overfet me, but 1 ara recovered : 
•do not take it ill that 1 do not clofe with your offer ; I 
aifure yo«, it is not for want of 1i fenfe of the kindness 
ef it in you ; ind I come to make the moft liacere ac- 
knowledgment of it to you ; but, I hope, I have got the 
Tidory over myfelf. 

My Lord, faid I, I hope you are fully fatisfied, that 
you did jaot refift the caW of heaven. Sir, faid he, if 
it had been from heaven, the Came power would have 
influenced me to accept it ; but I hope, and am fully 
^tisfied, that it is from heav-«n that I decline it ; and 
I have an infinite fatisfa^ion in the parting, that yoa 
ihall leave me an honeH man dill, though not a free 
man. 

I had nothing to <lo but to acquiefce, and make pro- 
feilion to him of my having no end in it, but a iincere 
^Jcfire to iScrve him. JHe embraced me vfery paflion- 
ately, and agured me, he was feniiblc of that, and- 
fhould always acknowledge it ; and with that he offered 
me a very fine prefcnt of fables, too much, indeed, foe 
me to accept from a man. in his circumdances ; and I 
would have avoided them« but he would not .be 
refufed. 

The next morning I fent my fervant to his Lord(hip, 
with a fmall prefent of tea, two pieces of China, da- 
mafk, and four little wedges of Japan gold, which did 
not all weigh above fix ounces, or thereaboMts ; but 
were far fhort of the value of his fables, wbich» in-

rous offer to him, he a(ked me, if I had kindnefs enough

fhould have been glad to have been the midrument of his

It was in the beginning of Jane, when I left this re-

merce, that I know not how it fhould be much talked* 
o£ We were now come to a very fm all caravan, be- 
ing only thirty-two horfes and camels ia all, and all of 
them palled for mine, though my new gueft was pro-

X (hould take more fervants with me than I had before, 
and the young Lord palled for my fteward ; what great

My young Lord had with him a faithful Mufcovitc

by private K>ads, that we avoided coming into the-

We were juft entered Europe, Having palled the river 
Kama, which, in thofe parts, is the boundary between- 
Europe and Afia ; and the firft city off the European iufe 
was called Soloy-Kamoikoy, which is as much as to fay^^ 
the great city on the river Kama ;. and here we thought 

. to have feen ^ome evident alteration iff the people, theJT 
manners, their habit, their reFigion, and their Bxifinels ; 
but we were miftaken ; for as we had a vaft defert to 
pafs, which i by relation, is near feven hundred miles 
long i« fome places, but not above two hundred miles 
over where we pafled it ; fo, till' we came paft that 
horrible place, we founds vciy httfe difference between^ 
that country and the Mogul Tartary ; the people molliy 
Pagans, and little better than tire favages of America;- 
their houfe and towns full of idols, and their way 
of living wholly barbarous, except in the cities a's 
aSovc, and the villages near them r where they' ate

mailer was the more willing to let him go, becaufe he 
was not a little apprebenuve that they were a Siberian 
troop fent out after himv The man' came np near them* 
with a flag- of jruce, and called to them ; but thougb* 
Be fpoke fevcral of their languages^ or dialedts of Ian— 
guages^ ratiicr, he could not undei^and a word they 
faid ; however, after fome^iigns to him not to come 
nearer to them at his peril ;. To he faid he underftood 
them to meatti offering to (hoot at him if he advanced ; 
the fellow came back no wifer than he went, only that 
by their drefs,, he faid,. he believed them, to be fome 
Tartars of Kalmuck, or of the Circaffian hords ; and' 
that there mull be more of them on the great, defert, tho' 
he never heard that ever any of them were fe^n jfo far- 
north before-. 

This was fnaall' comfort- to us ; however, we had no- 
Tcmcdy : there was on our left handi at about a quarter 
of & mile'& diftance, a \hi\t gr^ve or clump of trees,, 
which. Hood dofe tt^ether, and very near tbe road;* I 
immediately refolved we would advance to thofe trees,, 
and fortify ourl'elvesk as well as we couM there; for, 
firft, I confiderccl that the trees would in^ a great mea- 
fure couer us from- their arrows ; and, in the next place,, 
they could not come to oharge us ia a body : it was, 
indeed, my old Portuguefa pilot who propofed it : andi 
who had this excellency attending hira^ namely, that he 
"was always- readied and mod apt todiredl and cncourage- 
"BS in cafes of the mod danger. We advanced imme- 
diately with what fpeed w© could, and gained that little 
"wood, the Tartars or thieves, for we knew pot: what to 
daUthem^. keeping their dand,, and not attempting to 
liixi.der us. When we oame thither, we found, to our 
great ftti^faflaon, that it was a fwampy. ipringy piece 
of ground, anH, on the other fide, a very great fpring 
of w.aler^ which,, i^anning out in a lUtte rill or 
brook, was, a little ^vrther, joined by another* of the 
like bignefs : and was, in fliort; the head or Iburce of 
a confiderablc river, called afterwards the Wirtfta ;

feme hours, without perceiving they made any offer tO' 
ftlr; when' about two hours before nighfc, they canj^ 
down diredlly upon^ us ; antl, though, we had not j>er- 
eeived it, we found they had been joined by fome jnorq 
of the fame, fo that they were near fourfcore horfc^ 
%hcreof,- however, we fancied fomc were women.-^ 
They came on- till they were within, half a (hot of our 
little wood, when, we fired one mufquet without b«U,(, 
and called to- them: in the Ruliian tongue^ to know what" 
t«hey wanted, and bid them keep off; but, as- if they, 
knew nothing of what we faidy they came on- with a* 
double fury ciiredtly up to the wood fide,, not- imagining 
we were fo barricadoed that they could nojt break in ;, 
our old pilot was ou/ captain, as w«li as- he had been* 
our engineer; and defired of uS). not to fire upon them^ 
till they came within pi{lQli-(hot# that we- might be fore 
to kill ; and that when we did fire we (hould be fure- 
to take good ai-m. We bade- hiiS) give the word of^ 
command ; whieh he delayed fo long, that they were» 
^me of tbem> within two piket^ lengths of ua when we- 
fired. 

We aimed fo true (or Providence- dire($hd our (hot{o

and'wounded feveral others^, as al(b A'veral of th'ir horfes^; 
for We had all of us loaded our pieces witb^twi or three 
bullets a piece at leal^ 

1 hey were terribly furprsfed withoiur fire, and retreated 
immediately aboitt TOO rods from ua; in which time we 
loaded oup pieces again^, and, feeing them keep that 
dillance, we falied out, and caught four or live of 
th^if hotfea^^ whofe riders, we fuppolied, were killed;

and, coming lip to the dead, we could cailly pcrteivi 
they*werc Tartstrs, bat ktiew not from what countf}v 
6r how they came to make an* cxcurfion fuchan un* 
l^ual length. 

About aft hour afferi tficy made a motion to attack us. 
again, and rode round our nttlc wood, to fee where elfc 
they might break in ; but finding us always ready to face 
them, thev went off again, and" wcrefolved not to ftir 
from the place foV that night. 

We ilept a little, youmiay befure ; But fpent the mofl 
part of the n^ght in ferengtbening our fituation, and bgr- 
ricadoing the entrances into the wood; "and, keeping x 
ftridt watch, we waited for day-light, and, when it came, 
it gave us a very unwelcome difcovery indeed ; for the 
enemy, who we thought were difcouragcd with the 
Jrcccption they had met with, were now xncrcafed if 
no lefs than three hundred, and had fet up eleven or 
twelve huts and tents, as if they were relolved to befiegc* 
us ; and this little camp they had pithed, was upon the 
0|>en plain, at about three quarters of a mile from us^ 
We were, indeed, furprifed at this difcovery ; and now^j. 
I confeft, r gave^my felf over for loft, and all that I had. 
The-lofb^tjf my effe6fe did not lie fo near me (thouglr 
they were very confiderable) as the thoughts, of falling 
into the hands of Aich barbarians, at the latter end of 
my journey, after To many difficulties and hazards as 
rhad gone through; and even in fight of our port, 
•where * we lexpedtedfafety. and deliverance. As for my 
partner, he was-, risking ; he declared, that to bfc 
his goods would 'be msVtiin; and he would rather 
die than be llarved ; and he was for fighting to the lalV 
drop* -['• 

•The young Lord, as- gallant a» ever fleffi (hewed it- 
felf, was for fighting to the laft- ialfo ; and my pilot was 
of the opiniow we were able to refift them allj in the* 
fituation we then were in ; and thus we fpent the day 
in debates of what We fiiould do ; but, towards evening, 
we found thait the nunfibfer of our- enemies ftill encreafed: 
perhaps^ '&s they were abrdaxi in federal parties fbr prey, 
tht firft 'had* ftnt out fc6uts to call for help, and to 
acdiift'^^ them of ^hdr booty ;. and we did not know but* 
b^ the morning they might dill be a gi eater number; 



ADVENTURES OT ROBINSON CRUSOX. t?^ 

fo I began to enquire of thoft people we had brought 
from Tobolfki, if there was no other, or more private 
ways, by which wt might avoid them in the night, and 
perhaps either retreat to fome town, or get help to guard 
«s over the defert. 

The Siberian, who was fervant to theyounsc Lord, told 
Bs, if wedefigned to avoid them,, and not fight, he would 
engage to carry us off in the night to a way that went 
nprth towards the river Petraz^ by which he made no 
doubt but we might get away, and the Tartars never the 
wifer ; but he faid, his Lord had told him he would not 
return, he would rather ehu.fe to fight. I to^d* htm, he 
miftooU his Lord ; for that he was too wife a m«in to lovc 
fighting for the fake of it ; that I knew his Lord was 
brave enough by what he had (hewed already ; b<»t^hat 
his Lord knew better, than to defire to have leventeen or 
eighteen mea fight five hundred, wnlefe an unavoidable 
aeceflity forced them to it; and that iNie thought it pof- 
fiWefor us to efcape in the night, we had nothing elfe to 
do but to attempt it. He anfwered, if his. Lord g^^fc 
hinsi fuch order, he would lofe his life if he did oot per- 
form it. We foon brought his Lord to give that order, 
though, privately,, and we immediately prepared for the 
putting it in practice. 

And firll, as foo^ as it began to be dark, we kindled 
a fire in our little camp, which we kept burning, and 
prepared fo as to make it bnrn all night, tbat the Tar- 
tars might coBclude we were dill there ; but, as foon as 
it was dark,, that is to fay, fo as ^ye could fee the Ibars, 
(for our guide would not flir before) having all our 
horfes and camels ready loaden, we followed our new 
guide, who, I ibon found, (leered himjelf by the pole, 
o)c north ilar, all the country being: level tor a long 
way. 

After we had travelled two hours very bard, it began 
to be^lighter dill, not t^at it was quite %dark atl night, 
biii the moon began to rife, fdr that, in (hort,. it was- 
rather lighter than we wilhed it to be ; but by (ix o'clock 
next morning wc were gotten near forty rtjles, though 
the t^uth is, we almoft (poiled pur horfes. Here wc:

day. . About two hours before night wc fet out agais, 
and travelled till eight the next morning, though not 
quite fo haftily as before ; and about fevcn o'clock wc 
pafled a little river, called Kirtxa, and came to a goad 
large to^n inhabited by Ruffians, and very populous, 
called Ozemys ; there we heard, that feveral troops or 
hords of Cal mucks had been abroad upon the defert, but 
that we were now completely out of danger of them, 
which was to our great fatisfa^lion, you may be fuw. 
Here we were obliged togctfome frc(h horfes, and, hav- 
ing need enough of reft, w^e iiaid five daj^s ; and my 
partner and 1 agreed to give the honell Siberian, who 
brought us thither, the value of ten. pifloles for his con- 
dudling us. 

In five days more we came to Veuflima, upon the 
river Witzogda, which running into the river Dwina, 
wc were there very happily near the end of our travels by 
land, that river being navigable in feveh days paffage to 
Archangel' :' from hence we came to Lawrenlkoy, where 
the river joins,, the third of July : and we provided ouf- 
felves with two luggage-boats, and a barge, for our con- 
venience: we embarked the leventh, and arrived all fafe 
at Afchangel the eighteenth, haA'ing been a year, five 
months, and three days, on the journey, including our 
ftay of eight months and odd days at lobolfki. 

We werd obliged to flay at this place fix weeks for the 
arrival of the fhips, and muft have tarried longer, had 
not a Hambiirgher come in above a month fooner than 
any of the Englifh fbips : when, after fome confideration, 
that the erty o£ Hamburgh might happen to be as good-a 
market for our goods as London, we all took freight with 
him: and having put our goods on board,, it was moil 
natural for me to put my llcward on board to take care of 
them : by wliich means my young Lord had a fufficicnt 
opportunity to conceal himfelfy never coming on (horc 
again, in all the time we (laid there ; and this he did, 
that he might not be feeain the city, where Ibrne of the 
Mofcow rnerchants would certainly have feen and dif- 
cov6red,him. 

' WeTailed from Archangel the twentieth of Auguft, the 
fame yearj and, after ho extraordinary bad voyage,, at- 
'tivcd in the Elbe, the r3th of September ; here my partnec

end I found a very good fale for our goods, as well thofc 
of China, as the fables, &c. of Siberia ; and dividing the 
produce of our effects, myihare amounted to 34751. 17s, 
3d. notvvithflan<ling lb many lofles we had fullained, and 
charges we had been at : only remembering that I had 
included, in this, about 6001. worth of diamonds, which 
I had purchafed at Bengal, 

Here the young Lord took his leave of us, tnd went 
up the Elbe, in order to go to the court of Vienna, where 
he refolved to feek protection, and where he could corre- 
spond with thofe of his father's friends who were left alive 
He did not part without all the tefti monies he could give 
of grat'itude for the fervice I had done him, and his fenfe 
of my kindnefs to the prince his father. 

To conclude, having (laid near four months in Ham- 
iurghy 1 came from thence, over land to the Hague, 
'where I embarked in the packet, and arrived in London 
the 10th of January, i705, having been gone from Eng- 
land ten years and nine months. 

And here, refolving to harrafs myfelf no more, I am 
preparing for a longer journey than all thefe, having lived 
72 years a life of infinite variety, and learned fulBciently 
to know the value of retirement, and ;thc blefling of
