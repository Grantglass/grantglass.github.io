LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

OF 

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

I Was born at York, in the year 1632, 
of a reputable family. , My father 
was a merchant, born at Bremen ; his 
original name was Krent&uzer, which 
for the fake of the Engliih pronouncia- 
tion, was afterwards changed into 
Crufoe. My mother's name was Rob- 
infon, a native of the county of York, 
and for particular reafons I am called 

obinfon, after her maiden name. 

There were three brothers of which 
I was the youngcft : the el deft was an 
officer, and killed in the wars in the 
Low Countries ; and the other I could 
never learn any thing of. My father 
intended me for the law, particular 
care wastaken of my education ; but 
all his pains and expence were to no 
purpofe ; my inclinations were bent 
another w ly : and nothing would ferve 
my turn, out at all hazards-, I muft. go- 
to lea. 



6 The Life and Adventures 

My father and mother were both v;-. 
olc-niiy again'!; ir, and nfed a thoufand 
arguments to diiluade me ; but it was 
si; to no purpofe ; my resolutions were 
{ f j firmly i'l-tiled, that neither the in 
trc-,:i. 5 of a rnoft tender father, a -r 
VO'AS and tears of a molt tender and 
lunate mother, could make any 

i on me. 

I was now about nineteen years of 
age, \vhcn iTicttinjv \vlih one of my 
fchrjo:-fe!lo\vj at H ! ;i, who was bound 
to London v/ich his father, who was 
iuafter of a fhip, I acquainted ^ini with 
iny resolutions ; he readily prcmifcd 
me I fhoukl have a free pafiage, aiul 
be provided with all other riecelTaries 
bte to tlie vt-.y -i^e ; and according- 
ly, without afking any manner of leave 
either of rny parents or friends, up>n 
the ilt of September 1651, I took fhip- 
pin;; tor London. 

Our ihip was hardly got clear of the 

H umber, but we were overtaken by a 

:t ft >rm ; and beiivr extremely 

;an to reflect upon my

of a middle (late of life, which he pro- 
poled to me, refolving, that if ever I 
mould be ib happy as to let my feet 
ag-.;in upon dry land, I would return to 
my parents, and beg- their pardon, and 
take my leave for ever of ail wander- 
ing inclinations, 

Thefe were my thoughts duiing the 
ftpnn ; but i hit was no iooner i>vc j r but 
my repentance vani filed with the dan- 
ger ; particularly, when my compani- 
on coming to me, tilked me if I v. as 
not a little frightened by the- iloim, 
which as he expreiHd it, \ a cap

I got very drunk, and r' 
m e r r e f o 1 u t i o n 3 a i d notions o i 
home vaniihed. I remained \ 
ed for feveral days, until I v. , 
by another accident, that had yery oear 
put a final end to my wandering rclb- 
hit ions. 

Upon the 6th of May we came to 
i' a r mouth Roads, where we 



Life and Adventures 
lay bound with feveral other veiTeu 
iruri; Newcaftle ; but there being fafe 
anchorage, and our fhip being tight, 
and our ropes good, the failors dilpif- 
ed til dangers, and were as merry in 
th.ir ftation as if they had been on 
ihove ; hut on the eighth day there 
arok Huh a ftrong gale of wind, that 
prever.r.eJ our riding up the river, 
whit! itill incieafing, our fhip rode 
fc: . v.ai~:e in, and fhipped ieveral large 
fcas. 

1 1 v, r s.s not long before a general 
horror ieiiied the leamen, and 1 heard 
tL after cry, ' Lord have mercy up- 
<?ii u l s. we (hail all be loft. For my 
part I kept iny cabin very fick^ till the 
<ii'. aduil apprcheniions of fudden death 
:nac!r me come upon the deck, and 
there I was moil terribly frighted. 

The tea ran mountains high, and 
nothing was to be expelled but una- 
voidable deftrudion. Two of the fhips 
liad -..: cady cut their mafts by the board 
two more had loft their a-nchors and 
were forced out to' the mercy of the 
'cnpeft, and we, to fave our lives, 



of Robinfon Crufoe. 9 

were forced to cut away both our fore- 
mail and main ma ft. 

The dorm continued extremely via- 
lent, and in ths middle of the night I 
couicl hear fome cry cut, Thar the 
> fhip fprung ci leak ! others that there 
were live feet water in the hold ! I was 
ready to give up the ghoft thro' fear, 
wliL-n on a Hidden all hands were called 
to the pump, and I among the reft. 

While we were all in this confufion 
and djflrefs, the mailer happened to 
fpy fomc light colliers, and fired a gun 
I was not tailor enough to know the 
meaning of the gun ; but I loon under- 
itood it was a token of our extreme 
danger, and I mil ft freely own, it is 
jmpodiblc for me to defcribc ihe ago- 
r/ies I laboured under. 

Happy it was for us, that in the 
flo nn they regarded our hgnal, and 
with a great deal of hu'/ai'd put out 
their loi:g boat, and by wonderful prc- 
vi'iL'p.ce f-jved our lives ; for with the 
oreatef; difiicuky we liad hardly got in- 
to the bixit, but we law our ill';

Pray, adds he, tell me truly upon what' 
motives you undertook the voyage ? 
Upon this I told him the whole ; at 
the end of which he broke out into the 
following exclamation : 

O ye eternal powers ! what great 
offence have I committed, that I fhould 
take fuch a delperate abandoned 
wretch into, my fliip, that has brought

1 made the beft of my way to Lon- 
don, being at all hazards, refclved 
on a voyage ; and being acquainted 
with the captain rf a (hip, I loon heard 
of r, voyage to the coaft of Guinea. 
}!-.-. yjr^ ;<>mc money, and appearing 
foiiiC what like a gentleman, I did not 
f.;o en board like a common iViilor, but 
S'uon got io far into/the captain's friend- 
ship, that he toKi me I fhould be his 
EKifmate, and fhould have full liber- 
ty to carry with me 'what merchandize 
I thought fit, and to diipofe cf it to 
Y/n advantage. 

I was wonderfully pleafed with this 
Idiid C'fier, and concluded that I had 
now an opportunity of making iwf for- 
tune ; and in order to my voyage, I 
ID n^y friends for Come money to

/ty pounds ; which I laid out in

vigation. And indeed by his afiiftancc 
and my own induftry, in tins voyage 
I became both a failor and a merchant. 
I managed my little (lock i'o well, that 
I brought over with me five pou-nds 
and nine ounces of old dull : which 

o 

produced at London near 300!. iler- 
ling. 

Scon after my return my good 
friend the captain died. Tho this was 
a very great grief to me, I refolved 
to go another vcyrge with his mate 
that had got the command of his {hip. 
7'his voyage proved a very unfuccels- 
ful one, I carried with me about one 
hundred pounds, and left the reft with 
the captain's widow, and i'o to leal 
went. But as \vc were failing tow- 
ards the Canary lilands, we were chaf- 
ed by a Sallee rover, who in fpite of 
all the fail we could n-:ake, in a ihort 
time came up with us, and now there 
was no remedy but light or to be ta- 
ken. 

They had eighteen uns mounted, 
and we but twelve. However, about 
three in the afternoon \ve caint- to an 



14 Life antl Adventures 

engagement: many were killed on 
both iides : but, at length, being over- 
powered by their numbers, we were 
forced to fubmir, and all carrried into 
Sallee. Our men were fent :j tbe 
Enipcrcr's court to be Add, but the 
captain of the pirate?, taking a parti- 
cular liking to me, kept me for his 
own flave. 

It was in this miferable condition 

my father's words came af re ill into my 

remembrance, and my thoughts were 

continually at work to make my elcape. 

My patron cntrufted me with the man- 

nent of his garden and hou(e ; and 

;d I was not without hopes, but at 

tin-it or other, an opportunity 

: ciTer ; the word of it was, ! had 

i;o m>r:?il to communicate my thoughts 

to, and for tv/o years I could find notl> 

acticable. 

In length of time, I found my pat- 
ron was grown fo poor, that he could 
not tit out his fhip as ufual ; and then 
he ufcd conilantiy once or twice in a 
week to go out iiihir.g, taking me and 
mu! a M'jriicj boy to row the !

and fo much pleafe'd was he with 1117 
dexterity in fi/hing, that he would of- 
ten fend me with a Moor, his kinfmau 
and a boy, to catch fii]i for hi in. 

One morning, ajriM* were at the

minds altered : however, my patron 
ordered us to go out and catch u difh 
of fifti ; for that he was rciolvcd his 
guefts fhould up with him. 

And-row itB|jyiat I began to think 
of my deliveralrcj^ jand in order to it, 
I purfu>adcd the Moor to get ioine pro- 
vifions on board, and alio fome pow- 
der and {hot to illoot curlews, which 
were very plentiful in thole parts. I 
took care to provide privately whate- 
ver elfe I could think was the mo ft ne- 
ccffary, for the prefent expedition, be* 
ingrefoved to make my cicspe, or pa- 
ridi in the attempt. 

When we were pad the ctiftle, WG 
fell t lifting, and flood further ii-to 
the fca ; ancl when we were got a: 
a league, I o-ave the boy the helm, 
a-nci leized Muiey by farprizc and threw 
iiim over-board, telling him I never 
deHgned him any harm, but that I mull: 
conluit the means of my own p refer va- 
tioJ! ; sd4i'ng, that if he ofllred to re- 
turj), I wii'Ll flioot him through the 
head ; upon winch he inftantly turned 
to Ihc IhorL-. 



of Robinfon Crufoe. 17 

The action frighted the poor boy 
exceedingly ; however, I foon eafed 
him of his fear, by telling him, if he 
-would be a good boy, and fwear by 
Mahomet, to ferve me faithfully, I 
would be very kind to him ; the poor 
child fcemed wonderfully pleafcd with 
my promife, and readily conferred, 
and from that time I began to love him 
extremely. 

We purfued our voyage, keeping 
ftill on the Barbary coaft ; but in the 
dufk of the evening I changed my 
courfe, fleering directly S. and by E. 
that we might be always near the fbore; 
and having a pleafant gale, 1 found 
the next day, by three in the after- 
noon, we were got 150 miles beyond 
the dominions of the Emperor of Mo- 
rocco ; yet ftill I was under the dread- 
ful apprenenlions of being retaken. 

I continued failing for live days to- 
gethcr, until I concluded, that if any 
veficl was in purfuit of me, I was got 
fo far to the fouthward, that they 
would not think proper to follow me 
ou further. 



1 8 Life and Adventures 

After all this fatigue,' I anchored hi 
the mouth of a little river, but where 
J knew not, neither could I fee any peo- 
ple to make a di&overy : what I chief- 
ly wanted was frcih water, which I 
I was rcfolved to go on fiiore and rind 
out fo loon as it grew dufkifh ; but no 
focner it began to grow dark, but v/e 
I card f-jch bowlings and yelihigs cf 
wild beads and mo afters, ihat I muft 
needs own I was exceedingly terrified. 
Poor XUR.Y pafliontely begged' of me 
not to go aihore that night. Tl:e boy 
had a great deal of wit, for which, to- 
gether with fomc litttle broken Englifh 
he had nicked ap, I \vas mightily de- 
lighted with him : neveriheiefs, the 
bowlings and bellowings were fo very 
dreadful, that we had but very little 
reft that night, and to add to our con- 
fufion, we. difcovered one of the mon- 
fttrs coming towards us ; upon which I 
took up one of the guns, and ihot at 
him ; whether I hit him or not I can- 
not fay, but he made towards the fhore

we took our arms and two jars for wa-

1 did not go out of fight of the boat 
for fear the favages froukl come down 
the river in their canoes, and take it 
away ; but the boy ice ing a yale a lit- 
.t-le further, ventured to it, and return- 
ing with precipitation, I thought he 
v/as cither purfued by the iavages, or 
fome wild beafts ; upon which I ran 
towards him, refolding either to per 5 111 
or preferve : but as lie Game-nearer to- 
wards me, I faw a creature hanging at 
hie back, like one of oar hares, but 
f&rric thing larger, v/hith proved to be 
vrry i:;oc;d and wholeibme meat ; and 
\vhut added moft to my fatisfaction the 
boy allured me there was plenty of ex- 
cellent water instil'" very creek where 
the boat lay. 



ID Life and Adventures 

In this place I began to confider th,at 
the Canary I Hands, and the Cape de 
Verd could not be far off ; but, having 
no inilrument. I knew not ifl what lati- 
tude \vu ere, or when to {land oiF to 
fea or them ; my hope were to meet 
Ibme of the Englifli trading v effete, 
that wonid confcqently take us in and 
deliver us. 

The place I was in, was, duubtlefs, 
tha< wild uninhabited that lies between 
the Emperor of Morocco's dominions 
and the negroes : abounds with wild 
beads of all forts, and the Moors keep 
it for a place of hunting. From this I 
thought I law Mount Teneriff in the 
Canaries, and tryed twice to fteer my 
courfc that way, but was as often dri- 
ven back, and compelled to fcek my 
fortune along the coafb. 

One morning very earley we came 
to anchor at a fmall point, and the tide 
beginning to flow, we were preparing 
to go further in : But ZURY, who it 
iccms law farther than I, defired me 
to keep out at lea, or we fliould be de- 
ed by monfters : for Look yonder,

Matter, fays he in his broken tone, and 
fee dat huge monftcr dat lies there a- 
fleep on the fide of the rock. He point- 
ed to the place, and I discovered a lion 
of prodegioua fize, bafking himielf un- 
der the {hade of a rock ; upon which I 
took my biggeft gun, and charging it 
very well, fhot at him, and broke one 
of his legs ; and then with a (hot from 
my fecoml gun I killed him. 

But the flefli of that favage creature 
not being good for food, I concluded 
this was Spending our ammunition to 
no purpofe. Indeed I thought the fkin, 
when it was dry, mjght be of fome fer- 
vice , and fo I determined to flezj, if off, 
which took us up a whole day to efFecl. 
From thence we went to the fouth- 
ward^ reiolying to live fparingly, upon 
our provifions, and to go on (liore ac

ing nearer to the boat, than I dtfired, 
I took one of the guns and let fly at 
him, and killed him. 

I cannot exprefs the confirmation of 
the poo-r Negroes, upon hearing the 
report of the gun, nor their furprife 
at feeing the creature flain by it. I 
made figns to them to draw it out of 
the water by a rope, which they ac- 
cordingly did, and then perceived it 
was a beautiful leopard, which made 
me defiruus of the- flcin : and the Ne- 
groes being no lefs defirous of the flefh, 
I freely gave it them ; as for the other, 
which waslikewife a leopard, it made 
back to the mountaius with prodigious 
fwiftnefs. 

The Negroes having furnifiied us 
with the bed provifions which the na- 
ture of their country and circumftan- 
ces would allow, I took my leave of 
therrij and in eleven days fail I came in

Portngueze, and, as I conjeftured, 
bound to Guinea for negroes, upon 
which I drove all that I could to come 
up with them ; but all my driving had 
been in vain, if they had not happened 
to fpy me, and fliortened iheir fails to 
ftop for me. 

Encouraged by this, I fet up my an- 
cient, and fired a gunOin token of dif- 
trefs, up@n which they kindly lay by, 
till I came up with them. It happened 
there was a Scotch Sailor on board, to 
who ii I made my cafe known, and then 
they took me into their fhip. 

You may well imagine my joy v/as 
exceeding great for this unexpected de- 
liverance, efpecially when I found the 
Captain of the fliip was very kind and 
compadionate to me ; to whom in re- 
turn for his friendfliip, I offered all I 
had, which he as generoufly refufed ?

and provide for your padage home to 
your native country; and indeed he ac- 
ted with -drift j uftice towards me in all 
refpetfs. 

He bought my boat of me, and gave 
me his note to pay me eighty pieces of 
eight for it, when we came to the Bra- 
zels. He gave me alfo flxty for my boy 
XUR.Y, whom I did not part with with- 
out fome relucrancy : however, the boy 
being willing, I agreed he fhould be ftt 
at liberty after ten years fervice. 

We arrived at the bay of A 11 -Saint?, 
after twenty-two days fail. The good 
man would not take any thing for my 
padiige. He gave me twenty ducats 
for the leopard fk'm, and forty for the 
lion's ; every thing he can fed to be de~ 
livered, and what I would fell he bought 
in fliort I made 220 pieces of my car- 
go, and with this little {lock I began 
as it were, to enter anew isto the world, 

He recommended me to an hoiiefl

ting and making fugar ; and obferving 
the great advantages of that bufmefs, I 
rcfolvcd to v;et the money I had left be- 
hind me in England remitted, and to 
buy a plantation. 

In fhort, I purchafed a plantation 
adjoining to that of an honeft Portu- 
gneze born of Englifh parents, whom 
upon all occafionsl found a very kind 
and ufefiil neighbour. Our flocks at 
fir it were both very low ; never thelefs 
by our induftry and care, in a fhort 
time we made confiderable improve- 
inents, and began to grow rich. And 
now it was I repented the lofs of my 
dear boy XUR.Y, having no mortal to 
a (lift me, nor no body to convcrfe with 
but my neighbour only. 

I was in fome meafure fettled before 
the Captain that, took me up left the 
Brafiis. One day T went to him. and 
told him what Hock I had left in Lon- 
don, and deiired his adiftance in get- 
ting a remittance, to which I he good 
gentleman replied, he would only have 
rue fend for half, left it fhould mifcar- 
3*y and, if it dic^ the reft would

ply me ; and fo t taking letters of pro- 
curation from me, he allured me he 
would ferve me with the utmoft of his 
power ; and in truth he kept his word 
with me, and was extremely kind to 
me upon all occalions* 

And now my wealth began to increafe 
apace ; and, even in this ftate I might 
have been happy enough, if my ambi- 
tion and roving inclination had not had 
too great a power over me. I had now 
lived four years in the Brafils, and had

we were overtaken by a violent ftorir^ 
which lafted twelve clays fucceflively ; 
when the weather cleared up we found 
ourfelves in eleven degrees of north-

Hungary, and yet had nothing to help 
me, not fo much as a weapon to de- 
fend me againil the wild heads. In 
fhort, I had nothing in the world but 
a knife, a fhort tobacco pipe, and a 
box half full of tobacco; and, what 
was worfe, night corning on, I was 
under the mod dreadful apprehenfions 
of being devoured by wild beafts, that 
1 heard howling and roaring about me ; 
fo rhat I had no profpecl, but to ex- 
pect another kind of death more terri- 
ble than that I had fo lately efcaped. 
I.i this dhlrcfsl walked about a furlong 
into the country, to feck f re 111 water, 
which ! luckily happened upon ; fo ta- 
k- ig a* tree, where I feat eel myfelf'fo

the right, where the waves had caft her 
up. 

I hoped to have got to the boat, but 
the water between that and the fhot-e 
rendered that impraclible ; ib that I 
returned again towards the fliip, in 
hopes to get ibmething from thenc e for 
my prefent fubfiftence. 

At all hazards I refolved to get to 
the /hip, and fo {tripping, leaded into 
the water, and fwimming around her, 
I had the good fortune to fpy a rope 
hanging fo low down, that 1 could 
reach it, by the help of which, with 
fome difficulty, I got into the fore-caf- 
tle. Here I found that the frrp was 
bulged, her head lifted up againfl a 
bank, and her (tern almofl in. the wa- 
ter ; all her quarter, and what was 
there, was free and dry ; and I 'found 
the provifions in good order, and wa nt- 
ed for nothing but a boat to carry what 
I had occafion for. 

Neceflity which is the mother of in- 
vention, put a profpecl: into my head. 
There was on board feveral fpare yards, 
a fpare top*maft or two, and three

large fpars of wood ; -with their I fell 
to work, flinging as many of theirv o- 
verboard as I could manage, and fied 
them together, that they might not 
drive away. When this was done, I 
tied them together in the fe.rm of a 
raft, and laid three- or four (hort piec- 
es of plank upon them . crofs ways. I 
found it would bear me, but a very lit- 
tle weight befidcs ' and fo to ftrength- 
en my raft, I cut a tTmaft into three 
or four length?, and added them to k, 
and then I confidered \vhat was mod 
proper to load with, it being then ca- 
pable to carry a tol'arabie weight. 

At fir ft I laid upon it all the boards 
I could get, and then J lowered down 
three of the fcarnens chefts, and filled 
them with provifious of all forts; I found 
cl-oth enough, but the" I took no more 
lhan my preient occafions required. 

My concern was chiefly upon tools 
to wurk with, and fire arms and ammu- 
nition ; and accordingly, I found in my 
fearch, the carpenter's chcft, and in the 
great cabin fome fire arn?f> and animu- 
rution; all which I put aboard my raft 



of RobinfoirCrufoe. 3$ 

and fo with two broken oars, &c. I put 
to lea. 

Though every thing at fir ft fceined 
to favour my defign : yet after I had 
failed ad.uit a mile, I found, on a fud- 
den, the fore part of my raft run a- 
ground, 10 that it was with the great-* 
eil difficulty i;n iginable I kept my car- 
go right together ; and indeed, it" I 
had not been extrcemly diligent and 
careful, ail had been loft, and funk in- 
to the fea ; but, after fome time, Pro- 
vidence fo ordered it, and by the ril- 
ing of the water, my raft floated a- 
gain, and fo I happily landed my ef- 
fecl. 

Not far from the place where I land- 
ed, which was at the mouth of a little 
cove, I difcovcrcd a very high hill fur- 
roundcil with a great many little ones, 
and thither I was reiblved to go and 
view the country, and fee what place 
was proper for me to fix my habitati- 
on in and accordingly, armed my- 
felf with a fowling-piece, and pifto!> 
and fbn:c- ammunition, I afcende-J the 
mountains to lee 5 and there I found I

was in an ifland furrounded by the fca; 

it feemed to be a barren uncultivated 

country, and only inhabited by wild 

beafts. 

Returning afterwards to my raft, I 
got my goods on fhore, and being ve- 
ry much afraid of the wild beads, I 
made fort of a fence or barricade about 
it, which I thought might in fome mea- 
fure, fecure me agamft the dangers 
that I was apprehend ve of ; and fo that 
night I dept very comfortably ; and 
next morning, when I awaked, refolv- 
cd.to again to the (hip to get fuch fur- 
ther necedaries, as I had mod occadon 
for, before another dorm came, when 
I knew die mud be dafhed to pieces. 

In order to this fecond expedition, I 
mended my raft, where I found it de- 
fective, and brought away from the fliip 
a great many other tools, clothes am- 
munition, and whatever elfe I thought 
mod neccflaiy for my future prefcrva-

picked up every thing I could, I made

and contrived it in the following man- 
ner. 

I confulcred the ground where I was, 
w.13 moor (h, a-:ii that I had no con- 
venience of frelh water ; and there- 
fore I determined to find out a place 
more healthful and convenient ; and, 
to my great comfort and fatlsfafHon, 
I foon found ojie that anfwered my ex- 
peel at ion. * 
The place was a little plain, near a 
hill ; the front behi o; as deep as 
Isdc of a hoi:ie : on the fide of this 
rock was a liitlc hollow place refem- 
blinw; the entrance cf a cavr : juft be- 
forr this place I- refolved my tent iliould 
(\.ind. This plain \rasa hundred yards 
broad, and twice as long, with a p'ea- 
ip.nt dclcent every way to the ira Tide, 
r this I drew a ferni- circle, cor- 
t\vo yards in the diame- 
ttr j and v. l.cii ti-?t was done, I drove 
ai'-.iwoi ftalccj not above T:>. ir-'jl-cs- 



from each other ; and, by the help of , 
my cables which I had brought from 
ihe {hip, and iuch ether materials I 
made ufe of, I made a fort of regular 
fortification, which I concluded was in 
a great meaiL-rc impregnable, againfl 
av.y Hidden atien.'pts cisfner of favages 
or wild bcafis : and, MI itfty better fe- 
cur'ty,- I 9 :crs, but

Into this iittle garrifun 1 carried all 
my ft ores and amiiiunition, and after- 
wards continued to work ;, I not only 
made me a little cellar, but Iike\vife 
made my fortification urongcr by the 
earth and (tones I dug out of the reck.

To the 1 4th of this month I ipent in 
making voy^^cs backwards and for- 
werds, to and from the fbip, the wea- 
ther being all the while wet and un- 
certain. 

Ocl. io. My raft with rry goods \vas

recovered at low water. 

Ocl, 25. It blew a fort of dorm, & 
rained hard, fo that the ihip .was da (li- 
ed to pieces, and nothing of her was 
to be feen but the very hulk at low wa-

to fee ure the effects I had preferved 
from the weather. 

Ocl 26 I wandered about to try if 
I could find a place proper to fix my 
^bode : and accordingly, towards the 
evening, I found out a rock, where I 
might ered a wall, and fortify tnyfelf. 

November id, I placed my tent by 
the fide of a rock, and took up my 
lodging in .a hammock, very content- 
edly for that niglit. 

Nov. 2. I made a fence about my 
tent with timber, chefls and boards. 

Nov. 3. I ihot two wild fowls, which

it came into my mind, that I had fliakca 
the bag in the very fpot where thefe

It was about the latter end of June

to walk out with my gun, but found 
myfelf too weak, and ib returned to

a reprobate, for faying in my agonic*,

The wet weather was no iboner

The firft thing ! attempted, was to 
make a baflcet, which after much la- 
bor an*l difficulty, 1 efFecltd ; but the 
two things! mod wanted were cn.ire- 
ly out of my powe , viz. fomc calks to 
hold my liquors, and fmall pots to boil 
and (lev/ my meat, and alfo a tobacco 
pipe, for which 1 at lad found out a 
remedy. 

After the weather grew fair, my re- 
folution of further viewing the whole 
ifland took place j and accordingly, 
taking my dog and gun, andother ne- 
celTaries proper, I i'et forward, aiv-1 
having pafled the vale where the bow-

lying to the W. and when it was a clear 
day, I could difcover land, but could 
not tell whether it was an iiknd, or the 
continent ; neither could I tell what 
place this might be ; only I thought it 
was America, and cosfequently thct 
part of the country that lies between 
the Spaniili territories and the Brail i?, 
which abounds with cannll\'J,> v;l:c> de- 
vour human kind*

In viewing this part of the ifland, I 
found hwas much more pleafaat and 
fruitful than where I kad pitched my 
tent. Here were great numbers of 
parrots, and with great difficulty I got 
one of them, !which I carried home 
with me, but it was a great while be- 
fore I could tauic it and bring it to 
fpcak, even fo much as to call me by 
my name. 

In the low grounds I found great 
numbers of hares and foxes, and abun- 
dance of fowls of different kinds, with 
great quantities of grapes and other 
excellent fruit. In this expedition I 
did not travel above two miles a day, 
being dcfirotis to make what difcove- 
ries I could ; and uhen I came to the 
fea fliore, I was amazed to ice it fo ex- 
ceedingly beautiful, an-! fo full of ex- 
cellent fifh ; but tho this journey I mud 
confefs was very delightful to me, yet 
flill my fecrct inclination led me to my 
Id habitation : fo that after I had fet 
up a fort of a land mark for my guide 
iti future, I konchuled t return back 
D

by a different way than that I came; 
and as I was making the befi: of my 
way, my dog happened to furprife a 
kid, which I rcfctied from him, and 
led home in order to try if 1 could 
raife a breed, which I was fatisned 
would be of fomc uie to me. 

After I had been about a month on 
this expedition, I returned to my lit- 
tle caftle, and repofed myfelf with 
great pleafure in my hammock, and 
indeed continued a week within, to 
reft and rcfrefli myfelf ; and now I 
began to think of the kid 1 had left be- 
hind me in the bower, and refolved 
immediately to fetch it home. When 
I came there I found it almoft ftarved, 
I gave it fome meat, poor creature, 
and in gratitude for its deliverance, it 
followed me, as naturally as my clop-, 
quite home to my caftle, which after- 
wards kept as one of my clor.icf:" 

The wet feafon be'.n^ come, I kept 
nr/feif within ; and, upon the aoth of 
of September, it being the third year of 
my abode on the illand, I paid my fr 
leinn acknowledgments tu Alnv^Liy 



or ivouiiiiolj L/iuiGC, 03 

Cod for my prefervation, and entered 
ii^yfelf with a world of reflections upon 
my prcfent and former condition. And 
as I was one morning fadly poundering 
on my prefsnt flate, I happened to op- 
en my Bible, when the following words 
immediately occured, I will never leave 
thee, nor for fake thee, which I pre^ 
fently took as directed to myfelf, and 
rnuft own the exprefiion gave me a greac 
deal of fecret fatisfaclion. 

The beginning of this year I fixed my 
daily employments as follow ; the morn- 
ing I f ieut r.:y devotions, and paying 
my duty to God ; after T had done that* 
I went out with my gun to feek provi- 
fions : which after I had got, took up 
fome time in drelling and cooking. In 
the middle of the day, T was forced to 
lye by, by reafon of the c^clufivc heats, 
and the reft of the time I fpent in mak- 
ing and contriving fuch ncceflaries as I 
ftood mod in need of. 

But now the time of my little harv- 
cfl coming on I had the defircd prof- 
pec^ of a good crop, but my hopes 
were fadly difappoiated by the goats 



64 Life and Adventures 

and harej. who have tailed the fweet- 
neis of my corn, had cropped it fo clofe, 
that it had not flrength to flaoot up in- 
to a floc|c ; to prevent this I was fore* 
cd to make an hedge round it ; but I 
had nofooner done this, but I was in- 
feftei with vermin of another ipecies. 
My back was no fooiier turn' ,!, but 
whole flocks of birds came ana 'Jcilroy- 
cd what the others had left ; I let fly 
upon thefe, and killed three of them, 
-which I hung up as a terror to the reft, 
upon flakes, that they not only forfook 
the corn, but that part oi the illand for 
e?er afterwards. 

My corn growing ripe, and harvefl 
coming on, I cut it down and carried 
hcmie the ears ; and after I had rubbed 
tnt m- and thrafhed tbem in the beft. 
manner 1 could, I conjectured the pro- 
duce of the barley was about two bufh- 
els and a half, and that of the rice 
much about the fame quantity,- And 
now I plainly law, by the providence 
ot God, I fliov.ld be fupplied with corn, 
though at the lame time, I wanted all 
manner of ncceiTarks for making in in- 



of Robinfon Crufoe. 6$ 

to bread, which, with the greatcfl la- 
bour and difficulty, I afterwards fuppli* 
ed. 

My feed being thus increafcd, my 
fj ext care was to prepare more land to 
fow in; and accordingly, I irxed upon 
two large plats upon the back fide of my 
caftle, which I prepared with great 
pains, and put it into the ground, and 
after made a hedge round it, to defend 
it from vermin. 

In fliort, my corn incrcafed tt> that 
degree, that I thought I might now 
venture to eat fome of it ; but how to 
make it into bread, was (till the diffi- 
culty ; and yet even this found means 
to fur mount at lad, and fo as in all o- 
tl'cr emergencies, I found a remedy 
beyond my expectation. 

After 1 had procured every thing 
needful fur making my bread, which 
you may imagine was cu filial) ikiisfac-

and here I could not forbear re flccling 
upon the folly of thofe that undertake 
jnattcrs they are not able to go through 
with* 

I was in the midft of wy projects, 
when my fourth year expired ilnce I 
liad been caft on the ifland ; nor did I 
forget to keep my annivtrfary with that 
folemnity and deVution as I had done 
the year before : I began to think my* 
i'eif Jeperated from the world, and from 
all opportunities of human converfa- 
tion : i now had nothing tu covet, be- 
ing, as it were, an emperor, or king 
ct a whole country, where I had nobody 
to controul me, nor nobody to govern 
but myfelf. 

Thefe thoughts made me look upon 
the things of this world with a fort of 
a religious contempt, and rendered 
me eaiy in n,y defohue and melancholy 
condition ; for iiaving made C. : ncl ? s mer- 
cies to me mat UTS of the higheit con- 
folat on, I rtiinquiihtd all pi 
thcM^his. and clii:r.ai rppr-

find refigned myfdf up entirely to Gods 
providence. 

My ink was quite gone, and m/ 
bifcuit almoft exhauiied ; my linen 
was worn out, only fome pf the failors 
chcquer'd fliirts remained, which were 
of mighty uie to me in the hot weather. 
My cioaths and hat were quite worn, 
but thofe I fupplied by the help of my 
goat Ikin, of v/hich I firft made a fort 
of cap, and then a waiitcoat,a;id open 
knee'd breeches, with the hc'ir on the 
outiide : and thus being pericciiy at 
^afe in my mhul, I fpent my time in 
contemplating the mercies cf heaven, 
and was raviihcd to think that at one 
time or other I fhould be delivered from 
my prefent misfortunes, and placed out 
of rhe reach of them for ever. 

For live years after this, nothing 
'frorth mentioning happened, only at 
fpare time?, I had iinimed a fmull ca- 
Boe, with which, at all hazards, I r<- 
folved to try to diicover the circumfe- 
rence of my dominions ; and in order

ammunition, and all other neccelTaries 
lit for the expedition. 

It was on the i6th of November, in 
the 9th year uf my reign, that I began 
this voyage; which was much longer 
than I expected, by reef jn I had many 
difficulties to encounter I did not iui- 
pcft ; and, indeed, the rocks were fo 
high, and ran fo far into the fca, that 
I often refolved to turn lack, rather 
than run the rifle of being driven fo'far 
out to lea that I could by no means get 
back again. 

In this confufion, I came to anchor as 
rear to the fhoreas poffible : to which 
I waded, and clambeiing up to the top 
of an high hill, I viewed the extent of 
my dominions, anJ at all hazards refol- 
ved to pur fue my voyage. It is eiidlcfs 
to relate what dangers my raflincfs rx* 
pofcd me to : I was diiven by the cur- 
rent fo far into the fea, that I had hard- 
ly any profped to gel back again ; not 
by all I could do with my paddles, which 
1 had made to tupply the place of fculls

vifions were fpcnt, or, if a ftorm ffirfiild 
arifc, before. However, by the lucky 
change of the wind, or rather, by the 
particular providence of God, I was 
driven back again to the iflancl, and, 
to my unfpcakable joy, I came to ihore 
where, being exceedingly fatigued with 
watching and hard labour, I laid me 
down and took a little repofe. After 
I awaked and had drclfed myfelf as u- 
fual, I laid up my boat in a fmall con- 
venient creek fit for that pwrpofe, and 
taking my gun, &c. I made the beft of 
\ny way towards my bower, and again 
I laid me down to reft , but it was not 
long before I was greatly lurprized & 
frightened with a voice, which called, 
" Robin Crufoe, poor Robin Crufoe, 
where have you been, poor Robin Cru- 
foel" Upon which I ftarted up in a great 
confufion ; and calling my eyes around 
1 faw my parrot fitting upon the hedge, 
3nd then 1 knew it was flic that called 
to me, but was ftrangely furpmed how 
the creature could come there, And 
why it fliould fix upon that place above 
the reft : the bird came to me as fotm 



7o Life and Adventures 

as 1 called it, and it perched on my 
thumb as uiual, and feemed to figniiy 
a great deal of joy for my return. 

This voyage had cured me of a great 
deal of my rambling inclination ; iafc- 
xnuch that I began to lay aiide all hopes 
of deliverance ; fo I led a retired life, 
and in a very contented manner palled 
s. way near twelve months, Spending my 
time in making inflrornents, and do* 
ing fuch things as I found were ahfo- 
luieiy neceflary. both for my prefent 
and future fubiiftence. 

My next confederation was, my pow- 
der growing fhort, what I fboald do 
to kill the goats and fowl to live upon. 
I had abundance of contrivances in my 
head to try to catch the goats alive, 
particularly the ihe goats with young ; 
and at length ! found my de.Gre : for 
making pitfalls, and bating them with 
fome of rny corn, one morning I found 
in one of them an old he goat, and in 
the other three yonng ones, vii:. a male 
and two fe-males ; the old one was too 
drong for me, and I could not tell how 
to mafter him, but the young ones 1

nindc fiiiftto get home to my cave ; 
it was foms time before i could maker 
them feed, but after they had lome 
time been kept without food, 1 threw 
them fomefrefh corn, and gave them 
fbme water, their ftomachs came to 
them : and now my next care was to 
ff cure them fo that they might not run 
away: all which, with abundance o 
pains and difficulty, 1 at lafl effe&ecJ, 
and withal, by my good ufage ofthele 
poor creatures, I had made them f6 
tame and familiar, that they would 
follow.me, and eat my corn out of my 
hand : this having anlVered my ends 
to all intents and purpofes, I think in 
about a year and a halfs time I had got 
a good (lock of about twelve, and in 
lei's than two years forty three ; and 
now 1 was'not only well provided with 
goats fie 111, but with milk too, 'which 
iv as another blefllng i had little reaibit 
to expect. 

Beinp* thus happy, and having anrsoft 
forgot all hopes of liberty, I lived as 
xvell as the nature of my condition could 
allow ; and indeed, it wss a* 



72 . Life and Adventures 
very diverting fight to fee me fet in 
ftate at my dinner, all alone by myfelf, 
like a king ; and it would have been a 
very pleafant objecl to have fccn me 
in my goat fkin drcfs, and other habili- 
ments. 

My chief concern was now about 
my coat, which 1 was extremely unwil- 
ling to lofe, having coft rue fo much 
hard labour. 1 went by land to the 
place where 1 left it, but found there 
was no way to bring It off, without 
running the fame riik 1 was lately expo- 
fed to, which 1 thought too dangeroug 
for a fecond experiment ; and there- 
fore 1 refolved upon another expedient 
which was to make another canoe, and 
leave it on the other fide cf the iiland. 

And here 1 think it may not be im- 
proper to inform the reader, that 1 had 
two plantations in the iiland : the firfi: 
was my little fort or caftle, where 1 
hud made feveral improvements ; and 
my fecond was my bower, or country 
feat, where my grapes, and the enclc- 
fiircsfur my go ate s and feveral other-, 



of Robinfon Crufoc, 73 

conveniences, made it a very pleafant 
and agreeable retirement. 

From this pi-cc ir was that 1 ufed 
to go often to view my boar ; and now* 
I iball relate a thing that gave me the* 
moil difquiet of tuiy thing I had ever 
met with, ilnce my firft eominr i nta 
the iiland. 

It may be well fuppofed, that af.cr; 
lhad been fo long in'this delate pa'C 
cfth:: worU, nothing couid have been 
more furprizing than to have fecn any 
hnman creature ; but one day, as ! wag 
going to my boat as U{\M!, 1 perceived 
on the fand tine print of man* naked 
fo-ot , andhadlfeen an apparUion, I 
could net have been mor, terrifi^. 
looKed round me on all fide*, but could 
not hear or fee any thing: I t >M%rv,J 
the trampling and was convinced 
from all tne % ns , that iome foot had 
been there, a nd in the decned eo^ru. 

^n, I returned back to my habitation. 
That night 1 never tlofed my f y cl 

and was fmi O f the mod chfnial nrp.'e- 
lL ,ri was ever in, in all ny 



life. Sometimes 1 had the vanity to 
think it muft be the devil : at other 
tim.es I thought it rather fome favage, 
that the current had driven in, and not 
liking the place, was fecretiy g.one off 
to lea, again. Happy was 1 in the 
thought that none of the Ravages had 
feen me, and yet, at the fame time I 
was exceedingly terrified left they 
ihould hcife feen my Doat, and ib come 1 
in great numbers, and find me out, & 
devour me and all my little ftock, that 
I liad been ib long a gathering. Tuefe 
thoughts afHicled me extremely, and 
yet ? after mature confideration, 1 con- 
cluded it \vas my bed way to throw 
rnyfelf upon the tbverciga Governor of 
the \yorU, .and to fubmh entirely to his 
Kictcy uiid providence. 

After a world of fears and apprchen*

If I could deftroy f ine oftlufc lavages. 
and fave a victim mat 1 n;I^ht after-

1 mads hade out, efctrcmel'y terrified,

law a more beautiful fight, the walls 
and the roof reflected a thoufand lights

itemed to be the in oft delight lul grorto

find no fault but in the entrance, and 
Jhat 1 thought to render more proper 
for my defence and fecurity, and ther<- 
fcre I determined to make this place 
my principal magaz're, and accor- 
dingly, I brought hither, ioine arms

ther ; and at the fame time had fome 
notions to go over to their fide to ice 
what difcoveries I conld make. 

I had no notions, that if by any me- 
thod I could get upon the continent, I 
might in time meet with a fhip to car- 
ry aie to Eur'ope, for here I looked u- 
pon myfslf to be the moft miieraUe 
man living, and prefered even de&h 
itielf to my Ray in this defolate ifland. 
\Vhilft my thoughts were thus in con- 
fuiion, I had no notion of any thing 
but my voyage to the continent ; & in- 
deed io much was I inflamed A\ith thefe. 
new notions, that I, in a great mea- 
fure, forgot my duty to God and was 
alaioft to a ftatc of defperation; & after 
many thot's and flrugglinga in my mind 
I cawie at length, to this conclufion, 
viz. that the only probable way to ef- 
cape, was to get one of thefc lavages, 
which I could find no other way to 
bring about, than by venturing my life 
to deliver him out of the jaws of thefe 
devourers : which 1 thought muft in-

Thefe were my fixt refolutions ; but 
I think it wasatleaft a year and a half 
before I could find an opportunity of 
putting them in execution. To the 
be ft of my remembrance, it was the 
third d.ijr of April, early in the morn- 
ing, r/hcn I was furprued with the 
fight of five^canoes all upon the fliore 
together, 0:1 my fide of the iiland, and 
the creatures that belonged to them, 
all landed, and out of fight. 

At fir ft, I thought all thefe boats 
muft bring too many to be attacked by 
a fingle pcrfon, and was in a mighty 
confuilon what was befc to be done 
however, being impatient to fee fomc- 
thing of their raanngement, I tock my 
gua ! , and went fccretly to the top of 
the hill, where by the help of my per- 
fpecYive glafs, I obferved no icfs than 
30 ikting round a lire, and feafting

that my endeavours to inftruft him 
were a great help to myfelf, and 
brought thc.fe things, frelli into my 
memory, which the length of time had 
almoft effaced : ib that I had the 
gre ate ft. re a ion to bid's providence for .

thoughts of my miicry, and made imy 
habitation more comfortable than it 
had been ever iir.cc my fir ft coming to 
the illanil. It brought into my mind 
daily notions of heaven and heavenly 
things, and filled me with a iecret joy 
that I was ever brought to this place, 
which once I thought the moll mifera- 
ble part of the univerfe. 

By talc time, Friday began to fpeak 
tolerable Englifh. i We couvcried with 
great familiarity, and 1 took a partio 
tilar pleafurc to reiats to him the, icve- 
rai accidents and adventures of my life. 
I loon made him underftand the won-

the gun powder and ball, and taught 
him to flioof, which he foon learned

to the Sreateft perfection I gave him 
a knife which -he was very proud of ^ 
likewiie a belt and a hatchet, which 
he hung to his girdle, which, with the 
reft of his accoutrements, made him 
look like Don Quixote, when he went 
to engage the windmills. After this 
I gave him a particular defcription of 
Europe. I alfo gave him a large ac- 
c unt of my being fnipwrecked, and 
(hewed him the ruins of the fhips boat 
which tho* it was alinoft rotten and 
fallen to pieces, yet I could perceive 
he look particular notice of it," which 
made me afk the rcafon why he pon- 
dered fo much upon it ? To which he 
replied, 'Me fee a boat like this corns 
to a p'lace in my nation/' And by the 
further tokens he gave me, I came to 
under Hand, that the boat wa3 driven ia 
by a dorm. It preiently came into 
my mind that this mud be fame Euro- 
pean boat that was forced in there by 
ftrefs of weather, after the loitofthe 
flii^3 ; which put me ;pon an enquiry, 
what fort of a boat this was, and -v: a 
cam* with it ? he told me they <wrc

rather than be devoured in the ocean, 
had committed themfelves to provid-

vages, made me afk Friday fevfral o-

told me he was very certain they flill 
lived tl)ci*e, ar.d were well treated, I 
alked him how it came to pals that 
they did not kill them and eat them. 
as they do one another ? His aui'w^f 
was in broken Englim, < That they 
made friends with them.' He further 
added, 'That neither this nation, nor

Some time niter this, my man and I 
went up to the top of a very high hill 
on the caft iile of the ifiand, from 
whence I had once feen the continent 
of America : I could not immediately 
tell \vhat\\as the matter, for Friday 
on a fiidden fell to dancing & jumping', 
as he lia bten mad, I afked him the 
reafon of his joy : ' O, fays he, I fee 
my country, and the very place where 
the white men live together/' Upon 
which T couid not help thinking, but 
that if he could by any means get home, 
lie would forget all I had done for him, 
nnd perhaps bring his countrymen into 
my iHand to dcitey 'me : but to r/.y 
ilia me I fpeak it, my jcalonly v\-as ve- 
ry ill grounded : and us I found after* 
yards, would freely have loll his life, 
rath?r than have left me, cr done me

fny is out of my power : I am nut able 
to rmlve them what you mention, nor 
will I venture my It if among them ; no, 
you fhall go your felt;, and leave me a-

In fliort, the fellows bone fly and 
fiflCjere behaviour, focn convinced me 
of the unrtafonabicncfs of my jealouiy, 
and Friday became more dear to :ne 
than ever. _ Indeed I thought, 
that if ever I could get to th-a contin- 
ent, and join thofe white men Friday 
had mentioned, it might be a mean? 
to further my return into my native 
country. 

In order to this Friday and I went 
into the woods to look out a la: ,A tre? 
fo build a canoe ; which with much 
duiculry, we effected in about 6 weeks 
time, and with much trouble and pains 
got her into ih" water. I was very 
much rejoiced at launching this little 
nan of war which Ericlay managed 
with great dexterity, and afuired me 
it was in all points large enough to 
carry us over, and that if I thought 
proper, he was ready to venture with 
me. 

1 liked the poor fellow's honefl: pro- 
polai, but at the fame time I thought 
if I couiil frocurs a mrJt and a. fail, is

wonld be b.etter ; which with the great- 
ft difficulty imaginable, in about 3 
months time, I made a fhift to patch 
together ; and, after that too, I had 
my man Friday to inftruft in^the art of 
navigation which before he had not tire 
lead notion of. 

I was now entered on the twenty- 
fcvcnth year of my i*eign, or rather 
of my captivity, and kept the anniver- 
fitry of my landing with greater fol-em- 
nity than ever, having received fuch 
repeated fignals of divine favour in my 
deliverance, prefervation and profpe- 
rity, 

I now wanted for nothing, and yet 
my mind was flill intent upon my de- 
liverance ; and in truth, I had a 
{IroDg impreflion upon me, that lOiould 
not be another year in the illand : yet 
I flill continued my hulbandry, and 
made the necefTary preparations for my 
future iubiiftencc. The rainy feafon 
coming on, \ve were forced to continue 
for the mod part within dours, having 
fir ft made all nccefiary preparations 
for the iecurity and fafety of my new 



106 Life and Adventures 

boat, till the months of November aw! 
December, at which time I was fully 
determined to faii over to the conti- 
nent : and no fooner did it begin to 
draw near, but I began to make pre- 
parations for my inttnded expedition ; 
and, in a fortnight's time, ! propofed 
to open my little dock, and let out 
the boat for that parpofe. 

One morning, as I was biify in wa- 
'Icing preparation.! for my voyage. Fri- 
day, whom I had fsnt to the feaiide to 
lock for a turtle, came running in a 
terrible fVtr-ht ; fays he, " I have bad 
*nevs, yonder is three or four canoes 
'upon the coaft : aid they come to look 
for poor Friday, and will eat me as 
well as you : and therefore we niiiil 
refolve to fight for our liver. Says 
Friday, trembling-, Me- will fight as 
veil as I can, but I am ifrnid they are 
too many in number for us ; but I will 
cbcy your orders, and lofc the iaft drop 
or my blood for you," 

Without farther dilputes, we fell to 
loading our arms, and making every 
thing read/ for the onfet ; when we 



of Ro bill foil Crufoc. 107 

had double loaded them, and put eve- 
ry thing in the belt poftare that could 
be, I took my perfptclivs glafs, and 
went up to the top of a hill to try what 
I could dill-over : and I foon perceiv-, 
cd there were \$ favagfss and three 
prifoners, \vhich I concluded by their 
manner of acting were to be devour- 
ed. 

The difmnl and inhuman fpeclncis 
filled me with the utmoft horror and 
d etc: nation, and more fo, bccaufe I 
faw a white man, which by their ac- 
tions and preparations, I found was to> 
be l lie nezt facrifice : this made met 
make all tlie fpeed I could, being fully 
determined to deliver him or perifli in 
the attempt : and jb-Igavc Friday or- 
ders to follow, and to do every thm< 
t h a t h e fa \v m e d o . W h e n we c a in e 
to a proper diilance, undiicovered, I

However not to give them any rei-

curfelves to them, & at the fame time 
giving a great fhout, we went imme-

the bands frora off his hands and legs, 
and lifting him up, I afked him in the

t % 5111 of February the wind preicnt" 
cd, and we had a very good gale ior_ 
feveraldays. On the 20 th in the eve- 
ning, the mate called out that be faw 
a flalh of fire, aucl heard a gun, upon 
ii we all rti:: to the quarter ilcc.k-, 
f re; 111 whence, at a tliftance, \ve iaw a 
terrible fire, which from our reckon- 
ing, we concluded could be no other 
than a ihip that Iv.icl iakenfire at Tea, 
and that it could net he far off, by the 
report of the guns, which we heard 
feveral times. We made to it with all 
our fail, and foon perceived it was a 
great fhip burning in the mitUlof the 
fea ; I immediately ordered five- guns 
to be fired, that the poor people might 
perceive tnat there was deliverance at 
hand, who confeqneutly- might endan- 
ger their lives in their boats, nor was 
it long before the (hip blew up. 

We hung out our lanthorns, and r- 
bout eight in the morning when it be- 
gan to be light, we (aw two boats ma- 
king towards us, fo we made a fignnl 
to them to come on board, and took

u'ren, in all fiKty four. We found it 
was a French ihip of 400 tons, coming 
from Canada, and that by the negli- 
gence of the ficerfman, it was fet on 
fire in the llerrage : and that in all 
probability, if providence had not fent 
us to their affiftaoce, they had every 
foul perifhcd. 

Never people certainly was fo over- 
joyed as thefe poor wretches were. 
Among the prffengers, there were two 
pricth, an p1d one, and a young one : 
the old one wa-i a ftv.pid old fellow, 
but the young one was a very mcdeft 
gentleman. After their furprtfc was 
pretty well o*r, and they had been 
re frc ilied in tke belt m '.inner our fhip 
would allow, the next morning the 
captain and one of the prieils dcfired 
dcilred to fpeak with me, and offered 
us tk: money and jewels they had la- 
ved, which I refute 1, telling them, 
our bufmefi was to fave them not to 
plunder them: they told us, thit then, 
all that they had to define of ns, was 
to fet them on lliore fcm; where in our 
^As to l4ndin^, we told them

that being bound to the Eall Indie?, 
*ve could not do that, v/itliout chang- 
ing our courfe, and that we could not 
juilify, but we would carry them till 
we met with Come (hip bound either to 
England or France, that would taks 
them on board ; however, our provi- 
fions beginning to fail (hort, we re- 
iolved to lard them at Newfoundland, 
which was not much out of our way : 
and accordingly as we proposed, in a- 
bout a week's time, we crime to the 
banks ot Newfoundland, where they 
hired a bark to carry them to France, 
all but the young prieft, who chofe to 
go with us, and two or three of the 
-Jailors. 

Now, directing our coTrfe to the 
S.S.E. about twenty days after, wa 
met with another adventure that gave 
..013 a frcfli opp^rtunry to cxercifc our 
humanity. In the lattitu.de of 27, we

v.'a? not without the greattft care and 
clifiiruiry that we preicrved the young 
man and the maid, whom, at their ear*

pafling by fonie lltt!e incidents, I (hall

no finall trouble, that we got to the

fliould have no more iftfturbance froia 
the favagcs, fo I told iheni, I mini? 
this voyage ckicfly for their fakes, ana 
I was not come to remove their, bi.ii: 
rather to cttaUiifl:) and fix them upon 
the ifland : and for that tr,d, I hud- 
brought them ali forts of nc cellar its Ss 
artificers, with other pcrioRS, that 
would no; only add to their number, 
and conftquently to their defence, bist 
would likwife be a ir.uttir, 1 help and

if they had entirely forgot their form- 
er animoiities, and would engage In 
the itricleft frienclmip ; to which Wil- 
liam Atkins replied, they had afflkj:i 
pns anew to make them all iober, and 
enemies anew to make them aii friends; 
adding withal, that he had mod juilly 
deferved the treatment he had receiv- 
ed from the Spaniards, and that he 
was only to blame in the aiTair ; upon 
which the Spaniards replied, that liiicts 
Atkins had, upon all occaiioris, beha- 
ved hiaifelf fo valiently in tkcir com- 
mon defence, that all that was pad 
iliould be utterly forgotten : that he 
iliould have his arms, and be made the 
next commander to the governor. 

Upon thefe kind declarations of nui- 
t s.i al love and friend (hip, we concluded 
to dine together on the morning, which 
v.'S did in the bell order and formali- 
ty, which the nature of the pUce would 
permit, and, after thut I diftribn.ted to 
everyone ofthciii his portion of the

lion the metropolis, which the Span- 
lards inhabited. 

The young man wbofe mother was 
ftarved to death, as before iiicutionccT, 
and the maid, who was indeed a very 
pious, virtuous young women, feeing 
the good dilpofition of affairs, dropp- 
ed their refolution of going to the Eail 
Indies, and both defircd I would permit 
them to ftay upon the illand, and 
enter them among my fubjecls, the 
Englishmen, which I readily agreed to, 
where they lived comfortably ; and 
the young woman was afterwards mar- 
ried. 

When we came to the Englishmen I 
fir ft plit them in mind, that I had done 
every thing for thorn that was needful, 
in order to their future prefervaticn in 
this life, and now my only concern was 
the prfcrvation of their fouls eternally, 
I afked them concerning their matincr 
of .living with the fayppjc women, ad- 
ding, how fcandalous it was to live in 
inch an open and continued ccurl'e of 
ad-uitary. To which Atkins rcpik;;, 
H 



134 Life and Adventures 
that he believed the fayage 
they lived with to be the moil innocent 
women in the world, and they would 
icvct rorfake them : and, to confirm 
to me that they were fincere, he told 
nic, if thi?re was a clergyman in the 
(liin, they would be married to them 
with nil iheir hearts. I told them there 
was a clergyman in the (hip, and ad- 
\-iiVd them to go and confult the wo- 
men, and I would take care to have 
the ceremony performed to-mov. <>v/ 
morning in due form: which ility all 
agreed to, aad fo the thing was accor- 
diu>'ly done to their mutual fatisfacYion. 

K> J 

In ihort, the men inflrudcd thcii* 
wives as well as they could, in the na- 
ture of the thing they were going ,i- 
bout ; and laid them down as far a^ 
I heir capacities would allow, feme ge- 
neral heads of the Chriftian religion , 
especially Atkins, who, though he had 
been by far the mgft currupt, & vicious, 
yet his education luid been, by far, bet- 
ter than any of the reft. After the 
young prieft had afked them fevcr:',i 
ouc.HioB^ and they had pfoiiiifcd iv 



of Robinfoa Cruloe. ij5 

amend their lives, and to ufe their ut- 
moft endeavours to make their wives 
ChrJdians, he married them ; which 
was not more to my fatisfaeiion, than 
to that of the Englifhmen themftlves, 
and in died was attended with all the 
good confequences that could be ex- 
pected. 

The affairs of the i-fland being thus 
fettled, I was preparing every thing 
for going on board, when the young 
man, wbofe mother had been ftarved, 
as is before mentioned, came to me, 
faying, as he underftood there was a 
clergyman on board, tl at had marri- 
ed the Englishman and the iavages, he 
had a match to propofe between two 
Chriftians, which he dciired might be 
fini filed before I went. At iirll, I thu't 
it might be between himielf and h;s 
mothers maid, and began to give iiir.i 
foinc advice to the contrary, Upon 
which he told me I wcs miftaken ; he 
had nothing to a/k of me for his parr, 
but a fniall parcel of ground for a plan 
tation, a fsrvant or iv/o, and a tc".v 
nccelTdrie's ; and tiii.t I

uamindfid of him when I came to En- 
gland ; but as for the match I am to 
propofc to you, it is between the En- 
glishman you call Jack of all trades^ 
and the maid Sufan. 

I was agreeably furprtfed at the 
mentioning this match which was very 
fuitablc ; the fcllo\v being a very aclive 
induftrious man, and the woman adif- 
creet, neat, cleanly houle wife, and 
> the match was concluded, and they 
were married the fame day.- As to 
their fliaring out the land, I left it to 
Yv r ilJiam Atkins, who indeed difcharged 
the truft with greai fidelity. As to 
their laws and government, I advifed 
them earueftly to love one another, & 
to ui.ike \\hat further by laws they 
fhci x iiid ihink proper for their general 
good and benefit. 

At OIK* return, we called to Atkin's 
c, where we found the new marri- 
ed woman in a dole conference with 
Atkiu's wife, who had been baptized. 
Says Atkins, when God has finners to 
reconcile to himfelf, he is never with, 
out an inflructor : for this young wo-

snan, \vhom. Providence has fent among 
us, has fcnl'e and religion enough to 
convert a whole ifland offavages. The 
y 9 iing woman bin QIC d and was going 
to rile, but I bid her lit ftill, telling 
lier I hoped God would blefs her good 
cndavocrs, and fo, taking out of my 
pocket a Bible, I gave it to Atkins, 
which he received with the grcatcft 
marks of gratitude and fatisf action : & 
fo, after m.ir/ religious difcourfcs, I 
dcflred tde young woman to give me 
the b?1 account fhc could cf the an- 
guilh ihe felt, v/hen {he was ftarving 
to death iu the fhip, which ihc did in 
{nns very Moving and pathetic. 

And now, having difpoled every

Cape we only took in frcfh water, and 
then failed direcliy for the coafl of
