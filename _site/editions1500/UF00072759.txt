AUTHOR'S PREFACE

TO

THE FIRST EDITION.

+

IF ever the story of any private man's adventures in the world were
worth making public, and were acceptable when published, the Editor
of this account thinks this will be so.

The wonders of this man's life exceeded all that (he thinks) is to be
found extant ;' the life of one man being scarcely capable of a greater

variety. ~

The story is told with modesty, with seriousness, and with a religious
application of events to the uses to which wise men always apply them,
viz., to the instruction of others by their example, and to justify and
nononr the wisdom of Providence in all the variety of our circum-
stanCes, let them happen how they will.

The Editor believes the thing to be a just history of facts; neither
is there any appearance of fiction in it; and however thinks, because
all such things are disputed, that the improvement of it, as well to
the diversion as to the instruction of the reader, will be the same; and '
as such, he thinks, without further compliment to the world, he does
them a great service in the publication.

LIFE AND ADVENTURES

Itchingnn (Eraser.

.0.

I WAS born in the year 1689, in the city of York, of a good family, though
not of that country, my father being a foreigner of Bremen, who settled first
at Hull. He got a good estate by merchandise, and, leaving off his trade,
lived afterwards at York; from whence he had married my mother, whose
relations were named Robinson, a very good family in that country, and from
whom I was called RobinSOn Kreutznaer; but, by the usual corruption 4:
words in England, we are now called, nay, we call ourselves, and write our
name, Crusoe; and so my companions always called me.

I had two elder brothers, one of whom was lieutenant-colonel to an
English regiment of foot in Flanders, formerly commanded by the famous
Colonel Lockhart, and was killed at the battle near Dunkirk against the '
Spaniards. What became of my second brother I never knew, any more
than my father and mother did know what was become of me.

Being the third son of the family, and not bred to any trade, my head
began to be filled very early with rambling thoughts. My father, who was
very ancient, had given me a competent share of learning, as far as house-
education and a country free-school generally go, and designed me for the
law; but I would be satisfied with nothing but going to sea: and my in-
clination to this led me so strongly against the will, nay, the commands of
my father, and against all the entreaties and persuasions of my. mother and
other friends, that there seemed to be something fatal in that propension of
nature, tending directly to the life of misery which was to befall me.

My father, a wise and grave man, gave me serious and excellent counsel
against what he foresaw was my design. He called me one morning into
his chamber, where he was confined by the gout, and expostulated very .
warmly wrth me upon this subject: he asked me what reasons, more than
a mere wandering inclination, I had for leaving his house, and my native5 rm: Lin: no ansz'runzs

country, where] might lu' well introduced, and had a prospect of raising
my fortune by application and industry, with a life of ease and pleasure. He
told me it was for men of dosperate fortunes, on one hand, or of aspiring.
superior fortunes, on the other, who went abroad upon adventureS, '0 rise
by enterprise, and make tlu'nm'lvcs famous in undertakings of a. nature out
of the conunon road ; that tin-so things wr-re all either too for above me, or
too far below me ; that mine was the middle state, or what might be called
the upper station of low life, which he had found, by long experience, was
the host state in the world. the most suited to lmmnn happiness, not exposed
to the miseries and hardships, the labour and snth'rings of the mechanic part
of mankind, and not otuhurrassrd with the pride, luxury, ambition, and envy
of the upper part of mankind: he told me, I might judge of the happiness of
this state by one thing, viz. that this was the state of life which all other
people envied; that kings have frequently lamented the miserable consc--
quem'cs of being born to great things, and wished they had been placed in
the middle of two extremes, between the mean and tho grunt ; that the wise
man gave his testimony to this, as the just standard of true felicity, when he
prayed to have neither poverty nor riches.

He bade me observe it, mull should always find, that the calamities
of life were shared among the upper and lower part of mankind ; but
that the middle station had the fewest disasters, and was not exposed to so
many vicissitudes as the higher or lower part of mankind: my, they were
not subjected to so many distempors and uneasinesses, either of body or
mind, as those were, who, by vicious living, luxury, and extravagnncies, on
our: hand, or by hard labour, want of ncvt'ssarics, and mean and insufficient
diet, on the other hand, tiring distempers upon themselves by the naturtl
vonscqucm'es of their way of living; that the middle station of life was cal-
culated for all kind of virtues, and all kind of cujoyments; that peace and
plenty were the handmaids of a middle fortune; that temperance, modem-
tiou, quietness, health, society, all agreeable diversions, and all desirable
pleasurr-s, were the blessings attending the middle station of life; that this
way men went silently and smoothly through the world, and comfortably
out of it, not embarrassed with the inhaurs of the hands or of the hood, no.
sold to the life of slavery for daily bread, or harassed with perplexed cir<<
CUthiMK't s, which rot: the soul of peace, and the body of rest 5 not enraged
with the passion of envy, or secret burning lust of ambition for great thing! '
but, in easy cin'mnstnnecs, sliding gt-rrtly through the world, and sensibly
tasting the streets of living, without the Litter; feeling that they are happy,
and learning, by ovcry day's vxpericncc, to know it more sensibly.

After this, he pressed mo earnestly, and in the most affectionate manner,
not to play the young man, nor to precipitate myself into miseries which
nature, and the station of life I was born in, seemed to have provided against;
that l was under no necessity of seeking my bread ; that he would do well (or
me, and endeavour to enter me fairly into the station of life which he had
hocu just rcuonmmmling to me; and that, it" I was not very easy and happy
in the world. it must be my more fate, or fault, that must hinder it; and thator ROBINSON cnvsoa. 7

me should have nothing to answer for, having thus discharged his duty in
warning me against measures which he knew would be to my hurt :--in a
word, that as he would do very kind things for me if i would stay and settle
at home as he directed, so he would not have so much hand in my misfor-
tunes as to give me any encouragement to go away: and, to close all, he
told me I had my elder brother for an example, to whom he had used the
same earnest persuasions to keep him from going into the Low-Country wars;
but could not prevail, his young desires prompting him to run into the army,
where he was killed; and though, he said, he would not cease to pray for
me, yet he would venture to say to me, that, if I did take this foolish step,
God would not bless me; and I would have leisure, hereafter, to reflect upon
having neglected his counsel, when there might be none to assist in my
recovery.

I observed, in this last part of his discourse, which was truly prophetic,
though, I suppose, my father did not know it to hc so himself; I say, 1 ob
served the tears run down his face very plentifnlly, especially when he spoke
of my brother who was killed ; and that, when he spoke of my having leisure
to repent, and none to assist me, he was so moved that he broke off the dis-
course, and told me his heart was so full he could say no more to me.

I was sincerely affected with this discourse; as, indeed, who could be
otherwise? and I resolved not to think of going abroad any more, but to
settle at home, according to my father's desire. But, alas! a few days wore
it all off: and, in short, to prevent any of my father's further importunities,
m a few weeks after I resolved to run quite away from him. However, I
did not act so hastily, neither, as my first heat of resolution prompted; but
I took my mother, at a time when I thought her a little pleasanter than or-
dinary, and told her that my thoughts were so entirely bent upon seeing the
world, that I should never settle to any. thing with resolution enough to go
through with it, and my father had better give me his consent than 'force
me to go without it; that I was now eighteen years old, which was too late -
to go apprentice to a trade, or clerk to an attorney; that l was sure, if I did,
I should never serve out my time, and 1 should certainly run away from my
master before my time was out, and go to sea; and if she would speak to
my father to let me make but one voyage abroad, if I came home again, and
did not like it, 'I would go no more; and I would promise, by a double dili-
gence, to recover the time I had lost. .

This put my mother into a great passion: she told me she knew it would
be to no purpose to speak to my father upon any such a subject; that he
knew too Well what was my interest to give his consent to any thing so
much for my hurt; and that she wondered how I could think of any such
thing, alter such a discourse as 1 had from my father, and such kind and
tender expressions as she knew my father had used to me: and that, in
short, if I would ruin myself, there was no help for me; but 1 might depend
1 should never have their consent to it: that, for her part, she would not have
so much hand in my destruction ;-and I should never have it to say, that
my mother was willing when my father was not.
Though my mother refused to move it to my father, yet, as I have heard
afterwards, she reported all the discourse to him; and that my father, afie'r
chewing a great concern at it, said to her with a sigh, ' That boy might be
happy, if he would stay at home; but, if he goes abroad, he will be the
most miserable wretch that ever was born : I can give no consent to it.'

It was not till almost a year after this that I broke loose; though in the
mean time I continued obstinately deaf to all proposals of settling to busi-
ness, and frequently expostulating with my father and mother about their
being so positively determined against what they knew my inclinations
prompted me to. But, being one day at Hull, whither I went casually,
and without any purpose of making an elopement at that time, and one of
my companions then going to London by sea in his father's ship, and prompt-
ing me to go with them by the common allurement of sea-faring men, viz.
that it should cost me nothing for my passage, l consulted neither father our
mother any more, nor so much assent them word of it; hutlett them to
hear of it as they might, without asking God's blessing, or my father's;
without any consideration of circumstances or consequences; and in an ill
hour, God knows.

On the [st of September, 1651, I went on board a ship bound for London.
Never any young adventurer's misfortunes, I believe, began earlier, or
continued longer, than mine. The ship had no sooner got out of the Humber,
than the wind began to blow, and the waves to rise, in a most frightful
manner; and, as I had never been at sea before, I was most inexprwibly sick
in body, and terrified in mind. I began now seriously to reflect upon what
I had done, and how justly l was overtaken by the Judgment of Heaven,
for wickedly leaving my father's house, and abandoning my duty. All the
good counsel of my parents, my father's tears, and my mother's entreaties,
came new fresh into my mind; and my conscience, which was not yet come
to the pitch of hardness to which it has been since, reproached me with the
contempt of advice, and the breach of my duty to God and my father.

All this while the storm increased, and the sea, which I had never been
upon before, went very high, though nothing like what I have seen many
times since; no, nor what I saw a few days after; but, such as it was,
enough to affect me then, who was but a young sailor, and had never known
any thing of the matter. I expected every wave would have swallowed us
up; and that every time the ship fell down, as I thought, in the trough or
hollow of the sea, we should never rise more; and in this agony of mind I
made many vows and resolutions, that if it would please God to spare my
life this voyage, if ever I got my foot once on dry land, I would go directly
home to my father, and never set it into a ship again while 'I lived; that I
would take his advice, and never run myself into such miseries as thwe any
more. Now I saw plainly the goodnem of his observations about the middle
station of life; how easy, how comfortable, he had lived all his days, and
never had been exposed to tempests at sea or troubles on shore; and I re-
solved that I would, like a true repeating prodigal, go home to my father.

These wise and sober thoughts continued during the storm, and indeedE

some tune alter; but the next day, as the wind was abated, 'and the sea
calmer, I began to be a little inured to It. However, I was very grave that
day, being also a little sea-sick still: but towards night the weather cleared
up, the wind was quite over, and a charming fine evening followed; the
sun went down perfectly clear, and rose so the next morning; and having
little or no wind, and a smooth sea, the sun shining upon it, the sight was,
as I thought, the most delightful that I ever saw.

I had slept well in the night, and was now no more sea-sick, but very
cheerful, looking with wonder upon the sea, that was so rough and terrible
the day before, and could be so calm and pleasant in a little time after.

And now, lest my good resolutions should continue, my companion, who
had indeed enticed me away, came to me, and said, ' Well, Bob,' clapping
me on the shoulder, ' how do you do after it ? l warrant you were frightened,
wa'n't you, last night, when it blew but a cap-fill! of wind t'-----' A cap-full,

he, 'do you call that a storm? Why, it was nothing at all; give us but a

that: you are but a fresh-water sailor, Bob; come, let us make a bowl of
punch, and we'll forget all that. D'ye see what charming weather '63 now 9
To make short this sad part of my story, we went the way of all sailors; the
punch was made, and I was made drunk with it; and in that one night's
wickedness I drowaed all my repentance, all my reflections upon my pm
conduct, and all my resolutions for the future. In a word, as the sea was
returned to its smoothness of surface and settled calmness by the abatementof
the storm, so the hurry of my thoughts being over; my fears and apprehensions
of being swallowed up by the sea forgotten, and the current of my former
desires returned, 1 entirely forgot the vows and promises I had made in'Lmy
distress. I found, indeed, some intervals of reflection; and serious thoughts
did, as it were, endeavour to return again sometimes; but I shook them 95
and roused myself from them, as it were from a distemper, and, applying
myself to drink and company, soon mastered the returns of those fits--<<for
so I called them; and I had in live or six days got as complete a victory
over conscience as any young fellow, that resolved not to be troubled with it.
could desire. But [was to have another trial for it. still; and Providence, as
in such case: generally it does, resolved to leave me entirely without excuse:
for, if I would not take this for a deliverance, the next was to be such an one as
the worst and most hardened wretch among us would confess both the
danger and the mercy of. The sixth day of our being at sea, we came into
Yarmouth roads; the wind having been contrary, and the weather calm.
we had made but little way since the storm. Here-we were obliged to come
to an anchor; and here we lay, the wind continuing contrary, viz, at south.
west, for seven or eight days, during which time a great many ships from
Newcastle came into the same roads, as'the common harbour where the ships
might wait for a wind forthe river. We'had'not, however, rid here so long.
but we should have titled "ua series}; but that the wind blew too fresh;
and, after we had lain fonrorm days, blew very hdrd. However. the roads

being reckoned as good as a harbour, the anchorage good, and our ground:
tackle very strong, our men were unconcerned, and not in the least appre-
heosive of danger, but spent the time in rest and mirth, alter the manner of
the sea. But the eighth day, in the morning, the wind increased, and we had
all hands at work to strike our topmasts, and make every thing snug and
close, that the ship might ride as easy as possible. By noon the sea went very
high indeed, and our ship rode forecaatle in, shipped several seas, and we
thought, once or twice, our anchor had come home; upon which our
master ordered out the sheebanchor; so that we rode with two anchors
ahead, and the cables veered out to the better end. _

By this time it blew a terrible storm indeed; and now i began to see
terror and amazement in the faces of even the seamen themselves. The
master was vigilant in the business of preserving the ship; but, as he went
to and out of his cabin by me, I could hear him softly say to bimelf several
times, ' Lord, be merciful to us! we shall be all lost! we shall be all undone?
and the like. During these first hurries! was stupid, lying still I!) my cabin,
which was in the steerage, and cannot describe my temper. I could ill reassurne
the first penitence, which I had so apparently trampled upon, and hardened
myself against; l thought that the bitterness of death had been passed, and
that this would be nothing too, like the first: but when the master bin>>
self came by me, as I said just now, and said we should be all lost, I was
dreadfully frightened. I got up out of my cabin, and looked out; but such
a dismal sight i never saw; the sea went mountains high, and broke upon
as every three or four minutes. When 1 could look about, I could see no-
thing but distress around us; two ships, that rid near us, we found had cut
their masts by the board, being deeply laden; and our men cried out that
a ship, which rid about a mile a-head of us, was inundated. Two more
ships, being driven from their anchors, were run out of the roads to sea, at
all adventures, and that with not a mast standing. The light ships fared
the best. as not so much labouring in the see; but two or three of them
drove, and came close by us, running away, with only their spritsails out,
before the wind. Toward evening, the mate and boatswain begged the
master of our ship to let them cut away the foremost, which he was very
loth to do; but the boatswain protesting to him that if he did not the ship
would founder, he consented; and, when they had cut away the foremost, the

mainmast stood so loose, and shook the ship so much. they were obliged to '

cut it away also and make a clear deck.
Any one may judge what a condition I must be in at all this. who was

but a young sailor, and who had been )0 such a {right before at but a little.
But if 1 can express, at this distance. the thoughts 1 had about me at thattime.

seamen every now and then cried out she would founder. It was m'y'ad-
vantage, in one respect, that I did not know what they meant by founder,
till I inquired. However, the storm was so violent, that 1 saw, what .is not
often seen, the master, the boatswain, and some others, more sensible .than
the rest, at their prayers, and expecting every moment the ship would go
to the bottom. In the middle of the night, and under all the rest of our dis-
tresses, one ofthe men,that had been down onpurpose to see,cried out, we
had sprung a leak; another said, there was four feet water in the hold.
,Then all hands were called to the pump. At that very word, my heart, as '
I thought, died within me; and 1 (tall backwards upon the side of myrbed,
where I sat in the cabin. However, the men roused me, and told me,.that
I, who was able to do nothing before, was as well able to pump as another:
at which I stirred up and went to the pump. and worked very heartily. ,
While this was doing, the master, seeing some light oolliers, who, not able .
to ride out the storm, were obliged to slip and run away to sea, and would -
not come near us. ordered us to fires gun, as a signal of distress. I,' who
knew nothing what that meant, was so surprised, that I thought the ship
had broke, or some dreadthl thing had happened. In a word, I was soar.
prised, that i fell down in a swoon. As this was a time when everybody
had his own life to think of, no one minded me, or what was become of
me: but another man stepped up to the pump and, thrusting me aside with
his foot, let me lie, thinking I had been dead; and it was a great while
before i came to myself. ,. -. 4.;

We worked on; but the water increasing in the hold, it was- appslrnt'
that the ship would founder; and though the storm beganto abate a' little;

the master continued firing guns for helpmand a light shim-who had rid

utmost hazard the boat came near us, but it was impossible for us to gators
board, or for-the boat to lie near the ship's side; till at last, the menrowing
very heartily, and venturing their lives to save ours, our men cast them 3
rape over the stern, with s buoy to it, and then veered it out a great length,
which they, after great , labour and hazard, took hold of, and we .ha'nled -
them close under our stern, and got all into their boat. It was to unplug
pose for them or us, alter we were in the boat, to think of reaching their?
own ship; so all agreed to let her drive, and only to pull her in towardsr'
shore as much sswe could; and our master promised them, that, ifthe boat.
was staved upon shore, he would make it good to their master; so, partly row-
ing, and partly driving, our boat went away to the northward, sloping to-
wards the shore almost as far as Winterton-Ness. .

-We were not much more than a quartelzof- an hour out afour ship when

heart was, as it were, dead within me, partly with fright, partly with horror
of mind; and the thoughts of what was yet before me.

While we were in this condition, the men yet labouring at the our to bring
the boat near the shore, we could see (when, our boat mounting the waves,
we were able to see the shore) a gmt many people running along the strand,
to assist us when we would come near: but we made slow way towards the
shore; nor were we able to reach it, till, being past the light-house at Win-
ter-ton. the shore falls 08' to the westward, towards Cromer, and so the land
broke off a little the violence of the wind. Here we got in, and, though not
without much difficulty, got all safe on shore, and walked afterwards on foot
to Yarmouth ; where, as unfortunate men, we were used with great
humanity, as well by the magistrates of the town, who assigned us good
quarters, as by the particular merchants and owners of ships; and had
money givenus suficieut to carry us either to London or back to Hall, as
we thought fit.

Had I now had the sense to have gone back to Hull, and have gone home,
I had been happy; and my father, an emblem ofour blessed Saviour's para-
ble, had even killed the failed oalt' for me; for, hearing the ship I went in
was cast away in Yarmouth roads, it was a great while before he had any
assurance that I was not drowned.

But my ill fate pushed me on with an ohstinacy that nothing could resist;
and, though i had several times loud calls from my reason, and my more
composed judgment, to go home, yet 1 had no power to do it.-l know not
what to call this, nor will I urge that it is a secret overruling decree that
hurries no on to be the instruments of our own destruction, even though it
be before us, and that we rueh upon it with our eyes open. Certainly, no.
thing but some such decreed unavoidable misery attending, and which it
was impossible for me to escape, could have pushed me forward against the
calm reasoniuga and pemasions of my moat retired thoughts. and against
two such visible instructions as I had met with in my first attempt.

My comrade, who had helped to harden me before, and who was the man-
ter's son, was now less forward than I : the first time bespoke to me other we
were at Yarmouth, which was not till two or three days, for we were sepa-
rated in the town to several quarters; I say, the first time he saw me, it
appeared his tone was altered, and, looking very melancholy, and shaking
his head, asked me how i did: telling his {other who I won, and how I had,
come this voyage only for a trial, in order to go further abroad. His father
turning to me with a grave and concerned tone, ' Young mau,' says he, '
' you ought never to go to sea any more; you ought to take this for a plain
and visible token that you are not to he a sea-faring man.'-~'Why, sirl'
said I; 'will you go to sea on more r--'That'is another case,' said he 5-
' it is my calling. and therefore my duty; but, as you made this voyage for

in the ship of Tarshisha--Jt'rey, continues he,' what are you I and on what- ,

were yet agitated by the sense of his loss; and wasfarther than'hecould -

exhorted me to go back' to my father, and not tempt Providence to my
ruin; told me I might see avisible handof Heaven against me; ' and, young
man,' said he ' depend upon it, if you do not go back, wherever you go
you will meet with nothing but disasters and disappointments, till your
father's words are fulfilled upon you)

We parted soon after, for I made him little answer, and I saw ~him no
more; which way he went, I know not: as for me, having some money in
my pocket, I travelled to London by land; and there, as well as on the
road, had many struggles with myself what course of life I should take, and
whether I should go home or go to sea. As to going home, shame opposed
the best motions that offered to my thoughts; and itsimmediately occurred
to me how I should he laughed at among the neighbours, and should be
ashamed to see, not my father and mother only, but even every body else.
From whence I have often since observed how incongruous and irrational

the common temper or mankind so, especially of youth, to that reason which - '

sught to guide them in such cases, viz., that they are not ashamed to sin,
and yet are ashamed to repent: not ashamed of the action for which they
ought justly to be esteemed fools; but are ashamed of the returning, which
only can make them be esteemed wise men. _
In this state of life, however, I remained some time, uncertain what mea-
sures to take, and what course of life to lead. An irresistible nlnctaucocouo'
tinned to going home; and,'as I stayed awhile, the remembrance of thedise
tress I had been in were ofi'; and, as that abated, the little motion I hailin'
my desires to a return wore off with it, till at last I quite laid aside tb'e
thoughts ofit, and looked out fo'r a voyage. That evil influence which'esr-
ried me first away from my father's house, that hurried me into the wild and
indigested notion of raising my fortune, and that impressed those eonceits so
forcibly upon me, as to make me deaf to all good advice, and to the eutre'aties,
and even the commands, of my father; I say, the same influence, whatever?
it'was, presented the most unfortunate of all enterprises to my view; and I
went on board a vessel bound to the coast ofAfrics; or, as our sailorayule

It was my great misfortune, that in all these adventures I did not" ship
myself as a sailor; whereby, though I might, indeed, have worked a little
harder than ordinary, yet, at the same time, I had learned the duty and
oflice or a funniest-man, and in time might have qualified myself for a mate '
or lieutenant, if not a master: but, as it was always my fate to choose for the
worse, so I did here; for, having money in my pocket, and good clothes upon
my belch, I would always go on board in the habit of a gentleman; and so

lot, first of all, to fall into pretty good company in London a which does not
always happen to such loose and misguided young fellows as Ithen was;
the devil, generally, not omitting to lay some snare for them very early.
But it was not so with me: I first fell acquainted with the. master of a ship.
who had been on the coast of Guinea, and who, having bad very good-suc-
cess there, was resolved to go again. Ile taking a fancy to my conversation.
which was not at all disagreeable at that time, and hearing me say I had
a mind to see the world, told me that if I would go the voyage with
him I should be at no expense , I should be his measmate and his com-
panion , and, if I could carry any thing with me, I should have all. the ad-
vantage of it that the trade would admit, and perhaps I might meet with
some encouragement. I embraced the ofi'er; and, entering into astrict friend-
ship with this captain, who was an honest and plain-dealing man. I went
the voyage with him, and carried a small adventure with me; which, by
the disinterested honesty of my friend the captain, I increased very consider-
ably; for I carried about 40!. in such toys and trilles as the captain directed
me to buy. This 401. "ml mustered together by the assistance of some of
my relations whom I corresponded with; and who, I believe, got my
father, or, at least, my mother, to contribute so much as that to my first ad-
venture. . This was the only voyage which I may say was successful in all my
adventures, and which I owe to the integrity and honesty of my friend, the
captain; under whom also I got a competent knowledge of the mathematics
and the rules of navigation, learned how to keep an accountot' the ship's
course, take an observation, and, in short, to understand some thingsthat
were needful to be understood by a sailor: for, as he took delight to instruct
me, I took delight to learn; and, in a word, this voyage made me both a sailor

and a merchant: {or I brought home 5lh. 902. of gold-dust for my adven-
ture, which yielded me in London, at my return, almost 8001., and this filled
me with those aspiring thoughts which have since so completed my ruin

Yet even in this voyage I had my misfortunes too; particularly, that I was
continually sick, being thrown into a violent caleuture by the excessive heat
of the climate, our principal trading being upon the coast, from the latitude
of 1.5 degrees north, even to the line itself.

I was now set up for a Guinea trader, and my friend, to my great mis-.
fortune, dying soon alter his arrival, I resolved to go the same voyage again;
and I embarked in the same vessel with one who was his mate in the former
voyage, and had now got the command of the ship. This was the nnhappiest _
voyage that ever man made; for, though I did not carry quite 1001. otsmy
new-gained wealth, so that Ihad soot. no, and which I lodgedm'taisy

In this voyage: and the first was this, viz--our ship making'her course to-
wards the Canary islands, or rather between those islands and the African
share, was surprised, in the gray of the morning, by a Turkish. rover,'oPS

the rover 18. About three in the aflernoon he came up with .us; and

bringing to, by mistake, just athwart our quarter, instead of athwart oar-

and poured in a broadside upon him which made him sheer ofi' sgain,.aiter

keeping close. He prepared toatta'ck in again, and we to defend ourselves

but, laying us on board the next time upon our other quarter, he entered _60
men upon our decks, who immediately fell tocutting and hacking the gait
and rigging. We plied them with small shot, half-pike; powder-chests,

and such like, and cleared our deck of them twice. However, to cut short .

this melancholy part of our story, our ship being disabled, and three dour
men killed and eight wounded, we were obliged to yield, and were carried
all prisoners into Sallee, a port belonging to the Moors.

At this surprising change d'my circumstances, from a merchant to a misera-
bie'slsve, 1 was perfectly overwhelmed; and now I looked back upon my
father's prophetic discourse to me, that I should he miserable, and have none
to relieve me; which i thought was now so effectually brought to pass, that
it could not be worse; that now the hand of Heaven had overtaken me, and
I was undone without redemption. But, alas! this was but a taste of the
misery 1 Was to go through, as will appear in the sequel of this story.

Asmy new patron,or master,hadtakenme home to his house,sonas
in hopes he would take me with him when he went to sea again, believing
that it would, some time or other, be his fate to be taken by a Spanish-or
Portuguese man of.war, and that then [should be set atliberty. But ,this
hope of mine was soon taken away;- for, when he went to sea, he left me on
shore, to look alter his little garden, and do the common drudgery of slave
about his house; and, when he came homeagain from his cruize, he ordered
metolieinthecabimtolookanertheship. .

Herel mediated nothing but my escape, and what method I might take
to effect it, but found no way that had the least probability m it. Nothing
presented to make the supposition of it rational; for 1 had nobody to com-
municate it to that would embark with me , no fellow-slave, no Englishman,
Alrishnan, or Scotehmsn there but myself; so that, for two years, Lough ,-
alien pleased myself with the imagination, yet I never had the least encou-
raging prospect of putting it m practice. V

Afies about two years, an odd circumstance presented itseli',. which pat

and go out into the road aofishingg and, as he always took me and a yOung
Moresco with him to row the boat, we made him very merry, and l proved
Very dexterous in catching fish, insomnch that sometimes he would send me
with a Moor, one of his klnsrnen, and the youth, the Moresco, as they called
him, to catch a dish of fish for him. '

It happened one time, that going aoflshing in a stark calm morning, a fig
rose so thick, that, though we were not half a league from the show, we lost
sight of it; and rowing we knew not whither, or which way. we laboured
all day and all the next night, and, when the morning came, we found we
had pulled oif to sea, instead of pulling in for the shore, and that we were
at least two leagues them the shore: however, we got well in again, though
wrth a. great deal of labour, and some danger, for the wind began to blow
pretty fresh in the morning; but particularly we were all very hungry.

But our patron, warned by this disaster, resolved to take more care of
himself for the future ; and, having lying by him the long-boat of our English
ship he had taken, he resolved he would not go a-fishing any more without
a compass and some provision; so he ordered the carpenter of the ship, who
was an English slave, to build a little state-room, or cabin, in the middle of
the long-boat, like that of a barge, with a place to stand behind it to steer
and haul home the main sheet, and room before for a hand or two to stand
and work the sails. She sailed with what we all a shoulder-of-mutton sail.
and the boom jibbed over the top of the cabin, which lay very sung and low
and had in it room for him to lie, with a slave or two, and a table to eat on,
with some small lockers to put in some bottles of such liquor as he thought
fit to drink, and particularly his bread, rice, and coffee.

We went frequently out with this boat aflshing; and, as I was most dex.
terous to catch fish {or him, he never went without me. It happened that
he had appointed to go out in this boat, either for pleasure or for fish, with
two or three Moors of some distinction in that place, and for whom he had
provided extraordinarily, and had therefore sent on board the boat, over-
night, a larger store of provision than ordinary, and had ordered the to get
ready three fusees, with powder and shot, which were on board his ship,
for that they designed some sport offowling, as well as fishing.

I got all things ready as he directed, and waited the next morning with
the boat washed clean, her ensign and pendants out, and every thing- to
accommodate his guests: when, brand-by, my patron came'on board alone,
and told me his guests had put off going, upon some business that fell out,
and ordered me, with the man and boy, as usual, to go out with the boat,
and catch them some fish, for that his friends were to sup at his house: and
commanded, that, as soon as I had got some fish, I should bring it home to
his house: all which I prepared to do.

This moment my former notions of deliverance darted into my thoughts,
for now 1 found I was like to have a little ship at my command, and my
master being gone, I prepared to furnish myself, not for a fishing business,
but for a voyage, though I knew not, neitherfiid I so much asconsrder,
whither I should steer, for any where, to get out of that place, was my way

evident, by the make, were taken out about English prize. and l conveyed

boat. which weighed above half a hundred weight, with a parcel of twine or
thread, a hatchet, a saw, and a hammer, all which were of great use to us
afterwards. especially the wax, tomake candles. Another trick I tried upon
him, which he innocentlyeame into also :--His name was Ismael, whom they
call Muley. or Moley: so I called to him, ' Moley,' said I. 'our patron's guns
are on board the boat; can you not get a little powder and shot! lt may be
we may kill some aleamies (fowls like our curlewa) for ourselves, for I know
he keeps the gunner's store- in the ship.'-' Yes,' says he, ' I will bringsome;
and accordingly he brought a great~leather pouch, which held about a pound
and a halfot powder, or rather more; and another with shot, that had five
orsix pounds, with some bullets; and put all into the boat: at them
time 1 found some powder ot' my master's in the great cabin, with which I
filled one of the large bottles in the case, which was almost empty, pouring
what was in it into another; and thus, furnished with every thing needfiii,

we sailed out ofthe port to fish. The castle, which is at theentrance o!the_

port. knew who we were, and took no notice of us ; and we were not above
amileoutofthe port beforewehauledinoursaihaudsetusdowntofish'.
The wind blew from N. N. E., which was contrary to my desire; for, had it
blown southerly, I had been sure to have made the coast of Spain, and at
last reached to the bay of Cadiz: but my resolutions were, blow which way
I would, I would be gone from the horrid place where I was, and leave the
rest to fate. - '

Alter we had fished sotne time, and catchcd nothing, (for, when I had fish
on my book I would not pull them up, that he might not see them.) I mid to
the 'Moor, ' This will not do; our master 'will not be thus served; we must

stand thrther ofl'.' He, thinking no harm, agreed; and, being atthe headof '

thebmgsetthesails; and, asI hadthe helm,I run theboatnearaleagne
farther, and then brought to, as if I would fish. Then, giving the boy the
helm. I stepped forward towhere theMoorwss, and I took him by surprise,
with my am under his waist, and tossed him clear overboard into the see.
He rose immediately, for he swam like a cork, and called to me, begged to
be taken in, and told me he would go all the world over with me. He
swam so strong after the boat, that he would have reached me very quickly,
there being but little wind; upon which I stepped into the cabin. and,
fetching one of the fowling--piecea,'l presented it at him, and told him, -I had
done him no hurt, and, if he wouldbe quiet, I would do him none: ' But,'

'near the boat, I will shoot you through the head; tbr I am resolved to have
my liberty.' So he turned himself about, and swam for the shore; and!
make no doubt but he reached it with ease, for he was qn excellent swimmer.

I could have been content'to have taken this Moor with me. and have
drowned the boy, but there was no venturing to trust him. When he was
gone, I turned to the boy, whom they called Xury, and said to him, ' Xury, '
if you will be faithful to me, I will make you a great man; but, if you will
not stroke your face to be true to me. (that is, swear by Mahomet and his
father's beard,) I must throw you into the sea too.' The boy smiled in my
face, and spoke so innocently, that 1 could not mistrust him; and swore to
be faiththl to me, and go all over the world with me. -

While I was in View of the Moor. that was swimming, I stood out directly
to sea with the boat, rather stretching to windward, that they might think
me gone towards the Straits' mouth (as indeed any one that had been' in-
their wits must have been supposed to do); for who would have supposed
we were sailing on to the southward, to the truly Barbarian coast, where
whole nations of negrocs were sure to surround us with their canoes, and
destroy us; where we could never once go on shore but we should be de-
VOured by savage beasts. or more merciless savages of human kind.

But, as soon as it grew dusk in the evening, I changed my course, and
steered directly south and by east, bending my course a little toward the cast,
that I might keep in with the shore; and, having a fair fresh gale of wind
and a smooth quiet sea, I made such sail, that I believe by the next day, at
three o'clock in the aflemoon, when I made the land, I could not be less
than 150 miles south of Sallee, quite beyond the emperor of Morocco's do-
minions. or, indeed, of any other king thereabout; for we saw no people.

Yet such was the fright I had taken at the Moors, and the dreadful appre-
hensions I had of falling into their hands, that I would not stop, or go on
shore, or come to an anchor, the wind continuing fair, till I had sailed in
that manner five days; and then, the wind shifting to the southward, I con-
cluded also, that if any of our vessels were in chase of me, they abo would
now give over: so I ventured to make to the coast, and came to an anchor.
in the mouth of a little river; I knew not what or where, neither what
latitude, what country, what nation, nor what river. I neither saw,'nor de-
sired to see, any people; the principal thing I wanted was fresh water. We
came into this creek in the evening, resolving to swim on shore as soon as it
was dark, and discover the country; but, as soon as it was quite dark,-we
heard such dreadful noises of the barking, roaring, and howling of wild
creatures, of we knew not what kinds, that the poor boy was ready to die
with fear, and begged of me not. to go on shore till day. 'Well, Xury,'
said I, ' then I will not; but it may be we may see man by day, who will be
as bad to us as those lions.'-- "I'hen we may give them theihqot-gun,' says
Xury, langhing;' make them run away. Such English Xury spoke by
conversing among us slaves. However, I was glad to see the boy so cheer-
ful, and I gave him a draw out of our puron's case of bottles to cheer him
up Alter all, Xur'y's advice was good, and I- took it. We dropped our" (Ira-1:: -vr '-' up>>

httle anchor, and lay still all night : I say still. for we slept none; for inztwo
or three hours we saw vast creatures (we knew not what to call them), as
many sorts, come down to the sea-shore and run into the water, wallowing
and washing themselves, for the pleasureo! cooling themselves; and they
made such hideous howlings and yellings, that 'I never indeed heard the like.

Xury was dreadfully frightened, and indeed so was I too; but we were
both more n-ightened when we heard one of these miglity creatures swim-
.ming towards our boat: we could not see him, but we might hear him, by
his blowing, to be a monstrous, huge, and furious beast. Xury said it was a
lion; and it might be so, for anght I know; but poor Xury cried to me to
weigh the anchor, and row away. ' No,' says I, ' Xury; we can slip our
able with a buoy to it, and go offto sea: they cannot follow us far.' I had
no sooner said so, but I perceived the emanate (whatever it was) within two
oars' length, which something surprised me; however, I immediately stept
to the cabin door, and, taking up my gun, fired at him; upon which he im-
mediately turned about, and swam to the shore again.

- But it is impossible to describe the horrible noise, and hideous cries and
howlings, that were raised as well upon the edge of the shore as higher
within the country, upon the noise 0r report of the gun; a thing, I believe
those creatures had never heard before. This convinced me there was no
going on shore for us in the night upon that coast. and how to venture on
shore in the day was another question too; for to have fallen into the hands
of any of the savages had been as had as to have fallen into the paws of lions
and tigers; at least, we were equally apprehensive of the danger of it.

, Be that as it would, we were obliged to goon shore somewhere or other
for water, for we had not a pint let! in the boat: when and where to get it
was the point. Xury said, if I would let him-go on shore with one of- the
iars, he would find if there was any water, and bring some to me. I asked
him why he would go; why I should not go, and he stay in the boat? : The
boy answered with so much afi'ection, that he made me love him ever after.
Says he, ' If wild. mans come, they eat me, you go way.'---t Well, Xury,' said
I. 'we will both go; and if the wild mans come, we will kill them; they
shall eat neither of us.' So I gave Xury a piece of rusk bread to eat, and a
dram out of our patron's case of bottles, which I mentioned before; and we
hauled in the boat as near the shore as we thought was proper, and so waded
to shore, carrying nothing but our arms, and two jars-for water.

I did not care to go out of sight of the boat, fearing the coming of canoes
with savages down the river; but the boy, seeing a low place about a mile
up the country, rambled to it; and, by-and~by, I raw him come running
toward me. I thought he was pursued.by some savage, or frightened by
some wild beast, and I therefore ran forwards to help him; but, when I
came nearer to him, I saw-something hanging over his shoulders, which was
a creature that he had shot, like a bare, but. difl'erent in colour, and longer
legs: however, we were veryg lad of it. and It was very good meat: but the

By the best of my calculation, the place where 1 now we: must he that

Once or twice in the day-time I thought I new the Pico of Tenerifl'e,
being the top of the mountain Tenerifi'e in the Counties, and had o greet
mind to venture out, in hopes of reaching thither; but, bovine tried twice.
I was formed in again by contrary mndo; the m else going too high for
my: little vessel; so I received to pursue my first design, and keep along
the shore. _

Several times I woo obliged to land for fresh water, after we bed lea tbio
plane , and once, in particular, being early to the morning, we came to an
anchor under a little point of land which was pretty high; and the tide be-
ginning to flow, we lay still, to go further in. Xury. whose eyes were more
about him than, it seems, mine were, calla softly to me, and tell: me, that
we had beet go farther OR the shore; ' For,' says he, ' look, yonder lien a.

pointed, and saw a dreadful monster indeed, for it was a terrible great lion

hung. a: it were, over him. ' any; says I, ' you than go on shore nnd'kill

be still; and I took our biggest gun, which was almost musket-bore, and
loaded it with a good charge of powder and with two slugs, ond' laid lt.33

down; then I lauded another gun with two bullets; and a third. for we had
three pieces, I loaded with five smaller bullets. I took the best aim 1 could
with the first piece, to have shot him in the head; but he lay so, with his
leg raised a little above his nose, that the slug hit his leg about the knee,
and broke the bone: he started up, growling at first, but, finding his leg
broke, fell down again, and then got up upon three legs, and gave the most
hideous roar that ever I heard. I was a little surprised that I had not hit
him on the head; however, I took up the second piece immediately, and,
though he began to move off, fired again, and shot him in the head, and had
the pleasure to see him drop, and make but little noise, but lie struggling
for life. Then Xury took heart, and would have me let him go on shore
' Well, go,' saidI: so the boy jumped into the water, and, taking a little gun
in one hand, swam to shore with the other hand; and, coming close to the
creature, put the muzzle of the piece to his ear, and shot him in the head
again, which despatched him quite.

This was game, indeed, to us, but it was no food; and I was very sorry to lose
three charges of powder and shot upon a creature that was good for nothing
to us. However, Xury said he would have some of him; so he comes on
board, and asked me to give him the hatchet. ' For what, Xury ?' said I. ' Me
cut off his head,' said he. However, Xury could not cut off his head; but
he cut off a foot, and brought it with him, and it was a monstrous great one
I bethought myself, however, that perhaps the skin of him might, one way
or other, he of some value to us; and I resolved to take of? his skin, '1' I
could. So Xury and 1 went to work with him: but Xury was much the
better workman at it, for I knew very ill how to do It. Indeed, it took us
both up the whole day : but at last we got off the hide of him, and, spreading
it on the top of our cabin, the sun effectually dried it in two days' time, and
t afierwards served me to lie upon.

After this stop, we made on to the southward continually, for ten or twelve
days, living very sparingly on our provisions, which began to abate very
much, and going no oftener into the shore than we were obliged to for
fresh water. My design in this was to make the river Gambia, or Senegal;
that is to say, any where about the Cape de Verd, where I was in hopes to
meet with some European ship; and, if I did not, I knew not what course
I had to take but to seek for the islands, or perish among the negroes.
knew that all the ships from Eur0pe, which sailed either to the coast of Guinea
or to Brazil, or to the East Indies, made this cape, or those islands: and.
in a word, I put the whole of my fortune upon this single paint, either that
. must meet with some ship, or must perish.

When I had pursued this resolution about ten days longer, as I have said,
I began to see that the land was inhabited; and in two or three places, as we
sailed by, we saw people stand upon the shore to look at as: we could also
perceive they were quite black, and stark naked. I was once inclined to have
gone on shore to them; but Xury was my better counsellor, and said to me,
' No go, no go.' However, Ihauled in nearer the shore, that I might talk to
them; and I found they ran along the shore by me a good way. chserved
they had no weapons in their hands, except one, who had a long slender
stick, which Xury said was a lance, and that they would throw them a great
way with good aim; so I kept at a distance, but tallied to them by signs as
well as I could, and particularly made signs for something to eat. They
beckoned to are to stop my boat, and they would fetch me some meat: upon
this I lowered the top of my sail, and lay by, and two of them ran up into
the country; and in less than half an hour came back, and brought with
them two pieces of dry flesh and some corn, such as is the produce of their
country; but we neither knew what the one nor the other was; however, we
were willing to accept it. But how to come at it was our next dispute, for
I was not for venturing on shore to them, and they were as much afraid of
us: but they took a safe way for us all, for they brought it to the shore, and
laid it down, and went and stood a great way 05' till we fetched it on board.
and then came close to us again.

"he made signs of thanks to them, for we had nothing to make them
amends : but an opportunity ofi'ered that very instant to oblige them won-
derfully; for, while we were lying by the shore, came two mighty creehzreo,
one pursuing the other (as we took it) with great fury, from the'mountains
towards the sen. Whether it was the male pursuing the female. or whetherthey
were in sport or in rage, we could not tell, any more than we could tell who-
ther it was usual or strange; but I believe it was the latter, because, in the
first place, those ravenous creatures seldom appear but in the night; and, in
the second place, we found the people terribly frightened, especially the
women. The man that had the lance, or dart, did not fly from them, but
the rest did; however, as the two creatures ran directly into the water, they did
not seem to offer to hill upon any of the negroes, but plunged themselves into
the sea, and sworn about, us if they had come for their diversion : at last, one
of them begun to come nearer our boat than I at first expected; but I lay
ready for him, for I had landed my gun with all possible expedition, and
bade Xury load both the others. As soon as he came fairly within my reach
I fired, and shot him directly in the head: immediately be sunk down into
the water, but rose instantly, and plunged up and down, as if he was strug-
gling for life, and so indeed be was: he immediately made to the shore; but
between the wound, which was his mortal hurt, and the strangling of the
water, he died just before he reached the shore.

It is impossible to express the astonishment of these poor creatures at the
noise and fire of my gun; some of them were even ready to die for fear, and
fell down as dead with the very terror; but when they saw the creature dead
and sunk in the water, and that I made signs to them to come to the shore,
they took heart and came to the shore, and began to seer-ch for the creature-

found :him by his blood staining the water ; and by the help of a rope,
which i. slung round him, and gave the negroes to haul, they dragged him
on shore, and found that it was a moot curious leopard, spotted, and fine to
an admirable degree; and the negroes held up their hands with admiration;
to think what it was I had killed him with.

. The other creature, frightened with the flash of fire and the none of tho
gun, swam on shore, and ran up directly to the mountains from whence they
came; nor could I, at that distance, know what it was. I found quickly the
negroes were for eating the flesh of this creature, so I was willing to have
them take it as a favour from me; which, when I made signs to them that
they might take him, they were very thankful for. Immediately they fell to
work with him; and, though they had no knife, yet, with a sharpened piece
of wood, they took off his skin as readily, and much more readily, than we
could have done with a knife. They ofi'ered me some of the flesh, which I
declined, making as if I would give it them, but made signs for the skin, which
they gave me very freely, and brought me a great deal moreoftheir provisions,
which, though I did not understand, yet I accepted. I then made signs to them
for some water, and held out one of my jars to them, turning it bottom up-
ward, to shew that it was empty, and that I wanted to have it filled. They
called immediately to some of their friends, and there came two women, and
brought a great vessel made of earth, and burnt, as I suppose, in the sun: this
they set down to me, as before, and I sent Xury on shore with my jars, and
filled them all three. The women were as stark naked as the men. '

Iwas now furnished with roots and corn, such as it was, and water; and,
leaving:my friendly negroes, I made forward for about eleven days more, with-
out ofi'eriug to go near the shore, till Isaw the land run out a great length
into the sea, at about the distance of four or five leagues before me; and the
sea being very calm, I kept a large oiling, to make this point. At length
doubling the point, at about two leagues from the land, I saw plainly land
on the other side, to seaw:ard then I concluded, as it was most certain in-
deed, that this was the Cape de V e,rd and those the islands called, fmm
thence, Cape de Verd Islands. However, they were at a great distance,
and I could not well tell what I had best to do; for, if I should be taken
With a gale of wind, I might neither reach one nor the other.

In this dilemma, as I was very pensive, I stepped into the cabin and at
me down, Xury having the helm; when, on a sudden, the boy cried out,
' Master, master, a ship with a sail !' and the foolish boy was frightened out
of his wits, thinking it must needs be some of his master's ships sent to pur-
sue us, when I knew we were gotten far enough out of their reach. I jumped
out of the cabin, and immediately saw, not only the ship, but what she was,
viz, that it was a Portuguese ship, and, as I thought, was bound to the
coast of Guinea for negroes. But, when I observed the course she steered,
I was soon convinced they were bound some other way, and did not design
to come any nearer to the shore: upon which I stretched out to sea as much
as I could, resolving to speak with them, if possible.

With all the sail I could make, I found I should not be able to come in
their way, but that they would be gone by beforeI could make any signal
to them: but, after I had crowded to the utmost, and began to despair, they,
it seems, saw me, by the help of their perspective glasses, and that it was
some European boat, which, they supposed, must belong to some ship that
was lost; so they shortened sail to let me come up. I was encouraged with

o'
this; and, as I had my patron's ensign on board, I made a waflof it to them,
for a signal of distress, and fired a gun, both which they saw; for they
told me they saw the smoke, though they did not bear the gun. Upon
these signals they very kindly broughtto, and lay by for me; and in about
three hours' time I came up with them.

They asked me what I was, in Portuguese, and in Spanish and in French,
butI understood none of them; but, at last, a Scotch sailor, who was on
board, called to me, and I answered him, and told him I was an Englishman;
that I had made my escape out of slavery from the Moors, at Sallee: they
then bade me come on board, and very kindly took me in, and all my
goods.

It was an inexpressible joy to me, which any one will believe, that I was
thus delivered, as I esteemed it, from such a miserable, and almost hopeless.
condition as I was in; and I immediately offered all I had to the captain of
the ship. as a return for my deliverance; but he generously told me he
would take nothing from me, but that all I had should be delivered safe to
me when I came to the Brazils. ' For,' says he, ' l have saved your life on
no other terms than I would be glad to be saved myself; and it may, one
time or other, be my lot to be taken up in the same condition. Besides;
said he, ' when I carry you to the Brazils, so great a way from your own
country, if I should take from you what you have, you will be starved there.
and then I only take away that life I have given. No, no, Seiguor Inglese,~
(Mr. Englishman.):says he, ' I will carry you thither in charity, and these
' gs will help to buy your subsistence there, and your passage home

sgasn.'

As he was charitable in this proposal, so he was just in the performance,
to a tittle; for he ordered the seamen that none should ofi'er to touch any
thing I had: then he took every tln'ng into his own possesswn, and gave me
back an exact inventory of them, that I might have them, even so much as
my three earthen jars.

As to my boat, it was a very good one; and that he saw, and told me he
would buy it of me for the ship's use; and asked me what I would have
for it. I told him, he had been so generous to me in every thing, that I
could not ofl'er to make any price of the boat, but lefl: it entirely to him:
upon which he told me he would give me a note of hand to pay me eighty ,
pieces of eight for it at Brazil; and, when it came there, if any one ofi'ered
to give more, he would make it up. Heofl'ered me also sixty pieces ofeight
more for my boy Xury, which I was loth to take; not that I was not will-
ing to let the captain have him, but I was very loth to sell the poor boy's
liberty, who had assisted me so faithfully in procuring my own'. However,
when I let him know my reason. he owned it to be Just, and offered me
this medium, that he would give the boy an obligation to set him free in ten ,
years if he turned Christin a: upon this, and any saying he was willing to
go to him, 1 let the captain have bun. '

We had a very good voyage to the ,Brazils, and arrived in the Bay de
I'odos los Santos, or All Saints' Bay,in about twenty-two days after. An:
now I was once more delivered from the most miserable of all conditions of
life; and what to do next with myselc I was now to oonn'der.

The generous treatment the captain gave me, I can never enough remem
her: he would take nothing of me for my passage, gave me twenty ducats '
hr the leopard's skin, and forty for the lion's skin, which I had in my M
and caused every thing I had in the ship to be punctmlly delivered tome
and what I was willing tosell, he bought of me; such as the ease of bottles,
two of my guns, and a piece of the lump of bees' wax,---for I had math-
candles of the rest: in a word, I made about two hundred and twenty pieca
of eight of all my cargo; and, with this stock, I went on shore in the
Brazils.

I had not been long here before I was recommended to the house of a
good honest man, like himself, who had an ingeino, as they call it (that is, a
plantation and a sugar-house). I lived with him some time, and acquainted
myself, by that means, with the manner of planting and making of sugar.
and seeing how well the planters lived, and how they got rich suddenly,
resolved, if I could get a license to settle there, I would turn planter smog
them: endeavouring, in the mean time, to find out some way to get my
money, which I had lett in London, remitted to me. To this purpose
getting a kind of a letter of naturalization, 1 purchased as much land, thfi
was uncured, as my money would reach, and formed a plan for my planta-
tion and settlement , such an one as might be suitable tothe stock which I
proposed to myself to receive from England.

' I had a neighbour, a Portuguese of Lisbon, but born of English parents,
whose name was Wells, and in much such circumstances as I was. I call"
him my neighbour because his plantation lay next to mine, and we went on
very sociably together. My stock was but low, as well as his; and we ra-
ther planted for food than any thing else, for about two years. However,
we began to increase, and our land began to come into order; so that the
third year we planted some tobacco, and made each of us a large piece of
ground ready for planting canes the year to come: but we both wanted
help; and now I found, more than before, I had done wrong in parting

' with my boy Xury.
But, alas! for me to do wrong, that never did right, was no great wonder.
I had no'remedy butts go on: I had got into an employment quite remote
l to my genius, and directly contrary to the life I delighted in, and for which
I I forsook my father's house, and broke through all his good advice: nay, I
was coming into the very middle station, or upper degree of low life, which
my father advised me to before , and which, if I resolved to go on with, I
might as well have stayed at home, and never have fatigued myself in the
lvorld, as I had done s and I used often to say to myself, I could have done
this as well in England, a'mdng my friends,'as have gone five thousand miles

ln this manner I used to look upon my condition with the utmost regret
I had nobody to converse with, but now and then this neighbour; no work
to be done but by the labour of my hands; and I used to say, I lived just
like a man cast away upon some desolate island, that had nobody there but
himself. But how just has it been! and how should all men reflect, that,
when they compare their present conditions with others that are worse,
Heaven may oblige them to make the exchange, and be convinced of their
former felicity by their experience: 1 say, how just has it been that the truly
solitary life i reflected on, in an island of mere desolation, should be my lot,
who had so often unjustly compared it with the life which I then led, in
which, had I continued, I had, in all probability, been exceeding prosperous
and rich.

l was, in some degree, settled in my measures for carrying on the planta-
tion, before my kind friend, the captain of the ship that took me up at sea,
went back; for the ship remained there, in providing his ladiug and pre-
paring for his voyage, near three months; when, telling him what little
stock I had left behind me in London, he gave me this friendly and sincere
advicez-- 'Seignor Inglese,' says he (for so he always called me),' if you
will give me letters, and a procuration here in form to me, with orders to
the person who has your money in London to send your efl'ects to Lisbon
to such persous as I shall direct, and in such goods as are proper for this
country, I will bring you the produce of them, God willing, at my return:
but, since human ati'airs are all subject to changes and disasters, 1 would
have you give orders for but one hundred pounds sterling, which, you say
is half your stock, and let the hazard be run for the first, so that, if it come
safe. you may order the rest the same way; and, if it miscarry, you may
have the other half to have recourse to for your supply.'

This was so wholesome advice, and looked so friendly, that i could not
out oe convinced it was the best course 1 could take; so I accordinly pre-
pared letters to the gentlewoman with whom I left my money, and a pro-
curation to the Portuguese captain, as he desired me.

I wrote the English captain's widow a full account of all my adventures;
my slavery, escape, and how I had met with the Portuguese captain at sea; the
humanity of his behaviour; and what condition I was now in; with all
other necessary directions for my supply; and, when this honest captain
came to Lisbon, he found means, by some of the English merchants there,
to send over, not the order only, but a full account of my story to amen
chant at London, who represented it effectually to her: whereupomsfig'm
only delivered the money, but, out of her own pocket, sent the Portuguese
captain a very handsome present for his humanity and charity to me.

The merchant in London, vesting this hundred pounds '
such as the captain had wrote for, sent them directly to '

taken care to have all sorts of tools, iron work, and utensils, necessary {or
my plantation, and which were of great use to me.OI BOIINSON CBU'OE. . 2';

When this cargo arrived I thought my fortune made, for I was surprised
with the joy of it; and my good steward, the captain, had laid out the five
pounds, which my friend had sent him as a present for himself, to purchase
and bring me over a servant, under bond for six years' service, and would
not accept of any consideration, except a little tobacco, which I would have
him accept, being of my own produce.

Neither was this all: but my goods being all English manufactures, and:
as cloths, stuffs, baize, and things particularly valuable and desirable in the
country, 1 found means to sell them to a very great advantage; so that I
might say I had more than four times the value of my first cargo, and was
now infinitely beyond my poor neighbour; I mean in the advancement of
my plantation: for, the first thing I did, I bought me a negro slave, and an
European servant also; I mean another besides that which the captain
brought me from Lisbon.

But, as abused prosperity is oftentimes made-the very means of our ad.
versity, so was it with me. 1 went on the next year with great success in
my plantation; I raised fifty great rolls of tobacco on my own ground more
than I had disposed of for necessaries among my neighbours; and thee filly
rolls, being each of above 100 lb. weight, were well cured, and laid by
against the return of the fleet from Lisbon: and now, increasing in business
and in wealth, my head began to be full of projects and undertakings be-
yond my reach; such as are, indeed, often the ruin of the best heads in
business. Had I continued in the station I was now in, I had room for all
the happy things to have yet befallen me, for which my father so earnestly
recommended a quiet, retired life, and which he had so sensibly described
the middle station of life to be full of: but other things attended me, and I
was still to be the wilful agent of all my own miseries; and, particularly, to
increase my fault, and double the reflections upon myself, which, in my
future sorrows, I should have leisure to make, all these miscarriages were
procured by my apparent obstinate adhering to my foolish inclination, or
wandering about and pursuing that inclination, in contradiction to the
clearest views of doing myself good in a fair and plain pursuit of those pro.
spects, and those measures of life, which Nature and Providence concurred
to present me with, and to make my duty.

As I had once done thus, in breaking away from my parents, so I could
not be content now, but I must go and leave the happy view I had of being
a rich and thriving man in my new plantation, only to pursue a rash and
rm'moderate desire of rising faster than the nature of the thing admitted;
andthus I cast myself down again into the deepest gulf of human misery
that over man fell into, or perhaps could be consistent with life, and a state
of health in the world.

To come, them-by just degrees, to the particulars of this part of my story.
--.-You may suppose, that, having now lived almost four years in the Brazil;
and beginning to thrive and prosper very well upon my plantation, I had at
only learned the language, but had contracted an acunaintance and hism'l',0

28 was man sun anvanrnass -'
ship among my fellow-planters, as well as among the merchants at St. Sal-
vador, which was our port; and that, in my discourses among them. I had
frequently given them an account of my two voyages to the coast of Guinea,
the manner of trading With the negroes there, and how easy it was to pur-
chase on the coast, for trifles--such as beads, toys, knives, scissors, hatchets,
bits of glass, and the like--not only gold dust, Guinea grains, elephauto'
teeth, &c., but negroes, for the service of the Brazils, in great numbers.

They listened always very attentively to my discourses on these heads
but especially to that part which related to the buying negroes; which war
a trade, at that time, not only not far entered into, but, as far as it was, had
been carried on by the assientos, or permission of the kings of Spain and
Portugal, and engrosed from the public; so that few negroes were bought,
and these excessive dear.

It happened, being in company 'with some merchants and planters of my
acquaintance, and talking of those things very earnestly, three of them came
to me the next morning, and told me they had been musing very much
upon what 1 had discoursed with them of the last night, and they came ta:
make a secret proposal to me: and, after enjoining me to secrecy, they told
me that they had a mind to fit out a ship to go to Guinea; that they had all
plantations as well as I, and were straitened for nothing so much as ser
vauts; that as it was a trade that could not be carried on, because they could
not publicly sell the negroes when they came home, so they desired to make '
but one voyage, to bring the negroea on shore privately, and divide them
among their own plantations: and, in a word, the question was, whether
I would go their supercargo in the ship, to manage the trading part upon
the coast of Guinea; and they offered me that I should have an equal share
of the uegroes, without providing any part of the stock.

This was a fair proposal, it must he confessed, had it been made to any
one that had not a settlement and plantation of his own to look after, which
was in a fair way of coming to be very considerable, and with a good stock
upon it. But for me, that was thus entered and established, and had nothing
to do but go on as I had begun, for three or four years more, and to have
sent for the other hundred pounds from England; and who, in that time,
and with that little addition, could scarce have failed of being worth three
or four thousand pounds sterling, and that increasing too; for me to think
of such a voyage was the most preposterous thing that ever man, in such
circumstances, could be guilty of.

ButI, that was born to be my own dcs'fier, could no more resist the
otl'er than I could restrain my first rambling designs, when my father's good
counsel was lost upon me. In a word, I told them I would go with all my
heart, if they would undertaketo look after my plantation in my absence
and would dispose of it to such as I should direct, if 1 miscarried. This they
all engaged to do, and entered into writings or covenants to do so: and I
made a formal will, disposing of my plantation and efi'ccts, in case of my
death; making the captain o' the shin that had saved mv life, as before, my

universal heir: but obliging him to o! my efl'ectsas I WW
In my will; one halfot' the produce being to himself, and the other to be
shipped to England.

In short, I took all possible caution to preserve my effects, and to keep
up my plantation: had I used half as much prudence to have looked into
my own interest, and have made ajndgment of what I ought to have done
.and not to have done, I had certainly never gone away from so prosperous
. an undertaking, leaving all the probable views ofa thriving circumstance,
and gone a voyage to sea, attended with all its common hazards, to say no-
thing of the reasons I had to expect particular misfortunes to myself. ,

But I was hurried on, and obeyed blindly the dictates of my fancy, rather
than my reason: and accordingly, the ship being titted out, and the cargo
furnished, and all things done, as by agreement, by my partners in the
voyage, I went on board, in an evil hour again, the first of September, 1659,
being the same day eight years that I went from my father and mother at
Hull, in order to act the rebel to their authority, and the fool to my own
interest.

Our ship was about one hundred and twenty tons burden, carried six
guns and fourteen men, besides the master, his boy, and myself; we had on '
board no large cargo of goods, except of such toys as were fit for our trade
with the negroes, such as beads, bits of glass, shells, and odd trifles, especially
little looking-glasses, knives, scissors, hatchets, and the like.

The same day I went on board we set sail, standing away to the north.
ward upon our own coast, with design to stretch over for the African coast.
When they came about ten or twelve degrees of northern latitude, which, it
seems, was the manner of their course in those days, we had very good
weather, only excessive hot all the way upon our own coast, till we came
to the height of cape.St. Angustino; from whence, keeping farther of at
sea, we lost sight of land, and steered as if we were bound for the isle Fer-
nando de Noronha, holding our course N. E. by N., and leaving those isles
on the east. In this course we passed the line in about twelve days' time,
and were, by our last observation, in 7 degrees 22 minutes northern latitude,
' when a violent tornado, 9r hurricane, took us quite out of our knowledge:

save their lives.

In this distress,"we' 'bad/liesides the terror of the storm, one of our men
died of the calenture, and one man and a boy washed overboard. About
the twelfth day, the weather ababng a little, the master made an aberration
as well as he could, and found that he was in about 11 degrees north latitude,
but that he was 22 degrees of longitude difl'erence, west from cape St. Au-
gustine; so that he found he was got upon the coast oquiana, orthe north. _ s
so was Lisa Ann. snvxnrunas

nart of Brazil, bede the river Amazons, toward that of the river Oroo-
)oque, commouly called the Great River; and began to consult with me
what course he should take, for the ship was leaky and very much disabled,
and he was going directly back to the coast of Brazil.

I was positively against that; and, looking over the charts of the sea-coast
of America with him, we concluded there was no inhabited country for us
to have recourse to till we came within the circle of the Caribbee islands,
and therefore resolved to stand away for Barbadoes; which, by keeping
06' to sea, to avoid the in-draft of the bay or gulf of Mexico, we might easily
perform, as we hoped, in about fifteen days' sail; whereas we could not
possibly make our voyage to the coast of Africa without some assistance
both to our ship and ourselves.

With this design we changed our course, and steered away N. W. by W.,
in order to reach some of our English islands, where I hoped for relief: but
our voyage was otherwise determined; for, being in the latitude of 12 de.
grees, 18 minutes, a second storm came upon us, which carried us away with
the same impetuosity westward, and drove us so out of the very way of all
human commerce, that had all our lives been saved, as to the sea, we were
rather in danger of being devoured by savages than ever returning to our
own country.

In this distress, the wind still blowing very hard, one of our men, early
in the morning, cried out, ' Land!' and we had no sooner run out of- the
cabin to look out, in hopes of seeing whereabouts in the world we were,
but the ship struck :upon a sand, and, in a moment, her motion being so
stopped, the sea broke over her in such a manner, that we expected we
should all have perished immediately; and we were instantly driven
into our close quarters, to shelter us from the very foam and spray of the
sea.

It is not easy for any one who has not been in the like condition to de-
scribe or conceive the consternation of men in such circumstances; we knew
nothing where we were, or upon what land it was we were driven, whether
an island or the main, whether inhabited or not inhabited; and, as the rage of
the wind was still great, though rather less than at first, we could not so
much as hope to have the ship hold many minutes, without breaking in
pieces, unless the wind, by a kind .of miracle, should immediately turn about
In a word, we sat looking upon one another, and expecting death every
mement, and every man acting accordingly, as preparing for another world;
for there was little or nothing more: for us to do in this: that which was
our present comfort, and all the comfoR We hadhwas, that, contrary to our
expectation, the ship did not break yet, and that the master said the wind
began to abate. '

"'Now, though we thought that the wind did a little abate, yet the ship having
thus struck upon the sand, and sticking too dist for as to expect her getting
03',- we were in a dreadful condition indeed, and had nothing to do but to
think of saving our lives as well as we could. We had a boat at our stern
inst before the storm, but she was first staved by dashing against the ship's
rudder; and. in the Seat place, she broke away, and either'snnh, 'orwss
dnven 06' to sea; so there was no hepe from her: we had another boat on
board. but how to get her ofi' into the sea was a doubtful thing; however,
there was no room to debate, tbr we fancied the ship would break in pieces
every minute, and some told us she was actually broken already. -

In this distress, the mate of our vessel laid hold of the boat, and, with the
help of the rest of the men, they got her flung over the ship's side; and,
getting all into her, let her go, and committed ourselves, being eleven in
number, to God's mercy, and the wild sea : for, though the storm was
abated considerably, yet the sea went dreadful high upon the shore, and
might be well called den. wild zee, as the Dutch call the sea in a storm.

And now our case was very dismal indeed; for we all saw plainly that
the sea went so high that the boat could not live, and that we should be in-
evitably drowned. As to making sail, we had none; nor, if we had, could
we have done any thing with it; so we worked at the oar towards the land,
though with heavy hearts, like men going to execution; for we all knew
that, when the boat came nearer to the shore, she would be dashed in a
thousand pieces by the breach of the sea. However, we committed our
souls to God in the most earnest manner; and the wind driving us towards
the shore, we hastened our destruction with our own hands, pulling as well
as we could towards land.

What the shore was--whether rock or sand, whether steep or shoal--we
lguew not; the only hope that could rationally give us the least shadow of
expectation was, if we might happen into some bay or gulf, or the mouth
of some river, where by great chance we might have run our boat in, or got
under the lee of the land, and, perhaps, made smooth water. But there was
nothing of this appeared; and, as we made nearer and nearer the shore, the
land looked more frightfiil than the sea.

After we had rowed, or rather driven, about a league and a half, as we
reckoned it, a raging wave, mountainolike, came rolling astern of us, and
plainly bade us expect the coup de gnu-e. In a word, it took us with such
a fury, that it overset the boat at once; and, separating us, as well from
the boat as from one another, gave us not time hardly to say, ' 0 God?
for we were all swallowed up in a. moment.

Nothing can describe the confusion of thought which I felt when I sunk
into the water; for, though I swam very well, yet I could not deliver my-
self from the waves so as to draw my breath, till, that wave having driven
me, or rather carried me, avast way on towards the shore, and haviugspent
melf, went back, and led me upon the land almost dry, but half dead with
the water I took in. I had so much presence of mind, as well as breath,
lefi, that, seeing myself nearer the main land than I expected, I gotupon
my feet, and endeavoured to make on towards the land as fast as I could.
before another wave should return and take me up again; but I soon fund
at was impossible toavoid it; forI saw thesesoomeatter me as highael

the water, if! could; and so, by swimming, to preterm my breathing, and
pilot myself towards the shore, if possible; my greatest concern now being,
that the wave, as it would carry me a great way towards the shore when it
came on, might not carry me back again with it, when it gave back towards
the sea. -

The wave that came upon me again buried me at once twenty or thirty
feet deep in its own body; and I could feel myself carried with a mighty
force and awiitnem towards the shore, a very great way; but I held my
breath, and assisted myselfto swim still forward with all my might. I was
ready to burst with holding my breath, when, as I felt myself rising up, so,
to my immediate relief, I found my head and hands shoot out above the sur-
face of the water; and, though it was not two seconds of time that I could
keep myselfso, yet it relieved me greatly, gave me breath, and new courage.
I was covered again with water a good while, but notao long but 1 held
it out; and finding the water had spent itself, and began to return, I struck
forward against the return of the waves, and felt ground again with my feet.
I stood still a few moments, to recover breath, and till the water went from
me, and then took to my heels, and ran, with what strength I had, farther
towards the shore. But neither would this deliver me from the fury of the
sea, which came pouring in alter me again; and twice more I was lifted up
by the waves and carried forwards as before, the shore being very flat.

The last time of these two had well nigh been fatal to me; for, the sea
having hurried me along, as before, landed me, or rather dashed me, against
a piece ofa rock, and that with such force, that it left me senseless, and in-
deed helpless, as to my own deliverance; for the blow, taking my side and
breast, beat the breath, as it were, quite out of my body ; and, had it returned
again immediately, I must have been strangled in the water: but I recovered
a little before the return of the waves, and, seeing I should again be covered
with the water, I resolved to hold fast bya piece of the rock, and so to hold
my breath, if possible, till the wave went back. Now as the waves were
not so high a: the first, being nearer land, I held my hold till the wave
abated, and thou fetched another run, which brought me so near the more,
that the next wave, though it went over me, yet did not so swallow me up
as to carry me away; and the next run I took, Igotto the mainland ; where,
to my great comfort, I clambered up the clitfs of the shore, and sat me down
upon the grass, free from danger, and quite out of the reach of the water.

I was now landed, and safe on shore; and began to look up and thank
God that my life was saved, in a case wherein there were, some minutes be
fore, scarce any room to hope. I believe it is impossible to express, to the
life, what the ecstasies and transports ofthe soul are, when it is so saved, a
I may say, out of the grave: and i did not wonder now at the custom, viz
that when a malefactor, who has the halter about his neck. to tied up, on
just going to be turned 03; and has a reprieve brought to him; I say, It
not wonder that they bring a surgeon with it, to let him blood that re
moment they tell him of it, that the surprise may not drive the animal spirits
from the heart, and overwhelm him.

For sudden joys, like griefs, confound at first.

I walked about on the shore, lifting up my hands, and my whole being,
and may say, wrapt up in the contemplation of my deliverance; making a
thousand gestures and motions, which I cannot describe; reflecting upon my
comrades that were drowned, and that there should not be one soul saved
but myself; for, as for them, I never saw them afterwards, or any sign of
them, except three of their hats, one cap, and two shoes that were not
fellows.

I cast my eyes to the stranded vessel--when the breach and froth of the
sea being so big leould hardly see it, it lay so far ofl'--and considered, Lord!
how was it possible I could get on shore ?

After I had solaeed my mind with the comfortable part of my condition,
I began to look round me, to see what kind of a place I was in, and what
was next to be done; and I soon found my comforts abate. and that, in a
word, Ihad a dreadful deliverance: for [was wet, had no clothes to shift me,
nor any thing either to eat or drink, to comfort me; neither did I see any
prospect before me but that of perishing with hunger, or being devoured by
wild beasts: and- that which was particularly afllicting to me was, that I had
no weapon, either to hunt and kill any creature for my sustenance, or to de-
fend myself against any other creature that might desire to kill me for theirs.
In a Word, I had nothing about me but a knife, :1 tobacco-pipe, and a little
tobacco in a box. This was all my provision; and this threw me into such
terrible agonies of mind, that, for a while, I ran about like a madman. Night
coming upon me, I began, with a heavy heart, to consider what would be
my lot if there were any ravenous beasts in that country, seeing at night
they always come abroad for their prey.

All the remedy that offered to my thoughts, at that time, was, to get up
Into a thick bushy tree, like a fir, but thorny--which grew near me, and
where I resolved to sit all night--and consider the next day what death I
should die, for as yet I saw no prospect of life. I walked about a furlong from
the shore, to see if I could find any fresh water to drink, which I did, to my
great joy; and having drank, and put a little tobacco into my mouth to pre~
vent hunger, I went to the tree, and, getting up into it, endeavoured to place
myselfso, as that, if I should fall asleep, I might not fall; and having cut me
a short stick, like a truncheon, for my defence, I took up my lodging; and
having been excessively fatigued, I fell fast asleep, and slept as comfortably
as, I believe, few could have done in my condition; and found myself the
most refreshed with it that I think I ever was on such an occasion.

When I waked it was broad day, the weather clear, and the storm abated
so that the sea did not rage and swell as before, but that which surprised
me most was, that the ship was lifted oft" In the night from the sand where
sne lay, by the swelling of the tide, and was driven up almost as far as the

rock which I at first mentioned, where I had been so bruised by the wave
75 E
dashing me against it. This beingwithin abouts mile from theshore when
I was, and the ship seeming to stand upright still. I wished myselfnn board,
that at least 1 might save some necessary things for my use.

When I came down from my apartment in the tree, I looked about me
again, and the first thing I found was the boat; which lay. as the wind and
the sea had tossed her up, upon the land, about two mila on my right band.
I walked as far as I could upon the shore to have got to her; but found a
neck, or inlet of water, between me and the boat, which was about half a
mile broad; so I came back for the present, being more intent upon getting
at the ship, where I hoped to find something for my present subsistence.

A little alter noon, 1 found the sea very calm, and the tide ehbed so far
out, that I could come within a quarter of a mile of the ship: and here I
found a fresh renewing of my grief; for I saw evidently, that, if we hadliept
on board, we had been all sale; that is to say, we had all got safe on shore,
and I had not been so miserable as to be left entirely destitute of all comfort
and company, as I now was. This forced tears from my eyes again; but, as
there was little relief in that, I resolved, it possible, to get to the ship; so I
pulled off my clothes, for the weather was hot to extremity, and took the
water: but, when I came to the ship, my difficulty was still greater to know
how to get on board; for, as she lay aground, and high out of the water,
there was nothing within my reach to lay hold of. I swam round her twice,
and the second time I spied a small piece of a rope, which I wondered I did
not see at first, hang down by the fore-chainssolow, as that, with great
difliculty, I got hold of it, and, by the help of that rope, got into the fore.
castle of the ship. Here 1 found that the ship was bulged, and had a great
deal of water in her hold; but that she lay an on the side of a bank of hard
sand, or rather earth, that her stem lay lined up upon the bank, and her
head low, almost to the water. By this means all her quarter was free, and
all that was in that part was dry; for, you may be sure, my first work was
to search, and to see what was spoiled and what was free: and, first. I found
that all the ship's provisions were dry and untouched by the water; and.
being very well disposed to eatpl went to the bread-room, and tilled my
pockets with biscuit, and ate it as I went about other things. for 1 had no
time to lose. I also found some rum in the great cabin, of which I tools a
large dram, and which I had indeed need enough of, to spirit me for'what
was before me. Now I wanted nothing but a boat, to furnish myself with
many things which I foresaw would be very necessary to me. _};'rf

It was in vain to sit still and wish for what was not to he had, and thiaex-
tremity roused my application: we had severalspare yards and two or three
large spars of wood, and aspare-top-mast or two in the ship: I resolved to fall
to work with these, and flung as many overboard as I could manage for their
weight, tying every one with a rope, that they might not drive away
When this was done, I went down the ship's side, and. pulling them to me.

great weight, the pieces beingtoo light: so I went to work, and with the
carpenter's saw I cutaspare top-mast into three lengths, and added them to
my raft, with a great deal of labour and pains. But the hope of furnishing
myself with necessaries encouraged me to go beyond what I should have
' been able to have done upon another occasion.

My raft was now strong enough to bear any reasonable weight. My next
care was what to load it with, and how to preserve what I laid upon it from
the surf of the sea; but 1 was not long considering this. I first laid all the
planks or boards upon it that I could get; and, having considered well what
I most wanted, 1 got three of the seamen's chests, which I had broken open
and emptied, and lowered them down upon my raft: these I filled with pro-
visions, viz., bread, rice, three Dutch cheeses, five pieces of dried goats' flesh
(which we lived much upon), and a little remainder of European corn, which
had been laid by for some fowls thch we had brought to sea with us, but
the fowls were killed. There had been some barley and wheat together,
but, to my great disappointment, I found afterwards that the rats had eaten
or spoiled it all. As for liquors, I found several cases of bottles belonging to
our skipper, in which were some cordial waters; and, in all, about five or
six gallons of rack. These I stowed by themselves, there being no need to
put them into the chests, nor any room for them. \Vhile i was doing this,
I found the tide began to flow, though very calm; and I had the mortifica-
tion to see my coat, shirt, and waistcoat, which 1 had left on shore upon the
sand, swim away, as for. my breeches, which were only linen, and open-
kneed, I swam on board In them and my stockings. However, this put me
upon rummaging for clothes, of which I found enough, but took no more
than I wanted for present use, for I had other things which my eye wasmore
upon; as, first, tools to work with on shore: and it was afler long search-

ing that I found the carpenter' s chest, which was indeed a very MI prig- -, p 4 3 .
to me, and much more valuable than a ship-lading of gold wouldMo beep j?"-

at that time. I got it dowa to my raft, even whole as it was, without locing
time to look into it, for I knew In general what it contained. ' '

My next care was for some ammunition and gran. There were two very
good fowling-pieces in the great cabin, and two pistols; thee I secured
first, with some powder-hams and a small bag of shot, and two old rusty
swords. I knew there were three barrels of powder in the ship, but knew
not where our gunner had stowed them; but, with much search, I found
them: two of them dry and good; the third had taken water. Those'twol
got to my raft, with the arms. And now I thought myself pretty well
freighted, and began to think how I should get to shore with them, having
neither sail, oar, nor rudder; and the least cap-full of wind would have
overset all my navigation. -'

I had three encouragements z--lst. A smooth, calm sea. edly. The tide
rising, and setting in to the shore. sdly. What little wind there was blew
me towards the land. And thus, having found two or three broken oars
belongIng to the boat, and, besidu the tools which were in the chest. I found
two saws, an axe, and a hammer; and with this cargo I put to sea. Fer a36 me. me mo aovnnrvnes

mile, or thereabouta, my raft went very well, only that I found it drive;
httle distant from the place where I had landed before; by which I per-
ceived that there was some inelral'c of the water, and consequently I hoped
to find some creel: or river there, which 1 might make use oi'as a port to get
to land with my cargo.

A31 imagined, so it was: there appeared before me a little opening of the
land, and I found a strong current of the tide set into it; so I guided my
tall as well as 1 could to get into the middle of the stream. But here I had
like to have sufi'ered a second shipwreck, which, if I had, i think verily
would have broken my heart; for, knowing nothing of the coast, my roll ran
aground atone end of it upon a shoal; and, not being aground at the other
end, it wanted but a little that all my cargo had slipped otl' towards that end
that was afloat, and so fallen into the water. I did my utmost, by selling
my back against the chests, to keep them in their places, but could not
thrust oil' the roll with all my strength; neither durst l stir from the posture
I was in; but, holding up the chest: with all my might, I stood in that man-
ner near half an hour, in which time the rising of the water brought me a
little more upon a level; and, shortly alter, the water still rising, my raft
floated again, and I thrust her at? with the car I had into the channel; and
then, driving up higher, I at length found myself in the mouth of a little
river, with land on both sides, and a strong current or tide running up. I
looked on both sides for a proper place to get to share, for I was not willing
to be driven too high up the river; hoping, in time, to see some ship at sea,
and therefore resolved to place myself as near the coast as] could.

At length l spied a little cove on the right shore of the creek, to which,
with great pain and ditliculty, l guided my rah, and at last got so near, as
that, reaching ground with my oar, I could thrust her directly in; but here
I had like to have dipped all my cargo into the sea again; for that shore
lying pretty steep, that is to say, sloping, there was no place to land, but
where one end of my float, if it ran on shore, would lie so high, and the other
sink lower, as before, that it would endanger my cargo again. All that!
could do was to wait till the tide was at the highest, keeping the rail with
my oar. like an anchor, to hold the side of it fast to the shore, near a flat piece
of ground, which I expected the water would flow over; and so it did. As
soon as I found water enough, for my raft drew about a foot of water, I thrust
her upon that flat piece of ground, and there fastened or moored her, by
sticking my two broken oars into the ground, one on one side, near one end,
and one on the other side, near the other end: and thus I lay till the water
ebbed away, and left my raft and all my cargo safe on shore.

My next work was to view the country, and seek a proper place for my
habitation, and where to slow my goods, to secure them from whatever
might happen. Where I was, I yet knew not; whether on the continent,
or on an island; whether inhabited, or not inhabited; whether in danger 0!

wild beasts, or not. There was a hill, not abovea mile from me, which rose.
up very steep and high, and which seemed to overtop some other hills, iyhieh
by an in a ridge from it, northward. I took out one of the. {owliugprooefi

nod'ooe otthe' pistols. and a horn ofpowder; and. thus armed. I eunuch:
discovery up to the top of that hill ; where, alter I had. with great labour
and dificulty, got up to the top, I saw my fate, to my'great afltiction, viz,
that I was in on island, enviroued every way with the sea, no land to beseeu,
except some rocks, which lay a great way ofi', and two small islands. less than
this, which lay about three leagues to the west.

I found also that the island I was in was barren, and, 1131 saw good reason
to believe, uninhabited, except by wild beasts, of whom, however, I saw
none ; yet how abundance offowla, but knew not their kinds; neithei; when
I killed them, could I tell what we: fit for food, and what not. At my
coming back, I shot at a great bird, which I saw sitting upon a tree, on the
side of a great wood. I believe it was the first gun that had been tired
there since the creation of the world: I had no sooner tired, but fmmallthe
pores of the wood there arose an innumerable number of (owls, of many com,
making a confined screaming, and crying, every one according to his usual
note; but not one of them of any kind that I knew. As for the creature I
killed, I took it to be a kind of a hawk, its colour and heal: resembling it,
but had no tolons or clans more than common. Its flesh was carriou, and fit
{or nothing.

Contented with this discovery, I came back toiny me, and fell to work to
bring my cargo on share, which tool: me up the rent of that day. What to
do with myself at night I knew not, nor indeed where to rest: tbr I was
afraid to lie down on the ground, not knowing but some wild beast might
devour me; though, as I afterwards found, there was really no need for those
team.

However, as well as I could, I harrieadoed myself round with the chest:
and boards that I had brought on shore, and made 9. kind of a but for that
night's lodging. As for food, I yet new not which way to supply myself,
except that I had seen two or three creatures, like hares, run out of the
wood where I shot the fowl. - .

I now began to consider that I might yet get a great many things out of
the ship, which would be useful to me, and particularly some ot' the rigging
and coils, and such other thing: as might come to land; and I resolved to
make another voyage on board the vessel, it' possible. And as I knew that
the first storm that blew mutt necessarily break her all in pieces. I resolved
to set all other things apart till I got every thing out of the ship that I could
get. Then I called a council, that is to say, in my thoughts, whether I
should take back the rm; but this appeared impracticable; so I mired is
go as before, when the tide was down; and I did so, only that'I stripped
beforeI went from my but; having nothing on but a chequered shirt, a pal.
of linen drawers, and a pair of pumps on my feet.

I got on board theahip as before, and prepared a second rah; and harms,
had experience of the first, I neither made this so unwieldy, nor loaded it to
hard, but yet I brought away several things very useful to me : no, first, in the
carpenter's stores I found two or three bags of nails and spilt" a great

rev-jack, a dozen or two of hatchcte; and, above all, that most mefiil38 was use sun anszruass

thing called a grind stone. All these 1 secured tagether, with several things
belonging to the gunner, particularly two or three tron mm. and two bar.
rels of musketobullets, seven muskets, and another fowling-pieoe, with louse
small quantity of powder more; a large bagofull of small shot, and a great
roll of sheet-lead; but this last was so heavy, I could not hoist it up to get
it over the ship's side.

Besides these things, I took all the men's clothes that I could find, and a
spare fore-tap sail, a hammock, and some bedding; and with this I loaded my
second rafl, and brought them all safe on shore, to my very great comfort.

I was under some apprehensions, during my absence from the land, that at
least my pr0visions might be devoured on shore: but, when I came back, I
found no sign of any visitor; only there sat a creature like a wild cat upon
one of the chests, which. when I came towards it, ran away a little distance,
and then stood still. She sat very composed and unconcemed, and looked
full in my face, as if she had a mind to be acquainted with me. I presented
my gun to her; but, as she did not understand it, she was perfectly uncon-
cerned at it, nor did she offer to stir away; upon which I tossed her a bit
of biscuit, though, by the way, I was not very free of it, for my store was not
great: however, I spared her a bit, I say, and she went to it, smelled of it.
and ate it, and looked (as pleased) for more; but I thanked her, and cow.
spare no more: so she marched of.

Having got my second cargo on shore~though I was fain to open the
barrels of powder, and bring them by parcels, for they were too heavy, being
large casks-I went to work to make me a little tent with the sail, and some
poles, which I cut for that purpose; and into this tent 1 brought every thing
that I knew would spoil either with rain or sun; and I piled all the empty
chess and casks up in a circle round the tent, to fortify it from any sudden
attempt either from man or beast.

When I. had done this, 1 blocked up the door of the tent with some boards
within, and an empty chest set up on end without; and, spreading one of
the beds upon the ground, laying my two pistols just at my head, and my
gun at length by me, I went to bed for the first time, and slept very quietly
all night, for l was very weary and heavy; for the night before I had slept
little, and had laboured very hard all day, as well to fetch all those things
from the ship, as to get them on shore.

I had the biggest magazine of all kinds now that ever was laid up, I be.
lieve, for one man: but I was not satisfied still; for, while the ship sat uprigls
in that posture, I thought I ought to get every thing out of her that I cotdd
so every day, at low water, I went on board, and brought away something
or other; but particularly, the third time I went, I brought away as much
of the rigging as I could, as also all the small ropes and rope-twine I couh
get, with a piece of spare canvas, which was to mend the sails upon occasion,
and the barrel of wet gunpowder. In a word, I brought away all the sails
first and last; only that I was fain to cut them in pieces, and bring as much
at a time as I could; for they were no more useful to be sails, but as mere
canvass only.
But that which comforted me still more was that, last of d. utter I had
made five or six such 'voyages as these, and thought I had nothing more to
expect from the ship that was worth my meddling with; I say, that all this.
I baud a great hogshead of bread, and three large roulets of rum or spirits,
and a box of sugar, and a barrel of fine flour. This was surprising to me,be-
cause I had given over expecting any more provisions, except what was
spoiled by the water. I soon emptied the hogshead of that bread, and
wrapped it up, parcel by parcel, in pieces of the sails, which I cutout; and,
in a word, I got all this safe on shore also.

The next day I made another voyage; and now, having plundered the ship
of what was portable and fit to hand out, I began with the cables, and
cutting the great cable into pieces, such as I could move, I got two cables
and a hawser on shore, with all the iron-work I could get; and, having-cut
down the spritsaiI-yard and the mizen-yard, and every thing 1 could, to
make a large rail, I loaded it with all those heavy goodsy and came away:
but my good luck began now to leave me; for this rafi was so unwieldy.
and so overladen, thstatter I was entered the little cove, where I had landed
the rest of my goods, not being able to guide it so handily as I did the other, '
it overset. and threw me and all my cargo into the water. As for myself, it
was no great harm, for I was near the shore; but, as to my cargo, it was a
great part of it lost, especially the iron, which I expected would have been
of great use to me: however, when the tide was out, I got most of the pieces
of cable ashore, and some of the iron, though with infinite labour; for I was
faiu to dip for it into the water,---a work which fatigued me very much.
After this I went every day on board, and brought away what I could get.

I had been now thirteen days ashore, and had been eleven times on board
the ship; in which time I had brought away all that one pair of hands could
well be supposed capable to bring; though I believe verily, had the calm
weather held, I should have brought away the whole ship, piece by piece,
but, preparing the twelfth time to go on board, I found the wind began to
rise: however, at low water, I went on board; and though I thought I had
rummaged the cabin so effectually as that nothing could be found, yet I dis-
covered a locker with drawers in it, in one of which I found two or those
razors, and one pair of large scissors, with some ten or a dozen of good
knives and forks; in another I found about thirty-six pounds value in money.
some European coin, some Brazil, some pieces of eight. some gold, and
some silver.

I smiled to myself at the sight of this money: ' 0 drug !' said I aloud, 'what
art than good for? Thou art not worth to me, no, not the taking off the
ground; one of those knives is worth all this heap: [have no manner of use
for thee; e'en remain where thou art, and go to the bottom; as a creature
whose life' is not worth saving. However, upon second thoughts, I took it
away; and, wrapping all this in a piece of canvas, I began to think of
making another raft; but, while 1 was preparing this, I found the sky over-

gale horn the-shore. It presently occurred to me that it wash: vain to prev

tend to make a raft with the wind otfahore; and that it was my businas to ,

be gone before the time of flood began, or otherwise I might not be able to
reach the shore at all. Accordingly, I let myself down into the water, and
swam aerws the channel which lay between the ship and the sands, and
even that with difficulty enough, partly with the weight of the things I had
about me, and partly the roughness of the water; for the wind rose very
hastily, and before it was quite high water it blew a storm.

But I was got home to my little tent, where I lay with all my wealth
about me very secure. It blew very hard all that night; and in the morn-
ing, when I looked out, behold, no more ship was to be seen! I was a little
surprised, but necovered myself with this satisfactory reflection, viz, that I
had lost no time, nor abated no diligence, to get every thing out of her that
could be useful to me, and that, indeed, there was little led in her that] was
able to bring away, if I had had more time.

I now gave over any more thoughts of the ship, or of any thing out of her,
except what might drive on shore from her wreck; as, indeed, divers pieces
other alierwards did; but those things were ol' small use to me.

My thoughts were now wholly employed about securing myself against
either savages, if any should appear, or wild beasts, if any were in the
island; and] had many thoughts of the method how to do this, and what
kind of dwelling to make, whether I should make me a cave in the earth, or
a tent upon the earth: and, in short, I resolved upon both; the manner and
description of which it may not he improper to give an account of.

I soon found the place I was in was not for my settlement, particularly
because it was upon a low moorish ground, near the sea. and I believed it
would nothewholesome; and more particularly because therewns no fresh
water near it : so i resolved to find a more healthy and more convenient spot
of ground.

I consulted several things in my situation, which I found would be proper
for me: lst., Health and fresh water, I just now mentioned. 2diy., Shelter
from the heat of the sun. 8dly., Security from ravenous creatures, whether
men or beasts. "lily, A view to the sea, that, it' God sent any ship to eight,
1 might not lose any advantage for my deliverance, of which I was not
willing to banish all my expectation yet.

In search for a place proper for this, I found a little plain on the side
oi' a rising hill, whose front towards this little plain was steep as a house-
side, so that nothing could come down upon me from the top. Go the side
of this rock there was :1 hollow place, worn a little way in, like the entrance
or door of a cave; but there was not really any cave, or way into the rock
at all.

On the flat of the green, just before this hollow place, I resolved to pitch
my tent. This plain was not above a hundred yards broad, and about twice
as long, and lay like a green before my door; and, at the end of it. descendeo
irregularly every way down into the low ground by the sea-aide. It was onorl'aoat'n'son causes. ., 4.1

the N. N. W.-,aideol' the hill; so that itwassheltered from the heatevery
day, till it who to a W. and by S. sun, or thereabouts, which, in those
metrics, is near the setting.

Before I set up my tent, I drew a half-circle before the hollow place,
which took in about ten yards in its midiameter from the rock, and twenty
yards in its diameter, from its beginning and ending.

In this half-circle I pitched two rows of strong stakes, driving them into
the ground till they stood very firm like piles, the biggest end being out of
the ground about five feet and a half, and sharpened on the top. The two

rows did not stand above six inches from one another.
Then I took the pieces of cables which I cut in the ship, and laid them in

Iowa, one upon another, within the circle, between these two rows ofatakes,
up to the top, placing other stakes in the inside, leaning against them, about
two feet and a half high, like a spur to a post; and this fence was so strong,
that neither man nor beast could get into it or over it. This cost me a great
deal of time and labour, especially to out the piles in the woods, bring them
to the place, and drive them into the earth.

The entrance into this place I made to be not by a door, but by a short
ladder to go over the top; which ladder, when I was in, I lifted over afier
me; and so I was completely fenced in and fortified, as I thought, from all
the world, and consequently slept secure in the night, which otherwise
could not have done; though, as it appeared afterwards, there was no need
of all this caution from the enemies that I apprehended danger from.

Into this fence, or fortress, with infinite labour, I carried all my riches,
all my provisions, ammunitioh, and stores, of which you have the account
above; and I made a large tent, which, to preserve me from the rains that
in one part of the year are very violent there, I made double, viz, one smaller
tent within, and one larger tent above it, and covered the uppermost with a
large tarpaulin, which I had saved among the sails.

And now I lay no more for a while in the bed which I had brought on
shore, but in a hammock, which was indeed a very good one, and belonged
to the mate of the ship.

Into this tent I brought all my provisions, and every thing that would
spoil by the wet; and, having thus enclosed all my goods, I made up the
entrance, which till now 1 had left open, and so passed and repealed, as I said
by a short ladder.

When I had done this, I began to work my my into the rock, and, hung.
ing all the earth and stones that I dug down out through my tent, I laid
thorn up within my fence in the nature of a terrace, so that it raised the
ground within abouta foot and an half; and thus I made me a cave, jmt
behind my tent, which served me like a cellar to my house. It cost me
much labour and many days before all these things were brought to per-
fection; and, therefore, I must go back to some other things which took up
some of my thoughts. At the same time it happened, afler I had laid my
scheme for the setting op my tent and making the care, that a storm of rain
falling from a thirlt, dark cloud, a sudden flash of lightning happened; and,

1'5 P

i "w..--4.2 we urn AND 'Anvenrnns

alter that, a great clap of thunder, an in naturally the effect of it. I was not
so much surprised with the lightning as I was with a thought which darted
into my mind as swift as the lightning itself:-'O my powder l' My very
heart sunk within me when I thought, that, at one blast. all my powder
might be destroyed; on which, not my defence only. but the providing me
food,-as I thought, entirely depended. I was nothing near so anxious about
my own danger, though, had the powder took fire, I had never known who
had hurt me.

Such tmpl'wiol) did this make upon me, that, alter the storm was over, I
laid "suit: all my works, my building and fortifying. and applied myself to
make bags and boxes, to separate the powder, and to keep it a little and a
little in a parcel. in hope that, whatever might come, it might not all take fire
at once; and to keep it so apart, that it should not be possible to make one
part tire another. 1 finished this work in about a fortnight; and I think my
Dowdor, which in all was about 940 lb. Weight, was divided in not less than

hundred parcels. As to the barrel that had been wot, i did not apprehend
any danger from that; so i placed it in my new core, which, in my fancy,
I called my kitchen, and the rest I hid up and down in holes among the
rocks, so that no wet might come to it, marking very carefully where I
laid it.

In the interval of time while this was doing, I went out at least once every
day with my gun, as well to divert myself, as to see if I could kill any thins
fit for food; and, as near as 1 could, to acqua'uit myself with what the island
produced. The first time I went out, I presently discovered that there were
goats upon the island, which was a great satisfaction to me; but then it wan
attended with this misfortune to me, viz, that. they were so stay, so subtle,
and so swifl of foot, that it was the most difficult thing in the world to come
at them : but I was not discouraged at this, not doubting but [might now and
then shoot one, as it soon happened; for. alter I had found their haunts a
little, I laid wait in this manner for them: I observed. if they saw me to
idle valleys, though they were upon the rocks, they would run away as in a
terrible fright; but if they were feeding in the valleys, and I was upon the
rocks. they took no notice of me; from whence 1 concluded, that, by the po~
sition of their optics, their sight was so directed downward, that, they did not
readily see objects that were above them: so, allerwards, I took this method:
-----1 always climbed the rocks first, to get above them, and then had fre--
quently a fair mark. The first shot I made among these creatures, I hilleo
a she-goat, which had a little kid by her, which she gave suck to, which
grieved me heartily; but, when the old one fell, the kid stood stock still by
her till 1 came and took her up; and not only so, but when I carried the
old one with me upon my shoulders, the kid followed me quite to my en-
closure; npon which I laid down the dam, and took the kid in my arms, and
carried it over my pale, in hopes to have bred it up tame; but it would not
eat,- sol was forced to kill it, and eat it myself. The-e two supplied me with
flesh a great while, for I ate sparingly, and preserved my promons (my
bread csoecially) as much as possibly I could.or nom'mom cannon. 43

Having now fixed my habitation, I found it absolutely memory to provide
it place to make a fire in, and fuel to burn; and what I did for that, as else
how [enlarged my one, and what conveniences I made, i shall give a fun
account of in its proper place: but I must first give' some little account of
myself, and of my thoughts about living, which, it may well be supposed,
were not a few.

I had a dismal prospect of my condition; for as I was not cast away upon
that island without being driven, as in said, by a violent storm quite out of
the course of our intended voyage; and a great way, viz, some hundreds of
leagues, out of the ordinary course of the trade of mankind; I had great reason
to consider it as a determination of Heaven, that in this desolate place, and
in this desolate manner, I should end my life. The tears would run plentiv
fully down my fate when I made these reflections; and sometimes I would
expostulnte with myself why Providence should thus completely ruin it: cree-
tures, and render them no absolutely miserable, so abandoned without help,
so entirely depressed, that it could hardly be rational to be thankful for such
a life.

But something always returned swift upon me to check these thoughts,
and to reprove me: and particularly, one day, walking with my gun in my
hand, by the sea-oide, I we: very pensive upon the subject of my present
condition, when reason, as it were, expootulated with me the other way
thus: ' Well. you are in a desolate condition, it is true; but, pray remember
where are the rest of you! Did not you come eleven of you into the bout?
Where are the tent Why were not they cured, and you lost 9 Why were
you singled out? Is it better to be here or there? And then I pointed to the
see. All evils are to be considered with the good that is in them, and with
what worse attends them.

Then it occurred to me again, how well I was finished for my subsistence,
and what would have been my case if it had not happened (which was a
hundred thousand to one) that the ship floated from the place where shear-st
stmelr, and was driven so near to the share, that I had time to get all the! '
things out of her: what would have been my case, if I had been to have
lived in the condition in which I at first came on shore, without necessaries
of life, or necessaries to supply and procure them? ' Particularly,' said I aloud
(though to myselfi, ' what should 1 have done without a gun, without ammu-
nition. without any tools to make any thing, or to work with, without
clothes, bedding, a tent, or any manner of covering? and that now I had all
these to a sutficieut quantity, and was in --e fair way to provide myself in
such a manner as to live without my gun when my ammunition was spent:
so that I had a tolerable View of subsisting, without any want, as long an I
lived; for! considered, from the beginning. how I would provide for the
accidents that might happen, and for the time that was to come, not only

alter my ammunition should be spent, but even alter my health or strength
Ihould decay.

It confiesa, I had not entertained; any notion of my ammunition being do-
otroved at one blast; 1 mean. my powder being blown up by lightning; mi<<H was man arm anvnnrnnns

this made the thoughts of it ao surprising to me, when it lightened and than-
dered, as I observed just now.

And now being to enter into a melancholy relation of a scene of silentlifo
such. perhaps, as was never heard of in the world before, I new take it
from its beginning, and continue it in its order. it was, by my account, the
80th of September, when, in the manner as above said, I first net foot opal
this horrid island; when the sun, being to us in it: autumnal equinox, was a!>>
moot just overzmy head : for! reckoned myself, by observation, to hair: the
latitude of 9 degrees, 22 minutes, north of the line.

Alter I had been there about ten or twelve days, it came into my thought:
that I should lose my reckoning of time for want of books, and pen and ink,
and should even forget the sabbath days from the working dayr: but, to pre.
rent this, lent it with my knife upon a large poet, in capital letters; and,
making it into a great cross, I set it up on the shore where I first landed, viz,
" 1 came on shore here on the 80th ot'Septemher, 16' " Upon the sides
of this square post I out every day a notch with my knife, and every aeventh
notch was as long again as the rest, and every that day ofthe month as long
again as that long one: and thus I kept my calendar, or weekly, monthly
and yearly reckoning of time.

But it happened, that among the many things which {brought out of the
ship, in the several voyages which, as above mentioned, I made to it, I got
several things oiless value; but not at all less useful to me, which 1 found, some
tune after, in romaging the cheats; on, in particular, pens, ink, and paper
several parcels in the captain's, mate's, gunner's, and carpenter's keeping ;
three or four compasses, some mathematical instruments, dials, perspectives,
charts, and books of navigation; all which I huddled together, whether I
might want them or no: also I found th'e very good Bibles, which come
to me in my cargo from England, and which I had packed 11}. among my
things; some Portuguese books also. and, among them, two or three popish
prayer-books, and several other books, all which I carefully secured. And
I must not forget that we had in the ship a dog, and two cats, ofwhooe
eminent history I may have occasion to say something in its place 3 far
carried both the cats with me 2 and as for the dog, he jumpedont of the ship
himself, and warn on shore to me the day otter I went on shore with my
first cargo, and was a trusty servant to me for many years: I wanted no
thing that he could fetch me, nor any company that he could make optome'
I only wanted to have him talk to me, but that would not do. As} on}
carved before, I found pens, ink. and paper, and I huebanded mam to the
otnmt; and lahall shew, that, while my ink looted, I kept things very exact
but after that was gone I could not; for I could not make any ink by any
means that I could devise.

And this put me in mind that I wanted many things, notwithstanding all
that l hadamaaaed together; andoftheee, this otinkwuone; as also a
spade, pick-axe, and shovel, to dig or remove the earth; needles pins, and
thread: as for linen, I seen learnt to want that without much dificuity.'

This want of tools made every work I did go on heavily , and itwa our

Upon tbe'ivhole; here was an undoubted testimony that theiems scsrce'

or something positive, to be thankful for in it: and let this stand as a direc-
tion, from the experience of the most miserable of all conditions in this
world, that we may always find in it something to comfort ourselves from,
and t6 set, in the description of good and evil, on the credit side of the ac-
count.

Having now brought my mind a little to relish my condition, and given
over looking out to sea, to see if I could spy a ship; I say, giving over these
things, I began to apply myself to accommodate my way of living, and to
make things as easy to me as I could.

I have already described my habitation, which was a tent under the side of a
rock, surrounded with a strong pale of posts and cables; but I might now rather
call it a wall, for I raised a kind of wall against it of turfs, about two feet
thick on the outside: and, after some time (I think it was a year and a half),
I raised rafters from it, leaning to the rock, and thatched or covered it with
boughs of trees, and such things as I could get, to keep out the rain; which
I found, at some times of the year, very violent.

I have already observed how I brought all my goods into this pale, and
into the cave which I had made behind me. But I must observe, too: that
at first this was a confused heap of goods, which, as they lay in no order,
so they took up all my place; I had no room to turn myself: so I set myself
to enlarge my cave, and work farther into the earth ; for it was a looue sandy
rock, which yielded easily to the labour I bestowed on it: and, when I
found I was pretty safe as to the beasts of prey, I worked sideways, to the
right: hand, into the rock, and then, turning to the right again, worked
quite out, and made me a door to come out in the outside of my pale or for.
tification.

This gave me not only egress and regress, as it were, a back way to my
tent and to my storehouse, but gave me room to stow my goods.

And now I began to apply myself to make such necessary things as I
found I most wanted, particularly a chair and a table; for without these I
was not able to enjoy the few comforts I had in the world: I could not
write, or eat, or do several things with so much pleasure, without a table;
so I went to work. And here 1 must needs observe, that as reason is the
substance and original of the mathematics, so, by stating and squaring every

thing by reason, and by making the most rational judgment of things, every .
man may be, in time, master of every mechanic art. I had never handled '
a tool in my life; and yet, in time, by labour, application, and contrivance, .

I found, at last, that I wanted nothing but 1 could have made, especially if I
had had tools. However, I made abundance of things, even without tools;
and some with no more tools than an adze and a hatchet, which, per-
hapa were never made that way before, and thatlwith infinite labour. For
example, if I wanted a board, I had no other way but to cut down a tree,
set it on an edge before me, and hew it flat on either side with my axe, till
I had brought it to be as thin as a plank, and then dub it smooth with my
adze. It is true, by this method [could make but one board of a whole
tnee ' but this I had no remedy for but patience, any more than! had to! a9 or sosxasoa'cnnsos. .' ' ' 47

prodigiomdealottimesndlabourwhich ittook meuptomakeaplankor
board: but mytime or labourwas little worth.snd soitwas aswell em-
ployed one way as another.

However, I made me a table and a chair, as I observed above, in the first
place; and this I did out of the short pieces of boards that I brought on my
rafi from the ship. But when l wrought out some boards, as above, I made
large shelves of the breadth of a foot and a half, one over another, all along
one side of my cave, to lay all my tools, nails, and iron-work on; and, in a
word, to separate every thing at large in their places, that I might easily
come at them. I knocked pieces into the wall of the rock, to hang my guns,
and all things that would hang up: so that, had my cave been seen, it looked
like a general magazine of all necessary things; and I had every thing so
ready at my hand, that it was a great pleasure to me to see all my goods in
such order, and especially to find my stock of all necessaries so great.

And now it was that I began to keep a journal of every day's employ-
ment; for, indeed, at first, I was in too much hurry, and not only hurry as
to labour, but in much discomposure of mind; and my journal would, too,
have been full of many dull things: for example, I must have said thus:--
' Sept. 80th. After I had got to shore, and escaped drowning, instead of
being thankful to God for my deliverance, having first vomited, with the
great quantity of salt water which was gotten into my stomach, and recover-
ing myself a little, 1 ran about the shore, wringing my ha'uds and beating
my head and face, exclaiming at my misery, and crying out I was undone,
undone! till, tired and faint, I was forced to lie down on the ground to re-
poae; but anst not sleep, for fear of being defoured.'

Some days after this, and afier I had been on board the ship, and got all
that I could out of her, I could not forbear getting up to the top of a little
mountain, and looking out to sea, in hopes of seeing a ship: then fancy that,
ats vast distance, 1 spied a sail, please myself with the hopes of it, and,
aher looking steadily till I was almost blind, lose it quite, and lit down and
weep like a child, and thus' increase my misery by my folly.

But, having gotten over these things' in some measure, and having settled
my household stnfi' and habitation, made me a table and chair, and all as-
handsome about me as I could, I began to keep my journal: of which I
shall. here give you the copy (though in it will be told all these particulars
over again) as long as it lasted; for, having no more ink, I was forced to'
leave it of. ~

THE JOURNAL.

September 80th, 1659. I, poor miserable Robinson Crusoe, being ship-
wrecked, during a dreadful storm in the oiling, came on shore on this dismal>>
unfortunate island, which] called the Isuzu) or Dasrna; all the rest of
the ship's company being drowned, and myself almost dead. -

All the rest-of that day I spent in afllicting myself at the dismal circum-
shnces I was brosghtto, Viz, I had neither food, house, clothes, weapon,'
nor place to By to: and,'in despair of any reliet; saw nothing but death he- .

fore the; that I should either be devoured by wild beasts. murderedJy
savages, or starved to death for want of food. At the approach of mght I
slept in a tree for fear of wild creamres; but slept soundly, though it ramed
all night.

October 1. In the morning, I saw, to my great surprise, the ship had
floated with the high tide, and was driven on shore again, much nearer the
island; which, as it was some comfort on one hand (for, seeing her sit up-
right, and not broken in pieces, I hoped, if the wind abated, I might get on
board, and get some food and necessaries out of her for my relief), so, on the
other hand, it renewed my grief at the loss of my comrades, who, I imagined,
if we had all stayed on board, might have saved the ship, or, at least, that
they would not have been all drowned, as they were; and that, had the men
been saved, we might, perhaps, have built us a boat out of the ruins of the
ship, to have carried us to some other part of the world. I spent great part
of this day in perplexing myself on these things; but, at length, seeing the
ship almost dry, I went upon the sand as near as I could, and then swam of
board. This day also it continued raining, though with no ward at all.

From the 1st of October to the 24th. All these days entirely spent in
many several v0yages to get all I could out of the ship; which I brought
on shore, every tide of flood, upon rails. Much rain also in these days,
though with some intervals of fair weather: but, it seems, this was the rainy
season.

Oct. 20. I over-set my rail, and all the goods I had got upon it; but, being
in shoal water, and the things being chiefly heavy, I recovered many of
them when the tide was out.

Oct. 25. It rained all night and all day, with some gusts of wind; during
which time the ship broke in pieces (the wind blowing a little harder than
before), and was no more to be seen, except the wreck of her, and that only
at low water. I spent this day in covering and securing the goods which I
had saved, that the rain might not spoil them.

' Oct. 26. I walked about the shore almost all day, to find out a place to
fix my habitation; greatly concerned to secure myself from any attack in
the night, either from wild beasts or men. Towards night I fixed upon a
proper place, under a rock, and marked out a semicircle for my encamp-
ment; which I resolved to strengthen with a work, wall, or fortifi ' ,
made of double piles, lined within with cables, and without with turf.-

From the 26th to the 80th, I worked very hard in carrying all my goods
to my new habitation, though some part of the time it ramed exceedmgy
hard. .- .

The Slat, in the morning, I went out into the island vnth .1113 gun, to see
for some food, and discover the country- , when I killed sshe-goat, and her
kid followed me home, which 1 afterwards killed also, became it would not
feed.

November 1.1 set up my tent under a rock, and. lay therefor the first
night; making it as large as I could, with stakes driven in, to swing my
hammock upon.

began-to consider how to supply mane-wants, and make me some tools. . <<A:
for a pick-axe, I made use of the iron mm, which were proper enongh,
though heavy: but the next thing was a shovel or spade , this was so eh.
aoln'tely necessary, that, indeed, I could do nothing efi'ectmliy without it;
but what kindofonetomakei knew not. '

Nov. 18. The next day, in watching thewooda. 1 found a tree ,ofthat
wood, or like it, which, in the Emile, they call the ironottee, from its on:
ceeding hardness: of "tie, with great labour, and almost spoiling my axe, I
out a piece; and brought it home, too. with difiicnlty enough, for it was
exceeding heavy. The excessive hardness of the wood, and my hazing no
other way, made me a long while upon this machine: for! worked itefi'cc'
toaliy, by little and little into the form of a ohovel or spade ; the handle
exactly shaped like ours in England. only that the broad port having no icon v
shod upon it at bottom, it would not last me to long: however, it served
well enough for the nee: which I had occasion to put it to; but now; was a
shovel, I believe, made after that fashion, or so long a--making. .

I was still deficient: for I wanted a basket, or a wheel~bemw. A basket
I could not make by any means. having no such things as twige that would
bend to make" wicker-ware; ot least, none yet found out: and, an to the
wheel-barrow, l fancied 1 could make all but the wheel, but that I had no
action of; neither did i know how to go about it: besides, I had no [Jo-able
way to make iron godgcom for the spindle or exit of the wheel to run in:
so 1 gave it over : and, for carrying away the earth which 1 dog not of the
cave. I made me a thing like a bed, which the labourer: carry room: in
for the bricklayer; This was not so difficult to me a: the melting the
shovel : and yet this 'and the above}, and the attempt which I made in vain
to make'a'wheelvbemw, tool: me no no less than four days; I mean, al-
wayo excepting- my morning walk with my gun, which Ioeldotn omitted,
and very seldom failed also bringing home something fit to eat. ,

was very well ldrd so, as may he observed hereatter, upon a very remarkable
occasion.

During this time I made my rounds in the woods for game every dey, ,
when the rain permitted me. and made frequent discoveries, in these walks,
of something or other to my advantage; particularly. I found a kind ufwild

Besides this barley, there were, as above, twenty or thirty stalks of rice,
which I preserved with the same care; and whose use was'of the same kind,
or to the same purpose, viz., to make me bread, or rather foodi for I found
ways to cook it up without baking, though I did that also after some time.--
But to return to my journal.

I worked excessively hard these three or four months, to get my wall
done; and the 14th of April I closed it up ; contriving to get into it,'not by
a door, but over the wall, by a ladder, that there might be no sign on the
outside of my habitation.

April 16. I finished the ladder; so I went up with the ladder to the top,
and then pulled it up alter me, and let it down in the inside. This was a com-
plete enclosure to me; for within I had room enough; and nothing could
come at me from without, unless it could first mount my wall.

The very next day after this wall was finished I had almost all my labour
- overthrown at once, and myself killed. The case was thus :--As I was busy
in the inside of it, behind my tent, just at the entrance into my cave, I was
terribly frightened with a most dreadful surprising thing indeed; for, all on
a sudden, I found the earth come crumbling down from the roof of my care,
and from the edge of the hill over my head, and two of the posts I had set
up in the cave cracked in a frightful manner. I was heartily scared; but
thought nothing of what really was the cause, only thinking that the top of
my cave was falling in, as some of it had done before: and, for fear I should
be buried in it, I ran forward to my ladder; and, not thinking myself safe
there neither, I got over my wall, for fear of the pieces of the hill, which I
expected might roll down upon me. I had no sooner stepped down upon
the firm ground, than I plainly saw it ws..~ a ternole earthquake: for the
ground I stood on shook three times, at about eight minutes' distance with
three such shocks as would have overturned the strongest building that could
be supposed to have stood on the earth; and a great piece of the top of a
rock, which stood about half a mile from me, next the sea, fell down with
such a terrible noise as I never heard in all my life. I perceived also that
the very sea was put into a violent motion by it; and I believe the shocks
were stronger under the water than on the island.

I was so much amazed with the thing itself (having never felt the like nor
disarursed with any one that had) that I Was like one dead or stnpified; and
the motion of the earth made my stomach sick, like one that was tossed at
see: but the noise of the falling of the rock awaited me, as it were; and,
rousing ine from the stupified condition I was in, filled me with homgand
I thought of nothing but the hill falling upon my tent and my household goods,
and burying all at once: this sunk my very soul within me a second time.

-' After the third shock was over, and I felt no more for some time, I'begsn
to take courage; yet I had not heart enough to go over my wall again, for
rm of being buried alive, but 'sst still upon the ground, greatly east down
and diwonsolate, not knowing what to do. All this while I had not the least

came into my thoughts, that these winds and rainbeing the consequence at
the earthquake, the earthquake itself was spent and over, and I might venture
into my cave ag'aiu. With this thought my spirits began to revive; end the
rain also helping to persuade me, I went in, andsat down in my tent; but
the rain was so violent, that my tent was ready to be,.beatendown with it;
and I was forced to get into my cave, though very much afraid and uneasy,
for fear it should fall on my head. This violent rain forced me to _a new
work, viz, to cut a hole through my new fortificstion, likes sink,to let: the
water go out, which would else have drowned my cave. After I had been
in my cave for some time, and found no more shocks of the earthquake fol-
low, I began to be more composed. And now to support my spirits, which
indeed wanted it very much, I went to my little store, and took a small sup
of rum; which, however, I did then, and always very sparingly, knowing I
could have 'no more when that was gone. Itcontinued. raining all that night,
and great part of the next day, so that I could not stir abroad; but, my mind
being more composed, I began to think of whatI had'best do; concluding.
that, if the island was subject to these earthquakes, there wouldlbe no living
for me in a cave, but I must consider of building me some little but in an
open place, which I might surround with a wall, as I had done here, and so
make myself secure from wild beasts or men: for, iflstaid where! was, I
should certainly, one time or other, be buried alive. ~ -

With these thoughts I resolved to remove my tent from the place where
it now stood, being just under the hanging precipice of the hill, and. which,
it'it should be shaken again, would certainly fall upon my .tent- I qpcnt the
two next days, being the 19th and son: of April, in contriving where and
how to remove my habitation. The fear of being swallowtail alive afi'ected
me so, that I never slept in quiet; and yet the apprehensioarof lying abroad,
without any fence, was almost equal to it: but still, when Ilooked shout,
and saw how every thing was put In order, how pleasantly Iwasunpealed,

I saw something lie on the shore bigger than ordinary, and it looked like n

When loeme down to the ship, I found it strangely removed. The {one

by this violence. the ship wss more broke open than formerly, so my things

This wholly diverted my thoughts from the design of removing my babe

May 3. I began with my saw, and cut a piece ofa beam through, which
I thought- held some of the upper part, or. quarter-deck, together; and, '
when I had it cut through, I cleared away the sand as well as I could from
the side which lay highest; but, the tide coming in, I Was obliged to give
over for that time.

May 4. I went a-fishing, but caught not one fish that I durst eat of, till I
was weary of my sport; when, just going to leave 05', I caught a young dol-
phin. I had made me a long line of some rope-yarn, butl had no hooks;
yet I frequently caught fish enough, as much as I cared to eat; all which I
dried in the wand ate them dry. . .

May5. Workedon the wreck; cut another beam asunder, and brought
three great fir-planks off from the decks; which I tied together, and made
swim on shore when the tide of flood came on.

May 6. Worked on the wreck; got sevens] iron bolts out of her, and
other pieces of iron-work: worked very hard, and came home very much
tired, and had thought: of giving it over.

May 7. Went to the wreck again, but not with an intent to work: but
found the weight of the wreck had broke itself down, the beams being'cut;
that several pieca of the ship seemed to lie loose; and the inside of the hold
lay so open that I could see into .it; but almost full of water and sand.

May 8. Went tothe wreck, and carried an iron crow to wrench up the
deck, which lay now quite clear of the water and sand. I wrenched up two
planks, and brought them on shore also with the tide. I left the iron crow
in the wreck for next day.

Mag9.' Wenttothe wreck, and with the crow madewayinto the body
of the wreck, and felt several casks, and loosened 'them with the crow, but
could not break them up. I felt alsoa roll ofEnglish lead, and could stirit;
but it was too heavy to remove.

' May lo__to l4. Went every day tothe wreck; andgot a greatmany pieces
of timber and boards, or plank, and two or; three hundred weight of iron.

May 15,. I carried two hatchets, to try ifI_could not out a piece ofi'the
roll of lead, by placing the edge of one hatcheganddriving it with the other;
but, as itlag about a foot and ahalfinthewater,'lcou1dnot make any blow
to drive the hatchet.

May 16. It had blown hard in the night, and the wreck appeared more
broken by- the. force ofthewater; but Istaid so long 1n the woods, toget pio
scorn for food, that the tide prevented my going to the wreck that day.

May 17. I saw some pieces of the wreck'blown on shore, at a great dis-
tance, two miles of me, but resolved tolsee what they were, and found it
was a piece of the head," but too heavy for me to bring away.

May 24. Every day, to this day, I worked on the wreck; and with hard
labour I loosened some things so much with the crow, that the first blowing

plank, andiron-work, enough to have'built a good boat, if I had known
how: and lalso got, at several timeo, and in several pieces, near one hundred
weight of the sheet-lead.

June 16. Going down to the sea-side, I found a large tortoise. or turtle.
This was the first I had seen; which, it seems, was only my misfortune, not
any defect of the place, or scarcity : for, bad I happened to be on the other
side of the island, I might have had hundreds of them every day, as I fodod
afterwards ; but perhaps had paid dear enough for them.

June 17 I spent in cooking the turtle. 'I found in her three ecore eggs:
and her flesh was to me, at that time, the most savoury and pleasant that I
ever tasted in my life; having had no flesh, but of goats and fowls, since I
landed in this horrid place.

June 18. Rained all that day, and I staid within. I thought. at this time,
the rain felt cold, and {was somewhat chilly; which I knew was not usual

again, I was shipwrecked, ruined. and in danger ofdrowning. on this island,
I was as far from remorse, or looking on it as a judgment: I only said
to myself often, that I was an unfortunate dog, and born to be always
miserable.

It is true, when] tlrst got on shore here, and found all my ship's crew
drowned, and myself spared, I was surpnsed with a kind of ecstasy, and
some transports of soul, which, had the grace ofGod assisted, might have
-come up to true thankfulness: but it ended where it began, in a mere com-
mon flight of joy; or, as I may say, being glad I was alive, without the least
reflection upon the distinguished goodness of the hand which had preserved
me, and had singled me out to be pmerved when all the rat were destroyed;
or an inquiry why Providence had been thus merciful to me: just the same
'common sort of joy which seamen generally have, alter they have got safe
ashore from a shipwreck; which they drown all in the next bowl of punch,-
and forget almost as soon as it is over: and all the rest of my life was like it.~
Even when I was afterwards, on due consideration, made sensible of my con-
dition,----how I was cast on this dreadful place, out of the reach of human kind,
out of all hape of relief, or prospect of redempfiom--as soon as I saw but
a prospect of living, and that I should not starve and perish for hunger, all
the sense of my afiliction wore otf, and I began to be very easy, applied my-
self to the works proper for my preservation and supply, and was far enough
from being afflicted at my condition, as a judgment from Heaven, or as the
hand of God against me: these were thoughts which very seldom entered
into my head.

The growing up of the corn, as is hinted in my journal, had, at first, some
little influence upon me, and began to afl'ect me with seriousness, as long as
I thought it had something miraculous in it; but, as soon as that part of the
thought was removed, all the impression which was raised from it wore ofi'
also, as I have noted already. Even the earthquake, though nothing could be
more terrible in its nature, or more immediately directing to the invisible
Power which alone directs such things, yet, no sooner was the fright over.
but the impression it had made went off also. I had no more sense of God
or his judgments, much less of the present afiiction of my circumstances
being from his hand, than if I had been in the most prosperous condition of
life But now, when I began to be sick, and a leisure View of the miseries
of death came to place itself before me; when my spirits began to sink under
the burden of a strong distemper, and nature was exhausted with the
violence of the fever; conscience, that had slept so long, began to awake;
and I reproacbed myself with my past life, in which I had so evidently, by
uncommon 'vvickedness, provoked the justice of God to lay me under un-
common strokes, and to deal with me in so vindictive a manner. These re-
flections oppressed me for the second or third day of my distemper; and in
the violence, as well of the fever as of the dreadful reproaches of my cou-
science, extorted from me some words like praying to God: though I cannot
say it was a prayer attended either with desires or with hopes; it was rather
the voice of mere fright and distress. My thoughts were confused; theor 30313501! cannon. 61

convictions'great upon my' mind; and the horror ofdying in each a mans.
ble condition raised vapours in my head with the mere apprehension : and,
inthese hurriesot' my soul, I knewnot what my tongue might exprem: but it
was rather exclamation, such'as, ' Lord. what a miserable creature am I!
If I should be sick, I shall certainly die for wadt of help; and whatwill be-
come of met' Then the tears burst out of my eyes, and 1 could say no
more for a good while. In this interval, the good advice of my father came
to my mind, and presently his predieion, which I mentioned at the be-
ginning of this story, viz, that, if I did take this foolish strap, God would not
bless me; and I should have leisure hereafter to reflect upon having ne-
glected his counsel, when there might be none to must in my recovery.
' Now,' said I aloud, ' my dear father's words are come to pass; God's jus-
tice has overtaken me, and I have none to help or hear me. I rejected the
voice of Providence, which had mercifully put me in a station of life wllrein
I might have been happy and easy; but I would neither see it myself, nor
learn fr0m my parents to know the blesing of'it. I left them to mourn
over my folly; and now I am let! to mourn under the consequence-01in I
refused their help and assistance, who would have pushed me in the world,
and would have made every thing easy to me; and now I have difliculties'
to struggle with, too great for even nature itself to support; and no assist-
ance, no comfort, no advice!' Then I cried out, ' Lord! be my help, for I_
am in great distress.' This was the first prayer, if I may call it so, that I
had made for many years. But I return to my journal.

June 28. Having been somewhat refreshed with the sleep I had had,
and the fit being entirely oil; I got up; and, though the fright and terror
of my dream was very great, yet I considered that the fit of the ague would
return again the 'next day, and now was my time to get something to refresh
and support myself when I should be ill. The first thing I did was'to till a
large square case-bottle with water, and set it upon my table, in reach of
my bed: and, to take off the chill or aguish disposition of the water, Ipnt
about a quarter of a pint of rum into it, and mixed them together. Then I
got me a piece of the goat's flesh, and broiled it on the coals, but could eat
very little. I walked about; but was very weak, and withal very sad and
heavy-hearted in the sense of my mherable condition, dreading the return
of my distemper the next day. At night, I made my supper of three ofthe
'tnrtle's eggs: which I roasted in the ashes, and ate, alwe call :it, in the
shell: and this was the first bit of meat I had ever asked God's blessing to,
asI could remember, in my whole life. Afler I had eaten, I tried to walk;
but found myself soweak, that Iconld hardly carry the gun (for I never
went out without that), so I went but a little way, and sat down upon" the
ground, looking out upon the sea, which was just before me, and very calm
and smooth. As I sat here, some such thoughts as these occnfledtiue:
'Whatisthisearth andsea, ofwhichlhaveseenso much! Whetieefih't
prodnoed? Andwhat am 1, andallthe other ueatnregwild and heme,
humanandl Bridal? Whenceare we? Surely we are allmadehy'sume
'secne'fl'ower,' 'v'ilmformedtheearthandsea, theairandsky. Andwho,"
thstt' Then it followed, most naturally, 'It is God that has made all.
Well, but then,.it came on strangely, if God has made all these things, he
guides and governs them all, and all things that concern them; for the
Power that could make all things must seminly have power to guide and
direct them: if so, nothing can happen in the great circuit of his works,
either without his knowledge or appointment.

' And if nothing happens without his knowledge, he knows that I am
here, and am in this dreadful condition: and, if nothing happen: without
his appointment, be lies appointed all this to befall me.' Nothing occurred
to my thought, to contradict any of these conclusions; and therefore it
rested upon me with the greatest force, that it must needs be that God had
appointed all this to befall me; that l was brought to this miserable cit-cum:
stance by his direction, be having the sole power, not of me only,'but of
every thing that happens in the world. Immediately it followed, ' Why
has God done this to me? What have 1 done to he thus used 3' My con-
science presently checked me in that inquiry, as if I had blasphemed ; and
methouglit it spoke to me like a voice, ' Wretch! dost than ask what
thou hast done ? Look back upon a dreadful mispent life. and ask thyself
what thou hast not done? Ask, Why is it that thou west not long ago
destroyed? Why wen-t thou not drowned in Yarmouth roads; killed in
the fight when the Ship was taken by the Sallee man of war; devoured
by the wild beasts on the coast of Africa; or drowned here, when all the
crew perished but thyself? Dost thou ask what thou hast done? I was
struck dumb with these reflections, as one astonished, and had not a word
to say; no, not to answer to myself; and, rising up, pensive and sad, walked
back to my retreat, and went over my wall as if I had been going to bed :
but my thoughts were sadly disturbed, and I had no inclination to sleep; so
I sat down in the chair, and lighted my lamp, for it began to be dark. Now,
as the apprehension of the return of my distemper terrified me very much,
it occurred to my thought that the Brazilians take no physio but their to-
bacco for aim all distempem; and I bad a piece of a. roll of tobaccom
one of the chests, which was quite cured; and some also that was green,
and not quite cured

I went, directed by Heaven, no doubt: for in this chart I found a cure
hoth tor soul and body. 1 opened the chest, and found what I looked for,
viz, the tobacco, and, as the few books I had saved lay there too, I tool:
out one of the Bible: which I mentioned before, and which to this time 1 had
not found leisure, or so much as inclination, to look into. I my, I took it
out, and brought both that and the tobacco with me to the table. What
use to make of the tobacco I knew not, as to my distemper, nor whether it
was good for it or not; but I tried several experiments with it. as if I was
reached it should hit one way or other. I first took a piece of a leaf, and
chewed it in my month; which, indeed, at first, almost stupified my brain;
the tobacco being green and shong, and such as I bod not been much used
to. Then I took some, and steeped it an hour or two in some ram, and re-

solved to take a time of it when I lay clown: end, My, I "wiggle "2?,"or noeixsbx Chilton. 63

disturbed with the tobacco to hear reading, at telnet at that time; only, having
opened the book usually, the first words that occurred to me were these:-
' Call on me in the day of trouble, and I w'ill deliver thee, and thou shalt
glorify me.' Theeewoxds were verynpt tony case; and made some im-
preasloh upon my thoughts at the time of reading then), though not so much
as they did afterwards; for. as for being activated, the word had no mood,
as I may say, to me; the thing Wat so mmote, to impossible, in my appne-

not for many years that any hops appeared, this prevailed very often upon
my thoughts: but, however, the word: made a great impression upon me,
and I mused upon them very often. It now grew late; and the tobacco
had, as! said, dazed 111de so much, that I inclinedtoale'ep: so I left
my lamp bathing in the cove, test I should want any thing in the night, and
went to bed. But, before I lay down, I did what I never had done in all my
life; I kinda! down and prayed to God to fulfil the promise to me, that, if
I called upon him in the day of trouble, he would deliver me. After my
broken and imperfect prayer woe over, I drank the rum in which I had.'
steeped the teem; 'which was so strong and rank of the tobacco, that. in-

July, as] hoped I should have been; for I had alittle of the cold tit, but
it was not much.

_July 2. I renewed the medicine all' the three ways, and dosed myself
with it as at first, and doubled the quantity which I drank.

July 3. I missed the lit for good and all. though I did not recover my
full strength for some weeks afler. While Iwas thus gathering strength, my
thoughts ran exceedingly upon this scripture, ' I will deliver thee ;' and
the impossibility of my deliverance lay much upon my mind, in bar of my
ever expecting it: but, as I was discouraging myself with such thoughts, it
occurred to my mind that I pored so much upon my deliverance from the
main affliction, that I disregarded the deliverance I had received; and I
was, as it were, made to ask myself such questioas as these, viz: 'Have I not
been delivered, and wonderfully too, from sickness; from the most distressed
condition that could be, and that was so frightful to me? and what notice
have I taken of it? Have Idone my part? God has delivered me, but I have
not glorified him; that is to say, I have not owned and been thankful for
that as a deliverance: and how can I expect a greater deliverance 2' This
touched my heart very much; and immediately I knelt down, and gave
God thanks aloud for my recovery from my sickness. e

July 4. In the morning I took the Bible; and, beginning at the New
Testament, I began seriously to read it; and imposed upon myself to read
awhile every morning and every night; not binding myself to the number
of chapters, but as longfas my thoughts should engage me. It was not long
alter I set seriously to this work that I found my heart more deeply and
sincerely afl'ected with the wickedness of my past life. The impression of
my dream revived; and the words 'All these things have not brought thee
to repentance' ran seriously in my thoughts. I was earnestly hegging of
God to give me repentance, when it happened providentially, the very same
day, that, reading the scripture, I came to these words: ' He is exalted a
Prince and a Saviour, to give repentance, and to give remission) I threw
down the book; and with my heart as well as my hands lifted-up toheaven.
in a kind of ecstasy of joy, I cried out aloud, 'Jesus, thou Son of David!
Jesus, thou exalted Prince and Saviour! give me repentance? This was the
first time in all my life I could say, in the true sense of the words, that I
prayed; for now I prayed with asense of my conditioa,.and with a true
scripture view fof hope, founded on the encouragement of the word of
God: and from thistime, I may say,_l began to have hope that God would
hear me. .

Now I began to construe the words mentioned above, ' Call on me: and
I will deliver thee,' in a difl'erent sense from what I had ever done before;

for then I had no notion of any thing being called deliverance but my being
delivered from the captivity I was in: for, though I was indeed at large in
the place, yet the island was certainly a prison tome, and that in the worst
sense _in the world. But now I learned to take it in another sense : now I

looked back upon my pm life with such horror, and my new 9deg -. '

dreadful, that my soul sought nothing of God but deliverance from the load
of guilt that bore down all my comfort. As for my sdlitary life, it was no-
thing; I did not so much as pray to be delivered from it, or think of it 3 it
was all of no consideration, in comparison with this. And I add this part-
here, to hint to whoever shall read it, that, whenever they eometo a true
sense of things, they will find deliverance from sin a much greater blessing
than deliverance from aflliction. But, to return to my journal.

My condition began now to be, though not less muerable as to my way
of living, yet much easier to my mind: and my thoughts being directed, by
constantly reading the scripture and praying to God, to things of a higher
nature, I had a great deal of comfort within, which, till now, I knew no-
thing of; also, as my health and strength returned, I bestirred me tofurnish
myself with every thing that I wanted, and make my way of living as
regular as I could.

From the 4th of July to the 14th, I was chiefly employed in walking
about with my gun in my hand, a little and a little ata time, as a man that

was gathering up his strength alter a fit of sickness: for it is hardly to ,be .

imagined how low I was, and to what weaknms I was reduced. The appli-
cation which I made use of was perfectly new, and perhaps what had never
cured an ague before; neither can 1 recommend it to any one to practise
by this experiment: and though it did carry off the (it, yet it rather con.
tnbuted to weakening me; for I had frequent convulsions in my nerves and
limbs for some time: I learned from it also this. in particular, that being
_.abroad to the rainy season was the most pernicious thing to' my health that
could be, especially' in those rains which came attended with storms and"
hurricanes of wind; for, as the rain which came in the dry season was
almost always accompanied with such storms, so I' found that this rain

was much more dangerous than the rain which fell in September and _.

- October.

I had now been in this unhappy island above ten months: all possibility
of deliverance, from this condition seemed to be entirely taken from me;
and I firmly believed that "no human shape had ever set foot upon that place.
Having secured my habitation, as I thought, fiilly to my mind, I hsds great
desire. to make it more perfect discovery of the island, and to see what other
productions I might find, which I yet knew nothing of.

It was on the 15th 01me that I beganto take a more particular survey
of the island melt; I went up the creek first, where, as I hinted, I brought
my rat's on shore. I found, after I came about two miles up.thst the tide did
not flow any higher; and that it was no more than a little brook ofrun-
lung water, very freehand good. but this being the dry seaan. there was

understanding about, and that might, perhaps, have virtues of their own.
which I could not find out. I searched for the comm root, which the
Indians, in all that climate. make their bread of. but I could find none. .I
new large plants or aloes, but did not understand them. I saw several sugar-
canes. but wild; and, for want of cultivation, imperfect. I contented myself
with these discoveries for this time; and came back, musing with myself
what course l might take to know the virtue and goodness of any of the
fruits or plants which I should discover; but could bring it to no couclusion 3
for, in short, I had made so little observation while I was in the Bmziln,
that! knew little of the plants in the field; at least, very little that might
serve me to any purpose now in my distress.

The next day, the Kill), I went up the some way again; and, alter going
something farther than i had gone the day before. I found the brook and the
sawmnahs begin to cease, and the country become more woody than before.
hi this part I found dilferent fruits; and particularly! found melons upon
the ground, in great abundance, and grapes upon the trees.- the vines, in-
deed, had spread over the trees, and the clusters of grapes were now just in
their prime, very ripe and rich. This was a surprising discovery, and I was
exceedingly glad of them; but I was warned by my experience to eat
sparingly of them; remembering, that, when I was ashore in Barbary, the
eating of grapes killed several of our Englishmen, who were slaves there, by
throwing them into fluxes and levers. I found, however, an excellent usefor
these grapes; and that was, to cure or dry them in the sun, and keep them
, as dried grapes or raisins are kept; which I thought would be (as indeed
they were) as wholesome and as agreeable toeat. when no grapes were to
be had. '

I spent all that evening there, and went not back to my habitation ; which,
by the way, was the first night, as I might say, i had lain from home. A:
night, I took my first contrivance, and got up into a tree, where l slept well;
and the next morning proceeded on my discovery, travelling near four miles,
as I might judge by the length of the valley; keeping still due north, with
a ridge of hills on the southern! north sides of me. At the end ofthis match
I came to on opening, where the country seemed to descend tothe west;
and a little spring of fresh water, which issued out of the side of the hill by
me, ran the other way, that is, due east; and the country appeared to fresh,
so green, so flourishing, every thing being in a constant rerdure, or flourish
of spring, that it looked like a planted garden. I descended a little on the
side of that delicious vale, surveying it with a secret kind of pleasure (though
mixed with other afilicting thoughts), to think that this was all my own;
that I was king and lord of all this country indefeasibly, and had a right of
possession; and, if I could convey it. I might have it in inheritance as com-
pletely as any lord of a manor in England. [saw here abundanceof cocoa-
trees, and orange, lemon, and citroo trees; but all wild, and very few bearing
any fruit; at least not then. However, the green limes that l gathered
were not only pleasant to eat, but very wholesome; and I mixed their juice
. memards with hater, which made it very wholesome, and very cool and
refreshing. I found now I had business enough to gather and carry home;
and I resolved to lay up a store, as well of grapes as limes and lemons, to
furnish myself for the wet season, whichl knew was approaching. In order
to this, I gathered a great heap of grapes in one place, a lesser heap in
another place, and a great parcel of limes and melons in another place; and,
taking a few of each with me, I travelled homeward; and resolved to come
again, and bring a bag or sack, or what I could make, to carry the nest home.
Accordingly, having spent three days in this journey, I came home (sol must
now call my tent and my cave): but, before I got thither, the grapes were
spoiled; the richness of the fruits. and the weight of the juice, having broken
and bruised them, they were good for little or nothing : as to the limes, they
were good, but I could bring only a few.

The next day, being the 191b, [ went back, having made me two small
bags to bring home my harvest; but I was surprised, when, coming to my
heap of grapes, which were so rich and fine when I gathered them, I found
them all spread about, trod to pieces, and dragged about, some here, some
there, and abundance eaten and devoured." By this I concluded there were
some wild creatures thereabouts which had done this, but what they were I
knew not. However, as I found there was no laying them up in heaps, and
no carrying them away in a sack ; but that one way they would be destroyed,
and the other way they would be crushed with their own weight; Itook
another course. I then gathered a large quantity of the grapes, and hung
them upon the out-branches of the trees, that they might cure and dry in the
sun; and, as for the limes and lemons, 1 carried asmany back as I could
well stand unde .

When I came home from this journey, I contemplated with great plea-
sure the fruitfulneas of that valley, and the pleasantness of the situation;
the security from storms on that side; the water and-the wood: and con.
cluded that 1 had pitched upon a place to fix my abode In, which was by
far the worst_part of the country. Upon the whole, I began to consider of
removing my_habitation, and to look out for a place equally safe as where I
was now situate; if possible, in that pleasant fruitful part of the island.

' This thought ran long in my head; and I was exceeding fond of it for
some time, the pleasantness of the place tempting me: but when I came to
a nearer view of it, I considered that I was now by the sea-side, where it
was at least possible that something might happen to my advantage, and, by
the same ill fate that" brought me hither, might bring some other unhappy
wretches to the same place; and, though it was scarce probable that any
such thing should ever happen, yet to enclose myself among the hills and
woods in the centre of the island was to anticipate my bondage, and to,
render such an affair not only improbable, but impossible; and that, there.
fore, I ought not by any means to remove. However, I was so enamored
of this place, that I spent much of my time there for the whole remainipg
part of the month of July. and though, upon second thoughts, I resolved,- as
above stated, not to remove , yet I built me a little kind of a bower, and68 rue mgr; nun ADVENTURES

surrounded it at a distance with a strong fence, being a double hedge, as high
as I could with, well staked, and filled between with brushAwood. Here I
lay very secure, sometimes two or three nights together; always going over
it with a ladder, as before: so that I fancied now I had my country and my
mast house. This work took me up till the beginning of August.

1 had but newly finished my fence, and began to enjoy my labour, when
the rains came on, and made me stick close to my lint habitation: for,
though I had made a tent like the other, with a piece of soil, and spread it
very well, yet I had not the shelter of a hill to keep me from stoma, nor a.
are behind me to retreat into when the rains were extraordinary.

About the beginning of August. as I said, I had finished my bower, and
began to enjoy myself. The 36 of August, I found the grapes I had hung up
were perfectly dried, and indeed were excellent good raisins of the sun: so
lbegnn to take them down from the trees; and it was very happy that I did
so, as the rain: which followed would have spoiled them. and I should have
lost the best part of my winter food; for I had above two hundred large
bunches of them. No sooner had 1 taken them all down, and carried most
of them home to my care, but it beg-an to rain: and from hence, which was
the Nth of August, it rained, more or less, every day till the middle of
October; and sometimes so violently. that I could not stir out of my cave
for several days.

In this season, I was much surprised with the increase of my family. I
had been concerned for the loss of one of my cats,'who ran away from me,
or, as} thought, had been dead; and I heard no more of her, till, to my
astonishment, she came home with three kittens. This was the more strange
to me, because, about the end of August, though I had killed a wild cat, as
I called it, with my gun, yet l thought it was quite a different kind from our
European cats: yet the young cats were the same kind of hombreed as the
old one; and both of my cats being females, I thought it very strange. But,
from these three, I afterwards came to be so peetered with cats, that] was
forced to kill them like vermin, or wild beasts, and to drire them from my
house as much as possible

From the 14th of August to the 26th, lament rain; so that I could not
stir, and was now very careful not to be much wet. In this confinement I
began to he straitened for food; but, venturing out twice, I one day killed a
goat; and the last day, which was the 26th. found a very large tortoise. which
was a treat to me. My food was now regulated thus: I ate a bunch of
raisins for my breakfast; a piece of the goat's flesh, or of the turtle, broiled,
f" my dinner (for, to my great misfortune. I had no vessel to boil or steer
any thing); and two or three of the tnrtle's eggs for my supper.

three hours at enlarging my cave: and, by degrees, worked iton towards one

September 30. I was now come to the unhappy anniversary of my landing.
I cost up the wicket: on my post, and found I had been on shore three hum
red and sixty-five days. I kept this day as anoiemn fast, setting it apart
for neiigioue exercise, presuming myself on the ground with the moot oerioua
humiliation, confessing my sins to God, acknowledging his righteous judge
manta uponme, and praying to him to have inercy on me through Jenn
Christ; and having not tested the least refi'eshment for twelve'boun, even ,
till the going down of the sun, I then ate a biscuit and a bunch of grapes,
and went to bed, finishing the day as I begauit.' [hadall this time ob-

The rainy season and the dry sewn began now to appear regular to me,
and I learned to divide then: so as to provide for them accordingly; hot I

daring to sow all that I had, I got but a small quantity at lain, my whole
crop not amounting to shove half a peek of each kind. But by this experi-
ment 1 was made master of my business, and knew exactly when was the
proper time to sow; and that I might expect two seed-times, and two
harvests, every year.

While this com was growing, I made a little discovery, which was ofme
to me allerwards. As soon as the rains were over, and the weather began
to settle, which was about the month of November, I made a visit up the
country to my bower; where, though I had not been some months, yet I
found all things just as I left them. The circle or double hedge that I had
made was not only firm and entire, but the stakes which 1 had out onto!
some trees that grew theresboots were all shot out and grown with long
branches, as much as a willow-tree usually shoots the first year afier lopping
its head; but I could not tell what tree to call it that these stakes were cut
from. I was surprised, and yet very well pleased, to see the young trees
grow; and J pruned them, and led them to grow as much alike as 1 could
and it is scarce credible how beautiful a figure they grow into in three years
so that, though the hedge made a circle of about twentyafive yards in dia-
meter, yet the trees, for such I might now call them, soon covered it, and it
was a. complete shade, sufficient to lodge under all the dry season. This
made me resolve to cut some more stakes, and make me a hedge like this, in"
a semicircle, round my wall (I mean that of my first dwelling), which I did;
and placing the trees or stakes in a double row, at about eight yards dis>>
mice from my first fence, they grew presently; and were, st first, a fine
cover to my habitation, and afterwards served for a defence also; as I shall
observe in its order.

I found now that the seasons of the year might generally be divided, not
into summer and winter, as in Europe, but into the rainy seasons and the dry
seasons, which were generally thus :ml'rom the middle of February to the
middle of April, rainy; the sun being then on or near the equinox. From the
middle of April till the middle of August, dry , the son being then north of
the line. From the middle of August till the middle of October, rainy; the
sun being then come back to the line. From the middle of October till the
middle of February, dry; the sun being then to the south of the line.

The rainy seasons held sometimes longer and sometimes shorter, as the

L winds happened to blowi but this was the general omen-ration I made.

Alter I had found, by experience, the ill consequences of being abroad in the
rain, I took care to furnish myself with provisions beforehand, that I might
not be obliged to go out; and I sat within doom as much as possible during
the wet months. This time 1 thund much employment, and very suitable
also to the time; for I found great occasion for many things which I had no
may to fiiroish myself with but by hard labour and constant application:

particularly, I tried many ways to make myself: basket; but all the twigs I
could get for the purpose proved so brittle, that they would do nothing. It

I cut my stakes that grew might possibly be as tough asthe allows, willows,
and oeiers, in England; and I resolved to try. Accordingly, the next day,
I went to my country-house, as I called it ; and, cutting name of the smaller

journey: during which most of the time was taken up in the weighty affair
of making a cage for my Poll, who began now to be more domestic, and to
be mighty well acquainted with me. Then I began to think of the poor kid,
which I had penned within my little circle, and resolved to fetch it home, or
give it some food: accordingly I went, and found it whereI left it (for indeed
it could not get out), but was almost starved for want of food. I went and
cut boughs of trees, and branches of such shrubs as I could find, and threw
It over, and, having fed it, I tied it as Idid before, to lead it away; but it was
so tame with being hungry, that Iliad no need to have tied it, for it followed
me like a dog: and, asI continually fed it, the creature became so loving,
so gentle, and so fond, that it was from that time one of my domestics also,
and would never leave me afterwards.

The rainy season of the autumnal equinox was now come, and I kept the
30th of September in the same solemn manner as before, being the anniver-
sary of my landing on the island; having now been there two years, and no
more prospect of being delivered than the first day I came there. I spent
the whole day in humble and thankful acknowledgments for the many won-
derful mercies which my solitary condition was attended with, and without
which it might have been infinitely more miserable. I gave humble and hearty
thanks to God for having been pleased to discover to me that it was pos-
sible I might be more happy, even in this solitary condition, than I should
have been in the enjoyment of society, and in all the pleasures of the world:
that he could fully make up to me the deficiencies of my solitary state, and
the want of human society. by his presence, and the communications of his
grace to my soul; supporting, comforting, and encouraging me to depend
upon his providence here, and to hope for his eternal presence hereafter.

It was now that I began sensibly to feel how much more happy the life I
now led was, with all its miserable circumstances, than the wicked, cursed,
abominable life I led all the past part of my days: and now I changed both
my sorrows and my joys: my very desires altered, my afl'ections changed
their goats, and my delights were perfectly new from what they were at my
first coming, or, indeed, for the two years past.

Before, as I walked about, either on my hunting, or for viewing the
country, the anguish of my soul at my condition would break out upon me
on a sudden, and my very heart would die within me, to think of the woods,
the mountains, the deserts I was in; and how I was a prisoner, locked up
with the eternal bars and bolts of the ocean, in an uninhabited wilderness,
without redemption. In the midst of the greatest composures of my mind,
this would break out upon me like a storm, and make me wring my
hands, and weep like a child: sometimes it would take me in the middle
of my work, and I would immediately sit dowu and sigh, and lock upon the
ground for an .hour or two together: this was still worse to me; but if I
could burst into tears, or give vent to my feelings by words, it would go
otf; and myg a*rief, being exhausted, would abate.

But now I began to exercise myself with new thoughts, I daily read the
word of God. and applied all the comforts of it to my present state. One
morning, being very sad, I opened the Bible upon these'words, ' I will
never leave thee, nor forsake thee :' immediately it occifrred that these words
were to me; why else should they be directed in such a manner, just at the
moment when Iwas mourning over my condition, asone forsaken of God
and man t ' Well, then,' said I, ' if God does not forsake me, of what ill
consequence can it be, or what matters it, though the world should forsake
me; seeing, on the other hand, if I had all the world, and should lose the
favour and blessing of God, there would be no comparison in the loss t'
From this moment I began to conclude in my mind that it was possible
for me to be more happy in this forsaken solitary condition, than it was
probable I should ever have been in any other particular state in the world;
and with this thought I was going to give thanks to God for bringing me
to this place. I know not what it was, but something shocked my mind at
that thought, and I durst not speak the words. ' How canst thou be such
a hypocrite,' said I, even audibly, ' to pretend to be thankful for a condition,
which, however thou mayest endeavour to be contented with, than wouldest
rather pray heartily to be delivered from? Here I stopped: but, though I
could not say I thanked God for being here, yet I sincerely gave thanks to
God for opening my eyes, by whatever afilicting providences, to see the
former condition of my life, and to mourn for my wickedness, and repent.
I never opened the Bible, or shut it, but my very soul within me blessed
God for directing my friend in England, without any order of mine, to pack
it up among my goods; and for assisting me afterwards to save it out of the

wreck of the ship.

Thus, and in this disposition of mind, I began my third year; and though
I have not given the reader the trouble of so particular an account of my
works this year as the first, yet, in general, it may be observed, that I was
very seldom idle; but having regularly divided my time, according to the
several daily employments that were before me; such as, first, my duty to
God, and the reading the Scriptures, which I constantly set apart some time
for, thrice every day : secondly, going abroad with my gun for food, which
generally took me. up three hours every morning, when it did not rain:
thirdly, ordering, curing, preserving, and cooking what I had killed or
catched for my supply: these took up great part of the day; also it is to be
considered, that in the middle of the day, when the sun was in the zenith,
the violence of the heat was too great to stir out; so that about four hours
in the evening was all the time I could be supposed to work in; with this
exception, that sometimes I changed my hours of hunting and working, and
went to work in the morning, and abroad with my gun in the afternoon.

To this short time allowed for labour, I desire may be added the exceed.~
mg laboriousness of my work; the many hours which, for want 6r tools,
want of help, and want of skill, every thing I did took up out of my time :
for example, I was full two-and-forty days making me a board for a long
shelf, which I wanted in my cave; whereas two sawyers, with their tools
and a saw-pit, would have cut six of them out of the same tree in half a day.
' My case was this: It was a large tree which was to'be cut down, he-
couse'myboardwastoheabmdone.' Thistree lwssthreedayscutting
down, and, two more in cutting 03' the bougbs, and reducing it to a log,
or piece of timber. With inexpressible hacking and herring I reduced both '
the sides orit into chipg till it was light enough to move; then I turned it,
and made one side of it smooth and flat as p board, from end to end; then,
turning that side downward, cut the other side, till I brought the plank to
beabout three inches thick. and smooth on both sides. Any one nl'sy judge
the labour of my hands in such a piece of work; but labour and patience
married me through that, and many other things: I only observe this in
particular, to shew the reason why so much of my time went away with so
little work, viz, that what might be a little to be done with help and tools,
was a vast labour, and required a prodigious time to do alone, and by band.
Notwithstanding this, with patience and labour I went through many things;
and, indeed,vevery thing that my circumstances made necessary for use in
do, as will appear by what follows.

I was now, in the months of November and December, expecting my
crop of barley and rice. The ground I had manured or dug up for them
was not great; for, as I observed, my seed of each was not above the quan-
tity of half a peck, having lost one whole crop by sowing in the dry season -
but now my crop promised very well; when, on a sudden, I found I was in
danger of losing it all again by enemies of several sorts, which it was same
possible to keep from it ; as, first, the goats, and wild creatures which I called
ham who, tasting the sweetness of the blade, lay in it night and day,"
soon as it came up, and ate it so close, that it could get no time to shoot up
into stalk.

I saw no remedy for this but by making an enclosure about it with a
hedge, which I did with a great deal of toll , and the more, because it re-
quired speed However, as my arable land was but small, suited to my
crap, I got it tolerably well fieuoed it: about three weeks' time; and, shooting
some of the creatures in the day time, I set my dog to guard it in the night.
tying him up to a stake at the gate, where he would stand and bark all
night long; so in a little time the enemies forsook the place, and the com
grew very strong and well, and began to ripen upace. .

But as the beasts mined me before, while the com was in the blade, so
the birds were as likely to ruin me now, when it was in the ear: for, going
along by the place to see how it tlxrove, I saw my little crop surrounded

till I should be gone. I immediately let fly among them (for 'I always had
my gun with me) , I had no sooner shot, but there rose up a little cloud of
fowls, which I had not seen at all, from among the corn itself.

I stayed by it to load my gun; and then coming away, I could easily see ,
the thieves sitting upon all the trees about me, as if they only waited
till I was gone away; and the __event proved it to be so; for -asI' walked

one, into'the corn again. I was so provoked, that I could not have patience
to stay till more came on, knowing that every grain they ate now was, as it
might be said, a peck-loaf to me in the consequence; so; coming. up to the
hedge,I fired again, and killed three of them.. This was what I wished for;
so I tookthem up, and served them as we serve notorious thieves in England,
viz, hanged them in chains, for a terror to others. It is impomible to ion:
gine that this should have such. an efi'ect as it had; for the {owls not' only
never came to the corn, but, in short, they forsook all that part of the island,
and I could. never see a bird near the place as longas my scare-crowshung
there. This I was very glad of, you may be sure; and, about the latter end
of December, which was my second harvest of the year, I reaped my com.

I was sadly put hit for a sithe or sickle to cut it down : and all I could
do was to make one-as well as I could, out of once! the broad-swords, os
cutlasses, which I saved among the arms out of the ship. However, as my
first crop was but small, I had no great difficulty to cut it'down: in short, I
reaped it my way, for I cut nothing otf'bnt the ears, and carried it away in
a great basket'which I had made, and so rubbed it out with my hands; and,
at the end of all my harvesting. I found that out'of my half-peck 'of seed I
had near two bushels of rice, and above two bushels and a half of barley ;_
that is to say, by my guess, for] bad no measure. .

However, this was great encouragement to me; and I foresaw that,' n;
time, it would please God to supply me with bread. and yet here_I was per:
plexed again; for I neither knew how to grind or make meal of my corn.
or, indeed, how to clean it and part it; nor, if I made it into meal, bow to- .
make bread of it; and, if how to make it, yet! knew not how to bake it;
these things being added to my desire of having a good quantity {or store,
and to secure a constaht supply, I resolved not to taste any ofthis crop, but
to pmerve it all for seed against the next season; and, in the mean time, to
employ all my study and hours of working to accomplish this great work of
providing myself with corn and bread.

It might be truly said, that now I worked. for my bread. It rs a litfle,
wonderful, and what I believe few people have thought much upon,- rig:
the strange multitude of little things necessary in the providing, producing,"
curing, dressing, making, and finishing this one article of. bread. - ,_- .

but this did my work in but a wooden manner; and, though it cost me a
great many days to make it, yet, lbr want of iron, it not only wore out the
owner, but made my work the harder, and performed it much worse.
However, this i bore with, and was content to work it out with patience,
and bear with the hardness of the performance. When the corn was sown,
I had no harrow, but was forced to go over it myself, and drag a great
heavy bough of a tree over it to scratch it, as it may be called, rather than
take or harrow it. When it was growing and grown, I have observed al-
ready how many things I wanted to fence insecure it, mow or reap it, cure
and carry it home, thrash, part it from the chaff, and save .it: then I
wanted a mill to grind it, sieves to dress it, yeast and salt to make it into
bread, and an oven to bake it; and yet all these things I did without, as
shall be observed; and the corn was an incstimable comfort and advantage
to me : all this, as I said, made every thing laborious and tedious to me, but
that there was no help for; neither was my time so much loss to me, be-
cause, as I had divided it, a certain part of it was every day appointed
to those works; and, as I resolved to use none of the com for bread till 1
had a greater quantity by me, I had the next six months to apply myself
wholly, by labour and invention, to furnish myself with utensils proper
for the performing all the operations necessary for making corn fit for my
use.

But now 1 was to prepare more land ; forl had seed enough to sow above an
acre of ground Before I did this, I had a week's work, at least, to make me a:
spade; which, when it was done, was but a sorry one indeed, and very heavy,
and required double labour to work with it: however, I went through that,
and sowed my seed in two large flat pieces of ground, as near my house as!
could find them to my mind, and fenced them in with a good hedge; the
stakes of which were all cut off that wood which I had set before, and knew
it would grow ; so that, in one year's time, I knew Ishonld have a quick or
living hedge, that would want but little repair. This work took me up full
three months, because agreat part of the time was in the wet season, when
I could not go abroad, Within doors, that is, when it rained, and! could
not go out, I found employment on the following occasions; always observ-
ing, that, while I was at work, I diverted myself with talking to my parrot,
and leading him to speak; and I quickly learned him to know his own
name, and, at last, to speak it out pretty loud, ' Poll ;' which was the first
Word 1 ever heard spoken in the island, by any month but my own. This,
therefore, was not my work, but an assistant to my work; for now, as I
said, I had a great employment upon my hands, as follows :--l had long
studied, by some was or other, to make myself some earthen vessels,
which, iodeed,l wanted much, but knew not where to come at them: how-
ever, considering the heat of the climate, I did not doubt but, if I could
find out any clay, [might batch up some such pot as might, being dried
to the can, be hard and strong enough to bear handling, and to hold any
thing that ms dry, and required to be kept so; and as this was necessary
in the preparing corn, meal, 8m, which was the thingl was upon, I resolved
to make some as large asIcould, and fit only to stand like jars, to hold
what should be put into them.

It would make the reader pity me, or rather laugh at me, to tell how
many awkward ways I took to raise this pastil; what odd, mishapen, ngly
things I made; how many of them fell in, and how many fell out, the clay
not being stifi' enough to bear its own weight; how many cracked by the
over-violent heat of the sun, being set out too hastily; and how many fell in
pieces with only removing, as well before as after they were dried: and, in
a word, how, after having laboured hard to find the clay, to dig it, to temper
it, to bring it home, and work it, I could not make above twodarge earthen
ugly things (I cannot eall them jars) in about two months' labour.

However, as the sun baked these. two very dry and hard. I lifted them
very gently up, and set them down again in two great wicker baskets, which
1 had made on purpose for them, that they might not break; and as be--
tween the pot and the basket there was a little room to spare, I stuffed it
full of the rice and barley-straw; and these two pots, being to stand always
dry, I thought would hold my dry corn, and, perhaps, the meal, when ,the
corn was bruised.

Though _I miscarried so much in my design for large pots, yet I made
several smaller things with better success; such as little round pots, fiat
dishes, pitchers, and pipkius, and any thing my band turned to; and the
heat of the sun baked them very hard.

But all this would not answer my end, which was to get an earthen pot
to hold liquids, and bear the fire, which none of these could do. "hap-
pened some time after, making a pretty large fire for cooking my meat,
when I went to put it out after I had done with it, I found a broken piece
of_one of .my earthenware vessels in the fire, burnt ashard as a stone, and
as red as a tile. I was agreeably surprised to see it; and said to myself,
that certainly they' might be made to burn whole, it' they would burn
broken.

This set me to study how to order my fire, so as to make it burn some
pots. I had no notion of a kiln, such as the potter-s burn in, or of glazing them
with lead, though I had some lead to do it with; but I placed three large
pipkins and two or three pots -in a pile, one upon another, and placed my
fire-wood all round it, with a great heap of embers under them. I plied the
fire with {rah fuel round the outside, and upon the top; till I saw the pots
in the inside red-hot quite through, and observed that they did not crack at
all: when I saw.them clear red, I let them stand m that heat about five or
six hours, till I found one of them, though it did not crack. did melt or run;
for the sand which was mixed with the clay melted by the violence ot'jll
heat, and would have run into glam, if I had gone on; so I slacked my fire
gradually, till the pots began to abate of the red 'eolour;'and watching
them all night, that I might not let the fire abate too fast, in the morning
I had three very good, I will not 'say handsome, pipkiua, and two other

glazed, with the-running ofthe sand.

Alter this experiment, I need not say that i wanted no sort of earthen;
ware for my use; but 1 must needs say, as to the shapes of them, they were
very indifferent, as any one may suppose, as I had no way of making them
but as the children make dirt pies, or as a wornau would make pics that
neVer learned to raise paste.

No joy at a thing of so mean a nature was ever equal to mine when I
found 1 had made an earthen pot that would hear the fire; and 1 had hardly
patience to slay till they were cold, before I set one on the lire-again, with
some water in it, to boil me some meat, which it did admirably well, and
with a piece of a kid I made some very good broth; though I wanted oat~
meal, and several other ingredients requisite to make it so good as I would
have had it been.

M y next concern was to get a stone mortar to stamp or heat some corn
in; for, as to the mill, there was no thought of arriving to that perfection of
art with one pair of hands. To supply this want l was at a great loss; for,
of all trades in the world. I was as perfectly unqualified for a stone~cutter
as for any whatever; neither had 1 any tools to go about it with. I spent
many a day to find out a great stone big enough 'to cut hollow, and make fit
for a mortar; but could tind none at all, except what was in a solid rock.
and which I had no way to dig or cutout: nor, indeed, were the rocks in
the island of sufficient hardness, as they were all of a sandy crumbling stone,
which would neither bear the weight ot' a heavy pestle, nor would break
the corn without filling it with sand: 90, alter a great deal of time lost in
searching for a stone, 1 gave it over, and resolved to look out a great block
of hard wood, which I found, indeed, much easier; and, getting one as big
as l'had strength to stir, l rounded it, and formed it on the outside with my
axe and hatchet; and then, with the help of tire, and infinite labour, made
a hollow place in it, as the Indians, in Brazil, make their canoes. Alter this,
I made a great heavy pestle, or heater, of the wood called iron-wood; and
this [prepared and laid by against 1 had my next crop of corn, when 1 pro-
posed to myself to grind, or rather pound, my corn into meal, to make my
bread.

' My next dificulty was to make a sieve, or search, to dress my meal, and
to part it from the bran and the husk, without which I did not see it pos-
sible I could have any bread. This was a most difiicult thing, even but to
think on 3 for I had nothing like the necessary thing to make it; I mean the
fine thin canvas or 'stufi; to search the meal through. Here I was at a full
stop for many months; nor did I really know what to do; linen I had none
ten but what was mere rage; I had goats' hair, but neither knew how to
weave it no: spin it; and, had I known how, here were no tools to work it
with . all the remedy I found for this was, at last recollectiog I had, among
the men's clothes which were saved out of the ship, some oeclccloths of
calico or muslin; with some pieces of these I made three small sieves, proper
enough for the work; and thus I made shin for some years: how I did

The baking part was the next thing to he considered, and how 1 should

make bread when I came to have corn: for, first, I had no yeast: as to that
part, there was no supplying the want, so I did not concern myself much
about it; but for an oven, I was, indeed, puzzled. At length I found out
an expedient for that also, which was this :--I made some earthen vessels,
very broad, but not deep; that is to say, about twofeet diameter, and
not above nine inches deep: these I burned in the fire, as I had done the
other, and laid them by; and, when I wanted to bake, I made a great fire
upon my hearth, which I had paved with some square tiles, of my own
making and burning also; but I should not call them square.

When the fire-wood was burned into embers, or live coals, I drew them
forward upon the hearth, so as to cover it all over, and there let them lie till
the hearth was very hot ; then, sweeping away all the embers, I set down my
loaf, or loaves, and, covering them with the earthen pot, drew the embers
all round the outside of the pot, to keep in, and add to, the heat; and thus,
as well as in the best oven in the world, I baked my barley-loaves, and be.
came, in a little time, a good pastry-cook into the bargain; for I made my-
self several cakes and puddings of the rice; but made no pics, as I had no-
thing to put into them except the flesh of fowls or goats.

It need not be wondered at if all these things took me up most part of
the third year of my abode here; for it is to be observed, in the intervals of
these things, I had my new harvest and husbandry to manage: I reaped my
corn in its season, and carried it home as well as I could, and laid it up in the
ear, m my large baskets, till I had time to rub it out; for I had no floor to
thresh it on, or instrument to thresh it with.

And now, indeed, my stock of corn increasing, I really wanted to build
my barns bigger: I wanted a place to lay it up in; for the increase of the
corn now yielded me so much, thatI had of the barley about twenty bushels,
and or rice as much, or more, insomuch that now I resolved to begin to use
it freely: for my bread had been quite gone a great while: I resolved also to
see what quantity would be suflicient for me a whole year, and to sow but
once a year.

Upon the whole, I found that the forty bushels of barley and rice were
much more than I could consume in a year; sol resolved to sow just the

same quantity every year thatI sowed the last, in hopes that such a quantity
would fully provide me with bread, 8:0. '

All the while these things were doing, you may be sure my thoughts ran
many times upon the prospect of land which I had seen from the other side
of the island; and I was not without some secret wishes thatI was on shore
there; fancying, that seeing the main land, and an inhabited country, I
might find some way or other to convey myself farther, and perhaps, at last,
find some means of escape.

But all this while I made no allowance for the dangers of such a condition,
and that I might fall into the hands of savages, and, perhaps, such as I might.
have reason to think far worse than the lions and tigers of Africa: that, if I
once came in their power, I should run a hazard of more than a thousand
to one of being _killed, and, perhaps, of being eaten, for I had heard that

little or no defence; all these things, I say, which I ought to have considered
well of, and did cast up in my thoughts atterwarda, took up none of my ap-
prehensions at first; yet my head no mightily upon the thought of getting
over to the shore.

Now I wished for my boy Xury, and the long~boat with the shouldenof-
mutton sail, with which I sailed above a thousand miles on the coast of
Africa: but this was in train: then I thought I would go and look at our
ship's boat, which, as I have said, was blown up upon the shore a- great way,
in the storm, when we were first cast away. She lay nearly where she did
at first. but not quite; having turned, by the force of the waves and the
winds, almost bottom upward, against a high ridge of beachy rough send;
but no water about her as before. If I had had bands to have refitted her. and
to have launched her into the water, the boat would have done very well,
and I might have gone back into the Brazila with her easily enough; but 1
might have foreseen that Icould no more turn her, and set her upright upon
her bottom, than I could remove the island: however, I went to thewoods,
and out levers and rollers, and brought them to the boat, resolving to try
what I could do; suggesting to myself; that it {could but turn her down,
and repfir the damage she had received, she would be a very good boat,
and I might venture to sea in her.

I spared no pains, indeed, in this piece of fmitless toil, and spent, 1 think,
three or four weeks about it: at last, finding it impossible to heave her up-
with my little arength, I fell to digging away the sand, to undermine her,
and so as to make her fall down, setting pieces of wood to thrust and guide
her right in the fall.

But when I had done this, I was unable to stir her up again, or to get
under her, much less to move her forward towards the water; so I was
towed to give it over: and yet, though I gave over the hopes of the boat,
my desire to venture over the main increased, rather than diminished, as the
means for it seemed impossible.

At length, I began to think whether it was not posit-lie to make myself a
canoe, or periagua, such as the natives of those climates make. even without
tools, or, as I might say, without hands, of the trunk of a great tree. This I
not only thought possible, but easy. and pleased myself extremely with the
idea of making it, and with my having much more convenience for it than
any of the negroes or Indians ;' but not at all considering the particular in-
conveniences ,which I'lay under more than the Indians did, viz. the want of
bands to move it into the water when it Was made--a difienlty much hauler

the outside into the proper shape of a boat, and burn or cut out the inside
tomake it hollow, so asto make a boatof it; it; alter all thialmustleave
it just where Ifound it, and was not able to launch it into the water? -
. One would imagine, if I had had the least reflection upon my mind of my
circumstances while I was making this boat, I should have immediately
thought how I was to get it into the sea. but my thoughts were so intent
upon my voyage in it, that I never once considered how I should get it of
the land, and it was really,' in its own nature, more easy for me to guide it
over forty-five miles-of sea, than the fortyofive fathoms of land, where it lay,
to set it afloat' in the water.

I went to work upon this boat the most like a fool that ever man did, who
had any of his senses awake. I pleased myself with the design, without de-
termining whether I was able to undertake it; not but that the difficulty of
launching my boat came ofien into myhead; but I put a stop to my own
inquiries into it by this foolish answer: ' Let us first make it; I warrant I
will find some way or other to get it along when it is done.' -

This was a most preposterous method; but the eagerness of my fancy pre-
vailed, and to work I went. I felled a cedar-tree, and l questionmuch
whether Solomon ever had such a one for the building of the Temple at
Jerusalem; it was five feet ten inches diameter at the lower part next the
stump, and four feet eleven inches diameter at the end of twenty-two feet,
where it'lessened, and then parted into branches. It was not without in.
finite labour that I felled this tree; I was twenty days hacking and hewing
at the bottom, and fourteen more getting the branches and limbs, and the
vast spreading head of it, cut ofi': alter this, it cost me a month to shape it
and dub it to a proportion, and to something like the bottom of a boat, that
it might swim upright, as it ought to do. it cost me near three months more
to clear the inside, and work it out so as to make an exact boat of it: this I "
did, indeed, without fire, by mere mallet audchisel, and by the dint of hard.
labour, till I had brought it to be a very handsome perisgua, and big enough'
to have carried six-aud-twenty men, and consequently big enough to have
carried me and all my cargo.

When I had gone through this work, I was extremely delighted with it.
The boat was really much bigger than ever I saw a canoe or periagna, that
we! made of one tree, in my life. Many a weary stroke it had cost, you may
be sure; and there remained nothing but to get it into the water; which;
had I accomplished, I make no question but I should have begun the
maddest voyage, and the most unlikely to be performed, that ever was
undertaken. . --

. But all my devices to get it into the water failed me; though they cost
me inexpressible labour too. It lay about one hundred yards from the water,
and not more; but the first inconvenience was, it was up hill towards the

creek. Well, to take away this discouragement, I resolved to dig into the .- .

surface oftheearth, and somake adeclivity: this I began,snd itcoatmaa'
prodigious deal of pains (but who grudge pains that have their deliverance
mvrew)? When thiswas-worked through, and thisdifiiculty mmgeeitwad
still much the same, for I could no more stir the canoe than I could the other
boat. Then I measured the distance of ground, and resolved to cut a dock
or canal, to bring the water up to the canoe, seeing I could not bring the
moo down. to the water. Well, I began this work; and, when I began to
enter upon it, and calculate how deep it was to be dug, how broad, how the
stufl' was to be thrown out, 1 found by the number of hands 1 had, having
none but my own, that it must have been ten or twelve years before I could
have gone through with it; for the shore lay so high, that at the upper end
it must have been at least twenty feet deep; this attempt, though with great
reluctancy, I was at length obliged to give over also.

This grieved me heartily; and now I saw, though too late, the folly of
beginning a work before we count the cost, and before we judge rightly of
our own strength to go through with it.

In the middle of this work I finished my fourth year in this place, and
kept my anniversary with the same devotion and with as much comfort as
before; for, by a constant study and serious application to the word of God,
and by the assistance of his grace, I gained a difi'erent knowledge from what
I had before; I entertained difi'erent notions of things; I looked now upon
the world as a thing remote, which I had nothing to do with, noexpectation
from, and, indeed, no desires about: in a word, I had nothing to do with it,
nor was ever likely to have; I thought it looked, as we may perhaps look
upon it hereafter, viz., as a place I had lived in, but'was come outof it; and
well might I say, as Father Abraham to Dives, ' Between me and thee is a
great gulf fixed.'

In the first place, I was here removed from all the' wickedness of the
world; I had neither the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye, nor the pride
of life. I had nothing to covet, for] bad all that I was now capable of en-
joying: I was lord of the whole manor; or, if I pleased, I might call myself
king or emperor over the whole country which I had possession of; there
were no rivals; I had no competitor, none to dispute sovereignty or com--
mand with me: I might have raised ship-loadings of corn, but I had no use
for it; so I let as little grow as I thought enough for my occasion. I had
tortoise or turtle enough, but now and then one was as much as I could put
to any use: I had timber enough to have built a fleet of ships; and I had
grapes enough to have made wine, or to have cured into raisins, to have
loaded that fleet when it had been built.

But all I could make use of was all that was valuable: Ihad enough to
eat and supply my wants, and what was the rest to me? If I killed more
flesh than I could eat, the dog must eat it, or vermin; if I sowed more com.
than I could eat, it must be spoiled; the trees that I cut down were lying to
rot on the ground; I could make no more use of them than for fuel, and that
I had no other occasion for but to dressmy food.

In a word, the nature and experience of things dictated to me, upon just
reflection, that all the good things of this world are of no farther good to us
than for our use, and that whatever we may heap up to give to others, we
enjoy only as much as we- can use, and no more. The most oovetous gaping

.miserintheworldwoul'dhave heenenredoftheviceofcovetonsnesstf he
had been' In my case; for I possessed infinitely more than I knew what to do
with. I had no room for desire, except it was ibr things which I had not,--
and they were comparatively but trifles, though indeed of great use to me. .
I had, as I hinted before, alparcel of money, as well gold'as silver, abom
thirty~sia pounds sterling. Alas! there the nasty, sorry, useless stufl' lay:
I had no manner of business for it; and I often thought within myself; that
I would have given a handlhl of it fora gross of tobacco-pipes, or for a hand-
mill to giind my corn; nay, I would have given it all for sixpenny-worth of
turnip and carrot-seed from England, or for a bandit" of peas and beans, and
I a bottle of inlr. As it was, I had not the least advantage by it, or benefit from
It ; but there it lay in a drawer, and grew mouldy with the damp of the cave
in the wet seasons; and, if I had had the drawer full of diamonds, it had been
the same cams--they had been of no manner of value to me, because of no use.

I had now brought my state of life to be much more comfortable in itself
than it was at first, and much easier to my mind as well as to my body. I
frequently sat down to meat with thankfulness, and admired the hand of
God's providence, which had thus spread my table in the wilderness: I
learned to look more upon the bright side of my condition, and less upon the
dark side, and to consider what I enjoyed rather than what I wanted : and
this gave me sometimes such secret comforts, that I cannot express them;
and which I take notice of here, to put those discontented people in mind of
it, who cannot enjoy comfortably what God has given them, because they
see and covet something that he has not given them. All our discontents
about what we want appeared to me to spring from the want of thankfiIlness
for what we have.

Another reflection was of great use to me, and doubtless would be so to
any one that should fall into such distress as mine was; and this was, to
compare my present condition with what I at first expected it would be;
nay, with what it would certainly have been, if the good providence of God
. had not wonderfully ordered the ship to be-cast up near to the shore, where
I not only could come at her, hnt'conld bring what I got out of her to the
shore, for my relief and comfort; without which I had wanted for tools to
Work, weapons for defence, and gunpowder and shot for getting my food.

- I spent whole hours, I may say whole days, in representing to myself, in

the moat lively colours, how I must haveacted if I had got nothing out of
the ship. I could not have so much as got any food, except fish and tu'rtles;
and that, as it was long before I found any of them, I must have perished:
that I should have lived, if I had not perished, like a mere savage: that, -if I
had killed a goat or a fowl by any contrivance, I had no way to day or open
it, or part the flesh from the skin and the bowels, or to cut it up, but must
gnaw it with my teeth, and pull it with my claws, like a beast.

These reflections made me very sensible of the goodness of Providence to
me, and very thsnlrfhl for my pruent condition, with all its hardships and
misfortunes : and this part also I cannot but recommend to the rmtion d

the who are apt, in their misery, to say, "Is any afliction like mine? M '
85 ' was urn sun soundness

them consider how much worse the cases of some people are. and their one
might have been, if Providence had thought tit.

' I had another reflection, which assisted me also to comfort my mind with
hopes; and this was, comparing my present condition with what I had de~
served, and had therefore reason to expect from the hand of Providence. I
had lived a dreadful life, perfectly destitute of the knowledge and tear of (10"! ,
I had been well instructed by my father and mother; neither had they been
wanting to me in their endeavours to infuse an early religious awe of God
into my mind,<<a sense of my duty, and what the nature and end of my being
required of me. But, alas! falling early. into the seafaring life, which, of all
lives, is the most destitute of- thc riser of God, though his, terrors are always
before them; I say, falling early into the seafaring life, and into seafaring
company, all that little sense of religion which 1 had entertained was
laughed out of me by my measmates; by a hardened dupmng of dangers
and the views of death, which grew habitual to me; by my long absence
from all manner of opportunities to converse with any thing but what was
like myself, or to hear any thing that was good, or tending towards it.

So void was I of every thing that was good, or of the least sense of what I
was, or was to be, that in the greatest deliveranm I enjoyed (such as my
escape from Sallee, my being taken up by the Portuguese master of a ship,
my being planted so well in the Brazils, my receiving the cargo from Eng--
land, and the like), I never had once the words" Thank God' so much as on
my mind or in my mouth; nor in the greatest distress had I so much as a
thought to pray to him, or so much as to say, ' Lord, have mercy upon me!'
no, nor to mention the name of (and, unless it was to swear by, and
blaspheme it.

I had terrible reflections upon my mind for many months, as I have already
observed, on account of my' wicked and hardened life past, and when I
looked about me, and considered what particular providcnoes had attended
me since my coming into this place, and how God had dealt bountifully with
mar-had not only punished me less than my iniquity had deserved, but had
so plentifully provided for me,--this gave me great hopes that my repentance
was accepted, and that God had yet mercies in store for me.

With these reflections i worked my mind up not only to a resignation to
the will of God in the present disposition of my circumstances, but even to a
sincere thankfulness for my condition; and that I, who was yet a living man,
ought not to complain, seeing! had not the due punishment of my sins; that
I enjoyed so many mercies which I had no reason to have expected in that
place, that l ought never more to repine at my condition, but to us'oica, and
to give daily thanks for that daily bread, which nothing but a crowd of
wonders omdd have brought; that I ought to consider I had been fedby a
miracle, even as great as that of feeding Elijah by ravens; nay. by s long
series of miracles; and that 1 could hardly have,named a place in the unin-

my life; novenomons or poisonous creaturegwhich I might feed on tomy
hurt; no savages to murder and devour me. his word, as my life was a
life of sorrow one way, so it was a life ot' mercy another, and I wanted
nothing to make it a life of comfort, but to make myself sensible of God' s
goodness to me, and care over me, in this condition, and alter I did make
s just improvement of these things, I went away, and was no more sad.

I had now been here so long, that many things which I brought on shore

forvmy help were either quite gone, or very much wasted, and near spent.

My ink, as I observed, had been gone for some time. all but a very little,
which I eked out with water, a little and a little, till it was so pale, it scarce
lefi any appearance of black upon the paper. As long as it lasted, I made
use of it to minute down the days of the month on which any remarkable
thing happened to me: and, first, by casting up times past, I remember that
there was a stmngeconcnrrence of days in the various providences which
befall nae, and which, if I had been superstitionsly inclined to observe days as
fatal or fortunate, I might have had reason to have looked upon with a great
deal of curiosity.

First, I had observed, that the same day thatI broke away from;my father.
and my friends, and ran away to Hell, in order to go to sea, themme day -
afierwards I was taken by the Sallee man of war, and made a slave: the.
name day ot' the year that Iescaped out of the wreck of the ship in Yarrnouthv
Roads, that same day-year allerwhds I made my escape from Sallee in the
boat: and the some dayof the year I was born on, via, the 80th ot'Sepel
<<amber, that same day I had my life so miraculously saved twentyvsix year;
alter, when I was cast on shore' In this island: so that my wicked life and
my solitary life began both on one day. ' -

The next thing to my ink being wasted was that of my bread; [mean the
biscuit which I brought out of the ship: this I had husbanded to' the last;
degree, allowing myself but one ealie of bread a day for above a year; and
yet I was quite without bread for near a year before I got any corn of my
own; and great reason'I had to be thankful that I had any at all, the getting
it being, as has been already observed, next to miraculous.

My clothes, too, began to decay mightily: as to linen, I had nonefora
great while, except some chequered shirts which I found In the chests of the;
other seamen, and which I carefully preserved, because many times I coald' ,
hear no clothes on but a shirt; and it was a very great help to me that I

had, among all the men's clothes of the ship, almost three dozen of shirts.'

There were also, indeed, several thick watcbmts of the seamen'swhich
were lefl,'hut they were too hot to wear: and though it istrne that the,

' weather was so violently hot that therewas' no need of clothes, yet I. could;

not go quite naked, no, though I had been inclined to it, which I was not;
nor could I abide the thought of it. though I was all alone. The reason why
I could not go quite naked was, I wold not bear the heat of the sun so well
when quite naked as with some clothes on, nay. the very heat new
blistered my skin ' whereas. with a shirt on, the sirils'eltmade some motion,
and. whistling nndenthe shirt, was twofold cooler than without it. ;No more
oonldlerer bring my'nll'to gooutiotheheatol' them withontaeapoc
hat; the heat of the sad, heating with such violence as it does in that place,
would give me the headeach presently, by darting so directly upon tny
head, without a hat or cap on, so that I could not bear it; whereas. if I put
on my hot, it would presently go away.

Upon these views, I began to consider'about putting the few rags I had,
which I'oalled clothes, into some order: I had worn out all the waistcoat:
I had, and my business was now to try it! could not make jackctaout of no
great watch-coats that I had by me, and with such other materials as I had;
so I set to work a tailoring, or rather, indeed, a botching, for I made most
piteona work ofit. However. I made shift to make two or three new waist-
coats, which I hoped would serve me a great while: as {or brooches or
drawers, I made but a. very sorry shift indeed till afterwards.

I have mentioned that I saved the skins of all the creatures that I killed,
I' mean four-footed ones; and I had hung them up, stretched out with sticks,
in the sun, by which means some of them were so dry and hard that they
were fit for little, but others I found very useful. The first thing I made of
these was a great cap for my head, with the hair on the outside, to shoot ofi'
the rain; and this 1 performed so well, that alter this I made me a suit of.
clothes wholly of the skins, that is to say, a waistcoat and breeehea, open at
the knees, and both loose; for they werexnther wanting to keep me cool
than warm. I must not omit to acknowledge that they were wretchedly
made; for, if I was a bad carpenter, I was a worse tailor. However, they
were such as! made very good shill with; and, when I was abroad, if it
happened to rain, the hair of my waistcoat and cap being uppermost, I was
kept very dry.

After this, I spent a great deal of time and pains to make me an umbrella
I was, indeed, in great want of one, and had a great mind to make one: I
had seen them made in the Brazils, where they were very useful to the great
heats which are there; and I felt the heats every jot as great here. and
greater too, being nearer the equinox: besides, as l was obliged .to be much
abroad, it was a most useful thing to me, as well for the rains as the heats.
I took a world of pains at it, and was a great while before I could make any
thing likely to hold; nay, alter I thought I had hit the way, I spoiled twoor
three before I made one to my mind; but at last I made one that answered
iodifl'ereatly well. _The main difficulty Mound was to make it to'let down:
I could make it spread, but if it did not let down too, and draw in, it was not
portable for me any way but just over my head, which would not do. How.
ever, at last, as I said, I made one to answer, and covered it with skins, the
hair upwards, so that it east of the rain like a penthouse, and kept 06' the.
son aosfi'ectnally, that I could walk out in the hottest of the weather with
greater advantage than I could before in the coolest; and, when I had no
neede!it,coulddoseit,and csrryitnndermy arm.

Thus I lived mighty comfortably, my mind being entirely composed by '

resigning to the will of God, and throwing myself wholly upon the disposal
of his providence. This made my life better than sociable, for, when I began
to regret the want of conversation, I would ask myself, whether this con-
rersing mutually with my own though" and, or! hope I inayssy,with .

\
even God himself by ejaculations, was not better than the unnost enjoyment
of human societydeg 1n the world i

I cannot say that afler this, for five years, any extraordinary thing hap-
pened to me, but I lived on in the same course, in the same posture and
place, just as before. The chief things I was employed in, besides my yearly
labour of planting my barley and rice, and curing my raisins, of both which
I always kept up just enough to have suficien't stock of one year' s provision
beforehand; I say, besides this yearly labour, and my daily'pnrsuit of going
out with my gun, I had one labour, to make me acanoe, which 'at last I
finished: so that by digging a canal to it of six feet wide. and four feet deep, I
brought it into the creek, almost half a mile, As for the first, which was so
vastly big,.'as'I made it without considering beforehand, as I ought to 'do,
how I should be able to launch it, so, never being able 'to bring ' it into 'the
water, or bring the water to it, I was obliged to let it'lie'where it Was, as a
memorandum to teach me to be wiser the next time: indeed, the next time,
though [could not get a tree proper for it, and was in a place where I could
not get the water to it at any _less distance than, as I haVe said, near half a
mile, yet, 'as I saw it was practicable at last, I never gave it over; and, though
I was near two years about it, yet I never grudged my labour, in hopes of
havingahoattogoofi'toseaatlast. _ .

However, though my little periagua was finished, yet the sweet it was
not at all answerable to the design which I had in View when I made" the
first; I mean of venturing over'to the temfima, where it was above forty
miles broad; accordingly,' the smallness of my boat assisted to put an end
to that design, and now I thought no more of it.' As I had a boat, my next
design was to ntakea cruise round the islandpfor aslhad been on the
other side' 1n one place, crossing, as I have already described it, overthe land,
so the discoveriesl made 1n that little Journey made me very eager to see'
other parts ofthe coast; and, now I had a boat, I thought of nothing but
sailing round the island. ' ' ' ' '

(a food late a great deal of), a little bottle of rum, half a goat, and powder
and shot for killing more, and two large watch-coats, of those which, as I
mentioned before, I had saved out of the seamen's chests: these I took, one
to lie upon, and the other to cover me in the night.

It was the 6th of November, in the sixth year of my reign, or my captivity,
which you please, that I set out on this voyage, and I found it much longer
than Iexpected; for though the island itself was not very large, yet, when I
came to the east side of it, I found a great ledge of rocks lie out about two
leagues into the sea, some above water, some under it; and beyond thata
shoal of sand, lying dry half a league more, so that l was obliged to go a great
way out to sea to double the point.

\Vhen first I discovered them, I was going to give over my enterprise,
and come back again, not knowing how far it might oblige me to go out to
sea, and, above all, doubting how I should get back again; so I came to an
anchor; for I had made me a kind of an anchor with a piece of a broken
grappling which I got out of the ship.

Having secured my boat, I took my gun and went on shore, climbing up
on a hill, which seemed to overlook that point, where I saw the full extent of
it, and resolved to venture.

In my viewing the sea from that hill where I stood, I perceived a strong.
and indeed a most furious current, which ran to the east, and even came close
to the point; and I took the more notice of it, because I saw there might
be some danger, that, when I came into it, I might he carried out to sea by
the strength of it, and not be able to make the island again: and, indeed,
hadI not got first upon this hill, I believe it would have been so: for there
was the same current on the other side the island, only that it set at? at a
farther distance, and I saw there was a strong eddy under the shore; so I
had nothing to do but to get out of the first current, and I should presently
be in an eddy.

I lay here, however, two days, because the wind blowing pretty fresh at
E. S. E., and that being just contrary to the said current, made a great breach
of the sea upon the point; so that it was not safe for me to keep too close to
the shore, for the breach, nor to go too far off, because of the stream.

The third day, in the morning, the wind having abated over-night, the
sea was calm, and I ventured; but I am a warning-piece again to all rash
and ignorant pilots; for no sooner was I come to the point, when I was not ,
even my boat's length from the shore, butI found myself in a great depth of
water, and the current like the sluice of a mill: it carried my boat along
with it with such violence, that all lcould do could not keep her so much as
on the edge of it; but 'I found it hurried me farther and farther out from the
eddy, which was on my lefl hand. There was no wind stirring to help me,
and all I could do with my paddles signified nothing: and now I began_to
give myself over for lost; for, as the current was on both sides of the island,
I knew in a few leagues distance they must join again, and then I was irre-
coverably gone; nor did I see any possibility of avoiding it: so that I had no
prospect before me but of perishing, not by the sea, for that was calm enough,
hat of starving for hunger. I had indeed found a tortoise on the shore, as
lung almost as I could lid, and had tossed it into the boot; and I had a great
jar offsesh water, that is to say, one of my earthen pots; but what was all
this to being driven into the vast was, where, to he sure, there was no
shore, no main land or island, for a thousand leagues at least!

And now I saw how easy it was for the providence of_God to make even
the. most miserable condition of mankind worse. Now Hooked back upon
my desolate solitary island as the most pleasant place in the world; and all
the happiness my heart could wish for was to be but there again. I stretched
out my hands to it, with eager wishes: '0 happy desert,' said I, ' I shall
never see thee more. 0 miserable creature! whither am! going l' Then 1
rcpt-cached myself with my unthankful temper, and how I had repined at
my solitary condition; and now what would I give to be on shore there
again i Thus we never see the true state of our condition till it is illu-
strated to us by its contraries, nor'know how to value what we enjoy but
by the want of it. It is scarce possible to imagine the coastemation I was
now in, being driven from my beloved island (for so it appeared to me now to
be) into the wide ocean almost two leagues, and in the utmost despair or
ever recovering it again. However, I worked hard till indeed my strength
was almost exhausted, and kept my. boat as much to the northward, that is.
towards the side of the Current which the eddy lay on, as poaibly I could;
when about noon, as the sun passed the meridian. I thought I felt a little
breeze of wind in my Eace, springing up from 5.8.1:). This cheered my
heart a little, and especially when, in about half an hour more it blew a
pretty gentle gale. By this time I was got at a frightful distance from the
island, and, had the least cloudy or hazy weather intervened, I had been on-
done another way too; for Ihad no compass on board, and should never
have known how to have steered towards the" island, if 1 had but once lost
sight slit 3 but the weather continuing clear, I applied myselfto get up my
mast again, and spread my sail, standing away to the north as much as posp
sible, to get out otthe current.

Just as I had set my mast and sail, and the boat began to stretch away, I
saw, even by the clearance of the water, some alteration of the current was
near; for, where the current was so strong, the water was foul; but, per~
ceiving the water clear, I found the current abate; and presently I found to
the east, at about halt" a mile, a breach of the sea upon some rocks: these
rocks, I found, caused the current to part again; and as the main stress of it
ran away more southwardly, leaving the rocks to the north-east, so the other
returned by the repulse of the rocks, and made a strong eddy. which ran
back again to the north-west, with a very sharp stream.

They who know what it is to have a reprieve brought to them'upon the
ladder, or to be rescued from thieves just going to murder them, or who
have been in such--like extremities, may guess what my presentlsurprise 0!
joy was, and have gladly Iput my boat into the stream of this eddy; and.
the wind also freshening, how gladly I spread my sail to it, running cheer-
fully before the wind, and with a strong ride or eddy under foot.

This eddy carried me about a league in my war back again, directly to-9" THE LIFE AND anvsrtrunns

wards the island, but about two leagues more to the northward than the
current which carried me away at first ; so that, when I cameuear the island,
I found myself Open to the northern shore of it, that is to say, the other end
of the island, opposite to that which I went out from.

When I had made something more than a league of way, by the help of
this current or eddy, I found it was spent, and served me no further. How-
ever, I found that, being between two great currents, viz, that on the south
side, which had hurried use away, and that on the north, which lay about it
league on the other side ; I say, between these two, in the wake of the island,
I found the water at least still, and running no way; and having still a
breeze of wind fair for me, I kept on steering direLtly for the island, though

not making such fresh way as I did before:

About four o'clock in the evening, being then within a league of the island.
I found the point of the rocks, which occasioned this disaster, stretching out,
as is described before, to the southward, and, casting oil the current more
southwardly, had, of course, made another eddy to the north; and this I
found very strong, but not directly setting the way my course lay (which
was due west), but almost full north. However, having a fresh gale, I
stretched across this eddy, slanting northwest: and, in about an hour, came
within nearly a mile of the shore, where, it being smooth water, I soon got
to land.

When I was on shore, I fell on my knees. and gave God thanks for my
preservation, resolving to lay aside all thought: of my deliverance by my
boot; and, refreshing myself with sac-h things as I had, I brought my boat
close to the shore, in a little cove that I had spied under some trees, and.
laid the down to sleep, being quite spent with the labour and fatigue of the
voyage.

I was now at a great loss which way to get home with my heat: I had run
so much hazard, and knew too much ofthe case to think of attempting it by
the way I went out; and what might be at the other side (I mean the west
side),l knew not; nor had I any mind to run any more ventures; so I only,
resolved in the morning to make my way westward along the shore, and to
see if there was no creek whore! might lay up my frigate in safety, so as to
have her again if I wanted her. In about three miles, or thereobout, coast-
ing the shore, I came to a very good inlet or bay, about a mile over, which
narrowed till it came to a very little rivulet or brook. where i found a very
convenient harbour for my boot, and where she lay as if she had been in
a little dock mode on purpose for her. Here I put in, and, having stowed
my boat very safe, I went on shore to look about nun-end see where I was.

I soon found I had but a little passed by the place where I had been be-
fore, when I travelled on foot to that shore; so, tailing nothing out of my
hoot but my gun and umbrella, for it was exceeding hot,I began my match.
The way was comfortable enough afler such a voyage as Ihad been upon,
and I rancher! my- old bower in the evening. where I found every thing
standing as I left it; for I always kept it in good order, being, as I said be-
fore, my country house.

I got over the fence, and laid me down in the shade, to rest my limbs, for
iwas rery' weary, and fell asleep.- bnt judge you, if you can, that read my
story, what a surprise I must be in, when I was awaited out otmy sleep by
a voice, calling me by my name several times. ' Robin, Robin, Robin Crusoe;
poor Robin Crusoe! Where are you, Robin Crusoe? Where are 'yout
Where have you been 1'

I was so dead asleep at first, being fatigued with roping, or paddling, as
it is called, the first part of the day, and with walking the latter part, that
I did not wake thoroughly; but, dozing between sleeping and waking,
thought I dreamed that somebody spoke to me; but, as the voice continued
to repeat ' Robin Crusoe, Robin Crusoe,' at last I began to wake more per-
fectly, and was at first dreadfully frightened, and started up in the utmost
consternation; but no sooner were my eyes open but I saw my Poll sitting
on the top of the badge, and immediately knew it was he that spoke to me ;
for just in such bemoaning language! had used to talk to him, and teach
him; and he had learned it so perfectly, that he would sit upon my finger,
and lay his bill close to my face, and cry ' Poor Robin Crusoe! Where are
you? Where have you becnt How came you here 3' and such things as
I had taught him.

However, even though I knew it was the parrot, and that indeed it could
he nobody else, it was a good while before I could compose myself. First,
I was amazed how the creature got thither; and then how he should just
keep about the place, and no where else : but, as I was well satisfied it
could be nobody but honest Poll, I got over it; and, holding out my hand,
and ceiling him by his name, ' Poll,' the sociable creature came to me, and set
upon my thumb, as he used to do, and continued talking to me, ' Poor Robin
Crntoel and haw did I come here? and where had I been 1' just as it he had
been overjoyed to see me again: and so I carried him home along with me.

I now had enough of rambling to sea for some time, and had enough to
do for many days to sit still, and reflect upon the danger I had been in. I
would have been very glad to have had my boat again on my sideof the
island; but I knew not how it was practicable to get it about. As to the
east side of the island, which I had gone round, I knew well enough there
was no venturing that way; my very heart would shrink, and my very
blood run chill, but to think of it; and, as to the other side of the island, I
did not know how it might be there; but, supposing the current ran with
the same force against the shore at the east as it passed by it on the other, I
might run the some risk of being driven down the stream. had carried by '
the island. as I had been before of being carried away from it; so,with these
thoughts, I contented myself to be without any boat, though it had been
the product of so many months" labour to make it, and of so many more to
get it into the sea. - ,

-In this government of my temper I remained near a year; lived a very
sedate, retired life as you may well suppose; and my thoughts being very
much composed as to my condition, and fully comforted in resigning myself
' to the disposition"! Providence, I thought I lived really very happily' in all
things except that of society.94 I was use um 501722619333

Besides this, l arrived at an unexpected perfection in my earthenware,
and contrived well enough to' make them with a wheel, which I found in-
finitely easior and better; bmonse I made things. round and shapeable,
which before were filthy things: indeed toloolt on, - flat I think} was never
more vein of my own performance, or more joyful for anything I found
out, than for my being able to make a tobacco-pipe; and, though it was: a
very ugly clmnsy thing when it was done, and only burnt red, like other
earthenware, yet, as it was hard and firm, and would draw the smoke, l
was, exceedingly comforted with it, for I had been ,olways used to smoke:
and there were pipes in the ship, but i forgot them at (first, not thinking that
' there was tobacco in the island; and afterwards, when I searched the ship
again, I could not come at any pipes at all.

. In my wicker-ware, also. I improved much, and made abundance of no;

cassery baskets, as well as my invention shewed me: though not very hand-
some, yet they were such as were very handy and oonienient for my laying
things up in, or fetching things home. For,- example, if I killed a goat
abroad, I could hang it up in 9 tree,- day it, drefilit, and cut it in pieces,
and bring it home in a basket: and the like by a turtle; I could cut it up,
take out the eggs, and a .piece or two of the _tle_sb,whiclx was enough for
me, and bring them home in a basket, and leave the rest behind me. Also
large deep baskets were the receivers of my earn, which [always rubbed
out as soon as it was dry, and cured, and kept-it in great basket}. .

I began now to perceive my powder abated considerably: this was a
want which it was impossible for me to supply, and I began seriously to
consider what I must do when I should have no more powder; that is to
say, how I should do to kill any goats. 1 had, as is observed, in the third
year ol'my being here, kept a young kid, and bred her up tame, and I was
in hopes of getting a hogoat: but i could not by any means bring it to
peas, till my kid grew an old goat; and, as I could never find in my heart
to kill her, she died at last of were age.

But being now in the eleventh year of my residence, and, as! have said,
my ammunition growing low, I set myself to study some art to trap and
snare the goats, to see whether I could not catch some of them alive; and,
particularly. I wanted a she-goat great with young. :For this purpose I
made snares to hamper them; and I do believe they were more than once
taken in them, but my tooklewas not good, for I had no wire; and I always
found them broken, and my bait devoured. At length lresolred tots! o

gone: this was rcry discouraging. However, I altered my traps; and, a."
to trouble you with particulars, going one morning to see my traps, I found
inone ofthem a large old he-goahandin oneo! the others three kids,s
male and two females. '

As to the old one. I- knew not what tndo with- him; he was sofierce, I _
durst not go into the pit to_him; that is to say, to go about to bring him
away alive, which was what I wanted : I could have killed him, but that
was not my business, nor. would it answer my end; so I even let him out, and
he ran away, as if he had been frightened out of his wits. But I had forgot
then, what I had learned atterwards, that hunger will tame a lion. I". had
let him stay there three. ornt'our days without food, and then have carried _
him some water to drink, and than a little corn, he would have been- as
tame as one of the kids; for they are mighty sagacious, tractable creatures,
where they are well used.

However, for the present, I let him go, knowing no better at that time:

- then I went to the three kids, and, taking them one by one, I tied themwith
strings together,'and withs'om'e dificulty brought them all home;

It was a good while before they would feed; but, throwing them some
sweet corn, it tempted thcm, -and they began to be tame. And now I found
that, if I espected to supply myself with. goat's flesh when I had no powder
or shot left, breeding some up tame was my only way, when, perhang I
might have them about my houselikc a. flock of sheep. But; thenit oc-
curred to me that I must keep the tame from the wild, peelse they would '
always run wild'w'hen they grew np : and. the only "ya: this was, so

to keep them in so etfectnally, that those within might not break, out, or_

this thought occurred to me ; sol presently stopped short. and, tbr the first
beginning, 1 resolved to enclose a piece of about we yards in length, and
100 yards in breadth; which, as it would maintain as many as I should have
in any reasonable time, so, as my stock increased, I could add more ground
to my enclosure.

This was acting with some prudence, and 1 went to work with courage.
I was about three months hedging in the first piece; and, till l had done it,
I tethered the tissue kids in the best part of it, and used them to feed as near
me as possible, to make them tiuniliar; and very oilen i would go and carry
them some cars of barley, or a handful of rice, and feed them out of in}- luuul:
so that, alter my enclosure was finished, and i let them loose, they would
follow me up and down, bloating after me for a handful of com.

This answered my end; and, in about a year and a half; I had a flock of
about twelve goats, kids and all; and in two years more Iliad three-and
forty, besides several that I took and killed for my food. After that I en-
closed live several pieces of ground to feed them in, with little pens to drive
them into, to take them as I wanted, and gates out of one piece of ground
into another.

But this was not all g for now I not only had goat's flesh to feed on when
I pleased, but milk too; a thing which, indeed, in the beginning, I (lid not
so much as think of, and which, when it came into my thoughts, was really
an agreeable surprise: for now I set up my dairy, and had tometimcs a
gallon or two of milk in a day. And as Nature, who gives supplies of food
to every creature, dictates even naturally how to make use of it; so I, that
had never milked a cow, much less a goat, or seen butter or cheese made,
only when l was a boy, tailor a great many essays and miscarriages, made
me both butter and cheese at, last, and also salt (though I found it partly
made to my hand by the heat of the sun upon some of the rocks of the sea),
and never wanted it afterwards. How mercifully can our Creator treat his
creatures, even in those conditions. in which they seemed to be overwhelmed
in destruction! How can he sweeten the bitterest providence; and give on
cause to praise him for dungeons and prisons! What a table was here
spread for me in a wilderness, where I saw nothing, at first, but to perish
for hunger! ~

It would have made a stoic smile to have. seen me and my little family cit
down to dinner: there was my majesty, the prince and lord of the whole
island; I had the lives of all my subjects at my absolute commend; I could
hang, draw, give liberty, and take it away; and no rebels among all my
subjects. Then to see how like a king Idined too, all alone, attended by
my servants: Poll, as if he had been my favourite, was the only person per-
mitted to talk to me. M 3/ dog, who was now grown very old and crazy, and
had found no species to multiply his kind upon, sat always at my right hand;
and two can, one on one side of the table, and one on the other, expecting
new and then a bit from my hand, as a mark of tpecial favour.

But these were not the two cat: which I brought one shore at first, for
they were both of them dead. and had been interred near my habitation by .
my own hand; but one of them having multiplied by I know not what kind
of creature, these were two which I had preserved tame; whereas the rest
ran wild in the woods, and became indeed troublesome to me at last; for
they would often come into my house, and plunder me too, till at last I was
obliged to shoot them, and did kill a great many; at length they left me.--
VVith this attendance, and in this plentiful manner, I lived; neither could I
be said to want any thing but society: and of that, some time after this, I
was like to have too much.

I was something impatient, as I have observed, to have the use of my boat,
though very loth to run any more hazards; and therefore sometimes I sat
coutriving ways to get her about the island, and at other _times I sat myself
down contented enough without her. But I had a strange uneasiness in my
mind to go _down to the point of the island, where, as I have said, in my last
ramble, I went up the hill to see how the shore lay, and how the current set,
that I might see what I had to do: this inclination increased upon me every
day, and at length I resolved to travel thither by land, following the edge of
the shore. I did so; but had any one in England been to meet such a man
as I was, it must either have frightened him, or raised a great deal of laughter :
and, as I frequently stood still to look at myself, I could not but smile at the
notion of my travelling through Yorkshire with such an equipage. and in
such a drem. Be pleased to take a sketch of my figure, as follows :--

I had a great, high, shapeless cap, made of a goat's skin, with a flap hang-
ing down behind, as well to keep the sun from me as to shoot the rain of
from running into my neck: nothing being so hurtful in these climates as
the rain upon the flesh, under the clothes.

I had a short jacket of goat's skin, the skirts coming down to about the
middle of the thighs, and a pair of Open-kneed breechcs of the same: the
breeches were made of the skin of an old he-goat, whose hair hung down
such a length on either side, that, like pantaloons, it reached to the middle of
mylegs. Stockings and shoes I had none, but had made me a pair of some-
things, I scarce know what to call them, like buskius, to flap over my legs,
and lace on either side, like spatter-dashes; but of a most barbarous shape, as
indeed were all the rest of my clothes.

I had on a broad belt of goat's skin dried, which I drew together with two
thongs of the same, instead of buckles; and, in a kind of a frog on either side
of this, instead of a sword and dagger, hung a little saw and a hatchet; one
on one side, and one on the other. I had another belt, not so broad, and
fastened in the same manner, which hung over my shoulder; and at the end
of it, under my left arm, hung two pouches, both made of goat's skin too; in
one of which hung my powder, in the other my shot. At my back I carried
my buket, and on my shoulder my gun; ard, over my head, a great, clumsy,
ugly goat's skin umbrella, but which, after all, was the mm necessary thing
I had about'ane, next to my gun. As for my face, the colour of it was really
not so mulatto-like as one might expect from a man not at all careful of it,
and living within nine or ten degrees ofthe equinox. My heard I had once
suffered to grow till it was about a quarter of a yard long; but, as I had

both scissors and razor: suflioieut, I had cut it pretty short. except'wlnt
grew on my upper lip, which I had trimmed into a. large pair of Mahomehn
whiskers, such as I had seen worn by some Turks at Sallee; for the Moon
did not wear ouch, though the Turin did: of these munchies or whisker>>
I will not any they were long enough to hang .my hat upon them, but they
were of a length and shape monstrous enough, and such as, in England.
would have pained for frightfhl.

But all this in by-the--by; for, as to my figure, 1 bad so few to observe me,
that it was of no manner of consequence; to I any no more to that part. In
this kind of figure 1 went my new journey, and was out five or six days. I
travelled that along the seashore, directly to the place where! first brought
my boat to an anchor, to get upon the rocks ; and. having no boat now to
take care of, I went over the land, a nearer way, to the same height that I
was upon before; when, looking- fonvard to the point of the rocks which lay
out, and which I was obliged to double with my boat, at in said above,1
was surprised to see the see all smooth and quiet; no ripphng, no motion,
no current, any more there than in any other places. I was at a strange lose
to understand this, and resolved to spend some time in the observing it, to
see if nothing from the sets of the tide had occasioned it; but I was presently
convinced how it wan rim, that the tide of ebb setting from the we", and
joining with the current of waters from some great river on the shore, must
be the occasion of this current; and that, according as the wind blew more
forcibly from the west, or from the north, this current name nearer, or went
farther from the shore; for, waiting thereabouts till evening, I went up to
the melt again, and then the tide of ebb being made, I plainly saw the'cur-
rent again as before, only that it ran farther otl', being uearhalf aleague
from the shore; whereas, in my case. it set close upon the abort, and hurried
me and my canoe along with it ; which, at another time, it would not
have done.

This observation convinced me that I had nothing to do but to observe
the ebbing and the flowing of the tide, and I might very easily bring my
boat about the island agaxn: but, when I began to think of putting it to
practice, I had such a terror upon my spirits, at the remembrance of the
danger I had been in, that I could not think of it again with any patience;
but. on the contrary, I took up another resolution, which was more safe,
though more laborious; and this was, that I would build, or rather make me
another periagna or canoe; and so have one for one side of the island, and
one for the other.

You are to understand that now I had, as I may call it, two plantation: in
the island; one. my little fortification or tent, with the well about it. under
the rock, with the cave behind me, which, by this time. I had enlarged into
neveral apartments, or caves, one within another. One of these, which won
the driest and largest, and bad a door out beyond my wall or fortification. that
is to any, beyond where my wall joined to the rock, was all filled up with
the large earthen pots, 0! which [have given an account, and with fourteen
orfiheeu great baskets which would hold five or six bushels each. where g'F'i-'V'Sm' . . . '1Y=-'--. _ ' "C'

laid up my storesolprovision,especiallymycdru,someintheesr,cutofl'
short from the straw, and the other rubbed out with my hand.

As for my wall, made, as before, with long stakes or piles, those piles grew
all like trees, and'were by thistime grown so big, and spread so very much,
that there was not'the least appearance, to any one's view, of any habitation
behind them.

Near this dwelling of mine, but a little farther within the land, and upon
lower ground, lay my two pieces of corn land, which I kept duly cultivated
and sowed, and which duly yielded me their harvest in its season: and,
whenever I had occasion for more corn, I had more land adjoining, as fit
as that.

Besides this, I had my country seat; and I had now a tolerable plantation
there also: tor. first, I had my little bower, as I called it, which I kept in
repair; thatlis to say, I kept the hedge which encircled it in constantly fitted
up to its usual height, the ladder standing always in the inside : I kept the
trees, which at first were no more than my stakes, but were now grown
very firm and tall, always out so, that they might spread, and grow thick-and
wild, and make the more agreeable shade; which they did efi'ectually to my
mind. In the middle of this I had my tent always standing, being a piece
of a sail spread over the poles, set up for that purpose, and which never
wanted any repair or renewing; and under this 1 had made me a squah or
couch, with the skins of the creatures I had killed, and with other sou things;
and a blanket laid on them, such as belonged to our sea-bedding, which I
had saved, and a great watch-coat to cover me; and here, whenever I had
oceasion'to be absent from my chief seat, I took up my country habitation.

Adjoining to this] had my enclosures for my cattle, that is to say, my
goats ; and, as I had taken an inconceivable deal of pains to fence and enclose
the ground, 1 was so anxious to see it kept entire, lest the goats should break
through, that I never left ofl' till, with infinite labour, '1 had stuck the'odtside
of the hedge so full of small stakes, and so near to one another, that it was
rather a pale than a hedge, and there was scarce room to put a hand through
between them , which, afterwards, "when those stakes grew, as they all did
in the next rainy season, made the enclosure strongy like a wall,--iudeed
stronger than any wall.

This will testify for me that I was not idle, and that I spared no pains to
oring to pass whatever appeared necessarylor my comfortable support: for

considered the keeping up a breed of tame creatines thus at my hand
would be a living magazine of flesh, milk, butter, and cheese, for me, as long

deed. they were not only agreeable, but medicinal, wholesome, nounshmg,
and refreshing to the last degree.

. As this was also about half--way between my other habitation and the place
where I had laid up my boat, I generally stayed and lay here in my way
thither; for I used frequently to visit my boat ; and I kept all things about,
or belonging to her, in very good order: sometimes I went out in her to
divert myself; but no more hazardous voyages would I go, nor scarce ever
above a stone' s cast or two from the shore, I was so apprehensive of being
hurried out of my knowledge again by the currents or winds, or any other
accident. But now I come to a new scene of my life.

It happened one day, about noon, going towards my boat, I was exceed-
ingly surprised with the print of a man's naked foot on the shor'Mhich-was
very plain to be seen in the sand. I stood like one thunder-stack, or as it
I had seen an 'apparition: I listened, I looked round me, but I could hear
nothing, nor see any thing: I went up to a rising ground, to look farther;
I went up the shore and down the shore, but it was all one; I could-see no
other impression but that one. I went to it again to see it' there were any
more, and to observe ifit might not be my fancy; but there was no room for
that, for there was exactly the print of a foot, toes, heel, and every part of a
foot: how it came thither I knew not, nor could I in the least imagine; but,
after innumerable fluttering thoughts, like a man perfectly confused and out
of myself, I came home to my fortification, not feeling, as we say, the ground
I went on, but terrified to the last degree; looking behind me at every two
or three steps, mistaking every bush and tree, and fiIncying every stump at
a distance to be a man. Nor is it possible to describe how many various
shapes my afi'righted imagination represented things to me in, how many
wild ideas were found every moment in my fancy, and what strange unac-
countable whimsies came into my thoughts by the way.

When I came to my castle (for so I think I called it ever after this), I fled
into it like one pursued: whether I went over by the ladder, as first con-
trived, or went in at the hole in. the rock, which I had called a door, I can-
not remember; no, nor could I remember the next morning; for never
frightened hare fled to cover, or fox to earth, with more terror of mind than
I to this retreat.

I slept none that night: the farther l was from the occasion of my fright,
the greater my apprehensions were; which is something contrary to the
nature of such things, and especially to the usual practice of all creatures in
fear: but I was so embarramcd with my own frightful ideas of the thing,
that I formed nothing but dismal imaginations to myself, even though I was
now a great way off it. Sometimes I fancied it must bathe deviLsnd reason

fornopurposstoqfoehe couldhot be-sure I should seem--this was an
amusement the other way. I considered that the devil might have found"-
-out abundance of other ways to have terrified me than thisof thesingls

never have been so simple as to leaveamarkinaplace whereitwasten

' thoimnd to one whether I should eversee it ornot; andinthesandtoo,
which theirst surge of the sea, upon a high wind, would have defaced en-
tirely: all this seemed inconsistent with the thing itself, and with all the
notions we usually entertain of the subtilty ot' the devil.

Abundanceofsuchthingsastheseassistedtoarguemeont ofall appre-
hensions of its being the devil; and l presently concluded then that it must
be some more dangerous creature, viz., that it must be some of the savagesot'
the main land over-against me, who had wandered out to sea in their canoes.
and, either driven by the currents or by contrary winds. had made the'islaud,
and had been on shore, but were gone away again to sea,. being as loth, '
perhaps, to have stayed in this desolate island, as I would have been to have
had them.

While these reflections were rolling upon my mind, I was very thanhm]
in my thoughts that I was so happy as not to be thereabonts at that time, or
that they did not see my boat, by which they would have concluded that
some inhabitants had been in the place, and perhaps have searched farther
for me: then terrible thoughts racked my imagination about their having
found my boat, and that there were people here; and that, if so, I should
certainly have them come again in greater numbers, and devour me; that if
it should happen so that they should not find me, yet they would find my en-
closure, deatroy all my corn, and carry away all my flock of tame goats, and
I phould perish at last for mere want.

Thus my fear banished all my religious hope, all that formenconfldence in
God,'which was founded upon such wonderful experience as I had had of
his goodness, as if he that had fed me by miracle hitherto could not preserve,
by his power, the provision which he had made for me by his goodness. ._
I reproached myself with my laziness, that would not sow any more corn
one year than would just serve me till the next season, as if no accident
would intervene to prevent my enjoying the crop that was upon the ground;
and this I thoughtso just a reproof, that I resolved for the future to have two
or three years' corn beforehand; so that, whatever might come, I might not
perish for want of bread.

smiled silent life; that I was as one whom Heaven thought not worthy/to be
numbered among the living, or to appear among the rest of his creatures;
that to have seen one of my own species would have seemed to me a raising me
from death to life, and the greatest blessing that Heaven itself, next to the
supreme blessing of salvation, could bestow ; I say, that I should now tremble
at the very apprehensions of seeing a man, and was ready to sink into the
ground at but the shadow or silent appearance of a man's having set his fod
in the island.

Such is the uneven state of human life; and it afi'orded me a great many
curious speculations afterwards. When I had a little recovered my first sur-
prise, I considered that this was the station of life the infinitely wise and
good providence of God had determined for me; that, as I could not foresee
what the ends of divrne wisdom might be in all this, so I was not to dispute
his sovereignty, who, as I was his creature, had an undoubted right. by cre-
ation, to govern and dispose of me absolutely as he thought fit; and who, as
I was a creature that had ofl'endcd him, had likewise a judicial right to con.
demn me to what punishment he thought fit; and that it was my part to
submit to hear his indignation, because I had sinned against him. I then
reflected, that as God, who was not only righteous, but omnipotent, had
thought fit thus to punish and afllict me, so he was able to deliver me; that,
if he did not think fit to do so, it was my unquestioned duty to resign myself
absolume and entirely to his will: and, on the other hand, it was my duty
also to hope in him, pray to him, and quietly to attend the dictates and di-
rectious of his daily providem

These thoughts took me up many hours, days, nay, I may say, weeks and
months; and one particular effect of my cogitations on this occasion I cannot
omit :----0ne morning early, lying in my bed, and filled with thoughts about
my danger from the appearances of savages, I found it discomposed me very
much; upon which these words of the Scripture calm into my thoughts,
' Call upon me in the day of trouble, and I will deliver thee, and thou shalt
glorify me.' Upon this, rising cheerfully out of my bed, my heart was not
only comforted, but I was guided and encouraged to pray earnestly to God '
for deliverance. When I had done praying, I took up myBible, and, opening
it to read, the first words that presented to me were, ' Wait on the Lord,
and be of good cheer, and he shall strengthen thy heart; wait, I say, on the
Lord.' It is impossible to express the comfort this gave me. In answer, I
thankfully laid down the book, and was no more sad, at least on that
occasion. .

In the middle of these cog'itations, apprehensions, and reflections, it came
into my thoughts one day that all this might be a mere chimera of my own,
and that this foot might be the print of my own foot, when I came on shore
from my boat. This cheered me up a little too, and I began to persuade-
rnyselt' it was all a delusion; that it was nothing else but my own foot; and
why might I not come that way from the boat, as well as I was going that
way to the boat? Again, I considered, also, that I could by no means tell, for
certain, where I had trod, and where I hadnotiand,' thirtit', atlast, this was ,
only the print of my own fool, I had played the part ofthose'fools who try
tomake stories ofspec'tres and apparitions, and then are hightened at then
more than any body. - '

Now I began to take courage, and to peep abroad again, for I had not
stirred out ofmy castle for three days and nights, so that I began to starve
for provisions; for I had little or nothing within doors butsome barley cakes
and water: then I knew that my goats wanted to be milked too, which
usually was my evening diversion; and the poor creatures were in great
pain and inconvenience for want of it; and, indeed, it almost spoiled some
of them, and nearly dried up their milk; Encouraging myself; therefore.
with the belief that th1s was nothing but the print atone of my own feet,

and that I might be truly said to start at my own shadow, I began to go
abroad again, and went to my country-bonnie milk my flock: but to see
with what fear I went forward, how often I looked behind me, how I' was
ready, every now and then, to lay down my basket, and run 'for my lifetit
would have made any one thought I was haunted with a'n-evil conscience,
or that I had been lately most terribly frightened; and so, indeed; I had.
However, as I went down thus two or three days, and having seen nothing,
I began to be a little bolder, and to think there was really nothing. in itibut
my own imagination, but I could not persuade myself fully of this till I
should go down to the shore again, and see this print of a foot, and measure '
it by my own, and see if there was any similitnde or fitness, that I might be
asured it was my own foot: but when I came to the place, first, it appeared .
evidently to me, that, when I laid up my boat, I could not possibly be on
shore any where thereabout: secondly, when I came to measure the mark
with my own foot, I found my foot not so large by a greatdeal. Both these
things filled my head with new imaginations, and gave me the vapours again
to the highest degree, so that I shook with cold like one in an ague; and I
went home again, filled with the belief that some man or men had bean on
shore there; or, in short, that the island was inhabited, and I might be sur-
prised before I was aware; and what course to take formy security I knew not.

Oh! what_ ridiculous resolutions m'en take when pocemed with fear! It
deprives them of the use of those means which reason ofi'ers for their relief.
The first thing I proposed to myself was to throw down my enclosures, and
turn all my tame cattle wildinto the woods, lest the enemy should find them,
and then frequent the island 1n prospect of the same or the like botjr: then
to the simple thing of digging up my two corn-fields, lesfth'ey shohld find
such agrain there,'and still be prompted to frequent the island: then to
demolish my bower and tent, that they might not see any vestiges of baht;
tation, and be prompted to look farther, 1n order to find out the penan-
inhabiting.

These were the subject ofthe first night's cogitations afier I was com.
home again, while the apprehensio'us which had so overrun my mind were

the evil nihich we are anxious about: and, which woe worse than all thin,
3 had not that relief in this trouble, from the resignation 1 used to practise,
that I hoped to have. Hooked, I thought, like Saul, who complained not
only that the l'llilistines were upon him, but that God had forsaken him;
for] did not now take due ways to compose my mind, by crying to God in
my distress, and resting upon his providence, as I had done before, for my
defence and deliverance; which, if I had done, 1 had at least been anore
cheerfully supported under this new sorprim, and perhaps carried through
it with more resolution.

This confusion of my thoughts kept me awake all night: but in the
morning I fell asleep; and having, by the amusement of my mind, been. as
it were, tired, and my spirits exhausted, I dept very soundly, and waited
much better composed than I had ever been before. And now I began to
think sedately; and, upon the utmost debate with myself, I concluded that
this island, which W32; so exceeding pleasant, fruitful, and no farther from the
mainland than an I had seen, was not mentirely abandoned as 1 might imagine;
that, although there were no stated inhabitants who lived on the spot, yet
that there might sometimes come boats 06' from the shore, who, either with
design, or perhaps never but when they were driven by cross winds, might
come to this place; that 1 had lived here fifteen years now, and had not
met with the least shadow or figure of any people yet; and that, if at any
time they should be driven here, it was probable they went away again as
soon as ever they could, seeing they had never thought fit to fix here upon
any occasion; that the most I could suggest any danger from was from any
casual occidental landing of straggling people from the main, who, as it was
likely, if they were driven hither, were here against their wills, so they made
no stay here, but went ofi' again with all possible speed; seldom staying one
night on shore, lest they should not have the help of the tides and daylight
back again; and that, therefore, {had nothing to do but to consider of some
safe retreat, in ease I should see any savages land upon the spot.

Now I began sorely to repent that! had dug my cave so large as to bring
a door through again, which door, as l said, came out beyond where my
fortification joined to the rock: upon maturely considering this, therefore,
lreuolved to draw me a second fortification, in the some manner of a semi~
circle, at a distance from my wall, just where I had planted a double row of
trees about twelve years before, of which I made mention: these trees
having been planted so thick before, they wanted but few piles to be driven
between them, that they might be thicker and stronger. and my wall would
beacon finished: so that I had now a double wall; and my outer wall was
thickened with pieces of timber, old cables, and every thing {could think
of, to make it strong; having in it seven little holes, about as big as I might
put my am out at. In the inside of this, [thickened my wall to about ten
teet thick, with continually bringing earth out of my cave, and laying it a:
the foot of the wall, and walking upon it; and through the seven holea I
mnlrived to plant the musicals, of which I took notice that 1 land got seven

into frames, that held them like a carriage, so that I could fire all the seven
guns in two minutes' time: this wall I was many a weary month in finishing,-
and yet never thought myself safe till it was done.

When this was done, I stuck all the ground without my wall, for a great
length every way, as full with stakes, or sticks, of the osier-like wood, which
I found so apt to grow, as they could well stand; insomuch, that I believe
I might set in near twenty thousand of them, leaving a pretty large space be.
tween them and my wall, that I might have room to see an enemy, and they
might have no shelter from the young trees, if they attempted to approach
my outer" wall.

Thus, in two years' time, 'I had a thick grove; and in five or six years'
time I had a wood before my dwelling, growing so- monstrous thick and
strong, that it was, indeed, perfectly impassable; and no men, of what kind
soever, would ever imagine that there was any thing beyond it, much less
a habitation. As for the way which I proposed to myself to go in and out

(for I let! no avenue), it was by setting two ladders, one to a part of the
rock which was low, and then broke in, and left room to place another

ladder upon that; so, when the two ladders were taken down, no man living
could come down to me without doing himself mischief; and, if they had
come down, they were still on the outside of my outer wall.

Thus I took all the measures human prudence could suggest for my own
preservation; and it will be seen, at length, that they were not altogether.
without just reason; though I foresaw nothing at that time more than mp.
mere fear suggested to me.

While this was doing I was not altogether careless of my other affairs,
for I had a great concern upon me for my little herd of goats: they were.
not only a ready supply to me on every occasion, and began to be sufficient
for me, without the expense of powder and shot, but also without the fatigue
of hunting alter the wild ones; and I was loth to lose the advantage of them,
and to have them all to nurse up over again.

For this purpose, after long consideration, I could think of but two ways,
to preserve them: one was, to find another convenient place to dig a cave
under ground, and to drive them into it every night; and the other was, to.
enclose two or three little bits of land, remote from one another, and as
much concealed as I could, where I might keep about halfa dozen young
goats in each place; so that, if any disaster happened to the flock in general,
I might be able to raise them again with little trouble and time: and this,
though it would require a great deal of time and labour, I thought was the
most rational design.

Accordingly, I spent some time to find out the most retired parts of the
island; and I pitched upon one, which was as private, indeed, as my heart
could wish for : it was a little damp piece of ground, in the middle of the
hollow and thick woods, where, as is observed, I almost lost myself once be-
fore, endeavouring to come back that way from the eastern part of, the
island. Here I found a clear piece of land, near three acres Io surrounded
with woods that it was almost an enclosure by nature; at least, it did not

Worked so hard at.

I immediately went to work with this piece of ground; and in less than n
month's time I had so fenced it round, that my dock, or herd, call it which
you please, who were not so wild now as at first they might be supposed to
he, were well enough secured in it: so, without any thriller delay,l removed
ten young shegonts and two hegoots to this piece; and, when they were
there, I continued to perfect the fence, till I had made it as secure as the
other; which, however, I did at more leisure, and it took me up more time
by a great deal. All this labour I was at the expense of, purely from my
apprehensions on the account of the print of a. man's foot which I had seen;
for, as yet, I never saw any human creature come near the island; and I
had now lived two years under this uneasiness, which, indeed, made my life
much less comfortable than it was before, as may be well imagined by any one.
who knows what it is to live in the constant snare of the fear of man. And.
this I must observe, with grief too, that the discomposure of my mind had
too great impressions also upon the religious part of my thoughts: for the
dread and terror of filling into the hands of savages and eannibals lay so
upon my spirits, that I seldom found myself in a due temper for application
to my Maker, at least not with the sedate calmness and resignation of soul.
which I was wont to do : I rather prayed to God as under great wiction
and pressure of mind, surrounded with danger, and in expectation every
night of being murdered and devoured before morning; and I must testify
from my experience, that a temper of peace, thankfolnesn, lore. and afi'ection.
is much the more proper name for prayer than that of terror and discolor
pnsore; and that, under the dread of mischief impending, a man is no
more fit for a comforting performance of the duty of praying to God, than
he is for a repentance on a sick bed ; for these discomposures afl'ect the
mind as the others do the body; and the diecoropoonre of the mind must
necessarily be as great a disability as that of the body, and much greater;
praying to God bemg properly an act of the mind, not of the body.

But to go on: afier I had thus secured one part of my little living stock,
I went about the whole island, searching for another private place to make
such another deposit; when, wandering more to the west point of the island
than I had ever done yet, and looking out to send thought [saw a boat upon.
the sea at a great distance. I had found a perspective glass or two in one
of the seameo's chests, which I saved out of our ship, but I had it not about
me; and this was so remote that I could not tell what to make of it, though
I looked at it till my eyes were not able to hold to look any longer: whether.
it was a boat or not, I do not know, but as I descended from the bill I could
lee no more of it; so I gave it over; only I resolved to go no more out
without a perspective glass in my pocket. When l. was come down the
hill to the end of the island, where, indeed, I had never been before, I was
presently convinced that the seeing the print of a man's foot was not such a
strange thing in the island as I imagined : and, bugthat it was a special pro-
vidence that I was cast upon the side of the islandybere the savages never,
came. [should easily have known that nothing was more frequent than for
the canoes from the main, when they happened to be a little too far out at

would bring them over to this shore, where,' according to their dreadful
customs, being all cannibals, they would kill and eat them; of which here-
afier. .

When I was come down the hill to the shore, as-'I said above, being the
S. W. point of the island, I was perfectly confounded and amazed; nor is it
possible for me to express the horror of my mind, at seeing the shore spread
wrth skulls, hands, feet, and other bones of human bodies;-and, particularly,
1 observed a place where there had been a fire made, and a circle dug in the
earth, like a cock-pit, where I supposed the savage wretches had sat down
to their inhuman feastings upon the bodies of their fellow--creatures.

I was so astonished with the sight of these things, that I entertained no
notions of any danger to myself hour it for a long while : all my appmhem
sions were buried in the thoughts of such a'pitch of inhuman, hellish bru-
tality, and the horror of the degeneracy of human nature, which, though I'
had heard of it often, yet I never had so near a view of before: in short, I'
turned away my face from the horrid spectacle; my stomach grew sick, and I
was just at the point of fainting, when nature discharged the disorder from
my stomach; and, having vomited with uncommon violence, I was a little
relieved, but could not bear to stay in the place a moment; so I got me up
the hill again with all the speed 1 could, and walked on towards my own
habitation.

When I came a little out of that part of the island, I stood still awhile, as
amazed, and then, recovering myself, I looked up with the utmost affection
of my soul, and, with a flood of tears in my eyes, gave God thanks, that had
cast my first lot in a part of the world where I was distinguished from such
dreadful creatures as these; and that, though I had esteemed my present
condition very miserable, had yet given me so many comforts in it, that I
had still more to give thanks for than to complain of: and this, above all,
that I had, even in this miserable condition, been comforted with the know-
.edge of Himself, and the hape of His blaming; which was a feliCity more
than sufficiently equivalent to all the misery which I had sufi'ered, or could
suffer.

In this frame of thankfuluessl went home to my castle, and began to be
much easier now, as to the safety of my circumstances, than ever I was he-
tore: for I observed that these wretches never came to this island in search'
of what they could get; perhaps not seeking, not wanting, or not expecting,
any thing here; and having often, no doubt, been up in the covered, woody
part of it, without finding any thing to their purpose. I knew I had been.
here now almost eighteen years, and never saw the least footsteps'of human
creature there before; and I might be eighteen years more as entirely con:
cealed as I was now, if I did not discover myself tc them, which I'had'no'
manner of occasion to do; it being my only business to keep myself entirely108 a tan use mo anvnn'enaas

balstomake myself known to. Yet [ entertained such an abhorrenceot
the savage wretches that I have been speaking of, and of the wretched. in-
human custom of their devouring and eating one another up, that I con-
tinued pensive and sad, and kept close within my own circle, for almost two
years alter this: when I say my own circle, I mean by it my three plants.
tions, viz, my castle, my country-seat, which,I called my bower, and my
enclosure in the woods: nor did I look after this for any other use than as
an enclosure for my goats; for the aversion which nature gave me to these
hellish wretches was such, that I was as fearful of seeing them as of seeing
the devil himself. I did not so much as go to look after my boat all this
time, but began rather to think of making me another; forol could not
think of ever making any more attempts to bring the other boat round the
island to, me, lest I should meet with som'e of these creatures at sea; in
which case, if I had happened to have fallen into their-hands, I knew what
I would have been my lot.

Time, however, and the satisfaction I had that I was in no danger of being
discovered by these people, began to wear of my uneasiness about them;
and I began to live just in the same composed manner as before; only with
this difference, that I used more caution, and kept my eye more about me,
than I did before, lest I should happen to be seen by any of them; and par?
ticularly I was more cautious of firing my gun, lest any of them, being on
the island, should happen to hear it. It was therefore a very good provi-
dence to me that I had furnished myself with atarne breed of goats. and
that I had no need to hunt any more about the woods, or shoot.at them;
and it'l did catch any otthem after this, it was by traps and snares, as I had
done before: so that, for two years afier thia,1 believe 1 never fired my gun
once ofi', though I never went out without it; and, which was more, as I.
had saved three pistols out of the ship, I always carried them out with me,
or at least two of them, sticking them in my goabskin belt. I also {bro
bished up one of the great cutlasses that I had out of the ship, and made me
a belt to hang it on; so that I was now a most formidable follow to
look at when I went abroad, if you add to the former description of myself
the particular of two pistols, and a great broad-sword hanging at my side in
a_ belt, but without a scabbard.

Things going on thus, as l have said, for some time, I seemed, excepting
these cautions, to be reduced to my former calm sedate way of living. All
these things tended to shew me, more and more, how far my condition was.
from being miserable, compared to some others; nay, to many other par-
ticulars of life, which it might have pleased God to have made my lot. It
put me upon reflecting how little repining there would be among mankind at
any condition of life, if people would rather compare their condition with
those that were worse, in order to be thankful, than be always comparing
them with those which are better, to assist their murmuriugs and com-
pkiuings.

was now grown more {emitter to me: but while my mind won that filled
with thoughts of revenge, sad a bloody putting tyrenty or thirty of thorn to
the syrord, as I may call it, the horror 1 had at the place, and st the signals
of the hsrburous wretches devouring one another. abetted my malice. Well.
at length I found s place in the side of the hill, where l was, satisfied I
might securely wait till Isaw any of their boats coming; and might then,
even before they would be ready to come on shore, convey myself. unseen,
into some thickets of trees, to one of which there was s hollow large enough
to conceal rne entirely- , and there I might sit and ohserye all their bloody
doings, and take my full aim at their herds, when they were so close toge-
ther as that it would be next to impossible thst I should nus my shot, or
that I could fail wounding three or four of them at the first shot. In this
plane, then, I mired to fix my design; and, accordingly, 1 prepared two
mmkets and my ordinary fowling-pieoe. The two muskets I loaded with s
lanes of slugs each, and four or five wsller bullets. about the size at pistol.
bullets; and the {curling-piece I loaded with near as handful of "earshot, of
the largest size. I also loaded my pistols with about four bullets each; and
in this posture, well provided with ammunition for a second and third
charge, 1 preosred myself for my expedition.

After I had thus laid the scheme of my design, snd,' to my imagination, put
8 in practice, I continually made my hour every morning up tothe top of

try-pcople what had happened, they would come over again by thousands
to revenge the death of their fellows, and I should only bring upon myself
a certain destruction, which, at present,l had no manner of occasion for.
Upon the whole I concluded, that neither in principle nor in policy I ought,
one way or other, to concern myself in this adult: that my business was, by
all poaible means, to conceal myselffrom them, and not to leave the least
signal to them to guess by that there were any living creatures upon the
island--I mean, of human shape. Religion joined in with this prudential rest>>
lution; and Iwas convinced now, many ways, that l was perfectly out of
my duty when l was laying all my bloody schemes for the destruction of im
nocent creatures--I mean, innocent as to me. As to the crimes they were
guilty of towards one another, I had nothing to do with them; they were
national, and I ought to leave them to the justice of God, who is the Gov
vemor of nations, and knows how, by national punishments, to make a just
retribution for national offences, and to bring public judgments, upon thwo
who oll'end in a public manner. by such ways as best please him. This ap~
pear-ed so clear to me now, that nothing was a greater satisfaction to me
than that I had not been sufi'ered to do a thing which I now saw so much
reason to believe would have been no less a sin than that of wilthl murder,-
ifl had committed it; and I gave most humble thanks on my knees to God,
that had thus delivered me from bloodaguiltinesa; beseeching bin: to grant
sue the protection of his providence, that! might not fall into the hands of
the barbarians, or that I might not lay my hands upon them, unless I had a
more clear call from Heaven to do it in defence of my own life.

sight, or to know whether any of them had been on short: there or not. that.
I might not be tempted to renew any of my contrivances against them. or be

only this Idid; I went and removed my boat. which I had on the other side
of the island, and carried it down to the east end of the whole island, where
I ran it into a little cove, which I found under some high rocks, and where I

and a thing like an anchor, but which. indeed, could not be called either an-

removed, that there might not be the least shadow of any discovery, 01' any
appearance of any boat, or of any human habitation. upon the island. Be-

shore alter my apprehensions of them had made me cautious, as well as before.
Indeed, I looked back with some horror upon the thoughts of what my com
dition would have been if i had chopped upon them and been discovered be-
fore that, when, naked and unarmed, except with one gun, and that loaded
often only with small shot. I walked every where, peeping and peering about
the island to see what i could get. What a surprise should I have been in,
if, when I discovered the print of a man's foot, I had, instead of that, seen
fifteen or twenty savages, and found them pursuing inc, and, by the swift.
ness of their running, no possibility of my escaping them! The thoughts of
this sometimes sunk my very soul within me, and distressed my mind
much, that I could not soon recover it, to think what i should have done,
and how [should not only have been unable to resist them, but even shout.
not have had presence of mind enough to do what I might have done;
much less what now, after so much consideration and preparation, I might
be able to do. Indeed, after serious thinking of these things, I would be
very melancholy, and sometimes it would last a great while; but I resolved
it all, at last, into thankfulness to that Providence which had delivered me
from so many women dangers, and had kept from me those mischiefs which
I could have no way been the agent in delivering myself from, because I ind
not the least notion of any such thing depending, or the least supposition at
its being possible. This renewed a contemplation which often had come
to my thoughts in former time, when first I began to see the merciful dis-
positions of Heaven, in the dangers we run through in this life; how won-
derfully we are delivered when we know nothing of it; how, when we arc
in a quandary, as we call it,----a doubt or hesitation, whether to go this way

that way which we should have gone, and even to our imagination ought
to have gone, we should have been ruined and lost. Upon these, and
many like reflections, l afterwards made it 3 certain rule with me, that
whenever I found those secret hints or pressings of mind, to doing or not
doing any thing that presented, or going this way or that. way, I never
fiiiledto obey the secret dictate; though I knew no other reason for it than
that ouch a pressure, or such a hint. hung upon my mind. I could give
many examples of the success of this conduct in the course of my life. but

todlateto bewise; and I cannot but advise all donfidering men, whose
lives are attended with such extraordinary incidents as mine, or even thong
not so extraordinary, not to slight such secret intimations of Providence, let
them come from what invisible intelligence they will. That I shall n0
discuss, and perhaps cannot account for; but 'certai'nly they are a. proofo.
the converse of spirits, and a secret communication between those embodied
and thme unembodied. and such a proof as can never be withstood; of which
I shall have occasion to give some very remarkable instances in the re-
mainder of my solitary residence in this dismal place.

I believe the reader of this will not think if strange if I confess that these
anxieties these constant dangers I lived in, and the concern that was now
upon me, put an end to all invention, and to all the contrivances that I had
laid for my future accommodations and conveniences. I had the care of my
safety more now upon my hands than that of my food. I cared not to drive
a nail, or chop a stick of wood now, for fear the noise I might make should
be heard; much less would I fire a gun, for the same reason: and, above
all, I was intolerably uneasy at making any fire, lest the smoke, which is
visible at a great distance in the day, should betray me. For this reason I
removed that part of my business which required fire, such as burning of
pots and pipes, &c., into my new apartment in the woods; where, after I
had been some time, I found, to my unspeakable consolation, a mere natural
cave in the earth, which went in a vast way, and where, I dare say, no
savage, had he been at the month of it, would be so hardy as to venture in ;
nor, indeed, would any man else, but one who, like me, wanted nothing so
much asa safe retreat.

The mouth of this hollow was at the bottom ofa great rock, where by
mere accident, I would say, ifl did not see abundant reason to ascribe all
such things now to Providence, I was cutting down some thick branches
of trees to make charcoal; and, before I go on, I must observe the moon
of my making this charcoal, which was thus :--I was afraid of makings
smoke about my habitation, as I said betbre; and yet I could not live there
without baking my bread, cooking my meat, &c.; so I contrived to burn
tome wood here, as [had seen done in England, under turf, till it became
(hark, or dry coal; and then putting the fire out, I preserved the coal to
carry home, and perform the other services for which fire was wanting,
without danger of smoke. But this is by-the--by:---While I was cutting
down some wood here, [perceived that behind a very thick branch of low
brush-wood, or underwood, there was a kind of hollow place: I was curious
to leak in it, and, getting with difficulty into the mouth of it, I tbund it was
pretty large; that is tosay, sufficient for me to stand upright in it, and
perhaps another with me: but I must confess to you that I made more. haste
out than I did in, when, looking farther into the'place, and Which was
perfectly dark, [saw two broad :hiniug eyes of some creative, whether
devil or man I knew not, which kled like two stars, the dim light lions

was indeed struck with such a surprise that it put me into a cold sweat;
and, if I had had a hat on my head, I will not answer for it that my hair
might not have lifted it 05'. But still plucking up my spirits as well _asI

stepped forward again, and by the light of the firebrand, holding it up a
little over my head, I saw lying on the ground a most monstrous, frightful,
old he-goat, just making his will, as we say, and gasping for life; and dying,
indeed, of mere old age. I stirred him a little, to see if! could get him out,
and he easayed to get up, but was not able to raise himself; and I thought
with myself he might even lie there; for, if he had frightened me, so he
would certainly fright any of the savages, if any of them should be so hardy
as to come in there while he had any life in him. -

I was now recovered from my surprise, and began to look round me,
when I found the cave was but very small, that is to say, it might be about
twelve feet over, but in 'no manner of shape, neither round nor square, no
hands having ever been emplOyed in making it but those of mere Nature. I
observed also that there was a place at the farther side ofit that went in
further, but was so low that it required me to creep upon my hands and
knees to go into it ,and whither it went I knew not: so, having no candle,
I gave it over for that time, but resolved to come again the next day, pro-
yidsd with candles and a tinder-box, which I had made of the lock of one of
the muskets, with some wild-fire In the pan.

Accordingly, the next day I came provided with six large candles ofiny
own making (forl made very good candles now of goat's tallow, but.wa_a
hard set for candle-wick, using sometimes rags or rope-yarn, and sometimes
the dried rind of a weed like nettles) , and, going into this low place, I was
obliged to creep upon all fours, as I have said, almost ten yards; which, by
the way, I thought was a venture bold enough, considering that I knew not
how farit might go, nor what was beyond it. When I had got through the

strait, I found the roof rose higher up, I believe near twenty feet;,but '

never was such a glorious sight seen in the island, I dare say, as it was, to
look 'round the sides and roof of this vault or cave; the wall reflected a

entrance; which, however, as it was a place of security, and such a retreat
as I wanted, I thought that was a convenience, so that {was really rejoiced
at the discovery, and resolved, without any delay, to bring some of those
things, which i was most anxious about, to this place; particularlgl re~
solved to bring hither my magazine of powder, and all my spare arnis, viz
two {tinting-pieces, for] had three in all, and three muskets, for of them I
had eight in all: sol kept at. my castle only five, which stood ready mounted,
'(ike pieces of cannon, on my outmost fence; and were ready also to take out
upon any expedition. Upon this occasion of removing my ammunition, I
happened to open the barrel of powder which I took up out of the sea, and
which had been wet; and I found that the water had penetrated about three
or four inches into the powder on every side, which, coking and growing
hard, lind preserved the inside like a kernel in the shell; so that I had near
sixty pounds of very good powder in the centre of the cask: this was a very
agreeable discovery to me at that time ; so 1 carried all away thither, never
keeping above two or three pounds of powder with me in my castle, for
fear of a surprise of any kind: [also carried thither all the lead I had let!
for hulletr. f

l fancied myself now like one of the ancient giants, which were said to
live in caves and holes in the run-ks, where none could come at them; for I
persuaded. myself, while I was here, that, it five hundred savages were to
hunt me, they could never find me out ; or, it' they dill, they would not. ran.
into to attack me here. The old gout, whom I found expiring, died in the
mouth of the cave the next day after l made this discovery: and I found it
much easier to dig a great hole there, and throw him in and cover him with
earth, than to drag him out; so I interred him there, to prevent alliance to
my nose.

I was now in the twenty-third year of my residence in this island; and
was so naturalized to the place, and the manner of living, that, could I have
but enjoyed the certainty that no savages would come to the pluee to disturb
me, I could have been content to have capitnlated for spending the rest of
my time there, even to the last moment, till I had laid me down and died,
like the old goat in the care. I had also arrived to some little diversions and
amusements, which made the time pass a great deal more pleasantly with me
than it did before : as, first, I had taught my Poll, asl noted before, to speak;
and he did it so familiarly, and talked so articulatcly and plain, that it was
very pleasant to me; for I believe no bird ever spoke pininer; and he lived
with me no lea than six-and-twenty years: how long he might have lived
afterwards I know not, though I know they have a notion in the Brazil: that
they live a hundred years. My dog was a very pleasant and loving com-
panion to me for no loss than sixteen years of my time, and then died of

7mere old age. As for my cats, they multiplied, a: I have observed, to that

degree, that l was obliged to uhoot several of them at first, to keep them
from devouring me and all I had; but, at length, when the two old one: I

' .i

or nontnson cnoson. '1 l7

brought with me were gone, and alter some time continually driving them
from me, and letting them have no provision with me, they all ran wild into
the woods, except two or three favourites, which I kept tame, and whose
young, when they had any, I always drowned; and these were part of my
family. Besides these, I always kept two or three household kids abont me,
whom I taught to feed out of my hand; and I had two more parrots, which
talked pretty well, and would all coll Robin Crusoe, but none like my that;
nor, indeed, did I take the pains with any of them that I had done with him.
i had also several tame nea~fowls, whose name: I knew not, that! caught
upon the shore, and out their wings; and the little stakes which I had
planted before my castle-wall being now grown up to a good thick grove,
these fonds all lived among these low trees, and bred there, which was very
agreeable to me; so that, as I said above, I began to be very well contented
with the life 2 led, if i could have been secured from the dread of the savages.
But it was otherwise directed; and it may not be mine for all people who
ehull meet with my story to make this just observation from it, viz, how
fiequently, in the course of our lives, the evil which in itself we seek most to
shun, and which, when we are fallen into, is the most dreadful to us, is alien-
times the very means or door of our deliverance, by which alone we can be
raised again from the affliction we are fallen into. I could give many ex-
amples of this in the course of my unacemmtnblc life; but in nothing was it
more particularly remarkable than in the circumstances of my last years 0!
solitary residence in this island.

It was now the'month of December, as i said above, in my twenty~third
3cm; and this, being the southern solstile (for winter I cannot call it), was
the particular time of m) harvest, and ruguircd my being pretty much abroad
in the fie! ds; "lieu, going out rather early in the morning, even before it
"as thorough do) ~liglIt, I was surprised with seeing a light of some fire upon
the show, at a distance from me of about two miles, towards the end of the
island, where I had observed some savages had been, as before, and not on
the other side; but. to my great affliction, it was on my side of the island.

1 was indeed terribly surprised at the sight, and stopped short within my
grove, not daring to go out. lost I might be surprised; and yet I had no more
peace within, from the apprehensions I had, that if these savages, in rambling
over the island, should find mv corn standing or cut, or any of my works and
improvements, they would immediately conclude that there were people in
the place, and would then never give over till they had found me out. In
this extremity I went back directly to my castle, pulled up the ladder alter
me, and made all things without look as wild and natural as I could.

Then I prepared myself within, putting myself in a posture of defence: I
'onded all my cannon, as I called them, that is to say, my mueketn, which
were mounted upon my new fortification, and all my pistols, and resolved to
deleud myself to the instgnsp; not forgetting seriously to commend and!
to the divine protection, and earnestly to pray to God to deliver the or: &
the hands of the barbarians. I continued In this posture about two home.

to send out. Afier sitting a while longer, and reusing what I should do it.
this, 1 was not able to bear tilting in ignorance any longer; 00, setting up
my ladder to the side of the hill. where there was a flat place, as l oboerved
before, and then pulling the ladder up after me, i set it up again, and mounted
to the top of the hill; and, pulling out my perspective glass, which I had
taken on purpose, I laid me down flat on my belly on the ground, and began
to look for the place. I presently found there were no less than nine naked
savages, sitting round a small fire they bade made, not to warm them.
[or they had no need of that, the weather being extremely hot; bug-as I
supposed, to dress some of their barbarous diet of human flesh, which they
had brought with them; whether alive or dead I could not tell.

They had two canoes with them, which they had hauled up upon the
abore ; and, as it was thou tide of ebb, they seemed to me to wait {or the

titsion this sight out me into, especially seeing them come on my side of the

servation,l went abroad about my harvest-work with the more composure.

I saw them all take boat, and row (orpaddle, as we call it) away. [should
have observed, that, for an hour or more before they went od', they went
adancing; and i could easily discern their posture: and gestures by my
glass. 1 could not perceive, by my nicest observation, but that they were
stark mind, and had not the least covering upon them; but whether they
were men or women I could not distinguish.

As soon as I saw them shipped and gone, I took two guns upon my shoul.
den, and two pistols in my girdle, and my great sword by my side, without
a scabbard, and, with all the speed I was able to make, went away to the hill
where I had discovered the first appearance of all; and, as soon as I got
thither, which was not in less than two hours (for 1 could not go apace,
being so loader: with arms as l was), I perceived there had been three canoes
more of savages at that place; and. looking out farther, I saw they were all
at sea together, making over for the main. This was a dreadful sight to
me, especially as, going down to the share, I could see the marks of horror.
which the dismal work they had been about had left behind it, via, the
blood, the bones, and part of the flesh of human bodies, eaten and devoured
I by those wretches with merriment and sport. I was so filled with indigna-
tion at the sight, that I now began to premeditate the destruction of the next
that I saw there, let them be whom or how many soever. It seemed evident
to me that the visits which they made thus to this island were not very ire.
quent, for it was above fifteen months before any more of them came on'
shore there again; that is to say, i neither saw them, nor any footsteps or
signals of them, in all that time; for, as to the rainy seasons. then they are

combrtably, by reason of the constant apprehension: of their coming upon
me by ourprise: from whence I observe, that the expectation ol'evil is more
bitter than the sufi'cring. especially if there is no room to shake 03' that ex-
pectation or thooe apprehensions.

\ During all this time I was in the murdering humour, and took up most of
my hours, which should have been better employed, in contriviug how to
circumvent and fall upon them the very next time Ishonld see them; espe--
cially it'they should be divided, as they were the last time, into two parties:

were in being mameaters, and perhaps much more so. lspcnt my days now
in great perplexity and anxiety of mind, expecting that I should, one day or
other, flail into the hands of these merciless creatures; and, if I did at any
time venture abroad, it was not without looking round me with the greatest
care and caution imaginable. And now 1 found, to my great comfort, how
happy it was that I provided for a tame flock or herd of goals; for 1 Ilth
not, upon any account, fire my gun, especially near that side of the island
where they usually came, lest I should alarm the savages; and, if they had
fled from me now, I was sure to have them come again, with perhaps two or
three hundred canoes with them, in gt few days, and then I knew what to
expect. However, I wore out a year and three months more before I ever
saw any more of the savages, and then I found them again, as I shall soon
observe. It is true they might have been there once or twice; but either
they made no stay, or, at least, I did not see them: but, in the mouth of
May, as near as I could calculate, and in my four-aud--twentictb year, I had
a very strange encounter with them; of which in its place.

The perturbation of my mind, during this fifteen or sixteen mouths' inter-
val, was very great; I'slept unquiet, dreamed always frightful dreams, and
otlen started out of my sleep in the night: in the day great troubles over-
whelmed my mind; and in the night I dreamed otten of killing the savages
and of the reasons why I might justify the doing of it. But, to were all this
for a while.---1t was in the middle of May, on the sixteenth day, I think, as
well as my poor wooden calendar would reckon, for I marked all upon the
post still; I say, it was on the sixteenth of May that it blew a. very great
storm of wind all day, with a great deal of lightning and thunder; and a
very foul night it was after it. I knew not what was the particular occasion
of it, but, as l was reading in the Bible, and taken up w'th very serious
thought: about my present condition, I was surprised with the noise of a gun,
as I thought, fired at sea. This was, to be sure, a surprise quite of adid'erent
nature from any I had met with before; for the notions this put into my
thoughts were quite of another kind. I started up in thsgreatest haste ima-
ginable, and. in a trice, clapped my ladder to the middle place of the rock.
and pulled it alter me; and, mounting it the second time, got to the top of
the hill the very moment that a flash of tire bid we listen for a' second gun. .
winch accordingly, in about half a minute, I heard; and, by the sound.
knew that it was from that part of the sea where I was driven down the
current in my boat. I immediately considered that this must be some six>>
Ill distress, and that they had some eOmrade, or some other ship m company
and fired these guns for signals of distress, and to obtain help. I had the
presence of mind, at that minute, to think, that, though I could not help
them, it might be they might help me: sol brought together all the dry
wood I could get at hand, aml, making a good handsome pile, I set it on fire
upon the hill. The wood was dry, and blazed freely; and, though the wind
blew very hard, yet it burnt fairly out; so that, I was certain, if there was
any such thing as a ship, they must needs see it; and, no doubt, they did;
for as soon as ever my fire blazed up I heard another gun, and after that
several others, all from the same quarter. 1 plied my fire all night long, till
day-break; and when it was broad day, and the air cleared up, I saw some-
thing :It a great distance at sea, full cast of the island, whether a sail or a
hull I could not distinguish, no, not with my glass, the distance was so great,
and the weather still something hazy also; at least, it was so out at sea.

I looked frequently at it all that day, and soon perceived that it did not
move; so I presently concluded that it was a ship at anchor; and being
eager, you may be sure, to be satisfied, I took my gun in my hand, and ran
towards the south side of the island, to the rocks where I had formerly been
carried away with the current; and, getting up there, the weather by this
time being perfectly clear, I could plainly see, to my great sorrow, the wreck
of a ship, cast away in the night upon those concealed rocks which I found
when I was out in my boat -, and which rocks, as they checked the violence
of the stream, and made a kind of counter-stream, or eddy, were the occasion
of my recovering from the mast desperate hopelem condition that ever I had
been in all my life. Thus, what is one man's safety is another man's destruc-
tion ; for it seems these men, " hoever they were, being' out of their know-
ledge, and the rocks being wholly under water, had been driven upon them
in the night, the wind blowing hard at Ii. -.\. E. lad they seen the island,
as I must necessarily suppose they did not, they must, as I thought, have en-
deavoured to have saved themselves on shore by the help of their boat ; but
their firing otf guns for help, especially w hen they saw, as I imagined, my
fire, tilled me with many thonglusz--First, I imagined that, upon seeing my
light, they might have put themselves into their boat, and endeavoured
to make the shore; but that the sea going very high, they might have been
cast away : olhcr times I imagined that they might have lost their boat beforev
as might be the ease many ways; as, particularly, by the breaking of the
sea upon their ship, which many times obliges men to stave, or take in pieces,
their boat, and sometimes to throw it overboard with their owa hands: other
times I imagined they had some other ship or ships in company, who, upon
the signals of distress they had made, had taken them up and carried them
off: other times I fancied they were all gone off to sea in their boat, and, I
being hurried away by the current that I had been formerly in, were carried
' out into the great ocean, where there was nothing but misery and perisln'ug;
and that, perhaps, they might by this time think of starving, and of being is
a condition to eat one another.

As all these were but conjectures at best, so, in the condition I was in, I
could do no more than look on upon the misery of the poor men, and pity
them; which had still this good effect on my side, that it gave me more and
more cause to give thanks to God, who had so happily and comfortably pro-
vided for me in my desolate condition; and that, of two ships' companies
who were now cast away upon this part of the world, not one life showd be
spared but mine. I learned here again to observe, that it is very rare that
the providence of God casts us into any condition}?! life so low, or any misery
so great, but we may see something or other to be thankful for, and may see
others in worse circumstances than our own. Such certainly was the case
of these men, of whom I could not so much as see room to suppose any of
them were saved. Nothing could make it rational somuch as to wish or ex.
pect that they did not all perish there, except the possibility only of their
being taken up by another ship in company; and this was but mere possi-
bility indeed, for I saw not the least sign or appearance of any such thing.
I cannot explain, by any possible energy of words, what a strange longing
or hankering of desires I felt in my soul upon this sight, breaking out some.
times thus--' 0 that there had been but one or two, nay, or but one soul,'
saved out of this ship, to have escaped to me, that I might but have had one
companion, one fellow-creature, to have spoken to me, and to have convened
with !' In all the time of my solitary life, I never felt so earnest, so strong a.
desire alter the society of my fellow-creatures, or so deep a regret at the
want of it.

There are some secret moving springs in the afl'ections, which, when they
are set aogoing by some object in view, or, though not in view, yet rendered
present to the mind by the power of imagination, that motion carries out the
soul, by its impetnosity, to such violent, eager embracing: of the object, that
the absence of it is insupportabW'Such were these earnest wishings that
but one man had been saved. I believe I repeated the words, ' 0 that it
had been but one !' a thousand times; and my desires were so moved by it,
that when I spoke the words my hands would clinch together, and my fingers
would press the palms of my hands, so that, ifI had had any soft thing in my
hand, it would have crushed it involuntarily; and the teeth in my head would
strike together, and set against one another so strong, that for some time I
could not part them again. Let the naturalists explain these things, and the

, reason and manner of them: all I can say to them is, to describe the fact,

which was even surprising to me when l found-it, though I knew not from

whence itproceeded: it was doubtless the efl'ect of ardent wishes, and of
strong ideas formed in my mind, realizing the comfort which the conversation
of one of any fellow-Christians would have been to me.--But it was not to
be; either their fate or mine, or both, forbade it: for, till the last year of my
being on this bland, I never knew whether any were saved out of that ship

or no; and had only the afliction, some days alter, to see the corpse of 3

drowned boy come on shore at the end of the island which was next the
shipwreck. He had no clothes on but a seaman's waistcoat, a pair of open-
kneed linen drawers, and a blue linen shirt; but nothing to direct melo
much as to guess what nation he was of: he had nothing in his pockets but
two pieces of eight and a tobacco-pipe ;-the last was to me of ten times
more value than the first.

It was now calm, and I had a great mind to venture out in-my boat to this
wreck, not doubting but I might find something on board that might be
useful to me : but that did not altogether press me so much as the possibility
that there might be yet some living creature on board, whose life I might not
only save, but might, by saving that life, comfort my own to the last degree;
and this thought clung so to my heart, that I could not be quiet night or day,
but I must venture out in my boat on board this wreck; and, committing
the rest to God's providence, I thought the impression was so strong upon
my mind that it could not be resisted, that it must come from some invisible
direction, and that I should be wanting to myself if I did not go.

Under the power of this impression, I hastened back to my castle, prepared
every thing for my voyage, took a quantity of bread, a great pot of fresh
water, a compass to steer by, a bottle of rum (for I had still a great deal of
that left), and a basket of raisins: and thus, loading myself with every thing
necessary, I went down to my boat, got the water out of her, put her afloat,
loaded all my cargo in her, and then went home again for more. My second
cargo was a great bag of rice, the umbrella to set up over my head for a
shade, another large pot of fresh water, and about two dozen of my small
loaves, or barley-cakes, more than before, with a bottle of goats' milk and a
cheese: all which, with great labour and sweat, I carried to my boat; and.
praying to God to direct my voyage, I put out; and rowing, or paddling,
the canoe along the shore, came at last to the utmost point of the island on
the north-east side. And now I was to launch out into the ocean, and either
to venture or not to venture. I looked on the rapid currents which ran con-
stantly on both sides of the island at a distance, and which were very terrible
to me, from the remembrance of the hazard I had been in before, and my
heart began to fail me; for I foresaw that, if I was driven into either of those
currents, I should be carried a great way out to sea, and perhaps out of my
reach or sight of the island again; and that then, as my boat was but small,
If any little gale of wind should rise, I should be inevitably lost.

These thoughts so oppressed my mind, that I began to give over my en-
terprise; and, having hauled my boat into a little creek on the shore, I
stepped out, and sat me down upon a rising bit of ground, very pensive and
anxious, between fear and desire, about my voyage; when, as I was musing,
I could perceive that the tide was turned, and the flood come on; upon
which my going was impracticable for so many hours. Upon this, presently
it occurred to me that I should go up to the highest piece of ground I could
find, and observe, if I could, how the sets of the tide, or currents, lay when
the flood came in, that I might judge whether, if I was driven one way out, I
might not expect to be driven another way home, with the same rapidness d
the currents. This'thought was no sooner in my head than I cast my eye upon
a little hill, which sufficiently overlooked the sea both ways, and from whence
I had a clear view of the currents, or sets of the tide, and which way I was
to guide myself in my return. Here I found, that, as the current of the ebb
set out close by the south point of the island, so the current of the flood set
in close by the shore of the north side; and that I had nothing to do but to
keep to the north side of the island in my return, and I should do well enough.
. Encouraged with this observation, I resolved, the next morning, to set
out with the first of the tide; and reposing myself for the night in my canoe,
under the great watch-coat I mentioned, I launched out. I first made a
little out to sea, full north, till I began to feel the benefit of the current,
which set eastward, and which carried me at a great rate; and yet did not
so hurry me as the current on the south side had done before, so as to take
from me all government of the boat; but, having a strong steerage with my
paddle, I went at a great rate directly for the wreck, and in less than two
hours I came up to it. It was a dismal sight to look at: the ship, which, by
its building, was Spanish, stuck fast, jammed in between two rocks; all the
stern and quarter of her were beaten to pieces with the sea; and as her
forecastle, which stuck in the rocks, had run on with great violence, her
mainmast and foremnst were brought by the board, that is to say, broken
short 06'; but her bowsprit was sound, and the head and bow appeared firm.
When I came close to her, a dog appeared upon her, who, seeing me coming,
yelped and cried, and, as soon as I called him, jumped into the sea to come
to me. I took him into the boat, but found him almost dead with hunger
and thirst. I gave him a cake of my bread, and he devoured it like a ra-
venous wolf that had been starving a fortnight in the snow : I then gave the
poor creature some fresh water, with which, if I would have let him, he
would have burst himself. Alter this I went on board; but the first sight I
met with was two men drowned in the cook-room, or forecastle of the ship,
with their arms fast about one another. I concluded, as is indeed probable,
that when the ship struck, it being in a storm, the sea broke so high, and so
continually- over her, that the men were not able to bear it, and was
strangled with the constant rushing in of the water, as much as if they had
been under water. Besides the dog, there was nothing lefi in the ship that
had life; nor any goods, that I could see, but what were spoiled by the
water. There were some casks of liquor, whether wine or brandy I knew
not, which lay lower in the hold, and which, the water being ebbed out, I
could see; but they were too big to meddle with. I saw several chests,
which I believed belonged to some of the seamen; and I got two of them
into the boat, without examining what was in them. Had the stern of the
ship been fixed, and the fore part broken off, Iam persuaded I might have
made a good voyage; for, by what I found in these two chests, I had room
to suppose the ship had a great deal of wealth on board; and, if I may guess
from the course she steered, she must have been bound from Buenos Ayrves,
or the Rio de la Plata, in the south part of America, beyond the Brazils, to
the Havanna, in the Gulf of Mealco, and so perhaps to Spain. She had, no-Y=.'".'{'

' I could not satiety myself in my station, but was continually poring upon the
means and possibility of my escape from this place: and that I may, with
the greater pleasure to the reader, bring on the remaining part of my story,
it may not he improper to give some account of my first conceptions on the
subject of this foolish scheme for my escape, and how, and upon what form.
dation, I acted.

I am now to be supposed retired into my castle, alter my late voyage to
the wreck, my thigate laid up and secured under water as usual, and my
condition restored to what it was before: I had more wealth, indeed, than
I had before, but was not at all the richer; for I had no more use for it than
the Indians of Porn had before the Spaniards come there.

It was one of the nights in the rainy season in March, the font-and-twen- '
tieth year ofrny first setting foot in this island ofsolitndgl was lying in my
bed, or hammock, awake; very well in health, had no pain, no distemper,
no uneasiness of body, nor any uneasiness of mind, more than ordinary, but
could by means close my eyes, that is, so as to sleep; no, not a wink all
night long, otherwise than as follows :---It is impossible to set down the in-
numerable crowd ofthoughts that whirled through that great thoroughfare o!
the brain, the memory, in this night's time : 1 ran over the whole history of
my life in miniature, or by abridgment, as I may call it, to my coming to this
island, and also of that part of my life since I came to this island. In my
neflectious upon the state of my case since I came on shore on this island, I
teas comparing the happy posture of my afl'aira in the first years of myhahi-
tation here, compared to the life of anxiety, fear, and care, which I had
lived in, ever since I had seen the print ofa foot in the sand; not that I did
not believe the savages had frequented the island even all the while, and
might have been several hundred: of them at times on shore there ,, hot I
had never known it, and was incapable of any apprehensions about it; my
satisfaction was perfect, though my danger was the some, and I was as
happy in not knowing my danger as if I had never really been exposed to
it. This furnished my thoughts with many very profitable reflections, and
particularly this one: How infinitely good that Providence is, which baa
provided, in its government of mankind, such narrow bounds to his sight
and knowledge of things; and, though he walks in the midst of so many
thousand dangers; the sight ofwhieh, it discovered to him, would distract
his mind and sink his spirits. he is kept serene and calm, by having the
events of things bid from his eyes, and knowing nothing of the dangers
which surround him.

Aaer these thoughts had for some time entertained me, I came to reflect
seriously upon the real danger I had been in for so many years in this very.
island, and how I had walked about in the greatest security, and with all
possible tranquillity, even when, perhaps, nothing but the brow of a hill, a
great tree, or the casual approach of night, had been between me and the.
worst kind of destruction, viz, that of falling intothe hands of cannibals and
savages, who would have seized on me with the same view as I would on a
goat or a turtle, and have thought it no more a crime to kill and devour me,t on 3031141802: censors." 1%

than I did an. pigeon or curlew. I should unjustly slander mysell; if I should
say I was 'not sincerely thankful to my great Preserver, to whose singular
protection I acknowledged, with great humility, all these nnlinown'deliver'
sores were due, and without which I most inevitably here fallen into then
merciless hands.

When these thoughts were over, my head was for some time taken up in
considering the nature of time wretched creatures (I mean the ravages): and
how it came to pass in the world that the wise Governor of all things shodld
give up any of his creatures to snob inhumanity, nay, to something so much
below even brutality itself, as to devonr its own kind: but, as this ended in
some (at that time) fruitless speculations. it occurred to me to inquire, what
part of the world these wretches lived in i how far all the eoost was from
whence they came 1' what they ventured over so far from home for? what
kind ofhonts they had? and why I might not order myself and my business
so, that i might. be as able to go oier thither as they were to come to met

I never so much as troubled myself to consider what I should do
with myself when I went thither; what would become of me if I fell into
the ha'nds of the savages; or how I should escape from them if they at-
tached me , no, nor so much' as how it was possible for me on roach the
coast, and not be attacked by some or other of them, without any possibility
of delivering myself; and, if 1 should not fall into their hands, what I should
do for provision, or whither I should head my course: none of these thoughts;
I say, so much as name in my way; but my mind was wholly bent upon
the notion of my passing over in my boat to the main land. I looked upon
my present condition as the most miserable that could pouibly be 3 that l

' was not ehle to throw myself into any thing, but death. that could he
called worse; and, it I reached the shore of the main, I might, perhaps.
meet with relief; or I might coast along, as I did on the African shore, till I
came to some inhabited country, and where I might find some relief; and,
after all, perhaps I might fall in with some Christian ship that might take
me in; and, if the worst came to the worst, I could but die, which would
put an end to all these miseries at once. Pray note, all this was the fruit 0.
adisturhed mind, an impatient temper, made desperate. as it were, by the

I long continuance of my troubles, and the disappointments I had met in the
wreck I had beenon board of, and where I had been so near obtaining what
I so earnestly longed for, viz, somebody to speak to, and to learn some
knowledge from them of the place where I was, and of the probable means
of my deliverance. I was agitated wholly by than thoughts; all my atlas
of mind, in my resignation to Providence, and waiting the some of the dis-
positions of Heaven, seemed to be suspended, and I had, as it were, no
power to turn my thoughts to any thing but to the project of s voyage to
the min; which came upon me with such force, and such an impetnosity
ofdefirgthatitwasnottoberesisted.

When this had agitated my thoughts for two hours or more, with 'such
violence that itset my very blood into a ferment, and my pulse heat as it!'

cave, and he became my servant: and that, no soon as I had got thinning!

I need not repeat the arguments which occurred to me against tho, they
being the some mentioned before: but, though I had other reasons to ofl'er

they eruzld;~ that it was aelitpreaervation, in the highest degree to deliver
myself from this death ofa life, and was acting in my own definee a much

things argued for it, yet the thought: of ~illiedding human blood for any do-
linrance were very terrible to me, and each u I could by no means recon--
cile myeelfto for a great while. However, at last, after many newt disputes
with myself. and after great perplexities about it (for all the-eminent;
one my and another, struggled in my head a long time). the eager preveib
in; desire of deliverance at length mastered all the rest; and I resolved. if ,
plausible; to get ones? those savages into my hands, cost what it would. My
next thing was to contrive how to do it; and this, indeed. was very mm
to resolve on: but, as I could pitch upon no probable menus for it,>> I re-
solred. to' put myself upon the watch, to see them when they came on shore;
and leave the rest to the event; taking such measures as the opportunity
should present, let what would be.

With these resolutions in my thoughts, I set mysell' upon the scout as
often as pouible, and, indeed, so often, that I was heartily tired ofit; for. it
was above a year and a half that I waited; and for great part'of that time '
went out to the west end, and. to the south~west comer, of the island,
almost every day, to look farcanoes, hot none appeired. This was very dis:
couraging, and began to trouble me much; though Instinct saySShat it did in
this case (as it had done some time before) wear off. the edge of my desire
to the thing: baptize longer it seemed to be delayed, the more eager I was
forit: in u word,Iwas not at that so careful to shuuthe sight ofthae
savages, and avoid being seen by them, as I was now eager to beopou them.
Besides, I fancied myself able to manage one, my, two or three savages, if
I had them, so as to make them entirely slaves to me, to do whatever 'I'
should direct'them, audio prevent their being ahle at any time to do me
any hurt; It was a great while that I pleased myself with this afi'air; but
nothing still presented ;' all my fancies and schemes came to nothing, for
no savages come near me for a great while.

About a year and a half 'afier I entertained these notions (and by long
musing had, as it were, resolved them all into nothing, for want ot' an one>>. '
sion to put them into execution), I was sol-prised, one morning early, with
ageing no' less than'fire canoes all on shore together 'on my side the island.
and the people who belonged to them all landed, and out ofmy eight. The
number ofthem broke all my. measures; for, seeing so may, and knowing
that they always came four or six, or sometimes more, in a boat, I could not
tell what to think of it, or how to take my measures, to' attach twcity or
thirty men singlehanded; so lay still' in my eastleperplexed and discomlhrted:
however, I put- myself into all the same postures for an attack thatI had
formerly provided, and wat just ready for action, if an thing had prae'nted. '
Haring waited s good while, listening to hear it they made my noise, at
length. being very impatient, I set my guns at the thot of my ladder, and
clambered up to the top of thehill, by my two stages, as usual; standing
so, however, that my head did not appear above the hill, so that they. mild
not perceive me by any means. Here I observed, by the help of my pet-
apeetire glass, that they were no less than thirty no number; thatthe'y had

While I was thus loelzing on them, I perceived, by my perspectire, two

moment, this poor wretch seeing himself a little at liberty, and unbound,
Nature inspired him with hopes of life, and he started away from them, and
ran with incredible willow along the sands, directly towards me; I mean
towards that part of the coast where my habitation was. I was dreadfully
frightened,l must acknowledge, when I perceived him run my way, and
especially when, as I drought, [saw him pursued by the whole body : and
now Iexpected that part of my dream was coming to pass, and that he
would certainly take shelter in my grove: but I could not depend, by any
means, upon my dream for the rest of it, viz, that the other savages would
not pursue him thither, and find him there, However, I kept my station,
and my spirits begun to recover when! found that there were not above
three men that followed him; and still more was I encouraged when I
found that he outstripped them exceedingly in running, and gained ground
of them; so that, if he could but hold it for half an hour, I saw easily he
would fairly get away from them all.

There was between them and my castle the creek, which I mentioned
often in the first part of my story, where I landed my cargoes out of the
ship; and this 1 saw plainly he must necessarily swim over, or the poor
wretch would be taken there: but, when the savage escaping came thither,
he made nothing of it, though the tide was then up; but, plunging in. swam
through in about thirty strokes, or thereabouts, landed, and ran on with
exceeding strength and swiftues. When the three persons came to the
creek, "bond that two of them could swim, but the third could not, and
that, standing on the other side, he looked at the others, but went no farther,
and soon after went softly back again; which, as it happened, was very
well for him in the end. I observed that the two who swam were yet
more than twice as long swimming over the creek as the fellow was that
fled from them. It come now very warmly upon my thoughts, and indeed
irresistibly, that now was the time to get me uservant, and perhaps a.
companion or assistant, and that I was called plainly by Providence to save
this poor creature's life. I immediately ran down the ladders with all poo
:ible expedition; fetched my two guns, for they were both at the foot of the
ladders, as 1 observed above; and getting up again, with the same haste, to
the top of the hill, I crossed toward the sea, and having a very short cut,
and all down hill, placed myself in the way between the pnrsners and the
pursued, holloiug aloud to him that fled, who, looking back, was at first,
perhaps, as much frightened at me as at them; but I beckoned with my
hand to him to come back ; and, in the mean time, I slowly advanced to<<
wards the two that followed; then rushing at once upon the foremost, I
knocked him down with the stock of my piece. I was loth to fire, because
I would not have the rest hear; though, at that distance, it would not have
been easily heard, and, being out of sight of the smoke too, they would not
have easily known what to make of it. Having knocked this fellow down;
the other who pursued him stopped, as if he had been frightened, and]
advanced space towards him; but, as! came nearer, I perceived presently
he had a bow and arrow, and was fitting it to shoot at me 5' so 1 was then
necessitated to shoot at him first, which I did. and killed him at the first
shot. The poor savage who fled, but had stopped, though he saw both his
enemies fallen and killed, as he thought, yet was so frightened with the fire
and noise" if my piece, that he stood stock-etiil, and neither come forwerd
nor went backward, though he seemed rather inclined still to fly than to
come on. I halloed again to him, and made signs to come forward, which
he easily understood, and camea little way; then stopped again; and then
a little farther, and stopped again; and i could then perceive that he stood
trembling, as if he had been taken prisoner, and had just been to be killed.
as his two enemies were. I beckoned to him again to come to me, and gave
him all the signs of encouragement that i could think of; and he came
nearer and nearer, kneeling down every ten or twelve steps, in token of ac-
knowledgment for saving his life. I smiled at him, and looked pleasantly,
.nd beckoned to him to come still nearer: at length he came close to me 3
and then he kneeled down again, kissed the ground, and laid his head upon
the ground, unthinking me by the foot, set my foot upon his head; this, it
scores, was in token of swearing to be my slave for ever. I took him up,
and made much of him, and encouraged him all I could. But there was
more work to do yet; for l perceived the savage whom I knocked down wen
not killed, but stunned with the blow, and began to come to himself; so I
pointed to him, and showed him the savage. that he was not dead: upon
this he spoke some words to me, and, though I could not understand them '
yet i thought they were pleasant to hear; for they were the first sound of
a man'svoiee that I had heard, my own excepted, for above twenty~five
years. Bot there was, no time forsnch reflections now; the savage who was
knocked down recovered himself so far as to sit up upon the ground, and
l perceived that my savage began to be afraid; but, when I saw that, I pre-
sented my other piece at the man, as if [would shoot him: upon this my
savage, for so I call him now, made a motion to me to lend him my sword.-
which hung naked in a belt by my side,which 1 did. He no sooner had it but
he runs to his enemy, and at one blow cut 03' his head so cleverly, no elects>>
tioner in Germany could have done it sooner or better ; which I thought; Very
strange for one who, I had reason to believe, never saw a sword in his life
before,except their own wooden swords: however, it secure, as! learned aller-
wards, they make the wooden swords so sharp, so heavy, and the wood is to
hard, that they will cut 03' heads even with them, aye and arms, and that at
one blow too. When he had done this, he comes laughing to me, in sign
oftrinmph, and brought me the sword again, and with abundance of gestures.
which I did not understand, laid it down, With the head of the mass that
he had killed, inst before me. But that which astonished him most was to
know how I killed the other lndian so far off: so, pointing to him, he made

he was quite dead. He took up his bow and arrows, and came back; so"!
fumed to go away, and beckoned him to follow me, making signs to him
that more might come alter them. Upon this he made signs to me that he
should bury them with sand, that they might not be seen by the rest if they
followed; and so I made signs to him again to do so. Hefell to work; and>>
in an instant, he had scraped a hole in the sand with his hands, big enough
to bury the first in, and then dragged him into it, and covered him; out!
did so by the other also: I believe he had buried them both in a quarter of
an hour. Then calling him away, I carried him, not to my castle, but quite
away to my cave, on the farther part of the island: so Idid not let my
dream come to pass in that part, viz, that he came into my grove for shelter.
Here I gave him bread and a bunch of raisins to eat, and a draught of
water, which I found he was indeed in great distress for by his running
and, having refreshed him, I made a'gns for him to go and lie down to sleep
showing him a place where I had laid some rice-straw, and a blanket upon it.
which I used to sleep upon myselfsometimes; so the poor creature lay down,
and went to sleep.

- He was acomely handsome fellow, perfectly well made, with straight
strong limbs, not too large, tall. and well shaped; and, as I reckon, shoot
twenty-six years of age. He had a very good countenance, not a fierce and
surly aspect, but seemed to have something very manly in his face; and yet
he had all the sweetness and softness ot' an European in his countenance too,
especially when he smiled. , His hair was long- and black, not curled like
wool; his forehead very high and large; and a great vivacity and sparkling
sharpness in his eyes. The colour of his skin was not quite black, but'very
tawny; and yet not an ugly, yellow, nauseous tawny?" the Braa'lians and
Virginians, and other natives of America are, but of a bright kind ofa dun
olive-colour, that had in it something very agreeable, though not very easy
to describe. His face was round and plump; his nose small, not flat like
the negroes: a very good mouth, thin lips, and his fine teeth well set, and
as white as ivory.

After he had slumbered. rather than slept, about half an hour, he'awoke
again, and <<came out of the,enve to me, for I had been milking .my goats,
which I had in the enclosure just by: when he espied me, he came running
to me, laying himself down again upon the ground, with all the possible
signs of an humble thankful disposition, making- s great many antic gestures
to shew it. At last, he lays his head flat upon the ground, close to my foot,
and sets my other foot upon his head, as he had done before; and alter this
made all the signs tome of subjection, servitude, and submission, imaginable,
to let me know how he would serve me so long as he lived. I understood
him in many things, and let him know I was very well pleased with hint.
- In a little time! began to spool; to him, and teach him to speak to me , and,
first, I let him know his name should be FRIDAY, which was the day I
saved his life: I called him so for the memory of the time. I likewise taught
him to soy Master; and then let him know that was to be anymore: I
likewise taught him to say Yes and No. and to know the meaning of them.
I gave. him some milk in so earthen pot, and let him see me drink it before
him. and sop my bread in it; and gave him a cake of bread to dqtlre like>>
which he quickly complied with, and made signs that it- was very good for
him. I kept there with him all that night; butas soon as it was day l
beckoned tohim to come with me. and let him know Iwould give him
some clothes; at whichhe seemed very glad, for he was stark asked. A:
we went by the place where he had buried the two men," he pointed agreed}
to the spot, and shewed me the marks that he. had made to find them
again, making signs to me that we should dig them up again, and eat them.
At this I appeared very angry, expressed my abhorrenoe of it, made as ill
would vomit at the thoughts ofit, and beckoned with my hand to him to
eome away , which he did immediately. with great snbmiaion. I then led
him up to the top of the hill, to see if his enemies were gone; and, pulling
out my glass, I looked, and saw plainly the place where they had been, but
no appearance of them or their canoes, so that it was plain they were gone,
and had left their two comrades behind them, without anysetu-ch after them

But 1 was not content with this discovery , but having now more courage.
and consequently more curiosity, I took my man Friday with me, giving
him the sword' in his hand, with the bow and arrows at his back, which 1
found he could use fiery dexterously, making him carry one goo foame, and
I two for myself; and away we marched to the place where these-creatures
had been; (or! had a mind now to get some {tiller intelligence of theme-When
I'cameto the place. my very blood ran chill in my veins, and my hear-taunt
within me, at the horror of the spectacle; indeed it was a dreadful sight,
at least it was so to me, though Friday made nothing of it. The place was
covered with human bones, the ground dyed with their blood, and great
pieces of flesh left here and there, half-eaten, mangled, and scorched; and,
in short, all the tokens of the triumphant feast they had been making there,
after aviotory over their enemies>> I saw three sculls, fire heads; and the
bones of three or {our legs and feet, and abundance of other parts of the
bodies; and Friday, by his signs, made me understand that they brought
over four prisoners to feast upon; that three of them were eaten up, and
that he, pointing to himself; was the fourth; that there had been a great
' battle between them and their next king, whose subjects, it seems, he had
been one of, and that they had taken a great number of prisoners; all
which were carried to several places by those who had taken them' m the
fight, in order to {east upon them, as was done here by these wretches upon
those they brought hither.

I caused Friday to gather all the senile, bones, flesh, and whatever re-
mained, and lay them together m a beep, and make a great fire upon it,
and burn them all to ashes. I found Friday had still a hankeriilg stomach

work for my man Friday: and, first or all, I gays him a pair of linen
drawers, which I had out of the poor gunner's chest I mentioned, which I
found in the wreck, and which, with a little alteration, fitted him very
well : and then I made him a jerkin of goat's-skin, as well as my skill would
allow (for I was now grown a tolerable good tailor); and I gave him a cap,
which I made of hare-skin, very convenient and fashionable enough: and
thus he was clothed, for the present, tolerably well, and was mighty well
pleased to see himself almost as well clothed as his master. It is true, he
went awkwardly in these clothes at first; wearing the drawers was very
awkward tohim, and the sleeves of the waiscoat galled his shoulders, and
the inside of his arms; but a little easing them where he complained they
hurt him,- and using himself to them, he took to them at length very well.

The next day alter I came home to my hutch with him I began to consider
where I should lodge him; and that I might do well for him, and yet be.
perfectly easy myself, I made a little tent for him in the vacant place be.
tween my two fortifications, in the inside of the last and in the outside of the
first. As there was a door or entrance there into my cave, I made a formal
framed doorocaae, and a door to it of boards, and set it up in the passage, a
little within the entrance; and, causing the door to open in the ina'de, I
barred it up in the night, taking in my ladders too; so that Friday could
no way come at me in the inside of my innermost wall, without making so
much noise in getting over that it must needs waken me; for my first wall
had now a complete roof over it of long poles, covering all my tent, and
leaning up to the side of the hill; which .was again laid across with smaller
sticks, instead of laths, and then thatched over agreat thickness with the
rice straw, which was strong, like reeds; and atthe hole or place which
was left to go in or out by the ladder I had placed a kind of trap-door,
which, if it had been attempted on the outside, would not have opened at
all, but would have fallen down, and made a great noise: as to weapons, I
took them all into my side every night. But I needed none of all this pre-
caution; for never man had a more faithful, loving, sincere servant, than
Friday was to me; without passions, sullenness, or designs, perfectly obliged
and engaged; his very atl'ections were tied'to me, like those of a child to a
father; and I dare say he would have sacrificed his life for the saving mine
upon any oceasion whatsoever: the many testimonies he gave me of this put
it out of doubt, and soon convinced me that I needed to use no precautions
a to my safety on his account.

This frequently gave me occasion to observe, and that with Wonder, that
however it had pleased God, in his providence, and in the government of
the works of his hands, to take trom so great a part of the world of his
creatures the best uses to which their faculties and the powers oftheir souls
are adapted, yet that he has bestowed upon them the same poweia, the

me reason, the same affections, the same sentiment; of kindness and oblit-
gatioa, the some passions and resentments of wrongs, the same genie or
gratitude, sincerity, fidelity, and all the <<pacified of doing good and
receiving good, that he has given to us; andthat,when he'pleases to Mar

my knees, said a great many thingsl did not understand; but I could easily
see the meaning was, to pray me not to kill him.

I soon found a way to convince him that I would do him no harm; and, tak
ing him up by the hand, laughed at him, and, pointing to the kid which I had
killed, beckoned to him to run and fetch it, which he did: and while he was
wondering, and looking to see how the creature was killed, I loaded my gun
again. By-and-by I saw a great fowl, like a hawk, sitting upon a tree,
within shot; so, to let Friday understand a little what I would do, I called
him to me again, pointed at the fowl, which was indeed a parrot, though I
thought it had been a hawk; I say, pointing to the parrot, and to my gun,
and to the ground under the parrot, to let him see I would make it fall,I
made him understand that I would shoot and kill that bird; accordingly, I
fired, and bade him look, and immediately he saw the parrot fall. He stood
like one frightened again, notwithstanding all I had said to him; and I found
he was the more amazed, because he did not see me put any thing into the
gun, but thought that there must be some wonderful fund of death and de-
struction in that thing, able to kill man, beast, bird, or any thing near or far
off; and the astonishment this created in him was such as could not wear
off for a long time; and I believe, if I would have let him, he would have
worshipped me and my gun. As for the gun itself, he would not so much
as touch it for several days after; but he would speak to it, and talk to it, as
if it had answered him, when he was by himself; which, as Iafterwards
learned of him, was to desire it not to kill him. Well, after his astonishment
was a little over at this, I pointed to him to run and fetch the bird I had shot,
which he did, but staid some time ; for the parrot, not being quite dead, had
fluttered away a good distance from the place where she fell: however, he
found her, took her up, and brought her to me; and, as I had perceived his
ignorance about the gun before, I took this advantage to charge the gun
again, and not to let him see me do it, that I might be ready for any other
mark that might present; but nothing more offered at that time: so I brought
home the kid, and the same evening I took the skin otf, and cut it out as

-.well as I could, and, having a pot fit for that purpose, I boiled or stewed
' 2 -some of the flesh, and made some very good broth. After I had begun to
eat some, I gave some to my man, who seemed very glad of it, and liked it
very well; but that which was strangest to him was to see me eat salt with
it. He made a sign to me that the salt was not good to eat; and, putting a
little into his own mouth, he seemed to nauseate it, and would spit and sput-
ter at it, washing his mouth with fresh water after it: on the other hand, I
took some meat into my mouth without salt, and I pretended to spit and
sputter, for want of salt, as fast as he had done at the salt; but it would not
do; he would never care for salt with his meat or in his broth; at least, not

for a great while, and then but a very little.-

Having thus fed him with boiled meat and broth, I was resolved to feast
him the next day with roasting a piece of the kid: this I did by hanging it
before the fire on a string, as I had seen many people do in England, setting
two poles up, one on each side of the fire, and one across on the tap,,and
tying the string to the cross stick, letting the meat turn continually. This
Friday admired very much; but, when he came to taste the flesh, he took so
many ways to tell me how well he liked it, that I could not but understand
him: and at last he told me, as well as he could, he would never eat man's
flesh any more, which I was very glad to hear. .
The next day I set him to work to beating some corn out, and sitting it
in the manner I used to do, as I observed before, and he soon understood
how to do it as well as I, especially after he had seen what the meaning of it
was, and that it was to make bread of it; for, after that, I let him see me'
make my bread, and bake it too- and, in a little time, Friday was ableto
do all the work for me as well as I could do it myself.

I began now to consider, that, having two months to feed instead of one, I

must provide more ground for my harvest, and plant a larger quantity of can:
than I hsed to do; so I marked out a larger piece of land, and began the
fence in the same manner as before, in which Friday worked not only very
willin'gly and very hard. but did it very cheerfully: and I told him what it
e was for; that it was for corn to make more bread, because he was flow '1";
me, and that -I might have enough for him and myself too. Heappeared
very sensible of that part, and let me know that he thought I had much
more labour upon me on his account than I had for myself; and that-he
would work the harder for me, if I would tell him what to do.

This was the pleasantest year of all the life I led in this place: Friday
began to talk pretty well, and understand the names of almost every thing I
had occasion to callfor, and of every place I had to send him to, and talked
a great deal to me; so that, in sliorty'llihegan now to have some use fordny
tongue again, which, indeed, I had very little occasion for before, that is to say,
about speech. Besides the pleasure of talking to him, I had a singular satis.'
faction in the fellow himself: his simple unfeigned honesty. appeared to me
more and more every day, and I began really to love the creature; and, on
his side, I believe he loved me more than it was possible for hirnLever to love
any thing before. .

I had a mind once to try if he had any hankering inclination to his own
country again; and, having taught him English so well that he could answer
me almost any question, I asked him whetherthe nation that he belonged to
never conquered in battle? At which he srmled, and said, ' Yes, yes, we
always fight the better.' that is, he meant, always get the better infight:
and so we began the following discourse: ---

Blaster. You always fight the better, how name you to be taken prisoner
then, Friday t

Richy. My nation beat much, for all that. '

Master. How beat? If your nation beat them, how came you to be
taken ? '

Friday. They more many than my nation in the place where me was;
they take one," two, three, and me; my nation over-beat them inthe yonder
Olace. where me no was ; there my nation take one,.two, great thousand.

By this I understood that my loan Friday had formerly been among the
savages who used to come on short: on the farther part of the island. .on the
some man-eating oocssions'he was now biouaht for; and: some time after,
when I took the "courage to carry him to that side, being the some I formerly
mentioned, he presently 'knew the place, and told me he was there once
when they ate up twenty men, two women, and one child: he could not tell
twenty in English, but he numbered them, by laying so many stones in a
tow, and pointing to me to tell them over.

I have tom this passage, because it introduces what foflows , that, after I
had this discourse with him. I asked him how for it was from our island to
the shore, and whether the canoes were not often lost. He told me there
was no danger, no canoes ever losthhot thst, after s little way out to seat
there was a current and wind. always one way in the morning. the other in

said, ' Yeti" . '
From these things I began to instruct him in theknowEdge of the: true

with pleasure the idea of Jesus Christ being sent to redeem Ins-and ottho

I endeavoured to clear up this hand to my man Friday; and told him, that
the pretence of their old men going up to the mountains to say 0 to their
god Benamuckee was a cheat; and their bringing word from thence what
he said was muchtmore so: that if they met with any answer, or spake with
any one there, it must be with an evil spirit: and then I entered into a long
discourse with him about the devil, the original of him, his rebellion against
God, his enmity to man, the reason of it, his setting himself up in the dark
parts of the world to be worshipped instead of God, and as God, and the
many stratagcms he made use of to delude mankind to their ruin ;_ how he
had a secret access to our passions and to our afl'ections, and to adapt his
snares to our inclinations, so as to cause us even to be our own tempters, and
run upon our destruction by our own choice.

I found it was not so easy to imprint right notions in his mind about the
devil as it was about the being of a God: nature assisted all my arguments
to evidence to him even the necessity of a great First Cause, and overruling
governing Power, a secret directing Providence, and of the equity and
justice of paying homage to him thatomade us, and the like: but there ap-
peared nothing of this kind in the notion of an evil spirit; of his original, his
being, his nature, and, above all, of his inclination to do evil, and to draw us
m to do so too: and the poor creature puzzled me once in such a manner,
by a question merely natural and innocent, that l scarce knew what to say
to him. [had been talking a great deal to him of the power of God, his
omnipotence, his aversion to sin, his being a consuming fire to the workers
of iniquity; how, as he had made us all, he could destroy us and all the
world in a moment; and he listened with great seriousness to me all the
while. After this,.I had been telling him how the devil was God's enemy in
the hearts of men, and used all his malice and skill to defeat the good designs
of Providence, and to ruin the kingdom of Christ in the world, and the like.
' Well,' says Friday, ' but you say God is so strong, so great; is he not much
strong, much might as the devil ?'--' Yes, yes,' says I, ' Friday, God is
stronger than the devil: God is above the devil, and therefore we pray to
God to tread him down under our feet, and enable us to resist his tempta-
tions, and quench his fiery darts.'--' But,' says he again, 'if God much
stronger, much might as the devil, why God no kill the devil, so make him
no more do wicked t' I was strangely surprised at this question ; and, after
all, though I was now an old man, yet I was but a young doctor, and ill
qualified for a casuist, or a solver of difficulties; and, at first, I could not tell
what to say; so I pretended not to hear him, and asked him what he said;
but he was too earnest for an answer to forget his question, so that he re-
peated it in the veiy same broken words as above. By this time I had
recovered myself a little, and I said, ' God will at last punish him severely; he
is reserved for the judgment, and is to be cast into the bottomless pit, to
dwell with everlasting fire.' This did not satisfy Friday; but he returns
upon me, repeating my words, ' Reserve at last .- me no understand; but why
not kill the devil now; not kill great ago ?'--' You may as well ask me,' said
I, ' why God does not kill you and me, when we do wicked things here that
offend him ? \Ve are preserved to repent and be pardoned. He mused some
time on this. ' Well, well,' says he, mighty affectionately, 'that well: so
you, I, devil, all wicked, all preserve, repent, God pardon all.' Here I was
run down again b 1 him to the last degree , and it was a testimony to me
how the mere notions of nature, though they will guide reasonable creatures
to the knowledge of a God, and of a worship or homage due to the supreme
being of God, as the consequence of our nature, yet nothing but divine re-
velation can form the knowledge of Jesus Christ, and of redemption purchased
for us, of a Mediator of the new covenant, and of an Intercessor at the foot-
stool of God's throne; I say, nothing but a revelation from Heaven can form
these in the soul; and that, therefore, the Gospel of our Lord and Saviour
Jesus Christ, I mean the Word of God, and the Spirit of God, promised
for the guide and sanctifier of his people, are the absolutely necessary in-
structors of the souls of men in the saving knowledge of God, and the means
of salvation. .

I therefore diverted the present discourse between me and my man, rising
up hastily, as upon some sudden occasion of going out; then, sending him
for something a good way off, I seriously prayed to God that he would en-
able me to instruct savingly this poor savage; assisting, by his Spirit, the
heart of the poor ignorant creature to receive the light of the knowledge of
God in Christ, reconciling him to himself, and would guide me to speak so
to him from the word of God, as his conscience might be convinced, his eyes
'opened and his soul saved. When he came again to me, I entered into a
long discourse with him upon the subject of the redemption of man by the
Saviour of the world, and of the doctrine of the Gospel preached from
Heaven, viz., of repentance towards God, and faith in our blessed Lord
Jesus. I then explained to him, as well as I could, why our blessed Re-
deemer took not on him the nature of angels, but the seed of Abraham; and
'how, for that reason, the fallen angels had no share in the redemption; that
he came only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel, and the like.

I had, God knows, more sincerity than knowledge in all the methods I
took for this poor creature's instruction, and must acknowledge what I be-
lieve all that act upon the same prmciple will find, that, in laying things
open to him, I really informcdand instructed myself in many things that
either I did not know, or had not fully considered before, but which oc-
curred naturally to my mind upon searching into them, for the information
of. this poor savage; and I had more atfection in my inquiry after things
upon this occasion than ever I felt before: so that, whether this poor wild
wretch was the better for me or no, I had great reason to be thankful that
ever he came to me; my grief sat lighter upon me, ; my habitation grew
comfortable to me beyond measure: and when I reflected that, in this soli-
tary life which I had been confined to, I had not only been moved to look
up to Heaven myself, and to seek to the hand that had brought me here,
but was now to be made an instrument, uIIdeI PIovidence, to save the
life, and, I'm aught I knew, the soul, of a poor savage, and bring him to the
true knowledge of religion, and of the Christian doctrine, that he might142 was 1.1"-an snvamunns

know Christ Jesus," in whom is life eternal; I say, when I reflected upon all
these things, a secret joy ran through every part of my soul, and I frequently
rejoiced that ever I was brought to this place, which I had so ofien thought
the most dreadflrl of all afflictions that could possibly have befallen me.

I continued in this thankful frame all the remainder of my time; and the
conversation which employed the hours between Friday and me was such as
made the three years which we lived there together perfectly and completely
happy, if any such thing as complete happiness'can be formed in a sublunary
state. This savage was now a good Christian, a much better than I;
though I have reason to hope, and bless God for it, that we were equally
penitent, and comforted restored penitents. We had here the word of God
to read, and no farther ofi' from his Spirit to instruct than if we had been
in England. I always applied myself, in reading the Scriptures, to let him
know, as well as I could, the meaning of what I read, and he again, by hrs
serious inquiries and questioniugs, made me, as I said before, a much better
scholar in the Scripture-knowledge than I should ever have been by my
own mere private reading. Another thing I cannot refrain from obwrving
here also, from experience in this retired part of my life, viz, how infinite
and inexpressible a blessing it is that the knowledge of God, and of the doc-
trine of salvation by Christ Jesus, is so plainly laid down in the word of
God, so easy to be received and understood, that, as the bare reading the
Scripture made me capable of understanding enough of my duty to carry
me directly on to the great work of sincere repentance for my sins, and lay-
ing hold of a Saviour for life and salvation, to a stated reformation in practice,
and obedience to all God's commands, and this without any teacher or in-
structor (I mean human); so the same plain instruction suficiently served
to the enlightening this savage creature, and bringing him to' be such _a
Christian as I have known few equal to him rn my life.

As to all the disputes, wrangling, strife, and contention, which have hap.
pened' in the world about religion, whether niceties in doctrines or schemes
of church-government, they were all perfectly useless to us, and, for aught
I can yet see, they have been so to the rest of the world. \Ve had the sure
guide to heaven, viz, the word of God; and we had, blessed be God
comfortable views of the Spirit of God teaching and instructing us by his
word, leading us into all truth, and making us both willing and obedient to '
the instruction of his word. And I cannot see the least use that the greatest
knowledge of the disputed points of religion, which have made such con-
fusions in the world, would have been to us, if we could have obtained it.-_-
But I must go on with the historical part of things, and take every part in
its order.

After Friday and I became more intimately acquainted, and that he
could understand almost all I said to him, and speak pretty fluently, though
rn broken English, to me, I acquainted him with my own history, or at
least so much of it as related to my coming to this place; how I had lived
here, and how long: I let him into the mystery, for such it was to him, of
gunpowder and bullet, and taught him how to shoot. I gave him a knife,
which he was wonderfuny delighted with; and I made him a belt. with a
frog hanging toit, such as in England we wear hangers" in , and in thetrog,
instead of a hanger, I gave him a hatchet, which was not only as good a
weapon, in some cases, but much more useful upon other occasions

I described to him the countries of'Europe, particularly England, which I
came from; how we lived, how we worshipped God, how we behaved to
one another, and how we traded in ships to all parts of the world. I gave
him an account of the wreck which I had been on _board.oi;;audtshewcd
him, as near as I could, the place where she lay , but she was all beaten in
pieces before, and gone. I shewed him the ruins of our boat, which we
lost when we escaped, and which I could not stir with my whole strength
then, but was now fallen almost all to pieces. Upon seeing this boat
Friday stood musing a great while, and said nothing. I asked him what it
was he studied upon. At last, says he, ' Me see such boat like come to place
at my nation.' I did not understand him a good while; but, at last,wheu I had
examined farther into it, I understood by him that a boat, such as that had
beam-came on shore upon the country where he lived; that is, as he ex-
plained it, was driven thither by stress of weather. I presently imagined
that some European ship must have been cast away upon their coast, and
the boat might get loose, and drive' ashore; but was so dull, that I never
once thought of men making their escape from a wreck thither, much less
whence they might come : so I only inquired after a description of the host.

Friday described the boat to me well enough; but brought me better to
understand him when he added, with some warmth, ' We save the white
mans from drown.' Then I presently asked him if there were any white
mans, as hecalled them, in the boat. ' Yes,' he said; ' the boat (allot
white mans.' I asked him how many. He told upon his lingers seventeen.
I asked him then what became of them. He told me, 'They live; they
dwell at my nation.'

This put new thoughts into my head; for I presently imagined that these
might be the men belonging to the ship that was cast away. in the sight of
my island, as I now ealled it; and who, after the" ship was struck. on' the
rock, and they saw her inevitably lost, had saved themselves in their boat.
and were landed upon that wild shore among the savages. Upon this I .in-
quired of him mom'critically what was become of them. He assured m'e
they lived still there; that they had 'been there about four years ;. that.the
savages let them alone, and gave them victuals to live on. I askedihim how
it came to pass they did not kill them, and eat them. He said, (No; they
make brother 'with them ;' that rs, as I understood him, a truce; and then
he added; 'They no e'at mans but when make the war fight deg' that is to say,
they never eat any men but such- as come to fight with them, and are taken
in battle. '

It matter this, some considerable time, that, being upon the top ofthe hill,
at the east side of the island (from whence, as I have said, I had,' in 'a clear'
day, discovered'the main 'or continent of Amefica), Friday, the weather. being' 3144 1113 are 41111) sovexrones

all my uneasiness, he made me at last entirely his own agam; nor did he,
in the least, perceive that I was uneasy, and therefore I could' not suspect
him of deceit. '

One day, walking up the same hill, but the weather being hazy at sea,>>
that we could not see the continent, I called to him, and said,' Fridiy, do

mien, and saved his life, and so he would make them love me. Then he
told me, as well as he could, how kind they were to seventeen white men,
or bearded men, as he called them, who came on shore there in distress.

From this time, I confess I had a mind to venture over, and see if I could
possibly join with those bearded men, who, I made no doubt, were Spaniards
and Portuguese: not doubting but if i could we might find some method to.
taupe from thence, being upon the continent, and a good company toge~
ther, better than I could from an island forty miles otf the shore, and alone,
without help. So, after some days, I took Friday to work again, by way of
discourse; and told him I would give him a boat to go back to his own
nation; and, accordingly, I carried him to my frigate, which lay on the
other side of the island, and, having cleared it of water (for I always kept it
sunk in water), I brought it out, shewed it him, and we both Went into it.
I found he was a most dexterous fellow at managing it, and would make it
go almost as swift again as I could. So, when he was in, I said to him,
' Well, now, Friday, shall we go to your nation 2' He looked very dull at
my saying so; which, it seems, was because he thought the boat too small
to go so far: I then told him I had a bigger; so the next day I went to the
place where the first boat lay which I had made, but which I could not get
into the water. He said that was big enough: but then, as I had taken no
care of it, and it had lain two or three and twenty years there, the sun had
split and dried it, and it was, in a manner, rotten. Friday told me such a
boat would do very well, and would carry much enough vittle, drink, bread;
that was his way of talking. .

Upon the whole, I was by this time so fixed upon my design of going
over with him to the continent, that I told him we would go and make one

as big as that, and he should go home in it. He answered not one word,_

but looked very grave and sad. Iasked him what was the matter with
him ? He asked me again, ' Why you angry mad with Friday 1' What me
done i" I asked him what he meant: I told him I was not angry with him
at all. ' No angry!' says he, repeating the words several times; ' Why send
Friday home away to my nation ?'~--' Why,' says l, ' Friday, did not you say
you wished you were there t'---' Yes, yes,' says he, ' wish we both there;
no wish Friday there, no master there.' In a word, he would not think of
going there without me. 'I go there, Friday!' says I; ' what' shall I do
there ?' He returned very quick upon me at this: 'You do great deal
much good,' says he; ' you teach wild mans be good, sober, tame mans;
ou tell them know God, pray God, and live new life.'---' Alas! Friday,"
vs 1, ' thou knowest not what thou sayest ; I am but an ignorant man my-
self.'--' Yes, yes,' says he, ' you teachee me good, you teachee them good.
---' No, no, Friday,' says I, ' you shall go without me; leave me here to live
by myself, as I did before.' He looked confused again at that word; and,
running to one of the hatchets which he used to wear, he takes it up hastily.
and gives it to me. ' What must I do with this 2' says I to him. ' You take
' kill Friday; says he. ' What must I kill you for?" said I again. He retinas
very quick, fiWhat you send Friday away for t Take kill Friday, no send
so - T . .
Friday away.' This he spoke so earnestly, that I saw tears stand in his eyes:
in a word, I so plainly discovered the ntrnost atfection in him to me, and a
firm resolution in him, that I told him then, and often after, that I would
never send him away from me, if he was willing to stay with me.

Upon the whole, as I found, by all his discourse, a settled afl'ech'on to me,
and that nothing should part him from me. so I found all the foundation of
his desire to go to his own country was laid in his ardent afi'cction to the
people, and his hopes of my domg them good: a thing, which, as] had no
notion of myself, so I had not the least thought, or intention, or desire of
undertaking it. But still I found a strong inclination to my attempting an
escape, as above, founded on the supposition gathered from the discourse.
viz" that there were seventeen bearded men there: and, therefore, with-
out any more delay, I went to work with Friday, to find out a great tree
proper to fell, and make a large periagna, or canoe, to undertake the voyage.
There were trees enough in the island to have builta little fleet, not of
periaguas, or canoes, but even of good large vessels: but the main thing [
looked at was, to get one so near the water that we might launch it when it
was made, to avoid the mistake I committed at first. At last, Friday pitched
upon a tree; for I found he knew much better than I what kind of wood
was fittest for it; nor can I tell, to this day, what wood to all the tree we
cut down, except that it was very like the tree we call fustic, or between
that and the Nicaragua wood, for it was much of the same colour and smell.
Friday was for burning the hollow or cavity of this tree out, to make it for a
boat; but I shewed him how to cut it with t00ls; which, after I had shewed
him how to use, he did very handily: and in about a month's hard labour we
finished it, and made it very handsome; especially when, with ouraxes,
which I shewed him how to handle, we cut and hewed the outside into the
true shape of a boat. After this, however, it cost us near a fortnight's time
to get her along, as it were inch by inch, upon great rollers into the water;
but, when she was in, she would have carried twenty men with great ease.

When she was in the water, and though she wasso big, it amazed me to
see with what dexterity, and how swift, my man Friday would manage her,
turn her, and paddle her along. So I asked him if he would, and if we
might, venture over in her. 'Yes,' he said; 'we venture over in her very
well, though great blow wind.' However, I had a farther design, that he
knew nothing of, and that was to make a mast and a sail, and to fit her
with an anchor and cable. As to a mast, that was easy enough to get; so
I pitched upon a straight young cedar-tree, which I found near the place, and
which there were great plenty of in the island; and I set Friday to work to
cut it down, and gave him directions 'how to shape and order it. But as to

'the sail, that was my particular care. Iknew _I bad old sails, or rather
pieces of old sails, enough; but as i had had them now six-and-twenty 'years
by me, and had not been very careful to preserve them, not imagining that
I should ever have this kind of use for them, I did not doubt but they were
all rotten, and, indeed, most of them were so. However, I found two
pieces which appeared pretty good, and with these I went to work; and ;

or aoamsou causoa. 147

with a great deal of pains, and awkward stitching you may be sure, fo.
want'ot' needles, I at length made a three-cornered ugly thing, like whs

we call'in England a shoulder-of-mutton sail, to go with a boom at bottom,
and a little short sprit at the top, such as usually our ships' long~boats sail
with, and such as I best knew how to manage, as it'was such a one I had
to the boat' in which I made my escape from Barbary, as related in the first
part of my story.

I was near two months performing this last work, via, rigging and
fitting my mast and sails; for I finished them very complete, making a
small stay, and a sail, or fore-sail, to it, to assist, if we should turn to wind-
ward ; and, which was more than all, [fixed a rudder to'the stern of her, to
steer with. I was but a bungling shipwright, yet, as I knew the'usethl-
ness, and even necessity, of such a thing, I applied myself with so much
pains to do it, that at last I brought it to pass; though, considering themany
dull contrivances I had for it that failed, I think it cost me almost as much
labour as making the boat.

Alter all this was done, I had my man Friday to teach as to what belonged
to the navigation of my boat; for, though he knew very well how to paddle
a canoe, he knew nothing what belonged to a sail and a rudder; and was
the most amazed when he saw me work the boat to and again in the ses'
by the rudder, and how the sail gibbed, and filled this way or that way,
as the course we sailed changed; I say, when he saw this, he stood like one
astonished and amazed. However, with a little use, I made all these things
familiar to him, and he became an expert sailor, except as to. them-
pass; I could make him understand very little of that. On the other
hand, as there was very little cloudy weather, and seldom or never any fogs'
in those parts, there was the less occasion fora compass, seeing the~starr

something of this kind. when I called to Friday. and bid him go to the eea~

rally got once a week, for the sake of the eggs as well a: the flesh. Friday
had not been long gone, when he came running hack, and tlew over my
outer-wall, or fence. like one that felt not the ground, or the step: he set
his feet on; and. before I had time to speak to him, he cries out to me, ' 0

fellow trembled so, that 3 source knew what to do with him. I comforted
him as well as i could, and told him i was in as much danger or he, and
. that they would eat me as well as him: 'But,' aye 1, 'Friday, we must to:

This. with the ahhorrence of the inhuman errand these wretches came
about, tilled me with such indignation that I came down again to Friday,
and told him I was resolved to go down to them, and kill them all; and asked
him if he would stand by me. Hehad now got overhis flight; and his
spirits being a little raised with the dram I had given him, he was We
cheerful, and told me, as beliore, he would die whenl hid die.

In this fitot' fury [took and divided the arms which I had charged, as
before, between us: [gave Friday one pistol tostick in his girdle, and three
guns upon his shoulder; and [took one pistol, and the other three guns myo
self; and in this posture we marched out. I took a small bottle of rum in
my pocket, and gave Friday a large bag with more powder and bullets; and,
as toorders. [charged him to keep close behind me, and not to stir, or
shoot, or do any thing, till I bid him; and, in the mean time, not to speak
sword. In this posture I fetched acompsss to my right hand of near.a
mile, as well to get over the creek as to get into the wood; so that I might
come within shot of them before I should be discovered, which [ had seen,
by my glass, it was easy to do.

While I was making this march, my former thoughts returning, I began
to abate my resolution .- [do not mean that I entertained any fear of their
number; for, as they were naked, unarmed wretches, it is certain I was
superior to them; nay, though [ had been alone. But it occurred to my
thoughts what call, what occasion, much less what necem'ty I was in, to
go and dip my hands in blood, to attack people who had neither done nor
intended me any wrong; who, as to me, were innocent, and whose bar.
barons customs were their own disaster; being, in them, a token indeed of
God's having left them, with the other nations of that part of the world, to
such stupidity, and to such inhuman courses; but did not call me to take
upon me to be a judge of their actions, much less an executioner of his
justice; that. whenever he thought (it, he would take the cause into his .
own haudu, and, by national vengeance, punish them, as a people, for "use
tioual crimes; but that, in the mean time, it was none of my businel; that,-
it was true, Friday might justify it, because he was a declared enemy, and'
in a state of war with those very particular people, and it was lawful for
him to attack tliem; but I could not say the same with respect to myself.
These things were so warmly pressed upon my thoughts all the way as I:
went, that I resolved I' would only go and place myself near them," that I:
might observe their barbarous feast, and that[ would actthen as Godsbould;
direct, but that, unless something ofl'ered that was more a call to me than-
yet [knew of, I would not meddle with them.

With this resolution I entered the wood; and, with all possible value.
and silence, Friday fdllowing close at my heels, I marched tilde-meta the
skirt ofthe wood, on the side which was next tothem,. only thatone'eornee
of the wood lay between me and them. Here I eslled softlytt's Friday. and

they were doing. He did so; and came immediately back to me, and told
me they might be plainly viewed there; that they were all about their fire,
eating the flesh of one of their prisoners, and that another lay bound open
the sand it little from them. which, he said. they would kill next. and
which tired all the very soul within me. He told me it was not one of their
nation, but one of the bearded men he had told me of. that more to their
country in the boat. I was filled with horror at the very naming the white
bearded man; and, going to the tree, I saw plainly, by my glass, 3 white
man, who lay upon the beach of the sea, with his hands and his feet tied
with dogs, or things like when; and that be was an European, and bad
clothes on.

There was another tree, and a little thicket beyond it, about fifty yuds
nearer to them than the place where Iwna, which, by going a little way
about, I saw 1 might come at undiscovered, and that then I should be with-
in half ashot of them : so I withheld my passion, though I was indeed enraged
to the highest degree; and, going back about twenty panes, i got behind
some bushes, which held all the way till I came to the other tree; and then
came to a little rising ground. which gave me afull view of them, at the
distance of about eighty yards.

1 had now not a moment to lose, for nineteen of the dreadful wretcbee set
upon the ground all close huddled together, and had just sent the other two
to butcher the poor Christian, and bring him, perhaps, limb by limb, to
their fire; and they were atooping down to untie the bands at his feet. I
turned to Fridaym'Now, Friday," said l, ' do as 1 bid thee.' Friday said he
would. 'Then. Friday; says l, ' do exactly as you see me do; fail in nothing.'
Sol set down one of the musket: and the {curling-piece upon the ground
and Friday did the like by his; and with the other musket l took my aim at
the savages, bidding him to do the like: their, asking him if he was ready,
he said, 'Yes.' 'Then fire at them,' said I; and the same moment! fired aleo'

Friday took his aim so much better than I, that, on the side that be shot;
no killed two of them, and wounded three more; and on my side I killed
one, and wounded two. They were, you may beeure, in a dreadful conster-
nation; and all of them who were not hurt jumped upon their feet, but did
not immediately know which way to run, or which way to look, for they
knew not from whence their destruction came. Friday kept h'ia eyes clone
upon me, that. eel had hid him, he might observe what I did; no, as anon an
the first shot was made, I threw down the piece, and took up the fowling-
piece, and Friday did the like: he saw me cock and present: he did the
same again. ' Are you ready, Friday t' said l.--'Yee, any: he.' ' Let fly. then,'
any: I, "in the name of God 3' and with that] tired again mong the amazed
watches, and so did Friday; and, as our pieces were now loaden with what
I called swan-shot, or email pistol-bullets, we found only two drop, but no
my were wounded, that they ran about yelling and screaming like mad
creatures, all bloody, and mm of them miserably wounded, whereof three
more fell quickly ailer, though not quite dead.

' New, Friday, any: I laying down the diocharged pieoee, and taking up
the musket which was yet loaden, follow me; which he did with a great
deal of courage; upon which I rushed out of the wood, and showed myself;
and Friday clone at my foot. As soon as! perceived they saw die, I shouted
as loud as] could, and bade Friday do so too ; and, running es feet as i could,
which, by the way, was not very fast, being loaded with arms as l'wan, I
made directly towards the poor victim, who was, as I said. lying oponithe
beach, or shore, between the place where they eat and the sea. The two
hoteliers. who were just going to work with himihad ten him at the surprise
of our first fire, and fled in a terrible fright to the moeide. and had jumped
into a canoe, and three more of the rest made the same way. I turned to
Friday, and bade him step forwards, and fire at them; he understood me
immediately, and, running about forty yards, to he nearer them. he shot
at them, and I thought he had killed them all, for I saw them all {all of a
heap into the boat, though [saw two of them up again quickly: however,
he killed two of. them, and wounded the third so, that he lay down in the
bottom of the boat as if he had been dead.

While my man Friday fired at them, I pulled out myknifis, and cat the
flags that bound the poor" victim; and. loosing his hands and feet, I lifted
him up. and asked him in the Portuguese tongue what he was. Heat>>
swered, in Latim Christianus; but was so weak and faint that he could scarce
stand or speak. I took my bottle out of my pocket. and gave it him. making
signs that he should drink, which he did; and 1 gave him a piece of bread,
which he ate. Then I asked him what countryman he'was: and he said,
Espagniole; and, being a little recovered, let me know,by all the signs he
could pngsihly make. how much he was in my debt for his deliverance:
' Seignior,' said i. with as much Spanish as I could make op, "we will tell:
shot-wards. but we must fight now: if you have any strength left. take the
pistol and sword, and lay about you.' He took them' very thankfully; and,
no sooner had he the arms in his hands, but, as if they had put new vigour
into him, he flew upon his murderers like a fury, and had not two ofthetn in
pieces innn'instant; for the truth insulin whole was amupriaeto them."
the poor creatures were so much frightened with the noise other pieces, that:
they fell down for mere amazement and fear, and had no more power to at>>
tempt their own escape than their flesh had to resist our shot: and that was
the cone of those fire that Friday shot at in the boat; br,' as three of the'm'
fell with the hurt they received, so the other two fell with the fright. .

I kept my piece in my hand still without firing, being willing to ke'ep my
charge ready, bearish. i had' given the Spaniard my pistol and sword: so I
called to Friday. and bade him run up to the treefrom whence we not dred.'
and fetch the arms which lay there that had been discharged. which he did

\
be imagined, though weak, had fought this Indian 9. good while, and had on
him two great wounds on his head ; but the savage, being a stout lusty fel-
low, closing in with him, had thrown him down, being faint, and was wnug-
ing my sword out of his hand ; when the Spaniard, though under-most, wisely
quitting the sword, drew the pistol from his girdle, shot the savage through
the body, and killed him upon the spot, before I, who was running to help
him, could come near him.

Friday, being now let! to his liberty, pursued the flying wretchcs, with no
weapon in his hand but his hatchet; and with that he (lespatchcd those three,
who, as 1 said before, were wounded at first, and fallen, and all the rest he
could come up with: and the Spaniard coming to me for a gun, I gave him
one of the fouling-pieces, with which he pursued two of the savages, and
wounded them both ; but, as he was not able to run, they both got from him
into the wood, where Friday pursued them, and killed one of them, but the
other was too nimble for him; and, though he was wounded, yet had plunged
himself into the sea, and swam, with all his might, off to those twu who were
let! in the canoe, which three in the canoe, with one wounded, that we knew
not whether he died or no, were all that escaped our hands of one-and-twenty.
The account of the whole is as follows :---Three killed at our first shot from
the tree; two killed at the next shot; two killed by Friday in the boat; two
killed by Friday of those at first wounded; one killed by Friday in the
wood; three killed by the Spaniard; four killed, being found dropped here
and there, of their wounds, or killed by Friday in his chase of them; four
escaped in the boat, whereof one wounded, if not dead.--'I'wenty-one in all.

Those that were in the canoe worked hard to get out of gun-shot; and,
though Friday made two or three shots at them, I did not find that he hit
any of them. Friday would fain have had me take one of their mnoes, and
pursue them; and, indeed, I was very anxious about their escape, lest, car-
rying the news home to their people, they should come back perhaps with
two or three hundred of the canoes, and devour us by mere multitude; so I
consented to pursue them by sea, and, running to one of their canoes, I
jumped in, and bade Friday follow me; but, when l was in' the canoe, I was
surprised to find another poor creature lie there, bound hand and foot, as the
Spaniard was, for the slaughter, and almost dead with fear, not knowing
what was the matter; for he had not been able to look up over the side of
the boat, he was tied so hard neck and heels, and had been tied so long that
he had really but little life in him.

I immediately cut the twisted flags or rushes which they had bound
him with, and would have helped him up; but he could not stand or speak,
but grosned most piteously, believing, it seems, still, that he was only no
bound in order to be killed. When Friday came to him, I bade him speak
to him, and tell him of his deliverance; and, pulling out my bottle, made
him give the poor wrcteh a dram; which, with the news of his being de-
livered. revived him, and he sat up in the boat. But when Friday came to
near him speak, and look in his face, it would have moved any one to tears
to have seen how Friday kissed him, embraced him. hugged him, cried,
laughed, halloed, jumped about. dam-ed, sung: then cried again, wrung
his hands, beat his own face. and head: and then sung and jumped about
again, like a distracted creature. It was a good while before I could make
him speak to me, or tell me what was the matter; but, when he came a. little
to himself, he told me that it was his father.

It is not easy for me to express how it moved me to see. what ecstasy and
lllial atl'eetion had worked in this poor savage at the sight of his father, and
of his being delivered from death; nor, indeed, can I describe half the ex-
travaganeies of his affection: after this; for he went into the boat, and out of
the boat, a great many times: when he went in to him, he would sit down
by him, open his breast, and hold his father's head close to his bosom for
many minutes together, to nourish it; then he took his arms and uncle;
which were numbed and stifl' with the binding, and ehafed and rubbed them
with his hands; and l, perceiving what the case was, gave him some. rum
out of my bottle to rub them with, which did them a great deal of good.

This atfair put an end to our pursuit of the canoe with the other savages,
who were now got almost out of sight; and it was happy for us that we did
not, for it blew so hard within two hours after, and before they could be got
a quarter of their way, and continued blowing so hard all night, and that
from the north-west, which was against them, that I could not suppose their
boat could live, or that they ever reached their own coast.

But, to return to Friday: He was so busy about his father, that I could not
find in my heart to take him off for some time: but, after I thought be male
leave him a little, I called him to me, and he came jumping and laughing,
and pleased to the highest extreme; and then I asked him if he had given
his father any bread. He shook his head, and said, ' None; ugly dog eat
all up self.' I then gave him a cake of bread, out of a little pouch 1 carried
on purpose; I also gave him a drum for himself, but he would not taste it,
but carried it to his father. I had in my pocket two or three bunches of
raisins, so I gave him a handful of them for his father. He had no sooner
given his father these raisins, but I saw him come out of the boat, and run
away, as if he had been bewitehed, he ran at such a rate; for he was the
swiflest fellow on his feet that ever I saw : I say he. ran at such a rate, that
he was out of sight, as it were, in an instant; and, though I called, and hal-
loed out too, after him, it was all one, away he went; and in a quarter of
an hour I saw him come back again, though not sofast as he went; and, as
he came nearer, I found his pace slacker, because he had something in his
hand. When he came up to me, I found he had been quite home for an
earthen jug, or pot, to bring his father some fresh water, and that lie-had
two more. cakes or loaves of bread: the bread he gave me, but the water he
carried to his father; however, as I was very thirsty too, I took a little sup
of it. The water revived his father more than all the rum or spirits I had
given him, for he was just fainting with thirst.

When his father had drank, I called to him to know if there was any water
tell: he said, ' Yes ;' and I bade him give it to the poor Spaniard, who was in

so U
as much want of it as his father; and I sent one of the cakes that Friday
brought to the Spaniard too, who was indeed very weak, and was reposing
himself upon a green place under the shade of a tree; and whose limbs were
also very stifl', and very much swelled with the rude bandage he had been
tied with. When I saw that, upon Friday's coming to him With the water,
he sat up and drank, and took the bread, and began to eat, I went to him,
and gave him a handful of raisins: he looked up in my face with all the
tokens of gratitude and thankfuluess that could appear in any countenance;
but was so weak, notwithstanding he had so exerted himself in the fight,
that he could not stand up upon his feet: he tried to do it two or three
times, but was really not able, his uncles were so swelled and so painful to
him; so I bade him sit still, and caused Friday to rub his uncles, and bathe
them with rum, as he had done his father's.

I observed the poor affectionate creature, every two minutes, or perhaps
less, all the while he was here, turn his head about, to see if his father was
in the same place and posture as he left him sitting; and at last he found he
was not to be seen; at which he started 'up, and, without speaking a word,
flew with that swittness to him, that one could scarce perceive his feet to
touch the ground as he went: but,>>when he came, he only found he had laid
himself down to case his limbs, so Friday came back to ma presently; and
then 1 spoke to the Spaniard to let Friday help him up, if he could, and lead
him to the boat, and then he should carry him to our dwelling, where I
would take care of him: but Friday, a lusty strong fellow, took the Spaniard
quite up upon his back, and carried him away to the boat, and set him down '
softly upon the side or gunnel of the canoe, with his feet in the inside of it;
and then, lilting him quite in, he set him close to his father; and, preseufly
stepping out again, launched the boat off, and paddled it along the shore
faster than I'could walk, though the wind blew pretty hard too: so he
brought them both safe into our creek, and, leaving them in the boat, ran
away to fetch the other canoe. As he passed me, I spoke to him, and asked him
whither he went. He told me, ' Go fetch more boat :' so away he went like
the wind, for sure never man or horse ran like him; and he had the other
canoe in the creek almost as soon as I gotto it by land; so he waited me
over, and then went to help our new guests out of the boat, which he did;
but they were neither of them able to walk, so that potir Friday knew not
what to do.

To remedy this, I went to work in my thought, and, calling to Friday to
bid them sit down on the bank while he came to me, I soon made a kind of
a handvbarrow to lay them on, and Friday and I carried them both up to-
gether upon it, between us. But when we got them to the outside of our
wall, or fortification, we were at a worse loss than before, for it W88 im-
possible to get them over, and I was resolved not to break it down : so I set
to work again; and Friday and I, in about two hours' time, made a 'very'
handsome tent, covered with 'old sails, and abovethat with boughs of tree's.
being in the space without our outward fence, and between that and the:
groreot' young wood which I had planted; and here we made them two
bedsot'such things as I had, viz, of good rice-straw, with blankets lsidnpou
it. to lie on, and another to cover them, on each bed. '

My island was now peopled, and I thought myself very rich in subjects;
and it was a merry reflection, which I frequently made, how like a king I
looked. First of all, the whole country was my own mere property, so that
I had an undoubted right of dominion. Secondly, my people were perfectly
subjected; I was absolutely lord and lawgiver; they all owed their lives to
me, and were ready to lay down their lives, if there had been occasion-torn;
for me. It was remarkable, too, I had but three subjects; and they were-of
three difl'erent rehgions: my man Friday was a Protestant, his father was a
Pagan and a cannibal, and the Spaniard was a Papist: however, I allowed
liberty of conscience throughout my dominious :---But this is by the way.

As soon as I had secured my two weak rescued prisoners, and given them
shelter, and a place to rest them upon, I began to think of making some pro-
vision for them; and, the first thing I did, I ordered Friday to take a
yearling goat, betwixt a kid and a goat, out of my particular flock, to be
killed ; when I cut 03' the hinder quarter, and, chopping it into small pieer I
set Friday to work to boiling and atewiug, and made them a very good dish,
I assure you. of flesh and broth, having put some barley and rice also intothe'
broth: and as l cooked it without doors. for I made no fire within my-Eden
wall, so I carried it all into the new tent, and, having set a table therein!"
them, I sat down, and ate my dinner also with them, and, as well as'Icould.
cheered them, and encouraged them. Friday was my interpreter, especially
to his father, and, indeed, to the Spaniard too; for the Spaniard spokethe
language of the savages pretty well.

Alter we had dined, or rather supped. I ordered Friday to tahe one of the
canoes, and go and fetch our muskets and other fire-arms, which. for want of
time, we had left upon the place of battle: and, the next day, I ordered him
to go and bury the dead bodies of the savages, which lay open to the sun,'
and would presently be offensive. I also ordered him to bury the horrid re-
mains of their barbarous feast, which I knew were pretty much, and which
I could notthiult of doing myself; nay, I could not bear to seethem, if I
went3.that"way; all which he-'punctually performed, and etfaeed the'very'
appeai-snce'ot theaavagea being there; so that, when I went sgainyl could
scarce know where it was, otherwise than by the corner of the woodpoiutin'g
to the place. '

I then began to enter into a little conversation with my two new subjects.-
and, first, I set Friday to inquire of his father what he thought of the escape
of the savages in that canoe, and whether we might expect-a return officer
with a power too great for us to resist. His first opinion was, that the
savages in the boat never could live out thestorm which blew that night
they went 06', but must, of necessity. be drowned, or driven sooth to those
othel' shores, where they were as sure to be devoured as they were to be
drowned, if they were cast away: but, as to what they would do, if they

' came safe on shore, he said heaknew-not ;- but it was his opinion that they

were to dreadfully frightened with the manner of their being attacked, a:
noise, and the tire, that he believed they would tell the people they wer'
ell killed by thunder and lightning. not by the hand of man; and that the
two which appeared, viz... 1' nday and l, were two heavenly spirits, or dates,
come down to destroy them, and not men with weapons. This, he eeid, he
knew. because he heard them all cry out so, in their language, one to one
other, for it was impossible for them to conceive that a man could dart tire,
end speak thunder, and hill at a distance, without lifting up the hand, no
was done now, and this old savage was in the right; for, as I understood
hinee, by other bands, the savage: never attempted to go over to the
island ntterwards: they were so terrified with the accounts given by those
four men (for, it seems, they did escape the sen), that they believed who.
ever went to that enchanted island would be destroyed with fire from the
3065. This, however, I knew not; and therefore we: under continual ep~
probed-lions {or :1 good while, and kept always upon my guard, with all my
army: for, as there were now four of no, 1 would have ventured open a bun.
drcd of them. fairly in the open field, at any time.'

In a little time, however, no more cunocs appearing, the fear of their
coming wore otf; and I began to take my former thoughts of a voyage to
the main into consideration; being likewise assured, by Friday's father, that
I might depend upon good usage from their nation, on his account, if I
would go. But my thoughts were n little suspended when I had a certain
discourse with the Spaniard, and when I understood that there were six-
teen more of his countrymen and Portuguese, who, having been cast away,
and made their escape to that side, lived there at peace, indeed, with the
ravages, but were very sore put to it for necessaries, and, indeed. for life. I
asked him all the particulars of their voyage, and found they were a. Spanish
chip, bound from the Rio de la Plato to the Revenue, being directed to leave
their leading there. which was chiefly hides and other, and to bring hack
what European goods they could meet with there; that they had five Por-
tuguese seamen on board, whom they took out of another wreck; that five
of their own men were drowned. when first the chip was lost 5 and that those
others moped, through infinite dangers and hazards, and arrived, ulmoet

perfectly useless, for that they had neither powder nor ball, the washing of

their prisoner in New Spain, where an Englishmen was certain to he made
a sacrifice, what necessity or what accident soever brought him thither;
and that I had rather be delivered up to the savages, and be devoured alive,
than fall into the merciless claws of the priests, and be carried into the In-
quisition. I added, that otherwise I was persuaded, if they were all'here,
we might, with so many hands, build a bark large enough to carry us all
away, either to the Brazils, southward, or to the islands, or Spanish coast,
northward; but that if, in requitah they should, when I had put weapons
into their hands, carry me by force among their own people, I might be ill
used for my kindness to them, and make my case worse than it was before.

He answered, with a great deal of eandour and ingennousness, that their
condition wasso miserable and that they were so sensible of it, that, he be-
lieved, they would abhor the thought of using any man unkindly that should
contribute to their deliverance; and that. if I pleased, he would go to them
with the old man, and discourse with them about it, and return again, and
bring me their answer; that he would make conditions with them, upon
their solemn oath, that they should be absolutely under my leading, as their
commander and captain; and that they should swear, upon the holy sacra-
ments and Gospel, to be true to me, and go to such Christian country as
that I should agree to, and no other, and to be directed wholly and abso-
lutely by my orders till they were landed safely in such country as I intended;
and that he would bring a contract from them, under their hands, for that
purpose. Then'he told me he would first swear to me himself that he
would never stir "from me as long as he lived till-I gave him orders; and
that he would take myside to the last .drop of his blood, if ther'e'shonld
happen the least breach of faith among his countrymen. He told me they
were all of them very civil honest men, and they were under the greatest
distress imaginable having neither weapons, nor clothes, nor any food, but
at the mercy and discretion of the savages; out of all hopes of ever returning

to their own country , and that he was sure, if I would undertalte their re. .

lief, they would live and die by me.

Upon these assurances, I resolved to venture to relieve them, if possible,
and to send the old savage and this Spaniard over to them to treat. But,
when we had got all things in readiness to go,.the Spaniard himself started
an objection, which had so much prudence in it on ode hand, and so much
sincerity on the other hand, that I could not but be very well satisfied in it;
and, by his advice, put otf the deliverance of his comrades for at leasthalfa
year. The case was thns:-,--He 'had been with us now about :a~:_month,
during which time I had let him see in what manner I had provided,with the-
asaistance of Providence, for my support; and he saw evidently whatidsek
efcorn and rice I had laid up; which, though it was more-than Inherent
for myself, yet it was not sufiicient, without' good husbandry, for my firmly.m
now it was increased to tour; but much less would it be somcicnt if his coon.
trynieo, who were, as he said, sixteen. still alive. should come over; and,
least of all, would it be suflicient to victuol our vessel, if we should build
one, for a voyage to any of the Christian colonies of America; so he told
me he thought it would be more advisable to let him and the other two dig
and cultivate some more land, as much as I could spare seed to sow. and
that we should wait another harvest, that we might have a supply of corn
{or his countrymen when they should come; for want might be a tempta-
tion to them to disagree, or not to think themselves delivered, otherwise than
out of one difficulty into another. ' You know; says he, 'the children of
Israel. though they rejoiced at first for their being delivered out of Egypt,
yet rebelled even against God himself, that delivered them, when they came
to want bread in the wilderness.'

His caution was so seasonable, and his advice so good. that I could not but
be very well pleased with his proposal, as well as I was satisfied with his
fidelity; so we fell to digging. all four of us. as well as the wooden tools we
were furnished with permitted; and, in about a month's time, by the end of
which it was seed-time, we had got as much, land cured and trimmed up as
we sowed two-aud--twenty bushels of barley on, and sixteen jars of rice;
which was, in short, all the seed we had to spare: nor, indeed,did we leave
ourselves barley sufficient for our own food for the six months that we had.
to expect our crop; that is to say. reckoning from the time we set our seen
aside for sowing; for it is not to be supposed it is six months in the ground
in that country.

Having now society enough, and our number being sufficient to not no
out of fear of the savages, if they had come, unless their number had been
very great, we went freely all over the island, whenever we found occasion;
and as here we had our escape or deliverance upon our thoughts. it was impos--
sible, at least for me, to have the means of it out of mine. Foo-this purpme.
I marked out several trees which I thought lit for our work, and i set Friday
and his father to cutting them down; and then I caused the Spaniard, to
whoa; l imparted my thoughts on that afl'air, to oversee and direct their
work. I shewed them with what indefatigable pains I had hewa a large
tree into single planks. and I caused them to do the like, till they had made
about a dozen large planks of good oak, near two feet broad, thirty-five feet
long, and from two to four inches thick: what prodigious labour it tool: up, .
any one may imagine.

At the same time l contrived to increase my little flock of tame gusts as
much as i could; and, for this purpose, I made Friday and the Spaniard go
out one day, and myself with Friday the next day (for we tool: our toms).
and by this means we got about twenty young kids to breed up with the '
rest; for, whenever we shot the dam, we saved the kids, and added them to
our flock. But, above all, the season for curing the grapes coining no.1
roused such a prodigious quantity to be hung up in the sun, that, I believe.
had we been at Alicant, where the raisins oftbe son are cared, we could
have tilled sixty or eighty barrels; 834 these. with our bread, were a great

n"
part ofour food; and very good livIng too, I assure you, for they are exceed-
ingly nourishing.

It was now harvest, and our crop in good order: It was not the most
plentiful increase I had seen in the island, but, however, it was enough to
answer our end; for, from twenty-two bushels of barley, we brought in and
threshed out above two hundred and twenty bushels, and the like in proper-
tion of the rice; which was store enough for our food to the next harvest,
though all the sixteen Spaniards had been on shore with me; or, if we had
been ready for a voyage, it would very plentifully have victnalled our ship to
have carried us to any part of the world, that is to say. any part ofAmertc'a.
When we had thus housed and secured our magazine of corn, we fell to
work to make more wicker-ware. viz, great baskets, in which we kept it;
and the Spaniard was very handy and dexterous at this part, and oflea
blamed me that I did not make some things for defence of this kind of work;
but I saw no need of it.

And now, having a full supply of food for all the guests I expected, I gave
the Spaniard leave to go over to the main, to see what he could do with
those he had left behind him there. I gave him a strict charge not to bring
any man with him who would not first swear, in the presence of himself and
the old savage, that he would no way injure, fight with, or attack, the person
he should find in the island, who was so kind as to send for them in order
to their deliverance; but that they would stand by him, and defend him
against all such attempts, and, wherever they went, would be entirely under
and subjected to his command; and that this should be put in writing, and
signed with their hands. How they were to have done this, when I knew-
they had neither pen nor ink. was a question which we never asked.
Under thae instructions, the Spaniard and the old savage, the father of
Friday, went away in one of the canoes which they might be said to come
in, or rather were brought in, when they came as prisoners to be devoured.
by the savages. I gave each of them a musket, with a tirelock on it, and
about eight charges of powder and ball, advising them to be very good
husbands of both, and not to use either of them but upon urgent occasions.

This was a cheerful work, being the first measure used by me, in view
of my deliverance, for now twenty-seven years and some days. I gave them.
provisions of bread, and of dried grapes, suficient for themselves for many
days, and sufficient for all the Spaniards for about eight days' time; and..-
wishing them a good voyage, I saw them go ; agreeing with them about a.
signal they'should hang out at their return, by which I should know them
again, when they came back, at a distance, before they came on shore..-
They went away with a fair gale, on the day that the moon was at full, by my..
account in the month of October; but as for an exact mkoning of days,
after I had once lost it, I could never recover it agam , ngr had I kept even
the number of years so pnnctnally as to be sure I was right; though, as it
proved when I afterwards examined my account, I found I had kept a true
reckoning of years.

It was no le- than eight days 1 had waited for them, when a strange and

r".-160 THE use an amen-vans

unforeseen accident intervened, of which the like has not, perhaps, been
heard of in history. I was fast asleep in my hutch one morning, when my
man Friday came running in to me, and called aloud, ' Master, master, they
are come, they are come!' I jumped up, and, regardless of danger, I wen:
out, as soon as I could get my clothes on, through my little grove, which, by
the way, was by this time. grown to be a very thick wood; I say, regardless
of danger, I went without my arms, which was not my custom to do: but I
was surprised, when, turning my eyes to the sea, I presently saw a boat, at
about a league and a half distance, standing in for the shore, with a shoul-
der-of-mutton sail, as they call it, and the wind blowing pretty fair to bring
them in: also I observed presently that they did not come from that side
which the shore lay on, but from the southernmost end of the island.
Upon this, I called Friday in, and bade him lie close, for these were not the
people we looked for, and that we might not know yet whether they were
friends or enemies. In the next place, I went in to fetch my perspective
glass, to see what 1 could make of them; and, having taken the ladder out,
I climbed up to the top of the hill, as I used to do when I was apprehensive
of any thing, and to take my View the plainer, without being discovered. I
had scarce set my foot upon the hill, when my eye plainly discovered a
ship lying at an anchor, at about two leagues and a half distance from me,
S. S. 15., but not above a league and a half from the shore. By my obser-
vation, it appeared plainly to be an English ship, and the boat appeared to
be an English long-boat.

I cannot express the confusion I was in ; though the joy of seeing a ship,
and one that I had reason to believe was manned by my own countrymen,
and consequently fficnds, was such as I cannot describe; but yet I had some
secret doubts hung abom me, I cannot tell from whence they came, bidding
me keep upon my guard. In the first place, it occurred to me to consider
what business an English ship could have in that part of the world, since it
was not the way to or from any part of the world where the English had
any traffic; and I knew there had been no storms to drive them in there, as
in distress; and that, if they were really English, it was most probable that
they were here upon no good design; and that [had better continue as I
was than fall into the hands of thieves and murderers.

Let no man despise the secret hints and notices of danger, which some-
times are given him when he may think there is no possibility of its being
real. That such hints and notices are given us, I believe few that have made
any observations of things can deny ; that they are certain discoveries of an
invisible world, and a converse of spirits, we cannot doubt; and it' the tend-
ency of them seems to be to warn us of danger, why should we not sup-
pose they are from some friendly agent (whether supreme, or inferior and
subordinate, is not the question), and that they are given for our good 2

The present question abundantly confirms me in the justice of this reason-
ing; for, had I not been made cautious by this secret admonition, come it
from whence it will, I had been undone inevitably, and in a thr worse con-
dition than before, as you will see presently. I had not kept myself long in
this posture, but I saw the boat draw near the shore, as it' they looked (hr
a creek to thrust in at, for the convenience of landing; however, as they
did not come quite far enough, they did not see the little inlet where l for~
merly landed my rails, but run their boat on shore upon the beach, at about
half a mile from me, which was very happy tbr me: {or otherwise they
would have landed just at my door, as 1 may say, and would soon have beaten
me out of my castle, and perhaps have plundered me of all I had. \Vhen
they were on shore, I was fully satisfied they Were Englishmen, at least most
of them; one or two I thought were Dutch, but it did not prove so; there
were in all eleven men, whereof three of them I found were unarmed, and,
as I thought, bound; and when the first four or five of them were jumped
on shore, they took those three out orthe boat, as prisoners: one of the
three I could perceive using the most passionate gestures of entreaty. ethic.
lion. and despair, even to a kind of extravagance; the other two, 1 could
perceive, lifted up their hands sometimes, and appeared concerned, indeed,
but not to such a degree as the first. 4 was perfectly conthunded at the
sight, and knew not what the meaning of it should be. Friday called out to
me in English, as well as he could, '0 master! you see English mans cat
prisoner as well as savage mans.'--' Why, Friday,' says I, ' do you think they
are going to eat them then t"----' Yes,' says Friday, ' they will cut drern.'---' No.
no,' says I, 'Fridny; I am afraid they will murder them, indeed, but you may
he sure they will not eat them.'

All this while I had no thought of what the matter really was, but stood
trembling with the horror of the sight, expecting every moment when the
three prisoners should be killed; nay, once I saw one of the villains hit up
his arm with a great cutlass, as the seamen call it, or sword, to strike one of
the poor men; and I expected to see him fall every. moment; at which all
the blood in my body seemed to run chill in my veins. I wished heartily
now for my Spaniard, and the savage that was gone with him, or that I had
any way to have come undiscovered within shot of them, that 1 might have
rescued the three men, for I saw no fire~arlns they had among them; but
it fell out to my mind another way. After 1 had observed the outrageous
usage of the three men by the insolent seamen, I observed the fellows run
scattering about the island, as if they wanted to see the country. I observed
that the three other men had liberty to go also where they pleased; but they
sat down all three upon the ground, very pensive, and looked like men in
despair. This put me in mind of the first time when I came on shore, and
began to look about me; how I gave myself over for lost; how wildly I-
looked round me; what dreadful apprehensions I had; and how I lodged in
the tree all night, {or that ofbemg devoured by wild beasts. As I knew
nothing, that night, of the supply I was to receive by the providential
driving of the ship nearer the land by the storms and tide, by which I have
since been solong nourished and supported; so these three poor desolate.
men knew nothing how certain of deliverance and supply they were, her.

desperate. So little do we see before us in the world, and so much reason
have we to depend cheerfully upon the great Maker of the world, that he
does not leave his creatures so absolutely destitute, but that, in the worst
circumstances, they have always something to be thankful for, and some-
times are nearer their deliverance than they imagine; nay, are even brought
to their deliverance by the means by which they seem to be brought to their
destruction.

It was just at the top of high water when these people came on shore; and,
partly while they rambled about to see what kind of a place they were in,
they had carelessly staid till the tide was spent, and the water was cbbed
considerably away, leaving the boat aground. They had left two men in
the boat, who, as I found afterwards, having dranka little too much brandy,
fell asleep; however, one of them waking a little sooner than the other, and
finding the boat too fast aground for him to stir it, halloed out for the rest,
who were straggling about: upon which they all soon came to the boat
but it was past all their strength to launch her, the boat being very heavy,
and the shore on that side being a soft oozy sand, almost like a quick-sand.
In this condition, like true seamen, who are perhaps the least of all mankind
given to forethought, they gave it over, and away they strolled about the
country again; and l heard one of them say aloud to another, calling them
off from the boat, ' Why, let her alone, Jack, can't you? she'll float next
tide :' by which I was fully confirmed in the main inquiry of what country-
men they were. All this while I kept myself very close, not once daring to
stir out of my castle, any farther than to my place of observation, near the
top of the hill; and very glad I was to think how well it was fortified. I
knew it was no less than ten hours before the boat could float again, and by
that time it would be dark, and I might be _at more liberty to see their
motions, and to hear their discourse, if they had any. In the mean time I
fitted myself up for a battle, as before, though with more caution, knowing
I had to do with another kind of enemy than I had at first. I ordered Fri-
day also, whom Iliad made an excellent marksman with his gun, to load
himself with arms. I took myself two fowling-pieceS, and I gave him three
muskels. My figure, indeed, was very fierce: [had my formidable goat--
skin coat on, with the great cap I have mentioned, a naked sword by In I
side, two pistols in my belt, and a gun upon each shoulder.

It was my design, as 1 said above, not to have made any attempt till it
was dark: but about two o'clock, being the heat of the day, I found that, in
short, they were all gone straggling into the woods, and, as I thought, laid
down to sleep. The three poor distressed men, too anxious for their con-
dition to get any sleep, were, however, sat down under the shelter of a great
tree, at about a quarter of a mile from me, and, as I thought, out of sight of
any of the rest. Upon this I resolved to discover myself to them, and learn
something of their condition; immediately I marched in the figure as above,
my man Friday at a good distance behind me, as formidable for his arms as
I, but not making quite so staring a spectre-like figure as I did. I came as
near them undiscovered as I could, and then, before any of them saw me, I
called aloud to them, in Spanish, ' What are ye, gentlemen? They started
up at the noise; but were ten times more confounded when they saw me,
and the uncouth figure that I made. They made no answer at all, but I
thought 1 perceived them just going to fly from me, when I spoke to them
in English: ' Gentlemen,' said l, 'do not be surprised at me; perhaps you may
have a friend near, when you did not expect it.'--' He 'must be sent directly
from Heaven then,' said one of them very gravely to me, and pulling off his
hat at the same time to me; ' for our condition is past the help of man.'---' A).
help is from Heaven, sir,' said I: ' But can you put a stranger in the war
how to help you? for you seem to be in some great distress. Isaw ya:
when you landed; and, when you seemed to make application to the brutes
that came with you, I saw one of them lill: up his sword to kill you.'

The poor man, with tears running down his thee, and trembling, looking
like One astonished, returned, 'Am I talking to God or man? Is it a real
man oran angel ?'---' Be in no fear about that, sir,' said I ; ' if God had sent an
angel to relieve you, he would have come better clothed, and armed after
another manner than you see me: pray lay aside your fears; I am a man,
an Englishman, and disposed to assist you: you see I have one servant only

dercrs are so near us; but, in short, sir, I was commander of that ship; my
men have nlutinied against me; they have been hardly prevailed on not to
murder me; and at last have set me on shore in this desolate place, with
these two men with me, one my mate, the other a passenger, where we
expected to perish, believing the place to he uninhabited, and know not yet
what to think of it.'--' Where are these brutes, your enemies ?' said I: 'do
you know where they are gone ?'---' There they lie, sir,' said he, pointing toa
thicket of trees; 'my heart trembles for fear they have seen us, and heard
you speak; if they have, they will certainly murder us all.'--' Have they any v
tire-arms 1" said I. He answered they had only two pieces, one of which
they left in theth ' Well then,' said I, 'leave the rest to me: I see they
are all asleep, it is an easy thing to kill them all: but shall we rather take
then: prisoners t' He told me there were two desperate villains among them,
that it was scarce safe to shew any mercy to; but if they were secured, he
believed all the rest would return to their duty. I asked him which they
were. He told me he could not at that distance distinguish them, but he
would obey my orders in any thingl would direct. ' Well,' says l, 'let us re-
treat out of their view or hearing, lest they awake. and we will resolve
further.' So they willingly went back with mg till the woods covered us
from them.

' Look you, sir,' said I, 'if I venture upon your deliverance, are you willing
to make two conditions with me ?' He anticipated my proposals, by telling
me that both he and the ship, if recovered, should:be wholly directed and
commanded by me in every thing; and, if the ship was not, recovered, he
would live and die' with me in what part of the - world soever I would send
him; 'snd the two Other men said the same. - 'Well,' says I, ' my conditions164 'rna urn AND saves-runs

are but two: First, that, while you stay in this island with ing'you will to:
pretend to any authority here; and, if I put arms in your hands, you will,
upon all occasions, give them up to me, and do no prejudice to me or mine-
upon this island; and," m the mean time, be governed by my orders: Secondly,
that if the ship' is, or may be recovered, you will carry me and my man to
England, pamgefree.'

He gave me all the assurances that the invention or faith of man could
devise that he would comply with thus most reasonable demands; and, be.
sides,'would owe his life to me, and acknowledge it upon all occasions, as
long as he lived. ' Well then,' said I, 'here are three musketa for you, with
powder and ball; tell me next what you think is proper to be done.' He
shewed all the testimonies of his gratitude that he was able, but ofi'ered to
be wholly guided by me. I told him I thought it was hard venturing any
thing; but the best method 1 could think of was to fire upon them at once,
as they lay; and if any were not killed at the first volley, and ofi'ered to sub-
mit, we might save them, and so put it wholly upon God's providence to
direct the shot. He said, very modestly, that he was loth to kill them, if
he could help it; but that those two were incorrigible villains, and had been
the authors of all the mutiny in the ship; and, if they escaped, we should be
undone still; for they would go on boardand bring the whole ship's company,
and destroy us all. ' Well then,' says I, 'necessity legitimtes my advice, for
t is the only way to save our liva.' However, seeing him still cautious of
shedding blood, I told him they should go themselves and manage as they
found convenient.

in the middle of this discourse we heard some of them awake, and soon afier
we saw two of them on their feet. I asked him if either of them were the
beans 0 the mutiny. He said 'No.' ' Well then,' said I, ' you may let them
escape ; and Providence seems to have awakened them on purpoae to save
themselies. Now,' says I, 'if the rest escape you, it is your fault.' Animated
with this, he took the musket I had given him in his hand, and a pistol in
his belt, and his two comrades with him, with each a piece in his hand. 'The

.. two men who were with him, going first, made some noise, at which one of
the seamen who was awake turned about, and, seeing them coming, cried
out to the rest; but it was too late than, for the moment he cried out they
fired; I mean the two men, the captain wisely reserving his own piece.
They had so well aimed their shot at the men they knew, that one of them
was killed on the spot, and the other very much wounded; but, not being
dead, he started up on his feet, and called eagerly for help to the other; but
the captain, stepping to him, told him it was toodate to cry for help, he
should call upon God to forgive his villany; and with that word knocked

ti'om whence they came. They gave him all the protestations of their sIuI-
eerity that could be desired, and he was willing to believe them, and spare
their lives, which I was not against, only that I obliged him to keep_ them
bound hand and- foot while they were on the island.

While this was doing, I sent Friday with the captain's mate to the boat,
with orders to secure her, and bring away the oars and sails, which they.
did : and by and by three straggllng men, that were (happily forthem) parted
from the test, came back upon hearing the guns tired, and seeing the captanx'
who before was their prlsoner, now their conqueror, they submitted to be
bound also, and so our victory was complete. '

It now remained that the captain and I should inquire into one another's
circumstances: I began first, and told him my whole history, which .he
heard with an attention, even to amazement; and particularly at the won-
derfal manner of my being furnished with provisions and ammunition; and,

indeed, as my story is a whole collection of wonders, it afl'ected him deeply; '

But when be reflected from thence upon himself, and how I seemed to have
been preserved there on purpose to save his life, the tears ran down his face;
and he could not speak a word more. After this communication was atan
end, I carried him and his two men into my apartment, leading them in
just where I came out, viz, at the top of the house, where I refreshed them
with such provisions as I had, and shewed them all the coutrivauces I had
made, during my long, long inhabiting that place.

All I shewed them, all I said to them, was perfectly amazing; but, above
all, the captain admired my fortification, and how perfectly I had concealed
my retreat with a grove of trees, which, having been now planted near
twenty years, and the trees growing much faster than in England, was be-

this, I told him the first thing we had to do was to stave the boat, which lay
upon the beach, so that they might not carry her OE: and, taking every thing
out of her, leave her so far useless as not to be fit to swim: accordingly we
went on board, took the arms, which were left on board, out of her, and
whatever else we found there, which was a bottle of brandy, and another of
rum, a few biscuit-cakes, a horn of powder, and a great lump of sugar in a
piece of canvas (the sugar was five or six pounds); all which was very wel-
c0me to me, especially the brandy and sugar, of which I had none left for
many years. .

4 When we had earned all these things on share (the oars, mast, sail, and
rudder of the boat, were carried away before, as above), we knoelted a great
hole in her bottom, that, if they had come strong enough to master us, yet
they could not carry 03 the boat. Indeed, it was not much in my thoughts
that we could be able to recover the ship; but my view was, that, if they
went away without the boat, I did not much question to make her fit again
to carry us to the Leeward Islands, and call upon our friends the Spaniards
in my way; for I had them still in my thoughts.

While we were thus preparing our designs, and had first, by main strength.
heaved the boat upon the beach so high that the tide would not float her otl'
at high-water mark, and besides, had broke a hole in her bottom too big to
be quickly stOpped, and were set down musing what we should do, we heard
the ship fire a gun, and saw her make a wait with her ensign as a signal for
the boat to come on board: but no boat stirred; and they fired several times,
making other signals for the boat. At last, when all their signals and firing
proved fruitless, and they found the boat did not stir, we saw them, by the
help of my glasses, hoist another boat out, and row towards the shore; and
we found, as they approached, that there were no less than ten men in her,
and that they had fire-arms with them.

As the ship lay almost two leagues from the shore, we had a full view of
them as they came, and a plain sight even of their faces; because the tide
having set them a little to the east of the other boat, they rowed up under'
shore, to come to the same place where the other had landed, and where the
boat lay: by this means, I say, we had a full view of them, and the captain
knew the persons and characters of all the men in the boat, of whom, he said,
there were three very honest fellows, who, be was sure, were led into this
conspiracy by the rest, being overpowered and frightened; but that as for
the boatswain, who, it seems, was the chief officer among them, and all the
rest, they were as outrageous as any of the ship's crew, and were, no doubt,
made desperate in their new enterprise; and terribly apprehensive he was
that they would be too powerful for us.- I smiled at him, and told him that
men in our circumstances were past the operation of fear; that, seeing almost
every condition that could be was better than that which we were supposed
to be in, we ought to expect that the consequence, whether death or life,
would be sure to be a deliverance. I asked him what he thought of the cir-
cumstances of my life, and whether a deliverance were not worth venturing
for? "And where, sir,' said I, ' is your belief of my bemg preserved here On
purpose to save your life, which elevated you a little while ago; for my part,
said}, 'there seems to me but one thing amiss in all the prospect of it.'
' What is that? says he.' Why,' said I, ' it Is, that as you say there are three
or four honest fellows among them, which should be spared, had they been,
all of the wicked part of the crew I should have thought God's providence
had singled them out to deliver them into yourhands; for, depend upon it,
every man that comes ashore are our own, and shall die or live as they
behave to us.' As I spoke this with a raised voice and cheerful countenance,'
_I found it greatly encouraged him; so we set vigorously to our business.
We had, upon the first appearance of the boat's coming from the ship,
considered of separating our prisoners; and we had, indeed, secured them
efi'ectually. Two of them, of whom the captain was less assured than or-
dinary, I sent with Friday, and one of the tlIree'delivered men to my cave,
where they were remote enough, and out of danger of being heard or dis-.
covered, or of finding their way out of the woods if they could have delivered
themselves: here they led them bound, but gave them provisions; and pro-
mised them, if they continued there quietly. to give them their liberty in-a
day or two; but that, if they attempted their escape, they should be put to
death without mercy. They promised faithfully to bear their confinement
with patience, and were very thankful that they had such good usage as to
have provisions and light left them; for Friday gave them candles (such as
we made ourselves) for their comfort; and they did not know but that he
stood sentinel over them at the entrance. .
The other prisoners had better usage: two of them were lrept pinioned,
indeed, because the captain was not free to trust them; but the other two
were taken into my service, upon the captain's recommendation, and upon
their solemnly engaging to live and die with us; so with them, and the three
honest men, we were seven men well armed; and I made no doubt we should
be able to deal well enough with the ten that were coming, considering that
the captain had said there were three or four honest men among them also.
As soon as they got to the place where their other boat lay, they ran their
boat into the beach, and came all on shore, hauling the boat up sfier them,
which I was glad to see; for I was afraid 'they would rather have left the
boat at an anchor, some distance from the shore, with some hands in.her,'to
guard her, and so we should not be able to seize the boat. Being on shore,
the first thing they did, they ran all to their other boat; and it was easy to
see they were under a great surprise to find her stripped, as above, of all that
was in her, and a great hole in her bottom. Alter they had mused awhile
upon this, they set up two or three great shouts, halloing with all their
might, to try if they could make their companions hear; but all was to no
purpose: then they came all close In a ring, and fired a volley oftheir small,>>
arms, which, indeed, we heard, and the echoes made the woods ring: but it>>
wasallone; thoseinthecavewewere sure could not hear, andthose in our
keeping, though they heard it well enough, yet durst give no answer- -to~.the_m:168 - me am: sun anveurvnns

They weresoastontshed at the surprise of this, that. as they told us afterwards,
they resolved to go all on board again to their ship. and let them know that
the men were all murdered. and the long~boat stared: accordingly, they ira-
mcdietely launched their boat againtaod got all of them on board.

The captain was terribly amazed, and even confounded, at this, bettering
they would go on board the ship again, and set sail, giving their comrades
over for lost. and so he should still lose the ship, which he was in hopes we
should have recovered; but he was quickly as much Mghtened the
other way.

They had not been long put off with the host, but we perceived them all
coming on shore again; but with this new measure in their conduct. which
it seems they consulted together upon, viz, to leave three men in the host,
and the rest to go on shore, and go up into the country to look for their
follows This was a great disappointment to us, for now we were at a loss
what to do; as our seizing those seven men on shore would. be no advantage
to us, it' we let the boat escape; because they would then row away to the
ship, and then the rest of them would he sure to weigh and set sail, and so
our recovering the ship would be lost. However. we had no remedy but to
wait and see what the issue of things might present. The seven men came
on shore, and the three who remained in the host put her off to a good
distance from the shore, and came to an anchor to wait tbr them; so that it
was impossible {or us to come at them in the boat. Thom that come on,
shore kept close together, marching towards the top of the little hill under
which my habitation lay; and we could see them plainly, though they could
not perceive us. We could have been very glad they would have come nearer
to us, so that we might have fired at them; or that they would have gone farther
ott', that we might have come abroad. But when they were cometothe
hm of the hill, where they could see a great way into the valleys and
woods, which lay towards the northeast part. and where the island lay
lowest, they shouted and hulloed till they were weary; and not caring. it
seems, to venture far from the shore, nor for floor one another. they sat down
together under a tree, to consider ol' it. Had they thought tit to have gone
to sleep there, as the other part of them had done, they had done the job tor
us; but they were too full at swrehensions ot' danger to venture to go to
sleep, though they could not tell what the danger was they had to fear
neither.

The captain made a very just propoml to me upon this consultation of
theirs, viz. that perhaps they would all the a volley again. to endeavour to
mire their fellows hear, and that we should all sally upon them, just at the
juncture when their pieces were all discharged, and they would certainly
yield, and we should have them without bloodshed. I liked this proposal,
provided it was done while we were near enough to come up to them before
they could load their pieces again. But this erent did not happen; and we
lay still a long time, very irresotute what course to take. At length I told
them there would be nothing done, in my opinion. till night; and then. it
they did not return to the boat, perhaps we might and a way to get betweens '.\.

could not reach back to the boat before it was dark; and, indeed. they were
heartily tired themselves also by the time they came back to us.

We had nothing now to do but to watch for them in the dark, and to la!
upon them, so as to make sure work with them. It was several hours alter
Friday came back to me before they came back to their boat; and we could
hear the foremost of them, long before they came quite up, calling to those
behind to come along; and could also hear them answer, and complain how
lame and tired they were, and not able to come any faster; which was very
welcome news to us. At length they came up to the boat: but it is im-
possible to express their contusion when they found the boat fast aground in
the creek, the tide ebbcd out, and their two men gone. W e could hear them
call to one another In a most lamentable manner, telling one another they
were got into an enchanted island; that either there were inhabitants in it,
and they should all be murdered, or else there were devils and spirits in it,
and they should be all carried away and devoured. They halloed again, and
called their two comrades by their names a great many times; but no an-
swer. Alter some time, we could see them, by the little light there was, run
about, wringing their hands like men in despair; and that sometimes they
would go and sit down in the boat, to rest themselves; then come ashore
again, and walk about again, and so the same thing over again. My men
would l'ain have had me give them leave to fall upon them at once in the
dark; but I was willing to take them at some advantage, so to spare them,
and kill as few of them as I could; and especially I was unwilling to hazard the
killing any of our men, knowing the others were very well armed. I re-
solved to wait, to see if they did not separate; and, therefore, to make sure
of them, I drew my ambuseade nearer, and ordered Friday and the captain
to creep upon their hands and feet, as close to the ground as they could, that
they might not be discovered, and get as near them as they could possibly
before they oll'ered to fire.

They had not been long in that posture, when the boatswain, who was the
principal ringleader of the mutiny, and had now shewn himself the most de-
jected and dispirited of all the rest, came walking towards them, with two
more of the crew : the captain Was so eager at having this principal rogue so
much in his power, that he could hardly have patience to let him come so
near as to be sure of him, for they only heard his tongue before: but, when
they came nearer, the captain and Friday, starting up on their feet, let fly at
them. The boatswain was killed upon the spot; the next man was shot into
the body,and fell just by him, though he did not die till an hour or two after
and the third ran for it. At the noise of the fire, I immediately advanced
witltmy whole army, which was now eight men, viz., myself, generalissimo;
Friday, my lieutenant-general; the captain and his two men, and the three
prisoners of war, whom we had trusted with arms. We came upon them,
Indeed, in the dark, so that they could not see our number; and I made the
man they had let! in the boat, who was now one of us, to call them by name,
to try if I could bring them to a parley, and so might perhaps reduce them
to terms; which fell out just as we desired: for, indeed. it was easy to think.
as their condition then was, they would be very willing to espitulate. So
he calls out, as loud as he could, to one of them, 'Tom Smith! Tom Smith 1'
Tom Smith answered immdiately, ' ls that Robinson t' for, it seems, he knew
the voice. The other answered, 'Aye, aye; for God's sake, Tom Smith,
throw down your arms and yield, or you are all dead men this moment}--
' Who must we yield tot Where are they l' says Smith again. 'Here they
are.' says he; ' here's our captain, and fifty men with him, have been hunt-
ing you these two hours: the boatswain is killed; Will Fry is wounded; and
I am a prisoner; and, it' you do not yield, you are all lost.'---' Will they give
us quarter, then?' says Tom Smith, ' and we will yield.'--'I will go and ask,
if you promise to yield,' says Robinson; so he asked the captain; and the
captain himself then calls out, ' You, Smith, you know my voice; it' you lay
down your arms immediately, and submit, you shall have your lives, all but
Will Atkins.'

Upon this Will Atkins cried out, ' For God's sake, captain, give me
quarter: what have i done? They have all been a>> bad as I:' which, by
the way, was not true neither; for it seems this Will Atkins was the first
man that laid hold of the captain when they first mutinied, and used him
barbarously, in tying his hands, and giving him injurious language. How-
ever, the captain told him he must lay down his arms at discretion, and
trust to the governor's mercy; by which he meant me, for they all called
me governor. In a word, they all laid down their arms, and begged their
lives; and I sent the man that had parleyed with them, and two more, who
hound them all; and then my great army of fifty men, which, particularly
with those three, were in all but eight, came up and seized upon them, and
upon their boat; only that l kept myself and one more out of sight, for
reasons of state.

Our next work was to repair the boat, and think of seizing the ship: and
as for the captain, now he had leisure to parley with them, he expostnlated
mth them upon the villany of their practices with him, and at length upon
the further wickedness of their design, and how certainly it must bring them
to misery and distress in the end, and, perhaps, to the gallows. They all
appeared very penitent, and begged hard for their lives. As for that, he
told them they were none of his prisoners, but the commander's ot' the island;
that they thought they had set him on shore in a barren uninhabited island;
but it had pleased God so to direct them that it was inhabited, and that
the governor was an Englishman; that he might hang them all there, if he
pleased; but, as he had given them all quarter, he supposed he would send
them to England, to be dealt with there as justice required, except Atkins,
whom he was commanded by the governor to advise to prepare for death,
for that he would be hanged in the morning.

Though this was all but a fiction of his own, yet it had its desired efi'ect:
Atkins fell upon his knees, to beg the captain to intercede with the gover-
nor for his life; and Qltthe rest begged of him, for God's sake, that they

To thew, in the morning, i sent the captain, who was to enter into a
pnriey with them: in a word, to try them, and tell me whether he thought
they might be trusted or no to go on board and surprise the ship. He talked
to them of the injury done him; of the condition they were brought to;
and that, though the governor had given them quarter for their lives as to
the present action. yet that, it' they were sent to Enghmd, they would all he

Any one may gum how readin such a proposal wouid be accepted by

promised. With the deepest impreeatiom, that they wouid be fitiththl to him

I asked the captain if he was willing to venture with these-hands on' board
the ship; but, as- for me and my man Friday, I did not think it was proper
for Its-to stir, having seven men lea behind ;' and it was employment enough
for us to keep them asunder, and supply them with victuais. As' to the five
in the cave, I resolved to keep them fast, but Friday went in twice a day to
them to supply them with necessaries, and I made the other two carry
provision to a certain distance, where Friday was to take it.

When I shewed myself to the tiro hostages, it was with the captain, who
told them I was the person- the governor had ordered to loolr alter them,
and that it was the -governer's pleasure they should" not stir any wherebut
by my direction; that, if they did,' they would he fetched 'into 'the castle,

nor, I now appeared as another person, and' spoke of the go'vern'or, the gar-

rison, the castle, and the like, upon all occasions.

The captain now had no difficulty before him but to furnish his two bb'eti,'

being very. faithfully seconded by their men: they seciared all the rest that
were upon the main and quarter decks, and began to fasten the hatches',' to
keep them down that were below; when the" other lioa't and their" men, en~
tering at the fore-chains, secured the foreca'stle of the ship, and the Me

never spoke a word more: upon which the rest yielded. and the ship was
taken efi'ectually, without any more lives lost.

As soon as the ship was thus secured, the captain ordered seven guns to
be fired, which was the signal agreed upon with me to give me notice of hi
success, which you may be sure I was very glad to hear, having sat watching
upon the shore for it till near two o'clock in the morning. Having thus
heard the signal plainly, I 3an me down; and, it having been a day ofgreat
fatigue to me. I slept very sound, till I was something surprised 'with the
noise of a gun; and presently, starting PS19,! heard a man call me by the
name of'Governor! Governor? and presently i knew the captain's voice;
when, climbing to the top of the hill, there he stood, and. pointing to the
ship, he embraced we in his arms. ' M y dear friend and delirerer,' says he,
' there's your ship, for she is all yours, and so are we, and all that belong to
her.' I cast my eyes to the ship. and there she rode within little more than
half a mile of the shore, for they had weighed her anchor as soon as they
were masters of her, and, the weather being fair, had brought her to an an-
chor just against the mouth of the little creek; and, the tide being up, the
captain had brought the piunace in near the place where I at first landed my
rails, and so landed just at my door. I was at first ready to sink down with
the surprise; for I saw my deliverance, indeed, visibly put into my hands, all
things easy. and a large ship just ready to carry me away whither I pleased
to go. At first, for some time, I was not able to answer him one word; but,
as he had taken me in his arms. I hold fast by him, or I should have when,
to the ground. He perceived the surprise, and immediately pullsa bottleout of
his pocket, and gave me a dram ot' cordial. which he had brought on purpose
for me. After 1 had drank it, I sat down upon the ground; and. tlsotlgh it
brought me to myself, yet it was a good while before I could speak a word
to him. All this time, the poor man was in as great an ecstasy as 1, only
not under any surprise, as! was; and he said a thousand kind and tender
things to me. to compose and bring me to myself: but such was the hood 0!
joy in my breast, that it put all my spirits into confusion: at last it broke
out into tears; and, in a littie while alter, l recovered my speech. {then
took my turn, and embraced him as my deliverer. and we rejoiced together.
I told him I looked upon him as a man sent from Heaven to deliver me, and
that the whole transaction seemed to be a chairs of wonders; that such
things as these were the testimonies we had of a secret hand of Providence
governing the world, and an evidence that the eye at an infinite Power
could search into the remotest corner of the world. and send help to the
miserable whenever he pleased. I forgot not to lift up my heart in thank-
thlness to Heaven; and what heart could forbear to bless Him, who had not
only in a miraculous manner provided for me in such a wilderness, and In
such a desolate condition. but from whom every deliverance must always be
acknowledged to proceed t - ' -

make it their own request that he should leave them upon the island. ' I
ehould be very glad of that,' rays the captain, ' with ell my heart." Well;

and how they had run away with the ship, and were preparing to commit

I let them know that by my direction the ship had been eeized; that she

However, the tlpttlltl seemed to make some difficulty of it, no if he dam
not lease them thew. Upon this, I seemed a little angry with the captain,
and told him that they were my prisoners, not his; and that, seeing that!
offered them so much favour, I would be as good as my word; and that if
he did not think fit to consent to it I would set them at liberty, not found
them; and, if he did not like it, he might take them again if heeould catch

keep all right in the ship. and send the hoot on shore next day for me;

hanged at the yard-arm, that these men might nee him. 4 . -

When the captain was gone, I sent for the men up to me to my apart-
meat, and entered seriously into discourse with them on their droumtanou.
I told them I thought they had made a right choice; that, it the captain had

made them promise to treat them in common with themselves. llero it
may be noted. that thehenptoin had ink on board, who was greatly surprised
that I never hit upon a \vsy of making ink or charcoal sud water. or of
something else, as i had done things much more difficult.

I loll them my tire-arms, vie, five mnskctr, three {owling~pinoos, and three
swords. I had above it barrel and n half of powder on; for, alter the first
year or twa, I used but little. and wasted none. I gave them e description
of the way I managed the gents, and directions to mill: and fatten them, and
to make both batter and cheese: in a word, I gave them every part of any
own story; end told them I should prevail with the captain to leave them
two barrels of gunpowder more. sod some garden-seeds, which I told them
I would have been very glad of: also I gave them the bag of peas which
the captain had brought me to eat. snd bade them be sure to sow and in<<
crease thorn.

Having done all this, Heft them the next day. and went on hood the
ship. We prepared immediately to soil, hut did not weigh that night. The
next morning early, two of the five men came swimming to the ship's side,
and, making a most lamentable complaint of the other three, begged to be
taken into the ship. for God's sake, for they should be murdered; and begged
the captain to take them on board, though he hanged them immediately.
Upon this the captain pretended to have no power mthout me; but, alter
some didicnlty, and ntler their solemn promxves of gmendment, they were
taken on board, and were some time after soundly whipped and welded '
after which they proved very honest and quiet follows.

Some time otter this the boat was ordered on shore, the tide being up,

were very tliaoltful for. i also enooursged them, by telling them, titan-if 5t

When I tool: leave of this island, I carried on bowl, (or relies, the?
great goat-skin cap I had made, my umbrella. and one of my parrots; also
Iforgot not to take the money I formerly mentioned, which had loin by me
so long useless, that it was grown rusty or tarnished, and could hardly pass
for silver till it had been a little robbed and handled; as also the money I
found to the wreck of the Spanish ship. And um I left the island the 19th
of December, as I found by the ship's account. in the year 1638. otter I had
been upon it eight--snthtwenty years, two months, and nineteen days; being

. delivered from this second captivity the some day of the month that I first
made my escape in the long-boot from among the Moors of Belle. In this
vessel, otter a long voyage, [arrived in England the nth of June. in the
year 1687, having been thirty-five years absent.

I would give her no trouble; but, on the contrary, in gratitude for her
former care and faithfulness to me, 1 relieved her as my. little stock would
atl'ord (which, at that time, would indeed allow me to do but little for her);
but I assured her I would never forget her former kindness to me; nor did I
forget her when l had sutlicient to help her, as shall be observed in its proper
place. I went down afterwards into Yorkshire; but my father was dead,
and my mother and all the family extinct, except that I found two sisters,
and too of the children of one of my brothers; and, as I had been long ago
given over for dead, there had been no provision made for me: so that, in a
word, l found nothing to relieve or assist me; and that the little moncyl
had would not do much for me as to settling in the world.

I met with one piece of gratitude, indeed, which I did not expect; and
this was, that the master of the ship whom I had so happily delivered, and
by the same means saved the ship and cargo, having' given a very handsome
account to the owners of the manner how I had saved the lives of the men
and the ship, they invited me to meet them, and some other merchants con-
cerned, and all together made. me a very handsome compliment upon the
subject, and a present of almost twu hundred pounds sterling.

But after making;r several reflections upon the circumstances of my life,
and how little way this would go towards settling me in the world, I resolved
to go to Lisbon, and see if I might not come by wine information of the
state of my plantation in the llruzils, and of what was become of my partner,
who, I had reason to suppose, had some years past given me over for dead.
Willi this view I took shipping for Lisbon, where I arrived in April fol-
lowing; my man Friday accompanying me very honestly in all these ram-
blings, and provingr a most faithful servant upon all occasions. "'hcu I
came to Lisbon, I found out, by inquiry, and to my particular satisfaction,
my old friend the captain of the ship who first took me. up at sea on" the
shore of Africa. He was now grown old, and had left off going to sea,
having put his son, who was far from a young man, into his ship, and who
still used the Brazil trade. The old man did not know me; and, indeed, I
hardly knew him: but I soon brought him to my remembrance, and as soon
brought myself to his recollection, when I told him who I was.

Alter some passionate expressions of the old acquaintance between us, I
inquired, you may be sore, after my plantation and my partner. The old
man told me he had not been in the Brazils in about nine years; but that
he could assure me, that, when he came away, my partner was living; but
the trustees, whom I had joined with him to take cognizance of my part,
were both dead: that, however, he believed I would have a very good ac-
count. of the improvement of the plantation; for that, upon the general belief
of my being cast away and drowned, my trustees had given in the account
of the produce of my part of the plantation to the procurator-fiscal, who
had appropriated it, in case l never came to claim it, one-third to the king,
and two-thirds to the monastery of St. Augustine, to be expanded for the
benefit of the poor, and for the conversion of the Indians to the Catholic
faith; but that if I upwared, or any one for me, to claim the inheritance, it
would be restored; only that the improvement, or annual production, being
distributed to charitable uses, could not be restored: but he assured me that
the steward of the king's revenue from lands, and the proviedorc, or steward
of the monastery, had taken great care all along that the incumbent, that is
to say, my partner, gave every year a faithful account of the produce, of
which they had duly received my moiety. [asked him if he knew to what
height of improvement he had brought the plantation, and whether he
thought it might be worth looking alter ; or whether, on my going thither,
l should meet with any obstruction to my possessing my just right in the
moiety. lle told me he could not tell exactly to what degree the plantation
was improved; but this he knew, that my partner was grown executing rim
upon the enjoying his part of it ; and that, to the best of his remembrance,
he had heard that the king's third of my part, which was, it seems, granted
away to some other monastery or religious house, amounted to above two
hundred moidoru a year: that as to my being restored to a quiet possession
of it, there was no question to be. made of that, my partner being alive to
witness my title, and my name being also enrolled in the register of the
country: also'hc told me that the survivors of my two trustees were very
fair honest people, and very wealthy; and he believed I would not only
have their assistance for putting me in pomession, but would find a very
considerable sum of money in their hands for my account, being the produce
of the farm while their fathers held the trust, and before it was given up, as
above; which, as be remembered, was for about twelve years.

Ishewed myself a little concerned and uneasy at this account, and in-
quired of the old captain how it came to pass that the trustees should thus
dispose of my effects, when he knew that I had made my will, and had
made him, the Portuguese captain, my universal heir, 8w.

He told me that was true; but that, as there was no proof of my being
dead, he could not act as executor until some certain account should come
of my death; and, besides, he was not willing to intermeddlc with a thing
so remote: that it was true he had registered my will, and put in his claim;
and, could he have given any account of my being dead or alive, he would
have acted by procuratiou, and taken possession of the ingeiao (so they
called the sugar-house), and have given his son, who was now at the Brazils.
orders to do it. ' But,' says the old man, ' I have one piece of news to tell you,
which perhaps may not be so acceptable to you as the rest; and that is.
believing you were lost, and all the world believingso also, your partner
and trustees did offer to account with me, in your name, for six or eight of
the first years' profits, which I received. There being at that time great
disbursements for increasing the works, building an ingeino, and buying
slaves, it did not amount to near so much as afterwards it produced: how-
ever,' says the old man, ' I shall give you a true account of what I have received
in all, and how I have disposed of it.'

After a few days' farther conference with this ancient friend, he brought
me an account of the first six years' income of my plantation. signed by my
partner and the merchant trustees, being always delivered In goods, viz,i8!) Tm: mm; AND AMKNTuus

there were ways enough to secure my right, and immediately to appropriate

acquaintance at the place : and then proposed my staying with him till an
account mole of the return
Never was any thing more honourable than the proceedings upon this
procuration; for in less than seven months l received a large packet from the
survivors of my trustees, the merchants, for whose account 1 went tosea, in
which were the following particular letters and papers enclosed.

First, There was the account-current of the produce of my firm or plan-
tation, from the year when their ththers had balanced with my old Portugal '
captain, being for six years: the balance appeared to he one thousand one
hundred and seventy-four moidores in my fitvour.

Secondly, There was the account of four years more, while they kept the
efl'ects in their hands, before the government claimed the administration, as
being the ell'eets of a person not to be found, which they called civil death;
and the balance of this. the value of the plantation increasing, amounted to
nineteen thousand four hundred and forty-fix crusadoes, being about three
thousand two hundred and forty moidorcs.

'l'hirdly, There was the prior of St. Augustine's account, who had received
the profits for above fourteen years ; but, not being to account for what was
disposed of by the hospital, very honestly declared he had eight hundred
and seventy-two moidores not distributed, which he acknowledged to my
account: as to the king's part, that refunded nothing.

There was a letter of my partner's, congratulating me very affectionately
upon my being alive, giving me an account how the estate was improved,
and what it produced a year; with a particular of the number of squares or
acres that it coatained, how planted, how many slaves there were upon it;
and, making two-and-twenty crow for blessings, told me had said so way
Are Marius to thank the. blessed Virgin that l was alive; inviting me very
passionately to come over and take possession of my own; and, in the mean
gime, to give him orders to whom he should deliver my effects, if I did not
come myself; concluding with a hearty tender of his triendship, and that of
his family; and sent me, as a present, seven fine Ieopards' skins, which he
had. it seems, received from Africa, by some other ship that he had sent
thither, and which, it seems, had made a better voyage than 1. He sent me
also five chests of excellent sweetmeats, and a hundred pieces of gold un-
coined, not quite so large as moidores. By the same fleet my two merchant
trustees shipped me one thousand two hundred chests of sugar, eight hun-
dred rolls of tobacco, and the rest of the whole account in gold.

I might well say-now, indeed, that the latter end of Job was better than
the beginning. It is impossible to express the fluttering: of my very heart
when I found all my wealth about me; for, as the Brazil ships come all in
fleets, the same ships which brought my letters brought my goods; and the
effects were safe in the river before the letters came to my hand. In a word,
I turned pale and grew sick; and, had not the old man run and fetched use a
cordial, I believe the sudden surprise of joy had overset nature, and 1 had
died upon the spot: nay, after that, 1 continued very ill, and was so some
hours, till a physician being sent for, and something of the real cause of my
illness being known, he ordered me to be let blood; alter which I had ro-182 one we no snvnxrunes

given in that manner to the spirits. I would have died.

I was now master, all on a. luddeu. of above the thousand pounds uerling
in money, and had an estate, as] might well call it, in the Breath. debate
a thousand pounds a year, as sure u an estate of land: in England; end, in
a word, I was in a condition which I mm: knew how to understand, or
how to compme myself (or the enjoyment ofit. The first thing I did was to
recompense my original bonolnctor, my good old captoin, who had been flat
charitable to me in my distress, kind to me in my beginning, end honest to
me at the and. I showed him all that was sent to me; I told him, that, next
to the providence of fieaven, which dirpooed all things, it was owing to him;
and that it now lay on me to reward him, which Iwonld do a hnmlredvfold:
no l first returned to him the hundred moidores! had received of him; then
I sent for a notary, and caused him to draw up a general release or discharge
from the four hundred and seventy moidores, which he had acknowledged
he owed me, in the t'ulhot and til-meat manner possible. Ailer which I
mused a procuration to be drawn, empowering him to be my receiver of the
annual profits of my plantation. and appointing my partner to accmmt with
him, and make the rtturm by the mind fleets to him in my name; and a
clause in the cm], being a grant of our hundred moidom a year to him
during his life out of the claw-ts, and any moidoree e year to his son, otter
him, for his life : and that l reguited my old man.

I was now to consider which way to steer my course next, and who: to
do with the estate that Providence had thus put into my hands; and, indeed,
! hsd more care upon my head now than I had in my silent state of life in
the island, where I wanted nothing but what I had. and had nothing but
what l wanted; whereas! had now a great charge upon me. and my bati-
ncsn was how to secure it. i had never a one now to hide my money in,
or a place where it might lie without lock or key, till it grew mouldy and
temistmd before any body would meddle with it: on the contrary, I knew
not where to put it, or whom to trust with it. My old patron, the captain, in-
deed. was honest, and that was the only refuge I had. In the next place, my
mtereor in the Brazil: mated to summon me thither; but now i could not tell
how to think of going thither till i had settled my attain, and left my effects
in some ufe hands behind me. At flat I thought of my old ti'iend the
widow. who I knew was honest, and would he just to me; but then she was
in years, and but poor, and, for ought i knew, might be in debt; to that, m
a word, I had no way but to go back to England myself, and like my
effects with me.

It was some months, however, before I resolved upon this; and therefore,
a I had rewarded the old captain fully. and to his utisfuction, who had been
nixlormer benefactor, so I began to think of my poor widow. whose husband
bod been my first benefactor; and she. while it we: in her poorer, my faithful
steward and inttructor. So, the tint thing I did, I got a merchant in thon

a hundred poundeeach, they being, though not in want. yet not in very good
circumstances; one having been married, and led a widow; and the other
having a husband not so kind to her a he should be. But, among all my
relation. or acquaintances. I could not yet pitch upon one to whom I dun:
commit the grout of my stock. that I might go away to the Brazila. and learn
things safe behind me; and this greatly perplexed me. .

I had once a mind to have gone to the Bruits. and have aettled myself
there; for I was. ea it were, naturalized to the p'aeet but 1 had Ionic little
scruple in my mind about religion. which inacntibly drew me back. How-
ever, it was not religion that kept me from going there for the present; and,
as I had made no temple of being openly ot' the religion of the country all
the while I was among them. to neither did 1 yet; only that. now and then,
having of late thought more of it than formerly, when I began to think of
living and dying among them. l began to regret my having prefer-ed myself
a papixt. and thought it might not be the best religion to die with.

But, as l have said, this was not the main thing that kept me from going
to the Bmzilavhut that really I did not know with whom to leave my efl'eete
behind me; sol resolved, at last, to go to England with them, where, if! or-
rived, I concluded lahould make some acquaintance, or and some relations
that would be faithful to me , and. accordingly. I prepared to go to England

In order to prepare things {or my going home, Ifim. the Brazil Beet being

aired might be given. the hundred to the monastery, and three hundred ind
seventy-two to the poor, an the prior should direct; desiring the good padre'e

occasion for it. Lastly. I wrote to my partner, acknowledging his indattry

the works. giving NIB instructions for his future government of my part.
according to the power: I had left with my old patron. to whom! desired
him to tend whatever become due to me till he should hear from the more

but to nettle myself there for the remainder of my life. To this I added a

besides my man Friday, who was too much a stranger to be capable of sup-
plying the place of a servant on the road.

In this manner i set out from Lisbon; and our company being very well

to call me captain, as well because I was the oldest mm, as txreausr as I had

When we come to Madrid, we, being all of us stranger! to Spain, were
willing to stay some time to see the rourt of Sprain, and to see what was
worth obmrving . but, it being the latter part of the summer, we hastened
<<my, and set out from Madrid about the middle of October; hot, when we
came to the edge of Navarre, we were alarmed, at several towns on the way.

When'we came to Pampcluna itself, we found it so indeed; and to me,
that had been always used' to a hot climate, and to countries where I could
scarce bear any clothes on. the cold was insufferable: nor, indeed, was it
more painful than surprising to come but ten days before out of Old Castile,
where the weather <<(as not only warm. but very hot. and immediately to feel
a wind from the Pyreuean mountains so very keen, so severely cold. as to he
intolerable, and to endanger bennmbing and pcrishing of our lingers and toes.

Poor Friday was really frightened when he suw the mountains all covered
with snow, and felt cold weather, which he had never seen or felt before in
his life. To mend the matter. when we came to anpeluno, it continued
snowing'with so much violence, and so long, that the. people said winter was
come before its time; and the roads, which were difficult before, were now
quite impassable; for. in a word, the snow lay in some places too thick for
us to travel; and being not hurd frozen, as is the case in the northern coun-
tries, there was no going without being in danger of being buried alive every
step. We staid no less than Monty days at Pampelunu; when, seeing the
winter coming on, and no likelihood of its lu-iug better, for it was the Ic~
vcrext winter all over Europe that inn] been known in the memory of men, I
proposed that we should all go away to Fontnmbin, and there take shipping
for Bonniennx, which was a very little voyage. But, while I was considering
this, there came in four French gentlemen, who. having been stopped on the
French side of the wanes, as we were on the Spanish, had found out 3 guide,
who, traversing the country nmr the head of Languedoc, had brought them
over the mountains by such ways, that they were not much incommodetl with
the snow; for, where they met with snow in any quantity. theywaid it was
frozen hard enough to hear them and their horses. We sent for this guide, who
told us he Would undertake to carry us the some way with no hazard from the
snow, provided we were armed sufficiently to protect ourselves from wild
beastnrfor, he said, upon these grout snows it was frequent for some wolves
to shew themselves at the foot of the mountains, being manic ravenousifor
want of food, the ground being covered with snow. We told him we were
well enough prepared {or such creatures as they were, if he "mild insure us
from I kind of two-legged wolves, which, we were told, we were in most
danger from, especially on the French side of the mountains. llc satisfied
us'thet there was no (longer oftlmt kind in the way that we were to go ; so
we readily agreed to follow him, as did also twelve other gentlemen, with
their servants. some French, some Spanish, who, as I said, had attempted to
go, and were obliged to come back again.

Accordingly, we set out from Pumnluno, with our guide, on the Myth of
November; and, indeed, l was surprised, when, instead ol' going forward, he
come directly back with us on the same road that we came from Madrid,
about twenty miles; when, having passed two rivers, and come into the
plain country, we found ourselves in a warm climate again, where the country.
was pleasant, and no snow to be seen; but, on a sudden, turning to his loll,
he approached the mountains another way: and though it is true the hills
and precipice: looked dreadful, yet he made so many tours, Mich meander;

and led us by such whaling ways. that we insensibly passed the height of
the mountains without being nmeh ineumbcred with the snow; and, all on
a sudden, he shewed us the pleasant fruithtl provinces of Lunguedoc and
(laseony, all green and flourishing. though, indeed, at a great distance, and
u e had some rough way to pass still.

We were a little uneasy, however, when we found it snowed one whole
day and a night so fast, that we eould not travel; but he bid as be easy; we
slumhl soon be past it all. We fotnul, indeed. that we began to descent] every
day, mat to enttte more north than before; and so, depending upon our guide.
"0 went on.

It was about two hours before night, when our guide being something
before us, and not just in sight, out rushed three monstrous wolves, and after
them a bear,ont ot'a hollow way adjoining to a thiek wood. 'l'woof the wolves
made at the guide, and, had he been far before as, he would have been de-
voured before we eould have helped him. One of them fastened np'on his
horse, and the other attaelted the limit with that violenee, that he had not
time, or presenee of mind enough, to draw his pistol, but halloed and cried
out to us most lustily. My aunt, Friday, heitu,r next me, I bade him ride up,
and see what was the matter. As soon as Friday eame in sight of the man,
he halloed out as loud as the. other, ' () master! 0 master!' but, like. a hold
fellow, rode direetly up to the poor man, and, with his pistol, shot the wolf
that attaeked him in the head.

It was happy for the poor man that it was my man 1" riday ; for, be having
been used to sueh creatures in his eotmtry, he had no fear upon him, but
went elose up to him and shot hitn, as above; whereas any other of us would
have tired at a farther distauee, and have perhaps either missed the wall', or
eudaug 'red shooting the man.

But it was enough to have territied a holder man than I (and, indeed, it
alarmed all our company), when, with the noise of Friday's pistol, we heard
on both sides the most dismal howling of wolves; and the noise, redoubled
by the echo of the unmntaius, appeared to as as if there had been at prodi-
gious number of them ; and, perhaps, there was not saeh a few as that we
had no eause of apprehensions: however, as Friday had killed this wolf, the
other that had fastened upon the horse tell him immediately, and fled, Without
doing him any damage. having happily fastened upon his head, where the
homes of the bridle had stuek in his teeth. But the man was most hurt; for
the raging ereatnre had hit him twice; once in the arm, and the other time
a little above his knee; and, though he had made. some defence, he was just
as it were tumbling down by the disorder of his horse, when Friday came
up and shot the wolf.

It is easy to suppose that at the noise of Friday's pistol we all mended our
pace, and rode up as fast as the way. which was very diflieult, would give us
leave, to see what was the matter. As soon as we came clear of the trees,
which blinded as before, we saw elearly what had been the case. and how
Friday had disengaged the poor guide, though we did not presently discern
what kind of ereature it was he had killed.
But never was a tight managed so hardily. and m such a surprising man-
ner, as that which followed, between Friday and the bear, which gave us
all, though at first we were surprised and afraid for him, the greatest diver-
sion imaginable. As the bear is a heavy clumsy creature, and does not gallop
as the wolt' does, who is swilt and light, so he has two particular qualities,
whieh generally are the rule of his actions: tlrst. as to men, who are not his
proper prey (he does not usually attempt them, except they that attack him,
unless he be excessive hungry, whieh it is probable might now be the ease,
the ground being covered with snow), if you do not meddle with him. he
will not meddle with you; but then you must take care to be very civil
to him, and give him the road, for he is a very nice gentleman; he will not
go a step out'ol' his way for a prince ; nay, it" you are really all'aid, your best
way is to look another way, and lteep going on; (or sometimes, it' you step
and stand still, and look steadfastly at him, he takes it for an afl'wnt; but, if
you throw or toss any thing at him, and it hits him, though it Were but a hit
of stick as big as your finger, he thinks himself abused, and sets all other
business aside to pursue his revenge. and will have satisfaction in point of
honour ;--this is his first quality: the. next is, if he he once all'routed, he will
never leave you, night nor day, till he has his revenge; but (allows, at a good
round rate, till he overtakes you.

My man Friday had delivered our guide, and, when we came up to him, he
was helping him of? from his horse, for the man was both hurt and frightened;
when, on a sudden, we espied the bear eome out of the wood; and a vast
monstrous one it was, the biggest by fitr that ever i saw. We were all a
little surprised when we saw him; but, when Friday saw him, it was easy to
ace joy and courage in the fellow's countenance: ' 0, 0, 0." says Friday,
three times, pointing to him: ' 0 master! you give me to leave, me shakee
te hand with him; me malice you good laugh.'

I was surprised to see the fellow so well pleased : ' You fool.' says i, t he
will est you np.'--' Eatce me up! eatee me up I' says Friday, twice over
again: ' me catee him up; me maltee you good laugh : you all stay here, me
show you good langh.' So down he sits, and gets 00' his boots in a moment,
and puts on a pair of pumps (as we call the flat shoes they wear, and which
he had in his pocket), gives my other servant his horse, and with his gun
away he flew. swift like the wind.

The beer was walking sonly on, and ofi'ered to meddle with nobody, till
Friday, coming pretty near, calls to him, as it the bear could understand him.
' Hark ye, hark ye,' says Friday, ' me speakee with you.' We followed at a
distance; for now, being come down on the Gascony side of the mountains,
we were entered a vast great forest, where the country was plain and pretty
open, though it had many trees in it scattered here and there. Friday, who
had, as we say, the heels olf the bear. came up with him quiekly,,and takes up a
great stone, and throws it at him. and hit lnm just on the head, but did him no
more harm than it' he had thrown it against a wall; but it answered Friday's
end, for the rogue was so void of fear that he did it purely to make the bear fol-
low him, and shew as some laugh, as he called it. As soon as the bear feltths188 rue urn sun seven-runes

blow, and saw him, he turns about, and comes after him, taking devilith long
strides. and shuttling on at a strange rate, so as would have put 1: horse to e.
middling gallop. Away runs Friday, and takes his course as if he run to-
wards us for help; so we all resolved to fire at once upon the bear, and de-
liver my nun; though I was angry at him heartily for bringing the bear
back upon us, when he was going about his own business another way: and
especially 3 was angry that he had turned the hear upon us, and then run
away; and i called out, ' You dog, is this your making us laugh? Come
away, and take your horse, that we may shoot the creature.' He heard me,
and cried out. ' No shoot, no shoot; stand still, and you get much laugh!
and, as the nimble creature ran two feet for the hour's one, he turned on a
sudden on one side of us, and, seeing a great oak-tree fit {or his purpose, he
beckoned to new follow ; and. doubling his pace, he gets nunbly up the tree,
laying his gun down upon the ground. at about five or six yards from the
bottom of the tree. The bear soon came to the tree, and we followed at a
distance: the first thing he did, he stopped at the gun, smelt to it, but let it
lie; and up he scrambles into the tree, climbing like a cot, though so mon-
strous heavy l was amazed at the folly, as I thought of it, of my man, and
could not for my life see any thing to laugh at yet, till, seeing the bear get
up the tree, we all rode near to him.

When we came to the tree. there was Friday got out to the small end of

a large branch. and the bear got about halfway to him. As soon as the
bear got out to that part where the limb of the tree was weaker,-' Hal'
says he to us, ' now you see me teaches the bear dance :' so he fall: a jumping
and shaking the bough, at which the bear began to totter, but stood still, and
began to look behind him, to see how he should get back: then, indeed, we did
laugh heartily. But Friday had not done with him by a great deal; when,
seeing him stand still, he calls out to him again, as it he had supposed the bear
could speak English, ' What. you come no farther l pray you come further!
so he left jumping and shaking the tone ; and the bear, just as if he under.
stood what he said, did come a little farther; than he fell s-jumpiog again,
and the bear stopped again. We thought now was a good time to knock him
in the head, and called to Friday to stand still, and we would shoot the bear:
but he cried out earnestly, ' O pray! 0 pray! no shoot; me shoot hy-and'
then ;' he would have said liy-nnd-by. However. to shorten the story,
Friday danced so much, and the bear stood so tielalish, that we had laughing
enough, but still could not imagine what the fellow would do: for, first, we
thought he depended upon shaking the bear off; and we found the hear
was too running for that too; for he would not go out far enough to be
thrown down, but dings first with his great broad claws and feet. so that we
could not imagine what would be the end of it, and what the jest would be
at last. But Friday put us out of doubt quickly: for, seeing the {bear cling
first to the trough. and that he would not be persuaded to come any farther.
' Well, well.' says Friday. ' you no come farther, me go ; you no come to
me, me come to you ;' and upon this he goes out to the smaller end oftho
trough, where it would bend with his weight, and gently lets himself down
by it, sliding down the bough, till he came near enough tojump down on
his feet, and away he runs to his gun, takes it up; and stands still. ' Well,'
said I to him. ' Friday, what will you do now ? Why don't you shoot him 0'
-' No shoot; says Friday, ' no yet; me shoot now. me no kill; me stay,
give you one more laugh :' and, indeed, so he did, as you will see presently;
for, when the bear saw his enemy gone, he comes back il-om the bough
where he stood, but did it mighty cautiously, looking behind him every step,
and coming backward till he got into the body of the tree: then, with the
same hinder end foremost, he came down the tree, grasping it With his claws,
and moving one foot at a time, very leisurely. At this juncture, and just
before he could set his hindzfoot on the ground, Friday stepped up close to
him, clapped the muzzle of his piece into his ear, and shot him dead. Then
the rogue turned about, to see if we did not laugh; and when he saw we
were pleased, by our looks, he falls a-laughing himself very loud. ' So we
kill bear in my country,' says Friday. ' So you kill them t' says I: ' why,
you have no guns.'---' No,' says he, ' no gun; but shoot great much long
arrow.' This was a good diversion to us; but we were still in a wild place,
and our guide very much hurt, and what to do we hardly knew: the how!-
ing of wolves ran much in my head ; and, indeed, except the noise l once
heard on the shore of Africa, of which I have said something already, I never
heard any thing that filled me with so much horror. !
These things, and the approach of night, called us ofi', or else, as Friday
would have had us, we should certainly have taken the skin of this monstrous
creature off, which was worth saving; but we had near three leagues to go,
and our guide hastened us; so we let! him, and went forward on our journey.
The ground was still covered with snow, though not so deep and dange-
rous as on the mountains; and the ravenous creatures, as we heard afierwards,
were come down into the forest and plain country, pressed by hunger, to
seek for food, and had done a great deal of mischief in the villages, where
they surprised the country--people, killed a great manv of their sheep and
horses, and some peOplc too. We had one dangerous place to pass, which
(pr guide. told us, if there were more wolves in the country, we should find
them there; and this was a small plain, surrounded with woods on every
side, and a long narrow defile, or lane, which we were to pass to get through
the wood, and then we should come to the village where we were to lodge.
It was within half an hour of sun-set when we entered the first wood, and a.
little after sun-set when we came into the plain. We met with nothing in
the first wood, except that, in a little plain within the wood, which was not
above two fnrlongs over, we saw five great wolves cross the road. full speed,
one alter another, as if they had been in chase of some prey. 80!! had .it in
view: they took no notice of us, and were gone out of sight in a fiwmoa
meats. Upon this, our guide, who, by the way, was but a faint-hearted
fellow, bid us keep in a ready posture, for, he believed, there were more A
wolves a-coming. We kept our arms ready, andour eyes about us; but
we saw no, more wolves till we came through. that wood, which was near
halls league, and entered the plain. As soon as we came into the plain. ..
we had occasion enough to look about us. The first object we met with
was a dead horse; that is to say, a poor horse which the wolves had killed,
sud at least a. dozen of them at work, we could not say eating of him, bu
picking of his bones rather; for they had eaten up all the flesh before. W
did not think lit to disturb them at their feast ; neither did they take much
notice of us. Friday would have let fly at them. but! would not sufl'er him
by any means; for 1 found we were like to have more business upon our
hands than we were aware of. We were not gone half over the plain
when we began to hear the wolves howl in the wood on our left in n fright.
in! manner, end presently after we saw about a hundred coming on directly
towards us, all in a body. and most of them in nJiuc. as regularly as an army
drawn up by experienced officers. lscarce knew in what manner to re-
ceive them. but found to draw ourselves in o clone line runs the only way; so
we formed in a moment: but, that we might not have too much interval, I
ordered that only every other man should the, and that the others, who had
not fired, should stand ready to give them a second volley immediately, if
they continued to advance upon us; and then, that those who had fired at
first should not pretend to load their fusces again, but stand ready every one
with a pistol, for we were all armed with a mm and a pair of pistols each
man; so we were, by this method. able to fire six v'olleys, half of us at s
time: however, at present we had no necessity; (or, upon firing the first
volley, the enemy made a full stop, being terrified as well with the noise as
with the fire, Four of them, being shot in the head, dropped; several others
were wounded, and went bleeding oil', as we could see by the snow. 1
found they stopped, but did not immediately retreat; whereupon, remember:
ing that I had been told that the fiercest creatures were terrified at the voice
or a man, I caused all the company to halloo as loud as we could; and 1
found the notion not altogether mistaken; for, upon our shout, they began
to retire, and turn about. I then ordered a second volley to be fired in their
rear, which put them to the gallop. and away they went to the woods.
This gave us leisure to charge our pieces again; and, that we might lose no
time, we kept going: but we had but little more than loaded our fusees,
and put ourselves in readiness, when we heard a terrible noise in the same
wood on our loll. only that it was further onward, the some way we were to go.
The night was coming on, and the light begun to be dusky, which made
it worse on our side; but, the noise increasing, we could easily perceive
that it was the howling and yelling of those hellish creatures; and, on s
sudden, are perceived two or three troops of wolves. one on our leit. one he.
hind us, and one in our front, so that we seemed to be mmunded with
them. However, as they did not fall upon us, we kept our way forward as

fast as we could make our horses go, which, the way being very rough, was
only s good hard trot. In this manner we came in view of the entrance u
a wood, through which we were to pass. It the fiirther side of the plain;
but we were greatly surprised, when, coming nearer the lone or pass, we
saw s confused number of wolves standing just at the entrance. On a

sudden, st soother opening ofthe wood, we heard the noise of a gun. sud,._.",--v',y'_...-..P" 7,-'w.'.--- . . .

or aoatuson cauaon. . 191

looking that way, out rushed a horse, with a saddle and s bridle on him, flying
like the wind, and sixteen or seventeen wolves after him, full speed. Indeed;
the horse had the heels of them; but, as we supposed that he could not hold
it at that rate, we doubted not but they would get up with him at last. No
question but they did. -

But here we had a most horrible sight; for, riding up to the entrance
where the horse came out, we found the carcasses of another horse and of
two men devoured by the ravenous creatures, and one of the men was, no
doubt, the same whom we heard fire the gun, for there lay a gun just by
him fired 06'; but, as to the man, his head and the upper partof his body were
eaten up. This filled us with horror, and we knew not what course to take;
but the creatures resolved us soon, for they gathered about us presently, in
hopes of prey; and I verily believe there were three hundred of them. It
happened very much to our advantage, that, at the entrance into the wood,
but a little way from it, there lay some large timber-trees, which had been
cut down the summer before, and I suppose lay there for carriage. I drew
my little troop in among those trees; and, placing ourselves in a line behind
one long tree, I advised them all to alight; and. keeping that tree before us
for a breastmork, to stand in a triangle, or three fronts, enclosing our horses
in the centre. We did so; and it was well we did; for never was a more
furious charge than the creatures made upon us in this place. They came on
with a growling kind of noise, and mounted the piece of timber, which, as I
said, was our breast-work, as if they were only rushing upon their prey; '
and this fury of theirs, it seems, was principally occasioned by their seeing
our horses behind us. I ordered our men to fire as before,--every other man;
and they took their aim so sure, that they killed several of the wolves at
the first voiley'; but there was a necessity to keep a continual firing, for they
came on like devils, those behind pushing on those before.

When we had fired a second volley of our fusees, we thought they stopped
a little, and I hoped they would have gone off; but it was but a moment,
for others came forward again; so we fired two volleys of our pistols; and
I believe in these four firings we had killed seventeen or eighteen of them,
and lamed twice as many; yet they came on again. I was loth to spend
our shot too hastily; so I called my servant, not my man Friday, for he was' '-
better employed, for, with the greatest dexterity imaginable, he had charged
my fusee and his own while we were engaged, but, as I said, I called my '
other man, and, giving him a horn of powder, I bade him'. lay a_ train all
along the piece of timber, and let it be a large train. He did'o; 'and had. but
just time to get away, when the wolves came up to it, and some got upon
it; when I, snapping an uncharged pistol close to the powder, set it ottfire: :
those that were upon the timber were scorched with it; and six or seven of
them fell, or rather jumped in among us, with the force and fright at the
fire. We despatched these in an instant; and the rest were so mghtened

with the light,--which the night, for itwas now very near dark, made more-
terrible--that they drew back a little; upon which I ordered our last. pistols ref:
to be'fired ofi' in one volley, and afier that we gave a about. .Upon thisthe't PS1",

wolves turned tail. and we sallied immediately upon near twenty lame one;
that we found struggling on the ground, and tell a cutting them with our
swords, which answered our expectation; lbr the crying and howling they
made was better understood by their fellows; so that they all fled and let! us

"'0: had, first and last, killed about three score of them; and, had it been
day-light, we had killed many more. The field of battle being thus cleared,
We made forward again, for we had still near a league to go. We heard
the ravenous creature: howl and yell in the woods as we went, several times,
and sometimes we fancied we saw some of them; but the snow dazzling our
eyes, we were not certain: in about an hour more we came to the town
where we were to lodge, which we found in a terrible fright, and all in
arms; for, it seems, the night before, the wolves and some bears had broke
into the village, and put them in such terror that they were obliged to keep
guard night and day, but especially in the night, to preserve their cattle, and:
indeed, their people.

The next morning, our guide was so ill, and his limbs swelled so much
with the molding of his two wounds, that he could go no further; so we
were obliged to take a new guide here. and go to 'l'huulouse, when: we
found a warm climate, a fruitful pleasant country, and no snow, no wolves.
nor any thing like tin-m; but, when we told our story at 'l'houlouse, they
told us it was nothing but what we: ordinary in the great forest at the foot
of the mountaina. rsrmcially when the snow lay on the ground; but they in-
quired much what kind of a guide we had got. who would venture to
bring us that way in such a severe season; and told us it was surprising
we were not all devoured. When we told them how we placed our.
nelves, and the horses in the middle, they blamed us exceedingly, and
told us it was titty to one but we had been 'all destroyed; for it was the
sight of the horses which made the wolves so furious. seeing their pro ';
and that, at other titties, they are really afraid of a gun; but being exew
sire hungry, and raging on that account. the engemm to come at the
horses had made them senseless of danger; and that if we had not, by
the continued fire, and at last by the stratagmn ol' the train of powder,
mastered them, it. had been great odds but that we had been torn to
pieces: whereas, had we been content to have out still on horseback, and
fired as horsemen, they would not have taken the horses so much for their
own, when men were on their backs, as otherwise: and withol they told us.
that nt last, if we had stood altogether, and loll our horses, they would have
been so eager to have devoured them, that: we might have come of? safe,
especially having our lire-arms in our hands, and being so many in number.
For my part, 1 was never so sensible of danger in my life; for, seeing wove
three hundred devils come roaring and Open-mulled to devour us, and
having nothing to shelter us, or retreat to, i gave myself over for lost ; and,
"It was, I believe I shall never care to crow lliooe mountains again. I
think I would much rather go a thousand leagues by sea. though I was sure
to meet with a storm once a week.

nothing but what other travellers have given an account of. with much more
advantage than I can. I travelled from Thoulouae to Paris, and without any
considerable stay came to Calais, and landed safe at Dover, the 14th of Jan
nuary, after having a severe cold season to travel in.

l was now come to the centre of my travels, and had in a little time all
my newvdiacovered estate safe about me, the bill: of exchange which I
brought with me having been very currently paid.

My printipal guide and privy counsellor was my good ancient Widow-
who, in gratitude for the money [had sent. her, thought no pain: too much,
nor care too great, to employ for me; and I trusted her no entirely with
every thing, that i was perfectly easy as to the security of my effects; and,
indeed, I was very happy from the beginning, and now to the end, In the
unspotted integrity of this good gentlcwoman.

I now resolved to dispose of my plantation in the Brazils, it! could find
means. For this purpose i wrote to my old friend at Lisbon. who having
offered it to the two merchants, the survivors of my Misteea, who lived in
the Brazita, they accepted the offer, and remitted thirty-three thousand
piece: of eight to a correspondent of theirs at Lisbon, to pay for it. Having
signed the instrument of sale, and sent it to my old friend, he remitted me
hills of exchange for thirty-two thousand eight hundred pieces of eight for
the estate, reserving the payment of a hundred moidorex a year to himself
during his life, and fifty moidorcs altemrds to his son for life, which I had
promised them.

Though i had sold my estate in the Brazils, yet I could not keep the
country out of my head ; nor could l resist the strong inclination I had to see
my island. My true friend, the widow, earnestly dissuaded me from it, and
so far prevailed with me, that, for almost seven years, she prevented my run-
ning ahrond; during which time i took my two nephews, the children of
one of my brothers, into my care: the eldest, having something of his own,
l bred up as a gentleman, and gave him a settlement of some addition to hie
estate, after my deceaae. The other i put out to a captain ot'a ship: and after
five years, finding him a sensible, hold, enterprising young fellow, Iput
him into a good ship, and sent him to sea: and this young fellow aflerwards
drew me in, as old as I was, to further adventures myself. .

In the mean time I in part settled myself here; for, first of all, I married.
and that not either to my disadvantage or dissatisfaction, and had three
children, two sons and one daughter ; but my wife dying, and my nephew
coming home with good success from a voyage to Spain, my inclination to
go abroad, and his importunity, prevailed, and engaged me to go in his abip
us a private trader to the East Indies. This was in the year 1694.

But these thing; with some very surprising incidents in some new adven-
tures of my own, for ten years more. i shall give a further account of in

another volume.

VOLUME THE SECOND.

 

THAT homely proverb used on so many occasions in England, via, ' That
What is bred in the bone will not go out of the flesh,' was never more verified
than in the story of my lifer Any one would think, that, after thirty-five
years' affliction, and a variety of unhappy circumstances, which few men, if
any, ever went through before, and, after near seven years of peace and en-
joyment in the fulness of all things, grown old, and when, if ever, it might
be allowed me to have had experience of every state of middle lite, and to
know which was most adapted to make a man completely happy; I say,
after all this, any one would have thought that the native propensity to
. rambling, which I gave an account of in my first setting out in the world to

have been so predominant in my thoughts, should be worn out, the volatile

part be fully evacuated, or, at least, condensed, and Imight, atsixty-one v

years of age, have been a little inclined to stay at home, and have done ven-
turing life and fortune any more.

Nay, farther, the common motive of foreign adventures was taken away us
me; for I had no fortune to make; [had nothing to seek: if I had gained
ten thousand pounds, I had been no richer; for I had already suficient {or
me, and for thme I had to leave it to; and that I had was visibly increasing;
for, having no great family,l could not spend the income of what Ihad, nnle.
I would set up for an expensive way of living, such as a great family, ser3_

vents, equipage, gaiety, and the like, which were things I had no noting!"

or inclination to; so that I had nothing indeed to do but to sit still, and'gugg i

enjoy what I had got, and see it increase daily upon my hands. Yldflll'L It

these things had no effect upon me, or, at least, not enough to resist the
strong inclination I had to go abroad again, which hung aboutme hkea
chronical distemper. In particular, the desire of seeing my new plantation
in the island, and the colony I let! there, ran in my head continually. I
dreamed of it all night, and my imagination ran upon it all day it was upper-
nmt in all my thoughts; and my tlmcy worked so steadily and strongly upon
it, that I talked of it in my sleep: in short, nothing could remove it out of
my mind : it even broke so violently into all my discourses, that it made my
conversation tiresome, for I could talk of nothing else: all my discourse ran
into it, even to impertinence; and I saw it in myself.

I have oflen heard persons of good judgment say, that all the stir people
make in the world about ghost: and apparition: is owing to the strength of
imagination, and the powerful operation of fancy in their minds; that there
is no such thing as a spirit aypearing, or a ghost walking, and the like: that
people's poring afl'ertiouately upon the past conversation of their deceased
friend, so realizes it to them, that they are capable of fancyiog, upon some
extraordinary vimunnztances, that they see them, talk to them, and are an-
swer-ml h)- thcm, when, in truth, there is nothing but shadow and vapour in
the thing. and they really know nothing of the molten

For my gmrt, i know not to this hour whether there are any such thing!
as real apparitions, spectres, or walking of pimple alter they are dead; or
whether there is any thing in the stories they tell us of that kind, more than
the product of vapours, sick minds, and wandering fancies: but this I know,
that my imagination worked up to such a height, and brought me into such
exam of vapours, or what else 1 may call it, that I actually supposed myself
once upon the spot, at my old castle, behind the trees; saw my old Spaniard,
Friday's father, and the rcprobate sailors 1 left upon the island; nay, I
fauciml l talked with them, and looked at them steadily, though l was broad
awake, as <<t iwrsons just before me; and this 1 did till 1 often frightened
mysell'with the images my fancy represented to me. One time, in my sleep,
i had the villany of the three pirate tailors so lively related to me by the
first Spaniard and Friday's father, that it was surprising: they told me how
they barbarously attempted to murder all the Spaniards, and that they set
fire to the provisions they had laid up, on purpose to distress and starve
them; things that I had never heard of, and that indeed were never all of
them true in fact ; but it was so warm in my imagination, and so realized to
me, that, to the hour l saw them, I could not be persuaded but that it was.
or would be, true: also how I resented it, when the Spaniard complained
to me; and how i brought them to justice, tried them before me, and ordered
them all three to be hanged. What there was really in this shall be seen
in its place: for, however I came to form such things in my dream, and what
secret converse of spirits injeeted it, yet there was, I say, much of it true. I
own that this dream had nothing in it literaliy and specifically true; but the
general part was so true, the base villanoua behaviour of these three hard-
ened rogues was such, and had been so much worse than all I can deacribe,
that the dream had too much similitnde of the fact; and, as I would atter~
words have punished them severely. so, if! had hanged them 3",] had been
much in the right, and even should have been justified both by the laws of
God and man. But to return to my story :-~In this kind of temper I lived
some veal-r l had no enjoyment of my life, no pleasant hours, no agreeable
diversion, but what had something or other of this in it; so that my wife,
who saw my mind wholly bent upon it, told me very seriously, one night.
that she believed there was some secret powerful impulse of Providence upon
me, which had determined me to go thither again; and that she found no-
thing hindered my going but my being engaged to a wife and children.
She told me that it was true she could not think of parting with me; but
as she was sawed, that, if she was dead, it would be the first thing I would
do; so. as it seemed to her that the thing was determined above, she would
not be the only obstruction; for, if I thought fit, and resolved to go----Here
she found me very intent upon her words, and that I looked very earnestly
at her, so that it a little disordered her, and she stopped. I asked her why
she did not go on, and say out what she was going to say ? But I perceived
that her heart was too full, and some tears stood in her eyes. ' Speak out.
my dear,' said I; 'ure you willing I should gol' 'No; says she, very afl'ec--
tiouately, 'l on: far lion: willing; but if you are resolved to go,' says she, ' and
rather than i would be the only hinderancc, I will go with you: for though
I think it a most preposterous thing for one of your years, and in your condi-
tion, yet, if it must be,' said she, again weeping. 'I would not leave you i for,
if it be of Heaven, you must do it; there is no resisting it: and, if Heaven
make it your duty to go, he will also make it mine to go with you, or other-
wise dispose of me, that! may not obstruct it.'

This affectionate behaviour of my wife's brought me a little out of the
vapours, and I began to comider what I was doing: I corrected my van-
dering fancy. and began to argue with myself sedately, what business 1 had,
afler tllreescore years, and alter such a life of tedious sufl'eriugs and disasters.
and closed in so happy and easy a manner; I say, what business had I to
rush into new hazards, and put myself upon adventures fit only for youth
and poverty to run into ?

With these thoughts I considered my new engagement; that] had a wife,
one child born, and my wife then great with-child of another; that I had all
the world could give me. and had no need to seek hazard for gain; that I
Was declining in years, and ought to think rather of leaving what] had
gained, than of seeking to increase it; that as to what my wife had said of
its being an impulse from Heaven, and that it should be niy duty to go. I
had no notion of that : so, alter many of these agitation; lstruggled with
the power of my imagination; reasoned myself out of it, as I believe people
may always do in like cases if they will; and, in a word, I conquered it;
composed myself with such arguments as occurred to my thoughts, and which
my present condition furnished me plentifully with; and particularly, as the
most ed'ectual method, I resolved to divert myself with other things, and to
engage in some business that might efi'eetually tie me up from any more ex-
cursions of this kind; for I found that thing return upon me chiefly when I
was idle, and had nothing to do, nor any thing of moment immediately be-
{ore me. To this purpose 1 bought a little farm in the county of Redford,
and resolved to remove myself thither. I had a little convenient house upon

it; and the land about it, I found. was capable of great improvement; slid
it was many ways suited to my inclination. which delighted in cultivating.
managing, planting, and improving of land; and particularly, being an in~
land country, I was resumed from convening among sailors, and things re-
lating to the remote parts of the world.

In a word, I went down to my farm, settled my family, bought toe plough:
barrows, a cart, waggon, horses, cows, and sheep, and, setting seriously to
work, because, in one half year, a mere country gentleman: my thoughts
were entirely taken up in managing my servants, cultivating the ground,
enclosing, planting, &c. , and I lived, as! thought, the most agreeable life
that Nature was capable of directing, or that a man always bred to misforv
tunes was capable of retreating to.

I farmed upon my own land; I had no not 'to pay, was limited by no
articles; 1 could pull up or cut down as I pleased; what I planted was {or
myself, and what I improved was for my family; and, having thus left all
the thoughts of wandering, I had not the least discomfort in any part of life
as to this world. Now I thought indeed that I enjoyed the middle state or
life which my {other so earnestly recommended to me. and lived a kind of
heavenly life, something like what is described by the poet, upon the subject
of a country life :--

" "Free from vices, free from one,
" Age has no pain, and youth no snare."

But, in the middle of all this felicity, one blow from unseen Providence
unhinged me at once; and not only made a breach upon me inevitable and
incurable, but drove me, by its consequences, intoa deep relapse of the
wandering disposition, which, as I may say, being born in my very blood;
soon recovered its hold of me, and, like the returns of a violent distemper.
came on with an irresistible force upon me, so that nothing could make any
more impression upon me. This blow was the loss of my wife. It is not
my busimss here to write an elegy upon my wife, give a'character of her
particular virtues, and make my court to the sex by the flattery of a funeral
sermon. She was, in a few words, the stay of all my affairs, the centre of
all my enterprises; the engine that, by her prudence, reduced me to that
happy compass l was in, from the most extravagant and ruinous project that
fluttered in my head, as above; and did more to guide my rambling genius
than a mother's tears, a father's instructions, a friend's counsel, or all my
own reasoning powers, could do. I was happy in listening to her entreaties,
and always felt. moved by her tears ; and was to the last degree desolate and
dislocated in the world by the loss of her.

When she was gone, the world looked awkwardly round me. I was as
much a stranger in it, in my thoughts, as I was in the Brands, when I first
went on shore there; and as much alone, except as to the assistance of
'ervants. as l was in my island. I knew neither what to think not what to
do. I saw the world busy around me , one part labouring for bread, another
part squandcring m rile excuses or empty pleasures, equally miserable, be-
cause the end they proposed still fled from them; for the men of pleasure
every day surfeited of their vice, and heaped up work for sorrow and repentk'

    

".
ance; and the men of labour spent their strength in daily struggling tor
bread to maintain the vital strength they laboured with: so living in a daily
Circulation of sorrow, living but to work, and working but to live, as it
daily bread were the only end of wearisome life, and a weansome life the
only occasion of daily bread.

This put me in mind of the life I lived in my kingdom, the island; where
I suffered no more corn to grow, because I did not want it; and bred no
more goats, because I had no more use for them; where the money lay in
the drawer till it grew mouldy, and had scarce the favour to be looked
upon in twenty years.

All these things, had 1 improved them as l ought to have done, and as
reason and religion had dictated to me, would have taught me to search
farther thanhuman enjoyments for a full felicity; and that there was some-
thing,'which certainly was the reason and end of life, superior to all these
things, and which was either to he possessed, or at least hoped for, on this
side the grave.

But my sage counsellor was gone; I was like aship without a pilot, that
could only run afore the wind: my thoughts ran all away again into the old
afl'air ; my head was quite turned with the whimsies of foreign adventures;
and all the pleasant innocent amusements of my farm, my garden, my cattle,

and my family, which before entirely possessed me, were nothing to me, had
no relish, and were like music to one that has no car, or food to one that has

no taste: in a word, I resolved to leave ofl' housekeeping, let my farm, and
return to London; and in a few months afier I did so.

'When I came to London, I was still as uneasy as I was before; I had no
relish for the place, no employment in it, nothing to do but to saunter about
like an idle person, of whom it may he said he is perfectly useless in God's
creation, and it is not one farthing's matter to the rest of his kind whether
he be dead or alive. This also was the thing which, of all circumstances of
life, was the most my aversion, who had been all my days used to an active
life; and I would oflen say to myself, ' A state of idleness is the very dregs of
life :' and indeed I thought I was much more suitably employed when I was
twenty-six days making me a deal board.

It was now the beginning of the year 1698, when my nephew, whom, as
I have observed before, I had brought up to the sea, and had made him
commander of a ship, was come home from a short voyage to Bilboa, being
the first he had made. He came toune, and told me that some merchants of

his acquaintance had been proposing to him to go a voyage for them to the
East Indies and to China, as private traders.--' And now, uncle,' says he, ' if

you will go to sea with me, I will engage to land you upon your old habita~
tion in the island; for we are to touch at the Brazils.'_'

Nothing can be a greater demonstration of a future state, and of the ex-
Istenoe of an invisible world, than the concurrence of second causes with the
ideas of things which we form in our minds, perfectly reserved, and not

communicated to any in the world.
My nephew knew nothing how far my distemper of wandenng was re-200 run my: mn Anvnn'runzs

turned upon me, and I knew nothing or what he had in his thought to nay,
when that rery morning. before he come tome, I had, in 1 great deal of
confusion of thought, and revolving every part of my circumstances in my
mind. come to this resolution, viz" that I would go to Lisbon, Ind consult
with my old seaocnptaiu; and so, if it was rational and practicable, [would
so and see the island again. and nee what was become of my people there.
I had pleased myoelf with the thoughts ofpeopling the place, and carrying
inhabitants from hence, getting. patent for the poueooion, and I knew not
wind; when, in the middle atoll this, in cameo my nephew. no I have said,
with his project of carrying me thither in his way tothe East Indies.

I paused awhile at his word; and, looking steadily at him, ' What devil,'
onid l. ' sent you on thin unlucky errand l' My nephew dared, as if he had
been frightened, at first; but, perceiving that I was not much displeaoed
with the proposal, he recovered himself. '1 hope it may not be an unlucky
proposal, sir,' says he; '1 dare say you would be pleased to see your new
colony there, iii-here you once reigned with more felicity than most of your
brother--menarche in the world.'

In a word, the scheme hit to exactly with my temper, that is to any, the
prepooeeuion I was under, and of which 1 have said so much, that I told him,
in a few words, ifhe agreed with the merchants I would go with him: but
I told him I would not promise to go any further than my own island. 'Why,
sir,' my: be, ' you don't want to be left there again, 1 hope ?' ' Why,' raid I,
'cou you not take me up again on your return 1' He told me it would not be
possible to do so ; that the merchants would never 'ollow him to come that
way with a laden ship of such value, it being a month's sail out of his way.
nnd might be three or four. 'Baideo, sir, it'l should miscarry.' said he, ' and
not return at all, then you would he just reduced to the condition you were
in before.'

This was very rational; but we both found out a. remedy for it; which
was, to carry a framed sloop on board the ship, which, being taken in pieces,
and shipped on board the ship, might, by the help of some carpenters, whom
we agreed to carry with us, be set up again in the island, and finished, fit
to go to non, in a few days. _

I was not long resolving; for indeed the importunitiee of. my nephew
joined so eli'cctually with my inclination. that nothing could oppose me; on
the other hand, my wife being dead, I hsd nobody concerned themselves so
much for me as to persuade me to one way oaths other, except my ancient
good friend the widow, who earnestly struggled with me to consider my
years, my easy circumstances, and-the needless hamdo of a long voyage,
end, shove all, my young children. But it ms all to no purpose ,<<I had
on irresistible desire to the voyage; and I told her I thought there was some-
thing on uncommon in the implosion: I'm. upon my mind. for the voyage,
that it would he as kind of resisting Providence ill. ohould attemptto otay at

~ Intruder to this I made my will, andsettlcd. the estate 1 had in'ruoh s
manner for my children, and placed it in "such hands, that I was pathway can
and named they would have justice done them. whatever might befall me :
and thr fiat--education, I led: it wholly to'the widow, with nouflicicnt main-
tenoune tobcrseif for her csre : all which she richly deserved. for no mother
could have taken more care in their education. or understood it better: and.
as she lived till I came home, I also lived to thank her for it.

My nephew was ready tosail about the. beginning of January 1694-6; and
I, with my man Friday, went on board in the Downs the 8th: having. 'beC/
sides that sloop which I mentioned above, a very considerable cargo of all
kindsof necessary thingst'or my colony; which, iridid not find ingond
condition, 1 resolved to leave so. '

First, I carried with me some mu, whom 1 proposed to piece there
as inhabitants, or at least. to set on work there, upon my account, 'while- I
staid, and either to leave. them there, or carry them forward, so they would
appear willing; particularly, icnrried two carpenters, a smith, and ovary
handy ingenious fellow, who was a cooper by trade. and was also a general
mechanic; for he was dexterous at making wheels, nod hand-mills to grind
corn; was a good turner, and a good pot-maker; he also made any thing
that was proper to make ofesrth or of wood; in a word, we called lemon:-
Jock-ofinlhtrndes. With these I carried a tailor. who had ofi'ered himself
to go a passenger to the East ladies with my nephew, but afterwards con-
seated to stay on our new plantation; and proved a most necessary, handy
fellow, as could be desired, in many other businesses besides that ofhistrsde :
for, as {observed formerly, Necessity arms on for all employment>> '

My cargo, as near as I can recollect, for I have not kept account of the
particulars, consisted of a suflicient quantity of linen, and some English thin
stuffs, for clothing the Spaniards thatl expected to find there , and enough
of them, as, by my calculation, might comfortably supply themfor se'veu
years: if I remember right, the materials- 1 carried for clothing them, with
gloves, hats, shoes, stockings, and all such things <<is they could want for
wearing, amounted to above two hundred pounds, including, some beds,
bedding. and household stud; particularly kitchen utensils, with pots. kettles,
pewter, brass, &e., Ind near a hundred pounds more in ironwork, units,
tools of every kind, staples, hooks, hinges, and every necessary. thing I could:
think of.

I carried also a hundred spare arms, muskets, and {useeag besides some
pistols, a considerable quantity of shot of all sizes, three or {our tons oflcud
and two pieces of brass cannon; and, because i knew not what time and
what: extremities {was providing for, I carried 3 hundred barrels of powder,
besides swords, cutlasscs', and the mo part of some pikes and haiberds: so
that, in short, we had s. largeinoguiue oral! sorts of stores: and! made my
nephew carry two small quarter-deck guns more than he wanted for his ship,
to leave behind if there was ownsion , that, when we conic there, we might
build a fort, and man it against all sort: of enemies: and, indeed, I at first
thought there would he need enough i'or oil; and much more, if wohoped to

82 a C
maintain our possession of the island, as shall be seen In the course of
that story.

I had not such bad luck in this voyage as I had been used to meet with'
and therefore shall have the less occasion to interrupt the reader, who,
perhaps, may be impatient to hear how matters went with my colony: yet
some odd accidents, cm winds, and bad weather, happened on this first
setting out. which made the voyage longer than I expected it at first: and
1', who had never made but one voyage, viz, my first voyage to Guinea, to
which I might be said to come back again, as the voyage was at first dec
signed, began to think thesame ill fate attended me ; and that I was born,
to be never contented with being on shore, and yet to be always unfortunate
at sea.

Contrary winds first put usto the northward, and we were obliged to put
in at Galway, in Ireland, where we lay windbound two-and-tweuty days;
but we had this satisfaction with the disaster, that provisions were here ex~
needing cheap, and in the utmost plenty; so that, while we lay here, we
never touched the ship's stores, but rather added to them. Here, also, I
took in several live hogs, and two cows, with their calves; which I resolved,
if I had a good passage, to put on shore in my island; but we found occasion
to dispose otherwise of them.

We set out on the 5th of February from Ireland, and had a very fair gate
of wind for some days As I remember, it might be about the 90th of Februv
ary, in the evening late, when the mate, having the watch, came into the
round-home, and told us he saw a flash of fire, and heard a gun fired; and.
while he was telling us ot' it, a boy came in, and told us the boatswaio heard
another. This made us all run out upon the quarter-deck, where, for a
while, we heard nothing; but, in a few minutes, we saw a very great light,
and found that there was someqe'ry terrible fire at a distance: immediately
we had recourse to our reckonings, in which we all agreed that there could
be no land that way in which the tire showed itself. no, not for five hundred
leagues, for it appeared at W. N. W. Upon this we concluded it most'be
some ship on fire at sea ; and as, by our hearing the noise of guns just before,
we concluded that it could not be far all; we stood directly towards it, and
- were presently satisfied we should discover it, because, the farther we sailed,
the greater the light appeared; though the weather being hazy, we could
not perceive any thing but the light for a while. In about half an hour's
sailing, the wind being fair for us, though not much of it, and the weather
clearing up a little, we could plainly discern that it was a great ship on fire
in the middle of the sea.

I was most sensibly touched with this disaster, though not at all acquainted
with the persons engaged in it: I presently recollected my former circum-
Nanees, and in what condition I was in, when taken up by the Portuguese
captain; and how much more deplorable the circumstances of the poor cres-
tures belonging to that ship must be, if they had no other ship in company
with them. Upon this, I immediately ordered that five guns should be fired,
one soon after another, that, if possible, we might give notice to them that
wa--Wv; .,

there was help for them at'hsnd, and that they might endeavour tossve
themselves so their boat; for, though we could see the flames of the ship, yet
they, it being night, could see nothing of us.

We lay by some time upon this, only driving as the burning ship drove.
waiting for day-light; when, on a sudden, to our great terror, though we
had reason to expect it, the'ship blew up in the air; and immediately, that
is to say, in a few minutes, all the fire was not; that is to say. the testof the
ship sunk. This was a terrible, and indeed an inflicting sight, for the cake

. the poor men ; who, I concluded, must he eitherall destroyed lathe ship.
or be in the utmost distress in their boat, in the middle of the ocean; which,
at present, by reason it was dark, I could not see. However. to direct them
uwefluloboldlesnsed lightstobehungootinallthepartsottheship
where we could, and which we had lanterns for, and kept firing gens all
the night long; letting them know, by this, that there was nship not far of.

About eight o'clock in the morning we discovered the ship's boats by the
help of our perspective glasses; found there were two of them. both thronged
with people, and deep in the water. We perceived they rowed, the wind
being against them , that they saw our ship, and did their utmost to make
us see them.

We immediately spread our ancient, to let them know we saw them, and
hung a wad out, as a signal for then: to come on board; and then made
more sail, standing directly to them. in little more than hall an hour we
came up with them; and, in a word. took them all in, being no less
than sixty'i'our men, women, and children; for there were a great many
passengers.

Upon the whole, we found it was a French merchant-ship of three hun-
dred tons, home~hoond from Quebec, in the river of Canada. The master
gave us a long account of the distress of his.ship; how the fire begun in the

They had no more to do then but to get into their boats. which, to the-k

hey were escaped from the tire, and a possibility that some ship might
happen to be at sea, and might take them no. They had sails, oars, and a
compass , and were preparing to make the best of their way back to New>>

oy E. They had as much provision and water, as, with sparing it so as to _
be next door to starving, might support them about twelve days; in which.
it they had no bad weather and no contrary winds. the captain said he hope.
he might get to the Banks of Newfoundland, and might perhaps take some
fish, to sustain them till they might go on shore. But there were so many
chances against them in all these cases; such as storms, to overset and founder
them; rains and cold, to benumb and perish their limbs; contrary winds, to
keep them out and starve them; that it must have been next to miraculous
if they had escaped.

In the midst of their consternation, every one being hopeless and ready to
despair, the captain, with tears in his eyes, told me they were on a sudden
surprised with the joy of hearing a gun fire, and, alter that, four more;
these were the five guns which 1 caused to be fired at first seeing the light.
This revived their hearts, and gave them the notice, which, asahove, I de-
sired it should, viz., that there was a ship at hand for their help. It was
upon the hearing of these guns that they took down their masts and sails:
the sound coming from the windward, they resolved to lie--by till morning.
Same time after this, hearing no more guns, they fired three muskets, one a
considerable while after another; but these, the wind being contrary, we
never heard.

Some time after that again they were still more agreeably surprised with
seeing our lights, and hearing the guns, which, as I have said, I caused to be
fired all the rest of the night: this set them to work with their oars, to keep '
their boats a-head, at least, that we might the sooner come up with them;
and, at last, to their inexpressible joy, they found we saw them.

It is impossible for me to express the several gestures, the strange ecstssies,
the variety of postures, which these poor delivered people ran into, to express
the joy of their souls at so unexpected a deliverance. Grief and fear are
easily described; sighs, tears, groans, and a very few motions of the head and
hands, make up the sum of its variety; but an excess of delight, a surprise of
joy, has a thousand extravagancies in it: there were some in tears; some
raging and tearing themselves; as if they had been in the greatest agonies of
sorrow; some stark raving, and downright lunatic; some ran about the ship
stamping with their feet, others wringing their hands; some were dancing,
some singing, some laughing, more crying; many quite dumb, not able to
speak a word; others sick and vomiting; several swooning, and ready to
hint ; and a few were crossing themselves, and giving God thanks.

I would not wrong them neither; there might be many that were thankful
afierwarda, but the pamion was too strong for them atfirst, and they were
not able to master it: they were thrown into ecstasies, and a kind of phrensy;
and it was but a very few that were composed and serious in their joy.

Perhaps, also, the case may have some addition to it from the particular
circumstance of that nation they belonged to; I mean the French, whose
temper is allowed to be more volatile, more passionate, and more sprightly,
and their spirits more fluid, than in other nations. I am not philosopher
enough to determine the cause; but nothing I had ever seen before came up
to it. The ecstasies poor Friday, my trusty savage, was in, when he found
hisfather in the boat, came the nearest to it; and the surprise ofthe master
and his two companions, whom I delivered from the villains thatset thrm on
shore in the island, came a little way towards it; but nothing was to com-
pare to this, either that I saw in Friday, or any where else in my life.

It is'fhrther observable that these extravagancies did not shew themseva
in that different manner I have mentioned in difi'erent persons only; but all
the variety would appear, in a short moccasion of moments, in one and the
same person. A man that we saw this minute dumb, and, as it'were, stupid
and confounded, would the'next minute be dancing and hallooing like an
antic; and the next moment be tearing his hair, or pulling his clothes to
pieces, and stamping them under his feet, like a madman; in a few moments
after that, we would have him all in tears. then sick, swooning, and, had not
immediate help been had, he would, in a few moments, have been dead; and
thus it was, not with one or twq or ten or twenty, but with the greatest part
of them: and, if I remember right, our surgeon was obliged to let blood of
about thirty of them. \

There were twa priests among them, one an' old man, and the other a
young man; and that which was strangest was, the oldest man was the
worst. As soon as he set his foot on board our ship, and saw himself safe,
he dropt down stone dead, to all appearance; not the least sign -of life could
be perceived in' him: our surgeon immediately applied proper remedies to
Mover him, and was the only man in the ship that believed he was not dead.
At length he opened a vein in his am, having first chafed and rubbed the
part, so as to warm it as much as possible: upon this the blood, which only
dropped at first, flowing freely, in three minutes aiterthe man opened his
eyes; and, a quarter of an hour alter that, he spoke, grew better, and, m a
little time, quite well. After the blood was stopped, he walked about;;.told
us he was perfectly well; took a dram of cordial which the surgeon gave
him, and was what we called come to himself. About a quarter of an hour
after this they came running into the cabin to the surgeon, who was bleed-
ing a Frenchwoman that had fainted, and told him the priest was gonestarh
mad. It seems he had begun to revolve the change of his Circumstances in his '

mind and again this put him into an ecstasy of Joy, his spirits whirled about
faster than the vessels could convey them, the blood grew hot and feverish,
and the man was as tit for Bedlam as any creature that ever was in it: tho-
surgeon would not bleed him again in that condition, but gave him some.
thing- to dose and put him tosleep, which, alter some time, operated upon
him, and he awoke next morning perfectly composed and well.

The younger priest behaved with great command of his paaions, and was
really an example of'a serious welt-governed mind: at his first coming-on
board the ship, he threw himself flat on his face, prostrating himselfin thank,
fulness for his deliverance, in'which -I unhappily and unreasonably disturbed
him, really thinking he had'been in "a swoon; but he spoke calmly, thanked
me, told me he was giving God thanks for his deliverance, begged me
to leave him a few momenta-and that, next to his Maker, he would giveme
thanks also.
I was heartily sorry that I disturbed him; and not only lett him, but kept
others from interrupting him also. He continued in that posture abouttlnee
minutes, or little more, after I let! him; then came to me, as he had said he
would, and, with a great deal of seriousness and afi'ection, but with tears in
his eyes, thanked me, that had, under God, given him, and so many miserable
creatures, their lives. I told him I had no room to move him to thank God
for it rather than me, for I had seen that he had done that already; but I
added, that it was nothing but what reason and humanity dictated to all men;
and that we had as much reason as he to give thanks to God, who had
blessed us so far, as to make us the instruments of his mercy to so many of
his creatures '

After this the young priest applied himself to his country-folks: laboured
to compose them; persuaded, entreated, argued, reasoned with them, and
did his utmost to keep them within the exercise of their reason: and with
some he had success, though others were, for a time, out of all government
of themselves.

I cannot help committing this to writing, as perhaps it may be useful to
those into whose hands it may fall, for the guiding themselves in all the ex-
travagancies of their passions; for, if an excess of joy can carry men out to
such a length beyond the reach of their reason, what will not the extrava-
gancies of anger, rage, and a provoked mind, carry us to? And, indeed, here
I saw reason for keeping an exceeding watch over our passions of every kind,
as well those of joy and satisfaction as those of sorrow and anger.

We were something disordered by these extravagancies among our new
guests for the first day; but when they had been retired, lodgings provided
for them as well as our ship would allow, and they had slept heartily--as
most of them did, being fatigued and frightened--they were quite another
sort of people the next day.

Nothing of good manners, or civil acknowledgments for the kindness
shewn them, was wanting; the French, it is known, are naturally apt enough
to exceed that way. The captain and one of the priests came to me the
next day, and desired to speak with me and my nephew: the commander
began to consult with us what should be done with them; and, first, they
told us that we had saved their lives, so all they had was little enough for a
return to us for that kindness received. The captain said they had saved
some money, and some things of value, in their boats, catched hastily out of
the flames ; and if we would accept it, they were ordered to make an offer of
it all to us; they only desired to be set on shore somewhere in our way,
where, if possible, they might get a passage to France. My nephew was
for accepting their money at first word, and to consider what to do with
them afterwards; but I overruled him in that part, for I knew what it was
to be set on shore in a strange country: and if the Portuguese captain that .
took me up at sea had served me so, and took all I had for my deliverance, 1
must have starved, or have been as much aslave at the Brazils as I had beer.

Portuguese' ll not a much better master than a Turk, if not, in some cases,
much worse.

I therefore told the French captain that we had taken them up in their
distress, it was true, but that it was our duty to do so, as we were 'fellow-
creatures; and we would desire to be so delivered, if we were in the like,

or any other, extremity: that we had done nothing for them but what we -

believed they would have done for us, if we had been in their ease,'and they
in ours; but that we took them up to save them, not to plunder them; and
it would be a most barbarous thing to take that little fl'om them which they
had saved out of the tire, and then set them on shore and leave them ;' that
this would be first to save them from death, and then kill them ourselves ,
save them from drowning, and abandon them to starving; and therefore I
would not let the least thing be taken from them. As to setting them on
shore, I told them, indeed, that was an exceeding difliculty to us, for that
the ship was bound to the East Indies; and though we were driven out of
our course to the westward a very great way, and perhaps were directed by
Heaven on purpose for their deliverance, yet it was impossible for us wilfully
to change our voyage on their particular account; nor could my nephew,
the captain, answer it to the freighters, with whom he was under charter-
party to pursue his voyage by the way of Brazil: and all I knew we could
do for them was to put ourselves in the way of meeting with other ships
homeward-bound from the \Vest Indies, and get them a passage, if possible,
to England or France.

The first part of the proposal was so generous and kind, that they could

not but be very thankful for it; bubthey were in a very great consternation, .

especially the passengers, at the notion of being carried away to the East
Indies: they then entreated me, that, seeing I was driven so far to the west.-
ward before I met with them, I would at least keep on the same course to
the banks of Newfoundland, where it was probable I might meet with some
ship or sloop that they might hire to carry them back to Canada, tl'om
whence they came.

I thought this was but a reasonable request on their part, and therefore I
inclined to agree to it; for, indeed,I considered, that to carry this whole
company to the East Indies would not only be an intolerable severity upon
the poor people, but would be ruining our whole voyage, by devouring all
our provisions; so I thought it no breach of chartergpart , but what an un-
foreseen accident made absolutely necessary to us, and in which no one
could say we were to blame; for the laws of God and Nature wonhl- have
forbid that we should refuse to take up two boats' fhll of people in glob a
distressed condition; and the nature of the thing, as well respecfingroufi

":w'u

selves as the poor people, obliged us to set them on shore somewhere or "
other for their deliverance: so I consented that we would carry them to '

' Newfoundland, if wind and weather would permit; and, it not, thatI would

carry them to Martinico, in the West Indies.

The wind continued fresh easterly, but the weather pretty good; and as__

 

J'.."
the winds had continued in the points between N. E. and S. E. along time,
we missed several opportunities of sending them to France; for we met
several ships bound to Europe, whereof two were French, from St. Chris-
topher's; but they had been so long beating up against the wind, that they
durst take in no passengers, for fear of wanting provisions for the voyage, as
well for themselves as for those they should take in; so we were obliged to
go on. It was about a week after this that we made the banks of New-
founndland; where, to shorten my story, we put all our French people on
board a bark, which they hired at sea there, to put them on shore, and alter--
wards to carry them to France, if they could get provisions to victual them-
selves with. When I say all the French went on shore, I should remember _
that the young priest I spoke of, hearing we were bound to the East Indies.
desired to go the voyage with us, and to be set on shore on the coast of
Coromandel; which I readily agreed to, for [wonderfully liked the man,
and had very good reason, as will appear aherwards: also four of the sea-
men entered themselves on our ship, and proved very useful fellows.

From hence we directed our course for the West Indies, steering away 8.,
and S. by E., for about twenty days together, sometimes little or no wind at
all; when we met with another subject for our humanity to work upon, al-
most as deplorable as that before.

it was in the latitude of 27 degrees 5 minutes north, on the 19th day of
March 1694-5, when we spied asail, our course S. E. and by S. : we soon per-
ceived it was a large vessel, and that she bore up to us, but could not, at first,
know what to make of her, till, alter coming a little nearer, we found she
had lost her main top- mast, fore-mast, and bowsprit; and presently she fired
a gun, as a signal of distress: the weather was pretty good, wind at N. N.
\V. a fresh gale, and we soon came to speak with her.

We found her aship of Bristol, bound home from Barbadoes, but had
been blown out of the road at Barbadoes, a few days before she was ready to
sail, by a. terrible hurricane, while the captain and chief mate were both
gone on shore; so that, besides the terror of the storm, they were in an in-
difl'erent case for good artists to bring the ship home. They had been already
nine weeks at sea, and had met with another terrible storm, atter the ham-
cane was over, which had blown them quite out of their knowledge to the
westward, and in which they lost their masts, as above. They told us they
expected to have seen the Bahama islands, but were then driven away again
to the south-east, by a strong gale of wind at N. N. W., the same that blew

now : and, having no sails to work the ship with but a main-course, and a
. kind of square sail upon a jury fore-mast, which they had set up, they
could .not lie near the wind, but were endeavouring to stand away for the
Canaries.
"that that which was worst of all was, that they were almost starved for
wrist of provisions, besides the fatigues they had undergone: their bread
and flesh were quite gone; they had not one ounce left in the ship, and had
hone Tor eleven days. The only relief they had was, their water was not all
spent, and they had about half a_barrel of flour left. They had sugar enough;or aoarrrsox censor-z. 209

- acme mccades, or sweet meats, they had at am, but they were devoured;
and they had seven casks of rum.
' There were a youth and his mother, and a maid servant, on board, who
were going passengers, and, thinking the ship was ready to sail, unhappily
came on board the evening before the hurricane began; and, having no
provisions of their own left, they were in a more deplorable condition than
the rest: for the seamen, being reduced to such an extreme necessity them-
selves, had no compassion, we may be sure, for the poor passengers; and
they were, indeed, in a condition that their misery is very hard to describe.

I had perhaps not known this part, if my curiosity had not led me (the
weather being fair, and the wind abated) to go on board the ship. The
second mate, who, upon this occasion, commanded the ship, had been on
board our ship, and he told me, indeed, they had three passengers in the
great cabin, that were in a deplorable condition: ' Nay,' says he, ' I believe
they are dead, for I have heard nothing of them for above two days; and I
was afraid to inquire afler them.' said be, 'for I had nothing to_relieve them
with.'

We immediately applied ourselves to give them what relief we could
spare; and, indeed, I had so far overruled things with my nephew, that I
would have victualled them, though we had gone away to Virginia, or any
other part of the coast of America, to have supplied ourselves; but there
was no necessity for that.

But now they were in a new danger; for they were afraid of eating too
much, even of that little we gave them. The mate or commander brought
six men with him in his boat; but these poor wretches looked like skeletons,
and were so weak that they could hardly sit to their oars. The mate him-
self was very ill, and half-starved; for he declared he had reserved nothing
from the men, and went share and share _alike with them in every bit
they ate.

I cautionedhim to eat sparingly, but set meat before him immediately;
and he had not eaten three mouthfuls before he began to be sick, and out 0!
order; so he stopped a while, and our surgeon mixed him up something with
some broth, which he said would be to him both food and physie; and after
he had taken it he grew better. In the mean time I forgot'not the men; I
ordered victuals to be given them; and the poor creatures rather devoured
than ate it: they were so excecfing hungry, that they were, in a kind,
ravenous, and had no commando! themselves; and two ofthem ate with so
much grecdiness, that they were in danger of their lives the next morning

The sight of these people's distress was very movrng to me, and brought
to mrnd what I had a terrible prospect of at my first coming on shore in
my island, where I had never the least mouthful of food, or any prospect of
procuring any; besides the hourly apprehensions I had of being made the
food of other creatures. But all the while the mate was 'thus relating to me
the miserable condition of the ship's company, I could not put out of my
thought the story he had told me of the three poor creatures in the g'reat
cabin, viz, the mother, her son, and the maid-servant, whom he had heard

82 9 D
nothing of for two or three days, and whom. he seemed to confess, they had
wholly neglected, their own extremities being so great: by which I under-
stood that they had really given them no food at all, and that therefore they
must be perished, and be all lying dead, perhaps, on the floor or deck of

the cabin.
As I therefore kept the mate, whom we then called captain. on board

with his men, to refresh them, so I also forgot not the starving crew that
were loll on board; but ordered my own boat to go on board the ship, and,
with my mate and twelve men, to carry them a sack of bread, and four or
five piccrs of beef to boil. Our surgeon charged the men to cause the meat
to be boiled while they staid, and to keep guard in the cook-room, to pre-
vent the men taking it to eat raw, or taking it out of the pot before it was
well boiled, and then to give every man but a very little at a time: and by
this caution he preserved the men, who would otherwise have killed them-
selves with that very food that was given them on purpose to save their lives.

At the same time I ordered the mate to go into the great cabin, and see
what condition the poor passengers were in; and, it they were alive, to rom-
i'ort them, and give them whet refreshment was proper: and the surgeon
gave him a large pitcher, with name of the prepared broth which he had
given the mate that was on board, and which he did not question would re-
store them gradually.

I was not sohsficd with this; but, as I said above, having a great mind to
see the scene of misery which I knew the ship itself would present are with,
in it more lively manner than I could have it by report, 1 took the captain
of the ship. as we now called him, with me, and went myself, a little alter
in their boat.

I found the poor men on board almost in a tumult, to get the victunls out
of the boiler before it was ready , but my mate observed his orders, and
kept a good guard at the cook--room door; and the man he placed there,
after using all possible persuasion to have patience, kept them 08' by firm:
however, he mused some biscuit-cakes to be dipped in the pot, and softened
with the liquor of the meat, which they called brawls, and gave them every
one some, to stay their stomachs, and told them it was for their own safety
that he was obliged to give them but little at a. time. But it was all in van);
and had 1 not come on board, and their own commander and officers with
me. and with good words, and some threats also of giving them no more, I
believe they would have broken into the cook-room by force, and tom the
meat out of the furnace; for words are indeed of very small force to a hungry
belly: however, we pacified them, and fed them gradually and cautiously
for the first, and the next time gave them more, and at last filled their
bellies, and the men did well enough

But the misery of the poor passengers in the cabin was of mother nature.

and far beyond the rest: for as, first, the ship's company had no little for
themselves, it was but too true that they had at first kept them very low,
and at last totally neglected them; so that fix six or never: days it might be
and they had wally no food at all, and for seven} days before very little.
The poor mother, who, as the men reported, was a woman of sense and
good breeding, had spared all she could so affectionately for her son, that at
but she entirely sunk under it; and when the mate of our ship went in, she
sat upon the floor or deck, with her back up against the sides, between two
chairs, which were lashed fast, and her head sunk between her shoulders,
like a corpse, though not quite dead. My mate said all he could to revive
and encourage her, and with a spoon put some broth into her mouth. She
opened her lips, and liked up one hand, but could not speak; yet she under.
stood what he said, and made signs to him, intimating that it was too late
for her, but pointed to her child, as if she would have said they should take
care of him. However, the mate, who was exceedingly moved with the
sight, endeavoured to get some of the broth into her mouth, and, as he said,
got two or three spoonfuls down; though 1 question whether he could be
sure of it or not: but it was too late, and she died the same night.

The youth, who was preserved at the price of his most affectionate
mother's life, was not so far gone : yet he lay in a cabin-bed, as one stretched
out, with hardly any life lefi in him. He had a piece of an old glove in his
mouth, having eaten up the rest of it: however, being young, and having
more strength than his mother, the mate got something down his throat,
and he began sensibly to revive; though by giving him, some time after, but
two or three spoonfuls extraordinary, he was very sick, and brought it
up again.

But the next care was the poor maid: she lay all along upon the deck,
hard-by her mistress, and just like one that had fallen down with an apo-
plexy, and struggled for life. Her limbs were distorted: one of her bands
was clasped round the frame of a chair; and she griped it so hard, that we
could not easily make her let it go: her other arm lay over her head, and
her feet lay both together, act test against the frame of the cabin-table: in
short, she lay just like one in the agonies of death, and yet she was alive too.

The poor creature was not only starved with hunger, and terrified with
the thoughts of death, but, as the men told us afterwards, was broken-
hearted for her mistress, whom she saw dying for two or three days before,
and whom she loved most tenderly. '

We knew not what to do with this poor girl; for when our surgeon, who
was a man of very great knowledge and experience, had, with great appli-
cation, recovered'her as to life, he had her upon his hands as to her senses;
for she was little less than distracted for a considerable time afier, as shall
appear presently. .

Whoever shall read these memorandum must be desired to consider that
visits at sea are not like a journey into the country, where sometimes people
stay a week or a fortnight at a place: our business was to relieve this dis-
tressed ship's crew, but not lie by for them; and though they were willing
to steer the same course with us for some days, yet we could carry no sail,
to keep pace with a ship that had no masts; however, as their captain begged
of us to help him to set up a main-topmast, and a kind of a topmast to his
Jury-foreman, we did, as it were, lie by him for three or four days; and
uteri, having given him five barrels at boot; a barrel of pork, two hogshesds
ot' biscuit, and a proportion of peas, flour, and what other things we could
spare, and taking three costs otsugnr, some rum, and some pieces ot' eight
{tom them for satisfaction, we left them; taking on board with us, at their
own earnest request, the youth and the maid, and all their goods>>

The young lad was about seventeen years of age; a pretty, well-bred,
modest, and sensible youth, greatly dejected with the loss of his mother, and,
as it seems, had lost his father, but a few months beibre, st Barbadoes: he
begged of the surgeon to speak to me to take him out of the ship; for he
said the cruel fellows had murdered his mother: and, indeed, so they had,
that is to say, passively; for they might have spared a small sustenance to
the poor helpless widow, that might have preserved her life, though it had
been but just enough to keep her alive: but hunger knows no friend, no
relation, no justice, no right; and theretbre is remorseless, and capable of
no compassion.

The surgeon told him how far we were going. and that it would carry
him away from all his friends, and put him perhaps in as bad circumstances
almost as those we found him in, that is to say, starring in the world. He
said it mattered not whither he went, it' he was but delivered from the
terrible crew that he was among ; that the captain (by which he meant me,
for he could know nothing of my nephew) had saved his life, and he was
sure would not hurt him; and as for the maid. he was sure, if she came to
hersell', she would he very thankful for it, let us carry them where we would.
The surgeon represented the case so atl'ectionntely to me, that! yielded, and
we toolt them both on board, with all their goods, except eleven hogsheeds
or sugar, which could not be removed or come at; and as the youth had a
bill of hiding for them, I made his commander sign a. writing, ohiiging him.
self to go, as soon as he come to Bristol, to one Mr. Rogers, a merchant
there, to whom the youth said he was related, and to deliver a letter which
I wrote to him, and all the goods he had belonging to the deceased widow;
which I suppose was not done, for I could never learn that the ship come to
Bristol, but was, as is most probable, lost at sea; being in so disabled a
condition, and so for from any land, that I am of opinion the first storm she
met with alter-wards she might founder in the see; for she was leaky, and
had damage in her hold, when we met with her.

1 was now in the latitude of 19 degrees 32 minutes, add had hitherto a
tolerable voyage as to weather, though, at first, the winds had been con.
trary. I shall trouble nobody with the little incidents of wind, weather,
currents, 8m, on the rest of our voyage; but, to shorten my story, for the
sake of what is to follow, shall observe, that I came to my old habitation,
the island, on the lOtlt'fif April, 3695. It was with no small difficulty that
I found the plane; for as I came to it, and went from it, before, on the south
nod east side of the island, as coming from the Bmzils; so now, coming in
between the main and the island, and having no chart for the coast. nor any
landmark, I did not know it when I saw it, or know whether I new at

or not.
We heat about a great while, and went on shore on several islands in the
mouth of the great river Oronooqne, but none for my purpose; only this I
learned by my coasting the shore, that l was under one great mistake before,
viz, that the continent which I thought I saw from the island I lived in we;
really no continent, but along island, or rather a ridge of islands, reaching
from one to the other side of the extended month of that great river; and
that the savages who came to my island were not properly those which we
call Carihhees, but islanders, and other barbarians of the some kind, who
inhabited something nearer to our side than the rest.\

to short, I visited several 0! these islands to no purpose; some i found
were inhabited, and some were not: on one of them I found some Spaniards,
and thought they had lived there; but, speaking with them, found they had
a sloop lay in a small creek hard-by, and came thither to make salt, and to
catch some pearl muscles, if they could; but that they belonged to the Isle
de Trinidad, which lay farther north, in the latitude of to and 1! degrees.

Thus coasting from one island to soother, sometimes with the ship. some
times with the Frenchmen's shallop, which we had found a convenient boat,
and therefore kept her with their very good will, at length Icame fair on
the south side of my island, and presently knew the very countenance of the
place: so I brought the ship safe to an anchor, broadside With the little
creek where my old habitation was.

As soon as! saw the place, I called for Friday, and asked him if he knew
where he was. He looked about a little, and presently, clapping his hands,
cried, '0 yes, 0 there! 0 yes, 0 there? pointingto our old habitation, and
, fell dancing and capering like a mad fellow: and 1 had much ado to keep
him from jumping into the sea. to swim ashore to the place.

' Well, Friday,' says I, 'do you think we shall find any body here or no t
and do you think we shall see your father? The fellow stood mote as a
stock a good while; but, when I named his father, the poor all'ectionate
creature looked dejected, and I could see the tears run down his thee very
plentifoily. ' What is the matter, Friday I" rays I; t are you troubled because
you may see your father? ' No, no,' says he, shaking his head, ' no see him
more: no. never more see him again 2' ' Why so,' cold l, ' ,Fridey ? how do
you know thett' '0 no, 0 no,' says Friday: ' he long ago die, long ago;he
much old man.' ' Well, well,' says 1, 'Friday. you don't know; but shall
we see any one else then l' The fellow, it seems, had better eyes then I, and
he points to the hill just above my old house; and, though we lay halls
league otl', he cries out, 'We see, we see: yes, yes, we see mock man
there, and there, and therel' I looked. hot I saw nobody. no, not with a
perspective glean which was, i suppose, because! could not hit theplace; for
the fellow was right, as I found upon inquiry the next day; and there were
five or six men all together, who stood to look at the ship, not knowing

what to think of as. . ' i i.
As soon as Friday told me he saw people, I caused the English ancient to

be spread, and fired three guns, to give them notice we were friends; and
in about half a quarter of an hour otter we perceived a smoke arise ltmn' the

side of the creek 3 so I immediately ordered the boat out. taking Friday with
me; and hanging out a white flag, or sting of truce, I went directly on
shore, taking with me the young frior I mentioned, to whom I had told the
ltory of my living there, and the manner ofit, and every particular both of
myself and those 1 left there; and who was, on that account, extremely
desirous to go with me. We had besides about sixteen men well armed, if
we had found any new guests there which we did not know of ; but we had

no need of weapons. '
As we went on shore upon the tide of flood, near high water, we rowed

directly into the creek; and the first maul fixed my eye upon was the
Spaniard whose life I had saved, and whom I knew by his face perfectly
well: as to his habit, I shall describe it anerwayds. I ordered nobody to go
on shore at first but myself; but there was no keeping Friday in the boat,
for the affectionate creature had spied his father at a distance, a good way
otl' the Spaniards, where indeed I saw 'nothing of him; and if they had not
let him go ashore, he would have jumped into the sea. He was no sooner
on shore, but he flew away to his father, like an arrow out of a how. It
would have made any man shed tears, in spite of the firmrst resolution. to
have seen the first transports of this poor fellow's joy when he come to his
father: how he embraced him, kissed him, stroked his thee, took him up
ll) his arms, set him down upon a tree, and lay down by him; then stood
and looked at him, as any one would look at a strange picture, for a quarter
of an hour together; then lay down on the ground, and stroked his legs,
and kissed them, and then got up again, and stared at him; one would
have thought the fellow hewitched. But it would have mode a dog laugh
the next day to see how his possum ran out nnottwr way: in the morning '
he walked along the shore, to and again, with his father, several hours, al-
ways leading him by the hand, as if he had been a lady; and every now
and then he would come to the boat to fetch something or other for him,
either a. lump of sugar, a drum, n hiseuit~eake, or something or other that
woe good. In the afternoon his frolioo ran another way ; for then he would
set the old man down upon the ground, and dance about him, and metre a
thousand antic postures and gestures; and all the while he did this he
would be talking to him, and telling him one story or other of his travels,
and of what had happened to him abroad, to divert him. In short, if the
same filial affection was to be found in Christians to their parents in our
part of the world, one would be tempted to say there would hardly have
been any need of the fifth commandment.

But this is a digression: 1 return to my landing. It would be needless to
take notice of all the ceremonies and eivilities that the Spaniards received
me with. The first Spaniard, who, as I said, I knew very well, was he
whose life I had saved: he came towards the boat, attended by one more,
carrying a flag of truce also; and he not only did not know me at first, but
he had no thoughts, no notion, of its being me that Was come, till I spoke to
him. 'Srignior,' said I, in Portuguese, 'do you not know me ?' At which
he spoke not a word, but, givmg his musket to the man that was with him,
threw his arms abroad. saying something in Spanish that I did not perfectly
but, came forward, and embraced me; telling me he was inexcusable not
to know that face again, that he had once seen as if an angel from heaven
' sent to save his life : he said abundance of very handsome things. as a well-
bred Spaniard always knows how; and then, beckoning to the person that
attended him, bade him go and call out his comrades. He then asked me if
I would walk to my old habitation, where he would give me posession of
nry own house again, and where I should see they had made but mean im-
provements: so I walked along with him; but, alas! I could no more find
the place again than if I had never- been there; for they had planted so many
trees, and placed them in such a posture, so thick and close to one another

and in ten years' time they were grown so big, that, in short, the place was
inaccessible, except by such windings and blind ways as they themselves
only, who made them, could find.

i asked them what put them upon all these hrtifications: he told me!
would say there was need enough of it, when they had given me an account
how they had passed their time since their arriving in the island, especially
alter they had the misfortune to find that I was gone. He told me he could--
not but have some satisfaction in my good fortune, when he heard that I was
gone in a gmd ship, and to my satisfaction; and that he had oilentimes a
strong persuasion that. one time or other, he should see me again; but no-
thing that ever befall him in his life, he said, was so surprising and omitting
to him at first, as the disappointment he was under when he came back to
the island, and found i was not there.

As to the three barbarians (so he called them) that were left behind, and
ot whom, he said, he had a long story to tell me, the Spaniards all thought
themselves much better among the savages, only that their number was so
small: 'and,' says he, ' had they been strong enough, we had been all long ago
In purgatory ;' and with that he crossed himself on the breast. ' But, sir;
says he, "I hope you will not be displeased when i shall tell you, how, forced
by necessity, we were obliged. for our own preservation, to disarm them, and
make them our subjects, who would not be content with being moderately
our masters, but would be our murderers.' I answered, ' I was heartily afraid
of it when I left them there, and nothing troubled me at my parting from
the island but that they were not come back, that I might have put them in
possession of every thing first. and felt the other: in a state of subjection, as
they deserved; but, if they had reduced them to it, I was very glad, and
should be very far from finding any fault with it: for I knew they were a
parcel of refractory nugovernahle villains, and were- iit for any manner-so!
mischief]. .

While I was thus saying this, the man came when he had sent-hook. end
with him eleven men more. In the dress they were in, it was impossible to
guess what nation they were of; buthe made all clear, both to them and
to me. First he turned to me, and, pointing to them, said, ' These, sir, are
some of the gentlemen who owe their lives to you; and then. turning to
them, and pointing to me. he let them know who I was; upon which they
all came up, one by one, not as if they had been sailors and ordinary 'ellowa,
and the like, but really as if they had been ambassadors of noblemen, and I
a monarch or great conqueror: their behaviour was to the last degree obliging
and courteous, and yet mixed with a manly majestic gravity, which very
well became them; and, in short, they had so much more manners than I,
that I scarce knew how to receive their civilities, much less how to return
them in kind.

The history of their coming to, and conduct in, the island, alter my going
away, is so very remarkable, and has so many incidents, which the former
part of my relation will help to understand, and which will, in most of the
particulars, refer to the accountl have already given, that I cannot but com-
mit them, with great delight, to the reading of those that come alter me.

I shall no longer trouble the story with a relation in the first person, which
will put me to the expense of ten thousand said 1'3, and said he's, and he told
me's, and I told liim's, and the like; but I shall collect the facts historically.
as near as I can gather them out of my memory, from what they related
to me, and from what I met with in my conversing with them and with
the place.

In order to do this succinctly, and as intelligibly as I can, I must go back
to the circumstances in which I left the islaml, and in which the persons were
of whom I am to speak. And, first, it is necessary to repeat, that I had sent
away Friday's father and the Spaniard (the two whose lives I had rescued
from the savages) in a large canoe, to the main, as I then thought it, to fetch
over the Spaniards companions that he left behind him, in order to save
them from the like calamity that he had been in, and in order to succour
them for the present; and that, if possible, we might together find some
way for our deliverance afterwards.

When I sent them away, I had no visible appearance of, or the least room to
hope for, my own deliverance, any more than I had twenty years before; much
less had 1 any fore-knowledge of what afterwards happened; I mean, of an
English ship coming on shore there to fetch me off; and it could not but be
a very great surprise to them, when they came back, not only to find that I
was gone, but to find three strangers left on the spot, possessed of all that I
had left behind me, which would otherwise have been their own.

The first thing, however, which I inquired into, that I might begin where
llcit off, was of their own part; and I desired he would give me a particu-
lar account of his voyage back to his countrymen with the boat, when I
sent him to fetch them over. He told me there was little variety in that
part, for nothing remarkable. happened to them on the way, having had
very calm weather, and a smooth sea. As for his countrymen, it could not
be doubted, he said, but that they were overjoyed to see him (it seems he was
the principal man among them, the captain of the vessel they had been
shipwrecked in having been dead some time); they were, he said, the more
surprised to see tum, because they knew that he was fallen into the hands of the
ravages, who, they were satisfied, would devour him, as they did all the rest
of their prisoners; that, when he told him the story of his deliverance, and
it what manner he was furnished for carrying them away, it was like a
dream to them, and their astonishment, he'said, was somewhat like that
of Joseph's brethren, when he told them who he was, and told them the story
of his exaltation in Pharaoh's court; but when he shewed them the arms,
the powder, the ball, and provisions, that he brought them for their journey
or voyage, they were restored to themselves, took a just share of the joy of
their deliverance, and immediately prepared to come away with him.

Their first business was to get canoes; and in this they were obliged not
to stick so much upon the honest part'of it, but to trespass upon their friendly
savages, and to borrow two large canoes, or periaguas, on pretence of going
out a fishing, or for pleasure. In these they came away the next morning.
It seems they wanted no time to get themselves ready; for they had no bag-
gage, neither clothes nor provisions, nor any thing in the world but what
they had on them, and a few roots to eat, of which they used to make
their bread.

They were in all three weeks absent; and, in that time, unluckily for

them, I had the occasion ofl'ered for my escape, as I mentioned in my other
part, and to get 06' from the island, leaving three of the most impudent,
hardened, ungoverned, disagreeable villains behind me, that any man could
desire to meet with; to the poor Spaniards' great grief and disappointment,
you may be sure.

The only just thing the rogues did was, that, when the Spaniards came
ashore, they gave my letter to them, and gave them provisions, and other
relief, as I had ordered them to do; also they gave them the long paper of
directions which I had left with them, containing the particular methods
which I took for managing every part of my life there; the way how I baked
my bread, bred up tame goats, and planted my corn; how I cured my grapes,
made my pots, and, in a word, every thing I did: all this, being written -
down, they gave to the Spaniards (two of them understood English well
enough); nor did they refuse to accommodate the Spaniards with any thing
else, for they agreed very well for some time. They gave them an equal ad-
mission into the house, or cave, and they began to live very sociably; and
the head Spaniard, who had seen pretty much of my methods, and Friday's
father together, managed all their affairs: but, as for the Englishmen, they
did nothing but ramble about the island, shoot parrots, and catch tortoises;
and, when they came home at night, the Spaniards provided their suppers
for them.

The Spaniards would have been satisfied with this, had the others but let
them alone; which, however, they could not find in their hearts to do long,
but, like the dog in the manger, they would not eat themselves, neither
would they let the others eat. The difi'erences, nevertheless, were at first
but trivial, and such as are.not worth relating; but at last it broke out into
open war; and it began with all the rudeness and insolence that can he
Imagined, without reason, without provocation, contrary to nature, and, in-

deed, to common sense: and though, it is true, the first relation of it came
as 2 E
from the Spaniards themselves, whom i may call the sccusers, yet, when I
came to-exnmine the fellows, they could not deny a word of it.

But, before i come to the particulars of this port, 1 must supply adefeet in
my former relation; end this wag! forgot to set down, among the rest, that,
just as we were weighing the anchor to set sail, there happened a little
quarrel on board of our ship, which 1 wan onca afraid would have turned to
a second mutiny ; nor was it appeased till the captain, rousing no his courage,
and taking us all to his assistance, parted them by force, and. making two of
the most refractory fellows prisoners, he laid them in irons; and, as they had
been active in the fonuer disorders, and let fall some ugly dangerous words.
the second time he threatened to carry them in irons to England, and have
them hanged there for mutiny, and running away with the ship. This, it
seems, though the captain did not intend to do it, frightened some other men
in the ship; and some of them lind put it into the heads of the rest that the
captain Only gave them good words for the present, till they should come to
some English port. and that then they should be all put into goal, and tried
for their lives. The mate got intelligence of this, and acquainted us with it;
upon which it was desired that l, who still passed for a grent'man among
them, should go down with the mate, and satisfy the men, and tell them that
they might be assured, if they behaved well the rest of the voyage, all they
had done for the time past should be pardoned. So I went, and, after
passing my honour's word to them, they appeared easy, and the more so
when I caused the two men that were in irons to he released and forgiven.

But this mutiny had brought us to an anchor for that night; the wind also
falling cnlm next morning, we found that our two men who had been
laid in irons had stole each of them a musket, and some other weapons (what
powder or shot they had we knew not), and had taken the ship's pinnace,
which was not. yet hauled up, and run away with her to their companions
in roguety on shore. As soon as we found this, I ordered the long-boat on
shore, with twelve men and the mate, and away they went to seek the
rogues; but they could neither find them nor any of the rest, for they all fled
into the woods when they saw the boat coming on shore. The mate was
once resolved, in justice to their rogurry, to have destroyed their plantations,
burned all their household stud' and furniture, and left them to shift without
it; but, having no orders, he let it all alone, lelt every thing as he found it.
and, bringing the pinnnee away, come on board without them. These two
men made their number live; but the other three villains were so much
more wickedthan they. that. after they had been two or three days together.
they turned the two newcomers out of doom to chill for themselves. and would
have nothing to do with them; nor could they, for a good while, be per-
suaded to give them any food : as for the Spaniards, they were not yet come.

When the Spaniards came first on shore. the business began to go forward:
the Spaniards would have persuaded the three English brutes to have taken
in their two countrymen again, that, as they said, they might be all one fa-
mily; but they would not hear of it: so the two poor fellows lived by them-v

or aoamson cansos. QIQ

selves; and, finding nothing but industry and application would make them
live comfortably, they pitched their tents on the north shore of the island,
but a little more to the west, to be out of danger of the savages, who always
landed on the east parts of the island.

Here they built them two huts; one to lodge in, and the other to lay up
their magazines and stores in; and the Spaniards having given them some
corn for seed, and especially some of the peas which I had left them, they.
dug, planted, and enclosed, after the pattern I had set for them all, and began
to live pretty well. Their first crop of corn was on the ground; and, though
it was but a little bit of land which they had dug up at first, having had but
a little time, yet it was enough to relieve them, and find them with bread.
and other eatables; and one of the fellows, being the cook's mate of the ship,
was very ready at making soup, puddings, and such other preparations as the
rice and the milk, and such little flesh as they got, furnished him to do.

They were going on in this little thriving posture, when the three ufi-
natural rogues, their own countrymen too, in mere humour, and to insult
them, came and bullied them, and told them the island was theirs; that the
governor, meaning me, had given them the possession of it, and nobody else
had any right to it; and that they should build no houses upon their ground,
unless they would pay rent for them.

The two men, thinking they were jesting at first, asked them to come in
and sit down, and see what fine houses they were that they had built, and
to tell them what rent they demanded; and one of them merrily said, if they
were the ground landlords, he hoped, if they built tenements upon their land,
and made improvements, they would, according to the custom of landlords,
grant a long lease; and desired they would get a scnvener to draw the
writings. One of the three, cursing and raging, told them they should see they
were not in jest; and, going to a little place at a distance, where the honest
men had made a fire to dress their victuals, he takes a firebrand, and claps
it to the outside of their hut, and very fairly set it on fire; and it would have
been all burnt down in a few minutes, if one of the two had not run to the
fellow, thrust him away, and trod the fire out with his feet, and that not '

_ without somegdifficulty too.

The fellow was in such a rage at the honest man's thrusting him away,
that he retumed upon him with a pole he had in his hand, and had not the
man avoided the blow very nimbly, and run into the but, he had ended his
days at once: His comrade, seeing the danger they were both in, ran in
afler him, and immediately they came both out with their muskets, and the '
man that was first struck at with the pole knocked the fellow down that
had begun the quarrel with the stock of his musket, and that before the '
other two could come to help him; and then, seeing the rest come at them,
they stood together, and, presenting the other ends of their pieces to them,
bade them stand 93'.

The others had fire-arms with them too; but one of the two honest
men, bolder than his comrade, and 'anade desperate by his danger, told
them, if they offered to move hand .orfToot, theywere dead men, and boldly220 me are men novanruaas

commanded them to lay down their arms. They did not, indeed, lay down
their arms, but, seeing him so resolute, it brought them to a parley, and
they consented to take their wounded man with them and be gone; and,
mdeed, it seems the fellow was wounded sufficiently with the blow. Bow~
ever, they were much in the wrong, since they had the advantage, that
they did not disarm them efi'efiually, as they might have done, and have
gone immediately to the Spaniards, and given them an account how the
rogua had treated them; for the three villains studied nothing but revenge,
and every day gave them some intimation that they did so.

But, not tchrowd this part with an account of the lesser part of the
rogueries, such as treading down their corn; shooting three young kids and
a she-goat, which the poor men had got to breed up tame for their store;
and, in a word, plaguing them night and day in this manner; it forced the
two men to such a desperation, that they resolved to fight them all three
the first time they had a fair opportunity. In order to this, they resolved to
go to the castle, as they called it (that was: my old dwelling), where the
three rogues and the Spaniards all lived together at that time, intending to
have a fair battle, and the Spaniards should stand by, to see fair play: so
they got up in the morning before day, and came to the place, and called the
Englishmen by their names, telling a Spaniard that answered, that they
wanted to speak with them.

It happened that, the day before, two of the Spaniards, having been in
the woods, had seen one of the two Englishmen, whom, for distinction. I
called the honest men, and he had made a and complaint to the Spaniards ot'
the barbarous usage they had met with from their three countrymen, and
how they had ruined their plantation, and destroyed their corn that they
had laboured so hard to bring forward, and killed the mileh-goat and their
three kids, which was all they had provided for their sustenance; and that
if he and his friends, meaning the Spaniards, did not assist them again, they
should be starved. When the Spaniards came home at night, and they were
all at supper, one of them tool: the freedom to reprove the three Englishmen,
though in very gentle and manneriy terms, and asked them how they could
be so cruel, they being harmless inoffensive fellows; that they were putting
themselves in a way to subsist by their labour, and that it had cost them a
great deal of pains to bring things to such perfection as they were then 1!).

One' of the Englishmen returned very briskly, 'What had they to 'do
there? that they came on shore without leave; and that: they should not
plant or build upon the island; it was none of their ground.' 'Why,' says
the Spaniard, very calmly. ' Seignior luglese, they must not starve! The
Englishman replied, like a rouglnhewn tarpaulin, 'They might starve and
be d-----d; they should not plant nor build in that place.' 'But what must
they'do then, seignior ?' said the Spaniard. Another of the brutes returned,
' Do? d--n them, they should be servants, and work for them.' ' But
how can you expect that of them I' says the Spaniard ; ' they arenot bought
with your money: you have no right to make them servants! The Bug-
lishman answered, 'The island was them; the governor .had given it'tothem, and no man had any thing to do there but themselves ;' and
with that swore by his Maker that they would go and burn all their new
huts; they should build none upon their land. 'Why, seignior; says the
Spaniard. ' by the same rule we must be your servants tool--t Aye,' says
the bold dog, ' and so you shall too. before we have done with you' (mining
two or three G--d d--n me'a in the proper jntervsls of his speech). The
Spaniard only smiled at that, and made hint no answer. However, this
little discourse had heated them; and, starting up, one says to the other,
(I think it was he they called Will Atkins) 'Come, Jack, let's goand have
t'other brush with 'em; we'll demolish their castle l'll warrant you; they
shall plant no colony in our dominions,'

Upon this they went all troopmg away, with every man a gun, apistol,
and a sword, and muttered some msolent things among themselves of what
they would do to the Spaniards too, when opportunity ofl'ered; but the
Spaniards, itseerns, did not so perfectly understand them as to know all the
particulars, only that, in general, they threatened them hard for taking the
two Englishmen's part.

Whither they went. or how they bestowed their time that evening, the
Spaniards said they did not know; but it seems they wondered about the
country part of the night, and then, lying down in the place which I used to
call my bower, they were weary, and overalept themselves. The case was
this; they had resolved to stay till midnight, and so to take the two poormen
when they were asleep, and, as they acknowledged afterwards, intended to
set tire to their huts while they were in them, and either burn them there'
or murder them as they came out. As malice seldom sleeps very sound, it
was very strange they should not have been kept awake.

However "the two men had also a design upon them, as I have said,
though a much fairer one than that of burning and murdering, it happened,
and very luckily for them all, that they were up. and gone abroad, before
the bloody-minded rogues came to their huts.

When they came there. and found the men gone, Atkins, who, it seems,
was the lbrwardest man, called out to his comrade, 'Ha, Jack, here's the
neat, but, d--u-n them, the birds are flown.' They mused awhile, to think
what should be the occasion of their being gone'febroad so soon. and sug-
gested presently that the Spaniards had given them notice of it ; and with
that they shook hands, and swore to one another that they would be re.
venged of the Spaniards. As soon as they had made this bloody bargain,
they PS1211 to work with the poor men's habitation: they did not set fire,
indeed, to any thing, but they pulled down both their houses, and pulled
them so limb from limb, that they lea not the least stick standing, or source
any sign on the ground where they stood: they tore all their little oalleeted
household sluil' in pieces, and threw every thing about in such a manner.
that the poor men allerwards found some of their thing: a mile ofi' their has
bitation. When they had done this, they pulled up all the young trees
Which the poor men had planted; pulled up an enclosure they had made tosea we use no onenruues

secure their cattle and their corn; and, in a word, sacked and plundered
every thing as completely as a horde of Tartan would have done.

The two men were, at this juncture, gone to find them out, and had re-
solved to tightthem wherever they had been, though they were but two to
three; so that, had they met, there certainly would have been bloodshed
among them; for they were all very stout resolute fellows, to give them
their due.

But Providence took more care to keep them asunder than they themselves
could do to meet; for. as if they had dogged one another, when the three
were gone thither, the two were here; and afterwards, when the two went
back to find them, the three were come to their old habitation again: we
shall see their difi'erent conduct presently. When the three came back like
thrions matures, flushed with the rage which the work they had been
about had put them into, they came up to the Spaniards, and told them
who: they had done, by way 06" soot? and bravado , and one of them step-
ping up to one of the Spaniards, as it" they had been a couple of boys at
play, takes hold of his hot as it was upon his head, and giving it n twirl
about, flooring in his face, says to him, ' And you, Seignior Jack Spaniard,
shall have the some sauce, if you do not mend your manners. . The Spaniard,
who, though a quiet civil man, was as brave a man as could he, and
withal a strong well-made man, looked at him for a good while, and then,
having no weapon in his hand, stepped gravely up to him, and, with one
blow of his list, knocked him down, as an ox is felled with a poleoaxe; at
which one of the rogues, as insolent' as the first, fired his pistol at the Spa-
ninrd immediately: he missed his body. indeed, for the bullets went through
his hair, but one of them touched the tip of his ear, and he bled pretty
much. The blood made the Spaniard believe he was more hurt than he
really wag'niid that put him into some heat, for before he noted all in a pen- I
feet calm; but, now resolving to go through with his work, he stooped, and
took the fellow": musket, whom he had knocked down, and wasjust going
toshoot the man who had tired at him, when the rest of the Spaniards,
being in the care, came out, and, calling to him not to shoot. they stepped
in, secured the other two, and took their arms from them.

When they were thus dissrmed, and found they had made all the Spaniards
their enemies, as well as their own countrymen, they began to cool, and,
giving the Spaniards better words, would have their arms again; but the
Spaniards, considering the feud that was between them and the other two _
Englishmen, and that it would be the best method they mold take to keep
them from killing one another,told them they would do them no hsm;'snd,
if they would live peaceably, they would be very willing to assist and 'uso-
date with them as they did before; but that they could not think ofgi'izing
them their arms again, while they appeared so resolved to do mischief with
them to their own countrymen, and had even threatened them all to make

them their servants.
The rogues were now no more capable to hear reason than to act with
reason, but, being. refused their arms, they went raving away, and raging
like madman, threatening what they would do, though they had no fire-
arms. But the Spaniards, despising their threatening, told them they
should take care how they otfered any injury to their plantation or cattle,'
for, if they did, they would shoot them as they would ravenous beasts,
wherever they lhund them; and, if they fell into their hands alive, they
should certainly be hanged. However, this was far from cooling them;
but away they went, raging andfivearing like fliriesof hell. As soon as they
were gone, the two men came back, in passion and rage enough also, though
of another kind; for having been at their plantation, and finding it all de-
molished and destroyed, as above, it will easily be supposed they had pro-
vocation enough. They could searce have room to tell their tale, the Spa-
niards were so eager to tell them theirs; and it was strange enough to find
that three men should thus bully nineteen, and receive no punishment
at all.

The Spaniards, indeed, despised them, and especially, having thus dis-

armed them, made light of their threatenings;_ but the two Englishmen: . v"

resolved to have their remedy against them, what pains soever it cod to" "
find them out. But the Spaniards interposed here too, and told them, that,

as they had disarmed them, they could not consent that they (the two)

should pursue them with fire-arms, and perhaps kill them. 'But,' said the

grave Spaniard, who was their governor, ' we will endeavour to make them

do you justice, if you will leave it to us: for there is no doubt but they will

come to us again, when their passion is over, being not able tosubsist without

oar assistance: we promise you to make no peace with them, without having

a full satisfaction for you; and upon this condition we hope you will promise ,
to use no violence with them, other than in your own defence. The two

Englishmen yielded to this very awkwardly, and with great reluctance;

but the Spaniards protested that they did it only to keep them from blood-

shed, and to make all easy at last. 'For,' said they, ' we are not so many of
us, here is room enough for us all, and it is a great pity we should not be

all good friends.' At length they did consent, and waited for the issue of

the thing, living for some days with the Spaniards; for their own habitation

was destroyed.

In about five days' time the three vagrants, tired with wandering, and
almost starved with hunger, having chiefly lived on turtles' eggs all that
while, came back to the grove; and finding my Spaniard, who, as I have
said, was'the governor, and two more with him walking by the side of the '
creek, they came up in a very submissive humble manner, and begged _to'
be received again into the family. The Spaniards used them civilly, but
told them they had acted so nnnaturally by their countrymen, and so very
grossly by them (the Spaniards), that they could not come to any conclusion
without consulting the two Englishmen and the rest; but, however, they
would 'go to them, and discourse about it, and they should know in half an
hour. It may be guess"! that they were very hard put to it; for, it seems,
as they were to wait this half-hour for an answer, they begged they would
send them outsot'ne bread in the mean time, which they did; sending, at
the same time, a large piece of goat's flesh, and a boiled parrot, which they
ate very heartily, for they were hungry enough.

Alter half an hour's consultation, they were ealled in. and a long debate
ensued; their two countrymen charging them with the ruin of all their la-
bour, and a design to murder them; all which they owned before, and
therefore could not deny now. Upon the whole, the Spaniards noted the
moderator between them; and, as they had obliged the two Englishmen not
to hurt the three while they were united and unarmed, so they now obliged
the three to go and rebuild their fellows' two huts, one to be of the saute,
and the other of larger dimensions than they were helbre; to fence their
ground again where they had pulled up their fences, plant trees in the
room of those pulled up, dig op the land again for planting corn where they
had spoiled it, and, in a word, to restore every thing in the same state as
they found it, as near as they could; for entirely it could not be, the season
for the corn, and the growth of the trees and hedges, not being possible to
be recovered. '

Well, they submitted to all this; and; as they had plenty of provisions
given them all the while, they grew very orderly, and the whole society
began to live pleasantly and agreeably together again; only that these
three fellows could never be persuaded to Work, I mean for themselves,
except now and then a little, just as they pleased: however, the Spaniards
told them plainly, that if they would but live sociably and friendly together,
and study the good of the whole plantation, they would be content to work
for them, and let them walk about and be as idle as they pleased : and thus,
having lived pretty well together for a month or two, the Spaniards gave
them arms again, and gave them liberty to go abroad with them as before.

It was not above a week alter they had these arms. and went abroad, but
the ungrateful creatures began to be as insolent and troublesome as before;
but, however. an accident happened presently upon this, which endangered
the safety of them all; and they were obliged to lay by all private resent.
meats, and look to thgpresemtion of their lives.

It happened "wright thatthe Spanish governor, as I call him, that is to
say, the Spaniard whom life I had saved, who was now the captain, or
leader, or governor of the rest, found himself very uneasy in the night, and
could by no means get any sleep: he was perfectly well in body, as he told
me the story, only found his thoughts tumultuous; his mind ran upon men
fighting and killing of one another, but he was broad awake, and could not
by any means get any sleep: in short, he lay a great while; but, growing
more and more uneasy, he resolved to rise. As they lay, being so many
of them, upon goats' shins laid thick upon such couches and pads as they
made for themselves, and not in hammocks and ship-beds, as! did, who was
but one, so they had little to do. when they were willing to rise. but to get
up upon theirfeet, and perhaps put on a coat, such as it was, and their
pumps, and they were ready for gomg any way that their thoughts guided
them. Being thus got up, he looked out; hut, being dark, he could see

little or nothing; and. besides, the trees which 1 had planted. as in my
former account is described, and which were now grown tall. intercepted
his sight, so that he could only look up. and see that it was a clear star-light
night, and, hearing no noise. he returned and laid him down again: but it
was all one; he could not sleep, nor could he compose himselfto any thing
like rest; but his thoughts were, to the last degree, uneasy, and he knew
not for what.

Having made some noise with rising and walking about, going out and
coming in, another of them waited, and. calling, asked who it was that was up.
The governor told him how it had been with him. ' Say you so ?' says the
other Spaniard; 'such things are not to be slighted, I assure you; there is
certainly some mischief working near us: and presently he asked him.

Where are the Englishmen t'-~ -~"I'hey are all in their huts; says he, ' safe
enough. ' it seems the Spaniards had kept possession of the main apartment.
and had made a place for the three Englishmen, who, since their last mutiny,
were always quartered by themselves, and could not come at the rest.
' \Veli,' says the Spaniard, 'there is something in it, I am persuaded, from
my own experience. I am satisfied our spirits embodied have a converse
with,'and receive intelligence from, the spirits unemhodicd, and inhabiting the
invisible world; and this friendly notice is given for our advantage, if we
knew how to make use of it. Come,' says he, 'let us go and look abroad;
and, if we and nothing at all in it to justify the trouble. I'll tell you a story
to the purpose, that shall convince you of the justice of my proposing it.

In a word, they went out, to go up to the top of the hill. where I used to
go, but they being strong, and a good company. not alone, as! was, used
none of my cautions to go up by the ladder, and, pulling it up alter them, to
goup a second stage to the top, but were going round through the grove,
unconcerned and unwary, when they were surprised with seeing alight, as
of fire, a very little way 03' from them, and hearing the voices of men, not of
one or two, but of a great number.

In all the discoveries I had made of the savages landing on the island, it
was my constant are to prevent them making the least discovery of there

able to give any account of it; for we disappeared assoon "possible; nor
did ever any that had seen me escape to tell any one else, exceptitwu
the three savages in our last encounter, who jumped into the boat; of whom,
I mentioned, I was afraid they should go home and bring more help
Whether it was the conseguenee of the escape of those men. that so great a
number come now together, or whether they came ignorantly, and by acci-
dent, on their usual bloody errand, the Spaniards could not, it seems. unden-
atand; but, whatever it was, it had been their business either to have con-
cealed themselves, or not to have seen their; at all, much less to have let the
savages have seen that there were any inhabitants in the place; or to have
fallen upon them so efl'ectnally, as. that not a-rnan of them should hire es-
caped, which could only have been by getting in between them and their

88 9 F
boats: but this presence of mind was wanting to them, which was the mo
of'their tranquillity for a great while.

W e need not doubt but that the governor and the man with him, surprised
with this sight, ran back immediately, and raised their fellows, giving them
an account of the imminent danger they were all in, and they again as readily
took the alarm; but it was impossible to persuade them to stay close within.
where they were, but they must all run out to see how things stood.

While it was dark, indeed, they were well enough, and they had oppor-
tunity enough, for some hours, to view them by the light of three fires they
had made at a distance from one another: what they were doing they knew
not, and what to do themselves they knew not; for, first, the enemy were
too many; and, secondly, they did not keep together, but were divided into
several parties, and were on shore in several places.

The Spaniard: were in no small consternation at this sight; and, as they
found that the fellows ran straggling all over the shore, they made no doubt
butifirst or lost, some of them would chop in upon their habitation, or upon
some other place where they would see the token of inhabitants; and they
were in great perplexity also for fear of their flock of goats, which would
have been little less than starving them, if they should have been destroyed;
to the first thing they resolved upon wan, to despatch three men away before
it was light, two Spaniards and one Englishman, to drive all the goats away
to the great valley where the nave was, and, il' need were, to drive them into
' the very cave itself. Could they have seen the savages altogether in one
body, and at :1 distance from their canoes. they resolved, if there had been a
hundred of them, to have attacked them; but that could not he obtained;
for they were some of them two miles 05' from the others; and, as it appeared
aflerwerds, were of two different nations.

Alter having mused a great while on the course they should take, and
beating their brains in considering their present circumstances, they resolved,
at last, while it was still dark, to send the old savage, Friday's father, out as
a spy, to learn, if possible, something concerning them; as what they came
for, what they intended to do, and the like. The old man readily undertook
it; and stripping himself quite naked, as moot of the savages were, away he
went. Alter he had been gone an hour or two, he brings word that he had'
been among them undiscovered ; that he found they were two parties, end
of two several nations, who had war with one another, and had a great battle
in their own country; and that both sides having had several prisoners taken
in the fight, they were, by mere chance, landed all on the some island, for
the devouring their prisoners and making merry; but their coming so by
chance to the some place had spoiled all their mirth : that they were in a
great rage at one another, and were so near, that he believed they would
fight again as soon as daylight began to appear; but he did not perceive
that they had any notion of any body being on the island hot themselves>>
He had hardly made an end of telling his story, when they could perceive,
by the unusual noise they made, that the two little armies were engaged in
a bloody fight. '
'Fn'dsy's' father used all the arguments he min to persuade our people to
lie closgnnd not be seen : he told them their safety consisted in it. and that
they had nothing to do but lie still, and the savages would kill one another
to their hands, and then the rest whuld go away; and it was so to a tittle.
But it was impossible to prevail, especially upon the Englishmen; their
curiosity was so importuuate upon their prudential; that they must run out
and see the battle: however, they used some caution too; viz, they did not
go openly, just by their own dwelling, but went further into the woods, sod
placed themselves to advantage, where they might securely see them manage
the tight, and. as they thought, not be seen by them; but it seems the so>>
vsg'es did see them, as we shall find hereafter

The battle was very fierce , and, if I might believe the Englishmen, one
of them itsid he could perceive that some of them were men of great bravery,
of invincible spirits, and ol' great policy in guiding the fight. The battle,
they said, held two hours before they could guess which party would be
beaten; but then that party which was nearest our people's habitation began
to appear weakest, and, utter some time more, some of them began to fly;
and this put our men again into a great consternation, lest any one of those
that fled should run into the grove before their dwelling for shelter, and
thereby involuntarily discover the place; and that, by consequence. the .
pursues: would do the like in search of them. Upon this they resolved that
they would stand armed within the wall; and whoever came into the grove
they resolved to sally out over the wall and kill them: so that, if possible,
not one should return to give an account of it: they ordered also thatit
should he done with their swords, or by knocking them down with the-
stocks of their musket; but not by shooting them, for fear of misidg an alarm
by the noise.

As they expected, it fell out: three of- the routed army fled for life. and,
crossing the creek, ran directly into the place, not in the least knowing
whither they went, but running as into a thick wood for shelter. The scout
they kept to look abroad gave notice of this within, with this addition. to
our men's great satisfaction, viz, that the conquerors had not pursued them,
- or seen which way they were gone. 'Upon this, the Spaniard governor, s
man of humanity, would not sufl'er them to kill the three fugitives, but,
sending three men out by the top of the hill, ordered them to go round, couple
in behind them, and surmise and take them prisonem, which was done. The
residue of the conquered people fled to their canoes, and got 08' to sea. The
victors retired, made no pursuit, or very little, but drawing themselves into
a body together, gave two great screaming shouts, which they supposed was
by way of triumph, and so the fight- ended: snd the some day, about three

o"cloclt to the afternoon, they also marched to their <<noes. And thus the
Spaniards had their island again free to themselves, their fright was over,
and they saw no savages in several years after.

After they were all gone, the Spaniards came out of their den, sod, viewing
the field of battle, they toun'd about two-andathirty men dead on the spot:

' some were killed with great long-arrows, some of which were found sticking
in their bodies; but most of them were killed with great wooden swords,
sixteen or seventeen of which they found in the field of battle, and as many
bows, with a. great many arrows. These swords were strange, great, un-
wieldy things, and they must be very strong men that used them : most of
those men that were killed with them had their heads mashed to pieces, as
we may say, or, as we call it in English, their brains knocked out, and several
their arms and legs broken; so that it is evident they fight with inexpres-
sible rage and fury. We found not one man that was not stone-dead; for
either they stay by their enemy till they have quite killed him, or they carry
all the wounded men that are not quite dead away with them.

This deliverance tamed our Englishmen for a great while; the sight had

filled them with horror, and the consequences appeared terrible to the last
degree, especially upon supposing that some time or other they should fall
into the hands of those creatures, who would not only kill them as enemies,
but kill them for food, as we kill our cattle; and they professed to me that
the thoughts of being eaten up like beef or mutton, though it was supposed
it was not to be till they were dead, had something in it so horrible, that it
nauseated their very stomachs, made them sick when they thought of it, and
filled their minds with such unusual terror, that they were not themselves
for some weeks alter. This, as I said, tamed even the three English brutes
I have been speaking of, and, for a great while afier, they were tractable,
and went about the common business of the whole society well enough;
planted, sowed, reaped, and began to be all naturalized to the 'country. But,
some time after this, they fell into such simple measures again as brought
them into a great deal of trouble.
' They had taken three prisoners, as I observed; and these three, being lusty
stout young fellows, they made them servants, and taught them to work for
them; and, as slaves, they did well enough; but they did not take their
measures with them as I did by my man Friday, viz.,.to begin wrth them
upon the principle of having saved their lives, and then instruct them in the
rational principles of life; much less of religion, civilizing, and reducing
them by kind usage and afi'ectionate arguings; but, as they gave them their
food every day, so they gave them their work too, and kept them fully em-
ployed in drudgery enough; but they failed in this by it, that they never
had them to assist them, and fight for them, as I had my man Friday, who
was as true to me as the very flesh upon my bones. '

But, to come to the family part. Being all now good friends, (for common
danger, as I said above, had effectually reconciled them,) they began to con"-
sider their general circumstances; and the first thing that came under their
consideration was, whether, seeing the savages particularly haunted that side
of the island, and that there were more remote and retired parts of it equally
adapted to their way of living, and manifestly to their advantage, they should
not rather move their habitation, and plant in some more proper place for
their safety, and especially for the security of their cattle and corn.

Upon this, afler long debate, it was concluded that they would not remove
their habitation; because that, some time or other, they thought they might
hear from their governor again, meaning nae'; and, if I should send any one
to seek them, I should be sure to direct them to that side; where, if they
should find the place demolished, they would conclude the savages had killed
us all, and we were gone, and so our supply would go too. But, as to their
corn and cattle, they agreed to remove them into the valley where my cave
was, where the land was as proper for both, and where, indeed, there was
land enough: however, upon second thoughts, they altered one part of their
resolution too, and resolved only to remove part of their cattle thither, and
plant part of their corn there; and so, if one part was destroyed, the other
might be saved. And one part of prudence they used, which it was very
well they did, viz, that they never trusted those three savages, which they
had prisoners, with knowing any thing of the plantation they had made in
that valley, or of any cattle they had there, much less of the cave there, which
they kept, in case of necessity, as a safe retreat; and thither they carried
also the two barrels of powder which I had sent them at my coming away.
But, however, they resolved not to change their habitation; yet they agreed,
that as I had carefully covered it first with a wall or fortification, and then
with a grove of trees, so, seeing their safety consisted entirely in their being
concealed, of which they were now fully convinced, they set to work to
cover and conceal the place yet more effectually than before. For this pur-
pose, as I planted trees, or rather thrust in stakes, which in time all grew up
to be trees, for some good distance before the entrance into my apartments,
they went on in the same manner, and filled up the rest of that whole space
of ground, from the trees I had set, quite down to the side of the creek, where,
as I said, I landed my floats, and even into the very ooze where the tide
flowed, not so much as leaving any place to land, or any sign that there ha'
been any landing thereabout: these stakes also, being of a Wood very forward
to grow, as I have noted formerly, they took care to have them generally
much larger and taller than those which I had planted; and as they grew
apace, so they planted them so very thick and close together, that, when they
had been three or four years grown, there was no piercing with the eye any
considerable way into the plantation: and, as for that part which I had
planted, the trees were grown as thick as a man's thigh; and among them
they placed so many other short ones, and so thick, that, in a word, it stood
like a pallisado a quarter of a mile thick, and it was next to impomble to
penetrate it but with a little army to cut it all down; for a little dog could
hardly get between the trees, they stood so close.

But this was not all; for they did the same by all the grouad to the right
hand and to the left, and round even to the top of the hill, leaving no way,
not so much as for themselves, to come out, but by the ladder placed up to
the side of the hill, and then lified up, and placed again from the first stage
up to the top; and, when the ladder was taken down, nothing but what had
wings or witchcraft to assist it' could come at them. This was excellently
well contrived; nor was it less than what they afierwards found occasion
for; which served to oongince me, that, as human prudence has the authority
of Providence to. justify it, so it has doubtless the direction of Providence to
set it to work; and, if we listened carefully to the voice of it, lam persuaded
we might prevent many of the disasters which our lives are now, by our own
negligence. subjected to: but this by the way.

I return to the story--They lived two years after this in perfect retire-
ment, and had no more visits from the savages. They had, indeed, an alarm
given them one morning, which put them into a great consternation; for
some of the Spaniards being out early one morning on the west side, or
rather end, of the island (which was that end where I never went, for fear
of being discovered), they were surprised with seeing above twenty canoes
ofilndians just coming on shore. They made the best of their way home, in
hurry enough ; and, giving the alarm to their comrades, they kept close all
that day and the next, going out only at night to make their observation:
but they had the good luck to be mistaken; for, wherever the savages went,
they did not land that time on the island, but pursued some other design.

And now they had another broil with the three Englishmen; one of whom,
a most turbulent fellow, being in a rage at one of the threeslaves, which I
mentioned they had taken, because the fellow had not done something right
which he bid him do, and seemed a little untractable in his shewing him,
drew a hatchet out of a' frog-belt, in which he wore it by his side, and fell
upon the poor savage, not to correct him, but to kill him. One of the
Spaniards, who was by, seeing him give the fellow a barbarous cut with the
hatchet, which be aimed at his head, but struck into his shoulders, so that
he thought he had cut the p00r creature's arm 03', ran to him, and, entreating
him not to murder the poor man, placed himself between him and the savage,
to prevent the mischief. The fellow, being enraged the more at this, struck
at the Spaniard with his hatchet, and swore he would serve him as he in-
tended to serve the savage; which the Spaniard perceiving, avoided the
blow, and with a shovel, which he had in his hand (for they were all working
in the field about their corn-land), knocked the bruteildwn. Another of
the Englishmen, running at the same time to help his comrade, knocked the
Spaniard down; and then two Spaniards more came in to help their man,
and a third Englishman fell in upon them. They had none of them any
fire-arms. or any other weapons but hatchets and other tools, except this
third Englishman: he had one of my rusty cutlasses, with which he made
at the two last Spaniards, and wounded them both. This fray set thgwhole
family in an uproar, and, more help coming in, they took the three English-
men prisoners. The next question was, what should be done with them?
They had been so often mutinous, and were so very furious, so desperate, and
so idle withal, they knew not what course to take with them, for they were
mischievous to the highest degree, and valued not what hurt they did to any
man; so that, in short, it was not safe to live with them. _

The Spaniard who was governor told them, in so many words, that if they
had been of his own country, he would have hanged them; for all laws and
all governors were to preserve society, and those who were dangerous to the
society ought to be expelled out of it; but as they were Englishmen and
that it was to the generous kindness of an Englishman that they all owed
their preservation and deliverance, he would use them with all possible lenity,
and would leave them to the judgment of the other two Englishmen, who
were their countrymen.

One of the two honest Englishmen stood up, and said they desired it
might not be let! to them; ' for,' says he, ' I am sure we ought to sentence
them to the gallows :' and with that he gives an account how Will Atkins,
one of the three, had proposed to have all the five Englishmen join together,
and murder all the Spaniards when they were in their sleep.

When the Spanish governor heard this, he calls to Will Atkins, ' How,
Seignior Atkins, would you murder us all? What have you to say to that 2'
The hardened villain was so far from denying it, that he said it was true:
and, G--d d--n him, they would do it still, before they had done with them.
' Well, but Seignior Atkins,' says the Spaniard, ' what have we done to you,
that you will kill us? And what would you get by killing us? And what
must we do to prevent your killing us? Must we kill you, or you kill us?
Why will you put us to the necessity of this, Seignior Atkins? says the
Spaniard very calmly, and smiling. Seignior Atkins was in such a rage at
the Spaniard's making a jest of it, that, had he not been held by three men,
and withal had no weapon near him, it was thought he would have at--
tempted to have killed the Spaniard in the middle of all the company. This
hair-brain carriage obliged them to consider seriously what was to be done:
the two Englishmen, and the Spaniard who saved the poor savage, were of
the opinion that they should hang one of the three, for an example to the
rest; and that particularly it should be he that had twice attempted to '
commit murder with his hatchet; and, indeed, there was some reason to
believe he had done it, for the poor savage was in such a miserable condition,
with the wound he had received, that it was thought he could not live. But
the' governor Spaniard still said ' No; it was an Englishman that had saved
all their lives, and he would never consent to put an Englishman to death,
though he had murdered half of them; nay,' he said, ' if he had been killed
himself by an Englishman, and had time left to speak, it should be that they
should pardon him.'

This was so positively insisted on by the governor Spaniard, that there
was no gainsaying it; and as merciful counsels are most apt to prevail, where
they are so earnestly pressed, so they all came into it; but then it was to be
considered what should be done to keep them from doing the mischief they
designed; for all agreed, governor and all, that means were to be used for
preserving the society from danger. Afier a long debate, it was agreed,
first, that they should be disarmed, and not permitted to have either gun,
powder, shot, sword, or any weapon; and should be turned out of the so-
ciety, and lefi to live where they would, and how they would, by themselves;
but that none of the rest, either Spaniards or English, should converse with
them, speak with them, or have any thing to do with them: that they should
be forbid to come within a certain distance of the place where the rest dwelt;
and if they ofi'ered to commit any disorder, so as to spoil, burn, kill, or
destroy, any of the corn, plantings, buildings, fences, or cattle, belonging to232 TBE use AND soven'runns

the society, they should die without mercy. and they would shoot them
wherever they could find them.

The governor, a man of great humanity, musing upon the sentence, con-
sidered a little upon it; and turning to the two honest Englishmen, said.
' Bold; you must reflect. that it will be long ere they can raise com and
mule of their own, and they must not starve; we must, therefore, allow them
provisions :' so be caused to he added, that they should have a proportion of
corn given them to last them eight months, and for seed to sow, by which
time they might be supposed to raise some of their own ; that they should
have six milch-goats, four lie-goats, and six. kids given them, as well for
present subsistence as for a store; and that they should have tools given them
for their work in the fields, such as six hatchets, an adze, a saw, and the
like; but they should have none of these tools or provisions. unless they
would swear solemnly that they would not hurt or injure any of the Spaniards
with them, or of their fellow Englishmen.

Thus they dismissed them the society, and turned them out to shift for
themselves. They went away sullen and refractory. as neither content to
go away not to stay; but, as there was no remedy, they went, pretending
to go and choose a place where they would settle themselves; and some pro-
visions were given them, but no weapons.

About four or five days after, they came again for some vietuels, and gave
the governor an account where they had pitched their tents, and marked
themselves out a habitation and plantation; and it was a very convenient
place, indeed, on the remotest part of the island, N.E., much about the place
where I providentially landed in my first voyage, when I was driven out to
sea, the Lord alone knows whither, in my foolish attempt to sail round the
island.

Here they built themselves two handsome huts, and contrived them in a
manner like my first habitation. being close under the side of a hill, having
some trees growing already on three sides ol' it, so that by planting others,
it would be very easily covered from the sight, unless narrowly searched for.
They desired some dried goats'-skins, for beds and covering, which were
given them; and upon giving their words that they would not disturb the
rest, or injure any of their plantations, they gave them hatchets, and what
other tools they could spare; some peas, barley. and rice, for sewing; and.
in a word, any thing they wanted, except arms and ammunition.

They lived in this separate'condition about six months, and had got in
their first harvest, though the quantity was but small, the parcel of land they
had planted being but little; for, indeed, having all their plantation to form,
they had a great deal of work upon their hands; and, when they came to
make boards and pots, and such things, they were quite out of their element.
and could make nothing of it: and when the rainy season came on. for want
of a cave in the earth, they could not keep their grain dry. and it was in
great danger of spoiling; and this humbled them much: so they come and
begged the Spaniards to help them, which they very readily did; and in
{our days worked a. great hole in the side of the hill for them, big enough to
secure their corn and other things from the rain; but it was but a poor place.
at best, compared to mine, and especially as mine was then, for the Spaniards
had' greatly enlarged it, and made several new apartments in it.

About three quarters of a year alter this separation, a new frolic took these
rogues, which, together with the former villany they had committed, brought
mischief enough upon them, and had very near been the ruin of the whole
colony. The three new associates began, it seems, to be weary of the labo-
rious life they led, and that, without hope of bettering their circumstances;
and a whim took them, that they would make a voyage to the continent.
from whence the savage: came, and would try if they could seize upon some
prisoners among the natives there, and bring them home, so to _make them
do the laborious part of their work for them.

The project was not so preposterous, if they had gone no farther: but they
did nothing, and proposed nothing, but had either mischief in the design, or
mischief in the event: and, if I may give my opinion, they seemed to be
under a blast from Heaven; for, if we will not allow a visible curse topursue
visible crimes, how shall we reconcile the events of things With the divine
justice t It was certame an apparent vengeance on their crime of mutiny

. and piracy that brought them to the state they were in; and they showed
not the least remorse for the crime, but added new villanies to it, such as the
piece of monstrous cruelty of wounding a poor slave, because he did not, or
perhaps, could not, understand to do what he directed, and to wound him in
such a manner as made him a cripple all his life, and in a place where no
surgeon or medicine could be had for his cure; and what was still worse,-
the murderous intent, or, to do justice to the crime,,the intentional murder
for such to be sure it was, as was afterwards the formed design they all laid,
to murder the Spaniards in cold blood, and in their sleep. '

But 1 leave observing, and return to the story :--The three fellows came.
down to the Spaniards one morning, and in very humble terms desired to be
admitted to speak with them: the Spaniards very readily heard what they
had to say, which was this :--That they were tired of living in the manner
they did; and that they'were not handy enough to make the necessaries they
wanted, and that having no help, they found they should be starved; but, i.'
the Spaniards would give them leave to take one of the canoes which they
came over in, and give them arms and ammunition proportioned to their
defence, they would go over to the main and seek their fortunes, and so de-
liver them from the trouble of supplying them with any other provisions.

The Spaniards were glad enough to get rid of them, but very honestly
represented to them the certain destruction they were running into; told
them they had suffered such hardships upon that very spot, that they could.
without any spirit of prophecy, tell them they would be starved, or mur-
dered, and bade them consider of it.

The men replied audaciously, they should be starved if they staid here,
for they could not work, and would not work, and they could but be starved
abroad; and if they were murdered, there was an end of them; they had no
wives or children to cry alter them : and, in short, insisted importunstely upon

88 2 G
their demand; declaring they would go, whether they would give them any
arms or no.

The Spaniards told them, with great kindness, that if they were resolved
to go, they should not go like naked men, and be in no condition to defend
themselves 2 and that though they could ill spare their tire-arms, having- not
enough for themselves, yet they would let them have two machete, a pistol,
and a cutlass. and each man a hatchet, which they thought was audieient
for them. In a word, they accepted the ofi'er; and having baked them
bread enough to serve them a month, and given them as much goats'-tlcsh
as they could eat while it was sweet, and a great basket of dried grapes, a
pot of fresh water, and a young kid alive, they boldly set out in the canoe
for a voyage over the sea, where it was, at least, forty miles broad. '

The boat, indeed, was a large one, and would very well have untried
fifteen or twenty men, and therefore was rather too big for them to manage;
out, as they had a fair breeze, and flood-tide with them, they did well enough.
They had made a mast of a long pole, and a sell of four large goats'okins
dried, which they had sewed or laced together; and away they went merrily
enough: the Spaniards called after them, Ban reyajo : and no man ever
thought of seeing them any more.

The Spaniards were often saying to one another, and to the two honest
Englishmen who remained behind, how quietly and comfortably they lived,
now these three turbulent fellows were gone; as for their coming again,
that was the remotest thing from their thoughts that could be imagined;
when, behold, after two-and-twenty days' absence, one of the Englishmen,
being abroad upon his planting work, some three strange men coming to-
wards him at a. distance, with guns upon their shoulders.

Away runs the Englishman, as if he was hewitched, comes frightened
and amazed to the governor Spaniard, and tells him they were all undone.
for there were strangers landed upon the island, but could not tell who.
The Spaniard, pausing awhile, says to him, ' How do you mean, you cannot
tell who? They are the savages to be sure '--' No, no; says the Englishman ,
' they are men in clothes, with arms. '---' Nay then; says the Spaniard, ' why
are you eonoerned 7 if they are not savages, they must be friends , for there."
is no Christian nation upon earth but will do us good rather than harm.

\Vbile they were debating thus, came the three Englishmen, and standing
without the wood, which was new planted, hallooed to them: they pre-
sently knew their voices, and so all the wonder of that kind ceased. But
now the admiration was turned upon another question, viz, What could be
the matter. and what made them come back again?

It was not long before they brought the men in, and inquiring where they
had been, and what they had been doing, they gave them a full account of
their voyage in a few words, viz, That they reached the land in two days,
or something less; but finding the people alarmed at their coming, and pro.
paring with bows and arrows to tight them, they durst not go onshore, but
sailed on to the northward six or seven hours, till they came to a great open}-
ing, by which they perceived that the land they saw from our island "asor sosmson 930503. 985

not the main, but an island; upon entering that opening of the see, they
saw another island on the right hand, north, and several more west: and
being resolved to land somewhere, they put over to one of the islands which
lay west, and went boldly on shore: that they found the people very courv
teous and friendly to them; and that they gave them several roots and some
dried fish, and appeared very sociable: and the women as well as the men,
were very forward to supply them with any thing they could get for them
to out, end brought it to them a great way upon their heads. '

They motioned here four days; and inquired, as well as they could of
them. by signs, what nations were this way and that way; and were told
of several fierce and terrible people that lived almost every way, who,'a
they made known by signs to them. used to eat men; but as for themselves
they said, they never eat men or women, except only such as they took in
the was; and then, they owned, they made a great feast, and ate their
prisoners.

The Englishman inquired when they had had a feast of that kind; and
they told them about two moons ago, pointing to the moon, and to two
fingers; and that their great hing had two hundred prisoners now, which
he had token in his war, and they were feeding them to make them fat for
the next feast. The Englishmen seemed mighty desirous of seeing those
prisoners; butthe others mistaking them, thought they were desirous to
have some of them to carry away {or their own eating: so they beckoned
tothexn, pointing to the setting ofthe sun, and then to the rising; which
was to signify, that the next morning at sun-rising they would bring some
for them; and, accordingly, the next. morning, they brought down five
women and eleven men, and give them to the Englishmen. to curry with
them on their voyage, just as we would bring so many cows and oxen down
to s sea-port town to victual a ship.

. As brutish and barbarous as these fellows were at home, their stomachs
turned at this sight, and they did not know what to do. To refuse the priv
seven would have been the highest affront to the savage gentry that could

. be offered them, and what to do with them they knew not. However, aster
some debate, they resolved toaooept ofthem; and, in return, they gave
the savages that brought them, one of their hatchets, an dd key, a knife,
and six or seven of their bullets; which, though they did not understand

their use, they seemed particularly pleased with; and then tying the poor
.ereatures' hands behind them, they dragged the prisoners into the host for

our men.
The Englishmen were obliged to come away as soon as they had than,

orelse they that gave them this noble present would certainly have expected
that they should have gone to work with them, have killed two or three or

them the next morning, and perhaps have invited the donors to dinner. But
having taken their leave, with all the respect and thanks that could well
pass between people, where, on either side, they understood not one word
they could say, they put ofl'with their boat, sndcsme book towerdithp
first island; where, when they armed, they set eight of their primers at
liberty, there being too many of them for their occasion

In their voyage, they endeavoured tohave some communication with their
prisoners; but it was impossible to make them understand any thing 3 no-
thing they could say to them, or give them, or do for them, but was looked
upon asgoing to murder them, They first ofall unbound them; but the
poor creatures screamed at that, especially the women,'as if they hadjust
felt the knife at their throats; for they immediately concluded they were
unbound on purpose to be killed. If they gave them any thing to eat, it
was the same thing; they then concluded, it was for fear they should sink
in flesh, and so not be fat enough to kill. If they looked at one of them
more particularly, the party presently concluded. it was to see whether he
or she was fattest, and fittest to kill first: nay, alter they had brought them
quite over, and began to use them kindly, and treat them well, still they
expected every day to make a dinner or supper {or their new masters.

When the three wanderers had given this unaccountable history or journal
of their voyage, the Spaniard asked them where their new family was; and
being told that they had brought them on shore, and put them into one of
their huts, and were come up to beg some virtual: for them, they (the
Spaniards) and the other two Englishmen, that is to say, the whole colony,
resolved to go all down to the place and see them; and did so, and Friday's
father with them.

When they came into the hut, there they not all bound; for when they
had brought them on shore, they bound their hands, that they might not
take the boat and make their escape; there, I say, they sat, all of them
stark naked. First, there were three men, lusty, comely fellows, well~
shaped, straight and fair limbs, about thirty to thirty~five years of age; and
five women, whereof two might be from thirty to forty ; two more not above
four or hound--twenty; and the filth, a tall comely maiden, about sixteen
or seventeen. The women were well favoured, agreeable persons, both in
shape and features, only tawny; and two ofthem, had they been perfect
white, would have passed for very handsome women, even in London itsell;
having pleasant agreeable countenances, and ofa very, modest behaviour:
especially when they came afterwards tohe clothed and dressed, as they
called it, though that dress was very indifferent, it must be confessed; of
which lrerealter.

The sight, you may he sure, was something uncouth to our Spaniards,
who were, to give them a just character, men of the best behaviour, of the
amt calm, sedate tempers, and perfect good-humour, that ever! met with;
and, in particular, of the most modesty, as will presently appear: I say.
the sight was very uncouth, to see three naked men and five naked women.
all together bound, and in the most miserable circumstances that human ua~
tare could be supmed to be, via, to be expecting every moment to be
dragged out, and have their brains knocked out, and then to be eaten up
like a calf that' is killed fora dainty.

The first thing they did was to cause the old Indian, Friday' s father, to
go in, and see, first, if he knew any of them, and then if he understood any
of their speech. As soon as the old man came in. he looked seriously at
them, but knew none of them, neither could any of them understand a word
he said, or a sign he could make, except one of the women. However,
this was enough to answer the end, which was to satisfy them that the men
into whose hands they were fallen were Christians; that they abhorred
eating men or women; and that they might be sure they would not be
killed. As soon as they were assured of this, they discovered such a joy,
and by such awkward gestures, several ways, as is hard to describe; for,
it seems, they were of several nations.

The wonian who was their interpreter was bid, in the next place, to ask
them if they were willing to be servants, and to work lbr the men who had
brought them away, to save their lives; at which. they all fell a dancing:
and presently one fell to taking up this, and another that, any thing that lay
next, to carry on their shoulders, to intimate that they were willing to work.

The governor, who found that the having women among them would
praently be attended with some inconvenience, and might occasion some
strife, and perhaps blood, asked the three men what they intended to do
with these women, and how they intended to use them, whether as servants
or as women? One of the Englishmen answered very boldly and readily,
that they would use them as both; to which the governor said. 1 am not
going to restrain you from it; you are your own masters as to that; but this
I think is but just, for avoiding' disorders and quarrels among you, and I
desire it ofyou for that reason only, viz" That you will all engage, that it
any of you take any of these women, as a woman or wife, that he shall take
but one: and that having taken one, none else shall- touch her; for though
we cannot marry any one of you, yet it is but reasonable that while you stay
here, the woman any of you takes should he maintained by the man that
takes her, and 'should be his wife; I mean, says he, while he continues here,
and that none else shall have any thing to do with her. All this appeared so
just, that every one agreed to it without any ditlicnlty.

Then the Englishman asked the Spaniards it" they designed to take any of
them? But every one of them answered no: some of them said they had
wives in Spain, and the others did not like women that were not Christians:
and all together declared that they would not touch one of them : which in.
an instance of such virtue as I have not met mth in all my travels. On the
other hand, to be short, the live Englishmen took them every one a wife:
that is to say, a temporary wife , and so they set up a new form of living ,
for the Spaniards and Friday's father lived in my old habitation, which they
had enlarged exceedingly within. The three servants which were taken" in
the late battle ofthe savages lived with them; and these ears-led on the rosin
part of the colony, supplied all the rest with food, and assisted them in any
thing as they could, or as they found necessity required.
~ But the wonder of this story was, how five such refractory, ill-matched
fellows should agree about these women, and that two of them ohould not

pitch upon the same woman, especially seeing two or three of them were,238 The LIFE as>> ism-nineties

without comparison, more agreeable than the others: but they took a good
way enough to prevent quenching nmcmg themselves; for they set the five
women by themselves in one of their huts, and they went all into the other
hut, and drew lots among; them who should choose first. .

tie that drew to choose first went away by himself to the hot where-tho
poor naked creatures were, anil'l'etclicd out her he chose; and it was worth oh-
serving, that he that chose first took her that was reckoned the homeliest and
oldest of the five, which made mirth enough among the rest: and even the
Spaniards laughed at it: but the. fellow considered better than any of them,
that it was application and business they were to expect assistance in, as
much as any thing else; and she proved the best wife of all the parcel.

"'hen the poor women sow themselves set in a row thus, and fetched out
one by one, the terrors of their condition returned upon them again, and they
firmly believed they were now going to be devoured. Accordingly, when
the English sailor came in and fetched out one of them, the rest set up a.
most lamentable cry, and hung about her, and took their leave of her with
such agonies and afl'ection, as would have grieved the hardest heart in the
world; nor was it possible for the Englishmen to satisfy them that they were
not to be immediately unordered, till they fetched the old man, Friday's fa-
ther, who immediately let. them know that the five men, who had fetched
them out one by one, had chosen them for their wives.

When they had done, and the fright the women were in was a little over,
the men went to work, and the Spmtiards came and helped them; and in a.
few hours they had built them every one a new hut or tent for their lodging
apart; for those they had already were crowded with their tools, household
stuff, and provisions. The three wicked one: had pitched farthest 03', and
the two honest ones nearer, but both on the north shore of the island, so that
they continued separated as before; and thus my island was peopled in three
places; and, as I might say, three towns were begun to be built.

And here it is well worth observing, that, as it oflcn happens in the world
(what the wise ends of God's providence are in such a dismsition of things,
I cannot say), the two honest fellows had the two worst wires; and the
three reprobatea, that were scarce worth hanging, that were fit {or nothing,
and neither seemed born to do themselves good, nor any one else, had three
clever, diligent, careful, and ingenious wives: not that the first two were bad
wires, on to their temper or humour, for all the five were most willing, quiet,
passive and subjected creatures, rather like slaves than wives; but my
meaning is, they were not alike mpahle, ingenious, or industrious, or alike
cleanly and neat.

Another observation I must make, to the honour of a diligent application
on one hand, and to the disgrace of a slothful, negligent, idle temper, on the
other, that when I came to the place, and viewed the several improvements,
plantings, and management of the several little colonies, the two men had so
for out-gone the three, that there was no comparison. They had, indeed,
both of them as much ground laid out for corn as they wanted, and the
reason was, because, according to my rule, nature dictated that it was to no
purpose to sow more corn than they wanted; but the dill'erence of the cut.
twntion, oi the planting, of the fences, and, indeed, of every thing else, was
easy to he seen at first view.

The two men had innumerable young trees planted about their huts, no
that, when you came to the place, nothing was to he seen but a wood: and
though they had twice had their plantation demolished, once by their own
countrymen, and once by the enemy, as shall he shewn in its place, yet they
had restored all again, and every thing was thriving and flourishing about
them: they had grapes planted in order, and managed like a vineyard,
though they had then-selves never seen any thing of that kind; and, by their
good ordering their vines, their grapes were as good again as any of the
others. They had also found themselves out a retreat in the thickest part or
the woods: where, though there was not a natural cave, as I had found, yet
they made one with incessant labour of their hands, and where, when the
mischief which followed happened, they secured their wives and children, so
as they could never be found; they having, by sticking innumerable stokeo
and poles of the wood which, as I said, grew so readily, made the grove on-
passahle, except in some places where they climbed up to get over the out-
side part, and then went on by way: of their own leaving.

As to the three reprobates, as l justly call them, though they were much
civilized by their settlement compared to what they were before, and were
not so quarrelsome, having not the same Opportunity; yet, one of the certain
companions of a profilgate mind never left them, and that was their idleness.
It is true, they planted corn, and mode fences; but Solomon's words were
never better verified than in them, '1 went by the vineyard of the slotht'nl.
and it was till overgrown with thorns ;' for when the Spaniards came to view
their crop, they could not see it in some places for weeds, the hedge had
several gaps in it, where the wild goats had got in and eaten up the corn;
perhaps here and there a dead bush was crammed in, to stop them out for
the pment, but it was only shutting the stable-door alter the steed was
stolen: whereas, when they looked on the colony of the other two, there
was the very face of industry and success upon all they did; there was not a
weed to be seen in all their corn, or a gap in any of their hedges; and they,
on the other hand, verified Solomon's words in another place, ' that the dili-
gent hand maketh rich? for every thing grew and thrived. and they had
plenty within and without; they had more tame cattle than the others, more
utensils and necessaries within doors, and yet more pleasure and diversion too.

It. is true. the wives of the three were very handy and cleanly within
doom, and, having learned the English ways of dressing and cooking from
one of the other Englishmen, who, as I said, was a cook's mate on board the
shin, they dressed their husbands' vietunls very nicely and well; whereas
the others could not be brought to understand it; but then the husband,
who, as I my, had been cook's mate, did it himself. But as for the husband.
of the three wives, they loitered about, fetched turtles' eggs, and caught fish
and birds; in a word, any thing but labour, and they hired accordingly.
The diligent lived well and comfortablygand the alothfnl lived hard and
beggarly , and so, I believe, generally speaking, it' re all over the world.

But I now come to a scene difi'erent from all that had happened before,
either to them or to me ; and the original of the story was thin--Early one
morning, there came on shore five or six canoes of Indians or savages, call
them which you please, and there is no room to doubt they come upon the
old errand of feeding upon their slaves; but that part was now so familiar to
the Spaniards, and to our men too, that they did not concern themselves
about it, as I did: but, having been made sensible, by their experience, that
their only business was to lie concealed, and that if they were not seen by
any of the savages, they would go 08' again quietly, when theii; business was
done, having, as yet, not the least notion of there being any inhabitants in
the island; 1 say, having been made sensible of this, they had nothing to do
but give notice to all the three plantations to keep within doors, and not
shew themselves, only placing a scout in a proper place, to give notice when
the boats went to sea again.

This was, without doubt, very right; but a disaster spoiled all these mea-
sures, and made it known among the savages that there were inhabitants

there; which was, in the end, the desolation of alnioot the whole colony's-I'M"

After the canoes with the savages were gone 03', the Spaniards peeped
abroad again; and some of them had the curiosity to go to the place where
they had been, to see what they had been doing. Here, to their great sur-
prise, they found three savages left behind, and lying fast asleep open the
ground. It was supposed they had either been so gorged with their inlun
man feast, that, like beasts they were fallen asleep, and would not stir when
the others went, or they had wandered into the woods, and did not come
back to time to be taken m.

The Spaniards were greatly surprised at this sight, and perfectly at a loss}
"hat to do. The Spanish governor, as it happened, was with them, and his
advice was asked, but be professed he knew not what to do. As for slaves,
they had enough already; and, as to killmg them, they were none of. them
inclined to that: the Spaniard governor told me, they could not think 0!

shedding innocent blood: for as to them, the poor creatures had done them. ,

no wrong, invaded none of their property, and they thought they had no just,

quarrel against them, to take away their lives. And here 1 most, in justice. '

to these Spaniards, observe, that, let the accounts ol' Spanish cruelty in
Mexico and Peru be what they will, I never met with seventeen men of any
nation whatsoever,' in any foreign country, who were so universally modest,
temperate, virtuous, so yery good- hnmonred, and so courteous, as these Spa-
niards; and, as to cruelty, they had nothing ol' it in their very naturezno '

inhumanity, no barbarity, no outrageous passions. and yet all of them men
of great courage and spirit. Their temper and calmness had appearedin

their hearing the insufl'erable usage of the three Englishmen; and their ,

jwstice and humanity appeared now in the case of the savages, as above.
After some consultation, they resolved upon this; that they would lie still 3
while longer, till, it possible, these three men might be gone. But then the
governor Spaniard recollected, that the three savages had no boat; and, If
they were let! to rove about the island, they would certainly discover that
there were inhabitants in it; and so they should be undone that way. Upon
this they went back again, and there lay the fellows fast asleep still. and so
they resolved to woken them, and take them prisoners; and they did to.
The poor fellows were strangely frightened when they were seized upon and
bound ; and afraid, like the women, that they should be murdered and eaten :
for it seems those people think all the world does as they dq eating men's
flesh; but they were soon made easy as to that, and away they wried
them.

It was very.happy for them that they did not carry them home to their
castle, I mean to my palace under the hill; but they earned them first to the
bower, where was the chief of their country work. such as the keeping the
goals, the planting the corn, 8m; and afterwards they carried them to the
habitation of the two Englishmen.

Here they were set to work, though it was not much they had for them to
do; and whether it was by negligence in guarding them, or that they thought
the fellows could not mend themselves. 1 know not, but one of them ran
away, and taking to the woods, they could never hear of him any more.

They had good reason to believe he got home again soon alter, in some
other boots or canoes of savages who came on shore three or four weeks
afterwards; and who, carryingon their revels as usualyyrent off in two days'
time. This thought terrified them uceedingly: {or they concluded, and
that not without good cause indeed, that if this fellow came home safe among
his comrades, he would certainly give them an account that there were peo-
ple in the island, and also how few and weak they were; for this savage, as I
observed before, had never been told, and it was very happy he had not, how
many there were, or where they lived; nor had he ever seen or heard the
fire of any of their guns, much less had they shown him any of their other
retired places; such as the cave in the valley, or the new retreat which the
two Englishmen had made, and the like.

The fim testimony they had that this fellow had given Intelligence of them
was, that about two months alter this, air: canoes of savages, with about seven,
eight, or ten men in a canoe, came rowing along the north side of the island,
where they never need to come before, and landed, about an hour after sun-
rise, at a convenient place. about a mile from the habitation of the two English-
men, where this escaped man had been kept. As the Spaniard governor said:
had they been all there, the damage would not have been so much. for note
man of them would have escaped: but the cue difi'cred now very much, for
two men to fifiy was too much odds. The two men had the happiness to
discover them about a league oil', so that it was above an hour before they
Landed; and as they landed a mile from their huts, it was some time before
they could come at them. Now, having great reason to believe that they
were betrayed, the first thing they did was tohind the two slaves which were
lefl. and cause two of the three men whom they brought with the women

(who, it seems, proved very faithful to them) to lead them, With their two
wives, and whatever they could carry away with them, to their retired
places in the woods, which 1 have spoken of above, and there to bind the
two fellows hand and foot, till they heard farther.

In the next place, seeing the savage: were all come on chore, and that
they had bent their course directly that way, they opened the fence: where -
the milch~goats were kept, and drove them all out; leaving their goats to
straggle in the woods, whither they pleased, that the savages might think
they were all bred wild ; but the rogue who came with them was too cun-
ning for that, and gave them an account of it all, for they went directly to
the place.

W hen the two poor frightened men had secured their wire: and goods,
they sent the other slave they had of the three who came with the women,
and who was at their place by accident, away to the Spaniards with all
speed, to give them the alarm, and desire speedy help; and, in the mean
time, they took their arms, and what ammunition they had, and retreated
towards the place in the wood where their wires were sent; keeping at a
distance, yet so that they might see, if possible, which way the ravages took.

They had not gone far, but that from a rising ground they could see the
little army of their enemies come on directly to their habitation, and. in a
moment more, could see all their huts and household stufi' flaming up togea
ther, to their great grief and modification: for they had a very great loan,
to them irretrievable, at least for some time. They kept their station for
awhile, till they found the savages, like wild beasts, spread themselves all
over the place, rummaging every way, and every place they could think of,
in search of prey; and in particular for the people, of whom, now, it plainly
appeared, they had intelligence.

The two Englishmen seeing this, thinking themselves not secure where
they stood, because it was likely some of the wild people might come that
way, and they might come too many together. thought it proper to make
another retreat about halfa mile farther: believing, as it aflerwal-ds hap~
period, that the farther they strolled, the fewer would be together. ~

Their next halt was at the entrance into a very thick-grown part of the
woods, and where an old trunk of a tree stood, which was hollow and vastly
large; and in this tree they both took their standing, resolving to see there
what might offer. They had not stood there long, before two of the ravages
appeared running directly that way, as if they already had notice where
they stood, and were coming- np to attach them , and a little way farther they
espied three more coming alter them, and five more beyond them, all coming
the same way: besides which, they our seven or eight more at a distance,
wooing another way; for, in a. word, they ran every way, like sportsmen
heating for their game.

The poor man were now m great perplexity whether they shook! about
and keep their posture, or fly; but, otter a very short debate with them
selves, they considered, that if the savage: ranged the country than heme
help came, they might perlwps find out their retreat in the woods, and that
all would be lost; so they resolved to standthem there; and it"they were
too many to deal with, then they would get up to the top at the beetroot
whence they doubted not to dethnd themselves, fire excepted, as long as
their ammunition lasted, though all the savages that were landed, which
was near fifty, were to attach them.

. Having resolved upon this, they next considered whether they should fire
at the first two, or wait for the three, and so take themiddle party, by
which the two and the live that followed would be separated ; at length
they resolved to let the first twopass by, unless they should spy them in
the tree, and come to attack them. The first two savages confirmed them
also in this resolution, by turning a little fromthem towards another part of
the wood; but the three, and the fire afier them, came forward directly to
the tree, as if they had known the Englishmen were there. Seeing them
come so straight toward them, they resolved to take them in a line as they
came; and as they resolved to tire but one at a time perhaps the first shot
might hit them all three : for which purpose. the man who was to fire put
three or four small bullets into his piece; and having a fair loop-hole, as it
were, horn a broken hole in the tree, he took a sure aim, without being
seen, waiting till they were within about thirty yards of the tree, so that he
could not miss. -

While they were than waiting, and the savages came on, they plainly
saw that one of the three was the runaway savage that had escaped from
them; and they both knew him distinctly, and resolved that, if possible, he
should not escape, though they should both fire; so the other stood ready
with his piece, that like did not drop at the first shot, he should he sure to
have asecoud. But the first was too good a marksman to miss his aim; for
asthe savages kept near one another, a little behind, in a line, he tired, and
hit two of them directly: the foremost was killed outright, being shot in
the head; the second, which was the runaway Indian, was shot through
the bod , and tell, but was not quite dead; and the third had a little scratch
in the szoolder. perhaps by the some hall that went through the body otthe
second; and being dreadfully frightened, though notso much hurt, sat down
upon the ground, screaming and yelling in a hideous manner.

The fire that were behind, more frightened with the noise than sensible
of the danger, stood still at first; for the woods made the sound a thousand
times bigger than it really was, the echoes rattling from one side to another.
and the fowl: rising from all parts, screaming, and every sort making a difm
fereut noise, according to their kind- , just as it was when I fired the. first
gun that perhaps was ever shot off ll! the island

However, all being silent again, and they not knowing what the matter
was, came on unconcerned, till they came to the place where their com>>
panions lay, in a condition miserable enough; and here the poor Ignorant
creatures, not sensible that they were within reach of the same mischief;
stood all of a huddle over the wounded man, talking, and, as may be mp.
posed, inquiring of him how he came to he hurt; and who, it is very rs~
lions! to believe, told them, that a flash of fire first, and immediately nfier,

n'
that thunder from their gods, had killed those two and wounded him ; m
I any, is rational; for nothing is more certain than that, as they saw no man
near them, so they had never heard a gun in all their lives, nor so much as
heard of a gun; neither knew they any thing of killing and wounding at a
distance with fire and bullets: if they had, one might reasonably believe
they would not have stood so unconcerned in viewing the fate of their fel-
lows, without some apprehensions of their ovm.

Our two men, though, asthey confessed to me, it grieved them to he
ohiigui to kill so many poor creaturea, who, at theme time, had no no
tion of their danger; yet, having them all thus in their power, and the first
having loaded his piece again, resolved to let By both together among them;
and singling out, by agreement, which to aim at, they shot together,"and
killed, or very much wounded, four ofthem; the filth, frightened even to
death, though not hurt, fell with the rest; so that our men seeing them all
fall together, thought they had killed them all.

The belief that the savages were all killed made our two men come boldly
out from the tree before they had charged their guns, which was a wrong
step; and they were under some surprise when they came to the place. and
found no less than {our of them alive, and of them two very little hurt. and
one not at all: this obliged them to fall upon them with the stocks of their
muskets; andfirst they made sure of the runaway savage, that had been the
cause of all the mischief, and of another that was hurt it. the knee, and put
them out of their pain: then the man that was hurt not at all come and
heeled down to them, with his two hands held up, and made piteoos moans
to them, by gestures and signs, for his life, but could not say one word to
them that they could understand. However, they made signs to him to sit
down at the foot of a tree hard by; and one of the Englishmen, with a piece
of rope twine, which he had by great chance in his pocket, tied his two
hands behind him, and there they left him: and with what speed they
could made after the other two, which were gone before, fearing they, or
any more of them, should find the way to their covered place in the woods,
where their wives, and the few goods they had left, lay. They came once
in sight of the two men, but it was at a great distance; however, they had
the satisfaction to cross over a valley towards the sea, quite the contrary way
from that which led to'their retreat, which they were afraid of; and being
satisfied with that, they went back to the tree where they left their prisoner,
who, as they supposed, was delivered by his comrades, for he was gone,
and the two pieces of rope-yarn, with which they had bound him, lay just
at the foot of the tree. - '
' They were now in as great concern as before, not knowing what coursa'
to take, or how near the enemy might be, or in what numbers; so they re;
solved to go away to the place where their wires were, to see if all was well
there, and to make them easy, who were in (right enough to be mire; '0'
though the savages were their own country-folk, yet they were most the

When they come there, they tonnd the ranges had been inflaewwhand

by thetreesstsnding so thichashefore, unless the persons seekiogithad
been directed by those that knew it, which these did not: they found, there-
fore, every thing very note, only the women in a terrible fright. While they
were berg they had the comfort to have seven of. the Spaniards come to
their mstance; the other ten, with their servants, and old Friday, I mean
Friday's father, were. gone in a body to defend their bower, and the corn
and cattle that was kept there, in case the savages should have rowed over
to that side of the country; but they did not spread on tar. With the seven
Spaniards came one of the three savages, who, as I said, were their prisoners
formerly: and with them also came the savage whom the Englishmen had
left bound hand and foot at the tree; for it seem, they came-that way, tow
the slaughter of the seven men, and unbound the eighth, and brought hiitr
along with them; where, however, they were obliged to bind hirn again,>>
they had the two others who were led when the third ran away.

The prisoners now began to he a burden to them; and they wereeo afraid
of their escaping, that they were once resolving to kill them all. believing
they were under an absolute necessity to do so. for their own preservation.
However, the Spaniard governor would not consent to it; but ordered, for
the present, that they should be sent out of the way, to my old cave in the
valley, and he kept there, with two Spaniards to guard them; and give them
food for their subsistence, which was done; and they were bound these hand
and foot for that night.

When the Spaniards came, the two Englishmen were so encouraged, that
they could not satisfy themselves to stay any longer there; but taking five
of the Spaniards and themselves, with four musket: and a pistol among them,
and two stout quartervstnvw, away they went in quest of the savages>> And
first they came to the tree where the men lay that had been killed; 'but'it
was easy to see that some more of the savages had been there, for-they had

good way, but had given it over. From thence they advanced to 2thefirst
rising gronnd,~where'mey had stood and teen their camp destroyed, and
where they had the modification still to see romeo! the moire: but neither
could they here see any of the savages. They then resolved, though with
all possible caution, to go forward towards their mined plantation-hati-
little before they came thither, coming in sight of the More, they saw'
plainly the savages all embarked again in their canoes. in order to be gone.
They seemed sorry, at first, that there was no way to- come at them, to give
them a parting blow; but, upon the whole, they were very well satisfied to
he rid ofthem.

The poor Englishmen being now twioernined, and all their improvement:
destroyed, the test all agreed to come and help them tomboildeod to assist
them with needle! supplies. Their three countrymen, who were "not yet
noted for having the least inclination to do any good, yet as soon <<they '
heard of it (for they living remote eastwardrhnew nothing otthe matter till.
all was over), come and offered their help and assistance, and did, very
friendly, work for several days, to restore their habitation, and make neces-
saries for them. And thus, in a little time, they were set upon their legs
again.

About two days after this, they had the farther satisfaction of seeing three
of the savages' canoes come driving on shore, and, at some distance from
them, two drowned men: by which they had reason to believe that they had
met with a storm at sea, which had oversct some of them; for it had blowu
very hard the night alter they wencofi'.

However, as some might misonrry, so, on the other hand, enough of them
escaped to inform the rest, as well of what they had done, as of what had
happened to them, and to whet them on to another enterprise of the some
nature; which they, it seems, resolved to attempt, with sufficient force to
carry all before them: for, except what the first man had told them of inha- .
haunts, they could say little of it of their own knowledge, for they never saw
one man; and the fellow being killed that had affirmed it, they had no other
witness to confirm it to them.

It was five or SIX months after this before they heard any more of the
savages, in which time our men were in hopes they had either forgot their
former bad luck, or given over hopes of better; when, on a sudden, they
were invaded with a most formidable fleet, of no less than cight-aud~twenty
canoes, full of savages, armed with bows and arrows, great clubs, wooden
swords, and such-like engines of war; and they brought such numbers with
them, that, in short, it put all our people into the utmost consternation.

As they come on shore in the evening, and at the easternmost side of the
island, our men had that night to consult and consider what to do; and, in
the first place, knowing;r that their being entirely concealed was their only
safety before, and would be much more so now, while the number of their
enemies was so great, they therefore resolved, first of all, to take down the
huts which were built for the two Englishmen, and drive away their goals
to the old care; because they supposed the savages would go directly thi-
ther, as soon as it was day, to play the old game over again, though they did
not now land within two leagues of it. In the next place, they drove away
all the flocks of goals they had at the old bower, as I called it, which be>>
longed to the Spaniards; and, in short, let! as little appearance of inhabit-
ants any where as was possible: and the next morning early, they posted
themselves, with all their force, at the plantation of the two men, to wait for
their coming. As they guessed, so it happened: these new invaders leaving
their canoes at the east end of the island, came ranging along the shore,
directly" towards the place, to the number of two hundred and titty, as near
as our men could judge. Our army was but small, indeed; but that which
was worse, they had not arms for all their number neither. The whole
account, it seems, stood thus: first, as to men, seventeen Spaniards, fire
Englishmen, old Fnday, or Friday's father, the three slaves taken with
the women, who proved very faithful, and three other slaves, who lived with
the Spaniards. To arm these, they had eleven markets, live pistols, three
or aosmson 030502. 247

betting--pieces, fire musket: or fowling-pieees, which were taken by me from
the mutioous seamen whom I reduced, two swords, and three old hotberds.

To their slaves they did not give either musket or time, but they had
every one a halberd, or a long stall; like a qnarterotafi', with a great spike
of iron fastened into each end of it, and by his side a hatchet ; also every one
of our men had a. hatchet. Two of the women could not he prevailed upon,
but they would come into the fight, and they had bows and arrows, which
the Spaniards had taken from the savage: when the first action haypened,
which I have spoken of, where the Indians fought with one another; and
the women had batcliets too.

The Spaniard governor, whom I described so often, commanded the
whole; and W ill Atkins, who, though a dreadful fellow for wickedness, was
a most daring, bold fellow, commanded under him. The savages came
forward like lions; and our men, which was the worst of their fiite, had no
advantage in their situation; only that Will Atkins, who now proved a
most useful fellow, with six men, was planted just behind a small thicket of
bushes, as an advanced guard, with orders to let the first of them pass by
and then fire into the middle of them, and as soon as he had fired, to make
his retreat as nimbly as he could round a part of the wood, and so come in
behind the Spaniards, where they stood, having a thicket of trees before
them.

When the savages came on, they ran straggling about every way in heaps,
out of all manner of order, and W'ill Atkins let about fifty ot'them pass by
him; then seeing the rest come in a very thick throng, he orders three of
his men to tire, having loaded their muskets with six or seven bullets apiece,
about as big as large pistol-bullets. How many they killed or wounded
they knew not. but the consternation and surprise was inexpressible among
the savages; they were frightened to the last degree to hear and: adrendful
noise, and see their men killed, and others hurt, but see nobody that did it;
when, in the middle of their fright, Will Atkins, and his other three, let 8y
again among the thickest of them; and, in less than a minute, the first three
being loaded again, gave them a third volley.

Had Will Atkins and his men retired immediately as soon as they had
tired, as they were ordered to do, or had the rest of the body been at band,
to have poured in their shot continually, the savages had been effectually.
routed; for the terror that was among them came principally from this, viz,
that they were killed by the gods with thunder and lightning, and could see
nobody that hurt them; but Will Atkins, staying to load again, discovered
the cheat; some of the savages who were at a distance, spying them, came
upon them behind: and though Atkins and his men fired at them also, two
or three times, and killed above twenty, retiring as fast as they could, yet,
they wounded Atkins himself, and killed one of his fellow Englishmen, with
their arrows. as they did afterwards one Spaniard, and one of the Indian
slaves who came with the women. This slave was a most gallant fellow,
and foogbt most desperately, killing five of then: with his 'own hand, having
no weapon but one of the armed stares and a hatchet.
248 THE LIFE AND ADVENTUflES

Our men .heing thus hard laid at, Atkina wounded, and two other men
killed, retreated to a rising ground in the wood; and the Spaniards, after
firing three volleys upon them, retreated also; for their number was "great,
and they were no desperate, that though, above filly of them were killed, and
more than as any wounded, yet they came on in the teeth of our-men.
fearless of danger. and shot their arrows like a cloud; and it was observed
that their wounded men. who were not quite disabled, were made outrageous
by their wounds, and fought like madman.

When our men retreated, they left the Spaniard and the Englishman that
were killed behind them, and the savages, when they come up to them,-
lrilled them over again at a wretched manner, breaking their arms, legs, and
heads, with their clubs and wooden swords, like true swag"; but finding
our men were gone, they did not seem to pursue them, but drew themselves
up in a ring, which is, it seems, their crutom, and shouted twice, in token
of their Victory; after which, they had the modification to see several of
their wounded men fall, dying with the mere [on of blood.

The Spaniard governor hating drawn his little body up together, upon a
tiring ground, Atkins though he was wounded, would have had them march,-
and charge again altogether at once: but the Spaniard replied, 'Seignior
Athlm,.you.see how their wounded, men fight: let them alonetill mailing;
all the wounded men will be stifl' and sore with their wounde, and faint with
the loss of blood; and so we shall have the fewer to engage.' This advice
was good; but Will Atkins replied merrily, ' That is true, seignior, and so
shall I too; and that )8 the reason I would go on while I am warm.'-- --~' Well,
Seignior Atkins; any: the Spaniard,' you have hehavad gallantly, and done
your part ; we will fight for you, if you cannot come on; but! think it best
to only till morning :' no they waited.

But unit was a clear moon-light night, and they found the ravages in great
disorder about their dead and wounded men, and 3 great noise and hurry
among them where they lay, they afterwards resolved to fell upon them in
the night; especially if they could come to give them but one volley before
they were discovered, which they had a fair opportunity to do; for one of V
the Englishmen, in whose quarter it was where the fight began, led them
round between the woods and the wayside westward, and then turning short
south, they come so near where the thickest of them lay. that, before they
were seen or heard. eight of them fired to among them, and did dreadful
execution upon them; in half a. azan more, eight other: fired after them,
pouring in their small shot in such o quantity. that abundance were'killed
and wounded; and all this while they were not able to see who hurt them,
or which way to fly.

The Spaniards charged again with the utmost expedition, and then divided
themselves in three bodies and resolved to fall in among them alltogetjher
They had in each body eight persons, that is to say, twenty-two and the
two women, who, by the way, fought desperately. They divided the fire-
arm: equally in each party, and on the halberds and stores. They would
have had the women kept back, but they said they were resolved to die
with their hushenda Having thus formed their little army, they marched
out from among the treer, and come up to the well: of the enemy, shouting.
and hallooing as loud as they could; the ravages atood all together, but were
in the utmost contusion, hearing the noise of our men shooting from three
quarters together: they would have fought if they had seen us; for as soon
as we come near enough to be seen, some arrows were shot, and poor old
Friday was wounded, though not dangerously; but our men gave them no
time, but, running up to them, fired among them three ways. and then fell
in with the buttsenda of their markets, their swords, armed stoves, and
hatcheta, and laid about them so well, that, in a word, they set up a dismal
screaming and howling, flying to save their lives which way aoever they
could. , -.

Our men were tired with the execution, and killed, or mortally wounded,'
in the two fights. about one hundred and eighty of them; the rest, being
frightened out of their wits, scoured through the wood: and over the hills.
with all the speed fear and nimble-feet could help them to ; and as we did not
trouble ourselves much to pursue them, they got all together to the sea-aide,
where they-landed, and where their canoes lay. But their disaster was not
at an end yet; for it blew a terrible storm ot' wind that evening from the
sea, to that it was impossible for them to go 06'; nay, the storm continuing
all night, when the tide came up, their canoes were most of them driven by
the surge of the sen so high upon the shore, that it required infinite toil to
get them 06'; and some of them were even dashed to piece. against the
beach, or against one another.

Our men, though glad of their victory, yet got little rest that night; but
having refreshed thenuelveu as well as they could, they resolved. to march
to that part of the island where the savages were tied, and see what posture
they were in. This necessarily led them over the place where the fight had

yet past recovering life; a sight disagreeable enough to generous minds; for

ran screaming and yelling away, with a kind of howling noise, which our
men did not understand, and had never heard before; and thus they ran up
the hills into the country.

At first our men had much rather the weather had been calm, and they
had all gone away to sea; but they did not then consider that this might
probably have been the occasion of their coming again in such multitudes
as not to be resisted, or, at least, to come so many, and so often, as would
quite desolate the island, and starve them. Will Atkins, therefore, who,
notwithstanding his wound, kept always with them, proved the beat conn--
sellor in this case: his advice was, to take the advantage that offered, and
clap in between them and their boats, and so deprive them of the capacity
of ever returning any more to plague the island.

They consulted long about this; and some were agninst it, for fear or
making the wretches fly to the woods and live there desperate, and so they
should have them to hunt like wild beasts, be afraid to stir out about their
business, and have their plantation continually rifled, all their tame goats
destroyed, and, in'short, be reduced to a life of continual distress.

Will Atkins told them they had better have to do with a, hundred men than
with a hundred nations: that, as they must destroy their boats, sothey must
destroy the men, or be all of them destroyed themselves. In a word, he
showed them the necessity of it so plainly, that they all came into it; so they
went to work immediately with the boats, and, getting some dry wood to
gether from a dead tree, they tried to set some of them on fire, but they were
so wet that they would not burn; however, the tire so burned the upper
port, that it soon made then: unfit for swimming in the sea as boats. When
the Indians saw what they were about, some of "H.332 came running out of
the woods, and, coming as near as they could to women, koeeled down and
cried. ' On, Us, \Varamokoa,' and some other words of their language, which
none of the others understood any thing of; but, as they made pitilhl gee>>
tures and strange noises, it was easy to understand they begged "have their

from ever going home again : depending upon this, that, if one so much as
one of them got back into their country to tell the story, the colony was un-
done; so that, letting them know that they should not have any mercy, they fell
to work with their canoes, rind destroyed them every one that the storm had
not destroyed before; at the sight of which the savages raised a hideous cry
to the woods, which our people heard plain enough, odor which theynn
uncut the island like distracted men ; so that, in a word, our men did not really
snow at first what to do with them. Nor did the Spaniards. with all their
prudence, consider, that while they made time people thus desperate, they
ought to have kept a good guardLst the some time upon their plantations; for -
though. it is true, they had driven away their cattle, and the Indians did not
and out their main retreat, I mean my old castle at the hill, nor the cave in
the valley, yet they found out my. plantation at the bower, and pulled it all
to pieces, and nllthet'eneea and planting'about it; trod all the can under
foot. tore up the vine and grapes, being just then almost ripe, and did our
men an inestimahle damage, though to themselves not one furthing'a-worth
of service.

Though our men were able to fight them upon all occasions, yet they were
in no condition to pursue them, or hunt'them up and down; for, as they
weretoo nimble of foot for our men, when they found them single, so our
men dare: not go abroad single, {or'fear of being surrounded with their
numbers. The best was, they had no weapons; for though they had born,
they had no arrows left, nor any materials to make any; nor had they any
edged tool or weapon among them.

The extremity and distress they were reduced to was great, and indeed
deplorable; but, at the same time, our men were also brought to very bad
circumstanees by them; ibr, though their retreats were preserved, yet their
provision was destroyed, and their harvest spoiled ; and what to do, or which
way to turn themelves, they knew not. The only relbge they had now was, the
stock of cattle they had in the valley by the cave, and some little corn which
grew there, and the plantation of the three Englishmen, Will Atkins and
his comrades, who were now reduced to two; one of them being killed by
an arrow, which struck him on the side of his head, just under the temples,
no that he never spoke more: and it was very remarkable, that this was the
some barbarous fellow that out the poor savage slave with his hatchet, and
who afierwards intended to have murdered the Spaniards.

I looked upon their case to have been worse at this time than mine was
at any time, after I first discovered the grain; of barley and rice, and got into

they had, as I may say, a hundred wolves upon the island, which would de-
vour every thing they could come at, yet could be hardly come at themselves.

When they saw what their circumstances were, the first thing they con-
cluded was, that they would, if possible, drive them up to the farther partof
the island-southwest, that, if any more outages came on shore, they might
not .find one another: then, that they would daily hunt and harassjthem,
and'klll "many of them as they could come at, till they had reduced their-
number; and if they could at last tame them, and bring them to any thing,
- they would give them corn, and teach them how to plant, and live upon their
daily labour. '

lttorder to this, they so followed them, and so terrified them with their

them, especially the Spaniard governor, who was the most gentlemanalikc,
generous-minded man, that 1 ever met with in my life; and he proposed. i.
posoible, to take one of thcni alive, and bring him to undemtand what they
meant, so far as to be able to act as interpreter, and go among them, and see
if they might be brought to some conditions that might be depended upon,
to save their lives and do us no harm.

It was some while before any of them could be taken; but, being went
and half-starved, one of them was at last surprised and made a prisoner. He
was sullen at first, and would neither eat nor drink; but, finding himself
kindly used, and victuals given him, and no violence otl'ered him. he at last
grew tractable, and came to himself. They brought old Friday to him, who
talked often with him, and told him how kind the others would be to them
all; that they would nofiouly save their lives, but would give them part of the
island to live in, provided they would give satisfaction that they would keep
in their own bounds and not come beyond it to injure or prejudice others;
and that they should have corn given them to plant and make it grow for
their bread, and even some bread given them for their present subsistence:
and old Friday bade the fellow go and talk with the rest of his countrymen,
and see what they said'to it; assuring them, that if they did not agree im-
mediately, they should be all destroyed.

The poor wretches, thoroughly humbled, and reduced in number to about
thirty-oer en, closed with the proposal at the first offer, and begged to have
some food given them; upon which, twelve Spaniards and two Englishmen,
well armed, with three Indian slaves and old Friday. marched to the place
where they were. The three Indian slaves carried them a large quantity of
bread, some rice boiled up to cakes and dried in the sum-and three live goats;
and they were ordered to go to the side of a hill, where they sat down, ate
their provisions very thankfully, and were the most faithful fellow: to their
words that could be thought of; for, except when they came to beg virtual:
and directions, they never came out of their bounds: and there they lived
when I came to the island, and I went to see them.

They had taught them both to plant corn, make bread, breed tame goats,
and milk them: they nanted nothing but wives, and they soon would have
been a nation. They were confined to a neck of land, surrounded with high
rocks behind them, and lying plain towards the area before them, on the
south-east corner of the island. They had land enough, and it was very
good and fruitful, about a mile and a half broad, and three or four mile.
in length

Our men taught them to make wooden epadeo, such as I made for myself,
and gave among them twelve hatchet: and three or four knives; and there
they lived. the moat subjected innocent creatures that ever were heard of:

search or inquiry afier their countrymen; and if they had, it would have
been very hard to have found then: out.

Thus, i think, I have given a full account of all that happened to them till
my return, at least, that was worth notice. The Indians or savages were
wonderfullyieivilized by them, and they frequently went among them; but
forbid, on pain of death, any one of the Indians coming to them, because they
would not have their settlement betrayed again. One thing was 'very'rm
malleable, viz, that they taught the savages to make wicker-work, or'has-
kets, but they soon outdid their masters; (or they made abundance of most
ingenious things in wickervwork, particularly all sorts of baskets, sieves,
bird~cages, cupboards, are; as also chairs to sit on, stools, beds, couches, and
abundance of other things; being very ingenious at such work, when they
were once not in the way of it. ' '

' My coming was a particular relief to these people, because we flamished
them with knives, minors, spades, shovels. pick-axes, and all things of that
kind which they could want. With the help of those tools they were so
very handy, that they came at last to build up their huts, or houses, very
handsomely, raddling or working it up like basket-work all the way rou'nd;
which was a very extraordinary piece of ingenuity, and looked very odd, but
was an exceeding good fiance, as well against heat as against all sorts of
vermin; and our men were so taken with it, that they got the wild savages
to come and do the like for them; so that when I came to see the two
Englishmen's colonia, they looked, at adistance, as if they all lived like bees
in a hive. As for Will Atkins, who was now become a very industrious,
useful, and sober fellow, he had made himself such a tentof basket-work, as,
l believe, was never seen; it was one hundred and twenty paces round on
the outside, as I measured by my steps; the walls were as close worked as
a basket, to pannels or' squares of thirty-two in number. me very strong,
standing about seven feet high: in the middle was another not above twenty-- -
two pares round, but built stronger, being octagon in its form, audio the
eight corners stood eight very strong posts; round the top 61 which he laid
strong pieces, pinned together with wooden pins, from which he raised a
pyramid for a roof of eight rollers, very handsome, I sssure you and * joined
together rery well, though he had no nails, and only a few iron epiltes, which
he made himself too, out of the old iron that I had left the e; and, indeed,
this fellow shewed abundance of ingenuity in several this gs which he had no
knowledge of: he made him a forge, with a pairofwooden bellows .to blow
the fire; he made himself charcoal for his work; and he formed out of the
iron crows a middling good anvil to hammer upon: in this' manner he made
many things, hut especially hooks,- staples, endspikes, bolts and mega-Bur,
to return to the house: Alter be had pitched the roofof his i'nnerniost tent.
he worked it up between the rafters with basket-work in em, and thatched
that over again so ingeniously. with rice-straw, and over that a large leaf of
a tree, which covered the top, that his house was asdryasit' it had been
tiled or slated. Indeed. he owned that the savages had nude the basket.
work for him. The outer circuit was covered as a lean--to, all round this
inner apartment, and long rafter: lay iron: the thirty-two angles to the top
posts of the inner home, being about twenty feet distant; so that there was
a space like a walk within the outer wicker wall and without theinner, near
twenty feet wide.

The inner place he partitioned ofi' with the same wickemvork, but much
fairer, and divided into air: apartments, so that he had sir: rooms on a floor,
and out of every one of these there was a door; first into the entry, or
coming into the main tent, another door into the main tent, and another
door into the space or walk that was round it; no that walk was also divided
into six equal parts, which served not only for a retreat, but to store up any
necessaries which the family had occasion for. These six space: not taking
up the whole circumference, what other apartments the outer circle had
were thus ordered :--As soon as you were in at the door of the outer circle,
you had a short passage straight before you to the door of the inner house;
but on either side was a wicker partition, and a door in it, by which you
went first into a large room, or storehouse, twenty feet wide, and about
thirty feet long, and through that into another, not quite so long: so that
in the outer circle were ten handsome rooms, six of which were only to he
come at through the apartments of the inner tent, and served a: closets or
retiring-rooms to the respective chambers of the inner circle; and four large
warehouses, or barns, or what you please to call them, which went through
one another, two on either hand of the pamge, that led through the outer

door to the inner tent.
Such a piece of baskebworlr, i believe, was never seen in the world, nor

a house or tent so neatly contrived, much less so built. in this great bee--
hive lived the three families, that is to soy, Will Atkins and his companion;
the third was killed, but his wife remained, with three children, for she was,
it seems, big with child when he died: and the other two were not at all
backward to give the widow her full share of every thing, 1 mean as to their
corn, milk, grapes, &r. and when they killed a kid, or found a turtle on the
shore; so that they all lived well enough; though, it was true, they were
not so industrious as the other two, as has been observed already.

One thing, however, cannot be omitted, viz. that as for religion, I do not
know that there was any thing of that kind among them: they often, indeed,
put one another in mind that there warn God, by the very common method
of seamen; via, swearing by his name: nor were their poor ignorant savage
wives much better for having been married to Christians, as we must call
them; for as they knew very little of God themselves, so they were utterly
incapable of entering into any discourse with their wives about a God, or to
tell: any thing to them concerning religion.

The utmost of all the improvement which I can my the wire: had made
tom them was, that they had taught them to speak English pretty well; and
most of their children, which were near twenty in all, were taught to speak
English too, from their first learning to speak, though they at first spoke
it in a very broken manner, like their mothers. There was none of these
children above six years old when I came thither, for it was not much above
seven years that they had fetched these five savage ladies over; but they had
all been pretty fruitful, for they had all children, more or less; I think the
cook's mate's wife was big of her sixth child; and the mothers were all a
good sort of well--govemed, quiet, laborious women, modest and decent,
helpful to on another, mighty observant, and subject to their masters (I
cannot call them husbands), and wanted nothing but to be well instructed
in the Christian religion, and to be legally married; both which were hap-
pily brought about afterwards by my means, or, at least, in consequence of
my coming among them.

Having thus given an account of the colony in general, and pretty much
of my runagate English, I must say something of the Spaniards, who were
the main body of the family, and in whose story there are some incidents
also remarkable enough.

I had a great many discourses with them about their circumstances when
they were among the savages. They told me readily that they had no in-
stances to give of their application or ingenuity in that country; that they
were a poor, miserable, dejected, handful of people; that, if means had been
put into their hands, yet they had so abandoned themselves to despair, and
so sunk under the weight of their misfortune, that they thought of nothing
but starving. One of them, a grave and sensible man, told me he was con.
vinced they were in the wrong; that it was not the part of wise men to give
themselves up to their misery, but always to take hold of the helps which
reason offered, as well for present support as for future deliverance: he told
me that grief was the most senseless insignificant passion in the world, for
that it regarded only things past, which were generally impossible to be re-
called, or to be remedied, but had no views of things to come, and had no
share in any thing that looked like deliverance, but rather added to the
afiliction than proposed a remedy; and upon this he repeated 8 Spanish
proverb, which, though I cannot repeat in just the same words that he
spoke it in, yet, I remember, I made it into an English proverb of my owns
thus :--

In trouble to be troubled,
Is to have your trouble doubled.

He ran on, then, in remarks upon all the little improvements I had made
in my solitude; my unwearied application, as he called it ; and how I had
made a condition which in its circumstances was at first much worse than
theirs, a thousand times more happy than theirs was, even now when they
were all together. He told me it was remarkable that Englishmen had a
greater presence of mind in their distress, than any people that ever he met
with : that their unhappy nation and the Portuguese were the worst men in
the world to struggle with misfortunes; for that their first step in dangefl.
otter the common efl'orts were over, was to despair, lie down under it, and
die, without rousing their thoughts up to proper remedies for escape

I told him their case and mine differed exceedingly; that they were cast
upon the shore without necessaries, without supply of food, or present an-
stenance till they could provide; that, it was true, I had this disadvantage2.36 ms use as>> aorenruass

and discomfort, that l was alone; but then the supplies] had providentially
thrown into my hands, bythe unexpected driving of the ship on shore, was
such a help as would have encouraged any creature in the world to have
applied himself as i had done. ' Seignior,' says the Spaniard, ' had we poor
Spaniards been in your case, we should never have got half those things out
of the ship, as you did: uay,' says he, 'we should never have found means to
have got a rail to entry them, or to have got the raft; on shore without boat
or sail : and how much less should we have done if any of us had been aloue!'
Well, i denim-d him to abate his compliment, and go on with the history of
their coming on shore, where they landed. He told me they uuhappily
landed at a place where there were people without provisions; whereas.
had they had the common sense to have put off to sea again, and gone to
another island a little farther, they had found provisions, though without
people; there being an island that way, as they had been told, where there
were provisions, though no people; that is to say, that the Spaniards of
Trinidad had frequently been there, and had filled the island with goats and
hogs at several times, where they had tired in such multitudes, and where
turtle and sea--{owls were in such plenty, that they could have been in no
want of flesh, though they had found no bread; whereas here, they were
only sustained with a few roots and herbs, which they understood not, and
which had no substance in them, and which the inhabitants gave them
sparingly enough; and who could treat them no better, unless they would
turn Cannibals, and eat men's ties-h, which was 11.12 great dainty of their
country.

They gave me an account how many ways they strove to civilize the

wages they were with, and to teach them rational customs in the ordinary

way of living, but in vain; and how they retorted it upon them. as unjust,
that they, who more there t'or assistance and support, should attempt to set-
up for instructors of those that gave them food; intimating, It seems, that
none should set up for the instructors of others but those who could lire
without them. .

They gave me dismal accounts of the extremities they were driven to;
how sometimes they were many days without any food at all, the island they
Were upon being inhabited by a sort of savages that lived more indolent, and
for that reason were less supplied with the necessaries of life, than they had
reason to believe others were in the same part of the world: and yet they
found that these savages were less ravenous and voracious than those who
had better supplies of food. Also they added, they could not but see with
what demonstrations of wisdom and goodness the governing providence of
God directs the events of things in the world; which, they said, appeared
in their circumstances; for if, pressed by the hardships they were under,
and the barrenuess of the country where they were, they had searched after

a hotter to live in, they had then been out of the way of the relief that lzap._ '

pelted to tnem by my means.
They then gave me. an account how the savages whom they lived among
expected them to go out with them into their wars; and, it was true, that as

- u'
they had fire-arms with them, had they not had the dis-eta to lose their
ammunition, they should have been serviceable not only to their friends, but
have made themselves terrible both to friends and enemies; but being with-
out: powder and shot, and yet in a condition that they could not in reason
deny to go out with their landlords to their wars, so when they came into
the field of battle, they were in a worse condition than the savages them-
selves; for they had neither bows nor arrows, nor could they use those the
savage: gave them; so they could do nothing but stand still, and be wounded
with arrows, till they come up to the teeth of their enemy; and then, in-
deed, the three halberds they had were of use to them; and they would
often drive a whole little army before them with those halbcrds, and sharp.
ened sticks put into the mnzzles of their muskets : but that, for nil this, they
Were sometimes surrounded with multitudes, and in great danger from their
arrows, tilt at last they found the way to make themselves large targets of
wood, which they covered with skins of wild beasts. whose names they knew
not, and these covered them from the arrows of the savages: that, notwith-
standing these, they wane sometimes in great danger; and five of them were
once knocked down together with the clubs of the savages, which was the
time when one of them was taken prisoner, that is to say, the Spaniard
whom 1 had relieved: that at first they thought he had been killed; but
when they afterwards heard he was taken prisoner, they were under the
greatest grief imaginable, and would willingly have all ventured their lives
to have rescued him.

They told me that when they were so knocked down, the rest of their
company rescued them, and stood over them fighting till they were some to
themselves, all but him who they thought had been dead; and then they
made their way with their halberds and pieces, standing close together in a
line, through a body ofnbove a thousand savages, beating down all that came in
their way, got the victory over their enemies, but to their great sorrow, be-
cause it was with the loss of their friend, whom the other party, finding him
alive, carried 05', with some others, as 1 gave no account before.

They descriSed, most afl'eetionately, how they were surprised with joy at
the return of their friend and companion in misery, who, they thought, had
been devoured by wild beasts of the worst. kind; viz" by wild men; and yet
how more and more they were surprised with the swoon: he gave them of
his errand, and that there was a Christian in any place near, much more one
that was able, and had humanity enough, to contribute to their deliverance.

'niey described how they were astonished at the sight of the relief I sent
them, and at the appearance of loaves of bread, things they had not seen since
their coming to that miserable place; how often they crossed and blessed it
fii'tfiread sent from Heaven, and what a. reviving cordial it was to their
.h'ptuta to taste it, as also the other things I had sent for their supply: and,
filter all, they would have told me something of the gov they were in at the
sight ofa boat and pilots, to carry them away to the person and place from
whence all these new comforts came, but: it was impossible to express it by
words, for their excwsive joy naturally driving them to unbecoming extra-

dared upon lunacy, having no way to give vent to their minds suitable to
the sense that war upon them; that in some it worked one way, and in some
another; and that some of them, through a surprise of joy, would bunt into

extremely afi'ected me, and called to my mind Friday's ecstac'y when he met
his father, and the poor people's ecstacv when 1 took them up at sea, alter
their ship was on fire; the joy of the mate of the ship when he found him
self delivered in the place when: he expected to perish; and my own joy,
when, after twenty-eight years' captivity, I found a good ship ready to carry
me to my own country. All those things made me more sensible ofthe rela-
tion of these poor men, and more afi'eoted with it.

Having thus given a view of the state of things as I found them, I must
more the beads of what} did for these 'people, and the condition in which!
let! them. it was their opinion, and mine too, that they would be troubled
no more with the savages, or, it' they were, they would be able to cut them
off, if they were twice as many as before; so they had no concern about
that. Then I entered into a serious discourse with the Spaniard, whom I
call governor, about their stay in the island; for, as l was not cometo carry
any of them off, so it would not be just to carry 03' some and leave others,
who, perhaps, would be unwilling to stay if their strength was diminished.
On the other hand, i told them I came to establish them there, not to remove
them : and then I let them know that I had brought with me relief ofnuodry
kinds for them; that I had been at a great charge to supply them with all
things necessary, as well for their convenience as their defence; and that I
had such and such particular persons with me, as well to increase and recruit
their number, as by the particular necessary employment: which they were
bred to, being artifioera, to assist them in those things of which, at present,
they were in want.

They were all together when I talked thus to them; and before I deli-
vered to them the stores 1 had brought, i asked them, one by one, if they
had entirely forgot and boned the first animositiea that had been among
them, and would shake hands with one another, and engage in a ottict
friendship and union of interest, that no there might be no more misunder-
standings and jealousies.

Will Atkins, with abundance of frankness and good humour, nid,' they
had met with afiiictiou enough to make them all sober, and enemies enough
to make them all friends; that, for his part, he would live and die with them;
and was so for from designing any thing against the Spaniards, that he
owned they had done nothing to him but what his own mad humour made
neceosary, and what he would have done, and perhaps worse. in their one
and that he would ask than pardon, if I desired it, for the foolish and brutal:
things he had done to them, and was very willing and desirous of livmg on
terms of entire friendship and union with them, and would do my thiogtliat
lay in his power to convince them of it; and an for going to England, its
raved not if he did not go thither three-twenty years' .
The Spaniards said. they had, indeed; at first dimmed and excluded
Will Atkins and his two countrymen for their ill conduct." they had let
me know, and they appealed to me for the necessity they were under to do
so; but that Will Atkins had behaved himself so bravely in the great fight
they had with the savages, and on several occasions since, and had showed
himself so faithful to, and concerned for, the general interest of them all,
that they had forgotten all that was past, and thought he merited as much
to be trusted with arms. and 'eupplied with necessaries, as. any of them; and
they had testified their satisfaction in him, by committing the command to
him, next to the governor himself; and as they had entire confidence in him,
and all his countrymen, so they acknowledged they had merited that conti-
deuee by all the methods that honest men could merit to be valued and
trusted; and they most heartily embraced the occasion of giving me this as-
surance, that they would never have any interest separate from one another.

Upon these frank and open declarations of fi'iendship, we appointed the
next day to dine all together; and, indeed, we made a splendid feast. I '
caused the ship's cool: and his mate to come on shore and dress our dinner;
and the old cook's-mate we had on shore misled. We brought on shore six
pieces of good beef, and four pieces of pork, out of the ship's provision. with
our punch~bowl, and materials to fill it; and, in particular, I gave them ten
bottles of French claret, and ten bottles of English beer; things that neither
the Spaniards nor the English had tasted for many years, and which, it may
be supposed, they were very glad of. The Spaniards added to our feast five
whole this, which the cooks roasted; and three of them were sent. covered
up close, on board the ship. to the seamen, that they might feast on flesh
meet from on shore, as we did with their salt meat from on hoard

After this feast, at which we were very innocently merry, I brought out
my cargo of goods; wherein, that there might be no dispute about dividing,
1 showed them that there was a snfiiciency for them all. desiring that they
might all take an equal quantity of the goods that were for wearing: that is
to say, equal when made up As, first, I distributed linen sufficient to make
every one of them four shirts, and. at the Spaniards' request, aficmards made .
. them up six , these were exceeding comfortable to them, having been what,
as I may any, they had long since forgot the use of; or what it was to'wear
them. I allotted the thin English stuffs, which I mentioned before, to make
_grery one a light coat like a frock which I judged fittest for the heatof
' (he game, cool and loose; and ordered that whenever they dmy'ed they

should make more, as they thought fit, the like for pumps, shoes, stockings,

The>> I presented to them the people I had brought with me, particularly
the tailor, the smith, and the two carpenters, all of them moetneoesaary
people; but, above all, my general artificer, than whom they could not name
any thing that was more useful to them: and the tailor, to Show his concern
for them, went to work immediately, and, with my leave, made them every
one a shirt, the first thing he did; and, what was still more, he taught the
women not only how to sew and stitch, and use the needle, but made them
assist to make the shirts for their husbands, and for all the rest.

As to the carpenters, I some need mention how useful they were; for
they took to pieces all my clumsy, unhaody things, and made them clever
convenient tables, stools, bedsteads, cupboards. lockers, shelves and every
thing they wanted of that kind. But to let then: see how nature made arti~
ficers at first, I carried the carpenters to see Will Atkiu's health-house, as I
called it: and they both owned they never saw an inetance of each natural
mgenuity before, nor any thing so regular and so handily built, at least, of it:
kind; and one of them, when he no it, alter musing a good while, turning
about to me, '1 am sure.' says he, 'that man has no need of us; you need do
nothing but give him tools.'

Then I brought them out all my store of tools, and gave every man a. dig-
ging-spade, a shovel, and a take, for we had no narrow: or ploughs; and to
every separate place a pick~axe, a crow, a broad axe, and a saw; alwayu
appointing, that as often as any were broken or worn out they should be
supplied, without grudging, out of the general atom that I let! behind.
Nails, staples, hinges, hammers, ehizels, knives, scissors, and all aorta of iron~
work, they had without tale, as they required; for no man would take more
than he wanted, and he must be a fool that would waste or spoil them on
any account whatever; and, for the use of the smith, I let! two tone of un-
wrought iron for a supply. ,

M y magazine of powder andmrms which i brought them was such, even
to profusion, that they could not but rejoice at them; for now they could
march as I used to do, with a musket upon each shoulder, if there wan occa~
aion; and were able to fight a thousand savages, if they had but some little

' advantages of situation, which also they could not miss, it they had occasion.

I carried on shore with me the young man whose mother was starved to
death, and the maid also: she was a sober, welledmted, religions young
woman, and behaved so inofl'ensively, that every one gave her a good word ;
she had, indeed, an unhappy life with us, then: being no woman in the ship
but herself; but she bore it with patience. After awhile, eeeiag thinguo
well ordered, and in so fine a way of thriving upon my inland, and consider--
ing that they had neither business not acquaintance in the Bart Indies, or '
reason for taking so long a voyage; I say, considering all this, both of them
came to we, and duired I would give them leave to remain on thgialaud,
and be entered among my family, as they called it. I agreed to thin readily;
and they had a little plot of ground allotted to them, where they had three
cuts or houses set up, surrounded with a beeketpwork, palliaadoed like At.
kim's, adyoiuing to Ins plantation. Their tents were contrived so that they
hadeschofthem sroom aparttolodgein, anda middle tent, like sgrsat
store-house, to lay their goods in, and to eat and drink in. And now the
other two Englishmen removed their habitation to the same place; and so
the island was divided into three colonies, and no more, viz, the Spaniards,
with old Friday, and the first servants, at my old habitation under the hill,
which was, in a word, the capital city; and where they had so enlarged
and extended their works, as well under as on the outside of the bill. that
they lived, though perfectly concealed, yet full at large. Never was there
such a little city in a wood, and so hid, in any part of the world; for I verily
believe a thousand men might have ranged the island a month, and, if they
had not known there was such a thing, and looked on purpose for it, they
would not have found it; for the trees stood so thick and so close, and grew
so fast-woven one into another, that nothing but cutting them down first
could discover the place, except the only two narrow entrances where they
went in and out could be found, which was not very easy; one of them was,
close down at the-water's edge, on the side of the creek, and it was aden-
wards above two hundred yards to the place; and the other was ups ladder
at twice, as I have already formerly dacribed it; and they had also a large
wood thick-planted on the top of the hill, containing above an acre, which
grew space, and concealed the place from all discovery there, with only one
narrow place between two trees not easily to be discovered, to enter on
that side.

The other colony was that of Will Atkins, where there were four families
of Englishmen, I mean those I had left there, with their wives and children, -
three savages that were slaves; the widow and the children of the English:
man that was-killed; the young man and the maid; and, by the way, we
made a wife of her before we went away. There were also the two carpen-
ters and the tailor, whonnl brought with me for them; also the smith, who
was a very necessary man to them, especially asa gunsmith, to take care of
their arms: and my other man, whom I called Jack-ohall-trades, who was;
in himself as good almost as twenty men; for he was not only a very in-
genious fellow, but avery merry fellow; and before I went away we married
him to the honest maid that cam with the youth in the ship I mentioned '
before.

be my opinion, perhaps, as well as the opinion of others who shall read this,
that he was mistaken.

The first hour that I began to converse-with him alter he had agreed to
go with me to the East ladies, I found reason to delight exceedingly in his
conversation ; and he first began with me about religion in the most obliging
manner imaginable. ' Sir; says he, ' you have not only under God,' {and
at that he crossed his breast), 'saved my life, but you have admitted me to
go this voyage in your ship, and by your oblig'mg civility have taken me
into your family, giving me an opportunity of free conversation. Now, sir,
you see by my habit what my profession is, and I guess by your nation what
yours is; I may think it" is my duty, and doubtless it loan, to use my utmost
endeavours, on all occasions, to bring all the souls I can to the knowledge
of the truth, and to embrace the catholic doctrine; but as 1 am here under
your permission, and in your family. I am bound, in justice to your kindness>>
as well as in decency and good manners, to be under your government; and
therefore I shall not, without your leave. enter into any debate on the points
of religion in which we may not agree, farther than you shall give me leave.'

I told him his carriage was so modest, that! could not but acknowledge
it ;_ that it was true, we were such people as they called heretics. but that
he'wu not the first catholic! had convened with. without falling into in-
couveniences, or carrying the questions to any height in debate; that he

us; and if we did not converse without any dislike on either side. it should
be his-fo'ult, not ours.

He replied, that he thought all our conversation might be easily separated
from disputes; that it was not his business to cap principles with every man
he conversed with; and that he rather desired me to converse with him as
a gentleman than as s religionist ; and that, if 1 would give him leave at any
time to discourse upon religious subjects, he would readily comply with it,
and that he did not doubt but I would allow him also to defend his own opi-
nions as well as he could 5 but that, without my leave, he would not break
in upon me with any such thing. He told me farther, that he would not
cease to do all that became him, in his office as a priest as well as a private
Christian, to procure the good ot'the ship, and the safety of all that was in
her; and though, perhaps, we would not join with him, and he could not
pray with us, he hoped he might pray for us. which he would do upon all
occasions. In this manner we convened; and, as he was of the most
obliging, gentleman-like behaviour, so he was, if! may be allowed to say so,
a man of good sense, and, as! believe, of great learning.

He gave me a most diverting account of his life, and of the many exam
ordinsry events of it; of many adventures which had hefsllen him in the few
years that he had been abroad in the world; and particularly'this was very
semarkahle, viz" that in the voyage he was now engaged in, he had the
misfortune to be five times shipped and unshipped, and never to go to the
place whither any of the ships he was in were at first designed. That his.
first intent was to have gone to Mortinico, and that he went on board a ship- :
bound thither at St. Mala: but. being (creed into Iisboohy bad weather,
the ship received some damage by running aground in the month of the river
rogue, snd was obliged to unload heroergo there; but finding a. Portuguese
ship there bound to the Madeirss, and reody to soil, and Supposing he should
easily meet with a vessel there bound to Martinico, he went (inboard, in
order to sail to the Madeira; hot the Master of-the Portuguese ship, being
but no indifl'ereot mariner, had been out of his reckoning, and they drove to
Faye! ; where, however, he happened to find a very good market for his
cargo, which was com, and therefore resolved not to go to the Msdeiras,
but to load salt at the isle of May, and to go away to Newfoundland. He
had no remedy in this exigeoce but to go with the ship, and had a-pretty
good voyage as far as the Banks (so they call the place where they catch the
fish); where meeting with a French ship bound {rem France to Quebec, in
the river of Canada, and from thence to Martinioo, to carry provisions, he
thought he should have an opportunity to complete his first design. but
when he came to Quebec, the master of the ship died, and the vessel pro.
needed no farther: so the next voyage be shipped himself for. ,an'oe; iii/the

ship that'was burned when we took them up at sea ; and then' shipped with '

us for the East Indies. as I have already said. Thus he had been disap-
pointed in five voyages, all, as i may call it, in one voyage, besideo'whetl
shall have occasion to mention further at the same person.

But i shall not make digression into other menu stories. which have no
relation to my own: I return to what concerns our afl'airsin the island. He
came to me one morning, for be lodged among us alithe while we were upon
the island, and it happened to he just when] was going to visit the English
men's colony, at the farthest part of the island: I say, he come to me, and
told me, with a very grave countenance. that he had for two or three days
desired an opportunity of some discourse with me. which he hoped would
not be displeasing to me. because he thought it might in me measnge cor.
respond with my general design, which was, the prosperity of my new
colony, and perhaps might put it, at least more. than he yet thought it was.
in the way at God' s blessing.

I looked a little surprised at the last port of his discourse, and turning s
little short, 'How, sir,' said I, 'oen it beanid that we are not in the myof
God's blessing, alter such visible assistance and wonderful delireraooesu
we have seen here, and of which I have given you a large account i'm' if you

crane, were the objects of dmne vengeance, and bore the weight of that
punishment: '

I was sensibly touched with his discourse, and told him his inference was
so just. and the whole design seemed so sincere, and was really so religious
in its own natare, that I was very sorry I had interrupted him, and begged
him to go on: and, in the mean time, because it seemed that what we had
both to say might take up some time, I told him I was going to the English-
men's plantations, and asked him to go with me, and we might discourse of
it by the way. He told me he would the more willingly waiton me thither,
because there partly the thing was acted which he desired to speak to me
about; so we walked on, and I pressed him to be free and plain with me in
what he had to say.

' Why then, sir,' says he, ' be pleased to give me leave to lay down a few
propositions, as the foundation of what I have to say, that we may not differ
in the general principbs, though we may be of some difl'ering opinions in the
practice of particulars. First. sir, though we differ in some of the doctrinal
articles of religion, and it is very unhappy it is so, especially in the case
before as, as 1 shall shew atlervvards. yet there are some general principles
in which we both agree, viz, that there is a God 5 and that this God having
given us some stated general rules for our service and obedience, we ought
not willingly and knowingly to offend him, either by neglecting to do what
he has commanded, or by doing what he has exprevnly forbidden; and, let
our different religions be what they will, this general principle is readily
owned by us all, that the blessing of God does not ordinarily follow pre-
sumptuous sinoing against his command; and every good Christian will be
afi'ectionately concerned to prevent any that are under his one living in a
total neglect of God and his commands. It is not your men being Protest-
ants, whatever my opinion may be of such, that discharges me from being
concerned for their souls, and from endeavouring, it' it lies before me, that}
they should live in as little distance from enmity with their Maker as possible ,
especially if you give me leave to meddle so far in your circuit.'

I could not yet imagine what he aimed at, and told'him I granted all he
had said, and thanked him that he would so far concern himself for as ; and
begged he would explain the particulars of what he had observed, that, like
Joshua, to take his own parable, I might put away the scanned thing
from us

' Why then, sir,' says he, ' I will take the liberty you give me; and there it
are three things, which, if I am right, must stand in the way of God's blessing"; -

their own, to see removed : and, air, I promise myself that you will fully agree
withme in them all, as soon asl namethen); especially becauselshallcone-
Vince you that every one ofthem may, with great ease, and very much to your
satishction. be remedied. First, sir,' says he, ' you have hmfour English-
men, who have fetched women from among the savages, and have taken
them as their wives, and have had many children by them all, and yet are

there was no clergyman or priest of any kind, or of any profession, to perform
the ceremony. , nor any pen and ink, or paper, to write down a contract of
marriage, and have it signed between them: and I know also, sir, what the
Spaniard governor has told you, I mean, of the agreement that he obliged
them to make when they took those women; viz, that they should choose
them out by consent.~and keep separately to them; which, by the way. is
nothing of a marriage, no agreement with the women, as wires, but only an
agreement among themselves. to keep them from quarrelling Bot, air, the

to compel the man and woman, at all times, to own and acknowledge each
other; obliging the man to abuain from all other women, to engage in no
other contract while these subsist, and, on all occasions, as ability allows, to

says he, ' these men may, when they please, or when occasion presents,
abandon these women, disown their children, leave them to perish, and
take other women, and marry them while time are living :' and here he
added, with some warmth, ' How, air, is God honoured in this unlawful
liberty? and how shall a blessing succeed your endeavours in this place,
however good in themselves, and however sincere in your design, while these
men, who at present are your subjects, under your absolute government and
dominion, are allowed by you to live in open adultery?

I confess I was struck with the thing itselt; but much more with the con-
_rlucing armaments he supported it with; for it was certainly true, that
though they had no clergyman upon the spot, yet a formal contract on both

in", made before witnesses. and confirmed by any token which they had all
agreed to be bound by, though it had been but breaking a stick between
them, engaging the men to own these women for their wives upon all ocea-

some with therr husbands, had been an efi'ectual lawful marriage in thesight. _

I was so dull stsll, that I did not take him right , but I imagined that, by

as e LQ66 ""3- can use nun sovenruaes:

. putting an end to it, he meant that I should psi-t them, and not under them to
live together any longer: and I said to him I could not do that, by any mean",
for that It would put the whole island into confusion. He seemed surprised
that I should so far mistake him. ' No, sir,' says he, '1 do not mean that
you should now separate them, but legally and ed'eetually marry them now;
and as, sir, my way of marrying them may not be easy to reconcile them to,
though it will he ell'ectual, even by your own laws, so your way may be as
well before God, and as valid among men; I mean, by a written contract
signed by both man and woman, and by all the witnesses present, which all
the laws of Europe would decree to be valid.'

I was amazed to see so much true piety, and so much sincerity of zeal,
besides the unusual impartiality in his discourse as to his own party or church,
and such true warmth for preserving the people that he had no knowledge
of or relation to; I say, for preserving them from transgressing the laws of
God, the like of which I had indeed not met with any where: but, recol-
lecting what he had said of marrying them by a written contract, which I
knew he would stand to, I returned it back upon him, and told him. 1
granted all that he had said to he just, and, on his part, very kind; that
I would discourse with the men upon the point now, when I came to them
and I knew no reason why they should scrapie to let him marry them all,
which i knew well enough would be granted to be as authentic and valid in
England as if they were married by one of our own clergymen; what was
afterwards done in this matter, I shall speak of it by itself. '

1 then pressed him to tell me what was the second complaint which he
had to make, acknowledging that I was very much his debtor for the first,
and thanked him heartily for it. He told me he would use the some free-
dom and plninness in the second, and hoped I would take it as well; and
this was, that, notwithstanding these English subjects of mine, as he called
them, had lived with those women for almost seven years, had taught them
to speak English, and even to read it, and that they were, as he perceived,
women ot' tolerable understanding, and capable of instruction, yet they had
not, to this hour, taught them any thing of the Christian religion, no, not so
much as to know that there was a God, or a worship, or in what manner
God was to he served; or that their own idolatry, and worshipping they
knew not whom, was false and absurd. This, he said. was an unaccountable
neglect, and what God would certainly call them to account. for, sntL'per-v .
hops, at last, take the work out of their hands--die spoke this very aEectiouo
ately, and warmly. ' 1 am persuaded; says he, ' had those m lived in
the savage country whence their wives come, the savages would have taken
more pains to have brought them to be idolaters, and to worship the devil,
than any of these men, so far as t can see, have taken with them to tench
them the knowledge of the true God. Now, sir,' said he, ' though I do not
acknowledge your religion, or you mine, yet we would be glad tosee the
devil's servants, and the subjects of his kingdom. taught to know the general
principles of the Christian religion; that they they might, at least, hear or
God and s Redeemer, and of the resurrection, and of a future state,--things
which we all believe; they has), at least, been so much nearer coming into '

idolatry and devil-worship:

I could hold no longer; I took him in my arms, and embraced him with an
excess of passion. ' How far,' said I to him, 'hare I been fromundersbaoding

tian church, and the good of other men' s souls: l scarce have known what

am going away.'--' Will you give me leave to talk with these poor men about
it t'---' Yes, with all my heart,' said I; ' and will oblige them to give heed
to what you say too.'--' As to that,' said he, ' we must leave them to the
mercy of Christ; but it is your business to assist them, encourage them, and
instruct them; and, if you give me leave, and God his blessing, I do not doubt
but the poor ignorant souls shall be brought home to the great circle of
Christianity, if not into the particular faith we all embrace, and that even
while you stay here.' Upon this, I said, 1 shall not only giro you leave, but
give you a thousand thanks for it. What followed on this account, I shall
mention also again in its place. "

I now pressed him for the third article in which we were to blame.
' Why, really, says he, ' it is of the same nature; and I will proceed, asking
your leave, with the same plainness as before: it is about your poor savages,
who are, as 1 may say, your conquered subjects. It is a maxim, sir, that is
or ought to be received among all Christians, ol' what church or pretended
church soever; viz, The Christian knowledge ought to be propagated by all
pomible means, and on all possible occasions. It' is on this principle that our
church sends missionaries into Persia, indie, China; and that our clergy.
even of the superior sort, willingly engage in the most hazardous voyages,
and the most dangerous residence among murderers and barbarians, to teach
them the knowledge of the true God, and to bring them over to embrace
the'Christian faith. Now, sir, you have such an opportunity here to have
six or serenand-tbirty poor savages brought over from idolatry to the know.

ledge of God, their Maker and Redeemer, that I wonder how you can pass' '
' such an occasion of doing good, which' is really worth the expense ofa man 's
whole life.'

1 was now struck dumb, indeed, and had not one word to say. Iliad here
a spirit of true Christian zeal for God anal religion before me, lethis particu-
lar principles be of what kind soever: as for me, I had not so much as ea-
tertained a thought of this to my heart before, and I believe I should" not
have thought of it; for I looked upon these savages as slaves, and people
whom, had we had any work for them to do, we would have used as such.
or would have been glad to have transported them to any other part of the
world: for our business was to get rid of them; and we would all have been
satisfied if they had been sent to any country, so they had never seen their
own. But to the ease;~--l say, I was confounded at his discourse, and knew
not what answer to make him.

He looked earnestly at me, seeing me in some disorder-d Sir,' says he,
' I shall be very sorry if what I have caid gives you any offence '--' No, no,'
said I, ' I am offended with nobody but myself; but I am perfectly con.
founded. not only to think that I should never take any notice 03' this before,
but with reflecting what notice I am able to take of it now. You know,-
sir,' said i, ' what circumstances I am in; I am bound to the East Indies in
a ship freigbled by merchanta. and to whom it would be an iusufi'erable piece
of injustice to detain their ship here, the men lying all this while at virtuals
and wages on the owners' account. It is true, I agreed to be allowed twelve
days here, and, it! stay more, I must pay three pounds sterling per diam dc.
murrage; nor can I stay upon demurrage above eight days more, and l have
been here thirteen already; so that I am perfectly unable to engage in this
work, unless I would sufi'er myself to be left behind here again; in which
case, if this single ship should misearry in any part of her voyage, I should.
be just in the same condition that l was lelt in here at first. and from which
I have been so wonderfully delivered. He owned the case was very have
upon me, as to my voyage; but laid it home upon my conscience, whether
the blessing of saving thirty-seven souls was not worth venturing all I had in
the world for. I was not soaensiblc of that as he was. I returned upon him
thus: ' Why, air, it is a valuable thing, indeed. to be an instrument in God's
hand to convert thirty-seven lieatlrcns to the knowledge of Christ; but as
you are an ecclesiastic. and are given over to the work, so that it seems so
naturally to (all into the way of your profession, how it is then that you do
not rather ofl'er yourself to'gndertake it, than press me to do it?

Upon this he faced about jnxt before me, as he walked along, and putting
me to a full stop, made me a very low how. 'I most heartily thank God and
you, air,' said he, ' for giving me so evident a call to so blessed a work; and
if you think yourself discharged from it, and desire me to undertake it, I will
moat readily do it, and think it a happy reward for all the hazards and dilli~
culties of such a broken, disappointed voyage as I have met with, that I am
dropped, at least, into so glorious a work.'

i discovered a kind of rapture in his face while he spoke this to me; his
eyes sparkled like tire, hie face glowed, and his colour came and went, as if
he had been falling into tits; in a word, he was fired with the joy of being
embarked in such a work. l paused a considerable while before! could tell
what to say to him; for I was really surprised to find a man of such sin-
cerity and zeal, and carried out in his zeal beyond the ordinary rate of men,
not of his profession only, but even of any profession whatsoever. But altar
I had considered it awhile. I asked him seriously it' he was in earnest, and ,
that he would venture, on the single consideration of an attempt on those
900? people, to be locked up in an unpleuted island for perhaps his life, and
at last might not know whether he should be able to dothem good or not?

He turned short upon me, and asked me what I called a venture! ' Pray.
sir,' said he, ' what do you-think-ltoneented-to go in your ship to the Eat '--

ladies for!'----' Nay,' said I, ' that I know not, unless it was to preach to the
Indisne'a-J Donhtless it was,' said he; ' and do you think, if I can convert
these thirtyaseven 'men to the faith of Jesus Christ, it is not worth my time,
though I should never be (etched 06- the island again 2 nay. is it not infi-
nitely of more worth to save so many souls than my life is. or the life of
twenty more of the some profession? Yes, sir,' says he, ' I would give Christ
and the blessed Virgin thanks all my days, if I could be made the least happy
instrument of saving the souls of those poor men, though I were never to set
my foot 06' this island, or see my native country any more. But since you
will honour me with putting me into this work, for which I will prey for
you all the days of my life, I have one humble petition to you besides---
' What is that!" said I. ' Why; says he, ' it is, that you will leave your
man Friday with me, to be my interpreter to them, and to assist me; for
without some help I moot speak to them, or they to me.' '

I was sensibly touched at his requesting Friday, because I could not think
of parting with him, and that for many reasons: he had been the companion
of my travels; he was not only arithfnl to me, but sincerely afi'ectionate to
the last degree; and 1 had resolved to do something considerable for him if
he outlived me, as it was probable he would. Then i knew that as I had
bred Friday up to be a Protestant. it would quite confound bins to bring him
to embrace another profession; and he would never, while his eyes were
open, believe that his old master was a heretic, and would be damned; and
this might, in the end, ruin the poor fellow} principles, and so turn him book
again to his first idolatry. However, a sudden thought relieved me in this
strait. and it was this: I told him I could not say that I was willing to part '
with Friday on any account whatever, though a work that to him was of
more value than his life, ought to he to me d'ntnch more value than the
keeping or parting with a servant. But, on the other hand, 1 was persuaded
that Friday would by no means agree to part with me; and I could not t'ome
him to it without his consent, without manifest injustice; because I had
promised I would never put him away, and he had promised and engaged to
me that he would never leave me nnloa I put him away.

He seemed very much concerned at it, for he had no rational access to
these poor people, seeing he did not understand one word of their language.
not they one word of his. To remove this diflicnlty, I told him Friday's.
father had learned Spanish, which I found he also understood, and he should .
serve him as an interpreter. So he was much better satisfied, and nothing
could pemmde him bot he would stay and endeavour to convert them; but
Providence gave another very happy turn to all this. '

I come heck now to the first port of his objections When we came to
the Englishmen, I sent for them all together, and alter some account given
them of what I had done for them, via, what necessary things I had put>>
vidcd for them, and how they were distributed, which they were very sen.
sible of. and very thankful for, I began to tail: to them of the scandalous life
they led, and gsve them 3 full account of the notice the clergyman had taken

them if they were married men or bachelors? They soon explained their
conditions to me, and showed that two of them were wulowen, and the other
three were single men, or bachelors. I asked them with what conscience
they could take those women, and lie with them as they had done, call them
their wives, and have so many children by them, and not be lawfully mar-
ried to them 3'

They all gave me the answer I expected, viz, that there was nobody to
marry them; that they agreed betbre the governor to keep them as their
wives, and to maintain them and own them as their wives; and they thought,
as things stood with them, they were as legally married as if they had been
married by a parsou, and with all the lbrmalities in the world.

Itolil them that no doubt they were married in the sight of God, and
were bound in conscience to keep them as their wives; but that the laws of
men being otherwise, they might desert the poor women and children here~
alter; and that their wives being poor desolate women, fileodless and money-
less, would have no way to help themselves: I therefore told them that
unless I was assured of their honest intent, I could do nothing for them. but
would take care that what I did should be for the women and children with>>
out them; and that unless they would give me some assurances that they
would marry the wanien, I could not think it was convenient they should
continue together as man and wife; for that it was both scandalous to men
and olfensive to God, who they could not think would bless them il' they
went on thus.

All this went on as I expected: and they told me, especially Will Atkins,
who now seemed to Speak for the rest, that they loved their wives as well as
if they had been born in their own native country, and would not leave them
upon any account whatever; and they did verily believe their wives were
as virtuous and as modest, and did, to the utnmst of their skill, as much for
them and for their children, as any women eonhl possibly do; and they
would not part with them on any account: and Will Atkins, for his own
particular, added, that if any man would take him away, and offer to carry
him home to England, and make hint captain of the best ntan-of~tvar in the
navy, he would not go with him, if he might not carry his wife and children
with him; and if there was a clergyman in the ship, he would be married to
her now with all his heart.

This was just as i would have it: the priest was not with me at that-mo-
ment, but was not far off; so, to try him further, i told him I had a clergy.
man with me, and, if he was sincere, i would have him married next morning,
and bade him consider of it, and talk with the rest. He said, as for himself,
he need not consider of it at all, for he \\ as very ready to do it, and was glad I
had a minister with me, and he believed they would be all willing also. i
then told him that my friend, the minister, was a Frenchman, and could not
speak English, but 1 would act the clerk between them. lie ueverso much
as asked me whether he was a Papist or Protestant, which was, indeed,
what i was afraid of; so we parted; I went back to my clergyman, and
Will Atkins went in to talk with his companions. Idcsired the French

gentleman not to any any thing to them till the business was thorough ripe;
and I told him what answer the men had given me.

Before 1 went from their quarter, they all came to me, and told me they
had been considering what I had said; that they were glad to hear I had a
clergyman in my company, and they were very willing to give me the wtis~
{action 1 desired, and to be formally married as soon as I pleased; for they
were far from desiring to part with their wives, and that they meant nothing
but what was very honest when they chose them. So I appointed them to
meet me the next morning; and, in the mean time, they should let their
wives know the tneaning ol' the marriageiaw; and that it was not only to
prevent any scandal, but also to oblige them that they should not forsake
them, whatever might happen.

The women were easily made sensible of the meaning of the thing, and
were very well satisfied with it, as indeed they had reason to he: so they
failed not to attend all together at my apartment next morning, where I
brought out my clergyman; and though he had not on a minister's gown, alter
the manner of England, or the habit of a priest, after the manner of France,
yet having a black rest, something like a tussock, with a sash round it, he
did not look very unlike a minister; and as for his language, I was his inten--
preter. But the seriousness of his behaviour to them, and the scrnples he
made of marrying the women, because they were not baptized and professed
Christians, gave them an exceeding reverence for his person; and there was
no need, alter that, to inquire whether he was a clergyman or not. Indeed,
I was afraid his scruples would have been carried so far, as that he would not
have married them at all; nay, notwithstanding all I was able to say to him,
be resisted me, though modestly, yet very steadily: and at last refused abso~
lutely to marry them, unless he had first talked with the men and the wo-
men too; and though at first I was a little backward to it, yet at last I agreed
to it with a good will, perceiving the sincerity of his design.

When he came to them, be let them know that I had acquainted him with
their circumstances. and with the present design; that he was very willing
to perform that part of his function, and marry them, as i had desired; but
that before he could do it, he must take the liberty to talk with them. He
told them, that in the sight of all inditi'erent men, and in the sense of the
laws of society, they had lived alt this while in open fornication; and that it
was frue, that nothing but the consenting to marry, or effectually separating
them from one another, could now put an end to it ; but there was s diffi--
culty in ittoo, with respect to the laws of Christian matrimony, which he
was not fully satisfied about, viz, that of marrying one that is a professed
Christian to a savage, an idolater, and a heathen, one that is not baptized;
and yet that he did not see that there was time leg to endeavour to persuade
the women to be baptized, or to profess the name of Christ, whom they had,
be doubted, heard nothing of, and without which they could not be baptized.
He told them he doubted they were but inditi'erent Christians themselves;
that they had but little knowledge of God or of his ways, and therefore he
could not expect that they had said much to their wires on that head yet I
but that unless they would promise him to use their endeavours with their
wires to persuade them to become Christians, and would, as well as they
could, instruct them in the knowledge and belief of God that made them,
and to worship Jesus Christ that redeemed theni, he could not marry them ,
for he would have no hand in joining Christians with sawages; nor was it
consistent with the principles of the Christian religion, and was indeed ex-
pressly forbidden in God's law. '

They heard all this very attentively, and I delivered it very faithfully to
them from his mouth, as near his own words as I could; only sometimes

adding something of my own, to conviuoe them how just it was, and how I
was of his mind: and I always very faithfully distinguished between what I
said for myself, and what were the clergyman's words. They told me it was
very true what the gentleman said, that they were very indifl'erent Christians
themselves, and that they had never talked to their wives about religion
' Lord, sir,' says W ill Atkins, 'bosw should we teach them religion 1 why,
we know nothing Ourselves; and besides, sir,' said he, "should we talk to
them of God and Jesus Christ, and heaven and hell, it would make them
laugh at us, and ask us what we believe ourselves? And if we should tell
them that we believe all the things we speak of to them, such as of good
people going to heaven, and wicked people to the dew], they would ask us
where we intend to go ourselves, that believe all this, and are such wicked
fellows as we indeed are 1 Why. sir, 'tis enough to give them a surfeit of reli-
gion at first hearing; {bills must have some religion tlmmaelveo before they
pretend to teach other people.'--- Will Atkins, said I to him, " though I am
afraid that what you say has too much truth in it, yet can you not tell your
wife she is in the wrong; that there is a God, and a religion betterthan her
own; that her gods are idols; that they can neither hear nor speak; that
there is a great Being that made all things and that can destroy all that he
has made; that he rewards the good and punishes the bad; and that we are
to be judged by him at last for all we do here i You are not so ignorant, but
even nature itselt' will teach you that all this is true; and lam satisfied you
know it all to be true, and believe it yourself.'- -'That is true, sir, said
Atkins; ' but with what face can I say any thing to my wife of all this,
when she will tell me immediately it cannot be true t'w-'Not true l' said I;
'what. do you mean by that?-----' Why, sir,' said he, ' she will tell me it

wicked creature as she knows I have been, even to her, and to every body

contrary to what I must tell her ll good, and to what l ought to have done:
u-'Why, truly, Atkins, said I, '1 am afraid thou speeltest too much truth:

impatient to know. '01:." said the priest, 'tell'him there is one thing will.

for none teach repentance like true penitents. He wants nothingbnt to
repeat, and then he will be so much the better qualified to instmcthitm:

W.-
he mil then be able to tell her that there is not only a God, and that he is
the just rewarder ofgood and evrl, but that he is a merciful being, and with
infinite goodness and long:sutl'ering forbears to punish those that ofi'eud
waiting to be gracious, and willing not the death of a sinner, but rather that
he should return and live: that oftentimes he sutfers wicked men to go a
long time, and even reserves damnation to the general day of retribution;
that it is a clear evidence of God and of a future state, that righteous men
receive not their reward, or wicked men their punishment, till they come
into another world; and this will lead him to teach his wife the doctrine of
the resurrection and of the last judgment, Let him but repent for himself,
he will be an excellent preacher of repentance to his wife!

I repeated all this to Atkins, who looked very serious all the while, and
who, we could easily perceive, was more than ordinarily affected with it:
when being eager, and hardly suflerlng me to make an end--4 I know all
this, master,' says he, 'and a great deal more; but I have not'the impudeuce
to talk thus to my wife, when God and my conscience know, and my wife
will be an undeniable evidence against me, that l have lived as it"! had never

heard of a God, or future state, or any thing about it, and to talk of my -

repentingnlssl (and with that he fetched a deep sigh, and I could see that
the tears stood in his eyes), 'tis past all that with rne.'--' Past it, Atkins 9'
said I ; ' what dost thou mean by that i'---' 1 know well enough what I mean,'
says he; ' I mean 'tis to?>> late, and that is too true.'

l told the clergyman, word for word, what he said: the poor zealous priest,
~I must call him so, for, be his opinion what it will, he had certainly a men
singular afi'ection for the good of other men's souls, and it would be hard to
think he had not the like for his own,-~I say, this afi'cctionate man could
not refrain from tears; hut, recovering himself, said to me, 'Ask him but
one question; Is he easy that it is too late; or is be troubled, and wishes it
were not so? I put the question fairly to Atkins; and he answered, with a
great deal of passion, ' How could any man be easy in a condition that must
certainly end in eternal destruction 2 that he was for item being easy; but
that, on the contrary, he believed it would, one time or other, win him.'
' What do you mean by that? said I. ' W'hy,' he said, 'he believed he
should, one time or other, cut his throat, to put an end to the terror of it.'

' ~The clergyman shook his head, with great concern in his face, when I
hold lg'tn all this; but turning quick to me upon it, says, ' if that be his case,
we may assure him it is not too late; Christ will give him repentance. But,
pray,' says he, ' explain'this to him; that as no man is saved but by Christ,
and the merit of his'passion procuring divine mercy for him, how can it be

1 mid Atkins all time, and he heard me mth great earnestness; botit
seemed as it lie towed ofl' the discourse to the rest. for he said to me, he
would go and have some talk with his wife: so he went out awhile, and we
talked to the rest. I perceived they were all stupidly ignorant as to matters
of religion, as much as I was when Iwent rambling away from my father;
and yet there were none of them backward to hear what had been said;
and all of them seriously promised that they would talk with their wives
about it, and do their endeavours to persuade them to turn Christians.

The clergyman smiled upon me when I reported what answer they gave,
but said nothing a good while; but at last shaking his bad, ' We that are
Christ's servants,' says he, 'can go no farther than to exhort and instruct;
and when men comply, submit to the reproof, and promise what we ask, 'tis
all we can do; we are bound to accept their good words; but, believe me,
sir,' said he, ' whatever you may have known of the life of that man you call
Will Atkins, I believe he is the only sincere convert among them: i take that
man to be a true penitent: I will not despair of the rest; but that man is
apparently struck with a sense of his past life, and I doubt not. when he
comes to talk of religion to his wife, he will talk himself effectually into it;
for attempting to teach others is sometime"! the best way ofteaching ourselves.
i know a man, who, having nothing but a summary notion of religion him-
self, and being wicked and prodigate to the last degree in his life, made a
thorough reformation in himself by labouring to convert a Jew. If that poor
Atkins begins but once to tail: seriously of Jesus Christ to his wife, my life
for it, he talks himself intoa thorough convert, makes himself a penitent,
and who knows what may follow t

Upon this discourse, however, and their promising, as above, to endea-
wont to persuade their wives to embrace Christianity, he married the other
two couple; but Will Atkins and his wife were not yet come in. After
this, my clergyman waiting awhile, was curious to know where Atkins was
gone ' and turning to me, said, 'I entreat you, sir, let us walk out of your
labyrinth here, and look; I dare say we shall find this poor man somewhere
or other talking seriously to his wife, and teaching her already something of
religion) I began to be of the same mind; so we went out together, and I
carried him a way which none knew but myself, and where the trees were
so very thick that it was not easy to see through the thicket of leaves, and
far harder to see in than to see out; when coming to the edge of thawood.
I saw Atkins and his tawny wife sitting under the shadeof abnsb, very
eager in discourse: i stopped short till my clergyman came up to me, and
then having showed him where they were, we stood and looked very
steadily at them a good while. \Ve observed him very earnest with her,
pointing up to the sun, and to every quarter of the heavens, and then down
to the earth, then out to the see, then to himself, then to her, to the woods,
to the trees. 'Now,' says the clergyman, 'you see my words are made
good, the man preaches to her; mark him now, he is telling her that our
God has made him and her, and the hesvens, the earth, the see. the wooden,
the trees, trot--'1 believe he is: said I. immediately we perceived Will,...,.,w.. .. ..,_.... -,

We supposed he said something, but we could not hear him; it was too for
liar that. He did not continue kneeling halts minute, but comessnd sits
down again by his wife, and talks to her again; we perceived then the
woman very attentive, but whether she said any thing to him, we could not
tell. While the poor fellow was upon his knees, 1 could see the'tesn nan
plentilhlly down my clergymsn's cheeks, and i could hardly forbesr myself;
but it was a great aflliction to us both that we were not near enough to hear
any thing that peered between them. Well, however, we could come no
nearer, for fear of disturbing then); so we resolved to see an end of this
piece of still conversation, and it spoke loud enough to us without the help
of voice. He sat down sgain, as I have said, close by her, and talked again
earnestly to her, and two or three titnes' we could see him embrace her most
passionately; another time we saw him take out his handkerchief and wipe
her eyes, and then kiss her again, with a kind of transport very unusual;
and alter several of these things, we saw him on a sudden jump up again,
and lend her his hand to help her up, when immediately leading her by the
hand a step or two, they both hueeled down together, and continued so
about two minutes.

My friend could hear it no longer; but cries out aloud, 'St. Paul! St.
Paul! behold he prayeth.' I was afraid Atkins would hear him, therefore!
eutreated him to withhold himself awhile, that we might see an end of the
scene, which to me, I must confess, was the most alfecting that ever I saw
in my life. Well, he strove with himself for awhile, but was in such rap-
ture: to think that the poor heathen woman was become a Christian, that he
was not able to contain himself; he weptseveral times, then throwing up
his hands and crowing his breast, said over several things ejaculatory, and
by way of givirtg God thanks for so miraculous a testimony of the success of
our endeavours; some he spoke softly, and I could not well hear others;
some in Latin, some in French; then two or three times the tears would

interrupt him, that he could not speak at all; but I begged that he would
contain trimelf, and let us more narrowly and fully observe what was before
us, which he did for a time, the scene not being near ended yet; {or alter
the poor man and his wife were risen again from their knees, we observed
he stood talking still eagerly to her, and we observed her motion, that she
was .greatly affected with-what he said, by her frequently lilting up her
hands, laying her hand to her breast, and such other postures as express
the greatest seriousness and attention: this continued about halt'n quarter of
an hour, and then they walked away; so we could see no more of them in
that situation. I took this interval to talk with my clergyman; and first.
I was glad to see the particulars we had both been witnesses to, that, though
I was hard enough of belief in such costs, yet that I began to think it was
silvery sincere here, both in me man and his wife, however ignm not they
might both be, and limped such a beginning would yet have a more happy
end : 'And who knows,' said I, 'but these two may in time, by, instruction
and example, work. uponsome of the others i'--' Some of them? said he.
turning quick upon me: 'aye, upon all of them: depend upon it, if those
two savages, for he has been but little better, as you relate it, should embrace
Jesus Christ, they will never leave it till they work upon all the rest; for
true religion is naturally communicative, and he that is once made a Christian
will never leave a pagan behind him, if he can help it.' I owned it was a
most Christian principle to think so, and a testimony of true zeal, as well as
a generous heart, in him. 'Bnt, my friend} said I, ' will you give me leave
to start one difficulty here? I cannot tell how to object the least thing against
that affectionate concern which you shew for the turning the poor people
from their paganism to the Christian religion: but how does this comfort
you, while these people are, in your account. out of the pale of the catholic
church, without which you believe there is no salvation ? so that you esteem
these but heretie's, for other reasons as effectually lost as the Pagans them-
selves}

To this he answered, with abundance of candour, thus: 'Sir, I am a
catholic ot' the Roman churrh, and a priest of the order of St. Benedict, and
I embrace all the principles of the Roman faith; but yet, it' you will believe
me, and that I do not speak in compliment to you, or in respect to my cira
cumstances and your civilitics; I say, nevertheless, 1 do not look upon you.
who call yourselves reformed, without some charity: I tlare not say (though
I know it is our opinion in general) that you cannot be saved; I will by no
means limit the mercy of Christ so far as to think that he cannot receive you
into the bosom of his ehnrrh, in a manner to us nnperceivable; and! hope
you have the same charity for no: I pray daily for your being all restored to
Christ's church, by whatsoever method he, who is all-wise, is pleased to
direct. In the mean time, sure you will allow it consists with me, as a
Roman, to distinguish far between a protestant and a pagan; between one
that calls on Jesus Christ, though in a way which I do not think is according
to the true faith. and a Savage or a barbarian, that knows no God, no
Christ, no Redeemer; and if you are not within the pale of the catholic
church, we hope you are nearer being restored to it than those that know
nothing of God or of his church 2 and l rejoice, therefore, when 1 see this
poor man. who you say has been a profiigate. and almost a murderer.
kneel down and pray to Jesus Christ, as we snppme he did, though not fully
enlightened: believing that God, from whom every such work proceeds,
will sensibly tench his heart, and bring him to the farther knowledge of that
truth in his own time: and if God shall influence this poor man to convert
and instruct the ignorant savage. his wife, I can never believe that he shall
be cast away himself. Ami have i not reason then to rejoice the nearer any
are brought to the knowledge of Christ, though they may not be brought
quite home into the bosom ofthe catholic rhurch just at the time when l may
desire it, leaving it to the goodness of Christ to perfect ins work in his own
time, and in his own way ? Certainly, I would rejoice if all the savages in
Amerien were brought, like this poor woman, to pray to God, though they
were all to be protestant: at first, rather than they should continue pagans
or heathens: firmly believing, that he that had bestowed the first light to

.v'
them would farther illuminate them with a beam of his heavenly grace, and
bring them into the pole of his church. when he should see good.'

i was astonished at the sincerity and temper of this pious pnpist, as much
as l was oppremed by the power of his reasoning; and it presently occurred
to my thoughts, that it' such a temper was universal, we might be all
catholic Christiana, whatever church or particular profession we joined in :
that a spirit of charity would soon work us all up into right principles; and
as he thought that the like charity would make us all catholics, so I told him
I believed had all the members of his church the like moderation, they would
soon all be protestonls.--And there we left that part; for we never disputed

' at all.

However, l talked to him another way, and taking him by the hand, 'My
friend; says l, 'I wish all the clergy of the Romisl) church were blast with
such moderation, and haul an equal share ofyour charity. 1 am entirely of
your opinion: but I must tell you, that if you should preach such doctrine
in Spain or ltaly, they would put you into the Inquisition.'--' It may be so,'
still he; 'I know not what they would do in Spam or Italy; but! will not
513' they would be the better Christians for that severity; for I am sure there
is no heresy in aboundiug with charity.'

'Well, as Will Atkins and his wife were gone, our business there was over,
so we went book our own way; and when we came back, we found them
waiting to be called in: observing this, 1 asked my clergyman if we should
discover to him that we had seen him under the bush or not; and it was his
opinion we should not, but that we should talk to him first, and hear what
he would any to us; so we called him in alone, nobody being in the place
but ourselves, and l began with him thus:

it ill Atkins, said i, prithee what education had you? What was your
father ?

W. A. A better man than ever I shall be: Sir, niy father was a clergy.
man.

R. C. \Vhat education did he give you '4'

W. A. lle would have taught me well. sir; but I despised all education,
instruction. or correction, like a beast as I was.

R. C. It is true. Solomon s1ys, lie that despises reprool' is brulish.

W. A. Aye, sir, lwos hrutish indeed, for I murdered my father: for
God's sake, sir, talk no more about that; sir, I murdered my poor father.

Pr. Hal a murderer!

Here the priest started (for l interpreted every word as he spoke) and
Tooked pale: it seems he believed that Will had really killed his father.

" R. C. No, no, sir, I do not understand him so: Will Atkins, explain your-
self; you did not kill your father, did you, with your own hands?

W. A. No, air, I did not cut his throat; but I cut the thread of all his
comforts, and shortened his days: i broke his heart by the most ungrateful,
unnatural return, for the most tender and affectionate treatment that father
ever gave, or child could receive.
R. 6'. Well, 1 did not ask you about your father, to extort this confession:
l pray God give you repentance for it, and forgive that and all your other
sins! but I asked you because! seethat though you have not much learning,
yet you are not so ignorant as some are in things that are good; that you
have known more of religion, 3 great deal, than you have practised.

W. A. Though you, sir, did not extort the confession that l make about
my father, conscience does; and whenever we come to iook back upon our
lives, the sins against our indulgent parents are certainly the first that touch
us; the wounds they make lie deepest, and the weight they leave will lie
heaviest upon the mind, of all the aim we can commit.

R. C. You talk too feeliugly and senaibiy for me, Atkins; I cannot
hear it.

W. A. You hear it, muster! I dare say you know nothing of n.

R. 0. Yes, Atkins; every shore, every hill, nay, Imay say every tree
in this island, is witness to the anguish of my soul for my ingratitude and
bad rage of a good, tender father; a {other much like yours, by your
description: and I murdered my father as well as you, Will Atkins; but I
think, for all that, my repentance is short of yours too, by a great deal.

In'ould have said more, if I could have restrained my passions; but I
thought this poor man's repentance was so much sincerer than mine, that l
was going to leave all the discourse and retire; for I was surprised with
what he had said, and thought that instead of my going about to teach and
instruct him, the man was made a teacher and instructor to me in a most
surprising and unexpected nmmcr.

I laid all this before the young clergyman, who was greatly alfeeted with
it, and said to me, ' Did I not say, sir, that when thin man was converted he
would preach to us all? I tell you, sir. if this one man he made a true
pcnitent, here will he no need of me; he will make Christians of all in the
island.'-But having a little composed myself, I renewed my discourse with
"'ill Atkins. ' But Will; mid !, 'how tomes the sense of this matter to touch
you just now i"

W. A. Sir, you have set me about a work that has struck a. dart through
my very soul; Ihuvc been talking about God and religion to my wife, in
order, as you directed me, to make a Christian of her, and she has preached
such 9. sermon to me as I shall never forget while Ilive.

R. C'. No, no. it is not your wife has preached to you; but when you
were moving religious arguments to her, conscience has flung them back
upon you.

W A. Aye, air, with such force as is not to be resisted.

R. C'. Pray, \Vill, let us know what passed between you and your wife;
for I know something of It already.

W. A. Sir, it is impossible to give you a full account of it; I am too full
to hold it, and yet have no tongue to express it; but let her have said what
she will, and though I cannot give you an account of it, this I can tell you.
tlmt l have resolved to amend and reform my life .
R. 0. But tell us some of it: how did you begin, Will? For this has been
an extraordinary case, that is certain. She has preached a sermon, indeed,
if she has wrought this upon you.

17. A. Why, I first told her the nature of our laws about marriage, and
what the reasons were that men and women were obliged to enter into such
compacts, as it was neither in the power of one nor other to break; that,
otherwise, order and justice could not be maintained, and men would run
from their wives, and abandon their children, mix confusedly with one
another, and neither families he kept entire, nor inheritances he settled by
legal descent.

R. C. You talk like a civilian, 'Vill. Could you make her understand
what you meant by inheritance and families? They know no such things
among the savages, but marry any how, without regard to relation, consan-
guinity, or family; brother and sister, nay, as I have been told, even the
father and the daughter, and the son and the mother.

W. A. I believe, sir, you are misinformed, and my wife assures me of the
contrary, and that they abhor it; perhaps, for any farther relations, they
may not be so exact as we are; but she tells me they never touch one another

in the near relationship you speak of.

R. 0. Well, what did she say to what you told her?

IV. A. She said she liked it very well, and it was much better than in her
country.

1?. C. But did you tell her what marriage was? -

'W. A. Aye, aye; there began our dialogue. I asked her if she would be
married to me our way. She asked me what way that was. ltold her mar-
riage was appointed by God; and here we had a strange talk together, in-
deed, as ever man and wife had, I believe.

N. B. This dialogue between \Vill Atkins and his wife 1 took down in
writing, just after he had told it me, which was as follows :--

Wife. Appointed by your God! Why, have you a God in your country?

W. A. Yes, my dear, God is in every country.

Wi e. No your God. in my country; my country have the great old Bens-
muckee God.

W. A. Child, I am very unfit to shew you who God is; God is in heaven,
and made the heaven and the earth, the sea, and all that in them is.

Wi e. No makee de earth; no you God makee all earth; no makee
my country.

Will Atkins laughed a little at her expression of God not making her
country. -

Wife. No laugh; why laugh me ? This nothing to laugh.

He was justly reproved by his wife, for she was more serious than he
at first.

W. A. That's true, indeed ,- I will not laugh any more, my dear.

Wife. Why, you say you God make all?

W. A. Yes, child, our God made the whole world, and you and me, and
all things; for he isthe only true God, and there is no. God but'him; he
lures for over in heaven.

Wife. Why, you no tell me long ago?
W.A That's true, indeed; but I have been a wicked wreteh, and have

not only forgotten to acquaint thee with any thing before, but have lived
without God in the world myself.

Wa' c. What, have you a great God in your country, you no know hint 2
No say 0 to him i No do good thing for him? That no poeaihle.

W A It is true; though, for all that, we live as if there was no God in
heaven, or that he had no power on earth.

Wife. But why God let you do so? Why he no makce you good live?

W. A. It is all our own fault.

Wife. But you say me he is great, much great, have much great power,
can makee kill when he will, why he no makee kill when you no serve him?
No say 0 to him, no be good mans.

W. A. That is true, he might strike me dead; and I ought to expect it,
for I have been a wicked wretch, that is true; but God is merciful, and docs
not deal with us as we deserve.

Wi e. But then do you not tell God thankee for that too?

W. A. No, indeed, [ have not thanked God for his mercy, any more than
I have feared God for his power.

Wz' e. Then you God no God; we no think believe he be such one, great
much power, strong: no makee kill you, though you make him much angry.
: .5 "CA. What, will my wicked life hinder you from believing in God?

What a dreadful creature am I! and what a sad truth is it, that the horrid
lives of Christians hinder the conversion of heathens!

Wife. How me think you have great much God up there (ahe points up
to heaven), and yet no do well, no do good thing? Can he tell 2 Sure he no
tell what you do?

W. A. Yes, yes, he knows and sees all things; he hears us speak, sees
what we do, knows what we think, though we do not speak.

Wife. What! he no hear you curse, swear, speak de grout damn t

W. A. 'Yes, yes, he hears it all.

Wz' e. Where he then the much great power strong?

17. A. He is merciful, that is all we can say for it; and this proves him
to be the true God; he is God, and not man, and therefore we are not
consumed.

Here Will Atkins told us he was struck with horror, to think how he
could tell his wife so clearly that God sees, and hears, and knows the secret
thoughts of the heart, and all that we do, and yet that he had dared to do all
the vile things he had done.

Wi c. Merciful! What you call that?

'W. A. He is our father and maker, and he pitiep and spares no.

Wife. So then he never makee kill, never angry when you do Wicked;
then he no good himself, or no great able. .
'In.

V7.4. Yes, yes, my dear, he is infinitely good and infinitely great, and
able to punish too; and, sometimes, to shew his justice and vengeance, he
lets fly his anger to destroy sinners and make examples; many are cut of
in their sins.

W fe. But no makee kill you yet; then he tell you, may be, that he no
makee you kill; so you makee de bargain with him, you do bad thing, he
no be angry at you when he be angry at other mans.

W. A. No, indeed; my sins are all presumptions upon his goodness; and
he would be infinitely just if he destroyed me,-as he has done other men.

' Wife. Well, and yet no kill, no makee you dead; what you say to him
for that 1 You no-tell him thankee for all that too?

W. A. I am an nnthankful, ungrateful dog, that is true.

Wife. Why he no makee you much good better? you say he make you.

WA. He made me, as he made all the world: it is I have deformed
myself and abused his goodness, and made myself an abominable wretch.

Wife. I wish you makee God know me; I no makee him angry, I no do
bad wicked thing.

Here Will Atkins said his heart sunk within him, to hear a poor untsught
creature desire to be taught to know God, and he such a wicked wretch that
he could not say one word to her about God, but what the reproach of his
own carriage would make most irrational to her to believe; nay, that already
she had told him that she could not believe in God, because he, that was so

I wicked, was not destroyed.

W'. A. My dear, you mean, you wish I could teach you to know 663,
not God to know you; for he knows you already, and every thought in
your heart.

Wife. Why then he know what I say to you now; he know me wish to
know him; how shalee know who makee'met

W. A. Poor creature, he must teach thee, 1 cannot teach thee; I will pray
to him to teach thee to know him, and forgive me, that am unworthy to
teach thee.

The poor fellow was in such an agony at her desiring him to make her
know God, and her wishing to know him, that he said he fell down on his
knees before her, and prayed to God to enlighten her mind with the saving
knowledge of Jesus Christ, and to pardon his sins, and accept of his being
the unworthy instrument of instructing her in the principles of religion: after
which he sat down by her again, and their dialogue went on.--This was the
time when we saw him kneel down, and hold up his hands.

W fe What you put down the knee for? What you hold up the hand
for? What you say? Who you speak to? What' is all that t \

WV. 4. My dear, I how my knees in token of my submission to him that
made me; I said O to him, as you call it, and as your old men do to their
idol Benamnckee; that is, I prayed to him.

Wife. What you say 0 to him for?

. 'W.A Iprayed to him to open your eyes, and your understanding, that
you may know him, and be accepted by him.

Wife. But now he hear what you say?
W. A. Yes; he has bid us pray to him, and promised to hear or.

Wife. Bid you pray 2 When be bid you? How be bid you? What, you
hear him speak 2

W. A. No, we do not hear him speak; but be has revealed himseif many
ways to us.

Here he was at a great loss to make her understand that God has revealed
himsei! to us by his word. and what his word was; but at last he told it
her thus:

W. A. God has spoken to some good men in fimner days, even from
heaven, by plain words; and God has inspired good men by his Spirit; and
they have written all his laws down in a book.

Wr' e. Me no understand that; where is book t

W. A. Alas! my poor creature, l have not this book; but I hope I shall,
one time or other, get it for you, and help you to read it.

Here be embraced her with great afi'eetion; but with inexpressible grief
that be had not a Bible.

Wife. But how you matter: we know that God teachee them to write
that book 9

W. A. By the same rule that we know him to be God.

Wi e 'Vhat rule t What way you know him?

- W. A. Because he teaches and commands nothing but what is good,

. righteous, and holy, and tends to make as perfectly good, as well as perfectly
happy 3 and because he forbids, and commands on to avoid, all that is wicked,
that is evil in itself, or evil in its consequence.

Wz' e. That me would understand, that me fain see : if he teachee all good
thing, he makee all good thing, he give all thing, he hear me when 1 say 0
tobim, as you dojnst now; hemakee me goodiflwishtobe good; he spare
me, no makee kill me, when I no be good: all this you say he do, yet he be
great God: we take, think, believe him to be great God ' me say 0 to
him with you, my dear.

Here the poor man could forbear no longer, but raised her up, made her
kneel by him, and he prayed to God aloud to instruct her in the knowledge
of himself; by his Spirit; and that by some some good providence, "possible,
the might some time or other come to here a Bible, that she might read the
word of God, and be taught by it to know him-<<This was the time that we
saw him lit! her up by the hand, and saw him kneel down by her, as above.

They badsseveral other discourses, it seems, aaer this, too long to be set
down here; and particularly she made him promise that since he confessed
his own life had been a wicked abominable course of provocation against
God, that he would reform it, and not moire God angry any more; lest he
should make him deed. as she called it, and then she would be left 'aiohe, and
never be tong!!! to know this God better; and, lest he should be miserable,

Mild not speak English, to make her understand him; Musheque
but very broken English, he could not understand her; however, be turned
himself to sue, and told me that be believed that there 'must be more to do
with this woman than to marry her. I did not understand him at first, but
at length he explained himself, viz, that she ought to be baptized. I agreed
with him in that part readily, and was for going about it presently. ' No,
no; hold. sir,' said he; ' though I would have herbs baptized by all mean;
yeti must observe that Will Atkins, her husband, has indeed brought her,
in a wonderful winner, to be willing to embrace a religious life, and has
given her just idessot' the being of a God; ot' his power, justice, and mercy:
yet I desire to know of him if he has said any thing to her of Jesus Christ,
and ot' the salvation ofsinners; of the nature of faith in him, and redemption
by him; of the Holy Spirit, the resurrection, the last judgment, and e
future state. '

I called Will Atkins again, and asked him; but the poor fellow fell immes
diateiy into tears, and told us he had said something to her of all those things.
but that he was himself so wicked a oresture, and his own conscience so re-
proached him with his horrid, ungodly life. that be trembled 'at the appre.
heusions that her knowledge of him should lessen the attention she should
give to those things, and make her rather coutemn religion than receive it;
'but' he wasussured, he said, that her mind was so disposed to receive due
impressions of all those things, and that if I would but discourse with her,
she would make it appear to my satisfaction that my labour would not be
lost upon her.

Accordingly, I called her in, and placing myself as interpreter between
my religious priest and the woman, I eutreated him to begin with her; but
sure'such a sermon tves never pi'eaehed by a popisb priest in these latter ages
oftbe world; and, as I told him, I thought he had all the meal, all the know.
[edge all the sincerity of a Christian, without the error of 's Roman Catholic;
and that I took him to be such a clergyman u the Roman. bishops were.
before the church of Rome assumed spiritual sovereignty over the consciences
of men. In a word, he brought the poor woman to embrace the knowledge
of Christ, and of redemption by him, not with wonder and astonishment only,
as she did the first notions of a God, but with joy 'and'fxiith; with an afl'eco
tion. and a surprising degree of understanding, source to be imagined, much
less to be upmd; and, at her own request, she was baptized.

When he was preparing to baptize her, I entreated hiur'tbat he would
perform that omen with some caution, that the man might not perceive he
was of the Roman church, if possible, because of other iii consequences which
might attend a difl'ereuce among us in that very religion which we have in-
structmg the other in. He told me that, as be bad no consecrated chapel.
nor proper things for the oflice, 1 should seebe would do it in amuuerthat

known it before; and so he did; for, saying only some words over to him-
self in Latin, which I could not understand, he poured a whole dishful of
water upon the woman's head, pronouncing in French very loud, ' Mary,'
(which was the name her husband desired me to give her, for I was her
godfathu ,', ' l baptize thee in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and
of the Holy Ghost ;' so that none could know any thing by it what religion
he was of. He gave the benediction afterwards in Latin, but either Will At-
kins did not know but it was French, or else did not take notice of it at
that time.

As soon as this was over, we mamed them ; and, after the marriage was
over, he turned to Will Atkins, and in a very affectionate manner exhorted
lnm, not only to persevere in that good disposition he was in, but to support
the convictions that were upon him by a resolution to reform his life; told
him it was in vain to say he repented if he did not forsake his crimes: rev
presented to him how God had honoured him with being the instrument of
bringing his wife to the knowledge of the Christian religion, and that he
should be carent he did not dishonour the grace of God; and that, if he
did, he would see the heathen a better Christian than himself; the savage
converted, and the instrument cast away. He said a great many good things
to them both; and then, recommending them to God's goodness, gave them
the benediction again, I repeating every thing to them m English, and thus
ended the ceremony. I think it was the most pleasant and agreeable day
to me that ever I passed In my whole life.

But my clergyman had not done yet, his thoughts hung continually upon
the conversion of the thirty-seven savages, and fain he would have staid upon
the island to have undertaken it; but I convinced him, first, that his under-
taking was impracticable in itself; and, secondly, that perhaps I would put
it into a way of being done in his absence to his satisfaction; of which by
and by.

Having thus brought the affairs of the island to a narrow compass, I was '
preparing to go on board the ship, when the young man I had taken out of '_
the tarnished ship's company came to me, and told me he understood 1 had
a clergyman with me, and that I had caused the Englishmen to be married
to the savages; that he had a match, too, which he desired might be finished
before I went, between two Christians, which he hoped would not. be dis-
agreeable to me. -

I knew this must be the young woman who was his mother's servant, for
there was no other Christian woman on the island. so I began to persuade
him not to do any thing of that kind rashly, or because he found himself in
this solitary circumstance. I represented to him that he had some consider-
able substance in the world, and good friends. as I understood by himself; and
the maid also; that the maid was not only poor, and a servant, but was
unequal to him, she being six or sevemand-twenty years old, and he not
above seventeen or eighteen; that he might very probably, with my assis-
tance, make a remove from this wilderness, and come into his own country
again; and'that then it would be a thousand to one but he would repent his

'3.
choice, and the dislike ofthst eigtnrnstanee might be disadvantageous toboth.
l was going to say more, but he interrupted, smiling, and told me. with a
great deal of modesty, that I mistook in my guesses, that he had nothing of
that kind in his thoughts; and he was very glad to hear that I had an intent
of putting them in a way to see their own country again; and nothing should
have put him upon staying there, but that the voyage I was going was so
exceeding long and hazardous, and would carry him quite out of the reach
of all his tl'iends; that he had nothing to desire of me, but that I would
settle him in some little property in the island where he was, give him a
sensnt or two, and some few necessaries, and he would settle hinuelf here
like a planter, waitmg the good time when, if ever I returned to England, I
would redeem them; and hoped I would not be unmindful at' him when
I name to England: that he would give me some letters to his friends in
London, to let them know how good 1 had h'een to him, and in what part
of the world, and what circumstance. I had left him in; and he promised
me that whenever I redeemed him, the plantation, and all the improvements
he had made upon it, let the value be what it would, should be wholly
mine. :

His discourse was very prettily delivered, considering his youth, and was
the more agreeable to me, because he told me positively the match was not
for himself. I gave him all possible assurances that it I lived to come safe to
England, I would deliver his letters, and do his business efl'ectnally; and .
that he might depend I should never forget the cirrmmstanees I had left him '
in: but still I was impatient to know who was the person to he married; '
upon which he told me it was my Jack of all trades and his maid Susan. I '
was most agreeably surprised when he named the match; {or indeed I
thought it very suitable. The character of that man I have given already;
and as for the maid, she was a very honest, modest, sober, and religious,
young woman; had a very good share of sense, was agreeable enough in her
person, spoke very handsomely, and to the purpose, always with decency
and good manners, and neither too backward to speak, when requisite, nor
impertinently forward, when it was not her business; very handy and house-
wifely, and an excellent manager; fit, indeed, to have been governess to the
whole island, and she knew very well how to behave in every respect.

The match being propow in this manner, we married them the sameday;
and as I was father at the altar, as I may say, and gave her away, so I gave '
her a portion; for I appointed her and her husband a handsome large space
of ground {or their plantation; and, indeed, this match, and the proposal the
young gentleman made to give him a small property in the island, put me
upon panelling it out amongst them, that they might not quarrel afterwards
about their situation. . _

This sharing out of the land to them I let! to W Atkins, who was now
grown a sober. grave, managing fellow, perfectly reformed, exceedingly
pious and religious, and, as far as I may be allowed to speak positively in
such a case, I verily believe he was a true penitent. He divided things so
My, and so much to every one's satisfaction, that they only desired due

general writing under my hand for the whole, which I caused to be drawn
up, and signed and sealed to them, setting out the bounds and situation of
every man s plantation, and testifying that I gave them thereby severally a
right to the whole possession and inheritance of the respective plantations or
(areas, with their improvements, to them and their heirs, reserving all the
rest of the island as my own property, and a certain rent for every particular
plantation after eleven years; if I, or any one from me, or in my name, came
to demand it, producing an attested copy of the some writing.

As to the government and laws among them, I told them 1 was not capa~
hie of giving them better rules than they were able to give themselves; only
I made them promise me to live in love and good neighbourhood with one
another; and so I prepared to leave them,

One thing I must. not omit. and that is, that being now settled in it kind
of commonwealth among themselves, and having much business in hand, it
was but odd to have sevemaud~thirty Indians live in a nook of the island.
independent, and, indeed, unemployed; for, excepting the providing them-
selves food, which they had difficulty enough to do, sometimes they had no
manner of business or property to manage. I proposed, therefore, to the
governor Spaniard, that he should go to them, with Friday's father, and pro-
pose to them to remove, and either plant for themselves, or take them into
their several families as servants, to be maintained {or their labour, but
without being absolute slaves; for I would not admit them to make them
slaves by force, by any means; because they had their liberty given them
by rapitulzztion, as it were articles of surrender, which they ought not to
break.

They most willingly embraced the proposal, and came all very cheerful
along with him: so we allotted them land, and plantations, which three or
{our accepted of, but all the rest chose to be employed as servants in the
several families we had settled ; and thus my colony was in a manner settled,
as follows :--The Spaniards posaessed my original habitation, which was the
capital city, and extended their plantations all along the side of the brook,
which made the creek that l have so often described, as thr as my bower;
and as they increased their culture, it went always eastward. The English
lived in the north-east part, where Will Atkins and his comrades began, and
came on southward and southwest, towards the back part of the Spaniards;
and every plantation had a great addition of land to take in, if they found
occasion, so that they need not jostlc. one another for want of room All
the east end of the island was left uninhabited, that if any of the savage:
should come on shore there only for their usual customary barbaritiee, they
might come and go; if they disturbed nobody, nobody would disturb them:
and no doubt but they were often ashore, and went away again, for I never
heard that the planters were ever attacked or disturbed any more.

It now come into my thoughts that I had hinted to my friend the clergy-
man that the work of converting the sarages might perhaps be set on foot in
his absence to his salisfixction, and told turn that now I thought it was put in
a fair way; for the savages being thus divided among the Christmas, if they
would but every one of them do their part with those which come under
their hands, I hoped it might have a very good ed'ect.

He agreed presently in that, if they did their part, ' But how.' says he,
' shall we obtain that of themt' I told him we wouldeall them all together,
and leave it in charge with them, or go to them, one by one, which he
thought best; so we divided it, he to speak to the Spaniards, who were all
Pupil": and I to the English, who were all protestant; and we recommended
it earnestly to them, and made them promise that they would never make
any distinction of pspist or protestant in their exhorting the savages to turn
Christians, but teach them the general knowledge of the true God, and of
their Saviour Jesus Christ; and they likewise promised us that they would
never have any difi'erences or disputes one with another about religion.

When I came to Will Atkins's house (I may call it so, for such a house, or
such a piece of basket~work, I believe, was not standing in the world again),
there I found the young woman I have mentioned above, and Will Atkins's
wife, were become intimates; and this prudent, religions young woman, had
perfected the work Will Atkins had begun; and though it was not above
four days after what I have related, yet the new<<haptized savage woman
was made such a Christian as l have seldom heard of in all my observation
or conversation in the world.

It came next into my mind, in the morning before I went to them, that
amongst all the needfnl things I had to lesve with them, I had not left them
aBihle, in which I showed myself lea considering for them than my good
friend the widow was for me, when she sent me the cargo of a hundred
pounds from Urban, where she packed up three Bibles and a Prayer-hook.
However, the good woman's charity had a greater extent than ever she
imagined, for they were reserved for the comfort and instruction of those
that made much better use of them than I had done.

I took one of the Bibles in my pocket, and when I came to "'5" Atkius's
tent, or house, and found the young woman and Atkins's baptized wife had
been discoursing of religion together, for \Vill Atkins told it me with a great
deal of joy, I asked if they were together now, and he said yes; so i went
into the home, and he with me, and we found them together very earnest in
discourse. ' O, sir,' says Will Atkins, ' when God has sinners to reconcile
to himself, and aliens to bring home, he never wants a messenger; my wife
has got a new instructor; I knew I was as unworthy as I was incapable of
that work; that young woman has been sent hither from heaven; she is
enough to convert a whole island of savages.' The young woman blushed,
and rose up to go away, but I desired her to sit still; I told her she had a
good work upon her hands, and I hoped God would bless her in it.

We talkeda little, and l did not perceive they had any book among them,
though I did not ask: but I put my hand into my pocket, and pulled out my
Bible; ' Here; says I to Atkins, '1 have brought you an amistant that per-
haps you had not before.' The man was so confimnded that he was not able
to speak for some time; but recovering himself, he takes it with both his
hands, and turning to his wife, ' Here, my dear,' says he, 'did not I tell youI 7

our God. though he lives above, could hear what we said I Here's the book
I prayed for when you and l hueeled down under the bush; new God has
heard us, and sent it. When he had said so, the mun fell into such transport-
of passionate joy, that between the joy of having it, and giving God thanks
for it, the tears ran down his face like a child that was crying?

The woman was surprised, and was like to have run into a mistake that
none of us were aware of, for she firmly believed God had sent the book
upon her husband's petition. It is true, that proridentially it was so, and 2
might be taken so in a consequent sense; but I believe it would have been a
no diflicult matter, at that time, to hove persuaded the poor woman to bare '
believed that an express messenger came from heaven on purpose to bring '
that individual book; but lt was too serious a matter to seller any delusion
to take place; so I turned to the young woman, and told her we did not
desire to impose upon the new convert, in her first and more ignorant
understanding of things, and begged her toexplain to her that God may be
very properly said to answer our petitions. when, in the course of his provi- .
deuce, such things are in a particular manner brought to pm as we peti-- _
tinned for; but we did not expect returns from Heaven in a miraculous and "
particular manner, and it is our mercy that it is not so.

This the young woman did afterwards effectually, so that there was!
more you, no priesteraft used here; and I should have thought it one of the
most unjustifiable frauds in the world to have had it so. But the surprise of
joy upon Will Atkins is really not to be expressed; and there, we may he
sure, was no delusion. Sure no man was ever more thankful in the world
for any thing of its kind than he was for the Bible; nor, I believe, never
any man was glad of a Bible from a better principle; and though he had
been a moot profligate creature, headstrong, furious, and desperately wicked,
yet this man is s standing rule to us all for the well instructing children,
viz, that parents should never give over to teach and instruct, nor ever
despair of the success of their endeavours, let the children he ever so refrac-
tory, or, to appearance, insensihle of instruction; for, if ever God, in his
providence, touches the conscience of such, the force of their education
returns upon them, and the early instruction of parents is not lost, though it
may have been many years laid asleep, but, some time or other, they may
find the benefit of it. Thus it was with this poor man; however ignorant
he was of religion and Christian knowledge, he found he had some to do
with now more ignorant than himself, and that the leastpart of the instruc-
tion of his good father that now came to his mindwss of use to him.

Among the rest it occurred to him, he said, how his father used to insist
so much on the inexpreseible value of the Bible, the privilege and blessing
of it to nations, families, and pawns; but he never entertained the least
notion of the worth of It till now, when being to talk to heathens, savages,
and barbarians, he wanted the help of the written oracle for his assistance.

The young woman was glad of it also for the present occasion, though
she had one, and so had the youth, on board our ship, among their goods,
which were not yet brought on share. And now having said so many things

'1
of this young woman. I cannot omit telling one story more of her and myself,

-' which has something in it very intbmiing and remarkable

I have related to what extremity the poor young woman was reduced,
how her mistress was starved to death, and died on board that unhappy ship
we met at sea, and how the whole ship's company was reduced to the last
extremity. The gentlewoman and her son, and this maid, were first hardly
used, as to provisions, and at last totally neglected and starved; that is to

' say, brought to the last extremity of hunger.--One day, being discoursmg

with her on the extremities they sufl'ered, I asked her if she could describe,
by what she had felt, what it was to starve, and how it appeared ? She told
me she believed she could, and she told her tale very distinctly, thus :

' First, sir," said she, ' we had for some days fared exceeding hard, and
sufi'ered very great hunger: but at last we were wholly without food of any
kind, except sugar, and a little wine and water. The first day, after I had
received no food at all, I found myself, towards evening, first empty and sick

. at the stomach, and nearer night much inclined to yawning and sleep. I

laid down on a couch in the great cabin to sleep, and slept about three hours,
and awaited a little refreshed, having taken a glass of wine when l lay down:
after being about three hours awake, it being about five o'clock in the
morning, 1 found myself empty, and my stomach sickish, and lay down again,
but could not sleep at all, being very faint and ill; and thus I continued all
the second day, with a strange variety, first hungry, then sick again, with
retehings to vomit. The second night, being obliged to go to bed again
without any food, more than a draught of fresh water, and being asleep, I
dreamed I was at Barbadoes, and that the market was mightily stocked with
provisions; that I bought some for my mistress, and went and dined very
heartily. I thought my stomach was as full after this as it would have been
after a good dinner; but when I awaked, I was exceedingly sunk in my
spirits to find myself in the extremity of famine. The last glass of wine we
had I drank, and put sugar in it, because of its having some spirit to supply
nourishment; but there being no substance in the stomach for the digesting
oflice to work upon, I found the only efl'ect of the wine was, to raise dis-
agreeable fumes from the stomach into the head; and I lay, as they told me,
stupid and senseless, as one drunk, for some time. The third day, in the
morning, after a night of strange, confused, and inconsistent dreams, and
rather dozing than sleeping, I awaked ravenous and furious with hunger;
and I question, had not my understanding returned and conquered it, whe-.
ther, if! had been a mother, and had had a little child with me, its life would
have been safe or not. This lasted about three hours; during which time
was twice raging mad as any creature in bedlam, as my young master td "
me, and as he can now inform you.

In one of these fits of lunacy or distraction I fell down, and struck my '
face against the corner of a pallet bed, in which my mistress lay. and, with '
the blow, the blood gushed out of my nose; and the cabin-boy bringing me
a little basin, I sat down and bled into it a great deal; and as the blood
came from me, I came to myself, and the violence nfthe flame or fever 1 was

in sbsted. sad so did the ravenous part of the hunger. Then I grew sick,
nnd retehed to vomit, but could not, for I had nothing in my stomach to

bring up. Alter I had bled some time, I swooned, sud they all believed I
was dead; but I come to myself soon siter, and then had s most dresdtizl
pain in my stomach, not to be described, not like the cholic, but a gnawing,
eager pain for food; and towards the night it went 06', with s kind of earnest
wishing or longing for food, something like, as I suppose, the longing of s
woman with child. I took another draught of water with sugar in it; but
my stomach loathed the sugar, and brought it all up again; then I took a
draught of water without sugar. and that staid with me; and I laid medown
upon the bed, praying most heartily that it would please God totake me
nwny; and composing my mind in hopes ofit, l slumbered awhile, and then
waking, thonght myself dying, being light with vapours fi-om an empty'
stomach; I recommended my soul then to God. and earnestlrwished that
somebody would throw me into the see.

"All this while my mistress lay by me, just, as I thought, expiring, bot
bore it with mac! more patience than I; gave the last bit of breed she had

let! to her child, my young master. who would not have taken it, butshe
obliged him to eat it; and I believe it saved his life.

' Towards the morning I slept again; and when I awoke, I fell into a
violent passion oi crying, and after that had it second tit of violent hunger:
I got up ravenous. and in s most dreadlbl condition: had my mistress been
dead, as much as i loved her. I am certain I should have eaten a piece of
her flesh with as much relish, and as unconcerned, as ever I did est the flesh
of any crestme appointed for food; and once or twice I was going to bite
my own sun: at last I saw the basin in which was theblood I had bled at
my nose the day before; I ran to it, and swallowed it with such hate, and
such a greedy appetite, as if I wondered nobody had taken it before, and
afraid it should be taken from me now. Alter it was down, though the
thoughts of it filled me with horror, yet it checked the lit of hunger, and I'
took another draught of water, and was composed and refreshed for some hours 2
after. This was the fourth day; and thus I held it till towards night; when, '
within the compass of three hours, I had all the several circumstances over -
again, one after another, viz, sick. sleepy, eagerly hungry, pain in the i
stomach, then ravenous again; then sick, then. lunatic, then crying, then 7
ravenous again, and so every quarter of an hour; and my strength wasted '
exceedingly: at night I laid me down, having no comfort but in the hope "
that 1 should die before morning.

'Allthis night I had no sleep; hnttbehnnger was nowtnned into n
disarm; andlhadaterrihle cholic sod grip'mg, by Mismadfood,'
hnving found its way into the bowels; and in this condition I lay till -
morning, when I was surprised with the cries and lsmentntions of my young
master, who called out to me that his mother-"was dead; I'lilted'myself up": '
little, for I had not strength to me, but found she was not dead, though she

was nbleto give very little signs of life.
' I had then such convulsions in my stomach. for want ofsonre mate-nines. '
thatI cannot describe; with such frequent throes and pangs of appetite,
that nothing but the tortures of death can imitate; and in this condition I
was, when I heard the seamen above cry out, A sail! a sail! and halloo and
jump about as if they were distracted.

' l was not able to get ofi' from the bed, and my mistress much less; and
my young master was so sick, that I thought he had been expiring; so we
could not open the cabin-door, or get any account what it was that ocea-
sioned such confusion; nor had we any conversation with the ship's com-
pany for two days, they having told us that they had not a mouthful of any
thing to eat in the ship; and this they told us afierwarda, they thought we
had been dead. It was this dreadful condition we were in when you were
aehtnfo save our lives; and how you found us, sir, you know as well as I, and
better too:

This wayher own relation, and is such a distinct account of starving to
death, as, I confess, [never met with, and was exceeding entertaining to me.
I am the rather apt to believe it to be a true account, because the youth gave
me an account'of a good part of it; though, I must own, not sodistinct and
so feeling as the maid; and the rather, because it seems his mother fed him
at the price 'of her own life; but the poor maid, though her constitution
being stronger than that of her mistress, who was in years, and a weakly
woman too, she might struggle harder with it: I say, the poor maid might
be supposed to feel the extremity something sooner than her mistress, who
might be allowed to keep the last hit something longer than she parted with
any to relieve the maid. No question, as the case is here related, if our ship,
or some other, had not so providentially met them. a few days more would
have ended all their lives, unless they had prevented it by eating one another;
and that even, as their case stood, would have served them but a little while,
they being five hundred leagues from any land, or any possibility of relic;
other than in the miraculous manner it happened : but this is by the way;
I return to my disposition of things among the people.

And, first, it is to be observed here, that for many reasons I did not think
fit to let them know any thing of the sloop I had framed, and which I thought
of setting up among them; for I found, at least, at my first coming, such
seeds of divisions among them, that I saw plainly, had I set up the sloop, and-
let't it among them, they would, upon every light disgust, have separated,
and gonet'away'from one another, or perhaps have turned pirates, and so
made the island a den of thieves, instead of a plantation of sober and reli. .
gious people. as I intended it : nor did I leave the two pieces of bra. cannon
that I had on board, or the two quarter-deck guns that my nephew took.
extraordinary, for the same reason: I thought it was enough to qualify them
for adefensive waragainst any that should invade them, but not to set them up;
for an ofl'ensive war, or to go abroad to attack others; which, in the end,
would only bring ruin and destruction upon them: I reserved the sloop,
therefore, and the guns, for their service another way, as I shall observe In
is place.

null m a flourishing condition, and went on board my ship again the 6th or
May, having been about twenty--five days among them; and as they were
all resolved to stay upon the island till i came to remove them, I promised
to send them further relief from the Brazila, if I could possibly find an
opportunity: and, particularly, I promised to send them some cattle, such as
cheep, hogs, and cotvs; as to the two rows and calves which I brought from
England, we had been obliged. by the length of our voyage, to kill them at
to", for want of hay to feed them.

The next day, giving them a salute of five guns at parting, we set sail,
and arrived at the bay ofAll Saints, in the Brazils, in about twentydwo days,
meeting nothing remarkable in our passage but this: that about three days
after we had sailed, being becalmed, and the current setting strong to the
E. V. 13., running, as it were, into a boy or gulf on the land side, we were
driven something out of our course, and once or twice our men cried out,
Land to the eastward; but whether it was the continent or islands we could
not tell by any means. But the third day, towards evening, the sea smooth,
end the weather calm, we saw the sea, as it were, covered towards the land
with something very black; not being able to discover what it was, till after
some time, our chiel' mate going up the main-shrouds a little way, and looking
at them with a perspective, cried out it was an army. 1 could not imagine
what he meant by an army. and thwarted him a little hastily. ' Nay, nir,'
says he, ' don't be angry, for 'tis an army, and a fleet too; for I believe there
are a thousand canoes, and you may see them paddle along, for they are
coming towards us apnre.

I was a little surprised the>>. indeed, and so was my nephew the captain;
for he had heard such terrible stories of them in the island, and having never
been in those seas before, that he could not tell what to think of it, but: said,
two or three times, we should all be devoured. I must confess, considering
we were becalmed, and the current set strong towards the shore, I liked it
the worse; however, i bade them not be afraid, but bring the ship to an
anchor as soon as we came so near as to know that we must engage them.

The weather continued calm, and they came on space towards us; so I
gave order to come to an anchor, and furl all our sails: as for the savage, I
told them they had nothingjo fear but fire, and therefore they should get
their boots out, and fasten them, one close by the head, and the other by the
stem, and man them both well, and wait the issue in that posture: this I
(lid, that the men in the boats might be ready with sheets and buckets to
put out any fire these savages would endeavour to fix to the outside of the
ship.

In this posture we lay by for them, and In a little while they come up with
m; but never was such a horrid sight seen by Christians: though my mate
was much mistaken in his calculation of their number, yet when-they came
up we reckoned about a hundred and twenty-six; some of them had sixteen
or seventeen men in them, and some more, and the least six or seven.

When they came nearer to us, they seemed to be struck with wonder and

Moniebmeut, as at a sio'ht which doubtless thev had never seen before not
W0r nonmson onosos. - 493
onld they, at first, as we afterwards understood, know what to make of n's;
they came boldly up, however, very near to us, and seemed to go about to
row round as; but we eolled to our men in the boats not to let them come
too near tliem.' This very order brought us to an engagement with them,
without our designing it; for five or six of the large canoes came so near
our long-boat that our men beckoned with their hands to keep them back.
whiub they understood very well, and went back, but, at their retreat, about
. fifty arrows came on board as from those boats, and one of our men in the
long-boat was very much wounded. However, I called to them not to fire
-1>y any means; but we handed down some deal-boards into the boat. and -
. the carpenter presently set no a kind of fence, like waste boards, to cover
them from the arrows of the savages, if they should shoot again. -
._ About half an hour aflerwards they all came up in a body astern of as,
sad so near, as that we could easily discern what they were, though we could
not tell their design; and l easily found they were some of my old friends,
the same sort of savages that I had been used to engage with; and, in a short
time more, they rowed a little farther out to sea, till they came directly broad--
side with us, and then rowed down straight upon on, till they came so near
ithat they could hear no speak: upon this I ordered all my men to keep
close, lest they should shoot any more arrows, and made all our guns ready;
but, being so near as to be within hearing, I made Friday go out upon the
deck, and call out aloud to them in his language, to know what they meant;
which accordingly he did. Whether they understood him or not, that I knew
not; bot, as soon as he had called to them, six of them, who were in the
foremost or nighest boot to us, turned their canoes from us, and, stooping
down, showed us their naked backside; just as if, in English, saving your
presence, they had bid us kiss --: whether this was a defiance or chal-
lenge we knew not, or whether it was done in mere contempt, or as s signal
to the rest; but immediately Friday cried out they were going to shoot, and,
'nnhappily for him, poor fellow, they let fly about three hundred of their
arrows, and, to my inexpressihle grief, killed poor Friday, no other men
being in their eight. The poor fellow was shot with no less than three at.
rows, and about three more fell very near him; such unlucky marksmen
they were! 5
. [was so enraged at the loss of my old trusty servant and companion, that
I immediately ordered live guns to be loaded with small-shot, and four with
great, and gave them such a broadside as they had never heard in their lives
before, to be sore. They were not above half a cable length off when we
tired; and our gunners took their aim so well that three or {our of their
canoes were overeat, as we had reason to believe, by one shot only.
, The ill manners of tuning up their bare backside; to us gave no no great
.ofi'ence; neither did I know for certain whether that which would pass for
the greatest contempt among us might be understood so by them or not;
therdbre, in return, I had only resolved to have fired four or five guns at
them with powder only, which 1 knew would frighten them mfieiently; but
when they shot at us directly with all the fury they were capable on and
especially as they had killed my poor Friday, whom I so entirely loved and
valued, and who, indeed. so well deserved it, I thought myself not only jus-
tifiable before God and man, but would have been very glad if I could have
overset every canoe there, and drowned every one of them.

I can neither tell how many we killed, nor how many we wounded, at
this broadside, but sure such a fright and hurry never was seen among such
a multitude; there were thirteen or fourteen of their canoes split and overset
in all, and the men all set a swimming: the rest, frightened out of their wits,
scoured away as fast as they could; taking but little care to save those whose
boats were split or spoiled with our shot; so I suppose that many of them
were lost; and our men took up one poor fellow swimming for his life, above
an hour after they were all gone.

The small-shot from our cannon must needs kill and wound a great many;
but, in short. we never knew any thing how it went with them, for they
fled so fast, that in three hours, or thereabouts, we could not see above three
or four straggling canoes, nor did we ever see the rest any more; for is
areeze of wind springing up the same evening, we weighed, and set sail for
the Brazils. ' ' :

We had a prisoner, indeed, but the creature was so sullen that he'woul'l
neither eat nor speak, and we all fancied he would starve himself to death:
but I took a way to cure him; for l m'ade them take him and turn him into
the long-boat, and made him believe they would toss him into the sea again;
and so leave him where they found him, if he would not speak : nor would
that do, but they really did throw him into the sea, and came away (tom
him; and then he followed them, for he swam like a cork, and called to
them, in his tongue, though they knew not one would what he said: how-
ever, at last they took him in again, and then he began to be more tractable;

nor did I ever design they should drown him.
We were now under sail again; but 1 was the most disconsolate creature

alive for want of my man Friday, and would have been very glad to have
gone back to the island to have taken one of the rest from thence for my oc-
casion; but it could not be; so we went on. We had one prisoner, as I
have said, and it was a long time before we could make him understand any
thing; but, in time, our men taught him some English, and he beganto he
a little tractable. Afterwards, we inquired what country he came from,
but could make nothing of what he said; for his speech was so odd, all
gutturals, and he spoke in the throat in such a hollow, odd manner, that we
could never form a word atter him; and we were all of opinion that they
might speak that language as well if they were gagged as otherwise; nor
could we, perceive that they had any occasion either for teeth, tongue, lips,
or palate, but formed their words just as a hunting-horn forms a tune, with
an open throat. He told us, however, some time atter, wheii we had taught
him to speak a little English, that they were gorng with their kings to fight
a great battle. When he said kings, we asked him how many kings? Hd
said they were five nation, (we could not make him understand the plural s);
and that they all joined to go against two nation. We asked him who!
made them come up to us? He said, ' To makee te great wonder look.' Here
it is to be observed, that all those natives, as also thwe of Africa, when they
learn English, always add two e's atthc end of the words where we use one;
and they place the accent upon them, as makec, takce, and the like; and we
could not break them of it; nay, I could hardly make Friday leave it otl',
though at last he did. .

And now I name the poor fellow once more, I must take my last leave of
him: Poor honest Friday! We buried him with all the decency and solem-
nity pomible, by putting him into a cofiin, and throwing him into the sea;
and I caused them to fire eleven guns for him : and so ended the life ofthe
most grateful, faithful, honest, and most afi'ectionate servant, that eves
man had.

We went now away with a fair wind for Brazil, and in about twelve days'
timewe made land, in the latitude of five degrees south of the line, being
the uorth-eastermost land of all that part of America. We kept on S. by E.
in sight of the shore four days, when we made Cape St. Augustine, and in
three days came to an anchor off the bay of All Saints, the old place of my
deliverance, from whence came both my good and evil thte.

Never ship came to this port that had less business than I had, and yet it
was with great dificulty that we were admitted to hold the least correspon-
dence on shore: not my partner himself, who was alive, and made a great
figure among them, not my two merchanhtrustees, not the fame of my won-
derful preservation in the island, could obtain me that favour; but my
partner, remembering that I had given five hundred moidores to the prior
of the monastery of the Augustines, and two hundred and seventy-two to the
poor, went to the monastery, and obliged the prior that then, was, to .go to
the governor, and get leave for me personally, with the captain and one
more, besides eight seamen, to come on shore, and no more 3. and this upon
condition absolutely capitulated for, that we should not offer to land any
goods out of the ship, or to carry any person away without licence. They
were so strict with us as to landing any goods, that it was with extreme
dificulty that I got on shore three bales of English goods, such as fine
broad-cloths, stufi's, and some linen, which I had brought for a present to
my partner. _

He was a very generous, open-hearted nan; though, like me, he came
from little at first: and though he knew not that 1 had the least design of
giving him any thing, he sent me on board a present of fresh provisiony
wing and sweetmeats, worth above thirty maidores, including some tobacco,
and three or {our fine medals of gold: but I was even with him in my pre-
sent, which, as I' have said, consisted of fine broad-cloth, Engl'nh stuffs, lace,
and fine hollands; also I delivered him about the value of one hundred.
pounds sterling, In the same goods, for other uses; and l obliged him to set
up the sloop, which I had brought with me from England, as I have said, for
theme of my colony, in order to send the refreshments I intended to my,

plantation. '
' Accordingly, he got hands, and finished the sloop in a veryfew days, for
she was already framed; and I gave the master of her such tnstructionsa
that he could not miss the place; nor did he miss them, as I had an account
from my partner afterwards. I got him soon loaded with the small cargo I
sent them; and one of our seamen, that had been on shore with me there,
ofl'erai to go with the sloop and settle there, upon my letter to the governor
Spaniard to allot him a sufiicieut quantity of land for a plantation, and giwng
him some clothes and tools for his planting-work, which he said he under-
stood, having been an old planter at Maryland, and a buccaneer into the
bargain. l encouraged the fellow, by granting all he desired; and, as in
condition, I gave him the savage whom we had taken prisoner of war to be
his slave, and ordered the governor Spaniard to give him his share of every
thing he wanted with the rest.

When we came to fit this man out, my old partner told me there was a
certain very honest fellow, a Brazil planter of his acquaintance, who had
thllen into the displeasure of the church. ' 1 know not what the matter is
with him,' says he, ' but on my conscience I think he is a heretic in his
heart, and he has been obliged to conceal himself for fear of the inquisition;
that he would be very glad of such an opportunity to make his escape, with
his wife and two daughters; and, if I would let them go to my island, and
allot them a plantation, he would give them a small stock'to begin with; for
the officers of the Inquisition had seized all his etfects and estate, and he had
nothing lelt but a little household stufl', and two slaves: and,' adds he,
' though I hate his principles, yet I would not have him fall into their hands,
for he will be assuredly burned alive if he does.'

I granted this presently, and joined my Englishman with them; and we
concealed the man, and his wife and daughters, on board our ship, till the
sloop put out to go to sea; and then, having put all their goods on board
some time before, we put them on board the sloop after she was got out o
the bay.

Our seaman was mightily pleased with this new partner; and their stocks,
indeed, were much alike rich in tools, in preparations, and a farm; but
nothing to begin with except as above: however, they carried over with them,
which was worth all the rest, some materials for planting sugar-canes, with
some plants of canes, which he, I mean the Portugal man, understood very well,

Among the rest of the supplies sent to my tenants in the island, I sent them
by the sloop three milch cows and five calves, about twenty-two hogs among
them, three sows big with pig, two mares, and a stone-horse. For my
Spaniards, according to my promise, I engaged three Portugal women to go,
and recommended it to them to marry them, and use them kindly. I could
have procured more women, but I remembered that the poor persecuted
man had two daughters, and that there were but five of the Spaniards that
wanted; the rest had wives of their own, though in another country.

All this cargo arrived safe, and, as you may easily suppose, was very
welcome to my old inhabitants, who were now, with this addition, be-
tween sixty and seventy people, besides little children, of which there were'
a great many. I found letters at London from them'all, by was of Lisbon
when I came back to England, of which I shall also take some notice
immediately.

I have now done with the island, and all manner of discourse about it :
and whoever reads the rest of my memorandum would do well to turn his
thoughts entirely from it, and expect to read of the follies of an old man, not
warned by his own harms, much less by those of other men, to beware 0!
the like; not cooled by almost forty years' miseries and disappointments;
not satisfied with prosperity beyond expectation, nor made cautious Ly
amictions and'distress beyond imitation.

I had no more business to go to the East Indies than a man at full libertf
has to go to the turnkey at Newgate, and desire him to lock him up among
the prisoners there, and starve him. I-Iad l taken a small vessel from Eng-
land, and gone directly to the island; had I loaded her, as I did the other
vessel, with all the necessaries for the plantation, and for my people; taken
a patent from the government here to have secured my property, in subjeC-
tion only to that of England: had I carried over cannon and ammunition,
servants, and people to plant, and taken possession of the place, fortified
and strengthened it in the name of England, and increased it with people,
as I might easily have done; had I then settled myself there, and sent the
ship back laden with goodrice, asI might also have done in six months' time,
and ordered my friends to have fitted her out again for our supply; had I
done this, and said there myself, I had at least acted like a man of common
sense : but I was possessed with a wandering spirit, and scorned all advan--
tages: I pleased myself with being the patron of the people I placed there,
- and doing for them in a kind of haughty, majestic way, like an old patri-
archal monarch, providing for them as it'l had been father of the whole
family, as well as of the plantation : butI never so much as pretended to
plant in the name of any government or nation, or to acknowledge any
prince, or to call my people subjects to any one nation' more than another :-
nay, I never somnch as gave the place a name, but let! it, as I found it, bar
longing' to nobody, and the people under no discipline or government'ibsw
my own; who, though I had influence over them as afather and benefactor,-
had no authority or power to act or command one way or other, farther than.
voluntary consent moved them to comply: yet even this, had I staid there
would have done well enough; but: as I rambled from them, and came there-
no more, the last letters I had from any of them were by my partner's means.-
wh'd-at'terwa'rds sent another sloop to the place, and who sent me word
though I had not the letter till I got to London, several years after it was-'
written, that they went on but poorly, were malcontent with their long
staythere; that Will Atkins was dead ; that five of the Spaniards were come
away ; and though they had not been much molested hv the savages, yet
they had some skirmishes with them, and .that they begged of him to writnl
tone to "thhakotthe prOI'nise I had madstofetchthem away, that they.
might see' their country again before they died ' -_

But I was gone a wildgoose chue, indeed! and they that will have any

ships, and wild adventures, wherein the justice of Providence may be duly
observed ; and we may see how easily Heaven can gorge us with our own
desires, make the strongest of our wishes be our affliction, and punish as
most severely with those very things which we think it would be our utmost
happiness to be allowed in. Whether I had'busineu or no business, away
I went; it is no time now to enlarge upon the reason or absurdity of my own
conduct, but to come to the history; I was embarked for the voyage, and
the voyage I went.

I shall only add a word or two concernmg my honest popish clergyman;
for let their opinion of us, and all other heretics in general, as they call us.
be as uncharitable as it may, I verily believe this man was very sincere, and
wished the good of all men: yet I believe he was upon the reserve in many
ofhis expressions, to prevent giving me ofi'enoe; for l scarce heard him once
call on the blessed Virgin, or mention St. Jago or his guardian angel, though
so common with the rest of them: however, I say, I had not the least doubt
of his sincerity and pious intention: on his own part; and I am firmly of
opinion, if the rest of the popiah misionaries were like him. they would
strive to visit even the poor Tartan and Laplanders, where they have no---
thing to give them. as well as covet to flock to India, Persia. China, are.
the most wealthy of the heathen countries; for if they expected to bring no
gains to their church by it, it may well be admired how they came to admit
the Chinese Confucius into the calendar of the Christian saints. But this by
the by.

A ship being ready to sail for Lisbon. my pious priest asked me leave to
go thither; being still, as he observed, bound never to finish any voyage he
began. How happy had it been for me if I had gone with him! But it was
too late now : all things Heaven appoints for the best i had! gone with him,
I had never had so many things to be thankful for, and the reader had never
heard of the second part of the travels and adventures of Robinson Crmoe;
sol must here leave exclaiming at myself, and go on with my voyage. From
the'Bmds we made directly over the Atlantic Sea to the Cape of Good
Hope, and had a tolerable good voyage, our course generally south-east,
now and then aster-2n, and some contrary winds, but my disasters at see
were at an end; my future rubs and cross events were to befall me on shore,
that it might appear the land was as well prepared to be our scourge in
theses. '

Oar ship was on a trading voyage, and had a sopereargo on board; who
was to direct all her motions after she arrived at the Cape, only being limited
to a certain number of days for stay, by charter~party, at the several ports
sh'o was to go to. This was none of my business. neither did I meddle with
it: my nephew, the tannin, and the sopereargo, adjusting all those thing:
between them as they thought fit. '

We staid atthe Cape no longer than was needful to take in their watery
but made the best of our way for the coast of Commandel. 'We were ina:
deed informed that a French man of war of titty guns. and two large mero
chant-shim were gone for the Indies; and a I knew we were at war with:
France, I had some apprehensions of them; but they went their own way,
and we heard no more of them.

I shall not pester the reader with a tedious description of places, journals
of. our voyages, variations of the compass, latitudes, trade-winds, &c.; it is
enough to name the ports and places which we touched at, and what occurred
to us upon our passing from one to another. We touched first at the island
of Madagascar, where, though the people are fierce and treacherous, and
very well armed with lances and bows, which they use with inconceivable
dexterity, yet we fared very well with them awhile; they treated us very
civilly: and, for some trifles which we gave them, such as knives, scissors,
&c., they brought us eleven good fat bullocks of a middling size, which we
took in, partly for fresh provisions for our present spending, and the rest to
salt for the ship's use.

We were obliged to stay here some time after we had furnished ourselves
with provisions; and I, who was always too curious to look into every
nook of the world wherever I came, was for going on shore as often as 1
could. It was on the east side of the island that we went on shore one
evening: and the people, who, by the way, are veryZnumerous, came throng-
ing about us, and stood gazing at us at a distance; but as we had traded
freely with them, and had been kindly used, we thought ourselves in no
danger; but when we saw the people, we cut three boughs out of a tree,
and stuck them up at a distance from us; which, it seems, is a mark in that
country, not only of a truce and friendship, but when it is accepted, the
other side sets up three poles or boughs, which is a signal that they accept
the truce too; but then this is a known condition of the truce, that you are
not to pass beyond their three poles, towards them, nor they to come past
your three poles, or bonghs, towards yon; so that you are perfectly secure
within the three poles, and all the space between your poles and theirs is
allowed like a market for free converse, traflic, and commerce. When you
go there, you must notcarry your weapons with you: and if they come into
that space, they stick up their javelins and lances all at the first poles, and

. come on unarmed; but if any violence is ofi'ered them, and the truce these-
by broken, away they. run to the poles, and lay hold of their weapons, and
the trace is at an end.

It happened one evening when we went on shore, that a greater number
or their people came dOWn than usual, but all very friendly and civil; and'
they brought several-kinds of provisions, for which we satisfied them with
such toysas we had; their women also brought us milk and roots, and'
several things very acceptable to us, and all was quiet, and we made us a
little tent or but of some boughs of trees, and lay on shore all night.

I know not- what was the occasion, but I was not so well satisfied to liel

. on shore as the rest , and the boat riding at an anchor about'a stone's cast'

About two ociock in the morning we heard one dour men Indie a tee.
'ihle noise on the shore, calling out, for God's sake, to bring the boat in,
and come and help them, for they were a}! like to be murdered: at the
rune time I heard the fire of five muskets, which was the number of the
guns they had, and that three times over; for, it meme, the natives here
were not so easily frightened with guns as the savage: were in America>>
where I had to do with them. All this while I knew not what was the
matter, but rousing immediately from sleep with the mine, I moved the
boat to be thrust in, and moived, with three] force: we had on board, to
land and assist our men.

\Ve got the boat soon to the shore, but our men were in too much hate ;
[or being come to the shore, they plunged into the water, to get to the boat
with at! the expedition they could, being pursued by between three and flour
hundred men. Our men were but nine in ell, and only five of them had
fusees with them; the rest nod pistol: and swords, indeed, but they wene of
small one to them.

We took up seven of our men, and with difficulty enough too, three of
them being very ill wounded; and that which was stiii worse was, that
while we stood in the boat to take our men in, we were in as much danger
as they were in on shore; {or they poured their arrow: in upon us so thick.
that we were glad to barricade the side of the boat up with the benches. and
two or three loose boards, which. to our great satisfaction, we had by mere
meident in the boat. And yet, had it been day-light, they are, it secure,
inch exact marksmen, that if they could have seen but the least pm of any
of us. they would have been sure of us. We had, by the light of the moon.
3 Kittie eight of them, as they stood petting n: from the shore with darts and
arrows; and having got ready our tire-nuns, we gave them a volley, that
we eonid hear, by the cries of some of them, had wounded semi; however,
they stood thus in battle-array on theshore till break ofday. which we eup-
pose we: thnt they might see the better to take their aim at no.

In this condition we lay, and could not tell how to weigh our anchor. or
net up our sail, because we must needs stand up in the boat, and they were

signals of distress to the ship, which. though she rode a lemma ofi', yet my

and, weighing anchor with all speed. he stood as near the more an be dun-st

us: but we <<Bed to them not tocome too near, telling them whatoondition

oroadside among them, - loaded with pieces of iron and Md. small bullets.
and such stuff, besides the great shot, which made a terrible havoc among
them. -

When we were got on board, and out ot'danger, we had time to examine
into the occasion of this tray; and, indeed, our wpereorgo, who had been
often in those parts, not me upon it; for he said he was sure the inhabitant!
would not have touched us alter we had made a trace, it we bad'not done
something to provoke them to it. At length it came out that an old woman,
who had come to soil as some milk. had brought it within our poles, and 'a
'yonng woman with her, who also brought some roots or herbs; and, while
the old woman (whether she was mother to the young woman, or no, they
could not tell) was selling us the milk, one of our men ofl'ered some mdeues
to the trench that was with her, at which the old woman made a great noise:
however, the seamen would not quit his prize, but carfied her out of the old
woman's sight among the trees, it being almost dark : the old woman went
away without her, and, as we may suppose, made an outcry among the people
she came from; who, upon notice, raised this great army upon us in three
or four hours; and it was great odds but we had all been destroyed.

One of our men was killed with a lance thrown at him just at the begin.
ning of the attack, as he sallied out of the tent they had made : the rest came
ofi'free, all but the fellow who was the mansion of all the mischief. who paid
dear enough for his black mistrem, for we could not hear what became ol'him
a great while. We lay upon the shore two days after, though the wind
presented, and made signals for him, and made our boat sail up share and
damn shore several leagues, but in vain, so we were obliged to give him over;
and if he alone had sufi'ered for it, the ions had been less.

I could not satisfy myself, however, without venturing on shore once more.
to try if I oould learn any thing of him or them, it was the third night alter
the action that I had a great mind to learn. if I could by any means, what
mischief we had done, and how the game stood on the Indiana' aide. I was
earefiil'to do it'in the dark, lest we should be attacked again; hot I ought,
indeed, to have been sure that the men [ went with had been under my
command, before I engaged in a thingso hazardous and mischievous as I
was brooght into by it, without design.

We took twenty as stout fellows with us as any in the ship, besida the
mpemrgo and myself, and we landed two home before midnight, at the
some place where the Indians stood drawn up in the evening before; I
funded here, because my design, as I have said, was chiefly to one if they
had quitted the field, and if they had left any marks behind them of the
mischief we had done them; and I thought if we could surprise one orbit)
of them, perhaps we might get ourman again, by way of exchange. ' '

ordinance from the other, tothe place; but at first could we nothing. it
being very dirk; on by~ahd~by our bootswain, who led the first party,
tumbled and fell over a dead body. This made them halt awhile; for
Knowing by the circumstances that they were at the place where the lodiaoo
and stood, they waited for my coming up there. We concluded to halt till
.he moon began to rue, which we knew would he in less than an hour, when
we could easily discern the havoc we had made among them. We told
thirty-two bodies upon the ground, whereof two were not quite deed; some
had an arm, and some a leg shot on", and one his head; those that were
wounded, we suppose, they had carried away. ,

When we had made, as I thought. a full discovery of all we could come
to the knowledge of, l was resolved for going on board; but the boatswain
and his party sent me word that they were resolved to make a visit to the
Indian town, where these dogs, as they called them, dwelt, and asked me to
go along with them; and if they could find them. as they still fancied they
should, they did not doubt of getting a good booty; and it might be they
might find Tom Jeffry there; that was the man's name we had lost.

Had they sent to ask my leave to go, l knew well enough what answer to
have given them; for I should have commanded them instantly on board,
knowing it was not a hazard fit for us to run, who had a ship, and ship-loading
in our charge, and a voyage to make which depended very much upon the:
lives of the men; but as they sent me word they were resolved to go, and
only asked me and my company to go along with them, I positively refused
it, and rose up. furl was sitting on the ground, in order to go to the boot.
One or two of the men began to importuue me to go; and, when I refused,
began to grumble, and say that they were not under my command, and they
would go. ' Come, Jack,' says one of the men, ' will you go with me 2 I'll
go for one.' Jack said he would-<<and then another,-and, in a word, they
all left me but one, whom i persuaded to stay, and a boy left in the boat.
80 the aupercargo and l. with the third man, went back to the boat, where
we told them we would stay for them, and take care to take in as many of
them as should be left; for I told them it was a mad thing they were going
about, and supposed most of them would run the fate of Tom Jefi'ry.

They told me, like seamen, they would warrant it they would come ofl'
again, and they would take care, 8w , so away they went I eotreated
them to consider the ship and the voyage, that their lives were not their
own, and that they were intrusted with the voyage, in some measure; that
if they miscarried, the ship might be lost for want of their help. and that
they could not answer for it to God or man. But I might as well have
talked to the mainmast of the ship; they were mad upon their journey, only
they gave me good words, and begged I would not be angry; that they did
not doubt but they would be back again in about an hour at farthest; for
the Indian town, they said, was not above half a mile 08; though they found
it above two miles before they got to it.

'- such as none but madmeu would have gone about, yet, to give them their
due, they went about it as warily as boldly : they were gallantly armed, for
they had every man a fusee or musket, a bayonet, and a pistol; some of them
had broad cutlasses, some of them had hangers, and the boatswain and two
more had pole-axes; besides all which, 'they had among them thirteen
hand-grenadoes : bolder fellows, and better provided, never went about any
wicked work in the world.

When they went out, their chief design was plunder, and they were in
mighty hopes of finding gold there; but a circumstance, which none of them
were aware of, set them on fire with revenge,'{and made devils of them all.
When they came to the few Indian houses which they thought had been'the
town, which was not above half a mile 03', they were under a great disap-
pointment, for there were not above twelve or thirteen houses; and where
the town was, or how big, they knew not. They consulted, therefore,
what to do, and were some time before they could resolve; for if they fell
upon thae, they must cut all their throats, and it was ten to one but some
of them might escape, it being in the night, though the moon was up; and
if one escaped, he would run and raise all the town, so they should have a
whole army upon them: again, on the other hand, if they went away and
lefi those untouched, for the people were all asleep, they could not tell
which way to look for the town: however, the last was the best advice; s
they resolved to leave them, and look for the town as well as they could.
They went on a little way, and found a cow tied to a tree; this, they pre-
sently concluded, would be a good guide to them; for, they said, the cow
certainly belonged to the town before them, or the town behind them; and
if they untied her, they should see which way she went; if she went back,
they had nothing tosay to her; but, if she went forward, they would follow
her: so they cut the cord, which was made of twisted flags, and the cow
went on before them, directly to the town; which, as they reported, con:
sisted of above two hundred houses or huts, and in some of these they found
several families living together.

Here they found all in silence, as profoundly secure as sleep could make
them: and, first, they called another council, to consider what they had to
do; and, in a word, they resolved to divide themselves into three bodies,
and so set three houses on fire in three .parts of the town; and as the men
came out, to seize them and bind them (if any resisted, they need not be
asked what to do then), and so to search the rest of the houses for plunder:
but they resolved to march silently first through the town, and see what
dimensions it was of, and if they might venture upon it or no. _

They did so, and desperately resolved that they would venture upon them :
but while they were animating one another to the work, three of them, who
were a little before the rest, called out aloud to them, and told them that-
they had found Tom Jeffry: they all ran up to, the place, where they found}
the poor fellow hanging up naked by one arm, and his throat cut. There
was an Indian house just by the tree, where they found sixteen or seventeen
of the principal Indians, who had been concerned in the fray With us before,804 THB use AND "neurones

and two or three of them wounded with our shot; and our men found they
were awake, and talking one to another in that house, but knew not their
number. .

The sight of their poor mangled comrade so enraged them, as before, that
they swore to one another they would be revenged, and that not an Indian
that came into their hands should have any quarter; end to wort they went
immediately, and yet not so madly as might be expected from the rage and
fury they were in. Their first care was to get something that would soon
take fire, but, after a little search, they found that would be to no purpose:
for most of the houses were low, and thatched with flags and rushes, of
which the country is full; so they presently made some wild-fire," we call
it, by wetting a little powder in the palm of their hands; and in a quarter
of an hour they set the town on fire in four or five places, and particularly
that house were the Indians were not gone to bed.

As soon as the fire began to blaze. the poor frightened creatures began to
rush out to save their lives, but met with their fate in the attempt; and
especially at the door, where they drove them back, the boatswoin himself
killing one or two with his pole--axe; the house being large, and many in it,
he did not care to go in, but called for a hand~grenado, and threw it among
them, which at first frightened them, but, when it burst, made such havoc
among them, that they cried out in a hideous manner. ln short, most of the
Indians who were in the open part at the house were killed or hurt with the
grenado, except two or three more who pressed to the door, which the
boatswain and two more kept, with their bayonets on the muzzle. of their
pieces, and dispatched all that came in their way: but there was another
apartment in the house, where the prince or king. or whatever he was, and
several others were; and these were kept in till the house, which was by
this time all in a light flame, fell in upon them, and they were smothered
together.

All this while they fired not a gun, because they would not waiter: the '
people faster than they could master them; but the fire began to woken
them fast enough, and our knows were glad to keep a little together in
bodies; for the fire grew so raging. all the houses being made of light com; .
bustible stufi', that they could hardly bear the street between them; and
their business was to follow the fire, for the surer execution: as fast as the
fire either forced the people out of those houses which were burning, or
frightened them out of others, our people were ready at their doors to knock
them on the head, still calling and hallooing one to another to remember
Tom Jetfry. ' '

' While this was doing, I must confess I was very uneasy, and especially
when I saw the flames of the town, which, it being right, seemed to be?
inst by me. My nephew, the captain, who was roused by his man, seeing
such a fire, was very uneasy. not knowing what the matter was, or what2
danger l was in, especially hearing the guns too, for by this time they begin-
to use their tire-arms; a thousand thoughts oppressed his mind concerning
me and the mpercargo, what would become of no; and, at last. though 1w
could ill spare any more men, yet not knowing what exigence we might be
-in, he takes another boat, and with thirteen men and himself comes on more
to me. ' '

He was surprised to see me and the supercargo in the boat, with no more
than two men; and though he was glad'that we were well, yet he was in
the same impatience with us to know what was doing; for the noise con-
tinned, and the flame increased; in short, it was next to an impossibility for
any men in the world to restrain their curiosity to know what had happened,
or their concern for the safety of the men: in a word, the captain told me
he would go and help his men, let what would come. I argued with him,
as I did before with the men, the safety of the ship, the danger of the voyage,
the interest of the owners and merchants, &C., and told him I and the two
men would go, and only see if we could at a distance learn what was like to
be the event, and come back and tell him. It was all one to talk to my
nephew, as it was to talk to the rest before; he would go, be said; and he
only wished he had left but ten men in the ship; for he could not think of
having his men lost for want of help; he had rather lose the ship, the voyage,
and his life and all; and away he went.

I was no more able to stay behind now than I was to persuade them not
to go; so, in short, the captain ordered two men to row back the pinuace,
and fetch twelve men more, leaving the long-boat at an anchor; and that
when they came back, six men should keep the two boats, and six more
come after us: so that he left only sixteen men in the ship; for the whole
ship's company consisted of sixty-five men, whereof two were lost in the late
quarrel which brought this mischief on.

Being now on the march, you may be sure we felt little of the ground we
trod on; and being guided by the fire, we kept no path, but went directly
to the place of the flame. If the noise of the guns was surprising to us be.
fore, the' cries of the poor people were now quite of another nature, and
filled \B with horror. ['must confess I was never at the sacking a city, . -
at the taking a town by storm. Ihad heard of Oliver Cromwell taking
Drogheda, in Ireland, and killing man, woman, and child: and I had read
of Count Tilly sacking the city of Magdebourg, and cutting the throats of
twenty-two thousand of allsexes; but 1 never had an idea of the thing itself be-
fore, nor is it possible to describe it, or the horror that was upon our minds,
at hearing it. However, we went on, and at length came to the: town,
though there was no entering the streets of it for the fire. The first object
we met with was the ruins of a hut or house, or rather the ashes of it, for the
house was consumed; and just before it, plain now to be seen by the light;
of the fire, lay four men and three women killed, and, as we thought, one
or two more lay in the heap, among the fire; in short, there were such
instances of rage altogether barbarous, and of a fury something beyond what
was human, that we thought it impossible our men couldbe guilty of "it;
or if they were the authors of it, we thought they ought to be every oneof "
hem put to the worst of deaths. But this was not all : wesaw memoirs;-

' as ' a Q ' ' " i "
creased forward, and the cry went on just as the tire went on; no that we
were in the utmost confusion. W'e advanced a' little way lather; and, be-
hold, to our astonishment, three naked women, and crying in a moot dreadfial
manner, come flying as if they had wings, and alter them sixteen or seventeen
men, natives, in the name terror and consternation, with three of our English
butchers in the rear; who, when they could not overtake them, fired in
among them, and one that was killed by their ohot fell down in our right.
When the rest saw us, believing us to be their enemies, and that we would
murder them as well as those that pursued them, they set up a. moat dreadful
shriek, especially the women, and two of them fell down, as if already dead,
with the fright.

My very soul shrunk within me, and my blood ran chill in my veins,
when Isaw this: and I believe, had the three English sailors tint pursued
them come on, I had made our men kill them all: however, we took some
ways to let the poor flying creatures know that we would not hurt them;
and immediately they come up to us, and kneeling down, with their hands
lifted up, made piteous lamentation to us to save them, which we let them
know we would; whereupon they crept altogether in a huddle close behind
us, as for protoctiou. I lett my men drawn up together, and charging them
to hurt nobody, but, if pouible, to get at some of our people, and-see what
devil it was posgesoed them, and what they intended to do, and to command
them 03'; assuring them that if they staid till daylight, they would have a
hundred thousand men about their ears: l my, I left them, and went among
those flying people, taking only two of our men with me; and there was
indeed 'a piteous spectacle among them : some of them had their feet terribly
burned, with trampling and running through the fire, others their hands
burned; one of the women had fallen down in the fire, and was very much
burned before she could get out again; and two or three of the men had
cuts to their backs and thighs, from our men pumnng; and another was
shot through the body, and died while I was there.

I would Iain have learned what the occasion of all this was, but I could
not understand one word they said; though, by signs, I perceived some of
them knew not what was the occasion themselves. I wanna terrified in my
thoughts at this outrageous attempt, that I could not atathere, but went
back to my own men, and resolved to go into the middle ot' the town, through
the fire, or Whatever might be in the way, and put an end to it, cost what it
would: accordingly, as 1 came back to my men, I told them my resolution,
and commanded them to follow me; when at the very moment came four
of our men, with the boatswaio at their head, roving over heaps of bodie.
they had killed, all covered with blood and dust, as if they wanted more
people to massacre, when our men hallooed to them as loud as they could
halloo ; and with much ado one oftbe'm made them hear, so that they knew
who we were, and name up to us.

An noon as the boatswain saw us, he set up a halioo like a shout ofhnumph,
for having. as he thought, more help come; and without waiting to hear me,
' Capuim'ays he,"nol>le captain! I am glad you are come; we are notor aonxnsorz censors. - 7&0?

half done yet : n'llanmxs hell--hound dogs! I'll kill as many of thcm'as poor
Toni has hairs upon his head : we have sworn to spare none of than; we'll
root out the very notion of them from the earth 2' and thus he ran on, out of
breath too with action. and would not give us leaveto speak a word.

At.last, raising my voice, that I might silence him a little, ' Barbaroos

for what we have done, come hither; and with that he shewed methe poor
fellow hanging, with his throat cut

I confess I Was urged then myself, and at another time would have been
forward enough; but I thought they had earned their rage too tar, and
remembered llaqoh's words to his sons Simeon and Levi--J'Comed be their
anger, for it was fierce; and their wrath, for it was cruel.' But I had now
a new task upon my hands; for when the men 1 carried with me saw the
sight, as [had done, I had as-much'to do to restrain them as I should have
had with-the others; nay, my nephew himself fell in with them, and told
me, in their hearing, that he was only concerned for fear of the men being
overpowered; and as to the people, he thought not one of them oughtto
live; for they had all glutted themselves with the murder of the poor man,

- pensive and sad; for I could not bear the sight, much less the horrible noise
and cries of the poor wretches that fell into their hands.

I got nobody to come back with me but thefnpercargo and two men.
and with these walked back to the boat. It was a very great piece of folly
in me, I confess, to venture back, as it were, alone ; for as it began now to he

men, armed with lance: and bows, at the little place where the twelve or
thirteen houses stood, mentioned before; but by accident I missed thepla'ce,

was broad day: immediately 1 took the pinnace and went on board; and
sent her back to assist the men in what might: happen. .

nor in all this terrible action was there a man that made any considerable
defence; they were so surprised between the terror of the fire and the

turn themselves 3 for if they fled one way they were met by one party; it
back again, by another; so that they were every where knocked down . nor

, I was very angry with my nephew, the captain ; and, indeed, with all the
men, in my mind, but with him in particular, as well for his acting no out of
hie duty, on commander of the ship, and having the charge of the voyage
upon him, as in his prompting, rather than cooling, the rage of his blind
men, in so bloody and cruel an enterprise. My nephew answered me very
reopectlhlly, but told me that when he saw the body of the poor seamen
whom they had murdered in so cruel and barbarous a manner, he was not
master of himself, neither could he govern his passion; he owned he should
not have done so. as he was commander of the ship; but as he was a men,
nod nature moved him, he could not bear it. A: for the rest of the men.
they were not subject to me at all, and they knew it well enough; so they
ook no notice of my dislike.

The next day we set sail. so we never heard any more of it. Our men
ordered in the account of the number they had killed; but according to the
beat of their accounts, put all together, they killed or destroyed about one
hundred and fifty people, men, women, and children, and left not a house '
standing in the town. A3 for the poor tenors Tom Jedi-y, no he was quite
dead (for his throat was to out that his head was half elf.) it would do him
no service to bring him away; so they only took him down from the tree,
when: he was hanging by one hand

However just our men thought this action, I was against them in it, and
1 always, after that time, told them God would blast the voyage , for I looked
upon all the blood they shed that night to he murder in them; for though

We were now bound to the gulf of Persia, and from thence to the coeit

.of Commendel, only totouch at Surat: but the chief of the mpencergo's

design lay at the bay of Bengal; where if he missed his business outward.
'eOund, he was to go up to China, and return to the coast as he came home.

The first disaster that befel us was in the gulf of Persia, where live 0! our
men venturing on shore on the Arabian ride of the gulf, were mnonn'de'd
by the Arabians, and either all killed or carried away into slavery; the rest
of the boat' a crew were not able to rescue them, and had but just time to get
03' their boat. I began to nphmid them with the just retribution of Heaven
in this case: but the boatswain very warmly told me, he thought I went
farther in my cenmree than I could show any contract for in Scripture; end
refined to Luke xiii. 4., where our Saviour intimatu that those men on
whom the tower of Silearn fell were not sinners above all the Galilean;
but that which put me-to silence in the case was, that not one of these five
men who were now loot were of those who went on shore to the nae-mere o
Madagascar, so I always called it, though our men could not bear to hear-the
word mm with any patience.

But my frequent preaching to them on the subject had worse consequences
than I expected; and the boatswain, who had been the heed oftheittempt,
came up boldly to me one time, and told' me he found that I brought that
aflhir continually upon the stage; that I made unjust reflections upon it,
had had used the men very ill on that account, and himself in particular;
that as .1 was but a passenger, and had no command in the~ship,' or'concern
in the voyage, they were not obliged to hear it; that they did not know but
I might have some ill design in my head, and perhaps, to call them to an
account for it when they come to England; and that, therefore, unless I
would resolve to have done with it, and alto not to concern myself any tim-

order: not to carry me on board any more. Any one may guess whet a.
surprise I was in at so insolent a message; and I asked the men, who bode
hiln deliver that message to me? He told me, the cochswain. 1 said no
. more to the fellow, but bade him let them know he had delivered his message,
.and that i had given him no answer to it.

1 immediately went and found out the supercargo, and told him the story;
adding, what I presently foresaw, that there would be a mutiuy in the ship;
and entreated him to go immediately on board the ship in an Indian boat,
and ecquaint'the captain of it. But I might have spared this intelligence,
for before I had spoken to him on shore the matter was effected on board.
The boatswain, the gunner, the carpenter, and all the inferior officers, as
soon as] was gone 03' in the boat, came up, and desired to speak with the
captain; and there the hoatswain, making a long hmngue, and repeating
,all he had said tome, told the captain, in a few words, that as! was now gone
peaceably on shore, they were loth to use any violence with me, which, if
I had not gone on shore, they would othemays have done, to oblige me to
have gone; they therefore thought fit to tell him, that as they shipped.
themselves to serve in the ship under his command. they would perform it
well and faithfully; but if I would not quit the ship, or the captain oblige
.me to quit it, they would all leave the ship, and sail no farther with him;
.and at that word all, he turned his face towards the mainmast, which was,
it seems, the signal agreed on between them, at which all the seamen, being
got together, there cried out, One and all! one and all I

My nephew, the captain, was a. man of spirit. and of great presence of
mind; and though he was surprised, you may be sure, at the thing, yet he
told them calmly that he would consider of the matter; but that he could
do nothing in it till he had spoken to me about it. He used some arguments
with them to show them the unreasonableuess and injustice of the thing:
but it was all in vain ; they swore, and shook hands round before his face,
that they would all go on shore, unless he would engage to them not to
sufi'er me to come any more on board the ship.

This was a hard article upon him, who knew his obligation to me, and
did not know how I might take it: so he began to talk smartly to them;
told them that I was a very considerable owner of the ship. and that, in
justice, he could not put me out of my own house; that this was next door
to servang me as the famous pirate Kidd had done, who made a mutiny in
the ship, set the captain on shore on an uninhabited island. and ran awsy
with the ship; that let them gointo what ship they would, if ever they came
to England again it would cost them very dear; that the ship was mine, and
that he could not put me out of it; and that he would rather lose the ship
and the voyage too than disohlige me so much; so they might do as "'er
pleased: however, he would go on shore and talk with me, and invited the.
boatswaiu to go with him, and perhaps they might accommodate the matter
with me But they all rejected the proposal, and said they would liqee:
nothing to do with me any more; and if I came on board. they would all go
on shore. ' Well; said the captain. ' if you are all of this mind. let me go on
shore and talk with him.' So away he came to me with this account, a little
afler the message had been brought to me from the ooelrswato.

I was very glad to see my nephew, 1 mnst confess; for! was not without
apprehensions that they would confine him by violence, set sail, and run
away with the ship; and then I had been stripped naked in a remote eonntry,.
having nothing to help myself; in short, I had been in a worse case than
when I was alone in the island. But they had not come that length, it seems, -
to my satisfaction; and when my nephew told me what they had said to
him, and how they had sworn and shook hands that they would, one and
all, leave the ship it I was sufi'ered to come on board, I told him' he should
not be concerned at it at all, for I would stay on shore: I only desired he
would take care and send me all my necessary things on shore, and leave me
a suflicient sum of money, and I would find my way to England as well as
i could.

This was a heavy piece of news to my nephew, but. there was no way to
help it but to comply; so, in short, he went on board the ship again, am
satisfied the men that his uncle had yielded to their importunity, and ban
sent for his .goods from on board the ship: so that the matter was over
in a few hours, the men returned to their duty, and 1 began to consider what
course I should steer.

I was now alone in the most remote part of the. world, as I think I may
call it. for 1 was near three thousand leagues by sea farther 03' from England
than I was at my island; only, it is true, I might travel here by- land over
the great Mogul's country no Surat. might go from thence to Baasora by sea,
up the gulph of Persia, and take the way of the caravans, over the Desert of
Arabia, to Aleppo and Seanderoon; from thence by sea again to Italy, and
so over land into France; and this put together might. at least; be a run
diameter ofthe globe, or. more.

I had another way before me, which was to wait for some English ships,
which were coming to Bengal from Achin, on theisland of Sumatra, and get ---
pamge on board one oftbem for England. But, as I came hither without any
concern with the English East India Company. 80 it would. be dificnlt to go
from hence without their licence, unless with. great favour of the captains of '

the ships, or the Company's motors, and to both I was an otter stranger.

thing, {raid here above nine months considering what course to take, and
how to manage myself. I had some English goodl with me of value, and a
considerable sum of money; my nephew furnishing me with a thousand
pieces of eight, and u l'ette'r of credit for more, ifI had occasion, that I might
not be straitened, whatever might happen.

I quickly disposed of me goods to advantage, and, as I originally intended,
I bought here some very good diamonds, which, of all other things, were the
moat proper for me in my present circumstances; because 1 could always
carry my whole estate about me.

Alter along stay here, and many proposal: made for my return to England,
but none falling out to my mind, the English merchant who lodged with me,
and whom I had contracted an intimate acquaintance with, came to me one
morning. ' Countryman,' says he, '1 hove a project to communicate to you,
which, as it suite with my thoughts, may, for ought I know, suit with your;
also, when you shall have thoroughly considered it. Here we are ported, you
by accident, and l by my own choice, in a part of the world very remote
from our own country; but it is in a country where, by no who understand
trade and business, a great deal of money is to be got. I! you will put one
thousand pounds to my one thousand pounds, we will hire a ship here, the
first we can get to our minds; you shall be captain, I'll be merchant, and
we'll go a. trading voyage to China: for what should we stand otiil for t The
whole world is in a motion, rolling round and round; all the creatures of
God, heavenly bodice and earthly, are busy and diligent; why should we be
idle? There are no drones in the world but men; why should we be of
that number?

I liked this proposal very well, and the more because it seemed to be ex~
pressed with so much good will, and in so friendly a manner. I will not say
but that I might, by toy-loose unhinged circumstances, be the fitter to em.
brace a proposal for trade, or, indeed, any thing else ; whereas, otherwise.
trade was none of my element. However, I might, perhaps, say with some
truth, that, if trade was not my element, rambling was, and no proyooal for
seeing any part ofthe world which I had never seen before could possibly
come amino to me.

It was, however, some time before we could get a ship to our minds, and,
when we had got a vessel, it was not easy to get English sailors; that is to
my, so many as were necessary to govern the voyage and manage the sailors
which we should pick up there. Alter some time we got a mate, a boot-
awain, and a gunner, English ; a Dutch carpenter, and three foremost-men.
With these we found we could do well enough, having Indian seamen, such
a they new, to make up.

There are so many travellers who have written the history oftheirwyageov
and travel: this way, that it would be very little diversion toasty Wy'td'
give a long account of the places we went to, and the people who inhabit
there; there thingsl leave to others, and refer the reader to those journalsJ
and travel: of Englishmen of which many, I find, are published, and W '
promued every day , it' re enough for me to tell you that we made this voya'r'ge '
to Acinn, in the island of Sumatra, and from thence to Siam. where we ex-

changed somoot' our wares for opium and' some arrack; the first a coma

modity which bears a great price among the Chinese, and which, at that
time, was much wanted there. In a word, we went up to Sustain, made a

very great voyage, were eight months out, and returned to Bengal; and I

was very well satisfied with my adventure. I observe that our people in

England often admire how ofiicers which the Company send into india, and
the merchants which generally stay there, get such very great estates-
ss they do, and sometimes ceme home worth sixty or seventy thousand
pounds at a. time; but it is no wonder, or, at least, we shall see so much

farther into it, when we consider the innumerable ports and places where

they have a free commerce, that it will be none ; and much less it will be so,

when we consider that at those places and parts where the English ships

come, there is such great and constant demand for the growth of all other

countries, that there is a certain vent for the returns, as well as a market

abroad for the goods carried out.

In short, we made a very good voyage, and I got so much money by my
first adventure, and such an insight into the method of getting more, that,
had I been twenty years younger, {should have been tempted to have staid
here, and sought no farther for making any fortune; but what was all this
to a men upwards of threescore, that was rich enough, and came abroad more
in obedience to a restless desire of seeing the world, than a covetons desire
of gaining by it ? And, indeed, I think it is with great justice I now can it:
restless desire, (or it was so. When I was at home, I was mtksstogo
abroad; and when I was abroad, I was restless to be at home. I say. what '
was this gain to me? I was rich enough already, nor had I any uneasy do,
sires about getting more money; and, therefore, the profit of the voyage to
me was of no great force for the prompting me forward to farther under-
takings; hence I thought that by this voyage I had made no progress at all,
because I was come back, as i might call it, to the place from whence I
came, as to a home: whereas my eye, which, like that which Solomon speaks
of, was never satisfied with seeing, was still more desirous of wandering and
seeing. I was come into a part of the world which I was never in before,
and that part,' in particniar, which I had heard much of, and was resolved to
see as much of it as 1 could; and then, I thought, I might say I had seen
ail the world that was worth seeing.

But my felicw-traveiier and i had difi'erent notions: I do not name this to
insist on my own, for I acknowledge his were the most just, and thinnest
suited to the end of a merchant' a life , who, when he or abroad upon other
taxes, it is his wisdom to stick to that, as the best thing for him, which he is
like to get the most money by. My new friend kept himself to the nature
or the thing. and would have been content to have gone like a carrier's
horse, always to the some inn, backward and forward, provided he could, as '
he called it, find his account in it. On the other hand, mine wasthe notion

was not all: I had a kind of impatience upon me to be nearer home, and yet
the most unsettled resolution imaginable which way to go. In the interval
of these consultations, my friend, who was always upon the search for busi-
ness, proposed another voyage to me among the Spice Islands, and to bring
home a loading of cloves from the Manillas, or thereabouts; places, indeed,
where the Dutch trade, but islands belonging partly to the Spaniards;
though we went not so far, but to some other, where they have not the
whole power, as they have at Batavia, Ceylon, &c.

Vl'e were not long in preparing for this voyage; the chief dificulty was in
bringing me to come into it: however, at last, nothing else ofi'ering, and
finding that really stirring about and trading, the profit being so great, and,
as I may say, certain, had more plmsure in it, and had more satisfaction to
my mind, than sitting still, which, to me especially, was the unhappiest part
of life, I resolved on this voyage too, which we made very successfully,
touching at Borneo, and several islands whose names I do not remember,
and came home in about five months. 'Ve sold our spice, which was chiefly
cloves and some nutmcgs, to the Persian merchants, who carried them away
to the gulf; and, making near five of one, we really got a great deal of _
money.

My friend, when we made up this account, smiled at me: ' Well, now,'
said he, with a sort of agreeable insult upon my indolent temper, ' is not
this better than walking about here, like a man of nothing to do, and spend-
ing our time in staring at the nonsense and ignorance of the Pagans?--
' Why, truly,' says I, ' my friend, I think it is, and I begin to be a convert
to the principles of merchandising; but I must tell you,' said I, ' by the way,
you do not know whatI am doing; for, if I once conquer my backward-
ness, and embark heartily, as old as l am,l shall harass you up and down the
world till I tire you ; for I shall pursue it so eagerly, I shall never let you
lie still.'

But, to be short with my speculations, a little while after this there came
in a Dutch ship from Batavia; she was a coaster, not an European trader,
of about two hundred tons burthen; the men, as they pretended, havnng
been so sickly,' that the captain had not hands enough to go to sea with, he
lay by at Bengal; and having, it seems, got money enough, or being willing,
for other reasons, to go for Europe, he gave public notice he would sell his
llllp. This came to my ears before my new partner heard of it, and I had a
great mind to buy it; sol went to him, and told him of it. He considered
awhile, for he was no rash man neither; but, musing some time, he replied,
' She is a little too big; but, however, we will have her.' Accordingly, we
bought the ship, and, agreeing with the master, we paid for her, and took
possession. When we had done so, we resolved to entertain the men, it' we
could, to join them with those we had, for the pursuing our business; but,
on a sudden, they having received, not their wages. but their share of the
money, as we afterwards learnt, not one of them was to be found; we inquired
much about them, and, at length, were told that they were all gohe together
by land to Agra, the great city of the Mogul's residence, and from thence to
travel to Surat, and go by sea to the gulf of Persia.

Nothing had so much troubled me a good while as that I should min the
opportunity of going with them; for such a ramble, I thought, and in such
company as would both have guarded and diverted me, would have suited
mightily with my great design; and I should have both seen the world and
gone homewards too: but I was much better satisfied a few days after, when
I came to know what sort of fellows they were; for, in short, their history
was, that this man they called captain was the gunner only, not the com-
mander; that they had been a trading voyage, in which they had been
attacked on shore by some of the Malays, who had killed the captain and
three of his men; and that, alter the captain was killed, these men, eleven
in number, had resolved to run away with the ship, which they did, and
brought her to Bengal, leaving the mate and five men more on shore; of
whom hereafter.

Well, let them get the ship how they would, we came honestly by her, as
we thought, though we did not, I confen, examine into things so exactly as.
we ought; for we never inquired any thing of the seamen, who would cer-
tainly have tattered in their account, contradicted one another, and, perhaps,
contradicted themselves; or, one how or other, we should have had reason
to have suspected them; but the man shewed us a. bill of sale for the ship, to
one Emanuel Clostershoven, or some such name, for I suppose it was all a
forgery, and called himself by that name, and we could not contradict him;
and withal having no suspicion of the thing, we went through with our
bargain. '

We picked up some more English sailors here after this, and some Dutch;
and now we resolved for a second voyage to the south-east for cloves, &c.,
that is to say, among the Philippine and Molucca isles; and, in short, not to
fill up this part of my story with trifles, when what is to come is so remark-
able, I spent, from first to last, six years in this country, trading from port to
port, backward and forward, and with very good success, and was now the last
year with my new partner, going in the ship above mentioned, on a voyage
to China, but designing first to Siam, to buy rice.

In this voyage, being by contrary wmds obliged to beat up and down a
great while in the straits of Malacca, and among the islands, we were no
sconer got clear of those difficult seas than we found our ship had sprung a
leak, and we were not able, by all our industry, to find out where it was.
This forced hs to make some port, and my partner, who knew the country
'better than I did, directed the captain to put into the river of Cambodia;
for I had made the English mate, one Mr. Thompson, captain, not being
wiling to take the charge of the ship upon myself. This river lies on the
north side of the great bay or gulf which goes up to Siam. While we were,
here, and going often on shore for refreshment, there comes to me oueday
an Englishman, and he was, it seems, a gunner's mate on board an English
East India ship which rode in the same river, up at or near the cityof Cam-.
bodla; what brought hlm hither we knew not; but he comes to me, and
speaking English, ' Sir,' says he, ' you are a stranger to me, and [to you.
but 1 have something to tell you that very nearly concerns you.'

I looked steadfastly at him a good while, and thought at first I had known
him, but I did not: ' If it very nearly concerns me,' said I, ' and not your.
self, what moves you to tell it to me tin-'1 am moved; says he, ' by the
imminent danger you are in. and, for aught lace, you have no knowledge of
it.'--' I know no danger 1 nm in,' says 1, ' but that my ship is leaky, and I
cannot find it out; but: I intend to lay her aground tomorrow, to see if I
can find it,'--' But, sir,' says he, ' leaky or not leaky, find it or not find it,
you will be wiser than to lay your ship on shore tomorrow, when you hear
what I have to say to you: do you know, sir,' said he, ' the town of Cam-
bodia lies about fifteen leagues up this river 6' and there are two large English
ships about five leagues on this side, and three Dutch.'--' 'Well,' said I, ' and
what is that to me ?'--' Why, sir,' said he, ' is it for a man that is upon such
adventures as you are, to come into a port and not examine first what
ships there are there, and whether he is able to deal with them? I suppose
you do not think you are a match for them ?' I was amused very much at his
discourse, but not amazed at it, for I could not conceive what he meant; and
I turned short upon him, and said. ' Sir, I wish you would explain yourself;
I cannot imagine what reason I have to be afraid of any of the Company's
ships, or Dutch ships: I an: no interloper; what can they have to say to
me ?' He looked like a man half angry and half pleased, and, pausing awhile,
but smiling, ' Well, sir,' says he, 'if you think yourself secure, you must take
your chance; I am sorry your fate should blind you against good advice; but
assure yourself, if you do not put to sea immediately, you will the very next
tide be attacked by five long~boats full of men, and perhaps, if you are taken,
you will be hanged for a pirate, and the particulars be examined afterwards.
I thought, sir,' added he, ' I should have met with a better reception than
this, for doing you a piece of service of such iinportnnce.'-' 1 can never be

with me, and I believe I could persuade him to tell you the rest; but there
is scarce time for it: but the short of the story is this, the first part of which,
i suppose, you know well enough, viz, that you was with this ship at Su-
matra; that there your captain was murdered by the Malays, with three of
his men; and that you, or some of those that were on board with you, ran
away with the ship, and are since turned pirates. This is the sum of the story,
and you will all be seized as pirates, i can assure you, and executed with
very little ceremony; for you know merchant ships shew but little low to
pirates, if they get them into their powerful Now you speak plain English,'
said I, ' andl thank you; and though I know nothing that we have done

honestly. I will be upon my guard.'-~' Nay, sir,' says he, ' do not tall: 0!

have any regard for your life, and the lives of all your men, put to sea, with-
out fail, at high water; and, as you have a whole tide before you, you will
be gone too for out before they can come down; for they will come away
at high water, and, as they have twenty miles to come, you will get near two
hours aheadof them by the difference of the tide, not reckoning the length of
the way ; besides, as they are only boats, and not ships, they will not venture
to follow you for out to sea, especially if it blows.deg-~' Well.' said I, ' you have
been very kind in this; what shall I do for you to make you amends l'----~
' Sir,' says he, ' you may not be willing to make me any amends, because
you may not be convinced of the truth of it: I will make an offer to you; I
have nineteen months' pay due to me on board the ship ' ' ', which I came
out of England in ; and the Dutchman that is with me has seven months' pay
due to him; if you will make good our pay to us, we will go along with you:
if you find nothing more in it, we will desire no more; but, if we do convince
you that we have saved your lives, and the ship, and the lives of all the men
in her, we will leave the rest to you.'

1 consented to this readily, and went immediately on board. and the two
men with me. As soon as I came to the ship's side, my partner, who was on
board, came out on the quarter-deck, and called to me, with a great deal of
joy, ' 0 ho! 0 ha! we have stopped the leak! we have slapped the leak !'
--' Say you so i' said I, 'thank God; but weigh anchor then immediately!--
' Weigh? says he: ' what do you mean by that? What is the matteri'-~
' Ask no questions; said I ; ' but all hands to work, and weigh without losing
a minute.' He was surprised; but, however, he called the captain, and he
immediately ordered the anchor to be got up; and though the tide was not
quite dowo, yet, a little land-breeze blowing, we stood out to sea. Then I
<<rolled him into the cabin, and told him the story; and we called in the men,
and they told us the rest of it: but, as it took up a great deal of time before
we had done, a seamen comes to the cabin-door, and called out to us that the
captain bade him tell us we were chased. 'Chased l' says I ; t by what l'~--
' By five sloopg or boats,' says the fellow, ' full of men.'--' Very well,' said
I ; ' then it is apparent there is something in it.' In the next place I ordered
all our men to be called up, and told them there was a design to seize the
ship, and to take us for pirates, and asked them it they would stand by us,
and by one another; the men answered cheerfully, one and all, that they
would live and die with us. 'then I asked the captain what 'way he thought best
for us to manage a fight with them ; for resist them I was resolved we would.
and that to the last drop. He said readily that the way was to keep them
03' with our great shot as long as we could, and then to fire at them with
our small arms, to keep them from boarding us; but, when neither of these
would do any longer, we should retire to our close quarters ; perhaps they
had not material: to break open our bulkheads, or get in upon us.

The gunner had, in the mean time orders to bring two guns to beer {are
and alt, out of the ateerage, to clear the deck, and load them with musket~
bullets and small pieces of old iron, and what come next to hand; and thus
we made ready for fight: but all this while we kept out to sea, with wind
enough, and could ace the boats at a distance, being fire large long-boot),
following us with all the soil they could make.

Two of those boat: (which by our glosses we could see were English)
out~sailed the rest, were near two leagues a--head of them, and gained upon
us considerably, so that we found they would come up with us; upon which
we tired a. gun without hall, to intimate that they should bring to: and we
put out a flag of truce, as a signal for parley; but they came crowding after
on; till they came within shot, when we took in our white dog, they having
made no answer to it, and hung out a red flag. and fired at them with a shot.
Notwithstanding this, they came on till they were near enough to call to
them with a speakingvtrumpet which we had on board; aowe called to
them, and bade them keep otl', at their peril. ,

It was all one; they crowded alter or, and endeavoured to come under
our stern, so as to board as on our quarter; upon which, seeing they were
reoolute for mischief, and depended upon the strength that followed them, I
ordered to bring the ship to, so that they lay upon our broadside; when
immediately we fired five guns at them, one of which had been levelled so
true as to carry away the stern of the hindermoot boat, and bring them to
the necessity of taking down their toil, and running all to the head of the
boat to keep her from sinking; coshe lay by, and had enough of it; but
seeing the foremost boat crowd on alter us, we made ready to fire at her in
particular. While this was doing, one of the three boats that was behind,
being forwarder than the other two, made up to the boat which we had
disabled, to relieve her. and we could see her take out the men: we called
again to the foremost boat, and offered a trace, to parley again, and to know
what her business was with us ; but had no answer, only the crowded close
under our stern. Upon this our gunner, who was a very dexternus fellow,
ran out his two chase-guns and fired again at her, but the shot missing. the
men in the boat shouted, waved their cape, and came on; hot the gunner,
getting quickly ready again. fired among them a second time, one shot of
which, though it missed the boat itself; yet fell in among the men, and we
could easily see had done a great deal of mischief among them; but we took
no notice of that, were the ship again, and brought our quarter to bear upon

them, and, firing three guns more, we found the boat was almost split to, p _
pieces; in particular, her rudder and a piece of her stern was that quite

away; so they handed her rail immediately, and were in greet dioorder.
But to complete their misfortune, our gunner let fly two gum at them again;
where he hit them we could not tell, but we found the boat was sinking, and. :
come of the men already in the water: upon this I immediate" manned out
our pmnaoe, which we had kept close by our side. with order: to pick up
some 0! the men, if they could, and save them from drowning, and imme-
diately come on board the ship with them, because we saw the rest of the
boats began to come up. Our men in the pinnace followed their orders,
and took up three men, one of whom was just drowning, and it was a good
while before we could recover him. As soon as they were on board, we
crowded all the sail we could make, and stood farther out to sea; and w
found that when the other three boats came up to the first, they gave over
their chase.

Being thus delivered from a danger, which, though I knew not the reason
of it, yet seemed to be much greater than I apprehended, I resolved that we
would change our course, and not let any one know whither we were going:
so we stood out to sea eastward, quite out of the course of all European ships,
whether they were bound to China or any where else, within the commerce
of the European nations.

When we were at sea, we began to consult with the two seamen, and
inquire what the meaning of all this should be; and the Dutchman let us
into the secret at once, telling us that the fellow that cold as the ship, as we
said, was no more than a thief, that had run away with hen Then he told
us how the captain, whose name too he told us, though Ida not remember
it now, was treacherously murdered by the natives on the coast ol' Malacca,
with three of his men; and that he, this Dutchman, and four more, got into
the woods, where they wandered about a great while, till at length he, in
particular, in a miraculous manner, made his escape, and swam 08' to a Dutch
ship, which, sailing near the shore in its way from China, had sent their boat
onshore for fresh water; that he durst not come to that part of the shore
where the boat was, but made shift in the night to take the water farther
08', and swimming a great while, at last the ship's hoot took him up.

He then told us that he went to Britain, where two of the seamen he-
longing to the ship arrived, having deserted the rest in their travels, and gave
an account that the fellow who had run away with the ship sold her at
Bengal to a set of pirates, which were gone acruizing in her; and that they
had already taken an English ship and two Dutch ships very richly laden.

This latter part was found to concern us directly, though we knew it to
be false: yet, as my partner said, very justly, if we had fallen into their
hands, and they had had such a prepoasueion against us beforehand, it had
been in vain for m to have defended ourselves, or to hope for any good
quarter at their hands; and especially considering that our accuser: had
been onrjudgea, and that we could have expected nothing from them but
' what rage would have dictated, and an ungorerned pauion have executed;
"and therefore it was his opinion we rhould go directly back to Bengal, from

whence we come, without putting in at any port whatever; because there
we could give a good'account of ourselves. could prove where we were when
the ship put in, of whom we bought her, and the like; and, which was more
than ell the not, it we were put upon the necessity of bringing it before the

proper judges. we should be sure to have some justice, and not to be hanged
first and judged afterwards.

I was some time of my partner's opinion; but, alter a little more serious
thinking, I told him I thought it was a very great hazard for us to attempt
returning to Bengal, for that we were on the wrong side of the Straits of
Malacca, and that if the alarm was given, we should be sure to be way-laid
on every side, as well by the Dutch of Batavia as the English elsewhere;
that if we should be taken, as it were, running away, we should even
condemn ourselves, and there would want no more evidence to destroy us.
I also asked the English sailor's opinion, who said he was of my mind, and
that we should certainly be taken. This danger a little startled my partner?
and all the ship' s company, and we immediately reached to go away to the
coast of Tonquin, and so on to the coast of China; and, pursuing the first
design as to trade, find some way or other to dispose of the ship, and come
back in some of the vessels of the country, such as we could get. This was
approved of as the best method for our security; and accordingly we steered
away N. N. E.. keeping above titty leagues 03' from the usual course to the
eastward. This. however, put us to some inconvenience; for, first, the
winds, when we came to that distance from the shore, seemed to be more
steadily against us, blowing almost trade, as we call it, from the E. and
E. N. E>> so that we were a long while upon our voyage, and we were but
ill provided with eictuals for so long a run; and, which was still worse
there was some danger that those English and Dutch ships, whose boats
pursued us, whereof some were bound that way, might be got in before us.
and if not, some other ship bound to China might have information of us
from them, and pursue us with the same vigour.

I must confess, I was now very uneasy, and thought myself, including the
late escape from the long-boats, to have been in the most dangerous eon~
dition that ever I was through my past lire; for whatever ill circumstances
I had been in, I was never pursued for a thief before; nor bad I ever done
any thing that merited the name of dishonest or Fraudulent. much less
thievish; I had chiefly been my own enemy, or, as I may rightly say, lhad
been uobody's enemy but my own: but now I was embade in the worst
condition imaginable; for though I was perfectly innocent, I was in no
condition to make that innocence appear; and if I had been taken, it had
been under a supposed guilt of the worst kind. This made me very anxious
to make an escape, though which way to do it I knew not, or what port or
place we could go to. My partner seeing me thus dejected, though he was
the most concerned at first, began to encourage me, and describing to me
the several ports of that coast. told me he would put in on the coastal"
Cochin China, or the'bay of Tonquin, intending to go afterwards to Macao,
ntown once In possession of the Portuguese, and where still a great many
European families resided, and particularly the missionary priests usually
went thither,' in order to their going forward to China.

Hither then we resolved to go, and accordingly, though after a tedzdm
or nonmsox' caisson. . ~ 821

and irregular course, and very much straitened. tor provisions, we came
within sight of the coast very early in the morning; and upon reflection on
the past circumstances we were in, and the danger if we had not escaped,
we resolved to put into a small river, which, however, had depth enough of
water for on and to see if we could, either over land or by the ship' s pinnace,
come to know what ships were in any port thereabouts. This happy step
was, indeed, our deliverance; for though we did not immediately see any
European ships in the bay of Tonqnin, yet the next morning there came
into the bay two Dutch ships; and a third, without any colours spread out,
but which we believed to be a Dutchman, passed by at about two lesgues'
'di'staooe, steering for the coast of China; and in the altemoon went by two
English ships steering the same course; and thus we thought we saw our~
selves beset with enemies both one way and the other. The place we were in
was wild and barbarous; the people thieves, even by occupation or pro-
. tendon; and though, it is true, we had not much to seek of them, and, except
- getting a few provisions, cared not how little we had to do with them, yet
it was with much difficulty that we kept ourselves from being insulted by
them several ways. We were in a small river of this country, within a few
leagues of its utmost limits northward; and by our boat we coasted north-
east, to the point of land which opens the great bay of Tonquin; and it was
in this heating up along the shore that we discovered we were surrounded
with enemies. The people we were among were the most barbarous of all
the inhabitants of the coast, having no correspondence with any other nation,
and dealing only in fish and oil, and such gross commodities; and it may be
particularly seen that they are the moat barbarous of any of the inhabitants.
Among other customs, they have this one, via, that if any vessel has the
misfortune to be shipwrecked upon their coast, they presently make the men
all prisoners or slaves; and it was not long before we found a piece of their
kindness this way, on the occasion following.

I have observed above, that our ship spnmg a leak at sea, and that we
could not find it out 5 and it happened that, as l have said, it was stopped
unexpectedly, in the happy minute of our being to be seized by the Dutch
and English ships in the bay of Siam; yet, as we did not lied the ship so
perfectly tight and sound as we desired, we resolved, while we were at this
place, to lay her on shore, and take out what heavy things we had on board,
and clean her bottom; and, if possible, to find out where the leaks were.
Accordingly, having lightened the ship, and brought all our guns and other
moveables to one side, we tried to bring her down, that we might come at
her bottom; but, on second thoughts, we did not care to lay her on dry
ground, neither could we find out a proper place for it.

The inhabitants, who had never been acquainted With such a sight, came
Wandering down the shore to look at us; and, seeing the ship lie down on
one side in such a manner, and heeling in towards the shore, and not seeing
our men, who were at work on her bottom with stages, and'with their boots
on the 03' side, they presently condudcd that the ship was cast away, and
lay so fast on the ground. On this supposition. their all came about us in

two or three hours' time, with ten or twelve large boats, having some of
them eight, some ten men in a boat, intending, no doubt, to have come on
board and plundered the ship; and if they had found us there, to have
carried us away for slaves to their king, or whatever they call him, for we
knew nothing of their governor.

When they came up to the ship and began to row round her, they dis-
covered as all hard at work on the outside of the ship's bottom and side,
washing, and graying, and stopping, as every seahtring man knows how.
They stood for awhile gazing at us, and we, who were a little surprised,
could not imagine what their design was; but being willing to be sure, we
took this opportunity to get some of us into the ship. and others to hand
down arms and ammunition to those that were at work to defend themselves
with, if there should he occasion; and it was no more then need; for in less
than a quarter of an hour's consultation, they agreed, it seems, that the ship
was really a. wreck ; and that we were all at work endeavouring to save her,
or to save our lives by the help of our boats; and when we handed our arms
into the boats, they concluded, by that motion, that we were endeavouring
to save some of our goods; upon this they took it for granted we all belonged
to them, and away they came directly upon our men, as if it had been in a
line of'bsttle.

Our men, seeing so many of them, began to be frightened, for we lay but
in an ill posture to light, and cried out to us to know what they should do.
I immediately called to the men that worked upon the stages, to slip them
down, and get up the side into the ship; and bade those in the boat to row
round, and come on board; and those few of us who were on board worked
with all the strength and hands we had, to bring the ship to rights; but,
however, neither the men upon the stages nor those in the boats could do
a: they were ordered, before the Cochin Chinese were upon them; and two
of their boats boarded our long-boot, and began to lay hold on the men as
their prisoners. -

The first man they laid hold on was on English man, s. stout, strong
fellow, who, having a musket m his hand, never ofi'ered to fire it, hot laid
It down in the boat, like a fool, as Ithonght; but he understood his business
hotter than I could teach him, for he grappled the pagan, and dragged him
by main force out of their boat into ours, where, taking him by the ears, he
beat his head so against the boat's gnnnel, that the fellow died in his hands;
and, in the mean time, a Dutchman, who stood next, took up the musket,
and with the butt~end of itso laid about him, that he knocked down live or
them who attempted to enter the boat. But this was doing little towards
resisting thirty or forty men, who fearlesg because ignorant of their danger,
began to throw thesmlves into the longvhont, where we had but live men
in all to defend it: but the following accident, which deserved our laughter.
gave our men a complete victory.

Our carpenter being prepared to grave the outside of the ship, as well as
to pay the seams where he had eaulked her to stop the leaks, had got two
kettles just let down into the boat, one tilled with boiling pitch, and the
other with main, tallow, and oil, and nudge/tofu the shipwright: use for
that work; and the man that attended the carpenter had a great iron ladle
in his hand, with which be supplied the men that were at work with the
hot atufi'; two of the enemy's men entered the boat just were this fellow
stood, being in the forevaheets: he immediately saluted them with a ladle
(all ofthe stud", boiling~hot, which so burned and scolded them, being half-
naked, that they roared out like bulls, and, enraged with the fire, leaped
both into the sea. The carpenter new it, and cried out, Well done, Jack !
give them some more of it: and stepping forward himself, takes one of the
mops, and dipping it in the pitchapot, he and his man threw it among- them
so plentiihlly, that, in abort, of all the men in the three heats there war not
one that escaped being welded and burned with it, in amoat frightful, pitiful
manner, and made such a bowling and crying, that 1 never heard a worse
noise : for it is worth observing, that though pain naturally makes all people
cry out, yet entry nation has a particular way of exclamation, and makes
noise: as different from one another as their speech. I cannot give the noise
these creatures made a better name than howling, nor a more more proper
to the tone of it; for! never heard any thing more like the noise of the
wolves, which. as 1 have said, I heard bowl in the forest on the frontiers of
Languadoo.

I was never better pleased with a victory in my life; not only as it was a
perfect surprise to me, and that our danger was imminent before, but, as
we got this victory without any bloodshed, except of that man the llallow
killed with his naked hands, and which I was very much concerned at, for
1 was sick of killing such poor savage wretches, even though it was in my
own defence, knowing they come on errands which they thought just, and
knew no better; and that though it may be a just thing, because neceenry
(for there is no necessary wickednes in nature), yet I thought it was a sad
life, when we must be always obliged to be killing our fellow--creatures to
preserve ourselves; and, indeed, I think so still, and 1 would even now under
a great deal, rather than i would take away the life even ofthe worst per-Ion
injuring me; and, I believe, all considering people who know the value of J.
life would be of my opinion, if they entered seriously into the consideration
of it; '

But to return to my story :<<All the while this was doing, my partner
and I, who outraged the rest of the men on board, had with great dexterity
brought the ship almost torrighta, and having got the gone into their place:
again, the gunner called to me to bid our boat get out of the way, for he
would let fly ainoug them. 1 called back again to him, and bid him not
offer to fire, for the carpenter would do the work without him; but bid him
heat another pitchokettle, which our cook. who was on board, took care of:
but the enemy was so terrified with what they had met with in their fint
attack, that they would not come on again; and some of them who were
fartheat'ofl'; seeing the ship ewiin, as it were, upright. began, as we suppose, a
to see their mistake, and give over the enterprise, finding it was not as they-
expected.- Thus we got clear: of this merry fight, and haying got some rice}~ '

a394 rue use arm sovnxrunes

and some roots and breed, with about sixteen hogs, on board, two days
before, we resolved to stay here no longer, but go forward, whatever came
of it; for we mode no doubt but we should be surrounded the next day with
rogues enough, perhaps more than our pitch-kettle would dispose of for us.
We therefore got sll our things on board the some evening, and the next
morning were ready to sail: in the meantime, lying at anchor at some
distance from the shore, we were not so much concerned, being now in as
lighting posture, as well as in a sailing posture, it any enemy had presented.
The next day. having finished our work within board, and finding our ship
was perfectly healed of all her leaks, we set sail. We would have gone into
the bay of Touquin, for we wanted to inform ourselves of what was to be
known concerning the Dutch ships that had been there; but we durst not
stand in there, because we had seen several ships go in, as we supposed, but
a little before; so we kept on N. E. towards the island of Formosa, as much
afraid of being seen by a Dutch or English merchant ship, as a Dutch or
English merchant ship in the Mediterranean is of an Algerian sunroof-war.

When we were thus got to see, we kept on N. E. as if we would go to
the Monitlas or the Philippine islands, and this we did that we might not Fall
into the way of any oi the European ships; and then we steered north, till we
came to the latitude of 22 deg. 30 min., by which means we made the island
Formosa directly, where we came to an anchor, in order to get water and
fresh provisions, which the people there, who are very courteous and civil
in their manners, supplied us with willingly, and dealt very fairly and
punctuaily with us in all their agreements and bargains, which is what we
did not find among other people, and may he owing to the remains of
Christianity which was once planted here by a Dutch missionary of pro-
tcstants, and is a testimony of what I have otten observed. viz, that the
Christian religion always civilizes the people and reforms their manners,
where it is received, whether it works saving cfi'ects upon them or no.

From thence we sailed still north, keeping the coast of China at an equnl
distance, till we knew we were beyond all the ports of China where our
European ships umally come; being resolved, if possible, not to fall into any
of their hands, especially in this country; where, as our circumstances were,
we could not thil of being entirely mined.

Being now come to the latitude of thirty degrees, we resolved to put into
the first trading port we should come at; and standing in for the shore, a
boat came of two leagues to us, with an old Portuguese pilot on board, who
knowing us to be an European ship, came to offer his service. which, indeed.
we were glad of; and took him on board; upon which, without asking us
whither we would go, he dismissed the boat he come in, and sent it back.

I thought it was now so much in our choice to make the old man carry
us whither we would, that I began to talk to him about carrying on to the
gulf of Nunquin, which is the most northern part of the coast of China.
The old man said he knew the gulf of Nanuin very well, but smiling, salted
us what we would do there 3 'I told him we would sell our cargo and purchase
China were; calicoes, raw silks, tea, wrought silks, &c., and so would return

\or nonixson CRUSOE 825

by the same course we came. He told us our best port had been to have
put in at Macao, where we could not have failed of a market for our opium
to our satisfaction, and might for our money have purchased all sorts of China
goods as cheap as we could at Nanquin.

Not being able to put the old man out of his talk, of which he was very
opinionated or conceited, I told him we were gentlemen as well as merchants,
and that we had a mind to go and see the great city of Peking, and the
famous court of the monarch of China. ' Why then,' says the old man, ' you
should go to Ningpo, where, by the river which runs into the sea there, you
may go up within five leagues of the great canal.' This canal is a navi-
gable stream, which goes through the heart of that vast empire of China,
crosses all the rivers, passes some considerable bills by the help of sluices
and gates, and goes up to the city of Peking, being in length near two
hundred and seventy leagues. .

' Well,' said I, ' Seignior Portuguese, ' but that is not our business now;
the great question is, if you can carry us up to the city of Nanquin, from
whence we can travel to Peking afterwards 2' He said we could do so very
well, and that there was a great Dutch ship gone up that way just before.
This gave me a little shock, for a Dutch ship was now our terror, and we
had much rather have met the devil, at least if he had not come in too
frightful a figure; and we depended upon it that a Dutch ship would be our
destruction, for we were in no condition to fight them; all the ships they
trade with into those parts being of great burden, and of much greater force
than we were.

The old man found me a little confused, and under some concern, when
he named a Dutch ship; and said to me, 'sir, you need be under no appre-
hensions of the Dutch; I suppose they are not now at war with your nation 7
--' No,' said I, ' that's true; but I know not whatliberties men may take
'when they are out of the reach of the laws of their own country.'---' Why,'
says he, ' you are no pirates; what need you fear? They will not meddle
with peaceahle merchants, sure.'

If I had any blood in my body that did not fly up into my face at that
word, it was hindered by some stop in the vessels appointed by nature to
circulate it, for it put me into the greatest disorder and confusion imaginable:
nor was it possible for me to conceal it so, but the old man easily perceived it.

' Sir,' says he, ' I find you are in some disorder in your thoughts at my
talk; pray be pleased to go which way you think fit, and depend upon it,
I'll do you all the service I cau.'--' Why, seignior,' said 1, ' it is true, I am a
little unsettled In my resolution at this time, whither to go in particular;
and I am something more so for what you said about pirates. I hope there
are no pirates in these seas; we are but in an ill condition to meet with
them, for you see we have but a small force, and are but very weakly

have been any pirates in these seas these fifteen years, except one, which

murdered him; but no they afterwards ran away with the ship, it is generally

1, ' they deserve death as much as if they had done it themselves.'----' Nay;
says the old man, ' they do deserve it; and they will certainly have it. if
they light upon any English or Dutch ship; for they have all agreed
together, that if they meet that rogue they'll give him no quarterlw' But,'
said I to him, ' you say the pirate is gone out of these seas; how can they
meet with him then t'm' Why, that's true,' says he, ' they do say so; but
he was, a: I tell you, in the bay of Siam, in the river Cambodia; and was
discovered there by some Dutchmen who belonged to the ship, and who
were let! on shore when they ran away with her; and some English and
Dutch traders being in the river, they were within a little of taking him:
nay,' said he, ' it' the foremost boats had heen welt seconded by the rest, they
had certainly tnhen him; but he, finding only two boats within reach of
him, tacked about, and fired at those two, and disabled them before the
other: came up, and then standing ofi' to sea, the others were not able to
follow. and it; he got away; but they have all so exact a description of the
ship, that they will be sure to know her; and wherever they find her they
have vowed to give no quarter either to the captain or seamen, but to hang
them all up at the yord~nrm,'--' What 2' said l, ' will they execute them
right or wrong; hang them first and judge them afterwards t'-~' 0, sir,"
any: the old pilot, ' there is no need to make a formal business of it with such
rogues as those; let them tie them back to buck, and set them afliving, 'til
no more than they doserre.'

1 know I had my old me>> first on board, and that he could do no harm,
so that I turned short upon him: ' Well now, seignior,' said I, ' this is the
very reason why I would have you carry us up to Nauquin, and not put
back to Macao, or to any other part of the country where the English or
Dutch ships come; for be it known to you, seignior, those captainsot' the
English and Dutch ships are a parcel of rash, proud, insolent fellows, that
neither know what belongs to justice, or how to behave themselves as the
lows of God and nature direct; but being proud of their offices, and not
understanding their power, they would act the murderers to punish robbers;
would take upon them to insult men falsely accused, and determine them
guilty without due inquiry: and perhaps I may live to bring some of them
to account for it, when they may he taught how justice is to he executed;
and that no man ought to be treated as a criminal till some ev'nlence may
be had of the crime, and that he is the man.'

With this I told him that this was the very'ship they attacked, and gave
him 3 full account of the skirmish we had with their boats, and how foolishly
and cowardly they believed. I told him all the story of our buying the ship,
and how the Dutchman served us. I told him the reasons 1 had to believe
the story of killing the plaster by the Molaysns was true, as also the running
away with the ship; but it was all a fiction of their own to suggest that the
men had turned pirates, and they ought to have been sure it was so before
they had ventured to attack us by surprise, and oblige us to resist them;
adding, that they would have the blood of those men, whom we killed there
in just defence, to answer for.'

The old man was amazed at this relation, and told us we were very much
in the right to go away to the north; and that if he might advise us, it
should be to sell the ship in China, which we might very well do, and buy
or build another in the country; and, said he, though you will not get so
good aship, yet you may get one able enough to carry you and all your
goods back again to Bengal, or any where else. [told him i would take
his advice when I came to any port where 1 could find a ship for my turn,
or get any customer to buy this. He replied, l should meet with customers
enough for the ship at Nanquin, and that a Chinese junk would serve me
very well to go back sgnin; and that he would procure me people both to
buy one and sell the other. ' Well but, seiguior,' said I, ' as you say they
know the ship so well, I may, perhaps, if I follow your measures, be instru-
mental to bring some honest innocent men into a terrible broil, and perhaps
to he murdered in cold blood; for wherever they find the ship, they will
prove the guilt upon the men, by proving this was the ship. and so innocent
men may probably be overpowered and murderedJ-'w' Why,' says the old
man, ' I'll find out a way to prevent that also; for, as I know all those com~
mention: you speak of very well, and shall see them all as they pass by, I will
be sure to set them to rights in the thing, and let them know that they had
been so much in the wrong; that though the people who were on board at
first might run away with the ship, yet it was not true that they had turned
pirates; and that, in particular, those were not the men that first went 0!?
with the ship, but innocently bought her for their trade; and I am per.
waded they will-so for believe me, as, at least, to out more cautiously for the
time to come.' -

While these things were passing between us, by way of discourse, we
went forward directly for Nanquin, and in about thirteen days" sail came to
an anchor at the south--west point of the great gal!" of Nanoin; where, by
the way, I came by accident to understand that two Dutch ships were gone
the length before me, and that I should certainly {all into their hands. I
consulted my partner again in this exigeucy, and he was as much at a loss
as I was, and would very gladly have been safe on shore almost any where:
however, I was not in such perplexity neither, but l asked the old pilot it
there was no creek or harbour which I might put into and pursue my
business with the Chinese privately, sudr be in no danger of the enemy.
He told me, it' I would sail to the southward about forty-two leagues. there
was a little port called Quinchang, where the fathers of the mission molly
landed from Macao, on their progress to teach the Christian religion to the.28 The are we sovnuruans

Chinese, and where no European ships ever put in; and, it! thought to put
in there, I might consider what farther course to take when l was on shore.
lle confessed, he said, it was not a place for merchants, except that at some
res-lain times they had a kind of a fair there, when the merchants from
Japan came over thither to buy the Chinese merchandises.

.We all agreed to go back to this place; the name of the port, as he called
.t, I may perhaps spell wrong, for I do not particularly remember it. having
lost this, together with the names of many other places set down in a little
pocket-book, which was spoiled by the water by an accident; but this 1
remember, that the Chinese or Japanese merchants we corresponded with
called it by a different name from that which our Portuguese pilot gave it,
and pronounced it as above, Quinchang.

As we were unanimous in our resolution to go to this place, we weighed
the next day, having only gone twice on shore where we were to get fresh
water; on both whichoccasiona the people of the country were very civil to
us, and brought us abundance of things to sell to us, 1 mean of provisions,
plants, roots, tea, rice, and some fowls, but nothing without money.

We came to the other port (the wind being contrary) not till five days,
but it was very much to our satisfaction; and I was joylhl, and I may say
thankful, when I set my foot onzshore, resolving, and my partner too, that if
it was possible to dispose of ourselves and efi'ects any other way, though not
every way to our satisfaction, we would never set one tbot on board that
millappy vessel more; and, indeerl, 1 must acknowledge, that, of all the cir-
cumstances at life that ever I had any experience of, nothing makes mankind
so completely miserable as that of being in constant fear. Well does the
Scripture say, 'Thc fear of man brings a snare ;' it is a life of death, and the
mind is so entirely oppressed by it, that it is capable of no relief.

Nor did it fail at its usual operations upon the fancy, by heightening every
danger, representing the English and Dutch captains to be men incapable of
hearing reason, or of Bistinguishing between honest men and rogues; or
between a story calculated for our own turn, made out of nothing, on pur~
pose to deceive, and a true genuine account of our whole voyage, progress,
and design; for we might many ways have convinced any reasonable urea.
tore that we were not pirates; the goods we had on board, the course we
steered, our frankly abewing ourselves, and entering into such and such ports;
and even our very manner, the force we had, the number of men, the few
arms, little ammunition, short provisions; all these would have served to'
convince any 'men that we were no pirates. The opium and other goodswe
had on board would make it appear the ship had been at Bengal. The
Dutchmen, who, it was said, had the names of all the men that were in the
ship. might easily see that we were a mixture of English, Portuguese, and
Indians, and but two Dutchmen on board. These, and many other particuo
lar circunntanccs, might have made it evident to the understanding of any
~ mum-under, whose hands we might fall into, that we were no pirates. But
tear, that blind, useless passion, worked another way, and threw us into the
vapours; it bewildered our understandings, and set the imagination at work
to form a tnousaud terrible things that perhaps might never happen We
first supposed, as indeed every body had related to us, that the seamen on
board the English and Dutch ships, but especially the Dutch, were so enraged
at the name of a. pirate. and especially at our heating ott' their hosts and
cscaping,.that they would not give themselves leave to inquire whether we
were pirates or no; but would execute us otl' hand, as we call it, without
giving us any room for a defence. We reflected that than really was so
much apparent evidence before tliem, that they would scarce inquire after
any more ; as, first, that the ship was certainly the some. and that some of
the acumen among them know her, and had been on board her; and,
secondly, that when we had intelligence at the river of Cambodia that they
were coming down to examine us, we fought their boats and fled; so that
we made no doubt but they were as fully satisfied of our being pirates, as
we were satisfied of the contrary; and, as I often said, 1 know not but 1
should have been apt to have taken those circumstances for evidence, it the
tables were turned, and my case was theirs; and have made no scruple of
cutting all the crew to pieces, without believing, or perhaps considering,
what they might have to utter in their defence.

But let that be how it wiii, these were our apprehensions; and both my
partner and I scarce slept a night without dreaming of halter: and yard-
arms, that is to say, gibbets; of fighting, and being taken; of killing, and
being killed: and one night I was in such a fury in my dream, fancying thc
Dutchmen had boarded us, and l was knocking one of their seamen down,
that I struck my double fist against the side of the cabin I lay in with such
a force, as wounded my hand grieroosly, broke my knuckles, and cut and
bruised the flesh, on that it awaited me out of my sleep. _

' Another apprehension I had was. the cruel usage we might meet with
four them if we fell into their hands: then the story of Amboynu csm'e into
my head. and how the Dutch might perhaps torture us, as they did our
tountrymeu there, and make some of our men, by extremity of torture,
conlhss those crimes they never were guilty of, or own themselves and st! of
us to be pirates, and so they would put us to death with a formal appearance
of justice; and that they might be tempted to do this for the gain ofoutf ship
and cargo. which was worth four or five thousand pounds, put all together.

. These things tormented me and my partner too, night and day; nor did
sic-consider that the captains of ships have no authority to act that; and it
we' [had surrendered prisoners to them, they could not answer the destroying
us, or torturing us, but would be. accountable for it when they came to their
own country; this, I say, gave me no satisfaction; for if they were to act
.hns with us, what advantage would it be to us thstthoy should be called to
on account for it? or if we were first to be murdered, what satisfaction
' would it he to us to hove them punished when they came home i

I cannot refrain taking notice here what reflections I now had upon the
vast variety, of my particular circumstances; how hard I thought it was, that
"who had spent forty years in a life of continual dificultirs, and was at last
coma, as it were, to the port or boron which all men drive at, via, to have

87 . . s '1'330 Tillz'. um um noveu'ruass

rest and plenty, should be a volunteer in new sorrows by my own unhappy
choice; and that I, who had escaped so many dangers in my youth, should
now come to be hanged in my old age, and in so remote is place, {or a crime
which I was not in the least inclined to, much less guilty of.

Alter these thoughts, something of religion would come in; and I should
be considering that this seemed to me to be a disposition of immediate Fro-
videm'e, and I ought to look upon it and submit to it as such; that, although
I was innocent as to men, l was far from being innocent as to my Maker;
and l ought to look in and examine what other crimes in my life were most
obvious to me, and for which Prontience might justly inflict this punish-
ment as a retribution ; and that I ought to submit to this, just as i would to
a shipwreck, if it had pleased God to have brought such a disaster upon me.

in its turn, natuml courage would sometimes take its place, and then I
would he talking myself up to vigorous resolutions; that! would not be
taken to be barbarously used by a parcel of merciless wretches in cold blood
that it were much better to have fallen into the hands of the savages, though
I was sure they would feast upon me when they had taken me, than those
who would {perhaps glut their rage upon me by inhuman tortures and bar.
barities; that, in the ease of the savages, I always resolved to die lighting to
the last gm), and why should I not do so now, seeing it was much more
dreadful, to me at least, to think of falling into these men's hands, than ever
it was to think of being eaten by inn) ? for the savages, to give them their one,
would not eat a man till he was killed and dead, but that these men baa
many arts beyond the cruelty of death. Whenever these. thoughts prevailed,
I was sure to put myself into a kind of fever with the agitation of a supposed
light; my blood would boil, and my eyes sparkle, as if I was engaged, and I
always resolved to take no quarter at their hands; but, even at last, if I
could resist no longer, 1 would blow up the ship and all that was in her, and
leave them but little booty to boast of.

The greater weight the anxieties and perplexitios of these things were to
our thoughts while we were at sea, the greater was our satisfaction when we
saw ourselves on shore; and my partner told me he dreamed that he had
a very heavy load upon his back, which he was to carry up a hill, and found
that he was not able to stand longer under it; but that the Portuguese pilot
came and took it off his back, and the hill disappeared, the ground before
him appearing all smooth and plum ; and truly it was so; they were all like
men who had a load taken off their backs. For my part, I had a weight
taken off from my heart that it was not able any longer to bear; and, as I said
above, we resolved to go no more to sea in that ship. When we came on
shore, the old pilot, who was now our friend, got us a lodging .and a ware-
house for our goods, which, by the way, was much the some: it was a little
house, or hut, with a larger house adjoining to it, all built with canes, and
pa'hsadoed round with large canes, to keep out pilfering thieves, of which, it_
seems, there were not a few in that country; however, the magistrates
allowed us a little guard, and we had a soldier with a kind of halberd, or
half-pike, who stood sentinel at our door; to whom we allowed a pint of nee,
and e little piece of money, about the value of three-pence, per day, so that
our goods were kept very safe.

The fair, or mart, usually kept in this place, had been over some time;
however, we found that there were three or {our junks in the river, and two
Japanners, I mean ships from Japan, with goods which they had bought in
China, and were not gone away, having some Japanese merchants on shore.

The first thing our old Portuguese pilot did for us was, to get us acquainted
with three missionary Romish priaits who were in town, and who had been
there some time converting the people to Christianity; but we thought they
made but poor work of it, and made them but sorry Christians when they
had done; however, that was none of our business. One of these was a
Frenchman, whom they called Father Simon : another was a Portuguese, and
the third 3 Genome; but Father Simon was courteous, easy in his manner,
and very agreeable company; the other two were more reserved, seemed
rigid and austere, and applied seriously to the work they mine about, via,
to talk with, and insinuate themselves among, the inhabitants, wherever they
had opportunity. We often ate and drank with these men; and though, I
must confess, the conversion, as they call it, of the Chinese to Christianity is
so far from the true conversion required to bring heathen people to the faith
of Christ, that it seems to amount to little more than letting them know the
name of Christ, and say some prayers to the Virgin Mary and her Son, in e
tongue which they understand not, and to cm themselves, and the like;
yet it must be confessed that the religionists, whom we all missionaries, have
a firm belief that these people will be saved, and that they are the instruments
of it; and, on this account, they undergo not only the fatigue of the voyage,
and the hazards of living in such places, but oftentimes death itself, with the
most violent tortures, for the sake of this work.

But to return to my story : This French priest, Father Simon, was
appointed. it seems, by order of the uhiefof the mission, to go up to Peking,
the royal seat of the Chinese emperor, and waited only for another priest,
who was ordered to come to him from Macao, to go along with him; and
we scarce ever met together but he was inviting me to go that journey;
telling me how he would shew me all the glorious things of that mighty
empire. and, among the rest, the greatest city in the world; ' a city,' said
he, ' that your London and our Paris put together, cannot be equal to.' This
was the city of Peking, which, I confess, is very great, and infinitely full of
people; but, as I looked on those things with difi'crent eyes from other men,
so I shall give my opinion of them in a few words. when I come in the course
of my travels to speak more particularly of then).

But, first, I come to my friar or missionary. Dining with him one day
and being very merry together, I showed some little inclination to go with
him; and he pressed me and my partner very hard, and with a great many.
persuasions, to consent. ' Why, Father Simon,' says my partner, ' should
you desire our company so much 1i you know we are heretics, and you do
not love us, nor (rennet keep us company with any pleasure.'--' O,' says he,
' you may perhaps he good catholics in time; my business here is to convert
heathem, and who knows but i may convert you too l'u' Very well. Father,
said l, ' so you will preach to us all the way t'-----' I will not be troublesome
to you,' says he; 'our religion doee not direct us of good manners: besides,
we are here like countrymen; and so we ate, compared to the place we are
in; and if you are huguenota, and I a catholic, we may all be Christiana at
last; at least, we are all gentlemen, and we may converse so, without being
uneasy to one another.' I liked this part of his discourse very well, and it
began to put me in mind of my priest that I had left in the Brazils ; but this
Father Simon did not come up to his character by a great deal; for though
Father Simon had no appearance at" a criminal letity in him neither, yet he
had not that fund of Christian zeal, Itrict piety, and sincere afl'ection to reli-
gion.'thut my other good ecclesiastic had.

But to leave him a little, though he never left us, nor soliciting ua (ago with
him; we had something else before us at first, for we had all this while our
ship and our merchandise to dispose of, and we began to be very doubtful what
we should do, for we were now in a place of very little busineu; and once
i was about to venture to soil for the river of Ethan, and the city 0! Non-
qnin; but Providence sccmcd now more visibly, as I thought, than ever, to
concern itsclt' in our atliairs; and l was encouraged, from this very time, to
think I should one way or other get out of this entangled circumstance, and
be brought home to my own country again, though I had not the least view
of the manner. l'rovidence, 1 any, began here to clear up our way a little-
and the first thing that offered was, that our old Portuguese pilot brought a
Japan merchant to us, who inquired what good: we had ; and, in the first
place, he bought all our opium, and gave us a very good price for it, paying
no in gold by weight, some in small pieces of their own coin, and some in
small wedges, of about ten or eleven ounces each. While we were dealing
- with him for our opium. it came into my head that he might perhaps deal for
the ship too, and l ordered the interpreter to propane it to him ; he shrunk up
his shoulders at it, when it was first proposed to him; but, in a few days after,
he came to me, with one of the missionary priests for his interpreter, and
told me he had a proposal to make to me, which was thin--he had bought
a great quantity of goods of us, when he had no thoughts of proposals made
to him of buying the ship; and that, therefore, he had not money enough to
pay for the ship: but if I would let the come men who were in the ship
navigate her, he would hire the ship to go to Japan; and would send them
from thence to the Philippine islands, with another loading, which he
would pay the freight of before they went from Japan; and that, at their
return. he would buy the ship. I began to listen to his proposal, and so
eager did my head still run upon rambling, that I could not but. begin to
entertain a notion of going myself with him, and so to soil from the Philip-
pine islands away to the South Sena; accordingly, I asked the Japanese
merchant if he would not hire us to the Philippine islands, and discharge us
there. He said, ' No, he could not do that, for then he could not have the
return of his cargo; but he would discharge usin Japan, at the ship's return.'
Well, still I was for taking him at that proposal, and going myself; but my
'K.

partner, wiser than myself. persuaded me from it, representing the dangers.
as well ot' the seas asof the Japanese, who are a false, cruel, and tracheo-
ous people; likewise those of the Spaniards at the Philippines more Nae,
cruel, and treacherous, than they.

But to bring this long turn of our ofi'uirs to a conclusion : the first thing
we had to do was. to consult with the captain of the ship, and with his
men, and know it' they were willing to go to Japan: and while I Was doing
this, the young man whom my nephew had lolt with me as my companion
for my travels, came to me, and told me that he thought that voyage pro-
mined very fair, and that there was a great prospect of advantage, and he
would he very glad if I undertook it; but that if I would not, and would
give him leave, he would go as a merchant, or how I pleased to order him;
that if ever he came to England, and I was there and alive, he would render
me a faithful account of his success, which should he as much mine a I
pleased. I was really lath to part with him; but, considering the prospect
of advantage, which really was considerable, and that be was a young fellow
as likely to do well in it as any I knew. I inclined to let him go; but I told
aim I would consult my partner, and give him an answer the next day. My
partner and l discoursed about it, and my partner made a. most generous
ofi'cr: ' You know it has been an unlucky ship,' said he, ' and we both
resolve not to go to sea in it again; if your steward (so he called my man'
will venture the voyage, I will leave my share of the vessel to him, and let
him make the best of it; and if we live to meet in England, and he meets
with success abroad, he shall account for one half of the profits of the ship's
height to us; the other shall be his own.

If my partner, who was no way concerned with my young man, made him
such an alter, I could do no less than otfer him the some: and all the ahip'
company being willing to go with him, we made over half the ship to him in
property, and took a writing from him, obliging him to account for the other;
and away he went to Japan. The Japan merchant proved a very punctual
honest man to him; protected him at Japan, and got him a licence to come
on shore, which the Europeans in general have not lately obtained; paid
him his freight very punctually; sent him to the Philippines. loaded with
Japan and China wares. and a sopercargo of their own, who, trafficking
with the Speniards, brought back European goods again, and a great quan-
tity of cloves and other spices; and there he was not only paid his freight
very well, and at a very good price, but not being willing to sell the ship
then. the merchant furnished him goods on his own account; and with some
money, and some spice; of his own which be brought with him, he went
back to the Manillos to the Spaniards, where he told his cargo very well.
Here, having got a good acquaintance at Manilla, he got his ship made a free
Ihlp; and the governor of Manillo hired him to go to Acapulco in America,
on the coast of Mexico, and gave him a licence to land there, and to travel
to Mexico. and to pass in any Spanish ship to Europe with all his men. "He
made the voyage to Acapulco very happily. and there he sold his chip; and,
lining there also obtained allowance to travel by land to Porto Bella, he found
means, somehow or other, to get to Jamaica, with all his treasure; and.
about eight years after, came to England exceeding rich, of which I shall
take notice in its place ; in the mean time, I return to our particular efl'airs.

Being now to part with the ship and ship's company, it come before us, of
course, to consider what recompence we should give to the two men that
gave as such timely notice of the design against us in the river Cambodia.
The truth was, they had done as 0. very considerable service, and deserved
well at our hands; though, by the way, they were a couple of rogues too;
for, as they believed the story of our being pirates, and that we had really
run away with the ship, they come down to us not Only to betray the design
that was formed against us, but to go to sea with us as pirates; and one of
them confessegl uflerwnrtls, that nothing else but the hopes of going a roguing
brought him to do it: however, the service they did us was not the less; and,
therefore, as i had promised to be grateful to them, i first ordered the money
to be paid them which they said was due to them on board their respective
ships ; over and above that, I gave each of them a small sum of money in
gold, which contented them very well; then I made the Englishman gunner
in the ship, the gunner being now made second mate and purser; the Dutch-
man I made boatswani; so they were both very well pleased, and proved
very serviceable, being both able seamen, and very stout fellows.

We were now an shore in China: it! thought myself banished and remote
from my own country at Bengal, where i had many ways to get home for
my money, what could I think of myself now, when l was get about a
thousand leagues farther oil' from home, and perfectly destitute of all man-
ner of prospect of return? All we had for it was this, that in about four
months' time there was to be another fair at the place where we were, and
then we might be able to purchase all sorts of the manufactures of the coun-
try, and withal might possibly find some Chinese junk: or vessel: tl'om
Tonquin, that would be to be sold, and would carry no and our goods whither
we pleased. Thisl liked very well, and resolved to wait; besides, as our
particular persons were not obnoxious, so if any English or Dutch ships
came thither, perhaps we might have an opportunity to load our goods, and
get passage to some other place in indie, nearer home. Upon these hopes
we resolved to continue here; but, to divert ourselves, we took two or three
journeys into the country. First, we went ten days' journey to the city of
Nanquin, a city well worth seeing, indeed; they say it has a million of
people in it: it is regularly built, the streets all exactly straight, and cm
one another in direct lines, which gives the figure of it great advantage.
But when l come to compare the miserable people of these countries with
ours, their fabrics, their manner of living, their government, their religion,
their wealth, and their glory, as some call it, I must confess that l scarcely
think it worth my while to mention them here. It is very observable, that
we wonder at the grandeur, the riches, the pomp, the ceremonies, the govern-
ment, the manufactures, the commence, and conduct of these people; not
that it is to be wondered at, or, indeed, in the least to be regarded, but
because having <<one notion of the barbnrity of those countries, the rudeness
and the ignorance that prevails there, we do not expect to find any such
thing so far 06'. Otherwise, what are their buildings to the palaces and
royal buildings of Europe? What their trade to the unireml commerce of
England, Holland, France, and Spain? What are their cities to ours, for
wealth, strength, gaiety of apparel, rich furniture, and infinite variety I
What are their ports, supplied with a few junks and barks, to our naviga~
tion, our merchant fleets, our large and powerful naviesl' Our city of
London has more trade than half their mighty empire: one English. Dutch,
or French man of war of. eighty guns, would be able to tight almost all the
shipping belonging to China : but the greatness of their wealth, their trade.
the power of their government, and the strength of their armies, may be a
little surprising to us, because, as I have said, considering them as a bar-
harons nation of pagans, little better than savages, we did not expect such
things among them: and this, indeed, is the advantage with which all their
greatness and power is represented to as; otherwise, it is in itself nothing at
all; for what I have said of their ships may be said of their armies and
troops, all the forces of their empire. though they were to bring two mil-
lions of men into the field together, would be able to do nothing but ruin
the country and starve themselves : if they were to hesiege a strong town in
Flanders, or to fight a disciplined army, one good line of German enirassiers,
or of French cavalry, might withstand all the horse of China; a million of
their foot could not stand before one embattled body of our infantry, posted
so as not to be surrounded, though they were not to he one to twenty in
number; nay, I do not boast it I say that thirty thousand German or Eng~
lish foot, and ten thousand horse, well managed, could defeat all the forces of _
China; and so of our fortified towns, and of- the art of our engineers in
assaulting and defending towns; there is not a fortified town in China could
hold out one month against the batteries and attacks of an European army;
and, at the same time, all the armies of China could never take such a town
as Dunkirk, provided it was not starved; no, not in a ten years' siege. 'They
have fire-arms, it is true, but they are awkward and uncertain in their going
03'; and their powder has but little strength. Their armies are badly dis~
ciplined, and want skill to attack, or temper to retreat; and, therefore, I must
confess, it seemed strange to me, when I came home, and heard our people
say such fine things of the power, glory, magnificence, and trade of the'
Chinese; because, as far as I saw, they appeared to he a contemptihle herd
or crowd of ignorant sordid slaves, subjected to a government'qnalified only
to rule such a people: and were not its distance lnoonceivahly great from
Masonry, and the Muscovite empire in a manner as rode, impotent, and ill-
govemed as they, the Czar of Moscovy ought thh ease drive them all out
of their country, and conquer them in one campaign: and had the Czar
(who is now a grown; prince) fallen this way, instead of attacking the
warlike Swedes, and equally improved himself in the art of war, as they say
he has done; and if none of the powers of Europe had envied orinterv
tripled him, he might by this time have been emperor chenille, instead d
being beaten by the king of Sweden at Nana, when the latter was not one
to six in number. As their strength and their grandeur, so their nangation,
commerce, and husbandry, is very imperfect, compared tothe same things in
Europe: also in their knowledge, their learning, and in their skill in the
sciences, they are either very awkward or defective, though they have globes
and spheres, and a smattering of the mathematics, and think they know more
than all the world besides; but they know little of the motions of the hea-
venly bodies: and so grossly and absurdly ignorant are their common people,
that when the sun is eclipsed, they think a great dragon has assaulted it, and
is going to run away with it; and they fall a clattering with all the drums
and kettles in the country, to fright the monster away, just as we do to hive
a swarm of bees.

As this is the Only excursion of the kind which I have made in all the
accounts I have given of my travels, so I shall make no more such ; it is
none of my business, nor any part of my design; but to give an account oh
my own adventures through a life of inimitable wanderings, and a long
variety of changes, which, perhaps, few that come after me will have heard
the like of: I shall therefore say very little of all the mighty places, desert
countries, and numerous people I have yet to pass through, more than relates
to my own story, and which my concern among them will make necessary

I was now, as near as I can compute, in the heart of China, about thirty
degre3s north of the line, for we were returned from Nanquin: I had,
indeed, a mind to see the city of Peking, which I had heard so much of, and
Father Simon importnned me daily to do it. At length, his time of going
away being set, and the other missionary who was to go with him being
arrived from Macao, it was necessary that we should resolve either to go or
not; so I referred it wholly to my partner, and left it entirely to his choice,
who at length resolved it in the atfirmative, and we prepared for our journey.

"'e set out with very good advantage. as to finding the way, for we got
leave to travel in the retinue of one of their Mandarins, a kind of vieeroy or

principal magistrate in the province where they reside, and who take great
state upon them, travelling with great attendance and with great homage from
the people, who are sometimes greatly impoverished by them, being obliged to
furnish provisions for them and all their attendants in their journeys. That
which I particularly observed, as to our travelling with his baggage, was this,
that though we received sufficient provisions both for ourselves and our horses
from the country, as belonging to the Mandarin, yet we were obliged to pay
for every thing we had, after the market price of the country, and the
Mandarin's steward collected it duly from us; so that our travelling in the
retinue of the Mandarin, though it was a very great kindness to us, was not
such a mighty favour in him, but was a great advantage to him, considering
there were above thirty other people travelled iu the same manner besides
us, under the protection of his retinue; for the country furnished all the
provisions for nothing to him, and yet he took our money for them.

We were twenty-five days travelling to Peking, through a country infi-
nitely populous, but, I think, badly cultivated; the husbandry, the economy,
and the way of living miserable, though they boast so much of the industryIR 17.? SS 9) E53

of the mple; I say miserable. if compared with our own, but not to to
these poor wretches, who know no other. _The pride of the people is ml!-
nitely great, and exceeded" by nothing but their poverty, in some parts,
which adds to that which I call their misery; and I must needs think the
naked savages of America live much more happy than the poorer sort of
there, because as they have nothing, so they desire nothing; whereas these
are proud and iosolent, and in the main are in many parts mere beggars and
dmdges; their ostentation is inexpressible; and. if they can, they love to
keep multitudes of servants or slaves, which is to the last degree ridiculous,
as well as the contempt of all the world but themselves.

I must confess, l travelled more pleasantly afterwards in the deeertspnd
mt wildcmesses ofGrand Tartar-y than here ; and yet the roads here are well
paved and well kept, and very convenient for travellers: but nothing was
more awkward to me than to see such a haughty, imperious, insolent people,
in the midst ot' the grosses: simplicity and ignorance; and my friend Father
Simon and I usedto be very merry upon these occasions, to see the beggnrly '
pride of these people: for example, coming by the house of a eooutry
gentleman, as Father Simon called him, about ten leagues 03' the city of
Nanqoin, we had first of all the honour to ride with the master of the house
about two miles; the state he rode in was a perfect Don Quixotism. being
a mixture of pomp and poverty. His habit was very pmper for a sata-
mooch, or merry-andrew, being a dirty calico, with hanging-sleeves, tassela.
and cuts and slashes almost on every side; it covered a tafi'ety rest, as greasy .
as a butcher's, and which testified that his honour must be a most exquisite
sloven.- His horse was but a poor, starved, bubbling creature, and he had
two slaves followed him on foot to drive the poor creature along; 'he had o
whip in his hand, and he belaboured the beast as fast about the head as his
slam did about the an; and thus he rode by or, with about ten or twelve
serrate, going from the city to his country seat, about half It league before
tri.' We travelled on gently, but this figure of a gentleman rode away
before us, and on we stopped at a village about an hour to refresh on, when '

at him the better he would be pleased. He sat under a tree, something like
the palmetto, which effectually shaded him over the head. and on the south
side; but under the tree was also placed a huge umbrella. which made that
part look well enough; he sat lolling back in a great elbow-chair, being a
heavy oorpulent man, and had his meat brought him by two women stores;
'he had two more, one of which fed the squire with a spoon, and the other
3held the dish with one hand, and scraped ofi' what he let fall upon his

himself what dainties the country justice had to feed on in all his mm, which
he had the honour to taste of, and which was, I think. a mess of boiled rice,
with a great piece of garlic in it, and a little bag filled with green pepper.
and another plant which they have there, something like our ginger, but
smelling like musk, and tasting like mustard: all this was put together, and
s small piece of lean mutton boiled in it, and this was his Lorship's report;
four or five servants more attended at a distance, who, we supposed, were to
eat of the same alter their master.

As for our Mandarin with whom we travelled, he was respected as a king,
surrounded always with his gentlemen. and attended in all his appearance:
with such pamp, that I saw little of him but at a distance; but this I
observed, that there was not a horse in his retinue but that our carrier-sf
pack-horses in England seemed to me to look murh hotter ; though it was
hard to judge rightly, for they were so covered with equipage, mantles,
tmppiugs, 8.1,, that we could scarce see any thing but their feet and their
heads as they went along.

made this journey the plensouter to me; nor had I any ill accident attended

not deep, but it wetteli me all over. 1 mention it, because it spoiled my

as to the names of some places I touched at in this journey.

At length we arrived at Peking ; I had mhody with me but the youth

who proved very trusty and diligent; and my partner hsd nobody with him

here, if he could vest it in China silks, wrought and row, ouch as might be
worth the carriage, he would be content to go to England, and then make
his voyage back to Bengal by the Company's ships,

Roving resolved upon this, we agreed that if our Portuguese pilot would
go with us we would hear his charge: to Moscow, or to England, if be
pleased; nor, indeed, were we to be esteemed over generous in that neither,
if we had not rewarded him farther, the service he had done us being really
worth more than that: for he had not only been a pilot tone at see, but he
had been like a broker for us on shore; and his procuring for no the Japan
merchant was some hundred- of pounds in our pockets. So we consulted

together about it, and being willing to gratify him. which was but doing '

hirn justice, and very willing also to have him with us besides, for he was o
most necessary men on all occasions, we agreed to give him a quantity of
coined gold, which, an I compute it, came to about one hundred and seventy-
five pounds sterling, between on, and to bear all his charges, both for himself
and horse, except only a home to carry hie goods. Haring settled this
between oomlvec, we called him to let him know what we had resolved.
I told him he had complained of our being to let him go back alone, and I
was now to tell him we were resolved he should not go back at all; that a
we had resolved to go to Europe with the caravan, we resolved also he
should go with us; and that we called him to know his mind. He chock
his head, and said, it wee a long journey, and lie hid no pm to carry
him thither, or to eubaist himself when he come there. We told him we
believed it we. no. and therefore we had resolved to do oomething for him
that should let him see how sensible we were of the service he had done no,
and also how agreeable he was to us; and then I told him what we had
resolved to give him here, which he might lay out as we would do ourown;
and that u for his charges. if he would go with us we would set him nfeou

would, at our own charge, except only the carriage of his goods. He-
rein-iced the proposal like a man transported, and told us he would go with
us over the whole world; and so we all prepared for our journey. However.
as it was with us, so it was with the other merchants; they had many things
to do; and, imtead of being ready in five weeks, it was four month: and
tome days before all things were got together.

It was the beginning of February. our style, when we set out from Peking.
My partner and the old pilot had gone express hack to the part where we
had find put in, to dispooe of some good: which we had left there; and I,
with a ("hinvse merchant whom I had some knowledge of at Nnnquin, and
who came to Poking on his own affairs, went to Nnnquin, where i bought
nine-t} pieces of line dnmusku, with about two hundred pieces of other very
fine. silks of am cm] sorts. some mixed with gold, and had all these brought
to Peking against my partner's return; besides this, we bought a very large
quantity of row silk, and some other goods, our cargo amounting, in these
goods only, to about three. thousand five hundred pounds sterling; which,
together with tea, and some tine calh-oeo, and three camels' load: of nutmeg:
and cloves, loaded in all eighteen camels for our share, besides thou we rode
upon; which, with two or three spare horses, and two horses loaded with
provisions, made in, in short, twenty-six camel: and horses in our retinne.

The roxnpany was very great, and, as near as I can remember. made
between three and four hundred home, and upwards of one honored and
twenty men, wry well armed, and provided for all events: foresthe eastern
caravans are subject to be attacked by the Arabs, so are these by the
Tartan; but tllejr are not altogether so dangerous as the Arabs, nor so
barbarous, when they prevail.

The coznpany ,ronsistetl of people of several nations; but were were
above sixty of them merchants or inhabitants of Moscow, though of them
some were Livoniaus , and, to our particular satisfaction, five of them were
Scots, who appeared also to be men of great experience in business, and of
very 30ml substance. .

When we had travelled one day's journey, the guides, who were five in
number, called all the gentlemen and merchants, that is to say, all the
passengers except the servants, to a great council. as they called it. At this
council every one deposited as certain quantity of money to a common stock,
{or the net-marry expense of buying forage on the way, where it was not
otherwise to be had, and for satisfying the guides, getting homes, and the
like: and here they constituted the journey, as they call it, riL, they named
captains and officers to draw us all up, and give the word of command. in
case of an attack, and give every one their turn of command; nor was this
forming as int>> order any more than what we found ueedful upon the way.
as shall be observed.

The road all on this ride of the country is very populous, nod infull of

China~ware; and as I was coming along, our Portugal pilot, who Ind

variety of colours, mixed with gold; many tiles making but one figure, but
joined so artificially. the mortar being made of the same earth, that it was
very hard to see where the tiles met. The floors of the rooms were of the .

parts of England; as hard as stone, and smooth, but not burned endpoint-id.

They told me there were fountains and fish-ponds in the garden, all ' paved .

This odd eight kept me two hour- hehind the caravan, for which the leader
of it for the day fined me about the value o! three shillings; and toldme,

in two days more we passed the great China wall, mode for a fortification
against the Tortars; and a very great work it is, going over hill: and moun-
taint in a noodles: track, where the reeks are impassable. and the precipitm
such as no enemy could possibly enter, or indeed climb up, or where, if they
did, no wall could hinder them. They tell us its length is near a thousand
English milcx, hot that the country is live hundred in straight omred
line, which the wall bounds, without measuring the windings and turning:
it takes; it is alsout four fathom: high, and as many thick in some places.

I stood still an hour, 'or thereabout, without trespassing our orders {for to
long the caravan was in passing the gate) to look at it on every side, near
and far 05', I mean that was within my View; and the guide of our menu,
who had been extolling it for the wonder of the world, was mighty eager to
hear my opinion of it; l told him it was a most excellent thing to keep out

took it for a compliment; but the old pilot laughed: ' O, aetgnior ingleno,'

almost out of their country, and he was to leave no in a little time alter this;
but when he knew what I said, he was dumb all the rent of the way, and
we heard no more of his fine story of the Chinese power and greatneu while
he staid. '

After we had passed this mighty nothing, called a wall. something like the
Picts' wall, so Mom in Noflhumberland, built by the Romans, we began to

find the country thinly inhabited, 'and the people rather confined to live in

distinctly, I wondered more that the Chine-e empire could be conquered by
such oontemptihle fellows , for they are a mere horde of wild fellows, keep-
ing no order, and understanding no discipline or manner of fight. Their
horses are poor lean creatures, taught nothing, and fit for nothing, and this
We found the first day we saw them, which was after we entered the wilder

however, it mny be called hunting too, {or the creatures areflxe wildest and

generally thirty or' ' forty in a flock, and, like true sheep, always keep

ln pursuit of this odd sort of game, it was our hop to meet with about forty
Tutors; whether they were hunting mutton as we were, or whether they
looked forenother kind of prey, we know not; but, u soon as they new no,

supposed this was to enli their friend: about them, and so it was; for, in lean
than ten minutes, a troop of forty or filly more appeared at about a mile
distance; but our work was over first, as it happened.

One of the Scots merchants of Moscow happened to be amongst us, and
as soon as he henrd the horn, he told no that we had nothing to do but to
charge them immediately, without lore of time; and, drawing as up in a
line. he asked if we were resolved. We told him we were ready to follow
him; no he rode directly toward: them. They stood gazing at on like a
mere crowd, drawn up in no order, nor ehewing the face of any order at all;
but, no noon a they saw on advance, they let fly their errown, which, how-

were wounded we knew not; but this we knew, that the other party were .
so frightened with the noise o! our guns, that they made ofi', and never made
any attempt upon no.

We were all this while in the Chinese dominion; and therefore the
Tartar: were not so bold or afterwards; but in about five days we entered
a vest, great, 'wikl desert. whit-h held no three day: our! nighta' march; and
we were obliged to carry our water with us in great leathern bottles, and to
encemp all night, just as l have heard they do in the desert of Arabia

I asked our guide: whose dominion this was in: and they told me this
was a kind of border, that might be called no man's land, being a port of
Great Kamkatliay. or Grand Tartary; but, however, it was all reckoned as
belonging to China, but that therie: was no care taken here to preserve it
from the inroads of thieves, and therefore it was reckoned the worst desert
in the whole march, though we were to go over some much larger.

in passing this wilderness, which was at first very frightful to me, we saw,
two or three times' little parties of the Tartan, but they seemed to be upon
their own affairs, and to have no design upon us: and so, like the man who
met the devil, if they had nothing to say to us, we had nothing to my to
them; we let them go. Once, however, a party of them came to near as to
stand and gaze at as; whether it was to consider if they should attack us or
not, we knew not; but when we were pained at some distance by them, we
made a rear guard of forty men, and stood ready for them, letting the caravan
pose half a mile or therealiouta before us: but alter awhile they marched
ofi'; only we found they saluted us with live arrows at their parting. one of
which wounded a. horse. so that it disabled him. and we left him the next
day, poor creature, in great need of a good terrier: they might shoot more
arrows, which might {all shorter us, but we saw no more arrow: or Tartar:
that time.

We travelled near a month alter this. the ways not being so good as at
first, though still in the dominion: of the emperor of China, but ill} for the
most part in villages, some of which were fortified, beam of the incursion;
of the Tartan. When we were come to one of these town: (it was about
two days and a half journey before we were to come to the city of Nauru),
I wanted to buy a camel, of which there are plenty to be sold all the way
upon that road, and horses also, such as they are, beam, so many caravans ~
coming that way, they are alien wanted. The person that! spoke to. to get
rne e camel, would have gone and fetched 'one for me; but I, like a fool,
mmt be omcions, and so myself along with him: the place wee about two
miles out of the village, where, it seems. they kept the camel: and horse:
feedibg under a. guard

I walked it on foot, with my old pilot and o Chinwe, being very desirous
of a little variety. When we more to the place, it was a. low marshy gram,
walled round with a stone wall. piled up dry, without mortar or earth amen;
it, like a park, with a little guard of Chinese soldiers at the door. Haring
bought a camel, and agreed for the price, 1 come away, and the Chinatown
that went with me led the camel, when, on a sudden, up mule fire Tm
on horseback; two of them seized the fellow, and took the camel from him,
while the other three stepped up to me and my old pilot, seeing us. as it
were, unarmed, for I had no weapon about me but my sword, which could.
but ill defend me against three horsemen. The first that name up stopped
short upon my drawing my sword, for they are arrant cowards, but a second
coming upon my loll, gave me a blow on the head, which I never felt till
afterwards, and wondered, when I came to myself, what was the matter, and
where I was, for he laid me that on the ground; but my nerer-ihiling old
pilot, the Portuguese (so Providence, unlocked for, directs deliverance: from
dangers which to us are unforeseen), had a pistol in his porket, which!
knew oothingof, nor the Tartar: neither; it' they had, I suppose they would
not have attacked us; but cowards he always boldest when there is no
danger. The old man seeing me down, with a hold heart stepped up to the
fellow that had struck me, and laying hold of his arm with one hand, and
pulling him down by main force a little towards him with the other, shot
him in the head, and laid him dead upon the spot. He then immediately
stepped up to him who had shipped us, as I said, and before he could come
forward again. made a blow at him with a scimitar which he always wore,
but missing the man, out his horse in the side of his head, out one of the ears
of? by the root, and a great slice down by the side of his face. The poor
beast, eomged with the wound, was no more to be governed by his rider,
though the fizllow sat well enough too, but away he flew, and carried him
quite out of the pilot's reach; and at some distance rising npon his hind
legs, threw down the Tartar, and on upon him.

In this interval, the poor Chinese came in who had lost the camel, but he
had no weapon: however, seeing- the Tartar down, and hishorse fallen
upon him, awsy he runs to him, and seizing upon an ugly ill-favoured

weapon he had by his side. something like a pole-axe, but not a pole-axe.

neither, he wrenched it from him, and made shift to knock his Tartsrisn
brains out with it. But my old man had the third Tartar to deal with still;
and seeing he did not fly, as he expected, nor come on to fight him, as he
apprehended, but stand stock~still, the old man stood still too, and fell to
work with his tackle, to charge his pistol again; but assooa as the Tartar
saw the pistol, away he scoured, and left my pilot, my ehampion (called
him aflerwards, a complete victory.

By this time I wss a little recovered; for I thought, when I first began to
wake, that I had been in a sweet sleep; but, as -I said above, I wondered
where I was, how 1 came upon the ground, and what was the matter: out
a few moments afler, as sense returned, I felt pain, though I did not know
where; so 1 clapped my hand to my head, and took it away bloody; then I
kit my head ache; and then, in a moment, memory returned, and every
thing was present to me again. I jumped upon my feet histantly, and got
hold of my sword; but no enemies in view: I found a Tartar lie deed. and.
his hone standing ve'ry quietly by him; and, looking Earther, I saw my

coming beck with his hanger in his hand: the old men, seeing me on my
fret, come running to me, and embraced me with a great deal of joy, being
afraid before that I had been killed; and seeing me bloody, would one how
l mu hurt; but it was not much, only what we all a broken head ; neither
did I afterwards find any great inconvenience from the blow, for it mu well
again in two or three days.

We made no great gain, however, by this victory, (or we lost a cam), and
gained a horse; but that which was remarkable, when we came back to the
Village, the man demanded to be paid for the camel; Idisputed it, and it
was brought to a hearing before the Chine-e judge of the place. To give
him his due, he acted with a great deal of prudence and impartiality; and,
having heard both sides, he gravely asked the Chicano men that went with
me to buy the camel, whose servant he was t ' I am no servant; my: be,
' but went with the stranger.'---' At whose request 1' says the justice. ' At
the stranger's request; says he. ' Why then,' rays the justice, ' you were
the stranger's cement for the time; and the camel being delivered to hie
tenant, it was delivered to him, and he must pay for it.'

I confess the thing was so clear, that I had not 3 word to any; but,
admiring to tee ouch 3m reasoning upon the consequence, and an accurate
stating of the we, I paid willingly for the camel, and sent for another; but,
you may observe, I did not go to fetch it myself any more, for I had had
enough of that.

The city of Noum' is a. frontier of the Chinese empire; they call it fortified,
and so it is, as fortifications go there; for this I will venture to affirm, that
all the Tartan in Karakathay, which, I believe, are some millions, could
not hatter down the walls with their bows and arrows; but to call it strong,
it it were attacked with cannon, would be to make those who understand
it laugh at you.

We wanted, as l have said, above two days' journey of this city, when
messenger: were sent captors to every part of the road to tell all traveller:
and caravan; to halt till they had a guard rent for them; for that an unusual
body of Tartan, making ten thousand in all, had appeared in the way, about
thirty miles beyond the city.

This was very bad news to travellers; however, it was careflrlly done of
the governor, and we were very glad to hear we should have a guard.
Accordingly, two day: after, we had two hundred soldiers sent us from s
' garrison of the Chinese, on our lett. and three hundred more from the city
of Naum, and with these we advanced boldly; the three hundred soldiers
item Nauru marched in our front, the two hundred in our rear, and our men
on each side of our camels, with our baggage, and the whole caravan in the
centre; in this order, and well prepared for battle. we thought ourselves a
match for the whole ten thousand Mogul Tartan, if they had appeared; but
the next day, when they did appear, it was quite another thing

It was early in the morning, when, marching from 3 well-situated little
tows. celled Change, we had 1 river to page, which we were obliged to
ferry; 'and. had the Tartan had my intelligence, then hid been the time to
have attacked us, when the caravan being over, the rear guard was behind;
but they did not appear there. About three homo alter, when we were

entered upon a desert of about fifieen or sixteen miles over, behold, by 1 '
cloud of dust they raised, we new on enemy was at hand; and they were at - .

' hand, indeed, for they come on upon the spur.

The Chinese, our guard on the front, who had talked to big the day before,
began to dagger ; end the soldiers frequently looked behind them, which in
a certain sign in a soldier that he is juxt ready to run away. My old pilo
was of my mind; and, being near me, called out, ' Scignior lnglese,' says he,

'those fellows must be encouraged, or they will ruin us all, for if the Tartan
come on, they will never stand it.'~--- ' 1 am of your mind,' ;aid 1; ' but what
must be done? ---' Done." says he, ' let filly of our men advance, and flank
them on each wing, and entourage them; and they will fight like brave
fellows. in breve company; but, without this. they will every man turn his
back: bumedinte'ly I rode up to our leader. and told him, who was exactly
of-our mind; and accordingly filty of us marched to the right wing. and
any to the kit, and the rest made a line of reserve; and so we thatched,

'learing the last two hundred men to make a body by themselves, and to
'gnard the camels; only that, it" need were, they should send a hundred men
to assist the last fifty.

In a word the Tartar: came on, and an innumerable company they were:
how many we could not tell, but ten thousand, we thought. was the least:
a party of them came on first, and viewed our posture, traversing the ground
in the front of outline; and, as we found them within gun-shot, our lender
ordered the two wings to advance owifily, and give them a salvo on each

wing with their shot, which was done; but they went 03', and I suppose,

back, to give an account of the reception they were like to meet with; and,
indeed, that salute cloyed their stomachs, for they immediately baited, stood
I awhile to consider of it, end wheeling o&' to the left, they ga've over their
design. and said no more to us for that time; which was very agreeable to
our circumstances, which were but very indifl'erent {or a battle with such
number.

Two days after we came to the city at Noon, or Nauru; we thanked the
governor for his care of us, and collected to the value of a hundred crowns.
or met-came. which we gave to themldiero sent to guard on; and here

we rested one day. This is e gnrrison,,indeed, end there were nine hundred -

soldiers kept here; but the reason of it was, that formerly the Moscovite
frontiers lay nearer to them than they now do, the Muscovites having aban-

doned that part of the country, which lies from this city went for about two -

hundred miles, as desolate and unfit for use , and more especially being no
very remote, and so ditlicnlt to send troops thither for its defence: for we
. had yet above two thousand mile. to Memory, properly so called. .

Alter this we passed several greet rivers, and two dreadful deserts; one of

which we were sixteen any: pausing over; and which, an I said, weetohe ' I

called no man' a lend; and, on the 18th of April, we came to the frontieri of
the Miscovite dominion; I think the first town, or fortress, whuherer's

'.
may be called, that belonged to the Czar of Memory, was called Arguuz.
being on the went side of the river Argona.

I could not but discover an infinite satisfaction that I was no coon arrived
in, as I called it, a Christian country, or, at least, in a country governed by
Christians; for though the Muscorites do, in my opinion, but just deserve
the name of Christians, yet such they pretend to be, and are very devout in
their way. it would certainly occur to any man who trarels the world as I
have done. and who had any power of reflection, what a blowing it is to be
brought into the world where the name of God and a Redeemer is known,
adored, and worshipped; and not where the people, given up by Heaven to
strung delusions, worship the devil, and prostrate themselves to stock: and
etones; warship monsters, elements, horrid-shaped animals, ,end statuesor
images of mom-ten. blot a town or city we panned through but had their
pagoda, their idols, and their temples, and ignorant people worshipping even
the works of their own hands. Now we came where, at least, a face of the
Christian worship appeared; where the knee was bowed to Jesus; and,
whether ignorantly or not, yet the Christian religion was owned, and the
name of the true God was called upon and adored, and it made my soul
rejoice to see it. I saluted the brave Scots merchant I mentioned above
with my first acknowledgment of this; and taking him by the hood, I said
to him, ' Blessed be God, we are once again amongst Christiano: He smiled,
and answered, ' Do not rejoice too soon, countryman; these Muscovitee are
but an odd sort of Christians; and but for the name of it, you may see very
little of the substance for some months farther of our joumey.' ' Well,'
my: I, ' but still it is hotter than paganism and worshipping of derils.'----
' Why, Iwill tell you; says he, 'except the Russian soldiers in the gom'eons,
and a few of the inhabitants of the cities upon the road, all the rest of this
country, for above a thousand miles farther, is inhabited by the worst and
most ignorant of pagans: and so, indeed, we found it.

We were now launched into the greatest piece of solid earth, If I under-
stand any thing of the surface of the globe, that is to be found in any part
of the world: we had, at least, twelve thomond miles to the sea, eastward;
two thousand to the bottom of the Baltic sea, westward; and above three
thousand, if we left that sea and went on went, to the British and French
channels; we had (all five thousand miles to the lndian or Persian sea, south;
and about eight hundred to the Frozen sea, north. Nay, if some people
may be believed, there might be no sea, northeast, till we came round the
pole, and consequently into the north-west, and so had a continent of land
into America, the Lord knows where; though I could give some realms:
why i believe that to he e mistake.

A: we entered into the Moecovite dominion; a good while before we
came to any considemhle towns, we had nothing to observe there but this ;
lint, that all the rivers run to the east: as I understood by the charts. which
some in our caravan hid with them, it was plain all those rivers ran into the
great river Yemour. or Gamour; which river, by the neutral eonrre of it,
must run into the East sea, or Chinese ocean. The story they tell as, that
l

themonthofthisrireris chokednpwithbnlrnshesofamonsh'onsgmwth,
viz... three feet about, and twenty or thirty feet high, 1 must be allowed to
say, I believe nothing of it; but, as its navigation is of no use, because there
is no trade that way, the Tartan, to whom it alone belongs, dealing in
nothing but cattle, so nobody, that ever I heard of, has been curious enough
either to go down to the mouth of it in boats, or come up lions the month of
it in ships, as far as I can find: hot this is certain, that this river running
east, in the latitude of about filly degrees, carries a vast concourse oi rivers
along with it, and finds an <<pose to empty itsell in that latitude; so we are
sure of sea there
: Some leagues to the north of this river there are several considerable rivers,
whose streams run as due north as the Yamonr runs east, and these are all
found to join their waters with the great river Tartarns, named so from the
northernmost nations of the Mogul Tartan ; who, as the Chinese say, were
the first antars in the world; and who, as our geographers allege, are the
Gog and Magog mentioned in sacred story. These men running all north-
ward, as well as all the other rivers I am yet to speak of, make it evident
that the northern ocean bounds the land also on that side; so that it does
not seem rational, in the least. to think that the land can extend itself to
join with America on that side, or that there is not a communication between
the northern and eastern ocean: but of this I shall say no more; it was my
observation at that time, and therefore I take no notice of it in this place. .
We now advanced from the river Argona by easy and moderate journeys,
and were very visibly obliged to the care the Car of Moscovy has taken to
have cities and towns built in as many places as it is possible to place them,
where his soldiers keep garrison, something like the stationary soldiers placed
by the Romans in the remotest countries of their empire; some ot' which
that l have read of were placed in Britain, for the security ol'commerce, and
for the lodging travellers: and thus it was here; {or wherever we came,
though at these towns and stations, the garrisons and governors were Russians

and profmd Christians, yet the inhabitants were were pagans; sacrificing .

to idols, and worshipping the stun, moon, and stars, or all the host of heaven;
and not only so, but were, of all the heathens and pagans that ever I met
with, themost barbarous, except onlythat theydidnot eatmen'sfieshas
our savages of Ameriea did .

Some instanws of this we met with in the country between Argnns, where
we enter the Mmeovite dominion; and a city of- Tat-tars and Russians to
gether, called Nortfioaslty, in which' is a continued dmrt or forest, which
cost as twenty days totravel over. In avillage, near the last ofthese planes,
l had the curiosity to go and see their way of living, which so most hmt'nh
and hunfl'emblee- they had, Isnppose. a great sacrifice that day; for there
' stood out, upon an old stump ofa tree, an idol spade ofwood, frightful as
the devil; at least, as any thing we can think of to represent the devil can

world ever saw; earn as big as goats' horns, and as high , eyes as big- ". p

, crown-piece; a nose like a crooked roof I horn, and a month extended fonr'
cornered, like that of a lion, with horrible teeth, booked like a parrot's
under~bill ;-it was dressed up in the filthiest manner that you could suppose:
its upper garment was of sheep-skins, with the wool outward; a great
Tartar bonnet on the head, with two horns growing through it: it was
about eight feet high, yet had no feet or legs, nor any other proportion of
parts. deg
This scarecrow was set up at the outer side of the village; and, when I
come near to it," there were sixteen or seventeen creatures, whether men or
women I could not tell, for they made no distinction by their habits, all
laying fiat upon the ground round this formidable block of shapeless wood :
I saw no motion among them any more than if they had been all logs of
wood, like the idol, and at first I really thought they had been so; but,
when I came a little nearer, they started up upon their feet, and raised a
howling cry as if it had been so many deep-mouthed bounds, and walked
away, as if they were displeased at our disturbing them. A little way 03'
tom the idol, and at the door of a tent at but, made all of sheepskins and
cow--skins dried. stood three hatchery-*1 thought they were such, when I ,
come nearer to them, I found they had long knives' to their hands; and m
the middle of the tent appeared thre e sheep killed, and one young bullock
or steer. These, it seems, were sacrifices to that senseless log of an idol;
the three men were priests belonging to it, and the seventeen prostrated
wretcheo were the people who brought the ofl'ering, and were making their
prayers to that atoch.

l confess. I was more moved at their-stupidity and brutish worship of s
hobgobliu than ever 1 was at any thing in my life; to see God's mod glorious
~ and best creature, to whom he had granted so many advantages, even by
creation above the rest of the works of his hands, vested with a reasonable
soul, and that soul adorned with faculties and capacities adapted both to
honour his Maker and be honoured by him, sunk and degenerated to a
degreeso very stupid as to prostrate itself to a frightful nothing, a mere
Imaginary object, dressed up by themalves, and made terrible to themselves
by their own contrivanee, adorned only with clonts and rags; and that this
should be the ott'eot or mere ignorance, wrought up into hellish devotion by
the devil himself; who, enryiug to his Maker the homage and adoration 0.
his creatures, had deluded them into such sordid and brutish things as one
would think should shock nature itser

hot what signified all the astonishment and reflection of thoughts; thus it
was, and I saw it before my eyes, and there was no room to wonder at it,
or think it impossible : all my admiration turned to rage, and I rode up to
the bridge or monster, call it what you will, and with my sword made a
holiest the bonnet that was on its head, and cut it in two; and one of our
men that was with me took hold of the sheepokin that covered it, and
pulled at it; when, behold, amoat hideous outcry and howling ran through
the village, and two or three hundred people came about my ears, on that I
was glad to scour for it, for we saw some had bows and arrows: butl
resolved from that moment to visit then: again. ,
Onr caravan rested three night: at the town, which was about four miles
off, in order to provide some'hones which they wanted, cavern! of the home
having been lamed and jaded with the badoeee of the way, and long march
over the last desert; so we had name leisure here to put my design id exe-
cution. I communicated my delign to the Scots merchant of Moscow, of
whme courage I had mficient testimony: I told him what I had neon, and
with what indignation I had since thought that hnmn nature could be no '
degenerate; I told him, if I could get but flour or five men well armed to go
with me, I was resolved to go and deatroy that vile, abominable idol, and
let them nee that it had no power to help itself; and consequently could not
be an object of worship, or to he prayed to, much less help them that ofi'ered
. sacrifices to it.

He laughed at me :----aayr he, ' Your zeal may be good, but what do you
propose to yourself by it r--' Propose 1' said I, ' to vindicate the honour of
God, which' n insulted by this dovil~mhip'-- 'But how will it vindicate
the honour of God,' said he, ' while the people will not be able to know what
you mean by it, unlem you could speak to them, and tell them do? and then
they will fight you, and beat you too, I'll assure you; for they are deepen!>>
fellow, and that especially in defence of their idolatry.'--' Can we not,' said
I, 'do it in the night, and then leave them the reasons and the more: in
writing' In their own languagef-- 'Writlng!' said he, . ' why there is not o
man in five nations of them that know" any thing of a letter, or how to
read a word any way.'--' Wretched ignorance 2' mid I to him: ' however-,1
have a great mind to do it; perhaps nature may. draw inferences from it to
them, to let them nee how bmtiah they are to worship anch horrid thingn'm
' Look you, sir,' said he, ' if your zeal prompts you to it so warmly, you meet
do it; but, in the next place, I would have you consider, theae'wild nations
of people are subjected, by force, to the Czar of Murcovy's dominion, and it
~ you do this, it is ten to one but they will come by thermod- tnthe gorernor
of Nertsinkay, and demand aatiafaction; and if he cannot give them unfit
' (action, it is ten to one but they revolt; and it will occasion a dew our with
:11 the Tartar: in the country."

This, l confess, put new thought: into my head for awhile, but I harped
open the some string still; and all that day I was uneasy to put my pmject
in execution. Towards the evening the Scots merchant met me by accident _
in our walk aboutthe town. and denim! to spool: with me: '1 believe: said
he, {have put you ofl' yoargooddesign; [have heen-alitfle concerned,
about it since; for I abhor idolatry as much as you can do.' --' Truly; aaidl,

he, ' God forbid they should deliver you up to such a crew of monsters!
they shall not do that neEther; that would he murdering you indeed.'~
' Why,' and 1, 'how would they. use merm' er you? said he, 'l'lltell

with an arrow, that he could not run away: they took him and stripped
him cook-naked, and not him upon the top of the idol~mouster, and stood all
round him, and shot as many arrows into him as would stick over his whole
body; and then they burnt him, and all the arrows sticking in him, as a
sacrifice to the idol.'-~' Ami was this the some idol 7' said i. ' Yeo,' said he,
' the very some.'-' Well,' said i. 'I will tell you a story.' So 1 related the
story of our men at Madagascar, and how they burnt and sacked the village
there, and killed man, woman, and child. for their murdering one of our
men, just as it is related before; and I added, that I thought we ought to
do so to this village.

lie listened very attentively to the story; but when I talked of doing so
to that village, said he, ' You mistake very much; it was not this village, it
was almost a hundred miles from this place; but it was the same idol, for
they carry him about in procession all over the country.'--' Well,' said i,
' then that idol ought to be punhhed {or it; and it shall; said l.' if I live
this night out.'

In a want, finding me resolute, he liked the design, and told me I should
not go alone, but he would go with me, but he would go first, and bring a
stout (mow, one of his countrymen, to go also with us; ' and one; said he,
' as famous for his zeal us you can desire any one to be agnth such devilish
things as these.' In a word, he brought me his comrade, a Scotsman, whom
he called Captain Richardson; and I gave him a hill account of what i had
seen, and also what I intended; and he told me readily, he would go with
on: if it cost him his life. So we agreed to go, only we three. Iliad, indeed:
proposed it to my partner, but he declined it. He said, he was ready to
assist me to the utmost, and upon all occasiona, for my defence; but this was
an adventure quite out of his way; so, I say, we resolved upon our work.
only we three and my man-servant, and to put it in execution that night
about midnight, with all the secrecy imaginable.

However, upon second thoughts, we were willing to delay it till the next
night, because, the caravan being to set forward in the morning, we supposed

the governor could not pretend to give them any satisfaction upon or when '

we were out of his power. The Scots merchant, as steady in his resolution
for the enterprise as hold in executing, brought me a Tartar's robe or gown
of sheep's skins, and a bonnet, with a bow and arrows, and had provided the
same for himself and his countryman, that the people, if they sow us, should
not determine who we were.

All the first night we spent in mixing up some combustible matter with
aqua vitae, gunpowder, and such other materials as we could get; and, having
a good quantity of tar in a little pot, about an hour afler night We set out
upon our expedition.

We came to the place about eleven o'clock at night, and found that the
people had not the least jealousy of danger attending their idol. The night
was cloudy; yet the moon gave no light enough to see that the idol stood
just in the same posture and place that it did before. The people seemed to
be all at their test; only, that in the great hut, or tent, on we called it;

'<<r'v
wherewesswthethneoriestswhomwe mistook the butchers, we saw a
light, ' and, going up close to the door, we heard people talking in if there
were five or six of them , we condoded, therefore, that if we set wildfire to

them we knew not. Once we thought of carrying it any sod setting tire
to it at s. distance, but when we came to hsndle it, we found it too bulky for
our carriage; so we were at a loss again. The second Scotsman was'for
setting the to the tent or hut, and knocking the creatures that were there on
the head, when they came out; but! could not join with that; I was against
killing them, if it were possible to avoidit. ' Well, then; said the Scots ,
merchant, ' I will tell you what we will do: we will try to make them-

prisoners, tie their heads, and make them stand and see their idol destroyed. '

As it happened, we had twine or packihread enough shout us. which we
used to tie our firelocks together with; so we resolved to attack these people
first, and with as little noise as we could. The first thing we did. we.
knocked at the door, when, one of the priests coming to it, we immediately
seized upon him, stopped his mouth and tied his hands behind him, and led
him to the idol, where we gagged him that he might not make s noise, tied
his feet also together, and left him on the ground.

Two of us then waited at the door, expecting that snotherrwould come
out, to see what the matter was; but we waited so long till the third man
came heel: to us 5 and then, nobody coming out, we knocked again gently,
and immediately out come two more, and we'sersed them just in' the some

Alter the feat was performed, we appeared in the morning among our
fellow travellers, exceedingly busy in getting ready for our journey; nor
could any man suggest that we had been any where but in our bode, as
travellers might be supposed to be, to [it themselves {or the fatigue: of the
day a journey.

But the affair did not end so, the next day came a great number of the
country people to the <<Integrates, and m a most outrageous manner demanded
satisfaction of the Russian governor for the insulting their priests, and burn-
ing their great Cham Chi-Thnungu. The people of Nertsiuskay were at
first in a great consternation. for they said the Tartar; were already no less
than thirty thousand strong. The Russian 'governor sent out messengers to
appease them, and gave them all the good word: imaginable ; assuring them
that he knew nothing of it, and that there ha! not a soul in his garrison
been abroad. so that it could not be from any body there; but if they could
let him know who did it, they should be exemplarily punished. They re-
turned haughtily that all the country revereneed the great Cham Chi.
Thaungu, who dwelt in the sun, and no mortal would have dared to ofl'er
violence to his image but some Chriatian miecreant; and they therefore
revolved to denounce war against him and all the Russians, who, they mid,
were miscreants and Christians.

The governor, still patient, and unwilling>> make a breach, or to have
any cause of war alleged to be given by him, the car hevmg etzictly charged
them to treat the conquered country with gentleness and civility, gen them
still all the good words he could 4t last he told them there was aormran

had done them thin injury: and that it they-would be minded with tint. he
would send otter'them to inquire into it. This seemed to appease them '3
little; and accordingly the governor {rend alter or, and gave or a particular
account how the thing was; intimating withol, that if any in our caravan
hed'aone it, they should make their escape; but that whether we had done
it or no, we should make all the haste forward that was pomible; and that,
In the mean time, lie would keep them in play as long so he could.

This was very friendly in the governor; however, when it come to the
caravan, there one nobody knew any thing of the matter; and as for or that
were guilty, we were least of all suspected. However. the captain of the
conven for the time took the hint. that the governor gave on, and we travel-
led taro days end two nights without any cousidernhle stop, and then we lay
at a village called Plothns: nor did we make my long stop here. but
hastened on towards Jarawene, another of the Czar of Moscow's colo-
niee, and where we expected we should he rate. But upon the second day's
march from Plothus, by the clouds of dust hehind us at a great distance,
some of our people began to be sensible we were pursued We had entered
a great desert, and had panned by a great lake celled Schultz Our, when we
peree'IVed a very great body of homappear on the other ride ot'jhe lake, to
the north, we travelling west. We observed they Went away west, as we
did, but had supposed we would have taken that side of the lake, whereas
we very happily took the south side; and in two days there they disappeared
again z't'or they believing we were still before them, pushed on till they
came to the river Udda, a very great river when it passes farther north, but
when we came to it we found it narrow and fordable.

The third day, they had either found their mistake, or her! intelligence of
no. and came pouring in upon no towards the dealt of the evening. We lied,
to our great satisfaction, just pitched npone place for our camp. which was
very convenient for the night; for, as we were npon a desert, though but 1t
the beginning of it, that was above five hundred miles over, we had no
towns to lodge at, and, indeed, expected none but the city Janwenn, which
we had yet two days march to; the daert. however, had some few woods
in it on this side, and little rivers, which ran all into the great river Uddegl
it wee in a narrow strait, between little, but very thick woods, that we
pitched our little camp for that night, expecting to be attacked before
morning.

In this posture we encamped for the night; but the enemy was upon us
helbre we had finished our situation. They did not come on us like thieves,
as we expected, but sent three messengers to us, to demand the men to he
delivered to them that had abused their priests, and burned their god Chum
Chi-Thaungu with fire, that they might burn them with fire; and upon this,
they said, they would go away, and do us no farther harm, otherwise they
would destroy us all. Our meu looked very blank at this message, and began
to stare at one another, to see who looked with the 'most guilt in their faces:
but, nobody was the word; nobody did it. The leader of the caravan sent
word he was well assured that it was not done by any of our camp; that we
were peaceable merchants, travelling on our business; that we had done no
harm to them or to any one else; and that, therefore, they must look farther
for their enemies who had injured them, for we were not the people; so de-
sired them not to disturb us, for, it' they did, we should defend ourselves.

They were far from being satisfied with this for an answer; and a great
crowd of them came running down in the morning, by break of day, to our
camp; but seeing as in such an unaccountable situation, they durst come no
farther than the brook in our front, where they stood, and shewed us such a.
number that indeed terrified us very much; for those that spoke least of
them spoke often thousand. Here they stood and looked at us awhile, and
then, setting up a great howl, they let fly a cloud of arrows among us; but
we were well enough fortified for that, for we sheltered under our baggage,
and I do not remember that one of us was hurt.

Some time after this, we saw them move a little to our right, and expected
them on the rear; when a cunning fellow, a Cossack of Jaraweua, in the
pay of the Muscavites, calling to the leader of the caravan, said to him, 'l'll
go send all these people away to Siheilliaf this was a city four or five days'
journey, at least, to the right, and rather behind us. So he takes his bow
and arrows, and, getting on horseback, he rides away from our rear directly,
as it were back to Nertsinska; afler this, he takes a great circuit about, and
comes directly on the army of the Tartan, as i! he had been sent express to
tell them a long story, that the people who had burnt the Chain Chi-
Thanngu were gone to Sihcilka, with a caravan of miscreants, as he called
them, that is to say, Christians; and that they had resolved to burn the god.
SChaI-lsar, belonging to the Tongueees.

As this fellow was himself a mere Tartar, and perfectly spoke their lan.
guage; he counterfeited so well, that they all took it from him, and away
they drove in a most violent hurry to Siheilks, which, it seems. was five
days' journey to the north: and in less than three hours they were entirely
out of our sight, and we never heard any more of them, nor whether they
went to Siheilka or no. So we passed away safely on to Jarawena, where
there was a garrison of Muscovites, and there we rested tire days, the
caravan being exceedingly fatigued with the last day's hard march. and with
Want of rest in the night.

From this city we had a frightful desert, which held as twenty-three days'
march. We furnished ourselves with some tents here, for the better accom-
.modating ourselves an the night; and the leader of the caravan procured
sixteen carriages, or waggons of the country, for carrying our wateror
provisions; and these carriages were our defence, every night, round one
little camp; sothat had the Tartsrs appeared, unless.they had been very
numerous indeed, they would not have been able to hurt ns.

We may well be supposed to want rest again alter this long journey; for
in this desert we neither saw house nor tree, and scarce a bush; though we
saw abundance of the sable hunters, who are all Tartar-s of the Mogul
Tartary, of which this country '3 a part; and they' frequently attack small
caravans, but we saw no numbers ofthem together.

Afier we had passed this desert, we came into a country pretty well inha-
bited; that is to say, we found towns and castles, settled by the Cairo!
Muscovy, with garrbons of stationary soldiers, to protect the wavans, and
defend the country against the Tartan, who would otherwise make it very
dangerous travelling; and his czarish majesty has given such strict orders
for the well guarding the caravans and merchants, that, if there are any
Tar-tars heard of in the country, detachments of the garrisona are always
sent to see the travellers safe from station tostation. And thus the governor
of Adinslroy, whom I had an opportunity to make a visit to,' by means of the
Scots merchant, who was acquainted'with him, ofl'ered us a guard of fifty
men, if we thought there was any danger, to the next station.

I thought, long before this, that as we came nearer to Europe we should
find the country better inhabited. and the peOple more civilized; but! found
myself mistaken in both; for we had yet the nation of the Tongueses to pass

through, where we saw the same tokens of paganism and barbarity as before; .

only, as they were conquered by the Muscovites, they were not so dan-
gerous; but for rudeness of manners, and idolatry, no people in the world
ever went beyond them; they are clothed all in skins of beasts, and their
houses are built of the same; you know not a man from a woman, neither
by the ruggedness of their countenances nor their clothes; and in the winter,
when the ground is covered with snow, they live under-ground in vaults,
which have cavities going from one to another.

If the Tartan had their Chan: Chi-Thauugu for a whole village or codntry
these had idols in every hut and every cave: besides, they worship the" stars",
the sun, the water, the snow, and, rn a word, every thing they do not under.
stand, and they understand but very little; so that every element, every
uncommon thing, sets them a sacrificing. I met with nothing peculiar to
myself in all this country, which I reckon was, from the desert I spoke of last,
at least four hundred miles, half of it being another desert, which took us up
twelve days' severe travelling, without house or tree; and we were--obliged
again to can-your own provisions, as'vvell water as bread. Alter we were
out of this desert, and had travelled two days, we came toJane'my, a Mu-
eovite city or tuition on the great river Janeeay, which, they told as M.
parted Europe from Asia.

Jammy is or entirely pagan, ind the people as barbarous, as the remote-t
ot' the Tartar-s; nay, .1: any nation. for ought I know, in Asia or Alum-ion.
I also found, which I observed to the Muscovite governors whom! had an
opportunity to converse with, that the poor pagans are not much wiser, or
nearer Christianity, for being under the Mosoovite government, which they
acknowledged was true enough; but that, as they said, was none of their
business; that if the czar expected to convert his Siberian, Touguece, or
Tartar subjects, it should he done by sending clergymen among them, not
soldiers : and. they added with more sincerity than Iexpected. that they
found it was not so much the concern of their monarch to make the people
Christians as it was to make them subjects.

From this river to the great river Oby, we crowed a wild uncultivated
country, barren of people and good management, otherwise it is in itself '3
most pleasant, fruitful, and agreeable country. What inhabitants we found
in it are all pagans, except such as are sent among them from Rustic: for
this is the country, i mean on both sides the river Oby, whither the Mus
covite criminals that are not put to death are banished. and from whence it
is next to impossible they should ever come away.

I have nothing material to say of my particular attain till I came to
Tobolski. the capital city of Siberia, where! continued some time on the
follomng occasion.

We had now been almost seven months on onrjaoroey, and winter began
to come on <<pace; whereupon my partner and I coiled a council about our
particular afl'airs, in which we found it proper, as we were bound for Eng: '
land, and not for Moscow, to consider how to dispose of ourselves. They
told no of sledge: and rein-deer to carry us over the snow in the winter-time;
and, indeed, they have such things that it would be incredible to relate the .
particulars of, by which means the mm: travel more in the winter than
they can in summer, as in these sledge: they are able to run night and day;
the snow being frozen, is one universal covering to nature. by which the
hilt, valet, rivers, and lakes, are all smooth and hard as a stone, and they
run upon the surface, without any regard to what is underneath.

But I had no occasion to push at a winter journey of this kind; 1 was
bound to England, not to Moscow, and my route lay two ways; either I
must go on as the caravan went, till I came to Jnroslaw, and then go 03'
west for Nerve, and the gulf of Finland and so to Dantzic, where I might
possibly cell my China cerg'o togood advantage 5 or 1 must leave the caravan
at a little town on the Onion from whence I had but six days by waterto
Archangel, and from thence might be sure of shipping either to England,
Holland. or Hamburgh.

Now. to go any of these journeys in the winter wonid have been pre-
posterous: for as to Dautzic, the Baltic would have been frozen up, and I
could not get wage; and to go by land in those countries was far tar safe
than aniong the Mogul Tartan; likewise, to go to Archangel in October,
all the ships would be gone from thence, and even the merchants who dwell
' there in summer retire conth to Moscow in the winter. when the ships are
gone: so that! could have nothing but extremity of cold to encounter.
with a scarcity ofprovisions, and must lie in an empty town all the winter .
so that, upon the whole, I thought it much my bettef way to let the caravan
go, and make provision to winter where I was, at Tobolslti, m Siberia, in
'tho latitude of about sixty degrees, where I was sure of three thingsto wear
out a cold winter with, viz, plenty of provisions. such as the country
afl'ortled, a warm house, with fuel enough, and excellent company.

lwas now in a quite difi'erent climate from my beloved island. where I

never felt cold, except when I had my ngue , on the contrary, I had much
to do to hear any clothes on my hack, and never made any fire but without
doors, which was necessary for droning my food. Sec. Now I made me
-three good rests, with large robes or gowns over them, to hang down to
the feet, and button close to the wrists; and all these lined with furs, to
make them sulliciently warm.

As to a worm house. I must confess I greatly disliked our way in England,.
of making fires in every room in the house in open chimneys, which, when
the fire was out, always kept the air in the room cold as the climate; but
taking an apartment to a good house in the town, I ordered s chimney to be
built like a furnace, in the hentre of six. several rooms. like sstove; the
fimuel to carry the moire went up one way, the door to come at the tire
went in another, and all the rooms were kept equally warm, but no lire
seen, just as they beat the bagnios in England. By this means, we had al-
ways the same climate in all the rooms, and an equal heat was preserved;
and how cold eosver it was without, it was always warm within, and yet
we new no tire, nor were ever incommoded with smoke.

The most wonderful thing of all was, that it should be possible to meet I.

with good company here, in a country so barbarous as that of the most
northerly ports of Europe, near'the frozen ocean, within but a very few
degrees of-Nova Zembla. But this being the country where the state crimi-
nals of Masonry, as I observed before. are all banished, this city was full of
noblemen, gentlemen, soldiers. and oourtiers of M nseory. Here was the
famous prince Gallitziu, the old general Robostiski, and several other per--
sons of note, and some ladies. By means of my Scots merchant, whom,
nevertheless, I parted with here. I made an acquaintance with" seven! of
there gentlemen; and from these,' in the long winter nights in which I staid
here, I mired several very agreeable visits.

ltwas talking one night with prince m--m--s "one of the banished ministers
ofshate belonging to the Czar of Moscow, that the discourse of my portion-

lat-use began. He had been telling me abundance offine things ofthe '

greatness, the magnificence, the dominion; and the absolute p'ower tithe
emperor of the Russians: I hiterrupted him, and told him I was a greater
and more powerful prince than even the Czar of Museovy was, though my
dominion: were not so large, or my people so many. The Russian grandee

looked a little surprised. and fixing his eyes steadily upon we, began to'
wonder what! meant. I told him his wonder would cease when i had ext:

that they would all light for me to the last drop; and that never tyrant, for
such 1 acknowledged myself to be, was ever so universally beloved, and yet
so horribly feared by his subjects.

After amusing him with these riddles in government for awhile. I opened
the case, and told him the story at large of my living in the inland; and
how I managed both myself and the people that were under me, just-es 1
have since wanted it down. They were exceedingly taken with the story,
and especially the prince, who told me, with a sigh, that. the true greatness
of life was to be masters. of ourselves; that he would not have exchanged
such a. state of life as mine to be Car of Muscovy; and that he found more
felicity in the retirement he seemed to be banished to there, than ever he
found in the highest authority he enjoyed in the courtot' his master the ear;
that the height of human wisdom waste bring our tempers down to our

as well as round him, to things without: that he found the mind of man. if

afi'ections, such as our ambition, our particular pride, avarice, vanity, and

It is true, within doors we were warm, the houses being close, the walls

flesh of deer, dried and cured in the season; breed good enough, but baked
as biscuit>>; dried fish of several aorta, and some flesh of mutton and M' the
buffaloes. which is pretty good meat. All the store. of provisions for the
winter are laid up in the summer, and well cured: our drink was water,
mixed with aqua vitae instead of brandy; and, for a treat, mead instead of
wine, which, however, they have excellent good. The hunters, who ven-

cheerfully and well, all things considered.

at least tolerable; so the other travellers began to prepare oledgeo to carry

people who are banished hither. We are surrounded with stronger things
than bars or bolts; on the north side on unnavigable ocean, where ohip

go on. lwao. I confess, astonished at the thing aswell as at thelman, and I
used some. arguments with him to urge him to set himself free; that he
ought to look upon this as a door Opened by Heaven for his deliverance, and
a summons by Providence, who has the care and disposition of all events, to
do himself good, and to render himself useful in the world.

He had by this time recovered himself: ' How do you know; uir,' says he,
wannly. ' but that instead of a summons from Heaven, it may be a {hint of
another instrument; representing in alluring colours to me the show' of
felicity as a deliverance, which may in itself be my more, sod tend directly
to my ruin ? Here lam free from the temptation of returning to my former
miserable greatness; there i am not sure but that all the seeds of pride,
ambition, avarice, and luxury, which 1 know remain in nature, may revive
and-take root, and, in a word, again overwhelm me; and then the happy
prisoner, whom you see now master of his soul's liberty, shall he the miser-
able slave of his cum senses, in the full of all personal liberty. Dear sir, let
me remain in this blessed confinement, banished from the crimes of life,

then. I fear, quickly lose sight of; for I am but flesh; a man, a mere man;
have passions and afi'octimu as likely to possess and overthrow me as any
man: 0 be not my friend and tempter both together !'

If i was surprised before, I was quite dumb now, and stood silent, looking
at him. and, indeed, admiring what I saw. The struggle iu'his soul was so
great, that though the weather was extremely cold, it put him into a inoet
violent sweat, and 1 found he wanted to give vent to his mind ; so I said a.
word or two, that lawould leave him to consider of it, and wait on him
again. and then I witudrew to my own apartment. .

About two hours idler, [ heard somebody at or near thedoorof my roam,
and I was going to open the door, but he had opened it, and came in. ' My
dear friend,' says he, ' you had almost overset me, but I am recovered. a Do
not take it ill that I do not close with your ofi'er; I assure you it is not for

I had nothing to do but to acquiesce, and make professions to him of my
having no end in it but a sincere desire to serve him. He embraced me very
passionately, and moved inc he was sensible of that, sod should always .
acknowledge it; and with that he offered me a very fine present of tables,

the way was very deep in some places. and very uneven in others; the best
we had to say for it was, that we thought we had no troops of Tartan or
robbers to fear, and that they never came of this side the river Oby, or, at
least. but very seldom; but we found it otherwise.

M y young lord had a faithful Siberian servant, who was perfectly
acquainted with the country, and led us by private roads, so that we avoided
coming into the principal towns and cities upon the great read, one): as

of, that he would not allow us to lie abroad when we came to several cities
on the way, but lay abroad himlf, with his servant, in the woods, and met

wounded several others, as also several of their horses; for we had all of us
loaded our pieces with two or three bullets at least.
. They were terribly surprised with our fire, and retreated immediately

about one hundred rods from us, in which time we loaded our pieces again.
and seeing them keep that distance, we rallied out, and eatehed four or five
of their homes, whose riders we supposed were killed: and coming up to
the dead, we judged they were Tar-tars, but knew not how they came to
make an excursion such an unusual length.

We slept little, you may be sure. but spent the most 'part of the night in
. strengthening our sitsstioo, and harsicadiug the entrances into the wood,
and keepinga strict watch. We waited for daylight. and when it came, it
' gave us a very unwelcome discovery," indeed; for the enemy, who we thought
were dmconraged with the reception they met with, were now greatly
increased, and had set up eleven or twelve huts or tents, as if they were
resolved to besiege us; and this little camp they had pitched upon the open
plain, about three quarters of a mile from no. We were, indeed, mrprised
at this discovery; and now, I confess. I gave myself over for losh'snd all that
I had; the loss of my effects did not lie so near me, though very consider-
able, as the thoughts of falling into the hands of such barbarians, at the latter
end of my journey, sfier so many 'difliculties and hazards as 1 had gone
through, and even in sight of our port, where we expected safety and deli-
verance. As to my partner, he was raging, and declared that to lose ht. -
fgoods would be his min, and that he would rather die than bestowed; and

he Was flit fighting to the last drop.

The young lord, a gallant youth, was for fighting to the last also; and my
old pilot was of the opinion we were able to resist them all in the situation
we'were then in; and'thns we spent the day in dehata of what we almnld
do: but. towards evening we found that the number of our enemies still
increased, and we did not know but by the morning the" might still be a
greater number; so I began to inquire of those people we had brought from
Tobolski, if there were no private ways, by which we might avoid then: in
the night, and perhaps retreat to some town, or get help to guard us over
the desert. The Siberian, who was servant to the young lord, hold us, if we
designed to avoid theirs, and not fight, he would engage tour-r3 us ofi' in
the night, to a way that went north, towards the river Petmn, hy' which he
made no question but we might get away, and the Tartan never the wiser .
but, he said, his lord had told him he would not retreat, but would rather
choose to fight. I told him hemistook his, lord for that he was too wise.-
man to love fighting for the sake of it ; that I knew his lord was brave

V enough, by what he had showed already; but that his lord knew better
