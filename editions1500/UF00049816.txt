1882PREFACE.

 

I HE production of a book which is adapted to the
use of the youngest readers needs but few words
of excuse or apology. The nature of the work
seems to he sutlieiontly explained lty the title it-
self, and the author's task has heen chiefly to
reduce the ordinary language into words of one syllahle, But

 

although, as far as the sulject, matter is concerned, the hook can
lay no claims to originality, it is believed that the idea and
scope of its construction are entirely novel, for the One Syllahle
literature of the present day furnishes little more than a few short,
unconnected sentences, and those chiefly in spelling hooks.

The deep interest which be l'oe's story has never failed to
arouse in the minds of the young, induces the author to hope
that. it may he acceptable in its present form.

It should he stated that oxeeptinns to the rule of using
words of one syllnhlc exclusively have lnct-n made in the case of
the proper names of the hoy Xury and of the man Friday, and
in the titles of the illustrations that accompany this work.IN WORDS OF ONE SYLLA BLE.

WAS born at York on the first of March
- in the sixth year of the reign of King
' 1? Charles the First. From the time when I
_ was quite a young child, I had felt a great

wish to spend my life at sea, and as I
grew, so did this taste grow more and more
strong; (ill at last I broke loose from my school and
home, and found my way on foot to Hull, where I soon
get a place on board a ship.

When we had set sail but a few days, a squall
of wind came on, and on the fifth night we sprang a
leak. All hands were sent to the pumps, but we felt
the ship groan in all her planks, and her beams quake
from stem to stern; so that it was seen quite clear
there was no hope for her, and that all we could do
was to save our lives.

The first thing was to fire off guns, to show that we
were in need of help, and at length a ship, which lay
not far from us, sent a boat to our aid. But the sea
was too rough for it to lie near our ship's side, so we
threw out a rope, which the men in the boat caught,
and made fast, and by this means we all got in.
Still, in so wild a sea it was in vain to try to get on
board the ship which had sent out the men, or to use
our oars in the boat, and all we could do was to let it
drive to shore.

In the space of half an hour our own ship struck on
a rock and went down, and we saw her no more. We
made but slow way to the land, which we caught sight
of now and then when the boat rose to the top of some
high wave, and there we saw men who ran in crowds,
to and fro, all bent on one thing, and that was to
save us.

At last to our great joy we got on shore, where we
had the luck to meet with friends who gave us the
means to get back to Hull; and if Ihad now had the
good sense to go home, it would have been well for me.

The man whose ship had gone down said with a
grave look, " Young lad, you ought to go to sea. no
more, it is not the kind of life for you." Why sir, will
you go to sea no more then ?" "That is not the same
kind of thing; I was bred to the sea, but you were not,
and came on board my ship just to find out what a
life at sea was like, and you may guess what you will
come to if you do not go back to your home. God
will not bless you, and it may be that you have brought
all this woe on us." .

I spoke not a word more to him; which way he went
I knew not, nor did I care to know, for I was hurt at
this rude speech. Shall I go home thought I, or shall
I go to sea? Shame kept me from home, and I could
not make 11p my mind what conise of life to take.

As it has been my fate tlnoun'h life to choose l'ol the
1101st, so I (lid now. I had gold 111 my purse and good
clothes 011 my back, and to sea I 11 out on( o more

But I had worse luck this time than the last, for when
we were far out at sea, some Turks in a small ship 6111110
on our t1 111: k in full chase We set as much sail 11s 0111'

'1'11ds 11 011111 heal. so as to net cle1'u fiom them. But
in spite ot this, we saw our afoes 01111 on us, and we
lelt sule that they would come 11p with our ship in a
few hours time.

At last they aught 11s but we ln'olrrlit 0111 guns to
hear 011 them, which made them she1n oil fin a time,
yet they kept 11p a fire at 11s as long as they new in
range. The next time the Turks came up, some of
their men got 011 board 0111' ship, and set to work to
cut the sails, and do us all kinds of harm. So, 11s ten
of our men lay dead, and most of the rest had wounds,
we gave in

The (hief 0f the kas took me as his prize to a port
which was held by the Moms. He (lid not use me so
ill as at first I thon<rht he 11 ould l1a1e done, but he set
me to 110111 with the rest of his slaves. This was a
change in my life which Idid not think had been in
store for me. How my heart. sank with grief at the
thought of those whom I had left at home, nay, to
whom I had not had the grace so much as to say
"Good bye" when I went to sea, nor to give a hint of
what I meant to do!

Yet all that I went through at this time was but a
taste of the toils and cares which it has since been my
lot to hear.

I thought at first that the Turk might take me with
him when next he went to sea, and so I should find
some way to get free; but the hope did not last long,
for at such times he left me on shore to see to his crops.
This kind of life I led for two years, and as the Turk
knew and saw more of me, he made me more and more
free. He went out in his boat once or twice a week to
catch a kind of flat fish, and now and then he took me
and a boy with him, for we were quick at this kind of
sport, and he grew quite fond of me.

One day the Turk sent me in the boat to catch some
fish, with no one else but a man and a boy. While we
were out, so thick a fog came on, that though we were
not half a mile from the shore, we quite lost sight of it
for twelve hours; and when the sun rose the next day,
our boat was at least ten miles out at sea. The wind
blew fresh, and we were all much in want of food, but
at last, with the help of our ears and sail, we got back
safe to land.

When the Turk hearo how we had lost our way, he
said that the next time he went out, he would take a
boat that would hold all we could want if we were kept
out at sea. So he had quite a state room built in the
long boat of his ship, as well as a room for us slaves.
One day he sent me to trim the boat, as he had two
friends who would go in it to fish with him. But when
the time came they did not go, so he sent me with the
man and the hey--whose name was Xury--to catch
some fish for the guests that were to sup with him.

Now the thought struck me all at once that this
would be a good chance to set off with the boat, and
get tree. So in the liist place, 1 took all the food that
I could lay my hands on, and I told the man that it
would he too hold of 11s to eat of the bread that had
been put in the boat for the 'I'urk. He said he thought
so too, and he brought down a small sack of rice and
some rusks.

While the man was on shore I put up some wine, a
large lump of wax, a saw, an axe, a spade, some rope,
and all sorts of things that might be of use to us. I
knew where the 'I'urk's case of wine was, and I put that
in the boat while the man was 011 shore. By one more
trick I got all that I had need of. I said to the boy,
"the 'I'urk's unsg me in the boat, but there is no shot.
Do you think you could get some? You know where
it is kept. and we may want to shoot a fowl or two
So he brought a case and a pouch which held all that
we could want for the guns. These I put in the boat,
and then set sail out of the port to fish.

The wind blew from the North, or North West, which
was a had wind for me; for had it been South, I could
have made for the coast of Spain. But, blow which
way it might, my mind was made up to get off, and to
leave the rest to fate. I then let down my lines to fish,
but I took care to have bad sport; and when the fish
bit, I would not pull them up, for the Moor was not to
see them. Isaid to him, "This will not do, we shall
catch no fish here, we ought to sail on a bit." Well,
the Moor thought there was no harm in this. He set
the sails, and, as the helm was in my hands, I ran the
boat out a mile or more, and then brought her to, as
if I meant to fish.

"Now, thought I, the time has come for me to get
free! I gave the helm to the boy. and then took the
Moor round the waist, and threw him out of the boat.

Down he went! but soon rose up, for he swam like
a. duck. He said he would go all round the world with
me, it'I would but take him in.

I had some fear lest he should climb up the boat's
Side, and force his way back; so I brought my gun to
point at him, and said, "You can swim to land with
ease if you choose, make haste then to get there; but if
you come near the boat you shall have a shot through
the head, for I mean to be a free man from this hour."

He then swam for the shore, and no doubt got safe
there, as the sea was so calm.

At firstI thought Iwould take the Moor with me,
and let Xury swim to land; but the Moor was not a
man that I could trust.
When he was gone I said to Xury, "If you will
swear to be true to me, you shall be a great man in
time; if not, I must throw you out of the boat too."

The poor boy gave me such a sweet smile as he
swore to be true to me, that I could not find it in my
heart to doubt him.

While the man was still in View (for he was on his
way to the land), we stood out to sea with the boat, so
that he and those that saw us from the shore, might
think we had gone to the straits" mouth, for no one
went to the South coast, as a tribe of men dwelt there
who were known to kill and eat their foes.

W c then bent our course to the East, so as to keep in
with the shore; and as we had a fair wind and a smooth
sea, by the next day at noon, we were not less than
150 miles out of the reach of the Turk.

I had still some fear lest I should be caught by the
Moors, so I would not go on shore in the day time.
But when it grew dark we made our way to the coast,
and came to the mouth of a stream, from which we
thought we could swim to land, and then look round
us. But as soon as it was quite dark we heard strange
sounds--barks, roars, grunts, and howls. The poor
lad said he could not go on shore till dawn. "' Well,"
said I, " then we must give it up, but it may be that in
the day time we shall be seen by men, who for all we
know would do us more harm than wild beasts." "Then
we give them the shoot gun," said Xury with a laugh,
H

"and make them run away. I was glad to see so much
mirth in the boy, and gave him some bread and rice.

We lay still at night, but did not sleep long, for in a
few hours' time some huge beasts came down to the
sea to bathe. The poor boy shook from head to foot
at the sight. One of these beasts came near our boat,
and though it was too dark to see him well, we heard
him puff and blow, and knew that he must be a large
one by the noise he made. At last the brute came as
near to the boat as two oal's' length, so I shot at him,
and he swam to the shore.

The rear and cries set up by beasts and birds at the
noise of my gun would seem to show that we had made
a bad choice of a place to land 011; but be that as
it would, to shore we had to go to find some fresh
spring, so that we might fill our casks. Xury said if
I would let him go with one of the jam, he would
find out if the splings were fit. to drink; and, if they
were 311 eet he 11 euld bling the ja1 back full. " Whv
should you go. 7" said I; " W 11 ' should not I go, and
you stay in the boat. 9" At this X11111 said, " 1f 11 11d
mans come they eat 1110, you go way. ' I could not
but le1e the lad for this kind speech. "Well," said I,
"we will both go, and if the wild men come we must
kill them, they shall not eat you or me."

I gave Xury some rum from the 'I'111k's case to chccl
him up, and 11c 11 cut on shore. The boy went ofl 111th
his gun, full a mile from the spot where we stood, and
came back with a hare that he had shot, which'we
were glad to cook and eat; but the good news which
he brought was that he had found a spring, and had
seen no wild men.

I made a guess that the Cape de Verd Isles were
not far oil, for I saw the top of the Great Peak, which
I knew was near them. My one hope was that if I
kept near the coast, I should find some ship that would
take us on board; and then, and not till then, should I
feel a free man. In a word, I put the whole of my
late on this chance, that I must meet with some ship,
01' die.

()n the coast we saw some men who stood to look
at 11s 'I'I1e3 \1010 black, and 11010 no clothes. I would
l1a1e gone on shore to them, but Xlu'y --11ho knew best
--said, "Not youo 1>0! Not you 1,30!" So I blought
the boat as near the land as I could, that I might talk
to them, and they kept up with me a long way. I saw
that one of them had a lance 111 his hand.

I made signs that they should bi'in1.3 me some food,
and they on their part made signs fm me to stop my
boat. So I let down the top of my sail, and 1113 by,
while two of them 11111 oil; and in less than half an hour
they came back 111th some d1'3' meat and a sort of corn
which is 13101111 in this part of the \\'()ll.(I This we
should lia1e been glad to get, but knew not how to
do so; for we (hast not go 011 shore to them, 1101' did
they dare to come to us.
At last they took a safe way for us all, for they
brought the food to the shore, where they set it down,
and then went a long way off while we took it in. We
made signs to show our thanks, for we had not a thing
that we could spare to give them.

But as good luck would have it, we were at hand
to take a great prize for them; for two wild beasts, of
the same kind as the first I spoke of, came in full chase
from the hills down to the sea.

They swam as if they had come for sport. The men
flew from them in fear, all but the one who held the
lance. One of these beasts came near our boat; so I
lay in wait for him with my gun; and as soon as the
brute was in range, I shot him through the head. 'l'wice
he sank down in the sea, and twice he came up; and
then just swam to the land, where he fell down dead.
The men were in as much fear at the sound of my gun,
as they had been at the sight of the beasts. But when
I made signs for them to come to the shore, they took
heart, and came.

They at once made for their prize; and by the help
of a rope, which they slung round him, they brought
him safe on the beach.

We now left our wild men, and went on and on, for
twelve days more. The land in front of us ran out
four or live miles, like a bill; and we had to keep some
way from the coast, to make this point, so that we lost
sight of the shore.
I gave the helm to Xuly and sat down to think what
would be my best course to take: when all at once I
hemd the lad cry out "A ship with a sail! A ship with
a sail !" He did not show much joy at the sight, for
he thought that this ship had been sent out to take
him back: but I knew well, from the look of her, that
she was not one of the Turks

I made all the sail I could to come in the ship's way,
and told Xury to the a gun, in the hope that if those
011 deck could not heal the sound, they milrht see the
smoke. This they did see, and then let down their
sails so that we might come up to them, and in three
hours time we were at the ship's side. The men spoke
to us in French, but I could not make out what they
meant. At last 2). Scot on board said in my own tongue,
" Who are you? Whence do you come ?" I told him
in a few words how I had got free from the Moms.

Then the man 11110 had eha11'e of the ship bade me
come 011 bomd, and took me in 111th Xuiy and all my
goods. I told him that he might take all I had, b1it
he said "You shall ha1e yourb Dwoods back when we
come to land, for I have but done for you what ya
would have done for me, had I been in the same
plight."

He ga1e me a good 1ound sum {'01 my boat, and
said that I should brha1e the same sum f01 X111y, if I
would pait with him. But I told him that as it "as by
the boy's help that I had got fi'ee, I was loath to sell
him. He said it was just and right in me to feel thus,
but at the same time, if I could make up my mind to
part with him, he should be set free in two yeais' time.
So, as the poor slave had a wish to <<10 with him I did
not say " no." I 00t to All Saints Bay 111 three weeks,
and was now a free man.

I had made a. good sum by all my store, and with
this I went 011 l1111d.B11t I (lid not at all know what to
do next. At lenoth I met with 11 man whose case was
much the same as my 01111, and we both took some
land to farm. My stock, like his, was low, but we made
0111' farms serve to keep 11s in food, though not more
than that We both stood in need of help, and I saw
110w that I had done 11"1011gt0 part with 1111' 1101'.

I did not at all like this kind of lile. " hat! thought
I, l1a1e I come all this 1'1 11y to do that which I could
have done as well at home with my friends round me!
And to add to my 0rid, the kind liiend 11110 had
brought me here in his ship, new meant to le111e these
shores.

011 my fiist start to sea when a boy, I had put a
small sum in the hands of an aunt, and this 1111' li'iend
said I should do well to spend on n1_1'l1n'n1.S0 when
he not home he sent some of it in cash, and laid out
the 1est in cloth, stuffs, baize, and such like n'oods. My
aunt had put a few pounds in my friend's hands as a
gift to him, to show her thanks for all that he had done
for me, and with this sum he was so kind as to buy meCrusoe brings Home a young Gcat.
a slave. 111 the mean time I had bought a slave,
so now I had two, and all went 011 well for the next
year.

But soon my plans grew too large for my means.
One day some men came to ask me to take cha'1t1e of
a slave ship to be sent out by them. They saidb they
would g'he me a sham in the slaves, and pay the cost
of the stock. This would have been a good thing for
me if I had not had farms and land; but it was wild
and lash to think of it now, for I had made a lalge
sum, and ought to have gone on in the same way for
tluee or low yeals more Well, I told these men that
I would go with all my hear,t if they would look to my
1311111 111 the mean time, which they said they would do

So I made my will, and went 011 boa1d this ship 011
the same day on which, eight years since I had lefi
Hull. She had six guns, twelve men, and a boy. We
took with 11s saws, chains, toys, beads, bits of glass,
and such like ware, to suit the taste of those with whom
we had to trade.

We were not more than twelve days from the Line,
when a high 11 111d took 11s oil 110 knew not 11 hole All
at once there was a cry of "Land!" and the ship struck
011 a bank of sand, in which she sank so deep that we
could not get her ofli At last we found that we must
make up our minds to leave her, and get to shore as
well as we could. There had been a beat at her stern,
but we found it had been torn off by the force of th(1
waves. One small boat was still left on the ship's side,
so we got in it.

There we were all of us on the wild sea. The heart
of each 110w grew faint, our cheeks were pale, and our
eyes were dim, for there was but one hope, and that
was to find some bay, and so get in the lee of the land.
We 110w gave up our whole souls to God.

The sea grew more and more rough, and its white
foam would curl and boil. At last the waves, in their
wild sport, bmst 0n the boat's side, and we were all
thrown out.

I could swim well, but the force of the waves made
me lose my breath too much to do so. At length one
large wa1e took me to the shore, and left me high and
dry, though half dead with fear. I got on 1111' feet and
made the best of my way for the land; but just then
the eune of a huge waxe lose up as high as a hill and
this I had no strength to keep from, so it took me back
to the sea. I did my best to float 011 the top, and held
my breath to do so. The next wave was quite as high,
and shut me up in its bulk. 1 held my hands down
tight to my side, and then my head shot out at the top
of the waves. This gave me heart and breath too,
and soon my feet felt the ground.

I stood quite still for a short time, to let the sea run
back from me, and then I set oll" with all my might to
the shore, but yet the waves caught me, and twice
more did they take me back, and twice more land 1ne
on the shore. I thought the last wave would have been
the death of me, for it drove me 011 a piece of rock,
and with such force, as to leave me in a kind of swoon.
which, thank God, did not last long. At length, to my
great joy, I got 11p to the cliffs close to the shore, where
I found some glass, out of the reach of the sea. There
I sat down, safe on land at last.

I could but cry out in the 11 0111s of the Psalm,
"They that 01) down to the sea in ships these men see
the works of the Lord in the deep. PM at His word
the storms rise, the winds blow, and lift 11p the 11111' es;
then do thev mount to the sky, and from thence go
down to the deep. My soul fiiiilts, I reel to and fro.
and 11111 at my 111t's end: then the Lo1d brings me out
of all my foals."

I felt so wmpt in joy, that all I could do was to walk
up and down the coast, now lift up my hands, now fold
them on my breast, and thank God for all that He had
done fo1 111e, when the rest of the men W010 lost. All
lost but I, and I was safe! I 11011 cast my eyes round
me, to find out what kind of a place it 11 as that I had
been thus thrown in, like a bird 111 a storm Then all
the 0'lee I felt at filst left 1110; for I was wet 11nd cold,
and had no 1111' (lothes to put on, 110 food to eat, and
not a friend to help me

'l'he1e were wild beasts here, but I had no gun to
shoot them with, or to keep me from their jaws. I had
but a knife and a pipe.
It now grew dark; and where was I to go for the
night? I thought the top of some high tree would be
a good place to keep me out of harm's way; and that
there I might sit and think of death, for, as yet, I had
no hopes of life. Well, I went to my tree, and made
.t kind of nest to sleep in. Then I cut a stick to keep
off the beasts of prey, in case they should come, and
fell to sleep just as if the branch I lay on had been a
bed of down.

When I woke up it was broad day; the sky too was
clear and the sea calm. But I saw from the top of the
tree that in the night the ship had left the bank of sand,
and lay but a mile from me; while the boat was on the
beach, two miles on my right. I went some way down
by the shore, to get to the boat; but an arm of the
sea, half a mile broad, kept me from it. At noon, the
tide went a long way out, so that I could get near the
ship; and here I found that if we had but made up our
minds to stay on board, we should all have been safe.

I shed tears at the thought, for I could not help it;
yet, as there was no use in that, it struck me that the
best thing for 1110 to do was to swim to the ship. I
soon threw off my clothes, took to the sea, and swam
up to the wreck. But how was I to get on deck ? I
had swam twice round the ship, when a piece of rope
caught my eye, which hung down from her side so low,
that at first the waves hid it By the help of this rope
I got on board.
I found that there was a bulge in the ship, and that
she had sprung a leak. You may be sure that my first
thought was to look round for some food, and I soon
made my way to the bin, where the bread was kept, and
ate some of it as I went to and fro, for there was no time
to lose. 'l'he1e was, too, some 111111, of which I took a
good draught, and this gave me healt. What I stood
most in need of, 1111s a boat to take the goods to shore
But it 11 as vain to 111511 for that which could not be had',
and as the1e were some spare 1a11ls 111 the ship, two or
three l111 gc planks of wood, and a spare mast or two, I
fell to wo1k with these, to make a raft.

Ipnt four spars side by side, and laid short hits of

plank on 1.,hem cross 111a 11s, to make my raft st1 011111
Though these planks would beal my own 110111ht they
wele too sli11ht to bear much of my f'1'ei11ht. So I took
a saw which was 011 board, and cut 11. mast in three
lengths, and these gave great strength to the raft. I
found some bread and rice, a Dutch cheese, and some
dry goat's flesh. There had been some wheat, but the
rats had got at it, and it was all gone.

My next task was to screen my goods from the spray
of the sea; and it did not take me long to do this, for
them ""010 tlnee la1ge chests 011 board which held all,
and these I put 011 the raft When the high tide came

up it took oft my coat and shirt, which I had left 011
the shore; but there were some fresh e1othes 111 the ship.

" See here is a prize l" said I, out loud, (though
there were none to hear me), " now I shall not starve.
F or I found four large guns. But how was my raft to
be got to land? I had no sail, no oars; and a gust of'
wind would make all my store slide ofl'. Yet there
were three things which I was glad of; a calm sea, a
tide which set in to the shore, and a slight breeze to
blow me there.

I had the good luck to find some ears in a part of
the ship, in which I had made no search till now. With
these I put to sea, and for half' a mile my raft went
well; but soon I found it drove to one side. At length
I saw a creek, to which, with some toil, I took my raft;
and now the beach was so near, that I felt my ear
touch the ground.

Here I had well nigh lost my freight, for the shore
lay on a slope, so that there was no place to land on,
save where one end of the raft would lie so high, and
one end so low, that all my goods would fall 011'. To
wait till the tide came up was all that could be done.
So when the sea was a feet deep, I thrust the raft on a
flat piece of ground, to moor her there, and stuck my
two oars in the sand, one on each side of the raft.
Thus I let her he till the ebb of the tide, and when it
went down, she was left safe on land with all her freight.

I saw that there were birds on the isle, and I shot
one of them. Mine must have been the first gun that
had been heard there since the world was made; for at
the sound of it, Whole flocks of birds flew up, with loud
cries, from all parts of the wood. The shape of the
beak of the one I shot was like that of a. hawk, but the
claws were not so large.

I now went back to my raft to land my stores, and
this took 111) the rest of the day. What to do at night
I knew not, nor where to find a safe place to land my
stores on. Idid not like to lie down 011 the ground,
for fear of beasts of prey, as well as snakes, but there
was no cause for these teams, as I have since found. I
put the chests and boards round me as well as I could,
and made a kind of hut for the night.

As there was still a great store of things left in the
ship. which would he of use to me, I thought that I
ought to bring them to land at once; for I knew that
the first storm would break 11p the ship. So I went on
board, and look good care this time not to load my
raft too much.

The first thing I sought for was the tool chest; and
in it were some bags of nails, spikes, saws, knives, and
such things: but best of all, I found a stone to grind
my tools 011. There were two or three flasks, some
large bags of shot, and a roll of lead; but this last I
had not the strength to hoist 11p to the ship's side, so
as to get it on my raft. There were some spare sails
too, which I brought to shore.

I had some fear lest n11 stores might be 11111 011' with
b1 beasts ol 11101 it not b) n1en;l)ut I found all safe
and sound when 1 went hack, and no one had come
there but a wild cat, which sat on one of the chests.
When I came up I held my gun at her, but as she did
not know what a gun was, this did not rouse her. She
ate a piece of dry goat's flesh, and then took her leave.

Now that I had two freights of goods at hand, I
made a tent with the ship's sails, to stow them in, and
cut the poles for it from the wood. I now took all the
things out of the casks and chests, and put the easks
in piles round the tent, to give it strength; and when
this was done, I shut up the door with the boards, spread
one of the beds (which I had brought from the ship)
on the ground, laid two guns close to my head, and
went to bed for the first time. I slept all night, for I
was much in need of rest.

The next day I was sad and sick at heart, for I felt
how dull it was to be thus cut off from all the rest of
the world! I had no great wish for work: but there
was too much to be done for me to dwell long on my
sad lot. Each day. as it came, I went off to the wreck
to fetch more things; and I brought back as nmch as
the wit would hold. One dayI had put too great a
load on the raft, which made it sink down on one side,
so that the goods were lost in the sea; but at thisI
did not fret, as the chief part of the freight was some
rope, which would not have been of much use to me

The twelve days that I had been in the isle were
spent in this way, and I had brought to land all that
one pair of hands could lift; though if the sea had
been still calm, I might have brought the whole ship,
piece by piece.

The last time I swam to the wreck, the wind blew so
hard, that I made 11p my mind to go 011 board next
time at 1011' tide. I found some tea and some gold
coin; but as to the gold, it made me laugh to look at
it. "0 drug!" said I, "Thou art of 110 use to me! I
care not to save thee. Stay where thou art, till the ship
go down, then go thou with it!"

Still, I thought I might as well just take it; so I put
it in a piece of the sail, and tl11'e11 it 011 deck that I
might place it on the raft B1'e-a11d-b_1-'e,tl1e 11111d ble11
from the shor,e so I had to swim back 111th all speed;
f01 I knew that at the turn of the tide, I should find it
hard work to get to land at all. But in spite of the
high wind, I came to my home all safe. At (lawn of
day I put my head out, and cast my eyes 011 the sea.
When 10! no ship was there!

This change in the face of things, and the loss of such
a friend, quite struck me down. Yet I was glad to
think that I had Inought to show all that could be
of use to me I had 11011 to look out for some spot
whole I could make 1111 home. Half way 11p a hill
there 11 as a small plain, four 01' fire some feet long, and
twice as broad; and as it had a full view of the?3 sea, I
thought that it would he a good place for my house

I filst dug a t1':en(h round a space which took in
twelve yalds; and 111 thisI drove two 1"011s of stakes,
till they stood firm like piles, five and a halt' feet from
the ground. I made the stakes close and tight with
hits of rope, and put small sticks on the top of them
in the shape of spikes. This made so strong a fence
that no man or beast could get in.

The door of my house was 011 the top, and I had to
Climb 1111 to it by steps, which I took in with 111e, so
that no one else might come up by the same way.
Close to the back of the house stood a high rock, in
which I made a cave, and laid all the earth that I had
dug out of it round my house, to the height of a foot
and a half. I had to go out once a day in search of
food. The first time, I saw some goats, but they were
too shy and swift of foot, to let me get near them.

At last I lay in wait for them close to their own
haunts If the3 saw me in the vale though they 111i1rht
be 011 high ground they would 1'1111 off wild with fear;
but if they w'eIe in the vale, and I 011 high ground
they took no heed of me. The li1st goat I shot had a
kid b3 her side, and 11 hen the old one fell, the kid stood
near her till I took her off 011 my back: and then the
301mg one 11111 by my side I put down the goat, and
brought the kid home to tame it; but as itD was too
young to feed, I had to kill it.

At lust I thought that, for the lack of pen and ink,
I should lose all note of time; so I made a large post,
in the shape of a cross, 011 which I out these 11'01ds, "I
came on these shores on the 8th day of June, in the
year 1659." On the side of this post I made a notch
each day as it 111110, and this I kept up till the last

I 111110 not yet said a word of 1113' four [,1ets which
were two eats, a dog, and a bird. You 111113'_,11uLss 11011
fond I was of them, for they W010 all the friends left
to me. I brouo'ht tlie do11' and two cats from the ship.
The dog 11 ould fetch things for me at all times, and by
his bark, his 11l1i11e, his 11ro11'l, and his tricks he 11 ould
all but talk to me; yet he could not 11'i1e me thou11ht
for thought.

If I could but have had some one near me to find
fault with, or to find fault with me, what a treat it would
have been! Now that I had brought ink from the ship,
I wrote down a sketch of each day as it '11me; not so
much to lea1'e to those who might read it when I "as
dead and 11011e, as to 11et rid of my 01111 tl10u11',hts and
draw me from the (ems which all daylong d11elt 011
1113' mind, till 1113' head would ache with the weinht of
them.

I was a long way out of the course of ships: and
oh, how dull it was to be cast 011 this lone spot 111th no
one to 1010, no one to make me 11111111',h 110 one to make
me weep no one to make me think It 1111s dull to
roam, day by (1113, from the wood to the shore; and
from the shore back to the wood, and feed on my own
thoughts all the while.

So much for the sad View of my case; but like most
things, it had a bright side as well as a dark one. For
here was I safe on land, while all the rest of the ship's
crew were lost. Well, thought I, God who shapes our
ways, and led me by the hand then, can save me from
this state now, 01' send some one to be with me; true, I
am cast on a rough and rude pa1t of the globe, but there
are no beasts of prey on it to kill or hurt me. God has
sent the ship so near to me, that l have got from it all
things to meet my wants for the rest. of my days. Let
life be what it may, there is sure to be 11111011 to thank
God for; and I soon gave 11p all (lull thoughts, and did
not so much as look out for a sail.

My goods from the wreck had been in the cave for
more than ten months; and it was time now to put
them right, as they took up all the space, and left me
no room to turn in: so I made my small care a large
one, and dug it out a long way back in the sand rock.
Then I brought the mouth of it up to the fence, and so
made a back 11 ay to my house This done, I put
sheh es 011 each side, to hold n1y,.,ooods,11h1eh made my
cave look like a shop full of stor.es To make these
shel1es I cut down a tree, and 111th the help of a saw,
an axe, a plane, and some more tools, I made boards.

A chair, and a desk to write on. came next. I rose
in good time, and set to 110111 till noon then I ate my
meal, then I went out 111th my gun, and to 110111 onee
mele till the sun had set; and then to bed It took me
mele than a 11 eek to change the shape and size 0! my
cave, but I had made it far too la1ge; for in course of
time the ea1th fell in from the roof; and had I been in
it, when this took place, I should have lost m3 life. I
had now to set up posts in 111y1'13e, with planks on
the top of them, so as to make a loof' of 33 00d

One day when out with 111315 01111, I shot a wild cat,
the skin of which made 1110a cap; and I found some
birds of the dove tribe, which built their nests in the
holes of rocks.

I had to go to bed at dusk, till I made a lamp ol
0'oat's fat, 33 Inch I put in a el113 dish; and this with a
piece of hemp for a wok made a good li<Il.1t As I
had found a use for the b1l0 which had held the fowl's
food 011 boald ship, I shook out fiom it the husks of
corn. This was just at the time when the great rains
fell, and in the coinse of a month, blades of rice, corn,
and rye, splanw up. As time went by, and the grain
was ripe, I kept it, and took care to sow it each 3'1e1r;
but I could not boast of 11 c1op of wheat, as will be
131103111 bye-1111114130, for three 3-'ea1s.

A thin" now took place on the isle, which no one
could have dreamt of, and which struck me (low 11 with
fear. It was this--the ground shook with great force,
which threw down earth from the rock with a loud crash
--0nce more t|1e1e was a shock--and now the earth fell
from the 1oof of 111y:113e. The sea did not look the
same as it had done, for the shocks wele just as stlong
there as 011 land. The sway of the earth made me feel
sick; and there was a noise and a roar all round me.
The same kind of shock came a. third time; and
when it had gone off, I sat quite still on the ground,
for I knew not what to do. Then the clouds grew dark,
the wind rose, trees were torn up by the roots, the sea
was a mass of foam and froth, and a, great part of the
isle was laid waste with the storm. I thought that the
world had come to an end. In three homs' time all
was calm; but rain fell all that night, and a great part
of the next day. Now, though quite worn out, I had
to move my goods which were in the cave, to some
safe place.

I knew that tools would be my first want, and that
I should have to grind mine on the stone, as they were
blunt and worn with use. But as it took both hands
to hold the tool, I could not tuxn the stone, so I made
a wheel by which I could mo1e it with my foot. This
was no small task, butI took great pains with it, and
at length it was done.

The rain fell for some days and a cold chill came on
me; in short I was ill. I had pains in my head, and
could get no sleep at night, and my thoughts were wild
and strange. At one time I shook with cold, and then
a hot fit came 011, with faint sweats, which would last
six hours at a time. III as I was, I had to go out with
my gun to get food I shot a goat, but it was a great
toil to bring it home, and still more to cook it.

I spent the next day in bed, and felt half dead from
thirst, yet too weak to stand up to get some drink. I
lay and wept like a child. "Lord look on me! Lord
look on me!" would I cry for hours.

At last the [it left 111e, and I slept, and did not wake
till dawn. I dreamt that I lay on the ground, and saw
a man come down from a great black cloud in a llame
of light. When he stood 011 the earth, it shook as it
had done a few days since; and all the world to me
was full of fire. He came up and said " As I see that
all these things have not brontrht thee to play, 11011 thou
shalt die.' Then I woke, and found it "as a dream.

Week and faint, I was in dread all day lest my fit should
come on.

Too ill to get out with my gun, I sat 011 the shore to
think, and thus ran my thoughts: "What is this sea
which is all round me? and whence Is it? There can
be no doubt that the hand that made it, made the air,
the earth, the sky. And who is that? It is God who
hath made all things. Well then, if God hath made all
things, it must be He who guides them; and if so, 110
one thing in the whole range of His works can take
place, and He not know it. Then God must know how
sick and sad I am, and He wills me to be here. 0,
Why hath God done this to me ! "

Then some voice would seem to say, "Dost thou
ask why God hath done this to thee? Ask why thou
wert not shot 111' the Moors, who came 011 board the
ship, and took the li1es of thy mates. Ask \1l1y thou
wert not torn by the beasts of prev on the coasts. Ask
why thou didst not go down in the deep sea with the
refit of the crew, but didst come to this isle, and art
sa e."

A sound sleep then fell on me, and when I woke it
must have been three o'clock the next day, by the rays
of the sun: nay, it may have been more than that; for
I think that this must have been the (lay that I did not
mark on my post, as I have since found that there was
one notch too few.

I now took from my store the Book of God's Word,
which I had brought from the wreck, not one page of
which I had yet read. My eyes fell on five words, that
would seem to have been put there for my good at this
time; so well did they cheer my faint hopes, and touch
the true source of my fears. They were these: "I
will not leave thee." And they have dwelt in my heart
to this day. I laid down the book, to pray. My cry
was "0, Lord, help me to love and learn thy ways."
This was the first time in all my life that I had felt a
sense that God was near, and heard me. As for my
dull life here, it was not worth a thought; for now a
new strength had come to me; and there was a change
in my griefs, as well as in my joys.

I had now been in the isle twelve months, and I
thought it was time to go all round it, in search of its
woods, springs, and creeks. So I set off, and brought
back with me limes and grapes in their prime, large
and ripe. I had hung the grapes 1n the sun to dry,Flzday's Father saved from the Cannibals.
111111 in 11 few days' time went to fetch them, that I 111ight
lay up 11 store. rl'he vale, 011 the banks 11f 11l1ich they
g1ew, was flesh and green, and 11 clear ,111'i51'ht stream

1111 through it, which gave so meat 11 charm to the
spot,11s to make me wish to li1e thele.

But there was 1111 1'ie11 11f the sea f1om this 1ale,
while from 1111' house, no ships could come 1111 1111' side
of the isle, and not 110 seen 111'111e;1'ct the cool, soft
banks 11 em s11 sweet and new to me that much 01 my
time was spent there.

111 the first of the three yeals in which I 111111 gro11'11
corn, I 111111 $01111 it too late; in the next it was spoilt
by the drought; but the third 1'1'1'11s' crop 111111 sprung
up well.

I found that the hares would lie in it night and day,
for which there was no cure but to plant a. thick hedge
all round it; and this took me more than three weeks
to do I shot the hares in the day time; 111111 when it
gr'e11 d111'k,I made fast the 11051" s chain to the 5 11,110 and
there he stood to bark all night.

111 a short time the corn grew strong, and at last ripe;
but, just as the hares had hurt it in the blade, so 110w
the birds ate it in the 01111At the noise 11f 1111' gun
1111010 tloeks of them would 1111111; and at this rate 1
saw that thele 11011111 be no corn left; so I made up my
mind to keep 11 101111 out night and 11111. I hid 111' the
side of 11 hedge, and could see the birds sit on the trees
and watch, and then come down, one by one, as at 111st.
Now each grain of wheat was, as it were, a. small
loaf of bread to me. So the great thing was to get rid
of these birds. My plan was this, I shot three, and
hung them up, like thieves, to scare all that came
to the corn; and from this time, as long as the dead
ones hung there, not a bird came near. When the corn
was ripe, I made a scythe out of the swords from the
ship, and got in my crop.

Few of us think of the cost at which a loaf of bread
is made. Of course, there was no plough here to turn
up the earth, and no spade to dig it with, so I made
one with wood; but this was soon worn out, and for
want of a rake, I made use of the bough of a tree.
When I had got the corn home, I had to thrash it, part
the grain from the chaff, and store it up. Then came
the want of a mill to grind it, of sieves to clean it, and
of Yeast to make bread of it.

till, my bread was made, though I had no tools;
and no one could say that I did not earn it by the
sweat of my brow. When the min kept me in doors,
it was good fun to teach my pet bird Poll to talk; but
so mute were all things round me, that the sound of
my own voice made me start.

My chief wants now were jars, pots, cups, and plates,
but I knew not how I could make them. At last I went
in search of some clay, and found some a mile from my
house; but it was quite a joke to see the queer shapes
and forms that I made out of it. For some of my pots
and jars were too weak to bear their own weight; and
they would fall out here, and in there, in all sorts of
ways; while some, when they were put in the sun to
bake, would crack with the heat of its lays. You may
guess what my joy was when at last a pot was made
which would stand the heat of the fire, so that I could
boil the meat for broth.

The next thing to be made was a sieve, to part the
grain from the husks. Goat's hair was of no use to
me, as I could not weave or spin; so I made a shift for
two years with a thin kind of stuff, which I had brought
from the ship. But to grind the corn with the stones
was the worst of all, such hard work did I find it. To
bake the bread I burnt some wood down to an ash,
which I threw on the hearth to heat it, and then set my
loaves on the hearth, and in this way my bread was
made.

"he next thing to turn my thoughts to was the ship's
boat, which lay on the high ridge of sand, where it had
been thrust by the storm which had east me on these
shores. But it lay with the keel to the sky, so I had
to dig the sand from it, and turn it up with the help of
a pole. When I had done this, It'onnd it was all in
vain, for I had not the strength to launch it. So all I
could do now, was to make a boat of less size out of
a tree; and I found one that was just fit for it, which
grew not far from the shore, butI could no more stir
this than I could the ship's boat.
What was to be done? I first dug the ground flat
and smooth all the way from the boat to the sea, so
as to let it slide down; but this plan did not turn out
well, 0 I thought I would try anew way, which was
to make a trench, so as to bring the sea 11p to the boat,
as the boat could not be brought to the sea. But to
do this, I must have dug down to a great depth, which
would take one man some yeals to do. And when too
late, I found it was not wise to work out a scheme, till
I had fi1st thought of the cost and toil.

"Well," tl1011g,htI "I must gi1e up the boat, and
with it all my hopes to 101110 the isle. But I have this
to think of: I am 101d of the whole isle; in fact, a king.
I ha1e wood with which I might build a fleet, and
grapes, if not com, to freight it with, though all my
wealth 1s but a few gold coins." F01 these I had no
sod of use, and could have found it in in) hemt to gi1e
them all for a peek of peas and some ink, which last I
stood much in need of. But it was best to dwell more
on what I had, than on what I had not.

I now must needs try once more to build 11 boat, but
this time it was to have a mast, for which the ship's
sails would be of great use. I made a deck at each
end, to keep out the 141111111 of the sea a bin for my
food, and a lest fol my gun, with a flap to screen it
from the 11 (,t More than all, the boat was one of such
a size that I could launch it.

My fn'st cruise was 11p and down the creek, but soon
I got bold, and made the whole round of my isle. I
took with me bread, cakes, and 11 pct full of rice, some
rum, hall" a goat, two great coats, one of which was to
lie on, and one to put 011 at night. I set sail in the
sixth year of my 1ei1111. ()11 the I'1st side of the isle
tllele 111s 11 1111110 1id11e cl locks, which lav two miles
from the shole; 11nd a Dshoal ol sand lay for half 11 mile
from the locks to the beach. To 11et lound to this
point, I had to sail a great way onto to sea; and here
I all but lost my life.

But I got back to my home at last. 011 my way
there, quite worn out with the toils of the boat, I lay
down ill the shade to rest my linlbs, 11nd slept. But
judge, if you can, what a start I gave, when a voice
woke me out of my sleep, and spoke my name three
times! A voice ill this wild place! To call me by
name, too! Then the voice said, "Whole are you "
Whele have you been? IIow came you how? ' But
now I saw it all, for at the top of the hedoe sat Poll,
who did but say the 11 ords she had been taught by me.

I now went ill sealch of some 11oats, and laid snales
for them, with lice fol a bait I had set the tlaps ill the
night, and found they had all stood, though the bait
was 110110.80 I thou11ht of a new way to C,takc them.
which 11 as to make a pit and lav sticks and glass 011 it,
so as to hide it; and 111 this way I cau0ht all old "oat
and some kids. But the old goat was lunch too fierce
for me, so I let him go.
I brought all the young ones home, and let them fast
a. long time, till at last they fed liom my hand, and were
quite Dtame. I kept them In a kind of park, in which
there were trees to screen them from the sun. At first
my paxk was tlnee miles lound; but it struck me that,
in so meat :1. space, the kids would soon get as wild as
if they had the lanve of the whole \ale, and that it
would be as well to give them less room; so I had to
make a hedge, which took me three moriths to plant.
My park held a flock of twelve goats, and in two years
more there were more than two score.

My dog sat at meals with me, and one cat on each
side of me, 011 stools, and we had Poll to talk to us.
New for a word or two as to the dress in which I made
a tour round the isle. I could but think how droll it
would look in the streets of the town in which I was
bom. I wore a high cap of goat's skin, with a flap
that hung down, to keep the sun and rain from my
neck, a coat made from the skin of a goat too, the
skirts of which came down to my hips, and the same
on my lees, with no shoes, but flaps ot' the fin Iound
my shins.U I had a broad belt of the same lound n1\
waist, which dlew on with two thongs; and hem it, 011
my right side, hung a saw and 1111 axe, and 011 my left
side a pouch for the shot. My board had not been cut
since I came here. But no more need be said of my
looks, for there were few to see me.
A strange sight was now in store for me, which was
to change the whole course of my life in the isle.

One day at noon, while on a stroll down to a part of
the shore that was new to me, what should I see on the
sand but the print of a man's foot! I felt as if I was
bound by a spell, and could not stir from the spot.

Bye-and-bye, I stole a look round me, but no one
was in sight What could this mean? I went three
or four times to look at it. There it was--the print of
a man's foot; toes, heel, and all the parts of a foot.
How could it have come there '2

My head swam with fear; and as I left the spot, I
made two or three steps, and then took a look round
me; then two steps more, and did the same thing. I
took flight at the stump of an old tree, and ran to my
house, as if for my life. How could aught in the shape
ol'a man come to that shore, and I not know it? Where
was the ship that brought him ? Then a vague dread
took hold of my mind, that some man, or set of men,
had found me out; and it might be, that they meant to
kill me, or rob me of all I had.

How strange a thing is the life of man! One day
we love that which the next day we hate. One day we
seek what the next day we shun. One day we long
for the thing which the next day we fear; and so we
go on. N ow, from the time that I was cast on this isle,
my great source of grief was that I should be thus cut
off from the rest of my race. Why, then, should the
thought that a. man might be near give me all this
pain? Hay, why should the mere sight of the print
of 11 man's foot make me quake with fear? It seems
most st1 111100; yet not more strange than true.

Once it Osti'uck me that 1t nnght be the print of my
own foot, when fiist the storm cast me 011 these shores
Could I have come this way from the boat? Should
it in truth tum out to be the print of my own feet, I
should be like a. boy who tells of a "host, and feels
more friWht at his 01111 tale, than these do whom he
meant to scare.

Fear kept me in--doors for three days, till the want
of food drove me out. At 111st I was so bold as to go
down to the coast to look once more at the print of the
foot, to see if it 1113 the same shape as 1113' 0111.1 1
found it was not so large by a g1e11t deal; so it was
clear them 11110 men in the isle. Just at this time 1113'
good watch (1011 fell do" 11 dead at my feet. He was
old 11nd worn out, and in him I lost) my best guard
11nd friend

()ne d11y11s I went flom the hill to the coast, a scene
lay 111 front of me which made me $1111 at heart. 'I he
spot was spread with the bones of men. T'hele was:
round place (111}1 in the earth where a fire had been
made, and here some men had eon. .c to feast. Now
that I had seen this sight, I knew not how to act; I
kept close to my home, and would scarce stir from it,
save to milk my flock of goats-
To feel safe was 110w more to me than to be well
fed; and I did not care to drive a nail, or chop a stick
of wood, lest the sound of it should be heard, much
less would I the a gun. Is to my bread and meat, I
had to bake it at ni11ht when the smoke could not be
seen. But I soon found the way to burn wood with
turf at the top of' it, which made it like chark, 01 dry
coal; and this I could use by day, as it had no smoke.

Ifound in the wood where I went to get the sticks
l'or my fire, a (21110 so huge that I could stand in it; but
I made more haste to get out, than in; for two large
eyes, as bright as staxs, shone out from it with a fierce
glare. I took a torch, and went to see what they could
be, and found that there was no cause for fear; for the
eyes were those of an old gray goat, which had gone
there to die of old age I gave him a push, to t1y to
get him out of the cave, but he could not rise from the
ground 11'1he1e he lay; so I left him the1e to die, as I
could not save his life.

I found the width of the cave was twelve feet; but
part of it, near the end, was so low that I had to creep
on my hands and feet to go in. What the length of it
1111.>>; I could not tell, fol my light went out, and I had
to 1ri1'e up my search The next day, I went to the
cave with large li11hts made of goat's fat; and when I
got to the end I found that the roof rose to t11o score
feet or more.

As my lights shone 011 the walls and roof of the cave,
a sight burst on my view, the charms of which no
tongue could tell; for the walls shone like stars. What
was in the rock to cause this it was ha1d to say; they
might be gems, or bright stones, or gold But let them
be5 what they may, this ca1e 1111s a mine of 11e111t|1 to
me; for at such time as I felt dull 01 sad, the bright
Scene 11 ould flash 011 my minds eye, and till it 111th
JOY

A score of years had gone b1, with 110 new sinht to
10st my eyes on, till this23 scene burst 011 them. I felt
11s if I should like to spend the rest of my life hole;
and at its close, lie down to die in this cave, like the
old goat.

As I went home I was struck by the sight of some
smoke, which came from a. fire no more than two miles
off. From this time I lost all my peace of mind. Day
and night a. dread would haunt me, that the men who
had made this fire would find me out. I went home
and dr'e11 up 1111' steps, but fiist I made all things lound
me look wild and rude. To load my gun 1111s the nc.\t
thing to do, and I thought it would be best to stay at
home and hide.

But this 11as not to be borne long. I had no spy
to send out, and all I could do 11 as too get to the top of
the hill, and keep a good look out. At last, tluough
my glass, I could see a g1oup of 11 11d men join inD a
dance round their lire. As soon a they had left, I took
two guns, and slung a sword 011 my side; then with all
speed, I set off to the top of the hill, once more to have
a good view.

This time I made up my mind to go up to the mem
but not with a view to kill them, for I felt that it would
be wrong to do so. With such a load of arms, it took
me two hours to reach the spot where the fire was; and
by the time I got there, the men had all gone; but I
saw them in four beats out at sea.

Down on the shore, there was a proof of what the
work of these men had been. The signs of their feast
made me sick at heart, and I shut my eyes. I dulst
not fire my gun when I went out for food on that side
the isle, lest there should be some of the men left, who
might hear it, and so find me out. This state of things
went on for a year and three months, and for all that
time I saw no more men.

On the twelfth of May, a great storm of wind blew
all day and night. As it was dark, I sat in my house;
and in the midst of the gale, I heard a gun firel My
guess was that it must have been from some ship east
on shore by the storm. So I set a light to some wood
on top of the hill, that those in the ship, if ship it should
be, might know that some one was there to aid them.
I then heard two more guns fire. When it was light, I
went to the South side of the isle, and there lay the
wreck of a ship, cast on the rocks in the night by the
storm. She was too far off for me to see if there were
men on board.
Words could not tell how much I did long to bring
but one of the ship's crew to the shore! So strong
was my wish to save the life of those on board, that I
could have laid down my own life to do so. There are
some springs in the heart which, when hope stirs them,
drive the soul on with such a force, that to lose all
chance of the thing one hopes for, would seem to make
one mad; and thus was it with me.

Now, I thought, was the time to use my boat; so I
set to work at once to fit it out. I took on board some
mm (of which I still had a good deal left), some dry
grapes, a bag of rice, some goat's milk, and cheese, and
then put out to sea. A dread came on me at the thought
of the risk I had run on the same rocks; but my heart
did not quite fail me, though I knew that, as my boat
was small, if a gale of wind should spring up, all would
be lost. Then I found that I must go back to the shore
till the tide should turn, and the ebb come on

I made up my mind to go out the next day with the
high tide, so I slept that night in my boat. At (lawn I
set out to sea, and in less than two hours I came up to
the wreck. What a scene was there! The ship had
struck on two rocks. The stern was torn by the force
of the waves, the masts were swept ell", ropes and chains
lay strewn on the deck, and all was wiapt in gloom.
As I came up to the wreck, a dog swam to me with a
yelp and a whine. I took him on board my boat, and
when I gave him some bread. he ate it like a wolf, and
as to drink, he would have burst, if I had let him take
his fill of it.

I went to the cook's room, where I found two men,
but they were both (lead. The tongue was mute, the
ear was deaf, the eye was shut, and the lip was stiff;
still the sad tale was told, for each had his arm round
his friend's neck, and so they must have sat to wait for
death. What a change had come on the scene, once
so wild with the lash of the waves and the roar of the
wind! All was calm now--death had done its work,
and all had felt its stroke, save the dog, and he was the
one thing that still had life.

I thought the ship must have come from Spain, and
there was much gold 011 board. I took some of the
chests and put them in my boat, but did not wait to
see what they held, and with this spoil, and three casks
of rum, I came back.

I found all things at home just as I had left them,
my goats, my cats, and my bird. The scene in the
cook's room was in my mind (lay and night, and to
cheer me up I (hank some of the rum. I then set to
work to bring my freight from the shore, where I had
left it. In the chests were two great bags of gold, and
some bars of the same, and near these lay three small
flasks and three bags of shot, which were a great prize.

From this time, all went well with me for two yeais;
but it was not to ,last. One day, as I stood on the hill,
I saw sur boats on the shore! What could this mean?
Where were the men who had brought them? And
what had they come for? I saw through my glass that
there were a. score and a half, at least, on the east side
of the isle. They had meat on the fire lound 11 hich I
could see them dance. They then took a man f10m
one of the boats, who was bound hand and foot; but
when they came to loose his bonds, he set off as fast
as his feet would take him, and iii a staight line to
my house.

To tell the truth, when I saw all the 1est of the men
1u11 to catch him my hai1 stood on end 111th flight. In
the creek, he swam like a fish, and the plunge which he
took brought him tlnough it in a few strokes. All the
men now ga1e up the Dehasc but two, and they swam
through the creek, but by 110 means so fast as the sla1e
had done \ow, I thought, was the time for me to
help the poor man, and my heart told me it would be
right to do so. I ran down my steps with my two guns,
and went with all speed up the hill, and then down by
a short cut to meet them.

I gave a. sign to the poor slave to come to me, and
at the same time went up to meet the two men, who
were in chase of him. Imade a rush at the thst of
these, to knock him down with the stock of my gun,
and he fell. I saw the one who was left, aim at me
with his bow, so, to save my life, I shot him dead.

The smoke and noise from my gun, gave the poor
slave who had been bound, such a. shock, that he stood
still on the spot, as if he had been in a trance. I gave
a loud shout for him to come to me, and I took care to
show him that I was a friend, and made all the signs I
could think of to coax him up to me. At length he
came, knelt down to kiss the ground, and then took
hold of my foot, and set it 011 his head. All this meant
that he was my slave; and I bade him rise, and made
much of him.

But there was more work to be done yet; for the
man who had had the blow from my gun was not dead.
I made a sign for my slave (as I shall 110w call him) to
look at him. At this he spoke to me, and though I
could not make out what he said, yet it gave me a
shock of joy; for it was the first sound of a man's
voice that I had heard, for all the yeals I had been 011
the isle.

The man whom I had struck with the stock of my
gun, sat up; and my slave, who was in great fear of
him, made signs for me to lend him my sword, which
hung in a belt at my side. With this he 11111 11p to the
man, and with one stroke cut olf his head. When he
had done this, he brought me back my sword with a
laugh, and put it down in front of me. I (lid not like
to see the glee with which he did it, and I did not feel
that my own life was quite safe with such a man.

He, in his turn, could but lift up his huge blown
hands with awe, to think that I had put his {'on to death
while I stood so fa1 from him. But as to the swmd,
he and the rest of his tribe made use of swords of wood,
and this was why he knew so well how to wield mine
He made signs to me to let him go and see the man
who had been shot; and he gave him a turn round,
first 011 this side, then 011 that; and when he saw the
wound made in his breast by the shot, he stood quite
still once more, as if he had lost his wits. I made signs
for him to come back, for my foals told me that the
rest of the men might come in search of their friends.

I did not like to take my slave to my house, nor to
my ca1';e so I th1e11 down some stnw flom the 1ice

plant for him to sleep on, and gave him some bread and
a bunch of dr,,y n11pes to eat Ile was a fine man, 111th
straight st1ong limbs, tall, and young. His hair was
thick, like wool, and black. Iliys head was large and
high; and he had bright black eyes. He was of a dark
brown hue; his face was round, and his nose small, but
not flat; he had a good mouth with thin lips, with
which he could give a soft smile; and his teeth were
as white as snow.

I had been to milk my goats in the field close by,
and when he saw me, he ran to me, and lay down 011
the ground to show me his thanks. He then put his
head 011 the ground. and set my foot 011 his head, as he
had done at filst. He. took all the means he couh'
think of, to let me know that he would save me all
his life; and I gave a sign to show that I thought
well of him.The Good Men and their Wives flee from the Wild Men.
The next thing was to think of some name to call
him bv I chose that of the sixth day of the week
(Friday '), as he came to me 011 that day. I took (me
not to lose sight of him all that night, and when the
sun rose, I made signs for him to come to me, that I
might give him some clothes, for he were none. We
then went up to the top of the hill, to look out for the
men; but as we could not see them, 01' their beats, it
was clear that they had left the isle.

My slave has since told me that they had had a great
fight with the tribe that dwelt next to them; and that
all those men whom each side took in war were their
own by right. My slave's foes had four who fell to
their share, of whom he was one.

I now set to work to make my man a cap of hare's
skin, and gave him a. goat's skin to wear round his
waist. It was a great source of pride to him, to find
that his clothes were as good as my own.

At night I kept my 0'uns, s11'01',d and bow close to
my sidez;D but the1e was no need for this, as my sla1e
was, in sooth, most true to me. He lid all that he "as
set to do, with his whole heart in the 11 wk, and I knew
that he would lay down his life to save mine. What
could a man do more than that? And oh, the joy to
have him here to (f'lIOCl me in this lone isle!

I (lid 1111' best to teach him, so like a child as he was,
to do and feel all that "as right I found him apt, and
full of fun: and he took gloat pains to learn all that I
could tell him. Our lives Ian 011 in a calm, smooth
way; and, but for the vile feasts which were held 011 the
shores, I felt no wish to leave the isle.

As my slave had by no means lost his zest for these
meals, it struck me that the best way to cure him, was
to let him taste the flesh of beasts; so I took him with
me one day to the wood for some sport. I saw a she-
goat, in the shade, with her two kids. I caught Friday
by the arm, and made signs to him not to stir, and then
shot one of the kids; but the noise of the gun gave
the poor man a great shock. He did not see the kid,
nor did he know that it was dead. He tore his dress
off his breast to feel if there was a wound there; then
he knelt down to me, and took hold of my knees to
pray of me not to kill him

To show poor Friday that his life was quite safe I
led him by the hand, and told him to fetch the kid. B)
and by, I saw a hawk 111 a tree, so I bade him look at
the guh, the hawk, and the ground; and then I shot
the bird. But my poor slave gave still more signs of
fear this time, than he did at lust: for he shook from
head to foot. He must have thought that some fiend
of death dwelt in the gun, and I think that he would
have knelt down to it, as well as to me; but he would
not so much as touch the gun for some time, though he
would speak to it when he thought I was not near.
Once he told me that what he said to it was to ask it
not to kill him.
I blought home the bird, and made b1oth of it. Fri-
day was much struck to see me eat salt with it, and
made a my face; but I, in my tu1n, took some that
had no salt with it, and I made a my face at that. The
next day I gave him a. piece of kids llesh, which I had
hung by a string in front of the fire to roast. My plan
was to put L110 poles, one 011 each side of the fire, and
a stick 011 the top of them to hold the suing. \\ hen
my sl111-e came to taste the flesh, he took the best means
to let me know how good he thought it.

The next day I set him to beat out and sift some
corn. I let him see me make the bread, and he soon
did all the work. I felt quite a love for his true, warm
heart, and he soon learnt to talk 10 me. One dayI
said, "Do the men of your tribe win in fight?" He
told 1110, with a smile, that they did. " W ell then, " said
I, " IIow came they to let their fees take you ?'

"They 11111 one, two, three, and make go in the boat
that time "

"Well, and what do the men do with those they
take '?"

"Eat them all up."

This was not good news for me, but I went on, and
said, "Where do they take them?"

" G0 to next place where they think."

"Do they come here?"

"Yes, yes, they come here, come else place too."

"Have you been here with them twice '?"
" Yes, come there."

He meant the North West side of the isle, so to this
spot I took him the next day. He knew the place, and
told me he was there once with a score of men. To
let me know this, he put a score of stones all of a row,
and made me count them.

"Are not the boats lost on your shore now and
then?" He said that there was no fear, and that no
boats were lost. He told me that up a great way by
the moon--that is where the moon then came Lip--there
dwelt a tribe of white men like me, with boards. I felt
sure that they must have come from Spain, to work the
gold mines. I put this to him: "Could I go from this
isle and join those men '2"

" Yes, yes, you may go in two boats."

It was hard to see how one man could go in two
boats, but what he meant was, a boat twice as large
3.3 III)' ()'I'll.

One day I said to my slave, "Do you know who
made you '3"

But he could not tell at all what these words meant.
So I said, " Do you know who made the sea, the ground
we tread on, the hills, and woods?" He said it was
Beck, whose home was a great way oil; and that he
was so old that the sea and the land were not so
old as he.

" If this old man has made all things. why do not
all things bow down to him?"
My slave gave a grave look, and said, "All things
say '0' to him."

" Where do the men in your land go when they
die ?"

" All go to Beck."

I then held my hand 11p to the sky to point to it, and
said, "God dwells there. He made the world, and all
things in it. The 1110011 and the stals are the work of
his hand. God sends the wind and the min on the
earth, and the streams that flow: He hides the face of
the sky with clouds, makes the glass to grow for the
beasts of the field, and herbs for the use of man. God's
love knows no end. When we p1ay, Ile draws near
to 11s and hears 11s."

It was a real joy to my poor slave to hear me talk
of these things. Ile sat still for a long time then ga1e
a sigh, and told me that he would say "0" to Book
110 111(11',e for he was but a shelt 11.111 <1", and 1 et could
not hear, till men went 11p the hill to speak to him

" Did 1011 go up the hill to speak to him?" said I

" No, ()kes go 11p to Beck, not young mans."

"What do Okcs say to him ? "

"They say '()."'

Now that I brought my man Friday to know that

eek 11.15 not the hue God, such was the sense he had
of my 1101lh, that I had fea1s lest I should stand in the
place of Book. I did 1111 best to call l'o1th his faith in
Christ, and make it strong and cleal, till at last--thanks
be to the Lord--I brought him to the love of Him.
with the whole grasp of his soul.

To please my poor slave, I gave him a sketch of my
whole life; I told him where I was born, and where I
spent my days when a child. He was glad to hear
tales of the land of my bi1th, and of the t11dc which
we keep up, in ships, with all parts of li' e 111101111 11 odd.
I gave him a knife and a belt, which made him dance
With joy.

One day as we stood 011 the top of the hill at the
east side of the isle, I saw him fix his eyes on the main
land, and stand for a long time to gaze at it; then
jump and sing, and call out to me.

"What do you see '?" said I.

" 0h joy !" said he, with a fierce glee in his eyes,
" 0h glad! There see my land !"

Why did he stmin his eyes to stare at this land, as
if he had a wish to be there ? It put feals in my mind
which made me feel far less at my ease with him.
Thought I, if he should go back to his home, he will
think 110 more of what I have taught him, and done
for him. He will be sure to tell the rest of his tribe
all my ways, and come back with, it may be, scores of
them, and kill me, and then dance round 1110, as they
did 10u11d the men, the last time theyc came 011 my isle

But these were all false fea1s, though they found a
place 111 my mind a long while, and 101118 not so kind
to him now as I had been. From this time I made it
a rule, day by day, to find out if there were grounds
for my fears or not. I said, "Do you not wish to be
once more in your own land?"

"Yes! I be much 0 glad to he at my own
land."

"What would you do there? Would you turn wild,
and be as you were?"

" No, no, I would tell them to be good, tell them eat
bread, corn, milk, no eat man more I"

" W11) r ,they would kill you I"

" No,)1io, they no kill; they love learn."

He then told me that some white men, \1 ho had
come on their shores in a boat, had taught them a
great deal.

"Then will you go back to your land with me?"

He said he could not swim so far, so I told him he
should help me to build a boat to go in. Then he said,
"If you go, I go."

"I go? why they would eat me!"

" No, me make them much love you."

Then he told me as well as he could, how kind they
had been to some white men. I brought out the large
boat to hear what he thought of it, but he said it was
too small. We then went to look at the old ship's boat,
which, as it had been in the sun for years, was not at
all in a sound state. The poor man made sure that it
would do. But how were we to know this '? I told
him we should build a boat as large as that, and that
he should go home in it. He spoke not a word, but
was grave and sad.

"What ails you?" said 1.

"Why, you grieve mad with your man? "

"What do you mean ? I am not cross with you."

"No cross? no cross with me? Why send your man
home to his own land, then?"

"Did you not tell me you would like to go back ?"

"Yes, yes, we both there; no wish self there, if you
not there I"

" And what should I do there?"

"You do great deal much good! you teach 11ild men
be good men; you tell them know God, may God,
and lead new life."

We soon set to 110111 to makea boat that 11 ould take
us both. The [fist thing was to look out for some large
trees that grew near the shore, so that we could launch
0111' boat when it was made. My slare's plan was to
burn the wood to make it the 1ight shape; but as mine
11 as to l1e11'it,I set him to 11"o1k with my tools; and 111
two months time 110 had made a good strong l.;1oat
but- it took a long while to get her (101111 to the show.

Friday had the whole charge of her; and, large as
she was, he made her more with ease, and said, "he
thought she go there well, though great blow wind!"
He did not know that I meant to make a mast and
sail. I cut down a. young fir tree for the mast, and then
I set to 1101k at the sail. It made me laugh to see my
man stand and stare, when he came to watch me sail
the boat. But he soon gave a jump, a laugh, and a
clap of the hands when he saw the sail jibe and fall,
fiist on this side, then 011 that.

The next thing to do was to stow our boat up in the
(neck, 11 how 110 c,dug a small (look; and when the tide
was low, we made a dam, to keep out the sea. The
time of year had now come for us to set sail, so we got
out all our stores, to put them in the boat.

One day I sent Friday to the shore, to get a sort 0."
herb that grew there. I soon heard him cry out to
me, " () grief! 0 bad! 0 bad! () out there boats, one,
two, three!" "Keep a stout heart," said I, to cheer
him. The poor man shook with fear; for he thought
that the men who brought him here, had now come
back to kill him.

" 'an you fight?" said I.

"Me shoot; but me saw three boats; one, two,
three!"

"Have no fear; those that we do not kill, will be
sure to take flight at the sound of our guns. N ow will
you stand by me, and do just as you are bid ?"

"Me (lie 11 hen you bid die."

I ga1e him a good draught of rum; and when he
had drunk this, he took 111) an axe and two guns, each
of which had a charge of swan shot. I took t11o guns
as well and put lalge shot in them, and then hungb my
gieat s11'01d by my side. From the top of the hill, I
saw with the help of my glass, that the boats had each
brought eight men, and one slave. They had come on
shore near the creek, where a grove of young trees
grew close down to the sea.

They had with them three slaves, bound hand and
foot, and you who read this, may guess what they were
brought here for. I felt that I must try and save them
from so hard a fate, and that to do this, I should have
to put some of their foes to death. So we set forth
011 our way. I gave Friday strict charge to keep close
to me, and not to fire till I told him to do so.

We went full a mile out of our way, that we might
get round to the wood to hide there. But we had not
gone far, when my old qualms came back to me, and
I thought, "Is it for me to dip my hands in man's
blood? Why should I kill those who have done me
no harm, and mean not to hurt me? Nay, who do not
so much as know that they are in the wrong, when
they hold these feasts. Are not their ways a sign that
God has left them (with the 1est of their t1ibe) to their
own dull hearts? God did not call me to be a judge
for Him. He who said, 'Thou shalt not kill,' said it
for me, as well as the 10st of the w 011d'

A tlnomr of thoughts like these \\ ould 111sh on m)
mind, as if to "am me to pause, till I felt sure that
then) "as mom to call me to the \\01k than I then
knew of. I took my stand in the wood, to watch the
men at their feast, and then crept on, with Friday close
at my heels. Thus we went till we came to the
skirts of the wood. Then I said to Friday, "Go up
to the top of that tree, and bring me word if you can
see the men."

He went, and quick as thought, came back to say
that they were all round the fire, and that the man who
was bound on the sand would be the next they would
kill. But when he told me that it was a white man, one
of my own race, I felt the blood boil in my veins. Two
of the gang had gone to loose the white man from his
bonds; so now was the time to fire.

At the sound of our guns, we saw all the men Jump
up from the ground where they sat. It must have been
the first gun they had heard in their lives. They knew
not which way to look. I now threw down my piece,
and took up a small gun; Friday did the same; and I
gave him the word to fire! The men mu right and
left, with yells and screams.

I now made a rush out of the wood, that they might
see me, with my man Friday at my heels, of eomse.
We gave a loud shout, and ran up to the white man as
fast as we could. There he lay on the hot sand. I cut
the flag, or rush, by which he was bound, but he was
too weak to stand or speak, so I gave him some rum.
He let me know by all the signs that he could think
of, how much he stood in my debt for all that I had
done for him.

I said, "We will talk of that bye and bye; but now
we must do what we can to save our lives." Friday,
who was free to go where he chose, llew here and there,
and put all the men to the rout. 'l'hey fled in full haste
to their boats, and were soon out at sea; and so we
got rid of our fees at last.

The man whom we had found on the sand told us
that his name was Carl, and that he came from Spain.
But there was one more man to claim our care; for the
black men had left a small boat on the sands, and in
this I saw a poor wretch who lay half dead. He could
not so much as look up, so tight was he bound, neck
and heels. When I cut the bonds from him he gave a
deep groan, for he thought that all this was but to lead
him out to die.

Friday then came up, and I bade him speak to the
old man in his own tongue, and tell him that he was free.
This good news gave him strength, and he sat up in the
boat. But when Friday came to hear him talk, and to
look him in the face, it brought the tears to my eyes to
see him kiss and hug the poor old man, and dance round
him with joy, then weep, wring his hands, and beat his
own face and head, and then laugh once more, sing, and
leap. For a long time he could not speak to me, so as
to let me know what all this meant. But at length
he told me that he was the son of this poor old man,
and that his name was J af.

It would be a hard task for me to tell of all the
quaint signs Friday made to show his joy. He went in
and out of the boat five 01' six times, sat down by old
Jaf, and held the poor old man's head close to his
breast to warm it; then he set to work to rub his arms
and feet, which ' were cold and stifi" from the bonds. I
told Friday to give him some 1'11111 and bread; but he
said, "None! Bad dog eat all 11p self." He then 1am
011' straight to the house, and took no heed of my calls,
but went as swift as a deer.

In an hou1's time, he ame back with a juu in his
hand. The good soul had 00110 all the way to the
house, that Jaf 111ight have a flesh d1~1111<rht from my
11 ell and with it he brou0ht two cakes, one of which
I bade him take to Car,l who lay 111 the shade of a tree.
His limbs were stifi" and cold, and he was too weak
to say1 a 1101d.

I set my man to rub his feet with rum, and while he
did so, I saw Friday t1un his head round from time to
time, to steal a look at the old man. Then we brought
Call and Jaf home from the boat 011 0111' backs,t3 as
they could not walk. The door of my house was at
the top, and the poor sick men could not climb the
steps by which I got in, so we made for them a tent
of old sails.

I was now a king of these three men, as well as Lord
of the isle ; and I felt proud to say, "They all owe their
lives to their king, and would lay them down for him
if he bade them do so." But I did not think that my
reign was so soon to come to an end. The next thing
ferns to do was to give Carl and Jaf some food, and
to kill and roast a kid, to which we all four sat down,
and I did my best to cheer them.

Carl in a few days grew quite strong, and I set him
to work to dig some land for seed; for it was clear we
should want more corn 110w that we had two more
months to fill. So we put in the ground all the stock
of grain I had, and thus we all four had as much work
as we could do for some time. When the crop grew,
and was ripe, we found we had a good store of grain.

We made a plan that Carl and Jaf should go back
to the main land, to try if they could get some of the
white men who had been cast on shore there, to come
and live with us; so they got out the boat, and took
with them two guns and food for eight days. They
were to come back in a week's time, and I bade them
hang out a sign when they came in sight, so that we
might know who they were.

One day, Friday ran up to me in great glee, and
said, " They are back! They are back 1" A mile from
shore, there was a boat with a sail, which stood in for
the land; but I knew it. c0uld not be the one which
our two friends had gone out in, ii)" it was on the wrong
side of the isle for that. I saw too, through my glass,
a ship out at sea. There were twelve men in the boat,
three of whom were bound in chains, and four had
fire arms.

Bye and bye, I saw one of the men raise his sword
to those who were in chains, and I felt sure that all was
not right. Then I saw that the three men who had
been bound wore set free; and when they had come
on shore they lay 011 the ground, in the shade of a
tree. I was soon at their side, for their looks, so sad
and worn, brought to my mind the filst few hours I
had spent in this wild spot, where all to me was wrapt
in gloom

I went up to these men, and said:

"Who are you, Sirs?"

They gave a start at my voice, and at my strange
dress, and made a move as if they would fly from me.
I said, "Do not fear me, for it may be that you 111110 a
f1iend at hand, though you do not think It " " He must
be sent f10111 the sky then," said one of them with a
gmve look; and he took off his hat to me at the same
time. "All help 1s from thence, Sir," I said; "but what
can I do to aid you? You look as if you had some
load of g1ief 011 your breast I saw one of the men
lift his swo1d as if to kill y."011

The team 11111 down the poor man's face, as he said,
"Is this a. god, or is it but a man '2 " " Have no doubt
on that some, Sh," saidI, " for a god would not have
come with a chess like this. 110,116 not fear--1101 wise
yom hopes too 1110 [1 for you see but a man, yet one
who 111ll do all he can to help you. Your speech
shows me that you come from the same land as I do.
I will do all I can to serve you. Tell me you1 case."
"Our case, Sir, is too long to tell you while they
who would kill us are so near. My name is Paul.
To be short, Sir, my crew have thrust me out of my
ship, which you see out there, and have lelt me here to
die. It was as much as I could do to make them
sheath their swords, which you saw were (hawn to slay
me. They have set me down in this isle with these two
men, my friend here, and the ship's mate."

" Whole have theyb 0one?" said I.

"There, in the wood, close by. r I fear they may haie
seen and heard 11s. If they have, they will be sure
to kill us all."

"Have they fire-arms ?"

"They have four guns, one of which is in the boat."

"Well then, leave all to me 1"

"There are two of the men," said he, "who are
worse than the rest. All but these I feel sure would
go back to work the ship."

I thought it was best to speak out to Paul at once,
and I said, "Now if I save your life, there are two
things which you must do." But he lead my thoughts,
and t5said, "If you saw my life, \011 shall do as you
like with me and my ship, and take her whe1e you
please."

I saw that the two men, in whose charge the boat
had been left, had come onshore; so the first thing I
did was to send Friday to fetch from it the oals, the
sail, and the gun. And 110w the ship might be said toCrusoe's Party in wait for Paul's Crew.
be in our hands. When the time came for the men to
go back to the ship, they were in a great rage; for, as
the boat had now no sail nor oars, they knew not how
to get out to their ship.

We heard them say that it was a stlange sort of
isle, for that sprites had come to the boat, to take off
the sails and ears. We could see them r1111 to and fro,
with great rage; then go and sit in the boat to 1est,
and then come 011 shore 011cc melc. When they drew
near to us, Paul and F1iday would fain ha\e liad me
[all 011 them at once. But my wish 11 as to spare them,
and kill as few as I could. I told two of my men to
creep on their hands and feet close to the ground, so
that they might not be seen, and when they got up to
the men, not to fire till I gave the word.

They had not stood thus long, when three of the
crew came up to 11s. Till new, we had but heard their
voice, but when they came so near as to be seen, Paul
and Friday stood up and shot at them. Two of" the
men fell (lead, and they were the welst of the crew,
and the third Ian otl'. At the sound of the guns I came
up, but it was so dark that the men could not tell if
there were three of 11s or three score.

It fell out just as I could 11 ish fol I hea1d the men
ask, " To 11110111 must 11c yield, and "hole me they ?"
Friday told them that Paul was thexe 111th the king of
the isle, "ho had hlought 111th him a 01011 d of lhen!
At this one of the crew said, "It Paul will spa1c our
lives, we will yield." "Then," said Friday, "you shall
know the king's will." Then Paul said to them, "You
know my voice; if you lay down your arms the king
will spare your lives!"

They fell 011 their knees to beg the same of me. I
took good care that they did not see me, but I gave
them my word that they should all live, that I should
take four of them to work the ship, and that the rest
would be bound hand and foot, for the good faith
of the four. This was to show them what a stern
king I was.

Of course I soon set them free, and I put them in a
way to take my place 011 the isle. I told them of all
my ways, taught them how to mind the goats, how to
work the farm, and make the bread. I gave them a
house to lixe in fire arms, tools, and my two tame
cats, in fact, all but Poll and myg gold.

As I sat on the top of the hill, Paul came up to me.
He held out his hand to point to the ship, and u 1th
much warmth took me to his arms, and said, "My
dear friend, there is your ship! For she is all yams,
and so are we, and all that is in her."

I cast my eyes to the ship, which rode half a mile
off the shore, at the mouth of the creek, and near the
place where I had brought my rafts to the land. Yes,
there she stood, the ship that was to set me free, and
to take me where I might choose to go. She set her
sails to the wind, and her flags threw out their gay
stripes in the h1'.eeze Such a. sight "as too much for
me, and I fell doun faint with joy. Paul then took
out a flask which he had brought for 1110, and gave me
a d1am, which I drank, but for a good while I could
not speak to him.

Friday and Paul then went on board the ship, and
Paul took charge of her once more. We did not start
that night, but at noon the next day I left the isle!
That lone isle, where I had spent so great a part of my
life--not much less than thrice ten long 3' eals.

When I came back to the dear land of my bi1',th all
was strange and new to me. I went to my old home
at York, but none of my friends were there, and to
my great grin I saw, on the stone at their grave, the
sad tale 01 their death

As they had thought, of course, that I was dead,
they had not left me their wealth and lands, so that I
stood much in want of means, for it was but a small
sum that I had brought with me from the isle. But in
this time of need, I had the luck to find my good friend
who once took me up at sea. He was now grown
too old for work, and had put his son in the ship in his
place. He did not know me at first, but I was soon
brought to his mind when I told him who I was. I
found fiom him that the land whiehI had bought on
my way to the isle was 110w 310th much.

As it 31 as a long way off I felt no wish to go and
live there, so I made up my mind to sell it, and" 111 the
ceu1se of a few months, I got for it a sum so large as
to make me a. rich man all at once.

Weeks, months, and years went by; I had a farm, 11
wife, and two sons, and was by no means young; but
still I could not get rid of a strong wish which dwelt
in my thoughts by day and my dreams by night, and
that was to set foot once more in my old isle.

I had now no need to work for feed, or for means
of life; all I had to do was to teach my boys to be
wise and good, to lixe at my ease, and see my
wealth g1ew day by day. Yet the wish to go hack
to my wild haunts clung round me like a cloud, and
I could in no \1 11y drive it from me, so true is it
that "what is bred in the bone will not come out of
the flesh."

At length I lost my wife, which was a great blow to
me, and my home was now so sad, that I made 11p my
mind to launch out once more 011 the broad sea, and
go with my man F1iday to that lone isle where dwell
all my hopes.

I took with me as large a store of tools, clothes, and
such like goods as I had room for, and men of skill in
all kinds of t11dcs to live in the isle. When we set
sail, we had 11. fair wind fer seine time, but one night
the mate, who vas at the watch, told me he saw a flash
of fire, and heard a gun go elf. At this we all 1am on
deck, from whence we saw a great light, and as there
was no land that way, we knew that it must be some
ship 011 fire at sea, which could not be far off, for we
heard the sound of the gun.

The wind was still fair, so we made our way for the
point where we saw the light, and in half an hour, it
was but too plain that a huge ship was 011 fire in the
midst of the broad sea. I gave the word to fire 01]"
five guns, and we then lay by, to wait till break of day.
But in the (lead of the night, the ship blew up in the
air, the flames shot fo1tl1, and what there was left of
the ship sank. We hung out lights, and 0111' guns kept
up a fire all night long, to let the crew know that there
was help at hand.

At eight o'clock the next day we found, by the aid
of the glass, that two of the ship's boats were out at sea,
quite full of men. They had seen us, and had done
their best to make us see them, and in half an hom
we came lip with them.

It would be a hard task for me to set forth in words
the scene which took place in my ship, when the poor
French folk (for such they were) came on boa1.(l As
to grief and tom, these are soon told--sighs, toms, and
groans make 11p the sum of them--but such a cause
ofj Joy as this 11 as in sooth, too much foi them to bear,
weak and all but dead as they 11 010

Some would send 11p shouts of Joy that lent the skv;
some would my and 11'1ing theil hands as if in the
depths of giief; some would dance, laugh, and sing;
not a few welc dumb, sick, faint, in 11 3110011, 01' half
mad; and two or three were seen to give thanks
to God.

In this stlange group, there was a young French
priest who did his best to soothe those round him, and
1 saw him go up to some of the crew, and say to them,
"Why do you scream, and tear your hair, and wring
you1 hands, my men? Let you1 joy be free and full,
gi1c it full range and scope, but leave off this trick of
the hands, and Dlif't them up in .p1aise; let your voice
swell out, not in screams, but in hymns of thanks to
God, 11110 has blouOht you out of so gloat a stiait, for
this will add peace to your joy."

The next day, they were all in a right flame of mind,
so I 01110 them 11 hat st01es I could spam and put them
011 boa1d a ship that we met 111th on 1101 11ay to
F1a11ce,all saw the 11110, with the pliest, had a 11 1sl1
to join me.

But we had not set sail long, when we fell in with a
ship that had been blown out to sea by a storm, and
had lost her masts; and, wome than all, her crew had
not had an ounce of meat or bread for ten days. I
gave them all some food, which they ate like wolves
in the snow, but I thought it best to check them, as I
had fears that so much all at once would cause the
death of some of them

The1e 11010 a 1011tl1 and a young gi1l 1n the ship who
the mate said he thought must be dead, but he had not
had the heart to (ro near them, fm the food "as all
gone. I found that they were faint for the want of it.
and as it were in the jaws of death; but in a short time
they both get well, and as they had no wish to go back
to their ship, I took them with me. So now I had eight
more on heard my ship, than I had when I first set out.

In three months from the time when I left home, I
came in sight of my isle, and I brought the ship safe
up by the side of the creek, which was near my old
house.

I went up to Friday, to ask if he knew where he was.
He took a look round him, and soon, with a clap of
the hands, said " 0 yes! 0 there! 0 yesl 0 there!"
Bye and bye, he set up a dance with such wild glee,
that it was as much as I could do to keep him on deck.
"Well, what think you, Friday?" said I; "shall we
find those whom we left still here 'l--Shall we see poor
old Jaf'? " He stood quite mute for a while, but when
I spoke of old Jaf (whose son Friday was), the tears
ran down his face, and the poor soul was as sad as
could be. "No, no," said he, "no more, no, no more."

As we caught sight of some men at the top of the
hill, I gave word to fire three guns, to show that we
were friends, and soon we saw smoke rise from the

' side of the creek. I then went on shore in a boat,
with the priest and Friday, and hung out a white flag
of peace. The first man I cast my eyes on at the
creek, was my old friend Carl, who, when I was last
on the isle, had been brought here in bonds.
I gme st1ict change to the men in the boat not to go
011 show, but I1i<lay could not be kept back, for with
his quick eye he had caught sight of old Jaf. It
brought the team to our eyes to see his joy when he
met the old man. He gave him a kiss, took him up
in his arms, set him down in the shade, then stood a
short way off to look at him, as one would look at a
work of art, then felt him with his hand, and all this
time he was in full talk, and told him, one by one, all
the stmnge tales of what he had seen since they had
last met.

As to my f1iend Ca1l, he came 11p to me, and 111th
much 11"almth shook my hands, and then took me to
my old house, which he now ga1e up to me. I could
no 111010 ha1e found the place, than if I had not been
them at all. The 1011s of trees stood so thick and
close, that the house could not be (rot at, mm by such
blind ways as none but those "he made them could
find out. WI hy l1a1e you built all these forts "' said
I. Carl told me that he felt sure I should say there
was much need of them, when I heard how they had
spent their time since they had come to the isle.

He brought twelve men to the spot where I stood,
and said, "Sir, all these men owe their lives to you."
Then, one by one, they came 11p to me, not as if they
had been the mere crew of a ship, but like men of
rank who had come to kiss the hand of their king.

The filst thing was to hear all that had been done in
the isle since I had left it. But I must first state that,
when we were on the point to set sail from the isle, a
feud sprang up on board our ship, which we could not
put down, till we had laid two of the men in chains.
The next day, these two men stole each of them a gun
and some small arms, and took the ship's boat, and ian
off with it to join the three bad men 011 shore.

As soon as I found this out, I sent the long-boat on
shore, with twelve men and the mate, and off they
went to seek the two who had left the ship. But their
search was in vain, nor could they find one of the rest,
for they had all fled to the woods when they saw the
boat. We had now lost five of the crew, but the three
first were so much worse than the last tw0, that in a
few days they sent them out of doors, and would have
no more to do with them, nor would they for a long
while give them food to eat.

So the two poor men had to live as well as they
could by hard work, and they set up tlIOII' tents on the
north shore of the isle, to be out of the way of the wild
men, who were wont to land on the east side. Here
they built them two huts, one to lodge in, and one to
lay up their stores in; and the men from Spain gave
them some corn for seed, as well as some peas which I
had left them. They soon learned to dig, and plant,
and heng in their land, in the mode which I had set
for them, and in short, to lead good lives, so that I
shall now call them the "two good men."
But when the three had men saw this, they were full
of spite, and came one day to tease and vex them.
They told them that the isle was their own, and that no
one else had a right to build 011 it, if they (lid not pay
rent. The two good men thought at first that they
were in jest, and told them to come and sit down, and
see what fine homes they had built, and say what rem
they would ask.

But one of the three said they should soon see that
they were not in jest, and took a torch in his hand,
and put it to the roof of the hut, and would have set
it on fire, had not one of the two good men trod the
lire out with his feet. The bad man was in such a rage
at this, that he ran at him with a pole he had in his
hand, and this brought on a fight, the end of which
was that the three men had to stand off. But in a short
time they came back, and trod down the corn, and
shot the goats and young kids, which the poor men
had got to bring up tame for their store.

One day when the two men were out, they came to
their home, and said, "Ha! there's the nest, but the
birds are flown." They then set to work to pull down
both the huts, and left not a stick, nor scarce a sign on
the ground to show where the tents had stood. They
tore up, too, all the goods and stock that they could
find, and when they had done this, they told it all to
the men of Spain, and said, "You, SlI'S, shall have,
the same sauce, if you do not mend your ways."
They then fell to blows and hard words, but Carl had
them bound in cords, and took their arms from them.
The men of Spain then said they would do them no
harm, and if they would live at peace they would help
them, and that they should live with them as they had
done till that time, but they could not give them back
their arms for three or four months

One night Cart--whom I shall call "the chief," as
he took the lead of all the rest--felt a great weight on
his mind, and could get no sleep, though he was quite
well in health. He lay still for some time, but as he,
did not feel at case, he got up, and took a look out
But as i t was too dark to see far, and he heard no noise,
he went back to his bed. Still it was all one, he could
not sleep; and though he knew not why, his thoughts
would give him no rest.

He then woke up one of his friends, and told him
how it had been with him. "Say you so ? " said he
"What if there should be some bad plot at work near
us!" They then set off to the top of the hill, where I
was wont to go, and from thence they saw the light
of a fire, quite a short way from them, and heard the
sounds of men, not of one or two, but of a great crowd,
We need not doubt that the chief and the man with
him now ran back at once, to tell all the rest what they
had seen; and when they heard the news, they could
not be kept close where they were, but must all run
out to see how things stood.
At last they thought that the best thing to do would
be, while it was da1k, to send old Jaf out as a spy, to
lea111 who they 11cr,e and what they meant to do.
When the old man had been gone an hour or two, he
brought word back that he had been in the midst of
the foes, though they had not seen him, and that they
were in two sets or tribes who were at war, and had
come there to fight. And so it was, for in a sholt time
they hca1d the noise of the fight,w'hicl1 went 011 for
two hou1s, and at the end, with tlnee loud shouts or
screams, they left the isle in their boats Thus my
friends were set free from all their fears, and saw no
more of their wild fees for some time.

One day a whim took the three bad men that they
would go to the main land, from whence the wild men
came, and try if they could not seize some of them, and
bring them home as slaves, so as to make them do the
hard part of their work for them. The chief gave them
all the arms and stores that they could want, and a
large boat to go in, but when they bade them "God
speed," no one thought that they would find thei1 11 '11
black to the isle. But 10! in th1ee weeks and a day,
they did in truth come back. One of the two good
men was the lust to catch sight of them, and tell the
news to his friends.

The men said that they had found the land in two
days, and that the wild men ga1e them mots and fish
to eat, and were so kind as to b'lning down eight slaves
to take back with them, three of whom were men and
five were girls. So they gave their good hosts an axe,
an old key, and a knife, and brought off the slaves in
their boat to the isle. As the chief and his f1iends did
not care to wed the young gi1ls, the five men who had
been the e1ew of Paul's ship dre11 lots fo1 choice, so
that each had a wife, and the tlnee men slaves were
set to work for the two good men, though there was
not much for them to do.

But one of them ran off to the woods, and they could
not hear of him more. They had good cause to think
that he found his way home, as in three or four weeks
some wild men came to the isle, and when they had
had their feast and dance, they went off in two days'
time. So my friends might well fear that if this slave
got safe home, he would Dbe sure to tell the wild men
that they 11 ere in the isle, and in what part of it they
might be found And so it came to pass, for 111 less
than two months, six boats of wild men, with eight or
ten men in each boat, came to the north side of the
isle, where they had not been known to come up to
that time.

The fee had brought their boats to land, not more
than a mile from the tent of the two good men, and it
was there that the slave who had run off had been kept.
These men had the (reed luck to see the boats when
they were a long way 03' so that it took them quite
an hour f1om that time to reach the show.
My friends now had to think how that hour was to
be spent. The first thing they (lid was to bind the two
slaves that were left, and to take their wives, and as
much of their stores as they could, to some dark place
in the woods. They then sent a third slave to the chief
and his men, to tell them the news, and to ask for help.

They had not gone far in the woods, when they saw,
to their great grief and rage, that their huts were in
flames, and that the wild men ran to and fro, like beasts
in search of prey. But still our men went on, and did
not halt, till they came to a thick part of the wood,
where the large trunk of an old tree stood, and in this
tree they both took their post. But they had not been
there long, when two of the wild men ran that way,
and they saw three more, and then five more, who all
ran the same way, as if they knew where they were.

Our two poor men made up their minds to let the
first two pass, and then take the three and the five in
line, as they came up, but to fire at one at a time, as
the first shot might chance to hit all three.

So the man who was to fire put three or four balls
in his gun, and from a hole in the tree, took a sure aim,
and stood still till the three wild men came so near that
he could not miss them. They soon saw that one of
these three was the slave that had fled from them, as
they both knew lnm well, and they made up their
minds that they would kill him, though they should
both fire.
At the first shot two of the wild men fell dead, and
the third had a graze on his arm, and though not much
hurt, sat down on the ground with loud screams and
yells. When the five men who came next, heard the
sound of the gun and the slave's cries, they stood still
at first, as if they were struck dumb with fright. So
our two men both shot off their guns in the midst of
them, and then ian up and bound them safe with cords.

They then went to the thick part of the wood where
they had put their wives and slaves, to see if all were
safe there, and to their joy they found that though the
wild men had been quite near them, they had not found
them out. While they were here, the chief and his
men came up, and told them that the rest had gone to
take care of my old house and grove, in case the troop
of Wild men should spread so far that way.

They then went back to the burnt huts, and when
they came in sight of the shore, they found that their
fees had all gone out to sea. So they set to work to
build up their huts, and as all the men in the isle lent
them their aid, they were soon in a way to thrive once
more. For five or six months they saw no more of
the wild men. But one day a large fleet of more than
a. score of boats came in sight, full of men who had
bows, darts, clubs, swords, and such like arms of war,
and our friends were all in great fear.

As they came at dusk, and at the East side of the
isle, our men had the whole night to think of what they
should do. And as they knew that the most safe way
was to hide and lie 111 wait, they first of' all took down
the huts which were built fo1 the two good men, and
drme thei1 goats to the cave, for they thought the u 1ld
men would go straight there as soon as it was day, and
play the old game.

The next day they took up thei1 post with all their
force at the wood, near the home of the two men, to
wait for the foe. They gave no guns to the slaves, but
each of them had a long staff with a spike at the end
of it, and by his side an axe. There were two of the
wives who could not be kept back, but would go out
and fight with bows and darts.

The wild men came on with a bold and fierce mien,
not in a line, but all in crowds here and there, to the
point were our men lay in wait for them. When they
were so near as to be in range of the guns, our men
shot at them right and left, with five or six balls in each
charge. As the foe came up in close crowds, they fell
dead on all sides, and most of those that they did not
kill were much hurt, so that great fear and dread came
on them all.

Our men then fell 011 them from three points with
the butt end of their guns, swords, and stavcs, and did
their work so well that the wild men set 11p a loud
shriek, and flew for their lives to the woods and hills,
with all the speed that fear and swift feet could help
them to do. As our men did not care to chase them,Crusoe's Tlip through China.
they got to the shore where they had come to land
and where the boats lay.

But their rout was not yet at an end, for it blew a
great storm that day from the sea, so that they could
not put off. And as the storm went on all that night,
when the tide came up, the surge of the sea drove most
of their boats so high on the shore, that they could not
be got off save with great toil, and the force of the
waves on the beach broke some of them to bits.

At break of (lay, our men went forth to find them,
and when they saw the state of things, they got some
dry wood from a dead tree, and set their boats on fire.
When the foe saw this, they ran all through the isle
with loud cries, as if they were mad, so that our men
did not know at first what to do with them, for they
trod all the corn down with their feet, and tore up the
vines just as the grapes were ripe, and did a great
deal of harm.

At last they brought old Jaf to them, to tell them
now kind they would be to them, that they would save
their lives, and give them part of the isle to live in, if
they would keep in their own bounds, and that they
should have com to plant, and should make it grow
for their bread. They were but too glad to have such
good terms of peace, and they soon learnt to make all
kinds of work with canes, wood, and sticks, such as
chairs, stools, and beds, and this they did with great
skill when they were once taught.
From this time till I came back to the isle 1111' friends
saw no more wild men. I now told the chief that I
had not come to take off his men, but to bung mom,
and to give them all such things as they would want
to guard their homes from foes, and cheer up their
hearts.

The next day I made a grand feast for them all, and
the ship's cook and mate came 011 shore to dress it.
We brought out our rounds of salt beef and pork, a
bowl of punch, some beer, and French wines; and
Carl gave the cooks five whole kids to roast, three
of which were sent to the crew 011 board ship, that
they, on their part, might feast on fresh meat from
shore.

I gave each of the men a shi1t, a coat, a hat, and a
pair of shoes, and I need not say ho11 "lad thev 11ere
to meet 111th gifts so new to them Then I brought
out the tools, of which each man had a spade, a rake,
an axe, a crow, a saw, a knife, and such like things, as
well as arms, and all that they could want for the
use of them.

As I sa11 there "as a kind 11 ill 011 all sides, I now
took on sho1e the youth and the maid whom 110 had
brought from the ship that 110 met on her 112w to
France The ghl had been 11011 brought up, and all
the crew had a Dgood word for her. As they both had
a wish to be left on the isle, I gave them each a plot
of ground, 011 wlueh they had tents and barns built.
I had brought out with me five men to live here, one
of whom could turn his hand to all sorts of things, so
I gave him the name of "Jack of all Trades."

One day the F1ench p1iest came to ask if I would
lea1e my man F1iday hole, for tlnough him, he said, he
could talk to the black men in then own tououe,i1nd
teaeh them the things of God " Need I 11111, "a said he,
"that it was for this cause that I came he1e "E " I felt
that I could not pa1t with my man F1iday ['01 the whole
w01ld, so I told the p1iest that it I could have made
11p my mind to lea1e him he1e, I was quite sme that
Friday would not part from me.

When I had seen that all things were in a good state
011 the isle, I set to work to put my ship to rights, to
go home once more. One (lay, as I was on my way
to it, the youth whom I had brought from the ship that
was burnt, :11me 11p to me, and said, "Sir, you have
brought a priest with you, and while you are here, we
want him to wed two of us."

I made a guess that one of these must be the maid
that I had bought to the isle, and that it was the wish
of the young man to make 1101 his wife. I spoke to
him with some wa1u1th 111 my tone, and bade him tum
it well 111 his mind fiist, as the gill was not in the same
rank of life as he had been brought 11p in. But he
said, with a smile, that I had made a wrong guess,
for it was "Jack of all Trades" that he had come to
plead for.
It gave me great joy to hear this, as the maid was
as good a girl as could be, and I thought well of Jack.
so on that day I gave her to him. They were to have
a large piece of ground to grow their crops on, with a
house to live in, and sheds for their goats.

The isle was now set out in this way: all the west
end was left waste, so that if the wild men should land
on it, they might come and go, and hurt no one. My
old house I gave to the chief, with all its woods, which
now spread out as far as the creek, and the south end
was for the white men and their wives.

It struck me that there was one gift which I had
not thought of, and that was the book of God's Word,
which I knew would give to those who could feel the
words in it, fresh strength for their work, and grace to
bear the ills of life.

Now that I had been in the isle quite a month,I
once more set sail on the fifth day of May; and all my
friends told me that they should stay there till I came
to fetch them.

When we had been out three days, though the sea
was smooth and calm, we saw that it was quite black
on the land side; and as we knew not what to make
of it, I sent the chief mate up the main mast to find
out with his glass what it could be. He said it was a
fleet of scores and scores of small boats, full of wild
men who came fast at us with fierce looks.

As soon as we got near them, I gave word to furl
all sails and stop the ship, and as there was nought to
fear from them but fire, to get the boats out and man
them both well, and so wait for them to come up.

In this way we lay by for them, and in a short time
they came up with us; but as I thought they would
t1y to row round and so close 11s in, I told the men in
the boats not to let them come too near. This, though
we did not mean it, brought us to a tight with them,
and they shot a cloud of darts at our boats. We did
not fire at them, yet in half an hour they went back
out to sea, and then came straight to us, till we were
so near that they could hear us speak.

I bade my men keep close, so as to be safe from
their da1ts if they should shoot, and get out the guns.
I then sent Friday on deck, to call out to them in their
own tongue, and ask what they meant. It may be
that they did not know what he said, but as soon as
he spoke to them I heard him cry out that they would
sheet. This was too true, for they let fly a thick cloud
of (huts, and to my greatg nriet poor F1ida) fell dead,
for them 11 as no one else in their sight lie 11 as shot
with three darts, and three more fell quite near him,
so good was their aim.

I was so mad with rage at the loss of my dear Fri--
day, that I bade the men load five guns with small
shot, and four with large, and we gave them such a
fierce fire that in all their lives they could not have
seen one like it.
Then a rare scene met our eyes: dread and fear came
on them all, for their boats, which were small, were
split and sunk--three or four by one shot. The men
who were not dead had to swim, and those who
had wounds were left to sink, for all the rest got off
as fast as they could. Our boat took up one poor
man who had to swim for his life, when the rest had
fled for the space of half an hour. In three hours'
time, we could not see more than three or four of their
boats, and as a breeze sprang up we set sail.

At first the man whom we took on board would not
eat or speak, and we all had fears lest he should pine
to death. But when we had taught him to say a few
words, he told us that his friends--the wild men--had
come out with their king to have a great fight, and that
all they meant was to make us look at the grand sight.
So it was for this that poor Friday felll He who had
been as good and true to me as man could be! And
now in deep grief I must take my leave of him.

We went on with a lair wind to All Saints' Bay, and
here I found a sloop that I had brought with me from
home, that I might send men and stores for the use of
my friends in the isle. I taught the mate how to find
the place, and when he came back, I found that he
had done so with ease.

One of our crew had a great wish to go with the
sloop, and live on the isle, if the chief would give him
land to plant. So I told him he should go by all
means, and gave him the wild man for his slave. I
found, too, that a man who had come with his wife
and child and three slaves, to hide from the king of
Spain, would like to go, if he could have some land
there, though he had but a small stock to take with
him; so I put them all on board the sloop, and saw
them safe out of the bay, on their way to the isle.
With them I sent three milch cows, five calves, a horse,
and a colt, all of which, as I heard, went safe and
sound.

I have 110w no more to say of my isle, as I had left
it for the last time, but my life in lauds no less far from
home was not yet at an end. From the Bay of All
Saints we went straight to the Cape of Good Hope.
Here I made up my miml'to part from the ship in
which I had come from the Isle, and with two of the
crew to stay on land, and leave the rest to go on their
way. I soon made friends with some men from Fance,
as well as from my own land, and two Jews, who had
come out to the Cape to tlade.

As I found that some goods which 1 had brought
with me from home were worth a great deal,l made
a large sum by the sale of them. When we had
been at the Cape of Good Hope for nine months, we
thought that the best thing we could do would be to
hire a ship, and sail to the Spice Isles, to buy cloves,
so we got a ship, and men to work her, and set out.
When we had bought and sold our goods in the course
of trade, we came back, and then set out once more;
so that, in short, as we went from port to port, to and
fro, I spent, from fi1st to last, six years in this part
of the world.

At length we thought we would go and seek new
scenes where we could get fresh gains. And a strange
set of men we at last fell in with, as you who read
this tale will say when you look at the print in front
of page 86.

When we had put on shore, we made friends with a
man who got 11s a large house, built with canes, and
a small kind of hut of the same near it. It had a high
fence 0f canes round it to keep out thieves, of whom,
it seems, there are not a few in that land. The name
of the town was Ching, and we found that the fair or
mart which was kept there would not be held for three
01' four months. So we sent 0111' ship back to the Cape,
as we meant to stay in this part of the world for some
time, and go from place to place to see what sort of a
land it was, and then come back to the fair at Ching.

W 0 first went to a. town which it was well 11"o1th
our while to see, and which must l1a1e been as near
as I can guess, quite in the hemt of this land It was
built with straight streets which ran in cross lines.

But I must own, when I came home to the place of
my bi1th, I was much struck to hear my friends say
such fine things of the wealth and trade of these parts
of the world {for I saw and knew that the men 11 010
a mere herd or crowd of mean slaves. What is their
trade to ours, or to that of France and Spain? What
are their ports, with a few junks and barks, to our
grand fleets '? One of our large ships of war would
sink all their ships, one line of French troops would
beat all their horse, and the same may be said of their
ports, which would not stand for one month such a
siege as we could bring to bear on them.

In three weeks more we came to their chief town.
When we had laid in a large stock of tea, shawls, fans,
raw silks, and such like goods, we set out for the north.
As we knew we should run all kinds of risks 011 our
way, we took with us a strong force to act as a guard,
and to keep us from the wild hordes who rove from
place to place all through the land. Some of our men
were Scots, who had come out to trade here, and had
great wealth, and I was glad to join them, as it was
by no means the first time that they had been here.

We took five guides with us, and we all put our coin
in one pmse, to buy food on the way, and to pay the
men who took charge of us. One of us we chose out
for our chief, to take the lead in case we should have
to fight for our lives; and when the time came, we had
no small need of him. ()11 the sides of all the roads,
we saw men who made pots, cups, pans, and such like
ware, out of a kind of earth, which is, in fact, the chief
trade in this part of the world.

One thing, the guide said he would show me,
was not to be seen in all the world else (and this, in
good soot,h I could not sneer at, as I had done at most
of the things I had seen here), and this 11 as a house that
was built of a kind of ware, such as most plates and
cups are made of. "How big is it?" said I; "can we
take it 011 the back of a horse?" " 011 a horse!" said
the guide, " 11111! two sco1e of men li1e 111 it." He then
took us to it, and I found that it was in truth a large
house, built with lath and the best 11a1e that can be
made, out of earth. The sun shone hot 011 the walls,
which were quite white, hard, and smooth as glass, with
forms on them in blue paint. 011 the walls of the
rooms were small square tiles of the best ware, with
red, blue, and green paint of all shades and hues, in
rare forms, done in good taste; and as they use the
same kind of earth to join the tiles with, you could
not see where the tiles met. The floors of the rooms
were made of the same ware, and as strong as those
we have at home; and the same maybe said of the
roofs, but they were of a dark shade. If we had had
more time to spare, I should have been glad to have
seen more of this house, for there were the ponds
for the fish, the walks, the yards, and courts, Wl]l('ll
were all made in the same way. This odd sight kept
me from my friends for two hours, and when I had
come 11p to them, I had to pay a fine to our chief, as
they had to wait so long.

In two days more we came to the Great Wall, which
was made as a fort to keep the whole land safe,--and
a great work it is. It goes in a long track for miles
and miles, where the rocks are so high and steep that
no foe could climb them; or, if they did, no wall could
stop them. The Great Wall is as thick as it is high,
and it turns and winds in all sorts of ways.

We now saw, for the first time, some troops of the
hordes I spoke of, who rove from place to place, to rob
and kill all whom they meet with. They know no real
mode of war, or skill in fight. Each has a poor lean
horse, which is not fit to do good work. Our chief
gave some of us leave to go out and hunt as they call
it, and what was it but to hunt sheep! These sheep
are wild and swift of foot, but they will not run far.
and you are sure of sport when you start in the chase.
They go in flocks of a score, or two, and like true
sheep, keep close when they fly. In this sort of chase
it was our hap to meet with some two score of the wild
hordes, but what sort of prey they had come to hunt I
know not. As soon as they saw us, one of them blew
some loud notes on a kind of horn, with a sound that
was quite new to me. We all thought this was to call
their friends round them, and so it was, for in a short
time a fresh troop of the same size came to join them;
and they were all, as far as we could judge, a mile ofl'.
One of the Scots was with us, and as soon as he heard
the horn, he told us that we must lose no time, but
draw up in line, and charge them at once. We told
him we would, if he would take the lead.

They stood still, and cast a wild gaze at us, like a
mere crowd, drawn 11p in no line; but as soon as they
saw us come at them, they let lly their dalts, which
did not hit us, for though their aim was t1ue, they fell
short of us. We 110w came to a halt to lire at them,
and then went at full speed to fall 011 them sword in
hand, for so the bold Scot that led us, told us to do.

As soon as we came 11p to them, they [led right and
left. The sole stand made was by three of them, who
had a kind of short sword in their hands, and bows 011
their backs, and who (lid all they could to call all the
rest back to them. The have Scot rode close up to
them, and with his 11110 tlnew one off his holse, shot the
next, and the third 11111 off, and this was the end of our
fight. All the bad luck we met with, was that the
sheep that we had in chase got off. We had not a
man hurt, but as for the foe, five of them were dead,
and not a few had wounds, while the rest fled at the
mere noise of our guns.

Thus we went on our way from town to town, and
110w and then met some of these wild hordes, whom
we had to fiO'ht, and I need not add that each time we
had the best of the fra1'. At last 110 made our way
to the chief to1111of' the North Seas at the end of a
year, five months and three days, from the time when
we left Ching. When I had been there six weeks, and
had bought some more goods, I took ship and set sail
for the land of my birth, which I had left, this time,
for ten yams, nine months and three days.

And now I must bring this tale of my life to a close,
while at the age of three score years and twelve, I feel
that the day is at hand, when I shall go forth on that
sea of peace and love, which has no waves or shores
but those of bliss that knoWs no end.
