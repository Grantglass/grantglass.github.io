OBINSON CRUSOI'Z.
still a mere boy, was seized
with a great desire to go to sea. llis
parents would not consent to let him
go, but his mind was so set upon going
that at the first chance he ran away
from home, and went to a seaport,
where he applied to the captain of a
ship to let him go on a voyage and
learn to be a sailor.

The captain took a fancy to him,
and granted his wish. Robinson
Crusoe made several voyages, and
went through many adventures with-
out serious ill-luck, until he became
a young man. Finally he embarked
on a ship that was sailing to Africa.
A great storm came up before they
were out many days, and the ship was
driven on some rocks near the coast
ofa strange island, and wrecked. 'l'he
sailors, being cast into the waves, tried
to swim ashore, but all were drowned
except Robinson Crusoe. He was
thrown upon the beach nearly dead,
and lay for a long time senseless.

""hen he came to, and found him-
self able to walk, he went to the top
ofa hill which he saw near by. From

. there he could see that he was on a

small island, which seemed to be
fentirely without human inhabitants.
When he realized the awful situation

,. ' in which he was placed, all by himself

on this lonely island, to which ships
probably never came, and from which
there was little hope that he could

ever escape. he was filled with despair,
and he almost wished that he had
died with his shipmatcs. But other
thoughts soon came to his mind. He
remembered how he had disobeycd
his parents, and caused them great
sorrow by running away to sea.
felt that his fate was no better than he
deserved, and he fell on his knees to
ask God's pardon, and to thank him
for sparing his life.

Night came on soon. and he climbed
into a tree to sleep, for he did not
know but that there might be (lan-
gerous animals on the island. \Vhen
he woke in the morning, the sky was
clear and the sea calm. The ship had

become llnl)t:(l(lc(l in the sand, and
when the tide went down he was able
to swim out to it. He found that the
stores of food aboard were unharmed,
'and he set about getting them ashore.
He made a raft out of some planks.

. and with it was able to bring small

loads safe to land. Besides the food,

. he secured a lot of tools, and some

guns and other weapons, along with a
supply of powder and shot.

Robinson Crusoe's next task was
to contrive some sort of safe dwelling-
placc. He found a small cave in the
side ofa hill. and was able to enlarge

it so that it made a good-sized room, l
Around the entrance he drove a row .
of piles, to get over which it wasl
necessary to use a ladder. \Vhen he
had every thing complete, he felt so
safe in the place that he called it his
castle.

After it was finished, Robinson
Crusoe applied himself to making
other things that Would add to his
comfort, particularly a table and chair.
He had never learned to handle'
tools, so it took him a long time to
finish these things, and when they
were done they were very rude in
looks, although quite as useful as if
they had been handsome:

In the meantime, he frequently
went about the island with his gun,
and often shot birds and wild goats,
whose flesh he used for food. On
one of his ramhles, he caught a parrot
alive, and he made a pet of it, and
taught it to speak a few words. He
had also the company of a dog and
two cats that had heen aboard the
ship, and the presence of these creat-
ures often served to make him forget
his loneliness.

One day he shot a she-goat that had
a young kid with her. The kid did
not run away when he went to take
up the body of its mother, but followed
him to his castle. Robinson Crusoe
fed it, and it became quite tame.
This suggested the idea to him that

 

mums A non.
it would be well to capture some more
young goats and let them breed a
flock, so that he might have a steady
supply of meat without wasting his
stock of powder and shot. He set
traps. and caught several, and en-
closed a, piece of ground for them to
run in. In course of time he had a
large flock, that furnished him with
milk as well as meat, and clothing
besides; for he was able to make
rough garments out of their skins.
Another idea over which Robin-
son Crusoe brooded for a long time
was the making of a canoe out of the
trunk of a tree. He set to work at

last upon the task, and with a great ,

deal of labor cut down a large tree
and shaped a boat out of it. "lith
this he was able to make trips around
the island when the sea was calm, and
to explore all the inlets with which
the coast was indented.

After many years had passed, Rob-
inson Crusoe was alarmed one day to
see some prints of naked feet in the
sand on the shore.

civilized being, he felt only fear at the
sight of these tracks, for he knew they
must be those of savages. Not long

{ after, when he went out one morning,

he saw smoke at a distance, and steal-
ing up under the shelter ofsome trees,
he saw a lot of savages, who had come
to the island in canoes, gathered
about a fire. His horror was very
great when he saw them kill one of
two men who lay bound on the ground,
and then place the body on the fire
to cook, with the evident intention of
eating it. \Vhile they were busy, the
other prisoner managed to get loose
I from his bonds, and started to run.
{ Robinson Crusoe was in terror when
j he saw that he was coming straight
l toward him. But he made up his
mind to try to save him, and when
those who were after him came near
enough, he fired his gun at them.

One was killed, and the rest were
so terrified by the noise of the gun
that they turned about and ran to their
canoes, in which they all paddled
away.

The esca )ed ca )tive then came and

fell on his knees before his rescuer.
Crusoe made signs to show that he
had nothing to fear, and took him
home with him to his castle. By
degrees he taught the poor fellow to
speak a little English, and he gave

him the name of Friday, because it

was on that day he had S:l\.'c(l his life.
Robinson Crusoe went to great
pains to break Friday of his savage

' habits, and civilize him, and he proved
to be so apt and well-disposed that he
became a very pleasant companion, as
well as a useful, handy servant. He
was very grateful to Robinson Crusoe
for s ving his life, and at first, before
the nature of fire-arms was explained
to him, he amused his master by
showing an almost equal degree of
gratitude towards the gun that had
been the means of his rescue. He
thought that it had life, and he often
used to go on his knees to it to show
how thankful he was.

Robinson Crusoe feared that the
island might be visited again by the
,' savages, but nearly two years passed
_ during which none appeared, and he
. had almost ceased to be troubled about

them, until one morning when
Friday, having gone out alone
early, came running back to
the castle in great fright. to tell
that a great number of sava-
ges had come to the island
in canoes, bringing with them
some captives whom they had
begun to kill and eat. Rob-
inson Crusoe armed himself
and Friday, and both went to

attack the savages. As soon
as they came near enough, they
fired amongst them and killed
several. The rest were thrown
into such a state of wild terror
that they ran for their canoes and
made off, leaving lying on thei
ground a bound prisoner whom
they had not yet killed. Robin--
son Crusoe went to this captive
to release him from his bonds,
and saw that he was. a white man.
In the meanwhile Friday had
gone to one of the canoes which
the savages had left behind, and
found another captive. This was
an old man. and as soon as Friday
looked in his face, he went into a trans-
port of joy. and embraced and kissed
him. Robinson Crusoe came up just

then, and asked Friday in the great- .

est astonishment why he acted in this
It was some time before
Friday could speak, so great was his
joy: but at length he told his master
that this poor old man, whose life they
had saved, was his father.

Robinson Crusoe found out that
the white man was a Spaniard who
had been shipwrecked, along with
sixteen others, on the mainland, from
where the savages came. Robinson

l Crusoe asked him if he (lid not think

to his island, that all might live to-

sure they would. 50 it was settled
that a large boat should be made, and
that the Spaniard should go with it
for his countrymen, taking Friday's
father along with him. The boat was
a long time making, but at length
everything was ready, and they set
sail for the mainland.

with Friday, Robinson Crusoe saw
that it was an English ship, and that a
boat was coming from it to the shore.
He thought it would not be wise. to
show himself until he knew the object
of the visit, and it was well that he
was so prudent.

Eleven men landed from the boat,
and Robinson Crusoe saw that three

, English. they answered his questions
and he found that one was the captain
of the ship, an 1 the others the mates,
that there had been a mutiny on the
part of the sailors. and that the men
were going to leave them on the island
and sail away with the ship.
Robinson Crusoe offered to help
the captain to recover his ship. if he
would agree to carry himself and
Friday to England in case they suc-
ceeded, and the captain gladly prom>>

and when the men returned, shot
two. who, the captain said, were lead-
ers in the mischief. The others. taken
by surprise, cried out for pardon. This
the captain granted on condition that
they would swear to assist him in re-
covering the ship, and they all did so.
It was decided to wait until dark
before trying to take the ship. Those
on board, not knowing the turn affairs
had taken, were not prepared to resist,
and when the captain had shot the
ringleader of the mutiny, the rest of
the men submitted.
