lSllPREFACE.

m

IF ever the story of "any private man's ad- -

ventures in the world were WOW 1 making
.public, and were acceptable when published,
.the Editor of this account thinks this will
be so.

The wonders of this man's life exceed all

that (he thinks) is to be found extant ;_tl1ei;

life of One man being scarce capable of a
greater variety.

The story is told with modesty, with scri- '

ousness, and with a religious application of
events, to the uses to which wise men always

apply them, viz. to the instruction ofothers,
by this example, and to justify and honour _
the wisdom of Providence in all the variety .,

of our circumstances, let tl. em happen; how--
they will. _ ' .' '--. .v ,_ PREFACE. - t

The Editor believes this narrative to be a
just history of: fact; neither is there any ap-
pearance of fiction in it; and though he is
well aware there are many who, on. account
of the very singular pre'servations the Author
met with, will give it the name of romance;
yet, in which ever of these lights it shall be
viewed, he imagines, that the improvement
of it, as well as the diversion, as to the in-

struction of the reader, will be the same,
and as such, he thinks, without farther

compliment to the world, he does thema
great service in the publication.'rrrr-z'

ROBINSON CRUSOE.

-

I was born _at York, in the year 1632, of a reputable fa-
'mily. My father was a native of Bremen, who by mer-
chandizing at Hall for fame lime, gained a very plentiful
fortune. He married my mather at York, who received
her firft breath in that countr -; and as her maiden nanie
was Rob'infon, .I was called Rogi'nfin Kr'mtznaer; which not -
being ,eafil pronounced in the En'glilh tongue, we are
commonly nown by the name ofL'rul'oe. ' ' ' '

I made In my dillrefs: and whenever any refieetions would
return on me, what by company, and what by drinking, 1;
foon mallered thofe fits, as I deridingly called them; But
this only made way for another trial, whereby I could not
but fee how mvcn I was beholden to kind Providence. '
Upon the fixrh day .we came to an anchor in Harwich
road, where we lay wind- bound with {orne Newcaltle {hips ,
I and there being good anchorage, and our cables found, the
-. - feamen forgot their late toil and danger, and fp cm the time
as merry as if they had been on there. But on the eighth day
there arofe a brilk gale of wind, is hich prevented our tidirg
it up the river , and liill increaling, cur {hip rode forecallle
it), and {hipped leveral large fess.

It was not long before horror feized the feamen them-
felves, and I heard the matter (\'prefs this melancholv
ejaculation, " I ord have mercy upon us, we (hall be all loll
and urtdOr.e!"~ For my part,fick-unto death, I kept my cabin,
till the univerfal and terribly dreadful apprehenfions of our
fpeedy fate made me ge: upon deck; and there I was af-
frighted indeed. The fea went mountains high; I could .
fee .nOthicg but dilirefs around us , two {hips had- cut their '
malls cn b ard, and another was foundered , two more that
had loft their anchors, were forced out to the mercy of the
ocean: and to {are tur lives we were forced to cut our '
forcmafl and mainmafl quite awzy.

Who is there fo ignorant as no: to judge of my dreadful '
condition? I was but a frefh-wa er tailor, and therefore it
feemed more terrible. Our {hip was very good, but over.- .
loaded ; which made the failors often cry out, " She would
" founder ' ' \Verds I then was ignorant of. All this while 1';
the llorm continuing, and rather increafing, the matter and
the melt tote:- pert of his men went to prayers, expee'ting
death every moment. In the middle of the night one cried.
out, "We had I prong a leak. "' ancther, " That- there were
" four feet water in the hold. "' I was jull: ready to expire
w th fear, when immediately all hands were called to the

of wce, nobody minded me, excepting to thrufl me alide
with their feet, thir.k'ng me dead, and it was a great while
before I reeovzred.

Happy it was for us, when upon the figeal given, they
yen-tired out their boats to fave our lives. All our pumping
had been in van, ard vain had all our attempts been, hadthey
not come to our lhip's fide,an(l cur men call them a rape over
the liern "iii a buoy 'o it, wh'c'n after great labour they got
hold of, and we hauling them up to us, got into their boat,
and left our lhip, which we perceived link within lel'than a
quartrr of an bent; and thus I learned wlzat was meant by
fburm'erirzg at fia. Anl now the men inceliantly laboured to
recover their own lhip; but the (:3 ran la high, and the wind
blew :'3 hard, that they thought it convenient (0 hale within
lhore; which, with reat difiicu'ty and danger, at lalt we
happily efi'ee'ted, langing at a place called Cromer, nOt fat"
from \'Vi'lt'rlt'n ligestohoufc; From a hence we all walked to
.an.nou:h, where as objeets of pity, many good people fur-
niihed us with nectll'aries to car ry us either to Hull or London.

Strange, after all this, l-ke tae prodigal (0:, I did not re-
turn to my father; who hearing of the lhip's calamity, for a
long tine thought me mouthed in the deep. No doubt
but I lhould have feared on [inferred calf, as the Scripture
exprefl'eth it; but my ill fate llill pulhed me on, in fpite of
the powerful c0izvic'tions of reafon and confc'ience.

When we had been at Yarm-tuth three days, [met my
old companion, who had given me the invitation to go on
board a'ong witn his {amt-r. His behaviour and lpeech
were aimed, and in a melancholy manner alked me how I
did, telling his lather who I was, and how l had made this
volt-age. Only {or a Niel to pr: ceeo' further abroad. Upon

' I thought 'at full to return home; but lhamepppofed than
good motion, as thinking 1 lhould be laughed at by my neigh-
bmrs and acquaintance. S) flrange is the nature of youth..
who are not a:hame3' to fin, but yet afhamed to repent; and.
{0 far- from being alhamed of thofe ae'tions for which they
may be accounted fools, they think it folly to return to their
duty, which is the principal mark of wifdom. In ihon, I
travelled up to London, refolving upon avoyagc ; and a
voyage. I {can heard of, by my acquaintance wim'a captain
who took a fancy to me, to go to the coaft cf Guinea. Haw--
ing . fomc money, and appearing like a gentleman, ,l went.
on board, not as a common {ailor cr foremaii nun; nay.
the commander agreed I lhould go that voyage with him
without any rxpeni'e; that I [hould'be his mefs'mate and
companion, and! was very welcome to Carry any thing,
withme, ard make the bell meichandife I could.~ .

_ I blefl'ed my happy fortune, ard humblythanked niy cap-'

indeed this. voyage made me both.a fai!orxand_a merchant;
for I brought home five pounds nine ounces- of gold dutt {on

who was an hcnelt gent! ewoman, ) yet my misfortunes in
this unhappy voyage were very grea'. For cur {hip failing
toixards tne Canary iflands, we were chafed by a Sale 0

ing. 1 as much canvas as our yards could fpread, or our malls

Ielves to fight. Thev had eighteen guns, and we had but
tweivet About three in the afternoon there was a defp erale
engagtment. wherein many were killed and woundped on

both {ides ; but finding curfclves overpowered with num-
bers, cur lhip difablett, and curfew. es (0:1 impotent to have
the knit hopes offuccers, we weie forced to 1'urrender; and
accordingly were all carried prifoners in o the port of Sal ee.
0111' men were tent to the Emperor' s court to be fold there ;-
but the pirate cap at 11 takin'r notice of me, kept me. to be
his own flave.

In this condition, I thought myfclf the molt miferable
creature on cart!1,ar.d the crephecy ofmy father came afrefh
into my thcug his. However, my condition was better than
I thoughtit to' e, as will (can appear. Some hepes indeed

me with a Moor, vi 10 w 3 one o. hts kinfzrcn, and the Mo-
reico ycut'i; to catch a (iiilt of hen to: him.

One morning, as we were at the (port, there arofe fuch
a thick tag, that weloit fight of the fho:e; and towing .we'or Mormon causes. ' ll

knew not which way, we laboured allithe night,'and in tie
morning found ourfelves in the ocean, two leagues from .
lan'd.- However, weatttired there at iergth, and made the _
greater hafie, becaufe our fiomaehs were exestedingly {harp
and hungry. In order to prevent itch difafiers for the
future, my patron ordered a carpenter to build a little. (late-
room of cabin in the middle of the long-boat, with a place
behind it- to [tear and. hale hbme the main fiieet, with other
conveniences to keep in from the weather ; as alfolockers !0
put in all manner of provilicns, With a handfomc fizculder

' In this he frequently Locke's out afifhing; and one time
inviting two'or three perfons of-diiiia Etion to go with him,-
made proviiions exuaordinary, providing ah'o three .'ufces.
with powder and lhor, that they might have fore (port at. .
fowling along the. {ea-coal}. The next morning the boat
was' made clean, her ancient and pendants out, and every-
thing r.eady ; but their minds altering. my patron order-<<d
its, to go a tithing, for that his gueiis would certainly {up
with him that night. '
~And now 1 beggn to think of my deliverance indeed. In
order to this I perfuaded the Moor to get {omc provifions
on board, as not daring to meddle with our-patron's;' and
he taking my advice, we fiored onrieives with ruflt bifcuit,
and three jars of water. Eelidee, I privately conveyed
into the boat a bottle of brandy, fome twine. thread', a ham-t
mer, hatchet, and a fawn; and, in partieulzr, {cme bees-wax,-
which was a. great comfort to me, and ierved to make can--
dles. Ithsn perfuaded Muley (for {0 was the Moor called)'
to Free-are {lame powder and lhot, pretending to kiil-{ea cur-
- Icws, which he innocently an: readiiy agreed to. In fhort,
being provided with ail things necefi'ary, we faifechout, re-
fclving for my own part to make my emerge, though it lh'ould.

\Vhen 'we had pafl'ed the calile, we fell afiihing; but
though I'ltnew the-re was a bite, l difi'cmbied the matter, in '
order to put out further to (eat. Accordingly we ran a league
further; when giving the irov (heiselm, and pr; ending to

him overboard. _As he w>>, s an excellent fivirhrner, he {oon'

Early one morning we came to an anchor under a little

Accordingly locking whee he painted, I e-{pied a fearful
monl'ter indeed. it was a terrihle great lion that lay on

"Xury," {aid I, " You ihall go on (bore and kill him." But
the boy leaking--amazed: "Me kiil him i" lays he, " he eat

I [hot him. through the head, and then he lay iiruggling for

go on 'lho:e. ",Go then," {aid l. Upon which taking a.
little gun in one hand, he {.vam to {here with the other, and
coming clol'e to the lion, put a period to his life lay-{hosting
him again through the head. ' ' ~-

But this was lit-endingour'amtrunitiuzn in vain, the flelh
not being good to eat. Xury was like a champion,.and
comes on board 5 r a hatch-ct. to cut of? the head of his ene-

brought me a foot. I bethi t-ght me, however, that his {kin

were black and fiark naked. I was incline-i to go on ihore,
but Xury cried, " No, no ;" however, I approached nearer,
and I found they run along the lhore by me a good way. '
They had no weapons in their hands, except one, who held '
a long flick, which Xury told me was a lace, with which
they could kill at a great dillance. I talked to themibyiigns,' -
and made them fenfible Iwanted {omething to.eat; they
beckoned me to flop my'boat, while two of them ran up
into the country, and in lefs than half an hour came baclt,

Having a pleafant voyage to the Brazils. we arrived in

. two days after. . And here I cannot forget the'g'eneroua
. treatment. of the captain. He would take nothing for' my
pafl'age', gave me twenty drama {or the leopard'a lkin,;and
' thirty for the lion's. Every thing he'caufed to be delivered,
and what I would (till he bought. In (hurt I made about
220 pieces of my cargo; and with this {tack I entere
'once more, as I may fay, into the {cene of life. ' ' .

Being recommended to an honeli planter, I lived with
him till fuch time as l was informed of the manner; Of their
planting and making fugar; and feeing' how well they
lived, and how fuddenly they grew rich, I was filled witha'
delire to fettle ameng them, and refolved to get my money
remitted to me, and to pnrc'hafe a plantation. .

To be brief, I bought a {ettlement next door to an] honefl':
and kind. neighbour, born at Lilbon, of Englilh parents,
whole plantation joining to mine, we improved it very amio~
cably together, Both our tloclts were low, and for two
years we planted only for food: but the third year we _,._

I found how much I wanted allillance, and repeated the

my mind; and I nfed to alk myfelf, if what I fought <<Ira/s f
5 Only a middle Ration of life, why cduld it act as well- be ob- ' '
i tained in England as here ? When I pondered on this with
regret, the thoughts of my late deliverance forfoolt me: I
had none to converfe with but my neighbour; no work to be
done but by my own hands ; it often made me fay, myeo'n;
dition was like to that ofa rran caft upon a defolate illand.

And indeed wonderful was his kindnefs towards me; for
he not only procured the money I had 'drawn for upon my
captain's widow, but .'ent me over a fervamith'a cargo
.prcporticnable to my condition. He alfo lent me over
tools of all forts, iron-work, and utentils necefl'srv for my
plantation, which proved to be of the greater: ut'e to me
in my butinefs. '

crOWning my protprroeslabours, i might have-relied happy'

mended ; yet nothing would ccntent me, their was my evil
genius, but I mull leave this happy Ration, for a t'oclilh am-
bition in riiing; and thus, once more, 1 call myfelt' i--to the
greatcll gulf of mifery that ever poor creature fell into.
Having lived {our years in Brazil, I had not only learned
the language, but c'nrric'ied acquai'ntarce with the <<toll
eminent plan=ers, and even the mercrants of St. Salvador;
to whom, once, by way of (lifconrfe, having given account
of my two voyages to the coalt of Guinea, and the manner
of trading there tor mere trifles, by which we furnith our
plantations with negroes, they gave fuch attention to what'I
(aid, that three of them came one morning to me; and told
me they had a fecret prepofal to make. After enjoining me
to {cerecy, (it being an infringement on the powers of the
kings of Porzugal and Spain,) they told me they had a mind

to litrout a {hip to go to Guinea, in order to ll:ck the plan- .

,tation with Negroes, which as they could not be publicly
fold, they would divide among them; and if I would go
their fuper-cargo in the lhip to manage the trading part. _I
lhould have an equal (hare of the Negroes, without prow-
ding' any Rock. The thing indeed was fair enough, had 'I
been in anorner condition. But I was born to be my own
deltroyer, could not refiti the propofal, but accepted the of-'
fer upon condition of their looking after my plantation. 50'
making a formal will, I bequeathed my effects to my g0'0d\
friend the captain, as my univerfal heir; .but obliged him
to difpofe of my effeets as direfled, one half of the produce
to himlelf, and the Other to be {hipped to England. ' -

years I left my father and mother in Ycrklhire. We failed
northward upon the coal't, in order to gain. Africa, till we
made Cape Augullin': ; from whence going farther into the.
ocean out of fight of land, we fleered as {haugh we were
bound for the [lie Fernand de Norenba, leaving the iflands:
on the call ;, and then it was that we tnet with a terrible
tempt-ll, which continued for twelve days fuccefliyely, fo
that the winds carried us wherefoevcr they plea'fed. In this
perplexityrmw of our men died, and one man and a boy
were ttalhed Overboard. When the weather cleared 'up a
little, we found ourfelves in eleven degrees north latitude,upon '
theme." of Guinea. Upon this the captain gave reafons
for returning; which I oppofed, counfelling him to hand
away'for Barbadoes, which. as I fuppnl'ed, might be attained \ .
in fifteen days. So altering our c0urt'e, we failed north-
weii and by well, in order to reach the Leeward iflands;
but a. t'econd'tiorm firccecding, drove us to the Wellward;
{o tirnt we Vth'C juiily afraid of falling into the hands of
Cruel (wages, or the paws ofdevouring beads of prey.

In this great dillrets, one of our men, early in the uiorn-.
iutg, cried out, " Land, land!" which he had no fooner cried
'out, but cur {h'p llruck upon a {and-bank, and in a moment;
the fra broke ovrr her in fuel! a manner, that "we expee'ted.t

~wlh ther an illand or the main, inhabited or not inhabited;
and we could not {0 much as hope that the {hip would hold out ;
many minutes, without breaking in pieces, except the wind"
by a miracle, {houldtturn about immediately" While we;
llood looking at one another, expecting death eyery moment,
the mate lays hold of the boat, and with the help of- the relt'

being eleven of us, committed ourfelVes to God's mercy and

making Tail, we had none; neither if wei'had, could we~
make ule of any. 80 that, when wehad rowed, or rather.
'were driven abouta league and a half, a raging wave, like "
alofty mountain, came rolling a~llern of us, and took us,-
with tech fury, that at once it overfet the boat. Thus being _ .
' {wallowedup in a moment, we had hardly time to call upon
thgretnendous name of God; much lefs to im lore,in dying r
ejaeulations; his infinite mercy to receire'our eparting fouls. ;20 L151! AND novmruaas

Men are generally counted infenfihle when (haggling in
the pangs of death; but while I was Overwhelmed with
water, 1 had' the molt dreadful apprehtnfions imaginable. .
For the joys of heaven and the torments of hell, feetned to'
prefent themfclves before me in thefe dying agonies, and
even fmallfpace of time, as it were, between life and death.
I was going I thought Iknew not whither, into a dif'mai
gulf unknown, and as yet unperceived, never to behold
my friends, nor the light of this world any more ! Could I ~
even have thought of annihilation, or a total ditfolution' of
foul as well as body, the gloomy thoughts of having no far-
ther being. no knowledge of what we hoped for, but an
eternal qu'ienu, without life or fenfe: even that, I fay,
would have been enough to Rrike me with horror and con-_
fulion ! I lirove. however, PS0 the lalt extremity, while all
my companions were overpowered and entombed in the
deep: and it was with great difficulty i kept my breath till
the wave {pent itfelf, and retiring back, left me on the (bore
halfdead with the water I had taken in. As [can as I got
on my feet, I ran as falt as ,I could, left another wave
fhould purfue me, and carry me back again. ' But for all
the hafie I made, I could not 3V0id it : for the [ca came
after me like a high mountain, or furious enemy; {0 that
my bulinefs was to hold my breath, and by raifing myfelf
on the water, preferve it by fw'imming. The next dread-
ful wave buried me at once twenty or thirty feet deep\. but at
the fame time carried me with a mighty force and fwiftnefa.
towards the lhore; when raifing'myfelf, I held out--as well

"as poflible, till at length the water having {pent ite'elf, be-
gan to return, at which I {truck forward, and feeling ground
with my feet I took to my heels again. Thus'being ferved
twice more, [was at length dafhed againlt a piece of rock,
in fuch a manner. as left me fenfelefs; but recoveringa
little before the return of the wave, which, no doubt, would
then have overwhelmed me, I held faft by the rock till thofe
{accreding waves abated; and then fetching anotherrun,
was overtaken by a {mall wave, which was foon conquered.
But before any more could overtake me, I reached the main
lan i, when clambering up the clifts of the fhore, tired and
almoti {pent I fat down on the grafs, free from the dangers
of the foaming ocean. V ' - ' '

No tongue can exprel's the ecflafies and tranfports that. -
my foul felt at the happy deliverance. It was like a reprieve
to a dying malefaflor, with a halter about his neck.and
ready to be turned off. I was wraptup in con'emplatioa,
and often liftednp my hands, with the profoundeft humility,
to the Divine Powers, for faving my life, when the tell of
my companions were all drowned. ' And now I began to
call my eyes around. to behold what placeI was in, and
what [had nut to dn. I could fee no houfe nor people; I
was wet, yet had no clothes to fhil't me ; hungry and lbirfiy, '
yet had nothing to eat or drink; no weapon to deflroy any
creatures for my fufienance, nor defend myfelfagainft de-
vourieg'beafis; in than, I had nothing but a knife, 3
- tobacco pipe, and a box half filled with tobacco. The
darkfome night coming on upOn me, increafed my fears of
being devoured by wild creatures; my mind was plunged
in defpair, and having no profpee't. as I thought, oflife be-
fore me, I prepared for another kind of death than what I
had lately efcaped. ' I walked about a furlong to fee if I
could find any frelh water, which I did to my great joy;
. and taking a quid of tobacco to prevent hunger, I got up
into a thick bulhy tree, and feating myfelt {0 that I could
not fall, a deep 'fleep overtook me, and for that night buried
my fort-ows in a-quiet repofg. . ,
>> .'It was broad day thefnext morning before I awaited-g-
. when I not only perceived the tempeltwas ceafed. but-{aw .
the {hip driven almofi as far as the rock before-mentioned, '
:which the .waves had dafhed ime 'againll', and which. was
about a mile from the place where I was. -When.l came
down from my apartment in the tree, I perceived thelhip's
boat two miles diflant on my <<righohand, lying on (bore, as
thewavcs had cafl her. -I thought to have got to her; but
therebeing an inlet of water of about half a mile's breadth
between it and me, I returnedagain towards the lhipgu
hoping to ,find fomething for my more immediate fublilio,
enee. About noon, when the feawas calm, that'I couldcome
within a quarter of a mile of her, it was-to my grief that I
.'perteived, that if we had kept on board all our livestohad,
been faved. Thefe thou hts, and my folitude, drew tears
from my eyes, thcugh a] in'vain. So'refolvingto get-to'
the ihip, I firipped and leapt into the water; when fwim-
_ ming round her, I was afraid Uhould no: get any thing to
lay hold ofi; but it .was my good fortune to .efpy a {mall
_ pieceofiropehang down by the-fore-chains, folowthatby'
the help .ofjt, though withgreat difficulty. I got into the-

forecallle of the (hip. Here I found that the {hip was
bulged, and'had a great deal of water in her hold ; her (tern
was lifted up ayainli a bank. and her head almofl: to the
water. All her quarters, and what was there, was free and
dry. The provit'ions l'fcund in good order, with which I
crammed my packets, and lofing no time, ate while'l was

veral {pare yards, a fpare topmalt or two, and two or three
large fpars of wood. With thel'e I fell to uorlt, and flung '
as many of them 09erboard as l couldmanage, tying every
one of them with a tape, that they might not drive away.
. This done I went down to -he fhip's tide, and tied tour of
them fall together-at both ends, in form of a raft, and laying
two or three fnort pieces of plank upon them erofl'wife, I
found it would bear me, but not any confiderable weight.
Upon which I went to work again, cutting a fpare topmah'.
into three lengths, adding them to my raft with a great deal
'of labour and pains. I'then confidered u. hat I fhculd load
it with, it being not able to beari'ipondercus burden. And
thier-{OCn thought of, firli laying upon it all the planks and

men's chefis, after I had filled them with bread, rice, three
Dutch cheefes, five pieces of dried goat's flefh, and fame
European corn, what little the rats had fpared; and for
liquOrs, I found feveral cafes of bottles belonging to our
fltippcr, in which were fome cordial waters, and four or
five gallons of rack, which I flawed by themfelves. By
this time the tide beginning to flow. I perceived my coat,

took no more than I wanted for the prefent. My eyes were

found the raft to drive a little difl'ance from the place where
I fitfl landed; "and then I perceived a'little opening of the
land, with a lirong current-oFthe tide running into it: 'upx

eanfed the raft to float again. and cgming up a liitle river
tvith land on both'lid'es, I landed in a little cave, as near the
mouth as pofiible, the better to difcover a fail, if any fuch
providentially paired that way.

Not far of, I efpied a hill of Rupendous height, fur-
rounded with lefl'er bills about it, and thither I was refolved

fitting on one of the chetts, which {eeming not to fear me
or the gun'that I 'prcfented at her, I threw her a piece of
bifcuit, which the inttantly ate and departed.
. ,When I had gotten thele'efieets on there, I went-to worlt,
in order to make me a little tent with the fail and fame poles
which I had cu: for that purpofe; and having finilhed it.
what things might be damaged by the weather I brought
in, piling all the empty chetls and oath in a circle. the
better to fortify it againfi any {udden attem t of man or

and an empty chefl, turr-ed the long way out. I then
charged my gun and piflol, and laying" my bed on the
ground,'flept as comfmtably, till next morning, as though I
had been in a Chriltian country.

- defpairing ("fa fudden deliverance, or that buth ammunition

coveted as much as I could; and {0 long as the {hip re-
mained in that condition, I daily brought away one necef-
fary or other; particularly the rigging, tails, and cordage,
{ome twine, a barrel of wet powder, {ome fugar, a barrel
of meal, three callts of rum, and, what indeed was mofl:
welcome to me, a whole hogfhead of bread. '

The next time I went I cut the cables in pieces, carried
of a hawfer whole, with a great deal of iron-workyand
made another raft with the mizen and fprit-fail yard; but
this being {0 unwieldy, by the tee heavy burden I had upon
it, and not being able {0 dexteroufly to guideitas the former,
both my cargo and l were overturned. For my part, all
the damage I fuflained was a wet Ikin; and, at low water,

in thefe words: " Lord, in pity look upon me": Lord have
"mercv upon me: have mercy upon me!" After this it"
fell afleep, which I found had much refrethed me, when [-
awaked. I'fell (at! afleep a fecond time, and fell into this

over as bright as afiath of fire that a little bef0re furrouuded
him ; his countenance inconceivably terrible; the earth, as .
it were, trembled when he flept upon the ground, and Rallies
offire teemed to fill all the air. Not (cotter, I thought, he .
landed up0n the earth, but with a long (pear, or other 'Wea-

ground, his voice added to my amazement, when I' thought
I heard him pronounce thefe dreadful word-5,,"Unhappy
.. wretch !. {eeing ail thefe things have not brought thee to
" repentance, thou {halt immediately die." In pronouncing
this dreadful fentence, I thought he meant to kill me with
the {pear that was in his hand. ' .

Any body may think it impoflible for me to exprefs the
horrors of my mind at this vifion : and even when I awaked.
this very dream made a deep impreflion upon my mind.--
The little divine knowledge ] had, I received frbm my fa-

rupted {cries offea-faring impiety for eight years (pace. Ex- -
cept what ficknefs forced from me. I do not'remember I had
one thought of lifting up my heart towards God, bur-rather
had a certain tiupidity of foul, n0t hafing the leaii (cute or
fearof the Omnipotent Being when in diflrefs, nor of- gra-

Our beings were afl'uredly created by' fame almighty in-

his will that it lhouldube to; and then proceeded to. inquire,
why l'hould ch deal with me in this manner? 0':- what

Here confcience flew in my face, reprehending meta: a.-

find fame; where Heaven, no doubt, diree'ted me to-find a
cure for both foul and body; for there I found one of the
Bibles, which, till this time, I had neither leilnre nor inclig
nation to look into. I took both the tobacco and thatoutof
the chefl, and laid them on the table. Several experi'nienta '
did lay with the tobacco: Firft, i took a piece of leaf, and

chewed it; but it being very green "and thong, atone .~ .

and, in the thiri place, I burnt fame 'over a pan of_ fire,
holding my note over it as long as I could endure it. with-
out fufi'ocation. _

In the intervals of this operation, though my head was
giddy and dillurbed by the tobacco, I tOolt up the Bible to
read. No fooner did I open it, but there appeared to me
thefe words, " Call on me in the day of trouble, and I will
" deliver thee, and thou lhalt glorify me. -

At firfi, this fentcnce made a very deep impreliion on
my heart, but it foon wore cfl" again, when l confidered the
word delimit was foreign to me. And as the children of
Xrael faid, when they were promifed fielh to eat, "Can
God {pread a table in the wildernefs ?" In like manner I

' began to fay, " Can God himfelf deliver me from this deft).

mind, and afterwards made 'a greater impreliion up 11 me.
As it was now very late, and the tobacco had dozed my
head, I was inclined to lieep; but before I .would lie down
I fell on my knees, and implored the promife that God had.

.ntade me in the Holy Scripture, that "if I called upon him
in the day of trouble, he would deliver me." With much
difficulty, I'afterwards drank the rum, wherein I had lieepc't'l
the tobacco, which flying into my head, threw me into fuck
a profound fleep,that it was three o'clock the next day before
I awaited; or rather I- believe, I flept two days, having cer-
tainly loli. a day in' my account, and I could never tell any
other way. When I got up, my fpirila were lively and
cheerful; my liornach much better, being very hungry ;
and, in than, no fit returned the next day, which was the

' 29th, but I found myfelf much altered for the better.

i The 30th I went abroad with my gun, but not far, and
killed a fea-fowl'or two, refembling a brand goofe, which,

however, I cared not to eat when I broaght them home,
but dined on two more of the turtle's eggs. .In the evening
I renewed my medicine, exce ting that ldid not take {0

lightful; that to me it feemed like a planted garden. I then
defcended on the fide of that delicious vale, when I found
abundance of cocoa, orange, lemon, and Citron tre: ; but
very wild and barren at'that time. As for the limes, they
were delightfuland wholel'ome, thejttice ofw~hich lal'terwards

up a flare of grapes, limes, and lemons, againll the approach-

made men (entlike the other, yet having no {belter of-ahill

I Was obliged to return to my old cattle. The rain con-
' tinned more or. lefs every day, till the middle of October ;
and'fometimes (a violent, that I. could not Rir out of my

cave for feveral days. ~This {eafonl found my family to

of my life. The rainy and dry {eafons appeared now regular
to me, and experience taught me how to provide lbr them ;
yet, in one thing I am going. torelate, my experience very;
much failed me. You may call to mind what I have mono.

But {till I wanted two necefl'ary things. I had no call:
to hold my liquor, except two runle'ts almolt full of rum, a
few battles of an ordinary fize, and fame fquare cafe bottles ;
neither had I a pot to boil an) thing in, only a large Itettle
unfit to make breth, or flew a bit of meat: I wanted like-
wife at the beginning of this dry feal'on, a. tobacco pipe;
but for this I afterwards found an expedient. _ '
I kept myfelf em loyed in planti my {ecoud row of
flakes. But rememhering that when travelled up-to the
brook, I had a mind to {eethe wholeifland, I now refumed '
my intention; and taking my dog, gun, hatchet, two bifcnit
cakes, a great bunch of raifins, with a larger quantity of
powder and (hot than ufual, I began my journey. Having
pafl'ed the vale where my bower flood, I came within View
of the (ca, lying to the well; when it being a blear day, I
fairly defctted land, attending from the W. to the S. W.
abcut ten or fifteen leagues, as I concluded ; but couldnot
fay whether it was an ifland or a continent. Neither
could I tell what this place might be; only thought it was i
part of America, and where'l might have been in' a'mil'era '
able condition, had I landed. Again, Iconfid'eredgthat if
this was the $panilh coalt, certainly, one timeor other, I
ihould ~fee fome (hip pafs by; and if it wasynot, then it
mull be the lavage coafl, between the Spanifh country'and
Brazil, which abounds with eannibals or man-eaters.
As I proceeded forward, I found this'fide of the ifland
much more pleal'ant than mine ; thelieldt flagrant, adorned
with fweet'liowers and verdant-gram together with (<<oral
vety fine woods. There were parmta in plenty,v-whicli
made me long for one to be my companion; but it was with
great diliiculty I could knock one down with my flick; and l
I kept him at home {ome years before I could get'himto '
call meby my name. . _ '. ..-
_ In the low grounds, I found various forts of harea'a'til.

in Englard. Several'of' tvhefe I killed. but never the ' ,"
neither, indeed, had I any occafion; for aboun. a ..
goats, pigeons, turtle, and grapes, I could defy-Lei. . '

ret timing! weary enough to. the place where I dellgneige
all all night, ninth was either in a tree, orifi'ipld'ce';
which I furrounded with flakes, that no wild creature might
fuddenly furprife me. When I came to the fea-lhore,lwac
' amazed to fee the fplendour of it. Its flrand was covered
with {hells of the mod beautiful filh, and cuntlantly abound-
ing with innumerable turtles, and fowls of many kinds.
which I was ignorant of, except thofe celled penguins. ,I
might have [hot as many as I plenfed; But was fparing of
my ammunition, rather chocfing to kill a {he-goat. which!
did with much difficulty, on account of the flatnelii of the
country. .

Now though this journey produced me the molt plating
fatisfaction, yet my habitation was fo much to my liking.
that I did not repine at my being feated on the worli part
of the ifland. I continued my Journey, travelling about
'twelve' miles further towards- the call, where I fet a. great
pile on the lhore for a mark, concluding that my next jour-
ney lhould bring me to the other fide of the iflund,eall from
my callle, and {0 round till I came to my poll: again. As I
had a conftant view of the country. I thought I could not '
mifs my way; but fcarcely had -I travelled three miles,
when I defcendetl' into a very large valley, [0 furrounded
with hills, covered with wood, that I having no guide but
the fun, nor even that, unlefs lknew well his polition'at
that time of the day; and, to add to my misfortune, the wee-
ther proving very hazy, I was obliged to return to my poll:
by the fer-fide, and fo backwards the' fame way I,came.---
In this journey my dog furpril'ed a kid, and would have
killed it, had i not prevented him. As [had often been
thinking of getting a kid or'two, and fo railing a breed of
tame goats to fupply me after my ammunition was fpent, I
took this opportunity of beginning: and having made a
collar for this little- creature, with a firing made of rope-
yarng I brought it to my bower, and there incl'ofed and left
him; and ~ having {pent a month in thisjourney, at length
I returned: to my own habitation.

Nobody can doubt of my fatisfaction, when I returned to
m'yJittle' cattle, and repofed myfelf i_n my'hamrnoclt. After
myj'aumey, I relied myfelf a' week, which time [employed
in"'.ln'aking a cage for my pretty Poll? I n'owbegau' to
angina; my poor kid I had left in the bower, and I im'meJ
diately'went to fetch it home. When I' came'there, I found

me like a dog; and, as I conflantly fed it, it became lb
loving, gentle, and'fond, that it commenced one of my do-
metlics, and would never leaveme. .

The rainy region of the autumnal equinox being now
come, I kept the 30th of September in the molt folemn
manner, as ufual: it being the third year of my abode in
,the itland. I {pent the whole day in acknowledging God's
mercies, in giving him thanks for making this folitary life as
agreeable and .let's finful, than that of human fociety; and
for the communications of his grace to my foul, in {apport-
ing. comforting, and ercouraging me to depend upon his
Providence, and hope for his eternal prefence in the world
to come.

, lndeed,1 often did confider how much more happy I was
inthis {late of life, than in that accurfed manner of living I
formerly ufed; and {ometimes when hunting, or viewing
the country, the anguilh of my foul would break out upon
me, and my very heart would link Within me, to think of the
woods, the mountains, the deferts I was in; and how I was
a prifoner locked-up within the eternal bars and bolts of the
ocean, in an uninhabited wildernefs, without hopes,,and
without redemption. In this condition I. would often wring
any hands and weep like a child : And even fometimes, in
the middle of my Work, this fit would take me; and then I
would fitdown and figh, looking on the ground for an haur
or two together, till {uch time as my grief got vent in a
flood of tears,
' One morning as I was {adly employed in this manner, I
opened my Bible, when I immediately fixed my eyes upon
thele words, _"I will never leave thee, nor forfake thee 1"

which commonly took m-.~ u a, when it did not rain, three

middle of the day, the fun being in its height, it was {0 ltor,
that I cculd n0t liir Out ; {0 that I had only huh four hours
in the evening to work in: and then the want of tools, of
afliflance, and (kill, walled a great deal of time to littie
purpofe. I was no lefs than two and forty days making a.
board fit for a long flit-ll, which two lawyers, with their
tools and {aw-pit, would have cut eff the {mic tree in
halfa day._ It was ofa large tree, as my board was to be

in lapping off the boughs, and reducing it to a piece of tim-

, to others. And, indeed, {0 good an efl'eel had this, that they
not only forfoek the mm, but all that part of the ifland, fo
long as riel'e Criminals hung there. '

My com ha virrg ripcne: apace, the latter end of Decem-
ber, which w'as my lecond harvell, I reaped it with a lithe,
made of one of my broad (words. I had no fatigue in cut-
ting down my firfi crop, it was to flender. The ears I car-
ried homein a balket, rubbing it with my hands, inflead of
thrafizin it; and when the harvelt was over, found my
half moi of feed produced nrar two bulhels of rice'and
two bulllcls and a half of barley. And now I plainly {ore-
faw, that, by ch's gordnefs, I {houlal be furnifhed with
bread; but yet I was concerned, becaufe I knew not how
to grind or make meal of my corn, or bread, neither knew
how to bake it. I would not, however, talle any of the
crop, but relulved to preferve it againll next fealon, and,
in the mean while, ufe my belt endeavours to provide my;
{elf with other food.

But where were my labours to end?- The want of a
plough to turn up the earth, or {hovel to dig it, I conquered
by making me a wooden fpade. The want ol'a harrow I
{upplied my {elf with dragging over the corn 3 great bough
of a tree. When it was growing I was forced to fence it;
when ripe to mow it, carry it home, .thraflr i-, part it from
the chati', and fave it. And, after all, I wanted a mill to grind
it, titve to drefs it, yelt and fall to make it into bread, and
an oven to bake it. This let my brains to work to find
fome expedient for every one of thcfe necefl'aries againfi the
next harvcli. - .

And now having more feed, my firll care was to prepare
me mare land. 1 pitched upcn two'large flat pieces of
ground near 111/ catlle, l'cr that purpole, in which I {owed
my feed, and fenced it with a gcod hedge. This took me
up three mOnths: by which time the wet {eafon coming on,
. and the rain keeping me within doors, I found {everal oc-

cafions to employ myfell'; and, while at work, ufed to di-
vert myrelf in talking to my parrot, learning him to know
and {peak his own nflie Poll, the firfl welcome word Lever
heard {poke in the illand. I had been a long time com.
triuing how to make earthen vell'ers, which I wanted e_x-.
tremely, and when I confidered the heat of the climate. I did
not doubt but if I could find any fuch clay, I might potch
up a pot, thong enough when dried in the tun. to bear
handling, and to hold any thing that was dryhas corn, meal,
and Other things. -
_To be Fnort, the clay I found ; but it would creation the
molt fericus perfon to (mile, to fee what awkward ways I
- took, and what ugly mithapen thin s I made; how many
either fell out or cracked by the VMent heat of the fun, and
fell in pieces when they were removed : {a that I think it
was two months time before I could perfeel any thing; and
even then but two clumfy things in imitation of earthen jars.
Thefe, however, I very genzly plac'cd in wicker .b'afltets,
made on purpofe for them, and bcaween the pot and the
baileots, liufi'ed it full of rice and barley-thaw, and thefe I
prefumed would hold my dried czrr, and perhaps the meal
when the corn was broiled. As {or thefmaller things, I'
made them with better facet-{5; {uch as little round pors, -
flat difhes, pitchers, and pipkins, the {on baking them very
hard. '
Yet flill I wanted one'thing abl'olutely neceii'ary, and that
was an earthen 'pot, not only to hold my liquid, but alfo to
bear the fire,. which none of thefe could do. It once hap-
pened, that as I was putting out my fire, I found therein a
broken pieteofcne of my vellels burnt as hard as rock, and
'red as a tile. Tnis made methink of burning fome pats;
' and having' ro notion ofakilnmr of glazing them with lead,
I fixed three large pipltins, a'nd two or three pots in_a pile
one upon-anoz'her. "The fire I piled round the outfide, and
dry wood on tare top, till I {aim the pots in the io-fide red
hot, and found that they werenot cracked at all : and when
l perceived them perfeeily red, I let ohepf them liand in

the fire about five or tix hours, till the clay melted by the ex-.

tremity of'the heat, and would have ran to glafs had I tut; ~

fered it: up0n which I flackened my fire'by degrees, till the

' rednefs abatec; and watching them till the morning, I {Ound
I had three very good p'pkins, and two earthzn pots, as
well burnt and fit for my turn as I c0uldfdelire. '

Nojoy could be greater than mine at this difcovery. For
after this, I may {an I wanted for no fort of earthen-ware.
Ifilled'one at my pipkins with water to boil the fame meat, ,
which it did admirably well, and witl'a piece of kid, I_ made

The next concernI had, was to get me a flone mortar to -
beat-fame corn in, intiead ol'a mil: to grind it. Here, inu'
deed, I was at a great lofs, as not being lit lor a {lone-cutter;
and many days 1 {pent to find 'out a great {lone big enough
to cut hollow and make fit for a mortar, and flrong enough
to bear the weight ( fa pellle, and that would break the corn
without filling it with far-d. But all the {tones of the inand
being of a mouldcring nature, rendered my fearch f ui'tlefs;
and then I ref-.lved to look out for a great block of hard
wood, which having found, I formed it with my axe and
hammer, and then, with infinite labour, made a hollow in it,
jolt as the Indians of Brazil make their canoes. When I.
had finilhed this, I made a great pefile of iron wood, and
then laid them up againft my lucceeding harvelt.

My next bufinefs was to make me a have to tilt my meal,
and part it from the bran and hulk. Havingm fine thin

canvas to {earce the meal through, I could not tell what to
do. What linen 1 had was reduced to rags: I had goat's
hair enough, but neither tools to work it, nor did I know
'how to {pin it: At length I remembered I had fome neck-
cloths of calico t-r muflin ofthe tailors, which I had brmgtt
out of~the fhip, ad with thel'e l madethree {mail fieves,
.proper enough for the work. . _

I come now to confider the baking part. The want of
an own I {upplied by making fame earthen pans very broad
:but not deep. - When I'had a mind to bake, 1 made a great
fire upon the hearth, the tilesol' which I had made myl'elf;
and when the wood "as burnt into live coals, l {trad them
over it, till it became very. hot : then {weeping them away,
I for down my loaves, and whelming down the earthen pots
upon them, drew the ales and coals all around the Outhde;
'of the pot to continue the heat; and in thii mannerl baked
my barley loaves, .as'well as ifl had bC-'Y'. acomplete paltry-
ccok, and alto made of the rice {eVeral cakes and _p~.--dd ngs.
' It is no wonder that thefe things took me up the belt
fort of a ytar, fin'ce what inermediate time I had was be-
flowed inmmaging my new harrelt and holbant'ry ;. :or :n
the protzer {eafrn l reaped my corn, carried 1: home, and
laid it up in the ear in my large bafltets, .ttl. I haa umeto
rub. inflead of thralhing it. And, now. irdted, my corn
' increaled to much, that it produced me twenty bulhels of'_
barley, and as much rice, that I not only began to.ufe_it
freely, but was thinkinghow toenlarge my barns, and"-
_.{olved to few as' much at a time as would be futiicient {or
me for a whole year.

All this while, the profpee't of land, which I had- (Zen
from the cthtr tide of the illand, ear. in my mind. -l"flill
meditatcd a deliverance from this place, though the fear
ofgreater tni~fcrtuncs might have deterred me from it. For,
showing that 1 had attained that place, l ran the hazard of
being killed and eaten by the devouring cannita's; and if
they were nor. {0, )et l might be ll in, as other Eat-Opeans-
had been, Who tell i: to their hands. NOtwithflandin-g all

Work with all the llrength I had, "ill! lcters and rollers I
had cut from the wood, to turn jhzr, and repair the damages
the had' (attained. This wort: took me up three or four

' weeks, when finding my little lit-eng'th all in v-ain,: I fell to
undermining it by. digging away the {and'yand [0 to make
it fall down, letting pitcts of wood to thrufl and 'guide it-

Nothing remained now, but, indeed, the greatet't diffi-
why to get it into the water, it lying about one hundred
)ards from it. To temeiy the firlt inconvenience. which
was a rifing hu'l between the boat and the creek, with won-
derful pains and labours I dug into the bowels of the earth,
and made a declivity. But when this was done, all the
alrength I had was as infnfficient to remove it, as it was when
I attempted 0 remove iht' boat. I then proceeded to meafure
the dillance of ground, refclving to make a canal in order
to bring the water to the canoe, fince I could net bring the
canoe to the water. But as this feemed to be impracticable
to myl'cll alone, under the {pace of eleven or. twelve years,
it brought me into {ome fort of confideration; -fo thatl
concluded this alfo to be impofli'le, and the attempt alto-
gether vain. i now law, and not before, what fiupidity it
is to begin work before we reckon its colt, or judge rightly
our own abilities to go through with its performance.

In the height of this work my fourth year expired. from
the time I was caft on this ifland. At this time I did not
forget my anniverfary: but kept it with rather greater de-
votion than before. For now my h0pes being fruflrated, I
looked upon this world as a thing! had nothing to do with;
and very well might l fay, as father Abraham laid unto Dives,

Thefe thoughts rendered my mind more eal'y than ul'ual '\
Every time I {at down to meat, I did it with thankfulnefs,
admiring the providential han l of God, who. in this wilder-
neI's, had fpread a table to me Ar d now I confidered what
I enjoyed, rather than what] wanted ; compared my ~prefen-t
condition with what I at full exp filed it Ihauld be : how
] Iho-ald have done, if I had go: nothing out of the {hip- ,
thatI mullhave petilhed befo." e I had caug'r: tfilli or turtles;
or lived, had I found them, like a mere lavage, by eating
them raw, and'pulling them to piec s with my claws, 1 Ice a.
boil} I next compared my l'tuion to that wh ch I deferv~
ed; how undutiful I had been to my parents 3 how dellitute
of the fear ofGod : how vo?d of every thing that was good;
and how ungrateful for thofe abundant mercies I had re-
ceived from Heaven, being fed. as it were, by a miracle, -
even as great as Elijah' 5 being fez! by ravens , and call on
a place where there 15 no venomous creatures to poifen or
devour me; in (hurt, making God's tender mercies matt r .
of great confolation, I relinquilhed all Iadnels, and gave
_way to c0ntentm'ent.

As lOng as my inl: cont ',nucd which with wa. er I made
Iaii as long asl could, I ufed to minute do am the days of the
month on which any rema. kable event hap pened. ----~A,nd .

Firli, I obl'erved, that the fame day I forfook my parents \
and friends, and ran away to Hull, 11: order to go to fea; the
fame day afterwards 1n the next year, I was taken and made
a flare by the Salee rovers.

That the very day I efcaped out of the wreck of the {hip
in Yarmouth roads, a year after, on the fame day, I made
my efcape from Salee 1n my patron s filhing boat. -

yAnd, on the 30th of September, being the day 111 the year
I was born on, on that day tienty- -fix years afer', was I
miraculoufly faved, and call yrafho e on this ifland;

The next thing that walled after myink. was the bill
cults which [had brought out of the {hip , and tho 1gb I al-
lowed myfelf but one cake a day for above a twelvemonth,
yet I was quite out of bread f r near a year, before I got
any corn of my own.

.In the next place, my clothes began to decay, and my .
linen had been gone long before. [-10 .ve'ver, I had prek
Ierved about three dozen of the failors' chequered Ihirts,
which proved a great refrelhment to me, when the violent

beams of the fun would nor. {offer me to bear any of the {ca-

men's heavy watch-costs; which made me turn tailor, and
after a miferable batching manner, convert them tojacltete.
To preferve my head. I made me a cap of goat': thin, with
the haircutwards to kerp out the rain ; which indeed ferved
me {o well, that af-ermrds I 'made me a waillcoat and open-
ktteed breeches of the fame : And then I contrived a
for: of an umbr:lla, covering it with (kins, which not Only
kept cut the heat of the fun, but rain aifo. Thus being eafy ,
and fettled in my mind. my chiefhappinefs was to converl'e'
' with God, in molt heavenly and crmbttable ejaculations.
For five years after this lean-.ot fay any extraordinary
thing occurred to me. My chitf employ ment was to cure
my raifins, and plan: my bar'ey ard rice, both of which I
had a year's provilion beforehand.- But though I was dif-
appoinwd in my fit-ll cahoe, I made it, at ia'ermediate times,
my b'gfinefs to make a fecond, of-much inferior lize; and it
was two years before l had limflud it. But as l perceived
it would no wife anfwer my delign of failing to the other
there. my thoughts were confined to take atour TOU'd the
illand, to {re what further difcoverics I could make. To
this intent, after havirg moved her to the water, and tried
how the wouldfsil, I fitted up a. little mail \to my boat, and
,made a fail of the {hip's fazl that lay by me. I then made
lockers or b' xes at th: endpf it, to put in necemries,' pl")-
vilion, aad ammuni ion, which would preferve them dry,
either from rain or the f: ray of the {ca ; and tn the infide
of the boat, I cut me a long hnllow place to lay my gun in;
and to keep it. dry, mtde a flag to hang over in, My um-_
hreila I, fixed in a tlep in the tlzrn, like a mall. to keep the
heat of the fun off me. And now refolving to fee the cir-
eumference of my little kingdom, l victualled my {hip for
the voyage, puttingin two dg~2ens of my barlhubrea'l loans,
an earthen pot lull of parched rice, a little houlv: of mm,
. halfa goat, p Walter and thtit, and two wa'ch' coats. It was
the 6th of November, in the 6th year of my reign, or capti-
.vity. that l (at out in this voyage; which was much Ion er
- than I expefied, being obl ged to pit: farther out; by .383 on
of the rccks that lay.a great way in the fee. And indeed
{0 much did thefe ;o<l~:s l'urprife m3 thztt'l was for putting
back; fearing that if I ventured farther it would be but of.
my power to return. In this unCet-tainty I came to an'an.
chcr jail on fame, to which I wad'ed withomy gun on my
thoulder, and then climbingup a hill, whtch oveilooked
that point, Ifaw the full extent of it, and {o refolved to run
all hazards.

In this profpeft from the h II, I perceived a violent cut- -
rent running to the call, coming very clefe to the point; .

{pring upfrom the S. S. E. which overjo ed my heart; and
was {Fillmore elated, when in about hal an hour, it blew a
gentle fine gale. Had any thick weather fprung up, I had
been loll another way ; for having no compafs on board, I
mauld never have found the way to fleer towards the ifland,
if once it had difappeared ; but it proving the contrary, I
{ct up my mall again, _l'pread my fail, and flood away
northward as much as l could, to get rid of the current. And
no {ooner did the boat begin to firetch away, but I perceiv-
ed, by the clearnefsof the water, a change of the current
was near; for, where it was firong, the water was foul;
and where it was clear' the current abated. To the call, I
[can {aw about halfa mile, a breach of the {ca upon fame
rocks, which caufed it again to feparate; and as the main
force of it drove away more foutherly, leaving the
rocks to the northtcal't; fo the other came back by the re-
pulfe of the rocks, making a (harp eddy. which returned
back again to the north.well with a very fwift firearm

how heartily I ran to my boat intothe {tream of this eddy, and
how joyfully I fpread my fail til the refi'efhing wind, Rand-
ing cheerfully before it, with a {mart tide under foot.- By
the allifiance of this eddy, I was carried above a league
hame again, when being in the wake of the illand, betwixt
the two currents, I found the water to be in afor't ofalland.'
About four o'clock in the afternoon, I reached within a
league of the ifland, and perceived the points of the rock,
which caufcd this difafier, l'tretc hing out. as I obferved be~
fore, to the fouthward, which throwing off the currents more
fouthwardly, had occalioaed another eddy to the north. But
having'a fair br'n'lt gale, l llrctched acrofs this eddy, and in
an hour came-within a'mile of the (here, where I {can
landed to my unfpeaka'ole comfort; and after an humble
profiration, thanking God for my deliverance, with refo-
Iution to lay all thoughts at cfcaping slide, I brought my
boat {afe to a l'ttle cove, an-'n laid me down totake a wel-
come repnfe. When I awoktn I was confide-mg how I
- might-get my boat home_: and coal'ting along me more, I
came to a good bay which ran up to amulet or brook; -
where finding a {afe harbour, I flowed her as' {afe as if The
had been in; dry dock made on pnrpofe for her.

I now perceived myfelf not far from the place where be-
fore I had travelled on foot; fo taking nothing with me.
except my gun, and umbrella, I began my journey; and in
the evening came to my bower, where I again laid me down -
to reit. I had not flept long before I was awakened in
great furprife, by a {irange voice that called me_ feveral
times, " Robin, Robin, Robinfon Crnfoe, poor Robin!
" Where are you, Rnbinfon Crufoe? Where are you ?
" Where have you been E"

. ' So {all was I afleep at Iii-:1, that I did not awake thOrough-
1y: but half alleep and half awake, I thought I dreamed '
that {omebody {poke to me. But, as the voice'repeated
Rodin/Fm Cur/3e i'everal times, being terribly afi'righted,
I flarted up in the utmolt conl'ufion; and nofooner were
my eyes fully Open, but I beheld my pretty Poll fitting on
thejtop of the hedge, and {non knew that it was he that call-
ed me; for jufl in limb bewailing langfiage I ufed to talk
and teach him; which he {0 eitactly learned, that he would
{it npoh my finger, and iay his bill clofeto my face, and
cry, "Poor Robinfon Crufoe, where are you r- where have
" you been ? how came yo-.:_here i" and inch like praztle I
had conltantly taught him. But even thmgh l-knew it to
be theparrot, it was a great while before I could adjuft my-
felf; being amazed how the creature g0t thither, and that
he {hould fix about that place, and no where elfe.~ But
now being afl'nred it could be no other than my honelt
Poll, my wonder ceafed, and reaching out my hand, and
calling familiarly Poil, the creature came to me, and perch-
ed upon my thumb'as he was wont, conltantly'prating to.
me with " Poor Robinfon Crufoe, and how. did I come here,
" and where had I bu'n 5'" as if 'the bird was overjoyed toe
fee me; and {o I took him home aIOng with me. " ' ' '

' I was now pretty well cured of my rambling to (ca ;. yet:
' I could with my boat, which had colt me to much trouble

and' ugly. But, I think, I was nev r fo elated with my
own performance or pnjeet, than for being able to make a
tobacco-p'pe, which, though it proved an awkward clumfy
thing, yet It was very found, and carried the {make per-
feelly well, to my great {athfafliom '

I alto improved my wicker ware, making me abundance of

very handy and cor-v: n'ent to fetch things home in, as alfo

for, making pitfalls and traps baited wit'h barley and rice; I
found one mO'ni 'g, in one of them, an old begun, and in
the Other, three kids, one male, the Other two. females.

80 boii'erous was the old one, that I cauld not bring him
away. But I forgOt the old proverb, "That hunger will

out provifions, and then given him font: water, with; little
ccrn, he "Cold have been as tame as a young kid. The

great c'ifiicuity before I could brino them to my habitation.

nilh mva with goat's flt'lll, when my ammunitiOn was}
front, the tamely breeding them no, like a flock of theep,
aha-ct my {cttlemel- t, was the only method I could take. I
concluded, alto, I mufl {eparate the wild from the tame,- or
do they would a'mazs run wild as they grew up; and the
l.:-.l way for this, was to have fume inclofed piece ofground.
well fenced, either with a hedge or pale; to keep them to
chi-finally, that thole within might n'xt break cut, or more
without bvealt in. Such an u: dot-taking was very greatfor
. one pair of hands ; but as there was an abfolute necetlity for
doirg it, my {Mt care was to find a convenient piece of.
' ground where there was likely to be herbage for them to eat>>
M ater to drink, and coverto keep them truth the fun.

Here, agaiuI gave another inflance of my ignorance and.>>

that had I enclul'ed it, the hedge or. pale had been at lealt
two miles about. Indeed, had it been ten miles,' I' had
time enough to do it in : but then I did not confider that my-
goats. would'be as wild in (0 much compafs, as if they had
had the whole ifland, and co-iequently as diliicult'for me
to catch them; This thOught came into my head, 'afzer I
had carried it on, I believe; about {if y yards; I therefr re-
altered my Icheme, and refolved to-inelofe a piece of ground
about one hand ed and fi ty yards inlength, and one hut--
fired in breadth, fuflioent erouqh foras many as wo,~ld main--,
tain me, tiEl Inch time as my flack increafe-i, and then I could
add more ground. I new vigoroully profecuted my work,
and it took me about three months in hedging the lit-ll piece,.
in which titre I' tethered the three kids in the bell: part of
it, feeding them as near me as polfible, to make them fami-
liar; and indeed I very often would carry 'lome ears of bar-
ley, or a handful of rice, and feed them outol' my hand; by
which they grew {0 tame, that when my enclofuie was
finilhez', and I had let them Iocfe, they would run after me
{Or a handful of com. This indeed anfwered my end ; and
in a year and 3 ha {'5 time, I had a flock of about twelve

goats, kids and all; and in two'years after, they amounted
to forty-three, l'efides what l had taken and killed for my
fulienance. After which I enclofed live feveral pieces of
ground to feed them in, with pens to drive them into, that'
l mighttake them as l had eccafion. ' -

In this pr-.je& .I likewife found additional bleflings; for
I not only had plt my of goat's flelh, but miek too, which in
my beginnirg I did not lo much as think of. And, indeed,
thrugh lhad net-er milked a cow, much his a goal. or few

eating alone, none daring to prelume to do To till I had
done. Poll, as il'he had been my principal court favourite
was the only perfon permitted to talk with me. My old,
but faithful dog, now grown exceedingly crazy, and who
had no fpecies to multiply his kind upon, continually fat on
my right-hand ; while my two cats fat on each tide of the
table, expeciing a bit from my hand', as a principal mark of
my royal favour. Thele were not the cats Ihad brought
from the this; they had been dead long before, andinterted
near my habitation by my own hand. But one of them, as
I fuppol'e, generating with a wild cat, a couple of their
young I had made tame; the ref} run wild into the woods,
. and in time grew to impudent as to return andvplunder me
of my flores, till {uch time as I (hot a great many, and the
tell left me' without troubling me any more. In this plen-
tiful manner did I live, wanting for nothing but converfa-
tion. One thing indeed concerned me, the want of my
boat; I knew not which way to get her round the illand
One time I refulved to go along the (bore by land to her;
but had any one in England met with fuch a figure, it would
either have afi'righted them, or made them burft into
laughter; nay, I could not but {mile to myl'elf at my habit,
which I think in this place will. be very proper to defcribe.
The cap I wore on my head, was great, high, and lhape-
Icfs, made of a goat's tkin, with a flap or pent-houfe hang-
ing down behind, not only to keep the fun from me, but to
lhoot the rain of? from running into my neck, nothing being
more pernicious than the rain falling upon the ficlh in thele
climates. I had a lhort jacket of goat's ll-tin, whole hair
hung diwn fuch a length 0:: each tide, that it reached down
to the calves of my legs. As far {hoes andJ'tockings, I had
none, but made a t'emblance of {one thing,I know not what
to call them; they were made like bufltins, and laced on
the fides like fpatterdathes, barbaroufly lha-ped like the r'cli
of my habit. I had a broad belt of goat's (kin dried, girt
round me with a couple of :hon gs, inlteadof buckles; on
each of which, ' to {apply the deficiency of {word and dagg
ger, hung my hatchet and law. I had another belt, not to
broad, yet faflcnei in the lame manner, which hung oyet
my shoulder, and at the end of it, under my left dim, bun .
two pouches, made of goat's thin, to hold my powder an .
that. My balltet I carried on my back, and my gun on my
lhoulder; and over my head a great 'ciumfy ugly goat's '
fltin unbrella, which however, next to my gun, was the
moft necell'ary thing about me.- As for my face, the colour
was not {0 {warthy as the Mulattoes, as might have been
expected from one who took fo little care of it, in a climate
within nine' or ten degrees of the equinox. At one time
my beard grew {0 long that it hung down about a quarter
of a yard; but as I had both razors and l'cilfors in flore, I
cut it all 01?, and {offered none to grow, except a large pair
of Mahometan whiflters, the like of which I had feen wore
by {ome Turks at Salee. noc lon enough indeed to hang a
hat? upon, but of fuch a mon rous fize, as would have
amazed any in England to have feen. ' ' .

But all this was of no confequence here, there being none
to obferve my behaviour or habit. And to without fear
and without cantrol, _I proceeded on my journey, the profe-'
cution of which took me up five or fix days. I firft travelled
along the fea-lhore, directly to the place where I tirlt brought
my boat to an anchor, to get upon the rocks ; but-now have
ing no boat to'tahe care of, I went overland a nearer way '
to the fame height that l was before upon; when looking
forward to the point of the rock, which lay out, and which
I was forced .to double with my boat, I was amazed to fee-
the {ea (0 fnooth and quiet, there being no rippling motion, ~
nor current, any more than in other places. This made me
ponder fome time to guefs the reafon of it, when at lalt [
was convinced that the ebb letting from the well and joining
with the current of water fromfome great river on (bore,
mutt be the occafiOn of thefe rapid firea'ms; and that, con-
fequently, as the winds blew more weltwardly or mare
{outhwardly, {o the torrent came the nearer, or went the
farther from the (here. To \{atisly my curiolity, I waited
there till evening. when the time of ebb being made, I
plainly perceived from the rock the Current again as-befo're,
with this'diti'erence, that it ran farther ofl', near half a league
from the (bore, whereas, in my eitpedition, it fet clol'e up:-
on it, furiouily hurrying me and my canoe along with it,
which at another time it would n0t have done; And now
' :I was, convinced, that, by obferving the ebbing and flowing

of the. tide, I might eatily bring my baat round'the illand
ageing But when I began to think of puttng it in praCtic'e
. the remembrance of the late danger ltruclt me with {uch ,64' Inf: AND'JDVINTURES'

horror, that I'changed my <<refolution, and 'fOrmed'another,
which was more fafe, though mme laborious; and this was
to make another canoe,-a and to have one for one lide of the

ifland, and one for the other.
I had row two plantation. in the iflsnd; the firfi my

little fortification, fort, or calile, with many large and (pat-
eious improvements; for~by this time! had enlarged the cave
behind me with (even! lit: le caves, owe within another,
to hold my ballcet's, corn and thaw. Th piles with which
I made my wall, were grown {o lofty and great, as obfcured
my habitation.- And near this commodious and pleafmt
{ett' ement, lay my ue 'l- cul'i\-ated and Imprnved cornofields,
which kincly yielded me their fruit In the proIIer leaf II.
My feeond pla'ttation was that near my country feat, or _
little bower, where my grapes flc-urilhed, andwh ere, having .
planted mam flakes, I made enclofures for my goats, lo .
flrongly fortified by labour and time, thatit was much titonger
than a wall. and ccnfequentl y impofiiblt. for them to break
through. As for my bower i felt, I kept It conflantly in
repair, and .cut the trees in fuch a manner, as made them
grow thick and wild, and form a molt delig h. fol lhade. in
' the centre of th s, flood my. tent, thus ereEted; I had driven
four piles in the ground, fpreading overit a piece of the
{hip's fail; beneath which I'made a fort of'a couch with the
{kins of the creaturcs I had flain,- and other things; and
having laid thereon one of the {ailoi's biankets, whicn I had
faved Irom the w: ck of the (hip, and covering In) {elf-with a
great watch- -coat, I took up this p 'ace for my country retreat.

Very fequcntly from this {e tlement did 1 ute to vilit
my boat, and keep her III very gcod order.. And fomctimes
I ywould tenturc in her a call or two item the lhme. but
no farther, left e: t' er a lirong current, a fudden licrmy
wind, or {ome unluckx accident {heuld hurry me from the
ifland as before. But now Icnneat ycur attention, w'r-illl:
Iprocced to inform you of a new, but molt furptiting,

{gene 'of life w-tich here be fel me.
Y on may caflly fuppofe, that after having been here {'0

long, nothing could be mcre amazing than to fee a human
creature. One day it happened, that, go'- rig to my boat, I
{aw the print of a man 's naked foot on the thore, vet eIi-.
dent on the (and, as the toes, heels, and any part ogit. ----

Had I fecn an apparition of the mall frightful (hape. 1 could
no: have been more comounded. My willing .ears gate
the flriCteft attention. I call my eyes around, but could
{atisfy neither the one nor the other. Iproceeded alter-
nately to every part of therfhore, but with equal efl'eei;
neither could I fee any other mark, though the {and about
it was as {ufceptible to take imprcflion, as that which was
to plainly fiamped. Thus, {truck wih cenfufion and-hor-
ror, I returned to my habitation, frightened at every bulb;
and tree, taking every thing ftr men; and p fl'efl'od with
the wi'defl ideas: That night my eyes never clufed. .Iz'
farmed nothing but the mall difmal imaginazions. concluding
it mutt be the mark of the devil's fnct which I had feen.
For otherwife how could any mortal come to this itlaad?
where was the [hip that tranfror ed them ? andwhat figns
of any Other foutlleps? Though thefe Cemed very thong
reafons for fuch a fuppofition, yet (thought 1) why lhould
the devil make the print of his foot to no purpofe, as I can
fee, when he might have taken other ways to have terrified
me? why {haul-d he leave his mark on the Other tide of the
ill-1nd, and that too on the (ands, where the {urging waves-
of the ocean might {oon have erafed the imprellion. Surely-
this action is not cc nfiflent with the fubtlety. oFSatan, {aid
I to myfelf; but rather mull be time dangerous creature,

venturing <<'0 far in the ocean, has been driven here, either- .
by the violent currents or co;itrary uinds; and not caring
to flay on this defolate ifland, has gone back to (ca again...

Happy, indeed, {aid I to myfclf, that mane. 0f the lavage
had teen me-in that place; yet 1 was n0t altogether with.
out fear, lefl, having found my boat, trey {hould return in-
numhers and devour me, or at loathe-any away all my com

This was evident in me in the m at} canfp'cueus manner:
For I, who before had to much lamented my condition, in.

this defoiate ifland. But when I co'nfidet'ed my Ration of ,
lir'e, decreed by the infinitely wife and good providence of
God._ 252-: i ought not to difpute mv Creator's fovereignty.
vC-ho he: 5::- undoubted right to govern and dil'pol'e of his
creatures a: he thinks convenient; and that hisjuflice and
mercy could either p' rim or deliver me: I fay, whenI
confidertd all this, I c-:.~rn?ortab'y faunti it my duty to truft
fincerelv iz; him. pray ardently to him, and humbly relign
myl'eli' to hi,c divine will. ' '
One morning lying on my bed, thefe words of the {acred
writings came into my mind, " Call upon me in the day of
" trouble. and I will deliver thee, and thou Ilialt glorify me."
Upon this {cute-me, rising more vines-rally from my bed, I
offered up my prayers in the mozi heavenly manner: and
when I had done, taking up my Bibie to read, thefe words
appeared 'firfi in my iight:--,--" Wait on the Lord, and be
" of good cheer, and he {hall tirengthen thy heart: Wait
" Ifay on the Lord." Such divine comfort did this give
me, as to remove all caufe offadnefs upon that occafion.
Thus, after a wored of apprehenlions and Fears, for three
days and nights, 1 at ial't ventured out of my cattle and
mill-ted my goats, one of which was almott {pbilevl for want
of it. I next(tht~ugh in great-fear) viiited my bower, and
' "milked my flocks there a'll'o; when growing,r bolder, I went
3&de tothe Ihoreaigain, and meafuring the print of the foot
to mine, to fee, perhaps, whether I myfelt had not occafion-
ed that mark, I found it much {aperior in largenefs: and {o
returned home, no>> abfolutely convinced that either forne
~ men had been afhire, or that the ifland mutt be inhabited,
and therefore that I might be furprifed before I was aware. -
j I now began to think of'providing for my fecurity, and
refolved in my mind many different fchemes for that pur-
pofe. I firfl propofed to cut down my inclofures, and turn
my tame cattle wild into the woods. that the enemy might
not find them, and frequent the illand in hopes of killing
the fame. Secondly, I was for digging up my corn-fields
for the very fame rcafon. And, lattly, I concluded to dc;
molith my bower, left, {eeing a place of human contrivance, _-
they might corne farther, and find out, and attack me in my
little cattle. , -
Such nations did the fear of danger fuggelt to me: and -.I
looked, I thought, tike the unfortunate king Sail, when not

\-
.himfelf. And, it is firange, that a little before,-having en-
tirely religned myl'elf to the will of God, I lhould now'have
little confidence in him, fearing thofe more who could kill
this fading body, than him who could dellroy my immortal
1.0111. ' , '

Sleep was an utter ttranger to my eyes that night; yet
nature,.fpent and tired, fubmitted to a filent repofe the next
morning, and then joining reafon with fear, lconfidered
that file delightful and pleafant ifland might not be {0 en-
tirely forfaken, as I might think; but that the inhabitants
from the other [bore might fail, either with a de'lign or from
neceflity, by crofs winds; and, if the'latter circumllance,
I had realm to believe they would depart the firlt oppor-
tunity. However, my fear made me think of'a place for re-
treat upon an attack. I now repented that [had made my
door to come out beyond my Fortification ; to remedy which
I refolved to make me a {econd one: I fell to work, there-
fore, and drove betwixt that- double rows of trees, which I
planted above twelve years before, {everal throng piles;
thickening it with pieces of timber and old cables, and
firengthening the foot of it with earth which I dug out of my
cave; I alfo made me _feve_n holes, wherein I planted my
mulkets like cannon, fitting them into frames refembling'
carriages. This being finifhed with indefatigable indullry, '
for a great way every where, I planted flick: of 013 era like a '
wood, about twenty thoufand of them, leaving a large {pace
between them and my wall, that I might have room to fee
an enemy, and that they might not belhelterecl mong the
young trees, if they offered to approach the outer'wall.--.
And, indeed, {Caree two years had 'pal'l'ed- over my head,
when there appeared a lovely lhady grove, and in fix years
it becamea thick wood, pe'rfealy impifl'tb'e. For mv-fafe-
ty, Lieft no avenue to gb in or out; inlbead of which I {et
two ladders, one to a part of a rock which was low, and-
then broke in, leaving room to place another ladder-upon
that; to that when I took thefe down, it was impofli ble for"
any man to defcend without hurting. himfelf; and if they
had, they would ltill be at the outfide of my outer wall.--
. But while I took all thefe meafure: of human prudence for-
myown prefervation, I was not altogether un mindful of other
affairs. ' To preferve my flock of tamegnats, that the en:-

retired part ofthe ifland, whichwas the place where I had
1011' mvfelfbefore--mentioned, and there finding aclear piece
ofland, ccntainirg three acres, furrcunded with thick woods,
I WtOughl fo hard, that in lefs than a month'stime, l fenced
'it to well ro:.-nd, that my flecks were very well fecured in
it, and put therein two lie-goats and ten {he-goats.

All this labour was occafioned purely by fearful appre-
hentions, on account of feeing the print of a man's foot.--
And nut contented ye: wi h what [had donr,' Ifearched
for another place towards the weft point of the ifland,
where I might alfo retain another flock. Then wandering
on this errardmore to the wetl ofthe ifland than ever I had
yet done, and calling my eyes towards the (ea, methought
I perceived a boat at a great dillance, but cauld not polli-
bly tell what it was for want of my perfpeelive glat's. I.
confieered then it was no firange thing to fee the' print of
a man's foot ; and concluding them cannibals, blefl'ed God
for being call on the Other tide of the ifland, where none of
the ravages, as l thaught. ever came. - But when I came _
down the hill to the (here, which was the S. W. point of
the itland, I was [con caeifirmed in my opinion; nor- can
any one defcribe my harror 'and amazement, when I few
the ground (bread with falls, hands, feet, and bones of
human bodies; and, particularly 1 perceived a {pace like
a circle, in the with} of whichb-ad been a fire, about which
I conjeelured thefe w:etches fat, and armaturally {aerificed
and davonretl their fellow-creatures.

The horror and loa'htbmenefs of this dreadful fpectacle,
-bo:h confounled my t'enfcs,and made me dit'charge from my
Romach in an excellive mannt-r. I then retur. ed towards
my habitation; and, in my way thither, {he-Ming fluodscf
tears, and fallintr down on my bended knees, gave God
thanks for making my nature contrary to thcfe wretches, -
and delivering me to long out of their hands. . .

Though realm and my long refidence here had mined
in". that thefc {savages never came up to, the thick woody
part of the cotxmry, and that I had no reat' n to be appre-
he' tive of a dti'covery ; yet. l'uch an. abhorrence did -I fill!
Retain, that, for- two years after, I confined myfclt'only to
my three plantations; I mean my cattle, com tryJeat, antl-
inclot'ure in the woon. And though in weeds of time my.
dreadful apprehenlions began to wear away, yet-my eyes, -.
were; there vigilant for. fear of being furprat'edracd I was

very cautiOns of firing my gun, lefl being heard by thol'e
creatures, they fhould proceed to attack me. I relolved,
however, manfully to lore my life if they did, and went
armed with three pifiols, flock to my girdle, which, added
to the defcdpzion I have given of mylcli before, made me
look with a very formidable appearance.

Thus my circumflances for fome time remairerl very
calm and undiflurbed; and when I compared my condition
to 0thcrs,I found it far from being mile-table. And indeed,
would -'all perfons Compare their circumstances. not with .
thofe above them, but with thofe innumerahle unhappy ob-
jects beneath them, I am fore we thould not hear thofe
daily murmurings and complainings that are in t e world.
For 'rny part I wanted but few things. Indeei, the terror
which the {wages had put me in, {poiled fame inventions
{army own conveniences. One of my projects was to brew
me fome beer; a very tvhimfical one indeed; when it is
confidered that I had neither caflts fufiicient, nor c-.old I
make any to preferve it in; neither had Ih0ps to nuke it
keep. yell to niake it work, nor a copper or kettle to make
it boil. Perhapsnindeed, after fome years I might bring
this to bear, asl had done other things. But now my inven-
tions were p'aced anoher way; and day and night I could
think of nothing but how 1 might deliroy form of theft:
carnibals, when proceeding to their bloody cntcrtamments ;
and {o faving a victim from being facraficed. that he might
after'bscome my {en/ant. Many were my contr'vances
after this purpore, and as many moe objections occurred,
after I had hatched them. lonce contrived to dig'a hole *
under the place where they maie thei- fire, and pit: therein
five 0r fix paunds of gunpowder, which would consequently
blow up all thofe that were near it; and then l was loath to
{pend {5 much upon them, lelt it lhould nor dochat certain
execution I could defire, and but only afi'right and Mt kill

'them. Having laid this delign aiide, I again propoled to
myfelf to lie privately/in ambuih, in form convenient place.
with my three guns double .'oac'ed, and let fly at them in _
the'midli of thezr dreadful ceremonv: ard having killed.
two' or three of them at every lhot, fad upon the rett fud-
denly with my three pifiols, and not let one mother's fun
cfcape. This imagination pieafed my fancyfo much, that
1 Med .toidream of it in thc nighttime. To put my delignj
in execution, I "as not lcng in feeking for a place conve-
nient for my purpofe, where unfeen 1 might behold every
aetion of the ravages. 'Here I placed my two mulkets, each
of which was loat'e-ri with a brace of Hugs, and four or
five fmaller bUilt'IS about the tize of'piflol bullets; the
fowlzng-piece was en. rged v M; tear a handful of the largefi

months, i: not tnly grea wry tirefome to me, but brought
me to tome confide-ration, and mademe examire mytelf,
what right I had to lull thet'e creatures in this manner.

If (argred 1 to mylelt) this unnatural cuflom t-ftheir's be
a fin ofi'entive to Heathen, it belongs to the Divme Being,
\\ ho alone hrs the v.ndie'tive power in his hands, to lhower
down his vengeance upon them. And, perhaps he does to

if not, it th thinks thcfe doings jut}, according to the
knowedge the) conceive, what authority have I to pretend
to thwart the decrees of Providence, which has 'permitted
thete acrinns in to many ages, perhaps from almott the be-
ginning of tie creation? They never ofi'enc'ed me, what
rrght have I then to concern mt {elf in their {bedding one
another's blood? And, indeed, I have firmeknovvn, they
"due no more to kill and devour a captive taktn in war,
than we do to kill an ox, or eat mutton. 1, then co. eluded
it neccflarily followed, that thefe peOple were no more
murderers than Chrittians, who many times put whole troops
to the x'wOrd. alter throwing down their arms--Again, I
contiacred that if I fell upon them, I lhould be as much in
the wrtng as t'ne Spaniards, who had ctmmitted the great-
eti barbarities upcn thete people who had never ofi'ended
them in their wl'mie lites; as if the kingdom cl Spain was
eminent :or a race of men without common compaflion to
the miferable, a principal tign of the molt generous temper:
thet'e contiderations made me paufe,'and made me think I
had taken wrong meafurts in my retbtution: I now argued
withmfielf, it was better tor me never to attack, but to re-.
train undifccvered as ltng as l poflibly could; that an Op-r or nausea): causoe. 71

pcfite conduct would certainly prove deltructive; for as it
was fcarcely to _be fuppot'ed I could. kill them all, I might
either be overpowered by the remaining, or :'nat fame
efcaping, might bring thoufands to my certain deitruetion.
And, indeed, religion took taeir part {0 much as to convince'
me how contrary it was to my duty to be guilty of {bedding
humzm - blood, innocent as to my particular, whatever they
are to one anather; that I had nothing to-do with it, but'
leave it to the Gad of 31' power and dominion, asI faid'
befcrt , to'dn therein what {cemed convenient to his heavenly '
wifdom. .4 nu, therefore, on my knees I thanked the A]-
mighty for delivering me from blood--guiltinefs, and begged'
his protec..on that I might never fall into their'hands.
Tnus givrng over an attempt which I had ralhly begun, .
I never alcendcd ihehill on that occafion afterwards :-I only
removed my boat, which lay on the other fide of the ifland,
and every thing that belonged to her, toward the call, into
a little cove, that there might not be the leafi lhadow of any
boat near, ,or habitation upon the iiland.g--M y caflle then
became my cell, keeping always retrred in it,"except when
I went out to milk my {he-goats, and'order my little-flock in '

looked back with horror to think in what {late I might have, ' =59,

Whil- I was cutting down {one wcod "for making my
charcoal l pcrceiwd a unity behind a very thick branch
of undtr <<cod. CIIrIous to look It to it, Iattained Its mouth,
and perceiIed it I'Lfiiciert ftr Ire to fraud upright in. But
when 1 had entere. , and took a further v ew, two roiling
{hznirg eyes, like flaming liars, {earned to dart thcmfelvts
at me , lath at I made all theta fie cut that I could, as not
knowing whether it was a dcvil or a Ironfi'er that had taken

' his rt-I'Idetce in th; I: lace. "'hen I rrcmercd a lit. lc from

death puts an end to their ft-rruws ? And, indeed, in fueh
great amazement was I, that it Iiruck me into acold fweat;
and had my hat been on my head, I believe my hair would
have moved it off. But again encouraging myfelfwith the
hopes of God's proteeli n, I proceeded forward, and by the
light of my firebrand, perceived it to be a montirous he-goat,
lying 0n the ground, gafping for life, and dying of were old
age. At firlt l'llirred him, thinking to drive him'cut, and
the 'poor ancient creazure fircve to get upon his feet, but
was net able; {0 l e'en let him lie tlifl to aft'right the'fava-
ges, lhould they venture into this cave. 1 now looked
round me and found the place but {mall and lhapelel's. At
the farther fide of it, I perceived a fort of an entrance, yet
fo low, it molt oblige me to creep upon my hands and
ltnees to it; in, having no candle, l fufpended my tnter'~
prife till the next day, and then Leame provided with two
large ones of my own mak'ng.

Having crept upon my hands and feet thtcugh this limit,
I found the roof higher up, I think about twenty feet. But
furely mortal never {aw loch -a gloricus fight before! Tne _
roof and walls of this can refleeled a hundred thoufand .'
lights to me, from my two candles, as though they were in-
dented with {hitting gold, precious liones, or fparkling
diamnnds. And, ind: ed, it was the molt delightful cavity 6:
grouo of its kind that could be drfired, though entirely
dry. The floor was dry and level, and had a klnd of
gravel upon it; no naufeous venomous creatures to be {een
there, neither any damp or wet about it. I could .d no
fault but in the entrance, and I began to thinktha even
this might be very nectllary fer my defence, and therefore
refulveo to make it my motl principal magazine. I brought
hither two funding-pieces, and three mufltets, leaving only
five pieces at my caflle, planted in the nature of cannon.
.Of the barrel of gunpowder which I took up out ofthe fea,
I brought away about fiXty pounds of good powder, which .
was not damagedyaid this, with a great quantity of lead .

. fo'r bullets, l removed ficm my cattle to this retreat, now
fortified both by art and nature. _

I fancied myfelf new like one of the giants of old, who.
were {aidito liveJSn caves and holes among theiocks, inacJ
'ceflible to any but themfelves; or, at'leatl, a mall: danger- : -

ions attempt. And no>> I 'defpizred'both the cunning and .'
flrength of the favages, either to find me out or to hurt me, V

. Butl mutt not forget the old goat, which canted my late
dreadful .a'nazement. The poor creature gave up the
gholt the day after my dit'covety; and it being difficult'to
drag him out, .I dug his grave. and honourably entombed
him in the fame pl.<<ce where he departed, wi-h'as much

ceremony as any Welch goat that has been interred 'about -

the high mountain Penmazzmawr.
I think I now was in tb!' twen y third year of my reign,

and my thoughts much eafier than formerly, having contri-.

Wad feveral prt't y amutements and diverfions to pafs away
the time in a pleatant manner. By this time my pretty Poll
l~ad learned to. {peak Englifh. and pron'unce his wards
very articulately and plain; to that for many hours We ufed
to chat together after a familiar manner, and he fitted with
' me no lets than twenty-fix years. My dog. whieh' was
_ nineteen years old. fixteen of which he lived? with 'me,' died
{ome time ago of mere old age. As for my. cats, they mul-
t'plied .{o {a'}, that I was forci'd to kill or drive them into
the woods, except two or three which became my particular
favouites. Befides there, I coatinually kept two or three
houfehold kids about me, which .I learned to feed Out of my
hand, and two more parrots which could talk i'ndifPS3rently,

and 'call 'Rodirfln Cry/Le, bu: not to excellrnt'y as the full, '

at not taking that pains with them. I had alfo {everal fea-
fowls which I had wounded and cut their wings; and
growing tame, they uted to breed among the low trees
about my cattle walls, all when made my.a')ode very
, agreeable. ' , t .
' ' But what unforefeen events fuddenly deltrcy the enjoy-
ment of tnis unceitain Rate of life, when we lealt expect
them ! It was now the month of December, in the fouthern
folttice, and partiCular time of out -harvell._ which. required
my attendance in the fields; when going out pretty eariy
one morning, before it was day-'ight, there appeared to me
fromthe fea-t'norc, a flaming light, about two miles from
_ me at the eal't endo.' the ifland, whete I had obferved fome
'favages had been before, not on the Other tide, but to my
gr'eatafilietion, it was onmy tide. the ifland. .

'myfelf to God's proteelicn, I refolved to defend myfelf till.
my lafi breath. Two hours after, impatient forittelligence',
I let my ladder up to the tide of the hill, where there nas
a fist place, and then pulling the ladd:r after me, afcended
to the top, where, laying myl'elf on my belly, with my per-
fpee'tive'g'alls, I peicsived no lefs than nine naked favagcs,
fitting round a fmall fire, eating, as I fuppofed, human fiefh,
with their two canoes hailed on lhore, waiting for the flood
to carry them (if again. Ytu cannot eafily awards the
confiernation l. was in at this light, efpecialty iceir-g ah-rm
near r: e ; but when l perceived their coming mutt be
always with the current of the ebb. I became more eat'y in
my thcughts, being fully convinCecl that I might go abroad
with fecurity all the time of flood, if they were not before
.landcd. And, indeed, this proved jut} as I imagined; for
no fooner did they'all take boat and paddle away, but' the
tide made N. \V. Before they went off, they danced, ,
making ridiculous potlures and gellvres, for above an hour,

ali hark-naked: but whether men or women, or both, I

could not perceive. "firm 1 faw'them go:~e, 1 took two

guns upon my lhoulders. and placing a couple of_ pittols in

my belt, with my great {word hanging by my (ice, I went

to the? hill, where at firl't I made a difcovery cf thele can-

nibals, and that raw theie had been three canoes mare of
the favages on there at that place, which with the red were

making over to the main land. ' '

But nothing'could be more horrid to me, when going to'
the place offaCritice. the blood, the bones, and Other mangled
parts of human bodies appeared in my light; and to tired.
was I with indignation, that I was fully refclved tobe re--
vex-ged on the firfi that came there._ though I loll my lite
in the execution. it then appeared to me, that the vifits
which they make to this iflano' are not very frequent, it be-'
ing fifteen months before they came again :' but iiill
.l was very oneafy, by realm ofthe dilmal apprehenfi;:ns
0f their furpriting me unawares ; nor dared I offer to tire a
gun on that flce of the ijland where they uted to appear,
left, taking the alarm, the iavages might return with many
hundred cances, and then th iznows in "hat'manner l
fho'uld-hav'emade my end. Thus "3.3 I a year or morebe-

But to wave this, the following accident, which demands
attention, for a while eluded the force of my thoughts in *
revenging myfelf on thol'e Heathens. , '

On the 16th of May (according to my wooden calendar)
the wind blew exceedingly hard, accompanied with abun~
dance of lightning and thunder all day, and fucceeded by a
very fiormy night. The teeming anger of the Heavens
made me have recourfe to my Bible. Whilll [was led-
oufly pondering tip-Ln it. 1 was l'uddenly alarmed with the
noife of a gun, which I conjeetured was fired upon the
ocean. Such an unufual {urprife made me t'tart up in a
minute, when, with my ladder, afcending the mountain as
.befcre, that very moment a fialhoffire prefaged the report
of another gun, which I prefently heard, and found itwaa
from that part of the tea where the current drove me away.
I could not but then think, that this mutt be a {hip in dif-
trei's, and that thefe 'were the melancholy fignals for a
fpeedy deliverance. Great, indeed, was my forrcw upon
this occafion; but my labours to afiifl: them mulbhave
proved altogether vain and fruitlefs. However, I brought
together all the dry wood that was at hand, and making a
pretty large pile, {et it on fire on the hill. 1 was certain
they plainly perceived it, by their firing another gun as {.'on
as it began to blaze, and after that feveral more from the
Jame quarter. All night long I kept up my fire: and
when the air cleared up, I perceived {amething a great way
at {ca direetly E. but could n0t difiinguilh what it was,
even with my glal's, by match the weather was ('0 very

foggy out at fea. However, keeping my eyes direetly fixed
upon it, and perceiving it did nut t'lir, I prefently concluded
it mull be a (hip at archor, and to very halty I was to be'
fatisfied, that taking the gun, I went to the a'. E. part of the
ifland, to the fame rcclts where I had been formerly drove
away by the current: in which time the weather being
perfectly cleared up, to my great furrow, I perceived the
wreck of a {hip call away upon the-{e hidden rocks I found
when I was out with my boat; .and'which, by making a
.kind'of an eddy, were the occafion of my p:e.'e.-vation. .
Thus, what is one man's fafety is another's ruin: for un-
doubtedly this {hip had been driven on them in the night,
the wind blowing tirong at E. N. E. Had they perceived
the ifland, as I now gtefl'ed they has not, certainly,'imt:ad
of firing their guns for help, they would rather-have veho

\
tured in their boat, and raved themfelves that way. I then
thought,- that perhaps they had done {0-, upon {eeing my -
fire, and were call: away in the attempt; for I perceived:
no boat in the (hip. But then I again imagined, that, per-
haps, they had another vefl'el in company, which, upon
fignal. faved their. lives, and tool: the boat up: or that the
boat might be driven into the main ocean, where thefe-poor '
creatures might be in the molt miferable condition. Buej
as all thefe conjee'tures were very uncertain, I could do no
more than commil'erate their dilirefs, and thank God for
delivering me, in particular, when {0 many perifhed in the .
raging ocean. '

When I confi 'lered ferioufly every thing concerning this
wreck, and could perceive no room to fuppol'e any of them
faved, I cannot explain, by any poflible force of words,what
longings my foul felt at this occafion, often breaking out
in this manner ;.u 0 that there had been but two or three,
"nay, even one p'erfon iaved, that we might have lived
" together, converfed with, and comforted one another!"
and f0 much were my dfefires moved, that when I repeated
there words. " Oh !- that there had been but one!" my
hands would clench together, and my fingers prel's the
palms of my hands {0 clofe, that, had any {oft thing been
between, it would have crulhed it involuntarily, while my
teeth would firike' to ether, and fet agaiuft each other {9 .
llron , that it require 'fome time for me to part them. .

Til the laft year of my being on this ifland, I never'
knew whether or not any had been {aved out of this (hip.
I had the affliction, fume time after, to fee the curpfe of a
drowned boy come on lhore, at the end of the ifland which
was next-the fliipwreck; there was nothing on him but a
feaman's waifleoat, a pair of openokneed linen drawers,
and a blue linen fhirt, but no particular mark to guefs what
nation he was of. In his pocket were two pieces of eight,
and a tobacco-pips, the lalt of which I preferred much.
more than I did the firll. And now- the calmnefs of the
{ea tempted me to venture out in my boat to this wreck,
nor only. to get fomething necefl'ary out of the (hip, but
perhaps {ome living creature might be on board, whole
life I might preferve- This had {uch an influence upon
my mind, that immediately I went home, and prepared

every thing neceflary {or the voyage, carrying on beard' _ drowned in the cookeroom or forecat'de; inciofed';n?SSSS__'e2

to go out f. r fo many hours. To be incre certain how the

.able thoughts came into my head. I traced quite over the
whole hiliory of my life in miniature, from my utwoti re- ,
membrane: of thingstill I came to this ifland, and then
proceeded to examine every action and pafl'age>> that had
occurred time I 'had'taken poffeliion of my kingdom. -In
my reflections upon the latter, I was comparing the happy
pollute of my affairs in the beginning of my reign, to this
life of anxiety, fear, and concern, linee Ihad difcovered a .
print of a foot in the {and ; that'while I'cootinued without '
appreher-litns I was incapable of feeling the dread and ter-
ror I now fulfered. How thankful rather ought I to
have been for. the knowledge rf my danger, fince' the
g'cateli happinefs one can be poffell'ed of is'to have fufli-
cient time to provide againtt it? How Rupendcus is the
goodnefs of Providence, which lets Inch narrow bounds to
the fight and knowledge of human nature, that while men '
walk in the midfi of {a many dangers, theyare kept ferene
and calm, by having the events of things hid from their eyes, '
and knowing nothing of ttofe many dangers that {urrc-und
them, till perhaps they are diflipated a'd vanilh away..

Vt hen I came m: re particularly to confider of the real
danger I had for {0 many years elcaped ;' how [had walked
about in the greatell fecurity and tranquillity, at atime',
perhaps, when even norhing but the brow of a, hill, a great
tree, or the common approach of night, had interpol'ed be-
tween me and the defiruc'tive hands'of the cannibals, who

. would devour the with as gu"-d an appetite, as I would a
pigecn or cuflew; {urely all thit, l fay, could not but
pane me finccrely thankful to my great Preferver, whole
. 'fingular proue'tion I acknowledgewith the greatelt hu'm'i-
lity, and' withcut which I mutt inevitably have fallen into
the cruel hands tf thofe dcvoure'rs. '
' Having thus'difculled my thoughts inthe clearefi manner,
acco-'dirtg to my weak nnderflanding, l nexrptoceeded to
-confider the wretched nature of thofe- deflrcying farages,
by (caning, though with great reverence, to inquire, why

God fitoold give up any of his creatures to filch inhumaeltfi .

with them .anozher Indian, whom they' deligned to make'a'

to give the fatal blow, methought the poor dcfigned viaun "

jumped away, and .ran directly into 'my little thick grove
before my fortification,' to ahfcond from his enemies, when
perceiving that the when did not follow him that way, I
appeared to him; that he humbly kneeled' down before
me, feemed to pray for my afliflanceg. upon which I
mowed him my ladder, made 'him' afcend, carried him to
any cave, and he became my 'ferva'nt;' and when~I had

and what to, el'cape. But when I awaited, and. found all
thefe inexprefiible imprellions of joy entirely y'anilhedfl

afrelh the dreadful tragedy, at I {upptfcd they had done

figned to take away his life; fo afi'righted was he with the
fire and noife of my piece, that he Road, as it were, like
Let's wife, fixed and immovable, without either {enl'e or
motion. This obliged me to halloo to him again, making
the plaineli figns I could to him to draw nearer. _- I per
ceived he underflood thofe tokens by his approaching.to
me a little way, when, as if afraid I ihould kill him too,
he flopped again. Several times did he advance, and as
often flop in this manner, till coming more to my view, I
perceived him trembling as if he was to undergo the fame
fate. Upon which I looked upon him with a {miling
countenance, and {till beckoning to him, at length he
came clol'e to me, and krreeled down, killing the ground,
laid his head upon it, and taking me by the foot, {et it
upon his head; and this, as lunderfiood afterwards, was
a token of {wearing to be my {lave for ever. 1 took him
up, and, making much of him, encouraged him in the bell
manner I could. But my work, was not yet-finifhed;
for I perceived the lavage whom I had knocked down, was
nut killed, but ftunned with the blow, and began to come
to himfelf. Upon which I pointed to my new fervant, and
ihowed him that] his enemy was not yet expired; he {poke
fame words to me, but which I could not underttand; yet
being the fitfl found of a man's voice I had heard for above
twenty-five years, they were very pleating to me. But
there was no time for reflection now, the wounded favage
recovering himfelf {0 far as to fit upon the ground, which
made my poor prifoner as much afraid as before; to put
'him out of fear, I prefented my other gun at the man, with
an intent to {hoot him; but my huge, for {01 mull: now
call him, prevented my firing, by making a motion to me
to lend him my lword, which hung naked in my belt by my
fide. No fooner did I grant his requeft, but away he runs
to his enemy, and at one blow cut of? his head as deXteroufly
as the mofi accomplilhed executioner in Germany could have
done, for, it feems, thefe creatures make ufe of wooden
{words made of hard wood, which will bearedge enough to
cut of? heads and arms at one blow. When this valorous
exploit was done, he comes to me laughing, as a token of
triumph, delivered me my {word again, with abundance of
furprifing geflures, laying it along with the bleeding and.
ghaiily head of the Indian, at my feet. 'e F,

Curiofity, and adefire of fatisfactton, animating me with
courage to fee this fcene of barbarity, I took try man Fri-
day with me, putting a {word into his hand, with the bow
and arrows at his back, which I perceived he could ufe
wvery dextroufl_v, cauling him to carry one'gun for me, and
1 two for myfell'; and thus equipped againfl all attacks,
away we marched directly to' the place of their bloody en-
tertainment. But when I came there, I was'flruck with
the utmcfi horror at {o dreadful a fpectaele, whilli Friday
was no way concerned about it, being no doubt in his turn
one ofthelc devourtrs. Here lav feveral human bones, there'
{everal pieces of mangled flclh, half eaten, mangled and
fcorchcd; whilli fireams of blood ran promifcuoully as
waters from a fountain. As I was muting on this dreadful
fight, Friday took all the pains he could, by particular '
'ligns', to make me underliand, thatlthey had brOught over
four prifoners to feali upon, three of whom they had eaten
up, and that he was the fourth, pointing to himfell'; that
there having been 'a bloody battle between them and his
great king, in the jull defence of whom he was taken pri-
t'oner, with many ozhers, all of thefe were carried 0!? to
different places to be devoured by their conquerors; and
that it was his misfortune to be brought thither by thefe
wretchcs for the fame purpnfe. - .

After I was made feufible of there things, I caufed Fri'
day to gather thofe horrid remains, and lay them together
upon a heap, which I ordered to be (e: on fire, and burn _.
them to allies; My man, hawever, {till retained the nature
ofa cannibal, having a hankering fiomach after fome of the
fielh; but'fuch an extreme abhorrence didl expre'l's at the
lealt appearance of it, that he durli not but conceal it; for
I made him very fenfible, thatif he offered any fuch thing, '
I would certainly fnoot him.

This being done, I carried my man with me to my came,
and gave him a pair of linen drawers, which I had taken
out of the poor gunner's chefi before mentioned , and
which, with'a little alteration, fitted him very well: in the
next place I made him ajerkin of goat's lkin, [rich as my
{kill was abEe to manage, and indeed I thought myfelf then
a tolerable good tailor. I gave him alfo a Cap whichI

made of a 'hare's (kin, very conv:-nient and fa:hi::;.able.-'r-- . .

Thus being clothed tolerably well, my man was'no lefs
proud of his habit, thanl was at facing him in it. Indeed. he _
went very awkwardly at lint, the drawers being too heavy
on his thighs, not fled to bear any weight, and the sleeves
of the waiileoat gilled his lh:uld.-rs and the iniidc of his
arms; but by a little ealing where he complained they hurt
him, and by uling himfulf to them, at length he rock to
them very well. . .

My next Concern was, where I lhould lodge him; and
that I might do well by him, and yet be perfei'lly eafy my-
felf, I eree'ted a tent {or him in the vacant prace between
' my two fortifications, in the inlide of the latl, and the out-
fide of 'the firli; and, as there Was an entrance or draw in-
to my cave, I made a formal framed door-cafe, and a door
to open on the infide; [barred it up in the night time, ta-'
king in my ladders too, fo that, was my man to prove treach-
- trons, there could be no way to come at me in the infide
of my innermcli wall, without making {a much noil'e in ,
getting over, that it mull needs waken me; for my tirlt
wall had now a complete roof'over'it of long poles, fpread-
ing over my tent, and leading up to the lide of the moun.
tain, which was again laid crofs with {maller flicks inllead
of laths, and thatched over a great thicknefs with the rice
flraw, which was as lirong as reeds: and at the hole of the
place, left on purpole to go in and out by the ladder, had
placed a kind of trap-door, which, if it had been attempted
on Ihe outfide, would not have opened at all, but have
fallen down, and made a great norfe: and as to my wea-

pans, every night 1 took them all to my bedlide.-
' 'But there was no occaficn for this precaution; for rarely
never mallet had a more fincere, faithful, and loving ler~
vant than Friday proved to me. W'ithout paflion, fallen-
nefs, or delign, perfectly obliging and engaging, his affec-
tions were as much tied to me, as thol'e of a child to its
parents; and I might venture to lay, he would have {acri-
filed his life for the faving mine, upon any occalion what-
foever. And, indeed, the many teltimtmies he gave me of
this, fuflisicntly convinced me thatl had no occafion to ufe
-thele precautions. And here I'could not but reflect with
great'wondcr, that, however it hath pleafed the Almighty
in his providence, and in the government of the creation,
to take from {0 great a part of the werld of his creatures,
the enabler! ufes to which their faculties, and the powers of'
their fouls are adapted; yet that he has bellowed upon

them the fame reat'on, affections, --fe_ntime'ut's of kindnefs- . C
and'obligation, paflirns of refentment,' line'erity; fidelity.
and all the capacities of doing and receiving good that he' .

.has given us; and that when he is gracioufly pleated to. .
cfl'er'them oceafions of exertirg. thefe, they are as ready,

- nay, more ready, to. apply them to the,prc'per ufes for,'
which they were bellowed, than we often are. Thefe
thoughts would make me melancholy, efpecially when I
.confidered how mean a ufe we make of. all thefe, even
-though we have thefe powers enlightened by' the, Holy
Spiritof-God, and by the knotvledge of this world, as an
addition to our nnderflanding; and why it has pleated the
heavenly wifdom to conceal the like {airing knowledge
from {0 many millions of fouls, who would certainly make
a much better ufe of jt than generally. mankind do at this

~ time. .Thel'e refleaions. would {ometimes lead me {a far

' . arraign the jufiice of faith an arbitrary diTpcfition of things; .

it up; checking my thoughts with this conclufion ;_ firfl, '
That we were ignorant 'of that right and law by which .

how i might depart from' this ifland, and get amongfl thofe

-canoes." In two canoes, thought I, what doesmy man
mean? furely he meanspne for himl'elf, and another for me;
and if mt,' how mufl two canoes hold me without being

'joined, or one part of my body being put in one, and ano-
ther in anather? And indeed it was a long time before'I

- underflood his meaning, which was, that it mufi be a large
boat as big as two Canoes, able to bear with the waves, and
not {0 liable to be overwhelmed as a final! one mutt be.

I believe there is no [late of life but what may be happy,
if peOple would but endeavour for their part to make it to.
He is not the happiefi man that has the mofl: riches; but he

=th'atl'is content with what he 'has. Before 1 had my fer-

~vant, I thought myfelfmiferable till I had him; and nowthat,
I had enjoyed the happy benefits of him, 1 [till complained,

and begged a deliverance from a place of retirement, cafe,

and plenty, where Providence had fufliciently-blefl'ed me.

In a word, from this time. lertertained fame hopes, that

me time or other"! might find an opportunity to make my

- efcape from this ifland, and thatthis poor favage might be

a great furtherance thereto. ~

All the time lince my man hecame {o intelligent as to un-
derliand and {peak to me, I {pared no pains nor diligence
to inflrufl him, accmding to my pear {hare of knowledge,'
in the principles of religion, and the adoration that he ought
to pay to the true God. One time, as I very well remem-
ber, l aflted him who made him! At hit! the innocent
creature did notunoerfiand whatl meant, but rather thought
I aflted nim who was his father? Upon which I took ano-

"ther way to make him fenftble, by demanding from him an
anfwer to this queflidn.- Friday, laid I, wno is it that made
the (ca, this glaund whereon we walk, and all thefe hilis
-and woods which we be held ? and here, indeed, I did no:
mils my intention; for helfl'd me it w'as'Old jBenamuckee
(the Gud whom I {unpofe thefe favsges adored) who lived
a great way beyond ail. But as to his attributes, poor Fri-
day was an utter (hanger. He could delcribe nothing of
this great perfon; and all tha: he could lay was, that he
,vwas very old, much older than the {ea and land; musical,"-

that all things, as you in particular, do not adore and wo's'w

0 to him," by which it may be reafonably fuppofed he"
meant adoration. And where, {aid I,'do the people ofyonr -_

' Such 'difcourfes; at the'fe- had _I 'wjth 'my man,"and inch)
made me fenfible, .that the true God is worlhipsd, though :
under imperfcet. fimiiitudes; and that the ialfe adoration?
which the Heathtns-give to their imaginary Deity,~is as great!
_an "argument of ' the: divine'efl'ence; as the. m-Jt- learned
Atheiits (fol/21} [3 called) can bring againfi it; for God:
_will be glorified in his ~works,'let their denomination, be,
what it will; .andl cannot be of, that opinion which ,{oma ' '
conceive, 'hat God ihould decree men-to be damned for '

therefore .cannot but conclude, that,- linee obedience is the

kitowledge; which they arepofl'efl'ed of, may,' undoubtedly, .
obtain .a happy falvation, though not that enjoyment with>>
Chritl,'as-hisl{aints,confefl'ors, and martyrs muli enjoy",

' But laying, thefe determinations alide,.rn9re fit for divine!
than me to difcufs,~[ began to inltrua my [aunt in the . '
{airing knowledge of the true Deity, in which the directions:-
of God'afHoly Spirit afliaed me. I lifted up my' hands to. .
Heaven, and pointing thereto, told him, that the great '
Maker of Heaven and Earth lived there ;_ that, as his infinite
. power faihioned this world out of a confufed chaos, and

made it in that beautiful frame which we behold, fo :he .-
ghverns and preferves it by his unbounded- knbwied'ge, '
fovoreign greatnefs. and peculiar providence; that he was . .
omni potent, could do every. thing for us, give every thing to
us, and take every thin'g away from. us; that he waaa re-'_
warder and punifher of good and evil aeiions ;_ that there was
nothing hut what he knew, no thoughts fo fecret but what he
could bring to light : and thus by degrees I opened his eyes,
ted'daicribe'd to him the manner of the ctlegation of the

Q .
World, the fittiation'of paradife; the tranfgrelhon of oust '

firfl parents, the wickednefs of God's peculiar- people, and
the uniuerfal fins and abominations of the whole_eerth.-'-
When thefe things were implanted in his mind, I to'd him,
that as God's juflice was equal to his mercy. he refolved, to
' deflroy this worid,' till his Son Jefus 'Chrill interpofed in bur
behalf; and, to procure our redemption, obtained leave of
his heavenly Father to come down from Heaven into the
wbrld, where he took human nature uponhim, inlirueted us -
in our way to eternal life, and died as a facrifice for our fins;
' that he was now afcended into Heaven, mediating for our
' ardon, delivering our pititio 18 and obtaining all thofe good
{enefits which we all: in his name, by humble and hearty
prayers, all which were heard at the throne of Heaven.--
A'a very frequently I tried to inculcate things into his mind
Friday one day told me, that if our great God could hear
us oeyond the fun, he mutt furely-be a greater God than
their Renaud", who lived but a little way ofi', and yet

cauld'not hear them till they afcended the great mountains, 'i

where he dwelt, to {peak to him. "What. {aid I, Friday,
did you go thither to {peak to him too? He anfwered,
" No, they never went that were young men, none but old
" men, called their ()arwatalec," meaning the indian priefis,
4' who went to 'fay 0, (in he called {aying their prayers.)
"and they returned back, and told them'what Bermuda

we Chritiians are, who have Gad'a immediate revelation '
for our certain guide; and mat'our faith is neither milled, '
nor our reafon impofed upon, by any fet of men, {uch as
thefe Indian impoflors. _ . >
But, to clear up this palpable chest to my man Friday, I
told him, that the pretence of their ancient men going upto

Friday, {aid l, Gad llill lttved mankind; and rhcugh the
devil temptu' human m: :m to far, he wool: nut chTer him
to have. an abtolute pun er over them. I have told you be-
fore of his tender lave to his people, till they, like Lucifer,
,Idiiobeyed his c-- mmands arri rebelled againll him; and
even tier>>, how Jefus Chrift, his only Sin. came to fave
finners. But fliil every man that lives in the world is un-
der temptation and trial. The Devil has yet a power, as
prince of- the air, to fag-gel} evil cogitations invour minds,
and prompt us on to wicked actions, that he might glorxin
our defiruction. Whatever evil th ughts we have, proceed
from him; fo that God, in this our dill: is, expects we
fhould apply curfclves to him by fervent prayer for {peedy
redrefs. He is hot like Benamuche, to let_ none come near
him but Oo-wa/iaker, but fufiers the pmple, as well as prielis, -'
to offer themfelves at his feet. thereby to be delivered from -
the power and temptation of thedevil. '

-But thnugh at full my man Friday eXprefl'ed fcme con-
sun at the wickednefs of Lucifer, I found it not {0 eafy to
imprint the right nations of him in his mind, as it was about
the divine eiTence of God; for there nature afiilied me in
all my arguments, to {how to him p'ainly the neeeflity ot a
Great Firtt Caufe, an overruling. governing Poiver 5, of a
fecret direCting Providence, and of the equity and reafon.
ablenefs of paying adoration to our Creator; whereas there
appeared nothing of all this in the notion of an evtl fptrit,
of his lirfl beginning.- his nature, and, above 'all, of 1mm-
elination to evil actions, and his power to tempt us to the
like. And indeed this unlearned Indian, by the more force
of nature, pgzzled me with one particular quefiions mow

tttin guide to Heaven; that is, the word of God ; belides
which. we had the comfortable views of his Spirit leading
us to the truth, and making us both willing, and obedient to
the infirue'tion of his, word. As the knowledge and prac- '
ti'ce of this are the principal'means of falvation, [cannot
fee what it avails any Chriltian church, or man in the world,
to amufe'himfelf with fpeculations and-opinions, "except it
be to difplay their particular vanity and affefliation. '
You may well Tuppofe, that, by the frequent difcourfe we
had together, my man and I became mod intimatelv ac-'
quainted, and that there was but- very little that I could fay
but what Friday underflood; and, indeed, he {poke very
fluently, though it was but broken Englilh. I new took a.
particular pleafure in relating all my adventures, efpecially
thofe'that o'ccured fince my being call on this illand. I!
made him underlland that wonderful myftery, as he con-
ceived, of gunpowder and bullet, and taught him how to
mom. I alfo prefented to him a knife, which pleated-him
exceedingly, making him-a belt, with a frog hanging there--
to, like tnofe in which we wear hangers in England ; and,
infieed of ahanger to put in the frog, I gave him-a hatchet,
which was not only as good, bu'teven a better weapon upon-
many oceafions. In a word, my man thus accoutred, look-
ed upon himfelf as great as Don Quixote, when that cele-
brated champion went to combat the windmill.
, a I next gave him a very particular defcription of the ter-
.'ritories of Europe, and in a particular manner of Old Eng-
land, the>> place cf my nativity. 1- laid before him the man.
ner of our worlhiping God, our behaviour one. to another,
and how we trade in {hips to every. part of the univerfe.--
I then told him my misf raunes in being fnipwrecked, (how-
ihg, as near as I coul 1, the place- where the {hip lay, which
had been gone long before; int 1 brought him to theruina.
of my boat, which before my whole firength could not move,
but now was almoll mum and fallen to pieces. I cbferved
my man Friday to view this heat with an uncommon cu-
riofity; which, When he had done, he [to d pondering a
' great while, and {aid nothing. At left, {aid 1, Friday,_what
-maltes you ponder fo much? He replied, " O mafier,' me '

fee like boat come to place at my nation." .. . _
It was lame time. indeed, befOte I underfiood what-my

man meant 5 but examining llriczly into it, I plainly (mind; .

, Ior tout-neon causes; 1091'
that l'ue'h another host refe'mhling mine, had come upon the '
country where he dwelt: that is to fay, by his farther explana-
tion, that the boat was driven there through firefs of weather.
It then came into my mind that fame Eumpean lhip having "
been can any the poor diflrefl'ed creatures were forced
to have recourfe to the boat to fave their lives; and'being
all, as I thought, drowned, I never concerned myfelf to all: .
any thing concerning them, but my only in'uiry was about
the boat, and what defcription my man coul give of it. _

' Indeed, Friday anfwered my demands very well, making
every thing very plain to my unde'rflanding; but beyond-
meafnre-was I fatisfled, when he told me with great warmth
and ardour, " O mailer, we fave white mans from drown ;"
upon which I immediately aflted him, if there were any ,
white mans, as he called them', in the boat? " Yes, yes,"
{aid he, " the- boat full, very full of white mans." How
many, Friday? {aid I. Hereupon he numbered hisfingers.
and counted feventeen. And when I allted him what he.
came of them all, and. whether they lived or not? he replied
"Yes, matter, they all live, they be live among my nation."
This information put frelh thou hts into my head, that thefe
mufl be th'ofe ,very_men ,w'no fore Iconcluded had been.~

. fw'allowed-up in the ocean, after they had left the (hip, that
i had firuclt upon the rocks of my kingdom. and after 'e'fcaq
ping the fury of the deep, landed 'upon the wild there, and: -'
committed themfelves to the fury of the devouring Indians.
The manner of their cruelties to one another, which con-
fequently, as I thought, mull he'afled with great barbarity.
to (hangers, created in me a great anxiety; and mademe .
kill more curious to at]: Friday concerning them. - 'He told
me, he was fure they ttiil lived there. having refided among
them. above four years, and that the fava'ges gave them vic-
tuals to live upon; But pray, Fridav,'faid [, whence prn-'
ceeded all thii good nature and generality? How came it-
to psfs that they did not- kill and eat them, to pleafe their
devouring appetites, and occalion {o fplendid an en:ertain-
ment among them i' " No. no,_" {aid Friday, " they not kill
, 'em, they make brethers with 'em~;" by which I underflood

there was a truce between them. And then I had'aimore' ' - -'.'

favourable opinion of the Indians, upon Friday uttering:

fonersn'f'i'vg . - ' - -
sme- eonfiderable time after, upon a very pleafant day,
in meih'ferene weather, my ,man and I Rood upon the top-
?of a hill, on the call fide of the ifland, whence I had once
before beheld the continent 'of America. Icould not tell-
immediately what'was the matter; for {uddenly Friday fell
a-jumping' and dancing as if he had been mad; and upon
my demanding the reafon of his behaviour, " 0 joy," {aid
he," 0 glad! there fee my country, there my nation, there -
"live white mans gether." And indeed fuch a rapturous
fenl'e of pleafure appeared in his countenance, that his eyes
had an uncommon fparkling and brightnefs, and {och-a
flrange eagemefs, as ifhe had a longing defire to be in his
country again'. This made me no: {0 well {arislied with
my man Friday as before; for by this appearance, I made
no difpute, but that if he could get back thither again, he
,would not only be unmindlul of what religion I hadtaught
him, but likewife of the great obligation he owed tn'e tor'
his wonderful deliverance; nay, that he' would not'only ino-_
form his countrymen of me, but accompany hundreds of them:-
to my kingdom, "and make ue a miferable families. like
4thofe unhappy wretches taken in battle. _
Indeed I was very much to blame to have thofe cruel and -
unjufl {ufpicionsg and mull freely own 1 wronged the poor
- creature very much, who was of a quite contrary temper.

- And had he had' that difcerning acutenefs which many Ena-
ropeans he ve, he would certainly haveperceived my cold-
nefs and indifi'erence, and alfo have been very much cons .
cerned upon that account: as l was now more circumfpea,
I had much lefl'ened my kindnefs and familiarity with him,
and while this jealoufy continued, I ufed that artful .way
(now to much in fafhiou, the occafign of Rrile and difl'en-

' - ficn) of pumping him daily, thereby ro difcover whether he

was deceitful in his thoughts and inclinations; but certainly
he had nothing in him but what was confifient with the be&
principles, him: as a religious Chriliian and a grateful friend;
and, indeed, I found every thing he {aid was ingenuous and. .
inn-cent, that 1 had no room for fufpicion, and,- injfpite of =
all uneafinels, he n0t only made me entirel his own again, >>
but alfo caul'ed me much to lament that ever'eoaceiic'd'

' I always kept it funk {or-fear of a difcovery,) We went botlr
into .it to fee how it muld manage {uch on expedition.

.And really never could any be more'dexterous iii rowing
than my faithful fervent, making the boat go an {alt a'gain as
I could. Well now, Friday, {aid 1, (hell we now. go to
your {0 much admired nation ? But~infiead of meeting with
that cheerfulnefs I expected, he looked very dull and me-
lancholy at my {aying (0; which indeed at Grit furp-il'ed me,
till he made me fenlible that his concern was about.
' the boat being too {mall to go fogfar a voyage. Uponv
- which I let him underfland I had a much. bigger; and, ac-

cordingly, the next day went to the place where the 5m
boat lay, which I had made, when all the firength I had, or.
art I could ufe, failed me in my attempt to get it into the
water:. but now-it havin lain in-'the funtwo and twenty;
years, and no care being ta en of it all that .while, it became.
in a' manner rozten. My man told me, that {och a boat.
would do very well for the p'urpofe, fuflicEent to 'carry<<
mugd'wilde, drink dread, {or that was .his manner of talking; '
In lhort, my mind. being flrongly fixed upon mydefigns of .5
going over with him to the Continent, I very plainly told
him that we would both go and make a boaufull as big, and .
more proportionable than that, whereimhe might {afely res -
turn to his own nation.

Thefe words made Friday look fo very penfive, that I.
thought he would have fallen at my feet. It was fame time- -
before he could'fpeak a word,.which made me.alk him what
was the matter withJ-iimP-He replied, in a very {oft'and
moving .tone, .." What hastpoor Friday done P why are you
" angry, mad with poor .fervant ?-.What me done, 0 what
" me donei'? Friday, {aid I, you never yet. have offended
me, what makes you think I am angry with you, when I am
not angry at all. "You no angry, no angry." laid. he,feveral
times; "if you be no 'angry, why den fend Friday over
" great water to my own'nation I1" Why {urely, Friday, an. -.
fwered I, did not you.wi{h to be there, when from a moun-
tain you beheld the;place where you was-born? and is it
hot to fatisfy your-defives that I am willing to give-you
leave to return thither?" Yes, yes," faid Friday, ". me will: ,
" to be there, fore enough, but. then me with mallerjhere
"' too: no wilh Friday there, no mailer there." In lhorr; .

hecould not endure-the.thcughts of gqin_g5here~with9i3t;ne, 4
I go there! Friday, {aid I, what {hall [do there? Hears},
fwered very quickly, "0 malier, you do greatdeal much-

' " you learn dzm to he fober, live good life. tokuow God,

in this folitudethau'ventu'e among fuch inhuman fainges.
Go your way, fince you defire it, and'leave me alone by
myfelf, as I was before I'faved your life. '

Never was any creature more thunderfiruckxthwn Friday
' was at thefe word's. "Go me away. leave mailer away,"
{aid he, after along (ilence, " no; no, Friday die, Friday lite
" not maker gone," 'as though he had 'faid, I' neither can

cannOthut take notice of the {iron ties'of friendlhip, which '

many times furpafs thofe of con anguiiity : 'For often we
find a great difagreement among kindred ; and when there

his' preferver and comforter; not a {ever-e and cruel tyrant,"

I was his phyfician, not only for his body but his foul ; and, ' .

Well.afte1; a great (catch for what was hell: and molt

better and clearer way to make a canoe than ever he knew
before; for he was for burning the hollow or cavity, ofthe
tree, in order to make this boat; g.'bnt 1 then told him how be
' might do it with tools, learning-him atthe fame 1ime~how 1
_ to ufe them. which indeed he did verrdexteroufly; to that '
in a month's time we linilhed 11, making 1t very handfome'
by cutting the outlide in the true lhape of a' boat. After
this it took us <<a full fortnight before we could get her new

ocean. ' . ' . - '
' No {ooner did.the feafonable weather begin to draw -
near, but {0 much was [elevated with this new defigne'd
adventure, that I daily prepared for the voyage. The lirft .
thing I thought on, was, to lay by a certain quantity of pre- -
vilions, as a fuflicient time for fuel: an expedtion, intend-
ing in a week 0r fortnight's tine to open the dock, and to .
launch out the boat for that purpofe. But one morning ad
.was very bufy upon. founething necefl'ary for this'cccaliohk .
I called Friday to me, and bid him go to the l'ea-fhorel and;
fee if he could find a turtle or tortoil'e, a thing which we
commonly had once a week, as much 'upon accOunt of the. '
eggs, as fo'r the fake of the fielh. {He had. not. been lon _
gone, but he came running back, as though he "was purfue
{or life, and, as it were, flew Over my outer wall. or fence,
like one that felt not the ground, or had llepsto let his feeton,'
and before I had time to inquire the reafon of his rectp'i;
- _tatSSon', hecries out, "0. dear Malls-1,0 (arrow, orrowl
; " Bad! 0 bad 1" Why what's the matter, Friday, {aid'L' .

{aid I.-they will came up as well as you, and my danger Is
as great as yours. But fince it is (0, we mull refolve to
fight for our lives. "What fay you 1' Can you'lig'wt,-Friday?
".Yes'," faid he, very faintly, "me (hoot, mekillwhatl

matter, laid I again, our guns will terrify thole we do~not

my blood. 'Now tell me if you will do the like by me, and
obey my orders in whatfoever I command? Friday then
ranfwered, ~"O matter, me lofe life for you, me die when
" you-bid die." Thus concluding all qneflions concerning
his fidelity, immediately I fetched him a- good dram of rum,
-(ofwhich lhad been a-very good hulband,) and gave it him
to comfort his heart, After he had drank it, Iordered him
to take the two fowling-pieces, which we always carried,
and loaded them with large {wan lhor, as big as {mall piliol
'bullets; then I took four mofltets, and loaded them with
two flags; and five {mall bullets each, charging my two
'piflols each with a brace t Ihung my great fword, as eul'o
'tomary, naked to my tide, and gave Friday his hatchet, as a
moll-e-xcellent-weapon for defence. .

Thus prepared, I thought as well of myfelf as any knight-
errant thatever handled a {word and fpear. -I took my per-
fpective glafs, and went up to the tide of the hill, to fee
what I could difcover; and I perceived very loan, by my
glal's, that there were one and twenty favages, three prifoners,
and three canoes, and that their chief concern leemed to

- be the triumphant banquet <<upon the three poor human
bodies, a thing-which by this time I had obfer'ved was very
common with them. I alfo remarked,'that they did-not
land at that place from whence Friday made his efcape, but
nearer to the creek, where thealhore was low, and where a
thick-wood came very 020533 to the fea. "My foul was then '

thought fit, he Would take vengeance on them him'felf, and
purilh thrm in a national way, according to their national
crimes ; but this was nothing at all to me, who had no con-
Ccrn with them. - Indeed my man Friday might jufiify him-

it was latt ful for him to attack them, which lcould not fay

Upon my thoughts all the way I went, that I only refolved
to place my felt' [a as to behold their bloody entertainment
without falling upon them, except {amt-thing more than or-
dinary, by God's l'pecial direction, fhould oblige me thereto.'
Thus fixed in my refolution, I entered into the thick wood,
(my man I'riday followirg me clofe behind.) when with all
pollible warinefs and filersce, I marched till I came to the
fltirt of it, on that tide which was the nearell to them; for
only one end of the wood interpofed between me and them.
Upon which I called very foftly to Friday, and thawing him
a great tree, that wasjuli at the corner of the wood, 1 or-
deted him to' repair thither, and bring me word if he could
plainly perceive their actions'; accordingly he did as 1 com-
mandeo him, and came back with this melancholy fiery,
that they were all about their fire, "eating the flelhof one of-
their prifoners; and that another lay bound upon the land,
at- a little difiance from them, which they deligned tor the

my foul was ready to link within me: when, afcending into

this profpee't, I perceived anather tree and a, thicket beyond
it, about fifty yards nearer to them than where Iwas, which,
by taking a {mall circle round, I might come at uh'e'ifcevered,
and then'I lhould be within half a that ohtheie devourers.
And this confideration alone, to be more perfectly revenged
upon them, made me withhold my paflion, though 1 was

landed 0n the 'main contin'mt. And what'do they intend
to do there I {aid 1. He replied, they have cancerted mea-
fares to Map, by building a wife]. but that they had nei-
ther tools nor provifions, lo that all their defigns came to
nothing. Suppsfiog, {aid I, I {hould make a propofal, and
invize them here, would they not carry me prifoner to'New
Spain P He anfwered no; for he knew them to be finch ho;
nell men, as would {corn to sift fuch inhuman bafenefs to .

would go over to them. talk with them about it, and bring,

he w uld nor only do the lame, but (land to the [all drop
, cf his blO'd, fhould there be occafion. .

Thefe folemn afl'urances 'made me refolve to grant them
relief, and to fend thefe two out {vi-that purpofe; but
when every thing was ready, the Spaniard? raifed an objec-
tion, which (jartied a great deal of weight in it>>: " You
" knew, Sir," {aid he; " that having been fume time With
" you, i cannot but be lenfihle of your llocklol' rice and

" lhould- vhey come over prelerttly, much- lefs to vietual'a'

" an occafin for them to dif=gree and rebel, as the children

" to wait" another harvefl,'and in the mean time cultivate

"5 plefly of maritime, in order to execute 0 tr defian."

Thig'advice of the Spamard's I approve-l extremely, and
{a midi d was I of his fidelity, tum. l elleemed him ever
after. And thus we a! four went to work upon fome move

uifc increal'ed 'my flocks of goals, by {homing the 'wfld

Not long it was,_before l perceived the boat to approach

{0 much 'oefired'prey) that made the wolves 'rnore ragingly
furiOus than they would have been, which was evident, by ,
thtir being at other times to ally afraid-ofa gur; but then
being exceedngl) hungry and furious upon that account,
'their ea; einel's to come at the hotter made them infallible
of their danger; and that, if we had not, by a continual
fire, and at lafl by the cunning tlratagem of the trait of

their nurnbcr had not overpowered us; befides, it wasa
great mercy we alightrd from cur horfe~, and fought- them
with that courage and ammo. which had we fdlled to do,
every man of us, with (or bealls, had been devotired ; and,
indeed, this was nothing but truth; brown, in my life,
was I to fenfihle. of danger, as when three hundred devils

Thus come to the end of my travels, I {don difco'v'ered
my new found eliate, and all the bills of exchanged had
were currently paid. The good ancient widow, my only
privy counlellor, thought no pai: s or tare too great to pro-
cure my advantage; nor had I ever occafion to blame her
fidelity, which drew from me an ample reward. l was fcr
leaving my tfl'ee'ts in her hands, intending to let out for

You may befure I could not but-agree 'with this kird and

handfome, modefi, fenfible, and well-bred; but mightily
concerned forethe lofs of his honoured mother, having lott.
his father at Barbadoes but a few months betore. He b'e- _

no right, and confequmtly is incapable of any compafiion.

then, he would run to the boat to. get (numbing, for him,
as a lump of fugar, dram, bifcuit, or {omething Or other that

It was on the 10th of April,--anno 1695. that I fetmy

thus talking, the man whom he fent, returned, acpompanied
by eleven more, but in fueh habits, that it was impoflible;
to tell what nation they were of. He firli turned to me,
and pointing to them, ."Thefe, Sir," {aid be, "are fame or:

tnrn=ng to them, and pointing to me, he'made them {anti-J

:they durli not venture tn than, but fleered northwards, 'fix
or feel-n hours, 'till they gained an opening, by which they
.plainly perceived, that the land that appeared from this
place, was not the main land, but an it'land. At their en.
trance into the opening of the tea, they difc0t'ered another

where or other, they put 'over to one of the wellern illands.
Here they found the natives very courteous to them, giving
them feveralroots and dried fith 5 nay, even their women

-too were .willing ,to fuppiy them with what they could .

procure them :to.eat, bringing it a great way to them upon
their heads. Among thofe holpitabie Indians they con-
tinued fome days, inquirin , by figns and tokens, what 413-.
-tions lay around them; an were informed, that there were
feveral fierce and terrib'e peOple ,Liwed every way, accul--
atom'ed to ;eat mankind ; but {tr themfelves they never ut'ed
{uch diet, except thot'e that were taken in batt'e,:and'9f

at this time, their king had two hundred prifoners, which 5

clude their unaccountable relation of their voyage, which
was both amazing and eme'staining, Hereupun, l allied
them where their new family was? 'They told me, they had
put'them into one of their huts, and they came to beg tome
victuals for them. This, indeed, made us all long to fee A
them; and taking F rilay's- father with us, leaving Only two
at our cattle, ,we came down to behold thefe posr creatures.
" When we arrived at the hut. (they being bound again
by the Epglithmrn, for fer of et'eaping,) we found them
flark naked, "petting their; fatal tragedy; they were '
three lufly men, we'l lhaped, with {height and good limbs,
between thirty and five and thirty years old ; and five wo-
men, two of them might be from thirty to fart), two more
'not above four and twenty; and the hit. .a comely tall
' maiden of about feventeen. Indeed, all the women w'ere
very agreeable, both in proportion and features. except
that they were tawny, -which their model! behaviour,'and
other graces, made amends fer, when they afterwards
came to b: clothed. ' ' '
"This naked appearance, together with their miferable
circumiiances, was no very comfortable tight to my Spa-
niards, who, for their parts, 1' may venture, Str, witaout
flattery. to fay, are men of the belt behaviour, calmell
temper's,-antl {weetell nature, that can poflibly be; for
they immediately ordered Friday's father .to fee if he knew
any of them, or if he underflood what they could fay.
No {coner did the old Indian appear. but he looked at
tnem- with great ferioufnefs; tet as they were not of his
nation, they were u'ter firan'gers to him, and none eculd
underfland his fpeech or figns, but one woman. This was
enough to anfwer his defign, which was to allure them '

" Well, after this, the Eneliihmen went to work, and, be-

they ereeled every one of them a new_hut Or tent for their

' very common, that the two hon- It men had the worlt wives,

next cortidereg whether. they {hould fire at the firtt who, or
wait for the three, and {make the middle.party, by which
the two firil and the fiye 13" would be feparated. in this
regulation the two favages ali'o conlit med them, by turning
a little to another part '0! the wood; bat the three, and the
_ :five after them, came direetly towards the tree. H-reupon
they re folved totalte them in~a direct line, as they approach-
ed nearer, becaufe. perhaps, the firll (hot might hit them all.
three; and upon t'is creation, the man who 'was to fire, '
charged his piece with three or (cur .bullets. And thus
while they were Waiting, the {wages came on; one of them '
was the runawar, who had canted all the mitchief: fo they
refolved he {hould not efcnpe, if they both fired at once.
But, however, though they d-d'nm fire together,.they were

third Was a little wounded in the (boulder. who, fitting
down on the ground, fell a {creaming in a molt fearful man-
ner. The noife of the guns, which not only made the moth
"founding echoes, frrm one tide to the other, but railed
the bi'hie of all forts, flattering with the molt ccnfufed noife,
fo much terrified-the five lavages behind, that they llood
tlill at firll,_ like {0 many inanimate images. But when ail
things were in profound silence, they came to the placewh- re
their companions lay ; and here, not being tentible that
they 'were liable to the fame fateyfiood over the wounded
man, undouhtcdiy inquiring the occafion of this calamity;
and 'tis a< resfonable to fuppofe, he told them, that it came
by thunder and lightning from tne gods, having never fun
or heard ofa gun he ore, in the whole courie of their lites.

By this time the Eng'ilhmen, hazing lnaded their pieces,
fired both together a. {econd time, when feeirg them allrfail-

not patience to [lay any longer: but, taking live Spaniards
along with them, armed wi'h four mulk-i-ts, a pillol, and a
quarter'ltafi', away they went in purfuit of their enemies.
As they paired by the place where the ravages WCIC flai'n.
, it was very eal'yto be perceived thatmore of them had
been there, having attempted to'carrv oi? their dead bodies,
.but found itimpraflicable. From a tiling ground. our party
had the mortification to fee the {tr oke that proceeded from
the ruins; when, coming farther'in fight of the lhore, they
-plainly perceived tha't the ravages had embarked in their
canoes, and were putting out to (ea. This they_ were very
forty for, there being no coming at them to give them a
parting falute; but.'however. they were glad enough to get
clear of fuel: unwelcome gnefls.

" Thus the two honefl, but unfortunate Engliflimen, being
ruined a fecond tine, and theirimprt vemc--nts quite demm ed,
moli of my good natured Spaniards helped th'em'to rebuild,
and we all aliilied them with needftzl fdpplies ;_nay, what is
' more remarkable their three mil'chievons countrymen; when
they heard of it, (whichwas after all thefedifallers were over,
they living mc re reinoteealiwardfi very friendly fympathized
with them, and warked for them {everal days; fo that in a
it 1e their habitations were rebni't, their necelii .ie's fupplied,
and themfe'ves reROred to their former tranquillity.

" Thoughthe favages had nothing to b'.att'.ofin this ad-
venture, (feveral-canues being driven alhore, followed by
two drowned creatures, having undoubtedly niet with a
form at Fea,that very night 'they departed,) yet it was natural
to be fuppcfid. that there whole better fortune it was to
Va-tain' their native lh'ot'e,~ would inflame their nation to:
another ruincus attmpt,' with a gieatvr force, to carry all
bt fore them. And, indeed, in it happened: for about {even
months af er, our illard was invaded witha moitfotmkable
navy, no_le{s than eight ani twenty canoes full of favages,
arm d with wooden {m rds, month-ans clubs, bows and
anon, and fuch like inliruments- of war, landing at the raft
end of the ifland. . .

" Yo: may well, Sir, imagine, what comet-cation our
men w'ere in upon this accent", and how {peedy they were
to execute their reiolut-ion, having only that night's time
allowed them. They knew th .t'fince they could not with-'
(land their enrm'es, concealment was the only way to- pro;
_ {are their {at-ct) ,1 and, thetzfere, they took dcm- the~huta 'or nbnmsou cantor. 183

,. that'were hail: tor the two Englilhmen, and drove their
flock of goats, together with their own at_ the bower, to the
old cave in the valley, leaving as little appearance of in-

habitants as pollible; and then polled theml'elves,-with_all.

their force, at the plantation of the two men. As they exe
peeled (0 it happened; for early the next morning, the
n

dians, l'eaving't'heir canoes at the call-end of the tllani, '

came'running along the lhore,L about two hundred and filly

in number,_as near as could begtitli'el. Ourarmy was but '

. little indeed ." and what was our greateli misfortune, we had ' '

not arms fuflicient for them. The account, as to the men>>,

'Sir. is at follOws; viz. l7 Spaniards, 5 Englilhmen, old Fri- -

day, the three favages, taken with'the five women,_ who

proved faithful fervants, and three other Gives. living with l

the Spaniards. To arm thefe, they had JI mulkets, 5 pic-
tols, 3 lbwl ng-pieces, '2 (words, 3 old halberts, 5 mulkets,
or fowling- pieces, taken from the [sailors whom you reduced,
As to the flaves, we'gave three of them halherts, and the
other, three lcng (Eaves, with great iron fpikes at the end
of them, with hatehets by their (ides; we alfo h d hatchets

the women, infpived with Amazonian fortitude, could not

and if they died, to die with them. Seeing their refolutiott,
we gave them hatchets likewife; but-what pleafed theta

three of his men to give fire, to great was their confiernar
tion. to fee {0 many'men killed and wounded, andhear fuch
a dreadful noife, and yet knew not whence it came, that
they were frightened to the highe'ii-degme; and when the
{econd volley was given, they"c'0ncluded" no 1er but that
their companions were [1 tin by thunder and lightning horn
Heaven. In this nation they wOuid have continued, had"
Will A'kins and his men retired, as' foon as. they had fired, -
according to order 3. or had the reli been near them to pour
in their that continually, the-e might have been a complete
vit'tory obtained; but liayigg to load their pieces again,-
. difcovered the whole matter. They were perceived by
fame of the {catering favages at a di'iance, who let fly their
arrows among them, wounded Atkins h'mfelf, and killed his ,
'fellow Englilhman, and one of the lndians taken with the
women. Our party did no: fail to anlwer them, and in their "
. retreat killed about twenty (wages. Here I cat-not but~'
take notice of cur poor dying flave, who though fiopt frOm
h'sretreat by a fatal arrow, yet with his fist? and hatch'et'
defperately and galla'ntly afl'ailed his pnrf'ners, and killed '
five of the [wages before his life {ubrnitted to a multiplicity
of wounds, Nor is the cruelty or malice of the Indians to
be lefs remarked, in,breaking the arms. legs, and heads of-
the two dead bodies, with their clubs and wooden lwords,
"aftera mofl wretched manner. As Atkins retreated our
party advareed, to interpzfc between him and the favages :
but; after three volleys, we were obliged t0_ retreat alfo ; for
, they were to numerous and defperate, that they came up to -
our very teeth, that their arrows~itke a cloud, and their
wounded'men, enraged with cruel pain, fought like madmen.
They did not, however, think fit to follow us, but drawing'
themt'eivetup in a c'rcle, they gave two triumphant {bouts in
token. ofvietbry, though they had the grief to. ice feveralof'
their wounded men bleed to death before them. j
" After 1 had. Sir. drawn up my little army tOgether upon -
a rilirg ground, Atkins, woundedtas he was,- would hive..-
had us 'aztatk the whole body- of' the Images at once. I'
was extremely weil pleafed with the gallantry of the man : 1
but, up n confiderat'on, I replied, 'SYon perceive, ,Seigq
. " nior Atkins, how their wounded men fight, .'let them:
" alone till morning, when they wili- berfaie't,,flifl', and to-e,'
" and then we {hall have fewer .to combat with." Tm

Atkins, for your part you have behaved very gallantly; and '
if you are not able to approach the enemy in the morning,
we will light for you, till then we thi..k it convenient to
wait, and {0 we tarrled. ' ,

,- " By the brightnefs of the moon that night, we perceived

the favage's in great dil'order about their dead and wounded '
men. This made us change our refolution, and-refolver'o
fell upon them in the night, if we could give them Qlie'vol.
lev'uadifcovered. This we had a fair opportunity to do.
by one of the two Englilhmen leading us round, between a
the woods and the {eadide weflward, and turning {hort'
(oath, came privately to a place where the thickelt of 'them'
were. . Unhesrd and unperceived, eight of tie-fired "among
them, and did dreadful execution; and in half a minute'
after, eight more of us let fly, killing and wounding abund-
ance of them; and then dividing oorfelves into three- bodies,
eight petfons iii each body, we marchedfrom Among the
trees, to the very teeth of the enemy, fending forth 'the'
greatefl {houts and acclamatiom. ,Th'e favages heari'g a
. different hoife from three 'quarters at once, Road in the
mm ltconfulion; but coming in fightpfhs, letzfiy, a~volley
of arrows, which wounded poor old Friday,'yet happily it '
did not prove mortal. We did not, however, give thetfi'lfi
{econd Opportunity; but rulhing in among them, we firech '
three" leveral'ways, and then fell to work with our (words, .,
Raves, hatchets, and the butt-end of our mulkets, with'a'

, fury nC-t to be refifled ; {0 that, with the mofl'difmah fcream-

ing and howling," they had recourfe to their feet, to fave their?

lives by a {peedy flight. Nor mull we forget the velour of

the two women; for they expoied themfelves to thegreateflb

' dangers, killed many wilt their arrows, and valiantly de-

firo'yed {event more with their hatchets. ' '

. " In fighting thefe two battles, we'were {0 much tired,

that we did not_then trouble ourfelves to" purl'ue theinf- to . ' ~

' required infinite labour to get them off. After our men had'

taken 'fome refrelhment and a' little repofe, they tctblved .-

l18'1. "Lure AND aws'nrtraes

early in the morning to go towards the place of their land; ' '
ing, and lee whether they were gone ofi',.or in what polture
.they remained. This recefl'arily led them to the place of
battle, where feveral of the favages were expiring, a fight
no way pleating to generous minds, to delightin mifery,
though obliged to'conquer them by the law of arms ; but
our own Indian {laves put them out of their pain, by de-
{patching them with their hatchets. At length coming in
view of the remainder of the army, we fotnd them leaning
upon their knees, which were bended toward their mouth,
and the head between the two hands. Hereupon, coming
within mufket-lhct of them, I ordered two pizces to be fired
without ball, in order to alum them, that we might plainly
know, whether they had the courage to venture another battle,
or were utteriy difpirited from fuch an attempt, that {c we
might accordingly marage them. And, indeed, the projeft
took very well; for, no fooner did the favages hear the fir!!-
yun, and perceive the Hath of the {eccnd but they fuddenly '
fiarted upon their feet, in the greatefi conflernation; and.
when we approached toward-s them, they ran bowling and
fereaming away up the hill irto the country. ' '
" We could rather,'at firli, have withed that the weather
had'permitted them to have gone off to the fear; but when
_ we ccnfider that their efcape might occa'lion the approach '
of multitudes, to our utter ruin and defolation, we were
very well pleated the contrary happened: Will Atkins
(who, though wounded, w0uld not part from us all the whife)
adyifed us not to let flip this_advantage, but clapping be-
tween them and their brats, deprive them of the capacity
of ever returning to plague the ifland: " I know," laid he, 1
" there is but one objtflion you can make._ whichhis, that.
" thel'e creatures living like beads in the wood, may make-
" excurfions, rifle the plantations, and defiroy the tame
" goats ;' but then, confider, we had better to dowith an -
" hundred men, whom we can kill, or make llues of at
" ltil'ure. than with an hundred nations, whom it is im>>
" pcflible we llrould fave. ourfelyes from, much lefs (ob-.2-
" due." This advice, and trefe arguments being approved
of, ue fet fire to their home; and thrugh they were Io wet
that we cauld not burn them entirely, 'yetwe made them
ir capable of {trimming in the feas. As food as the Indians
perceivel what we were doing, many of them ran out oFthe

"But all their complaints. fubmiflions, andentreaties,
were in vain; for'felf.prefervation obliging us to t-he'conf-
trary, we dellrbycd every one of them tfiat had ef'ca'ped the '
fury of the ocean, When the Indians perceived this, they '
railed a lamentable cry, and,ran into the woods, where-they
continued ranging about,'nialting the woodsring with their
Lamentations. Here we lhould have confide-1d. that making
thefe creatures thus dtfperate, we ought, at the fame time,
to have let a {uflic eat guard upon the plantations: for the
(wages, in their ranging about, found out the bower, de-
firoyed the fences. t'rosle the corn down under their feet, and
tore up the vines and grapes. It is true, we'were always '
able to fight thefe creatures; but as they where too fwiftfar
uS. and very nu =. erous, we dull n0t go out tingle, for fear ,
of them; though that too was needlefs, they having- no,
weapons,._nor any materials to make them: and, indeed,
their extremity appeared in a little time after.

" The poor creatures, thoroughly hu mble'd, being reduced
to about thirty-(even, joyfully accepted the'ofi'er, and'earn-
efily begged for food; hereupon we fent twelve Spaniards

of bread and rice cakes. with three live goats ;_ and the
poor Indians being ordered to fit down On the tide of the
bill, they ate the vie'tnals very thankfully, and have proved
faithful to the lat}, never trefpaliing beyond their bounds, .
where-at this day they quiezly and happily remain, and
where we now and then vifit them. They are confined to .
a neck of land about a mile and a halfbroad, and three or
four in length, on the fouth-eafl corner" of the. illand, the
fea being before, and lofty mountains behind them, free
from the appearance of canoes; and indeed .theircomtry-
men never made any inquiry after them. We'gave them

them to build huts, make wooden fpades, lant corn, make

In (hon, notE-ing could be built moreingenieufly', kept more

the men feldsm taughttheir wives the knowledge of Ged,'
any more than the failcrs' cuflom of {wearing by his name.
The greatelt improvement their wives had, was, they
taught them to {peak Englilh, fo as to be underflood.

None of their children were then above fix years old ';
they were all fruitful enough, and I think the cook's mate's
wife was big of her fixt'h child. _ '

When [inquired of the Spaniards about their circum-
Rances while among the lavages, they told me, that they

they had not only forgouen all that was pat't, but thought
he ought as much to be trufied with arms and neceli'aries
as any of them, which they tellihed by making him next in

but leaving them in a flourilhing condition, with a promife
to fend them further relief from Brazil, as lheep, hogs, and
cow 3, (being obliged to kill the latter at'fea, having no hay
to feed them.) I went on board the (hip again, the firfl of
May, l695, after- having been twenty days among them ;
and next morning, giving them a {alute of five guns at
parting, we let fail for the Brazils. The third day, towards
evening, there happening a calm, and the current being
very krone, we were drove to the N. N. E. towards the
land. Some hours after we ,perceived the {ea covered
as it were with {omething very black, not eafily at firfl to
be difcrvered: upon which our chief mate afcending the
{hroudsa little way, and taking a view with the perfpee.
tive glafs, he Cries out, " An army! an army!" " You
fool," {aid 1, " what do you mean ?" " Nay, Sir," {aid he,

. " don't be angry, I afl'ure you it is not only an army, but a
fleet too, for I believe there are a thoufand caroes paddling
along, and making with great halle towards us." ,

Indeed, every one of us were furprifed at this relation;
and my nephew, the captain, could not tell what to think
of it, but thought we lhould all be devoured. Nor was 1-
free from cOnccrn, when Iconfidered how much we were
bee-aimed, and what a flrong current {et towards the [bore ;
however. I encouraged him not to be afraid, but bring the
{hip to an anchor, as [con as we were certain that we mutt
en age them. Accordingly we did 1'0, and furled all our
fails; as to the {wages we feared nothing, butonly that
they might fer the {hip on tire; to prevent which, I ordered
them to get their boats out. and falten them one clofe by the
head, and another by the Item, well manned, with flteets and
buckets to exringuith the flames, ihouldit fo happen. 'The
{arages {oon came up with us, but there were not {0 many

' were only one hundred and twenty ; too many indeed 'for

_ As they approached us, they-{cemed tobe'in the great-
ell amazement, not knowing what to make-of us. ' They'
rowed. round the lhip, which occafioned us to call to the
~ men in the boats not to {utter them to come near them.--
Hereupon they beckoned to the larages to keep back, which
they accordmgly'did; but It'their retreat they let fly about
5ft? {from among us, and very much wounded-one of our
men in the long-boat. I called to them not to fire upon
any account, but handing them down fome deal boards, the
carpenters made them a kind of fence to lhield them from
the arrows. ln half an hour after they came fo'near alter-n.
of its, that we had a perfea>> fight of them ; then they rowed
a hide "all" out, till they came diret'lly along-tide of us,
and then approached'fo near, that they could hear us 'l'pealt:
this made me order all my men to keep clote, and get their
guns ready. In the mean time I ordered Friday to go out-
upondeck. and all; them in his lan uage what they meant.
.No fooner did he do fa, but fix 0 the favages, who were
in the farmer canoes, limping down, thawed us their
naked hacklides, as much as to fay in Eaiglilh, Ki/rour

So enraged ,was I at the-death of-.poor Friday, that the

did 'the. gunners fail in their aim, but at. this broadlidefplit- '

neither eat nor fpeak; but 1 tool: a way to cure him, by
ordering them to throw him into the tea, whichthey did,
and then he came fwimming back like a cork, calling in his.

So coric us was I to view every corner of the world where
_ I came to, that I went on more-as often as I could. One
evening when on more. we ohl'ervc'd' numbers of the people
hand gazing at orata dillance. We thought ourfelvcs in
no danger, as they had hitherto ofed us kindly. However
ave cu'. threebmghs out of a tue,'flieklng them at a dziiance

of truce and am:ty, bit; when po'esor boughs are let up on

their cleaves, however, there i- one principal thing. to be
regarded, that neither' par-2y come beyond one anozher's
three poles or bonghs; {0 that the middle {pace is not only
fecure. but is alto allowed as a market for tnfiie anticom-
nerce. Ween the trace is. thus accepted, they tliclt ups

armed; but if any-violence is Ofe'ed,'RW'y thes- run to
their poles, take up their weapzns, and then the mice is
at art-end. This evening it happened th-.t a greater num-
..ber of . peotile than ul'oal. borh men and women, traded
fimong us for {och toys as-we had, with 'fueh greaLcivility,
that we made'ns a little tent. of large bonghs of trees, {03"}

are, I .and {omemhers took our lodging: in theboae. wit -

' ogh's of trees {pread .over it, having. a fail {pread atthe
honour to lie upon. About two o'clock in the morning we
were awakened by the firing of mufltett, and tour men'cry-
ing out. for help, or elfe they would all be murdered. Scarce
had we time to get the boatalhore, when our men came
plunging theml'elves in'o the .wae'er, with about four hon-
d'red of'theiilanders at their heels. We took up (even of
the men, three of them very'rnnch wannded, and one left
behind killed, while the "enemy poured their arrows in
thick among us, that-we were forced to make a barricade,
with hoards lying at the lide of the boat, tolhield ns'from-
danger; and, having got ready oor' tire-arms, we returned
them a volley, which wounded federal of them, at mecoold
hear by their cries. In this condition we lay till brealt' of
day. and then making fignalt of dilhel's to- the lhig, which
.my nephew, the captain, heard and underfiood, he weighed
anchor, and flood as near the (hon as poflible, and then
{at another boat wath ten hands in her to allifi us; bu: we
called -to them not to come'neardnfnr'ning themof our un-
happy condition. However they ventured; when one of
the men taking the end of'a tow-lice in one hand. and keep-
ing our boat between him and our adverfaries, (warm to us,
and flipping ~ ur cables, they towed us 0m of reach of their
arr-ws, art" quickly after a broadlide was trivsn them from
the (hip, which made a mall dreadful havock among them.
When we gn-t on board, we examined into the occafion of
this frav. Tinr men who fled informed us, that an old wo-
man, who {dd milk within the poles, had brought a young
woman with her, who carried roots and herb, the fight of
<<ham {0 much tempted our men, that they offered rude-
nefs to the maid, at which the old woman let up a great
acry; nor would the failors part with their prize, bu. carried
her among the trees, while the old womar- 'went and

When. we came to the Gulph of Perfia, <<five of our men .
who ventured On there, were either killed or made flavea
by. the Arabians, 'the ret't'of them having featee time to
'efcape to their boat. This made me upbtaid thm afrelh

which the boatfwain very warmly :Jked me. " Whether

flutters than the relt of the Galileans? and befidee, Sir,"
kid he, " none of there titre poor men that are lot]: wette-

therefore your reprefentationt are very unjufl, and your ap--
plication improper. Befides," added he, " you are con-.
tinually ufing the men very it] upon this account, and, be-
ing but a pafienger yourt'elf, we are. no: obliged to bear it ;

notleave this dircourfe, as alf0~n0t concern yourfelf with

All this I heard very patiently; bulgit being-often re.-

was none of his bufinet's; that I was a confiderahle owner
in the fltip, and therefore had a tight to {peak in common,

This danger indeed fiartled not only my partner, butlike-
wife all th'e'ihip's company; {a we 'changed our former are;
Elation, and r'efolved to go to the coali of "Fort uin, and'

. we fie'ered away N. N. E. about 50 leagues off- the ulna!
courfe to the eafl, which put us to fame inconveniences.
As the wind blew fleadily againii us, ~on? voyage became
more tedious, and we began to be afraid of want of provi-
fions; and what wae fiill worfe, we apprehended, that as

there 'thipe, from whole boars we had efeaped, were bound '

'to'China, they might'get before us, and have given frelh

' information, which might create another vigorous -purfuir.

It was eafy to read my dejeaion in my countenance. My

who being orerpowered by blafphemou's and perjured evi-
. dances, wickedly refolved to take away their Him, or ruin
their reputation, have no other-recourfe in this world to

' . cafe their furrow, but fighs, prayer;, and tears. My partner

{eeing me {o concerned, encouraged me as well as he could;
and after defcribing to me the feveral ports of that ccati,
he told me, he wou!d either put me inon the coali ofCochin-
China, or elfe in the. Bay of Tonquin, from whence we might
go to Macao, a town on'ee pofl'efl'cd by the Portuguefe', and
when kill many European families refided.'y " .

" And will you deliver one melfage from me to them?"
" Yes," {aid he, " if you will give it under your band, that
I may prove it is not of my own production." Hereu'pon
I wrote a large account of their' attacking me in their long.
boat, the pretended reafon and tinjull defign of it ; that
they had done what they might be afliamed of, and cauld
not anfwer for at any tribunal in England. But this letter .
Was writ in vain. Providence Ordered things another way.
We failed diree'tly for Nanquin, and in about thirteendays

in this exigency, and would very gladly have been on lhore

would fail to the fouthward about two and fortyleagues,
there was a little port called Quinchang, where no Eurm
pean .lhips ever came, and where we'might confider. what
was further to be done. Accordingly we weighed anehon
the next day, calling only twice on {hereby the way to
get frelh water. The country people very courteoufly

city, I went to One of their villages,- where'there was
to be one of their solemn sacrifices. There I beheld.

upon the stump of an old tree, an idol of wood, moreugly '

than the representation of the devil himself: its head
resembling no living creature; it's ears were as big Iand as'
high as goats' horns, a crooked nose, four-cornered mouth,
and horrible teeth ': it was clothed in sheep skins, had it

great Tartar bonnet," With twohorns rowing through it. .

and was eight feet'high, without feet, egs. or pro A rtion'.

'Beforethis Idol th'ere lay sixteen or seventeen eop e; who -

brought their ofi'erings, and were making. at pra era;
"while at a distance stood three men and one bul ocl, as
victims to this ugly monster. , _.

Such st" _ ndous sacrilege as this in robbing the true
'God of'his femur, tilled me with the greatest astonishment:
andreflectiont. which soon turning. to rage and .. tiny. I'
rode up to the image, and cut in pieces the bonnet that
was upon his head with my sword, so that it hung down by

one of the horns, while one bf my men that was with. me- -- .

-. ulled at it bl his' sheep slrin garment. Immediately an
sEideous howling and outcry ran through the village,'_ and-
*two or three hundred people coming about Our ears, we
were obliged to fly for it. _ .

' But I had .not done with the--monster; for the caravan
being to rest three nights in the town, Itold the Scots mer-
-chant what'l'had seen, and that! wasresolved to take four

<<or-five men well armed with me, in order to destroy the'

idol, and show the' peeple how little reason they had to trust

'in a grid who could not save himself: At first he laughed.

the god Shalrlsar, belonging to theTongueses. Upon which
believing this cunning Tartar, who was servant to our Mus-
covites, away they drove to Shiheillta, and in less than three.
minutes were outofsight, nor did-we ever 'hearof them more.
. When we came to the city of garawena, .we rested five>>
days, and then entered into a'frightful desert, whichheld us
twenty-three days march, infested with several small com-g
panics - of robbers,. or.Mogul Tartars, who never had the
courage to attack us. ' After we had passed over this desert,
we found several garrisonsto defend the caravans from the
violence of the Tartar-s; In particular the Governor of Ad'in.
skoy offered us a guard of fifty men to the next station, if
we apprehended anydanger. The people .here retained
the same paganism and barbarity. only they were not so
_ ,dangerous, beingconquered by the M pscovit-es. The cloth-
ing, both of menand women, is ofihe skins of beasts, living
under the ground in vaults and caves, which haste a com.
.municat'ion with one another.- They have idols almost in
every family; besides, they adore thesun and stars; water
and snow; and the least uncommon thing-that happens in
:the elements, alarms thern'ss much as thunder and light-
Ding does the unbelieving Jews. ~ '
. Nothingremarkable occurred iniour march :threugh'this
-country. When wehad gone through the desert, after two
days farther-travel, we came-1:0 Jenezoy, a Muscovite'city,
on the greatxiver so.called,mhich we were told parted Eu-
rope from Asia. Eltie inhabitants here werevery little bet-

served to me, that: the Czar-rather converts the'Tarta'rs
. with soldiers than'clergymen, and is more prund to make
ghem faithful subjects, that) good Christians. . . .
From the city .to the river Oby, we travelled over .a
pleasant, fruitful, but very uncultivated .country,' for want
of good management and people,'and those few are most]
Pagans. This is the place where the Muscovite-crintina s
are banished to, if they are. not put to death... 'The'ne-xt

_-quantity of sablc s, black fox skins, line. ermiries', &c.
(which I'sold at Arehangela't a good price,).we set out from .
this city the beginning ol'June, making a small caravan,-be-
'ing about thii'ty-two horses and camels, of which I repre-
sented the head. My young Lord had with him a very
faithful Siberian servant, well acquainted with the roads.
. We shunned the principaltowns and cities, as Turner), Soli,
Kamosltoi, and several others, by reason of their strictness
in examining travellers, lest any of the banished persons of
distinction should escape. Having passed the rivet Kama,
we came to a city on the European side, called Soloy Ka-
moslroi, where we found the people mostly Pagans as before.
-We then passed a desert of about two hundred milesoves;
hut in other places it is near seven hundred. In passing
this wild place, we were beset by a troop of men on.horse-
back, and about five and forty men armed with bows and
arrows; At first they looked earnestly on" us, and then
placed themselves in our way. -We were above. sixteen
men,- and drew up a'lit'tle line before our". camels. ,My
young Lord sent out his Siberian servant to know" who
they were; but, when he approached them, be neither
knew a word they. said, nor'would they admit him tocome
- near them at-his peril, but prepared to shoot him. .At his
return, he told us he believed them'to be Calmucle Tar-J '
' tars; and that there were more upon the desert. This was ~
but a small comfort to us; 'yet seeing a little grove, about '
a quarter of a mile distance, we moved to it, by'the. old
Portuguese pilot's advice, without meeting with anyoppo-
sition'. Here we found a marshy piece of-gr'ound, and a
spring of water running into a little brookon "one side,
which joined another like it a little farther oil", and these

When I was in Portugal, there was held at that time the
court of justice of the inquisition; All the criminals'were- '
carried in procession to the great church, where-eighth!"
them were habited in gowns and caps of canvas, whereon
the torments of hell were displayed, and' they were con.-
demned and burnt for crimes against the Catholic faith and.

' I am sorry to make any reflections upon Christians-g but:
indeed in Italy the Roman religion seems the most cruel and:
mercenary upon earth ; and a veryjudicious person, who.
travelled through Italy. from Turkey, tells, " That there is-
~ " only the face and outward pomp of' religion there : that
" thechurch protects murderers and assassins, and then de--
" livers the Civil magistrates overto Satan for doingjustice 5
"-interdicts w-hole kingdoms, and shuts up the churches for
" want of- paying a few ecclesiastical dues, and so puts a,
"a stop to religion for want of their money : - that the court
"of inquisitiou burnt two men for speaking dishonnurably.

S' that Italy .was the theatre, where religion was the grand.
" "per-a ; -and that the- popishclergy were no other than.-
" the stage players." ' ' - '

As to religion in Poland, they deny Christ 'to be the
MeSs-iah, or that the Messiah'has come in the flesh. .And
as..to their Protestants, they are the followers of Lzelius So-
cinus, .who denied our Saviour's' divinity ; and have no con-
cern about-the divineinspiration ofthe Holy Ghost. -

' they have but wooden.prt'ests, though of the Greek church ;

. they pray as much to saint Nicholas, as the Papists do to the .

- As to the Lutherans, they only differ from the Romans in .
believing consuhstantiation, inStead of transubstantiati'on ; V

till the eneral pacifiCation of the German troubles at the

, rans; and should I take a prospect at home, what unhappy
divisions are between Christians in this kingdom, about '
Episcopacy and Presbytery; the church of England and the
Dissent'ers opposing one another like St. Paul arid St. Peter,
even' to the face; that is, they carry on the dispute to the
utmost extremity. 4
' It'might be a question, why there are such diti'erenees in
religious points, and why these breaches should be more
hot and irreconcilable ? All the answer [can give to this,
is, that we inquire more concerning the truthof religion,
than any other nation in the world ; and the anxious con.
cern we have about it, makes us jealous of every opinion, _
and tenacious of our own : and this is not because we are t
more furious and rash than other people; but the trutli is', s
we are more concerned. about them, and being sensible that
the Scripture is the gr'ea't rule of faith, the standard for. life

and doctrine, we have recourse to it ourselves, witheutaubs
mitting to any pretended infallible judge upon earth.

'There is another question pertinent to th'e former, and
that is, \V'hat remedy can we apply to this malady? And to
this I mustnegatively answer, Not. to be less religious, that
we may differ the less. This is striking at thevery root of
all religious differences ; for, certainly, were-they to lie
carried on with a peaceable spirit, willing to be informed,
our variety of opinions would not have the name of difi'ero
ences; nor should we separate in communion ofthatity,
though we did not agree in several articles of religion. ' .. -'

Nor is there a less useful question to start, namely, thr -.

or as men's certain convictions of truth. are not equal to
one another-tor the weight of significancy of such veracity,
so neither can a general effect of this atfliir be e'itpected on
this\side of time. ' _ .

.Before I conclude this chapter, 1 shall beg leave to disa-
course a little on the wonderful excellency of negative re-
li ion and negative virtue. The latter sets out, like the
P arisee, with--God,'l thank thee : .it is a piece of religi-
ous pageantry, the hypocrite's hope: and, in a word, it is
positive vice : for it is either a mask to deceive others, are
mist to deceive ourselves. A man that is clothed with ne-
gatives, thus argues: I am not such a drunkard as my landh '
lord, such'a thiei'as my tenant, such a s'wearer as his neigh.
hour; neither am I a cheat, an atheist; a raltish fellow, or
a highwa 'man; no} I live asober, re ular, retired life: I
am a good man, I go to church; God, thank thee. Now,
though a man boast of his virtue in - contradiction to the
Vices mentioned, yet a person had better have them alto--

gether than the man himself; for he is full of himselfg'so . -

persuaded that he is good and religious encugh already.
that he has no thoughts of any thing. except it be to pull'ofi'
,his hat to God Almighty now and then, and thank him that
he has no occasion tor him ; and has the vanity to think
that his neighbours must. imagine well of him too. ' .
The negative man, though he is no drunkard, is yet in,-
toxicated with the pride of his own worth; a good neighe
_ hour and peace-maker in other families, but a tyrant in his

own; appears in a church for a show, but neverfalls upon . .-

his knees in his closet ; 'does all his alms before-men, to be .
seen of them; eager in the duties of the second-table, but
re ardless of the first; appears religious, to betalten notice,

which is meant, religious knowledge; for itt'ollows: "Then

shalt thou understand the fear of the Lord, and 'find' the

knowlcd re of God." By which undoubtedly he meant to

inquire a ter every thing he has permitted us to'know, and
not search into those ways that are unsearchable, andare

effectually locked up from our knowledge--Now, " as
listening to the voice of Providence" is my present subject,

. I intend, in the first place, to write to those who own--l.

That there is a God, a first great. moving cause of all things,

an eternal power. prior, and consequently superior to all

created power or being--'2. That this eternal power, which

is God, is the sovereign creator and governor of heaven and
earth. '

To avoid all needless distinctions, what persons in the God-
head exercises the creating, and what the governing power,
I oti'er that glorious text, Psal. xxiii. 6: where the whole
Trinity isentitled to the whole creating work: and therefore,
in the next place, I shall lav down these two propositions:

I. That the eternal God guides, by his Providence, the
whole universe, which was created by his power. ~

ll. That this Providence manifests a particular care over ,
and concern in, the governing and directing man, the mos L
noble creature upon earth. . ' '

It is plain. that natuiul religion proves the first, by intio
mating the recessity of at Providence guiding and govern:
ing the world; iron) the consequence of the wisdom, justice,
prescience, and goodness of the. Almighty Creator: for
otherwise it would be absurd to think, that God should
create a world, without any care or providence over it, in
guiding the- operations of nature, so as to preserve the
order ofhis creation.

Revealed religion gives us a light into the care'and con:
cern of his providence, by the climate's being made habit-7
able, the creatures subjected and made nourishing, and all
vegetative life made medicinal ;' and all this for the salte of
man, who is made vic'eroy to the King ofthe cart'h.' The;
short description I shall 'give of Providence is this: "That"
it is that operation of the power, of the wisdom, justice,
and goodness of God, by which he influences, governs, and,
directs, not only the means, but the e-.- nts of all things,
Which concerns us in this sublunary world ; the sovereignty .
of Which we ought alwaysto reverence, obey its motions," '
observe its dictates, and listen to its voice. The prudent,25.6.; ' , Lira m an'vmruus
man foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself ;' that is, as I- tak'e'
-it,':'tiiere is a secret Providence intimates to us, that some
danger threatens, if we strive not to shun ig'."
7The same day that Sir John Hotham kept nutHull against
the" royal Martyr King Charles I. the same day Sir John
Hotbam was put. to death by the parliament for that very
action: The same day that the King himselfsigned the war.
rant for the execution of the Earl of Strafi'ord, the same day

' , of the month was he barbarously murdered by the blood-

_ thirsty Oliverian'crew: and the same day that KirigJameslI.
came to the crown a ainst the bill of exclusion, the sam'e
day he was voted 3 dicated by the parliament, and the
throne filled with King William and Queen Mary.

The voice'of signal deliverances from-sudden danger, is.
not only ajust call to repentance, but a caution a ainst fall-
ing into the like danger; but such who are utter y careless~
of, themselves after, show a lethargy of the worst nature,
which seems to me to be a kind of practical atheism, or at'
least living in a contempt of Heaven, when he receives
good at the hand of his Maker, but is unconcerned from
whence it comes,' or to thank the bountiful hand that gave
it; neither; when he receives evil, does it alter hismannerr
oflii'e, or bring him to any state of humiliation.

We have a remarkable story of two soldiers being con-
demoed to death in Flanders. The General being prevailed,
upon to spare one ofthem, ordered them to cast dice upon,
the drum-head for their lives; the first having thrown two
sixes, the second fell a wringing his hands, having so poor a-- .
chance to-escape; however,having thrown, he was surpriseds .
when he also'threw other two sixes. The oficer appointed
to see the execution, ordered them to throw again; they
did so, and each of them threw fives; at which the soldiers-
that stood' round, shouted, and said, neither of them was to~
die. Upon this, the oflicer acquainted the council of war,.
who ordered them to throw a third time, when they threw
two fonts: the'General being.acquaint'ed withit, sent- for
the men, and pardoned them ; I love,_said he, in such,ex---
traordinary cases, tolisten to the voice ofPIOVidence. i

those ages of the world, it was believedthat spirits inter-
meddled in the affairs of mankind; and throughout the Old

tradicts it. All the pains and labour that some learned men
have taken, to Confute the story ot'the witch ofEndor, and.
the appearance of an old man personating Samuel, cannot
make such apparitions inconsistent with nature or religion>>;
and it is plain, that it was either agOod or a bad spirit, that
prophetically told the unfortunate-icing .What should happen
the next day; for, said the spirit, " The Lord will deliver:
"thee into the hands of the Philistines; and to-morrow

afterwards found what it'was, the remains of this surprise;
did not wear off for-a great while; and I had frequently,
returns of those vapours on different occasions, and some-
times without any occasion at all.

One night, after having seen some appearance in the air,
as I.had just laidydown in my bed, oneof my feet pained

me; alter that came a numbness, succeeded with a tingling '

inmy blood; when on a sudden I thought something alive
gla'y upon me, from my knee to above half my leg. Upon

3. That the inconstancy of such. notices, in Eases'equa'llyt ' "

4. That as our most distinct dreams had nothing in them of
any significancy, it would be irrational and vain to'think
that they came from heaven. And, .5. That as men were
not always thus warned or supplied with notice of good-0t
evil, so all men are not alike supplied with them ; and what
reason could we give, why one man or 'one weman should
not have the same hints as another? ' . - '
To all'this the clergyman gave answer: 1. That as to
the signification of dreams, and the objections against them,
as being dark-and doubtful, they are expressed geherallyjby
hieroglyphical representations,similies, allusions,and figuraSS .
tive emb emetic ways; by whichrneans, for wantbfinter'g: \.

power to avoid it; for, if any one had "notpowe'r to amid; .-".
the-evil, it was no notice to him: and it was-want of'gifin'gf
due heed to that notice, that men first neglected themselves, '
and then charged the Judge of 'all the earth with injdsti'c'et'

3. That we'ought not. what! fault with-the inconstahcy 'o'f '
these notices, but rather with our weak understandings}:

' by pretending dreams were not to be regarded, and" negliS-f' ..
gent when the'voice really spoke to us for our good. ' [t is" _'
,a mistake to say-dreams have no import at all: We might,
with more reas'on,' have said, none that we could perceire' ..
the reason of, owing to our blindness and supine negligence,
too secure at one time, and toom'uch alarmed at- another ;'
so that the spirit, which we might be said to he'conversing'
.with in a dream, was constantly and equal! kind and care.
(<<sly-hut our powers are not always in t 'e same state'o'i"

action, not equally attentive to, or retentive of' the hints

spirits; he could'not call it a stated converse :' such a thing:
there-was, but why there Was so much of it, and no more,
was none of his business, and that no such discoveryhad
ever yet been made to mankind; Nor were we tovimagine'
less of wa'k-ng dreams, tranres, visions, noises; hints, im~~
pulses, and all the waking testimonies of an invisible world,
and of the communication that there is between us and'
them, which commonly entertain us with our open eyes.

' 'One time my fancy soared on high, to seewhat disc0v-
verics l t'ouldmake in those clearer'regions; I~found that:
such immense bodies as the sun, stars, planets, and moon, ,
in the great circle of the lower heaven, are far from being .
found in the study of nature on the surface ot'the earth"
Here I saw many things that we can" entertain-little or no'
notion of, in a'state of common life, and the emptiness of
our notion, that the planet's-are habitable worlds; that is,
createdi'likc ours, for the subsistence and existence of man-
and beast, and the-preservation of the vegetative-and sensia'
tive life: No, no; this is, I assure you, a world ofspirits ;,.
for here I saw a clear demonstration of Satan being the:
prince of the power of the air, keeping his court or Camp,
with innumerable angels to attend him ; but his power is
not so great, as we imagine, he can tempt us to the crime,
but cannot force us to commit: I-Imrranum est pcccarc. N ei-r
ther has the devil power to force theworld into a rebellion
against heaven, though his legions are employed among
savage nations, to set up their master for a god, whomake
the heathens'either worship him in person,or by his repre- .
sentatives, idols and monsters, with the cruel sacrifiees of
human blood. Now, as to the limitatiens of the devil's _
power, you must "understand, that, as there are numbers of
evil spirits employed in mischief, so there are numbers of
good angels sent from the higher and blessed abodes to dis-
concert and Oppose their measures; and this every Christian,
I hope, believes, when he prays to God, the father ofspi-
rits, to give his angels charge over him while he slumber-
eth and sleepeth. For if by these preventing powers the
devil was not restrained, the earth" would be subjected to
dearth, dronghts,-and famine; the air infected with noxious ,
fumes ;-' and, in a word, mankind would be utterly destroyed,
which might oblige our Maker (if I- may be allowed the

7
' expression) to the necessity of a new flat, or else have nit-i:
more creatures to honour, and worship'him. . . ' .' '

As the devil never wanted insinuators, 'I shall obServe '
<<that'I learned'a way how to make a man- dream of whatI
pleased. For instance, let us suppose'one to be sound
asleep; let another lay his mouth CIOSBLtO his ear, and whis<<-'
,per any thing so softly, as not to awake him, the sleeping
.manshall dream oftwhat has been so whispered in his ear;
.nay, Ican assure you, those insinuating devils can do this
even whenwe are awake, which [call impulses of the mind:
:for from whence, but from theseinsinuators, come our cause--
'less passions, involuntary wickedness, or Sinful desires? Who
.else form ideas in the mind ofman when he is asleep, or pre-
sent terrible or beautiful .figures to his fancy ? Mr. Milton
represents the .devil tempting Eve in the shape of a wad,
'lyingjust at her car, when in her bower she lay fast asleep;
and 'brings in Eve telling Adam what an tuneasyhnight's
rrest she had, and relating her dream to him. And likewise
:I believe that good Spirits have the same intercourse with
us, in warning us against those things that are evil, and
.promptingvus to'that which is good. .

Were we to have the eyes of our souls opened, through
'the eyes of our bodies, we should see this very immediate
region of air which we breathe in, thronged with spirits
now invisible, and which otherwise would be the most ter-
rible; we should view the secret transactions of those mes-
.sengers who are employed when the parting soul takes its
leave ofthe reluctant body, and perhaps see things Nature
would shrink back from with the utmost terror and amaze--
ment. In a word, the :Curtain of Providence. for the dis;
. 'position of things here,.and the curtain ofjudgment for the
determination of the state of souls hereafter, would he alike
- drawn back; and what lit-art could support here its future'
State in life; much less that ol'its future state after life,
even g'ood or bad. ' _ .

A g ntleman ofmy acquaintance, being about seven miles
distant from London, a friend that came to dine with him,
solicited .him to go to the city. " What," said the gentle-
.man, " is there any occasion for me E" " No, Sir," said the
other, "nothing at all, except the enjoy'nwnt of your good
company :"' and so gave over importuning him. Just then
a strnng impulse of mind urged the gentleman, and pursued
him like a voice, with, " Go to London, Go to London?

O'Qfiiz'."* ~..Ltr=r. AND Ansz'ruses
."V'H-zHark ye,"'-"sayshe to his friend, " is all well at London?
ifiin'l Wanted there? Or, did you ask me to go with youon
"gen-y, particular account? Are all my i'amiiy well?" " Yes,
indeed, Sir," said he, "I perceived them all very hearty;
' find I: did not ask you to go to London upon any particular
account whatsoever,-except it was for the sakeot'yourgood
company."7 Again he put'cfl' his resolution : but still the '
impulse suggestc t. to him, "' Go to London ;" and at length
. he did so. \'i'i en he came there, he found a letter, and a
messenger had been there to seek him, and to tell him ofa
particular business, vs hich was at-tirst and last above a thou-
'tIa,nd pi unds to him, and which might inevitably have been
lost, had he not gone to London that night.

The obeying ot'seyeral hints, or St crct impulses, argues
great-wisdom. I knew a man that was under misfortunes,
being guilty of misdemeanors against the government;
when, absconding for {car of his ruin, all his friends advi-
sing him not to put himself-into the. hands of the law, one
morning as he awaked, he felt a ~strorg impulse darting in-
to his mind thus, " Write a letter to them ;" and this was

' rr-peated several times to his mind, and at last he answered
to it, as ifit had been at voice, " \Vhom shall I write to?"
Immediately it replied, " Write to'the Judge :" and this
impulse pursued him for several days, tilt at icngth'he took
pen, ink, and paper, and sat down to write to him : when
immediately words flowed from his'pen like streams from
a. fair fountain,- that charmed even himseif with hopes of
success. In short, the letter was so strenuous in argument, '
so pathetic in its eloquence, and so persuasively moving,
that when thejudge had read it, he sent him an answer, he .
might be easy, he would endeavour to make that matter
light to him : and, indeed, never left exerting himself till
he had stopt the prosecution, and restored him to his liberty
and family. -

While I am mentioning these things, methinks it is very
hard that we should obey the whispers of evii Spirits, .und
not much rather receive the notices which good ones are
pleased to give. We never perceive thezmist'ortune of this,
but when in real danger; and then we cry, " My mind mis-
gave me when l was going about it :" but ifso, why do you
slight the caution? Why not listen to itas ton voice? and

. then there had been no reason to make thiscomplaint.man in the city of Dublin, to ' whodneamed-gapyh , e: a"

he rose, andlknocked at his mother's chamber, toldl'hi'sn '
concern, and his apprehensions that all was not right at his
relation's house. " Dear Son," says the good old gentle-
woman," do not mind these foolish dreams;: and I very '
,m_uch wonder, that you, being a pierson'i'n holy Orders, should
have regard to such illusions."_ Upon this'hewent to bed
again, tell asleep, andldreamed a fourth time as before-<<.-
And then indeed he put on. his night-gown, and went to
Smithfield, the place where his relation dwelt. Here it
'was, alas 3- he perceived his dream too sadly ft'ijtilled, by
seeing his relation, the young lady, big with child, who was
a protestant, stabbed in several places by her barbarous
- husband, Mr. Eustace, a violent Papist, only for some dis-
courses of religibn that happened the day before. After
the wretch had stabbed her in three places, he went to"
make his escape out at a window; but she cried out,
" My dear ! don't leave me, comeback and [shall be well '
again." At' which he returned in a hellish rage, and gave
her four wounds more; when even in this cundition, rising
from her lied, she wrapped herself in her night gown, and _
went to the Lord Bishop of Rapho'schamber door, (the
'Bishop lodgin'g'at that timein the trouse,) " My Lord," said
she, a" O my Lord, make haste unto me i" but as soon as- .
his Lordship came, she cstpired'in his arms, resigning her ' ,
precious soul into the hands of Almighty God. The cruel. -
wretch, her husband, was shot by the p'ursuersgtoo cod 3" ,
death for one who d =rved the gibbet: and the la' y was "
universally lamented )y all tender and religious people.
And this tragical relation I have mentioned, uponrtheac- '

at the fatal time of the bloody action. ' ' ' -
