TThb Wd and safpriang Adventures of Robinson Crusoe is one of the books 
^hicb seem to be written finr all tuna lake Shakspoe, Pilgrim's Pn^gress, and, 
if we may ventoie on the comparison, Holj Scripture^ it never gets old, but is 
ever fiesh and ncy ; the sfyle is plain and homely, bat beantifol and generally 
dear— paingiaph alter paragraph ocean in whidi no word exceeds two syllables— 
and though delightful to all dasses, it addranes itself especially to those with the 
simplest comprehension. The minuteness of detail, the kaf-painting, so to speak, 
with which the hero's occupations are described, his odd reflections and quaint 
moralizing, but espedaUy the characteristic eneigy with which he sets about 
lepairing the several disasters he meets with ; and the ain^lidty, not witfaoot 
a little unconscious totvado, with whidi he shouMera his two guns and giids on his 
old Aip^s cutlass ; and the ingenuity, not unmixed with simplicity, with which he 
sets about the construction of his boat, jsod afterwards of his battery of dd ship's 
muskets, when he discovers the vidts of the cannibals to his island ; his attach- 
ment to his goats and his paisot, and above all to Friday, are all so many 
justifications of the &Tour he findis witk seafaring men and boys, and with the 
illiterate classes generally. 

The reader's attention is fixed by anaittess chain of inddents natural under the 
supposed dromnertances, and told in a concise manner without embellishment^ but 
deriving interest firom the mode of telling the story ; ''under the guidance of natural 
leason,^ to me the words of liarmontel, 'Mt points to the Almighty as the source 
of man's o^alnlities;'' or as Sir Walter Scott has it in the Ballantyne Edition, 
*' The ways of Providence are simply and pleasantly vindicated, and a Listing and 
oseftd nu»al oonvcyed through the channel of an interesting and ddightful story." 

While no doubts exist about the literary parentage of the book— fi)r Defoe was 
the acknowledged author— it will ever remain a mystery whether it isa pure fiction 



iv Preface. 

founded on the general idea of Selkirk's stoiy^ or the resnlt of a more minute 
knowledge of his adventures in ail their details. His own preface, in which he 
assumes to he merely the Editor of the work, prohably originated this later notion ; 
it is very characteristic : " If ever the stoiy of any private man's adventures in the 
world were worth making public, the Editor of this work thinks that it will be so. 
The wonders of his life exceed ail that he thinks are to be found extant ; the life 
of one man being scarce capable of greater variety. The stoiy is told with 
modesty, with seriousness, and with religious application of events to the uses to 
which wise men always apply tken^ viz. to the instruction of others by example, 
and to justify and honour the wisdom of Providence in all the variety of their 
cucumstances, let them happen how they wilL The Editor believes the thing to 
be a just history of fitcts^ neither is there any appearance of fiction in ii However 
this may be, for ail such things may be disputed, he is of opinion that the improve- 
ment of it, as well to the diversion as the instruction of the reader, will be the 
same \ and as such, he thinks, without further compliment to the world, he does 
them a great service in the publication." 

Such was the slight veil with which Defoe himself sought to conceal the author- 
ship of the work. In the prefoce to his *' Serious Reflections on the Life and Adven- 
tures" which he published subsequently, he says that the story, though allegorical, 
was also historical ; and after recounting a number of particulars which he teUs us 
had a real foundation in lustoiy, he continues : ^ The adventures of Robinson Crusoe 
.are one whole scene of a real life of eight and twenty years, spent in the most 
wandering, desolate, and afflicting circumstances that ever a man went through * 
and in which I have lived so long a life of wonders, in continual storms, fought 
with the worst kind of savages and man-eaters, by unaccountably surprising 
accidents, fed by miracles greater than that of the ravens, suffered all manner of 
violences and oppressions, iojurious reproaches, contempt of men, attacks of devils, ' 
corrections from heaven, and oppositions on earth, have had innumerable ups and 
downs in matters of fortune, been in worse than Turkish slavery, and escaped by 
exquisite management, as in the story of Mully and the boat at Sallee, been taken 
up at sea in distress, raised again, and again depressed, and that oftener perhaps 
than ever was known before in one man's life ; shipwrecked often, though more on 
land than by sea ; in a word, there's not a circumstance in the imaginary story, but 
has its just allusion to a real stoiy, and chimes in fiEu;t for &ct, and step for step, 
with the inimitable life of Robinson Crusoe." 

Here the Author seems almost to drop the veil and avow the fictitious character 
of the work, and in domg so he seems also to identify himself with the adventurer, 
speaking in the first person in part of the paragraph. The truth probably is, that 
the adventures of Alexander Selkkk, which had been making considerable noise 
in the literary drdes for some years previous to the appearance of Robinson 
Crusoe, had made a strong impression on Defoe. As a literary man, he could 



Brefitce. If 

hardly ftToid picking up ail that was known of Selkirk 8 adventureB, perhaps 
talked with him. Other stories of maritime adTentore were floating about ; and 
oat of these materials his was the genius especially qualified to construct the story 
as it has reached us. Defoe's own career was peculiar. His &ther a small London 
tradesman, he himself was brought up to trade, and he entered into business as 
a hosier, in which he Med. He afterwards turned to literature, and became the 
great pamphleteer of his day— politics and other controTersial polemics being his 
fitvourite subjects. Twice he suffered imprisonment, which probably subdued 
his fenrour for political writing, for after his second imprisonment we find him 
taming his attention to subjects strictly literary. He wrote the History of 
the Plague, which is distinguished by the same matter-of-fiEu;t attention to detail 
which distmguishes Robinson Crusoe. He afterwards produced five or six novels 
of very considerable merit ; but probably his name would not have survived his 
own epoch but for this remarkable tale. 

Alexander Selkirk, or Seleraig as he is sometimes called, a native of Laigo, 
a fishing town on the coast of Fife, was bom in 1676. A spoilt child, and a moody 
and wayward man, he left home about 1695 and was absent five or six yean, 
having, it is said, been buccaneering in the Spanish Main. He was again home in 
1701, and shortly after we find him engaging with Captain Dampier for another 
cruise, in the course of which the uninhabited island of Juan Fernandez was 
visited by the ships of the expedition to refit. Here a violent quarrel seems to 
have taken place betwe^ Selkirk and his immediate commanding officer Stradling. 
The ships return to the island after a short absence, and Selkirk determines to leave 
tiiem thare rather than remain under the command of Stradling— bidding adieu to 
his comrades, in September, 1704. Here he remained four years and four months, 
when the ship Duke, Captain Rogers, happened to call at the island and released 
him from his voluntary exile in February, 1709. He sailed in the Duke during 
a long and fsitiguing cruise, giving great satisflEk^on to his captain ; and, in 1711, 
the ship letumed to England ; Selkirk having in the meantime realized £800 
in wages and prize-mon^« His story created a great sensaticm. Captain Rogers 
published one account of his adventores on the island, and there would appear to 
have been ten others issued. Sir Richard Steele visited him, and gives a short 
narrative of his conversation with Selkirk, which reads not very unlike a chapter 
of Robinson Crusoe. ^* It was tasAt&t of great curiosity," writes Sir Richard, ^' to 
hear him, as he is a man of good sense, give an account of the different revolutions 
in his mind in that long solitude. He was put ashore tmm a leaky vessel, with 
the captain of which he had an irreconcilable quarrel ; his portion was a searchest, 
his wearing clothes and bedding, a firelock, a pound of gunpowder, a parcel of 
bullets, a flint and ^eel, a few pounds of tobacco, a hatchet, a knife, a kettle, 
a Bible, and a few other books of devotion, with some others concerning hia 
iii8tEament&'' 



Of the tue Befoe made of these materials we gatJier firom the Editor of a 
modem edition of the woik, '^That bat fi» Defoe this man's nairatiye would 
not haTe outlived his own day. Robinson Crusoe,'* he oontinues, ''is a most 
skilful lomanoe, of which the first idea indeed may be borrowed tcom this strange 
story ; but the inddents, reflections^ and chaiaeters, as well as the arrangement 
and execution, aie truly and entirely Defoe's ; and the same sort of critidsm that 
would detract from the merit of its Author, would affect all the most celebrated 
epic, and almost all the dramatic, poems in the world. He took no more of 
Robinson Crusoe from Selkirk's story than Shakspere did of Macbeth and Hamlet 
ftmn Scotch and Danish chronicles, or of Romeo and Juliet from the Italian 
ballad." 

And sadly no doubt, would have been the vcfdict of his cont^nporaries ; but as 
a political and controversal writer Defi)e had numerous and bitter enemies. His 
work, therefore, was assailed with envenomed and bittor satire, but no attack was 
made impugning his integrity so long as he lived to repd it ; after his death, how- 
ever, it was boldly asserted that he had possessed himself of Selkirk's papers, and 
surxeptitiously applied th^n to his own use. This assertion has been snffidently 
disproved, but not until the calumny had been established in some respectable 
diannels. It is now, however, pretty well understood that the romance is entirely 
Defoe^s, based on the slight fsibric furnished by Selkirk's story. 

Robinson Crusoe was published in April, 1719; the ''Further Adventures" 
being published four months later, and it has the credit, in common with some of 
the most popular books in our language, of having been in the hands of every 
leading publisher before one was found willing to incur the cost of printing it At 
length Mr. Taylor was fortunate enough to undertake its publication. The success 
was wonderful ; in four months it had reached its fifth edition ; nearly eveiy 
printing office in London was employed in produdng it, and the publisher is said 
to have cleared igl,000 by it the first year. This great success produced a second 
part, of which it is only necessary to say that, like most continuations, the Author's 
reputation and the character of the book would have been benefited had it never 
appeared ; but having made its appearance, no edition of the work can now be 
considered complete without it Attempts were also made to invade the Author's 
and Publisher's rights by abridgment, which called forth bitter complaints from 
both, and legal im)ceedings against the publishers of the abridgment 

Of its merits, the most eminent critics of all nations express the highest opinion. 
Dr. Johnson, in conversation with Mrs. Thrale, says: "Was there ever anything 
written by mere man that the reader wished to be Icmger excepting Don Quixote, 
Rolnnaon Crusoe, and Pilgrim's Progress?" Blair says,— "Ko fiction in any 
language was ever better supported; while it is carried on with tiiat appeazanoe 
of truth and simplidty which takes a strong hold on the imagination, it suggests 
at the same time very osefii] instruction, by showing how much the native poweni

Mannontel says, Robinson Crusoe was the first book he read with exquisite 
I^eassie, and he believes that every boy in Europe may aay the aame thing: 
While youth and ignorance have alike found scope for entertainment in the inci- 
dents told with the simplicity and the similitude of real life, it has commended 
itself to the more enlightened as one of those rare efforts of genius which plaeea 
its Author in the first rank among writers of invention. As a narrative replete 
with incident, it stands unrivalled for its natural and easy transitions ; its whole 
machinery being strictly subservient to the main object of the stoiy. Crusoe ia 
strictly a child of nature, assisted by circumstances that rise naturally out of 
the peculiar events by which he is surrounded ; there is an air of plausibility, or 
rather reality, in all particulars of his stoiy even to the minutest, so that the 
reader reluctantly admits any part <rf the book to be fiction. 

''Since we must have books," writes Rousseau, "this is one which, in my opinion, 
is a most excellent treatise on natural education. This is the first my Emilius . 
shall read, his whole library shall consist of this only ; it shall be the text on which 
all our conversations on natural science are to serve only as conmients ; it shall 
guide us in our progress to maturity of judgment, and so long as our taste is un- 
sophisticated, the perusal of this book shall afford us pleasure." 

More subdued in his commendations than the philosopher of Geneva, Dr. Beattie 
says, — " The work must be allowed by the rigid moralist to be one of those novels 
which one may read not only with pleasure, but profit. It breathes throughout 
a spirit of piety and benevolence, and sets in a very striking light the importance 
of the mechanic arts ; it fixes in the mind a lively idea of the horrors of solitude, 
and of the sweets of social life, and of the blessings we derive from conversation 
and mutual aid ; and it shows how by labouring with one's hand one may secure 
independence, and open for oneself many sources of health and contentment. I 
agree therefore with Rousseau, that this is one of the best books that can be put 
into the hands of children." 

Innumerable have been the imitations of Robinson Crusoe in our own and 
other languages ; it is almost the only English book which has been translated 
into the Portuguese language. It has been translated into French, J)utch, German, 
Russian^ Greek and Latin^ and the enterprising traveller, John Lewis Burckhardt, 



yfii Preface. 

wrote the tale in Arabic, much to the delight of the children of the desert who 
heard it. The idea was imitated by Philip Quarl, an Englishman, who professes 
to have spent fifty years of his life in similar solitude on an island of the Pacific, 
like Robinson, 

Monaxdi of all he sorv^ed. 

Monsieur de Gampe, taking some hints from the book, produced a nometM 
Robinson Crusoe— a meagre imitation of the original Probably the most suc- 
cessful of these imitative efforts, however, is the Swiss Robinson Crusoe, the only 
one of them which has a place in the literary marts in our day. 

With respect to the present Edition, its chief recommendation will be Mr. 
Wehnert's numerous illustrations, and its beautiful typography. But some care 
has also been bestowed upon the text. It has been reprinted from the best of the 
old editions, and every effort has been made to correct such errors as had crept 
into it from the imperfect typography of the period. 




THE LIFE AND AD^T,1^:UEES 



KOBINSON CRUSOE. 




WAS bom in the year 1632, in the city of York, of a good 
family, though not of that country, my father being a 
foreigner of Bremen, who settled first at Hull : he got 
a good estate by merchandise, and leaving off his trade, 
lived afterward at York ; from whence he had married 
my mother, whose relations were named Robinson, a 
very good family in that country, * and from whom I was called 
Robinson Elreutznaer ; but by the usual corruption of words in Eng- 
land, we are now called, nay, we call ourselves, and write our name 
Crusoe ; and so my companions always called me. 

I had two elder brothers, one of whom was lieutenant-colonel to an 
English regiment of Eoot in Elanders, formerly commanded by the 
famous Colonel Lockhart, and was killed at the battle near Dunkirk 
against the Spaniards. What became of my second brother I never 
knew, any more than my father or mother knew what became of me. 
Being the third son of the family, and not bred to any trade, my head 
began to be filled very early with rambling thoughts. My father, who 



2 The Life and Adventures 

was very ancient, had given me a competent share of learning, as far as 
house education and a country free school generally goes, and designed 
me for the law; but I would be satisfied with nothing but going to sea; 
and my inclination to this led me so strongly against the will, nay, the 
commands of my father, and against all the entreaties and persuasions 
of my mother and other friends, that there seemed to be something fatal 
in that propension of nature tending directly to the life of misery 
which was to befal me. 

My father, a wise and grave man, gave me serious and excellent 
counsel against what he foresaw was my design. He called me one 
morning into his chamber, where he was confined by the gout, and 
expostulated very warmly with me upon this subject : he asked me 
what reasons, more than a mere wandering inclination, I had for leaving 
my father's house and my native country, where I might be well intro- 
duced, and had a prospect of raising my fortune by application and 
industry, with a life of ease and pleasure. He told me it was for men 
of desperate fortunes on one hand, or of aspiring superior fortunes on 
the other, who went abroad upon adventures, to rise by enterprise, 
and make themselves famous in undertakings of a nature out of the 
common road ; that these things were all either too far above me, or 
too far below me ; that mine was the middle state, or what might be 
called the upper station of low life, which he had found by long 
experience was the best state in the world, the most suited to human 
happiness, not exposed to the miseries and hardships, the labour and 
sufferings of the mechanic part of mankind, and not embarrassed with 
the pride, luxury, ambition, and envy of the upper part of mankind. 
He told me, I might judge of the happiness of this state, by this one 
thing, namely, that this was the state of life which all other people 
envied; that kings hav3 frequently lamented the miserable con- 
sequences of being born to great things, and wish they had been 
placed in the middle of the two extremes, between the mean and the 
great; that the wise man gave his testimony to this, as the just 
standard of true felicity, when he prayed to have neither poverty 
nor riches. 

He bade me observe it, and I should always find, that the calamities 
of life were shared among the upper and lower part of mankind ; but 
that the middle station had the fewest disasters, and was not exposed 
to so many vicissitudes as the higher or lower part of mankind ; nay, 
they were not subjected to so many distempers and uneasinesses either 
of body or mind, as those were who, by vicious living, luxury, and ex- 
travagancies on one hand, or by hard labour, want of necessaries, and

mean or insafficient diet on the other hand, bring distempers upon 
themselves by the natural consequences of their way of living ; that 
the middle station of life was calculated for all kind of virtues and all 
kind of enjoyments ; that peace and plenty were the handmaids of a 
middle fortune ; that temperance, moderation, quietness, health, society, 
aU agreeable diversions, and all desirable pleasures, were the blessings 
attending the middle station of life ; that this way men went silently 
and smoothly through the world, and comfortably out of it, not em- 
barrassed with the labours of the hands or of the head, not sold 
to the life of slavery for daily bread, or harassed with perplexed 
circumstances, which rob the soul of peace, and the body of rest ; not 
enraged with the passion of envy, or secret burning lust of ambition for 
great things; but in easy circumstances sliding gently through the 
world, and sensibly tasting the sweets of living without the bitter, 
feeling that they are happy, and learning by every day's experience to 
know it more sensibly. 

After this, he pressed me earnestly, and in the most affectionate 
manner, not to play the young man, not to precipitate myself into 
miseries which nature and the station of life I was bom in seemed to 
have provided against ; that I was under no necessity of seeking my 
bread ; that he would do well for me, and endeavour to enter me fedrly 
into the station of life which he had been just recommending to me ; 
and that if I was not very easy and happy in the world, it must be my 
mere fate or &ult that must hinder it, and that he should have nothing 
to answer for, having thus discharged his duty in warning me against 
measures which he knew would be to my hurt ; in a word, that as he 
would do very kind things for me if I would stay and settle at home as 
he directed, so he would not have so much hand in my misfortunes, as 
to give me any encouragement to go away ; and to close all, he told me 
I had my elder brother for an example, to whom he had used the 
same earnest persuasions to keep him from going into the Low Country 
wars, but could not prevail, his young desires prompting him to run * 
into the army, where he was killed ; and though he said he would not 
cease to pray for me, yet he would venture to say to me, that if I did 
take this foolish step, God would not bless me, and I would have 
leisure hereafter to reflect upon having neglected his counsel when there 
might be none to assist in my recovery. 

I observed in this last part of his discourse, — which was truly 
prophetic, though I suppose my father did not know it to be so him- 
aelf, — I say, I observed the tears run down his face very plentifully, and 
especially when he spoke of my brother who was killed ; and that when 

b2 



4 The Life and Adventures 

he spoke of my haying leisure to repent, and none to assist me, he was 
so moved, that he broke off the discourse, and told me, his heart was 
so full, he could say no more to me. 

I was sincerely affected with this discourse, as, indeed, who could be 
otherwise, and I resolved not to think of going abroad any more, but 
to settle at home according to my father's desire. But, alas ! a few days 
wore it all off; and, in short, to prevent any of my father's further im- 
portunities, in a few weeks after I resolved to run quite away from him. 
However, I did not act so hastily neither, as my first heat of resolution 
prompted, but I took my mother, at a time when I thought her a little 
pleasanter than ordinary, and told her that my thoughts were so entirely 
bent upon seeing the world, that I should never settle to anything 
with resolution enough to go through with it, and my father had better 
give me his consent than force me to go without it ; that I was now 
eighteen years old, which was too late to go apprentice to a trade, or clerk 
to an attorney ; that I was sure, if I did, I should never serve out my 
time, and I should certainly run away from my master before my time 
was out, and go to sea ; and if she would speak to my father to let me 
go but one voyage abroad, if I came home again and did not like it, I 
would go no more, and I would promise by a double diligence to recover 
that time I had lost 

This put my mother into a great passion : she told me, she knew 
it would be to no purpose to speak to my father upon any. such 
subject ; that he knew too well what was my interest to give his 
consent to anything so much for my hurt, and that she wondered 
how I could think of any such thing after such a discourse as I 
had had from my father, and such kind and tender expressions as she 
knew my father had used to me, and that, in short, if I would 
ruin myself, there was no help for me ; but I might depend I should 
never have their consent to it ; that for her part she would not have 
so much hand in my destruction ; and I should never have it to say, 
that my mother was willing when my father was not. 
* Though my mother refused to move it to my father, yet, as I 
heard afterwards, she reported all the discourse to him, and that my 
father, after sho^dng a great concern at it, said to her, with a sigh, 
" That boy might be happy if he would stay at home, but if he goes 
abroad, he will be the most miserable wretch that was ever born ; I 
can give no consent to it." 

It was not till almost a year after this that I broke loose, though in 
the mean time I continued obstinately deaf to all proposals of settling 
to business, and frequently expostulating with my father and mother 



of Robinson Crusoe, 5 

about their being so positively determined against what they knew 
my inclinations prompted me to. But being one day at Hull, where 
I went casually, and without any purpose of making an elopement 
that time — ^but I say, being there, and one of my companions being 
about to sail to London, in his father's ship, and prompting me to go 
with them, with the common allurement of seafaring men, namely, 
that it should cost me nothing for my passage, I consulUjd neither 
father nor mother any more, nor so much as sent them word of it ; 
but leaving them to hear of it as they might, without asking God's 
blessing, or my father's, without any consideration of circumstances 
or consequences, and in an ill hour — God knows — on the first of 
September. 1651, I went on board a ship bound for LondoiL Never 




any young adventurer's misfortunes, I believe, began sooner, or 
continued longer than mine. The ship was no sooner gotten out of 
the Humber, but the wind began to blow, and the waves to rise in a 
most frightful manner ; and as I had never been at sea before, I was 
most inexpressibly sick in body, and terrified in mind, I began now 
seriously to reflect upon what I had done, and how justly I was 
overtaken by the judgment of Heaven for my wicked leaving my 
father's house, and abandoning my duty ; all the good counsel of my 
parents, my father's tears and my mother's entreaties, came now fresh 
into my mind, and my conscience, which was not yet come to the 
pitch of hardness to which it has been since, reproached me with the 
contempt of advice, and the breach of my duty to God and my 
father. 



6 The Life and Adventures 

All this while the storm increased, and the sea, which I had never 
been upon before, went very high, though nothing like what I have 
seen many times since ; no, nor like what I saw a few days after : 
but it was enough to affect me then, who was but a young sailor, and 
had never known anything of the matter. I expected every wave 
would have swallowed us up, and that every time the ship fell down, 
as I thought, in the trough or hollow of the sea, we should never rise 
more ; and in this agony of mind I made many vows and resolutions, 
that if it would please God here to spare my life this one voyage, if 
ever I got once my foot upon dry land again I would go directly home 
to my father, and never set it into a ship again while I lived ; that I 
would take his advice and never run myself into such miserieiS as these 
any more. Now I saw plainly the goodness of his observations about 
the middle station of life, how easy, how comfortably he had lived 
all his days, and never had been exposed to tempests at sea, or troubles 
on shore ; and I resolved that I would, like a true repenting prodigal, 
go home to my father. 

These wise and sober thoughts continued all the while the storm 
continued, and indeed some time after ; but the next day the wind 
was abated and the sea calmer, and I began to be a little inured to it : 
however, I was veiy grave for all that day, being also a little sea-sick 
still ; but towards night the weather cleared up, the wind was quite 
over, and a charming fine evening followed ; the sun went down 
perfectly clear, and rose so the next morning ; and having little or no 
wind, and a smooth sea, the sun shining upon it, the sight was, as 
I thought, the most dehghtful that ever I saw. 

I had slept well in the night, and was now no more sea-sick, but 
very cheerful, looking with wonder upon the sea that was so rough 
and terrible the day before, and could be so calm and so pleasant in so 
little time after. And now, lest my good resolutions should continue, 
my companion, who had indeed enticed me away, comes to me. " Well, 
Bob," says he, (clapping me upon the shoulder,) "how do you do 
after it ? I warrant you were frighted, wan't you, last night, when 
it blew but a cap full of wind ] " "A cap full do you call it ] " said I. 
*' It was a terrible storm." " A storm, you fool you," replies he, " do 
you call that a storm ? why it was nothing at all ; give us but a good 
ship and sea-room, and we think nothing of such a squall of wind as 
that ; but you're but a fresh-water sailor, Bob : come, let us make a 
bowl of punch, and we'll forget all that. Do you see what charming 
weather it is now 1 " To make short this sad part of my story, we 
went the old way of all sailors ; the punch was made^ and I was made 



of Robinson Grusoe. 7 

drunk with it, and in that one night's wickedness I drowned all my 
repentance, all my reflections upon my past conduct, and all my 
resolutions for my future. In a word, as the sea was returned to its 
smoothness of surface and settled calnmess by the abatement of that 
stonn, so the hurry of my thoughts being over, my fears and appre- 
hensions of being swallowed up by the sea being forgotten, and the 
current of my former desires returned, I entirely forgot the vows and 
promises that I made in my distress. I found indeed some intervals 
of reflection, and the serious thoughts did, as it were, endeavour to 
return again sometimes ; but I shook them off, and roused myself 
from them as it were from a distemper, and appl^-ing myself to drink 
and company, soon mastered the return of those fits, for so I called 
them, and I had in five or six days got as complete a victory over 
conscience as any young fellow that resolved not to be troubled with 
it could desire. But I was to have another trial for it still ; and 
Providence, as in such cases generally it does, resolved to leave me 
entirely without excuse. For if I would not take this for a deliverance, 
the next was to be such a one as the worst and most hardened wietch 
among us would confess both the danger and the mercy. 

The sixth day of our being at sea we came into Yarmouth Roads ; 
the wind having been contrary, and the weather calm, we had made 
but little way since the storm. Here we were obhged to come to an 
anchor, and here we lay, the wind continuing contrary, namely, at 
south-west, for seven or eight days, during which time a great many 
ships from Newcastle came into the same roads, as the common 
harbour where the ships might wait for a wind for the river. 

We had not^ however, rid here so long, but should have tided it up 
the river, but that the wind blew too fresh, and after we had lain four 
or ^\e days blew very hard. However, the roads being reckoned as 
good as a harbour, the anchorage good, and our ground tackle very 
strong, our men were unconcerned, and not in the least apprehensive 
of danger, but spent the time in rest and mirth, after the manner of the 
sea ; but the eighth day in the morning, the wind increased, and we had 
all hands at work to strike our top-masts, and make everything snug 
and close, that the ship might ride as easy as possible. By noon the 
sea went very high indeed, and our ship rid forecastle in, shipped several 
seas, and we thought once or twice our anchor had come home ; upon 
which our master ordered out the sheet anchor, so that we rode with 
two anchors a-head, and the cables veered out to the better end. 

By this time it blew a terrible storm indeed; and now I began to see- 
terror and amazement in the faces even of the seamen themselves. The

master, thougli vigilant in the business of preserving the ship, yet as 
he went in and out of his cabin by me, I could hear him softly to 
himself say several times, Lord, be merciful to us ; we shall be all lost, 
we shall be all undone, and the like. During these first hurries, I was 
stupid, lying still in my cabin, which was in the steerage, and cannot 
describe my temper. I could ill reassume the first penitence which 
I had so apparently trampled upon, and hardened myseK against: I 
thought the bitterness of death had been past, and that this would be 
nothing like the first. But when the master himself came by me, as I 
said just now, and said we should be all lost, I was dreadfully frighted ; 
I got up out of my cabin, and looked out; but such a dismal sight I 
never saw : the sea went mountains high, and broke upon us every three 
or four minutes : when I could look about, I could see nothing but 
distress round us : two ships that rid near us, we found, had cut their 




masts by the board, being deep loaden ; and our men cried out, that a 
ship which rid about a mile a-head of us was foundered. Two more 
ships being driven from their anchors, were run out of the roads to sea 
at all adventures, and that with not a mast standing. The light ships 
fared the best, as not so much labouring in the sea ; but two or three 
of them drove, and came close by us, running away with only their 
spritsail out before the wind. 

Towards evening the mate and boatswain begged the master of our 
ship to let them cut away the fore-mast, which he was very unwilling 
to do ; but the boatswain protesting to him, that if he did not, the ship 
would founder, he consented ; and when they had cut away the fore- 




CRUSOE SWOOWrNO AWAY 



of Bobitison Crusoe. 9 

mast, the main- mast stood so loose, and shook the ship so much, they 
were obliged to cut her away also, and make a clear deck. 

Any one may judge what a condition I must be in at all this, who 
was but a young sailor, and who had been in such a fright before at 
but a little. But if I can express at this distance the thoughts I had 
about me at that time, I was in tenfold more horror of mind upon 
account of my former convictions, and the having returned from them 
to the resolutions I had wickedly taken at first, than I was at death 
itself ; and these, added to the terror of the storm, put me into such a 
condition, that I can by no words describe it. But the worst was not 
come yet ; the storm continued with such fur}', that the seamen them- 
selves acknowledged they had never known a worse. We had a good 
ship, but she was deep loaden, and wallowed in the sea, that the seamen 
every now and then cried out she would founder. It was my advantage 
in one respect, that I did not know what they meant by founder, till 
I inquired. However, the storm was so violent, that I saw what is 
not ofiien seen, the master, the boatswain, and some others more sensible 
than the rest at their prayers, and expecting ever}' moment when the 
ship would go to the bottom. In the middle of the night, and under 
all the rest of our distresses, one of the men that had been down on 
purpose to see, cried out, we had sprung a leak ; another said there 
was four foot water in the hold. Then all hands were called to the 
pump. At that very word my heart, as I thought, died within me, and 
I fell backwards upon the side of my bed wliere I sat, into the cabin. 
However, the men roused me, and told me, that I who was able to do 
nothing before, was as well able to pump as another : at which I stirred 
up, and went to the pump and worked very heartily. While this was 
doing, the master seeing some light colliers, who, not able to ride out 
the storm, were obliged to slip and nm away to sea, and would not come 
near us, ordered to j&re a gun as a signal of distress. I, who knew nothing 
what that meant, was so surprised, that I thought the ship had broke, 
or some dreadful thing happened. In a word I was so surprised, that 
I fell down in a swoon. As this was a time when everybody had his 
own life to think of, nobody minded me, or what was become of me ; 
but another man stepped up to the pump, and thrusting me aside with 
his foot, let me lie, thinking I had been dead, and it was a great while 
before I came to myself. 

We worked on, but the water increasing in the hold, it was appa- 
rent that the ship would founder; and though the storm began to 
abate a little, yet as it was not possible she could swim till we might 
run into a port, so the master continued firing guns for help ; and a 



10 The Life and Adventures 

light ship who had rid it out just a-head of us, ventured a boat out to 
help us. It was with the utmost hazard the boat came near us, but it 
was impossible for us to get on board, or for the boat to lie near the 
ship's side ; till at last, the men rowing very heartily, and venturing 
their lives to save ours, our men cast them a rope over the stem with 
the buoy to it, and then veered it out a great length, which they, after 
great labour and hazard, took hold of, and we hauled them close under 
our stem and got all into their boat. It was to no purpose for them 
or us after we were in the boat to think of reaching to their own ship, 
so all agreed to let her drive, and only to pull her in towards shore as 
much as we could, and our master promised them, that if the boat was 
staved upon shore he would make it good to their master ; so partly 
rowing and partly driving, our boat went away to the northward, 
sloping towards the shore almost as far as Winterton-Ness. 

We were not much more than a quarter of an hour out of our ship 
before we saw her sink, and then I understood for the first time what 
was meant by a ship foundering in the sea. I must acknowledge I had 
hardly eyes to look up when the seamen told me she was sinking ; for 
from that moment they rather put me into the boat than that I might 
be said to go in : my heart was as it were dead within me, partly with 
fright, partly with horror of mind, and the thoughts of what was yet 
before me. 

While we were in this condition, the men yet labouring at the oars 
to bring the boat near the shore, we could see (when our boat 
mounting the waves we were able to see the shore) a great many people 
running along the shore to assist us when we should come near ; but 
we made but slow way towards the shore, nor were we able to reach 
the shore, till being past the light-house at Winterton, the shore falls 
off to the westward towards Cromer, and so the land broke off a little 
the violence of the wind : here we got in, and, though not without 
much difficulty, got all safe on shore, and walked afterwards on foot 
to Yarmouth, where, as imfortunate men, we were used with great 
humanity, as well by the magistrates of the town, who assigned us 
good quarters, as by particular merchants and owners of ships, and had 
money given us sufficient to carry us either to London or back to 
Hull, as we thought fit. 

Had I now had the sense to have gone back to Hull, and have gone 
home, I had been liappy, and my father, an emblem of our blessed 
Saviour's parable, had even killed the fatted calf for me ; for hearing 
the ship I went away in was cast away in Yarmouth Koad, it was a 
great while before he had any assurance that I was not drowned. 



of Bobinaon Crusoe. 11 

But my ill fate pushed me on now with ao obstinacy that nothing 
could lesist ; and though I had several times loud calls &om my reason 
and my more composed judgment to go home, yet I had no power to 
do it. I know not what to call this, nor will I urge that it is a secret 
overruling decree that hurries us on to be the instruments of our own 
destruction, even though it be before us, and that we rush upon it with 
our eyes open. Certainly nothing but some such decreed unavoidable 
misery attending, and which it was impossible for me to escape, could 
have pushed me forward against the calm reasonings and persuasions 
of my most retired thoughts, and against two such visible instructions 
as I had met with in my first attempt 

My comrade, who had helped to harden me before, and who was the 
master's son, was now less forward than L The first time he spoke to 
me after we were at Yarmouth, which was not till two or three days, 
for we were separated in the town to several quarters ; I say, the first 
time he saw me, it appeared his tone was altered ; and looking very 
melancholy, and shaking his head, asked me how I did, and telling his 
father who I was, and how I had come this voyage only for a trial, in 
order to go farther abroad ; his father, turning to me with a veiy grave 
and concerned tone, " Yoimg man," says he, "you ought never to go to sea 
any more ; you ought to take this for a plain and visible token that you 




are not to be a seafaring man." " Why, sir," said I, "will yon go to sea no 
more ?" "That is another case," said he, "it is my calling, and therefore 
my duty ; but as you made this voyage for a trial, you see what a tasto 
Heaven has given you of what you are to expect if you persist; perhaps 



12 The Life and Adventures 

this is all befallen us on your account, like Jonah, in the ship of Tarshish. 
Pray," continued he, "what are you ? and on what account did you go to 
sea % " Upon that I told him some of my story; at the end of which he 
burst out with a strange kind of passion : " What had I done," says he, 
"that such an unhappy wretch should come into my ship *? I would not 
set my foot in the same ship with thee again for a thousand pounds." 
However, he afterwards talked very gravely to me, exhorted me to go 
back to my father and not tempt Providence to my ruin ; told me I 
might see a visible hand of Heaven against me. " And, young man," 
said he, "depend upon it if you do not go back, wherever you go, you 
will meet with nothing but disasters and disappointments, till your 
father's words are fulfilled upon you." 

We parted soon after ; for I made him little answer, and I saw him 
no more ; which way he went, I know not As for me, having some 
money in my pocket, I travelled to London by land ; and there, as well 
as on the road, had many struggles with myself, what course of life I 
should take, and whether I should go home, or go to sea. 

As to going home, shame opposed the best motions that offered to 
my thoughts ; and it immediately occurred to me how I should be 
laughed at among the neighbours, and should be ashamed to see, not 
my father and mother only, but even everybody else ; from whence 
I have since often observed, how incongruous and irrational the 
common temper of mankind is, especially of youth, to that reason 
which ought to guide them in such cases, namely, that they are not 
ashamed to sin, and yet are ashamed to repent ; not ashamed of the 
action for which they ought jiistly to be esteemed fools, but are 
ashamed of the returning, which only can make them be esteemed 
wise men. 

In this state of life, however, I remained some time, uncertaiu what 
measures to take, and what course of life to lead. An irresistible 
reluctafice continued to going home ; and as I stayed a while, the 
remembrance of the distress I had been in wore off, and as that abated, 
the Httle motion I had in my desires to a return wore off with it, till 
at last I quite laid aside the thoughts of it, and looked out for a 
voyage. 

That evil influence which carried me first away from my father's 
house, that hurried me into the wild notion of raising my fortune, 
and that imprest those conceits so forcibly upon me, as to make me 
deaf to all good advice, and to the entreaties and even the conmiand of 
my father ; I say, the same influence, whatever it was, presented the 
most unfortunate of aU enterprises to my view ; and I went on board 



of Robtnsan Crusoe. 13 

a yessel bound to the coast of Africa, or, as our sailors Milgarlj call 
it^ a voyage to Guinea. 

It was my great misfortune that in all these adventures I did not 
ship myself as a sailor ; whereby, though I might indeed liave worked 
a little harder than ordinary, yet at the same time I had learned the 
duty and office of a fore-mast man and in time might have qualified 
myself for a mate or lieutenant, if not for a master. But as it 
was always my fate to choose for the worse, so I did here ; for having 
money in my pocket, and good clothes upon my back, I would always 
go on board in the habit of a gentleman, and so I neither had any 
business in the ship, nor learned to do any. 

It was my lot first of all to fall into pretty good company in London, 
which does not always happen to such loose and unguided yoimg 
fellows as I then was ; the devil generally not omitting to lay some snare 
for them very early : but it was not so with me. I first fell acquainted 
with the master of a ship who had been on the coast of Guinea, and 
who, having had very good success there, was resolved to go again ; and 
who, taking a fancy to my conversation, which was not at aU disagreeable 
at that time, hearing me say I had a mind to see the world, told me if 
I would go the voyage with him 1 should be at no expense ; I should 
be his messmate and his companion, and if I could carry anything 
with me, I should have aU the advantage of it that the trade would 
admit, and perhaps I might meet with some encouragement. 

I embraced the offer, and entering into a strict friendship with this 
captain, who was an honest and plaia-dealing man, I went the voyage 
with him, and carried a small adventure with me, which, by the dis- 
interested honesty of my friend the captaiQ, I increased very con- 
siderably ; for I carried about 40Z. in such toys and trifles as the 
captain directed me to buy. This 40Z. I had mustered together by the 
assistance of some of my relations whom I corresponded with, and 
who, I believe, got my father, or at least my mother, to contribute so 
much as that to my first adventure. 

This was the only voyage which I may say was successful in all my 
adventures, and which I owe to the integrity and honesty of my friend 
the captain, under whom also I got a competent knowledge of the 
mathematics, and the rules of navigation, learned how to keep an 
accoimt of the ship's course, take an observation, and, in short, to un- 
derstand some things that were needful to be understood by a sailor ; 
for, as he took delight to instruct me, I took delight to learn, and, in a 
word, this voyage made me both a sailor and a merchant ; for I brought 
home five pounds nine ounces of gold dust for my adventure, which 



14 The Life and Adventures 

yielded mo in London at my return, almost 300Z., and tliis filled me 
with those aspiring thoughts which have since so completed my ruin. 

Yet even in this voyage I had my misfortunes too ; particularly, that 
I was continually sick, being thrown into a violent fever by the ex- 
cessive heat of the cHniate; our principal trading- beiug upon the coast, 
from the latitude of fifteen degrees north even to the line itself. 

I was now set up for a Guinea trader j and my friend, to my great 
misfortune, dying soon after his arrival, I resolved to go the same 
voyage again, and I embarked in the same vessel with one who was his 
mate in the former voyage, and had now got the command of the ship. 
This was the unhappiest voyage that ever man made ; for though I did 
not carry quite 100^. of my new gained wealth, so that I had 200Z. 
left, and which I lodged with my friend's widow, who was very just to 
me, yet I fell into terrible misfortunes in this voyage ; and the first was 
this, namely : Our ship, making her course towards the Canary Islands, 
or rather between those islands and the African shore, was surprised in 
the grey of the morning by a Turkish rover of Sallee, who gave chase 
to us with all the sail she could make. We crowded also as much canvas 
as our yards would spread, or our masts carry, to have got clear ; but 
finding the pirate gained upon us, and would certainly come up with 
us in a few hours, we prepared to fight ; our ship having twelve guns, 




and the rogue eighteen. About three in the afternoon he came up 
with us, and bringing to, by mistake, just athwart our quarter, instead 
of athwart our stem, as he intended, we brought eight of our guns to 
bear on that side, and poured in a broadside upon him, which made him 
sheer off again, after returning our fire, and pouring in also his small 



of Robinson Crusoe. 15 

shot from near 200 men which he had on board. However, we had 
not a man touched, all our men keeping close. He prepared to attack 
ns again, and we to defend ourselves ; but laying us on board the next 
time upon our other quarter, he entered sixty men upon our decks, who 
immediately fell to cutting and hacking the decks and rigging. We 
plied them with small shot, half-pikes, powder-chests, and such like, 
and cleared our deck of them twice. However, to cut short this 
melancholy part of our story, our ship being disabled, and three of our 
men killed, and eight wounded, we were obliged to yield, and were 
carried all prisoners into Sallee, a port belonging to the Moors. 

The usage I had there was not so dreadful as at first I apprehended, nor 
was I carried up the country to the emperor's court, as the rest of our 
men were, but was kept by the captain of the rover as his proper prize, 
and made his slave, being young and nimble, and fit for his business. 
At this surprising change of my circumstances, from a merchant to a 
miserable slave, I was perfectly overwhelmed ; and now I looked back 
upon my fiEither's prophetic discourse to me, that I should be miserable, 
and have none to relieve me, which I thought was now so effectually 
brought to pass, that I could not be worse ; that now the hand of 
Heaven had overtaken me, and I was imdone without redemption. 
But, alas ! this was but a taste of the misery I was to go through, as 
will appear in the sequel of the story. 

As my new patron or master had taken me home to his house, so I 
vas in hopes that he would take me with him when he went to sea 
again, believing that it would some time or other be his fate to be 
taken by a Spanish or Portuguese man of war, and that then I should 
be set at liberty. But this hope of mine was soon taken away ; for 
when he went to sea, he left me on shore to look after his little garden, 
and do the common drudgery of slaves about his house ; and when 
he came home again from his cruise, he ordered me to lie in the cabin 
to look after the ship. 

Here I meditated nothing but my escape, and what method I might 
take to effect it, but foimd no way that had the least probability in it : 
nothing presented to make the supposition of it rational ; for I had 
nobody to communicate it to, that would embark with me ; no fellow- 
slave, no Englishman, Irishman, or Scotchman, there but myself ; so 
that for two years, though I often pleased myself with the imagination, 
yet I never had the least encouraging prospect of putting it in practice. 

After about two years an odd circumstance presented itself, which 
put the old thought of making some attempt for my liberty again in 
my head : my patron lying at home longer than usual, without fitting 



16 The Life and Adventures 

out Ids ship, whicli, as I heard, was for want of money, he used con- 
stantly, once or twice a week, sometimes oftener, if the weather was 
fair, to take the ship's pinnace, and go out into the road a fishing ; 
and as he always took me and a young Maresco with him to row the 
boat, we made him very merry, and I proved very dexterous in catching 
fish : insomuch, that sometimes he would send me with a Moor, one of 
his kinsmen, and the youth, the Maresco as they called him, to catch a 
dish of fish for him. 

It happened one time, that going a fishing in a stark calm morning, 
a fog rose so thick, that though we were not half a league from the 
shore, we lost sight of it ; and rowing we knew not whither or which 
way, we laboured all day, and all the next night, and when the morning 
came we found we had pulled off to sea instead of pulling in for the 
shore, and that we were at least two leagues from the shore ; however, 
we got well in again, though with a great deal of labour, and some 
danger ; for the wind began to blow pretty fresh in the morning, but 
particularly we were all very hungry. 

But our patron, warned by this disaster, resolved to take more care of 
himself for the future ; and having lying by him the long boat of our 
English ship he had taken, he resolved he would not go a fishing any 
more without a compass and some provision ; so he ordered the car- 
penter of his ship, who also was an English slave, to build a little 
state-room or cabin in the middle of the long boat, like that of a barge, 
with a place to stand behind it to steer and hale home the main-sheet , 
and room before for a hand or two to stand and work the sails. She 
sailed with what we call a shoulder of mutton sail ; and the boom 
gibed over the top of the cabin, which lay very snug and low, and had 
in it room for him to lie, with a slave or two, and a table to eat on, 
with some small lockers to put in some bottles of such liquor as he 
thought fit to drink, particularly his bread, rice and coffee. 

We went frequently out with this boat a fishing, and as I was most 
dexterous to catch fish for him, he never went without me. It hap- 
pened that he had appointed to go out in this boat, either for pleasure 
or for fish, with two or three Moors of some distinction in that place, 
and for whom he had provided extraordinarily ; and had therefore sent 
on board the boat over night a larger store of provisions than ordinary, 
and had ordered me to get ready three fusees with powder and shot, 
which were on board his ship, for that they designed some sport of 
fowling as well as fishing. 

I got all things ready as he directed, and waited the next morning 
with the boat washed clean, her flag and pendants out, and everything 



€f Robinson Crusoe, 17 

to aocommodate his gueets; when by-and-by my patron came on board 
alone, and ixAd me his guests had put off going, upon some biisiness 
that fell out, and ordered me with the man and boy, as usual, to go out 
with the boat and catch them some fish, for that his friends were to sup 
at his house ; and commanded that as soon as I got some fish I should 
bring it home to his house ; all which I prepared to do. 

This moment my former notions of deliverance darted into my 
thoughts, for now I found I was like to have a little ship at my com- 
mand ; and my master being gone, I prepared to furnish myself^ not 
for a fishing business, but for a voyage ; though I knew not, neither 
did I so much as consider, whither I should steer ; for anywhere to get 
out of that place was my way. 

My first contrivance was to make a pretence to speak to this Moor, 
to get something for our subsistence on board ; for I told him we must 
not presume to eat of our patron's bread : he said, that was true ; so ho 
brought a large basket of rusk or biscuit of their kind, and three jars 
with f sh water into the boat. I knew where my patron's case of 
bottles stood, which it was evident by the make were taken out of some 
English prize ; and I conveyed them into the boat while the Moor was 
on shore, as if they had been there before for our master. I conveyed 
also a great lump of bees- wax into the boat, which weighed above half 
a hundredweight, with a parcel of twine or thread, a hatchet, a saw, 
and a hammer, aU which were of great use to us afterwards ; especially 
the wax to make candles. Another trick 1 tried upon him, which he 
innocently came into also ; his name was Ismael, who they call Muly, 
or Moley ; so I called to him, Moley, said I, our patron's guns are on 
board the boat, can you not get a little powder and shot, it may be we 
may kill some alcamies (a fowl like our curlews) for ourselves, for I know 
he keeps the gunner's stores in the ship 1 Yes, says he, I'll bring some ; 
and accordingly he brought a great leather pouch which held about a 
pound and a half of powder, or rather more ; and another with shot, 
that had five or six poimds, with some bullets, and put all into the 
boat ; at the same time I had found some powder of my master's in the 
great cabin, with which I filled one of the large bottles in the case, 
which was almost empty ; pouring what was in it into another : and 
thus furnished with everything needful, we sailed out of the port to fish. 
The castle which is at the entrance of the port knew who we were, and 
took no notice of us ; and we were not above a mile out of the port 
before we hauled in our sail, and set us down to fish ; the wind blew 
fifom the Nl^.E. which was contrary to my desire ; for had it blown 
southerly I had been sure to have made the coast of Spain, and at least 





18 The Life and Adventures 

reached to the hay of Cadiz ; hut my resolutions were, hlow which way 
it would, I would he gone £k>di that horrid place where I was, and leave 
the rest to fate. 

After we had fished some time and catched nothing, for when I had 
fish on my hook I would not pull them up, that he might not see them ; 
I said to the Moor, this will not d^", our master will not he thus served, 
we must stand farther off : he thinking no harm agreed, and heing in 
the head of. the hoat set the sails; and as I had the helm I run the 
hoat out near a league feurther, and then brought her to as if I would 
fish, when giving the hoy the helm, I stept forward to where the Moor 
was, and making as if I stooped for something behind him, I took him 
by surprise with my arm under his legs, and tossed him clear overboard 
into the sea. He rose immediately, for he swam like a cork, and calling 
to me, begged to be taken in, told me he would go all over the world 
with me; he swsun so strong after the boat that he would have reached 
me very quickly, there being but little wind ; upon which I stepped 
into the cabin, and fetching one of the fowling pieces, I presented it at 
Wm, and told him I had done him no hurt, and if he would be quiet I 
would do him none : but, said I, you swim well enough to reach to the 
shore, and the sea is calm, make the best of your way to shore, and I 
wiU do you no harm, but if you come near the boat I'U shoot you 
through the head ; for I am resolved to have my liberty : so he turned 
himself about and swam for the shore, and I make no doubt but he 
reached it with ease, for he was an excellent swimmer. 

I could have been content to have taken this Moor with me, and have 
drowned the boy, but there was no venturing to trust him. When he 
was gone I turned to the boy, who they called Xury, and said to him, 
Xury, if you wiU be faithful to me I'll make you a great man, but if 
you will not stroke your face to be true to me, that is swear by Mahomet 
and his father's beard, I must throw you into the sea too : the boy smiled 
in my face, and spoke so innocently that I could not mistrust him; and 
swore to be faithM to me, and go all over the world with me. 

While I was in view of the Moor that was swimming, I stood out 
directly to sea with the boat, rather stretching to windward, that they 
might think me gone towards the Straits mouth (as indeed any one that 
had been in their wits must have been supposed to do), for who would 
have supposed we were sailed on to the southward to the truly Barbarian 
coast, where whole nations of Kegroes were sure to surround us with 
their canoes, and destroy us ; where we could never once go on shore 
but we should be devoured by savage beasts, or more merciless savages 
of human kind 1 




CRUSOE THROWING THE MOOR OVERBOARD 



cf Robinson Oruaoe. 19 

Bat as soon as it grew dusk in the eyening, I clianged my course, and 
steered directly south and by east, bending my course a little toward 
the east, that I might keep in with the shore ; and having a fair fresh 
gale of wind, and a smooth quiet sea, I made such sail that I believe 
by the next day at three o'clock in the afternoon, when I first made the 
land, I could not be less than 150 miles south of Sallee ; quite beyond 
iihe emperor of Morocco's dominions, or indeed of any other king there- 
abouts, for we saw no people. 

Yet such was the fright I had taken at the Moors, and the dreadful 
apprehensions I had of fedling into their hands, that I would not stop, 
or go on shore, or come to an anchor. The wind continuing fair till I 
had sailed in that manner five days, and the wind shifting to the 
southward, I concluded also that if any of our vessels were in chase of 
me, they also would now give over ; so I ventured to make the coast, 
and came to an anchor in the mouth of a little river, I knew not what, 
or where ; neither what latitude, what country, what nation, or what 
river : I neither saw, or desired to see any people, the principal thing 
I wanted was fresh water. We came into this creek in the evening, 
resolving to swim on shore as soon as it was dark, and discover the 
country ; but as soon as it was quite dark, we heard such dreadful 
noises of the barking, roaring, ajid howling of wild creatures of we 
knew not what kinds, that the poor boy was ready to die with fear, and 
begged of me not to go on shore till day. Well, Xury, said I, then I 
won't, but it may be we may see men by day, who will be as bad to us 
as those lions, lien we give them the shoot gun, says Xury, laughing; 
make them run way. Such English Xury spoke by conversing among* 
us slaves. However I was glad to see the boy so cheerful, and I gave 
him a dram (out of our patron's case of bottles) to cheer him up : after 
all Xury's advice was good, and I took it; we dropped our little anchor 
and lay still all night ; I say still, for we slept none ; for in two or 
three hours we saw vast great creatures (we knew not what to call 
them) of many sorts, come down to the sea-shore and run into the 
water, wallowing and washing themselves for the pleasure of cooling 
themselves ; and they made such hideous bowlings and yellings that 
I never indeed heard the like. 

Xury was dreadfully frighted, and indeed so was I too ; but we 
were both more frighted when we heard one of these mighty creatures 
come swimming towards our boat: we could not see him, but we might 
hear him by his blowing to be a monstrous huge and furious beast Xury 
said it was a lion, and it might be so for aught I know ; but poor 
Xury cried to me to weigh the anchor and row away. No, says I, 

o2 



£0 The Life and Adventures 

Xury, we can slip our cable with, a buoy to it and go off to sea, they 
cannot follow us far. I had no sooner said so, but I perceived the 
creature (wliatever it was) within two oars' length, which something 
surprised me; however I immediately stept to the cabiu-door, and 
taKng up my gun fired at him, upon which he immediately turned 
about and swam towards the shore again. 

But it is impossible to describe the horrible noises, and hideous cries 
and bowlings, that were raised, as well upon the edge of the shore, as 
higher within the country, upon the noise or report of the gun ; a 
thing I have some reason to believe those creatures Jiad never heard 
before : this convinced me that there was no going on shore for us in 
the night upon that coast, and how to venture on shore in the day was 
another question too ] for to have fallen into the hands of any of the 
savages, had been as bad as to have fallen into the hands of lions and 
tigers ; at least we were equally apprehensive of the danger of it 

Be that as it would, we were obliged to go on shore somewhere or 
other for water, for we had not a pint left in the boat; when or where 
to get it was the point. Xury said, if I would let him go on shore 
with one of the jars, he would find if there was any water, and bring 
some to me. I asked him why he would go ? why I should not go, 
and he stay in the boat ? The boy answered with so much affection that 
made me love him ever after. Says he, If wild mans come, they eat 
me, you go way. WeU, Xury, said I, we will both go, and if the wild 
mans come, we will kiU. them, they shall eat neither of us ; so I gave 
Xury a piece of rusk-bread to eat, and a dram out of our patron's case of 
• bottles which I mentioned before ; and we hauled the boat in as near 
the shore as we thought was proper, and waded on shore; carrying 
nothing but our guns, and two jars for water. 

I did not care to go out of sight of the boat, fearing the coming 
of canoes with savages down the river : but the boy seeing a low place 
about a mile up the country rambled to it ; and by and by I saw him 
come running towards ma I thought he was pursued by some savage, 
or frighted with some wild beast, and I ran forward towards him to 
help him, but when I came nearer to him, I saw something hanging 
over his shoulders, which was a creature that he had shot, like a hare, 
but different in colour, and longer legs ; however we were very glad of 
it, and it was very good meat ; but the great joy that poor Xury came 
with, was to teU me he had found good water, and seen no wild 
mans. 

But we found afterwards that we need not take such pains for 
water ; for a little highei up the creek where we were, we found the 



of Bobimon Orwae.

water freah wHen the tide was ont, whicH flowed but a little way up ; 
80 we filled our jars and feasted on the hare we had killed, and 
prepared to go on our way, having seen no foot-steps of any human 
creature in that part of the countiy. 




As I had been one voyage to this coast before, I knew very well 
that the islands of the Canaries, and the Cape de Yerd islands also, 
lay not far off from the coast. But as I had no instruments to take an 
observation to know what latitude we were in, and did not exactly 
know, or at least remember, what latitude they were in, I knew not 
where to look for them, or when to stand off to sea towards them ; 
otherwise I might now easily have found some o these islands. But ' 
my hope was, that if I stood along this coast till I came to that part 
where the English traded, I should find some of their vessels upon 
their usual design of trade, that would relieve and take us in. 

By the best of my calculation, that place where I now was, must be 
that country, which lying between the emperor of Morocco's dominions 
and the Negroes, lies waste, and uninhabited, except by wild beasts, 
the Negroes having abandoned it, and gone farther south for fear of 
the Moors; and the Moors not thinking it worth inhabiting, by 
reason of its barrenness ; and indeed both forsaking it because of 
the prodigious number of tigers, lions, leopards, and other furious 
creatures which harbour there ; so that the Moors use it for their 
hunting only, where they go like an army, two or three thousand men 
at a time ; and indeed for near an hundred miles together upon this 



22 The Life and Adventures 

coast, we saw nothing but a waste uninhabited country by day ; and 
heard nothing but bowlings and roaring of wild beasts by night 

Once or twice in the day-time I thought I saw the Peak of Teneriffe, 
being the high top of the mountain Teneriffe in the Canaries ; and had 
a great mind to venture out in hopes of reaching thither ; but having 
tried twice, I was forced in again by contrary winds, the sea also 
going too high for my little vessel, so I resolved to pursue my first 
design and keep along the shore. 

Several times I was obliged to land for fresh water after we had 
left this place ; and once in particular, being early in the morning, 
we came to an anchor under a little point of land which was pretty 
high, and the tide beginning to flow, we lay still to go farther in. 




Xury, whose eyes were more about him than it seems mine were, calls 
softly to me, and tells me that we had best go farther off the shore ; 
for, says he, look yonder lies a dreadful monster on the side of that 
hillock fast asleep. I looked where he pointed, and saw a dreadful 
monster indeed, for it was a terrible great lion that lay on the side of 
the shore, under the shade of a piece of the hill that bung as it were 
a little over him. Xury, says I, you shall go on shore and kill him : 
Xury looked frighted, and said. Me kill ! he eat me at one mouth ; 
one mouthful he meant. However, I said no more to the boy, but 
bade him lie stiU; and took our biggest gun, which was almost 
musquet-bore, and loaded it with a good charge of powder, and with 
two slugs, and laid it down; then I loaded another gun with two 



cf Robinson Crusoe. 28 

ImUets; and the third, for we had three pieces, I loaded with five 
smaller bullets. I took the best aim I could with the first piece, 
to hare shot him into the head, but he lay so with his leg raised a 
little above his nose, that the slugs hit his leg about the knee, and 
broke the bone. He started up growling at first, but finding his leg 
broke, fell down again, and then got up upon three legs, and gave 
the most hideous roar that ever I heard. I was a little surprised that 
I had not hit him on the head ; however, I took up the second piece 
immediately, and though he began to move of^ fired again, and shot 
him into the head, and had the pleasure to see him drop, and make 
but little noise, but lay struggling for life. Then Xury took heart, and 
would have me let him go on shore. Well, go said I. So the boy 
jumped into the water, and taking a little gun in one hand, swam to 
the shore with the other hand, and coming close to the creature, put 
the muzzle of the piece to his ear, and shot him into the head again, 
which dispatched him quite. 

This was game indeed to us, but this was no food : and I was very 
sorry to lose three charges of powder and shot upon a creature that 
was good for nothing to us. However, Xuiy said he would have some 
of him I so he comes on board, and asked me to give him the hatchet 
For what, Xury ? said I. Me cut off his head, said he. However, 
Xury could not cut off his head, but he cut off a foot, and brought it 
with him, and it was a monstrous great one. 

I bethought myseK, however, that perhaps the skin of hi m might 
one way or other be of some value to us ; and I resolved to take off 
his skin, if I could. So Xury and I went to work with him ; but 
Xuiy was much the better workman at it, for I knew very ill how to 
do it. Indeed it took us up both the whole day ; but at last we got 
the hide off hm^ and spreading it on the top of our cabin, the sun 
effectually dried it in two days' time, and it afterwards served me to 
lie upon. 

After this stop, we made on to the southward continually for ten 
or twelve days, living very sparing on our provisions, which began to 
abate very much, and gomg no oftener into the shore than we were 
obliged to for fresh water : my design in this was, to make the river 
Gambia or Senegal, that is to say anywhere about the Cape de Verd, 
where I was in hopes to meet with some European ship ; and if I did 
not^ I knew not what course I had to take, but to seek for the Islands, 
or perish there among the Negroes. I knew that all the ships from 
Europe, which sailed either to the coast of Guinea or to Brasil, or to 
the East Indies, made this Cape, or those Islands ; and, in a word, I 



24} The Life ai\d Adventures 

put the whole of my fortune upon this single point, either that I must 
meet with some ship or must perisL 

When I had pursued this resolution about ten days longer, as I 
have said, I hegan to see that the knd was inhabited ; and in two or 
three places, as we sailed by, we saw people stand upon the shore to 
look at us ; we could also perceive they were (juite black, and stark 
naked. I was once inclined to have gone on shore to them ; but 
Xury was my better counsellor, and said to me, No go, no go : however 
I hauled in nearer the shore that I might talk to them, and I found 
they ran along the shore by me a good way. I observed they had no 
weapons in their hands except one, who had a long slender stick, 
which Xury said was a lance, and that they would throw them a great 
way with good aim. So I kept at a distance, but talked with them by 
signs as well as I could ; and particularly made signs for something to* 
eat : they beckoned to me to stop my boat, and they would fetch me 
some meat ; upon this I lowered the top of my sail, and lay by, and 
two of them ran up into the country, and in less than half an hour 
came back, and brought with them two pieces of dry flesh and some 
com, as is the produce of their country ; but we neither knew what 
the one nor the other was : however, we were willing to accept it, but 
how to come at it was our next dispute, for I was not for venturing on 
shore to them, and they were as much afraid of us ; but they took a 
safe way for us all, for they brought it to the shore and laid it down, 
and went and stood a great way off till we fetched it on board, and 
then came close to us again. 

We made signs of thanks to them, for we had nothing to make 
them amends ; but an opportunity offered that very instant to oblige 
them wonderfully ; for while we were lying by the shore, came two 
mighty creatures, one pursuing the other (as we took it) with great 
fury, from the mountains towards the sea : whether it was the male 
pursuing the female, or whether they were in sport or in rage, we 
could not tell, any more than we could tell whether it was usual or 
strange, but I believe it was the latter ; because, in the first place, 
those ravenous creatures seldom appear, but in the night \ and in the 
second place, we found the people terribly frighted, especially the 
women. The man that had the lance or dart did not fly from them, 
but the rest did ; however, as the two creatures ran directly into the 
water, they did npt seem to offer to fall upon any of the Negroes, but 
plunged themselves into the sea, and swam about as if they had come 
for their diversion. At last one of them began to come nearer our 
boat than at first I expected, but I lay ready for him, for I had loaded 



cf Robinson Cnuoe. 25 

my gun "with all possible expedition, and bade Xory load both the 
others. Ab soon as he came flEdrly within my reach, I fired, and shot 
y\\m directly into the head. Immediately he simk down into the water 
but rose instantly, and plunged np and down as if he was struggling 
for life ; and so indeed he was : he immediately made to the shore, 
but between the wound, which was his mortal hurt, and the strangling 
of the water, he died just before he reached the shore. 

It is imposible to express the astonishment of these poor creatures 
at the noise and the fire of my gun ; some of them were even ready 
to die for fear, and fell down as dead with the very terror. But when 
they saw the creature dead, and sunk in the water, and that I made 
signs to them to come to the shore, they took heart and came to the 
shore, and began to search for the creature. I found him by his blood 
staining the water ; and by the help of a rope, which I slung round 
him, and gave the Kegroes to haul, they dragged him on shore, and 
found that it was a most curious leopard, spotted and fine to an ad- 
mirable degree, and the Negroes held up their hands with admira- 
tion to think what it was I had killed him with. 

The other creature, Mghted with the flash of fire and the noise of 
the gun, swam on shore, and ran up directly to the mountains from 
whence they came, nor could I at that distance know what it was. 
I found quickly the Negroes were for eating the flesh of this creature, 
so I was willing to have them take it as a favour from me, which when 
I made signs to them that they might take him, they were very 
thankful for. Immediately they fell to work with him, and though 
they had no knife, yet with a sharpened piece of wood they took off 
his skin as readily, and much more readily, than we could have done 
with a knife : they offered me some of the flesh, which I declined, 
making as if I would give it them, but made signs for the skin, which 
they gave me very freely, and brought me a great deal more of their 
provision, which though I did not understand, yet I accepted ; then I 
made signs to them for some water, and held out one of my jars to 
them, turning it bottom upward, to shew that it was empty, and that 
I wanted to have it filled. They called immediately to some of their 
friends, and there came two women, and brought a great vessel made 
of earth, and burnt, as I suppose, in the sun ; this they set down for 
me, as before, and I sent Xury on shore with my jars, and filled them 
all three. 

I was now famished with roots and com, such as it was, and water ; 
and, leaving my friendly Negroes, I made forward for about eleven 
days more, without offering to go near the shore, till I saw the land 



26 Tie L^ md AdvemimnM 

nm Ofot a gieat kngtli into tbe fle% ataboattiie<£skBiieeoffiiiir or five 
leagnf heskfie me ; and, the sea being Tery cafan, I kept a laige offing 
to make this point : at length, doabling the point at about two leagoea 
ircm. the land, I aaw jhaniy land on the other side to sea-waid ; then 
I condoded, as it was most certain-indeed, that this was the Cape de 
Yerd, and thoee the islands, called fiom thence Cape de Yezd Tsknda. 
Howerer, thej were at a great distanre, and I oonld not teU what I had 
beat dOfibtil 1 should be taken with a fiesh of wind I mi^it neither 
leach one nor the other. 

In this <^^1gmTnaJ as I was Teij pensire, I stept into the cabin and 
set me down, Xoij haying the helm, when on a sadden the boy cried 
ont^ Master, mastery a ship with a sail! and the foolish boy was 




fritted out of his wits, thiTilriTig it must needs be some of his mastei^s 
ships sent to pursue us, when I knew we were gotten far enough out 
of their reach. I jumped out of the cabin, and immediately saw not 
only the ship, but that it was a Portuguese ship, and, as I thought, 
was bound to the coast of Guinea for Negroes. But when I observed 
the course she steered, I was soon convinced they were bound some 
other way, and did not design to come any nearer to the shore ; upon 
which I stretched out to sea as much as I could, resolving to speak 
with them if possible. 

With all the sail I could make, I found I should not be able to come 
in their way, but they would be gone by before I could make any 
signal to them. But giler I had crowded to the utmost, and began to 



of Robinson Crusoe. 27 

despair^ they, it seemSy saw me by the help of their perspectiye-glasses, 
and that it was some European hoat^ which, as they supposed, must 
belong to some ship that was lost ; so they shortened sail to let me 
come up. I was encouraged with this, and as I had my patron's flag 
on board, I made a waft of it to them for a signal of distress, and fired 
a gun, both which they saw ; for they told me they saw the smoke, 
though they did not hear the gun. Upon these signals they very 
kindly brought-to, and lay-by for me, and in about three hours time I 
came up with thenu 

They asked me what I was, in Portuguese, and in Spanish, and in 
French ; but I understood none of them; but at last a Scottish sailor, 
who was on board, called to me, and I answered him, and told him 
I was an EngHflhman, that I had made my escape out of slavery from 
the Moors at Sallee. Then they bade me come on board, and very 
kindly took me in, and all my goods. 

It was inexpressible joy to me, that any one would believe, that I 
was thus delivered, as I esteemed it, from such a miserable and almost 
hopeless condition as I was in, and immediately offered all I had to the 
captain of the ship, as a return for my deliverence ; but he generously 
told me, he would take nothing from me, but that all I had should be 
delivered safe to me when I came to the Brasils ; for, says he, I have 
saved your life on no other terms than I would be glad to be saved 
myself ; and it may one time or other be my lot to be taken up in the 
same condition : Besides, says he, when I carry you to the Brasils, so 
great a way from your own country, if I should take away from you 
what you have, you will be starved there, and then I only take away 
that life I have given. No, no, Seignor, Mr. Englishman, I will carry 
you thilher in charity, and those things will help you to buy your sub- 
sistence there, and your passage home again. 

As he was charitable in his proposal, so he was just in the perform- 
ance to a tittle, for he ordered the seamen, that none should offer to 
touch anything I had ; then he took everything into his own possession, 
and gave me back an exact inventory of them, that I might have them ; 
even so much as my three earthen jars. 

As to my boat, it was a very good one, and that he saw, and told 
me he would buy it of me for the ship's use, and asked me what I 
would have for it? I told him, he had been so generous to me in every- 
thing, that I could not offer to make any price of the boat, but left it 
entirely to him ; upon which he told me he would give me a note of 
his hand to pay me 80 pieces of eight for it at Brasil ; and when it 
came there, if any one offered to give more, he would make it up ; h^ 



28 The Life and Adventures 

offered me also 60 pieces of eight more for my boy Xniy, which I was 
loth to take ; not that I was not willing to let the captain have him^ 
but I was very loth to sell the poor bo/s liberty, who had assisted me 
so Mthfully in procnring my own." However, when I let him know 
my reason, he owned it to be jnst^ and offered me this medimn, that 
he would give the boy an obligation to set him free in ten years, if he 
turned Christian. Upon this, and Xury saying he was willing to go 
to him, I let the captain have him. 

We had a very good voyage to the Brasils, and arrived in All-Saints- 
Bay, in about twenty-two days after. And now I was once more de- 
livered from the most miserable of aU conditions of life, and what to 
do next with myself I was now to consider. 

The generous treatment the captain gave me, I can never enough 
remember; he would take nothing of me for my passage, gave me twenty 
ducats for the leopard's skin, and forty for the lion's skin, which I had 
in my boat, and caused everything I had in the ship to be punctually 
delivered me ; and what I was willing to seU he bought, such as the 
case of bottles, two of my guns, and a piece of the lump of bees-wax, 
for I had made candles of the rest; in a word, I made about 220 pieces 
of eight of all my cargo, and with this stock I went on shore in the 
Brasils. 

I had not been long here, but being recommended to the house of a 
good honest man like himself, who had an Ingenio as they call it, that 
is, a plantation and a sugar house ; I lived with him some time, and 
acquainted myself by that means with the manner of their planting 
and making of sugar ; and seeing how well the planters lived, and how 
they grew rich suddenly, I resolved, if I could get license to settle there, 
I would turn planter among them, resolving in the meantime to find 
out some way to get my money, which I had left in London, remitted 
to me. To this purpose, getting a kind of a letter of naturalization, I 
purchased as much land that was uncured as my money would reach, 
and formed a plan for my plantation and settlement, and such a one as 
might be suitable to the stock which I proposed to myself to receive 
from England. 

I had a neighbour, a Portuguese of Lisbon, but bom of English 
parents, whose name was "Wells, and in much such circumstances as I 
was. I call him neighbour, because his plantation lay next to mine, 
and we went on very sociably together. My stock was but low, as well 
as his ; and we rather planted for food, than anything else, for about 
two' years. However, we began to increase, and our land began to come 
into order ; so that the third year we planted some tobacco, and made

each of HB a large piece of gronnd ready for planting canes in tlie year 
to come; but we both wanted help ; and now I found, more than before, 
I had done wrong in parting with my boy Xury. 

But alas ! for me to do wrong, that never did right, was no great 
wonder : I had no remedy but to go on ; 1 was gotten into an employ- 
ment quite remote to my genius, and directly contrary to the life I 
delighted in, and for which I forsook my father^s house, and broke 
through all his good advice ; nay, I was coming into the very middle 
station, or upper degree of low life, which my father advised me to 
before ; and which if I resolved to go on with, I might as well have 
staid at home, and never have fiitigued myself in the world as I had 
done: and I used often to say to myself I could have done this as well 
in England among my friends, as Imve gone five thousand miles off to. 
do it, among strangers and savages in a wilderness, and at such distance 
as never to hear &om any part of the world that had the least know- 
ledge of me. 

In this manner I used to look upon my condition with the utmost 
regret. I had nobody to converse with, but now and then this neigh- 
bour : no work to be done, but by the labour of my hands ; and I used 
to say, I lived just like a man cast away upon some desolate island, that 
had nobody there but himself But how just has it been, and how 
should all men reflect, that, when they compare their present conditions 
with others that are worse, Heaven may oblige them to make the 
exchange, and be convinced of their former felicity, by their experience; 
I say how just has it been, that the truly solitary life I reflected on in 
an island of mere desolation should be my lot, who had so often unjustly 
compared it with the life which I then led, in which, had I continued, 
I had in all probability been exceeding prosperous and rich. 

I was in some degree settled in my measures for carrying on the 
plantation, before my kind friend the captain of the ship that took me 
up at sea, went back; for the ship remained there, providing his loading, 
and preparing for his voyage, near three months ; when, telling him 
what little stock I had left behind me in London, he gave me this 
friendly and sincere advice : Seignor Inglese, says he (for so he always 
called me), if you will give me letters, and a procuration here in form 
to me, with orders to the person who has your money in London, to 
send your effects to Lisbon, to such persons as I shall direct, and in 
such goods as are proper for this country, I will bring you the produce 
of them, Grod willing, at my return ; but since human affairs are all 
subject to changes and disasters, I would have you give orders tut for 
one hundred pounds sterling, which you ttty is half your stock, and let

the hazard he run for the first ; so that if it come safe, you may order 
thb rest the same way ; and if it miscarry, you may have the other half 
to have recourse to it for your supply. 

This was so wholesome advice, and looked so friendly, that I could 
not but be convinced it was the best course I could take ; so I accord- 
ingly prepared letters to the gentlewoman with whom I had left; my 
money, and a procuration to the Portuguese captain, as he desired. 

I wrote the English captain's widow a full account of all my adven- 
tures, my slavery, escape, and how I had met with the Portugal captain 
at sea, the humanity of his behaviour, and what condition I was now 
in, with all other necessary directions for my supply ; and when this 
honest captain came to Lisbon, he found means, by some of the English 
merchants there, to send over, not the order only, but a fall account of 
my story, to a merchant at London, who represented it effectually to 
her; whereupon, she not only delivered the money, but out of her own 
pocket sent the Portugal captain a veiy handsome present for his 
humanity and charity to me. 

The merchant in London vesting this hundred pounds in English 
goods, such as the captain had written for, sent them directly to him 
at Lisbon, and he brought them all safe to me to the Brasils ; among 
which, without my directions (for I was too young in my business to 
think of them), he had taken care to have all sorts of tools, iron-work, 
and utensils necessary for my plantation, and which were of great use 
to me. 

When this cargo arrived I thought my fortune made, for I was sur- 
prised with joy of it ; and my good steward the captain had laid out 
the five pounds which my friend had sent him for a present for him- 
seli^ to purchase, and bring me over a servant under bond for six years 
service, and would not accept of any consideration, except a little 
tobacco, which I would have him accept, being of my own produce. 

Neither was this all ; but my goods being all English manufactures, 
such as cloth, stuffs, baize, and things particularly valuable and 
desirable in the country, I found means to sell them to a very great 
advantage, so that I may say I had more than four times the value of 
my first cargo, and was now infinitely beyond my poor neighbour, I 
mean in the advancement of my plantation ; for the first thing I did, 
I bought me a Negro slave, and an European servant also ; I mean 
another besides that which the captain brought me from Lisbon. 

But as abused prosperity is oftentimes made the very means of our 
greatest adversity, so it was with me. I went on the next year with 
great success in my plantation ; I raised fifty great rolls of tobacco on 



of Bchinsan Crusoe. 




SI 

my own groimcl, more than I liad disposed of for necessaries among 
my neighbours ; and these fifty rolls, being each of above an hundred- 
weighty were well cured and laid by against the return of the fleet from 
Lisbon. And now, increasing 
in business and in wealth, 
my head began to be full 
of projects and undertakings 
beyond my reach; such as 
are indeed often the ruin of 
the best heads in business. 

Had I continued in the 
station I was now in, I had 
room for all the happy 
things to have ^et befallen 
me, for which my father so 
earnestly recommended a 
quiet retired life, and of 
which he had sO sensibly 
described the middle station of life to be full; but other things 
attended me, and I was still to be the wilful agent of all my own 
miseries ; and particularly to increase my fault, and double the 
reflections upon myself, which in my future sorrows I should have 
leisure to maka All these miscarriages were procured by my 
apparent obstinate adhering to my foolish inclination of wandering 
abroad, and pursuing that inclination in contradiction to the clearest 
views of doing myself good in a fair and plain pursuit of those 
prospects and those measures of life, which nature and Providence 
concurred to present me with, and to make my duty. 

As I had done thus in breaking away from my parents, so I could 
not be content now, but I must go and leave the happy view I had of 
being a rich and thriving man in my new plantation, only to pursue a 
rash and immoderate desire of rising faster than the nature of the 
thing admitted ; and thus I cast myself down again into the deepest 
gulph of human misery that ever man fell into, or perhaps could be 
consistent with life and a state of health in the world. 

To come then by the just degrees to the particulars of this part of 
my story ; you may suppose, that having now lived almost four years 
in the Brasils, and beginning to thrive and prosper very well upon my 
plantation, I had not only learned the language, but had contracted 
acquaintance and friendship among my fellow planters, as well as 
among the merchants at St. Salvadore, which was our port ; and that 



82 The Life and Adventures 

in my discourses among them I had fi^quently given them an account 
of my two voyages to the coast of Guinea, the manner of trading with 
the Negroes there, and how easy it was to purchase upon the coast, for 
trifles, such as heads, toys, knives, scissors, hatchets, bits of glass, and 
the like, not only gold dust, Guinea grains, elephants' teeth, &c., but 
I^egroes for the service of the Brasils, in great numbers. 

They listened always very attentively to my discourses on these 
heads, but especially to that part which related to the buying I^egroes^ 
which was a trade at that time not only not far entered into, but as fax 
as it was, had been carried on by the Assientos, or permission of the 
kings of Spain and Portugal, and engrossed in the public, so that few 
N^roes were bought, and those excessively dear. 

It happened, being in company with some merchants and planters of 
my acquaintance, and talking of those things very earnestly, three of 
them came to me the next morning, and told me they had been musing 
very much upon what I had discoursed with them of the last nighty 
and they came to make a secret proposal to me ; and after enjoining 
me secrecy, they told me that they had a mind to fit* out a ship to go 
to Guinea; that they had all plantations as well as I, and were 
straitened for nothing so much as servants; that as this was a trade that 
could not be carried on, because they could not publicly sell the 
Negroes when they came home; so they desired to make but one 
voyage, to bring the Negroes on shore privately, and divide them 
among their own plantations; and in a word, the question waa^ 
whether I would go as their supercargo in the ship, to manage the 
trading part upon the coast of Guinea; and they offered me that I 
should have my equal share of the Negroes, without providing any part 
of the stock. 

This was a fair proposal, it must be confessed, had it been made to 
any one that had not had a settlement and plantation of his own to 
look after, which was in a fair way of becoming very considerable, and 
with a good stock upon it. But for me, that was thus entered and 
established, and had nothing to do but go on as I had begun, for three 
or four years more, ani to have sent for the other hundred pounds 
from England, and who in that time, and with that little addition, 
could scarce have failed of being worth three or four thousand pounds 
sterling, and that increasing too ; for me to think of such a voyage, 
was the most preposterous thing that ever man in such cii'cumstances 
could be guilty of. 

But I, that was bom to be my own destroyer, could no more resist 
the offer, than I could restrain my first rambling designs, when my 



cf Bcbinaon Crusoe. 33 

&1ihei^8 good cotmsel was lost npon me. In a word, I told them 
I woidd go with all m j heart, if thej would undertake to look after my 
plantation in my absence, and would dispose of it to such as I should 
direct if I miscarried. This they all engaged to do, and entered into 
writings or covenants to do so ; and I made a formal will, disposing of 
my plantation and effects, in case of my death, making the captain of 
the ship that had saved my life, as before, my universal heir ; 
but obliging him to dispose of my effects as I had directed in my will, 
one half of the produce being to himself^ and the other to be shipped 
to England. 

In short, I took all possible caution to preserve my effects, and keep 
up my plantation. Had I used half as much prudence to have looked 
into my own interest, and have made a judgment of what I ought to 
have done and not to have done, I had certainly never gone away from 
so prosp^ous an undertaking, leaving all the probable views of a 
thriving circumstance, and gone upon a voyage to sea, attended with 
all its conmion hazards ; to say nothing of the reasons I had to expect 
particidar misfortunes to myself 

But I was hurried on, and obeyed blindly the dictates of my fancy 
rather than my reason ; and accordingly, the ship being fitted out, and 
the cargo furnished, and all things done as by agreement by my 
partners in the voyage, I went on board in an evil hour, the 1st of 
September — ^being the same day eight years that I went from my father 
and mother at Hull, in order to act the rebel to their authority, and 
the fool to my own interest 

Our ship was about 120 tons burthen, carried 6 guns, and 14 men, 
besides the master, his boy, and myself We had on bosurd no large 
cargo of goods, except of such toys as were fit for our trade with the 
Negroes, such as beads, bits of glass, shells, and odd trifles, especially 
little looking-glasses, knives, scissors, hatchets, and the Kke. 

The same day I went on board we set sail, standing away to the 
northwsurd upon our own coast, with design to stretch over for the 
African coast when they came about ten or twelve degrees of northern 
latitude, which it soems was the manner of their course in those days. 
We had very good weather, only excessive hot, all the way upon our 
own coast till we came the height of Cape St Augustino ; from whence, 
keeping farther off at sea, we lost sight of land, and steered as if we were 
bound for the isle Femand de Noronha, holding our course N. K by K 
and leaving those isles on the east In this course we passed the line 
in about twelve days' time, and were by our last observation in seven 
degrees twenty-two minutes northern latitude, when a violent tornado

or hurricane took us quite out of our knowledge. It began from tiie- 
south-east, came about to the north-west, and then settled into the 
north-east, from whence it blew in such a terrible manner, that for 
twelve days together we could do nothing but drive, and scudding 
away before it, let it carry us whither ever fate and the fury of the 
winds directed ; and during these twelve days I need not say that I 
expected every day. to be swallowed up, nor indeed did any in the ship 
expect to save their lives. 

In this distress, we had, besides the terror of the storm, one of our. 
men died of fever, and one man and the boy washed overboard. About- 
the twelfth day, the weather abating a little, the master made an obser- 
vation as well as he could, and found he was in about eleven degrees 
north latitude, but that he was twenty-two degrees of longitude difference 
west from Cape St. Augustino ; so that he found he was gotten upon the 
coast of Guinea, or the north part of Brasil, beyond the river Amazones, 
toward that of the river Oronoque, commonly called the Great Eiver, 
and began to consult with me what course he should take, for the ship 
was leaky and very much disabled, and he was going directly back to 
the coast of Brasil. 

I was positively against that ; and looking over the charts of the 
sea-ooast of America with him, we concluded there was no inhabited . 




country for us to have recourse to, till we came within the circle of the 
Caribbee Islands, and therefore resolved to stand away for Barbadoes, 
which, by keeping off at sea, to avoid the indraught of the bay or gulf 
of Mexico, we might easily perform, as we hoped, in about fifteen days' 



of Uobi'Mon Crusoe. 35 

sail ; whereas, we could not possibly make onr voyage to the coast of 
A£rica without some assistance, both to our ship and to ourselves. 

With this design we changed our course, and steered away N. W. by 
W. in order to reach some of our English islands, where I hoped for 
relief ; but our voyage was otherwise determined ; for being in the 
latitude of twelve degrees eighteen minutes, a second storm came upon 
us, which carried us away with the same impetuosity westward^ and 
drove us so out of the very way of all human commerce, tbat had all 
our lives been saved, as to the sea, we were rather in danger of being 
devoured by savages than ever returning to our own country. 

In this distress, the wind still blowing very hard, one .of our men 
early in the morning cried out, Land ! and we had no sooner run out of 
the cabin to look out, in hopes of seeing whereabouts in the world we 
were, but the ship struck upon a sand, and in a moment, her motion being 
so stopped, the sea broke over her in such a manner, that we expected 
we should all have perished immediately; and we were immediately 
driven into our close quarters, to shelter us from the very foam and 
spray of the sea. 

It is not easy for any one, who has not been in the like condition, to 
describe or conceive the consternation of men in such circumstances. 
We knew nothing where we were, or upon what land it was we were 
driven, whether an island or the main, whether inhabited or not in- 
habited; and as the rage of the wind was still great, though rather less 
than at first, we could not so much as hope to have the ship hold many 
minutes without breaking in pieces, unless the winds, by a kind of 
miracle, should turn immediately about In a word, we sat looking one 
upon another, and expecting death every moment, and every man 
acting accordingly as preparing for another world, for there was little 
or nothing more for us to do in this. That which was our present 
comfort, and all the comfort we had, was, that contraiy to our expec- 
tation the ship did not break yet, and that the master said the wind 
began to abate. 

Now, though we found that the wind did a little abate, yet the ship 
having thus struck upon the sand, and sticking too fast for us to expect 
her getting off, we were in a dreadful condition indeed, and had nothing 
to do but to think of saving our lives as well as we could. We had a 
boat at our stem just before the storm, but she was first staved by 
<1ft«hing against the ship's rudder, and in the next place she broke away, 
and either sunk or was driven off to sea, so there was no hope from her. 
We had another boat on board, but how to get her off into the sea 
was a doubtful thing j however, there was no room to debate, for w6 

D 2 



36 The Life and Adventures 

fencied the ship would break in pieces every minute, and some told us 
she was actually broken already. 

In this distress, the mate of our vessel lays hold of the boat, and 
with the help of the rest of the men, they got her slung over the ship's 
side, and getting all into her, let go, and committed ourselves, being eleven 
in number, to God's mercy and the wild sea ; for though the storm was 
abated considerably, yet the sea went dreadful high upon the shore, and 
might well be called den wild zee, as the Dutch call the sea in a storm. 

And now our case was very dismal indeed ; for we all saw plainly 
that the sea went so high, that the boat could not live, and that we 
should be inevitably drowned. As to making sail, we had none, nor, 
if we had, could we have done anything with it, so we worked at the 
oar towards the land, though with heavy hearts, like men going to 
execution ; for we all knew, that when the boat came nearer the shore, 
she would be dashed in a thousand pieces by the breach of the sea. 
However, we committed our souls to God in the most earnest manner, 
and the wind driving us towards the shore, we hastened our destruction 
with our own hands, pulling as well as we could towards land. 

What the shore was, whether rock or sand, whether steep or shoal, 
we knew not ; the only hope that could rationally give us the least 
shadow of expectation was, if we might happen into some bay or gulf, 
or the mouth of some river, where by great chance we might have run 
our boat in, or got under the lee of the land, and perhaps made smooth 
water. But there was nothing of this appeared ; but as we made 
nearer and nearer the shore, the land looked more frightful than the sea. 

After we had rowed, or rather driven, about a league and a hal^ as 
we reckoned it, a raging wave, mountain-like, came rolling a-stem of 
us, and plainly bade us expect the coup-de-grace. In a word, it took 
us with such a fury, that it overset the boat at once ; and separating 
us, as well from the boat as from one another, gave us not time hardly 
to say, God ! for we were all swallowed up in a moment. 

Nothing can describe the confusion of thought which I felt when I 
sunk into the water ; for though I swam very well, yet I could not 
deliver myself from the waves so as to draw breath, till that wave 
having driven me, or rather carried me, a vast way on towards the shore, 
and having spent itself, went back, and left me upon the land almost 
dry, but half dead with the water I took in. I had so much presence 
of mind, as well as breath left, that seeing myself nearer the main 
land than I expected, I got upon my feet, and endeavoured to make 
on towards the land as fast I could, before another wave should return 
and take me up again. But I soon found it was impossible to avoid 



of Bobtnson Crusoe, 37 

it ; for I saw the sea come after me as high as a great hill, and as 
furious as an enemy which I had no means or strength to contend witL 
My business was to hold my breath, and raise myself upon the water, 
if I could ; and so by swimming to preserve my breathing, and pilot 
myself towards the shore, if possible. My greatest concern now being 
that the sea, as it would cany me a great way towards the shore when 
it came on, might not carry me back again with it when it gave back 
towards the sea. 

The wave that came upon me again buried me at once 20 or 30 feet 
deep in its own body, and I could feel myself carried with a mighty 
force and swiftness towards the shore, a very great way ; but I held 
my breath,, and assisted myself to swim still forward with all my 
might I was ready to burst with holding my breath, when, as I felt 
myself rising up, so, to my immediate relief I found my head and 
hands shoot out above the surface of the water ; and though it was not 
two seconds of time that I could keep myself so, yet it relieved me 
greatly, gave me breath and new courage. I was covered again with 
water a good while, but not so long but I held it out ; and finding the 
water had spent itself, and began to return, I struck forward against 
the return of the waves, and felt ground again with my feet I stood 
still a few moments to recover breath, and till the water went from 
me, and then took to my heels and ran with what strength I had 
farther towards the shore. But neither would this deliver me from the 
iiiiy of the sea, which came pouring in after me again, and twice more 
I was lifted up by the waves and carried forwards as before, the shore 
being very flat 

The last time of these two had well near been fatal to me ; for the 
sea having hurried me along as before, landed me, or rather dashed me, 
against a piece of a rock, and that with such force, as it left me 
senseless, and indeed helpless, as to my own deliverance ; for the blow 
taking my side and breast, beat the breath as it were quite out of my 
body ; and had it not returned again immediately, I must have been 
strangled in the water ; but I recovered a little before the return of the 
waves, and seeing I should be covered again with the water, I resolved 
to hold fast by a piece of the rock, and so hold my breath, if possible, 
tiU the wave went back. Now as the waves were not so high as at 
first, being near land, I held my hold till the wave abated, and then 
fetched another run, which brought me so near the shore that the 
next wave, though it went over me, yet did not so swallow me up as 
to carry me away ; and the next run I took I got to the main land, 
where, to my great comfort, I clambered up the clefts of the shore. 



38 The Life and Adventures 

and sat me down upon the grass, free fix)m danger, and quite out of 
the reach of the water. 

I was now landed and safe on shore, and began to look up and 
thank God that my life was saved in a case wherein there was some 
minutes before scarce any room to hope. I believe it is impossible to 
express to the life what the ecstasies and transports of the soul are, 
when it is so saved, as I may say, out of the very grava I walked 
about on the shore, lifting up my hands, and my whole being, as I 
may say, wrapt up in the contemplation of my deliverance, making a 
thousand gestures and motions which I cannot describe, reflecting 
upon all my comrades that were drowned, and that there should not 
be one soid saved but myself; for, as for them, I never saw them 
afterwards, or any sign of them, except three of their hats, one cap, 
and two shoes that were not fellows. 

I cast my eyes to the stranded vessel, when the breach and froth 
of the sea being so big, I could hardly see it, it lay so far off, and con- 
sidered, Lord ! how was it possible I could get on shore ! 

After I had solaced my mind with the comfortable part of my con- 
dition, I began to look around me, to see what kind of place I was in, 
and what was next to be done ; and I soon found my comforts abate, 
and that, in a word, I had a dreadful deliverance. For I was wet, had 
no clothes to shift me, nor anything either to eat or drink to comfort 
me ; neither did I see any prospect before me, but that of perishing 
with hunger, or being devoured by wild beasts ; and that which was 
particularly afflicting to me, was, that I had no weapon either to hunt 
and kill any creature for my sustenance, or to defend myself against 
any other creature that might desire to kill me for theirs. In a word, 
I had nothing about me but a knife, a tobacco-pipe, and a little tobacco 
in a box ; this was all my provision, and this threw me into terrible 
agonies of mind, that for a while I ran about like a madman. Night 
coming upon me, I began with a heavy heart to consider what would 
be my lot if there were any ravenous beasts in that country, seeing at 
night they always come abroad for their prey. 

All the remedy that offered to my thoughts at that time was, to 
get up into a thick bushy tree like a fir, but thorny, which grew near 
me, and where I resolved to sit all night, and consider the next day 
what death I should die, for as yet I saw no prospect of life. I 
walked about a furlong from the shore, to see if I could find any fresh 
water to drink, which I did, to my great joy ; and having drank, and 
put a little to})acco in my mouth to prevent hunger, I went to the tree, 
and getting up into it, endeavoured to place myself so as that if I

cf Bobinsan Crusoe. 39 

should sleep I might not Ml ; and having cut me a short stick, like a 
truncheon, for my defence, I took up my lodging, and having been 
excessively fatigued I fell fsist asleep, and slept as comfortably as, I 




believe, few could have done in my condition, and found myself the 
most refreshed with it that I think I ever was on such an occasion. 

When I waked it was broad day, the weather clear, and the storm 
abated, so that the sea did not rage and swell as before; but that 
which surprised me most was, that the ship was lifted off in the night 
from the sand where she lay by the swelling of the tide, and was 
driven up almost as far as the rock which I first mentioned, where I 
had been so bruised by the dashing me against it. This being within 
about a mile from the shore where I was, and the ship seeming to 
stand upright still, I wished myself on board, that, at least, I might 
save some necessary things for my use. 

When I came down from my apartment in the tree, I looked about 
me again, and the first thing I found was the boat, which lay as the 
wind and the sea had tossed her, up upon the land, about two miles on 
my right hand. I walked as far as I could upon the shore to have got 
to her, but found a neck or inlet of water between me and the boat, 
which was about half a mile broad ; so I came back for the present, 
being more intent upon getting at the ship, where I hoped to find 
somethiiig for my present subsistence. 

A little after noon I found the sea very calm, and the tide ebbed so 
fSar out that I could come within a quarter of a mile of idie shij), and 



40 



The Life and Adventures 



here I found a fresh renewing of my grief; for I saw evidently, that if 
we had kept on board, we had been all safe, that is to say, we had all 
got safe on shore, and I had not been so miserable as to be left entirely 
destitute of all comfort and company, as I now was. This forced tears 
from my eyes again, but as there was little relief in that, I resolved, if 
possible, to get to the ship, so I pulled off my clothes, for the weather 
waa hot to extremity, and took the water; but when I came to the 
ship, my difficulty was still greater to know how to get on board, for 
as she lay a-ground, and high out of the water, there was nothing 
within my reach to lay hold of. I swam round her twice, and the 
second time I ipied a small piece of rope, which I wondered I did not 
see at first, hang down by the fore-chains so low as that with great 




difficulty I got hold of it, and by the help of that rope got up into the 
forecastle of the ship. Here I found that the ship was bulged, and had 
a great deal of water in her hold, but that she lay so on the side of a 
bank of hard sand, or rather earth, that her stem lay lifted up upon the 
bank, and her head low almost to the water. By this means all her 
quarter was free, and all that was in that part was dry ; for you may be 
sure toy first work was to search and to see what was spoiled and what 
was free ; and first I found that all the ship's provisions were dry and 
untouched by the water ; and being very well disposed to eat, I went 
to the bread-room and filled my pockets with biscuit, and eat it as I 
went about other things, for I had no time to lose. I also found some 
rum in the great cabin, of which I took a large dram, and which I had

of Bjobinson Crusoe. 41 

indeed need enongh. of to spirit me for what was before me. Now I 
wanted nothing but a boat to fumish myself with many things which 
I foresaw would be very necessary to me. 

It was in yain to sit still and wish for what was not to be had, and 
this extremity roused my application. We had several spare yards, and 
two or three large spars of wood, and a spare top-mast or two in the 
ship. I resolved to fall to work with these, and flung as many of them 
overboard as I could manage for their weight, tying every one with a 
lope that they might not drtve away; when this was done I went down 
the ship's side, and pulling them to me, I tied four of them fast together 
at both ends, as well as I could, in the form of a raft, and laying two 
or three short pieces of plank upon them cross- ways, I found I could 
walk upon it very well, but that it was not able to bear any great weight, 
the pieces being too light ; so I went to work, and with the carpenter^s 
saw I cut a spare top-mast into three lengths, and added them to my 
raft, with a great deal of labour and pains : but hope of furnishing 
myself with necessaries encouraged me to go beyond what I should 
have been able to have done upon another occasion. 

My raft was now strong enough to bear any reasonable weight ; my 
next care was what to load it with, and how to preserve what I laid 
upon it horn the surf of the sea ; but I was not long considering this. 
I first laid all the planks or boards upon it that I could get, and having 
considered well what I most wanted, I first got three of the seamen's 
chests, which I had broken open and emptied, and lowered them down 
upon my raft. The first of these I filled with provisions, namely, bread, 
rice, three Dutch cheeses, five pieces of dried goat's flesh, which we 
lived much upon, and a little remainder of European com which had 
been laid by for some fowls which we brought to sea with us, but the 
fowls were kiUed. There had been some barley and wheat together ; but, 
to my great disappointment, I found afterwards that the rats had eaten 
or spoiled it all As for liquors, I found several cases of bottles belonging 
to our skipper, in which were some cordial waters, and in all about five 
or six gallons of rack ; these I stowed by themselves, there being no 
need to put them into the chest, nor no room for them. While I was 
doing this, I found the tide began to flow, though very calm ; and I 
had the mortification to see my coat, shirt, and waistcoat, which I had 
left on shore upon the sand, swim away ; as for my breeches, which 
were only linen and open-kneed, I swam on board in them and my 
stockings. However, this put me upon rummaging for clothes, of which 
I found enough, but took no more than I wanted for present use; for I 
had other things which my eye was more upon — as, first, tools to work 



42 The Life and Adventures 

with on shore ; and it was after long searching that I found out the 
carpenter^s chest, which was indeed a very useful prize to me, and much 
more valuahle than a ship-loading of gold would have heen at that 
time. I got it down to my raft, even whole as it was, without losing 
time to look into it, for I knew in general what it contained. 

My next care was for some ammunition and arms. There were two 
very good fowling-pieces in the great cahin, and two pistols ; these I 
secured first, with some powder-horns, and a small bag of shot, and two 
old rusty swords. I knew there were three barrels of powder in the 
ship, but knew not where our gunner had stowed them; but with 
much search t found them, two of them dry and good, the third had 
taken water. Those two I got to my raft, with the arms ; and now I 
thought myself pretty well freighted, and began to think how I should 
get to shore with them, haying neither sail, oar, nor rudder, and the least 
cap-fall of wind would have overset all my navigation. 

I had three encouragements : a smooth, calm sea, the tide rising and 
setting into the shore, and what little wind there was blew me towards 
the land ; and thus, having found two or three broken oars belonging 
to the boat, and besides the tools which were in the chest, I found two 
saws, an axe and a hammer, and with this cargo I put to sea. For a 
mile, or thereabouts, my raft went very well, only that I found it drive 
a little distant from the place where I had landed before, by which I 
perceived that there was some indraft of the water, and consequently 
I hoped to find some creek or river there, which I might make use of 
as a port to get to land with my cargo. 

As I imagined, so it was. There appeared before me a little opening 
of the land, and I found a strong current of the tide set into it, so I 
guided my raft as well as I could to keep in the middle of the stream ; 
but here I had like to have suffered a second shipwreck, which, if I 
had, I think verily would have broke my heart ; for knowing nothing 
of the coast, my raft run a-ground at one end of it upon a shoal, and 
not being a-ground at the other end, it wanted but a little that all my 
cargo had slipped off towards that end that was afloat, and so fallen into 
the water. I did my utmost, by setting my back against the chests, to 
keep them in their places, but could not thrust off the raft with all my 
strength, neither durst I stir from the posture I was in ; but holding 
up the chests with all my might, stood in that manner near haK an 
hour, in which time the rising of the water brought me a little more 
upon a level ; and a little after, the water still rising, my raft floated 
again, and I thrust her off with the oar I had into the channel ; and 
then driving up higher, I at length found myself in the mouth of a 



of Robinson Crusoe, 43 

little river, with land on both sides, and a strong current or tide running 
np. I looked on both sides for a proper place to get to shore, for I was 
not willing to be driven too high up the river, hoping in time to see 
some ship at sea^ and therefore resolved to place myself as near the 
coast as I could. 

At length I spied a little cove on the right shore of the creek, to 
which, with great pain and difficulty, I guided my raft, and at last got 
80 near, as that, reaching ground with my oar, I could thrust her directly 
in. But here I had liked to have dipped all my cargo in the sea again ; 
for that shore lying pretty steep, that is to say sloping, there was no 
place to land, but where one end of the float, if it run on shore, would 
lie so high, and the other sink lower as before, that it would endanger 
my cargo again. All that I could do, was to wait till the tide was at 
the highest, keeping the raft with my oar like an anchor to hold the 
side of it fast to the shore, near a flat piece of ground, which I expected 
the water would flow over ; and so it did. As soon as I found water enough 
(for my raft drew about a foot of water), I thrust her on upon that flat 
piece of ground, and there fastened or moored her by sticking my two 
broken oars into the ground ; one on one side near one end, and one 
on the other side near the other end ; and thus I lay till the water 
ebbed away, and left my raft and all my cargo safe on shore. 

My next work was to view the country, and seek a proper place for 
my habitation, and where to stow my goods to secure them from what- 
ever might happen. Where I was I yet knew not ; whether on the- 
continent or on an island, whether inhabited or not inhabited, whether 
in danger of wild beasts or not. There was a hill not above a mile from 
me, which rose up very steep and high, and which seemed to over-top 
some other hills which lay as in a ridge from it northward. I took out 
one of the fowling-pieces, and one of the pistols, and an horn of powder, 
and thus armed, I travelled for discovery up to the top of that hill ; 
where, after I had with great labour and difficulty got to the top, I saw 
my fate to my great affliction, namely, that I was in an island environed 
every way with the sea, no land to be seen, except some rocks which 
lay a great way off, and two small islands less than this, which lay about 
three leagues to the west. 

I found also that the island I was in was barren, and, as I saw good 
reason to believe, uninhabited, except by wild beasts, of whom how- 
ever I saw none ; yet I saw abundance of fowls, but knew not their 
kinds, neither when I killed them could I tell what was fit for food, 
and what not. At my coming back, I shot at a great bird, which I 
saw sitting upon a tree on the side of a great wood — I believe it was 



44 



He L^ ami Adtemtmrm 



the fbst gun that had heen fiied there amce the cieatioxL of the iroild. 
I had so sooner fired, but from all parts of the wood there arose 
an inntmierable number of fbids of many sorta^ malring a confused 
screaming and crying every one aonsding to his nsoal note ; but not 
one of them of any kind that I knew. As for the creature I killed, I 
took it to be akind of hawk, its colour and beak resembling it, but had 
no talons or claws more than common; its flesh was carrion and fit 
for nothing. 

Contented with this discovery, I came back to my raft, and fell to 
work to bring my cargo on shore, which took me np the rest of that 
day ; and what to do with myself at ni^t I knew not, nor indeed 
where to rest ; for I was afraid to lie down on the ground, not knowing 
but some wild beast mi^t devour me^ though, as I afterwards found, 
there was really no need for those fear& 

However, as well as I could, I barricaded myself round with the 
chests and boards that I had brought on shore, and made a kind of a hut 




for that night's lodging. As for food, I yet saw not Tvbich way to supply 
myself except that I had seen two or three creatures, like hares, run 
out of the wood where I shot the bird. 

I now began to consider that I might yet get a great many things 
out of the ship which would be useful to me, and particularly some of 
the rigging and sails, and such other things as might come to land, 
and I resolved to make another voyage on board the vessel, if possible ; 
and as I knew that the first storm that blew must necessarily break 



cf Bcbinaon Crusoe. 45 

her all in pieces, I resolved to set all other things apart till I got 
eveiything out of the ship that I could get Then I called a council, 
that is to say, in my thoughts, whether I should take back the raft ; 
but this appeared impracticable, so I resolved to go as before, when 
the tide was down, and I did so, only that I stripped before I went 
horn my hut, having nothing on but a chequered shirt, and a pair of 
linen trousers, and a pair of pumps on my feet 

I got on board the ship, as before, and prepared a second raft, and 
having had experience of the first, I neither made this so unwieldy, 
nor loaded it so hard ; but yet I brought away several things very 
useful to me ; as first, in the carpenter's stores, I found two or three 
bags full of nails and spikes, a great screw jack, a dozen or two of 
hatchets, and above all, that most useful thing called a grindstone. All 
these I secured, together with several things belonging to the gunner, 
particularly two or three iron crows, and two barrels of musket-bullets, 
seven muskets, and another fowling-piece, with some small quantity of 
powder more, a large bag full of small shot, and a great roll of sheet 
lead ; but this last was so heavy I could not hoist it up to get it over 
the ship's side. 

Besides these things, I took all the men's clothes that I could j&nd, 
and a spare fore-top-sail, hammock, and some bedding ; and with this 
I loaded my second raft, and brought them all safe on shore, to my 
very great comfort 

I was under some apprehensions during my absence from the land, 
that at least my provisions might be devoured on shore ; but when I 
came back, I found no sign of any visitor, only there sat a creature like 
a wild cat upon one of the chests, which, when I came towards it, 
ran away a Httle distance, and then stood stilL She sat very composed 
and unconcerned, and looked full in my face, as if she had a mind to 
be acquainted with me. I presented my gun at her, but as she did not 
understand it, she was perfectly unconcerned at it, nor did she oflfer to 
stir away ; upon which I tossed her a bit of biscuit, though by the way 
I was not very free of it, for my store was not great However, I, 
spared her a bit, I say, and she went to it, smelled it, ate it, and 
looked, as pleased, for more ; but I thanked her, and could spare no 
more, so she marched off. 

Having got my second cargo on shore, though I was fain to open the 
barrels of powdery and bring them by parcels (for they were too heavy, 
being large casks), I went to work to make me a little tent with the 
sail and some poles which I cut for that purpose ; and into this tent I 
brought everything that I knew would spoil, either with rain or sun, 



46 The Life and Adventures 

and I piled all the empty chests and casks up in a circle round the tent, 
to fortify it from any sudden attempt, either from man or beast. 

When I had done this, I blocked up the door of the tent with some 
boards within, and an empty chest set up on-end without; and 
spreading one of the beds on the ground, laying my' two pistols just at 
my head, and my gun at length by me, I went to bed for the first time, 
and slept very quietly all night, for I was very weary and heavy ; for 
the night before I had slept little, and had laboured very hard all day, 
as well to fetch all those things from the ship as to get them on shore. 

I had the biggest magazine of all kinds now that ever were laid up, 
I believe, for one man, but I was not satisfied still ; for while the ship 
sat upright in that posture, I thought I ought to get everything out of 
her that I could : so every day at low water I went on board, and 
brought away something or other ; but particularly the third time I 
went, I brought away as much of the rigging as I could, as also all the 
small ropes and rope-twine I could get, with a piece of spare canvas, 
which was to mend the sails upon occasion, and the barrel of wet gun- 
powder. In a word, I brought away all the sails first and last, only that 
I was fain to cut them in pieces, and bring as much at a time as I could ; 
for they were no more useful to be sails, but as mere canvas only. 

But that which comforted me more still, was that, last of all, after 
I had made five or six such voyages as these, and thought I had nothing 
more to expect from the ship that was worth my meddling with ; I say, 
after all this, I found a great hogshead of bread, and three large runlets 
of rum or spirits, and a box of sugar, and a barrel of fine flour. This 
was surprising to me, because I had given over expecting any more 
provisions, except what was spoiled by the water. I soon emptied the 
hogshead of that bread, and wrapped it up, parcel by parcel, in pieces 
of the sails, which I cut out ; and, in a word, I got all this safe on 
shore also. 

The next day I made another voyage ; and now, having plundered 
the ship of what was portable and fit to hand out, I began with the 
cables ; and cutting the great cable into pieces, such as I could move, 
I got two cables and a hawser on shore, with all the iron-work I could 
get ; and having cut down the spritsail-yard, and the mizen-yard, and 
everything I could to make a large raft, I loaded it with all those heavy 
goods and came away. But my good luck began now to leave me ; for 
this raft was so unwieldy and so overladen, that after I had entered the 
little cove, where I had landed the rest of my goods, not being aHe to 
guide it so handily as I did the other, it overset, and threw me dud all 
my cargo into the water. As for myseK it was no great harm, for I 



of Robinson Cnuoe. 47 

was near ihe shore ; but as to my cargo, it was great part of it lost, 
especially the iron, which I expected would have been of great use to 
me. However, when the tide was out, I got most of the pieces of cable 
ashore, and some of the iron, though with infinite labour ; for I was 
fjEdn to dip for it into the water — a work which fatigued me very much. 
After this, I went every day on board and brought away what I 
could get 

I had been now thirteen days on shore, and had been eleven times 
on board the ship, in which time I had brought away all that one pair of 
hands could be well supposed capable to bring; though I believe verily, 
had the calm weather held, I should have brought away the whole ship, 
piece by piece. But preparing the twelfth time to go on board, I found 
the wind begin to rise ; however, at low water I went on board, and 
though I thought I had rummaged the cabin so effectually, as that 
nothing more could be found, yet I discovered a locker with drawers 
in it, in one of which I found two or three razors, and one pair of 
large scissors, with some ten or a dozen of good knives and forks ; in 
another I found about thirty-six pounds value in money, some European 
coin, some Brasil, some pieces of eight, some gold, some silver. 

I smiled to myself at the sight of this money. " Drug ! " said I, 
aloud, " what art thou good for ? thou art not worth to me, no, not the 
taking off the ground. One of these knives is worth all this heap. I 
have no manner of use for thee, even remain where thou art and go to 
the bottom, as a creature whose life is not worth saving." However, 
upon second thoughts, I took it away, and wrapping all this in a piece 
of canvas, I began to think of making another raft ; but while I was 
preparing this, I found the sky over-cast, and the wind began to rise, 
and in a quarter of an hour it blew a fresh gale from the shore. It 
presently occurred to me, that it was in vain to pretend to make a raft 
with the wind off shore, and that it was my business to be gone before 
the tide of flood began, otherwise I might not be able to reach the 
shore at all : accordingly I let myself down into the water, and swam 
across the channel, which lay between the ship and the sands, and even 
that with difl&culty enough, partly with the weight of things I had 
about me, and psuily the roughness of the water ; for the wind rose 
very hastily, and before it was quite high water it blew a storm. 

But I was gotten home to my little tent, where I lay with all my 
wealth about me very secure. It blew very hard all that night ; and 
in the morning when I looked out, behold no more ship was to be 
seen. I was a little surprised, but recovered myself with this satisfactory 
reflection j jiamely, that I had lost no time, nor abated any diligence, to 



48 The Life and Adventures 

get everything out of her tkat could be useful to me ; and that indeed 
there was little left in her that I was able to bring away, if I had had 
more time. 

I now gave over any more thoughts of the ship, or of any thing out 
of her, except what might drive on shore from her wreck, as indeed 
divers pieces of her afterwards did ; but those things were of small 
use to me. 

My thoughts were now wholly employed about securing myself 
against either savages (if any should appear) or wild beasts, if any were 
in the island ; and I had many thoughts of the method how to do this, 
and what kind of dwelling to make ; whether I should make me a 
cave in the earth, or a tent upon the earth ; and, in short, I resolved 
upon both, of the manner, and description of which it may not be 
improper to give an account. 

I soon found the place I was in was not for my settlement, particularly 
because it was upon a low moorish ground near the sea, and I believed 
would not be wholesome, and more particularly because there was no 
fresh water near it, so I resolved to find a more healthy and more 
convenient spot of ground. 

I consulted several things in my situation which I found would be 
proper for me. Health, and fresh water, I just now mentioned ; shelter 
from the heat of the sun ; security from ravenous creatures, whether 
man or beast ; a view to the sea, that if God sent any ship in sight, 
I might not lose any advantage for my deliverance, of which I was 
not willing to banish all my expectation yet. 

In search of a place proper for this, I found a little plain on the side 
of a rising hill, whose front towards this little plain was steep as a 
house-side, so that nothing could come down upon me from the top ; 
on the side of this rock there was a hollow place, worn a little way in, 
like the entrance or door of a cave : but there was not really any cave 
or way into the rock at all. 

On the flat of the green, just before this hollow place, I resolved to 
pitch my tent. This plain was not above an hundred yards broad, and 
about twice as long, and lay like a green before my door, and at the 
end it descended irregularly every way down into the low grounds by 
the sea-side. It was on the N.KW. side of the hill, so that I was 
sheltered from the heat every day, till it came to a W. oad by S. sun, 
or thereabouts, which in those countries is near the setting. 

Before I set up my tent, I drew a half circle before the hoUow place, 
which took in about ten yards in its semi-diameter, from the rock, and 
twenty yards in its diameter^ from its beginning and ending. 



cf Bobinson Orusoe. 49 

In this half dicle I pitched two rows of strong stakes, driving them 
into the ground till thej stood very firm, like piles, the biggest end 




being out of the ground about five foot and a hal^ and sharpened on 
the top ; the two rows did not stand above six inches from one another. 

Then I took the pieces of cable which I had cut in the ship, and laid 
them in rows one upon another, within the circle between these two 
rows of stakes, up to the top, placing other stakes in the inside, leaning 
against them, about two foot and a haK high, like a spur to a post ; 
and this fence was so strong, that neither man nor beast could get into 
it or over it. This cost me a great deal of time and labour, especially to 
cut the piles in the woods, bring them to the place, and drive them into 
the earth. 

The entrance into this place I made to be not by a door, but by a 
short ladder to go over the top ; which ladder, when I was in, I lifted 
over after me : and so I was completely fenced in and fortified, as I 
thought, from all the world, and consequently slept secure in the night, 
which otherwise I could not have done ; though, as it appeared after- 
ward, there was no need of all this caution from the enemies that I 
apprehended danger from. 

Into this fence or fortress, with infinite labour, I carried all my 
riches, all my provisions, ammunition and stores, of which you have 
the account above ; and I made me a large tent, which, to preserve me 
from the rains, that in one part of the year are very violent there, I 
made double, namely, one smaller tent within, and one larger tent above 



50 2^ Life and Adventures 

it, and covered the uppermost with a large tarpaulin which I had sared 
among the sails. 

And now I lay no more for a while in the bed which I had hrooght 
on shore, but in a hammock, which was indeed a yery good one, and 
belonged to the mate of the ship. 

Into this tent I brought all my provisions, and everything that 
would spoil by the wet ; and having thus inclosed all my goods I made 
up the entrance, which till now I had left open, and so passed and 
repassed, as I said, by a short ladder. 

When I had done this, I began to work my way into the rock ; and 
bringing all the earth and stones that I dug down out through my 
tent, I laid them up within my fence in the nature of a terrace, that 
so it raised the ground within about a foot and a half ; and thus I 
made me a cave just behind my tent, which served me like a cellar to 
my house. 

It cost me much labour, and many days, before all these things were 
brought to perfection, and therefore I must go back to some other 
things which took up some of my thoughts. At the same time it 
happened, after I had laid my scheme for the setting up my tent and 
making the cave, that a storm of rain Mling from a thick, dark cloud, 
a sudden flash of lightning happened, and after that a great clap of 
thunder, as is naturally the eflect of it. I was not so much surprised 
with the lightning, as I was with a thought which darted into my 
mind as swift as the lightning itself : my powder ! my very heart 
sunk within me, when I thought, that at one blast all my powder might 
be destroyed ; on which, not my defence only, but the providing me 
food, as I thought, entirely depended. I was nothing near so anxious 
about my own danger, though , had the powder took fire, I had never 
known who had hurt me. 

Such impression did this make upon me, that after the storm was 
over I laid aside all my works, my building, and fortifying, and applied 
myself to make bags and boxes to separate the powder, and to keep it 
a little and a little in a parcel, in hope, that whatever might come, it 
might not all take fire at once ; and to keep it so apart, that it should 
not be possible to make one part fire another. I finished this work in 
about a fortnight ; and I think, my powder, which in all was about 
240 pounds weight, was divided in not less than a hundred parcels. As 
to the barrel that had been wet, I did not apprehend any danger from 
that, so I placed it in my new cave, which in my fancy I called my 
kitchen ; and the rest I hid up and down in holes among the rocks, so 
that no wet might come to it, marking very carefolly where I laid it. 




CRUSOE ENTICING THE KID 



of Bobinson Crusoe. 61 

In the interval of time while this was doing, I went ont once at 
least every day with my gun, as well to divert myself as to see if I conld 
kill anything fit for food, and, as near as I could, to acquaint myself 
with what the island produced. The first time I went out I presently 
discovered that there were goats in the island, which was a great satis- 
faction to me ; hut then it was attended with this misfortune to me, 
namely, that they were so shy, so subtle, and so swift of foot, that it 
was the most difficult thing in the world to come at them. But I 
was not discouraged at this, not doubting but I might now and then 
shoot one, as it soon happened \ for after I had found their haunts a 
little, I laid wait in this manner for them : I observed, if they saw me 
in the valleys, though they were upon the rocks, they would run away 
as in a terrible fright ; but if they were feeding in the valleys, and I 
was upon the rocks, they took no notice of me : from whence I 
concluded, that by the position of their optics, their sight was so 
directed downward, that they did not readily see objects that were 
above them ; so afterward I took this method : I always climbed the 
rocks first, to get above them, and then had frequently a fair mark. 
The first shot I made among these creatures I killed a she-goat, which 
had a little kid by her, which she gave suck to, which grieved me 
heartily j but when the old one fell, the kid stood stock still by her 
till I came and took her up ; and not only so, but when I carried the old 
one with me upon my shoulders, the kid followed me quite to my in- 
closure, upon which I laid down the dam, and took the kid in my arms 
and carried it over my pale, in hopes to have bred it up tame, but it 
would not e^ so I was forced to kill it and eat it myself These two 
supplied me with flesh a great while, for I eat sparingly, and saved my 
provisions (my bread especially) as much as possibly I could. 

Having now fixed my habitation, I found it absolutely necessary to 
provide a place to make a fire in, and fuel to bum ; and what I did 
for that, as also how I enlarged my cave, and what conveniences I made, 
I shall give a full account of in its place ; but I must first give some 
little account of myself, and of my thoughts about living, which it may 
well be supposed were not a few. 

I had a dismal prospect of my condition ; for as I was not cast away 
upon that island without being driven, as is said, by a violent storm 
quite out of the course of our intended voyage, and a great way, 
some hundreds of leagues, out of the ordinary course of the trade of 
mankind, I had great reason to consider it as a determination of Heaven 
that in this desolate place, and in this desolate manner, I should end my 
life. The tears would run plentifully down my face when I made these 

b2 



62 The Idfo and Adventures 

reflections, and sometimes I would expostulate with myself why Pro- 
vidence should thus completely ruin his creatures, and render them so 
absolutely miserable, so without help abandoned, so entirely depressed, 
that it could hardly be rational to be thankful for such a Hfe. 

But something always returned swift upon me to check these thoughts 
and to reprove me ; and particularly one day, walking with my gun in 
my hand by the sea-side, I was very pensive upon the subject of my 
present condition, when reason as it were expostulated with me the other 
way, thus : Well, you are in a desolate condition, it is true ; but pray 
remember, where are the rest of you ? Did not you come eleven of you 
into the boat ? Where are the ten ? Why were they not saved and you 
lost ] Why were you singled out 1 Is it better to be here or there ] and 
then I pointed to the sea. All evils are to be considered with the good 
that is in them, and with what worse attends them. 

Then it occurred to me again, how well I was furnished for my sub- 
sistence, and what would have been my case if it had not happened, 
which was a hundred thousand to one, that the ship floated from the 
place where she first struck, and was driven so near the shore that I 
had time to get all these things out of her 1 What would have been my 
case if I had been to have hved in the condition in which I at first 
came on shore, without necessaries of life or necessaries to supply and 
procure them? Particularly, said I aloud (though to myself), what 
should I have done without a gun, without ammunition, without any 
tools to make anything, or to work with ; without clothes, bedding, a 
tent, or any manner of covering ? And that now I had all these to a 
sufficient quantity, and was in a fair way to provide mys«lf in such a 
manner, as to live without my gun when my ammunition was spent, so 
that I had a tolerable view of subsisting, without any want, as long as T 
lived ; for I considered from the beginning how I should provide for 
the accidents that might happen and for the time that was to come, 
even not only after my ammunition should be spent, but even after my 
health or strength should decay. 

I confess I had not entertained any notion of my ammunition being 
destroyed at one blast, I mean, my powder being blown up by lightning ; 
and this made the thoughts of it so suprising to me when it lightened 
and thundered, as I observed just now. 

And now being about to enter into a melancholy relation of a scene 
of silent life, such, perhaps, as was never heard of in the world before, 
I shall take it from its beginning, and contmue it in its order. It was, 
by my account, the 30th of September, when, in the manner as above 
said, I fiirst set foot upon this horrid island, when the sun being, to us, 



of Robinson Crusoe. 63 

in its autamnal eqninox, was almost just over my head ; for I reckoned 
myself by observation, to be in the latitude of 9 degrees and 22 minutes 
north of the line. 

After I had been there about ten or twelve days, it came into my 
thoughts that I should lose my reckoning of time for want of books, 
and pen and ink, and should even forget the Sabbath days from the 
working days j but to prevent this, I cut it with my knife upon a large 
post in capital letters, and making it into a great cross, I set it up on 




the shore where I first landed, namely, I came on shore here on the 
30th of sept. 1659. Upon the sides of this square post I cut every 
day a notch with my knife, and every seventh notch was as long again 
as the rest, and every first day of the month as long again as that long 
one ; and thus I kept my calendar, or weekly, monthly, and yearly 
reckoning of time. 

In the next place we are to observe, that among the many things 
which T brought out of the ship in the several voyages, which, as 
above mentioned, I made to it, I got several things of less value, but 
not aU less useful to me, which I omitted setting down before ; as in 
particular, pens, ink, and paper; several parcels in the captain's, mate's, 
gunner's, and carpenter's keeping ; three or four compasses, some 
mathematical instruments, dials, perspective glasses, charts, and books 
of navigation ; aU which I huddled together, whether I might want 
them or no ; also, I found three very good bibles which came to me in 
my cargo from England, and which I had packed up among my things ; 
some Portuguese books also, and among them two or three popish 
prayeiubooks, and several other books, all which I carefully secured. 



54 The Life and Adventures 

And I must not forget, that we had in the ship a dog and two cats, of 
whose eminent history I may have occasion to say something in its 
place ; for I carried both the cats with me ; and as for the dog, he 
jumped out of the ship of himself and swam on shore to me the day 
after I went on shore with my first cargo, and was a trusty servant to 
me many years. I wanted nothing that he could fetch me, or any 
company that he could make up to me ; I only wanted to have hJTn 
talk to me, but that he could not do. As I observed before, I found 
pen, ink, and paper, and I husbanded them to the utmost ; and I shall 
show, that while my ink lasted, I kept things very exact ; but after that 
was gone I could not, for I could not make any ink, by any means that 
I could devise. 

And this put me in mind that I wanted many things, notwithstand- 
ing all that I had amassed together ; and of these this of ink was one, 
as also spade, pick-axe, and shovel, to dig or remove the earth; needles, 
pins, and thread ; as for linen, I soon learned to want that without 
much difficulty. 

This want of tools made every work I did go on heavily, and it 
was near a whole year before I had entirely finished my little pale or 
surrounded habitation. The piles or stakes, which were as heavy as I 
could well lift, were a long time in cutting and preparing in the woods, 
and more by far in bringing home ; so that I spent sometimes two days 
in cutting and bringing home one of those posts, and a third day in 
driving it into the ground ; for which purpose I got a heavy piece of 
wood at first, but at last bethought myself of one of the iron crows, 
which, however, though I found it, yet it made driving those posts or 
piles very laborious and tedious work. 

But what need I have been concerned at the tediousness of anything 
I had to do, seeing I had time enough to do it in, nor had I any other 
employment if that had been over, at least, that I could foresee, . 
except the ranging the island to seek for food, which I did more or less 
every day, 

I have already described my habitation, which was a tent under the 
side of a rock, surrounded with a strong pale of posts and cables, but I 
might now rather call it a wall, for I raised a kind of wall up against 
it of turfs, about two feet thick on the outside, and after some time, T 
think it was a year and a hal^ I raised rafters from it, leaning to the 
rock, and thatched or covered it with boughs of trees, and such things 
as I could get to keep out the rain, which I found at some times of the 
year very violent 

I have already observed how I brought all my goods into this pale, 




FELLING TREES FOR PLANKS 



cf Bobinami Ortuoe. 56 

and into the cave which I had made behind me ; but I must observe 
too, that at first this was a confused heap of goods, which, as they lay 
in no order, so they took up all my place, I had no room to turn my- 
self ; 80 I set myself to enlarge my cave and works farther into the 
earth; for it was a loose, sandy rocl^ which yielded easily to the labour 
I bestowed on it And so when I found I was pretty safe as to beasts 
of prey, I worked sideways to the right hand into the rock ; and then 
turning to the right again, worked quite out, and made me a door to 
come out, on the outside of my pale or fortification. 

This gave me not only egress and regress, as it were a backway to 
my tent and to my storehouse, but gave me room to stow my goods. 

And now I began to apply myoelf to make such necessaiy things as 
I found I most wanted, as particularly a chair and a table ; for without 
these I was not able to enjoy the few comforts I had in the world. I 
could not write or eat, or do several things with so much pleasure 
without a table. 

So I went to work ; and here I must needs observe, that as reason 
is the substance and original of the mathematics, so by stating and 
squaring everything by reason, and by making the most rational judg- 
ment of things, every man may be in time master of every mechanic 
art I had never handled a tool in my life, and yet in time by labour, 
application, aud contrivance, I found at last that I wanted nothing but 
I could have made it^ especially if I had had tools ; however, I made 
abundance of things, even without tools, and some with no more tools 
than an adze and a hatchet, which, perhaps, were never made that way 
before, and that with infinite labour; for example, if I wanted a board, 
I had no other way but to cut down a tree, set it on a hedge before ma^ 
and hew it flat on either side with my axe, till I had brought it to be 
as thin as a plank, and then dub it smooth with my adze. It is true^ 
by this method I could make but one board out of a whole tree, but 
this I had no remedy for but patience, any more than I had for the 
prodigious deal of time and labour which it took me up to make a plank 
or board ; but my time or labour was little worth, and so it was as well 
employed one way as another. 

However, I made me a table and a chair, as I observed above, in the 
first place, and this I did out of the short pieces of boards which I 
brought on my raft from the ship ; but when I had wrought out some 
boards, as above, I made large shelves, of the breadth of a foot and a 
half, one over another, all along one side of my cave, to lay all my 
tools, nails, and iron-work, and in a word, to separate everything at 
large in their places, that I might come easily at them. I knocked 



56 The Life and Adventures 

pieces into the wall of the rock to hang my guns and all things that 
would hang up. 

So that had my cave heen to be seen, it looked like a general magazine 
of all necessary things ; and I had everything so ready at my hand, 
that it was a great pleasure to me to see all my goods in such order, 
and especially to find my stock of all necessaries so great. 

And now it was that I began to keep a journal of every day's 
employment ; for indeed at first I was in too much hurry, and not only 
hurry as to labour, but in too much discomposure of mind, and my 
journal would have been full of many dull things. 

I shall here give you the copy (though in it will be told many 
particulars over again) as long as it lasted \ for having no more ink, I 
was forced to leave it oft 



THE JOUENAL. 

Sept. 30, 1659. I, poor, miserable Robinson Crusoe, being ship- 
wrecked, during a dreadfal storm, in the ofl&ng, came on shore on 
this dismal, unfortunate island, which I called the Island of Despair, 
all the rest of the ship's company being drowned, and myself almost 
dead. 

All the rest of that day I spent in afflicting myself, at the dismal 
circumstances I was brought to, namely, I had neither food, house, 
clothes, weapon, nor place to fly to, and in despair of any relief saw 
nothing but death before me, either that I should be devoured by wild 
beasts, murdered by savages, or starved to death for want of food. 
At the approach of night I slept in a tree, for fear of wild creatures, 
but slept soundly though it rained all night. 

October 1. In the morning I saw, to my great surprise, the ship had 
floated with the high tide, and was driven on shore again much nearer 
the island, which as it was some comfort on one hand, for seeing her 
sit upright, and not broken to pieces, I hoped, if the wind abated, I 
might get on board, and get some food or necessaries out of her for my 
relief ; so, on the other hand, it renewed my grief at the loss of my 
comrades, who I imagined if we had all stayed on board might have saved 
the ship, or at least that they would not have been all drowned, as they 
were ; and that, had the men been saved, we might perhaps have built 
us a boat out of the ruins of the ship, to have carried us to some other 
part of the world. I spent great part of this day in perplexing 
myself on these things ; but at length, seeing the ship almost dry, I 



cff Bohinaan OruBoe. 67 

went upon the sand as near as I could, and then swam on board : this 
day also it continued raining, though with no wind at all 

From the 1st of October to the 24th. All these days entirely spent 
in making several voyages to get all I could out of the ship, which I 
brought on shore, every tide of flood, upon rafts. Much rain also in 
these days, though with some intervals of fair weather : but, it seems, 
this was the rainy season. 

Oct. 20. I overset my raft, and all the goods I had got upon it; but 
being in shoal water, and the things being chiefly heavy, I recovered 
many of them when the tide was out 

Oct, 26. It rained all night and all day, with some gusts of wind, 
during which time the ship broke in pieces, the wind blowing a little 
harder than before, and was no more to be seen, except the wreck of 
her, and that only at low water. I spent this day in covering and 
securing the goods which I had saved, that the rain might not spoil 
them. 

Oct. 2^. I walked about the shore almost all day, to find out a 
place to fix my habitation, greatly concerned to secure myself from any 
attack in the night, either from wild beasts or men. Towards night I 
fixed upon a proper place under a rock, and marked out a semicircle 
for my encampment, which I resolved to strengthen with a work, wall, 
or fortification made of double piles, lined within with cables, and 
without with turf. 

From the 26th to the 30th, I worked very hard in carrying all my 
goods to my new habitation, though some part of the time it rained 
exceeding hard. 

The Slst, in the morning, I went out into the island with my gun, 
to see for some food, and discover the country, when I killed a she- 
goat^ and her kid followed me home ; which I afterwards killed also, 
because it would not feed. 

November 1. I set up my tent under a rock, and lay there for the 
first nighty making it as large as I could with stakes driven in to swing 
my hammock upon. 

Nov, 2, I set up all my chests and boards, and the pieces of timber 
which made my rafts, and with them formed a fence round me, a little 
within the place I had marked out for my fortification. 

Nov. 3. I went out with my gun, and killed two fowls like ducks, 
which were very good food. In the afternoon went to work to make 
me a table. 

Nov. 4. This morning I began to order my times of work, of going 
out with my gun, time of sleep^ and time of diversion. Every morning 



58 The Lifo and Adventwre$ 

I walked out with my gnn for two or three honiSy if it did not rain, 
then employed myself to work till about eleven o'clock, then eat what 
I had to live on, and firom twelve to two I lay down to sleep, the weather 
being excessive hot^ and then in the evening to woi^ again. The 




working part of this day, and of the next, were wholly employed in 
making my table, for I was yet but a very sorry workman, ihough time 
and necessity made me a complete natural mechanic soon after, as I 
believe it would do any one else. 

I^ov. 5. This day went abroad with my gun and my dog, and killed 
a wild cat ; her skin pretty soft, but her flesh good for nothing : every 
creature I killed I took off the skins and preserved them. Coming 
back by the sea-shore I saw many sorts of sea-fowls, which I did not 
understand ; but was surprised and almost frighted with two or three 
seals, which, while I was gazing at, not well knowing what they were, 
got into the sea, and escaped me for that time. 

iVW. 6. After my morning walk I went to work with my table 
again, and finished it, though not to my liking ; nor was it long before 
I learned to mend it 

iTov. 7. Now it began to be settled fair weather. The 7th, 8th, 9th, 
10th, and part of the 12th (for the 11th was Sunday) I took wholly up 
to make me a chair, and with much ado brought it to a tolerable 
shape, but never to please me ; and even in the making I pulled 
it in pieces several times. I^ote, — I soon . neglected my keeping 
Sundays, for omitting my mark for them on my post, I forgot which 
was which. 



cf Bobtnaon Crusoe* 69 

iTov. 13. This day it rained, which refreshed me exceedingly, and 
cooled the earth ; but it was accompanied with terrible thunder and 
lightning, which frighted me dreadfully for fear of my powder. As 
soon as it was over I resolved to separate my stock of powder into as 
many little parcels as possible, that it might not be in danger. 

J^ov. 14, 15, 16. These three days I spent in making little square 
chests or boxes, which might hold about a pound, or two pounds at 
most, of powder ; and so putting the powder in, I stowed it in places 
as secure and remote from one another as possible. On one of these 
three days I killed a large bird that was good to eat^ but I know not 
what to call it. 

i\r<w. 17. This day I began to dig behind my tent into the rock, to 
make room for my farther conveniency. lifote. Three things I wanted ex- 
ceedingly for this work, namely, a pick-axe, a shovel, and a wheel-barrow 
or basket, so I desisted from my work, and began to consider how to 
supply that want, and make me some tools. As for a pick-axe, I made 
use of the iron crows, which were proper enough, though heavy ; but the 
next thing was a shovel or spade. This was so absolutely necessary, 
that indeed I could do nothing effectually without it ; but what kind 
of one to make I knew not. 

lifov, 18. The next day, in searching the woods, I found a tree of that 
wood, or like it, which in the Brasils they call the Iron Tree, for its 
exceeding hardness ; of this, with great labour and almost spoiling my 
axe, I cut a piece and brought it home too with diffculty enough, for it 
was exceeding heavy. 

The excessive hardness of the wood, and having no other way, made 
me a long while upon this machine ; for I worked it effectually by 
little and little into the form of a shovel or spade, the handle exactly 
shaped like ours in England, only that the broad part having no iron 
shod upon it at bottom, it would not last me so long ; however, it 
served well enough for the uses which I had occasion to put it to ; but 
never was a shovel, I believe, made after that fashion, or so long a 
making. 

I was still deficient, for I wanted a basket or a wheel-barrow. A 
basket I could not make by any means, having no such things as twigs 
that would bend to make wicker ware, at least none yet found out ; 
and as to a wheel-barrow, I fancied I could make all but the wheel, 
but that I had no notion of, neither did I know how to go about it j 
besides, I had no possible way to make the iron gudgeons for the 
spindle or axis of the wheel to run in, so I gave it over ; and so for 
carrying away the earth which I dug out of the cave, I made me 



60 IHe lifk and Advmtmt» 

ft thing like a hod which the labooien cany mortar in, ivhen they 
senre the bncklayers. 

This was not so difficult to me as the malnTtg the shovel ; and yet 
this, and the shovel, and the attempt which I made in vain to make 
a wheel-barrow, took me np no less than fonr da^-s, I mean always 
excepting my morning walk with my gun, which I seldom hauled ; and 
very seldom £uled also bringing home something to eat 

Nov. 23. My other work having now stood still, becatise of my 
making these tools, when they were finished I went on, and working 
every day, as my strength and time allowed, I spent eighteen days 
entirely in widening and deepening my cave, that it might hold my 
goods commodioosly. 

Note. Daring aU this time, I worked to make this room or cave 
spacious enough to accommodate me as a warehouse or magazine, a 
kitchen, a dining-room, and a cellar ; as for my lodging, I kept to the 
tent, except that sometimes in the wet season of the year, it rained so 
hard that I conld not keep myself dry, which caused me afterwards to 
cover all my place within my pale with long poles in the form of rafters, 
leaning against the rock, and load them with flags and large leaves of 
trees like a thatck 

Decemher 10. I began now to think my cave or vault finished, when 
on a sudden (it seems I had made it too large) a great quantity of earth 
fell down from the top and one side, so much, that in short it frighted 
me, and not without reason too; for if I had been under it, I had never 
wanted a grave-digger. Upon this disaster I had a great deal of work 
to do over again ; for I had the loose earth to carry out, and, which 
was of more importance, I had the ceiling to prop up, so that I might 
be sure no more would come down. 

Dec. 11. This day I went to work with it accordingly, and got two 
shores or posts pitched upright to the top, with two pieces of boards 
across over each post ; this I finished the next day, and setting more 
posts up with boards, in about a week more I had the roof secured ; 
and the posts, standing in rows, served me for partitions to part off 
my house. 

Dec. 17. From this day to the twentieth I placed shelves, and knocked 
up nails on the posts to hang everything up that could be hung up ; 
and now T began to be in some order within doors. 

Dec. 20. Now I carried everything into the cave, and began to 
furnish my house, and set up some pieces of boards, like a dresser, to 
order my victuals upon ; but boards began to be very scarce with me ; 
also, I made me another table.

Dee. 24. Much rain all night and all day ; no stirring out 

Dec 25. Eain all day. 

Dec 26. No rain; and the earth much cooler than before, and 
pleasanter. 

Dec. 27. Killed a young goat, and lamed another, so that I caught 
it, and led it home in a string ; when I had it home, I bound and 
splintered up its leg, which was broke. N.B. I took such care of it, 
that it lived, and the leg grew well and as strong as ever ; but by nursing 
it so long it grew tame, and fed upon the little green at my door, and 
would not go away. This was the first time that I entertained a thought 
of breeding up some tame creatures, that I might have food -vfhen my 
powder and shot was all spent. 

Dec. 28, 29, 30. Great heats and no breeze, so that there was no 
stirring abroad, except in the evening for food ; this time I spent in 
putting all my things in order within doors. 

January 1. Yery hot still, but I went abroad early and late with 
my gun, and lay still in the middle of the day. This evening, going 
farther into the valleys, which lay towards the centre of the island, I 
found there was plenty of goats, though exceeding shy and hard to 
come at; however, I resolved to try if I could not bring my dog 
to hunt them down. 

Jan. 2. Accordingly, the next day, I went out with my dog, and 
set l^im upon the goats ; but I was mistaken, for they all faced about 
upon the dog; and he knew his danger too well, for he would not 
come near them. 




Jan. 3. I began my fence or wall ; which, being still jealous of my 
being attacked by somebody, I resolved to make very thick and strong 



62 T%e Lift amd Adventmres 

N.B, Hub wall being described befoie, I purposely omit wLat was 
said in the JoumaL It \a sufficient to obseire, that I was no leas 
time than from the 3d of January to the 14th of Aprils working 
finiKTiing^ and perfecting this wall, though it was no more than about 
twentj-four yards in length, being a half circle from one place in the 
rock to another place about eight yards from it ; the door of the cave 
being in the centre behind it. 

All tTiia time I worked Tery hard, the rains hindering me many 
days, nay, sometimes weeks together ; but I thought I should never be 
perfectly secure until this wall was finished ; and it is scarce credible 
what inexpressible labour everything was done with, especially the 
bringing piles out of the woods, and driving them into the ground, for 
I made them much bigger than I need to have done. 

When this wall was finished, and the outside double fence witii 
a turf-wall raised up close to it, I persuaded myself that if any people 
were to come on shore there, they would not perceive anything like a 
habitation ; and it was very well I did so, as may be observed here- 
after upon a very remarkable occasion. 

During this time I made my rounds in the woods for game every 
day, when the rain permitted me, and made fi^uent discoveries in 
these walks of something or other to my advantage ; particularly I 
found a kind of wild pigeons, who built not as wood pigeons, in a 
tree, but rather as house pigeons, in the holes of the rocks ; and taking 
some young ones, I endeavoured to breed them up tame, and did so ; 
but when they grew older they flew away, which perhaps was at first 
for want of feeding them, for I had nothiag to give them ; however, I 
frequently foimd their nests, and got their young ones, which were 
very good meat 

And now, in the managing my household affairs, I found myself 
wanting in many things, which I thought at first it was impossible for 
me to make, as indeed, as to some of them, it was ; for iostance, I 
could never make a cask to be hooped. I had a small runlet or two, 
as I observed before, but I could never arrive to the capacity of 
making one by them, though I spent many weeks about it ; I could 
neither put in the heads, or joint the staves so true to one another as 
to make them hold water, so I gave that also over. 

In the next place, I was at a great loss for candle ; so that as soon 
as ever it was dark, which was generally by seven o'clock, I was 
obliged to go to bed. I remembered the lump of bees-wax with 
which I made candles in my African adventure, but I had none of 
that now ; the only remedy I had was, that when I had killed a goat 




CRUSOE SURPRISED AT THE BARLEY GROWING. 



cf BdbinBcn Crusoe. 63 

I saved the tallow, and with a little dish made of clay, which I baked 
in the sun, to which I added a wick of some oakum, I made me 
a lamp ; and this gave me light, though not a clear, steady light like a 
candle. In the middle of all my labours it happened, that rummaging 
my things, I found a little bag, which, as I hinted before, had been 
filled with com for the feeding of poultry, not for this voyage, but 
before, as I suppose, when the ship came from Lisbon ; what little 
remainder of com had been in the bag, was all devoured with the 
rats, and I saw nothing in the bag but husks and dust; and being 
wQling to have the hsug for some other use, I think it was to put 
powder in, when I divided it for fear of the lightning, or some such 
use^ I shook the husks of com out of it on one side of my fortification 
mider the rock. 

It was a little before the great rains, just now mentioned, that 
I threw this stuff away, taking no notice of anything, and not so 
much as remembering tJiat I had thrown anything there ; when about 
a month after, or thereabouts, I saw some few stalks of something 
green shooting out of the ground, which I fancied might be some 
plant I had not seen ; but I was surprised and perfectly astomshed, 
when after a little longer time I saw about ten or twelve ears come out, 
which were perfect green barley of the same kind as our European, 
nay, as our English barley. 

It is impossible to express the astonishment and confusion of my 
thoughts on this occasion. I had hitherto acted upon no religious 
foundation at all ; indeed, I had very few notions of religion in my 
head, or had entertained any sense of anything that had befallen me, 
otherwise than as a chance, or, as we lightly say, what pleases GrOD ; 
without so much as inquiring into the end of Providence in these 
things, or his order in governing events in the world ; but after I saw 
barley grow there, in a climate which I knew was not proper for com, 
and especially that I knew not how it came there, it startled me 
strangely ; and I began to suggest, that God had miraculously caused 
this grain to grow without any help of seed sown, and that it was so 
directed purely for my sustenance on that wild, miserable placa 

This touched my heart a little, and brought tears out of my eyes, and 
I began to bless myself, that such a prodigy of nature should happen 
upon my account ; and this was the more strange to me, because I saw 
near it still, all along by the side of the rock, some other straggling 
stalks, which proved to be stalks of rice, and which I knew, because I 
had seen it grow in Africa, when I was ashore there. 

I not only thought these the pure productions of Providence for my 



64 ThA Life and Adventures 

support, but not doubting but that there was more in the place, I went 
all over that part of the island, where I had been before, peeping in 
every comer and under every rock to see for more of it, but I could 
not find any ; at last it occured to my thought, that I had shook a bag 
of chickens' meat out in that place, and then the wonder began to 
cease. And I must confess, my religious thankfulness to Gk>D'8 
providence began to abate too, upon discovering that all this was 
nothing but what was common; though I ought to have been as 
thankful for so strange and unforeseen a providence as if it had been 
miraculous ; for it was really the work of Providence as to me, that 
should order or appoint ten or twelve grains of com to remain Tin- 
spoiled, when the rats had destroyed aU the rest, as if it had been 
dropped from heaven ; as also, that I should throw it out in that par- 
ticular place, where, it being in the shade of a high rock, it sprang up 
immediately ; whereas, if I had thrown it anywhere else at that time, 
it had been burnt up and destroyed. 

I carefully saved the ears of this com, you may be sure, in their 
season, which was about the end of June, and laying up every com, I 
resolved to sow them all again, hoping in time to have some quantity 
sufficient to supply me with bread ; but it was not till the fourth year 
that I could allow myself the least grain of this corn to eat, and even 
then but sparingly, as I shall say afterwards in its order ; for I lost all 
that I sowed the first season, by not observing the proper time ; for I 
sowed it just before the dry season, so that it never came up at all, at 
least, not as it would have done : of which in its place. 

Besides this barley, there were, as above, twenty or thirty stalks of 
rice, which I preserved with the same care, and whose use was of the 
same kind or to the same purpose, namely, to make me bread, or 
rather food ; for I found ways to cook it up without baking, though 
I did that also after some time. But to return to my journal 

I worked excessive hard these three or four months to get my wall 
done ; and the 14th of April I closed it up, contriving to go into it 
not by a door, but over the wall by a ladder, that there might be no 
sign in the outside of my habitation. 

ApHl 16. I finished the ladder, so I went up with the ladder to the 
top, and then pulled it up after me, and let it down on the inside. This 
was a complete inclosure to me ; for within I had room enough, and 
nothing could come at me from without, unless it could first mount 
my walL 

The very next day after this wall was finished, I had almost had all 
my labour overthrown at once, and myseK killed. The case was thus, 



of Bobin8on Crusoe. 65 

As I was busy in the inside of it, behind my tent, just in the entrance 
into my cave, I was terribly frighted with a most dreadful surprising 
thing indeed ; for on a sudden I fouud the earth come crumbling down 
from, the roof of my cave, and from the edge of the hill, over my head^ 
and two of the posts I had set up in the cave cracked in a frightful 
manner. I was heartily scared, but thought nothing of what was really 
the cause, only thinking that the top of my cave was falling in, as some 
of it had done before ; and, for fear I should be buried in it, I ran 
forward to my ladder ; and not thinking myself safe there neither, I 
got over my wall for fear of the pieces of tie hill which I expected 
might roll down upon me. I was no sooner stepped down upon the 
firm ground, but I plainly saw it was a terrible earthquake, for the 
ground I stood on shook three times at about eight minutes' distance, 
with three such shocks as would have overturned the strongest building 
that could be supposed to have stood on the earth ; and a great piece 
of the top of a rock, which stood about half a mile from me next the 
sea, fell down with such a terrible noise as I never heard in all my 
life. I perceived also the very sea was put into violent motion by it ; 
and I believe the shocks were stronger under the water than on the 
island. 

I was so amazed with the thing itself having never felt the like, or 
discoursed with any one that had, that I was like one dead or stupified ; 
and the motion of the earth made my stomach sick, like one that was 
tossed at sea. But the noise of the falling of the rock awaked me, as it 
were, and rousing me from the stupified condition I was in, filled me 
with horror, and I thought of nothing then but the hill falling upon 
my tent, and all my household goods, and burying all at once ; and this 
sunk my very soul within me a second time. 

After the third shock was over, and I felt no more for some time, I 
began to take courage, and yet I had not heart enough to get over my 
waU. again, for fear of being buried alive, but sat still upon the ground, 
greatly cast down and disconsolate, not knowing what to do. All this 
while I had not the least serious religious thought, nothing but the 
common, "Lord, have mercy upon me;" and when it was over, that 
went away too. 

While I sat thus, I found the air overcast, and grow cloudy, as if it 
would rain ; soon after that the wind rose by little and little, so that 
in less than half an hour it blew a most dreadful hurricane. The sea 
was all on a sudden covered over with foam and froth, the shore was 
covered with the breach of the water, the trees were torn up by the 
roots, and a terrible storm it was ; and this held about thxee hours^ 



66 The Life and Adventures 

and then b^an to abate, and in two horns more it was stark calm, and 
b^an to rain very hard. 

All this while I sat upon the gronnd, veiy much terrified and dejected, 
when on a sudden it came into my thoughts, that these winds and rain 
being the consequences of the earthquake, the earthquake itself was 
spent and bver, and I might venture into my cave again. With this 
thought my spirits began to reviye, and the rain also helping to persuade 
me, I went in and sat down in my tent, but the rain was so violent, 
that my tent was ready to be beaten down with it ; and I was forced 
to go into my cave, though very much afraid and uneasy, for fear it 
should fall on my head. 

This violent rain forced me to a new work, namely to cut a hole 
through my new fortification like a sink to let water go out, which 
would else have drowned my cave. After I had been in my cave some 
time, and found still no more shocks of the earthquake foUow, I b^an 
to be more composed. And now, to support my spirits, which indeed 
wanted it very much, I went to my little store, and took a small sup 
of rum, which however I did then, and always, very sparingly, knowing 
I could have no more when that was gone. 

It continued raining all that night, and great part of the next day, 
so that I could not stir abroad ; but my mind being more composed, 
I began to think of what I had best do, concluding, that if the island 
was subjcet to these earthquakes, there would be no living for me in a 
cave, but I must consider of building me some little hut in an open 
place, which I might surround with a wall as I had done here, and so 
make myself secure from wild beasts or men : but concluded if I staid 
where I was, I should certainly, one time or other, be buried alive. 

"With these thoughts I resolved to remove my tent from the place 
where it stood, which was just under the hanging precipice of the hill^ 
and which, if it should be shaken again, would certainly fedl upon my 
tent. And I spent the next two days, being the 19th and 20th of 
April, in contriving where and how to remove my habitation. 

The fear of being swallowed up alive, made me that I never slept in 
quiet : and yet the apprehension of lying abroad, without any fence, 
was almost equal to it ; but still, when I looked about and saw how 
everything was put in order, how pleasantly concealed 1 was, and how 
safe from danger, it made me very loth to remove. 

In the mean time it occurred to me that it would require a vast deal' 
of time for me to do this, and that I must be contented to, run the 
venture where I was, till I had formed a camp for myself and had 
secured it so ^ to remove to it ; so with this resolution I composed

myself for a time, and resolTed that I would go to woik with all speed 
to hoUd me a wall with piles and cables, in a circle as before ; and set 
my tent up in it when it was finished, but that I would venture to 
stay where I was till it was finished and fit to remove to. This 
was the 21st 

April 22. The next morning I began to consider of means to put 
this resolve in execution, but I was at a great loss about my tods ; I 
had three large axes and abundance of hatchets (for we carried the 
hatchets for traffic with the Indians), but with much chopping and 
cutfdng knotty hard wood, they were all fall of notches and dull, and 
though I had a grind-stone, I could not turn it and grind my tools too : 
this cost me as much thought as a statesman would have bestowed upon 
a grand point of politics, or a judge upon the life and death of a man. 
At length I contrived a wheel with a string, to turn it with my foot. 




that I might have both my hands at liberty. I had never seen any 
sach tlnng in England, or at least not to take notice how it was done, 
though since I have observed it is very common there ; besides that, 
my grind-stone was very large and heavy. This machine cost me a full 
week's work to bring it to perfection.

tools^ my machine for turning my grind-stone performing very welL

of my employment, to be when the tide was up, that I might be ready 
when it was ebbed out ; and by this time I had gotten timber, and 
plank, and iron-work enough to have built a good boat, if I had known 
how; and also, I got at several times, and in several pieces, near a 
hundred weight of the sheet-lead. 

June 16. Groing down to the sea-side, I found a large tortoise or 
turtle j this was the first I had seen, which it seems was only my mis- 




fortune, not any defect of the place, or scarcity; for had I happened to 
be on the other side of the island, I might have had hundreds of them 
every day ; as I found afterw^ards ; but perhaps had paid dear enough 
for them. 

June 17. I spent in cooking the turtle. I found in her threescore 
eggs ; and her flesh was to me at that time the most savoury and 
pleasant that ever I tasted in my life, having had no flesh, but of goats 
and fowls, since I landed in this horrid place. 

June 18. Eained all day, and I stayed within. I thought at this 
time the rain felt cold, and I was something chilly, which I knew was 
not usual in that latitude. 

June 19. Very ill, and shivering, as if the weather had been cold. 

June 20. No rest all night, violent pains in my head, and feverish. 

June 21. Very ill, frighted almost to death with the apprehensions 
of my sad condition, to be sick and no help. Prayed to God for the 
first time since the storm off Hull, but scarce knew what I said, or 
why; my thoughts being all confused. 

June 22. A little better, but imder dreadful apprehensions of 
sickness. 




crusok's dream 



of Robinson Crusoe, 71 

June 23. Very bad again, cold and shivering, and then a violent 
head-acL 

June 24. Much better. 

June 25. An ague very violent ; the fit held me seven hours, cold 
fit and hot, with faint sweats after it 

June 26. Better ; and having no victuals to eat, took my gun, but 
found myself very weak ; however, I killed a she-goat, and with much 
difficulty got it home, and broiled some of it, and ate ; I would fain 
have stewed it, and made some broth, but had no pot. 

June 27. The ague again so violent, that 1 lay a-bed all day, and 
neither eat or drank. I was ready to perish for thirst, but so weak I 
had not strength to stand up, or to get myself any water to drink. 
Prayed to God again, but was light-headed; and when I was not, I was 
80 ignorant that I knew not what to say ; only I lay and cried. Lord, 
look upon me; Lord, pity me; Lord, have mercy upon me. I suppose 
I did nothing else for two or three hours, till the fit wearing ofl^ I fell 
asleep, and did not wake till far in the night ; when I waked 1 found 
myself much refreshed, but weak and exceeding thirsty : however, as 
I had no water in my whole habitation, I was forced to lie till morning, 
and went to sleep again. In this second sleep I had this terrible dream. 

I thought that I was sitting on the ground on the outside of my 
wall, where I sat when the storm blew after the earthquake, and that 
I saw a man descend from a great black cloud, in a bright flame of fire, 
and alight upon the ground. He was all over as bright as a flame^ so 
that I could but just bear to look towards him ; his countenance was 
most inexpressibly dreadful, impossible for words to describe; when 
he stepped upon the ground with his feet I thought the earth trembled 
just as it had done before in the earthquake, and all the air looked to 
my apprehension as if it had been filled with flashes of fire. 

He was no sooner landed upon the earth, but he moved forward 
toward me, with a long spear or weapon in his hand to kill me ; and 
when he came to a rising ground, at some distance, he spoke to me, or 
I heard a voice so terrible, that it is impossible to express the terror of 
it ; all that I can say I understood was this, " Seeing all these things 
have not brought thee to repentance, now thou shalt die ;" at which 
words I thought he lifted up the spear that was in his hand to kill me. 

No one, that shall ever read this account, will expect that I should 
be able to describe the horrors of my soul at this terrible vision ; I 
mean, that even while it was a dream, I even dreamed of those horrors ; 
nor is it any more possible to describe the impression that remained 
upon my mind, when I awaked, and found it was but a dream. 



72 The Life and Adventures 

June 28. HaTing been somewhat refreshed with the sleep I had had, 
and the fit being entirely off, I got up ; and though the fright and 
terror of my dream was very great, yet I considered, that the fit of the 
ague would return again next day, and now was my time to get some- 
thing to refresh and support myself when I should be ilL And the 
first thing I did, I filled a large square case-bottle with water, and set 
it upon my table, in reach of my bed ; and to take off the chill or 
aguish disposition of the water, I put about a quarter of a pint of rum 
into it, and mixed them together. Then I got me a piece of the goat's 
flesh, and broiled it on the coals, but could eat very little. I walked 
about, but was very weak, and withal, very sad and heavy-hearted 
under a sense of my miserable condition, dreading the return of my 
distemper the next day. At night I made my supper of three of the 
turtle's eggs, which I roasted in the ashes, and eat, as we call it, in the 
shell; and this was the first bit of meat I had ever asked God's 
blessing to, even, as I could remember, in my whole life. 

After I had eaten I tried to walk ; but found myself so weak, that I 
could hardly carry the gun (for I never went out without that); so I 
went but a little way, and sat down upon the ground, looking out upon 
the sea, which was just before me, and very calm and smooth. 

I rose up pensive and sad, walked back to my retreat, and went up 
over my wall, as if I had been going to bed ; but my thoughts were 
sadly disturbed, and I had no inclination to sleep ; so 1 sat down in 
my chair, and lighted my lamp, for it began to be dark. Now as the 
apprehension of the return of my distemper terrified me very much, it 
occurred to my thought, that the Brasilians take no physic but their 
tobacco, for almost all distempers ; and I had a piece of a roll of 
tobacco in one of the chests, which was quite cured, and some also that 
was green, and not quite cured. 

I went, directed by Heaven, no doubt ! for in this chest I found a 
cure both for soul and body ! I opened the chest, and found what I 
looked for, namely the tobacco ; and as the few books I had saved lay 
there too, I took out one of the bibles which I mentioned before, and 
which, to this time, I had not found leisure, or so much as inclination, 
to look into; I say I took it out, and brought both that and the 
tobacco with me to the table. 

What use to make of the tobacco I knew not, as to my distemper, 
or whether it was good for it or no ; but I tried several experiments 
with it, as if I resolved it should hit one way or othj&r : I first took a 
piece of a leaf, and chewed it in my mouth, which indeed at first almost 
stupified my brain, the tobacco being green and strong, and that I had 



of Robimon Ontsoe. 73 

not been nsed to it ; then I took some, and steeped it an honr or two 
in some rum, and resolved to take a dose of it when I lay down ; and 
lastly, I burnt some upon a pan of coals, and held my nose close 
over the smoke of it, as long as I could bear it, and I held almost 
to suffocation. 

In the interval of this operation, I took up the bible, and began to 
read ; but my head was too much disturbed with the tobacco to bear 




reading, at least at that time. Only having opened the book casually, 
the first words that occurred to me were these, " Call on me in the day 
of trouble, and I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me.'* 

The words were very apt to my case, and made some impression 
npon my thoughts at the time of reading them, though not so much as 
they did afterwards ; for, as for being delivered, the word had no sound, 
as I may say, to me ; the thing was so remote, so impossible in my ap- 
prehension of things, that I began to say as the children of Israel did 
when they were promised flesh to eat, "Can God spread a table in 
the wilderness]" so I began to say, can God himself deliver me from 
this place ] And as it was not for many years that any hope appeared, 
this prevailed very often upon my thoughts ; but, however, the words 
made a very great impression upon me, and I mused upon them very 
often. It grew now late, and the tobacco had, as I said, dozed my head 
so much, that I imiined to sleep ; so I left my lamp burning in the cave, 
lest I should waiit Anything in the night, and went to bed : but before 
I lay down, I did what I never had done in all my life; I kneeled down 



74 The Li/k and Adventures 

and prayed to God to fdlfil the piomise to me, that if I called upon 
him in the day of trouble, he would deliver me. After my broken and 
imperfect prayer was over, I drank the rum in which I had steeped 
the tobacco, which was so strong and rank of the tobacco, that indeed 
I could scarce get it down. Immediately upon this I went to bed, and 
I found presently it flew up into my head violently ; but I fell into a 
sound sleep, and waked no more, till noon the next day ; nay, to this 
hour I am partly of the opinion, that I slept all the next day and night, 
and till almost three the day after; for otherwise I knew not how I 
should lose a day out of my reckoning in the days of the week, as it 
appeared some years after I had done ; for if I had lost it by crossing 
and recrossing the line, I should have lost more than one day : but 
certainly I lost a day in my account, and never knew which way. 

Be that however one way or other, when I waked, I found myself 
exceedingly refreshed, and my spirits lively and cheerful When I got 
up, I was stronger than I was the day before, and my stomach better ; 
for I was hungry ; and, in short, I had no fit the next day, but con- 
tinued much altered for the better. This was the 29th. 

The 30th was my well day, of course ; and I went abroad with my 
gun, but did not care to travel too far. I killed a sea-fowl or two, 
something like a brand goose, and brought them home, but was not 
very forward to eat them : so I eat some more of the turtle's eggs, 
which were very good. This evening I renewed the medicine which I 
had supposed did me good the day before, namely, the tobacco steeped 
in rum ; only I did not take so much as before, nor did I chew any of 
the leaf, or hold my head over the smoke. However, I was not so well 
the next day, which was the first of July, as I hoped I should have 
been ; for I had a little spice of the cold fit, but it was not much. 

July 2. I renewed the medicine all the three ways, and dosed 
myself with it at first, and doubled the quantity which I drank. 

Julj/ 3. * I missed the fit for good and all, though I did not recover 
my full strength for some weeks after. While I was thus gathering 
strength, my thoughts run exceedingly upon the scripture, " I will 
deliver thee ; " and the impossibility of my deliverance lay much upon 
my mind, in bar of my ever expecting it : but as I was disceuraging 
myself with such thoughts, it occurred to my mind, that I pored so 
much on my deliverance from the main affliction, that I disregarded 
the deliverance I had received; and I was, as it were, made to ask 
myself such questions as these ; namely, Have I not been delivered, 
and wonderfully too, from sickness ? from the most distressed condition 
that could be, and that was so frightful to me ? and what notice had I 



of Bdbinson Crusoe. 75 ■ 

taken of it 1 had I done my part? " God had delivered me : but I 
had not glorified him : *' that is to say, I had not owned and been 
thankfol for that as a deliverance ; and how could I expect greater 
deliyerance ? 

This touched my heart very much, and immediately I kneeled down, 
and gave God thanks, aloud, for my recovery from my sickness. 

Jtdy 4. In the morning I took the bible ; and, beginning at the 
New Testament, I b^an seriously to read it, and imposed upon myself 
to read awhile every morning and every night, not tying myself to the 
number of chapters, but as long as my thoughts should engage me. It 
was not long after I set seriously to this work, but I found my heart 
more deeply and sincerely affected with the wickedness of my past life. 

Now I began to consteie the words mentioned above " CaU on me, 
and I will deliver thee," in a different sense &om what I had ever 
done before; for then I had no notion of anythiog being called 
deliverance, but my being delivered from the captivity I was in : for 
though I was indeed at large in the place, yet the island was certainly 
a prison to me, and that, in the worst sense in the world ; but now I 
learned to take it in another senseJ Now I looked back upon my past 
life with such horror, and my sins» appeared so dreadful, that my soul 
sought nothing of Gtxl, but deliverance from the load of guilt that 
bore down all my comfort As for my solitary life, it was nothing ; I 
did not so much as pray to be delivered from it, or think of it ; it was 
all of no consideration, in comparison of this. And I add this part 
here, to hint to whoever shall read it, that whenever they come to a 
true sense of things, they will find deliverance from sin a much greater 
blessing than deliverance from affliction. 

But, leaving this part, I return to my journal : — 

My condition began now to be, though not less miserable as to my 
way of living, yet much easier to my mind : and my thoughts being 
directed, by a constant reading the Scripture, and praying to God, to 
things of a higher nature, I had a great deal of comfort within, which 
till now I knew nothing of ; also as my health and strength returned, 
I bestirred myseK to frirnish myself with everything that I wanted, 
and msike my way of living as regular as I could. 

From the 4th of July to the 14th, I was chiefly employed in walking 
about with my gun in my hand, a little and a little at a time, as a 
man that was gathering up his strength after a fit of sickness j for 
it is hardly to be imagined how low I was, and to what weakness I 
was reduced. Hie application which I made use of was perfectly new, 
and perhaps what had never cured an ague before; neither can I 



• 76 The Life and Adventures 

recommend it to any one to practice by this experiment ; and though 
it did carry off the fit, yet it rather contributed to weaken me ; for I 
had frequent convulsions in my nerves and limbs for some time. 

I learnt from it also this, in particular, that being abroad in the 
rainy season was the most pernicious thing to my health that could be, 
especially in those rains which came attended with storms and hurri- 
canes of wind ; for as the rain which came in the dry season was always 
most accompanied with such storms, so I found this rain was much 
more dangerous than the rain which fell in September and October. 

I had been now in this unhappy island above ten months ; all possi- 
bility of deliverance from this condition seemed to be entirely taken 
firom me ; and I firmly believed that no human shape had ever set foot 
upon that place. Having now secured my habitation, as I thought, 
fully to my mind, I had a great desire to make a more perfect discovery 
of the island, and to see what other productions I might find, which I 
yet knew nothing o£ 

It was on the 15th of July that I began to take a more particular 
survey of the island itself ; I went up the creek first, where, as I hinted, 
I brought my rafts on shore. I found, after I came about two miles up, 
that the tide did not flow any higher, and that it was no more than a 
little brook of running water, and very fresh and good ; but this being 
the dry season, there was hardly any water in some parts of it, at least 
not enough to run in any stream, so as it could be perceived. 

On the banks of this brook I found many pleasant savannas or 
meadows, plain, smooth, and covered with grass; and on the rising 
parts of them next to the higher grounds, where the water, as it might 
be supposed, never overflowed, I found a great deal of tobacco, green, 
and growing to a great and very strong stalk. There were divers other 
plants which I had no notion of, or understanding about ; and might 
perhaps have virtues of their own, which I could not find out. 

I searched for the cassava root, which the Indians in all that climate 
make their bread of, but I could not find none. I saw large plants of 
aloes, but did not then understand them. I saw seveml sugar canes, 
but wild, and for want of cultivation, imperfect I contented myself 
with these discoveries for this time, and came back musing with myself 
what course I might take to know the virtue and goodness of any of 
the fruits or plants which T should discover, but could bring it to no 
conclusion : for in short, I had made so little observation while I Was 
in the Brasils, that I knew little of the plants of the field, at least 
very little that might serve me to any purpose now in my distress. 

The next day, the 16th, I went up the same way again ; and, after 



of Robinson Crusoe. Tt 

going somethmg Either than I had done the day before, I found the 
brook and the savannas began to cease, and the countiy became more 
woody than before. In this part I found different fruits, and par- 
ticularly I found melons upon the ground in great abundance, and 
grapes upon the trees; the vines had spread indeed over the trees, and 




Ihe clusters of grapes were just now in their prime, very ripe and rich. 
This was a surprising discovery, and I was exceedingly glad of them; 
but I was warned by my experience to eat sparingly of them, re- 
membering that, when I was ashore in Barbary, the eating of grapes 
killed several of our Englishmen who were slaves there, by throwing 
them into fluxes and fevers : but I found an excellent use for these 
grapes, and that was to cure or dry them in the sun and keep them as 
dried grapes or raisins are kept, which I thought would be, as indeed 
they were, as wholesome, and as agreeable to eat, when no grapes might 
be had 

I spent all that evening there, and went not back to my habitation, 
which by the way was the first night, as I might say, I had lain from 
home. In the night I took my first contrivance, and got up into a 
tree, where I slept well, and the next morning proceeded upon my 
discovery, travelling near four miles, as I might judge by the length of 
the valley, keeping still due north, with a ridge of hills on the south 
and north side of me. 

At the end of this march I came to an opening, where the country 
seemed to descend to the west ; and a little spring of fresh water, 



78 The Ltfe and Advenittre$ 

which ismied out of tiie side of the hill hj me, ran the other way, that 
k, doe ea$t; and the coontry appealed so fresh, so green, so flocudshing, 
ererythiDg being in a constant Teidnxe or flourishing of spring that it 
looked like a planted garden. 

I descended a little on the side of that delicions valley, surveying 
it with a secret kind of pleasnre (though mixed with other afflicting 
thoughts), to think that Ihis was all my own, that I was king and lord 
of aU this country indefeasibly, and had a right of possession ; and if 
I could convey it, I might have it in inheritance, as completely as any 
lord of a manor in Eugland. I saw here abundance of cocoa-trees, 
orange and lemon, and cifoon-trees, but all wild, and few bearing any 
fruit ; at least, not then. However, the green limes that I gathered 
were not only pleasant to eat, but very wholesome ; and I mixed their 
juice afterwards with water, which made it very wholesome, and very 
cool and refreshing. 

I found now I had business enough to gather and carry home ; and 
resolved to lay up a store, as well of grapes, as limes, and lemons, to 
furnish myself for the wet season, which I knew was approaching. 

In order to do this I gathered a heap of grapes in one place, and a 
lesser heap in another place ; and a great parcel of limes, and lemons, 
in another place ; and taking a few of each with me, I travelled home- 
ward, and resolved to come again, and bring a bag or sack, or what I 
could make, to carry the rest home. 

Accordingly, having spent three days in this journey, I came home 
(so I must now call my tent, and my cave) ; but before I got thither 
the grapes were spoiled ; the richness of the fruit, and the weight of 
the juice, having broken them, and bruised them, they were good for 
little or nothing ; as to the limes, they were good, but I could bring 
but a few. 

The next day, being the 19th, I went back, having made me two 
small bags to bring home my harvest But I was surprised, when 
coming to my heap of grapes, which were so rich and fine when I 
gathered them, 1 found them all spread abroad, trod to pieces, and 
dragged about, some here, some there, and abundance eaten and 
devoured. By this I concluded there were some wild creatures there- 
abouts, which had done this ; but what they were I knew not. 

However, as I found there was no laying them up on heaps, and no 
carrying them away in a sack, but that one way they would be destroyed, 
and the other way they would be crushed with their own weight, I took 
another course ; for I gathered a large quantity of the grapes, and hung 
them upon the out branches of the trees, that they might cure and dry

in the sun ; and as for the limes and lemons, I carried as many hack 
as I could well stand under. 

When I came home from this journey, I contemplated with great 
pleasure on the fruitfiilness of that valley, and the pleasantness of the 
situation, the security from storms on that side of the water, and the 
wood ; and concluded that I had pitched upon a place to fix my ahode, 
which was by far the worst part of the country. Upon the whole, I 
began to consider of removing my habitation, and to look out for a place 
equally safe as where I now was situated, if possible-, in that pleasant 
and fruitful part of the island. 

This thought ran long in my head, and I was exceeding fond of it 
for some time, the pleasantness of the place tempting me ; but when I 
came to a nearer view of it, and to consider that I was now by the sea- 
side, where it was at least possible that something might happen to my 
advantage, and that the same ill fate that brought me hither, might 
bring some other unhappy wretches to the same place, and though it 
was scarce probable theit any such thing should ever happen, yet to 
enclose myself among the hills and woods, in the centre of the island, 
was to anticipate my bondage, and to render such an afiair not only 
improbable, but impossible ; and that therefore I ought not by any 
means to remove. 

However, I was so enamoured of this place, that I spent much of my 
time there for the whole remaining part of the month of July and 
though, upon second thoughts, I resolved as above, not to remove, yet 
I built me a little kind of a bower, and surrounded it at a distance with 
a strong fence, being a double hedge, as high as I could reach, well 
staked and filled between with brushwood ; and here I lay very secure, 
sometimes two or three nights together, always going over it with a 
ladder, as before ; so that I fancied now I had my country house, and 
my sea-coast house : and this work took me up to the beginning of 
August. 

I had but newly finished my fence, and began to enjoy my labour, 
but the rains came on, and made me stick close to my first habitation ; 
for though I had made me a tent like the other, with a piece of a sail, 
and spread it very well, yet I had not the shelter of a hill to keep me^ 
from storms, nor a cave behind me to retreat into when the rains were 
extraordinary. 

About the beginning of August, as I said, I had fimished my bower, 
and began to enjoy mysel£ The 3rd of August I found the grapes I 
had hung up were perfectly dried, and indeed were excellent good raisins 
of the sun : so I began to take them down from the trees, and it was 



80 The Life and Adventures 

very happy that I did so ; for the rains which followed would haye 
spoiled them, and I had lost the best part of my winter food; for I 
had above two hundred large bunches of them, ^o sooner had I taken 
them all down, and carried most of them home to my cave, but ift began 
to rain ; and from thence, which was the 14th of August^ it xained 
more or less every day, till the middle of October ; and sometimeB so 
violently, that I could not stir out of my cave for several dayi. 

In this season I was much surprised with the increase of my fitmily : 
I had been concerned for the loss of one of my cats, who ran away firom 
me, or, as I thought, had been dead ; and I heard no more tidingB of 
her, till, to my astonishment, she came home about the end of August, 
with three kittens. This was the more strange to me, because though 
I had killed a wild cat, as I called it, with my gun, yet I thought it 
was a quite different kind from our European cats ; yet the young cats 
were the same kind of house breed like the old one ; and both my cats 
being females, I thought it very strange : but from these three cats, I 
afterwards came to be so pestered with cats, that I was forced to kill 
them like vermin, or wild beasts, and to drive them from my house as 
much as possible. 

From the 14th of August to the 26th, incessant rain, so that I could 
not stir, and was now very careful not to be much wet. In this con- 
finement I began to be straitened for food : but venturing out twice, I 
one day killed a goat : and the last day, which was the 26 th, found a 
very large tortoise, which was a treat to nie; and my food was regulated 
thus : — I eat a bunch of raisins for my breakfast, a piece of the goat's 
flesh, or of the turtle, for my dinner, broiled (for to my great misfortune 
I had no vessel to boil or stew anything), and two or three of the 
turtle's eggs for supper. 

During this confinement in my cover, by the rain, I worked daily two 
or three hours at enlarging my cave ; and, by degrees, worked it on 
towards one side, till I came to the outside of the hill, and made a door 
or way out, which came beyond my fence or wall ; and so I came in 
and out this way. But I was not perfectly easy at lying so open ; for 
as I had managed myself before, I was in a perfect enclosure, whereas 
now I thought I lay exposed ; and yet I could not perceive that there 
was any living thing to fear, the biggest creature that I had seen upon 
the island being a goat. 

September 30. I was now come to the unhappy anniversary of 
my landing: I cast up the notches on my post, and found I had been 
on shore three hundred and sixty-five days. I kept this day as a 
solemn fast, setting it apart to a religious exorcise, prostrating myself 



of Robinson Crusoe. 81 

x)n the groimd with the most serious humiliation, confessing my sins to 
God, acknowledging his righteous judgments upon me, and praying to 
him to have mercy on me, through Jesus Christ ; and having not tasted 
the least refreshment for twelve hours, even to the going down of the 
sun, I then ate a biscuit-cake, and a bunch of grapes, and went to bed, 
finishing the day as I began it 

I had all this time observed no Sabbath-day ', for as at first I had no 
sense of religion upon my mind, I had after some time omitted to dis- 
tinguish the weeks, by making a longer notch than ordinary for the 
Sabbath-day, and so did not really know what any of the days were ; 
but now, having cast up the days as above, I found I had been there a 
year ; so I divided it into weeks, and set apart every seventh day for a 
Sabbath ; though I found at the end of my account I had lost a day or 
two in my reckoning. 

A little after this my ink began to fail me, and so I contented myself 
to use it more sparingly, and to write down only the most remarkable 
events of my life, without continuing a daily memorandum of other things. 
The rainy season, and the dry season, began now to appear regular 
to me, and I learned to divide tiiem so as to provide for them accord- 
ingly. But I bought all my experience before I had it ; and this I am 
going to relate, was one of the most discouraging experiments that I 
made at alL I have mentioned, that I had saved the few ears of barley 
and rice which I had so surprisingly found spring up, as I thought^ of 
themselves, and believe there were about thirty stalks of rice, and about 
twenty of barley ; and now I thought it a proper time to sow it after 
the rains, the sun being in its southern position going from me. 

Accordingly I dug up a piece of ground, as well as I could, with my 
wooden spade, and dividing it into two parts, I sowed my grain ; but as 
I was sowing, it casually occured to my thought, that I would not sow 
it all at first, because I did not know when was the proper time for it ; 
so I sowed about two-thirds of the seeds, leaving about a handful of 
each. It was a great comfort to me afterwards that I did so, for not 
one grain of that I sowed this time came to anything; for the dry 
months following, the earth having had no rain after the seed was 
sown, it had no moisture to assist its growth, and never came up at all, 
till the wet season had come again, and then it grew as if it had been 
newly sown. 

Finding my first seed did not grow, which I easily imagined was by 
the drought, I sought for a moister piece of ground to make another 
trial in ; and I d,ug up a piece of ground near my new bower, and 
sowed the rest of my seed in February, a little before the vernal 

a 



82 The Life and Adventures 

equinox ; and this, haying the lainj months of March and April to 
water it^ sprung np very pleasantly, and yielded a very good crop ; bnt 
haying part of the seed left only, and not daring to sow all that I had 
yet, I had bnt a small quantity at last, my whole crop not amounting to 
above half a peck of each kind. 

But by this experience I was made master of my business, and knew 
exactly when the proper season was to sow ; and that I might expect 
two seed-times, and two harvests every year. 

While this com was growing, I made a little discovery, which was 
of use to me afterwards. As soon as the rains were over, and the 
weather began to settle, which was about the month of November, I 
made a visit up the country to my bower, where though I had not been 
some months, yet I found all things just as I left them. The circle or 
double hedge that I had made, was not only firm and entire, but the 
stakes which I had cut off of some trees that grew thereabouts, were 
aU shot out, and grown with long branches, as much as a wiUow tree 
usually shoots the first year after lopping its head. I could not tell 
what tree to call it that these stakes were cut from. I was surprised, 
and yet very well pleased, to see the young trees grow ; and I pruned 
them, and led them to grow as much alike as I could, and it is scarce 
credible, how beautiful a figure they grew into in three years ; so that 
though the hedge made a circle of about twenty-five yards in diameter, 
yet the trees, for such I might now call them, soon covered it ; and it 
was a complete shade, sufl&cient to lodge under all the dry season. 

This made me resolve to cut some more stakes, and make me a hedge 
like this in a semicircle round my wall, I mean that of my first dwell- 
ing, which I did ; and placing the trees or stakes in a double row, at 
about eight yards' distance from my first fence, they grew presently, and 
were at first a fine cover to my habitation, and afterwards served for a 
defence also, as I shall observe in its order. 

I found now,' that the seasons of the year might generally be divided, 
not into summer and winter, as in Europe, but into the rainy seasons 
and the dry seasons, which were generally thus : 

Half February, March, half April — Esdny, the sun being then on or 
near the equinox. 

Half April, May, June, July, half August — Dry, the sun being then 
to the north of the line. 

Half August, September, half October — Eainy, the sun then being 
come back. 

Half October, November, December, January, half February — ^Dry, 
the sun being then to the south of the line. 



of Bohinaon Crusoe. 83 

The lamy season sometimes held longer or shorter, as the winds 
happened to blow; but this was the general observation I made. After 
I had found by experience, the ill consequences of being abroad in the 
rain, I took care to furnish myself with provisions beforehand, that I 
might not be obliged to go out ; and I sat within doors as much as 
possible during the wet months. 

In this time I found much employment, (and very suitable also to 
the time), for I found great occasion for many things which I had no 
way to furnish myself with, but by hard labour and constant appli- 
Mition. Particularly, I tried many ways to make myself a basket ; but 
ill the twigs I could get for the purpose proved so brittle, that they 
i^ould do nothing. It proved of excellent advantage to me now, that 
when I was a boy, I used to take great delight in standing at a basket- 
maker^s in the town where my father lived, to see them make their 
wicker-ware; and being, as boys usually are, very ofl&cious to help, and 
a great observer of the manner how they worked those things, and 
sometimes lending a hand, I had by this means so full knowledge of 
the methods of it, that I wanted nothing but the materials ; when it 
came into my mind, that the twigs of that tree from whence I cut my 
stakes that grew, might possibly be as tough as the sallows and willows, 
and osiers, in England, and I resolved to try. 

Accordingly the next day I went to my country house, as I called it, 
and cutting some of the smaller twigs, I found them to my purpose as 




much as I could desire ; whereupon I came the next time prepared 
with a hatchet to cut down a quantity which I soon found, for there 

g2 



84 The lAfo and Adventures 

•was a great plenty of them. These I set up to dry within my circle op 
hedges ; and when they were fit for use, I carried them to my cave ; 
and here, during the next season I employed myself in making (as well 
as I could) a great many haskets, hoth to carry earth, or to carry or lay 
up anything, as I had occasion ; and though I did not finish them very 
handsomely, yet I "made them sufi&ciently serviceable for my purpose; 
and thus afterwards I took care never to be without them ; and as my 
wicker-ware decayed, I made more; especially I made strong deep 
baskets to place my com in, instead of sacks, when I should come to 
have any quantity of it 

Having mastered this dif&culty, and employed a world of time about 
it, I bestirred myself to see, if possible, how to supply two wants. I 
had no vessels to hold anything that was liquid, except two runlets, 
which were ahnost full of rum, and some glass bottles, some of the 
common size, and others, which were case-bottles, square, for the hold- 
ing of waters, spirits, &c. I had not so much as a pot to boil anything 
in, except a great kettle which I saved out of the ship, and which was 
too big for such uses as I desired for it, namely, to make broth, and 
stew a bit of meat by itself The second thing I would fain have had, 
was a tobacco-pipe, but it was impossible for me to make one; however, 
I found a contrivance for that too at last. 

I employed myself in planting my second rows of stakes or piles, 
and in this wicker work, all the summer, or dry season ; when another 
business took me up more time than it could be imagined I could spare. 

I mentioned before, that I had a great mind to see the whole island, 
and that I had travelled up the brook, and so on to where I built my 
bower, and where I had an opening quite to the sea, on the other side 
of the island. I now resolved to travel quite across to the sea-shore 
on that side ; so taking my gun, and hatchet, and my dog, and a larger 
quantity of powder and shot than usual, with two biscuit-cakes, and a 
great bunch of raisins in my pouch, for my store, I began my journey. 
When I had passed the vale where my bower stood, as above, I came 
within view of the sea, to the west ; and it being a very clear day, I 
fairly descried land, whether an island or continent I could not tell ; 
but it lay very high, extending from the West to the W.S.W. at a very 
great distance ; by my guess it could not be less than fifteen or twenty 
leagues off. 

I could not tell what part of the world this might be, otherwise 
than that I knew it must be part of America ; and, as I concluded by 
all my observations, must be near the Spanish dominions, and perhaps 
was fiil inhabited by savages, where if I should have landed, I had been 



of Robinaon Crusoe. 85 

in a worse condition than I was now ; and therefore I acquiesced in 
the dispositions of Providence, which I hegan now to own, and to 
believe, ordered everything for the best ; I say I quieted my mind 
with this, and left afflicting myself with fruitless wishes of being there. 

Besides, after some pause upon this afiEair, I considered, that if this 
land was the Spanish coast, I should certainly, one time or other, see 
some vessel pass or repass one way or other ; but if not, then it was 
the savage coast between the Spanish country and Brazil, which is 
inhabited by the worst of savages ; for they are cannibals, or men- 
eaters, and &il not to murder and devour all the human bodies that 
HeJI into their hands. 

With these considerations I walked very leisurely forward. I found 
that side of the island where I now was, much pleasanter than mine, 
the open or savanna fields sweety adorned with flowers and grass, and 
full of very fine woods. I saw abundance of parrots, and fein would 
I have caught one, if possible, to have kept it to be tame, and taught 
it to speak to ma I did, after some paios taken, catch a young parrot; 
for I knocked it down with a stick, and having recovered it, I brought 
it home, but it was some years before I could make him speak. How- 
ever, at last I taught him to call me by my name, very familiarly : but 
the accident that followed, though it be a trifle, will be very diverting 
in its place. 

I was exceedingly diverted with this journey. I found in the low 
grounds, hares as I thought them to be, and foxes, but they differed 
greatly from all other kinds I had met with; nor could I satisfy 
myself to eat them, though I killed several : but I had no need to be 
venturous ; for I had no want of food, and of that which was very 
good too : especially these three sorts, goats, pigeons, and turtle or 
tortoise ; which, added to my grapes, Leadenhall market could not have 
famished a better table than I, in proportion to the company : and 
though my case was deplorable enough, yet I had great cause for thank- 
fulness, that I was not driven to any extremities for food ; but rather 
plenty, even to dainties. 

I never travelled in this journey above two miles outright in a day, 
or thereabouts ; but I took so many turns and returns, to see what 
discoveries I could make, that I came weary enough to the place where 
I resolved to sit down for all night ; and then either reposed myself 
in a tree, or surrounded myseK with a row of stakes set upright in the 
ground, either from one tree or another, or so as no wild creature could 
come at me without waking me. 

As soon as I came to the sea-shore, I was surprised to see that I had 



86 The Lijk and Adventures 

taken up my lot on the worst side of tbe island; for here indeed the 
shore was covered with innumerable turtles, whereas on the other side 
I had found but three in a year and a half Here was also an infinite 
number of fowls of many kinds, some of which I had not seen before, 
and many of them very good meat ; but such as I knew not the names 
of, except those called penguins. 

I could have shot as many as I pleased, but was very sparing of my 
powder and shot : and therefore had more mind to kill a she-goat^ if I 
could, which I could better feed on : and though there were many more 
goats here than on the other side of the island, yet it was with much 
more difficulty that I could come near them ; the country being flat 
and even, so that they saw me much sooner than when I was on the 
hills. 

I confess this side of the country was much pleasanter than mine, 
but yet I had not the least inclination to remove ; for as I was fixed 
in my habitation, it became natural to me ; and I seemed all the 
while I was here, to be, as it were, upon a journey, and from home. 
However, I travelled along the shore of the sea towards the east, I 
suppose about twelve miles ; and then setting up a great pole upon 
the shore for a mark, I concluded I would go home again ; and the 
next journey I took should be on the other side of the island, east 
from my dwelling, and so round, till T came to my post again : of 
which in its place. 

I took another way to come back than that I went, thinking I could 
easily keep all the island so much in my view, that I could not miss 
finding my first dwelling by viewing the country ; but I found myself 
mistaken ; for being come about two or three miles, I found myself 
descended into a very large valley ; but so surrounded with hills, and 
those hills covered with woods, that I could not see which was my way 
by any direction but that of the sun ; nor even then, unless I knew 
very well the position of the sun at that time of the day. 

It happened, to my farther misfortune, that the weather proved hazy 
for three or four days while I was in this valley ; and not being able 
to see the sun, I wandered about very uncomfortably, and at last was 
obliged to find out the sea-side, Jook for my post, and come back the 
same way I went ; and then by easy journeys I turned homeward, the 
weather being exceeding hot ; and my gun, ammunition, hatchet, and 
other things very heavy. 

In this journey my dog surprised a young kid, and seized upon it ; 
and I running to take hold of it, caught it, and saved it alive from the 
do^. I had a great mind to bring it home, if I could ; for I had often 



of Robinson Crusoe. 



87 



been musing whether it might not be possible to get a kid or two, 
and so raise a breed of tame goats, which might supply me when my 
powder and shot should be spent. 

I made a collar for this little creature ; and with a string which I 
made of some rope-yam, which I always carried about me, I led him 
along, though with some difficulty, till I came to my bower, and there 
I enclosed him, and left him ; for I was very impatient to be at home, 
from whence I had been absent above a month. 

I cannot express what a satisfaction it was to me to come into my 
old hutch, and lie down in my hammock-bed : this little wandering 
journey, without a settled place of abode, had been so unpleasant 
to me, that my own house, as I called it to myself, was a perfect settle- 
ment to me, compared to that ; and it rendered everything about me 
so comfortable, that I resolved that I would never go a great way fix)m 
it again, while it should be my lot to stay on the island. 

I reposed myself here a week, to rest and regale myself after my 
long journey ; during which, most of the time was taken up in the 
weighty affair of making a cage for my Poll, who began now to be a 
mere domestic, and to be mighty well acquainted with me. Then I 
began to think of the poor kid, which I had pent in within my little 
circle, and resolved to go and fetch it home, and give it some food : 
accordingly I went, and found it where I left it ; for indeed it could 
not get out, but was almost starved for want of food. I went and cut 




boughs of trees and branches of such shrubs as I could find, and threw 
over to it ; and having fed it> I tied it as I did before to lead it 



88 The Life and Adventures 

away ; but it was so tame with being bnngiy, that I had no need to 
have tied it ; for it followed me like a dog ; and as I continually fed 
it^ the creature became so loving, so gentle, and so fond, that it became 
from that time one of my domestics also, and would never leave me 
afterwards. 

The rainy season of the autumnal equinox was now come, and I 
kept the 30th of September in the same solemn manner as before, being 
the anniversary of my landing on the island, having now been there 
two years, and no more prospect of being delivered than the first day 
I came there. I spent the whole day in humble and thankful 
acknowledgments of the many wonderful mercies which my solitary 
condition was attended with, and without which it might have been 
infinitely more miserable. I gave humble and hearty thanks, that GrOD 
had been pleased to discover to me, even that it was possible I might 
be more happy in this solitary condition, than I should have been in 
society, and in all the pleasures of the world : that he could fully 
make up to me the deficiencies of my solitary state and the want of 
human society, by his presence, and the conmiunications of his grace 
to my soul, supporting, comforting, and encouraging me to depend upon 
his providence here, and hope for his eternal presence hereafter. 

Before, as I walked about, either on my hunting, or for viewing the 
country, the anguish of my soul at my condition would break upon me 
on a sudden, and my very heart would die within me, to think of the 
woods, the mountains, the deserts I was in; and how I was a prisoner, 
locked up with the eternal bolts and bars of the ocean, in an un- 
inhabited wilderness, without redemption. In the midst of the greatest 
composures of my mind, this would break out upon me like a storm, 
and make me wring my hands, and weep like a child. Sometimes it 
would take me in the middle of my work, and I would immediately 
sit down and sigh, and look down upon the ground for an hour or two 
together ; and this was still worse to me ; for if I could burst out into 
tears, or vent myself by words, it would go o£^ and the grie:^ having 
exhausted itself^ would abata 

But now I began to exercise myself with new thoughts ; I daily 
read the word of God, and applied all the comforts of it to my present 
state. One morning, being very sad, I opened the bible upon these words, 
" I will never, never leave ihee, nor forsake thee ! " Immediately it 
occurred, that these words were to me, why else should they be 
directed in such a manner, just at the moment When I was mourning 
over my condition, as one forsaken of GrOD and man 1 Well then, said 
I, if God does not forsake me, of what ill consequence can it be^ or 



€f Rohinaon Crusoe. 89 

what matters it, thongh the world should all forsake me; seeing on the 
other handy if I had aU the world, and should lose the favour and 
blessing of GrOD, there would be no comparison in the loss. 

I never opened the bible, or shut it, but mj very soul within me 
blessed God for directing my Mend in England, without any order of 
mine, to pack it up among my goods ; and for assisting me afterwards 
to save it out of the wreck of the ship. 

In this disposition of mind, I began my third year ; and though I 
have not given the reader the trouble of so particular an account of my 
works this year as at the first, yet in general it may be observed, that 
I was very seldom idle ; having regularly divided i||plime, according 
to the several daily employments that were before me, such as firsts my 
duty to Grod, and reading the scriptures, which I constantly set apart 
some time for, thrice every day. Secondly, the going abroad with my 
gun for food, which generally took me up three hours every morning 
when it did not rain. Thirdly, the ordering, curing, preserving, and 
cooking what I had killed or caught for my supply. These took up 
great part of the day. Also it is to be considered, that in the middle 
of the day, the violence of the heat was too great to stir out ; so that 
about four hours in the evening was all the time I could be supposed 
to work in ; with this exception, that sometimes I changed my hours 
of hunting and working, and went to work in the morning, and abroad 
with my gun in the afternoon. 

To this short time allowed for labour, I desire may be added the ex- 
ceeding laboriousness of my work ; the many hours which, for want of 
took, want of help, and want of skill, everything that I did took up out 
of my time : for example, I was fiill two-and-forty days making me a 
board for a long shel^ which I wanted in my cave ; whereas two 
sawyers, with their tools and saw-pit, would have cut six of them out 
of the same tree ia half a day. 

My case was this : It was to be a large tree which was to be cut 
down, because my board was to be a broad one. The tree I was three 
days a cutting down, and two more cutting oflF the boughs, and reducing 
it to a log, or piece of timber. With inexpressible hacking and hewing, 
I reduced both the sides of it into chips, till it began to be light enough 
to move ; then I turned it, and made one side of it smooth and flat 
as a board, from end to end : then turning that side downward, cut the 
other side till I brought the plank to be about three inches thick, and 
smooth on both- sidei^ Any one may judge the labour of my hands 
in such a piece of work j but labour and patience carried me through 
that and many othe^ things.

I was now in the months of November and December, expecting my 
crop of barley and rice. The ground I had manured or dug up for 
them was not great ; for, as I observed, my seed of each was not above 
the quantity of half a peck ; for I had lost one whole crop by sowing 
in the dry season ; but now my crop promised very well, when on a 
sudden I found I was in danger of losing it all again by enemies of 
several sorts, which it was scarce possible to keep jfrom it ; at first, 
the goats, and wild creatures which I called hares, which, tasting the 
sweetness of the blade, lay in it night and day, as soon as it came up, 
and eat it so close^ that it could get no time to shoot up into stalks. 

This I saw .tf^ltoedy for, but by making an inclosure about it with 
a hedge, which I did with a great deal of toil ; and the more, because 
it required a great deal of speed ; the creatures daily spoiling my com. 
However, as my arable land was but small, suited to my crop, I got it 
totally well fenced in about three weeks* time; and shooting some of 
the creatures in the daytime, I set my dog to guard it in the night, 
tying him up to a stake at the gate, where he would stand and bark all 
night long : so in a little time the enemies forsook the place, and the 
com grew very strong and well, and began to ripen apace. 

But as the beasts ruined me before, while my com was in the blade, 
so the birds were as like to ruin me now, when it was in the ear ; for 
going along by the place to see how it throve, I saw my little crop 
surrounded with fowls of I know not how many sorts, which stood as 
it were watching till I should be gone. I immediately let fly among 
them, (for I always had my gun with me). I had no sooner shot, but 
there arose up a little cloud of fowls, which I had not seen at all, from 
among the corn itself. 

This touched me sensibly; for I foresaw, that in a few days they 
would devour all my hopes : that I should be starved, and never be 
able to raise a crop at all ; and what to do I could not tell ; however, 
I resolved not to lose my corn, if possible, though I should watch it 
night and day. In the first place, I went among it to see what damage 
was already done, and found they had spoiled a good deal of it ; but 
that, as it was yet too green for them, the loss was not so great, but 
the remainder was like to be a good crop, if it could be saved. 

I staid by it to load my gun, and then coming away, I could easily 
see the thieves sitting upon all the trees about me, as if they only 
waited till I was gone away, and the event proved it to be so ; for as I 
walked off, as if I was gone, I was no sooner out of their sight, but 
they dropped down one by one into the corn again. I was so pro- 
voked, that I could not have patience to stay till more came on. 



of UobvMon Crusoe, 91 

knowing that eveiy grain that they eat now was, as it might be said, ji 
peck loaf to me in the consequence. But coming up to the hedge, I 
fired again, and killed three of them. This was what I wished for; so 
I took them up, and served them, as we serve notorious thieves in 
England, that is, hanged them in chains, for a terror to others. It is 
almost impossible to imagine, that this should have such an effect as it 
had, for the fowls would not only not come at the com, but in short 
they forsook all that part of the island, and I could never see a bird 
near the place as long as my scarecrows hung there. This I was very 
glad 0^ you may be sure, and about the latter end of December, which 
was our second harvest of the year, I reaped my com. 

I was sadly put to it for a scythe or a sickle to cut it down, and all 
I could do was to make one as well as I could, out of one of the broad- 
swords, or cutlasses, which I saved among the arms out of the ship. 




However, as my crop was but small, I had no great difl&culty to cut it 
down; in short, I reaped it my way, for I cut nothing off but the 
ears, and carried it away in a great basket which I had made, and so 
rubbed it out with my hands. And at the end of all my harvesting 
I found, that out of my half-peck of seed, I had near two bushels of 
rice, and above two bushels and a half of barley, that is to say, by my 
guess, for I had no measure at that time. 

However, this was a great encouragement to me, and I foresaw that 
in time it would please Grod to supply me with bread ; and yet here 
I was perplexed again^ for I neither knew how to grind or make meal 



92 The Life and AdvenitireB 

of my com, or indeed how to dean it^ and part it ; nor, if made into 
mealy how to make bread of it ; and if how to make it^ yet I knew not 
bow to bake it These things being added to mj desire of having a 
good quantity for store, and to secure a constant supply, I resolved 
not to taste any of this crop, bnt to preserve it all for seed against 
the next season, and in the mean time to employ aU my study and 
hours of working to accomplish this great work of providing myself 
with com and bread. 

It might be truly said, that now I worked for my bread. It is a 
little wonderful, and what I believe few people have thought much 
upon ; namely, the strange multitude of little things necessary in the 
providing, producing, curing dressings making and foiishing, this 
one article of bread. 

First, I had no plough to turn the earth, no spade or shovel to dig 
it Well, this I conquered by making a wooden spade, as I observed 
before, but this did my work in but a wooden manner ; and though it 
cost me a great many days to make it ; yet for want of iron, it not 
only wore out the sooner, but made my work the harder, and made it 
be performed much worse. 

However, this I bore with too, and was content to work it out with 
patience, and bear with the badness of the performance. When the 
com was sowed, I had no harrow, but was forced to go over it myself 
and drag a great heavy bough of a tree over it, to scratch the earth, as 
it may be called, rather than rake or harrow it 

When it was growing or grown, I have observed already how many 
things I wanted, to fence it, secure it, mow or reap it, cure or carry it 
home, thresh, part it from the chaff, and save it Then I wanted a 
mill to grind it, sieves to dress it, yeast and salt to make it into bread, 
and an oven to bake it in ; and all these things I did without, as shall 
be observed; and yet the com was an inestimable comfort and ad- 
vantage to me too. But all this, as I said, made everything laborious 
and tedious to me, but that there was no help for, neither was my 
time so much loss to me, because I had divided it. A certain part of 
it was every day appointed to these works, and as I resolved to use 
none of the corn for bread till I had a greater quantity by me, I had 
the next six months to apply myself, whoUy by labour and invention, 
to furnish myseK with utensils proper for the performing all the opera- 
tions necessary for the making the com, when I had it^ fit for my use. 

But first I was to prepare more land, for I had now seed enough to 
sow above an acre of ground. Before I did this, I had a week's work 
at least to make me a spade, which, when it was done, was a very sorry 



of Bobinson Crusoe, 93 

one indeed^ and veiy heavy, and required double labour to work with 
it ; however, I went through that, and sowed my seeds in two large 
flat pieces of ground, as near my house as I could £nd them to my 
mind, and fenced them in with a good hedge, the stakes of which were 
all cut off that wood which I had set before, which I knew would 
grow; so that in one year's time I knew I should have a quick or 
living hedge, that would want but little repair. This work was not so 
little as to take me up less than three months ; because great part of 
that time was in the wet season, when I could not go abroad. 

Within-door, that is, when it rained, and I could not go out, I found 
employment on the following occasion, always observing, that all the 
while I was at work, I diverted myself with talking to my parrot, and 
teaching him to speak ; and I quickly learnt him to know his own 
name ; at last, to speak it out pretty loud, Poll ; which was the first 
word I ever heard spoken in the island by any mouth but my own. 
This therefore was not my work, but an assistant to my work ; for now, 
as I said, I had a great employment upon my hands, as follows : I had 
long studied, by some means or other, to make myself some earthen 
vessels, which indeed I wanted sorely, but knew not where to come at 
them : however, considering the heat of the climate, I did not doubt^ 
but if I could find out any such clay, I might botch up some such 
pot, as might, being dried by the sun, be hard enough, and strong 
enough, to bear handling, and to hold anything that was dry, and 
required to be kept so ; and as this was necessary in preparing corn, 
meal, &c., which was the thing I was upon, I resolved to make some 
as large as I could, and fit only to stand Hke jars to hold what should 
be put into them. 

It would make the reader pity me, or rather laugh at me, to tell 
how many awkward ways I took to raise this paste, what odd mis- 
shapen ugly things I made, how many of them fell in, and how many 
fell out, ttie clay not being stiff enough to bear its own weight ; how 
many cracked by the over violent heat of the sun, being set out too 
hastily ; and how many fell to pieces with only removing, as well 
before as after they were dried ; and, in a word, how, after having 
laboured hard to find the clay, to dig it, to temper it, to bring it home, 
and work it, I could not make above two large earthen ugly things, I 
cannot call them jars, in about two months' labour. 

However, as the sun baked these two very dry and hard, I lifted them 
very gently up, and set them down again in two greater wicker baskets, 
which I had made on piurpose for them, that they might not break, 
and, as between the pot and the basket there was a little room to spare, 



94; The Life and Adventures 

I stuffed it foil of the rice and barley straw; and these two pots being 
to stand always dry, I thought it would hold my dry com, and perhaps 
the meal when the corn was bruised. 

Though I miscarried so much in my design for large pots, yet I 
made several smaller things with better success, such as little round 
pots, flat dishes, pitchers, and pipkins, and anytiiing my hand turned 
to, and the heat of the sun baked them strangely hard. 

But all this would not answer my end, which was to get an earthen 
pot to hold what was liquid, and bear the fire, which none of these 
could do. It happened after some time, making a pretty large fire for 
cookmg my meat, when I went to put it out after I had done with it, 
I found a broken piece of one of my earthenware vessels in the fire, 
burnt as hard as a stone, and red as a tile. I was agreeably surprised 
to see it, and said to myself that certainly they might be made to bum 
whole, if they would bum broken. 

This set me to study how to order my fire, so as to make it bum me 
some pots. I had no notion of a kiln, such as the potters bum in, or 
of glazing them with lead, though I had some lead to do it with ; but 
I placed three large pipkins, and two or three pots, in a pile one upon 
another, and placed my firewood all round it, with a great heap of 
embers under them; I plied the fire with fresh fuel round the outside, 
and upon the top, till I saw the pots in the inside red-hot quite through, 
and observed that they did not crack at all; when I saw them clear red, 
I let them stand in that heat about five or six hours, till I found one of 
them though it did not crack, did melt or run. For the sand which 
was mixed with the clay, melted by the violence of the heat, and would 
have run into glass, if I had gdne on ; so I slacked my fire gradually, 
till the pots began to abate of the red colour, and watching them adl 
night that I might not let the fire abate too fast, in the morning I had 
three very good, I will not say handsome pipkins, and two other 
earthen pots, as hard burnt as could be desired, and one of them 
perfectly glazed with the running of the sand. 

After this experiment I need not say that I wanted no sort of 
earthen-ware for my use, but I must needs say, as to the shapes of 
them, they were very indifferent, as any one may suppose, when I had 
no way of making them, but as the children make dirt-pies, or as a 
woman Would make pies that never learnt to raise paste. 

No joy at a thing of so mean a nature was ever equal to nune, when 
I found I had made an earthen pot that would bear the fire ; and I had 
hardly patience to stay till they were cold, before I set one upon the 
fire again, with some water in it^ to boil me some meat^ which it did 



of Rdbinson Crusoe, 95 

Admirably well ; and with a piece of a kid I made some veiy good broth, 
thoagh I wanted oatmeal, and several other ingredients requisite to 
make it so good as I would have had it. 

My next concern was to get me a stone mortar to stamp or beat some 
com in ; for as to the mill, there was no thought of arriving to that 
perfection of art with one pair of hands. To supply this want, I was 
at a great loss; for of all trades in the world I was as perfectly 
unqualified for a stone-cutter, as for any whatever ; neither had I any 
tools to go about it with. I spent many a day to find out a great stone 
big enough to cut hollow, and make fit for a mortar, and could find 
none at dl, except what was in the solid rock, and which I had no way 
to dig or cut out ; nor indeed were the rocks in the island of hardness 
sufficient, but were aU of a sandy crumbling stone, which would neither 
bear the weight of a heavy pestle, nor would break the com without 
filling it with sand ; so, after a great deal of time lost in searching for 
a stone, I gave it over, and resolved to look out for a great block of 
hard wood, which I found indeed much easier ; and getting one as big 
as I had strength to stir, I rounded it, and formed it on the outside 
with my axe and hatchet ; and then, with the help of fire and infinite 
labour, made a hollow place in it, as the Indians in Brasil make their 
canoes. After this, I made a great heavy pestle or beater, of the wood 
called the iron- wood ; and tlus I prepared and laid by against I had my 
next crop of com, when I proposed to myself to grind, or rather pound, 
my com or meal to make my bread. 

My next difficulty was to make a sieve, to dress my meal, and part 
it from the bran and the husk, without which I did not see it possible 
I could have any bread. This was a most difficult thing, so much as 
but to think on ; for to be sure, I had nothing like the necessary things 
to make it with ; I mean fine thin canvass, or stuf^ to sift the meal 
through. And here I was at a full stop for many months ; nor did I 
really know what to do : linen I had none left but what was mere rags ; 
I had goat's hair, but neither knew I how to weave or spin it ; and had 
I known how, here were no tools to work it with. All the remedy that 
\ found for this, was, that at last I did remember I had among the 
seamen's clothes, which were saved out of the ship, some neckcloths of 
calico or muslin ; and with some pieces of these I made three small 
sieves, but proper enough for the work: and thus I made shift for 
some years ; how I did afterwards, I shall shew in its place. 

The baking part was the next thing to be considered, and how I 
should make bread when I came to have com; for, first, I had no 
yeast As to that part, as there was no supplying the want, so I did 



96 The Life and Adventures 

not concern myself niucb. about it. But for an oven, I was indeed in 
great pain. At length I found out an experiment for that also, which 
was this : I made some earthen vessels very broad, but not deep ; that 
is to say, about two feet diameter, and not above nine inches deep ; 
these I burnt in the fire, as I had done the other, and laid them by : 
and when I wanted to bake, I made a great fire upon the hearth, which 
I had paved with some square tiles of my own making and burning 
also; but I should not call them square. When the firewood was 
burnt pretty much into embers or live coals, I drew them forward upon 
this hearth, so as to cover it all over ; and there I let them lie, till the 
hearth was very hot : then sweeping away all the embers, I set down 
my loa^ or loaves ; and whelming down the earthen pot upon them, 
drew the embers all round the outside of the pot, to keep in, and add 
to the heat : and thus, as well as in the best oven in the world, I baked 
my l)arley-loaves, and became in a little time a pastry-cook into the 
bargain, for I made myseK several cakes of the rice, and puddings. 

It need not be wondered at, if all these things took me up most part 
of the third year of my abode here ; for it is to be observed, that in 
the intervals of these things, I had my new harvest and husbandry to 
manage : for I reaped my com in its season, and carried it home as well 
as I could, and laid it up in the ear, in my large baskets, till I had 
time to rub it out; for I had no floor to thrash it on, or instrument to 
thrash it with. 

And now indeed, my stock of com increasing, I really wanted to 
build my bams bigger: I wanted a place to lay it up in; for the 
increase of the com now yielded me so much, that I had of the barley 
about twenty bushels, and of the rice as much, or more ; insomuch that 
I now resolved to begin to use it freely, for my bread had been quite • 
gone a great while : also I resolved to see what quantity would be 
sufficient for me a whole year, and to sow but once a year. 

Upon the whole, I found that the forty bushels of barley and rice 
were much more than I could consume iu a year ; so I resolved to sow 
just the same quantity every year that I sowed the last, in hopes that 
such a quantity would fully provide me with bread. 

All the while these things were doing, you may be sure my thoughts 
ran many times upon the prospect of land which I had seen from the 
other side of the island ; and I was not without secret wishes that I 
was on shore there, fancying that seeing the main land, and an inhabited 
country, I might find some way or other to convey myself farther, and 
perhaps at last find some means of escape. 

But all this while I made no allowance for the dangers of such a 



of Robinson Crusoe. 97 

conditioii, and how I might fall into the hands of savages, and perhaps 
such as I might have reason to think far worse than the lions and 
tigers of Africa. That if I once came into their power, I should run a 
hazard more than a thousand to one of heing killed, and perhaps of 
being eaten ; for I had heard that the people of the Caribbean coasts 
were cannibals, or men-eaters ; and I knew by the latitude that I could 
not be far off from that shore. All these things, I say, which I ought 
to have considered well of, and I did cast up in my thoughts afterwards^ 
yet took none of my apprehensions at first ; and my head ran mightily 
upon the thoughts of getting over to that shore. 

Now I wished for my boy Xury, and the long boat with the shoulder- 
of -mutton sail, with which I sailed above a thousand miles on the coast 
of Africa ; but this was in vain. Then I thought I would go and look 
on our ship's boat, which, as I have said, was blown up upon the shore 
a great way in the storm, when we were first cast away. She lay almost 
where she did at first, but not quite ; and was turned, by the force of 
the waves, and the winds, almost bottom upwards, against the high 
ridge of a beachy rough sand, but no water about her as before. 

Had I had hands to have refitted her, and have launched her into 
the water, the boat would have done well enough, and I might have 
gone back into the Brasils with her easily enough ; but I might have 
easily foreseen, that I could no more turn her, and set her upright upon 
her bottom, than I could remove the island. However I went to the 
wood, and cut levers and rollers, and brought them to the boat, resolving 
to try what I could do j suggesting to myseK, that if I could but turn 




her down, I might easily repair the damage she had received, and she 
would be a very good boat, and I might go to sea in her very easily. 

H 



98 The Life and Adventures 

I spared no pains indeed in tliis piece of fruitless toil, and spent, I 
think, three or four weeks about it. At last, finding it impossible to 
heave it up with my little strength, I fell to digging away the sand to 
undermine it, and so to make it fall down, setting pieces of wood to 
thrust and guide it right in the ML 

But when I had done this, I was unable to stir it up again, or to get 
under it^ much less to move it forwards towards the water ; so I was 
forced to give it over : and yet, though I gave over hopes of the boat, 
my desire to venture over for the main increased, rather than decreased, 
as the means for it seemed impossible. 

This at length set me upon thinking whether it was not possible to 
make myself a canoe or periagua, such as the natives of those climates 
make, even without tools, or as I might say, without hands, namely of 
the trunk of a great tree. This I not only thought possible, but easy ; 
and pleased myself extremely with my thoughts of making it, and with 
my having much more convenience for it than any of the Negroes or 
Indians ; but not at all considering the particular inconveniences 
which I lay under more than the Indians did, namely want of hands 
to move it into the water, when it was made ; a difficulty much harder 
for me to surmount than all the consequences of want of tools could be 
to them. But my thoughts were so intent upon my voyage over the 
sea in it, that I never once considered how I should get it off the land ; 
and it was really in its own nature more easy for me to guide it over 
forty-five miles of sea, than about forty-five fathom of land, where it lay, 
to set it afloat in the water. 

I went to work upon this boat the most like a fool that ever man 
did, who had any of his senses awake. I pleased myself with the 
design, without determining whether I was ever able to undertake it ; 
not but that the difficulty of launching my boat came often into my 
head; but I put a stop to my own inquiries into it by this foolish 
answer which I gave myself ; Let me first make it, I wiU warrant I 
AviU find some way or other to get it along when it is done. 

This was a most preposterous method; but the eagerness of my 
fancy prevailed, and to work I went, and felled a cedar tree. I question 
much whether Solomon ever had such a one for the building the 
temple of Jerusalem. It was five feet ten inches diameter at the lower 
part next the stump, and four feet eleven inches diameter at the end 
of twenty-two feet, after which it lessened for a while and then parted 
into branches. It was not without infinite labour that I felled this 
tree ; I was twenty days hacking and hewing at it at the bottom ; I 
was fourteen more getting the branches and limbs and the vast 



of Robinson Crusoe^ 99. 

spreading head of it cut off, which I hacked and hewed through with 
my axe and hatchet, with inexpressible labour ; after this it cost me a 
month to shape it and dub it to a proportion, and to something like the 
bottom of a boat, that it might swim upright as it ought. It cost me near 
three months more to clear the inside, and work it out so as to make an 
exact boat of it j this I did indeed without fire, by mere mallet and 
chisel, and by the dint of hard labour ; till I had brought it to be a very 
handsome periagua, and big enough to have carried six-and- twenty men, 
and consequently big enough to have carried me and all my cargo. 

When I had gone through this work, I was extremely delighted 
with it : the boat was really much bigger than I ever saw a canoe or 
periagua, that was made of one tree, in my life. Many a weary stroke 
it had cost, you may be sure, for there remained nothing but to get 
it into the water; and had I gotten it into the water, I make no 
question but I should have begun the maddest voyage, and the most 
unlikely to be performed, that ever waa undertaken. 

But all my devices to get it into the water failed me, though they 
cost infinite labour too ; it lay about one hundred yards from the water, 
and not more ; but the first inconvenience was, it was up hill towards 
the creek. Well, to take away this discouragement, I resolved to dig 
into the surface of the earth, and so make a declivity ; this I began, 
and it cost me a prodigious deal of pains ; but who grudge pains that 
have their deliverance in view ] * But when this was worked through, 
and this difficulty managed, it was still much at one ; for I could no 
more stir the canoe than I could the other boat. 

Then I measured the distance of ground, and resolved to cut a dock, 
or canal, to bring the water up to the canoe, seeing I could not bring 
the canoe down to the water. Well, I began this work, and when 
I began to enter into it, and calculated how deep it was to be dug, 
how broad, how the stuff to be thrown out, I found that by the 
number of hands I had, being none but my own, it must have been ten 
or twelve years before I should have gone through with it j for the 
shore lay high, so that at the upper end it must have been at least 
twenty feet deep ; so at length, though with great reluctancy, I gave 
this attempt over also. 

This grieved me heartily; and now I saw, though too late, the folly 
of beginning a work before we count the cost, and before we judge 
rightly of our own strength to go through with it. 

In the middle of this work I finished my fourth year in this place, 
and kept my anniversary with the same devotion, and with as much 
comfort, as ever before ; for by a constant study, and serious application 

H 2 



100 The Life and Adventures 

of the w(»(i of God, and by the assistance of his grace, I gained a dif- 
ferent knowledge from what I had before. I entertained different 
notions of things ; I looked now upon the world as a thing remote ; 
which I had nothing to do with, no expectation from, and indeed no 
desires about : in a word, I had nothing indeed to do with it, nor was 
ever like to have ; so I thought it looked, as we may perhaps look upon 
it hereafter, namely as a place I had lived in, but was come out of it. 
And well might I say, as Father Abraham to Dives, " Between me and 
thee there is a great gulph fixed." 

In the first place, I was removed from all the wickedness of the 
world here : I had neither the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye, or 
the pride of life : I had nothing to covet, for I had all I was now 
capable of enjoying. I was lord of the manor ; or, if I pleased, I might 
call myself king or emperor over the whole country which I had pos- 
session of ; there were no rivals : I had no competitor, none to dispute 
sovereignty or command with me. I might have raised ship-loadings 
of com, but I had no use for it ; so I let as little grow as I thought 
enough for my occasion : I had tortoises, or turtles enough ; but now 
and then one was as much as I could put to any use : I had timber 
enough to have built a fleet of ships ; I had grapes enough to have made 
wine, or to have cured into raisins, to have loaded that fleet when they 
had been built. 

I had, as I hinted before, a parcel of money, as well gold as silver, 
about thirty-six pound sterling ; alas ! there the nasty, sorry, useless 
stuff lay ; I had no manner of business for it, and I often thought with 
myself, that I would have given a handful of it for a gross of tobacco- 
pipes, or for a hand-mill to grind my corn ; nay, I would have given 
it all for six-penny worth of turnip and carrot seed out of England, or 
for a handful of peas and beans, and a bottle of ink. 

I had now been here so long, that many things which I brought on 
shore for my help, were either quite gone, or very much wasted, and 
near spent. My ink, as I observed, had been gone for some time, all 
but a very little, which I eked out with water a little and a little, till 
it was so pale it scarce left any appearance of black upon the paper. 
As long as it lasted, I made use of it to minute down the days of the 
month on which any remarkable thing happened to me, and first, by 
casting up times past, I remembered that there was a strange con- 
currence of days, in the various providences which befel me, and 
which, if I had been superstitiously inclined to observe days as fatal or 
fortunate, I might have had reason to have looked upon with a great 
deal of curiosity. 



of Robinson Crusoe. 101 

First, I had observed, that the same day that I broke away from my 
father and my friends, and ran away to Hull in order to go to sea, the 
same day afterwards I was taken by the Sallee. man of war, and made 
a slave. 

The same day of the year that I escaped out of the wreck of that 
ship in Yarmouth Eoads, that same day of the year afterwards I made 
my escape from Sallee in the boat 

The same day of the year I was bom on, namely, the 30th of 
September, the same day I had my life so miraculously saved 26 years 
after, when I was cast on shore in this island ; so that my wicked life, 
and solitary life, both began on a day. 

The next thing to my ink being wasted, was that of my bread, I 
mean the biscuit which I brought out of the ship. This I had 
husbanded to the last degree, allowing myself but one cake of bread a 
day for above a year, and yet I was quite without bread for near a year 
before I got any corn of my own ; and great reason I had to be thank- 
ful that I had any at all, the getting it being, as has been already 
observed, next to miraculous. 

My clothes too began to decay mightily : as to linen, I had had 
none a good while, except some chequered shirts which I found in the 
chests of the other seamen, and which I carefully preserved, because 
many times I could bear no other clothes on but a shirt ; and it was a 
very great help to me, that I had among all the men*s clothes of the 
ship almost three dozen of shirts. There were also several thick 
watch-coats of the seamen's, which were left indeed, but they were too 
hot to wear ; and though it is true, that the weather was so violent hot 
that there was no need of clothes, yet I could not go quite naked ; no, 
though I had been inclined to it, which I was not ; nor could I abide 
the thoughts of it, though I was all alone. 

One reason why I could not go quite naked, was, I could not bear 
the heat of the sun so well when quite naked, as with some clothes on ; 
nay, the very heat frequently blistered my skin ; whereas, with a shirt 
on, the air itself made some motion, and whistling under the shirt, was 
twofold cooler than without it. No more could I ever bring myself to 
go out in the heat of the sun without a cap or hat ; the heat of the 
sun beating with such violence as it does in that place, would give me 
the headach presently, by darting so directly on my head, without a cap 
or hat on, so that I could not bear it ; whereas if I put on my hat, it 
would presently go away. 

Upon these views I began to consider about putting the few rags I 
had, which I called clothes, into some order. I had worn out all the 



102 Tlie Life and Adventures 

-^jlistcoats I had, and my business was now to try if I could not make 
jackets out of the ^eat watch-coats which I had by me, and with such 
other materials as I had ; so I set to work a-tailoring, or rather indeed 
a-botching ; for I made most piteous work of it. However, I made 
shift to make two or three waistcoats, which I hoped would serve me 
a great while ; as for breeches or drawers, I made but a very sorry shift 
indeed, till afterwards. 

I have mentioned that I saved the skins of aU the creatures that I 
killed, I mean four-footed ones ; and I had hung them up stretched out 
with sticks in the sun, by which means some of them were so dry and 
hard, that they were fit for little ; but others, it seems, were very useful 
The first thing I made of these was a great cap for my head, with the 
hair on the outside to shoot oflP the rain, and this I performed so well, 
that after this I made a suit of clothes wholly of those skins ; that is to 
say, a waistcoat, and breeches open at the knees, and both loose ; for 
they were rather wanted to keep me cool, than to keep me warm. I 
must not omit to acknowledge, that they were wretchedly made ; for 
if I was a bad carpenter, I was a worse tailor ; however, they were such 
as I made very good shift with ; and when I was abroad, if it happened 
to rain, the hair of the waistcoat and cap being outmost, I was kept 
very dry. 

After this I spent a deal of time and pains to make me an umbrella. 
I was indeed in great want of one, and had a great mind to make one. 
1 had seen them made in the Brasils, where they are very useful in the 
great heats which are there ; and I felt th« heats every jot as great here, 
and greater too, being nearer the equinox ; besides, as I was obliged to 
be much abroad, it was a most useful thing to me, as well for the rains 
as the heats. I took a world of pains at it, and was a great while 
before I could make anything likely to hold ; nay, after I thought I 
had hit the way, I spoiled two or three before I made one to my mind; 
but at last I made one that answered indifferently well; the main 
difiiculty I found was to make it to let down. I could make it to 
spread ; but if it did not let down too, and draw in, it would not be 
portable for me any way, but just over my head, which would not do. 
However, at last, as I said, I made one to answer. I covered it with 
skins, the hair upwards, so that it cast off the rain like a pent-house, 
and kept off the sun so effectually, that I could walk out in the hottest 
of the weather, with greater advantage than I could before in the coolest ; 
and when I had no need of it, I could close it, and carry it under 
my arm. 

Thus I lived mighty comfortably, my mind being entirely composed 



of Robinson Crusoe, 



103 



by resigning to the will of God, and throwing myself wholly upon ttie 
disposal of his Providence. 

I cannot say, that after this, for five years, any extraordinary thing 
happened to me ; but I lived on in the same course, in the same posture 
and place just as before ; the chief thing I was employed in, besides 
my yearly labour of planting my barley and rice, and curing my raisins, 
of both which I always kept up just enough to have sufficient stock of 
the year's provisions beforehand ; I say, besides this yearly labour, and 
my daily labour of going out with my gun, I had one labour to make 
me a canoe, which at last I finished : so that by digging a canal to it 
six feet wide, and four feet deep, I brought it into the creek, almost 
haKa mila 




However, though my little periagua was finished, yet the size of it 
was not at all answerable to the desigi^ which I had in view, when I 
made the first ; I mean of venturing over to the terra firma, where it 
was above forty miles broad ; accordingly, the smallness of my boat, 
assisted to put an end to that design, and now I thought no more of 
it But as I had a boat, my next design was to make a tour round the 
island ; for as I had been on the other side, in one place, crossing, as I 
have already described it^ over the land, so the discoveries I made in 
that journey, made me very eager to see other parts of the coast ; and 
now I had a boat, I thought of nothing but sailing round the island. 

For this purpose, and that I might do everything with discretion 
and consideration, I fitted up a little mast to my boat, and made a sail 



104} The Life and Adventures 

to it out of some of the pieces of the ship's sails, which lay in store, 
and of which I had a great store by me. 

Having fitted my mast and sail, and tried the boat, I found she 
would sail very welL Then I made little lockers and boxes at each end 
of my boat, to put provisions, necessaries, and ammunition, &c. into, 
to be kept dry, either from rain, or the spray of the sea ; and a little 
long hollow place I cut in the inside of the boat, where I could lay my 
gun, making a flap to hang down over it to keep it dry. 

I fixed my umbrella also in a step at the stem, like a mast, to stand 
over my head, and keep the heat of the sun off me, like an awning ; 
and thus I every now and then took a little voyage upon the sea, but 
never went far out, nor far from the little creek. But at last, being 
eager to view the circumference of my little kingdom, I resolved upon 
my tour, and accordingly I victualled my ship for the voyage ; putting 
in two dozen of my loaves (cakes I should rather call them) of barley- 
bread ; an earthen pot full of parched rice, a food I ate a great deal of ; 
a little bottle of rum, half a goat, and powder with shot for killing 
more, and two large watch-coats, of those which, as I mentioned before, 
I had saved out of the seamen's chests ; these I took, one to lie upon, 
and the other to cover me in the night. 

It was the sixth of November, in the sixth year of my reign, or my 
captivity, which you please, that I set out on this voyage, and I found 
it much longer than I expected : for though the island itself was not 
very large, yet when I came to the east side of it, I found a great ledge 
of rocks lie out about two leagues into the sea, some above water, some 
under it ; and beyond this a shoal of sand, lying dry half a league 
more ; so that I was obliged to go a great way out to sea to double 
that point. 

When I first discovered them, I was going to give over my enter- 
prise, and come back again, not knowing how far it might oblige me 
to go out to sea, and above all, doubting how I should get back again ; 
so I came to an anchor, for I had made me a kind of an anchor, with 
a piece of broken grappling which I got out of the ship. 

Having secured my boat, I took my gun, and went on shore, climbing 
up a hill, which seemed to overlook that point, where I saw the full 
extent of it, and resolved to venture. 

In my viewing the sea from that lull where I stood, I perceived a 
strong, and indeed, a most furious current, which ran to the east, and 
even came close to the point ; and I took the more notice of it, because 
I saw there might be some danger, that when I came into it, I might 
be carried out to sea by the strength of it, and not be able to make the 



of Robinson Crusoe, 105 

island again. And indeed, had I not gotten first upon this hill, I believe 
it would have been so ; for there was the same current on the other 
side of the island, only that it set it off at a farther distance ; and I 
saw there was a strong eddy under the shore ; so I had nothing to do 
but to get out of the first current, and I should presently be in an eddy. 

I lay here, however, two days ; because the wind blowing pretty fresh 
(E. at S.E. and that being just contrary to the said current) made a 
great breach of the sea upon the point ; so that it was not safe for me 
to keep too close to the shore for the breach, nor to go too far off 
because of the stream. 

The third day in the morning, the wind having abated over-night, 
the sea was calm, and I ventured ; but I am a warning-piece again to 
all rash and ignorant pilots ; for no sooner was I come to the point, 
when I was not my boat's length from the shore, but I found myself 
in a great depth of water, and a current like the sluice of a mill It 
carried my boat along with it with such violence, that all I could do 
could not keep her so much as on the edge of it : but I found it 
hurried me farther and farther out from the eddy, which was on the 
left hand. There was no wind stirring to help me, and all that I could 
do with my paddles signified nothing. And now I begaiji to give myself 
over for lost : for, as the current was on both sides the island, I knew 
in a few leagues* distance they must join again, and then I was irre- 
coverably gone ; nor did I see any possibility of avoiding it : so that I 
had no prospect before me but of perishing ; not by the sea, for that 
was calm enough, but of starving for hunger. I had indeed found a 
, tortoise on the shore, as big almost as I could lift, and had tossed it 
into the boat ; and I had a great jar of fresh water, that is to say, one 
of my earthen pots. But what was aU this to being driven into the 
vast ocean, where, to be sure, there was no shore, no main land or 
island, for a thousand leagues at least ! 

And now I saw how easy it was for the providence of God to make 
the most miserable condition that mankind could be in worse, Now I 
looked back upon my desolate solitary island, as the most pleasant place 
in the world, and that all the happiness my heart could wish for, was 
to be there again. I stretched out my hands to it with eager wishes. 
happy desert, said I, I shall never see thee more I miserable creature ! 
said I, whither am I going ] Then I reproached myself with my unthank- 
ful temper, and how I had repined at my solitary condition. And now 
what would I give to be on shore there again ! Thus we never see the 
true state of our condition, till it is illustrated to us by its contraries ; 
nor know how to value what we enjoy, but by the want of it It is 



106 The Life and Adventures 

scarce possible to imagine the consternation I was now in, being driven 
from my beloved island (for so it appeared to me now to be) into the 
wide ocean, almost two leagues, and in the utmost despair of ever 
recovering it again. However, I worked hard, till indeed my strength 
was almost exhausted ; and kept my boat as much to the northward, 
that is, towards the side of the current which the eddy lay on, as 
possibly I could ; when about noon, as the sun passed the meridian, 
I thought I felt a little breeze of wind in my face, springing up from 
the S.S.E. This cheered my heart a little, and especially when in 
about half an hour more, it blew a pretty small gentle gale. By this 
time I was gotten at a frightful distance from the island ; and, had the 
least cloud or hazy weather intervened, I had been undone another way 
too ; for I had no compass on board, and should never have known 
how to have steered towards the island,. if I had but once lost sight of 
it. But the weather continuing clear, I applied myself to get up my 
mast again, and spread my sail, standing away to the north as much 
as possible, to get out of the current. 

Just as I had set my mast and sail, and the boat began to stretch 
away, I saw even by the clearness of the water, some alteration of the 
current was near ; for where the current was so strong, the water was 
fouL But perceiving the water clear, I found the current abate, and 
presently I found to the east, at about half a mile, a breach of the sea 
upon some rocks. These rocks I found caused the current to part again ; 
and as the main stress of it ran away more southerly, leaving the rocks 
to the north-east, so the other returned by the repulse of the rock, and 
made a strong eddy, which ran back again to the north-west with a , 
very sharp stream. 

They who know what it is to have a reprieve brought to them upon 
the ladder, or to be rescued from thieves just going to murder them, or 
who have been in such like extremities, may guess what my present 
surprise of joy was, and how gladly I put my boat into the stream of 
this eddy. And the wind also freshening, how gladly I spread my sail 
to it, running cheerfully before the wind, and with a strong tide or eddy 
under foot. 

This eddy carried me about a league in my way back again directly 
towards the island, but about two leagues more towards the northward 
than the current lay, which carried me away at first ; so that when I 
came near the island, I found myself open to the northern shore of it, 
that is to say, the other end of the island, opposite to that which I 
went out from. 

When I had made something more than a league of way by the help 



of BdbinBOn Crmoe. 107 

of this current or eddy, I found it was spent, and served me no farther. 
However, I found, that being between the two great currents, namely 
that on the south side which had hurried me away, and that on the north, 
which lay about two leagues on the other side ; I say, between these 
two, in the west of the island, 1 found the water at least still, and 
running no way ; and having still a breeze of wind fair for me, I kept 
on steering directly for the island, though not making such fresh way 
as I did before. 




About four o'clock in the evening, being then within about a league of 
the island, I stretched across this eddy, slanting north-west, and in about 
an hour came within about a mile of the shore : it being smooth water, 
I soon got to land. 

When I was on shore, I fell on my knees, and gave God thanks for 
my deliverance, resolving to lay aside all thoughts of my deliverance 
by my boat ; and refreshing myself with such things as I had, I 
brought my boat close to the shore, in a little cove that I had espied 
under some trees, and laid me down to sleep, being quite spent with 
the labour and fatigue of the voyage. 

I was now at a great loss which way to get home with my boat. I 
had run so much hazard, and knew too much the case, to think of 
attempting it by the way I went out ; and what might be at the other 
side (I mean the west side) I knew not, nor had I any mind to run 
any more ventures ; so I only resolved in the morning to make my way 
westward along the shore, and to see if there was no creek where I

talking to me, Poor Robin Crusoe, and how did I come here % and 
where had I been ] just as if he had been overjoyed to see me again ; 
and so I carried him home along with me. 

I had enough of rambling to sea for some time, and enough to do for 
many days to sit still, and reflect upon the danger I had been in. I 
would have been very glad to have had my boat again on my side of 
the island, but I knew not how it was practicable to get it about. As 
to the east side of the island, which I had gone round, I knew well 
enough there was no venturing that way; my very heart would shrink, 
and my very blood run chill, but to think of it ; and as to the other 
side of the island, I did not know how it might be there; but supposing 
the current ran with the same force against the shore at the east^ as it 
passed by it on the other, I might run the same risk of being driven 
down the stream, and carried by the island, as I had been before of 
being carried away from it : so with these thoughts I contented myself 
to be without any boat, though it had been the product of so many 
months' labour to make it, and of so many more to get it into the sea. 

In this government of my temper I remained near a year, lived a very 
sedate retired life, as you may well suppose j and my thoughts being 
very much composed, as to my condition, and fully comforted in 
resigning myself to the dispensations of Providence, I thought I lived 
really very happily in all things except that of society. 

I improved myself, in this time, in all the mechanic exercises which 
my necessities put me upon applying myself to ; and I believe could, 
upon occasion, have made a very good carpenter, especially considering 
how few tools I had. 

Besides this, I arrived at an unexpected perfection in my earthen- 
ware, and contrived well enough to make them with a wheel, which I 
found infinitely easier and better, because I made things round and 
shapeable, which before were filthy things indeed to look on. But I 
think I never was more vain of my own performance, or more joyful 
for anything I found out, than for my being able to make a tobacco- 
pipe ; and though it was a very ugly, clumsy thing when it was done, 
and only burnt red like other earthen-ware, yet as it was hard and 
firm, and would draw the smoke, I was exceedingly comforted with it; 
for I had been always used to smoke, and there were pipes in the ship, 
but I forgot them at first, not knowing there was tobacco in the island; 
and afterwards when I searched the ship again, I could not come at 
any pipes at aU. 

In my wicker-ware I also improved much, and made abundance of 
necessary baskets, as well as my invention shewed me, though not very 



110 The Life and Adventures 

handsome, yet convenient for my laying things up in, or fetching things 
home in. For example, if I killed a goat abroad, I could hang it up 
in a tree, flay it, and dress it, and cut it in pieces, and bring it home 
in a basket ; and the like by a turtle : I could cut it up, take out the 
eggs, and a piece or two of the flesh, which was enough for me, and 
bring them home in a basket, and leave the rest behind me : also large 
deep baskets were my receivers for my com, which I always rubbed 
out as soon as it was dry, and cured ; and kept it in great baskets 
instead of a granary. 

i began now to perceive my powder abated considerably ; and this 
was a want which it was impossible for me to supply : then I began 
seriously to consider what I must do when I should have no more 
powder ; that is to say, how should I do to kill any goats. I had, as 
I observed, in the third year of my being here, kept a young kid, and 
bred her tame. I was in hopes of getting a he-kid, but I could not by 
any means bring it to pass, till my kid grew an old goat j and I could 
never find in my heart to kill her, till she died at last of mere age. 

But being now in the eleventh year of my residence, and, as I have 
said, my ammunition growing low, I set myself to study some art to 
trap and snare the goats, to see whether I could not catch some of 
them alive ; and particularly I wanted a she-goat great with young. 
To this purpose I made snares to hamper them ; and believe they were 
more than once taken in them ; but my tackle was not good, for I had 
no wire, and always found them broken, and my bait devoured. At 
length I resolved to try a pit-faU ; so I dug several large pits in the 
earth, in places where I had observed the goats used to feed, and over 
these pits I placed hurdles of my own making too, with a great weight 
upon them ; and several times I put ears of barley, and dry rice, without 
setting the trap ; and I could easily perceive that the goats had gone 
in, and eaten up the com, for I could see the mark of their feet : at 
length, I set three traps in one night, and going the next morning, I 
found them all standing, and yet the bait eaten and gone. This was 
very discouraging ; however, I altered my trap ; and, not to trouble 
you with particulars, going one morning to see my traps, I found in 
one of them a large old he-goat ; and, in one of the others, three kids, 
a male and two females. 

As to the old one, I knew not what to do with him ; he was so fierce 
I durst not go into the pit to him ; that is to say, to go about to bring 
him away alive, which was what I wanted ; I could have killed him, 
but that was not my business, nor would it answer my end ; so I e'en 
let him out, and he ran away as if he had been frightened out of his 



of Robinson Crusoe. Ill 

wits ; but I did not then know what I afterwards learned, that hnnger 
would tame a lion : if I had let him stay there three or four days 
without food, and then have carried him some water to drink, and then 
a little com, he would have been as tame as one of the kids ; for they 
are mighty sagacious, tractable creatures, where they are well used. 

However, for the present I let him go, knowing no better at that 
time ; then I went to the three kids ; and taking them one by one, I 
tied them with strings together; and with some dijficulty brought 
them all home. 

It was a good while before they would feed; but throwing them some 
sweet com, it tempted them, and they began to be tame : and now I found 
that if I expected to supply myself with goat's flesh, when I had no 
powder or shot left, breeding some up tame was my only way, when 
perhaps I might have them about my house like a flock of sheep. But 
then it presently occurred to me, that I must keep the tame from the 
wild, or else they would always run wild when they grew up ; and the 
only way for this was to have some enclosed piece of ground, weU 
fenced either with hedge or pale, to keep them in so effectually, that 
those within might not break out, or those without break in. 

This was a great undertaking for one pair of hands ; yet as I saw 
there was an absolute necessity of doing it, my first piece of work was 
to find out a proper piece of ground ; namely, where there was likely 
to be herbage for them to eat, water for them to drink, and cover to 
keep them from the sun. 

Those who understand such enclosures, will think I had very little 
contrivance, when I pitched upon a place very proper for all these, 
being a plain open piece of meadow-land, or savanna (as our people call 
it in the western colonies) which had two or three little rills of fresh 
water in it, and at one end was very woody ; I say they will smile at my 
forecast, when I shall tell them I began my enclosing of this piece of 
ground in such a manner, that my hedge, or pale, must have been at 
least two nules about ; nor was the madness of it so great as to the 
compass ; for if it was ten miles about, I was like to have time enough 
to do it in; but I did not consider, that my goats would be as wild 
in so much compass, as if they had had the whole island; and 
I should have so much room to chase them in, that I should never 
catch them. 

My hedge was began and carried on, I believe, about fifty yards, 
when this thought occurred to me ; so I presently stopped short, and 
for the first beginning I resolved to enclose a piece of about 150 yards 
in length, and 100 yards in breadth, which as it would maintain as 



112 The Life and Adventures 

many as I should have in any reasonable time, so, as my flock increased, 
I could add more ground to my enclosure. 

This was acting with some prudence, and I went to work with 
courage. I wa^ about three months edging in the first piece ; and till 
I had done it^ I tethered the three kids in the best part of it, and used 
them to feed as near me as possible, to make them familiar ; and very 
often I would go and carry them some ears of barley, or a handful of 
rice, and feed them out of my hand; so that after my enclosure was 
finished, and I let them loose, they would follow me up and down, 
bleating after me for a handful of com. 

This answered my end, and in about a year and a half I had a flock 
of about twelve goats, kids and all ; and in two years more I had 
three-and-forty, besides several I took and killed for my food ; and 
after that I enclosed five several pieces of ground to feed them in, with 
little pens to drive them into, to take them as I wanted them ; and 
gates out of one piece of ground into another. 

But this was not all ; for now I not only had goafs-flesh to feed on 
when I pleased, but nulk too, a thing which indeed in my beginning I 
did not so much as think of, and which, when it came into my thoughts, 
was really an agreeable surprise ; for now I sat up my dairy, and had 
sometimes a gallon or two of milk in a day. And as Nature, who 
gives supplies of food to every creature, dictates even naturally how to 
make use of it, so I, that had never milked a cow, much less a goat, 
or seen butter or cheese made, very readily and handily, though after a 
great many essays and miscarriages, made me both butter and cheese at 
last, and never wanted it afterwards. 

How mercifully can our great Creator treat his creatures, even in those 
conditions in which they seemed to be overwhelmed in destruction ! 
How can he sweeten the bitterest providences, and give us cause to 
praise him for dungeons and prisons ! What a table was here spread 
for me in a wilderness, where I saw nothing at first but to perish for 
hunger ! 

It would have made a stoic smile, to have seen me and my little 
family sit down to dinner ; there was my majesty, the prince and lord 
of the whole island ; I had the lives of all my subjects at absolute 
command ; I could hang, draw, give liberty, and take it away, and no 
rebels among all my subjects ! 

Then to see how like a king I dined too, all alone, attended by my 
servants ! Poll, as if he had been my favourite, was the only person 
permitted to talk to me ; my dog, which was now grown old and crazy, 
and found no species to multiply his kind upon, sat always at my 



of Rohinaon Crusoe. 118 

light hand ; and two cats, one on one side the table, and one on the 
other, expecting now and then a bit from my hand as a mark of special 
fevour. 




But these were not the two cats which I brought on shore at first ; 
for they were both of them dead, and had been interred near my 
habitation by my own hands ; but one of them having multiplied by 
I know not what kind of creature, these were two which I preserved 
tame, whereas the rest ran wild into the woods, and became indeed 
troublesome to me at last ; for they would often come into my house, 
and plunder me too, till at last I was obliged to shoot them, aud did 
kiU a great many. At length they left me with this attendance, and 
in this plentiful manner I lived ; neither could I be said to want 
anything but society, and of that, in some time after this, I was like 
to have too much. 

I was something impatient, as I have observed, to have the use of 
my boat, though very loth to run any more hazard : and therefore 
sometimes I sat contriving ways to get her about the island, and at 
other times I sat myself down contented enough without her. But I 
had a strange uneasiness in my mind to go down to the point of the 
island, where, as I have said, in my last ramble, I went up the hill to 
see how the shore lay, and how the current set, that I might see what 
I had to do : this inclination increased upon me every day ; and at 
length I resolved to travel thither by land, and following tiie edg9 of 
the shore, I did so : but had any one in England been to meet such a 
man as I was, it must either have frighted them or raised a great deal 
of laughter ; and, as I frequently stood stiU to look at myself I could 



114 The Life and Adventures 

not but smile at the notion of my travelling througli Yorksliire with 
sncli an equipage, and in such a dress. I had a great high shapeless 
cap, made of goat's-skin, with a flap hanging down behind, as well to 
keep the sun from me, as to shoot the rain off firom running into my 
neck ; nothing being so hurtful in these climates as the rain upon the 
flesh under the clothes. I had a short jacket of goat's-skin, the skirts 
coming down to about the middle of my thighs, and a pair of open- 
kneed breeches of the same ; the breeches were made of the skin of 
an old he-goat^ whose Jiair hung down such a length on either side, 
that, like pantaloons, it reached to "the middle of jny legs. Stock- 
ings and shoes I had none ; but I made me a pair of something, I 
scarce know what to call them, like buskins, to flap over my legs, and 
lace on eitiier side like spatterdashes; butof a most barbarous shape, 
as indeed were all the rest of my clothes. 

I had on a broad belt of goat's-skin dried, which I drew together 
with two thongs of the same, instead of buckles ; and in a kind of 
frog on either side of this, instead of a sword and dagger, hung a 
little saw and hatchet ; one on one side, one on the other : I had 
another bdt not so broad, and feistened in the same manner, which 
hung over iny shoulder ; and at the end of it, under my left arm, 
hung two pouches, both made of goat's-skin too ; in one of which 
hung my powder, in the other my shot : at my back I carried my 
basket, on my shoulder my gun, and over my head a great clumsy 
ugly goat's-skin umbrella, but which, after all, was the most necessary 
thing I had about me, next to my gun ; as for my face, the colour of 
it was really not so Mulatto-like as one might expect from a man not 
at all careful of it, and living within nine or ten degrees of the equinox. 
My beard I had once suffered to grow till it was about a quarter of a 
yard long ; but, as I had both scissors and razors sufficient, I had cut 
it pretty short, except what grew on my upper lip, which I had 
trimmed into a large pair of Mahometan whiskers, such as I had seen 
worn by some Turks whom I saw at Sallee : for the Moors did not 
wear such though the Turks did. Of these mustachios, or whiskers, 
I wiU not say they were long enough to hang my hat upon them ; 
but they were of length and shape monstrous enough, and such as in 
England would have passed for frightful 

But aU this is by-the-bye ; for, as to my figure, I had so few to 
observe me that it was no manner of consequence, so I say no more 
to that part : in this kind of figure I went my new journey, and was 
out five or six days. I travelled first along the sea-shore, directly to 
the place where I first brought my boat to an anchor to get up upon 



of Eobinaon Crusoe. 116 

the rocks ; and, having no boat now to take care of, I went over the 
land a nearer way to the same height that I was upon before ; when 
looking forward to the point of the rock which I was obliged to 
double with my boat, as I said above, I was surprised to see the sea all 
smooth and quiet ; no rippling, no motion, no current, any more there 
than in other places. 

I was at a strange loss to understand this, and resolved to spend 
some time in the observing of it, to see if nothing from the sets of the 
*tide had occasioned it ; but I was presently convinced how it was ; 
namely, that the tide of ebb setting from the west, and joining with the 
current of waters from some great river on the shore, must be the occa- 
sion of this current ; and that according as the wind blew more forcibly 
from the west, or from the north, this current came nearer or went 
farther from the shore ; for, waiting thereabouts till evening, I went up 
to the rock again, and then the tide of ebb being made, I plainly saw 
the current again as before, only that it ran farther of^ being near half 
a league from the shore : whereas in my case it set close upon the shore, 
and hurried me and my canoe along with it, which at another time it 
woxdd not have done. 

This observation convinced me, that I had nothing to do but to 
observe the ebbing and the flowing of the tide, and I might very easily 
bring my boat about the island again. But when I began to think of 
putting it in practice I had such a terror upon my spirits at the remem- 
brance of the danger I had been in, that I could not think of it again 
with any patience ; but, on the contrary, I took up another resolution, 
which was more safe though more laborious ; and this was, that I would 
build, or rather make me another periagua, or canoe, and so have one 
for one side of the island, and one for the other. 

You are to understand that now I had, as I may call it, two planta- 
tions in the island j one, my little fortiJication or tent, with the wall 
about it under the rock, with the cave behind me, which by this time 
I had enlarged iato several apartments or caves, one within another. 
One of these, which was the driest and largest, and had a door yet 
beyond my waU or fortification, that is to say, beyond where my wall 
joined to the rock, was all filled up with lai^ earthen pots, of which 
I have given an account, and with fourteen or fifteen great baskets, 
which would hold five or six bushels e^ch, where I laid up my stores 
of provision, especially my com, some in the ear cat off short from the 
straw, and the other rubbed out with my hands. 

As for my wall, made as before, with long stakes or piles, those pileg 
grew all like trees, and were by this time grown so big, and spread so

very much, that there was not the leaet^ppearance, to any one's Aaew, 
of any habitation behind them. 

Near this dwelling of mine, but a little farther within the land, and 
upon lower ground, lay my two pieces of comTground, which I kept 
duly cultivated and sowed, and which duly yielded me their harvest in 
its season; and whenever I had occasion for more corn I had more 
land adjoining as fit as that 

Besides this, I had my country-seat, and I had now a tolerable planta- 
tion tliere also ; for, first, I had my little bower, as I called it, which I 
kept in repair ; that is to say, I kept the hedge which circled it in 
constantly, fitted up to its usual height, the ladder standing always in 
the inside : I kept the trees, which at first were no more than my stakes, 
but were now, grown very firm and tall; I kept them always so cut, 
that they might spread and grow thick and wild, and make the more 
aj^a*eeable shade, which they did effectually to my mind. In the middle 
of this I had my tent always standing, being a piece of a sail spread 
over poles set up for that purpose, and which never wanted any repair 
or renewing ; and under this I had made me a squab or couch, with the 
skins of the creatures I had killed, and with other soft things, and 
a blanket laid on them, such as belonged to our sea-bedding, which I 
had saved, and a great watch-coat to cover me ; and here, whenever I 
had occasion to be absent from my chief seat, I took up my country 
habitatioiL 




Adjoining to this I had my enclosures for my -cattle, that is to say, 
my goats : and as I had taken an inconceivable deal of pains to fence 
and enclose this ground, I was so uneasy to see it kept entire, lest the 
goats should break through, that I never left ofl^ tiU with infinite labour 



of Robinson Crusoe,- 117 

I had stuck the outside- of the hedge so fall of small stakes, and so near 
to one another, that it was rather a pale than a hedge, and there was 
scarce room to put a hand through hetween them, which afterwards, 
when those stakes grew, as they all did in the next rainy season, made 
the enclostffe strong like a wall, indeed stronger than any walL 

This will testify for me that I was not idle, and that I spared no 
pains to Ining to pass whatever appeared necessary for my comfortable 
support ; for I considered the keeping up a breed of tame creatures thus 
at my hand would be a living magazine of flesh, milk, butter, and 
cheese, for mcj as long as I lived in the place, if it were to be- forty 
years ; and that keeping them in my reach depended -entirely upon my 
perfecting my enclosures to such a degree that I might be sure of 
keeping them together ; which by this method indeed I so effectually 
secured that, when these little stakes began to grow, I had planted them 
so very thick I was forced to pull some of them up again. 

In this place also I had my grapes growing, which I principally 
depended on for my winter store of raisins, and which I never failed to 
preserve very carefully as the best and most agreeable dainty of my 
whole diet; and indeed they were not only agreeable, but physical, 
wholesome, nourishing, and refreshing to the last degree. 

As this was also about half way between my other habitation and the 
place where I had laid up my boat, I generally staid and lay here in my 
way thither ; for I used frequently to visit my boat, and I kept all 
things about or belonging to her in very good order. Sometimes I went 
out in her to divert myself, but no more hazardous voyages would I go, 
nor scarce ever above a stone's cast or two from the shore, I was so 
apprehensive of being hurried out of my knowledge again by the cur- 
rents, or winds, or any other accident. But now I come to a new scene 
of my life. 

It happened one day about noon, going towards my boat, I was ex- 
ceedingly surprised with the print of a man's naked foot on the shore, 
which was very plain to be seen in the sand I stood like one thunder- 
struck, or as if I had seen an apparition. I listened, I looked round 
me, I could hear nothing, nor see anything ; I went up to a rising 
ground to look farther. I went up the shore, and down the shore, but 
it was all one, I could see no o^er impression but that one. I went 
to it again to see if there were any more, and to observe if it might 
not be my fsmcy, but there was no room for that, for there was exactly 
the very print of a foot, toes, heel, and 'every part of a foot : how it 
came thither I knew not, nor could in the leiast imagine. But after 
innumerable fluttering thoughts, like a man perfectly confused; and out 



118 The Lifo and Adventures 

of myself I came home to my fortification, not feeling, as we say, the 
ground I went on, but terrified to the last degree, looking behind me 
at every two or three steps, mistaking every bush and tree, and 
fEuicying every stump at a distance to be a man. Nor is it possible to 
describe how many various shapes an affiighted imagination represented 
things to me in j how many wild ideas were formed every moment in 
my fEuicy, and what strange unaccountable whimsies came into my 
thoughts by the way. 

When I came to my castle, for so I think I called it ever after this, 
I fled into it like one pursued ; whether I went over by the ladder, as 
first contrived, or went in at the hole in the rock, which I called a 
door, I cannot remember; no, nor could I remember the next morning; 
for never frighted hare fled to cover, or fox to earth, with more terror 
of mind than I to this retreat. 

I had no sleep that night ; the fsurther I was from the occasion of 
my fright the greater my apprehensions were; which is something 
contrary to the nature of such things, and especially to the usual 
practice of all creatures in fear. But I was so embarrassed with my 
own frightful ideas of the thing, that I formed nothing but dismal 
imaginations to myself, even though I was now a great way off it. 

At last I concluded that it must be some more dangerous creature ; 
namely, that it must be some of the savages of the main land over 
against me who had wandered out to sea in their canoes, and, either 
driven by the currents or by contrary winds, had made the island, 
and had been on shore, but were gone away again to sea, being as loth, 
perhaps, to have staid in this desolate island as I would have been to 
have had them. 

While these reflections were rolling upon my mind I was very 
thankful in my thought that I was so happy as not to be thereaboute 
at that time, or that they did not see my boat, by which they would 
have concluded that some inhabitants had been in the place, and 
perhaps have searched fSarther for me. Then terrible thoughts racked 
my imaginations about their having found my boat, and that there 
were people here ; and that, if so, I should certainly have them com© 
again in great numbers, and devour me ; that if it should happen so 
that they should not find me, yet they would find my enclosure, 
destroy all mj com, carry away all my flock of tame goats, and I 
should perish at last for mere want. 

Thus my fear banished all my religious hope ; all that former 
confidence in God which was founded upon such wonderful experience 
«s I had had of his goodness, now vanished ; as if he that had fed me 



cf Robinson Crtiso^. 119 

by miracle hitherto, could not preserve by his poiver the provisioii 
which he had made for me by his goodness. I reproached myself 
with my easiness, that would not sow any more com one year than 
would just serve me till the next season, as if no accident could 
V intervene to prevent my enjojring the crop that was upon the ground. 
And this I thought so just a reproof, that I resolved for the future to 
have two or three years' com before-hand, so that whatever might come, 
I might not perish for want of bread. 

These thoughts took me up many hours, days, nay, I may say, weeks 
and months ; and one particular effect of my cogitations on this occasion 
I cannot omit ; namely, one morning early, lying in my bed, and filled 
with thoughts about my danger from the appearance of savages, I found 
it discomposed me very much ; upon which those words of the Scripture 
came into my thoughts, " Call upon me in the day of trouble, and I 
will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me." 

In the middle of these cogitations, apprehensions and reflections, it 
came into my thoughts one day, that all this might be a mere chimera 
of my own, and that this foot might be the print of my own foot when 
I came on shore from my boat This cheered me up a little too, and I 
began to persuade myself it was all a delusion; that it was nothing else 
but my own foot ; and why might not I come that way from the boat 
as well as I was going that way to the boat ? Again, I considered also 
that I could by no means tell for certain where I had trod, and where 
I had not ; and that, if at last this was only the print of my own foot, 
I had played the part of those fools, who strive to make stories of 
spectres and apparitions and then are themselves frighted at them 
more than anybody else. 

Now I began to take courage, and to peep abroad again ; for I had 
not stirred out of my castle for three days and nights, so that I began 
to starve for provision ; for I had little or nothing within doors but 
some barley-cakes and water. Then I knew that my goats wanted to 
be milked too, which usually was my evening diversion ; and the poor 
creatures were in great pain and inconvenience for want of it ; and 
indeed it almost spoiled some of them, and almost dried up their 
milk 

Heartening myself therefore with the belief, that this was nothing 
but the print of one of my own feet (and so I might be truly said to 
start at my own shadow), I began to go abroad again, and went to my 
country-house to milk my flock ; but to see with what fear I went 
forward, how often I looked behind me, how I was ready, every now 
and then, to lay down my basket, and run for my life ; it would have 



120 The Lijk and Adventures 

made any one have thought I was haimted with an evil conscience, or 
that I had been lately most terribly Mghted ; and so indeed I had. 

However, as I went down thus two or three days, and having seen 
nothing, I began to be a little bolder, and to think there was really 
nothing in it but my own imagination; but I could not persuade 
myself fully of this till I should go down to the shore again, and see 
this print of a foot, and measure it by my own, and see if there was 
any similitude of fitness, that I might be assured it was my own foot. 
But when I came to the place first, it appeared evidently to me, that 
when I laid up my boat I could not possibly be on shore anywhere 
thereabouts. Secondly, when I came to measure the mark with my 
own foot, I found my foot not so large by a great deal Both these 
things filled my head with new imaginations and gave me the vapours 
again to the highest degree, so that I shook with cold, like one in an 
ague, and I went home again, filled with the belief that some man or 
men had been on shore there; or, in short, that the island was inhabited, 
and I might be surprised before I was aware ; and what course to take 
for my security I knew not. 

This confusion of my thoughts kept me waking all night; but in the 
morning I fell asleep, and having by the amusement of my mind been, 
as it were, tired, and my spirits exhausted, I slept very soundly, and 
awaked much better composed than I had ever been before. And now 
I began to think sedately ; and, upon the utmost debate with myself, 
I concluded that this island, which was so exceeding pleasant, fruitful, 
and no farther from the main land than as I had seen, was not so 
entirely abandoned as I might imagine. That although there were no 
stated inhabitants who lived on the spot; yet that there might 
sometimes come boats off from the shore, who, either with design, 
or perhaps never but when they were driven by cross winds, might 
come to this place. 

That I had lived here fifteen years^ now and had not met with the 
least shadow or figure of any people before ; and that, if at any time 
they should be driven here, it was probable they went away again as 
soon as ever they could, seeing they had never thought fit to fix there 
upon any occasion to this time. 

That the most I could suggest any danger from was from any such 
casual accidental landing of straggling people from the main, who, as 
it was likely, if they were driven hither, were here against their wills ; 
BO they made no stay here but went off again with all possible speed, 
seldom staying one night on shore lest they should not have the help 
of the tides and day-light back again. And that therefore I had 



of Itobtnaon Crusoe. 



121 



noihliig to do bnt to consider of some safe retreat, in case I should see 
any savages land upon the spot 

Now I began sorely to repent that I had dug my cave so large as to 
bring a door through again, which door, as I said, came out beyond 
where my fortification joined to the rock. Upon maturely considering 
this, therefore, I resolved to draw me a second fortification, in the 
manner of a semicircle, at a distance fi'om my wall, just where I planted 
a double row of trees about twelve years before, of which I made 
mention : these trees having been planted so thick before there wanted 
but a few piles to be driven between them, that they should be thicker 
and stronger, and my wall would be finished 

So that I had now a double wall, and my outer wall was thickened 
with pieces of timber, old cables, and everything I could think of to 




make it strong ; having in it seven holes about as big as I might put 
my arm out at. In the inside of this I thickened my wall to about 
ten feet thick, continually bringing earth out of my cave, and laying 
it at the foot of the wall, and walking upon it ; and through the seven 
holes T contrived to plant the muskets, of which I took notice that I 
got seven on shore out of the ship ; these, I say, I planted like my 
cannon, and fitted them into frames that held them like a carriage, 
that so I could fire all the seven guns in two minutes' time : this wall 
I was many a weary month in finishing, and yet never thought myself 
safe tiU it was done. 

When this was done, I stuck all the ground without my wall, for a 
great way every way, as full with stakes or sticks of the osier-like 



122 The Life and Adventures 

wood, which I found so apt to grow, as they could well stand; insomuch 
that I believe I might set in near twenty thousand of them, leaving a 
pretty large space between them and my wall, that I might have room 
to see an enemy, and they might have no shelter from the young trees, 
if they attempted to approach my outer wall 

Thus in two years* time I had a thick grove, and in five or six years' 
time I had a wood before my dwelling, grown so monstrous thick and 
strong that it was indeed perfectly impassable ; and no man of what 
kind soever would ever imagine that there was anything beyond it, 
much less a habitation. As for the way I proposed myself to go in and 
out (for I left no avenue) it was by setting two ladders, one to a part 
of the rock which was low, and then broke in, and left room to place 
another ladder upon that ; so, when the two ladders were taken down, 
no man living could come down to me without mischiefing himself ; 
and if they had come down they were still on the outside of my outer 
walL 

Thus I took all the measures human prudence could suggest for my 
own preservation ; and it will be seen at length, that they were not 
altogether without just reason, though I foresaw nothing at that time 
more than my mere fear suggested 

While this was doing I was not altogether careless of my other 
affairs ; for I had a great concern upon me for my little herd of goats ; 
they were not only a present supply to me upon every occasion, and 
began to be sufficient for me, without the expense of powder and shot, 
but also abated the fatigue of my hunting after the wild ones ; and I 
was loath to lose the advantage of them, and to have them all to nurse 
up over again. 

To this purpose, after long consideration, I could think but of two 
ways to preserve them : one was to find another convenient place to 
dig a cave under ground, and to drive them into it every night ; and 
the other was to enclose two or three little bits of land, remote from 
one another, and as much concealed as I could, where I might keep 
about half a dozen young goats in each place ; so that if any disaster 
happened to the flock in general, I might be able to raise them agaiu 
with Httle trouble and time : and this, though it would require a great 
deal of time and labour, I thought was the most rational design. 

Accordingly I spent some time to find out the most retired parts of 
the island, and I pitched upon one, which was as private indeed as my 
heart could wish ; for it was a little damp piece of ground in the 
middle of the hollow and thick woods, where, as is observed, I abnost 
lost myself once before, endeavouring to eome back that way from the 



of Jtobinson Crusoe, 123 

eastern part of the island. Here I found a clear piece of land, near 
three acres, so surrounded with woods that it was almost an enclosure 
by nature ; at least it did not want near so much labour to make it so 
as the other pieces of ground I had worked so hard at. 

I immediately went to work with this piece of ground, and in less 
than a month's time I had so fenced it round that my flock or herd, 
call it which you please, which were not so wild now as at first they 
might be supposed to be, were well enough secured in it. So, without 
any fieirther delay, I removed ten she-goats and two he-goats to this 
piece ; and, when there, I continued to perfect the fence till I made it 
as secure as the other, which, however, I did at more leisure, and it 
took me up more time by a great deal. 

All this labour I was at the expense of purely from my apprehensions 
on the account of the print of a man's foot which I had seen ; for as 
yet I never saw any human creature come near the island, and I had 
now lived two years under these uneasinesses, which indeed made my 
life much less comfortable than it was before, as may well be imagined 
by any who know what it is to live in the constant snare of the fear of 
man. 

But to go on : after I had thus secured one part of my little living 
stock, I went about the whole island searching for another private 
place to make such another deposit ; when wandering more to the 
west point of the island than I had ever done yet, and looking out to 
sea, I thought I saw a boat upon the sea at a great distance. I had 
found a perspective glass or two in one of the seaman's chests, which 
I saved out of our ship ; but I had it not about me ; and this was so 
remote that I could not tell what to make of it, though I looked at it 
till my eyes were not able to look any longer. Whether it was a boat 
or not I do not know ; but as I descended from the hill I could see 
no more of it, so I gave it over, only I resolved to go no more without 
a perspective glass in my pocket. 

When I was come down the hill, to the end of the island, where indeed 
I had never been before, I was presently convinced that the seeing the 
print of a man's foot was not such a strange thing in the island as 
I imagined ; and, but that it was a special Providence that I was cast 
upon the side of the island where the savages never came, I should 
easily have known that nothing was more frequent than for the canoes 
from the main, when they happened to be a little too far out at sea, to 
shoot over to that side of the island for harbour; likewise, as they 
often met and fought in their canoes, the victors, having taken any 
prisoners, would bring them over to this shore, where, according to 



124* 



The Life and Adventures 



their dreadfiil customs, being all caBaibals, they woxdd kill and eat 
them : of which hereafter. 

When I was come down the hill to the shore, as I said above, being 
the S.W point of the island, I was perfectly confounded and amazed ; 
nor is it possible for me to express the horror of my mind at seeing 
the shore spread with skulls, hands, feet, and other bones of human 
bodies ] and particularly I observed a place where there had been a fire 
made, and a circle dug in the earth, like a cock-pit, where it is supposed 
the savage wretches had sat down to their inhuman feastings upon the 
bodies of their feUow-creatures. 




I was so astonished with the sight of these things that I entertained 
no notions of any danger to myseK from it for a long while ; all my 
apprehensions were buried in the thoughts of such a pitch of inhuman, 
hellish brutality, and the horror of the degeneracy of human nature ; 
which, though I had heard of often, yet I never had so near a view of 
before ; in short, I turned away my face from the horrid spectacle, my 
stomach grew sick, and I was just at the poiat of faiatiag, when nature 
discharged the disorder from my stomach, and, having vomited with an 
uncommon violence I was a little relieved, but could not bear to stay 
in the place a moment ; so I got me up the hill again with all the 
speed I could, and walked on towards my own habitation. 

When I came a little out of that part of the island I stood still 
awhile as amazed ; and then, recovering myself, I looked up with the 
utmost affection of my soul, and, with a flood of tears in my eyes, gave 
God thanks that had cast my first lot in a part of the world where I 



of Bobinson Crusoe* 126 

was distinguished fram such dreadful creatures as these ; and, though 
I had esteemed my present condition very miserable, had yet given me 
BO many comforts in it, that I had still more to give thanks for than 
to complain of; and this above all, that I had, even in this miserable 
condition, been comforted with the knowledge of himself and the hope 
of his blessing, which was a felicity more than sufficiently equivalent 
to aU the misery which I had suffered or could suffer. 

In this frame of thankfulness I went home to my castle, and began 
to be much easier now, as to the safety of my circumstances, than ever 
I was before ; for I observed that these wretches never came to this 
island in search of what they could get ; perhaps not seeking, nor 
wanting, or not expecting anything here ; and having often, no doubt, 
been up in the covered woody part of it without finding anything to 
their purpose. I knew I had been here now almost eighteen years 
and never saw the least footsteps of a human creature there before ; 
and might be here eighteen years more as entirely concealed as I was 
now if I did not discover myself to them, which I had no manner of 
occasion to do, it being my only business to keep myself entirely con- 
cealed where I was, unless I found a better sort of creatures than 
cannibals to make myself known to. 

Yet I entertained such an abhorrence of the savage wretches that I 
have been speaking of, and of the wretched inhuman custom of their 
devouring and eating one another up, that I continued pensive and sad, 
and kept close within my own circle for almost two years after this : 
when I say my own circle, I mean by it my three plantations, namely, 
my castle, my country-seat, which I called my bower, and my enclosure 
in the woods ; nor did I look after this for any other use than as an 
enclosure for my goats ; for the aversion which nature gave me to these 
hellish wretches was such, that I was as fearful of seeing them as of 
seeing the devil himself ; nor did I so much as go to look after my 
boat in all this time, but began rather to think of never making any 
more attempts to bring the other boat round the island to me, lest I 
should meet with some of these creatures at sea, in which, if I had 
happened to have fallen into their hands, I knew what would have been 
my lot. 

Time, however, and the satisfaction I had that I was in no danger 
of being discovered by these people, began to wear off my uneasiness 
about them ; and I began to live just in the same composed manner as 
before, only with this difference, that I used more caution, and kept 
my eyes more about me than I did before, lest I should happen to be 
seen by any of them; and particularly, I was more cautious of firing 



126 The Life and Adventures 

my gun, lest any of them being on the island should happen to hear it; 
and it was therefore a very good providence to me, that I had furnished 
myself with a tame breed of goats, that I had no need to hunt any more 
about the woods, or shoot at them ; and if I did catch any more of them 
after this it was with traps and snares, as I had done before : so that 
for two years after this, I believe I never fired my gun once off, though 
I never went out without it; and, which was more, as I had saved 
three pistols out of the ship, I always carried them out with me, or at 
least two of them, sticking them in my goat-skin belt. I likewise 
furbished up one of the great cutlasses that I had out of the ship, and 
made me a belt to put it in also ; so that I was now a most formidable 
feUow to look at when I went abroad, if you add to the former descrip- 
tion of myself the particular of two pistols, and a great broadsword 
hanging at my side in a belt, but without a scabbard. 

Things going on thus, as I have said, for some time, I seemed, 
excepting these cautions, to be reduced to my former calm sedate way 
of living ; aU these things tended to show me more and more how far 
my condition was from being miserable, compared to some others; nay, 
to many other particulars of life, which it might have pleased God to 
have made my lot. It put me upon reflecting, how little repining 
there would be among mankind, at any condition of life, if people 
would rather compare their condition with those that are worse, in 
order to be thankful, than be always comparing them with those which 
are better to assist their murmurings and complainings. 

As in my present condition there were not really many things which 
I wanted, so indeed I thought the frights I had been in about these 
savage wretches, and the concern I had been in for my own preservation, 
had taken off the edge of my invention for my own conveniences ; and 
I had dropt a good design, which I had once bent my thoughts upon ; 
and that was, to try if I could not make some of my barley into malt, 
and then try to brew myseK some beer : this was really a whimsical 
thought, and I reproved myself often for the simplicity of it; for I 
presently saw there would be the want of several things necessary to 
the making my beer, that it would be impossible for me to supply ; as, 
first, casks to preserve it in, which was a thing that, as I have observed 
already, I could never compass ; no, though I spent not many days, but 
weeks, nay months, in attempting it, but to no purpose. In the next 
place, I had no hops to make it keep, no yeast to make it work, no 
copper or kettle to make it boil; and yet, had not aU these things 
intervened, I mean the frights and terrors I was in about the savages, I 
had undertaken it, and perhaps brought it to pass too ; for I seldom 



of Rohtnson Crusoe* 127 

gave anything over without accomplishing it, when I once had it in my 
head enough to begin it. 

But my invention now ran quite another way ; for night and day I 
could think of nothing but how I might destroy some of these monsters 
in their cruel bloody entertainment, and if possible, save the victim they 
should bring hither to destroy. It would take up a larger volume 
than this whole work is intended to be to set down all the contrivances 
I hatched, or rather brooded upon in my thoughts, for the destroying 
these creatures, or at least frightemng them, so as to prevent their 
coming hither any more; but all was abortive; nothing could be 
possible to take effect unless I was to be there to do it myself; and 
what could one man do among them, when perhaps there might be 
twenty or thirty of them together, with their darts, or their bows and 
arrows, with which they could shoot as true to a mark as I could with 
my guni 

Sometimes I contrived to dig a holfe under the place where they 
made their fire, and put in five or six pounds of gunpowder, which, when 
they kindled their fire, would consequently take fire, and blow up all 
that was near it ; but, as in the first place I should be very loath to 
waste so much powder upon them, my store being now within the 
quantity of a barrel, so neither could I be sure of its goiug off at any 
certain time when it might surprise them ; and, at best, that it would 
do little more than just blow the fire about their ears, and fright them, 
but not sufficient to make them forsake the place ; so I laid it aside, 
and then proposed that I would place myself in ambush, in some con- 
venient place, with my three guns all double-loaded, and in the middle 
of their bloody ceremony let fly at them, when I should be sure to kiU 
or wound perhaps two or three at every shot : and then felling in upon 
them with my three pistols and my sword, I made no doubt but that^ 
if there were twenty, I should kiU them all : this fancy pleased my 
thoughts for some weeks, and I was so full of it that I often dreamt of 
it, and sometimes, that I was just goiug to let fly at them iir my sleep. 

I went so far with it in my indignation, that I employed myself 
several days to find out proper places to put myself in ambuscade, as I 
said, to watch for them; and I went frequently to the place itself^ which 
was now grown more familiar to me ; and especially while my mind 
was thus filled with thoughts of revenge, and of a bloody putting 
twenty or thirty of them to the sword, as I may call it ; but ihe horror 
I had at the place, and at the signals of the barbarous wretches devouring 
one another, abated my malice. 

Well, at length I found a place in the side of the h\\\ where I was 



128 The Lifo and Adventures 

satisfied I miglit secxtpely wait till I saw any of the boats coming, and 
might then, even before they would be ready to come on shore, convey 
myself unseen into thickets of trees, in one of which there was a hollow 
large enough to conceal me entirely, and where I might sit and 
observe all their bloody doings, and take my full aim at their heads, 
when they were so close together so that it would be next to impossible 
that I should miss my shoot, or that I could fail wounding three or four 
of them at the first shoot. 

In this place then I resolved to fix my design, and accordingly I 
prepared two muskets and my ordinary fowling-piece. The two muskets 
I loaded with a brace of slugs each, and four or five smaller bullets, 
about the size of pistol-bullets, and the fowling-piece I loaded with near 
a handful of swan-shot of the largest size; I also loaded my pistols with 
about four bullets each; and in this posture, weU provided with am- 
munition for a second and third charge, I prepared myself for my 
expedition. 

After I had thus laid the scheme for my design, and in my imagina- 
tion put it in practice, I continually made my tour every morning up to 
the top of the hill, which was from my castle, as I called it, about three 
. miles or more, to see if I could observe any boats upon the sea coming 
near the island, or standing over towards it ; but I began to tire of this 
hard duty, after I had for two or three months constantly kept my 
watch ; but came always back without any discovery, there having not 
in all that time been the least appearance, not only on or near the shore, 
but not on the whole ocean, so far as my eyes or glasses could reach 
every way. 

As long as I kept up my daily tour to the hill to look out, so long 
also I kept up the vigour of my design, and my spirits seemed to be 
all the while in a suitable frame for so outrageous an execution as the 
killing twenty or thirty naked savages, for an offence which I had not 
at all entered into a discussion of in my thoughts, any further than my 
passions were at first fired by the horror I conceived at the unnatural 
custom of the people of that country, who, it seems, had been suffered 
by Providence, in his wise disposition of the world, to have no other 
guide than that of their own abominable and vitiated passions; and, 
consequently, were left, and perhaps had been for some ages, to act such 
horrid things, and receive such dreadful customs as nothing but nature 
entirely abandoned of Heaven, and actuated by some hellish degeneracy, 
could have run them into ; but now, when, as I have said, I began to 
be weary of the fruitless excursion which I had made so long, and so 
far, every morning in vain ; so my opinion of the action itself began 



of Bobinsan Crusoe. 129 

to alter, and I began, with cooler and calmer thoughts, to consider what 
it was I was going to engage in ; what authority or call I had to pretend 
to be judge and executioner upon these men as criminals, whom Heaven 
had thought £t for so many ages to suffer, unpunished, to go on, and 
to be, as it were, the executioners of his judgments upon one another ; 
also, how far these people were offenders against me, and what right I 
had to engage in the quarrel of that blood which they shed promis- 
cuously one upon another. I debated this very often with myself thus: 
How do I know what God himself judges in this particular case 1 It 
is certain these people do not commit this as a crime ; it is not against 
their own consciences reproving, or their light reproaching them. They 
do not know it to be an offence, and then commit it in defiance of divine 
justice, as we do in almost all the sins we commit. They think it no 
more a crime to kill a captive taken in war, than we do to kill an ox ; 
nor to eat human fiesh, than we do to eat mutton. 

When I had considered this a little, it followed necessarily, that I 
was certainly in the wrong in it ; that these people were not murderers 
in the sense that I had before condemned them in my thoughts, any 
more than those Christians were murderers, who often put to death the 
prisoners taken in battle, or more frequently, upon many occasions, put 
whole troops of men to the sword, without giving quarter, though they 
threw down their arms and submitted. 

In the next place, it occurred to me, that albeit the usage they gave 
one another was thus brutish and inhuman, yet it was really nothing 
to me : these people had done me no injury : that if they attempted 
me, or I saw it necessary for my immediate preservation to fall upon 
them, something might be said for it ; but that I was yet out of their 
power, and they had really no knowledge of me, and consequently no 
design upon me ; and therefore it could not be just for me to fall upon 
them : that this would justify the conduct of the Spaniards, in all their 
barbarities practised in America, where they destroyed millions of these 
people, who, however they were idolaters and barbarians, and had several 
bloody and barbarous rites in their customs, such as sacrificing human 
bodies to their idols, were yet, as to the Spaniards, very innocent people ; 
and that the rooting them out of the country is spoken of with the 
utmost abhorrence and detestation, even by the Spaniards themselves, 
at this time, and by all other Christian nations of Europe, as a mere 
butchery, a bloody and unnatural piece of cruelty, unjustifiable either 
to GrOD or man ; and such, as for which the very name of a Spaniard 
is reckoned to be frightful and terrible to all people of humanity, or of 
Christian compassion ; as if the kingdom of Spain were particularly 

X 



130 The Life and Adventures 

eminent for the prodact of a lace of men, who were without principles 
of tendemessy or the common bowels of pitj to the miseraUe, which 
is reckoned to be a mark of a generous temper in the mind. 

These considerations really put me to a panse, and to a kind of a fall 
stop ; and I began by little and little to be off my design, and to con- 
clude I had taken a wrong measure in my resolutions to attack the 
sayages ; that it was not my business to meddle with them, unless they 
first attacked me, and this it was my business, if possible, to preyent ; 
but that, if I were discoyered and attacked, then I knew my duty. 

On the other hand, I argued with myself that this really was the 
way, not to deHver myseU^ but entirely to ruin and destroy myself ;. 
for unless I was sure to kill eyery one that not only should be on shore 
at that time, but that should oyer come on shc^e afterwards, if but one 
ni them escaped to tell their country-people what had happened, they 
would come oyer again by thousands to reyenge the death of their 
fellows ; and I should only bring upon myseK a certain destruction, 
which at present I had no manner of occasion for. 

Upon the whale, I concluded, that neither in principles nor in policy, 
I ought one way or other to concern myself in this affair : that my 
business was by all possible means to conceal myseK from them, and 
not to leaye the least signal to them to guess by, that there were any 
Hying creatures upon the island, I mean of human shape. 

Religion joined in with this prudential resolution, and I was convinced 
now many ways that I was perfectly out of my duty, when I was laying 
all my bloody schemes for the destruction of innocent creatures, I 
mean innocent as to me ; as to the crimes they were guilty of towards 
one another, I had nothing to do with them ; they were national, and 
I ought to leaye them to the justice of God, who is the governor of 
nations, and knows how by national punishments to make a just 
retribution for national offences ; and to bring public judgments upon 
those who offend in a public manner, by such ways as best please him. 

In this disposition I continued for near a year after this : and so far 
was I from desiring an occasion for falling upon these wretches, that 
in all that time I neyer once went up the hill to see whether there 
were any of them in sight, or to know whether any of them had been 
on shore there or not ; that I might not be tempted to renew any of 
my contriyances against them, or be provoked, by any advantage which 
might present itself to fedl upon them ; only this I did, I went and 
removed my boat, which I had on the other side the island, and carried 
it down to the east end of the whole island, where I ran it into a little 
cove which I found under some high rocks, and where I knew, by 



of Robinson Crusoe. 181 

reason of the currents, the savages durst not, at least would not, come 
with their boats, upon any account whatsoever. 

With my boat I carried away everything that I had left there belong- 
ing to her, though not necessary for the bare going thither ; namely, a 
mast and sail, which I had made for her, and a thing like an anchor, but 
indeed, which could not be called either anch^ or grappling : however, 
it was the best I could make of its kind. All these I removed, that 
there might not be the least shadow of any discovery, or any appearance 
of any boat, or of any habitation upon the island. 

Besides this, I kept myself as I said, more retired than ever, and 
seldom went from my cell other 4;han upon my constant employment, 
namely, to milk my she-goats, and manage my little flock in the wood, 
which, as it was quite on the other part of the island, was quite out of 
danger : for certain it is, that these savage people, who sometimes 
haunted this island, never came with any thoughts of finding anything 
here, and consequently never wandered «ff from the coast; and I doubt 
not but they might have been several times on shore, after my appre- 
hensions of them had made me cautious, as well as before ; and indeed 
I looked back with some horror upon the thoughts of what my condition 
would have been, if I had chopped ^upon them, and been discovered 
when naked and unarmed, except with my gun, and that loaded often 
only with small shot. I walked everywhere peeping and peeping about 
the island, to see what I could get. What a surprise should I have been 
in, i^ when I discovered the print of a man's foot, I had instead of 
that seen fifteen or twenty savages, and found them pursuing me, and, 
by the swiftness of their running, no possibility of my escaping tiiem ! 

The thoughts of this sometimes sunk my very soid within me, and 
distressed my mind so much, that I could not soon recover it. I 
confess that these anxieties, these constant dangers I lived in, and the 
concern that was now upon me, put an end to all invention, and to all 
the contrivances that I had laid for my friture accommodations and 
conveniences. I had the care of my safety more now upon my hands 
than that of my food. I cared not to drive a nail, or chop a stick of 
wood now, for fear the noise I should make should be heard ; much 
iess would I fire a gun, for the same reason ; and above all, I was 
intolerably uneasy at making any fire, lest the smoke, which is visible 
at a great distance in the day, should betray me : and for this reason I 
removed that part of my business which required fire, such as burning 
of pots and pipes, &c into my new apartment in the woods ; where, 
after I had been some timer, I found, to my unspeakable consolation, a 
mere natural cave in the earth, which went in a vast way, and where, 

k2

The Life and Adventures 



I dare say, no savage, had lie been at the mouth of it, would be so hardy 
as to venture in, nor indeed would any man else, but one who, like me, 
wanted nothing so much as a safe retreat. 

The mouth of this hollow was at the bottom of a great rock, where, 
by mere accident (I would say, if I did not see an abundant reason to 
ascribe all such things now to Providence), I was cutting down some 
thick "branches of trees to make charcoal ; and before I go on, I mu&t 
observe the reason of my making this charcoal, which was thus : 

I was afraid of making a smoke about my habitation, as I said before; 
and yet I could not live there without baking my bread, cooking my 
meat, &c. so I contrived to bum some wood here, as I had s^en done in 
England, under tur^ till it became chark, or dry coal ; and then putting 
the fire out, I preserved the ooal to carry home, and perform the other 
services which fire was wanting for at home, without danger of smoke. 

But this is by the bye. While I was cutting down some wood here, 
I perceived that behind a very thick branch of low brushwood, or 
underwood, there was a kind of hollow place. I waa curious to look 
into it, and, getting with difficulty into the mouth of it, I found it was 
pretty large, that is to say, sufficient for me to stand upright in it, and 
perhaps another with n\e ; but I must confess to you, I made mora 







haste out than I did in ; when looking farther into the place, which 
was perfectly dark, I saw two broad shintug eyes of some creature, 
whether devil or man I knew not, which twinkled like two stars, the 
dim light from the cave's mouth shining directly in, and making the 
reflection. 




THE OOAT IN THE CATE 



of Bobtnson Crusoe, 133 

However, after some pause, I recovered myself and began to call 
myself a thousand fools, and tell myself, that he that was afraid to see 
the devil, was not fit to live tweniy years in an island all alone, and 
that I durst to believe there was nothing in this cave that was more 
frightful than myself : upon this, plucking up my courage, I took up a 
great fireband, and in I rushed again, with the stick flaming in my 
hand. I had not gone three steps in, but I was almost as much frighted 
as I was before ; for I heard a very loud sigh, like that of a man in 
some pain; and it was followed by a broken noise, as if of words 
half-expressed, and then a deep sigh again. I stepped back, and was 
indeed struck with such a surprise, that it put me into a cold sweat ; and 
if I had had a hat on my head, I will not answer for it that my hair 
might not have lifted it off. But still, plucking up my spirits as well 
as I could, and encouraging myself a little, with considering that the 
power and presence of God was everywhere, and was able to protect 
me ; upon this I stepped forward again, and by the light of the fire- 
brand, holding it up a little over my head, I saw lying on the ground 
a most monstrous frightftd old he-goat> just making his will, as we say, 
and gasping for life, and dying indeed of mere old age. 

I stirred him a little to see if I could get him out, and he essayed 
to get up, but was not able to raise himself; and I thought with, myself 
he might even lie there ; for he had frighted me so, he would certainly 
fright any of the savages, if any of them should be so hardy as to 
come in there, while he had any life in him. 

I was now recovered from my surprise, and began to look round me, 
when I found the cave was but very small ; that is to say, it might be 
about twelve foot over, but in no manner of shape, either round or 
square, no hands ever having been employed in making it but those of 
mere nature. I observed also, that there was a place at the farther side 
of it that went in farther, but was so low, that it required me to creep 
upon my hands and knees to go into it, and whither I went, I knew 
not ; so having no candle, I gave it over for some time, but resolved to 
come again the next day, provided with candles and a tinder-box, 
which I had made of the lock of one of the muskets, with some wild* 
fire in the pan- 
Accordingly, thfe next day, I came provided with six large candles of 
my own maldng (for I made very good candles now of goat's tallow) ; 
and going into this low place, I was obliged to creep upon all fours, 
as I have said, almost ten yards ; which, by the way, I thought was a 
venture bold enough, considering that I knew not how far it might go, 
nor what was beyond it. When I was got through the streight, I found 



134 The Lifo and Adventures 

the jooi, rose higher up, I believe near twenty foot ; but nerer was 
such a glorious sight seen in the island, I dare say, as it was, to look 
round the sides and roof ef this vault or cave. The waUs reflected an 
hundred thousand lights to lae from my twa candles : what it was in the 
rock, whether diamonds, or any other precious stones, or gold, which I 
rather suppose it to be, I knew not. 

The place I was in was a most delightful cavity, or grotto, of its 
kind, as could be expected^ though perfectly dark ; the floor was dry 
and level, and had a sort of small loose gravel upon it ; so that there 
was no nauseous or venomous creature to be seen ; neither was there 
any damp or wet on the »des or roof; the only difficulty in it was the 
entrance, which, however, as it was a place of security, and such a 
retreat as I wanted, I thought that was a convenience > so that I wa9 
really rejoiced at the discovery,, and resolved, without any delay, to bring 
some of those things which I was most anxious about to this place ; 
particularly, I resolved to bring hither my magazine of powder, and all 
my spare arms, nauiely, two fowling-pieces (for I had three in all) and 
three muskets (for of them I had eight in all) ; so I kept at my castle 
only five, which stood ready mounted, like pieces of cannon, on my 
outmost fence, and were ready also to take out upon any expedition. 

Upon this occasion of removing my ammunition, I took occasion to 
open the barrel of powder which I took up out of the sea, and which 
had been wet ; and I found that the water had penetrated about three 
or four inches into the powder on every side, which, caking and growing 
hard, had preserved the inside like a kernel in a shell ; so that I had 
near sixty pound of very good powder in the centre of the cask ; and 
this was an agreeable discovery to me at that time ; so I carried all 
away thither, never keeping above two or three pound of powder with 
me in my castle, for fear of a surprise of any kind. I also carried 
thither all the lead I had left for bullets. 

I fancied myself now like one of the ancient giants, which are said 
to live in caves and holes in the rocks, where none could come at them; 
for I persuaded myself while I was here, if five hundred savages were 
to hunt me, they could never find me out ; or if they did, they would 
not venture to attack me here. 

The old goat, whom I found expiring, died in the mouth of the cave 
the next day after I made this discovery ; and I found it much easier 
to dig a great hole there, and throw him in, and cover him with earth, 
than to drag him out ; so I interred him there, to prevent offence to 
my nose. 

I was now in my twenty-third year of residence in this island, and 



of Bohinson Crusoe. 135 

was so naturalized to the place, and to the manner of living, that could 
I have but enjoyed the certainty that no savages would come to the 
place to disturb me, I could have been content to have capitulated for 
spending the rest of my time there, even to the last moment, till I had 
laid me down and died, like the old goat in the cave. I had also 
arrived to some little diversions and amusements, which made the time 
pass more pleasantly with me a great deal than it did before ; as, first, 
I had taught my Poll, as I noted before, to speak ; and he did it so 
familiarly, and talked so articulately and plain, that it was very pleasant 
to me ; and he lived with me no less than six-and-twenty years : how 
long he might live afterwards I know not ; though I know they have 
a notion in the Brasils, that they live a hundred years ; perhaps poor 
Poll may be alive there still, calling after poor Eobin Crusoe to this 
day ; I wish no Englishman the ill luck to come there and hear him ; 
but if he did, he would certainly believe it was the deviL My dog 
was a very pleasant and loving companion to me for no less than 
sixteen years of my time, and then died of mere old age ; as for my 
cats, they multiplied, as I have observed, to liiat degree, that I was 
obliged to shoot several of them at first, to keep them from devouring 
me and all I had ; but at lengtli, when the two old ones I brought with 
me were gone, and aft^ some time continually driving them from me, 
and letting them have no provision with me, they all ran wild into the 
woods, except two or three favourites, which I kept tame, and whose 
young, when they had any, I always drowned, and these were part of 
my family. Besides these, I always kept two or three household kids 
about me, which I taught to feed out of my hand ; and I had also 
more parrots which talked pretty well, and would all call Eobin Crusoe, 
but none like my first; nor indeed, did I take the pains with any of 
them that I had done with him. I had also several tame sea-fowls, 
whose names I know not, which I caught upon the shore, and cut their 
wings ; and the little stakes, which I had planted before my castle wall, 
being now grown up to a good thick grove, these fowls all lived among 
these low trees, and bred there, which was very agreeable to me, so ihat^ 
as I said above, I began to be very well contented with the life I led, 
if it might but have been secured from the dread of the savages. 

But it was otherwise directed; and it may not be amiss for all people 
who shall meet yn\h my story to make this just observation from it, 
namely. How frequently, in the course of our lives, the evil which in 
itself we seek most to shun, and which, when we are fallen into, is 
the most dreadful to us, is oftentimes the very means or door of our 
deliverance, by which alone we can be raised again from the aMction 



136 The Life and Adventures 

we are fallen into. I could give many examples of this in the conrse 
of my unaccountable life; but in nothing was it more particularly 
remarkable than in the circumstances of my last two years of solitary 
residence in this island. 

It was now the month of December, as I said above, in my twenty- 
third year ; and this being the southern solstice, for winter I cannot 
call it, was the particular time of my harvest, and required my being 
pretty much abroad in the fields } when going out pretty early in the 
morning, even before it was thorough day-light> I was surprised with 




seeing a light of some fire upon the shore, at a distance from me of 
about two miles, towards the end of the island, where I had observed 
some savages had been before ; but not on the other side ; but to my 
great affliction, it was on my side of the island. 

I was indeed terribly surprised at the sight, and stepped short within 
my grove, not daring to go out, lest I might be surprised ; and yet I 
had no more peace within, frcwn the apprehensions I had, that if these 
savages, in rambling over the island, should find my corn standing, or 
cut, or any of my works and improvements, they would immediately 
conclude that there were people in the place, and would then never 
give over till they had found me out. In this extremity I went back 
directly to my castle, pulled up the -ladder after me, having made all 
things without look as wild and natural as I could. 

Then I prepared myself within, putting myself in a posture of 
defence. I loaded all my cannon, as I called them, that is to say, my 



of Robinson Crusoe. 137 

muskets, which were mounted upon my new fortification, and all my 
pistols, and resolved to defend myself to the last gasp ; not forgetting 
seriously to commend myself to the divine protection, and earnestly to 
pray to God to deliver me out of the hands of the barbarians ; and 
in this posture I continued about two hours, but began to be mighty 
impatient for intelligence abroad, for I had no spies to send out. 

After sitting a while longer, and musing what I should do in this 
case, I was not able to bear sitting in ignorance longer; so setting up 
my ladder to the side of the hill, Where there was a flat place, as I 
observed before, and then pulling the ladder up after me, I set it up 
again, and mounted to the top of the hill ; and pulling out my perspective 
glass, which I had taken on purpose, I laid me down flat on my belly 
on the ground, and began to look for the place. I presently found 
there was no less than nine naked savages sitting round a slhali fire 
they had made; not to warm them, for they had no need of that, the 
weather being extreme hot ; but, as I supposed, to dress some of their 
barbarous diet of human flesh, which they had brought with them, 
whether alive or dead I could not know. 

They had two canoes with them, which they had hauled up upon the 
shore ; and as it was then tide of ebb, they seemed to me to wait for 
Hie return of the flood to go away again. It is not easy to imagine 
what confusion this sight put me into, especially seeing them come on 
my side the island, and so near me too ; but when I observed their 
coming must be always with the current of the ebb, I began afterwards 
to be more sedate in my mind, being satisfied that I might go abroad 
with safety all the time of the tide of flood, if they were not on shore 
before ; and having made this observation^ I went abroad about toy 
harvest work with the more composure. 

As I expected, so it proved; for as soon as the tide made to the 
westward, I saw Hiem all take boat^ and row (or paddle as we call it) 
aH away. I should have observed, that for an hour and more before 
they went ofi^ they went to dancing, and I could easily discern their 
postures and gestures by my glasses : I could not perceive, by my nicest 
observation, but that they were stark naked, and had not the least 
cot«ering upon them ; but whether they were men <x women, that I 
could not distinguish. 

As soon as I saw them shipiped and gone, I took two guns upon my 
shoulders, and two pistols at my girdle, and my great sword by my side, 
without a scabbard ; and with all the speed I was able to make, I went 
away to the hill, where I had discovered the first appearance of alL 
And as soon as I got thither, which was not less than two hours (for I 



138 The Life and Adventures 

could not go apace, being so loaded with arms as I was), I perceived 
there had been three canoes more of savages on that place ; and looking 
out ferther, I saw they were all at sea together, making over for the 
main. 

This was a dreadM sight to me, especially when going down to the 
shore, I could see the marks of horror which the dismal work they had 
been about had left behind it, namely, the blood, the bones, and part of 
the flesh of human bodies, eaten and devoured by those wretches with 
merriment and sport. I was so filled with indignation at the sight, 
that I began now to premeditate the destruction of the next that I saw 
there let them be who or how many soever. 

It seemed evident to me, that the visits which they thus made to this 
island were not very frequent ; for it was above fifteen months before 
any more of them came on shore there again, that is to say, I never 
saw them, or any footsteps or signals of them in all that time ; and I 
found they did not come in the rainy season ; yet all this while I lived 
uncomfortably, by reason of the constant apprehensions I was in of 
their coming upon me by surprise. 

However, I wore out a year and three months more, before I saw any 
of the savages ; but in the month of May, as near as I could calculate, 
and in my four-and- twentieth year, I had a very strange encounter with 
them, of which in its place. 

The perturbation of my mind, daring this fifteen or sixteen months' 
interval, was very great. In the day great troubles overwhelmed my 
mind ; in the night I dreamed often of killing savages, and the reasons 
why I might justify the doing of it. But, to waive all this for a while, 
it was the middle of May, on the sixteenth day, I think, that it blew a 
very great storm of wind all day, with a great deal of lightning and 
thunder, and a very foul night it was. I know not what was the par- 
ticular occasion of it, but as I was reading the Bible, and taken up with 
serious thoughts about my present condition, I was surprised with the 
noise of a gun, as I thought, fired at sea. 

This was, to be sure, a surprise of quite a different nature from any 
I had met with before, for the notions this put into my thoughts were 
quite of another kind. I started up in the greatest haste imaginable, 
and, in a trice, clapped up my ladder to the middle place of the rock, 
and pulled it after me, and mounting it the second time, got to the top 
of the hill ; that moment a flash of fire bade me listen for a second gun, 
which, accordingly, iu about half a minute I heard, and by the sound, 
knew that it was from that part of the sea where I was driven out with 
the current in my boat. 



of Bolinson Crusoe. 



139 



I immediately considered that tlus must be some ship in distress, 
and that they had some comrade, or some other ship in company, and 
fired these guns for signals of disftress, and to obtain help. I had this 
presence of mind at that minute, as to think, that though I could iK)t 
help them, it may be they might help me ; so I brought together all 
the dry wood I could get at hand, and making a good sized pile, I set 
it on fire upon the hill ; the wood was dry, and blazed jfreely, and 
though the wind blew very hard, yet it burnt feirliy out, so that I was 
certain, if there was any such thing as a ship, they must needs see it, 
and no doubt they did, for as soon as my fire blazed up, I heard another 
gun, and after that several others, all from the same quarter. I plied 
my fire all night long, till day broke, and when it was broad day, and 
the air cleared up, I saw something at a great distance at sea, full east 
of the island, whether a sail,, or a hull, I could not distingiaish, no, not 
with my glasses,, the distance was so great, and the weather stiU being 
hazy also : at least it was so out at sea. 

I looked frequently at it all that day, and sooa perceived that it did 
not move; so I presently ccmcluded thafe.it was a ship at anchor, and 
being eager, you may be sure, to be satisfied, I took my gun in my hand 
and ran towards the south-east side of the island, to the rocks, where I 
had been formerly carried away with the current, and getting up there, 
the weather by this time being perfectly clear, I could plainly see, to 
my great sorrow, the wreck of a ship cast away in the night upon these 




concealed rocks, which I found when I was out in my boat, and which 
rocks, as they checked the violence of the stream, and made a kind of 
counter stream, or eddy, were the occasion of my recovering then from 
the most despei*ate, hopeless condition that ever I hod been in. 



140 The Life and Adventures 

Thus, what is one man's safety is another man's destruction ; for it 
seems these men, whoever they were, being out of their knowledge, and 
the rocks being wholly under water, had been driven upon them in the 
night, the wind blowing very hard at E. and E.KE. Had they seen 
the island, as I must necessarily suppose they did not, they must, as I 
thought, have endeavoured to have saved themselves on shore by the 
help of their boat; but the firing of their guns for help, especially when 
they saw, as I imagined, my fire, filled me with many thoughts. 

In the condition I was in, I could do no more than look upon the 
misery of the poor men, and pity them, which had stiU this good eflfect 
on my side, that it gave me more and more cause to give thanks to 
God, who had so happily and comfortably provided for me in my 
desolate condition; and that of two ships* companies, who were now 
cast away upon this part of the world, not one life should be spared 
but mine. I learnt here again to observe, that it is very rare the 
providence of God casts us into any condition of life so low, or any 
nlisery so great, but we may see something to be thankful for, and may 
see others worse than ourselves. 

Such certainly was the case of these men, of whom I could not so 
much as see room to suppose any of them were saved ; nothing could 
make it rational, so much as to wish or expect that they did not all 
perish there, except the possibility only of their being taken up by 
another ship in company ; and this was but mere possibility indeed ; 
for I saw not the least signal or appearance of any such thing. 

I cannot explain by words, what a strange longing or hankering of 
desires I felt in my soul upon this sight, breaking out sometimes thus : 
— " that there had been but one or two, nay, but one soul saved out 
of the ship, to have escaped to me, that I might have had one com- 
panion, one fellow-creature, to have spoken to me, and to have conversed 
with ! " In all the time of my solitary life, I never felt so earnest, so 
strong a desire, after the society of my fellow-creatures, or so deep a 
regret at the want of it 

But it was not to be ; either their fate, or mine, or both, forbade it ; 
for, tiU the last year of my being in this island, I never knew whether 
any were saved out of the ship or no ; and had only the affliction, some 
days after, to see the corpse of a drowned boy washed on shore, at the 
end of the island which was next the shipwreck. He had on a 
seaman's waistcoat, a pair of open-kneed linen drawers, and a blue 
linen shirt ; but nothing to direct me to guess what nation he was of. 
He had nothing in his pocket but two pieces of eight, and a tobacco- 
pipe. The last was of more value to me than the first. 




CRUSOE FINDS A DROWNED BOT 



of Rohinaon Crusoe. 141 

It was now calm, and I had a great mind to venture out in my boat 
to this wreck, not doubting but I might find something on board that 
might be useful to me j and possibly there might be yet some living 
creature on board, whose life I might not only save, but might, by 
saving that life, comfort my own to the last degree ; and this thought 
clung so to my heart, that I could not be quiet night or day, but I 
must venture out in my boat on board this wreck ; and committing the 
rest to God's providence, I thought the impression was so strong upon 
my mind, that it could not be resisted, that it must come from some 
invisible direction, and that I should be wanting to myself if I did 
not go. 

Under the power of this impression, I hastened back to my castle, 
prepared everything for my voyage, took a quantity of bread, a great 
pot of fresh water, a compass to steer by, a bottle of rum (for I had 
still a great deal of that left), a basket full of raisins, and thus loading 
myself with everything necessary, I went down to my boat, got the 
water out of her, and got her afloat, loaded all my cargo in her, and 
then went home again for more. My second cargo was a great bag full 
of rice, the umbrella to set up over my head for a shade, another pot 
full of fresh water, and about two dozen of my small loaves, or barley 
cakes, more than before, with a bottle of goat's milk, and a cheese ; all 
which, with great labour and sweat, I brought to my boat, and praying 
to God to direct my voyage, I put out ; and, rowing or paddling the 
canoe along the shore, I came at last to the utmost point of the island 
on that side, namely, N.E. And now I was to launch out into the 
ocean, and either to venture or not venture. I looked on the rapid 
currents which ran constantly on both sides of the island at a distance, 
and which were very terrible to me, from the remembrance of the hazard 
I had been in before, and my heart began to fail me j for I foresaw, 
that if I was driven into either of these currents, I should be carried a 
vast way out to sea, and perhaps out of reach, or sight, of the island 
again ; and that, as my boat was but small, if any little gale of wind 
should rise, I should be inevitably lost. 

These thoughts so oppressed my mind, that I began to give over my 
enterprise, and having hauled my boat into a little creek on the' shore, 
I stepped out, and sat me down upon a little spot of rising ground, very 
pensive and anxious, between fear and desire, about my voyage ; when, 
as I was musing, I could perceive that the tide was turned, and the 
flood came on, upon which my going was for so many hours imprac- 
ticable. Upon this it presently occurred to me, that I should go up to 
the highest piece of ground I could find, and observe, i If could, how 



142 



The Life and Adventures 



the sets of the tide or currents lay when the flood came in^ that I mightj 
judge whether, if I was driven one way out, I might not expect to be 
driven another way home, with the same rapidness of the currents. 
This thought was no sooner in my head, but I cast my eye upon a little 
hill, which sufficiently overlooked the sea both ways, and from whence 
I had a clear view of the currents, or sets of the tide, and which way I 
was to guide myself in my return. Here I found that as the current 
of the ebb set out close by the south point of the island, so the current 
of the flood set in close by the shore of the north side ; and that I had 
nothing to do but to keep to the north of the island in my return, and 
I should do well enough. 

Encouraged with this observation, I resolved the next morning to 
set out with the first of the tide ; and reposing myself for that night 
in the canoe, under the great watch-coat I mentioned, I launched out 
in the morning. I made first a little out to sea, full north, till I began 
to feel the benefit of the current, which set eastward, and which carried 
me at a great rate, and yet did not so hurry me as the southern side 
current had done before, and so as to take from me all government of 
the boat ; but, having a strong steerage with my paddle, I went directly 
for the wreck, and in less thai two hours, I came up to it. 




It was a dismal sight to look at : the ship, which by the building 
was Spanish, stuck fast jambed in between two rocks ; all the stern 
and quarter of her was beaten to pieces with the sea ; and as her fore- 
castle, which stuck in the rocks, had run on with great violence, her 
main-mast and fore-mast were brought by the board, that is to say, 
broken short off; but her bowsprit was sound, and the head and bow 



of Bdbinson Crusoe. 143 

appeared firm. When I came close to her, a dog appeared upon her, 
who, seeing me coming, yelped and cried ; and as soon as I called him, 
jumped into the sea to come to me ; and I took him into the boaty and 
found him almost dead for hunger and thirst I gaye him a cake of 
my bread, and he eat it like a ravenous wolf that had been starving for 
a fortnight in the snow. I then gave the poor creature some fi'esh 
water, with which, if I would have let him, he would have burst 
himself 

After this I went on board. The first sight I met with was two men 
drowned in the cook-room, or fore-castle of the ship, with their arms 
fast about one another. I concluded, as is indeed probable, that when 
the ship struck, it being in a storm, the sea broke so high, and so con- 
tinually over her, that the men were not able to bear it, and were 
strangled with the constant rushing in of the water, as much as if they 
had been imder water. Besides the dog, there was nothing left in the 
ship that had life, or any goods that I could see, but what were spoiled 
by the water. There were some casks of liquor, whether wine or 
brandy, I knew not, which lay lower in the hold, and which, the water 
being ebbed out, I could see, but they were too big to meddle with. I 
saw several chests, which I believed belonged to some of the seamen, 
and I got two of them into the boat, without examining what was in 
them. 

Had the stem of the ship been fixed, and the fore part broken off, I 
am persuaded I might have made a good voyage ; for, by what I found 
in these two chests, I had room to suppose the ship had a great deal of 
wealth on board ; and, if I may guess by the course she steered, she 
must have been bound from Buenos Ayres, or the Eio de la Plata, in 
the south part of America, beyond the Brasils, to the Havannah, in the 
Gulf of Mexico, and so perhaps to Spain. 

I found, besides these chests, a little cask full of liquor, of about 
twenty gallons, which I got into my boat with much difficulty. There 
were several muskets in the cabin, and a great powder-horn, with about 
four pounds of powder in it ; as for the muskets, I had no occasion for 
them, so I left them, but took the powder-horn. I took a fire-shovel 
and tongs, which I wanted extremely ; as also two little brass kettles, 
a copper pot to make chocolate, and a gridiron ; and with this cargo 
and the dog, I came away, the tide beginning to make home again ; and 
the same evening, about an hour within night, I reached the island 
again, weary and fatigued to the last degree. 

I reposed that night in the boat, and in the morning I resolved to 
harbour what I had gotten in my new cave, not to cany it home to my 



144 The Life and Adventures 

caatle. After refreshing myself I got all my cargo on shore, and began 
to examine it. The cask of liquor I found to be a kind of mm, but 
not such as we had at the Brasils, and, in a word, not at all good. But 
when I came to open the chests, I found several things I wanted : for 
example, I found in one a fine case of bottles, of an extraordinary kind, 
and filled with cordial waters, fine, and very good : the bottles held 
about three pints each, and were tipped with silver. I found two pots 
of very good succades, or sweetmeats, so fastened on top, that the salt 
water had not hurt them ; and two more of the same, which the water 
had spoiled. I found some very good shirts, which were very welcome 
to me, and about a dozen and a half of white linen handkerchiefs, and 
coloured neckcloths ; the former were also very welcome, being exceed- 
ingly refreshing to wipe my face on in a hot dry day. Besides this, 
when I came to the till in the chest, I found there tliee great bags of 
pieces of eight, which held about eleven hundred pieces in all ; and in 
one of them, wrapt up in a paper, six doubloons of gold, and some 
small bars of gold ; I suppose they might all weigh near a pound. 

The other chest I found had some clothes in it, but of little value ; 
but by the circumstances it must have belonged to the gunner*s mate, 
though there was no powder in it, but about two pounds of glazed 
powder in three small flasks, kept, I suppose, for charging their fowling- 
pieces on occasion. Upon the whole, I got very little by this voyage 
that was of much use to me, for, as to the money, I had no manner of 
occasion for it, it was to me as the dirt under my feet, and I would 
have given it all for three or four pair of English shoes and stockings, 
which were things I greatly wanted, for I had not had a pair on my 
feet for many years. I had, indeed, gotten two pair of shoes now, 
which I took off the feet of the two men whom I found drowned in 
the wreck ; and I found two pair more in one of the chests, which were 
very welcome to me ; but they were not like our English shoes, either 
for ease or service, being rather what we call pumps than shoes. I 
found in this seaman's chest about fifty pieces of eight in royals, but 
no gold ; I suppose this belonged to a poorer man than the other, which 
seemed to belong to some officer. 

Having now brought all my things on shore, and secured them, I 
went back to my boat, and rowed or paddled her along the shore to 
her old harbour, where I laid her up, and made the best of my way 
to my old habitation, where I found everything safe and quiet ; so I 
began to repose myself, live after my old fashion, and take care of my 
family affairs ; and for a while I lived easy enough, only that I was 
more vigilant than I used to be, looked out oftener, and did not go 



of Robinson Crusoe, 145 

abroad so much : and if any time I did stir with any freedom, it was 
always to the east part of the island, where I was pretty well satisfied 
the savages never came, and where I could go without so many pre- 
cautions, and such a load of arms ancf ammunition as I always carried 
with me, if I went the other way. 

One night, in the rainy season, in March, the four-and-twentieth 
year of my first setting foot in this land of solitariness, I had the 
following dream ; namely, that as I was going out in the morning, as 
usual, from my castle, I saw upon the shore two canoes, and eleven 
savages coming to land, and that they brought with them another 
savage, whom they were going to kill, in order to eat him, when on a 
sudden the savage that they were going to kill, made his -escape, and 
ran for his life : and then I thought in my sleep, that he came running 
into my little grove, before my fortification, to hide himself ; and that 
I seeing him, and not perceiving that the others sought him that way, 
showed myself to him, and encouraged him ; that he kneeled down to 
me, seeming to pray to me to assist him ; upon which I showed him 
my ladder, made him go up, and carried him into my cave, and he 
became my servant ; and that as soon as I had got this man, I said to 
myself, " Now I may venture to the mam land, for this fellow will serve 
me as a pilot, and tell me what to do, and whither to go for provisions, 
and whither not to go for fear of being devoured ; what places to 
venture into, and what to escape." I awoke with this thought, and 
was under such inexpressible impressions of joy at the prospect of my 
escape in my dream, that the disappointment I felt upon coming to 
myself, and finding it was no more than a dream, was really extravagant 
the other way, and threw me into a very great dejection of spirits. 

Upon this, however, I made this conclusion, that my only way to go 
about an attempt for an escape, was to try to get a savage in my posses- 
sion ; and, if possible, it should be one of their prisoners, whom they 
had condemned to be eaten, and should bring hither to kilL 

With these resolutions in my thoughts, I set myself upon the scout, 
as often as possible, and indeed so often, till I was heartily tired of it. 
I was not at first more careful to shun the sight of these savages, and 
avoid being seen by them, than I was now eager to be upon them. 

Besides, I fancied myself able to manage one, nay, two or three 
savages, if I had them, so as to make them entirely slaves to me, to do 
what I should direct them, and to prevent their being able at any time 
to do me any hurt. It was a great while that I pleased myself witli 
this affair ; but nothing still presented ; all my fancies and schemes 
came to nothing, for no savages «ame near me for a great while. 

L 



146 T^ Life and Adventures 

Ab(ratayear and a half after I had entertained these notions, and by 
long musing had, as it weie, resolved to pnt thran into execation, I was 
soiprised one morning early with seeing no less than five canoes all on 
shore together, on my side of the'island, and the people who belonged 
to them all landed. The number of them broke all my measures, for 
seeing so many, and knowing that they always came four, or sometimes 
more, in a boat, I could not tell what to think of it, or how to take 
my measures to attack twenty or thirty men single-handed, so I lay still 
in my castle, perplexed and discomforted. However, I put myself into 
all the same postures for an attack that I had formerly provided, and 
was just ready for action, if anything had presented. Having waited a 
good while, listening to hear if they made any noise, at length, being 
very impatient, I set my guns at the foot of my ladder, and clambered up 
to the top of the hill by my two stages, as usual, standing so, however, 
that my head did not appear above the hiU ; so that they could not 
perceive me by any means. I here observed, by the help of my per- 
spective glass, that they were no less than thirty in number, that they 
had a fire kindled, and that they had meat dressed ; how they cooked 
it, that I knew not, or what it was : but they were all dancing, in I 
know not how many barbarous gestures and figures, round the fire. 

While I was thus looking on them, I perceived, by my perspective 
glass, two miserable wretches dragged from the boats, where, it seems, 
they were laid by, and were now brought out for the slaughter. I 
perceived one of them immediately Ml, being knocked down, I suppose, 
with a club, or wooden sword, for that was their way ; and two or 
three others were at work, cutting him open for their cookery, while 
the other victim was left standing by himself, till they should be ready 
for him. In that very moment this poor wretch seeing himself a little 
at liberty, nature inspired him with hopes of life, and he started away 
from them, and ran with incredible swiftness along the sands, directly 
towards me, I mean towards that part of the coast where my habita- 
tion was. 

I was dreadfully frighted (that I must acknowledge,) when I per- 
ceived him to nm my way, and especially when, as I thought, I saw him 
pursued by the whole body ; and I expected that part of my dream was 
coming to pass, and that he would take shelter in my grove : but I 
could not depend, by any means, upon my dream for the rest of it, 
namely, that the savages would not pursue him thither, and find him 
there. However, I kept my station, and my spirits began to recover 
when I found that there were not above three men that followed him ; 
and still more was I encouraged, when I found that he outstripped 



of Robinson Crtisoe. 147 

them exceedingly in running, and gained gronnd of them, so that if he 
could but hold out for half an hour, I saw he would fadrly get away 
from them alL 

There was between them and my castle, the creek, which I mentioned 
often at the first part of my story, when I landed my cargoes out of the 
ship : and this I knew he must necessarily swim over, or the poor 
wretch would be taken there ; but when the savage who was escaping, 
came thither, he made nothing of it, though the tide was then up, but 
plunging in, he swam through it in about thirty strokes, or thereabouts. 




landed, and ran on with exceeding strength and swiftness. When the 
three pursuers came to the creek, I found that two of them could swim, 
but the third could not, and that he, standing on the other side, looked 
at the others, but went no further, and soon after went softly back again, 
which, as it happened, was very well for him. 

I observed that the two who swam were yet twice as long swimming 
over the creek, as the fellow was that fled from them. It came now 
very warmly upon my thoughts, and indeed irresistibly, that now was 
my time to get me a servant, and perhaps, a companion or assistant, and 
that I was called plainly by Providence to save this poor creature's 
life. I immediately got down the ladders, fetched my two guns, for 
they were both at the foot of the ladders, and getting up again with 
the same haste to the top of the hill, I crossed towards the sea ; and, 
having a very short cut, and all down hill, clapped myself in the way 
between the pursuers and thfe pursued, hallooing aloud to him that fled,'

sooner had it than he ran to his enemy, and, at one blow, cut off his 
head so cleverly, no executioner in Germany could have done it sooner 
or better ; which I thought very strange for one who, I had reason to 
believe, never saw a sword in his life before, except their own wooden 
swords. However, it seems, as I learned jrfberwards, they make their 
wooden swords so sharp, so heavy, and the wood is so hard, that they 
will cut off heads and arms with them, and at one blow too. When he 
had done this, he came laughing to me in sign of triumph, and brought 
me the sword again, and laid it down, with the head of the savage he 
had killed, just before me. 

He was astonished how I had killed the other Indian, so far off; and 
going to him, he stood like one amazed, looking at him, turning him, 
first on one side, then on the other ; looked at the wound the bullet 
had made, which was in the breast^ where it had made a hole, and no 
great quantity of blood had followed, but he had bled inwardly, for he 
was quite dead. Then he took up lus bow and arrows, and came back, 
and I beckoned fdr us to go away, making signs that more might come 
after them Upon this, he signed to me, that he should bury them 
with sand, that they might not be seen by the rest, if they followed ; 
so I made signs for h\m to do so ; he fell to work, and had them both 
buried in the sand in about a quarter of an hour. I then called him 
away, and took him not to my castle, but my cave, on the farther part 
of the island ; so I did not let my dream come to pass in that respect, 
namely, that he came into my grove for shelter. Here I gave hinu 
bread, and a bunch of raisins to eat, and a draught of water, which he was 
in great distress for, by his running; and having refreshed him, I made 
signs for him to go to sleep, pointing to a place where I had laid a 
great parcel of rice-straw, and a blanket upon it, which I used to sleep 
upon myself sometimes ; so the poor creature lay down, and went to 
sleep. 

He was a comely handsome fellow, perfectly well made, tall, and 
well-shaped, and, as I reckon, about twenty-six years of age. He had 
a very good countenance, not a fierce and surly aspect, but seemed to 
have something very manly in his fece, and yet he had all the sweet- 
ness and softness of an European in his countenance too, especially 
when he smiled. His hair was long and black, not curled like wool, his 
forehead very high and large, and a great vivacity and sparkling sharp- 
ness in his eyes. The colour of his skin was not quite black, but very 
tawny, and yet not of an ugly, yellow, nauseous tawny, as the Brasil- 
ians, and Virginians, and other natives of America are, but of a bright 
kind of a dun olive colour, that had in it something very agreeable.

though not very easy to describe. His fsice was round and plump, his 
nose small, not flat like the negroes, a very good mouth, thin lips, and 
his teeth fine, well set, and white as ivory. After he had slumbered 
about half an hour, he waked, and came out of the cave to me, for I 
had been milking the goats in the enclosure just by. When he espied 
me, he came running, and laid himself on the ground again, with all 
the possible signs of an humble, thankful disposition, making many 
antic gestures to show it. At last he lays his head flat upon the 
ground, close to my foot, and sets my other foot upon his head, as he 
had done before, and after this, made all the signs to me of subjection, 
servitude, and submission imaginable, to let me know how much he 
would serve me as long as he lived. I understood him in many things, 
and let him know I was well pleased with him. In a little time I 
began to speak to him, and teach him to speak to me ; and first, made 
him know his name should be Friday, which was the day I saved his 
life. I likewise taught him to say, " Master," and then let him know 
that was to be my name. I also taught him to say, " Yes," and "No," 
and to know the meaning of them. I gave him some milk in an 
earthen pot, and sonje bread, and let him see me drink some before 
him, and sop my bread in it^ which he quickly imitated, and made 
signs that it was very good for him. 




I kept there with him all that night ; but as soon as it was day, I 
took him away with me. As we went by the place where he had 
])uried the two men, he pointed exactly to the spot, and showed me the 
marks he had made to find them again, making signs to me that we 



of Rohinson Crusoe, 151 

should dig them up and eat them : at this I appeared very angry, 
expressed my abhorrence of it, made as if I would vomit at the thoughts 
of it, and beckoned with my hand to him to come away, which he 
immediately did, with great submission. I then led him to the top of 
the hill, to see if his enemies were gone, and pulling out my glass, I 
looked, and saw plainly the place where they had been, but no appear- 
ance of them, or their canoes ; so they were quite gone. 

I then took my man Friday with me, giving him the sword in his 
hand, with the bow and arrows at his back, which I found he could 
use very dexterously, making him carry one gun for me, and I two for 
myself and away we marched to the place where these creatures had 
been. When I came there, my very blood ran chill in my veins, and 
my heart sunk within me at the horror of the spectacle. Indeed, it 
was a dreadful sight ; the place was covered with human bones, the 
ground dyed with the blood, great pieces of flesh left here and there, 
half eaten, mangled, and scorched, and, in short, all the tokens of the 
triumphant feast they had been making there, after a victory over 
their enemies. I saw three skulls, five hands, and the bones of three 
or four legs and feet, and abundance of other parts of the bodies ; and 
Friday, by his signs, made me understand, that they brought over four 
prisoners to feast upon, that three of them were eaten, and that he, 
pointing to himself, was the fourth ; that there had been a great battle 
between them and their next king, whose subjects it seems he had been 
one of, and that they had taken a great number of prisoners, all of 
which were carried to several places by those that had taken them in 
the fight, in order to feast upon them, as was done here by these 
wretches. 

I caused Friday to gather all the bones and flesh that remained, and 
lay them together in a heap, and bum them to ashes. I found that he 
had still a hankering stomach after the flesh, and was still a cannibal 
in his nature, but I displayed such abhorrence at the very thoughts of 
it, that he durst not discover it ; for I let him know that I would kill 
him if he offered it. 

When we had done this, we came back to our castle, where I gave 
Friday first of all a pair of linen drawers, which I had out of the poor 
gunner's chest I found in the wreck, and which, with a little alteration, 
fitted him very well ; then I made him a jerkin of goat's skin, as well 
as I was able ; and I gave him a cap, which I had made of a hare's 
skin ; and thus he was dressed, for the present, tolerably well ; and 
mighty well was he pleased to see himself almost as well clothed as 
his master. He went awkwardly in these things at first ; wearing the 



152 The Lifo and, Adventures 

drawers was veiy awkward to him, and the sleeves of the jerkm galled 
his shoulders, and the inside of his arms ; but he soon got used to 
tliem. 

The next day after I came home to my hut with him, I began to 
consider where I should lodge him : so I made a little tent for him in 
the vacant place between the two fortifications, in the inside of the 
last, and in the outside of the first ; and as there was an entrance there 
into my cave, I made a formal framed door-case, and a door to it of 
boards, and set it up in the passage, a little within the entrance, and 
causing the door to open in the inside, I barred it up in the nighty 
taking in my ladders too ; so that Friday could no way come at me in 
the inside of my innermost wall, without making so much noise in 
getting over, that it must needs awaken me, for my fiAt wall had now 
a complete roof over it of long poles, covering all my tent, and leaning 
up to the side of the hill, which was again laid across with small sticks 
instead of laths, and then thatched over a great thickness with the 
rice straw, which was strong like reeds; and at the hole or place 
which was left to go in or out by the ladder, I had placed a kind of 
trap-door, which, if it had been attempted on the outside, would not 
have opened at all, but would have fallen down, and made a great 
noise. I took care to take all the weapons into my side every night. 

But I needed none of these precautions, for never was a more faith- 
ful, loving, sincere servant than Friday was to me ; without passions, 
sullenness, or designs ; his very affections were tied to me, like those 
of a child to its father, and, I dare say, he would have sacrificed his 
life for the saving of my own, upon any occasion whatever. 

I was greatly delighted with him, and made it my business to teach 
him everything that was proper and useful, and especially to make him 
speak, and understand me when I spoke : and he was a very apt 
scholar, and he was so merry, so diligent, and so pleased when he 
could understand me, or make me understand him, that it was very 
pleasant for me to talk to him. And now my life began to be very 
easy and happy. 

After I had been two or three days returned to my castle, I thought, 
that in order to bring Friday off from his horrid way of feeding, and 
from the relish of a cannibal's stomach, I ought to let him taste other 
flesh. So I took him out with me one morning to the woods, and I 
saw a she- goat lying down in the shade, and two young kids close by 
her. I catched hold of Friday ; " Hold," said I ; " stand still ;" and 
made signs to him not to stir ; immediately I presented my piece, shot, 
and killed one of the kids. The poor creature who had, at a distance 



of Robinson Crusoe, 



153 



indeed, seen me kill the savage, his enemy, but did not know, nor 
could imagine, how it was done, was sensibly surprised, trembled, and 
shook, and looked so amazed, that I thought he would have sunk 
down. He did not see the kid I had shot at, nor perceived I had 
killed it, but ripped up his waistcoat to feel if he was not wounded j 
and, as I found, thought I was resolved to kill him ; for he came and 
kneeled down to me, and embracing my knees, said a great many 
things I did not understand, but I could see that his meaning was to 
pray to me not to kill him. 

I soon found a way to convince him that I would do him no harm j 
and, taking him up by the hand, laughed at him, and pointing to the 
kid I had killed, beckoned to him to run and fetch it, which he did ; 
and while he was looking to see how the creature was killed, I loaded 
my gun again, and by-and-by I saw a great fowl, like a hawk, sit upon 
a tree within shot ; so, to let Friday understand a little what I would 
do, I called him to me again, pointing at the fowl, which was a parrot, 
though I thought it had been a hawk ; I say, pointing to the parrot 
and to my gun, and to the ground under the parrot, to let him see I 
would make him fall, I made bim understand that I would shoot and 




kill that bird ; accordingly I fired, and bade him look, and immediately 
he saw the parrot faU. He stood like one frightened again, notwith- 
standing all I had said to him ; and I found he was the more amazed, 
because he did not see me put anything into the gun ; but thought 
there must be some wonderful fond of death and destruction in that 



154 The Life and Adventures 

thing, able to kill man, beast, bird, or any other thing, near or fSar off ; 
and I believe, if I would have let him, he would have worshipped me 
and my gim ; as for the gun itself he would not so much as touch it 
for several days after, but would speak to it, and talk to it, as if it had 
answered him, which, as I afterwards learned of him, was to desire it 
not to kill him. 

Well, after his astonishment was a little over at this, I pointed to 
hiTTi to run and fetch the bird I had shot, which he did, but staid some 
time, for the parrot, not being quite dead, was fluttered a good way off 
from the place where she fell. However, he found her, took her up, 
and brought her to me ; and, as I had perceived his ignorance about 
the gun before, I took this advantage to charge the gun again, and not 
let. him see me do it, that I might be ready for any other mark, but 
nothing offered at that time. So I brought home the kid, and the 
same evening took the skin offi and cut it up as well as I could ; and 
having a pot for that purpose, I boiled or stewed some of the flesh, and 
made some very good broth. After I had begun to eat some, I gave 
some to my man, who seemed very glad of it, and liked it very well ; 
but that which was strangest to him, was to see me eat salt with it. 
He made a sign to me that the salt was not good to eat, and putting a 
little into his own mouth, he seemed to nauseate it, and would spit and 
sputter at it, washing his mouth with fresh water after it. On the other 
hand, I took some meat in my mouth without salt, and I pretended to 
spit and sputter for want of salt, as fast as he had done at it, but it 
would not do. 

Having thus fed him with boiled meat and broth, I was resolved to 
feast him the next day with roasting a piece of the kid ; this I did by 
hanging it before the fire in a string, as I had seen many people do in 
England, setting two poles up, one on each side of the fire, and one 
across the top, and tying the string to the cross stick, letting the meat 
turn continually. This Friday admired much ; but when he came to 
taste the flesh, he took so many ways to tell me how well he liked it, 
that I could not but understand him ; and at last he told me he would 
never eat man's flesh any more, which I was very glad to hear. 

The next day I set him to work to beating some corn out, and sifting 
it in the manner I used to do ; and he soon understood how to do it as 
well as I, especially after he had seen what the meaning of it was, and 
that it was to make bread of; for after that I let him see me make 
my bread, and bake it too ; and in a little time Friday was able to do 
all the work for me as well as I could do it myself. 

I began now to consider that having two mouths to feed instead of 



of Robinson Crtisoe. 165 

one, I must provide more groimd for my harvest, and plant a larger 
quantity of corn than I used to do, so I marked out a larger piece of 
land, and began the fence in the same manner as before, in which 
Friday not only worked very hard, but very cheerfully ; and I told him 
that it was for com to make more bread, because he was now with me, 
and that I might have enough for him and myself too. He appeared 
very sensible of that part, and let me know that he would work the 
harder for me, if I would tell him what to do. 

This was the pleasantest year of all the life I led in this place. 
Friday began to talk pretty well, and understand the names of almost 
everything I had occasion to call for, and of every place I had occasion 
to send him to, and talk a great deal to me ; so that, in short, I began 
to have some use for my tongue again. Besides the pleasure of talking 
to him, I had a singular satisfaction in the fellow himself : his simple, 
unfeigned honesty appeared to be more and more every day, and I began 
really to love the creature j and I believe he loved me as much as 



I had a mind once to try if he had any hankering inclination to his 
own country ; and having learned him English so well that he could 
answer me almost any questions, I asked him whether the nation that 
he belonged to never conquered in battle. At which he smiled, and 
said, ** Yes, yes ; we always fight the better : " that is, he meant, always 
get the better in fight : and so we began the following discourse : " You 
always fight the better !" said I ; " how came you to be taken prisoner, 
then, Friday 1" 

Friday. My nation beat much for all that. 

Master. How beat ? If your nation beat them, how came you to 
be taken ? 

Friday. They more than my nation in the place where me was : they 
take one, two, three, and me. My nation over-beat them in yonder 
place, where me no was ; there my nation take one, two, great thousand. 

Master. But why did not your side recover you from the hands of 
your enemies, then ? 

Friday. They run one, two, three, and me, and make go in the 
canoe : my nation have no canoe that time. 

Master, WeU, Friday, and what does your nation do with the men 
they take ? Do they carry them away and eat them, as these did? 

Friday. Yes, my nation eat mans too, eat all up. 

Master. Where do they carry them 1 

Friday. Go to other place, where they think. 

Master. Do they come hither 1 



156 The Life and Adventures 

Friday, Yes, yes, they come hither : come other else place. 

Master, Have you been here with them ? 

Friday, Yes, I been here. (Points to the KW. side of the island, 
which it seems was their sida) 

By this I understood that my man Friday had formerly been among 
the savages, who had used to come on shore on the farther parts of the 
island, on the said man-eating occasions that he had been now brought 
for : and some time after, when I took courage to carry him to that side, 
he presently knew the place, and told me he was there once when they 
eat up twenty men, two women, and one child. 

After I had had this discourse with him, I asked him how feir it was 
from our island to the shore ; whether the canoes were not often lost ? 
He told me that there was no danger, no canoes ever lost ; but that, 
after a little way out to sea, there was a current, and a wind always one 
way in the morning, the other in the afternoon. 

This I thought to be no more than the sets of the tide, as going out 
or coming in ; but I afterwards understood it was occasioned by the 
great draught and reflux of the mighty river Oroonoque ; in the mouth 
of which river, as I thought afterwards, our island lay ; and that this 
land, which I perceived to the W. and KW., was the great island 
Trinidad, on the north point of the mouth of the river. I asked Friday 
a thousand questions about the country, the inhabitants, the sea, the 
coast, and what nations were near : he told me all he knew, with the 
greatest openness imaginable. I asked him the names of the several 
nations of his sort of people, but could get no other names than Caribs ; 
from whence I easily understood that these were the Caribbees, which 
our maps place on that part of America which reaches from the mouth 
of the river Oroonoque to Guiana, and onwards to St. Martha. He told 
me that up a great way beyond the moon, which must be west from 
their country, there dwelt white, bearded men, like me, and pointed to 
my great whiskers, which I mentioned before, and that they had killed 
"much mans," that was his word. By all which I understood he . 
meant the Spaniards, whose cruelties in America had been spread over 
whole countries, and were remembered by all the nations from father 
to son. 

I inquired if he could tell me how I might come from this island, 
and get among those white men ? He told me yes, yes, I might go in 
" two canoe." I could not understand what he meant by " two canoe," 
till at last, with difficulty, I found he meant that it must be a large 
boat, as big as two canoes. 

This part of Friday's discourse began to relish with me very well ; 



of Rohinaon Crusoe. 157 

and £rom this time I entertained some hopes that, one time or other, 
I might find an opportunity to make my escape from this place, and 
that this poor savage might be a means to help me to do it. 

I was now wanting to lay a foundation of religions knowledge in 
Friday's mind ; particularly I asked him one time who made him. The 
poor creature did not understand me, but thought I had asked him who 
was his father. But I took it another way, and asked him who made 
the sea, the ground he walked on, and the hills and woods. He told 
me it was one old Benamuckee, that lived beyond alL He could 
describe nothing of this great person, but that he was very old ; much 
older, he said, than the sea or the land, than the moon or the stars. I 
asked him then, if this person had made all things, why did not all 
things worship him ? He looked very grave, and with a perfect look 
of innocence said, "All things said to him." I asked hiTn if the 
people who die in his country went away anywhere. He said, yes, they 
all went to Benamuckee. Then I asked him whether those they eat up 
went thither too. He said, " Yes." 

From these things I began to instruct him in the knowledge of the 
true God. I told him that the great Maker of all things lived up there, 
pointing up towards heaven : that he governs the world by the same 
power and providence by which he had made it : that he was omni- 
potent, could do everything for us, give everything to us, take every- 
thing from us : and thus, by degrees, I opened his eyes. He listened 
with great attention, and received with pleasure the notion of Jesus 
Christ being sent to redeem us, and of the manner of making our 
prayers to God, and his being able to hear us, even into heaven. He 
told me one day, that if our God could hear us up beyond the sun, he 
must needs be a greater God than their Benamuckee, who lived but a 
little way off, and yet could not hear till they went up to the great 
mountains where he dwelt, to speak to him. I asked him if ever he 
went thither to speak to him. He said, no ; they never went that 
were young men ; none went thither but the old men, whom he called 
their Oowokakee, that is, as I made him explain it to me, their religious, 
or clergy ; and that they went to say (so he called saying prayers), 
and then came back, and told them what Benamuckee said. By this 
I observed that there is priestcraft even amongst the most blinded 
ignorant pagans in the world. 

Sending him for something a great way off, I seriously prayed to God 
that he would enable me to instruct this poor savage, assisting by his 
Spirit the heart of the poor ignorant creature to receive the light of the 
knowledge of God in Christ, reconciling him to himself, and would 



158 The Life and Adventures 

guide me to speak so to him from the word of Grod^ as his conscience 
might be convinced, his eyes opened, and his soul saved. When he 
came again to me, I entered into a long discourse with him upon the 
subject of the redemption of man, by the Saviour of the world, and of 
the doctrine of the gospel preached from heaven, namely, of repentance 
towards God, and Mth in our blessed Lord Jesus. I then explained 
to him, as well as I could, why our blessed Eedeemer took not on him 
the nature of angels, but the seed of Abraham, and how, for that 
reason, the fallen angels had no share in the redemption, that he came 
only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel, and the like. 

I had, Gk)d knows, more sincerity than knowledge, in all the methods 
I took for this poor creature's instruction, and must acknowledge what 




I believe all that act upon the same principle will find, that, in laying 
things open to him, I really informed and instructed myself in many 
things that I either did not know or had not fully considered before, 
but which occurred naturally to my mind, upon my searching into them 
for the information of this poor savage : and I had more affection in my 
inquiry after things upon this occasion than ever I felt before ; so that 
whether this poor wild wretch was the better for me or no, I had great 
reason to be thankful that ever he came to me ; my grief sat lighter 
upon me, my habitation grew comfortable to me beyond measure, and 
when I reflected, that, in this solitary life which I had been confined 
to, I had not only been moved myself to look up to heaven, and to 
seek to the hand that brought me thither, but was now to be made an 



of Robinson Crusoe. 159 

instrument, under Providence, to save the life, and for aught I knew, 
the soul, of a poor savage, and bring him to the true knowledge of 
religion, and of the Christian doctrine, that he might know Christ 
Jesus, " to know whom is life eternal" 

In this thankful frame I continued all the remainder of my time, 
and the conversatiom which employed the hours between Friday and 
me was such as made the three years, which we lived there together, 
perfectly and completely happy, if any such thing as complete happiness 
can be found in a sublunary state. The savage was now a good 
Christian, a much better than I, though I have reason to hope, and 
bless Gk)D for it,, that we were equally penitent, and comforted restored 
penitents. "We had here the word of God to read, and no farther off 
from his Spirit to instruct, than if we had been in England. I always 
applied myself to reading the Scriptures, and to let him know, as weU 
as I could, the meaning of what I read. 

After Friday and I became more intimately acquainted, and that he 
could understand almost all I said to him, and speak fluently, though 
in broken English, to me, I acquainted him with my history. I let 
him into the mystery of gunpowder and bullets, and taught him how 
to shoot. I gave him a knife, which he was wonderfully delighted 
with, and I made him a belt with a hog hanging to it^ such as in 
England we wear hangers in, and in the frog, instead of a hanger, I 
gave him a hatchet. 

I described to him the countries of Europe, and particularly England, 
which I came from ; how we lived, how we worshipped God, how we 
behaved to one another, and how we traded in ships to aU parts of the 
world. I gave him an account of the wreck which I had been on 
board of, and showed him, as near as I could, the place where she lay ; 
but she had all been gone long ago. 

I showed him the ruins of our boat, which we lost when I escaped, 
and which was now fallen almost to pieces. Upon seeing this boat, 
Friday stood musing some time, and said nothing. I asked him what 
he studied upon ; at last, says he, '^ Me see such boat like come to place 
at my nation." 

I did not understand him a good while ; but at last, when I had 
examined farther into it, I understood by him, that a boat, such as that 
had been, came on shore upon the country where he lived ; that is, as 
he explained it^ was driven thither by stress of weather. I presently 
imagined, that some European ship must have been cast away upon 
their coast, and the boat might get loose, and drive ashore ; but was so 
dull that I never once thought of men making their escape from a 



160 T%e Life md Advemiures 

wxedc thitheKy mndi lev wlienee thejr mi^ come, 80 I onl j inquired 
after a descziptioa of the TmhI 

Friday described tlie boat to me well enough ; bat brought me better 
to nndeiBtand bim wben he added, with some wazmth, ** We save the 
white mans fraoL drown." Then I presendj asked him if there were 
anj white mans, as he called them, in the boat : " Yes," he said, ''the 
boot fall ci white mansw" I asked him, ** How many ! " He told me 
upon his fingers seventeen. I asked him ''What became of them t" 
He told me, "They liye, they dwell at my nation." 

This pat new thooghts into my head again, for I presently imagined, 
that these mi^it be tbe men belonging to the ship that was cast away 
in sig^t of my island, and who, after the ship was struck on the rock, 
and they saw her inevitably lost, had saved themselves in their boat, 
and were landed upon that wild shore among savages. 

Upon this I inquired of him more critically, what was become of 
them ; he assured me tliey still lived there^ that they had been there 
about four years, that the savages let them alone, and gave them 
victuals to live. I asked him, how it came to pass that they did not 
kill them, and eat theuL He said, "^o, they make brotlier with 
them," that is, as I understood him, a truce; and then he added, 
" They no eat mans, but when make the war fight ; " that is to say, 
they never eat any men, but such as come to fight with them, and are 
taken in battle. 

It was after this, some considerable time, that being on the top of 
the hill, at the east side of the island, from whence I had, in a clear 
day, discovered the main, or continent of America, Friday, the weather 
being very serene, looks very earnestly towards the main land, and in 
a kind of surprise, falls a jumping and dancing, and calls out to me ; 
I asked him what was the matter. " joy," says he, " glad ! There 
see my country ! there my nation ! " 

I observed an extraordinary sense of pleasure appear in his face, his 
eyes sparkled, and his countenance discovered a strange eagerness, as if 
he had a mind to be in his own country again ; and this observation of 
mine put a great many thoughts into me, which made me at first not 
so easy about my new man Friday as I was before ; and I made no 
doubt, but that if Friday could get back to his own nation again, he 
would not only forget all his religion, but all his obligations to me. 

But I wronged the poor honest creature very much, for which I was 
very sorry afterwards ; however, as my jealousy increased, and held me 
some weeks, I was a little more circumspect, and not so familiar and 
kind to him as before, in which I was certainly in the wrong. 



of Bobtnsan Crusoe* 161 

Whikt my jealousy of him lasted, I was every day pumping him, to 
see if he would discover any of the new thoughts, which I suspected 
were in him; but I found everything he said was honest, and so 
innocent^ that I could find nothing to nourish my suspicion, and, in 
spite of all niy uneasiness, he made me at last entirely his own again; 
nor did he in the least perceive that I was uneasy, and therefore 
I could not suspect him of deceit 

One day walkkig up the same hill, but the weather being hazy at sea, 
so that we could not see the continent, I called to him and said, 
"Friday, do not you wish yourself in your own country, your own 
nation % " " Yes," he said ; " I be much glad to be at my own nation." 
" What would you do there? " said I ; " would you turn wild again, eat 
man's flesh again, and be savage as you were before ? " He looked fiill 
of concern, and shaking his head, said, "No, no ; Friday tell them to 
live good, tell them to pray Gk)d, tell them to eat corn-bread, cattle- 
flesh, milk ; no eat man again." "Why, then," said I to hinij "they 
will kilj you." He looked grave at that, and then said, "No, they no 
kill me ; they willing love learn." He meant by this they would be 
willing to learn ; he added they learned much of the bearded mans that 
came in the boat Then I asked if he would go back to them. He 
smiled at that^ and told me he could not swim so £ar. I told him I 
would make a canoe for him. He told me he would go, if I would go 
with him. "I go," said I, "why they will eat me if I come there." 
" No, no," said he, " me make them no eat you ; me make they much 
love you." He meant he would tell them how I had killed his enemies, 
and saved his Ufe, and so he would make the& much love me. 

From this time, I confess, I had a mind to venture over, and see if 
I could possibly join with these bearded men, who, I made no doubt^ 
were Spaniards or Portuguese ; not doubting but, if I could, we might 
find some method to escape from thence, being upon the continent, and 
a good company together, better than I could from an island, forty 
miles off the shore, and alone without help. So, after some days I took 
Friday to work again, by way of discourse, and told him I would give 
him a boat to go back to his own nation ; and accordingly carried hiTn 
to my frigate, which lay on the other side of the island, and having 
cleared it of the water, I brought it out, showed it him, and we both 
went into it 

I found he was very dexterous at managing it, and would make it go 
almost as swift again as I could ; so I said to him, " Well, now, Friday, 
shall we go to your nation 1 " He looked very dull at my saying so, 
which, it seem^ was because he thought the ?»oat was too small to go

80 far. I told him then I had a bigger ; so the very next day I went 
to the place where the first boat lay, which I had made, but which 1 
could not get into the water. He said that was big enough ; but as I 
had taken no care of it, and it had lain two or three-and-tweniy years 
there, the sun had split and dried it, that it was in a manner rotten. 
Friday told me that such a boat would do very well, and would carry 
" much enough vittle, drink, bread ; " that was his way of talking. 

Upon the whole, I was by this time so fixed upon my design of 
going over with him to the continent^ that I told him we would go and 
make one as big as that, and he should go home in it He answered 
not one word, but looked very grave and sad. I asked him what was 
the matter with him. He asked me again thus,— r" Why you angry mad 




with Friday ? What me done 1 " I asked him what he meant : I told 
him I was not angry with him at all. " No angry ! no angry ! " says 
he, repeating the words several times, " why send Friday home away to 
my nation ? *' ** Why," said I, " Friday, did you not say you wished 
you were there % " " Yes, yes," says he, " wish we both there ; no 
wish Friday there, no master there." In a word, he would not think 
of going there without me. " You shall go without me; leave me here 
to live by myself as I did before." He looked confused at this, and 
running to one of the hatchets which he used to wear, he takes it up 
hastily, and gives it me. " What must I do with this ? " said I to him. 
" You take kill Friday," says he. " What must I kUl you for? " said I 
again. He returns very quick, "What you sent Friday away fopf 



of Robinson Crusoe, 163 

Take kill Friday ; no send Friday away." As lie spoke, tears stood in 
his eyes, and I was so affected, that I said I would never send him 
away, if he was willing to stay with me. 

I found that all the foundation of his desire to go to his own country 
was laid in his ardent affection to the people, and his hopes of my 
doing them good : a thing, which as I had no notion of myself so I 
had not the least thought, or intention, or desire of undertaking it 
But still I found a strong inclination to attempting an escape, as ahove, 
founded on the supposition gathered &om the former discourse^ namely, 
that there were seventeen hearded men there ; and therefore, without 
any more delay, I went to work with Friday, to find out a great tree 
proper to fell, and make a large periagua, or canoe, for the voyage. 
After searching some time, Friday at last pitched upon a tree, for I 
found he knew much better than I what kind of wood was fittest for 
it \ nor can I tell, to this day, what wood to call the tree we cut down, 
except that it was very like the tree we call fustic, or between that and 
the Nicaragua wood, for it was much of the same colour and smelL 
Friday was for burning the hollow or cavity of this tree out, to make 
it into a boat, but I showed him how rather to cut it out with tools, 
which after I showed him how to use he did it very handily, and in 
about a month's hard labour we finished it, and made it very handsome, 
especially when with our axes, which I showed him how to handle, we 
cut and hewed the outside into the true shape of a boat. After this, 
however, it cost us near a fortnight's time to get her along, as it were, 
inch by inch, upon great rollers, into the water ; but when she was in, 
she would have carried twenty men with ease. 

It amazed me to see with what dexterity, and how swift my man 
Friday would manage her, turn her, and paddle her along. So I asked 
him if he would, and if we might venture over in her. " Yes," he 
said, "me venture over in her very well, though great blow wind." 
However, I had a farther design that he knew nothing o^ and that was 
to make a mast and a sail, and to fit her with an anchor and cable. As to 
the masi^ that was easy enough to get, so I pitched upon a straight 
young cedar tree, which I found near the place, and which there was 
plenty of in the island ; and I set Friday to work to cut it down, and 
gave him directions how to shape and order it ; but as to the sail, that 
was my particular care. I knew I had pieces of old sails, but as I had 
had them now twenty-six years by me, and not being very careful t(? 
preserve them, they were nearly all rotten. However, I found two 
pieces which appeared pretty good, and with a great deal of pains and 
awkward, tedious stitching, for want of needles, I at Iqs^Vl \&]^^ ^

three-comeTed ugly thing, like what we call in England a shonlder-of- 
mutton sail, to go with a boom at the bottom, and a little short sprit at 
the top, such as usually our ships' long boats sail with, and such as I 
best ^ew how to manage, because it was such a one as I used in the 
boat in which I made my escape from Barbary. 

I was near two months in rigging and fitting out my mast and sails, 
for I fitted them very complete, making a small stay, and a sail, or 
foresail to it^ to assist, if we should turn to windward ; and, which was 
more than all, I fixed a rudder to the stem of her to steer with, and 
though I was but a bungling shipwright, yet, as I knew the usefulness 
and even ijecessily of such a thing, I applied myself with so much 
pains to do it, that at last I brought it to pass. 

After all this was done, I had my man Friday to teach as to what 
belonged to the navigation of my boat; for though he knew veiy well 
how to paddle the canoe, he knew nothing what belonged to a sidl and 
a rudder, and how the sail gibbed, and filled this way or that way, as 
the course we sailed changed ; I say, when he saw this, he stood like 
one astonished and amazed However, with a little use, I made all 
these things feiniiliar to him, and he became an expert sailor, except 
that as to the compass I could make him understand very little of 
that ; but there was not much occasion for the compass in these parts. 

I was now entered on the seven-and-twentieth year of my captivity 
in this place ; though the three last years that I had this creature with 
me ought rather to be left out of the account, my habitation being 
quite of another kind than in all the rest of the time. I kept the 
anniversary of my landing here with the same thankfulness to God 
for his mercies as at first ; and if I had such cause of acknowledgment 
at firsts I had much more so now, having such additional testimonies 
of the care of Providence over me, and the great hopes I had of being 
effectually and speedily delivered ; for I had an invincible impression 
upon my thoughts, that my deliverance was at hand, and that I should 
not be another year in this place. However, 1 went on with aU my 
work as usual 

The rainy season was in the meantime upon me, when I kept more 
within doors than at other times ; so I had stowed our new vessel as 
secure as we could, bringing her up into the creek, where, as I said in 
the beginning, I landed my rafts from the ship ; and thus we waited 
for the months of November and December, in which I designed to 
make my adventure. 

When the settled season began to come in, the first thing I did was 
to lay by a certain quantity of provisions, being the store for our voyage ;' 



of Rohinson Crusoe, 165 

and I intended in a week or a foitniglit's time to open the dock 
and launch out our boat. I was busy one morning upon something of 
this kind, when I called to Friday, and bade him go to the sea-shore^ 
and see if he could find a turtle or tortoise — a thing which we generally 
got once a week for the sake of the eggs, as well as the flesh. Friday 
had not been long gone, when he came running back, and flew over my 
outward wall, or fence, like one that felt not the ground ; and before I 
had time to speak to him, he cried out to me^ '' O master ! O master ! 
O sorrow! O bad!" "Whafs the matter, Friday 1" said L "O 
yonder there," says he, " one, two, three canoe 1 one, two, three ! " By 
this way of speaking, I concluded there were six ; but, on inquiry, I 
found there were but three. "Well, Friday," said 1, "do not be 
fiightened 3 " so I heartened him up as well as I could* However, I 
saw the poor fellow was most terribly scared, for nothing ran in his hcAd 
but that they were come to look for him, and would cut him in pieces 
and eat him ; and the poor fellow trembled so, that I scarce knew what 
to do with him. I comforted him as well as I could, and told him I 
was in as much danger as he, and that they would eat me as well as him. 
" But," said I, " Friday, we must resolve to fight them. Can you fight, 
Friday ? " " Me shoot," says he ; "but there come many great number." 
" No matter for that," said I again, " our guns will fright them that we 
do not kilL" So I asked him whether, if I resolved to defend him, he 
would defend me, and stand by me, and do just as I bade him. He 
said, " Me die when you bid die, master." So I gave him a good dram 
of rum 'y and when he had drunk it, I made him take the two fowling- 
pieces, and load them with swan-shot, as big as small pistol-bullets ; 
then I took four muskets, and loaded them with two slugs and five 
small bullets each ; and my two pistols I loaded with a brace of bullets 
each. I hung my great sword, as usual, naked by my side, and gave 
Friday his hatchet. 

When I had thus prepared myself I took my perspective glass, and 
went up to the side of the hill to see what I could discover, and I 
found quickly by my glass that there were twenty-one savages, three 
prisoners, and three canoes; and that their whole business seemed to 
be the triumphant banquet upon these three human bodies; but 
nothing more than as I had observed as usual with them. 

They were landed, not where they had done when Friday made his 
escape, but nearer to my creek, where the shore was low, and where a 
thick wood came close almost down to the sea. This, with the abhor- 
rence of the inhuman errand these wretches came about, so filled me 
with indignation, that I came down to Friday, and told him I was 



166 The Life and Adventures 

resolved to go down to them and kill them all, and asked him if he 
would stand by me. He had now gotten over his fright, and his spirits 
being a little raised with the dram I had given him, he was very cheer- 
ful, and told me as before, " He would die when I bid die." 

In this fit of fiiry, I took first and divided the arms which I had 
charged, as before, between us. I gave Friday one pistol to stick in his 
girdle, and three guns upon his shoulder; and I took one pistol and 
the other three myself, and in this posture we marched out. I took 
a small bottle of rum in my pocket, and gave Friday a large bag with 
more powder and bullets; and as to orders, I charged him to keep close 
behind me, and not to stir, or shoot, or do anything till I bade him ; 
and, in the meantime, not to speak a word. In this posture I fetched 
a compass to my right hand of near a mile, as well to get over the creek 
as to get into the wood, so that I might come within a shot of them 
before I should be discovered, which I had seen by my glass it was 
easy to do. 

I entered the wood with aU possible wariness and silence (Friday 
foUowiDg close at my heels), and marched till I came to the skirt of the 
wood, on the side which was next to them, only that one comer of the 
wood lay between me and them. Here I called softly to Friday, and 
showing him a great tree, which was just at the corner of the wood, I 
bade him go to the tree, and bring me word if he could see there plainly 
what they were doing. He did so, and came immediately back to me, 
and told me they might be plainly viewed there ; that they were all 
about the fire, eating the flesh of one of their prisoners, and that 
another lay bound upon the sand, a little from them, whom, he said, 
they would kill next, and which fired the very soul within me. He 
told me it was not one of their own nation, but one of the bearded men 
whom he had told me of, that came to their country in the boat. I 
was filled with horror at the very naming the white, bearded man, and 
going to the tree, I saw plainly by my glass a white man, who lay upon 
the beach of the sea, with his hands and feet tied with flags, or things 
like rushes, and that he was an European, and had clothes on. 

There was another tree, and a little thicket beyond it, about fifty 
yards nearer to them than the place where I was, which, by going a 
little way about, I saw I might come at undiscovered, and that then I 
should be within half a shot of them. So I withheld my passion, and, 
going back about twenty paces, I got behind some bushes, which held 
all the way till I came to the other tree, and then I came to a little 
rising ground, which gave me a full view of them, at the distance of 
about eighty yards.

I had now not a moment to lose, for nineteen of the dreadfol 
wretches sat upon the ground, all close huddled together, and had just 
sent the other two to butcher the poor Christian, and bring him, 
perhaps limb by limb, to their fire, and they were stooped down to 
untie the bands at his feet. I turned to Friday : " Now, Friday," said 
I, "do as I bid thee." Friday said he would. " Then, Friday," said 
I, " do exactly as you see me do ; fail in nothing." So I set down one 
of the muskets and the fowling-piece upon the ground, and Friday did 
the like by his ; and with the other musket I took my aim at the 
savages, bidding him do the like : then asking him if he was ready, he 
said, " Yes." ** Then fire at them," said I, and the same moment I 
Hred also. 

Friday took his aim so much the better than I, that on the side he 
shot he killed two of them and wounded three more ; and, on my side, 
I killed one and wounded twa They were in a dreadful consterna- 
tion ; and all of them who were not hurt jumped up upon their feet 
immediately, but did not know which way to run or which way to look, 
for they knew not from whence their destruction came. Friday kept 
his eyes close upon me, that, as I bid him, he might observe what I 
did ; so, as soon as the first shot was made, I threw down the piece and 
took up the fowh'ng-piece, and Friday did the like : he sees me cock 
and present ; hetiid the same again. " Are you ready, Friday % " said 
I. "Yes," said he. " Let fly, then," said I ; and with that I fired 
again among the amazed wi^tches, and so did Friday; and as our pieces 
were now loaded with what I call swan-shot, or small pistol bullets^ ^<8: 



168 The Life and Adventures 

found only two drop ; but so many were wounded, that they ran about 
yelling and screaming like mad creatures, all bloody and wounded 
most of them, and three more fell quickly after, but not quite dead. 

"Kow, Friday," said I, laying down the discharged pieces and taking 
up the musket, which was yet loaded, " follow me,*' which he did with 
a deal of courage ; upon which I rushed out of the wood and showed 
myself and Friday close at my foot. As soon as I perceived they saw 
me, I shouted as loud as I could, and bade Friday do so too ; and 
running as fast as I could, which, by the way, was not very fast, I 
made directly towards the poor victim, who was, as I said, lying upon 
the beach or shore, between the place where they sat and the sea. The 
two butchers, who were just going to work witi him, had left him at 
the surprise of our first fire and fled, in a terrible fright^ to the sea- 
side, and had jumped into a canoe, and three more of the rest made the 
same way. I turned to Friday, and bade him step forwards and fire 
at them. He understood me immediately, and, running about forty 
yards to be nearer them, he shot at them, and I thought he had killed 
them all, for I saw them all fall on a heap in the boat, though I saw 
two of them up again quickly. However, he killed two of them, and 
wounded the third, so that he lay in the bottom of the boat as if he 
had been dead. 

While Friday fired at them, I pulled out my knife and cut the flags 
that bound the poor victim ; and loosing his hands and feet, I lifted 
him up, and asked him, in the Portuguese tongue, what he was. He 
answered in Latin, " Christianus ; " but was so weak and faint, that 
he could scarce stand or speak I took my bottle out of my pocket 
and gave it him, making signs that he should drink, which he did ; 
and 1 gave him a piece of bread, which he eat. Then I asked him 
what countryman he was, and he said, " Espagniole ; " and, being a 
little recovered, let me know, by all the signs he could possibly make, 
how much he was in my debt for his deliverance. I said, in as good 
Spanish as I could, " We will talk afterwards, but we must fight now ; 
if you have any strength left, take the pistol and sword and lay about 
you.'* He took them very thankfully, and no sooner had he the arms 
in his hands, but, as if they put new vigour into him, he flew upon his 
murderers like a fury, and had cut two of them in pieces in an instant, 
for they were so surprised and frightened, that they could make no 
resistance, nor attempt to escape. 

I kept my piece in my hand still, without firing, being willing to 
keep my charge ready, because I had given the Spaniard my pistol and 
Bword ; so I called to Friday, and bade him run up to the tree from 



cf Robinson Crusoe. 169 

whence we first fired, and fetch the arms which lay there that had been 
discharged, which he quickly did ; and then giving him my musket, I 
sat down to load all the rest again, and bade them come to me when 
they wanted. While I was loading these pieces, there happened a fierce 
engagement between the Spaniard and one of the savages, who made 
at liiirn with one of their great wooden swords, the same weapon that 
was to have killed him before, if I had not prevented it. The Spaniard, 
- who was very bold, though weak, had fought this Indian a good while, 
and had cut hiTn two great wounds on his head; but the savage, being 
a stout, lusty fellow, closing in with him, had thrown him down, and 
was wringing my sword out of his hand, when the Spaniard, though 
undermost, wisely quitted the sword, drew the pistol from his girdle, 
and shot him dead on the spot 

Friday, being now left at his liberty, pursued the flying wretches 
with no weapon in his hand but his hatchet ; and with that he dis- 
patched those three who were wounded at first and fallen, and all the 
rest he could come up with ; and the Spaniard coming to me for a gun, 
I gave him one of the fowling-pieces, with which he pursued two 
of the savages, and wounded them both ; but as he was not able to 
run, they both got from him into the wood, where Friday pursued 
them, and killed one of them, but the other was too nimble for him ; 
and though he was wounded, yet had plunged into the sea^ and swam 
with all his might off to those who were left in the canoe ; which three 
in the canoe, with one woimded, we know not whether he died or no, 
were all that escaped our hands of one-and-twenty. 

Those that were in the canoe worked hard to get out of gun-shot ; 
and though Friday made two or three shots at them, I did not find that 
he hit any of them. Friday would fain have had me take one of their 
canoes and pursue them, and indeed I was very anxious about their 
escape, lest, carrying the news home to their people, they should come 
back, perhaps, with two or three hundred of their canoes, and devour 
us by mere multitude; so I consented to pursue them by sea; and 
running to one of their canoes, I jumped in, and bade Friday follow me ; 
but when I was in the canoe, I was suprised to find another poor 
creature lie there alive, bound hand and foot, as the Spaniard was, for 
the slaughter, and almost dead with fesir, not knowing what the matter 
was, for he had not been able to look up over the side of the boat ; he 
was tied so hard, neck and heels, and had been tied so long, that he had 
little life in him. 

I immediately cut the twisted flags, or rushes, that bound him, and 
would have helped him up; but he could not stand or speak, but 



170 



The Life and Adventures 



groaned most piteously, believing, it seems, still, that he was only un- 
bound in order to be killed. When Friday came, I bade him speak to 
him, and tell him of his deliverance ; and pulling out my bottle, made 
him give the poor wretch a dram, which, with the news of his being de- 
livered, revived him, and he sat up in the boat. But when Friday came 
to hear him speak, and looked in his feice, it would have moved any one 
to tears to have seen how Friday kissed him, embraced him, hugged 
him, cried, laughed, hallooed, jumped about, danced, sung, then cried 
again, wrung his hands, beat his own face and head, and then sung and 
jumped about again, like a distracted creature. It was a good while 
before I could make him speak to me, or tell me what was the matter ; 
but when he came a little to himself, he said that it was his father. 




It is not easy for me to express how it moved me, to see what ecstasy 
and filial affection had worked in this poor savage, at the sight of his 
father, and of his being delivered from death : nor indeed can I 
describe half the extravagance of his affection after this, for he went 
into the boat and out of the boat a great many times. When he went 
in to him, he would sit down by him, open his breast, and hold his 
father*s head close to his bosom haK an hour together, to nourish it ; 
then he took his arms and ancles, which were numbed and stiff with 
the binding, and chafed and rubbed them with his hands ; and I 
perceiving what the case was, gave him some rum out of my bottle to 
rub them with, which did them a deal of good. 

This action put an end to our pursuit of the canoe with the otlier 



of Robinson Crusoe, 171 

savages, who were now gotten almost out of sight ; and it was happy 
for us that we did not, for it blew so hard within two hours after, and 
before they could be gotten a quarter of their way, and continued 
blowing so hard all night, and that from the north-west, which was 
against them, that I could not suppose their boat could live, or that 
they ever reached to their own coast. 

But to return to Friday, he was so busy about his father, that I could 
not find in my heart to take him off for some time ; but after I thought 
he could leave him a little, I called him to me, and he came jumping 
and laughing, and pleased to the highest extreme. Then I asked him 
if he had given his father any bread. He shook his head, and said, 
" None : ugly dog eat all up self" So I gave him a cake of bread, out 
of a little pouch I carried on purpose ; I also gave him a dram for him- 
self, but he would not taste it, but carried it to his father. I had in 
my pocket also two or three bunches of my raisins, so I gave him a 
handful of them for his father. He had no sooner given his father 
these raisins, but- 1 saw him come out of the boat^ and run away, as if 
he had been bewitched. He ran at such a rate (for he was the swiftest 
fellow of his foot that ever I saw), I say, he ran at such a rate, that he 
was out of sight, as it were, in an instant ; and though I called and 
hallooed too after him, it was. all one : away he went, and in a quarter 
of an hour I saw him come back again, though not so fast as he went ; 
and as he came near I found his pace was slacker, because he had some- 
thing in his hand. 

When he came to me, I found he had been quite home for an 
earthen jug, or pot, to bring his father some fresh water, and that he 
had got two more cakes or loaves of bread. The bread he gave me, but 
the water he carried to his father ; however, as I was very thirsty too, 
I took a little sup of it. The water revived his father more than all 
the mm or spirits I had given him, for he was just fainting with 
thirst. 

When his father had drunk, I called to him to know if there was 
any water left ; he said, " Yes," and I bade him give it to the poor 
Spaniard, who was as much in want of it as his father, and I sent one 
of the cakes that Friday brought to the Spaniard too, who was indeed 
very weak, and was reposing himseK upon a green place, under the 
shade of a tree, and whose limbs were also very stiff, and very much 
swelled with the rude bandage he had been tied with. When I saw 
that, upon Friday's coming up to him with the water, he sat up and 
drank, and took the bread and began to eat, I went up to him and gave 
him a handful of raisins. He looked up in my face with all the tokens 



172 Jlie Life and Adventures 

of gratitude and thankfulness that co^ild appear in any countenance ; 
but was so weak, notwithstanding he had so exerted himself in the 
fight, that he could not stand upon his feet. He tried to do it two or 
three times, hut was really not able, his ancles were so swelled and so 
painful to him ; so I bade him sit still, and caused Friday to rub his 
ancles, and bathe them with rum, as he had done his father^s. 

I observed the poor affectionate creature, every two minutes, or 
perhaps less, all the while he was here, turned his head about to see for 
his father ; and at last he missed him, at which he started up, and 
without speaking a word, flew with that swiftness to him, that one could 
scarce perceive his feet to touch the ground as he went; but when he 
came, he found he had only laid himself down to ease his limbs. So 
Friday came back to me presently, and I then told hinri to help the 
Spaniard to the boat ; so he took him upon his back, and carried him 
beside his ^Either in the boat, and stepping out again, launched the boat 
off, and paddled it along the shore faster than I could walk, though the 
wind blew pretty hard too ; so he brought them both safe into our creek, 
and leaving them in the boat, runs away to fetch the other canoe. As he 
passed me, I spoke to him, and asked him whither he went He told 
me, " Go fetch more boat." So away he went, like the wind, for sure 
never man or horse ran like him ; and he had the other canoe in the 
creek almost as soon as I got to it by land : so he wafted me over, and 
then went to help our new guests out of the boat, which he did ; but 
they were neither of them able to walk, so that poor Friday knew not 
what to do. 

At last, we made a kind of hand-barrow to lay them on, and Friday 
and I carried them up both together upon it between us. But when 
we got them to the outside of our wall, or fortification, we were at a 
worse loss than before, for it was impossible to get them over ; and I 
was resolved not to break it down. So I set to work again ; and Friday 
and I, in about two hours* time, made a very handsome tent, covered 
with old sails, and above with boughs of trees, being in the same space 
without our outward fence, and between that and the grove of young 
wood which I had planted ; and here we made them two beds of such 
things as I had, namely, of good rice straw, with blankets laid upon 
it to lie on, and another to cover them on each bed. 

My island was now peopled, and I thought myself very rich in 
subjects ; and it was a merry reflection which I frequently made, how 
like a king I looked. First of all, the whole country was my own 
mere property, so that I had an undoubted right of dominion. Secondly, 
my people were perfectly subjected ; I was the absolute lord and law- 



of Rchimon Crusoe. 



173 



giver : they all owed their lives to me, and were ready to lay down 
their lives, if there had been occasion of it, for me. It was remarkable, 
too, I had but three subjects, and they were of three different religions : 
my man Friday was a Protestant ; his fetther was a pagan and a cannibal ; 
and the Spaniard was a Papist However, I allowed liberty of conscience 
to all my subjects. 

As soon as I had secured my two weak, rescued prisoners, and given 
them shelter, and a place to rest them upon, I began to think of making 
some provision for them ; and the first thing I did, I ordered Friday 
to take a yearling goat, betwixt a kid and a goat, out of my particular 
flock, to be killed. Then I cut off the hinder quarter, and chopping it 
into small pieces, I set Friday to work to boiling and stewing, and 
made them a very good dish of flesh and broth, and we all enjoyed it 
and eat heartily. 




After we had dined, or rather supped, I ordered Friday to take one 
of the canoes and go and fetch our muskets and other fire-arms from 
the place of battle ; and the next day I ordered him to go and bury 
the dead bodies of the savages, which lay open to the sun, and would 
presently be offensive; and I also ordered him to bury the horrid 
remains of their barbarous feast : all of which he punctually performed. 

I then began to enter into a little conversation with my two new 
subjects j and first I set Friday to inquire of his father what he thought 
of the escape of the savages in that canoe, and whether we might 
expect a return of them with a power too great for us to resist. His 
first opinion was, that the savages in the boat never could live out the 
storm which blew that night they went off, but must be drowned, or 



174 The Life cmd Adventures 

driyen south to those other shores, where they were as sore to be 
deyonred as they were to be drowned, if they were cast away ; bnt as 
to what they would do, if they came on shore, he said, he knew not ; 
but it was his opinion that they were so dreadfully frightened with the 
manner of their being attacked, the noise and the fire, that he believed 
they would teU their people they were all killed by thunder and light- 
ning and not by the hand of man ; and that the two which appeared 
(namely Friday and I) were two heavenly spirits and fories come down 
to destroy them, and not with weapons. And this old savage was 
right; for though they escaped the sea, they gave such dreadM 
accounts in their own country (as I heard afterwards), that they never 
ventured horn that part to my island again. 

But I was under continual apprehensions for some time, and kept 
upon my guard, I and all my army; for, as we were now four of us, I 
would have ventured upon a hundred of them, in the open field. 

In a little time, however, no more canoes appearing, the fear of them 
coming wore off, and I began to take my former thoughts of a voyage 
to the main into consideration, being likewise assured, by Friday's 
father, that I might depend upon good usage from their nation, on his 
account, if I would go. 

But my thoughts were a little suspended, when I had a serious dis- 
course with the Spaniard, and when I understood that there were 
sixteen more of his countrymen and Portuguese, who having been cast 
away, and made their escape to that side, lived there at peace indeed 
with the savages, but were very sore put to it for necessaries, and indeed 
for life. I asked him all the particulars of their voyage, and found 
they were a Spanish ship, bound from the Eio de la Plata to the 
Havannah, being directed to leave their loading there, which was 
chiefly hides and silver, and to bring back what European goods they 
could meet with there ; that they had five Portuguese seamen on board, 
whom they took out of another wreck; that five of their own men 
were drowned when first their ship was lost; and that these escaped 
through infinite dangers and hazards, and arrived, abnost starved, on the 
cannibal coast, where they expected to be devoured every moment 

He told me they had some arms with them, but they were perfectly 
useless, for they had neither powder nor ball, the washing of the sea 
having spoiled all their powder, but a Httle, which they used at their 
first landing to provide themselves some food. 

I asked him what he thought would become of them there, and if 
they had formed no design of making an escape. He said they had 
many consultations about it, but having neither vessel, nor tools to 



(yf Bohinsan Crusoe. 175 

l)aild one, nor proyisions of any kind, their counsels always ended in 
tears and despair. I asked him how he thought they would receive a 
proposal from me, which might tend towards an escape; and whether, 
if they were aU here, it might not be done. 

He told me they were all under the greatest distress imaginable, and 
if I would undertake their relief they would live and die by me. 

Upon these assurances, I resolved to venture to relieve them, if 
possible, and to send the old savage and the Spaniard over to them to 
treat But when he had gotten all things in readiness to go, the 
Spaniard himself started an objection, which had so much prudence in 
it on the one hand, and so much sincerity on the other hand, that I 
could not but be well satisfied in it; and, by his advice, put off the 
deliverance of his comrades for at least half-a-year. The case was 
thus : — ^He had been with us now about a month, during which time I 
had let him see in what manner I had provided, with the assistance of 
Providence, for my support; and he saw evidently what stock of com 
and rice I had laid up, which, as it was more than suf&cient for 
myself, so it was not sufficient, at least without good husbandry, for my 
family, now it was increased to the number of four; but much less 
would it be sufficient, if his countrymen, who were, as he said, fourteen, 
still alive, should come over; and, least of all, would it be sufficient to 
victual our vessel, if we should build one, for a voyage to any of the 
Christian colonies of America. So he told me he thought it would be 
more advisable to let him and the two others dig and cultivate more 
land, as much as I could spare seed to sow; and that we should wait 
another harvest^ then we might have a supply of com for his country- 
men, when they should come ; for want might be a temptation to them 
to disagree, or not think themselves delivered, otherwise than out of 
one difficulty into another. 

His caution was so seasonable, and his advice so good, that I could 
not but be very well pleased with his proposal, as well as I was satisfied 
with his fidelity. So we fell to digging, all four of us, as well as the 
wooden tools we were famished with permitted; and in about a 
month's time, by the end of which it was seed time, we had gotten as 
much land cured, and trimmed up, as we sowed twenty-two bushels of 
barley on, and sixteen jars of rice, which was, in short, all the seed we 
had to spare. 

Having now society enough, and our number being sufficient to put 
us out of fear of savages, if they had come, unless their number had 
been very great, we went fireely all over the island, wherever we found 
occasion ; and as we had our escape or deliverance upon our thoughts,

tequest that lie should leave tibLem iqion the island, of wMoli ibo 
captain said he should be very glad. I accoidinglj sent ler them, and 
entered seriouslj into discourse with them upon l^ir cireumstaiicea. 
One of them answered in the name of the rest, that they had nothing 
to say but this,4hat when they were taken, the captain promised them 
their lives, and they humbly implored my mercy. But I toM them I 
knew not what mercy to show them j for, as for myself I had resolved 
to quit the island with all my men, and had taken passage with the 
captain to go to England ; and as for the captain, he would not cany 
them to England, but as prisoners in irons^ to be tried for mutiny and 
running away with the ship ; the consequence of which, they must 
needs know, would be the gallows : so that I could not teU which was 
best for them, unless they had a mind to take th^ir &te in the island ; 
if they desired that^ I did not care, as I had liberty to leave it ; I had 
some inclination to give them their lives, if they could shift on shore. 
They seemed very thankful for it ; and said they would rather ventoze 
to stay there, than to be carried to Engkmd to be hanged. 

I then told them, I would let them into the story of my living theora^ 
and put them into the way of making it easy to them. Accordingly I 
gave them the whole histoiy of the place, and of my coming to it ; 
showed them my fortifications, the way I made my bread, planted my 
com, cured my grapes, and, in a word, all that was necessary to make 
them easy. I told them the story of the Spaniards that were to be ex- 
pected, for whom I left a letter, and made them promise ,to treat them 
in common with themselves. 

I left them five muskets, three fowling-pieces, and three swords. I 
had about a barrel and a half of powder, which I left them. I gave 
them a description of the way I managed the goats, and directions to 
milk and fatten them, to make both butter and cheese. In a word, I 
gave them every part of my own story ; and I told them I would pre- 
vail with the captain to leave them two barrels of gunpowder more, and 
some garden seeds, which I told them I would have been very glad of; 
also I gave them the bag of peas which the captain had brought me, 
and bade them to be sure to sow and increase them. 

Having done this, I left them the next day, and went on board the 
ship. The next morning two of the five men came swimming to the 
ship's side, and making a most lamentable complaint of the other three, 
begged to be taken into the shjp, for Grod's sake, for they should be 
murdered. 

The captain pretended to have no .power without me; but^ after 
aome difficulty, and after their solemn promises of amendment, they

Under these instructions, the Spaniard and the old savage went away 
in one of the canoes which they came in, when they were brought as 
prisoners to be devoured by the savages. I gave each of them a 
musket, and about eight charges of powder and ball, charging them to 
be very careful of both, and not to use either of them, but upon very 
urgent occasions. 




This was a cheerful work, being the first measures used by me, in 
view of my deliverance, for now twenty-seven years and some days. I 
gave them provisions of bread and of dried grapes, sufl&cient for them- 
selves for many days, and sufficient for all their countrymen for about 
eight days ; and wishing them a good voyage, I let them go, agreeing 
with them about a signal they should hang out at their return, by 
which I should know them again, when they came back, at a distance 
before they came on shore. 

They went away, with a fair gale, on the day that the moon was 
at the fuU, by my account, in the month of October, as near as I 
could telL 

It was no less than eight days I waited for them, when a strange and 
unforeseen occurrence intervened, of which, the like has not, perhaps, 
been heard of in history. I was fast asleep in my hut one morning, 
when my man Friday came running in to me, and called aloud, " Master, 
master, they are come, they are come ! " I jumped up, and, regardless 
of danger, went out, as soon as I could get my clothes on, through my 
little grove ; I went without my arms, which it was not my custom to 
do ; but I was surprised, when, turning my eyes to the sea, I presently

He satisfied us there was no danger of that kind in the way that 
we were to go. So we readily agreed to follow him, as did also twelve 
other gentlemen, with their servants, some French, some Spanish, who, 
as I said, had attempted to go, and were obliged to come back again. 

Accordingly, we all set out from Fampelima, with our guide, on the 
15th of November; and, indeed, I was surprised, when, instead of 
going forward, he came directly back with us above twenty miles ; on 
the same road by which we came from Madrid, when, having passed two 
rivers, and come into the plain country, we found ourselves in a warm 
climate again, where the country was pleasant, and no snow was to be 
seen ; but, on a sudden, turning to the left, he approached the moun- 
tains by another way ; and though, it is true, the hHls and the precipices 
looked dreadful, yet he made so many tours, and meanders, and led vm

two lifted up their hands sometimes^ and appeared concerned indeed, 
but not so much as the first. 

I was perfectly confounded at the sight, and knew not what the 
meaning of it could be. Friday called out to me, in English, ba well 
as he could, '* master, you see English mans eat prisoners as well as 
savage mans." " Why," said I, ** do you think they are going to eat 
them, then 1 " " Yes," says Friday, « they will eat them." " No, no," 
said I, ** Friday, I am a&Eiid they will murder them, indeed, but you 
may be sure they will not eat them." 

All this while I had no thoughts of what the matter really was, but 
expected every moment the three prisoners would be killed ; and once 
I saw one of the villains lift up his arm, with a great cutlass or sword, 
to strike one of the poor men, and I expected 1)0 see him fall every 
moment. I wished heartily now for my Spaniard, and the savage that 
was gone with him ; or that I had any w^y to have come undiscovered 
within shot of them, that I might have rescued the three men, for they 
had no fire-arms that I saw. 

After I had observed the outrageous usage of the three men by the 
insolent seamen, I saw that the fellows ran scattering about the land, 
as if they wanted to see the country. I observed, also, that the three 
other men had liberty to go where they pleased, but that they sat down 
all three upon the ground, very pensive, and looked like men in despair. 

It was just at the top of high water when these people came on shore, 
and while partly they stood parleying with the prisoners they brought, 
And partly while they rambled about to see what kind of place they 
were in, they had carelessly stayed till the tide was spent, and the 
water was ebbed consideraWy away, leaving the boat aground. They 
had left two men in the boat, who, as I found afterwards, having drank 
a little too much brandy, fell asleep. However, one of them wakening 
sooner than the other, and finding the boat too fast aground for hiTn to 
stir it, hallooed for the rest, who were straggling about, upon which 
they all soon came to the boat, but it was past all their strength to 
launch her, the boat being very heavy, and the shore on that side being 
a soft, oozy sand, almost like a quicksand. In this condition, like true 
seaman, who are, perhaps, the least of all mankind given to forethought, 
they gave it over, and away they strolled about the country again; and 
I heard one of them say aloud to another (calling them off from the 
boat), "Why, let her alone. Jack, can't ye! She'll float next tide." By 
which I was fully confirmed what countrymen they were. 

All this while I kept myseK close, not once daring to stir out of my 
casfle, any farther than to my place of obversation near the top of the

upon him, bat went up dose to him, and shot him as above ; wheieai^ 
any of ns would have fiied at a &rther distance, and mighty pexhapfl^ 
have either missed the wolf, or shot the man. 

But it was enongh to have terrified abolder man than I ; and indeed 
it alarmed all our company, when, with the noise of Friday's pistol, we 
heard on both sides the most dismal howling of wolves^ and the noise 
redoubled by the echo of the mountains. 

My man Friday had delivered our guide, and when we came up he 
was helping him oJQT from his horse, for the man was both hurt and 
lightened, and indeed the last more than the first 

We had one dangerous place to pass, of which our guide told us, if 
there were any more wolves in the countiy, we should find them there ; 
and this was a small plain, surrounded with woods on every side, and 
a lon^ narrow defile, or lane^ which we were to pass^ to get through the 
wood, and then we should come to a village where we were to lodge. 

It was within half an hour of sunset when we entered the first wood ; 
and a little after sunset we came into the plain. We met with nothing 
in the first wood, except that^ in a little plain, within the wood, which 
was not above two furlongs over, we saw five great wolves cross the 
road, fall speed, one after another, as if they had been in chase of some 
prey they had in view. They took no notice of us, and were gone^ and 
out of our sight in a few moments. 

This gave us leisure to charge our pieces again, and that we might 
lose no time, we kept going ; but we had little more than loaded our 
fasils, and put ourselves into readiness, when we heard a terrible noise 
in the wood on our left. 

The night was coming on, and the light began to be dusky, which 
made it the worse on our side ; but the noise increasing, we could easily 
perceive that it was the howling of those ravenous creatures ; and, on 
a sudden, we perceived two or three troops of wolves, one on our left> 
one behind us, and one in our front, and we knew not what course to 
take ; but the creatures resolved us soon, for they gathered about us, in 
hopes of prey ; and I verily believe there were three hundred of them. It 
happened very much to our advantage, that, at the entrance into the wood 
there lay some large timber trees, cut down, and I drew my little troop 
in among these trees, and placing ourselves in a line, behind one long 
tree, I advised them all to alight, and keeping that tree before us, for a 
breast-work, to stand in a triangle or three fronts, enclosing our horses 
in the centre. We did so ; and it was well we did, for never was a 
more furious charge than the creatures made upon us in this place : 
they came on us with a growling kind of noise, and mounted the piece

answer at all, but I thouglit I perceived them just going to fly &om me^ 
when I spoke to them in English : — *• Gentlemen," said I, " do not be 
surprised at me ; perhaps you may have a friend near you, when you 
do not expect it." " He must be sent directly from heaven, then," said 
one of them very gravely to me, and pulling off his hat at the same 
time, " for our condition is past the help of man." " All help is from 
heaven, sir," said I, " but can you put a stranger in the way how to 
help you, for you seem to be in some great distress 1 I saw you whoi 
you landed ; and when you seemed to make application to the brutes 
tiiat came with you, I saw one lift up his sword to kill you." 

The poor man, with tears running down his fece, and trembling, 
looking like one astonished, returned, ** Am I talking to God or man % 
Is it a real man, or an angell" ''Be in no fear about that^ sir," said 
I, "if God had sent an angel to relieve you, he would have come 
better clothed, and armed after another manner, than you see me. 
Pray lay aside your fears, I am a man, an Englishman, and disposed 
to assist you, you see. I have one servant only : we have arms and 
ammunition, tell us freely, can we serve you 1 "What is your case ?" 

" Our case, sir," said he, " is too long to tell you, while our mur- 
derers are sp near ; but, in short, sir, I was commander of that ship, 
my men have mutinied against me, they have been hardly prevailed 
upon not ta murder me, and, at last^ have set me on shore in this 
desolate place, with these two men with me, one my mate, the other 
a passenger, where we expected to parish, believing the place to be 
uninhabited, and know not yet what to think of it" 

"Where are those brutes, your enemies?" said I, "do you know 
where they are gone?" "There they are, sir," said he, pointing to 
a thicket of trees, " my heart trembles for fear they have seen us, and 
heard you speak ; if they have, they will murder us alL" 

" Have they any fire-arms ?" said I. He answered, "They had only 
two pieces, and one which they left in the boat" " Well, then," said 
I, " leave the rest to me. I see they are asleep. It is an easy thing 
to kiU them all ; but shall we rather take them prisoners ?" He told 
me there were two desperate villains among them, that was scarce safe 
to show any mercy to, but if they were secured, he believed aU the 
rest would return to their duty. I asked him which they were. He 
told me he could not^ at that distance, describe them ; but he would 
obey my orders in anything I would direct. " Well," said I, " let us 
retreat out of their view or hearing, lest they awake, and we will 
resolve farther." So they willingly went back with me, till the woods 
covered us from them. " Look you, sir," said I, " if I venture upon

your delirerance, are yon willing to make two conditioiis with me V* 
He anticipated my proposaLs, by telling me, that both he and the ship, 
if recovered, should be wholly directed and commanded by me in 
everything; and if the ship was not recovered, he would live and 
die with me, in what part of the world soever I would send ^im^ and 
the two others said the same. 

"Well,*'' said I, "my conditions are but two ; first, that while you 
stay on this island with me, you will not pretend to any authority 
here ; and if I put arms in your hands, you will, upon all occasions, 
give them up to me, and do no prejudice to me or mine, upon this 
island ; and, in the meantime, be governed by my orders. Secondly, 
that if the ship is, or may be, recovered, you will carry me and my 
man to Eng^d passage free.*' He gave me all the assurances that 
the invention and fidth of man could devise, that he would comply 
with these most reasonable demands, and, besides, would owe his life 
to me, and acknowledge it, upon all occasions, as long as he lived. 

" Well, then," said I, " here are three muskets for you, with powder 
and ball. Tell me next what you think is proper to be done." He 
showed all the testimony of his gratitude that he was able ; but offered 
to be wholly guided by me. I told him I thought it was hard ven- 
turing anything, but the best method I could think of was to fire upon 
them at once, as they lay; and if any were not killed at the first 
volley, and offered to submit, we might save them, and so put it 
wholly upon God's providence to direct the shot. 

He said, very modestly, that he was loath to kill them, if he could 
help it, but that those two were incorrigible villains, and had been 
the authors of all the mutiny in the ship, and if they escaped we 
should be undone still, for they would go on board and bring the 
whole ship's company, and destroy us alL "Well, then," said I, 
** necessity legitimates my advice ; for it is the only way to save our 
lives." However, seeing him still cautious of shedding blood, I told 
him they should go themselves, and manage as they found convenient. 

In the middle of this discourse we heard some of them awake, and 
soon after we saw two of them on their feet. I asked him if either 
of them were the men who, he had said, were the heads of the mutiny. 
He said, " No." " Well, then," said I, " you may let them escape ; 
and Providence seems to have awakened them on purpose to save 
themselves." "Kow," said I, "if the rest escape you, it is your 
fault." 

Animated with this, he took the musket I had given him in his 
hand, and a pistol in his belt, and his two comrades with him, each

man a piece in his hand. The two men who were with him, going 
firsts made some noise, at which one of the seamen, who was awake,* 
turned about, and seeing them coming, cried out to the rest; but it 
was too late then, for the moment he cried out, the two men fired, the 
captain wisely reserving his own piece. They had so well aimed their 
shot at the men they knew, that one of them was killed on the spot, 
and the other very much wounded; but, not being dead, he started up 
upon his feet, and called eagerly for help to the other; but the captain, 
stepping to him, told him it was too late to cry for help, he should call 
upon GrOD to forgive his villany, and, with that word, knocked him 
down with the stock of his musket, so that he never spoke more. 
There were three more in the company, and one of them was also 
slightly wounded. By this time I was come; and when they saw 
their danger, and that it was in vain to resist, they begged for mercy. 
The captain told them he would spare their lives, if they would give 
him any assurance of their abhorrence of the treachery they had been 
guilty of, and would swear to be faithM to him in recovering the 
ship, and afterwards in carrying her back to Jamaica, from whence 
they came. They gave him all the protestations of their sincerity that 
could be desired, and he was willing to believe them, and spare their 
lives, which I was not against; only I obliged him to keep them 
bound, hand and foot, while they were upon the island. 

While this was doing, I sent Friday, with the captain's mate, to the 
boat, with orders to secure her, and bring away the oars and sail, which 
they did ; and, by the bye, three straggling men, that were parted from 
the rest, came back again upon hearing the guns fired ; and seeing 
their captain, who was before their prisoner, now their conqueror, they 
submitted to be bound also. 

It now remained that the captain and I should inquire into one 
another's circumstances. I began first, and told him my whole history, 
which he heard with an attention even to amazement, and particularly 
at the wonderful manner of my being furnished with provisions and 
ammunition ; and, indeed, as my story is a whole collection of wonders, 
it affected him deeply ; but when he reflected from thence upon himself, 
and how I seemed to have been preserved there on purpose to save his 
life, the tears ran down his face, and he could not speak a word more. 

After this oommunciation was at an end, I carried him and his two 
men into my apartment, leading them in just where I came out, namely, 
at the top of the house, where I refreshed them with such provisions 
as I had, and showed them all the contrivances I had made during my 
long inhabiting this place. 



THE FARTHER ADVENTURES 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 



That homely proverb used on so many occasions in England, namely, 
That what is bred in the bone will not go out of the flesh, was never 
more verified than in the story of my life. Any one would think that 
after thirty-five years' affliction, and a variety of imhappy circumstances, 
which few men, if any, ever went through before, and after near seven 
years of peace and' enjoyment in the fulness of all things ; growing 
old, and when, if ever, it might be allowed me to have had such 
experience of every state of middle life, as to know which was most 
adapted to make a man happy ; I say, after aU this, any one would 
have thought that the native propensity to rambling, which first sent 
me out into the world, should be worn out, and that I might at 
sixty-one have been inclined to stay at home, and have done venturing 
life and fortune any more. ^ 

N"ay farther, the common motive for foreign adventures was taken 
away in me ; for I had no fortune to make, I had nothing to seek : for, 
if I had gained ten thousand pounds, I had been no richer ; for I had 
already sufficient for my wants, and for those I had to leave it to ; and 
that I had was visibly increasing ; for having no great family, I could 
not spend what I had, unless I would set up for an expensive way of 
living, such as a great family, servants, equipage, gaiety, and the like, 
which were things I had no inclination to ; so that I had nothing 
indeed to do but to sit still, enjoy what I had got, and see it increase 
daily upon my hands. 

Yet aU these things had no effect upon me, or at least not enough 
to resist the strong inclination I had to go abroad again, which hung 
about me like a chronic distemper ; particularly the desire of seeing 
my new plantation in the island, and the colony I left there, which 
run in my head continually. I dreamed of it aU night, and my 



of Robinson Crusoe, 185 

Upon this, I told him the first thing we had to do was to stave the 
boat, which lay upon the beach, so that they might not carry her off : 
and taking everything out of her, leave her so far useless as not to be 
fit to swim. Accordingly we went on board, took the arms which were 
left on board out of her, and whatever else we found there, which was 
a bottle of brandy, and another of rum, a few biscuit cakes, a horn of 
powder, and a great lump of sugar, in a piece of canvass ; the sugar 
was five or six pounds : dl which was very welcome to me, especially 
the brandy and sugar, of which I had been without many years. 

When we had carried aU these things on shore, we knocked a great 
hole in her bottom, that if they had come strong enough to master us, 
yet they could not carry off the boat. 

Indeed, it was not much in my thoughts that we could be capable to 
recover the ship ; but my view was, that if they went away without 
the boat^ I did not much question to make her fit again to carry us 
away to the Leeward Islands, and call upon our friends the Spaniards 
in my way. 

While we were thus preparing our designs, and had first, by main 
strength, heaved the boat upon the beach, so high that the tide would 
not float her off at high- water mark ; and, besides, had broken a hole 
in her bottom too big to be qtiickly stopped, and were sat down musing 
what we should do, we heard the ship fire a gun, and saw her make a 
waft with her ancient, as a signal for the boat to come on board ; but 
no boat stirred, and they fired several times, making other signals for 
the boat. 

At last, when all their signals and firings proved fruitless, and they 
found the boat did not stir, we saw them (by the help of my glasses) 
hoist another boat off, and row towards the shore ; and we found, as 
they approached, that there were no less than ten men in her, and that 
they had fire-arras with them. 

As the ship lay almost two leagues from the shore, we had a fall view 
of them as they came. The captain knew the persons and characters 
of all the men in the boat, of whom he said that there were three very 
honest fellows, who, he was sure, were led into this conspiracy by the 
rest, being overpowered and frightened : but that as for the boatswain, 
who, it seems, was the chief officer among them, and all the rest, they 
were as outrageous as any of the ship's crew, and were, no doubt, made 
desperate in their new enterprise. 

We had, upon the first appearance of the boats' coming from the 
ship, considered of separating our prisoners, and had indeed secured 
them effectually. Two of them, of whom the captain was less assured 



186 lie I4fe and Adventures 

than (xr^inaij, I sent witikTiidayy and osie of 

my cave^ where they ireie remote enoo^ and oat of danger of being 
beaid or diaooreredy or of finding their way out of the wooda. They 
left them boond, hat gave them proviaiona^ and piomiaed them^if thej 
continaed there qoieHy, to give them their liberty in a day or two; but 
that if they attempted their escape, they ahoald be pat to death without 
mercy. Xhey promised MthfoUy to bear their confinement witk 



The other priaonen had better oaage: two of them were kept 
pinioned indeed, because the captain did not like to troat them, bat 
the other two were taken in to my service, apon their captain's reoonk-' 
mendation, and apon their solemnly engaging to live and die with na 

As soon as they got to the place where their other boat lay, they 
ran their boat into the beach, and came all on dbore, haoling the bcal; 
ap after them, which I was glad to see; for I was afraid they would 
rather have left the boat and anchor, some distance from the ahoie^ 
with some hands in her to goard her, and so we shoald not be able 
to seize the boat 

Being on shoie, tibiey ran all to the other boat ; and it was easy to see 
they were onder a great sorpiise to find her stripped, and a great hole 
in the bottom. After this, they set up a great shout ; but it was all to 
no purpose : then they came aU close in a ring, and fired a Yolley of 
their small arms, which indeed we heard, and the echoes made the wooda 
ring, but it was all one ; those in the caye we were sure could not hear, 
and those in our keeping, though they heard it well enough, yet durst 
give no answer to them. 

They were so surprised at this, as they told us afterwards, that they 
resolved to go all on board again to their ship, and let them know- 
there that the men were all mrudered, and the long boat staved; accord- 
ingly, they inmiediately launched their boat again, and got all of them, 
onboard 

The captain was terribly amazed, and eyen confounded at this, 
believing they would go on board the ship again, and set sail, giving 
their comrades up for lost, and so he shoald stiLl lose the ship, which 
he was in hopes we should have recovered, but he was quickly as 
much frightened the other way. 

They had not been long put oiff with the boat, but we perceived them 
aU. coming on shore agaiu ; and they left three men in the boat, and 
the rest went up into the country to look for their fellows. This av;is 
a great disappointment to us, for now we were at a loss what to do ; 
for our seizing those seven men on shore would be no advtintage to us 



of Bohinson Crusoe. 187 

if we let the boat escape, because they would then row away to the 
ship, and then the rest of them would be sure to weigh, and set sail, 
and so our hope of recovering the ship would be lost. However, we 
had no remedy but to wait and see what the issue of things might 
present. The seven men came on shore, and the three who remained 
in the boat put her off to a good distance from the shore, and came to 
an anchor, to wait for them, so that it was impossible for us to come at 
them in the boat. 

Those that came on shore kept elose together, marching towards the 
top of the little hill, under which my habitation lay, and we could see 
them plainly, though they could not perceive us. And when they 
were come to the brow of the hill, where they could see a great way 




into the vaUeys and woods which lay towards the north-east part, and 
where the island lay lowest, they shouted till they were weary, and then 
they sat down to consider of it. Had they gone to sleep there, as the 
other party did, they had done for us ; but they were too full of appre- 
hension of danger to venture to go to sleep, though they could not tell 
what the danger was. 

The captain made a very just proposal to me upon this consultation 
of theirs, namely, that perhaps they would all fire a volley again, to 
endeavour to make their fellows hear, and that we should all sally 
upon them just at the juncture when their pieces were all discharged, 
and they would certainly yield, and we should have them without 
bloodshed. I liked the proposal, provided it was done while we were 



188 The Lift md Adventures 

near enougli to come up to them before iiiey conld load their pieces 
again. 

Bat this event did not happen, and we lay still a long time, very 
irresolute what coarse to take ; at length I told them there woold be 
nothing to be done, in mj opinion, till night : and then, if they did 
not return to the boat, perhaps we might use some stratagem with them 
in the boat to get them on shore. 

We waited a great while, and were very uneasy; when, we saw them 
all start up, and march towards the sea. It seems they had such 
dreadful apprehensions upon them of the danger of the place, that they 
resolved to go on board the ship again, give their companions over for 
lost, and so go on their intended voyage with the ship. 

As soon as I perceived them go towards the shore, I imagined that 
they had given over their search, and were for going back agaio ; and 
the captain was ready to sink when I told him my thoughts, but I 
presently thought of a stratagem to fetch them back agaLo, and which 
answered my end to a tittle. 

I ordered Friday and the captain's mate, to go over the little creek 
westward, towards the place where Friday was rescued, and at about 
half a mile distance, I bade them halloo as loud as they could, and as 
soon as they heard the seamen answer them, they should return it again, 
and then, keeping out of sight, take a round, and then wheel about 
again to me by such ways as I directed. 

They were just going into the boat> when Friday and the mate 
hallooed, and they presently heard them, and answering, run along the 
shore westward, towards the voice they heard, when they were stopped 
by the creek, the water being up, they could not get over, and called 
for the boat to come and set them over, as, indeed, I expected. 

When they had set themselves over, I observed that they took one 
of the three men out of her, and left only two in the boat, having 
fastened her to a stump of a little tree on the shore. 

This was what I wished for; and immediately leaving Friday and the 
captain's mate to their business, I took the rest with me, and crossing 
the Creole out of their sight, we surprised the two men before they were 
aware, one of them lying on the shore between sleeping and waking, 
and, going to start up, the captain, who was foremost, ran in upon him 
and knocked him down, and then called to him in the boat to yield or 
he was a dead man. 

There needed very few arguments to persuade a single man to yield, 
when he saw five men upon him, and his comrade knocked down: 
besides, this was, it seems, one of the three men who were not so hearty 



of Robinson Onuoe. 189 

in the mutiny as the rest of the crew, and, therefore, was easily persuaded 
not only to yield, but afterwards to join very sincerely with us. 

In the mean time, Friday and the captain's mate so well managed 
their business with the rest, that they drew them, by hallooing and 
answering, from one wood to smother, till they not only heartily tired 
them, but lefb them where they were sure they could not reach back 
before it was dark: and indeed they were heartily tired themselves also 
by the time they came back to us. 

It was several hours after Friday came back to me before they came 
back to their boat; and we could hear the foremost of them long before 
they came quite up, calling to those behind to come along, and could 
hear them answer, and complain how lame and tired they were, and 
not able to come any faster, which was very welcome news to us. 

At length they came up to the boat, but it is impossible to express 
their confusion when they found the boat fast aground in the creek, and 
their two men gone ; we could hear them telling one another they were 
gotten into an enchanted island; that either there were inhabitants in 
it, and they should all be murdered, or else there were devils or spirits 
in it, and they should be carried away and devoured. 

They hallooed again, and called their two comrades by their names, 
but got no answer. After some time, we could see them by the 
little light there was run about like men in despair; and that 
sometimes they would go and sit down in the boat to rest themselves, 
then come on shore again, and walk about, and so the same thing 
over again. 

My men would have fallen upon them in the dark, but I was willing 
to spare them, and kill as few of them as I could, being unwilling to 
hazard the killing any of our men, knowing the others were well 
armed. I resolved to wait and make sure of them, and drew my 
ambuscade nearer, and ordered Friday and the captain to creep upon 
their hands and knees, and get as near them as they possibly could 
before they offered to fire. 

They had not been long in that posture, when the boatswain, who 
was the principal ringleader, and had now shown himself the most 
dispirited of all the rest, walked towards them with two more of their 
crew. The captain was so eager at having the principal rogue so much 
in his power, that he could hardly have patience to let him come so 
near as to be sure of him, for he only heard his tongue before ; but 
when they came nearer, the captain and Friday, starting up on their 
feet^ let fly at them. 

The boatswain was killed on the spot, the next was shot through the

o&er, except my andent good fiiend the widoWi who eameBtly 
entteated me to conmder my yean, my easy dicnmatatioeBy and the 
needless hazard of a long voyage ; and, above all, my yoang childiun : 
hat it was all to no purpose; I had an iiresistible desire to the 
voyage ; and such was tlie impression I had npon my mind lor the 
voyage, that I told her I thought it would be a kind of resisting 
Providence, if I should attempt to stay at home ; after this she ceased 
her expostulations^ and joined with me^ not only in making provision 
for my voyage, bat also in settling my fiunily affidis in n^ absence^ 
and providing for .the edooation of my diQdpen. 

In Older to 'this, I made my will, and settled the estate I had in 
sach a manner £>r my children, and placed it in such hand£^ that I 
was perfectly easy ; satisfied that Uiey would have justice done them, 
whatever might befal me ; as for their education, I left it wholly to 
my widow, with a sufficient maintenance to herself lor her care : all 
which she richly deserved; £>r no mother could have taken more 
care in their education, or understand it better ; and I lived to thank 
her tot it 

My nephew was ready to sail about the beginning of January, 1694, 
and I with my man Friday went on board in the Downs on the 8th, 
having; besides the frame of that eloop which I mentioned above, a 
very considerable cargo of all kinds of necessary things for my colony, 
which, if I did not find in good condition, I resolved at least to 
leave it so. 

First, I carried with me some servants, whom I purposed to place 
there, as inhabitants, or at least to set on work there upon my own 
account, while I stayed, and either to leave them there, or carry them 
forward, as they should appear willing ; particularly I carried two car- 
penters, a smith, and a very handy ingenious fellow who was a cooper 
by trade, but was also a general mechanic ; for he was dexterous at mak* 
ing wheels, and handTnills to grind com, was a good turner, a good 
pot-maker ; he also made any thing that was proper to make of earth, 
or of wood ; in a word, we called him our " Jack of all trades." 

With these I carried a tailor, who had offered himself to go pas- 
senger to the East Indies with my nephew, but afterwards consented 
to stay on our plantation, and proved as handy a fellow as could be 
desired, in many other businesses besides ; for, as I observed formerly, 
necessity arms us for all employments. 

My cargo, as near as I can recollect, for I have not kept an account 
of the particulars, consisted of a sufficient quantity of linen, and some 



of Robinson Crusoe, 215 

thin EDglish stuffs, enough for clothing the Spaniards I expected to 
find there, comfortably for the next seven years ; these materials, with 
gloves, hats, shoes, stockings, and all such things as they could want 
for wearing, amounted to above 200 pounds, including some beds, 
bedding, and household-stuff', particularly kitchen utensils, with pots, 
kettles, pewter, bi-ass, &c. and near a hundred pound more in iron- 
work, nails, tools of every kind, staples, hooks, hinges, and every 
necessary thing I could think ofl 

I carried also a hundred spare arms, muskets, and fusees, besides 
some pistols, a considerable quantity of shot of all sizes, and two 
pieces of brass cannon ; and, because I knew not what time, and what 
extremities I was providing for, I carried a hundred barrels of powder, 
besides swords, cutlasses, and the iron part of some pikes and 
halberts ; so, that, in short, we had a large magazine of all sorts of 
stores; and I made my nephew carry two small quarter-deck guns 
more than he wanted for his ship, to leave behind, to assist us to 
maintain possession of the island. 

I had not such bad luck in this voyage as I had been used to meet 
with; yet some odd accidents, cross winds, and bad weather did 
happen, which made the voyage longer than I expected ; and I, who 
had never made but one voyage, namely, my first voyage to Guinea, in 
which I might be said to come back again, as the voyage was at first 
designed, began to think the same ill fate still attended me ; and that 
I was born to be never contented with being on shore, and yet to be 
always unfortunate at sea. 

Contrary winds first put up to the northward, and we were obliged 
to put in at Galway, in Ireland, were we lay wind-bound two-and- 
twenty days; but we had this satisfaction with the disaster, that 
provisions were here exceeding cheap, and in the utmost plenty ; so 
that while we lay here we never touched the ship's stores, but rather 
added to them ; here also I took in several live hogs, and two cows, 
and calves, which I resolved, if I had a good passage, to put on shore 
in my island ; but we found occasion to dispose otherwise of them. 

We set out the 5th of February, from Ireland, and had a very fair 
gale of wind for some days. As I remember, it might be about the 
20th of February in the evening, late, when the mate having the 
watch, came into the round-house, and told us he saw a flash of fire, 
and heard a gun fired ; and while he was telling us of it, a boy came 
in, and told us the boatswain heard another. This made us all run out 
upon the quarter-deck, where for a while we heard nothing, but in a 
iQw minutes we saw a very great lights and found that there was some

rery teniUe fiie at a diatanoe ; immediatelj we had zeoooxw to our 
leckoningSy and all agreed that there oould be no land in the dneetum 
of the fixe, no^ not for 500 leagoea, fixr it appeared at W.N.W. XTpon 
this we condnded it must be some diip on fixe at sea; from the noiae 
of guns, heard jnat befere, we condnded it conld not be &r oil^ and 
stood direetlj towards it The flEffther we saHed, the greater the li^t 
appeared^ though the weather being hazy we conld perceive noOiing 
but the flames for a whUe ; in about half an honr^s sailings the wind 
being &ir for us, though not mnch of it^ and the weather clearing np 
a little, we could plainly discern a great ahip on fire in the middle of 
the sea. 




I was most sensibly touched with this disaster ; I recollected what 
condition I was in when taken up by the Portuguese captain ; but bow 
much more deplorable the circumstances of the poor creatures belonging 
to this ship must be if they had no other ship in company with them : 
upon this I immediately ordered that five guns should be fired, one 
soon after another, that^ if possible, we might give notice to them that 
there was help at hand, and that they might endeavour to save them- 
selves in their boat ; for though we could see the flame of the ship, yet 
they, it being night, could see nothing of us. 

We lay by some time upon this, only driving as the burning ship 
drove, waiting for day-light ; when on a sudden, to our great terror, 
though we had reason to expect it, the ship blew up in the air, and 
immediately, that is to say, in a few minutes, all the fire was out, and 
the rest of the ship sunk ; this was a terrible, and indeed afflicting 



of Robinson Crusoe. 217 

sight ; for the sake of the poor men, who, I conclnded, must be either 
all destroyed in the ship, or be in the utmost distress in their boat in 
the middle of the ocean, which at present, by reason it was dark, I 
could not see : however, to direct them as well as I could, I caused 
lights to be hung out in all the parts of the ship ; and kept firing 
guns all the night long ; letting them know by this, that there was a 
ship not far off. 

About eight o'clock in the morning, we discovered the ship's boats, 
by the help of our glasses ; there were two of them, both thronged with 
people, and deep in the water ; we perceived they rowed, the wind being 
against them ; that they saw our ship, and did their utmost to make 
us see them. 

We immediately spread our ancient, to let them know we saw them ; 
and hung a waft out, as a signal for them to come on board ; and then 
made more sail, standing directly to them. In a little more than half 
an hour, we came up with them, and, in a word, took them all in, being 
no less than sixty-four men, women, and children ; for there were a 
great many passengers. We found it was a French merchant-ship of 
300 ton, homeward bound from Quebec. The master gave us a long 
account of the distress of his ship, how the fire began in the steerage 
by the negligence of one of the men ; it was, as everybody thought, 
entirely put out : when they found that some sparks of the first fire 
had gotten into another part of the ship, so difficult to come at, that 
they could not quench it, tiU getting between the timbers, and within 
the ceiling of the ship, it penetrated into the hold, and mastered all the 
skiU and application they were able to exert They got into their 
boats, which, to their great comfort, were pretty large : being a long 
boat, and a great shallop, besides a small skifl^ which was of no great 
service to them, other than to carry some fresh water and provisions. 
They had sails, oars, and a compass ; and were preparing to make the 
best of their way back to Newfoundland, the wind blowing an easy gale 
at S.E. by E. They had as much provisions and water, as, with sparing 
it so as to be next door to starving, might support them about twelve 
days ; in which, if they had no bad weather, and no contrary winds, 
the captain hoped he might reach the banks of Newfoundland. But 
there were many chances against them ; storms to overset and founder 
them ; rains and cold to benumb their limbs ; contrary winds to keep 
them out and starve them ; that it must have been next to miraculous 
if they had escaped in this way. In the midst of their consultations, 
every one being hopeless, and ready to despair, as the captain told me 
with tears in his eyes, they heard the guns which I caused to be fired 



218 1%4 Lifi and AdvmUwrtB 

at fint ieeiiig the light : thit leyiyed Aim hduiB, and gsfv tiwiii Ae 
notice tliat theze was a ship at hand for their halpi Upon 
these gnns^ they took down their masts and sails; and the 
coming from the windward, they resolved to lie by till momdog, 
time after hearing no more gona^ they fired three muskets^ one a i 
siderable while after another; bat these^ the wind beiqg oontnox, we 
nerer heard. Some time after that again, they were still moie agiee- 
ably surprised with seeing our lights^ and hearing the gons wliieh I 
caused to be fired daring the night : this set them to woilc iriOi their 
oars to keep their boats a-head, at least that we might the sooner oome 
up with them ; and at last^ to their inexpressible joy, thej fimiid we 
saw them. 

It Ib impossible for me to express the strange ecstasies, the Tazieij 
of postares, which these poor people threw themselyes into^ to ex- 
press the joy of their souls at so unexpected a deliTeranoe. Grief and 
fear are easily described ; sighs, tears, groans, and a yezy taw mations 
of the head and hands^ make up the sum of its variety ; but an ezoeaB • 
of joy, a surprise of joy, has a thousand extravagances in it : they were 
thrown into a kind of frenzy ; there were some in tear^ some raging 
and tearing themselves, as if they had been in the greatest agonies of 
sorrow ; some stark raving and downright lunatic ; some ran about the 
ship stamping with their feet, others wringing their hands ; some were 
dancing, some singing, some laughing, more crying ; many quite domb^ 
not able to speak a word ; others sick and vomiting, several swooning^ 
and ready to faint ; and a few were crossing themselves and giving God 
thanks. Perhaps the particular nation they belonged to had something 
to do with this. The French are allowed to be more volatile, more 
passionate, and more sprightly, and their spirits more fluid, than any 
other nations. I am not philosopher enough to determine the cause, 
but nothing I had ever seen before came up to it : the ecstasies poor 
Friday, my trusty savage, was in, when he found his father in the 
boat, came the nearest to it ; and the surprise of the master, and his 
two companions, whom I delivered from the villains that set them on 
shore in the island, came a little way towards it ; but nothing that 
I saw either in Friday, or any where else in my life could compare 
to this. 

There were two priests among them, one an old man, and the other 
a young one. As soon as the old man set his foot on board our ship, 
and saw himself safe, he dropped down stone-dead, to all appearance ; 
not the least sign of life could be perceived in him ; our surgeon im- 
mediately applied proper remedies to recover him : and was the only 



of Bobinson Crusoe. 219 

man in the ship that believed he was not dead. He opened a vein in 
his arm, having first chafed and rubbed the i)art, so as to warm it as 
much as possible : upon this the blood, which only dropped at first, 
flowed something freely ; in three minutes after, the man opened his 
eyes ; and about a quarter of an hour after that, he spoke, grew better, 
and was quite well ; after the blood was stopped, he walked about, told 
us he was perfectly well, took a dram of cordial which the surgeon gave 
him, and was what we call come to himself ; about a quarter of an hour 
after, they came running into the cabin to the surgeon, who was bleed- 
ing a Frenchwoman that had fainted ; and told him the priest had 
gone stark mad. It seems he had begun to revolve the change of his 
circumstances, and again this put him into an ecstasy of joy : his spirits 
whirled about faster than the vessels could convey them ; the blood 
grew hot and feverish ; and the man was as fit for Bedlam as any crea- 
ture that ever was in it ; the surgeon would not bleed him again in that 
condition, but gave him something to put him to sleep, which, after 
some time, operated upon him, and he waked the next morning perfectly 
composed and welL 

The younger priest behaved with more self-command, and was really 
an example of a serious well-governed mind ; at his first coming on 
board the ship, he threw himself flat on his face, prostrating himself in 
thankfulness for his deliverance ; in which I unhappily and unseason- 
ably disturbed him, really thinking he was in a swoon ; but he spake 
calmly; thanked me; told me he was giving God thanks for his 
deliverance ; begged me to leave him a few moments, and that, next 
to his Maker, he would give me thanks also. He continued in that 
posture about three minutes, or a little more, after I left him ; then 
came to me, as he had said he would, and, with a great deal of 
seriousness and affection, but with tears in his eyes, thanked me, that 
had, under God, given him, and so many miserable creatures, their 
lives. After this he applied himself to his country folks ; laboured to 
compose them ; persuaded, entreated, argued, reasoned with them, and 
did his utmost to keep them within the exercise of their reason. With 
some he had success, though others were, for a time, out of all govern- 
ment of themselves. 

We were something disordered by these extravagances among our 
new guests for the first day ; but when they retired, lodgings being 
provided for them as well as our ship would allow, and had slept 
heartily, as most of them did, they were quite another sort of people 
the next day.

My nephew was £ar accepting their money, bat b^gan to comider 
what to do with them afterwards. I knew what it was to he set on 
shore in a strange coantiy ; and if the Porfcogaese captain that took me 
np at sea had taken all I had for my deliverance, I most have starved, 
or have been as mach a slaye at the BrasilB^ as I had been in Barbazy ; 
perhaps a Portogoeee is not a much better master than a Turk, if not^ 
in some cases, a much worse. 

I therefore told the French captain, that it was our duty to relieve 
them, as we were fellow-creatures, and as we would desire to be so 
deliyered, if we were in the like extremity ; that we had done nothiiig 
for them, but what we believed they would have done for us if our cases 
had been reversed, but that we took them up to save them, not to 
plunder them ; or to set them on shore and leave them : that this would 
be first to save them from death, and then kill them ourselves ; save 
them from drowning, and then abandon them to starving ; and there- 
fore nothing should be taken from them. As to setting them on shore^ 
our ship was bound to the East Indies ; and though we were driven 
out of course to the westward a great way, directed perhaps by Heaveq 
for their deliverance, yet it was impossible for us wilfully to change onr 
voyage ; nor could my nephew, the captain, answer it to the freigbters, 
with whom he was under charter-party to pursue his voyage by the 
way of the Brasils ; all he could do for them was, to put ourselves in 
the way of meeting with ships homeward-bound j&x)m the West Indies, 
and get them passage, if possible, to England or France. 

The first part of the proposal was so generous and kind, they could 
not but be very thankful for it : but they were in great constematioD, 
especially the passengers, at the notion of being carried away to the 
East Indiea They entreated me, seeing that I was driven so far to the 
westward before I met with them, I would at least keep on the same

meet "witli some ship or sloop that they might hire to carry them back 
to Canada, from whence they came. 

I thought this was but a reasonable request on their part; and there- 
fore I inclined to agree to it; for indeed I considered, tiiat to carry this 
whole company to the East Indies, would not only be an intolerable 
severity upon the poor people, but would be ruining our whole voyage 
by devouring all our provisions ; so I thought it no breach of charter- 
party but what an unforeseen accident, in which no one could say we 
were to blame, made absolutely necessary to us ; for the laws of God 
and man would have forbid that we should refuse to take up two boats 
full of people in such a distressed condition; and the nature of the 
thing, as well respecting ourselves as the poor people, obliged us to set 
them on shore somewhere or other for their deliverance; so I consented 
that we would carry them to Newfoundland, if wind and weather would 
permit ; and if not, to Martioico in the West Indies. 

The wind continued fresh easterly, but the weather pretty good; and 
as the winds had continued in the points between N.E and S.E. a long 
time, we missed several opportunities of sending them to France; for we 
met several ships bound for Europe, whereof two were French from 
St. Christopher's ; but they had been so long beating up against the 
wind, that they durst not take in passengers for fear of wanting pro- 
visions for the voyage, as well for themselves as for those they should 
take in ; so we were obliged to go on. It was about a week after this, 
that we made the banks of Newfoundland, where, to shorten my story, 
we put all our French people on board a bark, which they hired at sea 
to put them on shore there, and afterwards to carry them to France : 
when, I say, all the French went on shore, I should remember, that the 
young priest I spoke of, hearing we were bound to the East Indies, 
desired to go the voyage with us, and to be set on shore on the coast 
of Coromandel, which I readily agreed to : for I wonderftdly liked the 
man, and had very good reason to do so, as will appear afterwards ; four 
of the seamen also entered themselves into our ship, and proved very 
useful fellows. 

From hence we directed our course for the "West Indies, steering away 
S. and S. by E. for about twenty days together, sometimes with little 
or no wind at all, when we met with another subject for our humanity 
to work upon, almost as deplorable as that before. 

It was in the latitude of twenty-seven degrees five minutes N. and the 
19th day of March, 1694, when we spied a sail, our course being S.K 
and by S. "We soon perceived it was a large vessel, and that she bore up 
to us j but could make nothing of her, till coming a little nearer, we found

before she was.ieady to sai], bj a terrible hurricane, while the captain 
and chief mate were both gone on shore; they had been some weeks at 
sea» and had already met with another storm; they were almost starved 
fof want of provisionsy besides the feddgaes they had ondergone ; fhair 
bread and flesh was quite gone, they had not an ounce left in the ahip^ 
and had had none £ar eleven days ; the only relief they had, was, that 
their water was not aU spent^ and they had abont half a baneL of floor 
left^ also sugar enough, and seven casks of rum. 

There was a youth and his mother, and a maid-servant^ on board, 
who were going passengers, and thinfriTig the ship was ready to sai], 
unhappily came on board the evening before the hurricane began; an^ 
having no provisions of their own left^ they were in a more deplorable 
condition than the rest; for the seamen being reduced to soch an 
extreme necessity themselves, had no compassion, we may be sore^ ion 
the poor passengers ; and they were indeed in a condition that their 
misery is very hard to describe. 

We immediately supplied them with what we could spare; and indeed 
I had so £eit over-ruled things with my nephew, that I would have 
victualled them, though we had gone away to the coast of Ammt^ to 
have supplied ourselves ; but there was no necessity for that 

But now they were in a new danger ; for they were a&aid of eating 
too much, even of that little we gave them : the second mate, now 
commander, brought six men with him in his boat ; but these poor 
wretches looked like skeletons, and were so weak, they could hardly sit 
to their oars : the mate himself was very ill, and half-starved ; for he 
declared he had reserved nothing from the men, and went share and 
share alike with them in every bit of food. I cautioned them to eat 
sparingly while I set meat before them, not forgetting the starving crew 
that were left on board, for I ordered my own boat to go on board the 
ship, with my mate and twelve men^ to carry them a sack of bread and 
four or five pieces of beef to boiL Our surgeon charged the men to cause 
the meat to be boiled while they stayed, and to keep guard in the cook- 
room to prevent the crew taking it to eat raw, or taking it out of the 
pot before it was well boiled, and then to give every man but a very 
little at a time ; by this caution he saved the men, who would other- 
wise have killed themselves with the very food that was given them to 
save their lives. 

At the same time I ordered the mate to go into the great cabin, 
and see what condition the passengers were in, and, if they were alive 



of Eobtnson Crusoe. 



22£t 



to comfort them and give them what refreshment was proper ; the 
surgeon giving him a large pitcher with some of the prepared broth 
which he had given to the mate, and which he did not question would 
restore them gradually. 

Not satisfied with this, but having a great mind to see the scene of 
misery which I knew the ship itself would present me with, in a more 
lively manner than I could have it by report, I took the captain of the 
ship, as we now called him, with me, and went myself a little after in 
their boat 

I found the poor men on board almost in a tumult to get the victuals 
out of the boiler before it was ready : but my mate observed his 
orders, and kept a good guard at the cook-room door ; and the men he 
placed there, after using all possible persuasion to them to have 




patience, kept them off by force ; however, he caused some biscuit 
cakes to be dipped in the pot, and thus softened with the liquor of the 
meat, which they call brewis, gave one to each of them, to stay their 
stomachs, telling them it was for their own safety, that he was obliged 
to give them but a little at a time. But it was all in vain, and had I 
not come on board, with their own commander and ofl&cers, and with 
good words and some threats also of giving them no more, I believe 
they would have broke into the cook-room by force, and torn the meat 
out of the furnace; for words are indeed of very small force with 
a hungry belly : however, we pacified them, and fed them gradually 
and cautiously for the first time, and the next time gave them more, 
and at last filled their bellies, and the men did well enough. But the 



224 The Lifo and Adventums 

misery of the poor {msaengers in fhe cabin was of another natoxe^ and 
&r beyond the rest 

The poor mother^ who was a woman of sense and good breedings had 
spared all she could get so affectionately for her son, that at last ahe 
entirely sunk nnder it : and when the mate of our diip went in, ahe 
sat upon the floor or deck^ with her back up against the sides^ betv^en 
two chairsy which were lashed &sty and her head sunk in betwMn 
her shoulders, like a corpse, though not quite dead. The mate aaid all 
he could to reyive and encourage her, and with a spoon pat somebioth 
into her month : she opened her lips, and lifted up one hand, bat 
could not speak ; yet she understood what he said, and made ngna to 
him, intimating that it was too late for her, but pointed to her child, 
as if she would have said they should take care of him. 

However, the mate, who was much moved with the sight^ en-« 
deavoured to get some of the broth into her mouth ; and, as he said, 
got two or three spoonfuls down, though I question whether he coald 
be sure of it or not ; but it was too late, she died the same night. 

The youth who was preserved at the price of this most afleciionate 
mother's life, was not so far gone ; yet he lay in a cabin-bed itretdbed 
out, with hardly any life left in him ; he had a piece of an old g^ove 
in his mouth, having eaten up the rest of it However, being yoong^ 
and having more strength than his mother^ the mate got aometihing 
down his throat, and he began sensibly, to revive, but by ^ving him 
some time after two or three spoonfuls extraordinary, he was very 
sick, and brought it up again. 

Ihe next care was the poor maid : she lay all along the deck hard 
by her mistress, and just like one that had fallen down with an 
apoplexy, and struggled for life ; her limbs were distorted, one of 
her hands was clasped round the frame of a chair, and she griped it so 
hard that we could not easily make her let go ; her other arm lay over 
her head, and her feet lay both together, set fast against the frame of 
the cabin-table ; in short, she lay just like one in the last agonies of 
death, and yet she was alive too. The poor creature was not only 
starved with hunger, and terrified with the thoughts of death, but was 
broken-hearted for her mistress, whom she loved most tenderly, and 
whom she saw dying two or three days before. With great applica- 
tion our surgeon recovered her as to life, but he had her upon his 
hands as to her senses, for she was little less than distracted for a con- 
siderable time after. 

Our business, however, was to relieve the distressed ship's crew, but 
not to lie by for them ; and though they were willing to steer the same 



of Bobinsan Crusoe. 225 

course with ns for some days, yet we could cany no sail to keep pace 
with a ship that had no masts : however, as their captain begged of us 
to help him to set up a main top-mast, and a kind of a top-mast to his 
jury fore-mast, we did, as it were, lie by hiTn for three or four days ; 
and then, having given him five barrels of bee^ a barrel of pork, two 
hogsheads of biscuit, and a proportion of peas, flour, and what other 
things we could spare ; and taking three casks of sugar, some rum, 
and some pieces of eight of them for satisfaction, we left them, 
taking on board with us, at their own earnest request, the youth, and 
the maid, and all their goods. 

I was now in the latitude of 19 deg. 32 min. and had hitherto had 
a tolerable voyage as to weather, though at first the winds had been 
contrary. For brevity's sake I shall now only observe, that I came to 
my old habitation, the island, on the 10th of April, 1694. It was 
with no small difficulty that I found the place, for as I came to it 
before, on the south and east side of the island, coming from the 
Brasils, so now coming in between the main and the island, and 
having no chart for the coast, nor any landmark, I did not know 
it when I saw it. We beat about a great while, therefore, and went 
on shore on several islands in the mouth of the great river Oroonoque, 
but none for my purpose ; only this I learned by my coasting the 
shore, that I was under a great mistake before, in supposing that the 
land I saw from the island I lived in was a continent, it was in reality 
a long island, or rather a group of islands, stretching from one to 
the other side of the extended mouth of that great river; and 
that the savages who came to my island were not properly those 
which we call Caribbees, but islanders, and other barbarians of the 
same kind, who inhabited the islands on our side. In short, I visited 
several of these islands to no purpose ; some I found were inhabited, 
and some were not. On one of them I found some Spaniards, and 
thought at first they lived there ; but speaking with them I found they 
had a sloop in a small creek hard by, and that they came hither to 
make salt, and catch pearl-muscles, but they belonged to the Island of 
Trinidad, which lay further north, in latitude of 10 and 11 degrees. 

At last, however, coasting from one island to another, sometimes 
with the ship, sometimes wi^ the Frenchmen's shallop (which we had 
found a convenient boat, and therefore kept with their very good will), 
at length I came fair on thQ south side of my island, and I presently 
knew the very countenance of the place ; so I brought the ship safe to 
an anchor, broadside with the little creek where was my old habitation. 

As soon as I saw the place, I called for Friday and asked him if he 

Q 



226 The lAJk and Adventures 

knew where he was ? He looked about a little, and presently clapping 
his hands, cried, " yes, there, yes, there !" pointing to our 
old habitation, and fell a dancing and capering like a mad fellow, and 
I had much ado to keep him from jumping into the sea, to swim on 
shore to the place. 

" Well, Friday," says I, " do you think we shall find anybody here, 
or no % and what do you think, shall we see your father 1 " The fellow 
stood mute as a stock a good while ; but when I named his father, the 
poor affectionate creature looked dejected, and the tears ran down his 
face very plentifully. "What is the matter, Friday 1" said L "Are 
you troubled because you may see your father 1" " No, no," says he, 
shaking his head, " no see him more, no ever more see again." " Why 
so," said I, "Friday, how do you know thati" "0 no, no," says 
Friday, " he long die ; long ago, he much old man." " Well, well," 
says I, " Friday, you don't know ; but shall we^see anyone else then I** 
The fellow, it seems, had better eyes than I, and he points just to the 
hill above my old house; and though we lay half a league ofl^ he 
cries out, "We see ! we see ! yes, we see much man there, and there, 
and there." I looked, but I could see nobody, no, not with the glass ; 
which was, I suppose, because I could not hit the place ; for the fellow 
was right, as I found upon inquiry the next day, five or six men stood 
there to look at the ship, not knowing what to think of it. 

As soon as Friday had told me he saw people, I caused the English 
ancient to be spread, and fired three guns, to give them notice we were 
friends; about half a quarter of an hour after, we perceived smoke 
rising from the side of the creek ; so I immediately ordered a boat out, 
taking Friday with me ; and, hanging out a white flag, or flag of truce, 
I went directly on shore, taking with me the young priest I mentioned 
to whom I had told the whole story of my living there, and the man- 
ner of it, and every particular, both of myseK, and those I left there 
which had made him extremely desirous to go with me. We had 
besides about sixteen men very well armed, if we had found any new 
guest there which we did not know of; but we had no need of 
weapons. 

As we went on shore upon the tide of flood, near high water, we 
rowed directly into the creek ; and the first man I fixed my eye upon 
was the Spaniard, whose life I had saved, and whom I knew by his face 
perfectly welL I intended to go on shore first myseK; but there was 
no keeping Friday in the boat : for the affectionate creature had spied 
his father at a distance, a good way off from the Spaniards, where 
indeed I saw nothing of him ; and tf prevented from going on shore.

CRUSOE S SECOND LANDING ON THE ISLAND 



of Bdbinson Crusoe. 227 

he would have jumped into the sea. He was no sooner on shore, than 
he flew to his fether like an arrow out of a bow. It would have made 
any man shed tears^ in spite of the firmest resolution, to have seen 
the first transports of this poor fellow's joys, when he came to his 
father ; how he embraced him, kissed him, stroked his face, took him 
up in his arms, set him down upon a tree, and lay down by him ; then 
stood and looked at him as any one would look at a strange picture, 
for a quarter of an hour together; then lie down upon the ground, and 
stroke his legs and kiss them, and then get up again, and stare at him ; 
one would have thought the fellow bewitched ; but it would have made 
a dog laugh to see how the next day his passion run out another way. 
In the morning he walked along the shore, to-and-again, with his father, 
several hours, always leading him by the hand, as if he had been a 
lady; and every now-and-then he would fetch something or other for 
him &om the boat^ either a lump of sugar or a dram, a biscuit^ or some- 
thing or other that was good. In the afternoon his frolics ran another 
way; for then he would set the old man down upon the ground, and 
dance about him, and make a thousand antic postures and gestures ; 
and all the while he did this, he would be talking to him, and telling 
him one story after another of his travels, and of what had happened 
to him abroad, to divert him. In shorty if the same fihal affection 
were always found in Christians to their parents, one would be tempted 
to say, there would have been hardly any need of the fifth com- 
mandment 

It would be endless to take notice of all the ceremonies and civilities 
that the Spaniards received me with. The first, whom I knew very 
well, was he whose life I had saved: he came towards the boat, 
attended by another, carrying a flag of truce also ; he did not know 
me at first, had no notion even of its being me, till I spoke to him. 
Seignor, said I in Portuguese, do you not know me 1 He spoke not a 
word ; but giving his musket to the man that was with him, threw his 
arms abroad, and saying something in Spanish that I did not perfectly 
hear, came forward and embraced me, telling me, he was inexcusable 
not to know that face again that he had once seen, as of an angel from 
heaven sent to save his life : he said abundance of very handsome 
things, as a well-bred Spaniard always knows how; and tiien beckon- 
ing to the person that attended him, bade him go and call out his 
comrades. He then asked me if I would walk to my old habitation, 
where he would give me possession of my own house again, and where 
I should see there had been but mean improvements. So I walked along 
with him; but, alas ! I could no more find the place, than if I had 

q2 



228 The Life and Adventures 

never been there; for they had planted so many trees, and placed them 
in such a posture, so thick and close to one another, that in ten years' 
time they had grown so big, that the place was inaccessible, except 
by such windings, and blind ways, as those only who made them 
could find. 

I asked them, what put them upon all these fortifications ? He told 
me, I would say there was need enough of it, when I learnt how they 
had passed their time, especially affcer they found that I was gone. He 
could not but have satisfaction in my good fortune, when he heard that 
I had gone away in a good ship ; he had oftentimes a strong persuasion, 
that one time or other he should see me again; but nothing that ever 
befel him in his life, he said, was so surprising and afi^cting to him at 
first, as the disappointment he was under when he came back to the 
island, and found I was not there. 

As to the three barbarians (so he called them) that were left behind, 
and of whom he said he had a long story to tell me ; the Spaniards all 
thought themselves much better among the savages, only that their 
number was so small And, says he, had they been strong enough, we 
had been all long ago in purgatory; and with that he crossed himself 
on the breast. But, Sir, says he, I hope you will not be displeased, 
when I shall tell you how, forced by necessity, we were obliged, for 
our own preservation, to disarm them, and make them our subjects, 
who would not be content with being moderately our masters, but 
would be our murderers. I answered, I was heartily afraid of it when 
I left them there; and nothing troubled me at my parting from the 
island, but that they were not come back, that I might have put them 
in possession of everything first, and leave the other in a state of sub- 
jection, as they deserved : but if they had reduced them to it, I was 
very glad, and should be very far from finding any fault with it ; for I 
knew they were a parcel of refractory imgovernable savages, fit for any 
manner of mischief 

While I was speaking, came the man whom he had sent back, and 
with him eleven men more. In the dress they were in, it was impos- 
sible to guess what nation they were of ; but he made all clear both to 
them and to me. First, he turned to me, and pointing to them, he 
said, These, Sir, are some of the gentlemen who owe their lives to you ; 
and then turning to them, and pointing to me, he let them know who 
I was ; upon which they all came up one by one, not as if they had 
been sailors, and ordinary fellows, and I the like, but really as if they 
had been ambassadors or noblemen, and I a monarch, or a great con- 
queror : their behaviour was to the last degree obliging and courteous, 



of Bohinaon Crusoe. 229 

and yet mixed with a manly majestic gravity, which very well became 
them; and, in short, they had so much more manners than I, that I 
scarce knew how to receive their civilities, much less how to return 
them in kind. 

The history of their coming to, and conduct in the island, after my 
going away, is so very remarkable, and has so many incidents, which 
the former part of my relation will help the reader to understimd, that 
I cannot but commit them to the reading of those that come after me. 
I shall, however, no longer trouble them with a relation in the first 
person, which will put me to the expense of ten thousand said Fs, and 
said he's, and he told me's, and I told him's, and the like; but I shall 
collect the facts historically from memory, as they were related to me. 

In order to do this succinctly, and as intelligibly as I can, I must go 
back to the circumstances in which I left the island, and in which the 
persons were, of whom I am to speak. And first, it is necessary to 
repeat, that I had sent away Friday's father and the Spaniard, the two 
whose lives I had rescued irom the savages ; I say, I had sent them 
away in a large canoe to the main, as I then thought it, to fetch over 
the Spaniard's companions, whom he had left behind, in order to save 
them from the like calamity that he had been in, and in order to suc- 
cour them for the present, and that, if possible, we might together find 
some way for our deliverance afterward. 

When I sent them away, I had not the least room to hope for my 
own deliverance any more than I had twenty years before ; much less 
had I any foreknowledge of an English ship coming on shore there to 
fetch me off; and it could not but be a very great surprise to them, 
when they came back, not only to find that I was gone, but to find 
three strangers left on the spot, possessed of all that I had left behind 
me, which would otherwise have been their own. 

The first thing, which I enquired into, was that he would give me a 
particular account of his voyage back to his countrymen with the boat. 
He told me there was little variety in that part ; for nothing remark- 
able happened to them on the way, they having very calm weather, and 
a smooth sea : for his countrymen, it could not be doubted, he said, 
but that they were overjoyed to see him (it seems he was the principal 
man among them, the captain of the vessel they had been shipwrecked 
in having been dead some time): they were, he said, the more sur- 
prised to see him, because they knew that he was fallen into the hands 
of savages, who, they were satisfied, would devour bini as they did all 
the rest of their prisoners; that when he told them the story of his 
deliverance, and in, what manner he was famished for carrying them 



230 The Life and Adventures 

away, it was like a dream to them ; their astonishment, they said, was 
something like that of Joseph's brethren, when he told them who he was, 
and told them the story of his exaltation in Pharaoh's court : but when 
he showed them the arms, the powder, the ball, and the provisions 
that he brought them for their voyage, they were restored to them- 
selves, took a just share of the joy of their deliverance, and immediately 
prepared to come away with him. 

Their &rst business was to get canoes ; and in this they were obliged 
to trespass upon their fiiendly savages, so fsir as to borrow two huge 
canoes or periaguas, on pretence of going out a-fishing. In these they 
came away the next morning ; for they had no baggage, neither clothes, 
or provisions, or anything in the world, but what they had on them. 




and a few roots to eat, of which they used to make their bread. He 
was in all three weeks absent, and in that time I had the occasion 
offered for my escape, leaving three of the most impudent, hardened, un- 
governable villains behind me, that a man could desire to meet with. The 
only just thing the rogues did, when the Spaniards came on shore was, 
to give my letter to them with provisions and other such relief, as I 
had ordered them to do ; they gave them also the long paper of direc- 
tions, which I had left with them, containing the particular methods 
which I took for managing every part of my life there ; how I baked 
my bread, bred up tame goats, and planted my com; how I cured my 
grapes, made my pots, in a word, everything I did : all this being 
written down, they gave to the Spaniards, two of whom understand 



of 'Robinson Crusoe. 231 

English well enoiigli; nor did they refuse to accommodate the 
Spaniards with other things, for they agreed very well for some time ; 
they gave them an equal admission into the house or cave, and they 
began to live very sociably together ; the head Spaniard, who had seen 
my method, and Friday's father together, managed all their affairs : 
for, as for the Englishmen, they did nothing but ramble about the 
island, shooting parrots, and catching tortoises : the Spaniards provided 
their suppers for them, when they came home at night. 

The Spaniards would have been satisfied with this, but the others 
could not find in their heart to let them alone long ; like the dog in 
the manger, they would not eat themselves, neither would they let 
others eat. The differences, nevertheless, were at first but trivial, and 
such as are not worth relating ; but at last it broke out into open war, 
and it begun with all the rudeness and insolence that can be imagined, 
without reason, without provocation, contrary to nature, and indeed to 
common sense; and though the first relation of it came from the 
Spaniards, whom I may call the accusers, yet when I came to examine 
the fellows themselves, they could not deny a word of it 

But before I came to the particular of this part, I must supply a 
defect in my former relation ; bearing upon these events, just as we 
were wdghing anchor to set sail, a quarrel broke out on board our ship, 
which was likely to have produced a second mutiny; nor was it 
appeased till the captain, interfering, parted them by force, putting two 
of the most refractory fellows who had been active in the former 
disorders, in irons ; tlureatening to carry them to England in that state, 
and have them hanged there for mutiny and plotting to run away with 
the ship. This frighted some other men in the ship ; and they put it 
into the heads of the rest, that the captain only gave them good words 
for the present, intending when he reached an English port that they 
should be all put into gaol, and tried for their lives. The mate got 
intelligence of this, and acquainted us with it ; upon which it was 
desired, that I should go down and satisfy the men, that if they behaved 
well during the rest of the voyage, all they had done for the time past 
should be pardoned. So I went, and passing my honour to them to 
that effect, caused the two men who were in irons to be released and 
forgiven. 

But this mutiny had brought us to an anchor for that night, the 
wind also falling calm, and next morning we found that our two men 
who had been in irons, had stole each of them a musket^ and other 
weapons, with powder and shot, and had taken the ship's pinnace, which 
was not yet hauled up, and ran away with her to their companions in 



233 He life amd JdnmimFti 

rogneij on the shore. I onlefed the long hoet on Bhate, with twelve 
men and the mate, to seek them, bat they coold not be found, for they 
all fled into the woods when thej saw the boat coming on shore. He 
retained leaTing eremhing as he foond it, bnoging the pinnace away. 

These two additional men made their number fiye ; bat the other 
three villains were so mnch wickeder than these^ that after they had 
been two or three days together, they tamed the new-comers oat of 
doois to shift for themselTes. When the Spaniards came, they woold 
have peisaaded the three Fnglish brutes to take in their two coontiy- 
men again, that^ as they said, they might be all one fimiily ; bat they 
would not hear of it ; so the two poor feUows lived by themaelvee^ and 
finding that by industiy and application they could live yeiy comfortably, 
they pitched their tents on the north shore of the island, but a litOe 
more to the west, so to be out of danger from the savages^ who always 
landed on the east parts. 

Here they built themselTes two huts, one to lodge in, and the other 
to lay up their magazines and stores ; and the Spaniards having giyen 
them some com for seed, and especially some of the peas which I had 
left, they dug, planted, and enclosed after the pattern I had set for 
them, and began to Utb pretty welL Their first crop of com was on 
the groxmd, and though it was but a little bit of land which they had 
dug up at first, having had but little time, yet it was enough to relieve 
them, and find them in bread or other eatables ; and one of the fellows, 
being the cook's mate of the ship, was very ready at making soup, 
puddings, and such other preparations, as the rice and the milk, and 
such little flesh as they got, furnished him with the means. 

They were going on this little thriving way, when the three rogues, 
their countrymen, in mere wanton humour, and to insult them, came 
and bullied them, told them the island i^-as theirs ; that the governor, 
meaning me, had given them possession of it, and nobody else had any 
right to it ; and, damn them, they should build no houses upon their 
ground, unless they agree to pay them rent for it 

The two men thought them jesting at first ; asked them to come and 
sit down, and see what fine houses they had built, asking what rent 
they demanded : and one of them merrily added, since they were the 
groimd-landlords, he hoped if they built tenements upon the land, and 
made improvements, they would, according to the custom of all landlords, 
grant them a long lease ; and find them a scrivener to draw up the 
writings. One of the three, in a rage, told them they should see it 
was no jest ; and going to a little place at a distance, where the honest 
men had made a fire to dress their victuals, he takes a fire-brand and

claps it to the outside of their hut, and very fairly set it on fire ; and 
it would have been all burnt down in a few minutes, if one of the two 
had not run to the fellow, thrust him away, and trod the fire out with 
his feet, and that not without some difilculty too. 

The fellow turned upon him with a pole he had in his hand : and 
had not the man avoided the blow very nimbly, and run into the hut, 
he had ended his days at once. His comrade seeing the danger they 
were both in, ran in after him, and immediately they both came out 
with their muskets ; and the man that was first struck at with the pole, 
knocked the fellow down, that had begun the quarrel, with the stock 
of his musket, and that before the other two could come to help him ; 
and then seeing the rest come at them, they stood together, and 
presenting their pieces, bade them stand o£^ 

The others had fire-arms with them too : but one of the two, bolder 
than his comrade, told them if they offered to move hand or foot, they 
were dead men ; and boldly commanded them to lay down their arms. 
They did not indeed lay down their arms ; but, seeing him so resolute, 
it brought them to a parley, and they consented to take their wounded 
man with them, and begone. Indeed, it seems the fellow was wounded 
sufficiently with the blow ; but they were much in the wrong not to 
disarm them effectually, as they might have done, and have got imme- 
diately to the Spaniards. Henceforth the three villains studied nothing 
. but revenge, and every day gave them some indication that they did so. 
They trod down their com, shot their three young kids, aad a she-goat 
which the poor men had bred up tame for their store ; and, in a word, 
plagued them night and day, till the two men were driven to desperation, 
and they resolved to fight them all three the first fair opportunity. 
They resolved to go to the castle, as they called my old dwelling, where 
the three rogues and the Spaniards all lived together at that time, 
intending to have a fair battle, and that the Spaniards should stand by 
to see fair play. So they got up one morning before day, and came to 
the place, called out the Englishmen by their names, teUing a Spaniard 
that answered, that they wanted to speak with them. 

It had so happened that the day before two of the Spaniards, having 
been in the woods, had seen one of the two Englishmen, whom, for 
distinction, I call the honest men ; and he had made a sad complaint 
to the Spaniards, of the barbarous usage they met with from their three 
countrymen, how they had ruined their plantation, and destroyed their 
com, tiiat they had laboured so hard to bring forward, and killed the 
milch-goat, and their three kids, which was all they had provided for 
their sustenance ; and that if he and his Mends, meaning the Spaniards,

One of the Engtiahmen asked Teij bi-bklj, '* What had the j to do

•"Do ! they shoold be our flervants, and work for na" " But how can 
yon expect that of them % " says the Spaniard, " they are not bought 
with your money ; you hare no right to make them servants.'^ The 
ISnglifthniATi answered, the island was theirs, the goYemor had gLyeii It 
to them, and no man had anythlug to do thero but themselves ; and 
with that swore by his Maker, that they would go and bum all their 
new huts ; they should build none upon their land. 

''Why, Seignior," says the Spaniard, "by the same rule, we must he 
your servants too." " Ay/' eaya the bold dog, " and so you shall too, 
before we have done with you/' mixing two or three oaths iu the proper 
intervals of his speech. The Spaniard only smiled at this, and made 
him no answer. However, this Httle diseonrae had heiited them ; and i 
starting up, one says to the other, I think it was he they called Witt 
Atkins, '^ come, Jack, let us go and have another brush with them ; we 
will demolish their castle, I warrant me ; they shall plant no colony in 
our dominions." 

Upon this they went all trooping away, with every man a gon, a 
pistol, and a sword, and muttered some insolent things among them- 
selves, of what they could do with the Spaniards, too, when opportnnity 
offered ; but the Spaniards, it seems, did not so perfectly understand 
their language as to know all these particulars ; only that, in general, 
they were threatened for taking th^ part of the two Englishmen. 

Whither they went, or how they bestowed their time that evening, 
the Spaniards said they did not know ; but it seems they wandered 
about the country part of the night ; and then lying down in the 
place which I used to call my bower, they were weary, and overslept 
themselves. They seem to have resolved on waiting till midnight^ 
and then to take the two poor men when they were asleep ; intending, 



of Bobinson Crusoe. 236 

as they acknowledged afterwards, to set fire to their huts while they 
were in them, and either bum them in them, or murder them as they 
came out : and, as malice seldom sleeps very sound, it was very strange 
they should not have kept themselves awake. 

However, as the two men had also a design upon them, though a 
much fairer one than that of burning and murdering, it happened, 
and very luckily for them all, that they were up and gone abroad, 
before the bloody-minded rogues came to their huts. 

When they came there and found the men gone, Atkins, who it 
seems was the forwardest man, called out to his comrades, " Ha ! Jack, 

here's the nest ; but d n them, the birds are flown :" they mused 

awhile to think what should be the occasion of their being gone abroad 
so soon, and presently suggested that the Spaniards had given them 
notice of their intention ; with that they shook hands, and swore to 
one another that they would be revenged of the Spaniards. As soon 
as they had made this bloody bargain, they fell to work with the poor 
men's habitation ; they did not set indeed fire to anything, but they 
pulled down both their little houses, and pulled them so limb from 
limb that they left not a stick standing, or scarce any sign on "the 
ground where they stood ; they tore all their little collected household 
stuff in pieces, and threw eve^hing about in such a manner, that the 
poor men afterwards found some of their things a mile away from their 
habitation. Having pulled up all the young trees the poor men had 
planted, destroyed an enclosure they had made to secure their cattle 
and their com ; and, in a word, sacked and plundered everything as 
completely as a herd of Tartars would have done ; they returned to 
the old habitation. Had the parties met at this juncture, there 
certainly would have been bloodshed among them ; for they were all 
very stout resolute fellows, to give them their due. 

When the three came back, like furious creatures, flushed with the 
rage which the work they had been about put them into, they came up 
to the Spaniards, and told them what they had done, by way of scoff 
and bravado ; and one of them stepping up to one of the Spaniards, 
as if they had been a couple of boys at play, takes his hat from his 
head, and giving it a twirl about, fleering it in his face, says he to him, 
" And you. Seignior Jack Spaniard, shall have the same sauce, if you do 
not mend your manners." The Spaniard, who, though a quiet civH man, 
was as brave as a man could desire to be, and withal a strong weU- 
made man, looked steadily at him for a good while ; and then, having 
no weapon in his hand, stept gravely up to him, and with one blow of 
hifl fist, knocked him down, as an ox is felled with a pole-axe. At this

oat^ calling to him not to ahoot; they atept in, aeccoedlhe other two^ 
and took their arma from them.

and giving the Spaniarda better wordsi wonld have had their aima

woold do them no harm ; and if they woald live peaceably they would 
be very willing to assist and associate with them, aa befine ; bat that 
thef coold not think of giving them their arms again, while they 
appeared so resolved to do mischief to their own coontiymen. 

The rogues being refosed their arms, they went raving away, and 
raging like madmen, threatening what they would do, though they had 
no fire-aims : but the Spaniards, despising their threatening, told them 
they should take care how they offered any injury to their plantations 
or cattle ; for if they did, they would shoot them, as they would do 
wild beasts, wherever they found them; and if they feU into their 
hands alive, they should certainly hang them. This was far from 
cooling them ; but away they went, raging and swearing like furies. 
As soon as they were gone, came back the two men in equal rage and 
passion enough, though of another kind; for, having been at their 
plantation, and finding it all demolished and destroyed, they had 
provocation enough ; they could scarce have room to teU their tale, so 
eager the Spaniards were to tell them theirs ; and it was strange enoagh 
to find, that three men thus bully nineteen, and receive no punishment 
at all The Spaniards indeed despised them, and especially after 
having thus disarmed them, made light of all their threatenings ; bat 
the two Englishmen resolved to have their revenge against them, what 
pains soever it might cost to find them out 

But the Spaniards interposed here too, and told them, that as they 
had disarmed them, they could not consent that they should pursue 
them with fire-arms, and perhaps kill them: but, said the grave 



cf BMnaon Crusoe, 237 

Spaniard, who was their governor, we will endeavour to make them 
do you justice, if you will leave it to us, for, as there is no doubt but 
they will come to us again when their passion is over, being unable to 
subsist without our assistance, we promise you to make no peace with 
them without having a full satisfaction for you j and upon this condition 
we hope you will promise to use no violence to them, other than in 
seK-defence. The two Englishmen yielded to this proposal with great 
reluctance ; but the Spaniards protested, they did it only to prevent 
bloodshed, and to make all easy at last, for, said they, we are not so 
many of us ; here is room enough for us all, and it is great pity we 
should not be aU. good friends. At length they did consent^ awaiting 
the issue for some days with the Spaniards. In five days the three 
vagrants, tired with wandering, and almost starved with hunger, having 
chiefly lived on turtles' eggs all that while, came back to the grove ; 
and folding my Spaniard, who, as I have said, was the governor, and 
two more with him, walking by the side of the creek, they came up in 
a humble submissive manner, and begged to be received again into the 
family. The Spaniards treated them civilly, but told them they had 
acted so unnaturally by their countrymen, and so very grossly by t|iem 
(the Spaniards), that they could not come to any conclusion without 
consulting the two Englishmen, and the rest ; but, however, they would 
go to them, and discourse about it, and they should know the result in 
half an hour. It may be guessed that they w^re very hard put to it ; 
for it seems, as they were to wait this half-hour for an answer, they 
begged he would send them out some bread in the mean time ; which 
he did, sending them at the same time a large piece of goat's flesh, and 
a boiled parrot ; which they eat very heartily, for they were hungry 
enough. 

After half an hour's consultation they were called in, and a long 
debate ensued, their two countrymen charging them with the ruin of 
all their labour, and a design to murder them ; all which they owned 
before, and therefore could not deny now; upon the whole, the 
Spaniard acted the moderator between them ; and as they had urged 
the two Englishmen not to hurt the three, while they were naked and 
unarmed, so they now obliged the three to go and build their fellows 
two huts, one to be of the same, and the other of larger dimensions 
than they were before ; to fence their ground again, where they had 
pulled up the fences, plant trees in the room of those pulled up, dig 
up the land again for planting corn, where they had spoiled it ; and 
in a word to restore everything to the same state in which they 
found it, as near as they could; for entirely it could not be, the

live pleaeaiilly and agieeably together * only that these three fellows 
could neTer be persiiaded to irorkj I mmn, for themeelves, except

told thexa' plainly, that if they would be &iendly and live sociably

be eoiiteiit to ircnk for them, and let them walk about and be as idle 
as th^ pleased; haTiiig thus Ihred pretty we.U together far a month or 
two^ the, Spaniards gave them their arms again, and gave them Hhertj 
to go abroad with ihssn. as before. 

It was not above a week after they bad these arm^ and got abroad, 
before the nngratefdl oeatores began to be as insoknt and troublesome 
as before:' bat, an incident happening presently upon this^ which 
endangered the safety of them all, they were obliged to lay by aU 
psitate resentments, and look to the preserration of their lives. 

Illhappened one night, that the Spaniard whose life I had saved, who 
was now the captain, or leader, or governor of the test, found himself 
veiy nneasy in the nighty and could by no means get any sleep : he was 
perfectly well in body, as he told me the story, only he found his 
thoughts tamaltaons ; Jiis mind ran upon men £ghting and killing of 
one another, while he was broad awake, he could not by any means get 
to sleep ; in short, he lay awake a great while ; but growing more and 
more uneasy, he resolved to rise: as they lay upon goat-skins, laid thidc 
upon such couches and pads as they had made for themselves, not in 
hammocks and ship beds as I did, so they had little to do, when they 
were willing to rise, but to get up on their feet, and perhaps put on a 
dress, such as it was, and their shoes. Being up, he looked out ; bi^ 
could see little or nothing ; the darkness and the trees which I haA 
planted, were now grown tall, and intercepted his sight, so that he could 
only look up, and see that it was a clear star-light night ; and, hearii^ 
no noise, he returned and laid him down again ; but still he could not 
sleep, nor could he compose himself to anything like rest, his thoughts 
were to the last degree uneasy, and yet he knew not why. 

Having made some noise in rising and walking about, going out and 
coming in, another of them waked, and calling, asked who it was that 
was up ? The governor told him, how it had been with him. " Say 
you so," says the other Spaniard; "such things are not to be slighted; 
there is certainly some mischief working near us ;" and presently he

asked "Where are the Englishmen?" They are all in their huts, 
safe enough,'' says he. It seems the Spaniards had kept possession of 
the main apartment, making a place, where the three Englishmen, 
since their last mutiny, always quartered by themselves, and could not 
come at the rest "Well," says the Spaniard, "there is something in it, 
I am persuaded from my own experience; I am satisfied our embodied 
spirits converse with, and receive intelligence from spirits unembodied 
inhabiting the invisible world ; and that this friendly notice is given 
for our advantage, if we only know how to make use of it" " Come," 
says he, " let us go out and look abroad ; and if we find nothing to 
justify our trouble, I will tell you a story to the purpose, that shall 
convince you of the justice of my proposing it." 

In a word, they went out to go up to the top of the hill, where I used 
to go ; but being strong, and in good company, they used none of my 
precautions of going up by the ladder, and then pulling it up to ascend 
a second stage to the top, but were going round through the grove un- 
concerned and unwary, when they were surprised by seeing a light as 
of fire, a very little way o£F from them, and hearing the voices of men, 
not of one or two, but in great number. ♦ 

In all the discoveries I had made of savages landing on the island, it 
was my constant care to prevent them discovering that there were 
inhabitants on the island ; and when they came to know it, they felt it 
so effectually, that they who got away were scarce able to give any 
account of it, for we disappeared quickly, nor did ever any that had 
seen me escape to tell anyone else, except the three savages who jumped 
into the boat, in our last encounter. It presently appeared of those 
men, that so great a number as came now together, came ignorantly, 
and by accident, on their usual bloody errand; and it was their business, 
either to have concealed themselves, and avoid being seen at all, so 
as to lead the savages to suppose there were no inhabitants in the 
place, or to have fallen upon them so effectually, as that not a man 
of them should have escaped, which could only have been done by 
getting in between them and their boats ; but this presence of mind 
was wanting, the consequence was the ruin of their tranquillity for a 
great while. 

The governor, and the man with him, surprised at what they saw, 
ran back immediately, and raised their fellows, giving them an account 
of the imminent danger they were all in; they again as readily took the 
alarm, but could not be persuaded to stay close where they were, they 
must run out to see how things stood. 

While it was dark, indeed, this was all well enough, and they had> 



240 The Life and AdvmUureB 

oppodnmity enough, or some Ilotxxb, to view the savages hjthe U^t of 
thiee jBzes they had made at some distance from one another; whal; 
they were doing was a mystery, and whatto do themselyes they knew 
not ; for, first, the enemy were too nnmerons to be cot off ; and, seoooodlj, 
they did not keep together, bat were divided into several parties along 
theshoie. 

The Spaniards were in no small consternation at this sight; tHad 
finding that the fellows ran straggling all over the sbore^ tfaey made no 
doabt^ but that^ first or last^ some of them wonM chop in upon some 
place or other, where they would see the token of inhabitants; they 
were also in great perplexity for their flock of goats, for it would ha??B 
been little less than starving them, if they should be destrt^yed; so the 
first thing resolved upon was to dispatch three men before it was li^^ 
namely, two Spaniards and an Englishman, to drive all the goats away 
to the great valley where the cave was, anc^ if need were^ to drive them 
into the very cave itself 

Oould they have seen tbe savages in one body, and at a distance from 
their canoes, they would have attacked them if they had been a 
buiHred; but that could not now be ; they were some of ^m two miles 
apart After having mused a great while on the course they slioald 
take^ and beaten their brains in considering their present drenznstanoes^ 
they resolved at last, while it was still dark, to send out the old savage 
(EViday^s father) as a spy, to learn, if possible, something concerning 
them, what they camo for, and what they intended to do. The old man 
readily undertook the task, and, stripping himself naked, as the savages 
were, away he went : after he had been gone an hour or two, be brings 
word, that he had been among them undiscovered, that he found they 
were two parties, and of two several nations at war with one another, 
they had had a great battle in their own country, and both sides, having 
taken prisoners in the fight, they had by mere chance landed in the 
island to feast upon their prisoners, and make merry; but coming to the 
same place, had spoiled their mirth ; they were in great rage with one 
another; and being so near, be believed they would fight again as soon 
as day-light appeared; but he did not perceive that they bad any 
notion of any bod/s being on the island but themselves. He bad 
hardly made an end of his story, when it appeared by the unusual noise 
they made, that the two little armies were engaged in a bloody fight. 

Friday's father used every argument ho could to persuade our people 
to lie close^ and not be seen ; he told them, their safety required it^ 
that they had nothing to do but to lie still, and the savages would kill 
one another to their hands, and then the rest would go away ; and

241 



it would have happened so. But it was impossible to prevail, especially 
upon the Englishmen ; their curiosity overcame all such prudentials, 
they must run out and see the battle ; however, they used some caution 
too, they went farther into the woods, and placed themselves to advan- 
tage, where they might securely see the fight, and, as they thought, 
remain unseen; but the savages did see them, as we shaU find here- 
after. 

The battle was very fierce ; one of the Englishmen said he could 
perceive among them were men of great bravery, of invincible spirit, 
and of great policy in guiding the fight The battle, he said, held two 
hours, before they could guess which party would be beaten ; but then 
it appeared that the party which was nearest our habitation was the 
weakest, and after a time some of them began to fly ; this put our men 
again into a great consternation, lest any of those that fled should run 
for shelter into the grove before their dwelling, and thereby discover 
the place. They resolved that they would stand to their arms within 
the wall, and whoever came into the grove, they should sally out over 
the wall and kill them, so that none should return to give an account 
of it ; they ordered also, that it should be done with their swords, or 
by knocking them down with the stock of the musket, but not by 
shooting them, for fear of raising an alarm by the noise. 




As was expected, so it fell out ; three of the routed army fled for 
life, and crossing the creek, ran directly into the place, not in the least 
knowing whither they went, but running as into a thick wood for 



24S I%e Lifi and AdomOmm 

fchelter; the sooat they kept abroad gave notioe of this wiibn^ irifli 
the addition, that the ocmqiieron had not pamied tiiem, or aeen whidi 
-waytheywent XJponlliiBtheSpaniaidgovenuir^amtta of hnniaiiil;f» 
would not suffer them to kill the three fogithree ; bat »«»"H«g three 
men out by the top of the hill, ordered them to go roonct and oome in 
behind them, so as to surprise and take them prisonan^ vhioh ms 
done ; the residue of the conquered people fled to their canoes, and 
got off to sea ; the victors retired, making little or no, parsnip but 
drawing themselves into a body, gave two great screaming abonts Iqr 
way of triumph, and so the fight ended ; the same day, about three 
o'clock in the afteinoon, they also marched to their canoea. And thus 
the island was again free, and th^ saw no savages for aeveial yean 
after. 

When they were all gone, our people came out of their den ; and^ 
viewing the field of battle, they found about two-and-thirty dead bodies 
upon the spot; some were killed with great long arrows, some-of wbioh 
were f^und sticking in their bodies ; but most of them were killed 
with great wooden swords, sixteen or seventeen of which they fbumd in 
the field of battle, and as many bows, with a great many anowa These 
swords were great strange unwieldy things, and they must be vei^ 
strong men that used them : most of those tibat were killed with them^ 
had their heads smashed to pieces, or, as we call it in English, their bnuns 
knocked out, and several of their arms and legs broken ; so that it is 
evident they fight with inexpressible rage and Airy. We found not one 
wounded man that was not stone dead ; for either they stay by tbeir 
enemy till they have quite killed them, or they carry all the wounded 
away with them. 

This deliverance tamed our EngHshmen for a great while : the sigbt 
had filled them with horror, and the consequences appeared terrible to 
the last degree, even to them, if ever they should fell into the hands of 
those creatures, who would not only kiU them as enemies, but kill them 
for food, as we kill our cattle. They professed to me, that the thoughts 
of being eaten up like beef or mutton, though it was supposed it 
was not to be till the^ were dead, had something in it so horrible, that 
it nauseated their very stomachs, made them sick when they thought 
of it, and filled their minds with such unusual terror, that they were 
not themselves for some weeks after. 

This, as I said, tamed even the three English brutes T have been 
speaking of ; and, for a great while after, they were very tractable, and 
wejit about the common business of the society, they planted, sowed, 
reaped, and all began to be naturalized to the countiy ; but some time 



of Robinson Crusoe, 243 

dfter this they fell again into such measures which brought them into 
a great deal of trouble. 

They had taken three prisoners, as I have observed; and these three 
being lusty, stout young fellows, they made them servants, and taught 
them to work for them; and, as slaves, they did well enough; but 
they did not take their measures with them, as I did by my man 
Friday ; they did not ensure their gratitude upon the principle of having 
saved their lives, and then instruct them in the rational principles of 
life, civilizing and reducing them by kind usage and affectionate 
treatment ; but, as they gave them their food every day, so they gave 
them their work too, and kept them fully employed in drudgery ; 
therefore, they never had them to assist them and fight for them, as I 
had my man Friday, who was as true to me as the very flesh upon my 
bones. 

Being now all good friends, they began to consider whether, seeing 
the savages particularly haunted that side of the island, and that there 
were more remote and retired parts of it equally adapted to their way 
of living, they should not rather remove their habitation, and plant 
in some place of greater security for their cattle and com. Aftw long 
debate, it was concluded that they would not remove their habitation ; 
because some time or other th^ thought they might hear from their 
governor again, meaning me ; and if I should send any one to seek 
them, I should be sure to direct them to that side of the island, where, if 
they should find the place demolished, it would be concluded that the 
savages had killed us alL But as to their com and cattle, they agreed 
to remove a part of them into the valley where my cave was, where 
there was land enough, and to plant part of their com there too, so that 
if one part was destroyed, the other might be saved ; they never, 
however, trusted the three savages, their prisoners, with a knowledge 
of the plantation they had made in that valley, or of any cattle, much 
less of the cave there, which they kept as a safe retreat in case of 
necessity; they carried thither also the two barrels of powder which I had 
left them. They agreed also, as I had carefully covered it first with a 
wall or fortification, and then with a grove of trees ; so they also set 
to work to cover and conceal the place yet more effectually than before : 
to this purpose, as I had planted trees for some good distance before the 
entrance, they went on in the same manner, and filled up the rest of that 
whole space of ground, from the trees I had set, quite down to the side 
of the creek, where, as I said, I landed my floats, and even into the 
very ooze where the tide flowed, not so much as leaving any place to 
land, or any sign that there had been any landing thereabout liis they

Thejr had lived two yean after this in per&et lefcisemen;^ and liad 
no more viBite from the savages: thej had indeed an alarm givaneailj 
one moming ; for some of the Spaniards being out on the west end of 
the island, which, hj the waj, was that end where I never went ftr 
fear of being disoovcxed, they saw above twenty canoes of Indiana just 
-coming on shore. 

They made tiiie best of their way home, in bnrty enon^ gnrii^f 
Hie alarm to their comrades ; tiiiey kept dose all that day and tlie nez^ 
going out only at night to make observation ; but wherever the savages 
went^ they did not land that time on the island. Kow, however, they 
bad another bioil with the three Englishmen ; one of whom, a most 
tnrbnlent fellow, being in a rage with one of the three slaves, becaose 
the fellow had not done Rometbing which he bid Viim do, and seemiqg 
a little nntractable on his showing him, drew a hatchet out of a frog- 
belt, in which he wore it by his side, fell upon the poor savage, not to 
correct, but to kill him. One of the Spaniards, who was by, seeing him 
give the fellow a barbarous cut with the hatchet, which be aimed at his 
head, but struck into his shoulder, so that he thought be had cat the 
poor creature's arm off, ran to him, and entreating bim not to murder 
the poor man, stepped in between him and the savage, to prevent 
mischief 

The fellow, being enraged the more at this, struck at the Spaniard 
with his hatchet, and swore he would serve him as he intended to serve 
the savage ; which the Spaniard perceiving, avoided the blow, and with 
a shovel, which he had in his hand (fdr they all were working in the 
field about their com land), knocked the brute down : another of the 
Englishmen, running at the same time to help his comrade, knocked 



of Robinson Crusoe. 246 

the Spaniard doivn ; and then two more Spaniards coming to help their 
man, the third Englishman fell in upon them. They had none of them 
any fire-arms, or other weapons than hatchets and tools, except thi» 
third Englishman ; he had one of my old rusty cutlasses, with which 
he made at the two last Spaniards and wounded them both. This fray 
set the whole family in an uproar, and more help coming in, they took 
the three Englishmen prisoners. The next question was. What should 
be done with them ? They had been so often mutinous, and were so 
furious, so desperate, and so idle withal, that it was difficult to know 
what course to take with them, for they were mischievous to the highest 
degree, and valued not what hurt they did to any man; ; so that, in 
short, it was not safe to live with them. 

The governor told them in so many words, that if they had been his 
own countrymen, he would have hanged them ; for all laws, and all' 
governors, were appointed to preserve society, and those who were 
dangerous to the society ought to be expelled from it ; but as they were 
Englishmen, and it was to the generous kindness of an Englishman that 
they all owed their preservation and deliverance, he would use them 
with all possible lenity, and leave them to the judgment of the other 
two Englishmen, their fellow-countrymen. 

One of the two honest Englishmen stood up, and said, they desired 
it might not be left to them ; for, says he, I am sure we ought to 
sentence them to the gallows > and with that he gives an account how 
Will Atkins, one of the three, had proposed to have all the five- 
Englishmen join together and murder all the Spaniards when they 
were in their sleep. 

When the Spanish governor heard this, he calls to William Atkins. 
How, Seignior Atkins, says he, would you murder us alii What 
have you to say to that ? That hardened villain was so far from deny- 
ing it, that he said it was true, and declared with an oath that they 
would do it still before they had done with them. Well, but Seignior 
Atkins, said the Spaniard, what have we done to you that you will kill 
us ? And what would you get by killing us ] And what must we do 
to prevent you killing us ? Must we kill you 1 Why will you put us 
to the necessity of this, Seignior Atkins ? says the Spaniard very calmly, 
and smiling. 

Seignior Atkins was in such a rage at the Spaniard's making a jest 
of it, that, had he not been withheld, and without weapons, he would 
have attempted to kill the Spaniard in the middle of all the company. 

This hair-brained carriage obliged them to consider seriously what 
was to be done. The two Enghshmen, and the Spaniard who saved the 



^246 TheUfiimd AdvmOwm 

^om savage^ woe of opimon they ahould lumg cnie of fli6 tluee iat iti 
example to the rat ; ancl that particokiljr it should be he that had 
twice attempted to oonnidtmiuderintiLhiahftte^ and indeed them 
was some leason to believe be had done i^ fixr the poor aaivage was in 
^snch a miserable condition ftmn the wound be had lecehred^ thai it was 
thought he could not live. 

Bat the governor Spaniaid still said, 'No, it was an Engliahwian that 
iiad saved all their lives^ and he would never consent to pnt an Eng^idL* 
man to death ; nay; be said, if be bad 4been kiUed bimaelf bj an 
Englishman, and bad time left to speak, it should be a leqnest that 
they ahould pardon him. 

This was so poeitiyely insisted on by the governor Spaniard, that 
there was no gainsaying it; and as merciful counsels are most apt to pre- 
Tail| where tiiiey are so earnestly pressed, so tiiiey all came into it ; birt 
-then it was to be considered what shoidd be done to keep them fiom 
doing the mischief tiiiey designed ; for all agreed, goyemer and all, that 
means were to be used for preserving the sodeiy from danger. After 
-a long debate it was agreed, first, that tiiie three should be diaamied, 
and not permitted to hme either gun, or powder, or shol^ or swoxd, or 
other weapon, and that they should be turned out of the society, and 
left to live where they would, and how tiiiey could, by themselves } but 
that none of the rest, either Spaniards or English, should converse or 
have any thing to do with them ; that they should be forbid to come 
within a certain distance of the place where the rest dwelt ; and that 
if they offered to coinmit any disorder, so as to spoil, bum, kill, or 
destroy any of the com, plantings, buildings, fences, or cattle belongiog 
to the society, that they ahould be shot down wherever they could find 
them. 

The governor, a man of great humanity, musing over this sentence, 
turned to the two honest Englishmen, and said, Hold ; you must reflect^ 
that it will be long ere they can raise com and cattle of their own, and 
they must not starve ; we nuist therefore allow them provisions. So 
he caused to be added to it that they should have a proportion of com 
given them to last them eight months, and seed to sow, by which time 
they might be supposed to raise some of their own ; that they should 
have six milch-goats, four he-goats, and six kids, given them, as well 
for present subsistence as for a store ; and that they should have tools 
given them for their work in the field, such as, six hatchets, an axe, a 
saw, and the like ; but they should have none of these tools or pro- 
visions, unless they would swear solemnly that they would not u&e 
them to the hurt or ii\jury of the commimity. 



of Robinson Crusoe, 247 

Thus they dismissed them the society, and turned them out to shift 
fop themselves. They went away sullen and refractory, neither con- 
tented to go away or to stay ; but as there was no remedy, they went, 
pretending to go and choose a place where they should plant and live 
by themselves : provisions being given, them, but no weapons. 

About four or five days after, they came again for some victuals, and 
gave the governor an account where they had pitched their tents, and 
marked themselves out a habitation and plantation. It was a very con- 
venient place indeed, on the remotest part of the island, N.E. much 
about the place where I landed in my first voyage, when I was driven 
out to sea^ the Lord knows whither, in my attempt to sail round the 
island. 

Here they built themselves two handsome huts, close under the side 
of a hill, having some trees growing already to the three sides of it ; so 
that by planting (»thers, it would be very easily concealed from the 
sight, unless narrowly searched for. They desired some dried goat-skins 
for beds and covering, which were given them ; and upon giving their 
words that they would not disturb the rest, or injure any of their 
plantations, hatchets were given them, and what other tools could be 
spared : some peas, barley, and rice, for sowing, and, in a word, all they 
wanted except arms and ammunition. 

They lived in this separate condition about six months, and had got 
in their first harvest, though the quantity was but small, the quantity 
of land they had planted being but little ; for, indeed, having all their 
plantation to form, they had a great deal of work upon their hands ; 
and when they came to make boards, and pots, and such things, they 
were quite out of their element, and could make nothing of it. When 
the rainy season came on, for want of a cave in the earth, they could 
not keep their grain dry, and it was in great danger of spoiling, and 
this humbled them much ; so they came and begged the Spaniards to 
lelp them, which they very readily did, and in four days worked a 
great hole in the side of the hill for them, big enough to secure their 
corn and other things from the rain ; but it was but a poor place at 
best, compared to mine, and especially as mine was then, for the 
Spaniards had greatly enlarged it, and made several new apartments 
in it. 

About three quarters of a year after this separation, a new frolic 
took these rogues, which, together with their former villany, brought 
mischief enough upon them, and had very near been the ruin of the 
whole colony. The three associates began, it seems, to be weary of the 
laborious life they led, seeing no hope of bettering it ; and a whim

whence tbe saTages came^'aiid tiy if they could not mixB upon mme 
pfisoneiB ftmong the natiyee therSp and bdng them hom% ao as to make 
tiiem do tlie laborious port of tile work for them* 

The ptqie^ waa not so papq^terous^ if they had gone no further ; 
Imt they did nothings and pvoposed nothing, that had not either 
nlscMef in the decdgn, or misehief in the eyant ; so the three fellows 
eame doim to the Spaniaids on^ morning, and in ¥ery humhle terms 
desized to be admitted to speak -with them. The Spaniards very readily 
heaxd what they had to say, which was this : that they were tired of 
lining in the manner they did; that they were not handy enough to 
pzovide the necessaries they wanted ; and that having no help^ they 
found they should be stanred j but if the Spaniards would give them 
leayo to take one of the canoes which they c^me over in, and give them 
aims and ammunition pioportbned for their defeucei, they would go 
orer to the main to seek their fortune, and m deliirer them from the 
trouble of supplying th^n with any other provisions* 

The Spaniards were glad enough to be rid of them ; but yet very 
honestly represented to them the eertain de^tr notion they were running 
into ; told them they had suffered 8uoh hard/^hips upon that very spot^ 
that they could, without any spirit of prophecyj tell them that they 
would be starved or murdered, and bade them consider well of it 
They replied audaciously that they should h© starved if they stayed 
here, for they could not work and would not work, and they could 
but be starved abroad ; and if they were murdered, there was an end 
of them, they had no wives or children to cry after them ; and, in 
short, insisted importunately upon their demand, declaring that they 
would go, whether they would give them arms or no. The Spaniaids 
told them, with great kindness, that if they were resolved to go, they 
should not go like naked men, in no condition to defend themselvva ; 
and though they jcould ill spare their fire-arms, having not enoi^ 
for themselves, yet they would let them have two muskets, a pisM, 
and a cutlass, and each man a hatchet, which they thought suffident 
for them. 

In a word, they accepted the offer ; and having baked them bread 
enough to serve for a month, and given them as much goat's flesh as 
they could eat while it was sweet, and a great basket full of dried 
grapes, a pot full of fresh water, and a young kid alive to kill, they 
boldly set out in a canoe for a voyage over the sea, where it was 
at least forty miles broad. 

The boat was indeed a large one, and would have very well carried

fifteen or twenty men, and therefore was rather too "big for them to 
manage ; but as they had a fedr breeze and the flood-tide with them, 
they did well enough : they made a mast of a long pole, and a sail of 
four large goat-skins dried, which they had sewed or laced together, 
and away they went merrily enough : th^ Spaniards called after them 
Bon Vecgo, and no man ever thought of seeing them again. The 
Spaniards and the two honest Englishmen would often congratulate 
each other on the quiet and comfortable life they led now those 
turbulent fellows were gone ; as for their ever coming again, that was 
the remotest thing from their thoughts ; when, behold, after twenty- 
two days* absence, one of the Englishmen being abroad upon his 
planting-work, sees three strange men coming towards him at a distance, 
two of them with guns upon their shouldera 

Away ran the Englishman as if he was bewitched, coming frighted 
and amazed to the governor Spaniard, and tells him they were all 
undone, for there were strangers landed upon the island ; they could 
not tell who. The Spaniard, pausing awhile, says to him. How do you 
mean, you cannot tell who ? They are the savages to be sure. No, 
no, says the Englishman ; they are men in clothes with arms. Nay, 
then, says the Spaniard, why are you concerned ? K they are not 
savages, they must be friends ; for there is no Christian nation upon 
earth but will do us good rather than harm. 

While they were debating thus, came the three Englishmen, and 
standing without the wood which was new planted, hallooed to them ; 
they presently knew their voices, and so all their wonder ceased. But 
now the admiration was turned upon another question, viz. What 
could be the matter, and what had brought them back again. 

It was not long before the men were brought in; and inquiring 
where they had been, and what they had been doing, they gave them 
a full account of their voyage — ^in a few words, they reached the land in 
two days, or something less ; but finding the people alarmed at their 
coming, and preparing with bows and arrows to fight them, they durst 
not go on shore, but sailed on to the northward six or seven hours, till 
they came to a great opening, by which they perceived that the land 
they saw from our island was not the main, but an island. Entering 
that opening of the sea, they saw another island on the right hand to 
the north, and several more to the west ; being resolved to land some- 
where, they put over to one of the islands which lay west, and went 
boldly on shore ; and found the people very courteous and friendly to 
them, giving them roots, and some dried fish, and appearing very 
sociable ; the women, as well as the men, being very forward to supply

I%e Li/9 and Adventures 



fham with anylihixig they could get for them to eal^ bringiiig it to them 
a peat way upon their heads. 




They continued here four days, and inquired, as well as they oould 
of them by signs, what nations were this way, and that way ; and weze 
told of several fierce and terrible races that lived almost eveiy way ; 
who, as they made signs to them, used to eat men ; but as for them- 
selves, they said, they never eat men or women, except only such as 
they took in war, and then they owned that they made a great feast 
and eat their prisoners. 

The Englishmen inquired when they had a feast of that kind ; and 
they told them about two moons ago, pointing to the moon, and then 
to two fingers ; and that their great king had two hundred prisoners 
now, which he had taken in his war ; and they were feeding them to 
make them fat for the next feast. The Englishmen seemed mighty 
desirous to see those prisoners ; but the other mistaking them, thought 
they were desirous to have some of them to carry away for their own 
eating. So they beckoned to them, pointing to the setting sun, and 
then to the rising ; which was to signify, that the next morning, at 
sun-rising, they would bring some for them ; and accordingly, the next 
morning, they brought down five women and eleven men, and gave 
them to the Englishmen to carry with them on their voyage, just as we 
would bring so many cows and oxen down to a sea-port town to victual 
a ship. 

Brutish and barbarous as these fellows were at home, their stomachs

turned at this sight, and they did not know what to do : to refuse the 
prisoners would have been the highest affi-ont to the savage gentry that 
offered them j and what to do with them they knew not. However, 
after consultation, they resolved to accept of them ; and in return, they 
gave the savages that brought them one of their hatchets, an old key, 
a knife, and six or seven of their bullets, which, though they did not 
understand, they seemed extremely pleased with : and then, tying the 
poor creatures' hands behind them, they (the people) dragged the poor 
prisoners into the boat. 

The Englishmen were obliged to come away as soon as they received 
them, otherwise they would certainly have been expected to kill two or 
three of them the next morning, inviting the donors at the same time 
to dinner. Having taken their leave with all the ceremonies that could 
pass .between people, neither of whom understood a word said, they put 
off, and came back towards the first island, where they set eight of their 
prisoners at liberty. In their voyage they endeavoured to communicate 
with their prisoners, but they could not be made to understand anything; 
when unbound the poor creatures screamed out, especially the women, 
as if they had just felt the knife at their throats ; for they immediately 
concluded they were unbound on purpose to be killed. K they gave 
them anything to eat, it was the same thing, it was given for fear they 
should sink in flesh ; if they looked at one of them more particularly, it 
was to see whether he or she was fattest and fittest to kill ; nay, when 
they began to use them kindly, and treat them well, still they expected 
every day to make a dinner or a supper for their new masters. 

When the three wanderers had given this unaccountable history of 
their voyage, the Spaniard asked them where their new family was ? 
And being told that they had brought them on shore, and put them into 
one of their huts, and were come up to beg some victuals for them, the 
whole colony resolved to go down to the place and see them, taking 
Friday's father with them. 

When they came into the hut, there they sat all bound ; for when 
they had brought them on shore, they bound their hands that they 
might not make their escape ; there, I say, they sat, all of them stark- 
naked ; first, there were three men, lusty, comely fellows, well-shaped, 
straight and fair limbs, about thirty to thirty-five years of age, and five 
women, whereof two might be from thirty to forty, two more not above 
four or five and twenty, and the fifth, a tall, comely maiden, about six- 
teen or seventeen. The women were well-favoured agreeable persons, 
both in shape and features, only tawny ; and two of them, had they been 
•white, would have passed for very handsome women, having very 



252 The L^ <md AdpMiurei 

agreeable conntenancesi and a Terj modest behaTioor, especiall j 'wbesi 
tiie J came afterwarda to be dothed and diessed, ilioiigh the dxeea was 
a very indiffoient one. 

The flighty yon maybe snie, was something nnconth to onr Spaniard^ 
who were men of tiie most oalm, sedate tempera^ and pei&ct good 
homonr that ever I met with, and, in particular, of great modesty, 
as will presently appear. I say the sight was yeiy nnconth, to see 
three naked men, and five naked women, all together bonnd, and 
expecting every moment to be dragged out and have thdr brains 
knocked ont^ and then to be eaten up like a calf that is killed for a 
daini^. 

The first thing they did was to canse the old Indian, Friday's fiithei^ 
to go in and see if he knew any of them ; and then, if he understood 
their speech. As soon as the old man came in, he looked serioo^y at 
them, bat knew none of them ; neither could any of them understand 
a word he said, or a sign he could make, except one of the women. 
This was enough, however; he soon satisfied them that they had fiillen 
into Christian hands, who abhorred eating men or women, and 
assured them they would not be killed ; at this they -discovered such 
joy, and by such awkward and several ways, as is hard to describe, for 
it seems they were of several nations. The woman who interpreted 
was now bid to ask them if they were willing to be servants, and to 
work for the men who had brought them away. At which they all fall 
a dancing ; and presently one fell to taking up this, and another that^ 
anything that lay next, to cany on their shoulders, as an intimation 
that they were ^^lling to work. 

The governor, who feared that having the women among them would 
presently be attended with some inconveniency, and l^t it might 
occasion strife, and perhaps blood, asked the three men what they in- 
tended to do with these women, and whether they intended them for 
servants or wives. One of the Englishmen answered very boldly and 
readily, that they would use them as both. To which tiie governor 
said, I am not going to restrain you from it ; you are your own masters 
as to that, but to avoid disorders and quarrels among you, I desire that 
you will all engage that if any of you take any of these women as 
wife, that he shall take but one, and that, having taken one, none else 
should touch her ; for it is but reasonable that each should TnaiTitaiTi 
the woman he takes. All ''this appeared so just that every one agreed 
to it without any difficulty. 

Then the Englishmen asked the Spaniards if they designed to take 
any of them ? But every one of them answered, " No ; " some of them 



cf Bx>b{n8<m Crusoe. 253 

said they had wives in Spain, and the others did not like women that 
were not Christians, and all together declared that they would not 
touch one of them ; on the other hand, the five Englishmen took them 
every one a wife, and so they set up a new form of living, for the 
Spaniards and Friday's father lived as before in my old habitation, 
which they had enlarged exceedingly within. The three servants which 
they had taken in the late battle of the savages, lived with them ; and 
these carried on the main part of the colony, supplying all the rest 
with food, and assisting them in anything as they could, as necessity 
required. 

But the wonder of this story was, how five such refractory, ill- 
matched fellows should agree about these women, and that two of them 
should not pitch upon the same, especially seeing two or three of 
them were, without comparison, more agreeable than the others ; but 
they took a good way enough to prevent quarrelling among themselves, 
for they set the five women by themselves in one of their huts, while 
they went all into the other and drew lots among themselves who 
should choose first. 

When the poor women saw themselves set in a row thus, and 
fetched out one by one, the terrors of their condition returned upon 
them again, and they firmly believed that they were now going to be 
devoured ; accordingly, when the English sailor came in and fetched 
out one of them, the rest set up a most lamentable cry, and hung 
about her, and took their leave of her with such agonies and such 
affection, as would have grieved the hardest heart in the world ; nor 
was it possible for the Englishman to satisfy them that they were not 
to be immediately murdered, till they fetched the old man, Eridayls 
father, who instantly let them know, that the five men who had 
fetched them out one by one, had chosen them for their wives. 

When they had done, and the fright the women were in was a little 
over, the men went to work, and the Spaniards came and helped 
them ; and, in a few hours, they had built them every one a new hut 
or tent for their lodging apart, for those they had already were crowded 
with their tools, household stuff, and provisions. The three wicked 
ones had pitched farthest off, and the two honest ones nearer, but both 
on the north shore of the island, so that they continued separated as 
before ; and thus my island was peopled in three places, and, as I 
might say, three towns were planted. 

And here it is very well worth observing that, as it often happens 
in the world, the two honest fellows had the two worst wives, and the 
three reprobates, that were scarce worth hanging, had three clever,

they had grapes planted in order, and managed like a vineyanL They 
had also found out a retreat in tiie thickest part of the woodsy where 
thooc^ there was no natural cave, as I had found, yet they had made 
one with the incessant labour of their hands, where they secored their 
wives and children from the enemy, having, by sticking innamerable 
stakes and poles of quick growing wood, made the wood impassable^ 
except in one place, where they climbed up to get over the outside pait^ 
and then went in by ways of their own making. 

As to the other three, though they were more civilized and mucb less 
quarrelsome, having not the same opportunity, yet one of the certain 
companions of a profligate mind never left them, and that was their 
idleness. It is true they planted corn and made fences ; but Solomon's 
words were never better verified than in them — " I went by the vine- 
yard of the slothful, and it was overgrown with thorns ;" for when the 
Spaniards came to view their crop, they could not see it in some places 
for weeds ; the hedge had several gaps in it, where the wild goate had 
got in and oaten up the com ; perhaps here and there a dead busb was 
crammed in to stop them out for the present, but it was only shutting 
the stable door after the steed was stolen ; whilst the two verified Solo- 
mon's words in another place, " That the diligent hand makes ricb ; " 
for everything grow and thrived, and they had plenty within and 
without ; they had more tame cattle than the other, more utensils and 
necessaries within doors, and yet more pleasure and diversion toa 

It is true, the wives of Uie three were very handy and deanly 



of Robinson Crusoe, 265 

"Within doors ; and liaving learned the English ways of dressing and 
cooking from one of the Englishmen, who, as I said, was cook's mate 
on board the ship, they dressed their husbands* victuals very nicely 
indeed, whereas the other could not be brought to understand it ; but 
then the husband, who, as I say, had been cook's mate, did it himseK ; 
but the men themselves loitered about, fetched turtle's eggs, and caught 
fish and. birds : in a word, anything but labour, and they fared accord- 
ingly : the diligent lived well and comfortable, and the slothftd lived 
hard and beggarly ; and so I believe, generally speaking, it is all over 
the world. 

Early one morning there came on shore five or six canoes of Indians, 
or savages, call them which you please ; and there is no room to doubt 
they came upon the old errand of feeding upon their prisoners, but 
that part was now so familiar to the Spaniards, and to our men too, 
that they did not concern themselves much about it, their only business 
was to lie concealed, and if they were not seen by any of the savages, 
they would go off again quietly when their business was done, having 
as yet not the least notion of there being any inhabitants in the island 
But an accident spoiled all their measures, and made it known among 
the savages that there were inhabitants there, which in the end led to 
the desolation of the whole colony. After the canoes with the savages 
had gone off, the Spaniards peeped abroad again, and some of them 
had the curiosity to go to the place where they had been to see what 
they had been doing. Here, to their great surprise, they found three 
savages left behind, lying fast asleep upon the ground ; it was supposed 
that they had either been so gorged with their inhuman feast^ that, 
like beasts, they fell asleep, and would not stir when the others went, or 
they had wandered into the woods, and did not come back in time. 

The Spaniards were greatly surprised at this sight, and perfectly at 
a loss what to do : the Spaniard governor, as it happened, was with 
them, and his advice was asked ; but he professed he knew not what to 
do : as for slaves, they had enough already ; and as to killing them, 
they were none of them inclined to that. The Spaniard governor told 
me they could not think of shedding innocent blood ; for as to them 
the poor creatures had done them no wrong, invaded none of their 
property, and they thought they had no just quarrel against them 
to just^ them in taking away their lives. 

After some consultation, therefore, they resolved that they would lie 
stiU a while longer, till, if possible, these three men might be gone ; but 
then the governor Spaniard recollected that the three savages had no 
boat, and that if they were left to rove about the island, they would 



256 The Life and Adventures 

certamly discover that there were inhabitants in it, and so they should 
be undone again in that way. 

Upon this they went back again, and found the fellows fast asleep 
still ; so they resolved to waken them, and take them prisoners, and 
they did so : the poor fellows were strangely frighted when they were 
seized upon and bound, they were afraid, like the women, that they 
should be murdered and eaten. 

It was very fortunate that they did not carry them home to their 
castle, I mean to my palace under the hill ; but to the bower, where 
was the chief country work, such as the keeping the goats, planting 
the com, &c, and afterwards they carried them to the habitation of the 
two Englishmen. 

Here they were set to work, though it was not much they had for 
them to do ; and whether it was by neghgence in guarding them, or that 
they thought the fellows could not mend themselves, I know not» but 
one of them run away ; and, taking to the woods, they never saw hiTn 
more. They had good reason to believe, however, that he got home in 
some other boats or canoes of savages, who came on shore three or four 
weeks afterwards, on one of their revels, and went .off again in two days' 
time. This incident terrified them all exceedingly ; for they concluded, 
and that not without good cause, that if this fellow got home among 
his comrades, he would certainly give report that there were people in 
the island, and how weak and few they were ; for this savage, as I 
observed before, had never been told, and it was very happy he had not, 
how many they were in all or where they lived, nor had he ever seen 
or heard the report of their guns, he knew nothing of the cave in the 
valley, or of the new retreat which the two Englishmen had made. 

About two months after this, six canoes of savages, with about seven 
or eight, or ten men in a canoe, came rowing along the north side of 
the island, where they never used to come before, landing about an 
hour after sun-rise, at a convenient place, a mile or so from the habita- 
tion of the two Englishmen, where the man had been kept. As the 
Spaniard governor said, had they been all there, the damage would not 
have been so much, for not a man of them would have escaped ; but 
the case differed now very much, for two men to fifty was great odds. 
The two men had the happiness to discover them about a league off, so 
that it was above an hour before they landed ; and as they landed a 
mile from the huts, it w^as some time before they could come at them. 
Kow having great reason to believe that they were betrayed, the first 
thing they did was to bind the two slaves which were left, and cause 
two of the three men, brought with the •women, who, it seems, proved 




BUENTNG UVTii

of Rohmson Crusoe, 257 

very faithful to them, to lead them with their two wives, and whatever 
they could carry away with them, to their retirement in the woods, and 
there to bind the two fellows hand and foot till they heard farther. 

In the next place, seeing the savages all come on shore, and that they 
bent their course directly that way, they opened the fences where their 
milch-goats were kept, and drove them all out to straggle into the 
woods, whither they pleased, that the savages might think they were 
all bred wild. When the two poor frighted men had secured their 
wives and goods, they sent the other slave they had of the three, who 
came with the women, and who was at their place by accident, away to 
the Spaniards with all speed, to give the alarm, and desire speedy help ; 
and in the meantime they took their arms, and what ammunition they 
had, and retreated towards the place in the wood where their wives 
were sent, keeping at a distance ; yet so that they might see, if possible, 
which way the savages took. 

They had not gone so far, but that from a rising ground, they could 
see the little army of their enemies come on directly to their habitation, 
and in a moment more could see all their huts and household-stuff 
flaming up together, to their great grief and mortification ; for they 
sustained a loss, to them irretrievable, at least for some time. They 
kept their station, however, till they found the savages, like wild beasts, 
spread themselves all over the place, rummaging every way, and every 
place they could think of, in search for prey ; and, in particular, for the 
people, of whom it now plainly appeared they had had intelligence. 
Seeing this, the two Englishmen, not thinking themselves secure where 
they were, thought it proper to make another retreat about half a mile 
farther, believing, as it afterwards happened, that the farther they 
strolled, the fewer of the savages would be found together. 

The next halt was at the entrance of a very thick-grown part of the 
woods, where stood an old trunk of a tree, which was hollow, and 
vastly large ; in this tree they both took their stand, resolving to see 
what might offer. 

They had not stood there long, when two of the savages appeared 
running directly that way, as if they had already had notice where they 
stood, and were coming up to attack them. A little farther off they 
spied three more coming after them, and five more beyond them, all 
coming the same way ; besides this, they saw seven or eight more at a 
distance running another way ; in a word, they ran in every direction, 
like sportsmen beating for game. 

The poor men were now in great perplexity, whether they should 
stand, and keep their posture, or fly ; but after a very short debate with 

s 



258 



The Life and Adventures 



themselves, they considered, that if the savages ranged the country 
thus, before help came, they might, perhaps, find out their retreat in 
the woods, and then all would be lost ; so they resolved to wait for 
them there ; and if there were too many to deal with, then they would 
get to the top of the tree, from whence they doubted not their ability 
to defend themselves, fire excepted, as long as their ammunition lasted, 
even though all the savages who landed, which was near fifty, were to 
attack them. 

Having resolved upon this, they next considered whether they should 
fire at the first two, or wait for the three, and so take the middle party ; 
by which the two and the five that followed would be separated ; and 
they resolved to let the two first pass by, unless they should spy them 
in the tree, and come to attack them. The two first savages confirmed 
them in this resolution, by turning away towards another part of the 
wood ; but the three, and the five after them, came forward directly to 
the tree, as if they had known the Englishmen were there. Seeing 
them come so straight towards them, they resolved to take them in a 
line as they came, and ^^ one at a time, perhaps the first shot might 
hit them aU three ; to which purpose, the man who was to fire, put 
three or four small bullets into his piece, and having a fair loophole, as 




it were, from a broken hole in the tree, he took a sure aim, without 
being seen, waiting till they were within about thirty yards of the tree, 
80 that he could not miss. As the savages came on, they plainly saw 
that one of the three was the runaway savage that had escaped from 



of Rohinaon Crtisoe. 259 

them; they both knew him distiiictly, and resolved that he should not 
escape ; so the other stood ready with his piece, to fire a second, in 
case he did not drop at the first shot. But the first was too good a 
marksman to miss. As the savages kept near one another, in a line, he 
fired, and hit two of them directly : the foremost was killed outright^ 
being shot in the head ; the second, which was the runaway Indian^ 
was shot through the body, and fell, but was not quite dead ; and the 
third had a little scratch in the shoulder, perhaps by the same ball that 
went through the body of the second ; and being dreadfully frighted, 
though not much hurt, he sat down upon the ground, screaming and 
yelling in a hideous inanner. 

The five that were behind, more frighted by the noise than sensible 
of the danger, stood still at first ; for the woods made the sound a 
thousand times bigger than it really was ; the echoes rattling from one 
side to another, and the fowls rising from all parts, screaming and 
making every sort of noise, according to their kind. 

All being silent again, however, and not knowing what the matter 
was, they came on unconcerned till they came to the place where their 
companions lay, in a condition miserable enough ; and here the poor 
ignorant creatures, not sensible that they were within reach of the 
same mischief stood huddled over the wounded man, talking, and, as 
miay be supposed, inquiring of him how he came to be hurt : he told 
them that a flash of fire first, and immediately after that, thunder from 
their gods, had killed those two, and wounded him. Our two men, 
though, as they confessed to me, it grieved them, to kill so many poor 
creatures, who at the same time had no notion of their danger ; yet^ 
having them all thus in their power, and the first havmg loaded hid 
piece again, resolved to let fly both together among them; and^ singling 
out by agreement which to aim at, they shot together, and killed, or 
very much wounded, four of them ; the fifth, frighted even to death, 
though not hurt, fell with the rest ; so that our men, seeing them all 
fall together, thought they had killed them alL 

This belief made our two men come boldly out from the tree before 
they had charged their guns again, which was a wrong step ; and they 
were under some surprise, when they came to the place, and found no 
less than four of the men still alive, and of these, two very little hurt» 
and one not at all : this obliged them to fall upon them with the 
stocks of their muskets, and first th^y made sure of the runaway 
savage, that had been the cause of all the mischief; and of auothei 
that was hurt in the knee, they put them out of their pain ; then the 
man that was not hurt at all came and kneeled beforecthem, with his

at a great distance ; however tiliey had the aatiafection to aee them 
eroes orer a TaUey, towaida tilie aea, in a direction qmte oontniy to 
that which led to their retreat^ eati^ied with this, they went back to 
the tree where they had left their prisoner ; but he waa gone, and the 
two pieces of rope-yarn, with which they had bound him, hgr jnitat 
the foot of tiie tre& 

They were now as greasy concerned as before, not knowing what 
coarse to take, or how near the enemy might be, or in ^diat nomben ; 
ao they resolved to go towards the place were their wives were^ to aee 
if all was weU there, and relieve their anxiety; for though the savages 
were their own country folk, yet they were terribly afiradd of them, the 
more, perhaps, for the knowledge they had of them. 

When they reached it, they found the savages had been in the 
wood, and very near the place, but had not found it ; for it was indeed 
rendered all but inaccessible, the trees standing so thick before it^ that 
it could only be found by persons seeking it, *directed by those that 
knew it: they found everything very sfrfe, only the women in a 
terrible fright Here they had the comfort of seeing seven of the 
Spaniards come to their assistance ; the other 'ten, with their servants, 
and old Friday, I mean Frida/s father, were gone in a body to defend 
their bower, and the com and eatUe kept there, in ease the savages 
should have roved over to that side of the country; but they did not 
spread so fSeur. With the seven Spaniards, came one of the three 
savages, who, as I said were their prisoners formeiiy, and with them 
also came the savage the Englishmen had left bound hand and foot at 
the tree ; for it seems they came that way, saw the slaughter of the 
seven men, and unbound the eighth, and brought him along with them, 
where, however, they were obliged to bind him again, as they had the 
two others, who were left when the third ran away. 

The prisonem began now to be a burden to them ; and they were so 



cf RoMnscn Crusoe. 261 

ijfraid of their escaping, that they were resolving ta kill them all, 
believing thej were under an absolute necessity to do so, for their own 
preservation > but the Spaniard governor would not consent to it ; 
he ordered, for the present, that they should be sent to my old cave in 
the valley, and kept there, with two Spaniards to guard them. They 
were bomid there hand and foot for that night 

The two Englishmen were so encouraged by the presence (rf the 
Spaniards, that they were not inclined to stay any longer there ; but 
taking five of the Spaniards, with four muskets and a pistol among 
them, and two stout quarter-staves, away they went in quest of the 
savages ; first, they came to the tree where the men lay that had been 
killed > but it was easy to see, that some more of the savages had 
been there ; for they had- attempted to carry their dead men away, 
and had dragged two of-. them a good way, but had given it over; 
from thence they advanced to the first rising ground, whence they had 
seen their camp destroyed, and where they had the nkortification- still 
to see the smoke rising ; but neither cotdd they here see any of the 
savages : they then resolved, though with aU possible caution,, to go 
forward towards their ruined plantation; but before reaching it^ 
coming in sight of the sea-shore, they plainly saw the savages emr 
barking in their canoes. They were sorry at first to find there was no 
way to come at them, to give them a parting blow; but upon the 
whole, they we're very well satisfied to be rid of thenu 

The poor Englishmen being thus a second time ruined, and all 
their property destroyed, the others agreed to help them to rebuild, 
and to assist them with needful supplies. Their three countrymen, 
not noted for any inclination to do good, nevertheless, when- they 
heard of their misfortune (for they, living remote eastward^ knew 
nothing of the matter till all was over, offered their help and assis- 
tance, and did very friendly work for several days, to restore their 
habitation, and prepare necessaries for them ; and thus,, in a little 
time, they were set upon their legs again* 

Two days after this, they had the farther satisfaction of seeing three 
of the savages' canoes come driving on shore^ and at some distance 
fix)m them, two drowned men ; by which they had reason to believe, 
that they had met with a storm at sea, which had overset some of 
them ; for it had blown very hard the very night after they went off. 

It was five or six months after this, before they heard any more of 
tlie savages, in this time our men were in hopes they had either forgot 
their former disasters or given up all hopes of better success, when, on 
a sudden, the island was invaded by a formidable fleet, of no less than 



S6S The Lifo and Adventurea 

d^t and twenty canoes fbll of saTageB, mned wiik bows and «now% 
great dabi^ wooden BwordB, and such like enginea of war ; they were 
in anoh niunbeta that it thiew all our people into the utmoet oon- 
atemation. 

Aa th^ landed in the eyening; and at the eaatenunoet aide of the 
idandy our men had that night to oonanlt and consider what to do ; in 
the first place, loiowing that their being entirely concealed was their 
only salbty formerly^ so it would be much more so now, when tiieir 
enemies were so nmnerons. They resolyed, therefore, first of all to poll 
down the huts which were boilt for the two EngJishmen, and drive 
«w»y their goats to the old care ; supposing that the savages would go 
directly thither, as soon as it was day, to play the old game overagaii^ 
though they did not now land within two leagues of it 

In the next place^ they drove sway all the floek of goats they had 
at the old bower, as I <»Jled it^ which belonged to the Spaniazdn^ in 
ahorl^ they left as little appearance of inhabitants anywhere as was 
j^ossible ; and the next morning early they posted themselvefl^'with all 
ttieirforce^ at the plantation of the two men, to wait for their coming. Am 
they guessed, so it happened ; these new invaders^ leaving their canoes 
at the east end of the island, came ranging along the shores directly 
towards the place, to the number of two hundred and fifty, as near as 
our men could judgei Our force was small indeed^ but what was 
worse, they had not arms for all their number. The whole account^ it 
seems, stood thus. First as to men. « 

Seventeen Spaniards, five Englishmen, one Old Friday, or Friday's 
father ; three the three slaves, taken with the women, who proved very 
fidthful ; three other slaves who lived with the Spaniards. 

To arm these they had eleven muskets, five pistols, three fowling- 
pieces, five muskets, or fowling-pieces, which were taken by me from 
the mutinous seamen whom I reduced ; two swords, three old halberfcs. 

To the slaves they did not give either musket or fusil, but they had 
every one a halbert, or a long staf^ like a quarter-stafi^ with a great 
spike of iron fastened into each end of it, and by his side a hatchet : 
also every one of our men had hatchets. Two of the women could not 
be prevailed upon, but they would come into the fight ; and they had 
bows and arrows, which the Spaniards had taken from the savages, when 
the first action happened, which I have spoken of, where the Indians 
fought with one another ; the women had hatchets too. 

The Spaniard governor, who I have described so often, commanded 
the whole ; and Wm. Atkins, who, though a dreadlul fellow for wicked- 
ness, was a bold daring fellow, commanded imder him. The savages 



qf Bohtnson Crusoe, 2G3 

came forward like lions, and our men, which was the worst of their 
fate, had no advantage in their situation ; only that "Will Atkins, who 
now proved a most useful fellow, with six men, was planted just hehind 
a small thicket of bushes, as an advanced guard, with orders to let the 
first band of them pass by, and then fire into the middle of them ; re- 
treating as nimbly as he could, as soon as he had fired, round a part of 
the wood and so coming in behind the Spaniards, who stood with a 
thicket of trees also before them. 

When the savages came on, they ran straggling about in every 
direction without order ; Atkins let about fifty of them pass ; then, seeing 
the rest coming in a very thick throng, he orders three of his men to 
fire, having loaded their muskets with six or seven bullets a-piece, 
each about as big as large pistol bullets. How many they killed or 
wounded they never knew ; but the consternation and surprise among 
the savages was inexpressible ; they were frighted to the last degree, 
to hear such a dreadful noise, and see their men killed, and others 
wounded, but seeing nobody that did it ; while in the middle of their 
fright, Atkins, and his other three, let fly again among the thickest 
of them ; and in less than a minute, the other three being again loaded, 
gave them a third volley. Had Atkins and his men retired immediately, 
as soon as they had fired, as they were ordered to do ; or had the rest of 
the body been at hand to have poured in their shot continually, the 
savages had now been effectually routed ; for their terror principally 
arose from the superstitious dread that they were killed by the gods 
with thunder and lightning, not seeing by whom they were hurt ; but 
Atkins, staying to load again, revealed the cheat ; some of the savages, 
who were at a distance, spying them, came upon them behind ; and 
though Atkins and his men fired at them also, two or fehree times, and 
killed above twenty, retiring as fast as they could, yet they wounded 
Atkins himself and killed one of his fellow Englishmen with their 
arrows, as they did afterwards one Spaniard, and one of the Indian 
slaves who came with the women. This slave was a most gallant 
fellow, and fought most desperately, killing five of them with his 
own hand, he having no weapon but one of the armed staves, and a 
hatchet. 

Our men being thus hard laid at, Atkins wounded, and two other men 
killed, they retreated to a rising ground in the wood ; and the Spaniards, 
after firing three volleys upon them, retreated also ; for their number 
was so great, that though above fifty of them were killed, and more 
wounded, yet they came on in the teeth of our men, fearleijs of danger, 
and snot their arrows like a cloud ; and it was obswi-ved, that their 



264 Tke Lifi and Adveniwrea 

woanded men, when not quite disabled, were made cmtEageoias by fhieir 
woiind% and fought like madmen. 

When oar men retreated^ they left the Spaniaidandthe Engliahmani 
that were killed, behind them; and the aaTageSy when Ihey came up to 
them, Tented their rage on their bodies in a wretched manner, breakiBg 
their arms, lega^ and head% with their dnbe and wooden swords^ like 
true savages. Bat finding oar men were gone^ they did not seem 
inclined to porsae them ; but drew themselves up in a kind of a ring^ 
which is, it seems^ their cnstom, and shouted twice^ in token of their 
victory ; after which, they had the mortification of seeing several of 
their woanded men fall, dying with the mere loss of Uood. 

The Spaniard governor having drawn his little body up together, 
upon a rising ground, Atkins, though he was wounded, would have had 
him march, and chaxge them again all together at once; but the 
prudent Spaniard replied, Seignior Atkins, you see howtheiT wounded 
men fight ; let them alone till morning; all these vrounded men will 
be stiff and sore with their wounds, and Mat with the loss of blood; 
and so we shall have the fewer to engaga The advice was good; but 
WiU Atkins repHed menily, That is true, Seignior, and so shall I be too; 
and that is the reason I would gaouywhik I am warm. WeU, Setgnkr 
Atkincf, says the Spaniard, you have behaved gallantly, and done your 
part ; we will fight for you, if you cannot come on ; but I think it best 
to stay till morning ; so they waited. 

But as it was a clear moonlight night, and they found the savages 
in great disorder about their dead and wounded, and great apparent 
confusion and noise among them where they lay, it was resolved to &11 
upon them in the night, especially if they could give them but one 
volley before they were discovered, which they had a fair opportunity of 
doin^ for one of the two Englishmen, in whose quarter the fight 
began, led them roimd between the woods and the seaside, westward, 
and then turning short south, they came so near where the thickest of 
them lay, that before they were seen or heard, eight muskets were fired 
in among them, and did dreadfal execution ; in half a minute more 
eight others followed, pouring in their small shot ui such a quantity, 
that abundance were killed and wounded ; and all this while they were 
not able to see who hurt them, or which way to fly. 

The Spaniards charged again, with the utmost expedition, and then 
divided themselves into three bodies, resolved to fall in among them 
all together ; they in each body eight persons, that is to say, twenty- 
four, whereof were twenty-two men and two women, who, by the way, 
fought desperately.

TLey divided the fire-aims equally in each party, and no of the 
halberts and staves. They would have had the women keep hack ; but 
they said they were resolved to die with their husbanda Having 
thus formed their little army, they marched out &om among the trees, 
and came up to the very teeth of the enemy, shouting and hallooing as 
loud as they could ; the savages stood all together, but in the utmost 
confusion^ hearii^ the noise of our men shouting from three quarters 
together ; they would have fought if they had seen us ; and, as soon 
as we came near enough to be seen, some arrows were shot> and poor 
old Friday was wounded^ though not dangerously. But our men gave 
them no time ; runnii^ up to them they fired among them three ways, 
and then fsll in with the butt-ends of their muskets, their swords, 
armed staves^ and hatchets,^ and laid about them so well, that, in a 
word^ the savages set up a dismal screaming and howling, and fied in 
all directions to save their live& 

Our men were tired with the executi(Hi ;. tbey killed or mortally 
wounded^ in the two fights, about 180 of them > the rest being frighted 
out of their wits, scoured through the woods, and over the hills, with 
all the speed fear and nimble feet could give them ; and, as we did not 
trouble ours^ves much to- pursue them, they got all together to the 
seaside, where they had landed, and where their canoes still ky. But 
their disaster was not at an end yet ; for it blew a terrible storm of 
wind that evening from the seaward, so that it was impossible for them 
to go off > nay, the storm continuing all night, when the tide came up, 
their canoes were moat of them driven by the surge of the sea so high 
upon the vshore that it required infinite toil to get them off again > and 
some of them were even dashed to pieces against the beach, or against 
one another. 

Our men, though cheered by victory, yet got Kttle rest that night ; 
but having refreshed themselves as well as they could, they resolved to 
march to that part of the island where the savages had fied. This 
necessarily led them over the place where the fight took place^ where 
they found several of the poor creatures not quite dead,, and yet past 
recovery ; a sight disagreeable enough to generous minds. The savages, 
who were their servants, despatched those poor creatures with their 
hatchets. At length they came in view of the miserable remains of 
the army of savages. ITiere appeared to be about 100 still; their 
posture was generally sitting upon the ground, with their knees up 
towards their mouth, and the head put between the two hands, 
leaning down upon the knees. When our men came within two 
musket shot of them, the Spaniard governor ordered two muskets to

heard the fiiat gon, and aaw the flaah of the aecond, tb^ ataxted up 
to their feet in the greateat oonstemation imaginable ; and aa our men 
adyanced awiftty towaida them, they all ran away acreaming and 
yawling, with a Idnd of a bowling noiae which our men did not 
nnderatand, neyer having heard it before ; and thna they ran np the 
billa into the ooontry. At firsts oar men had mnch rather tlmt the 
weather had been odm, and that they all bad got away to aea ;. bat 
they did not then oonaidex^ that this would probably have been flie

and atarre them out Will Atkina therefore, who, notwithstanding hia 
wound, kept alwaya with tham, proved the beet coonsellor in thia 
caae ; hia advice waa^ to take the advantage that offered, and clap in . 
between them and their boats, and so deprive them of the capacity of 
ever retaming any more to plagae the island. 

They oonsalted long about this, some were against it, for foar of 
making the wretches fly into the woods, and become desperate ; when 
they would have to hunt them down like wild beasts, having their 
plantations continually rifled, and their tame goats destroyed. 

Will Atkins told them, they had better have to do with 100 
men, than with 100 nations ; that as they must destroy their boats, 
so they must destroy the men, or be destroyed themselves. In a 
word, he showed them the necessity of it so plainly, that they all 
came into his plan ; they went to work immediately with the boats, 
and, getting some dry wood together from a dead tree, they tried to 
set some of them on fire ; but they were so wet, that they would not 
bum. However, the fire so burned the upper part, ijiat it soon 
made them unfit for swimming in the sea as boats. When the Indians 
saw what they were about, some of them came running out of the 
woods, and coming as near as they could to our men, kneeled down 
and cried, Oa^ Oa, Waramakoa, and some other words of their lan- 
guage, which none of the others understood; but as they made 
pitiM gestures, and strange noises, it was easy to see they begged to 
have their boats spared, and that they would be gone, and never come 
there again. 

But our men were now satisfied that they had no way to preserve 
themselves, or to save their colony, but effectually to prevent any of 



of Robinson Crusoe.

these people from ever going home again ; depending upon this, that 
if ever one of them got back to tell the story, the colony was undone ; 
80 that letting them know that they should not have any mercy, they 
fell to work with their canoes, and destroyed every one that the storm 
had not destroyed before ; at this sight, the savages raised a hideous 
cry in the woods; after which they ran about the island like distracted 
men ; so that, in a word, our men did not know what to do with 
them. 

While they thus made those people desperate, the Spaniards did 
not, as they ought to have done, keep good guard upon their planta- 
tions ; for though they had driven away the cattle, and the Indians 
did hot find out their main retreat, namely, my old castle at the hill, 
nor the cave in the valley; yet they found out the bower, and pulled 
it all to pieces, breaking all the fences and planting about it ; trod all 
the com under foot ; tore up the vines and grapes, then almost ripe ; 
and did an inestimable damage, though, to themselves, not one 
ferthing worth of service. Though our men were able to fight them 
upon all occasions, yet they were in no condition to pursue them; 
they were too nimble of foot for our men when they found them 
singly, and our men durst not go about singly, for fear of being sur- 
rounded by numbers ; fortunately, they had no weapons ; for though 
they had bows, they had no arrows left, nor any materials to make 
them. 




The distress they were reduced to was indeed deplorable ; but our 
men were also very much harassed; for though their retreats were 
preserved, yet their provision was destroyed, and their harvest spoiled;

md what to do they knew not ; the only mfiig© they had wm, the steck 
of cattle in the valley hy the care, and Bonie little com which grew 
{herej and the plantation of the three Englislunen^ now reduced to two, 
one of them heing killed by an arrow, which struck him on the side of 
||]8 head, just under the templea^ bo that he never spoke mom 

The Erst thing concluded upon was to drive them up to the farther 
past of the island, so that if oay mom savages came on shore, they might 
not find one another ; then, that they would daily hunt and harass 
iSiam, and kill as many of them aa they could come at, till they had 
wduced their number ; and if they eoiild at hiet tame them, they would 
give them com, and teach them how to plant, and live upon theix daOy 
Iftbour. In order to this, they followed them, and so t-errified them 
with their guns, that if any of them fired a giin at an Indian, even if 
be did not hit him, he would fall down from fear. So dreadfally 
fiighted they were, that they kept out of sight, farther and fe-rther, till 
Ht last our men, following themj and every day killing or wounding 
8ome of them, tliey kept so much up iii the woods and hollow places, 
that they were reduced to the utmost miseiy for want of food ; and 
pany were afterwards found dead in the woods, starved to death. 

"WTaen our men found this, it made their hearts relent^ and pity 
eepeciaJly nxoved the Spaniard governor, who was a gentlemanly 
geioerons-minded man. He proposed, if possible, to take one of them 
aliyi^ amd bring him to act as interpreter, to go among his feHows and 
see if they might be Inrought to some conditions, that might lead to 
saving their lives. One of them was at last surprised, weak, and half- 
starved. He was sullen at first, audi would neither eat nor drink ; but 
finding himself kindly treated, and no violence offered him, he at last 
grew tractable. They brought old Friday to him, who talked often 
with him, and told him how kind the others would be to them all ; that 
they would iK)t only save their Iives> but would give them a part of 
the islaiKi to live in, provided th^ would agree to keep in their own 
bounds, and not come beyond it, to injure oar prcr^udiee others ; that 
they should have com given them to planft and grow for their bread, 
bread also for their present subsistence ; and old Friday bade the fellow 
go and talk with his countr3nBen, and see what they said to it ; assuring 
them, that if they did not agree immediately they should be all 
destroyed. 

The poor wretches, humbled, and reduced in number to about thirty- 
seven, closed with the proposal at the first offer, and begged to have 
some food given them ; upon which twelve Spaniards and two English- 
men, well armed, with three Indian slaves, and old Friday, marched to 



I 



cf Bohinson Crusoe. 269 

l^e place 'where tliey were ; the three Indian slares -earned them a large 
quantity of bread, some rice boiled up to cakes, and dried in the sun, 
and three live goats ; and they were ordered to go to the side of a hill^ 
where they sat down, eat the provisions very thankfully, and turned out 
most faithful fellows to their words ; for, except when they cams to 
beg victuals, they never came out of their bounds. 

They had been taught both to plant com, make bread, breed tame 
goats, and milk them ; they wanted nothing but wives, and they sooB 
would have been a nation : they were confined to a neck of land, eui^ 
rounded by high rocks behind them, and a plain lying towards the sea 
before theni, on the south-east corner of the island ; they had land 
enough, and it was very good and frurtful ; about a mile and a half 
broad, and three or four miles in lengtL Our men had taught them to 
make wooden spades, such as I had made for myself ; and gave them 
twelve hatchets, and three or four knives ; and there they lived, the 
most harmless, innocent ca-eatures that ever were heard of. After this 
the colony enjoyed a perfect tranquillity fcom attacks of the savages ; 
not but that now and then some canoes of savages came on shore for 
their triumphal, unnatural feasts j but as thgr were of several nations, 
and, perhaps, had never heard of those that tsame before, or the reason 
of it, they did not make any search or inquiry after their countrymen j 
and if they had, it would have been very hard to have found them out. 

Thus, I have given a full account of all that had happened to the 
time of my return, at least, that was worth notice. The Indians, or 
ravages, were wonderfully civilized by them ; they frequently went 
among them, but forbid, on pain of death, any one of the Indians 
coming to th^n, because they would not have their settlement betrayed 
again. 

One thing was very remarkable, namely, that they taught the savages 
to make wicker- woik, ox baskets ; but they soon outdid their masters ; 
for they made abimdance of most ingenious things in wicker-work \ 
particularly all sorts of baskets, sieves, bird-cages, cupboards, &c. as also 
chairs to sit on, stools, beds, couches, and abundance of other things, 
being very ingenious at such work, when thoy were once put in the 
way of it. 

My coming was a particular relief to these people, because we fur- 
nished them with knives, scissors, spades, shovels, pick-axes, and all 
things of that kind which they could wanl 

With i3ie help of these tools they were so very handy, that they 
came, at last, to build up their huts, or houses, very handsomely ; rad- 
dling, or working it up like basket-work tdi Hie way round, which was

ayexy eztiiaordiiiaij |nooe otis^gmai^, and looked very odd i but waa 
aaezoeeding good tenoe, as wdl agiimt heat a^ against all sorts of 
Tennin ; and our men weie to taken wi& it, that thej got the sayagea 
to oome and do the Uke lor them ; oo that whea I came to sec the two 
Englifthmetfa eoloniea^ they looked^ at a distance^ as if they lived like 
heea in a hm ; and as fcr Aikin% who vrm now become a yerj in- 
dustriona, neeeaaaiy, and sober fellow; he had made himself such a tent 
of basket-work, as I belieTe was noTer s^en. It was 120 paces round 
JR the ootaids^ as I ineasnied bj my steps ; the walls were as close 
worked as a bai^t^ in panels or squares, of thirty-two in Dumber, 
pnd yeiy strong, standing about seren foot high ; m the middle wai 
another not above twenfy-two paces lonnd, but built still stronger, being 
eight square in its fonn, and in the eight corners stood eight veiy strong 
posts, round the top of which he laid strong pieces, pionod together with 
wooden pins, firom which he raised a p3framid for a roof of eight rafters, 
Tieij handsome^ I assure you, and very if ell joined togBther, though he 
had no naUs^ and only a few iron spikes, wfadch he made himself out 
of the old iron that I had left there; and indeed, this fellow showed 
idyiindance of ingenuity in several things ; he made a forge, with a pair 
of wooden bellows to blow the fire : he made himself chareoal for his 
•jmAf and he formed out of one of the iron crows a middhng good anvil 
to hammer upcm ; in this manner he made many things, but especially 
hooks^ staples and spikes, bolts and hinges. Btit to return to the 
house ; after he had pitched the roof of his innermost ient, he worked 
it up between the rafters with basket-work, so firrn^ and thatched that 
over again so ingeniously with rice straw, and over that a large leaf of 
a tree, which covered the lop, that his house was as dry as if it had 
been tiled or slated. He owned, indeed, that the savages made the 
basket-work for him. 

The outer circuit was covered, as a lean-to, all round this inner 
apartment^ and long rafters lay from the two and thirty angles to the 
top poets of the inner house, l)eing about twenty foot distant ; so that 
there was a spaee like a walk within the outer wicker-wall, and without 
the inner, near twenty foot wide. 

The inner place he partitioned off with the same wicker-work, but 
much fairer, and divided it into six apartments, so that he had six 
rooms on a floor, and out of every one of these there was a door ; first, 
into the entry, or coming into the main tent ; and another door into 
the space or walk that was round it ; so that walk was also divided 
into six equal parts, which served not only for retreat, but to store up 
any necessaries which the family had occasion for. These six spaces 



of Rohimon Crusoe. 271 

jiot taking up the whole circmnferenoe, what other apartments the outer 
circle had, were thus ordered : as soon as you were in at the door of 
the outer circle, you had a short passage straight before you to the door 
of the inner house ; but on either side was a wicker partition, and a 
door in it, by which you went, first, into a large room or store-house, 
twenty foot wide, and about thirty foot long, and through that into 
another not quite so long : so that in the outer circle were ten hand- 
some rooms, six of which were only to be ccmie at through the apart- 
ments of the inner tent, and served as closets or retiring rooms to the 
respective chambers of the inner circle : and four large -warehouses or 
bams, or what you please ta call them, whidi went in through one 
another, two on either hand of the passage that led through the outer 
door to the inner tent 

Such a piece of basket-work, I believe, was never seen in the world 
before ; nor a house or tent so neatly contrived, much less so built : in 
this great bee-hive lived the three families ; that is to say, W. Atkins, 
and his companion ; the third was killed, but his wife remained with 
three children ; for she was, it seems, big with child when he died ; 
and the other two were not at all backward to give the widow her full 
share of everything, I mean, as to theix com^ milk, grapes, &c. ; and 
when they killed a kid, or found a turtle on the shore ; so that they 
all lived well enough, though it was true, they were not so industrious 
as the other two, as has been observed already. 

Having made myself thoroughly acquainted with the state of the 
colony. I entered into a serious discourse with the Spaniard, whom 
I called governor, about their stay in the island ; for as I was 
XK)t come to carry any of them ofi^ sa it would not be just to take 
some and leave others. 

On the other hand, I told him, I came to establish them there, not 
to remove them ; and then I let them aU know, that I had brought 
with me relief of sundry kinds for them. That I had been at a great 
charge to supply them with all things necessary, as well for their con- 
venience as their defence ; and that I had such and such particular 
persons with me, as well to increase and recruit their number, as by the 
particular necessary employments which they were bred to, being 
artificers, to assist them in those things, in which, at present, they 
were to seek. 

They were all together when I talked thus to them ; and before I 
delivered to them the stores I had brought^ I asked them one by 
one, if they had entirely forgot and buried their early animosities, and 
would shake hands with one another, and engage in a strict friendship.

^Die Spaniaxda aaid, they had indaed, at £rst, disarmed and occluded 
Win Atlnni^ and his two counkymen^ for their bad conduct. Ai^ they 
appealed to nte, i&r ^e n^ce^sity they were under to do so ; hut that 
Will Addne had behaved himself so hrayely in the great fight they had 
with the aairages^ and on B&veral occasions sineB, and had diowed him- 
aelf 80 fidthfiil to^ and ao concerned for the geneml interestj that they 
had fozgotten all that was past, and thought he merited as much to h^ 
•troated with aims, and suppHed with necessaries, as any of them ; and 
that they had testified their satiefSaction in him, by conmuittai^ tlie 
command to him, next to the governor himself; and as they had an 
entire confidence in him, and all his eouD;trymen,«o they acknowledged, 
they had merited that confidence, by all the methods that honest men 
could merit to be valued and trusted : and they most heartily embraced 
the occasion of giving me this assurance, that they would never have 
any interest sep^urate from one another. 

Upon these frank and open declarations of &ieodship, we appointed 
the next day to dine all together ; and, indeed, we made a splendid feast 
I caused the ship's cook and his mate to come on shore, and dress our 
dinner ; and the old cook's nuite we had on shore assisted. We brought 
on shore six pieces of good beef^ and four pieces of pork, out of the 
ship's provision, with our punch bowl, and materials to fill it ; and in 
particular, I gave them ten bottles of French claret, and ten bottles of 
English beer ; things that neither the Spaniards, or the Englishmen had 
tasted for many years ; and which, it may be supposed were exceeding 
acceptable. 

The Spaniards added to our feast five whole kids, which the cooks 
roasted ; and tbree of them were sent covered up dose, on board the 



of Rohinson Crusoe* 



273 



ship to the seamen^ that they might feast on fresh meat from the shore, 
as we did with their salt meat from on board. 

After this feast, at which we were very innocently merry, I brought 
out my cargo of goods, wherein, that there might be no dispute about 
dividing, I showed them that there was sufficient for them all ; desired, 
that they might all take an equal quantity of the goods that were for 
wearing ; that is to say, equal when made up. 

Then 1 presented to them the people I had brought with me ; par- 
ticularly the tailor, the smith, and the two carpenters, all of them most 
necessary people ; but above all, my general artificer, than whom they 
could not name anything that was more useful to them ; and the tailor, 
to show his concern for them, went to work immediately, and with my 




leave, made them every one a shirt the first thing he did ; and what 
was still more, he taught the women not only how to sew and stitch, 
and use the needle, but made them assist to make the shirts for their 
husbands, and for all the rest 

As to the carpenters, I scarce need mention how useful they were, 
for they took in pieces all my clumsy, unhandy things, and made them 
clever, convenient tables, stools, bedsteads, cupboards, lockers, shelves, 
and everything they wanted of that kind. 

Then I brought them out all my store of tools, and gave every man 
a digging spade, a shovel, and a rake, for we had no harrows or 
ploughs ; and to every separate place, a pick-axe, a crow, a broad-axe, 
and a saw ; always appointing, that as often as any waa broken, or

worn-outj thej shoiild be eupplied without grudgingj out of the general 
stores that I left behind 

Nails, staples, Miigea, hammerg^ chmels, knives, aeissoiSj and all sorts 
of tools and iroia-woikj they had without tale, as they required ; for no 
man would care to take nlore than they wanted j and he must be a fool 
that would waste or spoil them, on any account whatever. And for the 
Ti&e of the smith, I left two tons of un wrought iron for a supply. 

The magazine of powder and anns I had brought with me waa in 
such profusion that they could not but rejoice ; ibr now every man 
could march as I used to do, with a musket upon each shoulderj if 
there wai occasion ; and were able to fight 1 ^000 savagea, if they had 
but some little advantages of situation. 

I carried on shore with me the young man wboa© mother was starved 
to death, and the maid also ; she waa a sober, well-educated, religious 
young woman, and behaved ao inofTenaively, that evei^ one giive her a 
good word. They had both of them come to me, and desired I 
would give them leave to remain on the island, and be entered among 
my famOyj as they called it, I agreed readily } and they had a little 
plot of ground allotted to them^ whore they Lad three tents or houses 
set up, surrounded with aTsaaket-work, palisado'd like Atkins's, adjoining 
to hia plantation j their tents were contrived so, that they had ea^^h of 
them a room apart to lodge in^ and a middle tent, like a great store- 
house, to lay all their goods in, and to eat and drink in. And now the 
other two Englishmen removed their habitation to the same place ; and so 
the Island was divided into three colonies, and no more ; namely, The 
Spaniards, with old Friday, and the first servants, at my old habitation 
under the hill, which was, in a word, the capital city, and where they 
had so enlarged and extended their works, as well under as on the 
outside of the hill, that they lived, though perfectly concealed, yet fiill 
at large. !N'ever was there such a little city in a wood, and so hid, I 
believe, in any part of the world. For I verily believe 1,000 men 
might have ranged the island a month, and, if they had not known 
there was such a thing, and looked on purpose for it, they would not 
have found it. 

The other colony was that of W. Atkins's, where there were four 
families of Englishmen, I mean those I had left there, with their wives 
and children. Three savages, that were slaves, the widow and children 
of the Englishman that was killed ; the young man and the maid; and, 
by the way, we made a wife of her also, before we went away. There 
were also the two carpenters and the tailor I brought with me for them ; 
and the smith also, who was a very necessary man to them, especially 



of Jtohinson Crusoe. 27*^ 

as a gnnsmith^ to take core of their arms ; and my other man, whom I 
called Jack of all trades ; who was in himself as good almost as twenty 
men, for he was not only a very ingenious fellow, but very merry 
withal ; and, before I went away, we married him to the honest maid 
that came with the youth in the ship, I mentioned before. 

And now I speak of marrying, it brings me naturally to say some- 
thing of the French ecclesiastic I had taken out of the ship burnt at 
sea. This man was a Roman, perhaps of the most possible type in the 
eyes of Protestants ; first he was a Papist ; secondly, a Popish priest ; 
and, thirdly, a French Popish priest But justice demands of me to 
give him a due character ; and I must say, he was a grave, sober, pious, 
and most religious person ; exact in his life, extensive in his charity, 
and exemplary in ahnost everything he did. 

The first hour that I began to converse with him, after he had agreed 
to go with me to the East Indies, I found reason to delight exceedingly 
in his conservation. He first began to converse with me about religion, 
in the most obliging manner imaginable. " Sir," says he, "you have 
not only, under (jOD (and at that he crossed his breast), saved my 
life, but you have admitted me to go this voyage in your ship, and 
by your obliging civility, have taken me into your family, giving me an 
opportunity of free conversation. Now sir," says he, "you see by 
my habit what my profession is ; and I guess your's by your nation. 
I may think it my duty, and doubtless it is so, to use my utmost 
endeavours, on all occasions, to bring all the souls I can to embrace the 
Catholic doctrine ; but, as I am under your permission, and in your 
femily, I am bound in justice to your Idndness, as well as in decency 
and good manners, to be under your government ; and therefore I shall 
not, without your leave, enter into any debates on religion, in which 
we may not agree, farther than you shall give me leave." 

I told him, his carriage was so modest, that I could not but acknow- 
ledge it ; that it was true, we were such people as they call heretics ; 
"but that he was not the first Catholic that I had conversed with, 
without carrying the questions to any height in debate ; that he should 
not find himself the worse used for being of a different opinion 
from us." 

Having thus arranged the terms of our intercourse, he gave me a most 
diverting account of his life, and of the many extraordinary events of 
it ; of many adventures which had befallen him in the few years that 
he had been abroad in the world ; he had been five times shipped and 
unshipped on his present voyage, and never been able to reach the 
place whither the ships he was in were at first designed. His first

intent was, to have gone to Maiiinico ; and went on board a ship bound 
thither at Si Maloej hut was forced into Lisbon by bad weather, the 
ship received some damage^ by running aground in the montb of tbe 
river Tagita, and was obliged to unload her cargo there- Finding a 
Portuguese ship there, hound to the Madeiras and ready to Bail^ he went 
on board, but the raijster heiug an indifferent mariner, had been out in 
hh reckoning, and they drove to Fial, where he sold his cargo. He was 
then as far m the Bania, where be met with a French ship honnd from 
France to Quebec, and from thence to Martinico. But when he came 
to Quebec, the master of the ship died, and the ship proceeded no 
farther. So the next voyage he shipped Imnsclf for France, in the ship 
that was burnt, when we took them np at sea, and then shipped with 
us for the East Indiea, He now came to mo one momingj and told me 
with a very grave countenance, that he had, for two or three day% 
desired an opportunity of aome discourse with me, which, be bope(^ 
should not he displeasing to me, because he thought it mighty iu some 
measure, correspond with my general design, which was the prosperity 
of my new colony; and, perhaps, might put it, at least more than he yet 
thought it was, in the way of God's hlessiog. 

I looked a little suxpriBcd at his discourse j and after a long con- 
76rsation, in which X was compelled more than ever to admire this man's 
pious and aeif-aacrificing spirit, I learned that his conscience was 
shocked to find the five Englishmen hving on with the fi?e women 
though unmarried, and he urged me to put an end to this unholy 
union. 

" Sir," said he, " the essence of the sacrament of matrimony consists 
not only in the mutual consent of the parties to take one another as 
man and wife, but in the formal and legal obligation that there is in 
the contract, to compel the man and woman, at all times, to own and 
acknowledge each other; obliging the man to abstain fiK)m all the other 
women, to engage in no other contract while these subsist 

'^ And how shall a blessing succeed your endeavours in this place, 
however good in themselves, and however sincere in your design, while 
these men, who at present are your subjects, under your absolute govern- 
ment and dominion, are allowed by you to live in open adultery? 

" -Again, sir," said he, " though I do not acknowledge your religion, 
or you mine, yet we should be glad to see even the devil's servants 
taught to know the general principles of the Christian religion ; that 
they might at least hear of God, and of a Redeemer, and of the resur- 
rection, and of a future state, things which we all believe ; they would 
at least be so much nearer coming into the bosom of the true church, 



of Robinson Crusoe. 277 

than they are now, in the public profession of idolatry, and devil- 
worship. 

" 0, sir," he added, " this thing is not your fault, nor is it too late 
yet Give me leave to talk with those poor men about it, and then 
leave them to the mercy of Christ It is our business to assist them, 
encourage them, and instruct them ; and, if you will give me leave, and 
God His blessing, I do not doubt but the poor ignorant souls shall be 
brought into the great circle of Christianity." 

. And now came his concluding petition. " It is a maxim, sir, that is, 
or ought to be, received among all Christians, of what church, or pre- 
tended church soever, namely, the Christian knowledge ought to be 
propagated by all possible means, and on all possible occasions. It is 
on this principle that our church sends missionaries into Persia, India, 
and China ; and that our clergy, even of the superior sort, willingly 
engage in the most hazardous voyages, and the most dangerous residence, 
among murderers and barbarians, to teach them the knowledge of the 
true God, and to bring them over to embrace the Christian faitL Now, 
sir, you have such an opportunity, here are six or seven-and-thirty poor 
savages to be brought over from idolatry to the knowledge of God, theii 
Maker and Redeemer." 

I explained to him my engagements in regard to the ship, and the 
impossibility of my undertaking the office he would thrust upon me. 
" It is a valuable thing," said I, " to be an instrument in God's hand, 
to convert seven-and-thirty heathens to the knowledge of Christ ; but 
as you are an ecclesiastic, and are given over to the work, so that it 
seems naturally to fall into the way of your profession, how is it that 
you do not rather offer yourself to undertake it, than press me to it ? " 

Upon this he faced about, just before me, as we walked along, and, 
putting me to a full stop, made me a very low bow. " I most heartily 
thank God, and you, sir," says he, " for giving me so evident a call to 
so blessed a work ; and if you think yourself discharged from it, and 
desire me to undertake it, I will most readily do it, and think it a 
happy reward for all the hazards and difficulties of such a broken, dis- 
appointed voyage as I have met with, that I may be dropped at last 
into so glorious a work." 

I discovered a kind of rapture in his face, while he spoke this to me ; 
his eyes sparkled like fire, his face glowed, and his colour came and 
went, as if he had been falling into fits : in a word, he was fired with 
the jpy of being embarked in such a work. 

" Yes, sir," says he, " I would give Christ and the Blessed Virgin 
thanks all my days, if I could be made the least happy instrument of

concerned at this ; for be bad no rational access to these poor peopk^ 
seeing be did not understand one word of their language, or they one 
word of his. To remove this difficulty, I told him that Friday's &ther 
had learned Spanish, which I found he also understood, and would 
serve him for an interpreter ; but Providence gave another and very 
happy turn to all this. 

When we came to the Englishmen, to whose quarter I was going 
wben this conversation took place, I sent for them all together ; and 
after reminding them what I had done for them, I talked to them 
about their wives. 

They all gave me the answer that I expected^ namely^ that there was 
nobody to marry them ; that they agreed before the governor to keep 
them as their wives ; and they thought, as things stood with tbem, 
they were as legally married as if they had been married by a parson, 
and with all the formalities in the worid. 

I told them, that no doubt they were married in the sight of God ; 
but the laws of man being otherwise, I could not think it was convenient 
they should continue together as man and wife ; for that it was both 
scandalous to men, and offensive to God, who never could bless them, 
if they went on thus. 



of Robinson Crusoe. 279 

All this went on as I expected ; and they told me, especially Will 
Atkins, who seemed now to speak for the rest, that they loved their 
wives as well as if they had been born in their own native country, and 
would not leave them upon any account whatever ; and they did verily 
believe their wives were as virtuous and as modest as any women could 
possibly be ; and they would not part with them on any account. 

This was just as I would have it ; the priest was not with me at that 
moment, but was not far off. So, to tiy him farther, I told him I had 
a clergyman with me, and, if he was sincere, I would have him married 
the next morning ; and bid him consider of it, and talk with the rest 
He said, as for himself, he need not consider of it at all ; for he was 
very reedy to do it, and was glad I had a minister with me ; and he 




believed they would be all willing also. I then told him, that my 
friend, the minister, was a Frenchman, and could not speak English ; 
but that I would act as clerk between them. He never so much as 
asked me whether he was a Papist or Protestant ; which was indeed 
what I was afraid of. And so we parted. I went back to my clergy- 
man, and Will Atkins went in to fcalk with his companions. 

Before I went from their quarter, they all came to me, and told me 
they had been considering what I had said ; that they were very glad 
to hear I had a clergyman ia my company ; and they were very willing 
to give me the satisfaction I desired, and would be formally married as 
soon as I pleased ; for they were far from desiring to part with their 
wives ; and that they meant nothing but what was very honest, when

they chose them- The women were easily made sensible of the meanSg^H 
of the thuigj and weie very well satisiied with it, m, indeedj they hsd ■ 
reaaon to he ; so they faile^l not to attend all together, at my apart mpnt^ fl 
the next morning, where I hrought out my clergyman : and though H 
he had not on a minister » g^^'n? after the nmmier of England, or the ■ 
hahit of a priest^ after the matinet of France ; yet having a blaok vestj H 
something like a cassock, with a sash ronnd it, he did not look yery H 
unlike a minister ; and aa for hia language, I was his interpreter, B 

After a moat Chriatian-like disconraej which I interpreted to the men, H 
in which they wera exhorted to persuade their wives to embrace I 
Christiamty, he mamed throe couple ; but Will Atkins and his wife H 
were not yet come in. After this, my clergyman, waiting a while, was H 
cui'ious to know where Atkins was gone ; and, turning to me, says he, H 
" I entreat you, fir, let us walk out of your labyrinth here> and look ; V 
I dare say wo sliall find this poor man somewhere or other, talking 
seriously to hia wife, and teaching her abeady something of religEon." h 
I began to he of the same mind ; so we went out together ; and I H 
carried liini by a way which none knew but myself, and where the 
trees were eo thick set, that it was not easy to see through the tJiicket 
of leaves, and far harder to see in, than to see out ; when conmig to the 
edge of the waotl, I saw Atkins, and his tawny savage wife, iitting under 
the shade of a bush, very eager in discourse, t stopped short, till my 
clergyman came up to me ; and then, having showed him where they 
were, we stood and looked very steadily at tliem a good whUo. 

"We observed him very earnest with her, pointing up to the sun and 
to every quarter of the heavens ; then down to the earth, then out to 
the sea, then to himself then to her, to the woods, to the trees. 
" Now," says my clergyman, " you see my words are made good ; the 
man preaches to her ; mark him ; now he is teUing her that GrOD has 
made him, and her, and the heavens, the earth, the sea, the woods, the 
trees." " I believe he is," said L Immediately after we peiceiyed 
Will Atkins start up upon his feet^ fall down on his knees, and lift 
up both his hands ; we suppose he said something; but we could not 
hear him : it was too far for that : he did not continue kneeling half a 
minute, but comes and sits down again by his wife, and talks to her 
again. We perceived then the woman very attentive; but whether 
she said any thing or no, we could not tell. While the poor fellow was 
upon his knees, I coiuld see the tears run plentifully down my clergy- 
man's cheeks ; and I could hardly forbear myself; but it was a great 
affliction to us both, that we were not near enough to hear any thing 
that passed between them. 



I 



of Robinson Crusoe. 281 

Well, however, we could come no nearer, for fear of disturbing 
them : so we resolved to see an end of this piece of still conversation ; 
and it spoke loud enough to us, without the help of voice. He sat 
down again, as I have said, close by her, and talked again earnestly to 
her ; and two or three times we could saw him embrace her most pas- 
sionately ; another time we saw him take out his handkerchief, and 
wipe her eyes, and then kiss her again, with a kind of transport very 
unusual ; and after several of these things, we saw him on a sudden jump 
up again, and lend her his hand to help her up ; when immediately 
leading her by the hand a step or two, they both kneeled down together, 
and continued so about two minutes. 




My friend could bear it no longer, but cries out aloud, " St. Paul, 
St. Paul ! behold he prayeth ! " I was afraid Atkins would hear him ; 
therefore I entreated him to withhold himself awhile, that we might see 
an end of the scene, which to me, I must confess, was the most affecting, 
and yet the most agreeable, that ever I saw in my life. This continued 
about half a quarter of an hour, and then they walked away ; so that 
we could see no more of them in that situation. 

Well, as Will Atkins and his wife were gone, our business there was 
over ; so we went back our own way ; and when we came back, we 
found them waiting to be called in. Observing this, I asked my clergy- 
man if we should discover to him that we had seen Iiitti under the bush, 
or no ; and it was his opinion we should not ; but that we should talk 
to him first, and hear what he would say to us ; so we called hiTn in 
alone nobody being in the place but ourselves. 



9tA Wf ^^ ^if^ ^^ Adventures 

* Ths feBQlt of OUT questioiiiiig was tLat Atkins confesseJ tlmt his 
&ther had "been a clergyman, that his own wicked beha^dour had 
brought Mb grey haira with sorrow to the gravej and that now his con- 
science "WHS awakened he was full of remorse and repentance for his 
past condnet ; in fact^ he was tmly penitent^ and although it was no 
easy thing to make the wife understand the doctrines of Christianity, 
it at length appeared that she so far comprehended them as to wish for 
haptism b^re they married. 

This "was explained to me hy my priest, who, turning himself to me, 
said he believed there muit be more to do with thiis woman than to 
many her ; that she ought to be baptized Erst. 

I agreed with him in that part readily, and was for going about it 
piesently. " No^ no j hold, Sir/* Baid he, " though I would Kave her 
be baptized by all meansj yet I must observe, that WiQ Atkins, her 
hosbandf has brought her, in a wonderfid manner, to embrace a religious 
life; and has given her just ideas of the being of a God, of His power, 
jnstieiB^ mercy ; yet I desire to know of him, if he has said anythiog 
to her of Jesus Christ, and of the salvation of sinners ; of the natin:^ 
of &ith in Him ; and redemption by Him i of the Holy Spirit, tlie 
lesorrection, the l^t judgment, and a future state/' 

I called Will Atkins again, and asked liim i but the poor fellow fell 
immediately into tears ; he told us, he bad said something to her of all 
those things, but that he was himself so wicked a creatorey and his own 
conscience so reproached him with his ungodly life, that he trembled 
at the apprehensions, that her knowledge of him should lessen the 
attention she should give to those things, and make her rather contemn 
religion than receive it ; but he was assured, he said, that her mind 
was so disposed to receive due impressions of all those things, that if 
I would but discourse with her, she would make it appear to my satis- 
faction, that my labour would not be lost upon her. 

Accordingly I called her in, and placing myself as interpreter, the 
good man explained them with the sincerity of a Christian, and without 
any of the Eoman Catholic errors. In a word, he brought the poor 
woman to embrace the knowledge of Christ, and of redemption by TTim^ 
not with wonder and astonishment only, as she did the first notions of 
a God, but with joy and faith, with an affection, and a surprising degree 
of understanding, scarce to be imagined, much less to be expressed ; 
and at her own request she was baptized. 

When he was preparing to baptize her, I entreated him, that he 
would perform that office with some caution, that the man might not 
perceive he was of the Eoman church, because of other ill consequences 



of Robinson Crusoe^ 



283 



which might attend a difference among us in that very religion, which 
we were instructing the other in. He told me that as he had no con- 
secrated chapel, no proper things for the ojffice, I should see he would 
do it in a manner that I should not know hy it that he was a Roman 
Catholic myself, if I had not known it before : and so he did ; foi 
saying only some words over to himself in Latin, which I could not 
understand, he poured a whole dish full of water upon the woman's 
head, pronouncing in French very loud, Mary — ^which was the name 
her husband desired me to give her, for I was her godfather — I baptize 
thee in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy 
Ghost ; so that none could know anything by it, what religion he was 
of : he gave the benediction afterwards in Latin ; but either Will 




Atkins did not know but it was in French, or else did not take notice 
of it at that time. 

As soon as this was over, we married them ; and after the marriage 
was over, he turned himself to Will Atkins, and in a very affectionate 
manner exhorted him not only to persevere in that good disposition he 
was in, but to support the convictions that were upon him, by a 
resolution to reform his life : told hiTn, it was in vain to say he 
repented, if he did not forsake his crimes ; represented to him, how 
God had honoured him with being the instrument of bringing his wife 
to the knowledge of the Christian religion ; and that he should be 
carefol he did not dishonour the grace of God ; and that if he did, he 
would see the heathen a better Christian than himself 



Bftviog HboB bioiiglit the alfair of the island to a narrow compass^ I 
Tn^pxepftrillgto g<^ on board the ship, when the young man, whom I had 
taken oat of tlia famished ship's company, came to me, and told me, 
}kd understood I had a clergyman with me, and that he had a match 
toc^ vliicli lie deaired might h© finished hefore I went^ between two 
CShristiaiui | wMc^h he hoped would not be dieagreoabia to ma 

I loiew this must be the young woman who was his mother's seryant^ 
- fi^ tiheEe wite no other Christian woman on the island ; so I began to 
penroadellimnot to do anything of that kind rashly; but he interruptad 
mdt smilingy aiid told me, with a great deal of modesty, that I was 
misteken in my guesses ; that he had nothing of that kind in his 
l^ngUlL In fact he told ma it was my Jack of all trades, and his 
maid Bxuuokf he wished to see mamed 

I was mosi agreeably surprised when he named the match; for 
indeed I thought it very suitable. The character of that man I have 
giTen alieadj ; and as for the maid, she was a very honest, modesty 
sober, and idigious young woman ; hnd a very good share of sense ; was 
i^^reeable enough bx her pBison ; spoke very handsomely, and to the 
puipoee. 

Hie match being proposed in this meaner, we mBrried them the 
same day ; and, as I was father at the altar, bm I may say, and gave her 
away, so I gave her a portion ; for I appointed her and her husband a 
handsome large space of ground for their plantation 

One thing I must not omit to meopktic^ among the arrangements I 
completed before I left them. And this is, that being now settled in 
a kind of commonwealth among themselves, and havhig much business 
in hand, it seemed odd to have seven-and-thirty Indians live in a nook 
of the island, independent, and imemployed ; for, excepting the pro- 
viding themselves food, which they had difficulty enough in too, some- 
times, they had no manner of employment. I proposed therefore to 
the governor Spaniard, that he should visit them with Friday's &thei]^ 
and propose to them to remove, and either plant for themselves, or take 
them into their several families as servants, to be maintained for their 
labour, but vidthout being slaves ; for they had their liberty given them 
by capitulation, and, as it were, articles of surrender, which ought not 
to be broken. They most willingly embraced the proposal, and came 
aU very cheerfully along with him ; so we allotted them land and 
plantations, which three or four accepted oi^ but all the rest chose to be 
employed as servants iu the several families we had settled. 

All the east end of the island was stiU left uninhabited, that if any 
of the savages should come on shore there, for their usual customary 



of Bobinaon Crusoe. 286 

tarbarities, they might come and go ; if they disturbed nobody, nobody 
would disturb them; and no doubt but they were often ashore, and 
went away again; for I never heard that the planters were ever 
attacked or disturbed any more. 

It now came into my thoughts, that I had hinted to my Mend the 
clergyman, that the work of converting the savages might, perhaps, be 
set on foot in his absence, to his satisfaction. I told him, we would 
either call them all together, and leave it in charge with them, or go to 
them one by one, which he thought best; so we divided it, he to speak 
to the Spaniards, who were aU Papists, and I to the English, who 
were all Protestants ; and we recommended it earnestly to them, and 
made them promise, that they would never make any distinction of 
Papist or Protestant, in their exhorting the savages to turn Christians. 

When I came to W. Atkins's house — I may call it so ; for such a 
house, or such a piece of basket-work, I believe was not standing in the 
world again ; I say when I came there, I found the young woman I 
have mentioned above, and W. Atkins's wife were become intimates ; 
and this prudent, religious young woman had perfected the work Will 
Atkins had begun ; and though it was not above four days after what 
I have related, yet the new baptized woman was such a Christian, as I 
have seldom heard of any like her. 

It came next into my mind, in the morning, before I went to them, 
that amongst all the needful things I had to leave with them, I had 
not lefb them a bible ; in which I showed myself less considerate for 
them, than my good friend the widow was when she sent me the cargo 
of an hundred pounds fi-om Lisbon, where she packed up three ^ubles 
and a prayer-book. However the good woman's charity had a j^/ieater 
extent than ever she imagined ; for they were reserved for the comfort 
and instruction of those that made much better use of them than I 
had done. 

I took one of the bibles in my pocket, and when I came to Will 
Atkins's tent, or house, I found the young woman, and Atkins's baptized 
wife, had been discoursing of religion together ; for Will Atkins told 
it me, with a great deal of joy. I asked if they were together now ? 
And he said " yes ; " so I went into the house, and he with me, and we 
found them together, very earnest in discourse. " 0, Sir," says Will 
Atkins, " when God has sinners to reconcile to Himself and aliens to 
bring home. He never wants a messenger. My wife has got a new 
instructor ; I knew I was unworthy, as I was incapable of that work ; 
that young woman has been sent hither from Heaven ; she is enough 
to convert a whole island of savages." The young woman blushed, and 



S80 7%e Life and Adventures 

torn up to go away, but I desired her to sit still ; I told lier "she had a 
good work upon lier hands, and I hoped God would bless her m it.'* 

And now I have done with the island. I left them all in good cii- 
cumstancefij and in a flonrishing condition, and went on board my ship 
again J having been five-and-twenty days among them; and as they were 
all roaolted to staj upon the island till I came to remove them^. After 
talking a little^ I put mj band in my pocket, and pulled out my hibie^

The next day, giving them a salute of five guns at partingj we i 
flail, and arrived at the hay of All SaintSj in the BraaOB, in about ' 
twenty-two days : meeting nothing remarkable in our passage but tim 
That about three d&ys after we sailed, being becalmed, and the cncrent 
setting strong to the KK.E, running as it were into a hay on the — 
land-side, we were driven something out of our course ; and oneo or ■ 
twice our men cried outj Land to the eastward ^ but whether it was 
the continent, or islanda, we could not tell by any means. But the 
third day^ towards evening, the sea smooth and the weather calm, w© M 
saw the sea, as it were, covered, towards the land, with something very ■ 
black, not being able to discover what it was; till, after some time, our 
chief mate going up the main shrouds a little way, and looking at them 
with a glass, cried out, it was an army. I could not imagine what hd 
meant by an army, and spoke a little hastily, calling the fellow a fool, 
or some such word. "Nay, Sir," says he, "do not be angry, for it is an 
army, and a fleet too ; for I believe there are a thousand canoes, and yoa 
inay see them paddle along, and they are coming towards us too, apace." 

I was a little surprised, but I told the sailors they had nothing to 
fear but Are ; and therefore they should get their boats out, and fasten 
them, one close by the head, and the other by the stem, and man them 
both well, and wait the issue in that posture ; this I did, that the men 
in the boats might be ready, with skeets and buckets, to put out any 
fire these savages might endeavour to fix to the outside of the ship. 

In this posture we lay by for them, and in a little while they came 
up with us, but never was such a horrid sight seen by Christians. My 
mate was much mistaken in his calculation of their number, I mean of 
a thousand canoes ; the most we could make of them when they came 




CRUSOE QIVINa BIBLE TO WILL ATKINS 



of Eohinson Oruaoe. 287 

up, being about a hundred and twenty-six, and enough of them too ; 
for some of them had sixteen or seventeen men in them, and some 
more, and the least of them six or seven. When they came nearer to 
ns, they seemed to be struck with wonder and astonishment. They came 
boldly up, however, very near, and seemed about to row round us ; but 
we called to our men in the boats, not to let them come too near them. 



This very order brought us to an engagement with them, without 
our designing it; for five or six of their large canoes came so near our 
long-boat, that our men beckoned with their hands to them to keep 
them back; which they understood very well, and went back; but in 
their retreat about fifty arrows came on board us from those boats ; and 
one of our men in the long-boat was very much wounded. I called to 
them not to fire by any means ; but we handed down some deal board 
into the boat, and the carpenter presently set up a kind of a fence, like 
waste boards, to cover them from the arrows of the savages, if they 
should shoot again. 

About half an hour afterwards they came all up in a body astern o% 
and pretty near us, so near that we could easily discern them, though 
we could not tell their design. I now found they were some of my old 
friends, the same sort of savages that I had been used to engage with ; 
and in a little time more they rowed a little farther out to sea, till they 
came directly broadside with us, and then rowed down straight upon 
us, coming so near that we could hear them speak. I ordered all my 
men to keep close, lest they should shoot any more arrows, and make 
aU our guns ready; but being so near as to be within hearing, I made 
Friday go out upon the deck, and call out aloud to them in his language 



288 The lAJk and Adventures 

to know what they meant; wliich according] j he did. Whether thej* 
iindoTstood him or not^ T know not ; hiit, as eoon as he had called to 
them, six of tfeem, who were in the foremost hosts j exMbited a geatnro 
of great eontempt, Wli ether this was done sa a defiance or a challenge, 
or as a signal to the rest, we knew not ; but immediatelj Friday cried 
out, " Tliey are going to shoot ; '^ and nnhappily for him tkej let Sy 
about 300 of their arrows ; and, to my inexpressible grief, killed poor 
Friday, no other man being in their sight The poor fellow waa shot 
with no less than three arrows, and about three more fell Tery neax 
him I such unlucky markamen they wera 

I was so enraged with the loss of my old servant, the companion of 
all mj sorrows and solitudes, that I immediately ordered five guns to 
be loaded with small shot, and four with great ; and gave them such a 
broadside aa they had never heard in their lives before, to be sure. 

They were not above half a cable length off when we fired; and our 
gunners took their aim so well, that three or four of their canoes were 
overset, as we had reason to believe, by one shot only, 

I can neither tell how many we kOled^ or how many we wounded j 
at this broadside ; but surely encli a fright and htnry was never seen 
among such a multitude ; there were thirteen or fourteen of their canoes 
split, and overset in all; and the men ail swimming about; the rest, 
frightened out of their wits, scoured away as fast as they could, taking 
but little care to save those whose boats were split or spoiled with our 
shot; BO I suppose they wore many of them lost ; and our men picked 
up one poor fellow swimming for his life, aboTe an hour after they 
were all gone. 

The small shot firom our cannon must needs have killed and wounded 
a great many; but, in short, we never knew anything how it went 
with them; for they fled so fast, that, in three hours, or thereabonta^ 
we could not see above three or four straggling canoes ; nor did we evwf 
see more of them; for a breeze springing up the same evienin^ w» 
weighed and set sail for the Brasils. 

We had a prisoner indeed, but the creature was so sullen, that he 
would neither eat nor speak ; and we all fancied he would starve himself 
to death ; but I took a way to cure hiTn, for I made them take him into 
the long-boat, and make him believe they would toss him into the sea 
again, and so leave him where they found him, if he would not speak: 
they really did throw him into the sea, and come away from Tiitri, and 
then he followed them, for he swam like a cork, and called to them in 
his tongue, though they knew not one word of what he said. However, 
at last, they took him in again, and then he began to be more tractable.

We were now under sail again, but I was disconsolate for my man 
Friday. "We had one prisoner, as I liave said; but it was a long while 
before we could make him understand anything; but, in time, our men 
taught him some English, and he began to be a little tractable : lifter- 
wards we inquired what country he came from, but could make nothing 
of what he said ; for his speech was so odd, all gutturals, and spoke in 
the throat in such a hollow odd manner, that we could neyer form a 
word after him. 

And now I must take my last leave of poor honest Friday ! We 
buried hiTn with all the decency and solemnity possible, by putting him 
into a coffin, and throwing him into the sea ; and I caused them to fire 
eleyen guns over him : and so ended the life of the most grateful, 
flEdthfal, honest, and most affectionate servant that ever man had. 

We went now away with a fair wind for Brasil, and, in about twelve 
days' iame, we made land in the latitude of five degrees south of the 
line, being the north-eastermost land of all that part of America. . We 
kept on S. by E. in sight of the shore four days, when we made the 
Cape St. Augustine, and in three days more came to an anchor off of 
the bay of All Saints, the old place of my deliverance, firom whence 
came both my good and evil fate. 

Here, my honest and truly pious clergyman lefb me ; a ship being 
ready to go to Lisbon, he asked me leave to go thither in her ; being 
still, as he observed, bound never to finish any voyage he began. How 
happy had it been for me, if I had gone with him. But it was too late 
now ; all things Heaven appoints are best ; had I gone with him, I 
had never had so many things to be thankful fbr, and you had never 
heard of the second part of the Travels and Adventures of Eobin 
Crusoe ; so I must leave here the fruitless exclaiming at myself, and 
go on with my voyage. 

From the Brasils we made directly away over the Atlantic sea, to the 
Cape of Good Hope ; and had a tolerable good voyage. Our ship was 
on a trading voyage, and had a supercargo on board, who was to direct 
all her motions, after she arrived at the Cape. We made therefore no 
stay, longer than was needful to take in fresh water, but made the best 
of our way for the coast of Coromandel; we were indeed informed that 
a French man-of-war of fifty guns, and two large merchant ships, were 
gone for the Indies ; and, as I knew we were at war with France, I 
had some approhensions of them ; but they went their own way, and 
we heard no more of them. 

We touched first at the island of Madagascar, where, though the 
people are fierce and treacherous, and, in particular, very well armed 

u

with lances and bows, w^hich they use with mconcoiTable dexterityj jei 
we fared very well with them awhile ; they treated ub yery civilly ; 
and for some trifles which we gave them, such m knivaa, scissors, &c; 
they brought us eleven good fat bullocks, middliiig in aixe, but very 
good in fleah ; which we took in, partly for fresh provisions for oux 
present spending, and the rest to salt for the ship's nae. 

We w^ero obliged to stay here some time, after we had furnished 
ourselves with proyisiona j and I, that was always too curious to look 
into every nook of the world wherever I came, was for going on shore 
as often as I could. It was on the east side of the island that we went 
on shore one evening ; and the people, who, by the way, are veiy 
numerous, came thronging about us, and stood gazing at us at a 
distance ; hut as we had traded freely with them, and had been kindly 
used, we thought ourselves in no danger; but when we saw the people, 
we cut thrae boughs out of a tree, and stuck them at a distance from 
us, which, it seema, is a mark in the country, not only of truce and 
friendship, but when it is accepted, the other side set up three poles, 
or houghs also ; which is a signal that they accept the truce too ; hut 
then this is a known condition of the truce^ that you are not to p^ 
beyond their three poles towards them, nor they to come past your 




three poles or boughs towards you ; so that yon are perfectly secuie 
within the three poles : and all the space between your poles and 
theirs, is market for free converse, traffic, and commerce. When 
you go there you must not carry your weapons with you ; and if they 
come into that space, they stick up their javelins and lances a|; the first 
poles, and come on unarmed. 



of Robinson Crusoe, 291 

It happened one evening, when we went on shore, that a greater 
number than usual of these people came down, but all was veiy friendly 
and civil, and they brought in several kinds of provisions, for which we 
satisfied them with such toys as we had ; their women also brought us 
milk and roots, and several things very acceptable to us, and all was 
quiet j and we made us a little tent, or hut, of some boughs of trees, 
and lay on shore all night. I know not why, but I was not so well 
satisfied to lie on shore as the rest ; and the boat riding at au anchor 
about a stone cast from the land, with two men in her, I made one of 
them come on shore, to get some boughs of trees to cover us, and 
spreading the sail on the bottom of the boat, I lay with them all night 
in the boat imder the boughs. 

About two o'clock in the morning we heard a terrible noise on 
shore, one of our men calling out for GoD*s sake to bring the boat in, 
and come and help them, for they were all like to be murdered; at the 
same time, five muskets were discharged, and that three times over ; 
rousing immediately, I caused the boat to be thrust in, and with the three 
fdsils we had on board, hastened to assist our men. We got the boat 
soon to the shore; and our men plunged into the water, to get to the 
boat with aU the expedition they could, being pursued by between three 
and four hundred natives. Our men were but nine in all, and only five 
of them had fusils with them ; the rest had indeed pistols and swords, 
but they were of small use to them. We took up seven of them, and 
with difficulty enough too, three of them being badly wounded ; and 
what was worse, while we stood in the boat, we were in as much danger 
as they were on shore; for they poured their arrows in upon us so thick, 
that we were fain to barricade the side of the boat with benches, and 
two or three loose boards, which we had, by mere accident, or providence, 
in the boat Had it been daylight, they are, it seems, such exact 
marksmen, that if they could have seen but the least part of any of us, 
they would have been sure of us. We had a little sight of them, by 
the light of the moon, as they stood pelting us from the shore with 
darts and arrows ; and, having got ready our fire-arms, we gave them a 
volley. We could hear by their cries, that we had wounded several ; 
however, they stood thus in battle array on the shore till break of day, 
while we could not tell how to weigh our anchor, or set up our sail, 
because we must needs stand up in the boat, where we were sure to be 
hit ; we made signals of distress to the ship, which rode a full league 
of^ yet my nephew, the captain, hearing our firing, and perceiving by 
the glasses the posture we lay in, pretty well understood our positions, 
and weighing anchor with dl speed, he stood as near the shore as he

durst with the etilp, and then sent another hoat, with ten 
to our usaistance, and one of the men, taking the end of a tow-line in 
his hand, and keeping our boat between him and the enemy, so that 
they could not perfectly see him, swam on board nsj and made the line 
^t to the boat; upon whieh we slipt oui- little cable, leaving onr 
anchor behiiid ; they eoon towed ua out of reach of the arrows j we 
all the while lying close behind the barricade we had mada 

Ah soon as we could get from between the ship and the shore, she 
laid her broadside to it^ and run aloi^ just by thcmj pouring in a broad- 
side loaded with pieces of iron and lead, small bullets and such like 
stuff, besides the great shot, wMeb made a terrible ha?oe among them. 

When we got on board, and were fairly out of danger, we had time 
to examine into the oecasion of this fmy i it came out, that an old 
woman, who had come to sell ns some milk, brought a young woman 
with her, who also brought some roots or herbs ; and while the old 
woman was seUiiig mb the milk, one of our men offered some rudeness 
to the younger one ; at which the old woman made a great noise. The 
seaman would not quit his prizie, but carried her out of her sight, among 
the tTeee, it being almost dark; and now the old woman made an 
outcry among the people she eame &:)m ; who attacked na as we haTo 
seen ] and it was great odds that we had not all been destroyed. 

One of our men was killed with a lance that was thrown at him, just 
at the beginning of the attack, as he sallied out of the tent they had set 
up ; the rest eame off fwe, all but the fellow who was the occasion of 
the mischief, who paid dear enough for his black mistress, for we didn't 
hear what became of bim for a great whiLa We lay upon the shore 
for two days though the wind was fair, and made signals for him ; our 
boat saOed up and down shore, for several leagues, but in vain i so we 
were obliged to give him over ; and if he alone had suffered, the loea 
had been the less. 

I could not feel satisfied myself however, without vetttming on shore 
once more, to tiy if I could learn anything of him ; it was the third 
night aft^T the action before I ventured^ and T was c^ireful to do it in 
the dark, lest we should be attacked again; but I ought indeed to have 
been sure, that the men I went with had been under my command, 
before I engaged in a thing so hazardous and mischievous. We started 
twenty stout fellows with us as any in the ship, besides the supercargo 
and myself ; and we landed two hours before midnight, at the same 
place where the natives stood drawn up the evening before. My design 
was to surprise one or two of them, perhaps we might get our man 
again, by way of exchange. 



I 



of Robinson Crusoe, 293 

We landed without noise, and divided the men into two bodies, 
whereof the boatswain commanded one, and I the other. We neither 
saw nor heard anybody stir when we landed ; and marched up one body 
at a distance from the other, to the place, but at first could see nothing, 
it being very dark ; by and by, however, our boatswain, that led the 
first party, stumbled and fell over a dead body. This made them halt 
for my coming up here ; when the moon began to rise, we could 
easily discern the havoc we had made among them. We told two-and- 
thirly bodies upon the ground, whereof two were not quite dead. 
Some had an arm, and some a leg, shot off; and one his head. Those 
that were slightly wounded, we supposed they had carried away. 

When we had made, as I thought, a full discovery of all we could 
come at, I was i^esolved on going on board ; but the boatswain and his 
party sent me word, that they were resolved to make a visit to the 
Indian town, where these dogs, as they called them, dwelt, and asked 
me to go along with them ; and if they could find them as still they 
fimcied they should, they did not doubt getting a good booty ; and it 
might be, they might find Tom Jeffiy there. 

Had they sent to ask my leave to go, I knew weU enough what 
answer to have given them ; for I should have commanded them 
instantly on board ; but as they sent me word they were resolved to 
go, and only asked me and my company to go along with them, I posi- 
tively refused it, and rose up in order to go back to the boat. One or 
two of the men began to importune me to go ; and, when I refiised 
positively, began to grumble, and say they were not under my com- 
mand, and they would go. ** Come, Jack," says one of the men, " will 
you go with me? I will go for one." Jack said he would; and 
another followed ; and then another ; and, in a word, they all left me 
but one, who was persuaded to stay : so the supercargo and I, with the 
third man, went back to the boat, where we told them, we would stay 
for them, and take in as many of them as should be left ; for I told 
them, it was a mad thing they were going about^ and supposed most of 
them would run the fate of Tom Jeffry. 

Well, they all went away, and though the attempt was desperate, and 
such as none but madmen would have gone about, yet, to give them 
their due, they went about it as warily as boldly. They went on a little 
way, and found a cow tied to a tree ; this they presently concluded 
would be a good guide to them. In a word, the cow led them directly 
to the town, which, as they report, consisted of above two hundred 
houses, or huts ; and in some of these they found several families living 
tc^ther. Here they found all in silence, as profound as sleep, and a 



294 



The lAfo and Adventures 



country that liad never seen an enemy, could make them. While they 
were holding counsel what course to take, three of them, that were a 
little before the rest, called out edoud, that they had found Tom. Jeffiy ; 
they all ran up to the place, and so it was indeed, for there they found 
the poor fellow, hanged up naked by one arm, and his throat cut 
The sight of their poor mangled comrade so enraged them, that they 
swore to one another, that not an Indian that came into Iheir hands 
should have quarter ; and to work they went immediately. Their 
first care was to get something that would soon take fire. As soon 
as the fire began to blaze, the poor frighted creatures rushed out 
to save their lives ; but met with their fSate in the attempt, and 
especially at the door, where they drove them back, the boatswain 
himseK killing one or two with his pole-axe. The house being large, and 
many in it, he did not care to go in, but called for a hand-grenade, and 
threw it among them, which at first frighted them ; but when it bursty 
made such havoc among them, that they cried out in a hideous manner. 

In short, most of the principal natives who were in the open part of 
the house were killed or hurt with the grenade, two or three more, who 
pressed to the door, which the boatswain and two more kept^ with the 
bayonets in the muzzles of their pieces, were despatched in that way. 




But there was another apartment in the house, where the prince, or 
king, and several others, were, and these they kept in, till the house, 
which was by this time a mass of flame, fell in upon them, and they 
were smothered, or burnt together. 

All this while they fired not a gun, because they would not waken 
the people faster than they could master them ; but the fire now began 



of Rohinson Crusoe. 295 

to waken tliem &st enough, so that our fellows were glad to keep 
together ; for the fire grew so raging, all the houses being made of light 
combustible stuf^ that they could hardly bear the street between them ; 
and their business was to follow the fire for the surer execution. As 
fast as the fire forced the people out of the burning houses, our people 
were ready at their doors to knock them on the head, still calling and 
hallooing to one another to remember Tom Jeffrys. 

While this was doing, I was very uneasy, and especially when I saw 
the flames of the town, which, it being night, seemed to be close by. 
My nephew too, who was roused by his men, seeing such a fire, and 
not knowing what exigence we might be in, he takes another boat, and 
with thirteen more men, comes himself on shore to me. Finding how 
matters stood, he determined to go to the assistance of his men, only 
regretting he had left so many men in the ship ; for he could not think 
of having his men lost for want of help. And away he went I^or 
was I more able to stay behind. The captain ordered two men to row 
back in the pinnace, and fetch twelve men more, leaving the long-boat 
at anchor ; six of the men now sent for, were to keep the two boats, 
and six more come afber us ; which left only sixteen men in the ship ; 
for the whole ship's company were now brought into this mischief 

The first object we met with was the ruins of a hut or house, or rather 
the ashes of it, for the house was consumed ; and just before it lay 
four men and three women killed. In short, there were instances of 
rage altogether barbarous, and of a fury something more than human : 
we thought it impossible our men could have been guilty of it My 
very soul shrunk within me, and my blood ran chill in my veins 
when I saw this ; however, we took means to let the poor creatures 
know that we would not hurt them, and they came to us with piteous 
lamentation to save them, and crept all together in a huddle, dose 
behind us, as for protection. I left my men drawn up together, and 
charged them to hurt nobody, but, if possible, to get at .some of our 
people, and see what devil it was possessed them, and what they in- 
tended to do ; and, in a word, to command them off j assuring them, 
that if they stayed till daylight, they would have a hundred thousand 
men about their ears. While I was issuing my orders to the men, 
four of them made their appearance, with the boatswain at their 
head, roving over the heaps of bodies they had killed, all covered 
with blood and dust, and looking for more people to massacre ; our 
men hallooed to them, and with much ado, one of them made them 
hear. As soon as the boatswain saw us, he set up a shout of 
triumph, " Captain," says he, " noble captain, I am glad you are come; 



2D6 The Life and Adventures ^^^^^^^M 

we have not half done yet ; the villanous hell-hotmd dogs I I will kill 
as maDy of them m poor Tom had hairs \ipon hia^ head ; we have sworn 
to ejmre none of them ; w© will root out tiie very nation of them from 
the earth : '^ and thus he ran on, out of breath too wi& aotion, and 
would not give me leave to apeak a word. 

At last, mising my voice that I might silence him a little, " Bar- 
haroua dogl what are you doing ^ I wlU not have one creature 
more touched upon pain of death. I charge you^ upon your life, to 
fitop your hands^ and stand still there, or you are a dead man." 

" Why, sir,'' says he, " do you know what they haTe done 1 If you 
want a reason for what we have done, come hither;" and with that he 
showed me the poor fellow hanging upon a tree, with his throat cut. 

I confess I was tilled on then myself, and when the men I carried 
with me saw the eigh^ I had much to do to restrain them; nay, my 
nephew himself fell in with them, and told me, in their hearing, that 
he was only fearful of the men being overpowered Upon these wordsi 
away ran eight of mj men with the boatswain and his crew, to com.- 
plete their bloody work. It was quite out of my power to restrain them, 
and I came away pensive and sad ; for I could not bear the sights touch 
less the horrible noise and cries of the poor wretches that fell into 
theu* hands. 

By the time the men got to the shot© again with the pinnace, ooi 
men began to appear ; they came dropping in, not in two bodies, and 
in form, as they wGnt^ but aU in small knots, straggling bore and there 
in such a manner, that a small force of resolute men might haye cut 
them all off. But the dread of them was upon the whole conntiy. 
The next day we set sail; so we never heard any more of it One 
would think this should have been enough to have warned us against 
going on shore again among heathens and barbarians ; but it is impos- 
sible to make mankind wise, except at their own expense; and l^fiir 
experience seems to be always of most use to them, when it is deazest 
bought, and most valued when it comes too late. 

We were now bound to the guK of Persia, and from thence to the 
coast of Goromandel, only to touch at Surat; but the chief of the super- 
cargo's trading lay at the bay of Bengal, where if he missed of his market, 
he was to go on to China, and return to this coast as he came home. 

The first disaster that befel us was in the gulf of Persia, where five 
of our men, venturing on shore on the Arabian side of the guli^ were 
surrounded by the Arabians, and either all killed, or carried away into 
slavery ; the rest of the boat's crew not being able to rescue them, and 
had but just time to get off themselves. I began to upbraid them with 



I 



of Bobinaon Crusoe. 297 

the just retribution of Heaven in this case, but the boatswain very 
warmly told me he thought I went farther in my censures than I could 
show any warrant for; that none of those five men, who were now lost, 
were of the number of those who went on shore to the massacre of 
Madagascar (so I always called it, though our men could not bear the 
word massacre with any patience) : and, indeed, this last circumstance, 
as I have said, put me to silence for the present But my frequent 
preaching to them on this subject had worse consequences than I 
expected ; and the boatswain, who had been the head of the attempt, 
came up boldly to me one time, and told me, he found that I con- 
tinually brought that affair upon the stage; that I made unjust reflec- 
tions upon it, and had used the men very iU on that account, and 
himself in particular; that as I was but a passenger, and had no com- 
mand in the ship, or concern in the voyage, they were not obliged to 
bear it ; that they did not know but I might have some ill design in 
my head, and, perhaps, to call them to an account for it, when they 
came to England ; and that, therefore, unless I would resolve to have 
done with it, and also not to concern myself any farther with him, or 
any of his affairs, he would leave the ship; for he did not think it was 
safe to sail with me among them. 

I heard him patiently enough till he had done, and then told him, 
that I did confess that I had all along opposed the massacre of Mada- 
gascar, for such I would always call it ; and that I had on aU occasions 
spoken my mind freely about it, though not more upon him than any 
of the rest ; that as to my having no command in the ship, that was 
true, nor did I exercise any authority, I only took the liberty of speak- 
ing my mind in things which publicly concerned us all ; and what 
concern I had in the voyage, that was none of his business ; that I was 
a considerable owner of the ship, and in that claim I conceived I had 
a right to speak, even farther than I had yet done, and would not be 
accountable to him, or any one else; and began to be a little warm 
with him. He made but little reply to me at that time, and I thought 
that affair had been over, but I was mistaken. We were at this time 
on the road to Bengal ; and, being arrived there and wishing to see 
the place, I went on shore with the supercargo, to divert myself; and 
towards evening was preparing to go on board, when one of the men 
came to me, and told me, he would not have me trouble myself to come 
down to the boat, for they had orders not to carry me on board again. 
Any one may guess what a surprise I was in at so insolent a message ; 
and I asked the man who bade him deliver that errand to me 1 He 
told me the coxswain. I said no more to the fellow, but bade him let 



298 The L^ and Jdveniiirei 

them know he haddeliyeied his measago^ and that I had given him no 
answer to it. ^ 

I immediately went^ and fonnd oat the supeicaigo^ and tdd hini'the 
stoij^addingy what I presently foieaaw, namelji that theiewooMcedainly 
he a mutiny in the ship; and entreated him to go immediately on 
hoard the ship in an Indian hoal^ and acquaint the captain of it; but 
I might haye spared this intelligonce^ foi^ before I had spoken to him 
on flhorey the matter was efEected on board: the boatswain, the gnnner, 
the carpenter, and in a word, all the inferior officenf, as soon as I was 
gone off in the boat^ came up to the quarter-deck, and desired to speak 
with the captain; and there the boatswain, making a long harangue (for 
the fellow talked yeiy weU)^ and repeating all he had said to me, tdd 
the captain in few words, that as I was now gone peaceably on ahore^ 
they were loth to use any violence with me; which, if I had not gone 
on sbore^ they would otherwise have done, to oblige me to have gone. 
They, therefore^ thon^^tfit to tell him, that as th^ shipped themselves 
to serve in the ship under his command, they would perform it well 
and feithfolly; but if I would not quit the ship, or the captain oblige 
me to quit it, they would all leave the ship^ and sail no ferOier with 
him; and at that word all, he turned his fece about towards the maiii- 
mast^whichwas, it seems, liie signal agreed on between them; atwfaich 
ail the seamen being got together there, cried out, ** One and ali^ One 
and all!'' 

My nephew was a man of spirit, and of great presence of mind, and 
though he was surprised, you may be sure, at the thing, yet he told 
them calmly he would consider of the thing ; but that be could do 
nothing in it till he had spoken to me about it : he used some 
arguments with them, to show them the unreasonableness and injustice 
of the thing ; but it was all in vain ; they swore, and shook hands 
round, before his face, that they would go all on shore, unless he 
would engage to them, not to suffer me to come any more on board 
the ship. To bring this disagreeable subject to a conclusion, my 
nephew came on shore to me, and it was arranged that all my things 
and as much money as I wanted should be sent on shore, and that I 
should find my way to England as well as I might. 

I was now alone in the remotest part of the worid, as I think I may 
call it ; for I was near three thousand leagues, by sea, farther off horn 
England than I was at my island ; only, it is true, I might travel 
here by land, over the Great Mogul's country to Surat, might go from 
thence to Bassora by sea, up the gulf of Persia, and from thence 
might take the way of the caravans over the desert of Arabia to Aleppo 



of Bobinaon Crusoe. 299 

and Scanderoon ; from thence, by sea, again to Italy, and so overland 
th^gh Fiance. And this put together, might be at least a full diameter 
ofwe globe ; but, if it were to be measured, I suppose it would appear 
to lie a great deal more. 

I had another way before me, which was to wait for an English ship^ 
coming to Bengal from Achin, in the island of Sumatra, and get a 
passage on board them for England, but as I came hither without any 
concern with the English East India Company, so it would be difficult 
to go from hence without their licence, or by favour of the captains 
of the ships, or of the company's fectors ; and to all I was an utter 
stranger. 

Here I had the particular pleasure, speaking by contraries, to see 
the ship set sail without me; a treatment, I think, a man in my 
circumstances scarce ever met with before, except from pirates running 
away with the ship, and setting those that would not agree with their 
villany on shore : indeed, this was the next door to it, both ways. 
However, my nephew left me a companion, and a servant; the first 
was derk to the purser, who engaged to go with me ; and the other 
was his own servant. I took a lodging in the house of an English 
woman, where several merchants lodged, some French, two Italians, 
or rather Jews, and one Englishman. After a long stay here, and 
many proposals made for my return to England, but none falling 
out to my mind, the English merchant, with whom I had now 
contracted an intimate acquaintance, came to me one morning: 
" Countryman," says he, " I have a project to communicate to you, 
which may, for aught I know, suit with your wishes, when you 
shall have thoroughly considered it. Here we are posted, you by 
accident^ and I by my own choice, in a part of the world very re- 
mote from our own country ; but it is in a country where, by us who 
understand trade and business, a great deal of money is to be got : 
if you wiU put a thousand pound to my thousand pound, we will hire 
a ship here, the first we can get to our minds ; you shall be captain, 
I will be merchant, and we will go a trading voyage to China : for 
what should we stand stiU for ? The whole world is in motion, rolling 
round and round ; all the creatures of God, heavenly bodies and earthly, 
are busy and diligent : why should we be idle ? There are no drones 
in the world but men : why should we be of that number 1" 

I liked his proposal very well ; and the more so, because it seemed 
to be expressed with so much good-will, and in so friendly a manner. 
I will not say, but that I might, by my loose and unhinged circum- 
stances, be the fitter to embrace a proposal for trade, or, indeed, for

However, I mightj pijriiflpSj sajj with some truth, that if trade was not 
my element^ rambling was ; and no proposal for Beeiiig any part of the 
world which I had never seen before^ could posaihly come amiss to 
me. It was^ howeverp some time before we could get a ship to ouj* 
minds; and when we got a vessel, it was not easy to get English 
aailora ; that is to say, so many as were necessary to govern the voyage, 
ajad manage the aailoTs which we should pick up* After some time 
we got a mate, a boatswain, and a gunner, English ; a Dutch carpenl^er, 
and three Portuguese foremast men ; with these, we found we could 
do well enough, having Indian seamen, such as they are, to make up. 
We made the voyage to Achin, in the island of Sumatra, and from thence 
to Siam, where we exchanged somo of our wares for opi^im, and some 
arnick ; the firs^ a commodity which bears a great piice among the 
Chinese, and which, at that time, was very much wanted there ; in a 
word, we went up to Chushan ; made a very great voyage ; were eight 
months out ; and returned to Bengal ; and I was very well satisfied 
with my adventure^ and got so much money by it^ and such an insight 
into the method of getting more, thatj had I been twenty years 
younger, I should have been tempted to have stayed here, and sought 
no ferther for making my fortuna 

But I had a kind of impatience upon me to he nearer home, and yet 
the most unsettled resolution imaginable which way to go. In the 
interval of these consultations, my ixiend, who was always npon tlie 
search for busiuess, proposed another voyage to me, among the Spice 
Islands ; and to bring home a loading of cloves from the Manilksy or 
thereabouts; places where, indeed, the Dutch do trade, but islands 
belonging partly to the Spaniards ; though we went not so fur, bnt to 
some other, where they have not the whole power as they have at 
Batavia. 

But to be short with my speculations, I most here refer to one that 
brought us into great trouble. A little while after this, there came in 
a Dutch ship &om Batavia ; she was a coaster, not an European trader, 
and of about two hundred ton burden : the men, as they pretended^ 
having been so sickly, that the captain had not men enough to go to 
sea with, he lay by at Bengal ; and, having got money enough, or being 
willing, for other reasons, to go to Europe, he gave public notice, that 
he would sell his ship : this came to my ears and I had a great mind 
to buy it. So I goes home to my partner, and told him of it : he consi- 
dered awhile, for he was no rash man neither ; but musing some time^ 
he replied, " She is a little too big ; but, however, we will have her." 



of BMnson Crusoe, 301 

Accordingly we bought the ship ; and, agreeing with the master, we 
paid for her, and took possession ; when we had done so, w:e resolved 
to induce the men, if we could, to join her with those we had, for the 
pursuing our business; but on a sudden, they having received no 
wages, not one of them was to be found. We inquired much about 
them, and at length were told, that they were all gone together, by land, 
to Agra, the great city of the Mogul's residence ; and from thence were 
to travel to Surat, and so by sea to the gulf of Persia. The very 
ground over which I wanted to go myself and nothing had so heartily 
troubled me a good while, as that I missed the opportunity of going 
with them ; but I was much better satisfied a few days after, when I 
came to know what sort of fellows they were ; for, in short, their 
history was, that this man they called captain was the gunner only, not 
the commander ; that they had been a trading voyage, in which they 
were attacked on shore by some of the Makccans, who had killed the 
captain and three of his men ; and that after the captain was killed, 
these men, eleven in number, had resolved to run away with the ship, 
which they did ; and had brought her in at the bay of Bengal, leaving 
the mate and five men more on shore j of whom we shall hear &rther. 




Well ; let them come by the ship how they would, we came honestly 
by her, as we thought ; though we did not, I confess, examine into 
things so exactly as we ought 

But having picked up some more English seamen here after this 
and some Dutch, we now resolved for a second voyage to the south-

easty for doves, Ssc ; that is to say, among the Fhilippme and Molnocift 
idea. 

In this Toyage, being by contiaiy ^dnds obliged to beat up and down 
a great while in the straitB of Malacca^ and among the ialanda, we were 
no sooner got dear of those difficult seaa^ bat we found onr ship bad 
sprang a leak, and we were not able, by all oar indostiy, to find oat 
where it waa This farced as to make for some port ; and my peitner, 
who knew the ooantcy better than I did, directed tiie captain to pat 
into the river of Cambodia ; for I had made the English mate, one Mir. 
Thompson, captain, not being willing to take the charge of the ship 
aponmyselfl 

While we were here, and going often on shore for reficeshment^ 
there comes to me one day an Englishman, and he waa^ it seems, a 
gunner's mate on board an English East India ship, which rode in tiie 
same riyer, up at or near the dty of Cambodia What brought him 
hither we knew not at the time ; bathe comes up to me, and, speaking 
English, ''Bir,'' says he, '' you are a stranger to me, and I to you; but 
I have something to tell you, that very nearly concerns you." 

I looked steadily at him a good while, and thought at jfirst I had 
known him, but I did not " K it very nearly concerns me,** said I, 
" and not yourself, what moves yoa to tell it me 1" " I am moved,'* 
says he, '' by the imminent danger you are in ; and, for aught I see^ 
you have no knowledge of it" " I know no danger I am in," said I, 
" but that my ship is leaky, and I cannot find the leak out ; but I 
purpose to lay her aground to-morrow, to see if I can find it.'* ** But, 
sir," says he, " leaky or not leaky, find it or not find it, you will be 
wiser than to lay your ship on shore to-morrow, when you hear what 
I have to say to you. Do you know, sir," said he, "the town of 
Cambodia lies about fifteen leagues up this river 1 And there are two 
large English ships about five leagues on this side, and three Dutch." 
« Well," said I, " and what is that to me 1 " « Why, sir," says he, " is 
it for a man that is upon such adventures as you are, to come into a 
port, and not examine first what ships there are there, and whether he 
is able to deal with them? I suppose you do not think you are a 
match for them ? " I was amused very much at his discourse, but not 
amazed at it ; for I could not conceive what he meant ; and I turned 
short upon him, and said, '* Sir, I wish you would explain yourself ; I 
cannot imagine what reason I have to be afraid of any Company's ships, 
or Dutch ships; I am no interloper; what can they have to say 
tome?" 

He looked like a man half angry, half pleased ; and, pausing awhile.

but smiling, " Well, sir," says he, " if you think yourself secure, you 
must take your chance ; I am sorry your fate should blind you against 
good advice ; but assure yourself^ if you do not put to sea immediately, 
you will the very next tide be attacked by five long-boats full of men ; 
and, perhaps, if you are taken, you will be hanged for a pirate, and the 
particulars be examined afterwards. I thought, sir,'' added he, " I 
should have met with a better reception than this, for doing you a piece 
of service of- such importance.'' " I can never be ungrateful," said I, 
" for any service, or to any man that offers me any kindness ; but it is 
past my comprehension what they should have such a design upon me 
for. However, since you say there is no time to be lost, and that there 
is some villanous design in hand against me, I wiU go on board this 
minute, and put to sea immediately, if my men can stop the leak, or if 
we can swim without stopping it. But, sir," said I, ** shall I go away 
ignorant of the reason of all this 1 Can you give me no further light 
into it?" 

" I can tell you part of the story, sir," says he ; " but I have a Dutch 
seaman here with me, and, I believe, I could persuade him to tell you 
the rest ; but there is scarce time for it. But the short of the story is 
this, the first part of which, I suppose, you know well enough, namely, 
that you was with this ship at Sumatra ; that there your captain was 
murdered by the Malaccans, with three of his men ; and that you, or 
some of those that were on board with you, ran away with the ship, 
and are since turned pirates. This is the sum of the stoiy, and you 
will all be seized as pirates, I can assure you; and executed with very 
little ceremony ; for you know merchants' men show but little law to 
pirates, if they get them into their power." 

" Now you speak plain English," said I, " and I thank you ; and, 
though I know nothing that we have done to deserve the character we 
seem to have, but came honestly and fairly by the ship ; yet hearing 
what you say, and that you seem to mean honestly, I will be upon my 
guard." " ITay, sir," says he, " do not talk of being upon your guard ; 
the best defence is to be out of the danger ; if you have any regard to 
your life, and the lives of your men, put out to sea without fail at high- 
water ; and as you have a whole tide before you, you will be too far 
out before they can come down ; for they only came away at high- 
water j and as they have twenty miles to come, you get near two hours 
of them by the difference of the tide, not reckoning the length of the 
way ; besides, as they are only in boats, they will not venture to follow 
you far out to sea, especially if it blows." 

" Well," says I, " you have been veiy kind in this : what shall I do 



804 H^ Lifi and Adventures 

for yoa to make you vnendat'' ** 8b" says he, ^yoamay not be so 
williiig to make me any amen<^l^ because you may not be oonyinoed of 
the truth of it : I will make an offer to you ; I have nineteen months* 

pay due to me on board the ship , in which I came out £ram 

England ; and the Dutchman, that is witih me^ Las seven months' pay 
doe to him; if you will make good our pay to us, we will go alongwillL 
yon. If you find nothing more in it^ we wiU desire no more ; but if 
we convince you, that we have saved your lives, and the ship^ and the 
lives of all the men in her, we wiU leave the rest to yon.'' 

I consented readily to thicf^ and went immediately on board, and the 
two men with me. As soon as I came to the ship's side, my partner, 
who was on board, came on the quaiter-deck, and called to me with 
great joy, singing out^ ^ We have stopped the leak ! we haye stopped 
the leakl" ''Say you so)" said I; ''thank God; but weigh the anchor 
then immediately." "Weighl" says he^ "what do you mean by 
that) What is the matter)" " Ask no questions," says I, "but all 
hands up anchor without losing a minute." He was surprised; but 
called the captain, and lie immediately ordered the anchor to be got up; 
and a little land-breeze blowing, we stood out to sea; then I called bim 
into the cabin, and told him the story at large ; and we called in the 
men, and they told us the rest of it ; but as it took us up a great deal 
of time before we had done^ a seaman comes to the cabin-door, and calls 
out to us, that the captain bade him tell us, we were cliased. " Chased !" 
said I, " by whom, and by what f ' " By five sloops, or boats," says the 
fellow, "full of men." "Very well," said I ; "then there is something 
in it" I now ordered all the men to be mustered, and told them 
briefly that there was a design to seize the ship, and to take us for 
pirates; and asked them, if they would stand by us, and by one 
another 1 The men answered, cheerfully, that one and all, they would 
live and die with us. Then I asked the captain what way he thought 
best for us to manage a fight with them ; for resist them I was resolved 
we would, and that to the last drop. He said, readily, that the way 
was to keep them off with our great shot as long as we could, and then 
to fire at them with oar small arms, as long as we could ; if they were 
too strong for us, then we should retire to our close quarters ; perhaps 
they had not materials to break open our bulk-heads, or get in upon us. 

The gunner had, in the mean time, trained two guns to bear fore and 
aft, out of the steerage, to clear the deck, and loaded them with musket- 
bullets, and small pieces of old iron, and whatever came to hand ; and 
thus we made ready for fight ; but all the while keeping out to sea. 
We could see, at a distance, five large long boats following us, with aU 



of Bobinson Crusoe. 305 

the sail they could make. Two we could see, by our glasses, which 
were English, out-sailed the rest, and were nearly two leagues a-head 
of the others, and gained upon us considerably, and likely to come up 
with us. We fired a gun therefore without a shot, to intimate that 
they should bring to ; and we put out a flag of truce as a signal for 
parley ; but they kept crowding after us, till they came within shot. 
Upon this we took in our white flag, they having made no answer to it, 
hung out the red flag, and fired at them with a shot. Notwithstanding 
this, they came on till we could call to them with a speaking trumpet, 
ordering them to keep off at their periL They still crowded after us, 
and endeavoured to come under our stem, so to board us on our quarter. 
Seeing them resolute for mischief, I ordered the ship to bring to, so 
that they lay upon our broadside, when we fired five guns at them ; one 
of them had been levelled so truly as to cai*ry away the stem of the 
hindermost boat, and compel them to take down their sail, all running 
to the head of the boat to keep her from sinking ; she lay by, having 
had enough of it ; but the foremost boat still crowding after us, we made 
ready to receive her. 

While this was going on, another of the three boats made up to the 
boat which we had disabled, to relieve her ; and we could afterwards 
see her take out the men. We called again to the foremost boat, and 
asked her business with us, but had no answer ; only she crowded close 
under our stem. Upon this our gunner, a dexterous fellow, run out 
his two chase guns, and again fired at her ; but the shot missing, the 
men in the boat shouted, waved their caps, and came on ; getting 
quickly ready again, the gunner fired among them the second time ; 
one shot fell among the men, and as we could easily see, had done a 
great deal of mischief; taking no notice of that we weared the ship 
again, and brought our quarter to bear upon them ; and, firing three 
more guns, the boat was split almost to pieces, her rudder, and a piece 
of her stem, shot away ; so they handed their sail immediately, and were 
in great disorder. Our gunner let fly two more guns at them again ; 
where he hit them we could not see, but seeing the boat was sinking, 
and some of the men already in the water, I manned the pinnace, 
which was kept close by our side, with orders to pick up as many as 
they could before the boats came up. Three men were picked up, one 
of whom was just drowning, and it was a good while before we could 
recover him. As soon as they were on board we crowded all the sail, 
and stood farther out to sea. When the other three boats came up to 
the first two, they gave over their chase. 

Being thus delivered from a great danger, we changed our course, so 

X 



306 The Life and Adventures 

as to conceal whither we were going ; so we stood out to sea eastward, 
quite out of the course of all European ships, whether they were 
bound to China, or anywhere else, within the commerce of the Euro- 
pean nations. 

When at sea we learnt from the two seamen the meaning of all that 
had passed j we found also that we had the credit of being a set of 
pirates who had already taken an English and two Dutch ships very 
richly laden. This was a report which required immediate refutation ; 
this could only be done by returning at once to Bengal, from whence 
we came, without putting in at any port whatever ; there we could 
give account of ourselves, could prove where we were when the ship 
pi^t in, who we bought her of, and the like ; we should be sure to 
have some justice, and not be hanged first and judged afterwards. But 
then came the consideration that we were on the wrong side of the 
straits of Malacca; and that if the alarm were given, we should be 
waylaid by the Dutch of Batavia as well as the English elsewhere ; 
that if we should be taken, as it were, running away, we should even 
condemn ourselves, and there would want no more evidence to 
destroy us. 

This danger a little startled my partner, and it was resolved to go 
away to the coast of Tonquin, and so on to the coast of China ; and 
pursuing the first design, as to trade, find some way or other to dispose 
of the ship, and come back in some of the vessels of the country. 
Accordingly we steered away N.N.E. keeping above fifty leagues off 
from the usual course to the eastward. My partner, who was well 
acquainted with the coast, was to put into some port on the coast of 
Cochin-chiua, or the bay of Tonquiri ; intending to go afterwards to 
Macao, a town once in the possession of the Portuguese, and where 
stiQ a great many European families resided, particularly the mis- 
sionary priests who usually went thither, in order to their going for- 
ward to China. And accordingly, though after a tedious and irregular 
course, and very much straitened for provisions, we came within sight 
of the coast very early one morning. Upon reflection we resolved to 
put into a small river, which, however, had depth enough of water for 
us, and to see if we could, either overland or by the ship's pinnace, 
come to know what ships were in the port thereabouts. This happy 
step was, indeed, our deliverance ; for, though we did not immediately 
see any European ships in the bay, yet the next morning there came 
two Dutch ships, and a third without colours, which we believed to be 
a Dutchman, also passed by at about two leagues* distance, steering for 
the coast of China ; and in the afternoon two English ships passed, 



of RoUnson Crusoe. 807 

steering the same course. The place we were in was wild and bar- 
barous, the people thieves, even by occupation or profession. Never- 
theless, as our ship had never quite recovered her trim after the leak 
which we succeeded in stopping so fortunately, we resolved, while we 
were in this place, to lay her on shore, take out what heavy things we 
had on board, which were not many, and to wash and clean her bottom, 
and if possible, to find out where the leaks were. Accordingly, having 
lightened the ship, and brought all our guns, and other moveable 
things, to one side, we tried to bring her down, that we might come at 
her bottom ; but, on second thoughts, we did not care to lay her dry 
on ground, neither could we find out a proper place for it The in- 
habitants, seeing the ship down on one side in such a manner, and 
heeling towards the shore, and not seeing our men, who were at work 
on her bottom, with stages, and with their boats on the off side, they 
presently concluded that the ship was cast away. 

On this supposition they came all about us in two or three hours' 
time, with ten or twelve large boats, having some of them eight, some 
ten men in a boat, intending, no doubt, to have come on board and 
plundered the ship ; and if they found us there, to have carried us 
away for slaves. When they came to the ship, however, and began to 
row round her, they discovered us all hard at work on the outside of 
the ship's bottom and side, washing and graving, and stopping, as 
every seafaring man knows how. They stood for a while gazing at us, 
and we, who were a little surprised, could not imagine what their 
design was ; but being willing to be sure, we sent some of the hands 
into the ship, to hand down arms and ammunition to those that were 
at work to defend themselves with, if there should be occasion ; and 
it was no more than need ; for they agreed, it seems, that the ship 
was really a wreck ; that we were all at work, endeavouring to save 
her, or to save our lives by the help of our boats; and when we 
handed our arms into the boats, they concluded, by that motion, that 
we were endeavouring to save some of our goods. Upon this they 
came down upon us, as if it had been in a line of battle. Our men, 
seeing so many of them, were frighted at first ; for we lay in a bad 
posture to fight, but I called to the men who worked upon the stages, 
to slip down, and get up the side into the ship ; and those in the boats 
I ordered to row round and come on board, while the few of us who 
were on board worked with all the strength we had, to bring the ship to 
rights ; but neither the men upon the stage nor those in the boats could 
do as they were ordered, before the enemy were upon them. Two of 
their boats boarded our long-boat, and attempted to lay hold of the men.

the lK>At'e gumiel that the fellow died in his hands. In the mean time, 
• Dutchman, viho stood next, took up the musket, and with the butt-

But this %Taa doing little towards resisting thirty or forty men, who, 
fmth&BBf because ignorant of their danger, began to throw ihemjselvea 
into the long-boat, where we had but five men to defend it ; but an 
lUHddeat gave our men a complete victory, which, deserved our laughter 
Ifttber than anything else ; and that was tlm 

The carpenter was preparing to grave the outside of the ship, and 
pay the seams whei*e he had caulked her, to stop the leaksj and had 




two kettles, one hlled with boiling pitch, and the other with rosin, 
tallow, and oil, just ready to let down into the boat ; and the carpen- 
ter's assistant had a great iron ladle in his hand, with which he supplied 
the men that were at work with the stuff. Two of the enemy's men 
entered the boat just where this fellow stood, being in the fore-sheets ; 
he immediately saluted them with a ladlefiil of the stuff, boiling hot> 
which, being half naked, so burnt and scalded them that they roared 
out like two bulls, and leaped both into the sea. The carpenter saw 
the result with great satisfaction, and cried out, " Well done. Jack, 



of Robinson Crusoe. 309 

give them some more of it ; " and stepping forward himself, takes a 
mop, and dipping it into the pitch-pot, he threw it among them so 
plentifully, that they were scalded and burnt in a most frightful 
manner, and made such a howling as never was heard before ; for it is 
worth observing that though pain naturally makes all people cry out, 
yet every nation has a particular mode of exclamation, and makes 
noises as different from one another as is their speech. The noise these 
creatures made was howling, for I never heard anything more like the 
noise of the wolves which I heard in the forest of Languedoc. 

I was never better pleased with a victory, for we obtained it almost 
without bloodshed; our danger was imminent; but I was sick of 
killing these poor wretches, even in my own defence, for they knew no 
better, and in attacking us followed their instincts ; and I thought it 
was a sad life, which could only be preserved by killing our fellow- 
creatures. While this was doing, we had with great dexterity brought 
the ship almost to rights ; and, having shipped the guns again, the 
gunner called to me, to bid our boat get out of the way, for he would 
let fly among them. I requested him not to fire, for the carpenter 
would do the work with the help of another pitch-kettle, which the cook 
was preparing. But the enemy had enough of it in their first attack, 
they would not come on again ; and seeing the ship afloat, as it were, 
and upright, begun to see their mistake, and gave over the enterprise. 
Thus we got clear of this merry fight ; and, having got some rice, and 
some roots and bread, with about sixteen good big hogs, on board, two 
days before, we resolved to stay here no longer, but go forward, whatever 
came of it, having no desire to ply our pitch-kettle in a second attack. 

We therefore got all our things on board the same evening, and the 
next day, having finished our work on board, and finding our ship was 
perfectly cured of her leaks, we set sail, keeping to the N.E. towards 
the isle of Formosa, where we came to an anchor, in order to get 
water and fresh provisions. From hence we sailed still north, keep- 
ing the coast of China, till we knew we were beyond all the ports, 
where European ships usually come. Being now in latitude of 
30**, we resolved to stand in for the shore ; a boat came off two 
leagues to us, with an old Portuguese pilot on board, who came 
to offer his service. We took him on board; upon which, with- 
out asking us whither we would go, he dismissed the boat. Think- 
ing that we might take the old man where we would, I began to 
talk with him about carrying us to the gulf of Nanquin, which 
he readily agreed to, and while we were still in discourse, the ship 
went forward, and, in about thirteen days* sail, came to anchor in 



310 



The Lifi and Adventures 



the south-west point of the great gulf of Nanquin. When we came 
on shore, the old pilot, who was now a firm friend, got us a lodging, 
. and also a warehouse for our goods ; he also hrought us acquainted 
with three missionary Eomish priests, who were in town, and who had 
heen there some time. One of these was a Frenchman, father Simon ; 
he was a jolly well-conditioned man, very free in his conversation, not 
seeming so serious and grave as the others, a Portuguese and a Grenoese ; 
but father Simon was courteous, easy in his manner, and very agreeable 
company; the other two were more reserved, seemed rigid and austere, 
and applied seriously to the work they came about. 




Father Simon was appointed to go up to Pekin, the royal seat of 
the Chinese emperor ; and waited only for another priest, who was 
ordered to come to him from Macao, to go along with him ; and we 
scarce ever met, without an urgent invitation to accompany him on his 
journey. He would show me all the glorious things of that mighty 
empire ; and among the rest, the greatest city in the world ; " a city," 
said he, " that your London, and our Paris, put together, cannot be 
equal to." This was the city of Pekin. Dining with him one day, 
and being very merry together, I showed some little inclination to go 
with him, and he pressed me and my partner very hard, and with a 
great many persuasions, to consent. " Why, father Simon," says my 
partner, " why should you desire our company so much ? You know 
we are heretics, and you do not love us, nor can you keep us company 
with any pleasure." "O !" says he, "you may, perhaps, be good catho- 
lics in time ; my business here is to convert heathens ; and who knows 
but I may convert you too 1 " " Very well, father," said I, " so you 



of Robinson Crusoe. 811 

will preach to us all the way." " I will not be troublesome to you," 
says he ; "our religion does not divest us of good manners;" besides, 
says he, " we are here like countrymen ; and so we are, compared to 
the place we are in ;" and if you are Huguenots, and I a Catholic, we 
may be all Christians at last; at least," said he, "we are all gentlemen, 
and we may converse so, without being uneasy to one another." In 
the meantime we had our ships and merchandize to dispose of; our 
old Portuguese pilot brought a Japan merchant to us, who bought all 
our opium, and gave us a very good price for it, paying us in gold by 
weight, some in small pieces of their own coin, and some in small 
wedges, of about ten or eleven ounces each. While we were dealing 
with him for our opium, it came into my head that he might, perhaps, 
deal with us for the ship too; and I ordered the interpreter to 
propose it to him. He shrunk up his shoulders at it, when it 
was first proposed to him ; but, in a few days after, he came to me, 
with one of the missionary priests for his interpreter, and told me, 
he had a proposal to make to me, it was this : He had bought a 
great quantity of goods of us when he had no thoughts of buying 
the ship ; and that, therefore, he had not money enough to pay for 
the ship ; but if I would let the same men who were in the ship 
navigate her, he would hire the ship to go to Japan, and would send 
them from thence to the Philippine islands with another loading, 
which he would pay the freight of, before they went from Japan ; and 
that, at their return from that voyage, he would buy the ship. I 
began to listen to this proposal ; and so eager did my head still run 
upon rambling, that I began to entertain a notion of going myself with 
him, and so to sail from the Philippine islands away to the South 
Seas ; and accordingly I asked the Japanese merchant, if he would not 
hire us to the Philippine islands, and discharge us there. He said, no, 
he could not do that ; for then he could not have the return of his 
cargo; but he would discharge us in Japan, he said, at the ship's 
return. Well, still I was for taking him at that proposal, and going 
myself; but my partner, wiser than I, persuaded me from it, represent- 
ing the dangers, as well of the seas as of the Japanese, who are a 
false, cruel, and treacherous people ; and then of the Spaniards at the 
Philippines ; more false, more cruel, and more treacherous than they. 
We were now on shore in China. In the meantime, we visited the 
city of Nanquin, a ten days* journey into the interior, and at a future 
period we accompanied father Simon to Pekin, which occupied us 
twenty-four days. The people we found haughty, imperious and in- 
solent, in the midst of the grossest simplicity and ignorance ; for all 



818 The Life and AdvmUuru 

their funed ingenxuty is no more. And my friend, fiiOier Simon, and 
I nsed to be yeiy rneny upon these occasions, to see the b^garly piide 
of these people : for example, coming by Uie house of a oonntiFy genHe- 
men, as &ther Simon called him, about ten leagues oft of the dty of 
Nanqmn, we had, first of all, the honour to ride wiiii the masteir of 
the house about two miles ; the state he rode in, being a strange 
mixtureof pomp and poverty. The habit of this greasy Don was yecy 
proper for a scaramouch, or merry-andrew, being a dirly calico^ with all 
the tawdry and trapping of a fool's coat^ such as hangiDg sleeve^ 
tassels, and cuts and slashes almost on cTery side ; it covered a taflBty 
Test^ as greasy as a butcher, and which testified, tiiat his honour must 
needs be a most exquisite sloven. 




His horse was a poor, lean, starved, hobbling creature, such as in 
England might sell for about thirty or forty shillings ; and he had two 
ftlaves following him on foot, to drive the poor creature along : he had 
a whip in his hand, and he belaboured the beast as fast about the head 
as his slaves did about the tail ; and thus he rode by us with about 
ten or twelve servants ; and we were told he was going from the dty 
to his coimtry seat, about half a league before us. We travelled on 
gently, but this figure of a gentleman rode away before us ; and as we 
stopped at a village about an hour to refresh us, when we came by the 
country seat of this great man, we saw him in a little place before his 
door, eating his repast ; it was a kind of a garden, but he was easy to 
be seen ; and we were given to understand, that the more we looked 
on him, the better he would be pleased. 

At length we arrived at Pekin : I had nobody with me but the 



of Robinson Crtisoe, 313 

youth, whom my nephew the captaiii had left to attend upon me as a 
servant, and who proved very trusty and diligent ; and my partner had 
nobody with him but one servant, who was a kinsman. As for the 
Portuguese pilots he being desirous to see the court, we bore his 
charges and used him as an interpreter, for he understood the language 
of the country, and spoke good French and a little English; and, 
indeed, this old man was most useful to us everywhere, for we had 
not been above a week at Pekin when he came to us laughing : " Ah, 
Seignior Inglese," says he, " I have something to tell you, will make 
your heart glad." " What can that be 1 " says I ; " I do not know 
anything in this country that can either give me joy or grief" " Yes, 
yes," said the old man in broken English, "make you glad, me sorrow;" 
sorry he would have said. This made me more inquisitive. *' Why," 
said I, " will it make you sorry ] " " Because," said he, " you have 
brought me here twenty-five days' journey, and wiU leave me to go 
back alone ; and which way shall I get to my port afterwards, without 
a ship, without a horse, without pecurie 1 " So he called money, in 
his broken Latin, of which he had abundance to make us merry 
withaL 

In short, he told us there was a great caravan of Muscovite and 
Polish merchants in the city, and they were preparing to journey, by 
land, to Muscovy, and he was sure we would take the opportunity to go 
with them. I confess I was surprised with tMs news ; a secret joy 
spread itself over my whole soul, which I cannot describe ; at last I 
turned to him — " How do you know this 1" said I. Says he, " I met 
this momiQg an old acquaintance of mine, an Armenian, or one you 
call a Greek, who is among them ; he came last from Astracan, and 
was designing to go to Tonquin, but has altered his mind, and is now 
resolved to go with the caravan to Moscow, and so down the river 
Wolga to Astracan. " Well, seignior," says I, " do not be uneasy 
about being left to go back alone ; if I return to England by this 
means it shall be your fault if you go back to Macao at alL" We then 
consulted together ; my partner told me he would do just as I would ; 
for he had settled all bis affairs so well at Bengal, and left his effects 
in such good hands, and had made so good a voyage here, if he could 
vest it in China silks, wrought and raw, such as might be worth the 
carriage, he would be content to go to England, and make his voyage 
back to Bengal by one of the company's ships. 

Having resolved upon this, we agreed, that if our Portugal pilot 
would go with us, we would not only bear his charges to Moscow, op 
to England, but we agreed to give him a quantity of coined gold for 



814 The Lifo and Adimtures 

his services, wbichy as I Gompate ii^ came to about 175 pounds starliiig 
between us. 

It was the beginning of Eebruaiy, our style, when we set out fixnn 
Pekin. I had bought ninety pieces of fine damasks, with about two 
hundred pieces of other vezj fine silks^ of seyeial sorts, some mixed 
with gold. Besides this we bought a veiy laige quantity of raw silk, 
and some other goods, which loaded in all eighteen camels for our 
share, besides those we rode upon ; which, with two or three spare 
horses, and two horses loaded with provisions, made ud, in short, twenty- 
six camels and horses in our retinue. The company was Yesty great, 
and as near as I can remember, made between three and four hundred 
horsey and upward of a hundred and twenty men, very well aimed, and 
provided for all events. For, as the eastern caravans are subject to be 
attacked by the Arabs, so are these by the Tartars. There were people 
of several nations, Muscovites chiefly ; for there were above sixty of 
them who were merchants or inhabitants of Moscow, though of them 
some were livonians ; and, to our particular satis&ction, five of them 
were Scots, who appeared also to be men of great experience, and 
of very good substance. 

When we had travelled one day's journey, the guides, who were ^Ye 
in number, called all the gentlemen and merchants to a great council, 
as they called it. At this great council every one deposited a certain 
quantity of money to a common stock, for the necessary expense of 
buying forage on the way, where it was not otherwise to be had, and 
for satisfying the guides, getting horses, and the like. And here they 
constituted the journey, as they called it, namely : they named cap- 
tains and officers to draw us all up, and give the command in case of 
an attack, and gave every one their turn, of command. 

In two days more we passed the great China wall, made for protection 
against the Tartars ; and a very great work it is, going over hilla and 
mountains where the rocks are impassable, and over precipices such as 
no enemy could possibly climb. They tell us its length is near a thou- 
sand English miles ; but that the country is five hundred, in a straight 
measured line, which the wall boimds, without measuring the windings 
and turnings it takes ; it is about four fathom high, and as many thick 
in some places. 

After we had passed this mighty nothing, called a wall, we began to 
find the country thinly inhabited, and the people living in fortified 
towns and cities, being subject to the inroads and depredations of 
the Tartars, who rove about in troops or hordes, keeping no order, and 
understanding no discipline ; their horses are poor, lean, starved 



of Robinaan Ciruaoe. 815 

creatures, taught nothing, and fit for nothing. Our leader for the day 
gave leave for ahout sixteen of us to go a hunting, as they call it ; and 
what was this but a hunting of sheep ! However, it may be called 
hunting, too ; for the creatures are the wildest and swiftest of foot that 
ever I saw of their kind ; only they will not run a great way, and you 
are sure of sport when you begin the chase ; for they appear generally 
thirty or forty in a flock, and, like true sheep, always keep together 
when they fly. 

In pursuit of this odd sort of game, it was our hap to meet with 
about forty Tartars. Whether they were hunting mutton as we were, 
or whether they looked for another kind of prey, I know not ; but as 
soon as they saw us one of them blew a kind of a horn very loud, but 
with a barbarous sound that I had never heard before ; and, by the way, 
never care to hear again. One of the Scots merchants of Moscow 
happened to be amongst us, and told us that we had nothing to do but 
to charge them immediately, without loss of time ; and drawing us up 
in a line, he asked if we were ready to follow him, and rode directly 
up to them. They stood gazing at us, but as soon as they saw us 
advance they let fly their arrows, which, however, missed us very 
happily. 

We halted, and fired, sending them leaden bullets for wooden arrows, 
following our shot full gallop, sword in hand; for so our bold Scot 
directed. He showed such vigour, bravery, and cool courage on this 
occasion, that I never saw any man in action fitter for command. As 
soon as we came up to them, we fired our pistols in their faces, and then 
drew ; but they fled in the greatest confusion imaginable ; the only 
stand any of them made was on our right, where three, having a kind 
of scimitar in their hands, and their bows hanging at their backs, 
by signs, called the rest to come back. Our brave commander gallops 
up close to them, and with his fusil knocks one of them off his horse, 
killed the second with his pistol, and the third ran away ; and thus 
ended our fight ; but all our mutton got away. We had not a man 
killed or hurt ; but, as for the Tartars, there were about five of them 
killed ; who were wounded, we knew not. 

We were all this while in the Chinese dominions, but in about five 
days we entered a vast great wild desert, which held us three days and 
nights* march ; and we were obliged to carry our water with us in great 
leather bottles, and to encamp all night. A kind of border that might 
be called No Man's Land ; being a part of the Great Karakathy, or 
Grand Tartary. 

We saw two or three times little parties of the Tartars, and once a 



316

party of them came so near as to stand and gaze at us, doubtful, 
apparently, whether to attack us or not We travelled near a month 
after this, the ways being not so good as at first, though still in the 
dominions of the Emperor of China ; but lay, for the most part, in 
villages, some of which were fortified, because of the incursions of the 
Tartars. 

At one of these towns, wishing to buy a camel, and having agreed 
for the price, I was coming away, when, on a sudden, came up five 
Tartars on horseback ; two of them seized the fellow leading the camel, 
while the other three stepped up to me and my old pilot; seeing us, as 
it were, unarmed, for I had no weapon about me but my sword, which 
could but ill defend me against three horsemen. The first that came up 
stopped short upon my drawing my sword ; but a second coming upon 
my left, gave me a blow on the head, which I never felt till afterwards, 
and wondered, when I came to myself, what was the matter with me, 
and where I was, for he laid me flat on the ground ; but my never- 




failing old pilot, the Portuguese, having a pistol in his pocket, and 
seeing me down, stepped up to the fellow that had struck me, and 
pulling him by main force a little towards him with the other, he shot 
him in the head, laying him dead on the spot ; he then stepped up to 
him who had stopped us. made a blow at him with his scimitar, but 
missing the man, cut his horse into the side of his head, cut one of his 
ears off by the root, and a great slice down the side of his face. The 
poor beast, enraged with the wound, was no more to be governed by his 
rider ; but away he flew, and carried him quite out of the pQot's reach ;

and at some distance, rising up upon bis hind legs, threw down the 
Tartar, and fell upon him. 

In this interval the poor Chinese seeing the Tartar down, and his 
horse fallen upon him, he runs to him, and seizing upon an ugly ill- 
favoured weapon he had by his side, something like a pole-axe, he 
wrenched it from him, and made shift to knock bis Tartarian brains out 
with it. But my old man had the third Tartar to deal with still ; he 
did not fly, nor did he come on to fight^ but stands stock still. The old 
man falls to work with his tackle to charge bis pistol ; but as soon as 
the Tartar saw the pistol away he scoured, and left my pilot, — ^my 
champion, as I called him afterward, a complete victor. 

By this victory we lost a camel and gained a horse. When we came 
back to the village the man demanded to be paid for the camel ; I 
disputed it, and it was brought to a hearing before the Chinese judge 
of the place. To give him his due, he acted with a great deal of pru- 
dence and impartiality ; and having heard both sidesj he gravely asked 
the Chinese man that went with me to buy the camel, whose servant 
he was % " I am no servant," says he, " but went with the stranger." 
" At whose request % " says the justice. " At the stranger's request," 
says he. "Why, then," said the justice, "you were the stranger's 
servant for the time, and the camel being delivered to his servant, it 
was delivered to him, and he must pay for it." I confess the thing 
was so clear, that I had not a word to say ; I paid willingly for the 
camel, and sent for another. 

We were now approaching the city of Naum, a frontier town of the Chi- 
nese empire ; they call it fortified, and so it is, as fortifications go there. 
We wanted above two days' journey of this city, when messengers 
arrived to tell all travellers and caravans to halt, till they had a guard 
sent for them ; for that an unusual body of Tartars, ten thousand in 
all, had appeared about thirty miles from the city. Accordingly, two 
days after, we had two hundred soldiers sent us from a garrison of 
the Chinese on our left, and three hundred more from the city of 
Naum, and with those we advanced boldly ; the three hundred soldiers 
from Naum marched in our front, the two hundred in our rear, and our 
men on each side of our camels with our baggage, and the whole 
caravan in the centre. Early one morning we marched from a little 
town called Changu, where we had to ferry across a river, beyond 
which we entered upon a desert of about fifteen or sixteen miles ; there, 
by the cloud of dust raised, we saw an enemy was at hand, and they 
were at hand, indeed, for they came on upon the spur.

destraction that we intended for it. It was too bulky to be carried away, 
80 we were at a loss again. " Well then," said tiie Scots merchant^ 
** I will tell you what we will do ; we will try to take them prisoners, 
tie their hands behind them, and make them stand still, and see their 
idol destroyed." 

We knocked gently, and seized them as they came out, and imme- 
diately tied them. The last of them stepping back, and ciying out, my 
Scots merchant went in after him, and taking out a composition we had 
made, that would only smoke and stink, he set fire to it, and threw it 
among them ; by that time the other Scotsman and my man taking 
charge of the two men who were already bound, and tied together also by 
the arm, led them away to the idol, and left them there. The fiize we had 
thrown in, soon filled the hut with so much smoke, that they were almost 
suffocated i we then threw in a small leather bag of another kind, which 
flamed like a candle, and, following it in, we found there were but four 




people left, two men and two women, engaged, as we supposed, about 
some of their diabolic sacrifices. They appeared, in short, frighted to 
death, at least so as to sit trembling and stupid, and not able to speak, 
neither, for the smoke. We bound them as we had the other, and all 
without any noise. When we had done this, and carried them all together 
to the idol, Ave fell to work, and first daubed it all over with tar, and 
such other stuff as we had, then we stopped his eyes, and ears, and 
mouth with gunpowder ; and wrapped up a great piece of wild-fire in 
his bonnet ; and then sticking all the combustibles we had brought 
with us upon him, we looked about to see if we could find anything

else to help to buin him ; when my m^n remembered, that by the tent, 
or hut^ where the men were, there lay a heap of dry forage, which he and 
one of the Scotsmen run and fetched their arms full o£ Kow we 
took all our prisoners, and brought them, having untied their feet and 
ungagged their mouths, and set them just before their monstrous idol, 
and then set fire to the whole. 

We stayed by it a quarter of an hour, or thereabouts, till the powder 
in the eyes, and mouth, and ears of the idol blew up, and, we could 
perceive, had split and deformed the shape ; and, in a word, till we 
saw it bum into a mere block or log of wood ; and then setting the 
dry forage to it^ we found it would be quite consumed ; when we began 
to think of going away ; but the Scotsman said, "No, we must not go; 
for these poor deluded wretches will all throw themselves into the fire, 
and bum themselves with the idoL" So we resolved to stay till the 
forage was burnt down too, and then we came away and left them. 

In the morning we appeared among our fellow travellers, exceeding 
busy in getting ready for our journey ; nor could any man suppose that 
we had been anywhere but in our beds. But it did not end so ; the 
next day came a great multitude of the countiy people, not only of this 
village, but of a hundred more, for aught I know, to the town gates ; 
and, in a most outrageous manner, demanded satisfeustion of the Eussian 
governor, for the insulting their priests, and burning their great Cham- 
Chi-Thaungu. 

The governor told them there was a caravan gone towards Russia 
that morning, and the caravan having a hint from the governor, 
marched two days and two nights without any considerable stop, 
fortunately taking the south side of the Lake Schanks Oscer, while 
the pursuers took the north. After journeying three days, they 
found their mistake, and came pouring in upon us, towards the dusk 
one evening. The enemy did not come on us like thieves, as we 
expected, but sent three messengers to demand the men to be delivered • 
to them, that had abused their priests. The leader of the caravan sent 
word that he was well assured it was not done by any of our camp ; 
that we were peaceable merchants, and we had done no harm to them, 
or to any one else; and that therefore they must look farther for their 
enemies. They were far from being satisfied with this for an answer; 
but a cunning fellow, a Cossack, in the pay of the Muscovites, relieved 
us from this great danger. Taking his bow and airows, and gettmg 
on horseback, he rides away from our rear back, taking a great circuit, 
iand coming to the army of the Tartars, as if he had been sent express 
after them, he tells them that the people who had burnt their Chamf

Chi-Thaungu were gone to Sibeilka^ a town four or five days to the 
sontli, with another caravan. In less than three hours they were 
entirely out of our sight, and we never heard any more of them, but 
passed safely on to the city of Jarawena. Erom this city we had a 
frightful desert, which held us three-and-twenty days' march. After 
we had passed this desert, we came into a country pretty well inhabited. 
After this we had to pass the nation of the Tongueses. Having passed 
through this country, and another desert of at least four hundred niileSy 
we came to Janezay, a Muscovite city or station, on the great river of that 
name, which, they told us, parted Europe from Asia. From this river to 
the great river Oby, we crossed a wild uncultivated country, whither 
the Muscovite criminals, that are not put to death, are banished. 

I have nothing material to say of my particular affairs, till I came 
to Tobolski, the capital city of Siberia, where I thought it much my 
better way to let the caravan go on, and to make provision to winter 
where I was, in the latitude of sixty degrees. TMs being the coiintry 
where the state criminals of Muscovy are all banished, this city was 
full of noblemen, princes, gentlemen, colonels, and, in short, all degrees 
of the nobility, gentry, soldiery, and courtiers of Muscovy. Here was 
the famous Prince Galitzen, the old general Robostisky, and several 
other persons of note, and some ladies. 

By means of my Scots merchant, who, nevertheless, I parted with 
here, I made an acquaintance with several of these gentlemen, and 
some of them of the first rank ; and from these, in the long winter 
nights, in wliich I stayed here, I received several very agreeable visits. 

Among others the Prince , one of the banished ministers of 

state belonging to the Czar of Muscovy. My measures being fixed, for 
Archangel, and not for Muscovy, or the Baltic, about the latter end of 
May, I began to pack up. Before leaving I sent my servant to the prince, 
with a small present of tea, and two pieces of China damask, and four 
little wedges of Japan gold, which did not all weigh above six ounces, 
or thereabout ; but were far short of the value of his sables, which, 
indeed, when I came to England, I found worth near two hundred 
pounds. He accepted the tea and one piece of the damask, and one of 
the pieces of gold, which had a fine stamp upon it, of the Japan 
coinage, which I found he took for the rarity of it, but would not take 
any more, and he sent word by my servant that he desired to speak 
with me. Thinking how easy it would have been to have taken any 
of these exiles with me, I had proposed to the prince to make his 
escape with me, engaging to put him on board an English or Dutch 
ship, which he had declined. 



of B6binj8<m Crusoe, $23 

When I came to him, he told me, I knew what had passed between 
us, and hoped I would not move him any more in that affair ; but that, 
since I had made such a generous offer to him, he asked me if I had 
kindness enough to offer the same to another person that he would 
name to me, in whom he took a great interest. I told him that I could 
not say I inclined to do so much for any one but himself, for whom I 
had a particular respect, and should have been glad to have been the 
instrument of his deliverance ; however, if he would please to name 
the person to me, I would give him my answer, and hoped he would 
not be displeased with me, if he was with my answer. He told me it 
was only his son, who, though I had not seen, was in the same condition 
with himself and above two hundred miles firom him, on the other side 
the Oby ; but that, if I consented, he would send for him. 

I made no hesitation, but told him I would do it I made some 
ceremony in letting him understand that it was wholly on his account j 
and that seeing I could not prevail on him, I would show my respect 
to him by my concern for his son ; but these things are too tedious to 
repeat here. He sent away the next day for his son, and in about 
twenty days he came back with the messenger, bringing six or seven 
horses loaded with very rich furs, and which, in the whole, amounted 
to a very great value. His servants brought the horses into the 
town, but left the young lord at a distance till night, when he came 
incognito into our apartment, and his father presented him to me ; and, 
in short, we concerted there the manner of our travelling, and every 
thing proper for the journey. 

It was the beginning of June when I left this remote place, a city, 
I believe, little heard of in the world ; and, indeed, it is so far out of 
the road of commerce, that I know not how it should be talked of. 
We now formed a v«ry small caravan, being only thirty-two horses and 
camels in all, and all of them passed for mine, though my new guest 
was proprietor of eleven of them. It was most natural, also, that I* 
should take more servants with me than I had before, and the young 
lord passed for my steward ; what great man I passed for myself I 
forget now. We had here the worst and the largest desert to pass 
over that we met with in all the journey j indeed I call it the worst, 
because the way was very deep in some places, and very uneven in 
others; the best we had to say for it, was, that we thought we 
had no troops of Tartars and robbers to fear, for they never came 
on this side the river Oby, or at least but very seldom ; but we found 
it otherwise. 

My young lord had with him a faithful Muscovite servant, or rather 



11 



324 Th^ Life amd Adventures 

a Siberian servant^ who was perfectly acqaainted with the cotintij ; 
and led us by private roads, so that we avoided coming into the prin- 
cipal towns and cities npon the great road, such as Tomen, Soloy 
Kaniaskoy, and several others; where the Mnscovite gamsons are 
very carious and strict in their observation npon travellers, fearing 
lest any of the banished persons of note should make their escape 
that way into Muscovy ; by this means, as we were kept out of the 
cities^ so our whole journey was through a desert, and we were obliged 
to encamp and lie in our tents. 

We entered Europe, having passed the river Kama, whidk, in these 
parts, is the boundary between Europe and Asia ; and the first city cm 
the European side was called Soloy Kamaskoy, the great city on the river 
Kama ; beyond this, we had a vast desert to pass, which, by relation, 
is near seven hundred miles long in some places, and covered with 
forests. In passing this forest, after all our danger had in imagination 
disappeared, I thought we must have been plundered and robbed, and 
even murdered by a troop of thieves ; of what country tiiey were^ whether 
the roving bands of the Ostiachi, or wild people on the bank of the 
Oby, who had ranged thus far; or whether they were the sable-hunters 
of l^3>eria, I am at a loss to know \ but they were all on horseback, 
carried bows and arrows, and were at first about five-and-forty in 
number ; they came within about two musket shot of us, surrounding 
us with their horse, and looked very earnestly upon us ; upon which 
we drew up in a little line before our camels, being sixteen men in all. 
I did not feel that we were quite safe where we were, but at about a 
quarter of a mile's distance off on our left, was a little grove or clump of 
trees, which stood close together, and very near the road ; I immediately 
resolved to advance to those trees, and fortify ourselves there as well 
as we could. We advanced immediately with what speed we could, 
and gained that little wood, the Tartars making no attempt to hinder i 

us. When we came thither, we found, to our great satisfaction, that i 

it was a swampy, springy piece of ground, and, on the one side, a ^ 

very great spring of water, which running out in a little rill or brook, j 

Was a little farther off joined by another of the like bigness; it was, in 
short, the head or source of a considerable river, called the Wirtska. 
The trees growing about this spring were -not above two hundred, 
but were very large and stood pretty thick ; so that as soon as we got i 

m, we saw ourselves perfectly safe from the enemy, unless they alighted i 

and attacked us on foot. , / 

But to make this more difficult, our Portuguese, with indefatigable ^ 

application, cut down great arms of the trees, and laid them hanging.

not cut quite off, from one tree to another; so that he made a continaed 
fence ahnost round us. 

We stayed here, waiting the motion of the enemy some hours, without 
perceiving they made any motion ; when ahout two hours hefore nighty 
they came down directly upon us ; and though we had not perceived 
it, we now found, that they had heen joined hy some more, so that 
they were near fourscore horse, whereof however, we fancied some 
were women. They came on till they were within half shot of our 
little wood, when we fired one musket without hall, and called to them 
in the Eussian tongue, to know what they wanted, and hid them keep 
off ; hut they came on with a douhle fury directly up to the wood-side, 
not imagining we were barricaded that they could not break in ; our 
old pilot was our captain, as well as he had been our engineer ; and 
desired us not to fire upon them till they came within pistol shot, 
and, that we might be sure to kill : he gave the word to fire when 
some of them were only within two pikes' length of us, and we aimed 



^\ t^^^^^ 




so true, that we killed fourteen of them, and wounded several others aj* 
also several of their horses ; for we had all of us loaded our pieces 
with two or three bullets. 

They were terribly surprised with our fire, and retreated immediately 
about one himdred rods fix)m us ; in which time we loaded our pieces 
again, and seeing them keep that distance, we sallied out, and catched 
four or five of their horses, whose riders, we suppose, were killed ; and 
coming up to the dead, we could easily perceive they were TartaiSi

but knew not from what conotiy, or how thej came to make an 
fixcureion such an unusual lengtlL 
I About an hour after, they made a motion to attack iis again, and 
fode round our little wood, to see where else thej might break in ; hut 
finding us always ready to fece them, thej went off agaim We slept 
little, you may he sure; hut ©pent the moat part of the night in 
strengthening our eituation, and harricading the entrances into the 
wood ; keeping a strict watch, w^e waited for day-light, and, when it 
came, it ga?e us a very unwelcome discovery indeed ; for the enemy, 
who, we thoughts, were discouraged with the reception they had met 
with, were now increased to no less than three hundred, and had set 
up eleven or twelve huts and tents, as if they were resolved to he^iiege 
us ; and this little camp they had pitched upon the open plain, at 
ahout three quarters of a mile from ua. This waa a terrible discovery; 
T gave myself over for lost As for my partner he was raging : he 
declared, that to lose Mb goods would he his ruin ; and he would rather 
die than be starved ; and he was for fighting it out. The young lord 
alsOj as gallitnt aR ever flesh showed itself, was for fighting to the laat 
also ; and my old pilot was of opinion that we were able to resist them 
aU ; but towards evening, we found that the number of our enemies still 
increased : perhaps, as they were abroad in several parties for prey, the 
first had sent out scouts to call for help, and to acquaint the others of 
the booty j and we did not know hut by the morning they might still 
be a greater numher ; so T began to inquire of those people we had 
brought from Tobolski, if there was no other or more private ways, by 
which we might avoid them in the night, and perhaps, either retreat to 
Bome town, or get help to guard us over the desert 

The Siberian told us, if we wished to avoid them, and not fight, he 
would engage to carry us off in the night to a way that went north 
towards the Petraz, by which he made no question but we might get 
away, and the Tartars never the wiser ; but he said, his lord had told 
him he would not retreat, but would rather fight Having satisfied 
him that his master knew better than to require sixteen men to fight 
four hundred, we prepared for departure. As soon as it began to 
be dark, we kindled a fire in our little camp, which we kept burning, 
and prepared so as to make it bum all night, that the Tartars might 
conclude we were still there ; but, as soon as we could see the stars 
(for our guide would not stir before), having all our horses and camels 
ready laden, we followed our new guide, who, I soon found, steered 
himself by the pole, or north star, all the country being level for a 
long way.

MOVING OFF AT DARK 




MOVING OFF AT DARK 



of Robinson Crusoe. 327 

When we had travelled very hard for two hours, it began to be 
lighter still ; not that it was quite dark all night, but the moon began 
to rise, so that, in short, it was rather lighter than we wished it to be; 
but by six o'clock the next morning we were forty miles ofl^ though 
the truth is, we almost spoiled our horses. Here we found a Kussian 
village, named Kirmazruskoy, where we rested, and heard nothing of 
the Kalmuck Tartars that day. About two hours before m'ght we set 
out again, and travelled till eight the next morning, though not quite so 
hard as before ; and about seven o'clock we passed a little river, called 
Kirtza, and came to a large town inhabited by Kussians, and very 
populous, called Ozomys. There we heard, that several troops, or 
hordes of Kalmucks had been abroad upon the desert, but that we 
were now completely out of danger from them. Here we were obliged 
to get some fresh horses, and having need enough of rest, we stayed five 
days; my partner and I agreeing to give the honest Siberian, who 
brought us thither, the value of ten pistoles for his conduct. 

In fi-vQ days more we came to Veussima, upon the river Witzogda, 
and running into the Dwina ; we were very happily near the end of 
our travels by land, that river being navigable in seven days' passage to 
Archangel : from hence we came to Lawrenskoy, the third of July ; 
and providing ourselves with two luggage-boats, and a barge, for our 
own convenience, we embarked the seventh, and arrived all safe at Arch- 
angel the eighteenth, having been a year and fLY% months and three 
days on the journey, including our stay of eight months and odd days 
at Tobolski. 

We were obliged to stay at this place six weeks for the arrival of 
the ships, and must have tarried longer, had not a Hamburgher come 
in above a month sooner than any of the English ships ; considering 
that the city of Hamburgh might happen to be as good a market for 
our goods as London, we all took freight with him ; and having put my 
goods on board, it was most natural for me to put my steward on board 
to take care of them ; by which means my young lord had a sufficient 
opportunity to conceal himself, never coming on shore in all the time 
we stayed there ; and this he did, that he might not be seen in the city, 
where some of the Moscow merchants would certainly have seen and 
discovered him. 

We sailed from Archangel the twentieth of August the same year; 
and, after no extraordinary bad voyage, arrived in the Elbe the 
thirteenth of September. Here my partner and I found a very 
good sale for our goods, as well those of China as the sables, &c. of 
Siberia ; and dividing the produce of our effects, my share amounted 



328 The Lije and Adventures of Bobineon Oruaoe. 

to £3,475 17«. 3d. notwithstanding so many losses we had sustained, 
and charges we had been at; only remembering that I had incloded 
in this about six hundred pounds worth of diamonds which I had 
purchased at Bengal 

Here the young lord took his leaye of us, and went up the Elbe, in 
order to go to the court of Vienna, where he resolved to seek protection^ 
and where he could correspond with those of his father^s fiiends who 
were left aliya He did not part without all the testimonies he could 
give me of gratitude for the service I had done him, and his sense of 
my kinduess to the prince his Mher. 

To conclude : having stayed near four months in Hamburgh, I came 
from thence overland to the Hague, where I embarked in the packet^ 
and arrived in London the 10th of January, 1705, having been gone 
from England ten years and nine months. 

And here, resolving to harass myself no more^ I am preparing for a 
longer journey than all these, having lived seventy-two years a life of 
infinite variety, and learned sufficiently to know the value of retirement 
and the blessing of ending our days in peace. 




THE END.
